Draco dove behind the tapestry that hid the alcove from view.  Very few people knew about this spot. And half of the ones Draco had told about it were dead.  He laid his hands flat against the wall and leaned his weight on it. Pressing against the solid stone, he focused on the pressure and feel of it.  Tried to think of nothing but his hands flat against the wall and the breaths shuddering in and out of him. His fingers curled slightly as he tightened his muscles harder against the unrelenting stone.
This was absurd.  He could feel Potter’s stare on him.  Potter cleared his throat and Draco flinched as the silence broke.  Head still down, Draco tried to see Potter out of the side of his eye.  They were both extremely early for class. Draco had hoped to avoid Potter by simply not showing up to breakfast.  If he wasn’t where he should be Potter couldn’t follow him. He hadn’t accounted for Potter to beat him at his own game.  He should’ve.
“Mr. Malfoy.” She sounded stern.
“Just because you didn’t think I deserved to be in Azkaban, didn’t mean you had to forgive me.”
Why was he so worried about Malfoy?  He shouldn’t care so much about someone who had tried to make his life a living hell.  But he

Still not really sure what I'm doing.  But even just writing this second chapter after getting some responses has reminded me of why I used to love writing.  So hopefully, I'll keep it going to the point that I'll actually remember what I'm doing. And what is the general consensus on POV shift. 'Cause I was thinking of next chapter maybe being from Harry's POV???
it feel to have The Daily Prophet writing articles calling me mad and saying I should be institutionalized?  Or! Or! How would it feel to be put on trial in front of the entire Wizengamot for defending myself against dementors that the fucking Ministry sent after me? I have no idea, Malfoy.  Why don’t you tell me? How would 12 year old you have handled that? Because, obviously, I have no god damn clue.” Potter was panting by the end of his tirade. His eyes were flashing furiously and the color spots on his cheeks contrasted sharply with his dark hair curling around his face.
He really needed to get this under control.  One look from Potter after months of being ignored.  One small thing that had differed from his perceived schedule and he had lost it.  Lost control. He couldn’t even make his body breathe correctly. He sucked in a large breath and held it.
“Well it’s not quite so bad as your ego. So I think I’ll survive.” Malfoy sniped at him.
The cover had been torn off and the binding on it was more than a bit worse for wear.  It was better kept than some of the other books in his arms. Potter stared at it with his head cocked and his mouth slightly open as if in surprise.  Potter’s eyes narrowed as he looked at the book, then Draco, then back again.
“Um...Madame?” Draco called into the semi-darkness and took another step forward.  From what he could see in the low torchlight, the beds were empty. He started walking towards the back door when there was no answer.  With his hand still clutching his side, he made it about half way across the wing before needing to stop and catch his breath. His ribs were making it hard to breathe.  In fact, all he could manage were tiny, shallow breaths that made him feel like he was using more air than he was taking in. He needed to fill his lungs, but everytime he tried the air was punched back out of him with a grimace of pain.
From what Harry had seen, Malfoy might not choose to defend himself.  He had reacted so minorly to the attack, that it was hard to believe that he felt any form of indignation at it.  Suddenly overcome with a sort of anxiousness, Harry felt the need to find Malfoy on the map.
It had been a long couple of months. Alone and ridiculed and abused.
So, I haven't written anything in...God, it's been like 5 years since I've written anything for fun let alone public consumption.  I'm trying to find my happy again and trying to find my love for writing.  I miss thinking of something and having the urge to make it a story.  I feel like I'm hecka rusty and that this is probably shit, but here you go.  Feed back is welcome.  Seriously I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing anymore, tell me how to be better.
Potter’s hand fell to swing by his sides. “Harry.”
“Okay, Potter, whatever you say.”  Draco tugged his hand away from Potter’s chest.
He was getting twitchy and paranoid.  And he didn’t even have anyone to talk to about it.  Potter was slowly driving him crazy. Draco clutched the strap of his bag and hitched it higher on his shoulder as he rounded the corner to potions.  Potter was already in the hallway waiting. His eyes tracked Draco as he came to a stop at the opposite wall a decent distance away. Draco refused to look at him.
“Serves him right.” Ron muttered under his breath.
“What,” he started to ask looking up at Malfoy.
in his chest.  It tingled and traveled out through his arms to his fingers.
He kept his head down and had just made it through the door when he felt his bag rip.  His body jerked with the force of the curse and he was whirled around as if he had been physically shoved.  His hand clamped over his cheek that was now throbbing with the bite of a stinging hex. He could feel his blood rushing through his veins, his head pounded with it. He was hyper aware of every breath entering his lungs then exiting. His hands shook and the tremor of it brushed the welt on his cheek.  Draco carefully brought his hand away, clenching it into a fist, and hissed in a pained breath as he bent to gather his scattered belongings.
Potter shrugged again.  He was looking around the classroom in obvious discomfort.  “You and me,” Potter continued.  “We’re the same.”
Draco Malfoy had always been told that the world would be his.  That whatever he wanted, he would get. And until his first day of Hogwarts, that had been true.  Thinking about it now, it only seemed fitting. He had wanted Potter then, and he wanted him now. It wasn’t
Okay, so I really struggled with this chapter.  I've kind of stagnated and had to push through.  BUT!!! But now I kind of have an idea of where I'm actually going with this.  Well, at least a little bit anyway.  No big promises from me, that's how I stopped writing in the first place.
“I’ll see you in transfiguration,” Harry said grabbing his own things and following.  Hermione and Ron said something back sounding confused, but Harry was already at the door.
Harry frowned, but told them.  “Someone hit him with a stinging hex from behind while he was leaving dinner.  He didn’t even react to it, until his bag was ripped, too. I think someone must’ve done that, too.  And all his stuff looks completely ruined.” Harry took a breath and feeling uncomfortable with the glee on Ron’s face continued.  “He refused to go to the hospital wing. And,” Harry shifted embarrassed, “he, uh, said some stuff to me. And I told him to piss off and left.”
Potter’s eyes used to stray over to the Slytherin table habitually.  It was what made him such an easy target for Draco. The second they made eye contact, Draco could quirk an eyebrow, and Potter would already be working himself up into a fit of imagined slights.
When he didn’t feel quite so much like he was choking on his own breath, Draco suddenly realized their position.  He was backed against the wall. Potter practically surrounded him. Curved protectively over Draco’s entire body.  His left hand was trapped beneath both of Potter’s against Potter’s chest. Draco could feel his heartbeat. Steady, just like Potter himself.
Draco took a breath -- after all of that, it was no wonder that Potter wanted nothing to do with Draco or his lot.
, I’ve known you for eight years.  I know exactly what’s between us and,” he shrugged, “the past is the past.  We all fought a war, but it’s over now. We need to move on. Hermione has been badgering me for ages to let the past rest.” Potter quirked a smile. “She’s been saying that for about six years.  And I’ve finally been, well, trying to. You are one of those things I need to let rest. Yes, we hated each other for si-- seven years, but we’re not the same people anymore. Obviously.”
“Someone hit him from behind?” Hermione sounded concerned, at least.
Draco stood there shifting awkwardly as Potter straddled a stool.  He leaned forward with his weight on his hands pressed on the stool between his spread legs. “So…” Potter said, leadingly.
“Malfoy!” That was Potter’s voice. Would he still save Draco? Could he even reach him? “Draco!” That level of familiarity shook him back to the present.  No one but his Mother called him Draco anymore.
“Good night, Harry.” Hermione said
Malfoy always was dramatic.  Even in doing his assignments, it seemed.  Harry took him in in a new light after last night.  Did he really find Malfoy attractive? Yes, Harry could admit that much to himself.  Malfoy was still a pointy bastard, his cheeks a little too sunken and dark bruises under his eyes from lack of sleep. But Harry would be lying if he said he didn’t think Malfoy was one of the prettiest people at Hogwarts.  He tilted his head a bit taking Malfoy in from a different angle. Harry knew Malfoy. And Harry knew that in all their years of Hogwarts the closest Malfoy had come to a relationship was Pansy Parkinson fawning over him for the first six years of their education.  But she didn’t seem to be on speaking terms with the man now. So Harry didn’t think they were together. He hadn’t really thought they were ever together. Malfoy never really acknowledged her past a friendship.
Potter let out a blustery sigh sounding frustrated. Draco clenched his fists around his bag to hide his sudden nerves.  It was fine. Potter wouldn’t do anything. He was
Ignoring Harry, Malfoy picked up his things.  Harry saw one of the books by his feet. He bent to pick it up.  The cover was gone and the binding was barely holding it together.  What was Malfoy doing with a book in this state of disrepair?
“I was trying to prove that he was up to something! And he was!” Harry said fervently.
The hospital wing was quiet when Draco entered the double doors.  Quiet and dark. He shifted uneasily when Madame Pomfrey wasn’t readily available.
“What? Not going to go crying to daddy now? Oh right, because he’s finally where he belongs.  Where you should be, too.”
Harry nodded shortly and strode over to them. Not particularly wanting to get involved, he slumped down into one of the overstuffed armchairs and coughed to get their attention. “Have either of you noticed anything odd about Malfoy since we got back?”
Harry frowned.  He was just trying to help.  Malfoy was injured. Some coward had struck him unawares from behind.  And he was just trying to help. Why did Malfoy have to make things so difficult?  Why did he have to be so abrasive? Under the frustration, that idiotic relief at Malfoy acting like himself flared again.  Harry didn’t want to feel relieved at Malfoy being a prick to him. He didn’t want anything to do with Malfoy and his stupid, pretty self.  Harry’s grip tightened in shock. He did not think Malfoy was pretty.
. Pansy melted away, and Malfoy turned his insolent gaze on Harry, a flash of silver in the subdued dark of the bar.
And they genuflected without fail: one locked away in the dark, one watching and waiting for the light.
Malfoy had been an Auror for several years now, and was proving to be an excellent field agent, but it didn’t stop Harry’s hackles rising every time he caught sight of him. Luckily they’d never had to work together, and managed to keep their distance from each other on a day-to-day basis.
Harry just curls his lip in a snarl, and falls heavily into his chair as Draco chuckles. He pulls his wand from his holster and flicks it, and a cup of tea floated over and settled on Harry’s desk.
- had betrayed him. Harry had allowed himself to get close to someone, someone other than a Weasley, and look where it had got him.
Draco says the only thing he can.
Harry snorts a laugh, not caring how inelegant Malfoy might find him. ‘I’m not irritable, Malfoy,’ he snipes, but he picks up the mug and takes a sip, ignoring Draco’s pleased smile as he drops the
Draco can’t help but laugh at that, even though Harry flashes him a hurt look. ‘Sorry, Potter,’ he apologises, taking a sip of his beer. It’s dark and hoppy, some kind of ale by the taste of it. ‘It’s just, back at Hogwarts, could you ever have imagined
All Harry had to do was get through this case, show Robards he was capable of keeping his cool, make sure Draco got the treatment he deserved at the DMLE, and then never interact with him and his hard body and his quick tongue and his delicious, tempting scent ever again.
Draco’s eyes are wide, even as his fingers skim the material at Harry’s sides. ‘It’s magically impossible to heal Cruciatus wounds,’ he protests, feebly. ‘Only time cures the pain…’
, Hermione. Just climb up here, let me do the rest. I’ll make you feel so good, I promise. Just let me taste you, darling.’
There was only one new person who knew about his identity, after all. One person who’d always had it in for Harry, no matter how he might be acting now.
the same, but the comparison still stood.
“Malfoy,” Draco intoned.  The familiarity was not helping.
Draco met her gaze head on with his chin up.  “Yes, Madame?”
Whatever his ribs were or weren’t, Draco wouldn’t know.  His vision had funneled and his ears were starting to ring.  The little gasps of air he was taking in sounded loudly in his head.  The room turned white and he knew nothing more as he fell unconscious.
Malfoy was moving away from him.  Down towards the dungeons. But Harry couldn’t let him go without knowing what was really going on.  He always had to know. Without thinking about it, Harry reached out and grabbed Malfoy by his arm. The words he wanted to ask stuck in his throat when he realized what he had done.  The last time Harry had reached out to Malfoy they had been surrounded by flames and death and Malfoy’s eyes flashed in his mind full of terror and desperation. Harry shook his head trying to dislodge the memories.
“What do you mean not this again?” Harry demanded.
Draco swallowed and cleared his throat. Still refusing to look up, he nodded. “Alright.”
“You’re absolutely right,” Potter bit out irately.  “I don’t know why I was worried. It’s just you.”
Draco tried sitting up and almost ended up horizontal again with the rush it sent to his head.  He slowly stood up and looked around at his school things. Someone had upended a bottle of ink on his half finished Transfiguration essay and it was soaking into the books beneath the parchment.  Any other assignments he had had been stamped on and torn. The thought of bending over to pick it all up sent a preemptive rush to his head. He sighed and left it all, bag included, on the floor and started his climb back up the stairs.
Draco pressed his uninjured arm to his ribs.  Staring at the ceiling and breathing against the pain, he said nothing.
Then, Potter nodded his head decisively and without a word, left as quickly as he had come.  Draco let out the breath he hadn't realized he had been holding and laid his head bonelessly exhausted against the wall, between his hands. And the day had only begun.
The whole breath came out in a choking, coughing exhale of shock when the tapestry hiding him was brushed aside and shut again before Draco's eyes could adjust to the sudden light.  Potter stared at him, green eyes practically glowing in the low light of the alcove. Draco saw Potter’s eyes trace his body.  The way Draco’s hands were still pushed harshly against the wall. How his back was curved to protect himself from anything and everything.  The deliberate way his feet were set shoulder length apart and planted firmly on the floor.
“Yes,” Draco hitched his shoulder and started down the steps. “Just me.”  His mouth curled in disgust. Just Draco the Death Eater. Just Draco the idiot.  Just Draco, who was always on the wrong side of things. Who couldn’t make the right choice if it punched him in the face.  Who could never seem to do anything right. In his parents’ eyes. In Potter’s eyes. In--
The weight in those words brought Potter up short. He swallowed, and his tongue darted out to wet his lips.
.  He rushed out of the Great Hall and up the stairs towards Transfiguration.  There was a hidden alcove in the hallway before the classroom. If he could get there.  Could be surrounded -- protected -- on all sides, he might be able to breathe.
His vision was blurred.  He felt like he was swimming through treacle.  He was dizzy and couldn’t focus. Draco tried to focus on the color green.  The warm, concerned green, green eyes in front of him. “C’mon Draco. Talk to me here.”  Potter said. “Breath with me.”
That stoked Draco’s ire.
“Night, mate.” Ron nodded at him as he walked by.
Did Malfoy get caught by some others who were out for his blood.  Panicked, Harry searched the corridors down to the dungeons. Nothing.  Maybe he had decided to go to the hospital wing, after all. Harry hurriedly flipped over to the room and let out a breath of relief.  The tingling was back in his arms and hands.
And from that very first day, Potter had wanted nothing to do with him.  Nothing at all.
And now Voldemort was dead, and Harry wasn’t.  And Harry hadn’t actually thought he would survive.  He had come to terms with that thought, and now here he was. Floating.
But that didn’t exactly mean that he would want Harry.  No one ever seemed to want Harry. They wanted Harry Potter, the boy who lived.  Who didn’t actually exist. This construct that everyone invented in their heads.  Even Ginny wouldn’t accept certain things that Harry did, because in her head Harry Potter shouldn’t still be having nightmares almost a full year after he won the war.  Harry Potter wouldn’t struggle to remember he wasn’t a little boy trapped in a cupboard. Harry Potter wouldn’t be gay. Or more likely bisexual. Because yes, Malfoy was pretty.  But he definitely still thought Ginny was, too.
. Anything to break this growing silence filled with whatever judgement Potter was ready to rain down upon him.
Harry hastily let go of Malfoy who stumbled.
He took a bracing sigh.  Nothing for it, now. He would just have to explain to Professor Killian that he couldn’t finish his transfiguration essay.  That was a laugh. As if Professor Killian would trust a word that came out of Draco’s mouth. He had been “keeping an eye on” Draco since the first day of term.  Refusing to acknowledge him in class and, Draco was sure, begrudgingly giving him the grades he deserved. It was better than Professor Hellcrest’s outright mistrust in Defense, but not any easier to deal with.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well,” Hermione said primly.  “While I do think Malfoy got off pretty easily for his past transgressions, cursing someone unawares is completely barbaric. Everyone should be given the right to defend themselves.
Kingsley had mentioned that once he sat his NEWTs he would basically have a spot on the Aurors.  Harry had nodded and thanked him and felt nothing. He wasn’t sure if he even wanted to be an Auror anymore.  It had just seemed like the only option when he had decided. The only thing that might have helped him survive Voldemort.
“Yeah.” Harry nodded.  Together they made their way to the doors.  Ron and Hermione had already picked up their argument and they walked a bit faster with the speed of their row.  Harry slowed his steps as Malfoy was approaching the door. His face was down and his hair fell to cover him. Harry had never seen Malfoy without his hair slicked back until this year.  It was a good look on him. Softened his pointiness and made him less severe. More approachable. But with these changes had come the others. Refusing to make eye contact. Never speaking in class.  Which was a relief at first, but Harry stupidly found himself missing Malfoy’s snark. Lost in his thoughts, Harry didn’t see the curse until it ripped a gasp out of Malfoy. Had someone just--
They were nothing alike. Nothing.  “No,” Draco snapped against his better judgement. “You have no idea.  No clue what it’s like to be regarded with nothing but suspicion and hatred by those who surround you.  Completely outnumbered and
(See the end of the chapter for
Did Draco deserve to be dead for what he had done?  People seemed to think Azkaban at the very least. He hadn’t been cleared in the eyes of the people. He had escaped punishment.
Instead of jumping into their conversation -- which always had a new tension to them -- Harry let his eyes drift over the Great Hall.  The other students had settled down for the most part by now. When Harry had shown up on the first night of term, the stares and whispers followed him for the night.  And the following month. Most of the upper years had settled down, as they had known him for years. The younger years still looked at him in awe and some in fear.
He was unsure of who would have been willing to gather his things without cursing them or ruining them further, let alone fixing them.  Maybe Pansy was finally willing to acknowledge the fact that they had been friends since they were children. Or, looking over at her ignoring him, maybe not.  Looking around the hall, Draco glanced up towards the Gryffindor table. His eyes subconsciously sought Potter at his usual spot at the end of the table.
Did he?
He took a sharp, bracing breath and said, “Potter, I appreciate what you did just now.  Merlin knows you’ve seen at my worst time and again, but I really don’t think you’re the best person for me to talk to.  There is too much and not enough for us to discuss things civilly.” Draco thought that was polite enough. He hadn’t even insulted Potter for insinuating that he could understand.
.” Draco spat the last word in disgust.  The color in his cheeks indicative of anger replacing the shame and embarrassment. He could see a flush rising high on Potter’s cheeks.  “What would you, the Golden Boy, know of being shunned? How could you possibly understand what it’s like to--”
Harry heaved a sigh.  The map, still open, was laying face down on his chest.  He knew Malfoy was still in the hospital wing. But he had been so adamant about not going when Harry suggested it.  Something must’ve happened after Harry left. He wondered how hurt Malfoy had to be for him to actually go see Madame Pomfrey.
He wasn’t sure what Potter was waiting for exactly.  The optimum time to strike? Having defeated the Dark Lord, Draco was pretty sure that Potter could strike whenever he wanted and still succeed.  It wasn’t like Draco would fight back, anyway. Not like he
At Slytherin table, he froze.  Sitting at his usual spot was his bag.  Mended and full of his things. He dove for it.  Digging through it he pulled out his essay. The ink had been siphoned off and it was definitely salvageable.  If he started now, he might be able to finish it. Ignoring the food and plates on the table, he laid out his parchment and start writing fervently.
“No,” Draco choked out.  He forced himself to open his eyes and meet Potter’s gaze.  “I’m sorry.”
Harry sighed and went to pile it all into Malfoy’s bag.  It was still ripped from the night before. Harry quickly mended it and tried to organize Malfoy’s possessions neatly into it.  He looked around a little lost. This didn’t make sense to Harry. Malfoy had been cleared of all charges. He was just being an idiot.  A dumb kid. They were all just kids dealt shit hands. And now Malfoy was being bullied.
“What--” Potter started to ask.  Draco snatched the book from him before he could ask.
“For fuck’s sake, Malfoy!” Harry interrupted.  “Did you go to a different school during second year or fourth year or even fifth year!  You’re so right. I have no idea what it’s like for the whole school to hate me. I had the whole of England, too. Gee, I wonder what it would be like to have the whole school think I’m the heir of Slytherin.  I just can’t imagine what it would feel like to turn every corner and see my classmates wearing badges that say Potter Stinks. Just how
Draco felt as if his blood had frozen in his veins.  His blood had drained from his face. His feet and hands tingled as he fought the need to run.  How could he be so stupid as to forget? The drag of air into his lungs felt huge. His vision was tunneling in on Potter.  The classroom was blurring.
“You should go to the hospital wing.  Your cheek is swollen.”
Granger and Weasley had continued walking and were arguing at the bottom of the first flight of stairs.  They didn’t seem to notice that they had left Potter behind.
“Well,” Potter said loudly in the quiet room.  “Lucky for you, I never know better.”
“Uh…” Harry looked over at Ron and Hermione.  Hermione was still going on about dueling to Ron.  “I’m heading up. Tired.” He said to their inquiring looks.
“Look, Mal-- Draco, you’ve obviously got a lot of, uh, things going on right now.  I just want you to know, that if you, er, wanted to,” Potter coughed seemingly embarrassed, “talk I’m sure I know a little bit of what you’re going through.”
“So.” Draco refused to look at him.  How utterly mortifying. To break down in front of Potter of all people.  Just because he was reaching out towards Draco. How destroying. The heat was still climbing his neck and face.  It was causing tears to prick in Draco’s eyes. He refused, absolutely
She pursed her lips.  Squinting at him, she said, “I know a stinging hex when I see one.  And somehow I doubt the stairs did that.”
“Well, Harry,” Hermione said delicately. “You do have quite the track record of… erm…” She trailed off looking wary.
He was just staring at Draco.  Almost glaring, really. Draco could feel his shoulders tightening and curling up to protect himself against the attention.  He had wanted it for so long, but not now. Not when it could ruin everything.
Harry sighed again and with his and Malfoy’s bag on his shoulder started off towards the Great Hall.  There were only a few early risers in there at this time. Harry quickly strode over to Slytherin table and set the bag down where he had seen Malfoy sitting the night before.  He cast a quick little warding spell to deter anyone from messing with it until he got there.
It had been all Draco could do to hold onto his magic and his cool, and not just come on the spot from the feel of Harry, broad and hard, pinning him in place. Their inspection at the Society had been carried out in awkward silence, Potter holding himself stiffly and carefully apart. He hadn’t offered to Side-Along back to the Ministry.
Harry just flashes him a confused look of surprise, drawing his fingers away when the glass is in Draco’s grasp, and sits besides him. Draco catches Harry waving his fingers below the table top, and a low buzzing sound of the

Beside him, Malfoy leaned closer, letting one of his booted ankles curl around Harry’s leg, the point of his heel digging ever-so-slightly into Harry’s calf.
‘Now, where’s my cup of tea?’ he murmurs, with a lazy imperiousness.
Day 3: Blaise x Neville - Drugs / Intoxicants
‘Good boy, Harry,’ Draco murmured, and Harry broke into a weary smile. Draco stood from the sofa, tucking himself away, and looked down at Harry and Hermione. They were wrecked and naked and utterly debauched, entwined on the sofa, a sprawl of tangled limbs and hair, and Draco was picture perfect control, elegant, cool, unruffled except for the slight wildness to his silver eyes.
The Horntail almost falls backwards in its surprise. It’s enough for the other handlers to cast their charms, bringing it carefully down as Potter pulls Charlie to safety.
When to stroke his hair, kiss his face, whisper sweet, selfless words of love.
A Veela.
Most people, if they found themselves pushed up against a wall with an angry werewolf panting over them, would have stank of it.
Harry pushed up against Draco’s body, capturing his mouth in a searing kiss as he wrapped his hand around Draco’s cock, already starting to get hard again. ‘Good,’ he growled against Draco’s sweet, smirking lips. ‘Because now I’ve had you, I’m never letting you go.’
He looks up, and Charlie is unguarded, uncharmed, and facing the furious Horntail. It opens its jaws and roars, long and loud and terrible, and Charlie reaches for his wand but Draco knows it’s going to be too little, too late.
‘Hermione.’ Harry’s voice was low and broken, heavy with lust and danger. ‘Hermione, look at me.’
Malfoy looked him up and down, slowly, and smiled as he waved his hand and the stool next to him slid smoothly out. Harry perched on top of it, flagging down the bartender and ordering two more Firewhiskies.
The parchment smells like Draco: heat and spice and longing. Harry is instantly transported back to the archives, the helplessness he’d felt in Draco’s presence. The hard, warm, pliancy of Draco’s body, his
. He gets nightmares, and only settles when you press against him, chest to back.
‘Fine,’ he agrees shortly, and Robards gave them a satisfied smile as Harry and Malfoy stand up.

He was leaning against one of the empty beds when Madame Pomfrey finally came out of the back room.
His eyes caught a flash of white and he couldn’t help fixating on it.  Years of habit still unbroken.
Potter shrugged again.  He was looking around the classroom in obvious discomfort.  “You and me,” Potter continued. “We’re the same.”
“You should go to the hospital wing.  Your cheek is swollen.” Harry always had the need to take care of people. Even the ones he didn’t particularly like.  Hermione told him it probably had to do with the Dursley’s treatment of him. But Harry didn’t like to analyze himself, and he liked to talk about the Dursley’s even less.
When he reached his normal spot, Harry saw him freeze. Malfoy stared at the bag for a few stressed beats of Harry’s heart before practically ripping it open to check inside.  Harry saw him release a huge breath when he realized all of his things were there and relatively unharmed. A small smile graced his face when he took out his transfiguration assignment and saw that it wasn’t completely ruined.
But, boy, it's been a struggle to write this chapter.  I've literally been working on it since I read the comment. And, like, it's not even long but I just couldn't think. So hopefully it's not too bad. And we'll keep trying.
Grimacing, he thought about how the students that had cursed him wouldn’t like not seeing their handy work.  Ever since Draco’s return to school, he had kept the marks of the jinxes inflicted on him. Not as trophies of some pride he didn’t have, but to show those inflicting them that he knew.  He knew this is what he deserved. And he would bear it as they felt he should. It also helped that if he was already sporting some form of injury there was a reprieve in actively going after Draco.
Draco huffed out a surprised laugh. “What?”
Harry was still thinking about him when he entered Gryffindor tower.  Ginny walked up to him when she noticed his presence.
Harry refused to feel bad for him.  Malfoy would never admit to needing Harry’s help.  Harry was surprised that Malfoy hadn’t demanded to remain with the fiendfyre just to prove that he didn’t need Harry to save him.  Harry took a deep breath and mounted the stairs leading up to Gryffindor. He was thinking irrationally. He always seemed to when it came to Malfoy.  He couldn’t remember a time when Malfoy hadn’t been able to rile him. To get under his skin in a way no one else seemed able.
would deal with it nicely, Draco was sure.
“Don’t worry your pretty, little brain over it, Potter,” Malfoy snarked.  Harry felt a spark of relief that he stamped down on and refused to analyze. “It’s just a text.”
Potter cut him an unimpressed look. “
Potter had spent all of term acting like Draco didn’t exist, and now, all of a sudden, he was watching.  If Potter suddenly felt the urge to start hexing Draco because he finally realized everyone else was, then Draco was absolutely, utterly fucked.  He could handle a couple of Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws seeking retribution for what the Dark Lord had done. But Potter was personal. Years of ridicule from Draco and trauma from Draco’s father would make this punishment specifically designed for Draco’s past transgressions.
Potter pried one of his hand off of the strap of his bag and placed it flat against his chest. Draco could feel as Potter dragged a deep breath in and the released it just as slow.  “There you go.” Draco followed suit.
“The other Slytherins know better to interact with me.” Draco admitted quietly.
Today would be for planning.  Figuring out the best ways to protect Draco.  From students and from himself. Tomorrow. Tomorrow would be the first day of making Draco better, safer, and most importantly his.
Draco cleared his throat.  “Fine. Just fine, Potter. Thank you,” he ground out.  He had no reason to be embarrassed. It wasn’t as if he had lost a duel.  Someone had cast a spell at his back. Of course he hadn’t--
Malfoy, too.  That he likes blueberry muffins with the berries picked out.  The he eats more vegetables than meat in his meals. That he always gets in a strop if he can’t find his favorite eagle feather quill.  That his eyes are a harsh sleet, grey that can send shivers down Harry’s spine. That he-- Fuck, Harry thought staring at Malfoy’s dot laying in bed in the hospital wing.  Harry knows Malfoy. In ways that he never knew Ron or Hermione, or even Ginny.
Draco chewed his lip uneasily. “Harry,” he nodded. “That’s going to take some getting used to.”
“Goodness!” she said, taking Draco in.  “What happened here?”
Should he be happy now?  He was relieved, but happy?  He just didn’t know. It’s not like much had changed.  He was still the center of all sorts of unwanted attention.  Still hailed as a hero for something forced upon him. Still a parentless orphan.  Still a little boy locked in a cupboard. Harry just wanted… Well, he didn’t
“Someone just cursed you from behind.”
“Harry,” she said.
“Yeah, but I did.  I do.” His hand squeezed Draco’s unconsciously.  “I’m serious if you want to, you know, talk. You seem to be on your own a lot this year.  And like I said, the war’s over. I think it’s time we move forward. Starting with you and me.  Otherwise who knows how short it will be before another war based on hatred?”
years of history with him.  Didn’t shape every aspect of Draco’s life for those past eight years.  Hadn’t responded to Draco so addictingly dynamic. Hadn’t carved out a part of himself into Draco’s chest.  It was as if he and the other returning students in Slytherin simply didn’t exist to Potter.
As Harry watched, Malfoy heaved a great sigh and pushed his plate away.  Making a snap decision Harry, too, pushed his plate away and stood. Hermione and Ron were already standing, he suddenly realized.  Harry looked at them in surprise.
Draco’s head snapped up at the sound of footsteps approaching him.  Potter was heading towards him with his hand outstretched. And just like that, Draco was in a burning room.  The acrid smell of smoke filled his head. Flames. Burning flesh. The scent of his own sweat. And Potter as they flew, defying death.  He could feel his breaths being punched out of his lungs. His hands were shaking. He wouldn’t be able to grab Potter. He would die. The smoke was clawing at his throat.  Choking off his breath. He was alone.
A voice annoyingly like his father’s filled his head.
told Harry that it was almost six.  Too early, by far, but still a decent enough time to get up.
“What do you want, Potter?” Malfoy sounded resigned to whatever Harry wanted from him.  But he sounded far away from Harry. Distant in a way that had nothing to do with proximity.  Trying to come back to the present, Harry focused on Malfoy.
He hastily beat a retreat, refusing to look up at her as he left.  Casting a quick
Draco heard Potter state the obvious and continued to gather his things as if he hadn’t spoken.  Potter, Draco was sure, could see the irony in Draco being taken unawares from behind after that incident in fourth year.  Draco stood up with his books and parchment all held haphazardly in his arms. He glanced up and saw Potter holding his Potions textbook.
" It was mine. Remember the wand waving I did earlyer when I asked you to touch it? There's a special spell that transfers the ownership. It doesn't belong to me anymore and no one, including me, has access except you. "
The flash of the floo had us on our feet standing between the intruder and our kids. we flung curses at the first figure who we saw before I realized it was Teddy.
" It only hurts them if they are trying to steal it, get something in it or trying to hurt you. So it can be used as a weapon against someone who tries to attack you. " Harry was staring at Draco's hand.
" Not, not allowed.to read the books. But sometimes when aunt petunia and Dudley and uncle Vernon go out, and forget to lock me up I go and read the books in Vernon's study. " Welling and I shared a look. Damn those muggles.
" It's hot chocolate made from imported white chocolate and a touch of honey and cinnamon. I added a bit of cream to the top of yours and a bit of dark chocolate shavings to mine." Harry looked curiously at the beverage again, before leaning back in the surprisingly comfortable chairs.
"Okay, pot- Harry has several creature inheritances, one of which is obliviously a dragon, another some kind of fox thing, but what would give him feathers?"
also! mentions of child abuse!!!! don't get triggered keep yourself safe. I will put up before chapter they apply to warnings when necessary.
" Harry?" Draco said quietly. " you're uncle. " Harry visibly flinched
" I'm okay, its just everything is crazy right now. My mate is Harry James Potter. My mate Harry James Potter has multiple creature inheritances, which almost never happens, and inherited two years early, because his muggle swine of an uncle abused him. for years it seams. And before I even get the chance to talk with him he turns into a little kid who's jumpier than a Camett and scared of adults and with out of control magic! I don't know what to do! If he will be okay! If he'll ever go back to the harry potter I know! and if he does will he ever forgive me for all the terrible things I've done to him and his friends. What dad did to that Weasely girl. everything between us is such a mess, and he may not even give me a chance to explain when he goes back to being himself, and if he's stuck like this? I won't be hurt for not having my mate but I won't really have him. I won't be able to be with him. "
Harry's tail which had stayed tucked between his legs was starting to come out. Luna smiled at him.
" I- where am I?! Where's-"
Once they got to the hospital draco  stayed in the room. He watched as they cast healing spells and wispered anxiously to each other. they transfered Potter, to Hogwarts. Because madame pomfrey knew his history better.When he heard a crack he looked up anxiously. His father put a hand on his shoulder.
" Look Weasley if it was up to me I wouldn't go anywhere near your filthy tower but as both our heads of house are forcing us let's just get it over with. " It was decided that Harry would stay with me in the Slytherin dorms until he either reverted back to fifteen or it was decided that he wouldn't revert anytime soon and he was taken into live with someone. The two younger Weasley's voiced numerus protests until both professor Snape and professor McGonagall took house points and gave them detentions for baseless accusations.
Harry closed his eyes and tried to get the flashing green out of his head the wails of Cedric's father..
" there isn't one son, your mother in our school days used to put it on the inside of all of my clothes." he shuddered " she and Ms. Evens, were a terrifying force. "
" He had five broken ribs one of which pierced his left lung, broken and dislocated ankle, a concussion and small skull fracture, and two shattered wings. "
The feast continued as normally as one could expect, save for Neville longbottom and Draco Malfoy of all people joining Luna at the ravenclaw table. Even more surprising was no teacher objected.
" Whose they?"
" Professor, I think his home life needs to be investigated. " Draco gravelly said his eyes darkening.
" Yes, we have this under control Mr
"No wonder Weasley and potter keep you around, you are almost a research queen yourself." Hermione stiffened, not distracted by the complement.
By the time we realized what was happening and that there was no stopping the people we used to be friends with, it was too late." Lucious held tightly to his left forearm. " We were slaves to him just like the rest. Severus became a spy and we fed him information from the inner circle until he got in himself. After the dark lord fell, and Lilly and James Potter were killed. " His voice caught." We were still trapped most of the true followers pyscopaths like your aunt became, were still free. If we tried to change sides we'd be killed, if we tried to run and hide we'd be killed. We had to keep up the act at least in public. The lestange's gave us their elf and we had to keep up the act in private too. I don't know if I can forgive myself for the things we did to that elf. I can't tell you how relieved I was when the Potter boy freed him. "
Harry ignores Draco’s comment, crossing his arms and trying his best to look unbothered. ‘So, now what?’ he asks, and Draco looks up in confusion.
‘You’re a proper Auror too, Malfoy,’ Harry manages eventually, even as Malfoy snorts in cold amusement. ‘Wait…are they still getting you to do entry-level jobs?’ Harry thinks over the last few weeks with Draco. The Diagon patrols, the paperwork, the menial cases they’d been assigned, and now this: permit-wrangling. These were all jobs Harry did in his first year, until he got partnered up and cleared for field duty.
Draco wakes up slowly the next day, tired and grouchy and with a headache he knows is entirely Firewhisky-induced. With a groan he reaches for his wand, lazily Accio’ing a hangover potion and stumbling to the shower, where he lets the too-hot water sluice away his exhaustion.
As Draco pants and pulses and cries Harry’s name, the scent from his orgasm rising from him like a drug, Harry breathes in deeply, lets Draco’s presence fully engulf him, and thrusts up into him once more before the waves of pleasure hit him. It’s like being pulled under water, being drowned in the most intense way possible. He feels like he drifts off on the tide of his orgasm, dazed and free.
what he wants.
Draco steps into your space. He pulls your wand up to his temple.
, Harry. I’m yours. Make me yours.’
‘Your homework’s late.
Draco gulps and nods hastily. ‘Okay,’ he agrees, billywigs starting to flutter madly in his stomach. He’s been to Muggle London before, of course, with Pansy, but Potter is giving him a skeptical look nonetheless.
‘You certainly are,’ Draco agrees out loud, and both his boys nuzzle up to him in delight.
‘A word, Mister Malfoy.’
‘Fuck, Malfoy,’ Harry muttered weakly, and Draco reached forward with his other hand, his fingers curling around Hermione’s in Harry’s hair. ‘Draco,
He could hear low murmurs around him, and knew it was the dark wizards he’d faced off to earlier. He remembered being hit by a Stunner - like an idiot, he hadn’t raised his
Harry looks down, greens eyes blazing with lust.
It’s not much, but it’s a good start.
‘You feel… so

Possessiveness, creature fic, Veela fic, Veela Draco, mates, anger, Draco x Harry, tribble
He arches helplessly into empty air. A taunting laugh echoes above him.
Draco resumed his thrusting, finally letting himself lose control. He cursed quietly, his hands wrapping around Harry’s waist, his eyes closed and his chest heaving, spilling himself into Harry. A moment later he pulled himself free, running a gentle hand along Harry’s back.
‘Wandless
Unaware of Draco’s thoughts, Harry makes his way over to their table, glasses in his hands. When he passes Draco’s over, Draco makes a point of letting his fingers brush Harry’s: a sign of solidarity, of sorts.
‘Leave them on,’ Harry growled. Draco looked up at him, his eyes darkening, and effortlessly straightened up again. He lazily raised an eyebrow and waved his hand casually. His tight trousers disappeared, leaving Draco naked except for the high heels and - Harry gulped, his cock uncomfortably hard and throbbing beneath his clothes - a pair of red, lacy French knickers, cut high on his perfect arse.
They land at Grimmauld Place, in the hallway just outside Harry’s bedroom. Draco is in Harry’s arms, warm and soft and compliant, and Harry can’t help nuzzling against him as they land, breathing in the scent of him. He lowers Draco carefully to his feet, and backs him against the wall, pinning him in place, giving a satisfied purr when he smells the arousal simmering around Draco. Then Draco shifts, and winces, and the bitter scent of pain blooms in the air, making Harry’s heart constrict.
He steps into the Floo, idly wondering if Robards’ would let him get away with booking a week’s leave, but when he steps out into his house at the other end, he has an even better idea.
‘I don’t know what you’re talking about, Potter.’
Draco smiles triumphantly.
, long and hard, gorgeous, glistening under the spray of the shower. Just moments before Malfoy had been holding himself,
. He’s the only person in the whole world who calls you
‘Gods,
Molly laughed her warm, infectious laugh, the one that had the power to warm Draco from the inside. ‘Oh, absolutely,’ she agreed merrily. They carried on chatting, breaking to greet Ron and Hermione when they stepped through the Floo. Ron gave Draco an awkward nod as always, and Hermione, very pregnant and glowing with it, stood up on tiptoes to press her lips against Draco’s cheek.
. It’s Malfoy - he’s… it wasn’t
: empty Firewhisky bottles lie discarded in the empty eighth year common room. A cigar stub smoulders in a crystal-cut ashtray.
Harry shook his head like a wet dog, cursing himself for not staying focused. Ron, across the bullpen at his desk, gave Harry a bemused look of concern. Harry kept his eyes trained down to the paperwork on his desk, refusing to look directly at his friend.
Draco recovered first, drawing his wand with a smirk and Transfiguring his and Theo’s clothes into Slytherin-coloured Hogwarts uniforms. Hermione lowered her book, pushing her chest out a little. In unison, Draco and Theo’s gazes dropped to her cleavage, emphasised by the barely-buttoned shirt and loosened tie.
‘What the — ?’
Harry stretches and looks up, determined to distract Hermione from the subject of Malfoy. The afternoon had drifted into early evening, and it was about time for him and Hermione to start dinner. Ron would be home from the Ministry in an hour or so, and Harry found that helping Hermione in the kitchen helped him, keeping his hands busy and his mind occupied. He needed the distraction: the full moon was tomorrow. Harry was still drinking the enhanced Wolfsbane Potion Draco had made for him. The twinge of sorrow he felt as he poured the potion into his tea was worth it for the benefits the new formula gave him.
There were so many things Draco loved about Harry being a werewolf.
His peace doesn’t last long.
Hermione gulped and nodded, even as a spark of excitement flared to life in her stomach. Draco helped her stand up, and she saw the damp patch on his trousers from her betrayal, making her cheeks flush even warmer than before. He closed his legs and patted the tops of his thighs, and Hermione carefully lowered herself over him, her eyes facing the ground and her bum in the air. Draco stroked it, lovingly, before saying ‘count to ten for me, Granger,’ and letting his palm connect with her bum with a loud slap in the quiet of the room. She gasped and counted, just as he commanded, until her skin was tender and warm, and she was aching and desperate once again. After the tenth slap, Draco gently pushed her thighs apart and slid two fingers inside her, as she clenched around him and bit her lip to stop from begging.
Harry looked up to find Draco watching him expectantly, those sinful lips curved into a sinful smile, his Auror robes neatly in place. Harry grinned back, standing and grabbing his own robes, and they walked together to the elevator, where Draco’s delicious scent curled around Harry, and he stood just close enough so their arms brushed against each other.
‘You want this, don’t you? You want me?’ Harry asks, his words a confusing mix of command and plea.
Blaise always made Draco come, always swallowed it down, always licked him clean afterwards.
‘Might as well come over here,’ he said, tensing his stomach so his abs popped. Hermione couldn’t tear her eyes away, much as she tried. ‘Please, Hermione. Just — come and ride my face. Let me taste you. Draco doesn’t need to know…’
He slowly went about picking it all up.  Bullying anyone was still just bullying regardless of motive.  Drawing his wand, Harry cast the strongest
Draco didn’t know where they were going.  But he wasn’t really in any position to argue or fight.  Up ahead, a door flew open as Potter approached. He hauled Draco into the abandoned classroom and kicked the door shut behind them.
“Coming, mate?” Ron asked.
Well, here's Harry's point of view on what he's seen.  I'm still kind of floundering with this.  I'm not sure where I'm taking it other than Draco and Harry getting together.  Plot seems to be escaping me...
Malfoy sat alone at Slytherin table.  He was always alone these days. No one seemed to dare step close to him, even in his own house.  Malfoy was pushing his food around his plate, not looking up or actually eating any of it. His brow was furrowed and he looked pale.  Well, Harry thought, paler than normal. His pointy features seemed more prominent with his sallow, thin face.
Potter, realizing he had pronounced himself an idiot, tried to backtrack. “I mean, I always take the path of most resistance.  The challenge. Us Gryffindors like a challenge.”
Draco can’t remember the last time Potter looked at him.  And, Merlin, wasn’t that pathetic. That he was still trying to win Potter’s attention. Eight years.  Eight years Draco had been fishing for this acknowledgement. This
Potter squinted at him with pursed lips.  “Yeah, right. I have no idea what you’re like.” He said scathingly.  He pushed back from his position on the stool. “Draco--”
He thought to himself.  One more big breath in. His lungs expanded, and after struggling to breathe last night, Draco held it in just to feel the full expanse of his lungs.
told Draco that he wouldn’t have enough time to eat breakfast if he wanted to gather his things.  If they were even still there. He continued on towards the dungeons. His heart sank when he saw all of his things gone.  Not a single item had been left behind. If the house-elves had gotten to it, they would’ve thought it was garbage from the state of it.  If his classmates had gotten to it… Who knew what happened to it? A quick
“Someone cursed Malfoy?” Ron enthused.  He leaned forward on the couch towards Harry.  “What happened?” He had a soft smile on his face as he thought about Malfoy being punished.
Staring unseeingly at the map, Harry thinks that it makes sense in his own fucked up way of life.  Of course when he realizes he finally wants something for himself it would have to be something this complicated.  But god damn it if Harry wasn’t at least going to try. Even if it was Malfoy that he wanted.
Draco wasn’t sure what was going on.  It had been a few days since Potter had discovered him in that hidden alcove, and no matter how much Draco tried to avoid him Potter seemed to be everywhere.  Ten paces ahead or behind Draco at all times.
Harry had been drifting since the end of the war.  He had, in his mind, finished his only real purpose in life.  And now he was just kind of...here. He had only come back to Hogwarts because Hermione and Ron had decided to.  He wouldn’t know what to do on his own.
But that was selfish, and he preferred to focus on the punishment aspect more.  Madame Pomfrey was bustling around the hospital wing and looked up when she heard him moving about.
“Well, it looks like you sprained your wrist, and you have quite a few bruises.  And your ribs--”
Today would be for planning.  Figuring out the best ways to protect Draco.  From students and from himself.  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow would be the first day of making Draco better, safer, and most importantly his.
Looking around, Harry saw no trace of Malfoy.  He quickly made his was outside of the transfiguration classroom and still found no sight of Malfoy.  Harry checked the map and found his dot in a hidden alcove a few feet back up the corridor.
“You think this is funny, death eater?” One of the Hufflepuffs spat out.
Draco could feel heat flooding his face at this unveiling of his vulnerability. Of his inability to function outside of what Draco felt was correct.  Draco stood up slightly, straightening his back. But he couldn’t make himself remove his hands from the stable surface of the wall.
Instead, he bit his tongue.
Draco closed his eyes to block everything out. Potter’s heartbeat was more rapid now.  But the breaths were just as steadying. “I’m sorry,” Draco breathed.
, Draco wanted to ask.
Taking a bracing breath, Harry ducked under the tapestry and let it fall closed behind him.  He heard Malfoy let out a large choking breath while his eyes adjusted. When he could see, Harry’s heart stuttered a bit.  Malfoy looked paler than ever. A stark contrast to the purpling skin around his eyes. He had both hands pressed against the flagstone and every muscle was tense.  He looked like he was holding himself together with nothing but sheer will.
“I do not--” Harry sputtered indignantly.  “I do not stalk Malfoy!”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry hadn’t been able to sleep after his epiphany.  This attraction felt like it had come out of nowhere, but looking back on it… Malfoy seemed kind of inevitable.  They had been entwined in each other’s lives since they were children. The way they could influence each other was a bit absurd now that Harry thought about it.
(See the end of the chapter for
It felt like forever before he showed up.  Hermione and Ron had joined him not too long after he had sat down.  Ron looking groggy and like he’d much rather still be in bed. Hermione fully awake and already rattling on about the upcoming classes for the day.  Harry nodded along at the right places and slowly ate the food on his plate. And finally,
Harry's POV - Harry had been drifting since the end of the war.  He had, in his mind, finished his only real purpose in life.  And now he was just kind of...here.
“It happens sometimes.” Potter said self-deprecatingly.
Then, Potter nodded his head decisively and without a word, left as quickly as he had come.  Draco let out the breath he hadn't realized he had been holding and laid his head bonelessly exhausted and the day had only begun.
Harry suppressed a smile of his own when Malfoy ignored breakfast to finish it.  Relieved now that he knew Malfoy was unharmed at the moment and at least a little bit happy, Harry tucked in properly to his meal.  He downed the last sip of his pumpkin juice and looked back over to Malfoy. He seemed to be finishing up his assignment with ever more flourishing swipes of his quill.
“You’re absolutely right,” Harry spat.  He didn’t care about Malfoy. He hated Malfoy. “I don’t know why I was worried. It’s just you.”
Heat was rising in Draco’s cheeks and he looked down and away.  Subconsciously, he was still following along to the pace of Potter’s breath.  Which is why he noticed immediately when it froze for a second. Draco tensed, too.  Footsteps were echoing of the walls down to them.
Potter took a deep breath and let it out in another sigh.  Bracing himself this time. “Okay,” he said. “Come on.” Potter twisted his right hand around Draco’s wrist.  Draco could feel him covering part of the mark. The ugly stain on his skin. Potter levered himself up from his squat and pulled Draco up with him.  Keeping a hold on Draco, Potter turned away from the approaching students and tugged Draco along behind him.
He looked fine to Harry, but he had just come from the hospital wing and Madame Pomfrey wouldn’t let him leave anything less than perfect.  He walked with his head down towards Slytherin table.
All eyes fell onto Draco and Potter as the door to the potions classroom opened before them.  Slughorn eyes squinted at Draco before alighting on Potter and in a genial voice asked, “Not getting into any trouble boys, now are we?”
anything.  That was kind of the problem.
Draco’s breath froze in his lungs.  Potter was staring at him.
“Fuck. Shit.” Potter was coming towards him again. “Okay, Draco.  Come on.” Potter placed Draco’s hand back over his chest. Surrounded by both of his hands.  He took those same deep breaths as before. “Breathe with me, Draco.”
Draco watched the ceiling swirl and felt like he was going to fall over.  But. But he was already laying down, wasn’t he? Did he have a concussion?
to cry in front of Potter.
“Someone just cursed you from behind.”  Harry watched as a welt appeared on Malfoy’s pristine white cheek.  The red seemed so at odds with the rest of him that Harry couldn’t seem to process this.  Malfoy’s school things had been scattered, too. His bag had been ripped.
“Oh, not this again.” Ron moaned.  Giving up on the fight, he flopped down onto the couch to the left of Harry.  Hermione sat down on it, as well. Her hair had frizzed even more in the heat of the fire.
“Don’t worry your pretty, little brain over it, Potter,” Draco said sounding the most like himself he had in two years.  “It’s just a text.” He made to walk towards the dungeons, but Potter grabbed his arm. And unless he wanted to recollect all his belongings, Draco couldn’t pull away.
“Alright, Malfoy?” Potter asked.
Giving it up as a lost cause, Draco turned and made his way back towards the entrance and the Great Hall.  Perhaps breakfast would help. Unlikely, but perhaps. He walked in with his head down and could feel the stares of some of his classmates tracking him.  Goosebumps shivered down his arms and back.
Nodding to himself decisively, Harry sat up in bed and decided to go for a bit of a wander in the dungeons.  See if he could suss out any information from the corridor or the portraits as to what happened last night.
While he pondered this, Malfoy’s gaze met his.  Usually Harry was the one catching Malfoy glaring at him.  This reversal of roles gave Harry a bit of a start, but he met Malfoy’s eyes head on.  He was nothing if not foolishly brave.
“Yes, alright,” Hermione said placatingly.  “He was. But he hasn’t done anything at all this term.  He’s been practically docile. I think he must be quite concerned with how he’ll survive once school is done.”
Harry’s hand twitched fighting the urge to look at Malfoy’s name on the map again.  He felt restless, though. His legs kept twitching and he couldn’t get his mind to still long enough to fall asleep.  Casting a quick
Hermione lifted an eyebrow at him, a bit condescending.  “Harry, he has the dark mark. No one in their right mind will want to employ a Malfoy.  And after all these years do you really think he deserves anything else?”
The other students blamed Draco for what others did and what they thought Draco had done.  Potter knew exactly what Draco had done and exactly what kind of person Draco was. He knew better than anyone what Draco deserved as punishment for his crimes. He was always, annoyingly present whenever Draco made the wrong choices. Maybe this was why Potter had testified at his trial. To get the opportunity of retribution for himself.
The hospital wing wasn’t exactly close to the dungeons, and he didn't want to get caught out by anyone else looking for a go at him.  He moved slowly trying not to agitate his ribs. He heaved a sigh at the thought of his walk and winced at the stretch of his lungs.  His shoes tapped clearly against the flagstones and he walked in silence.
Potter knows what sacrifice is demanded from him.
, of all people, rankles.
A touch, this time, to anchor their soft grief in place. They face it, together.
The day ended as perfectly as every other day did, now. In bed with Harry, chest to chest and face to face, their bare legs entangling beneath the crisp, clean bedsheets. Draco breathed in the familiar scent of Harry, smiled to himself as Harry gave an enormous, contented sigh that always seemed to precede him saying something painfully honest or unbearably romantic.
‘Nothing,’ Malfoy replies, shortly. ‘I know there’s some bad blood in our past, Potter, but I thought we’d both outgrown that by now. You’re my partner, in case you haven’t noticed, and I want us to do well on this case together. I didn’t realise your…
Malfoy looked him up and down, slowly, and smiled as he waved his hand and the stool next to him slid smoothly out. Harry perched on top of it, flagging down the bartender and ordering two more Firewhiskies.
? You and me, drinking in a Muggle pub together, as if we’re friends?’
‘Let’s get started on this case, shall we?’ Potter says coldly, and Draco obediently picks up the first file and starts to read. They manage a full twenty minutes of silence, as their tea cups slowly empty and the DMLE gradually fills with Aurors and noise and chaos. Then Harry throws down the file he’s been reading and huffs in exasperation.
‘You’re insufferable sometimes,’ Harry grumbled into the space between their lips, although his arms held him close and firm, and his nose nuzzled gently against Draco’s cheek. ‘But I love you.’
Harry is stony-faced for just a moment, then a smile tugs on his lips. ‘You’re right,’ he concedes, lifting his glass in salutation. ‘To new beginnings?’
Draco always chose the booth right at the back of the Leaky Cauldron, sitting with his back against the wall, nursing a Firewhisky. He’d cast a Notice-Me-Not over them - his were particularly strong - and give Harry a meaningful glance.
Draco starts to feel like he’s gone ten rounds with a hippogriff when it comes to Potter’s mood swings. From the pub the other night, where Draco had thought they’d been burying the hatchet, maybe forging a new friendship, Potter had sunk into a familiar pattern of irritation, anger and occasional indifference towards him.

wanted.
Auror, it’s just—’ Harry pauses, taking another sip of his drink. He wasn’t sure what the “just” was, really. He tries again. ‘It’s just - I didn’t complain when he got the job, and I’ve kept out of his way, you know? And now Robards is forcing us together, and for what? To prove I can play nicely, that there’s nothing for him to worry about if he promotes me?’ Harry bites his lip, trying to stop the feral growl bubbling in his chest. The fact that his wolf is always

‘Come here, Potter.’ He spoke quietly, just loud enough for Harry to hear him over the water. As if hypnotised, Harry found himself walking towards Malfoy, who was looking increasingly like the Kneazle that got the cream. He nodded to Harry’s hands, still clutching his towel around himself. ‘And drop the towel.’
Harry’s whole body was cold, and a relentless buzzing rose in his ears.
Harry stumbles as he lands, his eyes so blurred with tears it’s as if he needs glasses again. He wipes a hand across his face, pulling the evidence of his hurt away. He will
this?
Draco hisses next to him, just loud enough for Harry to hear, and even as his wolf purrs happily, Harry resolutely ignores him, storming out of Robards’ office.
‘And no touching, Granger. Yourself, or him.’ Hermione tore her eyes away from Harry’s wanton form, gulping and nodding.
Chapter 10: Jubilee
‘Can I kiss you?’ Harry asked, unable to keep the note of reverence from entering his voice.
before, but he can’t imagine another day going by without him getting to do this with Draco. He
‘For you?’ he replies, ‘I’ve waited far long enough.’ He kisses Draco before the smug little smirk gets too big, and then finally gives in to his urge to see Draco fully. He pushes up onto his knees between Draco’s thighs, gazing down at his long, lean body. Draco bites his lip as he watches, his eyebrow raised at Harry’s slow appraisal.
, ignoring the flash of frustration in Draco’s eyes as he looked down his body at Harry. Harry leaned down and bit Draco’s lean, muscled thigh, sucking hard enough to leave a bruise.
PS I’m glad you liked the jeans.
They perch together on a wall next to Flourish and Blotts, beneath a powerful Notice-Me-Not cast by Harry, and watch in companionable silence as people dash by, looking from Flourish and Blotts to Fortescue’s on the other side, their eyes sliding right over Harry and Malfoy. It makes Harry think wistfully of his first visit to wizarding London with Hagrid, and how the Muggles didn’t seem to notice the Leaky Cauldron. He’s so caught up in his thoughts, Harry is woefully unprepared for what next comes out of Malfoy’s mouth.
‘What?’ Harry replies, confused. ‘We shagged in your office earlier.’
‘Well, aren’t you a clever boy,’ Draco murmured, and Harry grinned up at him. ‘But I need you to do something else for me.’
‘Please,’ Draco gasps.
Harry whirled to face Draco, who was ashen beneath his already-pale skin, his silver eyes heavy with worry. For a moment he looked like he was going to pull Harry into a comforting hold, then his eyes flickered up and met Harry’s furious gaze, and he faltered and took a guilty step backwards.
Harry got to his feet, ignoring Ron’s call of surprise, and wandered over to Malfoy as if under an
Loving.
Draco understands: they’ve both had their minds violated in the past, both learned to be defensive.
See Miracle number 1. Another case, another completion. With the chaotic sounds of the city below them, Auror robes flung unceremoniously around the room, Malfoy was finally naked, pale and scarred, in Harry’s arms. Harry came hard, the word
‘You’re a fully-qualified Potioneer?’ he hisses at him, accidentally scowling at a little old witch who scurries by. ‘What the fuck, Malfoy? Why haven’t you told Robards this?’
Harry thrusts into Draco, burying himself right up to the hilt with one smooth, firm move. Draco’s eyes fall shut and Harry curses and drops his head into Draco’s neck, breathing in the tempting, faint scent of blood from his jugular, waiting for the starburst behind his eyes to fade away as Draco grips his cock, hot and tight.
Harry snarls and slams his hands on Robards’ desk, making his boss flinch. He sees Ron shift uncomfortably in his own chair, but for once, ignores his best friend. ‘Where
Harry kicks out a seat opposite Robards, pushes Draco into it, and pushes himself into the other seat. His jaw is clenched, his whole body tense, and Draco trails a soft, calming palm over his forearm. Harry takes a deep breath in, lets Draco’s scent curl comfortingly around him, and focuses back on Robards.
It was only after he’s disappeared through the door that Harry realises he hadn’t scented any fear from Malfoy.
Draco frowns, finally meeting Potter’s gleaming emerald eyes.
And Draco’s lips on his, reverent, as in prayer.
Day 8: Draco x Harry - Comeplay
Harry looked up from his chest, and Draco raised a challenging eyebrow. ‘I’d like that,’ Harry agreed, and Draco’s expression softened. ‘In fact, let’s start tomorrow. Brunch on Diagon? My treat?’
‘Look here, Nott,’ Draco drawled, striding forward and pulling her book away. ‘A little Gryffindor lion, all alone in the stacks.’
Draco groans and Granger smiles wickedly.
Ron is leading them, his red hair messy and his skin pale beneath his freckles. His eyes roam over the three prone bodies, over to Draco, unconscious and limp, and up to Harry. Ron’s eyes flash in sympathy.
A moment later Harry is back in control. He closes his eyes, summons all of his magic, and focuses. He brushes his fingers against Draco’s, letting the magic rush to meet him. His fingertips warm, and Draco gasps lightly as Harry’s magic flows through him.
‘It’s actually been good to talk about this stuff. Ron—’ Harry pauses for a moment, an odd flash of guilt spearing through him at the thought of confiding about Ron’s feelings to Draco. He shakes his head and carries on. ‘I know Ron has always felt a little guilty about what happened, about being my partner for the inspection and walking away fine. I don’t blame him - I don’t blame anyone, the werewolf was half-starved and delirious with pain, they didn’t know what they were doing - but it makes it awkward to talk to him and Hermione about this stuff, sometimes.’
By the time the evening rolls around, Harry is pacing the floor in Buckbeak’s old room, shirtless and sweating, as the wolf roils and growls within. He looks out of the window at the sunset, the soft, innocent shimmer of Auror-strength wards keyed to his wolf form glowing just inside the glass. He physically
Not quite as romantic as it sounds. Rather the aftermath of a messy job with the French Ministry, when they landed back at the safe house and Malfoy, sweaty and dirty and dishevelled, pushed Harry roughly against the wall and kissed him, angry and passionate.
‘Do you mind?’ Hermione said, putting on her swottiest voice and peering over the top of her book. ‘The library is for
Draco watches from across the paddock, filling in the Hungarian Horntail’s details for its annual health check.
Pettigrew waves his wand in ever increasing desperation, as more curses fly towards Harry, as irritating as stinging nettles. Not at all hindered by his lack of a wand, Harry throws up a lazy levitation charm, pulling a chunk of wood from the splintered door to shield against Pettigrew’s heavily telegraphed
? Harry wonders to himself. A good skill for an Auror to have, and one he wouldn’t be surprised to find Malfoy knows. Severus had been his godfather, after all, and no doubt Malfoy had succeeded where Harry hadn’t in Occluding lessons. Malfoy throws Harry his own robes, and Harry catches them, easily, his Seeker reflexes even better now he has wolf blood running in his veins. He sees Malfoy hide an impressed smile, and resists the urge to grin himself.
‘It’s all right, mate,’ Ron said, as they stumble to a halt. ‘I know you start to get irritable this close to the moon.’
‘I earned my Potions Mastery,’ Draco says simply, and Harry almost stumbles to a halt.
? He braces one hand against the cool, wet tiles, and wraps the other around his aching, straining cock.
Draco was always in control, so Harry and Hermione could let go.
Draco’s eyes are almost completely black. They widen when Harry gently nudges into him, feeling the tight ring of muscle give around the head of his cock, and Harry thinks he can probably get lost in the depth of Draco’s lust-dazed eyes for the rest of his life. He takes a deep breath, just the tip of him breaching Draco’s body, and leans down to give him a sweet, lingering kiss. Draco breathes hard into his mouth, his hands scrabbling helplessly over his back and shoulders.
He trails off, and Draco strokes his hair. ‘He certainly is,’ he agrees.
Draco held her waist, anchoring her firmly to his muscled thigh. With a whine, Hermione started to rock against him, feeling her dampness leak onto the rich material of his clothes. It didn’t take long, straddled on Draco, his thigh providing the perfect surface to grind against. Harry had already gotten her so close, and when Draco released her waist to pinch her nipple between his finger and thumb, Hermione’s body went limp, collapsing against Draco, as she came over his thigh, her own legs trembling.
Harry looks up in surprise as Gawain Robards, head of the DMLE, calls out for him. ‘Potter, get in here.’ Robards’ voice, no-nonsense as always, carried across the bullpen from his office. With a sigh, Harry pushes himself to his feet, running a hand hopelessly through his messy hair. He caught Ron’s grimace of sympathy from across the room. A trip to Robards’ office rarely ended with good news.

It wasn’t the first time Draco had forced him into a ruined orgasm, and Hermione was certain it wasn’t going to be the last.
‘Is there anything I can do?’

for Draco, and wishes for the thousandth time he hadn’t told him to leave.
‘Ron’s told me all about you being assigned to work with Malfoy,’ she says darkly as she finally lets him in. She leads the familiar path to the kitchen, looking over her shoulder. ‘How are you coping?’
Draco’s heart stops in his chest, but a fearless figure jumps in front of Charlie, arms raised, and challenges the dragon with an angry hiss.
now. And no one will ever hurt him again.
, love?’
‘Right then,’ Molly said after Hermione and Ron had walked through to the living room to join the others. Her hands were on her hips as she surveyed her kitchen. ‘I think we’re done. We just need to wait for —’ her words were broken off by a clattering of the front door, down the hallway, and a familiar voice calling ‘Mum! I’m home!’
Harry hadn’t seen Draco for about seven years. Not since the final year of Hogwarts, in fact.

‘Draco!’ Charlie swept forward, pushing the others aside, and enveloped Draco into a bear hug, his broadness easily engulfing Draco’s slight frame. He smelled of fire and woodsmoke and the earthy scent that came with working outdoors.
‘Sweetheart?’ Draco whispered.
Potter’s voice is low, warning, as he pushes Draco up against the wall, cheek and chest pressed against the bricks. Potter’s body covers him completely, chest to back. One large hand grips Draco’s waist, holding him still. The other casts a non-verbal Disillusionment over both of them, trickling over the crown of Draco’s head and down his body like ice-water. Potter places his hand flat on the wall, next to Draco’s face, and he can feel Potter’s breath against his hair.
. Go back to the Slytherin common room if you want to gossip like first-years.’
‘Doing what?’ Harry blurts out. They turn the corner into Knockturn, the shopfronts turning dark and grimy. Harry sees the slight movement of Draco’s arm and knows he’s brushing his fingertips along his wand, holstered around his thigh. Knockturn makes Harry feel the same, his hackles rising ever-so-slightly.

‘Harry,
Well, that and the strange case of erotically pushing Draco up against the wall yesterday and
Molly didn’t say a word, just held Draco close and gently stroked his hair until he gave a small cough.
The first time it happens is on his first day.
Potter is huffing and puffing and sighing over his messy desk and his messy paperwork, his green eyes narrowing as he reads through the parchment forms and scrawls his untidy signature across them. Draco holds in his own sigh, working quietly alongside him.
‘Did you catch the Potions special on the Wizarding Wireless last week?’ Molly asked now, waving her wand sharply at a knife on the counter so it burst to life and started frantically chopping up carrots.
Four words from her, and Draco is an awkward teenager again.
And they’re using the
Day 21: Draco x Harry - Overstimulation
Harry took the joint and tossed it onto the table, pushing Draco back against the wall, hard beneath his palms. Harry’s lips hovered a breath away from Draco’s, so close he could practically lick the traces of gillyweed from his mouth.
Draco gives a small laugh, and when he speaks Harry hears the smugness in his voice. ‘
Potioneer. This isn’t an ordinary Wolfsbane, I’ve added a few ingredients of my own. You should find it eases the irritability you’re feeling, as well as tasting a lot better than the usual stuff.’
‘Fuck, Harry.’ Draco moans, throwing his head back so Harry can scrape his teeth along that pale expanse of throat. He breathes in, relishing Draco’s scent, and for a moment the enormity of what they were doing, what they had become to each other, struck him. As the thought hits him, Draco curses and whispers Harry’s name again, desperately pushing back to take Harry even deeper into him. Harry tightens his grip on Draco’s cock as fire races through his veins and he feels a tension deep within him that meant he was seconds away from coming.
For a moment Draco is sure Potter is going to retaliate, and he braces himself for the deluge of his anger. But Potter just sighs, aggressively. ‘Fine,’ he snaps, snatching up his travel mug from the detritus of his desk. ‘Let’s make this as easy as possible. I’m going for another tea. You stay here.’
Chapter 22: Miracle
Feeling horribly impatient, Harry waved a hurried hand over himself and Vanished everything he was wearing. He watched Draco’s face as he stood naked before him, his cock hard and heavy between his legs, leaking steadily. He was rewarded with the further darkening of Draco’s eyes, as they slowly raked down Harry’s body. His pink tongue poked out to lick his lips, the silver flash of the stud taunting Harry.
There is a beat of silence between them, and then Malfoy sighs. ‘You ask two very different questions,’ he says. ‘The Potion hasn’t been improved because there’s no
As Draco looks up at Harry in wonder, his last thought, before he faints, is that maybe he’s already dead, and an avenging angel has come to redeem his meagre life.
Draco didn’t need to see his reflection in the mirror to know he was a monster.
‘And who the fuck are you?’ Harry spits. His gaze slides again to Draco, running up and down his lifeless body as if assuring himself he’s okay, before turning back to the wizard who captured him.
Granger teases him with the magical version first, of course.
After a lifetime of hatred and curses, this was gentle, soft.
‘We weren’t invited to this,’ Harry hisses.
Day 17: Draco x Harry - Public Sex
‘Still so wet for me. There’s a good girl.’
Only then would Blaise tuck him back away, crawl back out from under the covers, and collapse back onto the pillows, finally able to fall into a deep, restful sleep.
mouth…
‘I’ve seen the way you look at me. When you think I don’t notice.’
‘I was in France.’
Hermione sat still and tall at the table, keeping her eyes on the parchments in front of her. It had seemed a good idea at the time, to bring some paperwork home to finish over the weekend, but right now she couldn’t quite remember what she was supposed to be working on.
‘You ready?’
In the end, as long as she was safe in either of her lover’s hands, Hermione was happy.
Malfoy raised one of those wickedly arched eyebrows at him, and crooked a finger in his direction, curling it temptingly towards himself.
‘Malfoy, Jesus!’ Harry’s hands tightened convulsively on the scruffy green towel around his hips, holding it closer to his otherwise-naked body.
Harry doesn’t answer, just pushes Malfoy and kisses him with the same fire they fly with.
Draco listened to the whole tale with a serious expression and thoughtful silver eyes that darkened at all the right moments. Harry found himself opening up about more than he planned, down to describing how irritable the Wolfsbane Potion made him.
For a moment, Neville’s lips are unmoving against his.
He ran his hand along her thigh, the silk of her stockings meeting the silk of her skin. They were fully clothed, a hasty

Harry hadn’t seen Draco for about seven years. Not since the final year of Hogwarts, in fact.

Draco is almost dizzy with lust, and whimpers helplessly as Potter claims his mouth once more, with an urgent, passionate fury.
Draco watches, unnoticed, as the woman at the bar serves Harry. He sees the shiver of fear that ripples through her body when Harry isn’t looking, sees the wary way she pushes two full glasses towards him, stopping before he could accidentally brush his fingers against hers as he took them. Harry drops some Muggle money on the counter, and the look of relief on her face as she snatches it up and turns her back on him makes Draco want to jump over the bar and shake some sense into her.
?!, Harry thought desperately to himself, the sweat starting to prickle on the back of his neck - had no such compunction.
The words burst free from Harry before he could even think of stopping them.
‘Don’t you dare, you
notice that happening,’ he teases, and Charlie groans and kisses his lover’s neck.
‘Want us to come with you?’
‘Wouldn’t want that to happen, would we?’ Malfoy says quietly in return, and Harry allows himself to laugh shortly in response.
