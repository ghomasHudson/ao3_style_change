Hearing this , Draco felt in a daze thinking about what to do now. It was fortunate that he was able to fill everything he and Harry had inside his pouch .
"I assume that all of you know the unforgivable curses, don't you? Last time we learnt the imperious curse. And since you all seemed to enjoy that class, so today we will learn ….. the cruciatus"
Seriously, it was absolutely true when they warned that love killed men !
"Tsk. Such a spoilt brat.  Fine ! I vow on the sky above, earth below, air around and magic within that what I said is as true as the blue of sky and the power of magic. If I said even a word false, may my soul tear in a thousand piece and disappear completely to punish my insolence !", The voice said echoing around.
" Come on. It's already morning, we have classes "  he said while handing Draco a glass of water.
Draco's thoughts were frantic but still quick and precise,
It was a plea. Draco was begging. He was doing this to keep the last ounce of self respect he had. Anymore and Draco would break entirely. He had suffered days of torture and tens of crucios at the hands of dark lord but never had he come so close to breaking, to giving up. But now , the cracks on his soul were widening, increasing. Draco was on the edge of losing sanity.
" Right now, there is only one target the dark side has left after Dumbledore's death "
" Indirect apartion ? How-? You can't possibly be joking right ?"
Why doesn't anyone look at him?! She worked so hard to come out to them and they won't even hug her?! No! This won't do!
explained .
This day was much more hectic and tiring for Draco and combining the lack of sleep his condition was terrible. Draco looked up from his plate to spot Potter absolutely healthy and  bright .
With a mischievous glint , he said to Draco ," Of course , little descendant . After all ,  I am far too old . One can be quite forgetful in old-age , needing a little descendant to take care of him . Ahh , little descendant , forgive this oldman , I will let you be the responsible one.  I am very grateful for your care , little one . "
(See the end of the chapter for
He didn't know if this test was a blessed pleasure  or a painful torture . Harry was fortunate to have a glimpse of what he always wished for but mournful that he will never have it . It was somewhat like how he felt towards Draco , he saw bits and pieces of that incredible puzzle but will never see what the whole picture will look like . It was torturous .
Harry said as he grabbed a slim and pale ankle to pull the unwilling man .
Both of them set out , walking towards the nearest bus stand to take a bus to Islington.
The dried and shriveled hand of Dementors tried to reach them through the thin gaps in the lift doors and they pressed back as if burnt by fire.
" AHHHHHHH !!!!!!!!"
He distributed the objects one by one. The snitch to Harry, the deluminator to Ron and the book to Hermione, before saying, "Dumbledore left these for three of you in his will"
Perceiving something was wrong, He looked around slowly till his gaze landed on a frame kept on the table beside them. The picture was of a golden haired and smiling young man.
"Then go die, why don't you ?! "
The time for breakfast was already over , going there was not possible . Thinking about breakfast , Draco felt something in his heart as if a child was pitifuly pulling his clothes and he instinctively knew it was their eggie doing it because he was very hungry . Feeling guilty , he hurriedly took out the big egg . Taking Harry's hand , he gave a hard bite and kept it on the egg and followed by biting his own to keep it on the egg as well.
That night Harry ate till his stomach was bulging . He could never get enough of this taste . And he also understood what master meant by ' keep walking' . There was a door right next to the couch . Harry could always see it but it seemed to be invisible to his parents . He knew that walking through it will break the illusion . But he was still reluctant to do it .
Draco was about to call ' respected ancestor' again when he remembered the fresh scar that the humiliation left and said fumingly instead ," What do I call you ?"
Harry didn't stop. The force increased steadily. Ron's face was turning blue. Hermione and Neville were frantic but didn't dare come forward . The Slytherins looked bothered as well.
Such dirty people ! Doing such immoral amd dirty deeds ! That too early in the morning ! And with four people together ! And by the looks and age , all of them might already be married and with kids !!
Emerald eyes gleamed darkly, reflecting the pale figure scrambling to get out of bed. And before Draco could know what was happening, strong hands forcefully pulled him back on the bed, grasping his elbow with a frighteningly tight grip. He tried to pull back and struggled fiercely, all the while his other hand searched for his wand.
A shining silver mist poured out of Harry's wand and the Dementors flew back in fright. This gave the lift enough time to move.
"You truly can ?" Sure enough. After hearing his tone, Harry tacitly decided to talk freely this time. Not trying to hide anything. This is an obvious acceptance of the teaching. Therefore, it's also a silent acceptance of his proposition.
That night Draco dreamt that he was in a very huge cave with a mighty black lion . The lion confined him there and he did not move because of the fear he had for it . Everyday the lion brought him different types of fruit and berries . Days passed like this and nothing happened , the lion did not eat him and Draco steadily grew into a fat, round, jiggly vanilla pudding . His cheeks grew round and rosy , his skin grew a healthy pale . He thought that if the lion was always like this then he wouldn't mind staying with him . After all , he just wished for a truthful friend . But then , one day this thoughts changed . That day after the lion came back , he slowly walked to Draco . Draco was scared but he thought that it wouldn't do anything to him after being so good to him for such a long time . But then it stopped right in front of Draco's face with it's snout touching his nose and opened it's mouth wide . Draco could see all its big sharp teeth and smell it's horrid breath . It was then that he realised that the lion did not want a friend but a fat , healthy and bulky prey to fill his stomach !!! He was only a very luxurious Delish which the lion made a lot of effort , time and patience in preparing !!!! He was a sheep fattented for slaughter!!! Now Draco could see inside the lion's mouth as it closed its mouth over the Draco's head . And -SNAP !!!!
With a sigh , Harry turned to Hermione as she  closed her book and smacked Ron with it , immediately waking the boy . Ron shot up and looked at Hermione .
He got up and went out to soon return with a tub filled with warm water, a soft towel and a soft swaddle cloth.
Draco's brows relaxed. He knew that Kreacher won't betray the Blacks no matter what.
Harry asked again, softly this time " What happened?"
So here's the chapter !
The same excitement wasn't returned by Luar, instead his eyes lowered with melancholy.
The tent which was seconds ago their castle of happiness , collapsed like tumbling blocks.
Several heads immediately turned to him. Ron was the first to ask, "Is this related to the vision you saw?"
By the look Kreacher was giving him , his plan had worked and succeeded. To seal the effect in stone , he gave the elf a small comforting smile as well.
The hell has already descended, it seems.
Saying this, Draco totally forgot the matter about eggie's appetite and started to pack their belongings as well. Thinking about their journey ahead , he felt that something was missing.
Opening his eyes , Draco looked at Harry . The egg was acting very peculiarly . It was actively absorbing all of his magic . No matter how much Draco supplied . Sighing , he silently called out in his head ," papa , Can you help me with this ?"
Draco felt a pair of hands circle him. Stunned, Draco instinctively struggled and the force increased, squashing him. Unable to move anymore, Draco gave up on getting free and focused on getting air .
" Oh no . If he wants to die then who are we to stop. Let the Wizarding world see Dumbledore die but he will still be alive in the basement of a certain school. "
Why did he do it ? Why did he save Harry afterall of what he had suffered? Why? He was long past the stage when he worshipped Harry and even defied the dark lord for his sake. Now he did not feel anything for him.
Harry said as he lifted his fingers to his mouth for a flesh-tearing bite and immediately placed it over the pristine white shell . His warm blood seeped from the wound and dripped on the egg , who hungrily absorbed it cleanly. All the while Harry made random talks with it about Hogwarts, about how it was growing heavier, bigger and healthy or about Draco. The egg silently listened to its protector as he ate his fill . After having his fill, the egg gave an affectionate nudge to Harry before rolling away to nestle and cuddle beside an asleep Draco who subconsciously tucked an arm around the egg , delicately yet firmly holding it warm in his embrace.
Stopping at the edge of the thick vegetation , Harry turned to Draco .
A giggle echoed as the conversation continued between the young witches as their feet travelled side by side, making the way towards a new future with glowing happiness waiting for them beyond the curtain of darkness.
- super micro Luar/Eloise. It's just the beginning. We will know their story eventually.
Wishing to indulge a little longer , he moved towards them . He did not know if the decision was right or wrong . As he came closer , he drew their attention .
His behaviour was confident and relaxed as if nothing happened but Harry didn't miss the jittery and unsettled gleam in his eyes.
" How much time do we have till the effects wear off ?"
His hands wound around the thin waist , pulling the soft body to himself , draping himself over Draco , covering him entirely.
Draco's head lifted as he looked straight in Harry's eyes, "They aren't my people, they are yours. Naturally, you should be there when I check them so as to avoid future misunderstandings"
Green eyes nonchalantly lifted to the moon, "Doesn't the moon look especially beautiful tonight? It seems a waste if I don't enjoy such sight-"
The black wisp ran here and there in Draco's body, forcing his veins to internally suffer . Luar was chasing it with every ounce of his ability but the thing was very quick and fast to escape.
The light at the end of the hallway was coming from a room , the courtroom. From where they were , they could see a woman sitting in a chair , anxiously looking somewhere before her.
Ron stood up on the seat on the toilet and peered on the stall beside him . Silently hoping for good luck and fortune so as to not see the hairy , fat and disgusting buttocks.
"Well, 10 galleons aren't too much. But still, I don't mind giving out a small gift to a handsome lad such as you.", The shopkeeper chuckled. "Anyway, they seem a little lonely without their family, don't they ?", She pointed at the twin opals in Draco's hand.
Hmphhh! Thinking he can outsmart Draco! Dream on, git !
Green eyes darkened further . Harry barely stopped himself for the sake of not scaring the prey away and picked himself up and about. Soon, Draco had his previous clothes on. No evidence should be left on the site of crime so that even the victim won't know that a crime happened , so that especially the victim didn't know that the crime happened.
Pansy:
Krecher who was behind him softly tried to come forward but was immediately pushed back as dobby continued in one minded focus , " A-and then Dobby saw Kreacher talking with the thief -"
" The news will reach you as soon as it touches my ears." Dumbledore humbled.
,Discarding all the useless and tangled thoughts, he focused on Harry and eggie.
Finishing the water , Draco called ," Potter, I have to tell you something. Will you bear me out ?"
He stopped to further lower his head. His nose buried in the crook of Draco's neck. Breathing in, Harry's head was filled with the clean scent of water and herbs akin to a flowing waterfall surrounded by lush green forest. He smelled inebriating.
When Draco woke up ,he found himself lying on the ground . The man , his ancestor , was sitting beside him , eyes closed  and hands on his chest . Draco slowly sat up and called ," Respected Ancestor ?"
Draco swiftly looked up and was shocked to see Harry rubbing his chest in obvious pain.
All this time under his chains, why did Draco never try to escape ? Why did he not confront Harry? Ask him what he did to deserve this life worse than hell ? Why did he so easily accept his torture? Why did he so readily forgive Harry for violating him? Why?
Minutes passed agonizingly slow before-
Realisation flashed across several pairs of eyes . Harry and Draco looked at each other to see the same gleam of calculations shining on their faces. They effortlessly understood the other as if two bodies but one heart.
-Neville experiencing crucio.
Harry and Draco climbed the bus and took the seats at the end corner . It was true that before this Draco had never been or travelled in such an environment. Yesterday night was his first time dwelling in the muggle world. But his adaptive nature and internal instinct of finding advantages in everything made it easier to adjust.
He could feel his magic shake with Draco's every wail. He had questioned himself if this was a farce staged to trap him or not. Now, he felt the answer to this question. These tears were not a farce. These emotions, this magic around him swirling with desperation, these were not false. Draco did not change but he was pushed to this point.
Everything was silent . Theo was still in his arms , shivering out of fright. Draco loosens his grip and slowly lifts Theo's small face up. Wiping his tears , he silently rubbed the boy's back , trying to calm him down.
" Then do you have anything else . I don't have any other jewellery . "
"Didn't you ask me
"Yes, yes, I'll listen to Draco. Draco's always right. Draco's amazing."
Theo, who was beside him silently looked at him, replied, "It's already a miracle that he survived"
Harry as the one foremost ahead , said , " When you turned this place over - don't deny it …. You found a locket . Am I right ?"
" I did not know that ! What should we do ?! Should I call Hermione ? She might know what to do ." The worry in his tone was self reflecting.
-Miss Extraordinaire
Hearing him, Neville looked up to see a face frowning with worry, confusion and guilt. A look at the emotions in Blaise's eyes and Neville wailed louder.
Without even turning his face , he knew that it was Potter.
Wavy black hair shone in the setting sun rays of pastel yellow, pink, orange, red and purple and the figure , a woman by her body shape clad in a neat sweater along with the black skirt, turned around.
Trying to walk down from them , his steps faltered and he was about to fall when strong hands wrapped around his waist , steading him . The hands were muscled and the shoulders were broad . The chest seemed reliable and the person himself felt like safety .
Harry's eyes shined maniacally as the others lips twitched with the gentle brush of his breath . The beast was too maddened to be stopped now. A pair of lips covered another , entirely devouring the sweet nectar they hid behind. Wet noises and soft mewls echoed in the space. Harry's tongue vigorously explored the wet craven of Draco's mouth . His eyes closed as he tasted with all his body the entirety of Draco's existence.
Harry hesitantly followed her after giving Draco a silent look, telling him to stay put. This witch didn't seem normal. It was better if Draco remained as far from her as possible.
No one asked him about his stay at the infirmary. It was an unspoken rule between the Slytherins that privacy is above all. Being in Slytherin was automatically swearing loyalty to your group and peers. If one goes down, all go down with him. If one rises up, he pulls the rest with him.
"An urgent Christmas gift, I assume?", The witch questioned but there was a surety present in her voice. She sounded like she was very certain but still attached the "-is it?" for the sake of politeness.
Age.        - 16yrs
It was before curfew yesterday in the hallway that he encountered professor McGonagall , who told him that his presence was especially requested by headmaster Dumbledore at midnight.
Looking at Harry in such agony, Draco desperately through,
" Yes , little one "
When he again lifted his face , the smile remained but the glassy shine was gone .
"The golden warrior ? Who ?", Harry asked with a confused voice while scratching his head.
" Would you please tell the court from which witch or wizard you have taken this wand from ? "
Please look forward to the next chapter !
Well , how can you take a sweet shy boy and overall Draco's small pampered sworn brother out on a suicide mission ?
Six wands slowly raised up, their tips touching one another. As pansy spoke with clear and sonorous pronounciation , " Do you , the ones present here, make an undying oath on your magic to be loyal and never betray our guides and benefactors, Harry James Potter and Draco Lucius Malfoy, as well as each other for today, tomorrow and forever henceforth? "
The surety in these words made an instant answer flow from Draco, " How do you know ?! I have done things that would shock you ! "
Draco tried with all his might to forcefully stop the poison from flowing but with it the blood flow will stop as well.
His father stepped forward and shook Mr. Weasley's hand and bid their goodbyes .
Hearing these words Neville stilled. His mind was stumped for several moments before a look of indescribable anger rose on his face. And just like this the beautiful atmosphere was completely destroyed and Blaise literally threw a hammer on his own leg.
He quietly asked Hermione, " Are those ?"
Ron's eyes were wide in disbelief. How could he ? Ron was his best friend ! How could he do this to Ron for a despicable Slytherin !?! Looking up , Ron saw Harry's stony face . It held no remorse , no apology and no pity. All because of that slimy git ! It was that Malfoy who did this?! He surely hexed Harry !!! How dare he ?!
- and , our Harry being a tease and Draco getting teased
" Ahhh~ ever so perceptive , aren't you ?" ; Whispered Harry . He wanted Malfoy to remember this fear. Wanted him to remember what Harry could do to his life . But no matter how much he reminded , Malfoy always forgot . Such was the anatomy of Draco Malfoy , the threat was remembered but the fear it brought forgotten . The calamity was lost but the disaster it bought always stayed behind . But it didn't matter , Harry will keep on reminding him .
-  due to the attack , dobby gets injured.
A broken hiss escaped Draco's throat, furious and unforgiving , " I hate you ! I fucking hate you ! I swear, Potter, I am going to skin you and feed you to dogs ! I hate you! Get lost ! You mutt ! You-you ….!"
Now seated, Dumbledore asked without reservation, " Harry , show me the pensive"
Draco's expression eased slightly as he said, "Good"
"Do you have any idea about what's inside ?"
Draco saw the self satisfied smirk on Harry and finally felt  a very bad premonition in his heart. It felt as if he was slowly, unknowingly leered into a trap to be eaten whole. It was better to keep his distance from Harry. He's not as simple as before. Draco's instincts were on full edge and more so was his magic. Everything in his body was telling him to run. So, he grabbed a confused Blaise and dazed Pansy and walked as fast and as calmly as was required for a pureblood young master while dragging his dumb struck friends with both hands. But He could feel the gaze all the way through.
He said in a nonchalant voice, "Professor, It is very unprofessional to damage your student's goods, don't you know?" His eyes were still cold and unfeeling with just slight aggravation similar to a child whose favorite toy had been damaged. "What if he breaks? I still haven't played enough, you know."
Harry's wand raised swiftly and Draco shouted, "Wait, you maniac !" As he rushed to Harry.
Harry thought.
" Okay"
That night, as everyone went to sleep with a passive lingering worry in their minds, Harry silently stepped out of his tent. His footsteps were tender, mindful of his sleeping companions.
Blaise let his palm rest on the chubby cheeks, "Did anyone say anything to you?"
In this chapter ,
Getting into the elevator, the doors were about to close after them , when an old grey haired man stopped it before saying, "Cattermole !"
" I do ", the reply was instantaneous.
It was then that Luar , sensing the disturbance , woke up from his sleep and immediately knew something was wrong .
Raising an eyebrow , He looked down at a similarly confused Malfoy looking around . He had not wished for anything thus it must've been Malfoy's wish for this room to appear . Still , to feign surprise is too much of an anomaly . Harry exclaimed in his thoughts
Draco was still unconscious in his arms. His body lax and pliant, depending on him for support. His breath steadied and deepened as he fell into a bottomless sleep.
- The second appearance of their egg son.
The sneer on his face and tension radiated by his whole body made it difficult to tell if it was fear, anger, unwillingness or guilt flooding his heart.
He recognized.
Harry wandlessly pulled the floating egg to himself catching it in his arms before walking to bed and keeping it there again.
"HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW?! I WAS ASLEEP!", Harry exclaimed.
Harry just shrugged and asked in a voice dripping with sarcasm  ," You know you have to ask permission before free loading at someone's place ?"
His eyes darting towards the sleeping Theo and unconscious Dobby. In the time Kreacher was gone, Draco had already healed Dobby's major injuries.
Professor Slughorn opened his eyes wide scanning Harry and moved to look at Draco. Finally replied ," Harry , I cannot let you out of the school grounds at such an hour !"
It was a prize to him. It had always been . From the first time he met Harry at Madam Malkins to their years at Hogwards till now.
Simultaneously, Ron said, "What was all that last night, mate? What happened?"
Draco :  ……
At this Harry's eyes widened minutely.
Nagini's poison was rapidly trying to travel down Harry's body as it shuddered in pain.
CRA~CK
No one will realise if he disappeared now.
" Should I call Zambini and Parkinson to take him away ?" The newfound admiration and worry for Draco was not superficial but ran deep in Ron's heart.
The they settled down, Harry said, " Hedwig dropped by yesterday after you fell asleep "
Still no words were heard. The force increased further. Sweat dropped down Ron's forehead . His face turned white due to the pressure on his body . Draco was growing worried. This was going too far. His eyes turned to Harry and soft words were spoken, albeit with an urgency unknown ," Potter , stop "
" Like what ? Do you mean when i say bound for -"
As they walked out , and seamlessly blended in the crowd, Harry looked at his side towards Draco and moved forward to tightly hold his hands.
Instantly, a number of stabs were splayed across Draco's body as he flew back to collide with the headboard.
His body shook in the fear of unknown danger as he felt the now unconcealed steps of someone walking around him to stand close to his face. He wanted to close his eyes but even they were completely frozen. He could only watch as a pair of hazel-green eyes glowed, slowly coming closer to him.
Harry looked at it and finally he turned to his parents and softly said ," Mom"
"Ahhh~ My heart !", Harry muttered with a groan as he rubbed the warm flesh of his chest right above his heart. But this did nothing to relieve the pleasurable sting and ecstatic pain thrumming there.
Harry woke up before the first ray of the sun. The sensation of a warm body in his arms made a happy smile light his face. Draco's eyes were tightly closed. The curly blond tresses formed tiny shadows beneath his eyes. The breaths were slow and deep.
Not so gleefully afterall .
Harry slowly drew back but kept his hands unmoving on Draco's waist . When he saw the glassy tears in Draco's eyes, an erratic jolt ran through his body. With the apology on the tip of his tongue, Harry also felt a sense of intense possessiveness.
But no….
His mother and elder twin brothers standing beside him, smiling at the newly wed couple . While his father danced happily with his precious daughter.
Malfoy was stiff as a rock . Harry , satisfied with his demonstration , smiled shallowly . His threat firmly grounded in Malfoy's skin , his nerves and memory .
Seeing Harry's face restore a bit of colour, Draco used the last of his power and gentle blue magic flew around Harry, stabilizing his condition.
Turning to Harry , the Headmaster requested," I cannot do this alone. Again , I must ask you for this sacrifice, Harry "
Seeing his second death near , Luar hurriedly said , wanting to divert Draco's attention ," Do you have something you always carry with you ? Maybe  jewellery ? I can't go out like this . I will be visible to everyone . I need something to hide ."
"SECTUMSEMPRA ! SECTUMSEMPRA! SECTUMSEMPRA!...."
But before he could do anything, the quick flick of wand and sound of spelling sounded, " Expelliarmus!! "
Like all of it  , like some , hate some or hate all ? Comment below !
Draco blinked in confusion, " What?"
The moon was up and the whole gryffindor dormitory was asleep. Getting out of bed Neville stealthily walked towards the makeshift bed on the floor Ron was asleep on . Shaking his shoulders , he whispered, "Ron , Get up . We have to go. It's already midnight"
This was the perfect chance. He knew that his family would be alright and protected. His father will never leave any option for that to happen and all his brothers were here as well. He knew that no matter what, they would be alright.
- Draco's parental instincts
Hermione sat beside the weak but conscious Pansy in the tent. They had quickly transferred Harry and Pansy in the two available tents. While Draco looked after Harry in the next tent, Hermione was asked by him to look after Pansy. Even if Draco didn't ask her, she would have come by herself anyway.
Draco's hand did not stop, did not rest. Two tight fists were still hitting Harry's back. A tired sound spilled from Draco's mouth, " Let me go ! I am going to beat you into a pulp ! Ugh ! Let me go !!"
It just took a piece of her heart and a warmth encompassing her to straighten herself while still bearing the weight, willingly bearing the weight, to join her perfect melody and making it a little imperfect , intertwining them both to make an infinitely beautiful symphony .
With wide eyes, he shouted with utmost shock,
Ron : " oh yeah… I don't have a wife "
"Hmm " ; replied Malfoy as he again closed his eyes and Harry could already feel his magic surrounding the egg .
Draco stopped in front of the bright store, his breath panting from the short run. Years of excellent academics, perfect manners and noble upbringing gave him not only a deadly seductive poise like a cold flame, but also a body weaker than the rest of his age. Right now, It can be said that without magic, Draco had nothing other than his beauty and brain.
(See the end of the chapter for
His mom looked shocked , then slowly the shock melted away to a tearful smile .
Without even lifting his head, Harry said in a rough voice," Even I have limits. Don't try to cross them. You won't be safe, Malfoy, especially you. "
It soon came to their notice that Harry was nowhere to be found as well. Hermione had quickly sent the elves and the boys to search the forest around while she stayed back with Pansy.
Dobby simultaneously climbed on the long table followers by Kreacher behind him as his said , " Dobby was only trying to help. Dobby saw Kreacher in Diagon alley which Dobby thought was….curious . And-and then Dobby heard Kreacher mention Harry Potter's name "
" The night of the red moon…." Draco whispered to himself the look of intense inner probing and wondering clear on his face.
The letters entailed about the situation and observations everyone has made. Accordingly, Pansy and Theo are already out and on their way, it seems. While the other two need some more time to sort things up. They might probably be on their way already.
An icy scowl decorated Draco's . With a swish of his sleeve , he hurried forward with angry steps. And a chuckling Harry followed behind with a much more leisure pace.
From behind him, Pansy came inside holding eggie in her arms. She didn't know what was the matter with this huge egg but instinctively knew that Draco and Harry both cared about it. So, she generously helped them bring it inside.
George looked at Harry and took out some objects from his bag. A book, a golden snitch and a small device. On further examination, Harry realised that the book was one of the old editions of Tales of beedle the bard and that the small device was actually a deluminator.
- Draco gives kreachure the fake locket of Slytherin as a memorial of regulus.
" That's good. Here breakfast ", Harry said, placing the tray in Draco's lap while simultaneously sitting beside him as well.
The oppressive and possessive love suffocated her. She couldn't even imagine what Harry would do if someone even tried to take Draco away from him.
Noted Harry .
And Harry followed behind without a single suspicion.
Coming to stop in front of the cave mouth , Harry could hear slight grunts and shuddering breaths from the inside. Something told him that he needed to go in, even if his brain was screaming no.
A chuckle made its way into Draco's ear ," No . It didn't. Don't worry and you already healed me "
- Harry's expression of worry for Draco
The pieces flew in all directions as dust flew up, making it unable to see clearly.  The dirt settled and a voice cautiously called out, " Harry ?"
Kreacher slowly looked at Draco and respectfully asked , Kreacher....wants to ….ask Young master ...so~mething. "
- Harry musing about how much he has changed and how much more will he change just because of Draco's love.
" No buts. Who am I ? " , Draco's tone toughed slightly and Theo dutifully answered.
They disappear.
His hand domineeringly came forward to hug Draco into his arms.
" Also , you might have noticed that your magic seems more free and at ease than before ?"
Surely…. Master Harry does not mean that …… or does he ? So if master Harry is master and Mr. Malfoy is also master then Master Harry and Master Draco are….
After saying this , the man sat down and looked at Draco . Draco , understanding what had happened , turned beet red . And for a second the man even thought that he was going to puff his cheeks up . OH , What a sight it would be !!!! . Draco with red puffed cheek and glaring at you , all the while standing in his pajamas !!!!
"So many questions, little Malfoy."
Harry noticed that the train stopped . With a newfound determination , he stood up .
"You are a Malfoy ?!"
An uncertain amount of time passed and Draco was almost dozing off when a startled Headmaster straightened, immediately followed by Harry. Dumbledore stood up and stumbled to retreat some steps back . His face literal materialization of horror.
Neville , who sat in one of the last compartments, felt his chest fill with anger at the sight of the black clad men entering through the door.
" How do you hide in this pin-en-groom ?"
Hello reader ,
Even if they were enemies, Draco remembered his limits, remembered what he should say and what he shouldn't. Then why does Harry say words worse than death to him ? Why does he insult his parents at every word when Draco never even mentioned his in the 10 years they have known and fought each other ?
" How many ?" He heard a whispered voice ask.
Behind him Harry's voice called, "Hey! Where are you going? I am still sick! Check me some more! What if something happened to me?! What are you going to do then ?!"
Draco gently nodded his head , his eyes lingering on the soft smile Harry gave him.  Harry was really handsome . His eyes twinkled when he smiled and it was as if they were drawing him in , trapping him there.
Standing in front of the store, Draco noticed that while the entire town has a cheerful atmosphere, this shop shines particularly different because of its introverted but gentle air. But at the same time, these qualities also made it look hidden and unnoticed.
The snake was immediately uncoiled from Harry's body. He swiftly took this chance to escape and shouted, "Stop ! Quickly come behind me !"
Draco's hands instinctively wrapped around Theo , protecting him. As the green light neared , Draco had only one last thought that was to somehow get Theo and Dobby out of here.
Harry frowned as well and nodded. A child shouldn't stay wet and naked for long in such weather. This much he knew as well.
Creeping behind him, Harry said in ear," Good afternoon sir"
Standing in front of the door , he gripped the knob . Just as he was about to open the door , a hand gripped his wrist . He turned and saw his mother , tearfully looking at him .
A tinge of pity struck in Draco's heart. Before he could stop, words were already flowing through his tongue, "It's already Christmas, huh ?"
The ministry road was as busy as ever . Men and women walked by in stiff suits and  perfect fair . Their blankest expression ready to be seen as they walk .
Harry looked at the boy beside him and sorrowfully noted the dark circles and tiredness on his face. He slowly sat up and said, "Wait here for a second. I'll be back"
"Why did you bring me here?",  He asked, not willing to look at the Slytherin.
But the aurors remained cold and unresponsive. What a time it was. The aurors trained to protect the people were the ones delivering them to their deaths. But what choice did they have ? If refused , they'll be killed instead.
Dumbledore's words, Harry noticed, held a hint of relief. The only conclusion he believed possible was that Dumbledore knew about Draco's emotional state but didn't know what to do , so he chose to wait for either Draco or fate.
-a mystery involving Draco's mom narcisss which is known by Kreacher .
- Harry and Draco reaching the 12 grimmuald place i.e. the black manor to pansy , Theo , Ron and Hermione already waiting for them.

As Harry sat beside Draco , gazing at his sleeping form, He himself felt his exhaustion creeping up on him. The past months have been hectic for him. Not to mention that the magic he used that day at the astronomy tower was immense and still hasn't recovered. Over that, aparating a distance as large as he did tonight is quite tiring as well. A good sleep with a warm and soft Draco in his arms can never feel better , it will only feel the absolute best.
Neville's shoulders stiffened under the steady smile. At the same time, the forest green eyes of a Slytherin boy, sitting at the back of the class, darkened.
The person , a fat middle aged man , said in surprise, " Albert ? "
And suddenly, a year's long misconception and misunderstanding broke. Hermione finally saw that just because the books say that Slytherins are vicious doesn't mean they actually are. Everything and everyone has exceptions and conditions for doing and being something.
The man sighed defeatedly ," Fine"
" Yes "
The Patronus hadn't even fully taken shape before it moved in a hurry to pass through the small hole in the barriers. The Patronus exited as the hole closed.
In this chapter :-
Together, they walked out of the tent to spot Theo dossing off with his head on Pansy's lap as she slowly stroked his hair.
Hmmm….let's see…
Still scanning the shelves, he nonchalantly answered, "Yes"
Harry looked at Ron from the corner of his eyes and the fear mingled with firmness and resolution he saw in Ron's face made him feel somewhat proud.
, Harry's heart chilled with this thought. Voldemort can't know Draco is alive. No, he can't let Draco be seen.
Draco looked at Kreacher with screwed brows . He was curious as to what this elf wanted to ask , " Go ahead "
Draco thought.
The breakfast ends and
Harry was silent as he watched the pale fingers retreat.
Huh ? Such a hard question and no way to tell.
(See the end of the chapter for
, is a explosive and incurable condition. Once you get it, you are it.
He took the pale boy in his arms, holding him. Panic was clear in those green eyes.
Harry slowly walked to the bed and seated himself beside the celestial beauty. His eyes were impossibly soft and filled with love. His fingertips brushed against silken platinum strands splayed on the pillow before following their trail to touch the forehead and eventually sliding down to palm the ruddy pale cheeks.
SNAP! - and Harry's brain short circuits. In  frantic hands, he pulled up the comforter , completely wrapping Draco in it and ran outside as if Snape was just behind chasing him. With a thud the door banged close.
Seeing the , Draco worriedly called out ,
- Hermione leaving fromher parents house
A gasp echoed through the dorm .
Dumbledore, in a pleading voice , said, "Severus ..........…..Please "
The baby's expression slowly shifted to comfortable and sleepy as she settled in Draco's familiar yet unfamiliar warmth.
His thoughts took a 180° change after some time. It was positively unnerving and even swallowing the bite in his mouth was difficult. The pressure the stare gave was incredible .
But Harry , naturally knowing when to provoke and when to stay passive so as to tightly grip a sly and slippery minx, didn't reply. Instead he happily made his way to the reception downstairs to request packages of sandwiches and water bottles.
Seeing the slightly darker eyes , Draco , with clear eyes , nodded firmly
A caged canary will always fly away when given the chance. He wants the canary to jump in the cage itself, he wants Draco to willingly become his captive , his possession.
Emerald eyes darkened further as Draco decisively looked away and Harry caught the sight of ears so red that they seemed to be dropping with blood.
Her limbs started losing their strength. Two steps after, she was crawling on the ground trying to keep going when black spots started clouding her vision.
Harry thought as his gaze maped the curves and columns of Draco's throat.
" Hmmm…. You are right " Draco said. The agreement in his voice was conveyed through. A clear innocent look in his eyes as if the first snow of year. Unsullied, untainted.
George and Fred: Young Master ! Please show mercy ! Leave us some face in front of our cutie ! How can we woo him if you keep putting our face in the mud ?! Harry ! Atleast, you are our brother ! Please have mercy on us ! Why should we suffer such injustice because of your fault?! Come fast and coax your darling ! Leaving your darling angry is not a gentleman's behaviour, don't you know ?!
Getting off the bed, he looked at Draco, hand prints on his hips and thighs, bite marks on his neck and chest, Harry's cum mixed with streaks of blood flowing out of his abused hole, his lips swollen and bleeding, his gorgeous face was tear streaked and his enchanting eyes red and glassy.
Harry blew an exasperated sigh, "And I have never been more glad to be in the position. It must have been Yaxley. He followed us through when we apparated"
First of all, I am really sorry for being absent for so long. Hope you guys understand that life isn't alway sunshine and daisies.
It's fine. It's all fine.
With a blast, the snake was thrown off Harry while biting a chunk of bloody meat in its jaw as they disappeared the next second.
The witch slowly leaned forward and whispered in hisses,
" Look Malfoy. Look how hungrily you take my cock. Is this an inherent talent from your mother? Huh, tell me? Or is it your father?"
" Ahhh ! What are you doing ?" , Shouted Harry while holding his hand.
The Silence streched. Dobby who stood there thunderstruck by the revelation finally regained his senses, " Ma-"
Emerald eyes drifted to the wet patch on the sleek black pants . Hands reached forward and as soon as a finger grazed the sensitive skin , a begging breathy whisper called ," Noooo. Don't ! Potter ! Stop ! "
Each and everyone of them understood what this meant.
" okay. "
Walking to him, she stood in front of the bed. Her eyes speaking of immeasurable disgust and anger.
Faced with such stubbornness, Theo suggested that the dinner should just be delivered to their tent if they don't want to come out. Just like this, two portions of dinner were sent to the small tent.
" For helping me with the anger "
Series of footsteps rang in the distance to indicate the incoming company.
The question lingered before Hermione's gaze grew even more despairing,
When Hermione , with a pleading voice, said , " Before that , Can I visit my parents for the last time ?"
Hermione was astonished, "In his will ? But why?"
As Draco ran out, the bashful look in Harry's face faded and a mischievous and scheming smile rose. Blissfully and with a heart filled with sugar , he generously told Jarvis, " Expect a rise in your paycheck this month. "
Sorry !! So how do you like the chapter ? Did you like the scheming Harry ? the fluff? The comedy?
And another thing,
" Hmmm. I agree but you know Malfoy, he hates to take help and does everything himself ", Harry stated as if it was an universal fact known by all.
Harry raised a astonished eyebrow but answered,
Staring into Harry's eyes , Dumbledore finally backed down. Walking out , He gestured for the young men to seat themselves.
Harry's eyes darkened as he said in a voice similar to silence at the bottom of a deep dark sea , captivatingly haunting ," Carefully weigh your words , Malfoy . Once inside other's ears , they always stay there , no matter how much you wish you hadn't delivered them so "
- Dumbledore's comment on drarry duo.
" Is….Young master a s~on of…. Black family ? "
After a few minutes , he drew back and lifted his head to say ," Thank you . Although it is quite weird for Malfoys to give and receive hugs ."
With a satisfied hum , he continued .
How was it ? Spicy ? Sweet ? Or as I say, pure euphoria ?
A teasing smirk lit Harry's face, " Well… how can I not know ? Now that we are bound by magic and oaths, I obviously need to take good care of my companion"
" Harry . How was school ? A good year or not ?" A voice he never heard but always imagined .
Just as he was lost in his head, Harry came back. Urging him to speed up, Harry said, "Come on, Malfoy. We need to empty the room in an hour"
Ron gave them a last smile , mouthing two words that he couldn't do himself before disappearing completely as his wand's magic sucked him in through its tip.
So , we finally started the main arc !!!!!
Draco paused the troubled look on his face clear and he searched for the right word. Angrily glaring at Harry because he knew that no matter what and how he said it , Harry is going to make fun of him either way.
Harry so got the havoc and nervous atmosphere in the Order of Pheonix because of his disappearance. As Harry suddenly disappeared, the order of Pheonix was in a worried tandem but unable to do anything. When Harry read this piece of information in Ron's letter, he had started to make keen calculations in his head. When he realised what he was doing, the shock in his eyes was clear. When had he become like this ? Calculating and scheming ? But when he thought what he had and what he could lose, the shock wore off. Now , Harry had people and family to protect, he had Draco. If scheming and plotting can help him keep his beloved safe, he was naturally willing.
Harry's eyes widened and Draco visibly panicked ," Wait! listen ! I am not insane enough to let my own people die. Even If it means saving the whole lot of you while simultaneously risking death. That's why I am telling you about this. There is a vanishing cabinet in the room of requirements linked to another one at Borgin and Burkes . "
Harry was astonished at the sudden shout and froze completely. His stunned eyes looked up, clear and pure, without an inch of falsehood. It was clear that he really did not know.
Even if she desperately wanted to deceive herself, Hermione knew that she couldn't. In her heart, she knew that-
When George saw the raised wand in his brother's hand, a bad premonition rose in his heart and he wildly started running towards his little brother, shouting at him to stop, to wait . As his words dissolved in the air, going unheard, the bile in his gut rose to his throat. The fear clawing the inside of his stomach.
Pansy: (;ŏ﹏ŏ)
For a second , Harry's hand wavered and his magic crackled as if rethinking their actions, as if correcting their actions. Maybe to stop this horrifying and twisted heat rising in his chest , maybe to make his fantasy into reality.
Turning around, she started making her way back to the camp. Walking some distance, suddenly her chest tightened.
The bread and cheese Draco ate minutes ago were sprinkled with the drops of a powerful sleeping draught, ironically, made by Draco himself. Harry had given this to him because he knew that Draco wouldn't agree to even relax for a second if asked nicely. So he instead took straight action and directly put him to sleep. He knew that his action was cruel and an atrocious disregard of Draco's own will. But the reality that Draco's health will be compromised couldn't be allowed by him. You can't blame him if he wanted his beloved to be well fed and rested either by hook or crook.
"Yes , it's a slave mark , is it not ? It can be removed but it has some conditions and  success is very rare . I cannot tell you much as it is not my area of expertise but I have books regarding it . I can give them to you ."
The sensation was as overwhelming as it was gentle.
Getting no reply , Draco continued , " Last summer when I was at the manor , I saw 7 house elves in total being tortured and killed right before me while I was unable to even object "
Hard punches were raining down on Harry as he caught the pale wrists in a tight grip. Still, the person atop him didn't stop and continued thrashing around, desperately trying to get free.
" Who are you? ", Harry asked the soul.
A frown etched on Draco's face as he put the book in the small magical bag he carried, thinking,
Draco huffed a long breath of relief. The headmaster's condition was stabilized for now but the hope that it would stay so for a while was dim. His hand was still in an infected condition. If it was not remedied soon then it can endanger his life.
A bashful look rose on Harry's face , albeit fake but Draco didn't know that, and he remembered the weird feeling in his chest.
*GASP* A shocked sound was heard from the astonished elf.
Hearing this , Draco's smile blew so wide that it almost reached his ears . He was about to continue when again stopped in his tracks and realised that he did not even know his Papa's name ! Before he was reserved , but now that they are family , it should be fine . So he asked ," Papa , now can you tell me about yourself ?"
"............."
With that, she turned around and disappeared behind the door again.
Draco: "..."
Draco hurriedly changes his clothes behind his bed curtains and left the infirmary. He walked towards the Slytherin dormitory. His mind wandered to the events of last night. He was still not clear if it was reality. The bruises on his arms were throbbing but he did not know if it was just the residual psychic sensation from a weird dream or actual pain.
Opening his eyes, the first thing Draco did was to check his forearm .
Harry stood aside as Draco carefully instructed the house elves about how to care for the headmaster and what medicines to give him. As he finished, Draco made his way towards Harry.
The realisation struck them that what they were witnessing wasn't a simple phenomenon. It was a miracle.
eethu* ! May mother magic punish this liar with a hundred lightning bolts ! Such shamelessness will make his ancestors sit up in their graves !!!
Everyone else: "..."
When Neville woke up, it was already night. The green colour of the sheets and the blankets brought an indescribable calm to him.
(See the end of the chapter for
- Harry and the gang will steal the locket and escape.
Harry stood alone in the desolate, snow-covered graveyard. In front of him was a simple tombstone. The engravings read -
Wind ? This is an enclosed space , there should be no wind .
There was a reason why Draco never asked for  help, why he never pursued friendship with people not connected to Voldemort, why he made an enemy of Harry even after growing out of his immaturity. And he was not going to change that anytime soon. Draco was bound in one way or another to all of this that was happening. And he knew that if he kept going the same, he was going to end up in tragedy, if he wanted or not, possibly even lose everything. The only way to be safe was to somehow cut all the connections he had with Voldemort. It seemed almost impossible but he was going to try. He wasn't going to give up just like that.
- Harry revealing his plan to visit the Godric's Valley with a twist.
Dumbledore did not give up and further probed," I have also heard that Miss Weasley is a known company to you . Perhaps-? "
Draco found himself dropping outside the Slytherin dormitory and barely managed to steady himself . Looking around for any presence but finding none , he concluded that it must be the early hours of the day .
Some time went by while Draco lingered in his head, thinking,  before saying again.
Well , it wasn't everyday you get the golden boy as your stalker !!! Draco swore that it was a medal worthy feat !!!!
Draco sat there, wondering about the manor, about Hogward's and his mother. Minutes passed and suddenly, he felt a weight on his lap. Looking down, he saw a plate filled with simple bread and cheese in it.
"Crucio!"
The atmosphere was solemn . Everyone was glad and worried in their own head . Draco scanned all the six faces. These faces were young , they were still children. But then again, so was he .
- Ron's view change towards Draco .
She looked at the herbs on her body and looked back up . Her eyes turned from wary to confused and to grateful as realisation dawned on her .
Terse nods were seen through the room as Harry silently scanned and pried into them through their eyes, searching for the effect and importance of his words. Confirming that his words were inched deep in their bones, Harry looked at the still standing Draco and softly grazed the pale knuckles with his fingertips before gently pulling him down to sit beside him.
" Draco ! My child , What brings you here today ? I must say that I wasn't expecting this visit but am very glad that you came"
Green eyes gazed into cold and seething silver ones . Harry's voice dropped an octave , becoming a dark lure , an enchanting seduction, " Like what ?"
The man raised an eyebrow and said ," Tired of 'respected ancestor' , are we ? It truly was a mouthful , wasn't it ?"
Without wasting time, Harry ran to the origin of it to reach a cabinet. With a flick of his wand , the wooden door was slammed open and the being inside restrained tightly , unable to escape.
A second passed and the one person still inside the desolated house disappeared as well, making it seem dark and haunted
Neville : ….....…
Harry felt that if they were going to use corrosives, why not directly use the most effective ones, in their case, the most deadly ones ?
" I don't know what you are talking about , Potter "
Sporting a worried look , Draco frowned ," well , I have my Malfoy ring ."
Another thing Draco noticed was that  it did not distinguish between light and dark magic . It was all in there and it was all helpful . It seems people from ancient times did not differentiate between dark and light magic . It was all the same to them .
"Yes ?" Harry was no stranger to tests . He had gone through plenty under Dumbledore's hand . Not finding it odd , he remained surprisingly calmy . But he would have liked a warning.
Draco's voice exclaimed, " Pansy ! What have you done to her ?!"  ; But he didn't make a move to do anything, keeping completely still other than his eyes glaring at the twin boys.
Muffled gasps rang out as the surrounding students watched with terror in their veins, all of them dreading what will happen to the boy now.
Harry's wand slowly lowered and his magic gradually retraced back to his body. Draco followed behind to lower his wand and briskly swept forward to take Pansy in his arms.
" Let me guess . It has a sister , a twin , doesn't it ?"
And then quickly made her way to the woods with legs tightly squeezed together. With her thighs stuck together tightly, she couldn't even take a step wider than 10cm. And truthfully, in her condition, taking a step wider than 5cm didn't seem safe in any way or form. Her face contorted an expression conveying  something akin to pain and desperation.
Harry looked at both of them and again silently tucked the covers over the egg as well , before resting in his own bed to soundlessly drift in a shallow and aware sleep. He slept with one eye open . In such times, Who knows when the misfortune approaches ? He had people to look after and his beloved to protect. Tardiness wasn't something he could afford right now.
Phew !! this chapter was heavy one ! This chapter is plot point of view very important and has almost entirely the original storyline .
Son , as you know that these days are difficult for everyone , including us . The dark clouds are drawing near and the rain is about to fall . We cannot stop the rain but I hope that you at least have a safe shelter over your head . You don't have to worry about me , I will be fine . But please make sure that you are fine as well . You are my son. If you aren't there, I won't be as well.
My first cliff hanger !! How did you think I portrayed the intense scene? Did it feel overwhelming emotion ?
Pansy curiously looked at how Harry handled the egg. She had thought that the egg might be of a magical creature which Potter and Draco took a fancy to. But now she wasn't so sure.
When Draco finally came down with the huge bag , Harry was standing near the door, waiting for Draco's arrival.
The weather was freezing. Their feet walking cautiously on the slippery pavement beneath. The cottages on either side were alight with colourful decorations and the distant sound of Christmas Corals were floating in the air beside the delicate snowflakes. The atmosphere was warm and festive.
If this is what her brother wanted then who's she to stop and make things difficult for him. She could only give a warning which she did.
Draco's eyes focusing on the ring . What did it have to harm the Headmaster as such ?
Fed up with it, Draco rebuked at harshly, " Stop ! "
" Quit flattering, Potter."
- The first meet of Neville and Blaise!!!!
As soon Harry heard
Headmaster readily replied ," Exactly , but magic especially dark magic -"
Fate makes you lose a gem because it wants you to find a treasure.
A light tap was felt from inside the shell.
Draco's eyes widened as he looked at him . Then thinking how his own father was , it wasn't wrong thinking that he had never received even a touch of fraternal love .
After Harry left , Ron turned to Hermione and asked ," He had two vials of Liquid luck ?"
As he was lost in his thought, the sound of the back door in the kitchen opening reached their ears. Everyone in the house and them as well made their way towards it.
With a steady hand he opened the door. A shriek laughter rang out as Bellatrix came out. The joy on her face was maniacally merry.
A look of realisation flashed through his eyes as the man said ," Ahh , that must be my negligence . Do they not teach you the basics of healing anymore ? Who is your master boy ? Did he not teach you basic healing ? "
The ache was so strong that it made him unable to answer. All the people in his around, except Pansy, surrounded his hunched form.
Draco's brows frowned, " Is it that difficult?"
- the relationship between Draco and Theo
Blaise looked at the charm of innocence on the face in front of him and a sigh escaped from his lungs, "Have you heard the saying that half of the child's fate is written by the parents? My mother had seven husbands and innumerable lovers. As her son in flesh and blood, how can I be any different? People assume things and sometimes, I find that just agreeing to their assumptions is much safer rather than fighting them."
" You used the cloning spell ??" He whispered , scandalized.
Draco ,who didn't care about the argument and was looking after Pansy, ran to them as soon as he heard the exclamation. His brows frowned in worry as he sat down beside Harry.
" Come on, thrust your hips" he commanded.
" Something almost seems suspicious, doesn't it ?" Draco asked registering the information income.
Draco looked on as Harry carefully climbed the rickety stairs before disappearing from his sight. His gaze slowly turned and inspected the messy abode. As he roamed around, Draco came across a dusty book kept on a tabletop. The book's cover clearly stated-
"AHH! WHAT IS THAT?!"
The elf's head dropped in illogical shame, but this is how house elves were. They put the care of their master first before everything else and will feel responsible even if the fault is not theirs.
Kreacher immediately focused on Draco leaving Dobby behind, " yes , Young Master "
" All of them are fine . Other than property destruction, few people were actually injured "
Walking through the deserted stone hallways of the castle , Harry made his way into the headmasters office . Entering he saw Dumbledore sitting behind his desk , kindly and keenly waiting for Harry .
Harry gave a pained groan as he sat up as well, mocking under his breath, "Well, Blame me for being too handsome that it made bees and butterflies and Slytherin Ice Princes stick to me like glue"
Harry who was observing from the sidelines, pulled Draco closer, saying," I actually got Slughorn's memories "  While like a stumbling doll, Draco fell right into his chest.
Blaise hummed, stroking Neville's brows drenched in cold sweat, "Don't worry, professor. I won't neglect my studies in the favour of leisure enjoyment."
How will Harry let his beloved be unlucky when fortune , fate and destiny bowed at his feet since the day he was born ?
Seeing Draco's gaze stop , Luar asked ," Do you like this ? I have to say this will definitely look good on you . It's not too gaudy and can be used daily . Do you choose this one ?"
A look of agreement flashed in six pairs of eyes as they silently looked for the orders with determined eyes.
Draco silently lifted his head from the bunch of vials in his lap and looked towards the direction Pansy was pointing.
" What should we do about the assassination ?"
Looking around , Draco was surprised to see the thick canopy of trees and plants . He did not even notice walking into the forbidden forest . By the size of tree trunks they were deep into the forest , possibly right at the center of it . But this was not what caught his attention , it was the slight purple hue on the tree trunks and the leaves of plants that intrigued him . These species of plants are not supposed to develop any kind of hues . Curious , he tries to move forward but was immediately tugged back , entirely plastered against the one and only Harry Potter . Right now he felt like the bread dough made by , Jack , a house elf back at the Malfoy manor . When he made bread , he would tug , turn and sqaush the dough harshly every time as if it was his worst enemy there instead of a dough . He felt the same being manhandled by Potter . But he did not protest and stayed still as Harry cautiously tugged him forwards towards a clearing .
- Some more romance of pansy and Hermione.
Turning his attention back to the book in his hands , he started reading.  According to it , healing was not just about spells and potions . A potent healer should  know everything that harms a wizard and should be able to reverse it as well . That includes curses , spells , physical and mental injuries , mind attacks , legilimens , occlumens , potions , etc . It was a very wide , if not infinite , study . Thus , there can always be a good healer , a miraculous healer but never a perfect healer .
Draco continued ," First we need a pair of you to stay in the school as our intelligence. As for the others will the ones finding the horcruxes "
With his eyes spectacularly pointing towards the other side of the room , Headmaster indicated Harry . It was so obvious that Harry gave Draco a silent look before following , as if saying
" AAHhh !!" a shout sounded beside Draco's ear and he was so startled that his hand subconsciously tightened.
Hearing this Draco was shocked .
His stance was firm and ready to attack. He looked in the slitted eyes of the snake. None of them moved, both standing still like predators in front of prey.
Draco was still in the same position. Still in the bed with his head hung sideways but without tears. His eyes now held a deep resignation. If he suffered then he suffered. If he was raped then he was raped. If he died then he died. It did not matter anymore. He was only a shell now, just a hollow statue.
With sorrow thick in his eyes, Harry slowly said, "This is where they died, Draco."
" Then say “ Big Boss , please tell me ?” and I might"
The shock wore off when he saw the condition Draco was in. He was shuddering and silent tears were falling down his eyes with sweat mixing in. Without thinking twice, Harry rushed towards him. A slight distortion glowed when he crossed the array drawn below.
And Ron convinced himself with difficulty to open his mouth and not vomit but spell words.
Eithu ! Eithu ! Eithu ! Let mother magic punish these dirty and disgusting lecherous people ! No shame they have ! What will their ancestors say ?! What will their children learn from such shamless devils ?!
Theo, who was on the other side of Pansy, was just going to help her with the fish but stopped when he saw this scene. His eyes drifted towards Draco with questions and worry. Alas, Draco could only give him a helpless but assuring look.
The primal lust in Harry's eyes was enchanting and terrifying at the same time. His eyes looked as if cups of sweet emeral poison. His magic , being more honest than himself, slithered to wrap around the slim and shapely limbs and slipped inside the white fabric of his shirt.
" Apologize" Harry called again.
Harry: "..."
" It's easy . Just tie it like a ribbon ."
" Did you help me ?" ; Still holding the egg , she asked . The egg seemed very important to her .
" Awake ? " Harry said, making his way towards the bed to gently sit Draco up.
They had justly decided that the news about their coalition should be essentially informed to their trusted allies as well.
A bright light shone and tendrils of magic wrapped around the six wrists holding the six wands up.
As the last of the space was about to close off, Pansy shouted, " Expecto Patronus !"
" Who came to heal you as soon as he could ?"
The overly excited egg swung itself so wide that it rolled off Draco's thigh, about to fall on the floor.
Sitting at the Slytherin table, Draco saw Harry eating his meal just across from him . With a start, He remembered the new medicine he made . It was a healing pill inspired from a very potent potion recipe he read a while ago . Draco made certain improvements in it so that it impacts all kinds of wounds and makes the healing process quicker. But he did not test it till now so it's efficiency was unknown. And who would be a better guinea pig than the great Potter .
Harry noticed that the soul seemed a bit lost. He was wary. But the wariness was not directed towards him but towards Eloise.
Silence prevailed and no one said anything . There was no agreement or disagreement.
"Potter, wake up !", Draco shouted with fright.
Their faces turned towards Theo to see Draco protectively hovering beside him, looking particularly murderous with bloody hands and holding a blood-stained knife. Their faces turned even uglier and somewhat fearful. It felt that if they weren't careful, it can't take much to replace the fish blood with their own. But still, even though reluctant, they obediently did their work. Otherwise, who knows when big bro Draco will even give them a chance to look at the black-haired cutie? Let alone talk to him ! They still had to woo the little cutie !
In Harry's eyes, Draco looked like a blooming flower in the midst of cold morning fog. The tears on his cheeks were as if the nectared dew drops on pink petals.
Draco calmly looked at Ron and asked,
- we will see Harry's softer side .
The anger in her eyes sent a satisfactory and comfortable feeling through his entire body. This girl was really annoying. Always hanging around Draco like a sticky tail. Touching him here and caressing him there. It wasn't just now, she had been like this since 1st year.
" I did not do anything !!"
" What is it?" Draco asked, now vigilant and focused so as not to miss anything.
The ministry has fallen.
The symphony as well as the fairies from whom it comes. The individual tunes as well as the mixed melody. The fingers who play as well as the heart which conveys.
The woman answered , " I-i did not take it . I got it from Diagon alley , at Ollivanders when I was eleven , like everyone else. It choose me "
But , right now , waiting is the only thing he can do.
Draco was very clear about the budding emotions in Pansy's heart. He had an inkling when Pansy went to pick Hermione up in the muggle London. But his suspicion was confirmed when she took a deadly curse for Hermione. He was very sure about Pansy's feelings but what worried him was Hermione's reaction to these feelings. He didn't want this sister to get hurt for a love who might not even see her that way. This was the general sentiment of every brother towards their sister. Although he was worried, Hermione's behaviour didn't go unnoticed by him. And it seems that there is a possibility of love ….
Before he could continue , a loud sound was heard from the front of the house. Draco was instantly alert and the muscles in his body tightened.
Harry landed on the ground with a thump first and hastily held out his arms to catch Draco as he landed on top of Harry, his whole body protectively curled around the huge egg.
Draco's eyes flashed a calculative gleam as he again assessed Potter from head to toe . It was better not to provoke  him . Draco didn't want any attention to himself right now . Revealing the tip of the iceberg did not seem a bad option if it meant getting Potter's hands and eyes off him . It was seriously scaring him .Looking in his eyes , Draco spoke ," What do you want to know ?"
Aiihhh ! Really hateful ! Really really hateful !
Seconds turned to minutes and minutes turned to hours as the cries stopped and Draco slumped in Harry's embrace, unconscious from exhaustion. He got out of bed and gently laid Draco down, slowly pulling the covers up. Standing at the bedside, he looking at the puffy eyes and wet cheeks. At that moment something rose in Harry's heart. It was dark, cruel and sinister but it wasn't wrong.
So in this chapter I kinda focused on Draco and Harry as individuals and their seperate thoughts and personality since I always write about them as a duo and team.
A hand came forward to painfully squeeze the slender pillar.
" It's fine. Why don't you take a seat and relax yourself " Draco said while motioning to the couches behind them .
Startled, Draco snapped his head towards the voice. His eyes wide after registering Harry. He asked, "What are you doing here, Potter? ", His words were angry but his voice was pained and gruff from the toll he took yesterday. His face into turning into a scowl at the sight of Harry's face.
Draco stilled, " how do you know I like chamomile tea ?"
"Isn't this the book we bought, Hermione?", Fred asked.
Draco hastily moved backward , the chains binded with the cuffs clinking. He was terrified . Not of the pain but of the words. They were the worst at such times. But his fear did nothing other than flame the fire.
"It's okay, Nott. We should leave here as fast as possible anyway."
Draco did not stop and Harry did not leave. Both too lost, too in pain to even think about letting go of the only anchor present.
" WHAT ?!" Sputtered Ron. Shock and confusion clear on his face.
"Look , brat . This is a test , an exam . And an extremely difficult one at that . Many people have died inhere because they gave up in the middle of it . If you want to be a warrior , you have to go through it , have to stand in the face of death without flinching . No one knows what it actually is . It's different for everyone . And this is just the start . The future will be worse . So , I ask you for the last time . Do you still wish to do this ? "
The voice said,
" There's something wrong with them . You briefly read about soul connections , didn't you ? There is something strange with your parental soul connections . Which is quite baffling . Tell me Draco . Do your parents pay attention to you ?"
The two soon disappeared in the hustle of the street, leaving no traces that they were there.
Harry hissed as he kept rubbing his chest, a crazed look shining in his eyes.
The fleshy pointed ears of the old elf flapped as he tilted his head to the side and spat with such hatred and resentment that Harry thought killing the said man wasn't above the elf.
She said effective cursing three generations of Malfoy family lords and heirs .
"Draco? Draco?!", He anxiously called but got no response.
Even if Harry felt all the annoyance and irritation he had for it , the fond exasperation in his heart didn't lessen by even a bit.
" Yes, when you saved Ginny Weasley in fourth year, you destroyed it ultimately destroying Voldemort"
- They have their second confrontation after chapter 1 .
Just then an oldman living in his head who had illegally hijacked his head space , finally spoke after consecutive days of complete silence .
" Don't worry, it won't be anything outrageous. I just need direct unbreakable insurance. What if you betray Draco? I wish to take no chances. This is a matter for life and death for not only me but also Draco, Blaise and Theo. One small mistake can kill us all"
His gaze shifted towards Blaise to see his eyes still closed while keeping the unrelenting grip on his waist.
And Harry was already addicted even if he himself was unaware , his magic , body and instincts were well knowledged.
With a hesitant gaze he looked around in the darkness , wanting to find any clue visually than personally going down. But not a single thing prevailed there other than darkness . Finding no other option he cautiously slipped down.
" I am waiting for someone . He promised to come back . I am waiting for him ."
" Oh this ? I just found it fallen on the floor. Finders owners . Isn't it ?  " He said, raising it up in clear view while smiling like a pure unsullied angel.
The dark mark was gone. Finally Harry understood what Draco was doing. He wanted to remove the dark mark.
" What do you mean we aren't supposed to be here?!" , Fred shouted.
With his eyes not moving even an inch, Harry , not wanting to disturb Draco's sleep, asked softly, " How has he been ?"
" Oh ! That . I transported it into my portable storage ring. Look " Draco said, showing Harry his ring. He took the egg out and put it in again , relishing in seeing the surprised look on Harry's face.
At a distance, Harry was busy in his work but still had his magic paying spying elsewhere. His face sported a satisfied smile. His eyes having glee and happiness mixed with a darker desire.
"Eat up. We can't have the only healer among us becoming sick, can we?"
The soul ripped apart Draco's sleeve to reveal his dark mark. He squeezed the darkly stained skin as coal-black and dense liquid dripped from Draco's pores. Slowly, the thick black blood flowing down turned to the normal crimson colour.
"Ignore you and not listen to you . Please , I already regret it "
Neville opened his eyes with a gasp . The eyes. The same eyes were looking down at him. The same evil eyes.
" Didn't you say that you are bound to the walls . How are you in my head ?"
Seeing Draco , Ron's face sported a disgusted sneer . The reaction did not escape Draco but he kept his face neutral and chose to ignore him. On the other hand , Pansy had noticed as well and raised her ever ready wand when a hand lightly tapped it . She turned to see Blaise indicating towards Draco who gently swayed his head from side to side , telling her to stop. Even if she hated the gryffindor , she respected and valued Draco more. Her wand slowly lowered.
They soon reached home.  It was a two storey house with a lawn and backyard .
Now that the reunion was completed , they turned their attention towards the Weasley family who were standing there silently spectating , not willing to spoil their moment .
" Yes , some parents have already collected their children . As for the others, they are leaving as soon as possible" Ron said.
The look on pansy was similar to someone who had faced too much pain and grief. It looked oddly pitiful on her tender and young face.
Inside the infirmary, Draco tried to lock up his emotions in his chest again but failed miserably to the constant heat and pressure surrounding him. He did not know what Harry wanted. Did not know why he was still here. He wanted to run away, wanted to stop, but he did not know how. So, for the first time in his life, Draco Malfoy let go. He cried and cried thinking that this might be his only chance he cried on someone's shoulder, let someone know his pain, even if that someone was his enemy for years. There were no words spoken but he knew Harry understood, maybe he found them false, but at least he understood.
" It's nothing. Just that Slughorn is still as tight-lipped as ever. I need to get this done quickly", Harry replied.
Draco's tense shoulders finally sagged as he stood up and ran . Roughly colliding with the taller figure, he threw both of them falling back. Domineeringly sitting on the stomach of the infuriating liar, Draco's eyes shone hard and cold.
" Sleeping ? SLEEPING !? BUT WHY ARE YOU SLEEPING BESIDE ME ?"
Answer in the comments, pals.
Beside them , Ron saw this scene as if a tapestry at Hogwards and quietly lowered his eyes. No one noticed but a watery shine glazed over them as his eyes lashes lowered , wishing to hide and conceal , wishing to forget .
"No , just one "
This man, The Golden Warrior as he said, is clearly very powerful. Harry already had an inkling of it when he silently read Harry's memories without him even suspecting anything. Struggling to calm his throbbing heart, Harry thought that agreeing to this old man is not detrimental in any sense. Even if he doesn't have the solution to Harry's problems, at least he will do no harm. Harry decisively made up his mind. But a smart man always cross-checks before giving a definite answer.
Harry can do it easily. Just change a single word in the spell he was uttering and Draco will be his forever.
In this chapter, we will see,
Crack~               Crack~               Crack~
" I don't need your help! Don't you understand ! I told him ! I told him already ! I tried !! But he isn't even here ! He did nothing !!! So...so I have to do this ! I have to kill you"
" Find him "
"Hmmm, you are an interesting child. Some guts you must have to call a Malfoy 'kitty' ! But, I have to say it quite suits Malfoys to be a bunch of kitties."
The fuming words suddenly stopped short. A pair of eyes caught the wet tracks on Hermione's face.
" Draco , Are you alright ?" , Pansy asked with a frown and worried eyes .
"Fine! You win!", Harry said with a huff.
[T/N:- ahhh!!! Aaaa!!! Stop! Stop! ]
" AHH !", Neville shouted in agony and entirely curled up in himself. His body bonelessly slumping on the seat as he lost consciousness.
"Okay. Calm down. Calm down. It's just a baby. Calm down" ,Harry said as he cautiously lifted the small body, awkwardly holding her.
The drops of sweat fell from Draco's bowed forehead travelling to his tightly closed eyes. The pain was unbearable, it was worse than before.
" It's a
The man looked uncomfortable being asked this question . But looking at Draco's clear and shining eyes , the man sighed and gave up .
The office itself was overly exaggerated. It looked more like a doll house than an office. The lavish desk had tea cups and cookies rather than pen and paper.
" Oh. I have been talking aloud to myself. I find it … exceptionally useful "; The voice answering was airy and unbothered by the intensity of the situation.
In front of him was an infected eagle with swollen wings which he stumbled upon some time ago . Apparently lep it had caught an infection from an injury . Fortunately , it was fairly common and easy to cure . Draco closed his eyes and waved his hand over the wary bird as he let his magic cover it , telling it that he meant no harm . Slowly lowering his hand and resting it on the bird , he let his magic flow in it's body and kill the infection in it , gently healing the worst wounds and letting the small ones heal on their own . Taking the herbs he bought from Hogsmead last week , he crushed them in his hands before lathering it on the wounds . The eagle looked up at Draco with its beady eyes and he thought that it might not leave . It felt like the bird was silently thanking him . But this proves wrong as it flew away . Draco looked as it flew higher and higher . Someday he will be the same.  He will heal all his wounds and fly higher than anyone and nothing could stop him then .
Hermione saw the aggrieved look on her face and found it especially lovely. So, she silently picked up the book and moved to sit beside Pansy, saying, "This is a good seat, isn't it? Near to the fire, warm and bright. Feels very comfortable, right?"
" Yes. But there's nothing other that old garbage there "
Hermione was crying now . Her face streaked with tears , pleading Harry to stop. But all of it went to naught.
Not letting Draco speak , Harry added again, " And it wasn't even my fault…. It was you … who was squeezing here and there "
The lift jerkily moved while throwing them here and there. After falling left and right and almost crushing their noses, the lift finally stopped on level 2.
This time Draco's face softened again as he said , " I am your brother , right ? Then listen to your brother and don't worry , will you ?"
Harry's eyes followed the hand to meet a face with beauty so otherworldly that the one in front of him seemed more like a god than a mortal. Indeed, Draco is beautiful enough to start a war. And for the first time, Harry was thankful for Draco's prickly and overly scorching personality. If he had been even a bit softer, kinder, weaker, if Draco had been any more simpler, then people could have tainted his beauty with their lust and greed. They would have used any means to covet him, to break him. Harry was infinitely grateful that Draco was a Malfoy. He was thankful that Draco was a cunning Slytherin with cruelty enough that people only feel fear and respect when they see him and not lust or greed.
Harry : ( - _ - )
It gave a shrill scream and moved to enter Draco again when Luar confined it within an enchanted vial.
The sticky fluid made the sound of a soft hand hitting the soft skin sound particularly disgusting.
The three Slytherins looked behind them and immediately stepped behind Draco . Their wands still in their lowered hands and eyes still vigilantly on Harry.
" If you say so , young man ."
Turning to Draco , Harry searched his beautiful features as he noticed that his eyes held a certain warmth and gentleness when he looked at people in front.  A sudden fire burned in Harry's chest as he tasted the sourness on his tongue .  His eyes froze completely and his face blackened into something terrifying.
She watched as white strands from all over the house flew into the tip of her wand. These were her memories , the proof of her existence. Her figure in the photos, her clothes, her books, all her belongings, everything connected to her slowly disappearing.
So Draco being the little slimy snake he was , ran away with his tail between his legs , very much like a fleeing kitten , jumpy and puffed up .
The struggling stopped momentarily and Neville looked up aggrieved, "What can you say ? The whole school knows how much you surround yourself with women ! “One on the right arm and other on the left” - isn't this what they say ! Why do you bother to lie when everyone knows the truth ?!"
With a jolt , he opened his eyes and the first word he uttered was, " Draco "
Gasps of fear rang out through the students of both houses, Gryffindor and Slytherin.
A deep breath full of aroma invaded her nose and a heady buzz sounded in her brain. The floral aroma smelled even more delectable by mixing in the scent of the forest surrounding them.
Pansy cast a doubtful look towards her but still, albeit hesitantly, took the plate and started eating while curiously looking at the symbol from the corner of her eyes.
" Now coming to the actual topic. Malfoy and I think that a mutual alliance can be extremely beneficial for us , all of us. The ones agreeing please raise their hand",  Harry started .
" Thus the blood pact is sealed . May it remain till the end of time. To break it is to cease from existence , your body and soul, and to keep it is to cherish it's bond."
" Finally remembering someone as me exists , is it ?" ; Luar answered in a very monotone voice.
……………
Slapping both his cheeks at once, Harry asked again," Don't you know how to ask for help !?! "
(See the end of the chapter for
- aaannnd .....( Drum rolls ) ....... SMUT !!!!
" Meet in the astronomy tower after midnight today " She said and everyone nodded in tacit understanding.
Harry thought.
Draco could heal the bruises if he wanted but such a minor thing wasn't something he should pay attention to. It was nothing to him.
Draco gazed in the emerald eyes. Harry was so close. The temperature from his hand was so hot , as if boiling lava. And drowned and burned entirely.
The man said in a hypocritic and patronizing tone, like a mentor teaching his ward, "Work and play should indeed be balanced. Considering your recent grades, I allow you to take this class off to rest and take your…
Draco's brows screwed tighter, " I am. My mother is of black family "
Ron: " ??? "
Such  hilarious and stupid people . Who would be able to keep a straight face in front of them ? Even a goblin would laugh .
Draco wanked his hand back and gave Harry a seething glare as he walked past him as he followed Draco . Jumbled in their own emotions , none of them noticed that they were making their way right into the beast's stomach , right into the forbidden forest .
Hermione shook out of her daze to see Pansy waiting for her. She must have clearly heard their conversation.
" Don't worry . Just let his safely sleep here  for one night and when he wakes up tomorrow , he can take care of himself . Just it would have been excellent if you told Pansy that we had some business to take care of and will return till early morning "
The hands stilled and slowly drew back. Harry with obscure eyes and an animalistic growl in his voice said , rough and hoarse , " I let you go this time . Only because you called my name  "
With a sigh, Harry turned around , put his arm around the reluctant boy's shoulder and pulled him right beside him.
Draco looked up at the lady and saw the joy in her eyes. His eyes lowered again. He rarely got such innocent smiles. And for the sake of that single smile, He accepted the box. He gave the lady a small smile and said, "Thank you" as he walked out.
A haggard but proud and worried face smiled as it looked at Draco . The soul lovingly stroked Draco's hair as he let the boy rest . His eyes held unfathomable emotions as he looked at his newly adopted son . He did not know why but Draco struck something in him . The need of cherishing him was unavoidable . So , he did something he could not have done in a thousand years . He adopted Draco . It was not because he felt like it but more because he knew Draco needed someone beside him  desperately just like he did . The plague of loneliness and helplessness was hard to bear . He knew it well beforehand and he did not wish to let Draco go through it alone .
The middle aged man he was looking down at quickly pulled up his pants and looked up at him , " Who are you ?! What are you doing ?!?"
"Who are you ? Why are you in my head ? Did I get caught ? What are you doing to me ?"
[ T/N : votes are open in the comments. Mpreg Sibling or no siblings ?? Any other suggestions are appreciated as well.]
With a very happy expression , Draco said ," yes . But can I call you papa ? It is more comfortable . "
A thud sound echoed as Harry appeared in front of a wide entrance . As he was getting up, a house elf popped beside him, professionally saying, " Master Harry , Welcome Back."
The man's eyes hardened,"  The way ahead is tough . You can't back away even if you want . Is this your final decision?"
The next morning sitting down on the gryffindor table , Harry looked at Malfoy to see him eating his meal . He looked fine and pointedly ignored even glancing at anything other than his plate . Harry kept his eyes on him throughout .
"You're Draco "
At this second, Draco's three world views were collapsing.
Huh. Fear ….but for what ? Questions swirled in Draco's head. Kreacher's reaction was a bit odd. As if he was scared but sorrowful at the same time . But , in all of this one thing was clear . Kreacher was hiding something. Something that involved his mother.
A sweet smile graced Draco's pale face and a fearless smirk painted Harry's smug face.
Soon, eight people all sat around the bonfire and ate the grilled fish like starved beasts, finishing in minutes. Before they ate, they also called the two elves for dinner as well but were resolutely refused because, "The elves should not eat with the masters ! It's not proper !", As Kreacher had sternly said and tightly held back Dobby as well.
Just like this, Fred went to call Kreacher out and George started to clean the pile of fishes enough for 12 people alone. After some moments, Fred came back with Kreacher.
Harry had always wanted this . This house , his room , his parents , his soon-to-be born sister , his mom's food , his dad's pats , this life . He always wanted it . He prayed , pleaded , begged and  dreamt . While he was in the cupboard crying due to pain , at hogward's in his bed  unable to sleep , in front of The mirror of Irsed looking at his deepest desires , with the Weasley family seeing how they are , at the Hogward's station finding numerous students hug their parents with joy , he was always there , wishing for this , even if just for a bit . Even if it was only a crumb left of the original bread . Harry always thought that even if he got the chance to experience it for a bit , he will be satisfied .
No . It can't be that right ? For the golden boy to use a dark spell …. It definitely can't be true . But still…
After saying, he turned to the old house elf and said, "Kreacher, pick up Dobby and bring him with us"
It was already midnight and the silver moonlight was flooding this place. A dark figure came out as soon as Harry and Draco . Theo revealed himself first as after him Hermoine and others came out of their hiding as well.
As Harry's eyes widened at the appearance and disappearance of the egg out of thin air , his heart secretly envied the treasure. But the envy wasn't visible on his face but instead the look of wonder prevailed there. Harry was acutely aware of the haughty upturn of Draco's nose as he over exaggerated the expression to get even more of that sweet look.
Pansy ,who was silently working with Draco to count and list all the herbs, potions, and such things they have, paused suddenly. Turning to Draco, her voice sounded in somewhat embarrassment and reasonable shyness, afterall she was a noble lady by birth and voicing such matters to a man ,even if the said man is your brother, can be uncomfortable, "Draco, Um… I am going that way. I will come back after….uh... powdering my nose"
He sat opposite of Draco with his legs folded and waited for Draco to do the same .
Pansy : "…"
The round dough that now remained as small as a candy. Lifting it to the headmaster's mouth, he stuffed it inside before forcefully closing the jaw to make the headmaster swallow.
Then her eyes drifted to stop on Hermione and she thought ,
This instantly caught Harry's attention, "What? She isn't back yet ?”
Can....Kreacher know who... the Young master's~ mother is ? "
Now, standing before the cabinet, Draco felt calm. He realised that no matter how anxious he was, this was inevitable.
" Belonged to his mother . Difficult to find. But -" Dumbledore lifted his hand , showing the blackened and dried skin ." Even more difficult to destroy "
Harry's eyes shone a ruthless light, he was angry, very angry.
Draco scowled at him and said, "Don't curse a child."
" I needed to bring him somewhere to rest and this was the only place nearby "
Blaise couldn't process what was happening but his heart was anxious to let Neville leave with such misunderstanding. It felt like if, today, he let Neville leave with this misunderstanding, then the regret tomorrow will be an infinite torture for his whole life. So, he hastily tried to prove his innocence.
Neville's eyes widened, "Merlin…."
His body was bathed and rubbed with scented oils, his hair massaged with expensive products. He was dressed in another set of robes and kept on the bed again. Just like a doll , he was dressed and decorated for their master to use again.
" It's like an extra sense you get when your magic is powerful enough ."
Harry and Dumbledore, both , curiously immersed their faces in the palette as Draco patiently waited.
Ron kept his mouth shut , refusing to heed. A sharp glint passed Harry's eyes and the force grinding him down increased.
Nearby, The rest of the boys had finally returned as Hermione let them enter through the barriers.
A pair of silver eyes slowly opened as another pair of wide green eyes and gaping mouth entered Draco's vision.
Ron hummed nonchalantly.
In his thoughts some time passed. Draco did not move or walk around . He stayed in the same place and made minimum moments. This place was unknown to him. Who knows what it might hold. If the giant snake corpse at some distance from him was any indication then it was the best choice to stay still and not accidentally provoke danger.
Meeting his eyes, Draco smiled softly, it was the first smile he had in two years. His voice was a mere whisper. As if a cools breeze flowing past Harry's ears, he said,"
Night soon fell. Draco sat in his bed ready for a deep slumber but unexpectedly, thinking. He remembered standing before the dark lord who was demanding him to kill, portraying it like an honor. Commanding him to curse an innocent girl, to kill Dumbledore.  Draco never wanted to do this. But he had no choice but to stay silent and let nature take its course. He had no choice but to shove the guilt at the back of his mind and keep going because if he dwelled in this then his mother and sworn slytherin siblings will be the same . If Katie Bell was cursed then several people will be trying to save her, they will give their best for her. She will have a chance. Dumbledore was the greatest wizard of their time, as powerful as the dark lord, he can surely save himself if he wants so. But what about him? What about his people? They will be killed without a second thought. No one will try their best to save him. If they die then they weren't strong enough, weren't loyal enough. But if Katie or Dumbledore die then it was a tragedy, a reason to harass and kill every Slytherin around.
Umbridge said with a smile so sweet that it sent chills down their spin, " Oh ! Mathilda ! Nancy ! Trever sent you , did he ? Good , we'll go straight down "
Harry's hands came forward to hold him and  a single touch of his palm on Draco's waist was enough. Draco's back arched , his mouth flew open and eyes rolled up spilling intoxicated tears .
Now he did. Very clearly so.
" I am still not over the worry . I think you should visit Professor Pomfrey. I can request her to come if the pains too much"   Saying this he stood to send a patronus but was stopped by Draco.
Theo's face lowered like a scolded child ,
And he couldn't take anymore, loudly shouting, "And Malfoy's still there ! He's there alone!"
Harry scooped a generous amount on his palm and rubbed with both his hands to warm it up. He meticulously placed a well defined and pale foot on his lap and slowly started massaging it.
Pansy was already in a weak condition and needed ample rest. Hermione didn't forget this detail.
"How do you know I am a Malfoy ?! Did you read my memories !? " ,The speculations can be clearly heard in his voice.
With a scheming smile , the man said , " Good morning, everyone . I am your new minister of magic Pius Thickeness . And as your new minister of magic , I promise you all to restore this temple of tolerance to its former glory . Therefore, beginning today , each employee will submit themselves…. for evaluation "
" Great minds think alike ,don't they ?"   Harry said , a slight laugh in his voice.    " We will be leaving today at sundown. So make necessary preparations"
" What ? What are you talking about ?" , Blaise said as his face controted into childlike innocence.
Soon after Hermione left, sleep overtook Harry. The state of comfort that Draco provided him lulled him to a light and aware sleep.
" For what ? " Draco asked with his eyes till closed.
" You bastard ! Are you insane ?! I told you to stop !!! " Draco roared furiously.
" If we know that then why don't we just block them there . Or better , destroy the room ! " Suggested Hermione.
"WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!", Came the shriek from behind him.
On the other hand, with each mouthful of blood, Draco's face grew paler and paler. While treating Harry, it was inevitable that he would be affected by some of the poison in the blood.
" What if I call the head elf and ask ?" Draco said, still not believing him.
" Hah. Hah. Hah" Harry took deep breaths through his parched and bobbing throat. Trying to cool the heat spreading through his body and the mysterious intoxication muddling his brain.
At Draco's question, Ron let out a quiet but relieved huff and said, " Hermione obliviated them since killing them will draw too much attention. Before leaving, I erased all our traces of magic as much as possible "
Harry was truly furious, the thought of Draco disappearing from his eyes, from his life was frightening. It was chilling.
Seeing the look in his eyes , his parents frowned and quietly exchanged a worried glance .
In the room of requirements , Harry woke up to see an empty room with no Draco and no egg .
Voice serious , he said ," Draco , wait . Something's not right . Don't struggle . "
Hearing Luar's voice in his head , Draco calmed down slightly as Harry said into his ear ," Don't move and take a look around . Don't be stupid enough to invite your own doom "
With silent endurance, Harry let Draco grab his hand and guide him to squeeze it over the egg . He watched with curiosity as the white absorbed the red complete, not even leaving a drop or a stain.
How you like that ?! ( Blackpink your area !)
SHLAP!
decorating the boulder.
Dobby remained silent , confused why Draco was asking this question but ultimately answerless.
Pansy Parkinson.
A nod answered his question.
Hello readers,
The order of Pheonix….. Huh ! What a fraud !!!
Their eyes met in the air and both them sprinted outside, their wands ready and gaze alert.
Extending his hand towards Draco , Harry indicates him to get a steady hold . As soon as Draco intertwined his pale fingers with another's darker and larger ones , a shock ransacked his body . Before he even realised what was happening , he was already standing on the familiar place, the astronomy tower.
She opened the page and the symbol revealed itself. It was a small triangle with a circle inside touching all three of its sides and a horizontal line coming from the top of the triangle and ending on the opposite side, perfectly dividing the figure. The symbol was drawn on the upper corner of the page and seemed very inconspicuous. If it was someone other than Hermione, they probably wouldn't have noticed it.
The clock ticked away and the silver rays turned to golden ones. It was already the start of another day. With this, Harry finally sorted out the jumble in his head and decided to find out the answers to his questions from the source himself. He hurriedly made his was to the Griffindor common room. On entering, he immediately came face to face with Hermione and Ron.
Having had his fun , Harry softly reminded, "We have to leave . We can't stay here anymore "
Disappointment was thick in Harry's eyes. Not just of today but of years. He silently looked to Draco and said ," Thank you , Malfoy . For healing me and my friend "
THWACK ! -- A strong punch landed on Harry's handsome face.
To Draco , quite a time passed but actually it was only a moment . Looking at Potter , he said ," I could not find anything . It keeps consuming all my magic . I was not even able to check it's health."
made the Slytherins around hold Blaise in a new feared light.
She spoke softly , pleadingly ," Please don't . You belong here , with us . Don't you want to see your younger sister ? Please stay . Harry , you are my baby . How can I let you go ? Have I done something ? Has James done anything ? D-don't worry . We won't do it again . We-we will even repent it . Just tell us what happened. Don't just leave the house . "
His magic woved itself in Draco's body and magic as if a dark night woving itself around the moon and it's moonlight.
Just his hand squeezing a stick inside the pants , that's right. Just….his..hand.. squeezing……..a stick ….. inside ….the ……………….pants
Desperate wails sounded from the unconscious beauty , begging for air . And the merciful lord , delighted by the honey like song , released the red lips .
Draco's narrow eyes looked at Harry in doubt but ultimately said, " Fine "
Morning soon came. Draco, thinking that he unknowingly fell asleep last night, put even more effort to his tasks. Soon everything was ready and they were set to leave.
;He gave a relieved sigh.
A hot tear slid down her fair cheeks as she made her way out of the house. As she opened the front door and stepped out, a figure caught her red eyes.
Hearing this question , Draco's mask slipped but he still remained cold. This question .ade him remember the past he would rather forget.
- But because of the point above, Draco and Theo were almost killed. Dobby was injured.
The professor continued, "Well, since you liked it so much, how can I disappoint you by not letting you experience another of such a curse?" A face gleamed with malicious intentions.
An ery smile rose on Harry's face at this thought. That's right. He should make it so that Draco needs him. So that he won't be able to leave even if he wants to.
How is this possible ? The house elves regularly clean the whole mansion. How can it be possible that in such a huge mansion there is not a single place for him to sleep ?!?!
Professor Slughorn seemed hesitant. Opening his mouth, he uttered no words but looked at Draco again and eventually said ," I still advice you to take Mr. Malfoy to the infirmary, Harry"
Their daughter, their sweet little girl , was the only treasure worth protecting in their life. This house, their car,  their life insurance , their savings and all they had was for their small bundle of sunshine. They had worked hard and toiled to gather this so that she could live a comfortable and happy life.
A voice sounded from behind them ,
" Why are you here with Malfoy?" Harry asked .
Draco didn't seem surprised at this . He had read about this before but did not expect that he himself was suffering from the same condition . He was slightly above average among his peers and thought that was his original strength . Above that , he did not notice any symptoms at all . Looking at the curtains covering the top of the bed , he blinked and remained silent , urging Luar to keep going .
Hello readers,
- you will know for what pansy called all the six of them to  astronomy tower without Harry and Draco at midnight.
"B-ut but…."
Hearing this , Draco understood that he did not want to reveal his name , so he smoothly diverted the question and asked instead ," How do I get out of here ?"
Draco doubled his effort as he blocked the wisp with his magic. The wisp was captured in a siege but one step forward and it will escape. Every way was blocked and he was losing his focus as the wisp ate more and more of his soul.
His voice was filled with worry. Death eaters were no wizards , they were demons . They won't see if it's a Slytherin or a Gryffindor , if it's a child or an adult. If they want to kill then they will kill.
" He just runs away everytime he sees me"
He watched as Draco supplied his magic inside it . Some time passed as Draco , still in the same position with his palm on top of the egg , scrunched his eyebrows and pursed his lips tightly . By the looks of it , he was having quite a difficulty meaning they were about to gain some information .
"Thank you , but I don't have much time . The poison is still in my body . It cannot be cured . Half of my body is already useless . I am sorry to waste your efforts
Hermione and Pansy silently looked at Ron for a second while Harry stood there unbothered and calm.
The sooty skull was thrashing, screaming.  Harry did not give up and kept pulling. It was not working. He was growing frantic when - SLASH !
Behind them Yaxley was again running to them with a new vigour rarely found in his old-age. Bright lights flew around and the tapping of boots on the marble floor grew faster and louder.
Magazine and wanted flyers  flew past above their heads to neatly land in the table kept at the side. Harry could cleary read what it said -
Blaise hurriedly collected his rampant thoughts. He had known of these strange thoughts he had about Neville for some days. And he was aware where he was heading. But right now clearly wasn't the time to wonder about red handprints on a fair waist. He still needed to explain to Neville.
It was getting harder to leave , to take even a step away . He knew it was the illusion making it harder , testing his limit .
" Do you, Harry James Potter, swear on your blood to never intentionally or unintentionally betray Draco Lucius Malfoy?" , Draco started.
Exhausted from the tears and pain, Draco soon fell asleep. The next morning he woke up to the sight of a beautiful woman in expensive wizarding robes in front of him. She was sitting on the couch by the window, merrily sipping a cup of tea. Her red hair seemed even more fiery in the golden rays of the sun. As soon as their eyes met, a sneer overtook her face as she gracefully kept the cup down.
This idiot ! What did he want to do ?!? He looked less likely to get the dark mark out and more likely to die ! Would it have hurt him to just tell someone !?! But no ! He will cry . He will shout. He will fight and run away . But not open his mouth and shout - "HELP! "   What kind of stupidity was this ? Aren't Slytherins supposed to be smart and calculative ? Why is this one so utterly  dumb !?!?!
" please ! You don't understand ! I am a half-blood ! My father was a wizard. He worked in this ministry for 20 years. I- I always wear his coat. I still wear it. Please !"
" How ? " Asked Harry in a monotone voice.
The coughs didn't stop for a while. Draco repeatedly patted the headmaster's with a hand as he was supporting him with the other. When the coughs receded, the headmaster fell unconscious again.
The voice spoke again, this time as if making fun of Harry, "Worry not, child. I do not come to harm you. But do tell me, is there nothing you need ?"
The soul made a gesture with his hands and immediately a ring flew to him. The ring shone bright with a blue-green light. It had a turquoise stone embedded within the silver. At once, Draco was astonished. It was a Malfoy ring! Every Malfoy is given this ring on their twelfth birthday as a recognition of their talent and expertise by their elders. And another thing about this ring is that only its owner or his spouse can command and touch it. It has been a sacred ornament in the Malfoy Family for years. This ring signifies the sweat, blood and tears it's owner flows to achieve his/her goal. It signifies the reason to live for the one who wears it. It signifies everything they are and they own. Giving this ring to another signifies giving your everything to another, heart, body and soul as well making the person their sole purpose from now. Opposite to contrary belief, Malfoys are absolutely hopeless romantics. The same goes with the Blacks. And Draco, being the perfect spawn of Malfoys and Blacks, is not only hopeless but absolutely wrecked romantic.
Harry ,who was at the forefront , pointed his wand as well, his magic sweeping through the air to corner whoever was there. And Harry clearly felt his magic sense the presence of three wizards.
Silence prevail for some frail minutes.
"Hmmm." Draco ascents.
" Then how did it turn like this ? "
How can she let any danger, any threat around them , harm them ? No, she won't, even if that threat is herself and the cost is her happiness. She will erase her entire existence from their life if that's what she has to do to protect them.
Hope you like it !
- Draco finally removed the dark mark.
Her presence had almost drove Harry crazy from irritation. All those years Harry didn't know why he felt like this. It wasn't as if he absolutely hated Pansy, he hated Pansy only when she was around Draco.
In the family of three, when two big ones fight, the small one is obviously forgotten.
With a sigh of relief , Draco said ," okay then . I'll look if Weasley is alright "
Understanding Draco's thinking , Luar said ," Recovery and treatment cannot hurry , Draco . It is a process . Doing it faster or with an alternative will only mess it up. What you can do is to find the cure as well as train yourself to be stronger . So when the time comes you can be ready and not lacking."
"Why ?"
Cold sweat dropped down Ron's back but he remained firm. He had decided this , so he will follow it through.
As the counter-spell took effect, the laboured breathing eased and her blue face slowly regained its natural colour.
Walking out, Harry made his way into the forbidden forest . He had a very anxious feeling telling him that he was needed there. Passing Hagrid's hut , he entered the thick canopy . He started walking deeper into the forest , following his memory to lead him to the cave that he found with Malfoy earlier .
"Potter, I-is it there?", Draco asked tremblingly.
"It is as the madam said.", he answered.
Hearing Draco's words , conflicted emotions passed through his eyes as he hesitantly replied ,"That - Well , I can but - I don't know ."
….No….this can't be true …. No….hairy buttocks !!! Why ?!?
"Then you are dumb."
Now, the only thing that remained were the tears and cries rushing out of a boy in another's arms.
In his thoughts , Draco didn't even realise his eyes closing and falling asleep. Harry held Draco preciously in his arms. His eyes darkening at the display of trust and dependency .
anyway, we can only wait now."
Draco had worked quickly, leaving close to no internal or external wounds on Pansy, only severe weakness.
*Pin-en-groom - Here ↓
Picking up the deeply slumbering Draco, Harry made his way up to the gryffindor dormitories . The space was empty as all students were at the great hall for dinner.  Laying Malfoy in his bed , Harry carefully removed his robes and shoes . All the while his eyes never left the lush cherry lips.
Harry's eyes grew colder, "You should know when to shut up, Malfoy. Answer me"
Happiness. It was their happiness.
Harry sighed tiredly and stayed quiet. But to Draco it clearly looked like he was looked down upon. Like he was a person too idiotic for his attention. A Malfoy can take everything but he will never take being looked down upon.
help me . Please take him and hide him. "
" Fine" ; Harry replied in a relaxed yet steady tone. Getting up, he gave both of them approving looks and made his way out .
from Draco, his magic swiftly cut a small wound on Draco's wrist and drew a huge drop of blood from it. He unhesitatingly dropped the big drop floating in air instantly in the lamp before it froze from the cold.
They looked older than the pictures he had of them . Time gifting them the wrinkles and reverence . They were talking with the Weasleys as they stood waiting for someone . Him maybe .
" Very good . Very good"
George, Fred and Harry inquiringly looked at Ron. They were the closest to Ron here and knew that he had some thoughts about Hermione. So, when Hermione showed unusual attention to another, they all turned to Ron so as to gauge his reaction. But seeing that he seemed alright, the worry in their hearts was obviously scattered.
Harry smiled at the haughty words and indulged, "I wouldn't be able to do anything. It's all thanks to you."
" You are going to let that happen ?"
No. it's not that it seems . Then... maybe if he sat on the seat ? With pants on or without pants ? Pants up or pants down ?
Draco was once again stunned to shock . His mouth falling open as his eyes became as wide as saucers , looking especially like a  tarsier* . What !?! He was a healer , a potion master , a legilimens and occlumens all together !!!!! What kind of monster was this ? And he lived only 48 years out of which at the very least 11 years went without magic . So that means he had  masteries over four very difficult and powerful topics  that people sometimes spent their whole lives learning !?! WHAT THE FUCK !!!!! Even Snape had only potions mastery and basic legilimency and occlumency ! And Snape was the smartest person he knew ! This is not a wizard , well , once-upon-a-time-now-soul-wizard . Draco barely resisted the urge to drop on his knees and pray .
Mundungus shouted , cleary enraged , " I am not a thief , you foul -" Harry's eyes gleamed at him and he tersely corrected himself , frightened by the cold sweat on his back " git "
The three Weasley's temper receded with his words because they knew that he was right.
" Kreacher , I was about to call for you. Good that you're already here "
Hermione's pained expression slowly shifted to determination . Her eyes shone no doubt , she was firm in her thoughts and actions.
, Draco thought in astonishment. Now that he thinks of it, he knew almost nothing about Headmaster Dumbledore's life. He curiously flipped through the book, not particularly reading anything.
They walked some distance but there was still no sight of Pansy. The trees around them grew sparse as they were originally deep inside the forest.
That night , Harry silently sneaked out after curfew to make his way towards Slytherin dormitories . It was fairly easy with the cloak and the boon of parseltongue .
" Oh " Draco had almost forgotten about him.
" Granger ! Granger !"
" Who stopped you from hurting yourself during the healing spell just now ?"
Harry and his mother laughed at  his father as he , in an attempt to show his manliness , puffed his chest so wide that they thought it might burst.
After an unknown amount of time, the pain gradually subsided as Draco , understanding that it was over , let his consciousness slip as a subtle magic caught him and lay him down .
"Shhh. Don't speak. Someone's here.", Harry said, suddenly vigilant.
Blaise hastily tried to explain, "I am not lying ! Neville, believe me !"
"I don't answer to brats who aren't my apprentice."
No , he shouldn't do this. Not in the open. Not where their friends were steps away. Not when anyone could accidentally or intentionally see the pale and delicate skin Draco hid  beneath dark robes, covering his body from head to toe and only leaving his face visible. Harry was too petty, too selfish for even the possibility of something like that.
It took all he had to not just blow the man's head off the moment his eye landed on Neville.
Draco silently consented with a nod but still remained cold. This house elf has never liked or respected him , Draco knew this. He knew that Dobby was never , even once , loyal to him. This made his curiosity bloom even more as to why Dobby was standing before him instead of running away.
Draco remembered when he had gotten the dark mark and assigned his first mission, he had felt exactly how he was feeling right now. The vile faces, bloodied fangs and snake skin all flashed in front of his eyes. What will happen if these people truly enter Hogward's ? What will happen if he really killed Dumbledore ? He knew that he could never , right now the possibility was lesser than ever . But that is because the ritual succeeded . What would have happened if it had failed?
It was then that Luar slowly approached him and placed his hand on Draco's chest.
" He doesn't have the stomach, just like his father. I'll finish it my own way " ; came another gruff animalistic sound as the speaker consequently stepped forward . It's attributes of being rugged and savage were evident at the first hear and the first look of the owner.
So when Draco woke up , he found himself in a red and gold room with Potter sitting in the chair across, staring at his face.
" Yes, Master "
The death eaters were on their trail as they made a mad dash towards the aparating windows. Yaxley who reached down as well , stalked towards them with sure and menacing steps. His wand throwing various dark and deadly spells . Harry flicked his wand and thousands of parchment papers and magazines with his face on the cover flew to hound Yaxley , making him unable to move as well as see properly.
"You have a long way to go."
As soon as the egg sensed Harry, he found him familiar. But he could not remember exactly how. Now that he tasted Harry's blood, he remembered that it was his protector! He did not meet his protector for a loooooong time so he forgot but now that he tasted his protector's blood , he will surely remember forever. He gave a happy nudge to his protector to show that he was full before silently snuggling into his nurturer again. It was so warm and snuggly here.
Informing others, Everyone split into groups of three and started searching and calling out her name in the surrounding area.
And so as the sun disappeared behind the top of the buildings , two normal and inconspicuous teenagers with each a huge bag on their shoulders suddenly appeared in a dark alley beside a busy and bustling street.
Neville, who was still trying to break away from the stubborn hold, was instantly stunned when he found that instead of the green blankets beneath them, now there was the cold earth. His astonished gaze lifted to meet an endless valley of lavender fields around him.
Harry innocently said, " But , Malfoy , we are indeed companions bound by oath and magic , bound for life and death, bound for eternity --"
With mouth still dropped , Ron said ,
This garnered Draco's attention as he  subconsciously felt the magic in his body and around it , finding that his magic did feel more at ease . It was like before his magic could not move very fluidly in his body but now it moved around more freely and his body lost some of its rigidity . He was not particularly rigid , in fact , was physically very flexible , but he did not feel very comfortable in his own skin before . Now , his muscles were loose and his magic was more adapted . Overall , it felt much better .
Draco handed Pansy a plate while he slowly coaxed Theo into eating from the other plate, saying, " Don't sleep with an empty stomach. Eat this plate clean and you can go to sleep again"
" Harry ! You cannot actually be agreeing to this ! " Hermione screeched , her mouth falling open in shock.
I was also planning Hermione/Pansy with a misunderstandings plot and Neville/Blaise . What should I do guys ?? Please tell me what you think is best .
Theo followed as well," I agree. And you all should as well. After all, the same goes with Potter, doesn't it ?" His intelligent and sharp eyes conveyed a snake's stealth and fox's crafty thoughts.
" Tom Riddle's diary "
Looking at Draco's innocent face urging him , the man fell in deep thought . What use was it staying here? For all he knew , he might be in the netherworld , already . He might not even remember their promise.  He might not even remember him . But then again , he was a Malfoy and Malfoys do not give up just because they were scared.  If he was here , he can be found . If he was in the netherworld , he can be followed . If he did not remember , he can be reminded .
He sounded angry and frightened, Draco noticed in the haze of pain. It was then that he saw her wand turn towards Harry and as if reading her mind, he knew what she was going to do.
Here is the 16th chapter. This one was a long one. Like really long. Almost 6000 words. And this chapter was really important with respect to the plot. So did you like the conversation between Blaise and the death eaters. I know that it sounds very ominous but I promise ! I promise it's nothing like that ! In this whole book , Blaise and Neville are the most smooth sailing couple. Trust me ! Well,  I am into dog blood amd drama , but not for my babies Draco and Neville ! For every one else ........ Well...... We'll see.
-  the appearance of pansy , Blaise , Theo  , Ron , Hermione and Neville.
As the small flame rose, the old face was clearly visible now. It is indeed Bathilda Bagshot.
The small figure overturned the egg. Her chubby body shiny with fluids slowly crawled onto the mattress.
" Are you even listening properly ? I am telling you this for your own good "
" Don't worry. I am here "
Wow ! Now there was even a bounty placed on his head. Such an honour !
- Neville's first time getting really angry.
As they say , the one who experiences heavenly tribulation is the one most fearful as well as most thankful to the Heavens .Malfoy is still wary after the ordeal with his father .
The oldman had recovered some days ago and was now actively making his life difficult but he wasn't without advantages. At least now unexpectedly meeting Snape wasn't a sanity-threatening disaster that could wreck him. Well, he was still a sanity-threatening disaster , Harry just got an early reminder from Eloise and ran the other way as soon as he knew.
" Do you , Draco Lucius Malfoy , swear on your blood to never betray Harry James Potter ?
Harry blindly followed and haphazardly injected his magic into Draco immediately finding the black wisp. He knew that this was the actual problem from the waves of malice it was emitting.
So this chapter was relatively short. It took much longer as well because the framing and wording of this chapter was a absolute headache . The emotions and situation were a mess and hard to convey .
Blaise was even more panicked and didn't hesitate anymore. His arms tightened impossibly around Neville to hold him from escaping. As he tightly closed his eyes, concentrating on what he wanted to do.
Jarvis took a deep gulp as cold chills swept his tiny body.
A hand slowly crept towards Draco, resting on his face. A pair of glassy silver-blue eyes looked up, confused and frowning.
-pecto-
Embarrassed, Draco sat up with red cheeks, " Good Morning "
" Why is Malfoy here ? Shouldn't he be in the Slytherin dormitories ?" Ron lowered his voice as well.
Thus, without reservations, he asked, "You are Ms. Bagshot, aren't you ?"
Harry looked at Malfoy , silently assessing his views and alertness . His eyes flashed a surprised gleam , thinking,
Getting up , he washed up , he  changed his clothes and finally went down for dinner . He will think about what to do later. For now , let's go with the flow .
Fortunately , I met you here . Please
-And (drumrolls......)
In this chapter , you will notice :-
" You should sit down . You just recovered from over exposure to magic and are extremely sensitive. " Harry commanded while leading Draco to sit in one of the chairs.
"Then - I  -  he -" Ron stuttered with a confused look , frantically pointing towards himself then at the direction Harry left.
".................."
All of them looked as plain bands were inked on each of their wrists. It was the proof that the contract was successful and valid. The bands gleamed mellowly before disappearing as if they were never there.
The voice gave off an image of a elderly man apologizing with wrinkled eyebrows and downwards tilted mouth. The pair of glassy, regret filled eyes was a big fat cherry on top. Instead of making a delicious pastry, the image was that of a near to tears, regretful old man, making people feel guilty enough to just kill themselves with emotions without even moving a finger.
His brows furrowed in desperation , he fiercely whispered, " Mate ! It's me ! Ron ! "
- the appearance of The Wesley twins.
It was almost evening when Ron and Hermione sat beside Harry in the Gryffindor common room. Sharing an uneasy look with each other, Hermoine gently called," Harry ? W-we were worried about you. Are you alright ?"
"Hmm~ Its fine", Harry said so leisurely that the old voice felt that let alone it's pride he had already lost, the remaining scarps pf pride was also gone. And now he felt like he was stripped bare and standing in plain view of this gigantic world. The feeling of cold air between its legs was particularly strong.
Harry turned towards Hermoine, searching her face for something as she stayed absolutely still. Turning back to face forwards, he hummed deeply.
"No . Is there a need for that ?"
Walking down the deserted hallway together , the early morning light shone brightly . It was already the start of another week . When parting ways to their respective dormitory , Pansy halted making others stop as well .
When Harry turned back , he continued," I can't leave . My - my friends . I need to speak to them first . Also I still have to tell you something. Something important."
Harry didn't immediately start but patiently waited for the kitty to come out of his cave.
" How can you agree so easily ?" Neville asked in wonder.
" Y-yes "
" I have an unstable body ? What do you mean?"
" I have been good, sir. As good as the days let me "; Harry answered mildly . Him being with Dumbledore relaxed his guard by a bit . The fact that this man is akin to family to him is easily proven as such.
As soon as the words uttered, a loud " Avada Kedavra" echoed in the voice of Severus Snape as twin tails on green light shone from two different wands flowing towards the same man.
Harry watched as his blood slowly dipped in the empty lamp. The scarlet slowly raising along the wick. When the lamp was half full, Draco's magic silently came out to spot the bleeding and heal the bite.
Theo jerked toward Draco , " No no . It's not like that . It's just…. What should we do with the thief ? He's still tied to the chair. Do we let him go ? "
Silently, in her heart, Hermione made a firm promise that from today she would pay attention to the uncharacteristically wise but naive girl so unhesitatingly asleep in front of her.
Gradually the blue glow which dimly shrouded Ron disappeared, leaving a perfectly healed shoulder.
"Don't worry, We'll eventually find out, won't we?", Harry said looking deeply into Draco's eyes.
While sorting through , Draco's attention was caught by the locket still in his pocket as he wondered what to do with it. Suddenly , an idea popped in his head. As he was about to call out Kreacher's name , Kreacher himself popped in with Dobby in tow.
Draco's cheeks reddened. "After you fell asleep " he says. It isn't his fault that he had a body used to spells and quills and not running a marathon ! What do you expect from a pureblood like Draco whose blood had been nourished with aristocratic status and pampered with proud noblesse for centuries before his birth !
But what can she do ? What can she do other than erasing her existence from their life so that they can live ? What can she do other than leaving them with an aching heart in her chest so that they do not forget to smile as she had ? What can she do other than abandoning them so as to protect them ? Because now the only danger that threatened their life was her existence.
" But you shouldn't hurt him like that. It was too much. Too inhumane " Draco said sharply as he gently wiped the blood off. His words and actions were so different.
Harry looked down at Draco. The arms which were moments ago hitting his back in an attempt to break free now tightly held his shirt as he tightened his arms around Draco. He had got his answers.
And Draco though in the engulfing darkness,
The hand on Harry's mouth was already pulled back as he provoked further," or what ? You are going to hex me into what ?"
A veined hand crept towards Draco, sliding through his locks , rubbing his reddening lips and caressing his neck. At every touch the lithe body trembled beautifully. The cheeks blushed and ears reddened. Drops of sweat slid down from his neck before disappearing into the white shirt.
My poor baby ."
Afterall, Castles which are built in a hurry, crumble in a second.
The man's face remained cold as his voice took on a threatening tone " You do remember that I am going downstairs, don't you ?"
- Harry grew closer to Draco.
Draco's head jerked upward to face Harry, " Oh. I was almost done. Just wait a minute "
Several stunned heads turned and voices resounded. But Harry was tenacious and firm. He shot down each and every word of opposition. He was unyielding in his decision.
Draco gave a tired sigh and walked towards them, silently flicked his wand to levitate Theo gently. He gave Pansy a firm look to follow as well. Leading them to the second tent, he carefully lowered Theo in a comfortable position. Pansy laid down beside the boy as well. Her arm softly stroking Theo's hair again.
" The letter from Ron." Harry said while taking out the letter he bought along , keeping it in the middle of the table." They are planning something. Apparently, the order of Pheonix had their meetings in the Weasley household in the past week, which went on for quite some time. And after ending , the faces of all the members were gloomy and serious. Must be something of importance "
With the plan ready, the only thing to do now was to wait. The day passed by student questioning Harry about last night and what happened, trying to know everything that was there. But regardless of their efforts, Harry only had the tears sliding off  pale cheeks in his thoughts. Dinner soon came. The hallways emptied as students rushed to sate their hunger.
" Kreacher " , he called and an elf popped infront of him.
The moon soon disappeared and a new day started. Draco woke up to the fluttering of curtains and warm sunlight on his face.
Harry knelt down as well, "So, then What do I have to do?"
Kreacher looked at Draco and at first glance he knew that this young master was a pureblood and a Black as well.
Chuckling , Hermione said, " That's not it . Here let me show you " before her small hand used to holding pens and wands came forward to play the soft tune of
In this chapter,
A cold and hard gaze swept over Ron whose face inquiringly looked around to search for the source of it. His eyes met hard emeral once and a frightening chill flowed through his body as he lowered his eyes , afraid to even lift them .
He thought, noticing gentle steps coming towards him. But his eyes didn't lift from the tombstone in front.
" He needed to understand " Harry whispered back.
Ahhh, this naughty one ! Why does he always keep popping here and there ? Isn't he afraid of cracking up and breaking ?
Neville cluelessly watched as Blaise gave him a last look before leaving through the way he came in. The students around looked at Neville with a newfound pity as they thought,
" Potter ! Stop ! You are hurting him !" Draco's voice rose higher.
Ron's sudden anger caused their suppressed worry and fear for him to turn into flaming anger as well.
" The vanishing cabinet in the room of requirements. I've been mending it" Draco uttered with huffed breaths in an attempt to cool his racing heart.
How's your day ? Hope you have been well.
Mary , as if shocked but still worried for her husband said , ” But -"
Draco was still calm as he said, "We will have your revenge, Potter. Believe me. We will."
The tightly closed eyes slowly and hesitantly opened.
Draco understood his intentions and hurriedly copied him and sat in the same position .
Draco wanted to gain more trustful people on his side and Kreacher was a particularly knowledgeable person with regards that he was constantly with Regulus Black , a known Death Eater , and that he had a part in hiding a horcrux as well stealthily the same horcrux from where it was hidden. He could be miraculously useful in one way or another. It will not hurt Draco or the elf in question if Draco could earn his trust and loyalty with such an act as simple as this one. Anyway , he had no use of the locket now . Even if he knew that Kreacher was hiding something from him , he was sure by Kreacher's reaction that it wasn't something that could harm him.
Two men ...and two women…. stepping out of a room together ….with wobbly legs and crumpled clothes….
All the heads firmly nodded. No hesitance was seen. Neville, even if he was scared of Blaise and Pansy, still wanted to do this. He will not just sit down and watch them. He wasn't so cowardly.
Hermione stilled as she felt the body behind her lean more and more of their weight on her .
In Harry's brain wheels turned after seeing the scowl. With a slight smirk and bright eyes, Harry relaxed thinking  ,
Harry calmly stood up and smiled bitterly . His eyes sank , deepening the green to look like a bottomless lake . He turned his back to them and walked to the door .
Harry walked forward and knelt beside Draco . He looked as the woman barely opened her eyes and looked at them . She seemed startled and clutched the egg tighter to scramble back . Draco leant forward with his hand outstretched as though to bring her back . But seeing the terrified look in her eyes stopped and lightly let loose his magic , covering her , caressing her , comforting her . The woman relaxed slightly but was still wary .
As he heard this, Draco's mind grew heavy as sleep evaded his consciousness. Not wanting to sleep, he desperately fought back.  Fiercely  counterattacking, the fatigue suddenly increased by leaps and bounds. Losing his foothold, Draco weakly mumbled, " Wait ……" before he succumbed to it and his breathing grew steady and heart beat calm.
Concluding that there was no way other than waiting for Theo, Ron, Pansy and Hermione, Harry instead chose to forewarn the remaining two, Blaise and Neville.
"Fine "
Draco felt dread creep up his brain. They were going to do something that could possibly kill them, possibly kill Harry and surely kill Dumbledore. If he really died then the fate of wizarding London is in ruins. The Dark Lord was already planning for Headmaster's death . Over that the situation of his hand was severe and he was already weak. Death can come faster than he can imagine . No ,this can't happen.
Harry silently walked to the bed with his boots rhythmically hitting the floor , tilting Draco's chin up to face him. The satisfaction swirling in his eyes at the sight of tears was impossible to hide. But satisfaction wasn't the only thing in there . It had a tint of primal lust mixed in the emerald greens. It was familiar to Draco . The darkening of his eyes , the deepening of breaths , all of it was so familiar . All of these were signals, an omen of the incoming torture to be inflicted on him.
But before Draco could complete his sentence, Harry said with deadly calm, looking straight into Draco's eyes, "So ?"
Draco :  ( T_T )
Looking around, he noticed the unmoving body of The Headmaster. Fearing for the elder's life, he got up and moved towards it.
With a jolt , Hermione came back. Her eyes still trained on pansy but this time she heard her too.
He remembered when he destroyed Tom Riddle's diary in second year, it was with a balliski fang. A balliski fang containing balliski venom. But that was the last balliski whom he killed himself. If he was still in Hogward's maybe he could have gone to the chamber of secrets to check if there was some of it still left in the snake corpse. But now….it was impossible.
Harry's hand eagerly squeezed the small elf's shoulder as he said breathlessly, "Take me to him"
"True, true. Whatever Draco says is right."
Hermione subconsciously leaned further forward when, as if having a nightmare, Pansy shifted in her sleep.
, Harry realised.
Gathering the egg into his ring, Draco tidied himself . Curious at the disappearance of the egg, Harry asked,
" And why did you do that ?"
It was then that Harry realized what this was and he wordlessly wrapped his arms around the struggling boy . And said with a calm tone , " shhh.... I know..I know  "
Harry was able to maintain his composure but the same did not apply to Draco. With gentler magic and healing properties , the pact magic wrock havoc in his body.
" No , mom . I have to go now ." He said silently , solemnly .
Next chapter will be updated soon. Also remember to share, bookmark, subscribe, comment and leave kudos !!!
Currently, most of the upper pureblood  circle has lost their minds. In addition, most of the Slytherins students in the Hogward's do not even want all this. They are being forced by their parents just like him. Sooner or later, if he does not find a leeway, the ministry won't let anyone go. They will be made to bear the burn of the mistakes that were not even theirs to appease the hearts of the hypocritical  wizarding crowd. And no proof will be enough to prove their innocence with this cursed mark on their arms. No one will help. No one will believe.
He was addicted to Draco as if he was a blooming red flower of poppy , bitter yet addicting , able to induce torture with a single glance as well as euphoria with a single taste.
As the sun lowered and the sky took a saffron hue, Draco set out towards the forbidden forest, hiding and sneaking , making sure no one saw him.
" Go ahead. I am a respectable man. How can I lie to you ?!" A disbelieving and wronged expression on his handsome face. But Draco didn't even spare him a glance.
A grateful smile rose on Jarvis's face as he popped away.
Golden swirling dust flew ahead of their eyes , floating to the open mouth of Dementors.
Harry held Draco, not once loosening his arms. He made no effort to comfort Draco, with actions or words. His head down and chin touching Draco's ear, he stayed in the same position, not moving an inch.
This time Harry cracked a tired smile and replied to the teasing," No sir . As of now I have no one as such. And I doubt that will happen till unpredictable time in the future"
The elf raised his hand and snapped his fingers,
Similarly, The words
Just as he was about to step out, the shopkeeper called out, "Wait, gentleman!"
Draco:
" The guards are still outside, you know. You don't want them to look, do you? Don't want them to see how Heir Malfoy is such a cock-loving whore, do you? "         ; A smile was gracing his face as he said those words .
At the same time , Harry said with a steady strong command , " Well, we will meet after exactly one month . The contact will be maintained through letters , so keep your eyes and ears open at all times. And remember, we are all in this together and every one of you needs every other . So cherish each other , from here on you are no different than a single body , a single life."
" Harry ? What are you saying ? Go where ?" His mom asked again .
"That's...that's good", Harry said, partly speechless and partly still from the emotional shock.
Harry did not hesitate to answer. In the numerous tests with Dumbledore , he was never given an option. He was just thrust right into it , without a warning or help , where he either had to move ahead or die . He hated that part of Dumbledore , of people . The part where they think that they know what should be done . This simple action gave Harry a favorable impression of the oldman's morals.
" We had a schedule ?"
Was it….him?
" Haa-ah-ah! Sto---wait!" Draco wheezed out. His mouth rounded, his eyes widening to spill uncontrollable drops and his back arched forward. His pupils were shaking and shivering with pain, fear and shame at himself. Too much. It was all too much.
" Too many complications . If they try a next time , then attack won't be this simple " , Draco said.
Suddenly, a robust voice rang through the space, startling Harry.
But it felt nice to have someone worry about him and give him advice . It felt nice to be cared for . Thinking this , he fell asleep , thanking and resenting fate .
[ T/N :- What he actually wanted to say- What are you doing !?! Leave me this instance!!!! ]
" And don't tell both of them . They won't like it " she continued before resuming her strut .
Draco returned the look with lifted eyebrows and worried eyes as if saying,
Silent magic cleaned Draco as Harry drew the covers over him and was about to slip in as well when Ron came in .
Ignoring the embarrassment, Draco nonchalantly said , " well… What did the letters say ?"
How did he get those? Who poisoned him? Draco urgently needed to examine what kind of poison it was to make an antidote .
" Yes , little one ?" The smile was still there on his face as he looked at Draco in amusement .
Dr. Shipper
Smirking, Harry gradually lowered his hand . It was just about a hair's breadth away from Malfoy's head when it stopped and slowly drew back by itself.
" They all belong to me and now that you are my son , they all belong to you. "
In the Gryffindor dormitory, Harry lay in his bed staring at nothing and unable to sleep. His insomnia was getting worse. He was just about to close his eyes when he caught the sight of the invisibility cloak laying on top of his desk. At once, he got up and started to think about good night walk places in the Hogward's and eventually decided on the room of requirements. Harry hid in his cloak as he made his way to the room of requirements. After entering, the room was still empty. Looks like he does not need anything. So, he just sat down and unexpectedly thought of the scowling kitty he saw this morning. Harry knows that it's weird calling Malfoy 'kitty', but it definitely suits him well.
His eyes brightened with recognition, "I remember! That's Bathilda Bagshot, The author of «A History of Magic»!"
" Yeah "
Harry , Hermione and Pansy stood in the lift as the lift stopped again this time on level 3. As the door was about to open Harry calmly said , " If we don't find Umbridge within an hour then we find Ron and come back another day . Deal ? "
was sitting at some distance:
Setting himself beside Draco, Harry laid down as well. He needed sleep too. Exhaustion was clawing at his body and his temples were already throbbing. Pulling the blanket to cover them , Harry draped his arm over Draco's waist , laying his palm on the egg. Closing his eyes , he thought ,
Draco had his eyes wide as he struggled to get free . He realised his magic and tried to push himself forward but it was promptly suppressed by Harry .
" How long did you say this potion's gonna last ?"
The gryffindor table was oddly silent today and this did not escape Draco as he racked his eyes around  them . Catching Harry's eyes , Draco almost jerked back from fright but  caught himself and forcibly retracted his gaze . But this did not stop Harry from staring at him . And Draco felt a heavy gloom surround him , finding the reason for the silence at the other side . Hasty but mannered , Draco finished his breakfast and fled to the first class . Seeing Draco finish , Blaise and pansy rushed to follow him . Now-a-days, he had learnt not to try and decipher the saviour's glares towards him . They can cause extreme fright , nightmares and if in a bad shape , even fainting is possible .
Thinking that inside of this is a baby made Draco feel a sweet warmth in his chest as he tucked the egg inside his robes to keep it warm .
Ron heavily gulped . He said in a quivering voice, "umm.. Have you tried an umbrella?"
" How did it turn like this ? " Harry asked Draco, wary at the peculiar and unknown being.
The girth kept impaling him again and again and soon his body gave out. His eyes grew hazy and unfocused as his body slumped down, going soft on the bed.
An ache spread through his chest and the taste of bitter sorrow rose on his tongue.
As the house elf heard this, his eyes comically grew wide . Calling Mr. Malfoy master ? But they only call their Lord as master. Other than the Lord only his Lady is called Mistress and no other ….
" 5th generation ? How old are you?"
"She's already joined the camp, Potter."
" Thus, the blood pact is sealed . And with this , it will remain till the end of eternity, to break it shall mean to cease from existence, your soul and body, to keep it means to cherish the bond formed "
As soon as the car disappeared, Harry, not waiting for the arrival of order of Pheonix, slowly turned around to silently pick up a packed trunk . He needed to leave as well or who knows when the uninvited guests will arrive ? He took a last look around to see if he forgot something, as he did so, there was no emotion in his eyes. They were cold and hard. They were the eyes of a victor.
Harry's question sounded like an accusation to Draco , so he answered with all his fervour ," I told you . I don't know . All I did was give him some of my blood now and then "
Peeking down , he vengefully said, " What the fuck were you doing here ?!! "
Seeing Draco, she exclaimed in surprise, "Oh ! Welcome ! Is this young gentleman here to buy something ?"
A shuddering intake of breath sounded from Draco, his eyes alight with terror .
is what Harry thought when he looked at the frame. The young face was indeed the one he saw in his visions of Voldemort, particularly the vision where Voldemort looked into Gregorwitch's memories. He probably wanted what this boy stole.
Draco was already screaming in his head
" The night of the red moon two months back was when I snuck in the restricted library. I, initially, had no intention other than finding a cure for the dark mark there. But somehow activated an centuries old array there and bumped to papa. It was my good graces that he was a Malfoy and a healer otherwise traveling through the array would have possibly killed me. After that I somehow convinced him to leave with me "
" Professor, Do you know how she died? She died protecting me. She refused to step away . She was brave " Harry said solemnly.
Pansy sat at a distance , silently watching the enamoured look in Ron's eyes and the small smile on Hermione's face. And before she could stop herself , she stood up and walked towards the well structured back of the girl sitting in front of the piano.
Seeing Draco's happy expression and as if dumping cold water on his head , Luar explained ," Due to  constant pressure , nervousness and unstable emotions , your body and magic were in a highly alert state for a long time  . Adding to that , you are in your growing stage where your magic is particularly active as it adapts to nature , tries to form bonds and become stronger , same as yourself . But due to these circumstances , it's behaviour changed according to your emotions , making your body somewhat reject it , making it harder to move within and ultimately , making it harder to grow stronger . "
" Felix Felicis ! You have it, yes ? Use it ! This is the right time " ; Hermoine
" Draco is a descendant of my family, accompanying him is my responsibility, moral as well as delight ", Luar sounded offended at being asked this even after informing them that he was from the Malfoy line.
Draco , with a face as red as tomato , glared at the giggling man. His eyes were literally spitting fire.  Was it that entertaining to jab fun at him ?!? Hmph .  If he hadn't been his ancestor , Draco would have hexed him for sure !
Harry's eyes were dark and deep as if hiding an unavoidable grudge. He looked like a demon out to take a bloody revenge. And Draco did not remember anything he did to deserve it….. At least recently.
Draco fainted.
Draco's thoughts snapped and he came back. Looking at Theo's small and chubby face still somewhat puffed by baby fat , he smiled and said in a softer and reassuring tone , " it's nothing . Don't worry about it "
The care Potter subconsciously directed towards the egg wasn't casual. It seemed much more deliberate to the point that somehow it felt similar to how he treated Weasley and Granger. It might even be more but not less.
When Draco heard what Harry said, a strange sense of sour taste rose on his tongue. Did Potter think that Draco was weak ? Or did he think that he himself was soo omnipotent ?
Reaching the cave, Draco lowered himself down at the center of the cave. Taking out the vials he readied for possible accidents due to the ritual, he set them aside in a corner. He first made a huge array around himself followed by another protection array on the outside. Seating himself at the center of both those arrays, he called out Luar to help him through the process.
" I - well - nevermind . Let's get done with it. We are behind the schedule "
"YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE GOLDEN WARRIOR ? YOU DISGRACE TO MAGIC ITSELF !!! HOW CAN YOU NOT KNOW ME ?!  DO I LOOK LIKE A FOOL TO YOU ?", The voice, now furious, asked loudly. His anger was evident in his tone. One can imagine the scene to be perfect had there been an old man with red face and shaking beard in front of Harry, glaring at him with such anger that could burn the entire Hogward's to dust.
My dear cupcakes, please leave comments and kudos. I would love to communicate and know your opinion as well assure my heart that the chapters are not terrible.
Harry stepped a small step back as he whispered in the darkness ," I leave you for today , Malfoy , for the sole acknowledgement to your care . I won't let you off the next time ."
The man looked in his eyes as if searching for even a bit of invisible fear or hesitance , not finding any , he finally started .
Harry slowly caressed the stray hair on Draco's forehead and sighed, "I don't know. He said that he will be fine after some rest. But….
" I didn't " , she sighed.
Why ? What had he done wrong ? What had he done to suffer this ? Why ?
sounded and a huge egg was dropping from the air into his arms. A desperate sound was about to rip from Draco's throat when he remembered what Harry told and forcefully closed his throat up.
" I-i ...Ron got splinched. I wanted to take us to the grimmauld place but Yaxley followed us. So I took us here instead"
Draco, who was leisurely swimming in clouds , suddenly felt a stick poking him.
Such a clever technique to save oneself, isn't it ? Our golden boy sure is worth of being a snake, an especially venomous one .
Draco's eyes were wide in disbelief. Indirect apartion , as the name suggested, was a form of spell-less and wordless magic which aparated  someone without direct contact but with sheer magical force. It was something that even powerful wizards like Dumbledore found hard to achieve. The only one Draco knew who could successfully do it was the dark lord.
Harry shouted spells after spells at the animal as the pain in his scar kept increasing. Soon, the pain became unbearable and Harry took a step back as his gaze started swimming. Voices started swimming in his head,
"......My good brother, your words can't hold my bladder! Let me go before the rain shower takes place right here, right now!!!"
Smiling , his mom turned to him .
Giving him a small smile , he said ," Do you know that once I had a fish ? It was a wee little creature . I got it from a student of mine, you know…..One day on my desk, I found a small glass pot with only inches of clear water and floating on top was a petal. I watched as it sank down and just before it touched the bottom , it transformed into a fish . It was beautiful magic, you know . Beautiful…... The petal was from a lily . Your mother. Then one day , the fish just vanished . Gone , disappeared. It was the day your mother-"
Imagery of this thought seemed terrifying in Draco's head even if it would seem terrific in other's heads. Shaking his head and blowing his thoughts away , Draco opened his eyes and looked up at his newly acquired papa with even more newly acquired awe .
He aggrievedly frowned and again scanned Harry's body and magic, hoping to find anything, no matter how small. There must be something out of normal. How is it possible that 'it' left no clue?
Her poisonous glare turned to Draco as she said with a similarly poisonous tongue," Do it ! "
- the change in Harry from the views of people around him.
As soon as it touched the sheets, the damned thing started moving again.  Scared that it might fall down the bed again, Draco freed his hands from the comforter. Laying his arms on the white shell, he tried to steady it but instead of stopping it kept moving around even more at his touch.
Your mother .
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco thought of his own ring securely hanging on his neck . He always had it but he never wore it . On his twelfth birthday when he got it , he swore that he would wear this ring on the day he became the greatest potion master in the wizarding world , not just Europe. He knew that it was a big dream but he worked hard for it . He touched his chest to feel the ring inside . His eyes lowered and he appeared to be reminiscing in a memory with a melancholic feel . The look only lasted for a second before it flew away and Draco lifted his head and looked at the soul in front of him .
Draco didn't say anything but the look in his eyes gave Hermione and everyone else the feeling of being soothed and enveloped in a warm blanket . This was the feeling of being Draco Malfoy's person, they understood . This was the feeling of being under the wings of the famed notorious and heartless Slytherin price, so absurdly warm.
They didn't even realise when the baby who was the size of their forearm had grown and become a responsible young woman . The years went by so fast and now their small flower was in full bloom, beautiful and vibrant, spreading her sweet fragrance everywhere.
Outside the tent, a crowd huddled together not daring to go anywhere near the black-faced young master. All of them clearly heard the shout just now and also clearly saw the eyes spewing jets of fire.
As his knees gave out , Draco tumbled down. Harry's hand soon followed with a flick to stop him in mid air . His magic surrounded Draco , completely encompassing him. And his body went entirely pliant, hands hanging down and head thrown back with wide and surprised eyes with wheezing pants.
His wait didn't go to waste as soon Draco, who saw no hope of Harry leaving before he came, walked in the dining room and sat in the chair opposite of Harry.
- the slightly ominous Blaise/Neville bit.
With this extremely pleasant thought, the sharp edge in Harry's eyes disappeared like a cloud in clear blue sky.
Draco felt a sharp gaze on his neck which sent a cold shiver down his back. The feeling of being watched was so intense that it made him scared. He turned around and happened to catch Harry's eyes who turned to Ron and pretended as nothing happened. Seeing Harry, Draco's brain short-circuited and every memory that he forgot for last night came rushing back. His mouth fell open and in his head was running a marathon of "no no no no no no no no no no no NO !!!". He struggled with giving his usual scowl to Harry when he again caught his eyes and this time the dangerous feeling was so strong that he was paralyzed.
"Apparate !"
The bald head of the elf refused to rise still as his voice croaked , " A-aa-ah "
As both of them entered , they caught the attention of the woman. As she saw Ron in his new body , her eyes shined with tears and desperation, " Reg ! Reg , tell them what I am. Tell them , please " , ending with a sob.
"Ahh… Isn't that the brave Mr. Longbottom?"
How was your day today ? Mine was okay.
Hoarse and cracking wails and exclamations rang out from inside .
Dumbledore gazed at him with kind eyes before saying, " Good evening, Draco. What brings you here on this fine evening?" His voice was still calm, still steady even if it seemed a little frail.
Hermione was shocked, "No ! Harry ! You can't-"
A hard slap sounded as a palm hit Ron's head . And astonishingly, it was Pansy .
A slow smile and praising look shone on Harry's face as he said," Brilliant , Hermoine !"
" Upon your arrival in ministry , a wand was taken from you . Is this that wand ? " Umbridge said lifting a wand to display.
( Even though in egg form )
- Dr. Shipper
But Pansy, being the respectable, mannered and noble lady with the biggest pride, obviously couldn't say this to his face. So , before Draco could start another instruction manual on how to p*ss when you are on the run from your murderers and are camping in the middle of the forest, shouted with desperation.
Kreacher's eyes grew impossibly wide and it was as if the pieces of a scattered puzzle came together to make the ultimate picture. His eyes lit with fear and trepidation. But before Draco could understand why , the elf popped away leaving the sentence, "Thank you, Young Master. Now….. Kreacher will do….. wha~t Young master 7requested of …..Kreacher "
