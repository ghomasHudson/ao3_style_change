“Not right now,” Draco said.  “I thought that once you’re older and need to look for the final ingredient, these documents might help your search.”
Tentatively, Malfoy reached a finger out—and then his finger was on Harry’s forehead, tracing the lightning bolt scar.  The scar had not ached since Voldemort’s death, and yet Malfoy’s finger made it feel sensitive.  No one had touched him there in so long, except that when Harry had been a child, Draco had kept moving Harry’s hair to look at it.  Maybe he’d just been reminding himself the child he was dealing with was Harry Potter, but when they’d both been adults, he’d never looked at it.  He’d mentioned it a few times, but only when he was angry—after his mum had died.  After that kiss.
Draco was just sitting there, staring at the hearth.  His eyes looked empty, lifeless.  Like gravestones.  “Well,” Draco said.  “Diggory is dead.  Who needed him.  The true Hogwarts champion.”
she had said, and Harry tried to remind himself of it. His aunt and uncle had hurt him. They had hurt him.
“They’re generally safe,” Andromeda said, sounding amused.  “But Harry—you shouldn’t have ridden in one all by yourself.  How did you even find one?”
He wanted his smoothie, which was melting. He picked it up again. “I don’t want to dismiss what he did to me—to us. What anyone did to us. I want to remember. I want to respect it. But I don’t want it to—I don’t want to be owned by that. I want to . . . allow for possibility.”
Harry turned back to Draco, who was standing there with very ill-concealed longing in his large eyes.
Evening had fallen by the time Draco fell unconscious again, the gaps between ageing-up beginning to stretch into days instead of hours.  Harry’s Patronus alerted him that Draco had gone down, and Harry went upstairs to enlarge Draco’s clothes and make sure he was comfortable for the hours he’d be unconscious.  Just as Harry was getting Draco arranged, however, Draco gasped, which wasn’t right.  It was too soon, but Draco was still unconscious, clutching his left arm.
Jumping up, Harry realized he wasn’t in his own pyjamas either.  He didn’t even have pyjamas, just old shorts, and sometimes Dudley’s castoffs—but these were real pyjamas, soft and warm and cottony.  White, with blue stripes.  Mister Malfoy must have done it, and panicking, Harry remembered bad old men, but he was more concerned about the bed, which he shouldn’t have slept in.  He’d told Mister Malfoy—
“Yes,” Kavika said gently. “And how it will make you feel in the moment? With all your students assuming you’ve done something terrible?”
“Better get back,” Malfoy said abruptly. Then he was brushing by Harry—he had to, in the small space of the loo, his shoulder touching Harry’s as he made his way out the door.
“He failed,” Dumbledore said, and Harry remembered Malfoy, shaking as he faced Dumbledore on the Tower. The memory faded, and Dumbledore vanished.
“Harry!”  Draco fell to his knees, and then he was touching Harry’s shoulders, his hair, his hands, his chest.  “Are you okay?”
Harry stared at them, the crystal toy gone slack in his hand. He stared at them for a while, because they had a taxidermy leopard, and dressed like Trewlaney, and had said he was early when he was on time. All of this, and he still felt better than he had with any other therapist so far. “Yeah,” he said, eventually. “It does suck.”
Harry vaguely remembered that, mostly because Draco had answered the question of what he wanted to be when he grew up years later.  “I wasn’t trying to insult you,” Harry said, spreading his hands.  “I was trying to get to know you.”
He wasn’t even meant to be alive. He should have died in that forest; he should have died a thousand times. Sometimes, before his eleventh birthday, Harry used to think,
won’t marry him,” Kavika said. “For one thing, you’ve told me you’re still seeing Vincius. For another,
Harry didn’t know what righteous indignation was either, but as he followed Draco he decided to ask about the weirder word instead.  “What’s a Slytherin?”
“I—I liked to wear ribbons.  In my hair.  Mum would plait it.  It—we knew it wasn’t—no one ever saw us, except Father.  It was just for fun.”
Teddy he’d had them, and Harry wondered whether Draco would ever have volunteered anything like that to Harry.
“I guess not.”  The unhappy look on Draco’s face tugged at his soft cheeks, making his eyes so big, his pink mouth a little bud.
Harry looked at him, feeling as though a chasm separated them and Harry was frozen.  He couldn’t even move to reach across.
Shuffling a bit so Harry could balance himself on one hand and his knees while his other hand touched himself, Harry wrapped his hand around his big thick cock.
After that, Draco stopped trying to help him.  They were closer to an even match than they had been, since Harry could cast drafts of wind to carry Draco this way or that, though Draco knew a lot of manoeuvres to force his broom in the direction he wanted.  Meanwhile Harry didn’t know nearly as much about manoeuvring, but he was small and found that meant he was faster than Draco.
As quickly and quietly as he could, he climbed the stairs all the way to the top, stopping at the landing to listen for intruders.  When he didn’t hear anyone, Harry continued to old-him’s room.  The fawn, who had followed him up, continued to follow him into the room.
“I can’t understand what you mean. The whole world’s going perfectly. Reveal’s in the toilet; we’ve lost Shacklebolt, and the Council might appoint a criminal of war. What’s not to love?”
Then Malfoy turned from the window, and his face was not quite his face. “Malfoy?” Harry said, and the face-that-was-not-quite-Malfoy’s face slid into a wider, lower brow, a smaller mouth, skin a shade darker. “Teddy.”
Penelope was still talking, and Harry tried to focus on the words, the sound of them, the smell of the room, all that breath, the taste of it. “Isn’t the one who did this more likely to be an outsider, rather than a trainee?” she was saying. “There are still Death Eaters out there who—”
Harry put it in his mouth, and the dildo shallowly began to move in and out of its own accord. Draco had cast a spell on it, and Harry moaned in pleasure. Then Draco was moving behind him, the press of something against Harry’s hole, and—yes. Yes. Draco’s prick was thick and heavy and perfect, where it belonged, inside of him.
A cream-coloured cloak with a blond head above it slipped between two people in the crowd and disappeared.
Draco leaned back on the couch again, falling so quiet during this story that Harry was half sure Draco had fallen asleep.  As soon as Harry was done, however, Draco shot up, a bit of hair falling over his forehead.  “I’ve never seen a swamp-thing,” he said.  “Are they big?”
“There are things happening within the current administration that that kind of pure-blood dowager aunt doesn’t like,” Harry pointed out. “Having a someone from an Old Blood family in law enforcement could provide a form of leverage.”
Malfoy took another big breath, but when he spoke, his voice was different—softer, somehow.  “Haven’t you ever . . . in the war, when no one believed you.  Didn’t you want to—prove yourself?”
Harry was going to have to explain it all at some point, seeing as how the cure apparently had to be administered to Draco and not him.  “It’s called Life Water,” Harry began.
“I want to know how the negotiations with Number Ten are going,” Harry said, not because he had to, not because they couldn’t focus on him. Now that he had thought it through, he could ask without resenting it, because he loved Hermione, and he wanted to know.
“They didn’t kill anybody, in that instance.  Well, actually, they did.  One Death Eater accidentally killed another Death Eater.”
Just Draco’s head turned on the sofa, his body still draped across it.  “You said he died for someone he loved.  Who?”
Unable to stand it any longer, Harry touched him—Teddy’s shoulder, his solid, unhurt shoulder, and then his back, and then Harry was embracing him.
.  But of course, Draco never would have said such things about another child.  He never could have—not with the way he had treated Harry as a child.  He’d been so kind, so generous, so fiercely protective.  Now that Harry had grown up again and could see his own child-self through Draco’s grown-up eyes, Harry knew; he knew what it had looked like, that Draco had seen what Harry’s childhood had been.  Draco had seen it, and he’d done everything he could to make something safer and kinder, something loving for a child who had never had a glimpse of what real love could be.
When Draco turned twenty-two, Harry entered Tailored Tinctures to find Draco in the lab.  The second Harry put his foot in the door and saw Draco, however, Harry froze.
“I don’t suppose you could stop me,” Harry agreed.  “I just don’t want you to disappear.  Or fight me every time.”
“Harry,” Draco said, low and eager and affectionate in Harry’s ear, and then his hand was wrapping around Harry’s cock again, this time slick with lube.
“Some people like it a lot,” Draco murmured, and Harry felt as though he could feel the blood being dragged into his cock, forcing it to rise, and rise, forcing it to stand. “Now, hold it like that,” Draco said, as though Harry had any control over his cock at all, but the coaxing strokes of Draco’s wand in the air above Harry’s body stopped, and Draco pointed his wand at Harry’s balls, still loose and relaxed with just having come. Pointed at the air above the testicles, Draco’s wand made a swift, tight circle in the air, and something inside Harry tightened. Inside, where the glands had been loose and relaxed from just having come, the tissue snapped back to create tension and readiness to come again.
Kavika’s face went softer, warm with something almost like pity and exactly like compassion. “Perhaps that’s why he concerns you so. If he who matters least can change, perhaps that matters most.”
Duggins scribbled notes on his pad, so Harry waited. The office was drab, like Robards office in the Auror Department, a non-descript room with a non-descript desk, non-descript chairs, non-descript degrees framed on the wall from non-descript magical universities, even though there were only sixteen in the whole world. There were no windows.
A few weeks later, Harry caught a glimpse of the cuts on Travers’s arm in Level Two Advanced Wandless Combat. Deciding to keep a special eye on Travers, in case he was in trouble or hurting himself, Harry then noticed the old mud on the edge of Travers’s cloak. Then Harry remembered Travers’s boggart, and other pieces began to fall into place: the fact that Travers still sometimes used the world “Muggle;” the fact that Travers had got high marks in dark sigils; the fact that Travers was sometimes late to class. Blood had to come from somewhere, and enough didn’t add up about Travers that Harry began to keep watch over his dot on the map.
He should have called someone.  He shouldn’t have tried to do it by himself, only Draco didn’t want anyone to see him this way, and Hermione and Ron were still under the influence of something, and Harry didn’t know who else was involved.  The only thing that remained was to wait and hope the potion worked.
“Come on, darling,” Draco said. “I want to rut my cock on your face. I want hot come all over your cheeks. I want it in your eyelashes.”
“I’d have a lot fewer if I could use magic,” Malfoy said, stacking the bottles and things to one side of his tray.  “I could probably do all of this with just a few spells.”
Eventually, Draco stopped shuddering, so still that Harry thought he might be sleeping.  Draco’s breathing hadn’t changed, though, although the light in the room had.  “Do you want Andromeda?” Harry asked, after another fifteen minutes or so.
Harry thought about what he could change, what he could influence, the power that he had. “Myself,” he said finally.
“All right,” Harry said, once warm-ups were over. “Everyone pair up. These will be your sparring partners for the next few weeks, so get cozy.”
That evening Draco didn’t make his nose hairs grow, but he did make the floor have fur.  It purred when Harry stepped on it, and then Draco made their sofa float so that they weren’t sitting on the fur floor.  He zoomed the sofa around the room for a while, then shrank the sofa so they could zoom out the window.  On the roof, Draco enlarged the sofa again, and Heloise swooped down from wherever she had been, landing on one of the arms of the sofa.  Harry got to pet her again, and Draco showed him more stars.
“Now you know how I handle stress,” said Yin. “Therapy, wine, crying—in that order. Do you want to tell me what it’s been like without a regular therapist, or does ‘it sucks’ cover it?”
Malfoy had whipped his head around to glare at Teddy, but the violent flush was already fading from his cheeks. Harry had a class to teach, and the other sparring partners were stopping to look at them.
A few times Malfoy called by Floo with his potions ID, but the first time Malfoy visited Grimmauld Place, Harry was surprised.
“When I get to Hogwarts, I’m going to ignore you.  I’ll make friends with other people—people Mother and Father will like.  They wouldn’t like you.  And I don’t like you either.”
“Not exactly.” Rune moved his hands when he talked, enthusiastic and fluid. “The plan is to get non-magicals on our side, that they wouldn’t
“What, so they can get a slap on the wrist?” said Spragg. “When will you realize the institution is broken?”
to be, because there are so few pure-blood families left that they all need to mate and reproduce, propagate, and why? He doesn’t even believe in it, or if he does, he doesn’t want it. He doesn’t want it. Love isn’t enough.”
Of course, Andromeda would forgive anything that child-Draco did or said; she might not have had first-hand experience with his “warped prejudice,” but she’d had experience enough with her sisters.  She would know what she was getting into—but that wasn’t what Harry was worried about.  The issue wasn’t whether Andromeda could forgive Draco.  The issue was whether Draco could forgive himself.
“Please.” Harry could hear that he was whining, drilling his arse down against the pillow in hungry circles, as though that could get him what he needed. “Please, I love begging, I love it, I need it; I need it.”
“They’re liars, Harry,” Draco said, selecting a different book from the shelf.  He came back over to the sofa.  “They’re liars, and you never have to go back to them, not if you don’t want to.  I’m going to fix this.”
“It can fuck you whenever I want,” Draco said. “As hard as I want. As fast as I want it. You like the thought of being filled up and fucked with a toy. Don’t you, Harry?”
“It makes sense,” said Penelope. “The Board’s old wizard money, aristocrats—Bickford, Fudge, Pillwickle, that lot. Of course, they want to keep the status quo; taking down the secrecy wards and revealing the wizarding world to Muggles would be a disaster for them—and people like Spragg play right into their hands. Spragg thinks he’s keeping the poor innocent Muggles safe from our nasty magic ways. He doesn’t realize he’s completely buying into the underlying Concealer agenda to keep bloodlines Muggle-free.”
“Oh,” Harry said, surprised. “I mean, they’re Malfoy’s, so—they’re fine. I mean, he wouldn’t—he would have at one time. But he wouldn’t hurt me.”
Silence fell over the room like a door shutting between them, invisible and impenetrable. Milligan swallowed. “Maybe you can tell me more about Vinicius,” she said finally. “That way, we can drill down to what you really want to say about him.”
“I’m not . . . trying to,” Harry eventually said, not exactly sure he knew what Sibanyoni was saying. “I try to be open. Since Ginny. And since I started getting therapy. I try to talk about what I feel.”
“Yes?” Harry hazarded. “He knows about the nightmares. I mean, we slept together. And he knows I go to therapy, and the anxiety . . . I think that’s part of why he wanted to end it. The problems that I have. He imagined that I would be a hero, and instead . . . I was me.”
Something shook Harry’s shoulder, but Harry was warm, even if his head was on something kind of hard.  He didn’t want to wake up.
“Was that that famous Thai wizard?” Ron asked, after both Malfoy and Rune had swept off onto the dance floor. Ron had apparently finished romancing Greengrass, and had joined him by the canapés, holding five of them on the palm of his large hand and eating one after another. “Photsi? Someone?”
“I’m only eleven!” Draco went on, as though reading Harry’s thoughts.  “I—I haven’t done anything yet.  I don’t have to be your friend.”
rude, and also a big baby.  Harry didn’t want to be a baby, and he especially didn’t want Draco thinking he was a baby.
“When you made new clothes and put them in the bathroom, were they the pyjamas?  Did you just keep making new clothes out of the same clothes over and over?”
“Pansy!” Malfoy was yelling, stomping around a well-appointed sitting-room.  “Pansy!  I want to talk to Pansy Parkinson!”
Draco’s gaze flicked up quickly.  “That—was only part of the reason, Harry.  The other things I said were also true.”
Harry had seen the jumper many times over the course of the last year, a large, shapeless thing that covered up his figure—which was basically his only decent physical quality, George would have been pleased to learn. Malfoy’s shape had been good before, but he had put on a bit of weight in the past three years, in the form of muscle. Probably all that hand-to-hand. The jumper was frayed at the hems, threads coming loose everywhere.
“You’re a Concealer, I’ll wager,” Penelope was saying, here, now, in the present. “With your sister on the Council pretending to be ‘neutral.’ I’ll bet she’s the reason Shacklebolt’s lost his coalition.”
“I don’t care if he downs three Felix Felicis potions and bloody aces it,” Harry said. “You still have to do the coursework, and he hasn’t.”
“You don’t think Fairchild and her boyfriend should wait until they’re engaged,” Ron asked, “like the Statute says?”
“I don’t know,” Harry said.  “At first, I thought it was because I’d helped your mum, and maybe you were afraid you could get in trouble if you didn’t help me.  But then . . .”
“Yes, you can,” Malfoy said quietly. “You’re Harry Potter. You could crush me under your big toe, and no one would care.”
Next Draco made the shadows dance into the shapes of big spindly-legged birds that kept falling over, which made Harry smile again.
“Some of them,” Draco conceded.  “Have you ever played chess?  I believe I’ve heard of a Muggle variation.”
“But your shop,” Harry went on, realizing he didn’t want to leave.  It was such a nice place, nicer than any place he’d ever been before.  He’d never even been inside any of the cupboards.
to hear that it bothered him, that Malfoy would not have accepted their interference, that he would have been ashamed of it, disgusted by it, that he would reject it and condemn it as anyone rightfully should. Harry wanted to hear that Malfoy really was a different person, that he could stand up for once, and do something brave. “You don’t need my permission,” Harry said instead.
Pulling out the parchment from his satchel again, Harry checked the number.  It was the correct address.  Harry reached for the handle on the door.
In the sitting room, only one chair sat by the fire—the floral, wingback one, but Mister Malfoy pointed his wand at it and it stretched, becoming wide enough for them both to sit.  Harry waited until Mister Malfoy sat down, then tentatively sat on the edge, still confused.  Aunt Petunia used to tell Dudley he would “ruin his dinner,” when he ate too many sweets, but Harry had never understood it.  Now he understood, not only having ruined his dinner but having ruined afters as well and having got sick on top of that, which was always a bad thing to do.  He didn’t understand why Mister Malfoy wasn’t angry with him.
Malfoy stood up, pacing over to the window. The breezy tone was gone, but his voice was still soft. “If I don’t, I’ll regret it for the rest of my life,” he said. “I already regret it. I’ve regretted it for—I wish I had been brave. I wish I had been a braver person, that I could face—well. I wish I could have faced things. Then.”
Self-conscious, Harry put his hand to his shorn head.  He probably shouldn’t have done it like that.  He’d just wanted Malfoy to get what he needed.
He felt so, so sick, his stomach tight over all the food, so tight it felt like bursting.  His throat was beginning to dry up even as his mouth was watering.  He didn’t understand why his mouth was watering; he couldn’t stand the thought of eating more.  Even the smell of it was beginning to make him nauseated and then he realized—he was nauseated.  His stomach was turning over in his body.  He was going to sick up.  Harry dropped the fork again.
Malfoy was still looking ill, but now he also looked annoyed.  “It’s obviously a potion to get inside people’s minds while they’re sleeping.”
“And who are you, anyway?  You never answered me.  You’re extremely uninformative for an Auror.  Who’s your boss?”
Harry looked where Draco pointed, seeing nothing but blue sky and rolling green.  When he looked back at Draco, however, Draco was holding the little gold ball in his hand, smiling at Harry triumphantly.
When he didn’t say anything, Harry loosened up a little. He’d been pressing Draco down into the bed. “It’s not meant to be a test, Draco.”
“Did you enjoy your birthday?” Nyala asked Andromeda, as George and Angelina rolled away into the Floo.
“What . . .”  Pity wasn’t quite right for what shone in Mister Malfoy’s eyes.  Maybe he thought it was funny.  “What did you want to build?”
“I don’t know,” Harry said, mostly because he hoped it meant Penelope wouldn’t continue to ask questions about the Order.
“Yes,” Penelope said, then turned to Savage and Spragg, her voice growing louder. “The Board is meeting now. Can’t you two wait until we have a better understanding of the situation? We don’t even know exactly what
Draco hadn’t been to sleep at all, Harry realized.  He’d been in here the whole night, chopping up mouse ears, except he’d stopped to make Harry breakfast and transfigure him clothes.  For some reason it made Harry’s chest hurt like something that was really sad, only it shouldn’t have, because it was nice.
Harry came farther into his office. He wanted to apologize to Teddy, for not fighting harder to see that Malfoy passed. For the fact that Malfoy’s marriage had been ruined. For the fact that the Board of Regents existed, and Neo Death Eaters. Harry wanted to apologize that he had held a press conference so that Travers would be expelled. He wanted to apologize to Teddy for his parents dying, and for the fact that Lupin would not leave Hogwarts. “Are you going to the celebration at the pub?”
Spragg’s voice had a pleasant cadence that always made it sound like he was saying something deeply meaningful, and Harry was still remembering another table, inside a Pensieve, only now he was beginning to recognize it. At the Trials the memories of the Death Eaters had been projected into the room, and Harry sometimes remembered them as though he had been there. At times, he had; at the trials, he’d seen Cedric’s death through seven pairs of eyes.
“I came twice inside you, Harry.” Draco’s voice was soft. “My prick won’t be able to do it again unless I cast the spell. Do you want me to? So I can come inside you again?”
Harry’s breath caught. He wasn’t sure whether Astoria knew that he had wanted to follow Malfoy, or whether she really just wanted cake. Regardless, Harry had seen the look in Malfoy’s eyes—that panicked, overwhelmed look, that look that Harry knew. Harry knew it so well; he had felt it himself before—in contentious staff meetings, at crowded parties—but he had also felt it before with people that he liked, people that he loved. He’d felt it with Ginny, sometimes with Teddy, sometimes with Rose and Hugo and the Weasleys, that feeling of holding too much at once.
“The same.” Harry sipped his coffee, then realized how that sounded. “But different. It was actually the same,” he added, then started again. “What I meant was, one of the trainees asked if I stopped being an Auror because—I had PTSD. And I said what I usually do: ‘That’s between me and my therapist; this class is for training, et cetera’—but I could see Teddy’s face. You know how he is. Quiet. He’s used to me and—reporters. He’s fine letting me handle it.”
Malfoy shrugged again.  “I don’t suppose that matters.  I’m obviously my own person.  I bet I’ve done all sorts of things he wouldn’t expect.”  He pressed the scale again, absently watching it jump.  “What’s Dad up to, anyway?”  He whirled around.  “
Within the Academy walls, people knew not to ask Harry press questions, but a few people wanted to commiserate, and from this Harry gleaned that somehow an owl Teddy had sent to him from Hogwarts had been tracked and intercepted. This was how the reporters had learned that Harry had talked to Teddy about not being an Auror, and by the time Harry got to his office he just felt tired and sick of it, wanting peace.
The initiate was likely just eighteen, barely out of Hogwarts, stars still in his eyes over the thought of being taught by Harry Potter.
“I wonder what that feels like.” Another pause settled around the room, filling the shadows the light was vacating. “I see,” Malfoy said abruptly. “You could never not be Harry Potter. I’m sorry for suggesting it.” Then he walked forward, grabbing the badge so that Harry had to flail to grab a hold so that Malfoy didn’t port without him.
“Do you know where this is?” Harry asked, backing up another step.  “Because I don’t remember getting here, and if you’ve kidnapped me . . .”  Harry broke off because he didn’t quite know what would happen if he had, in fact, been nabbed.  Vernon would probably thank the man for his efforts.
“Shh,” Harry said, hand still tight around Draco’s cock. “Shh. You’re so responsive, Draco. It’s so fucking hot.”
The worst Robards could do if Harry went to Malfoy was sack him, and Harry doubted that would happen.  Sacking Harry Potter would look bad to the press, and Robards was all about image.  Harry could get suspended again, but that could also look bad when Harry solved this case—particularly since Harry knew reporters at the
Apparently, the same figure had caught Malfoy’s attention also, because the memory of Malfoy quite abruptly severed the conversation he’d been having with the Macmillan, giving his drink to Greengrass. “I’ve something I must attend to,” Malfoy said. “Pardon me.” He even gave a little bow as he excused himself.
“Why-ever not?” Malfoy asked. When Travers made a face, Malfoy went on. “We were friends. Or we would’ve been,” Malfoy added quickly, “had I been the friends-having type.” When Travers seemed unconvinced by this, Malfoy said, with all the triumphant grace of someone who had thought up something clever, “You invited me to the pub!”
Mister Malfoy’s laughter faded, and for a second, he almost looked sad.  “Oh, Harry,” he said, and stopped.
That was fine. He did some little games Kavika had taught him with his wand, lighted dots that chased each other, to pass the time. All the kids were doing it these days. Harry felt much better. No one else came in to use the toilet.
“If you sat closer, I could put this part of it on your lap,” Draco went on, demonstrating by budging closer.  “And here so we’re not squashed, I’ll put my arm around you this way, and you can turn the pages.”
“And should that not be the job of Aurors?” Pillwickle’s long face was placid, calm. “Since when did we allow citizens to take the law into their own hands? Bernard.”
The bloke began handing out plates to Malfoy’s little army, who had apparently ordered food sometime between their dramatic entrance and now, a time during which Harry had also failed to realize that the gorgeous bald woman was Astoria. Of course she was, with her fine, delicate features, her beautifully arched brows, her flashing green eyes. The haircut was what had thrown Harry off—but no, that obviously wasn’t the only thing. It was the way Malfoy was sat so close to her, the way she unconsciously touched him, the way he smiled at her. Harry had only assumed she would be devastated: a pure-blood daughter whose engagement had been dissolved by her own father upon learning her own fiancé was not only a blood traitor, but worse yet, gay.
“Yes,” Harry said slowly, beginning to think he’d misinterpreted this whole conversation.  “Very greasy.”
Ron looked at him quickly, but then Malfoy was there, smirking and proud and happy. “Life of the party over here, innit?”
The next day, May 20, 2019, at nine in the morning, Aurors across the United Kingdom dropped the wards that hid the magical world from the non-magical, ending the Statute of Secrecy that had been in place for nearly four hundred years. It happened with no warning for most non-magical people in the UK, though the efforts of several Orders of the Phoenix had worked furiously for the last few months to enact as much of the spirit of the Deal as possible.
Vinicius made a noise. “I didn’t mean Rune Photsi levels of hot, Harry. Let’s at least be realistic.”
“For instance,” Hermione said seriously, still looking at Ron, “Harry could tell us about Vinicius.”
“Patience, pet,” Draco said, gripping Harry’s hair to pull him away. “Let me get it nice and hard for you.” Then he was casting the spell on himself that dragged the blood up into his cock, and by now, the spell was really beautiful to Harry. It looked like conducting music, like urging an artform; it really did look like Draco was sculpting his own cock, drawing fluid inside him into it. Inches from Harry’s face it rose, and rose.
“I know,” Harry said again. His hand moved over the back of his fist. “I sometimes don’t always know how, but I try. I’m trying.”
The voice was a little Kavika’s but also a little Harry’s own, the list of people to see when he could not see her. The list of people who could provide
Doctor Yin looked at him, their dark eyes bright. “That’s very admirable, Harry,” they said at last. “Just keep in mind that possibility doesn’t have to be an obligation.”
“It’s a vulnerable position to be left in.” Yin’s voice was gentle. “Bleeding. Invisible. Unable to move. What do you think Malfoy thought of it?”
“You like him, but you don’t love him.” Milligan sounded as though she had heard this before, but not in a bad way. Her tone was very compassionate. “Is that what you wanted to talk about?”
Picking up a spoon for the sugar, Mister Malfoy made a disbelieving sound.  “What makes you think he doesn’t like you?  Sometimes he doesn’t want to play games your way?”
Harry had been about to tell Yin that it didn’t matter; whether Malfoy was good-looking was beside the point. Whether Malfoy was good-looking should not at all be a part of a conversation about whether Malfoy could send him little breezes, and yet it felt important. Lately, it felt like a central question in Harry’s whole life. “Anyone?”
Even though Draco was already pink, he still flushed again. His body was radiating heat like a furnace; Harry was beginning to sweat even though he hadn’t done anything. “It’s just—not what I had in mind,” Draco said, sounding so unhappy. “I don’t even like the word dick.”
“It feels like I would be hurting myself!” Harry said, startling himself. “It feels like it would be unfair to me, to that person I was, who was hurt, to the person
Harry knew how the indicator solution worked.  He’d tested it himself, all those years ago with Malfoy—if someone hadn’t had any crocodile tears, nothing changed colour.  Which meant that either Savage’s desk was covered in crocodile tears, or something else was wrong.  Decanting the solution back into the bottle, Harry followed it up with a disillusionment.
Smiling ruefully, Harry played with his cup some more. “It’s nice, getting to choose. But I have to admit it would also be nice to have a therapist just now, if you don’t mind me saying.”
Harry took his thumb out, which made Malfoy say, “Good,” again.  Taking a flannel off his tray, he began to reach again, then stopped and gave Harry the flannel.  “So you can dry your thumb.”  Malfoy snatched something else off the tray—a bottle of red pills.  “I haven’t got a name for these yet.  If you’ve got anything cursed in your lungs, they’ll make you sneeze it out.”
“This is hard for me. You and I—it’s hard for me. After what you did to me. To people I love. After what you did at Hogwarts, and in the war.”
Putting the years together in his head, Harry grabbed the phial of Dream Dram from Savage.  “Do you know anything about this?” he said, shoving the phial under Malfoy’s nose.
Harry frowned.  Even if Malfoy had been a prat and a Death Eater and just generally the worst, calling him that seemed out of line.
Then at last, Harry’s trousers were down far enough. Draco rocked back on his heels, as though to assess a prize he had won, and hooked his fingers on the waistband of Harry’s pants. His eyes were huge, hopeful, flicking up to Harry and then back to the waiting cock, already wet at the tip and aching. At last, he popped Harry’s pants down, revealing Harry’s bare cock.
Reading that letter, Harry wasn’t sure whether Draco could, and Harry wanted to save him from it.  He wanted to save Draco’s elder self from everything; he wanted to give child-Draco the cure and have him grow back up into someone who had some happy memories of Harry Potter in his childhood.  He wanted Draco to grow back up into someone who understood that he was more than his mistakes, that he could be loved in spite of them—he could be loved for the person he had become because of them.
Draco turned his head so that the weight of it rested on the side of his face, his hands still moving warmly on their cocks, Harry’s balls. “I wish I had another hand,” Draco said, “so I could touch you more.”
Harry whirled, and behind him stood Teddy, his hair green, his suit green, the light of Avada Kedavra in his eyes, green.
The way Malfoy said it made Harry finally stop and take notice.  Malfoy was pale, trembling almost—with anger or something else, Harry wasn’t quite sure.  Malfoy’s eyes were bright.  “Malfoy,” Harry said, and stopped.  He had picked a fight, he realized, and it had never really been about Malfoy.
As such, Harry was reluctant to leave Draco with Andromeda, but the only alternatives Harry could see were to leave Draco alone or bring Draco with him to the warehouse.  Despite the Seeing-Eye Ball and various protections Harry could set up, bringing him would be potentially dangerous.  Then again, Dumbledore had sent Harry into dangerous situations all the time.  When Harry thought about what could happen to child-Draco, he wondered how Dumbledore could have done it.  Dumbledore must have had his reasons, and yet Harry felt certain adult-Draco would never do that.  Andromeda might have.  Hermione wouldn’t.  Draco had lost his mind over Harry riding a taxi, and Harry was beginning to suspect that Dumbledore wasn’t the best example for how a grown-up should act.
“Get off me.”  Trying to push it off, Draco’s hand went right through it.  His lip curled in an ugly expression.  “Get it off me.”
Another silence followed. “Are you telling me about Bennet for a reason, Harry?” Kavika said quietly.
The confusion must have shown on Harry’s face, because Fudge went on to say, “The bias against pure-bloods.”
Banishing the food, Harry came into the sitting room and closed the door, then followed Draco into the kitchen.  He was in the loo, kneeling before the toilet.  “Draco!” Harry rushed toward him, but Draco put out a hand.
“I’ll tell you; I’m sorry; let go.”  Harry yanked on the parchment, but Malfoy still held onto the other end.  “Malfoy—Draco.  Let go.”  With a final tug, Harry got the parchment away.
“Many of these aren’t Pot—your cases,” Draco said, correcting himself, “and there are a great deal of files.  I wonder if you were cross-referencing older Ministry cases to look for a pattern that matched your current suspect.”
Harry could feel how hot he was now, blood pumping desperately to escape his skin, escape, escape. He couldn’t Apparate within the Academy, and the doors were too crowded with too many people to stop him on the way. Harry just needed a minute to himself, just a minute to think and be alone and catch his breath, just a minute without anyone else, the toilet. He needed to get to the toilet, just for a minute alone.
“Good.  I didn’t excel at Muggle studies, but I didn’t think I had failed so dismally.”  Draco swung the door open further.  “I’ve made breakfast, if you’re hungry.”
“It’s not ever going to go away,” Kavika said in her low rasping voice. “You know this. I’m very sorry, Harry.”
Kavika spelled the beans to grind, getting out the cups she always used, the small pot with the long handle, where she put the grounds, then spelled the water, leaving it to steep.
Rune flashed one of his energetic smiles. “I was just saying, the organization I want to start. We could build a coalition with non-magicals, starting with the families of non-magicalborns. That’s where former Minister Shacklebolt’s organization can be leveraged,” Rune said, turning back to Harry.
Draco had quite liked Weasley Wizard’s Wheezes, which Harry had thought he might.  Lots of it was rather mean-spirited, and Draco himself had always been rather mean-spirited, sometimes in funny ways.  Draco and George should probably never meet as adults, and Draco wanted to buy all sorts of horrible odds and ends to prank people with.  Harry bought them all, even though Draco wasn’t going to have time to prank anybody at this age, and then they went back to Tailored Tinctures.
Harry spelled the food off the floor onto the plate, then charmed it clean.  “I’ll just leave this in the kitchen under a warming spell for you,” he said, because Draco had obviously eaten some of the breakfast—though a precious little.
“Why?  You keep staring at me as though I ‘almost killed your best friend and got your two favourite professors killed, and kept calling your friend a Mudblood and had her tortured at my house’, so why do I need to look at you?  I know what you think.”  Draco glanced up at him from under his lashes—just like he used to do when he was eleven when he’d pretend he wasn’t looking, only this was different.  “Despite what you’ve told me.”
“Is moving nicely genetic?” Teddy wanted to know, then turned to Nyala. “We were discussing Black family genes.”
, Harry almost said, but he didn’t know why. Malfoy went, tall and straight and still unattractive, but Harry noticed something elegant in his shape, something gentle in his gait that almost blurred him, like a ghost. He’d cast the Notice Me Nots on himself, so that even though Harry had known he was there, his presence wouldn’t impose.
Harry turned to look at him uncomprehendingly, and Malfoy’s expression broke all over into softness. “Come,” he said lowly, taking Harry by the arm, so gently, leading him to Harry’s desk, his chair. “Sit,” Malfoy told him, so Harry sat.
They were both examining memories from the Ward Record in Tailored Tinctures when Draco’s hand gripped Harry’s shoulder, yanking him out of his Pensieve.
This year’s exam schedule was a little tight, due to Reveal. The Council was working on a vote of no confidence for Fudge, which—if passed—could mean another stay on Reveal to allow for a new Ministry and a new chance at the Deal. If, however, the vote didn’t pass, Reveal would happen on the date it was last scheduled, without a Deal. Since the Auror Department needed all the help it could get if Reveal happened without a Deal, graduation date for the Academy was being pushed up so new Aurors could immediately be certified and help out.
“That’s a very Slytherin definition of lying.”  Draco had opened the book and was doodling with his wand again.
“Accio banana.” A banana shot out from behind a magically lit globe and into Doctor Yin’s hand. “Accio kiwi,” they said next, and a kiwi bounced out of an equally improbable location. “Term just started, didn’t it? How was that?” Putting various items in what appeared to be an old non-magical blender, Doctor Yin pointed their wand at it, and it began to grind.
Taking the scroll, Harry opened it up.  It was filled with words, but it didn’t look like a potion.  “Yes,” was all he said, since he was pretty sure that was what Draco wanted him to say.
Harry had changed the bunkbeds back into Draco’s original bed, mostly so Harry could see Draco more easily.  He’d also enlarged Draco’s pyjamas, because Draco was meant to be twelve after this first bit, and twelve was larger than eleven.  Harry didn’t know how much larger, because he’d been smaller then as well, so Harry had just guessed.  Draco had seemed to grow into the pyjamas without dying or suffering severe bodily harm, so that was good.  That was great.  Harry made himself breathe.
Slowly, Harry shook his head. “No. He doesn’t—I don’t think he has friends. Not there, at any rate.”
“But I just want you to know.” Malfoy took another step closer after all. “When you’re waking up from nightmares, cold sweats; when you’re jumping, because Apparition is too loud, or someone casts a spell unexpectedly; when you’re panicking, because people are yelling, and it feels like they might fight. When it feels like you can’t breathe, when you don’t know what to do with your hands, when you wake up crying and you don’t know why—”
More slowly, Harry got off the broom, looking around. His office was peaceful and quiet, despite the noise and chaos outdoors. “Did you seal off my office?”
Teddy just shrugged again.  “He said he did.  He said he was pretty wild.  Leather trousers, and all.”
to pay for his little wizard-fight lessons?” Greengrass looked amused, sharing this bit of gossip. “He hasn’t a penny to his name.”
Malfoy glanced toward the front of the shop, then back at the floor.  “I already told you.  I have to order the shelves.”
“What do you expect me to do without a sample?” said Malfoy’s disdainful voice.  “Why didn’t you go to St. Mungo’s?”
“This reminds me,” Ron said, glancing around. “I should check with Hermione. I likely have schmoozing to do.”
Harry watched as Malfoy cast spells on his hands to protect them, then thrust them through the magic shield charms to open the bottle.  The pink powder poofed everywhere, just as it had done to Harry, but afterwards it settled down into the invisible curve of the shield charm.  Malfoy cast a few spells at the pile of pink, then funnelled the powder back into the bottle with his wand.  Dispelling the shields with another wave of his wand, Malfoy took the bottle and began to run what Harry now recognized as diagnostics.
It was all sharp angles and harsh lines, with a moustache and a beard and hair past his ears, pulled up in back with long bits falling down by his ears.  On someone else, it might have looked cool.  Come to think of it, the whole body might have been cool on anybody else; only, Harry had hoped that he would look friendly and kind.  And handsome.  And elegant.  And posh.  Like Draco.
Draco rolled his eyes.  “I’m destitute, Potter, not craven.  The point is, I would.  Her safety and her comfort are more important than that she be proud of me.  Once I’ve got that sorted, though, she’ll want to think I’ve got a proper life—as much as I can as a shop-keep—so I’ll keep my hair cut and not fuck boys, and that will be that.”
“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to interrupt.” Malfoy’s eyes swept over Rune in a way that Harry recognized, because in his first year of Level One, Malfoy had looked that way at him all the time. Harry felt embarrassed that he hadn’t recognized it and embarrassed for Malfoy now that he did. “Please. Continue.”
“Right,” Harry said.  Then there was Savage, who was teaching Ron all the short-cuts, how to break all the rules—just like she’d taught Harry.  Over the years, however, Harry had become less and less sure of Savage’s methods.  She got things done, but sometimes Harry wondered at what cost.  And yet, when he tried to look into her sources, he felt bad for questioning her—when she’d been in the department for so long and done so much good.  Checking up on her seemed such a waste of time, when far more important cases were piling up, and when Savage for the most part was taking dangerous criminals off the streets.
Now was usually the time when Kavika returned the favour of small talk, asking Harry about his life—simple questions: how are you, how are things going, tell me about Academy. Harry used to let this go on for a while, giving minimal answers, waiting to see where she would press, but she hadn’t, not really. Instead, she had waited for him to open, allowing him to get used to her, and then when he was ready, allowing him to talk about what he had wanted to talk about. Sometimes Harry still didn’t know what he wanted to talk about, really; he just knew he always felt better once he left.
“Perfect,” Draco whispered. “Perfect. Now, Harry. Where else would you like this prick of mine to service you?”
“I didn’t mean . . .”  Releasing a breath, Harry gave it up.  Malfoy had always been impossible.  “You know what?  Never mind.”
No one had ever said anything like that to Harry before, perhaps because it was a nonsensical thing to say. Harry had been made for a goddamn prophecy, or because his parents loved each other, or some kind of accident; Harry didn’t know, maybe all three. He certainly hadn’t been made for this breathless, excitable person above him, most of whose life had been one huge fucking mistake after another, this goddamn mess of a man who never seemed able to express himself in a semi-normal way.
Instead of answering, Ron reached into his pocket, taking out a small rectangle about the size of his thumbnail. “It’s this week’s
Knowing that didn’t change the fact that if Draco was just trying to do the right thing, that meant Harry at this age was the wrong thing.  Meanwhile Harry had never been so happy or felt so good, which made being the wrong thing that much more depressing.  And then he’d gone and yelled at Draco for it and ruined everything.
“Of course,” Harry said. “I just meant . . . er. It’s mostly in the political stage. We don’t even know if it’s going to happen. They’ve been going back and forth on it forever, haven’t they? The vote was last year.”
,” he said, pointing his wand at the fire, and the flames went red.  “Dad said I should get used to short hair.”
“What?” Startled, Harry turned from the bottle back to Malfoy, who was closer than Harry had expected.
Harry could feel himself drooling, and quickly tried to lick it up. Closing his mouth and swallowing, he nodded his head. Hard.
Harry thought of Malfoy, bent over a table at Rombe Pickle, where they had all pored over maps of the wards around wizarding Britain, comparing them to non-magical road maps and urban areas, determining where first contacts might occur, how they would be handled. The magic light had made his hair almost gold, his sunken eyes and too-sharp nose softened by the glow.
Draco still looked pleased, but his gaze had dropped.  He was looking at Harry sideways, once again pretending he wasn’t looking at all.  “Would you be very sad?”
“I don’t know if it’s a Black gene,” Teddy said. “My grandfather was a non-mag, but that doesn’t mean he couldn’t also have had a Metamorphmagus gene.”
“I think I wasn’t . . . exciting enough for him. I was—you know; I was ‘Harry Potter’; he thought it was going to be action and adventure. Instead . . . I like to sit in the mornings and drink coffee. I like to be quiet.”
“Little lord Malfoy stocks the shelves!” said Alby, apparently too thrilled with this fact to force it out of Malfoy.  “He sweeps the floor!  This is how we treat former Death Eaters, isn’t it, Auror Potter?”
“Fifty?” Harry guessed, because all grownups were old to him.  At the man’s incredulous look, Harry said, “Forty-nine?”  Then he started thinking.  The year was 2012.  His parents had been dead nearly thirty years by now.  “You’re thirty-one as well, aren’t you,” Harry asked.
More correctly, his head was shaven, just a light fuzz on top where all that hair had been.  Given Draco’s light colouring, the fuzz was darker in colour than Harry would have expected, had he expected this at all.  “But,” Harry said.  “Why?”
Three hours later, Harry had cleaned up the glass and transfigured clothes for Draco to wear when he woke up.  Draco’s instructions had said to stay within a radius of ten meters, which had Harry too worried to leave long enough to have a shower, but he’d Scourgified himself, then transfigured his clothes back into his Auror robes.  The robes had been under enough spells by this point that he was going to need to get new ones, but Harry wasn’t worried about that.  He was worried about Draco, who hadn’t moved.
“That’s not all.  This powder was crushed in the same Pensieve the first potion you brought me was brewed in—the one that influenced people’s dreams.”
“Yeah.  Okay.”  Mister Malfoy was talking down to him.  Harry felt stupid, but it didn’t change the fact that Mister Malfoy was really cool, and could do magic, and hadn’t even punished him yet for the books.
“Finders keepers. I take your point, Nyala,” Malfoy said, turning back to her, “but what do you recommend we do if Proudfoot doesn’t pull through?”
“I draw my wand on the Hero of the Wizarding World?  That’s what they’re calling you, isn’t it?  Right.  I become daft, is what you’re saying.”
“What can I do?” Malfoy said, letting go Harry’s wrist. His voice was still low, urgent. “Do you need them? Should I bring them in?”
“Yeah.” Harry rubbed the back of his hand. “What I meant was—can I add you to the list? Of friends, I mean.”
“Wasn’t it?” Malfoy uncorked the vial and poured in the memory, which slid liquid and silver from the glass into the stone bowl. “You think I’m depraved.”
Harry stared at the ugly expression on Draco’s face.  “Let’s go to the Leaky Cauldron,” Harry said suddenly.  “It still might be dangerous to go out, but we’ll wear disguises.”
Teddy was calmly walking along, mostly looking at the ground, hands in his pockets. “And what do you think?” Harry asked.
Leaning down, Draco put his lips on it, mouth tracing the edges of the scar. Then his tongue was there, tracing the same path his lips had taken, and his hands were pushing Harry’s shirt up into his armpits. When his tongue was done with the scar, Draco picked up his wand again, Banishing Harry’s shirt. He leaned down to kiss Harry again. “What do you like?”
Harry had slept so little that he found he needed the coffee, so he walked back out to go to one of the nearby cafés. He always went to La Reve these days, since he was pretty sure that was where Malfoy went, and Harry had since got used to it. The walk was nice, invigorating. When he came back, he passed through the green, by the Timothy Tree, where Malfoy always used to sit.
“Everything all right?”  Harry realized he hadn’t wiped his hands when he’d run out of the kitchen.  “
“It would be my pleasure to show you, Harry.”  Draco’s voice was deep and warm, which made it sound as though he really meant it.
,” Draco added, pointing at a napkin.  That was the water spell, and a little bit of water shot out of his wand to make the napkin wet.
Parkinson exited the corridor, and Malfoy closed the compartment door. Then he pretended to fetch something from his trunk, and Harry could see his younger self peeking out from the Invisibility Cloak. “
An emptiness opened up inside of Harry, yawning and vast, and he knew this feeling. He recognized this feeling. He should have prepared for this feeling. It was the feeling that came after finishing something and having nothing left, that came from expecting something and not having it come true. He’d felt it every day, coming home from the Auror Department, that feeling that his life was not what it should be, that he was not helping the people he should be, that nothing was as it should be.
Draco smiled, his silver eyes kind.  “You’ll need to put your thumb into each of these,” he said, indicating the bowls.  “We’ll dry it off between each one.  If your thumb changes colour, we’ll need to wait a bit before the next one.”
Not sure what Draco was really feeling versus what his parents might have encouraged him to feel, Harry tried to speak carefully.  “A bit of one.”
“Oh. That’s not the problem. It’s . . .” Harry looked at the leaves gently dancing in the breeze, the way Kavika had taught him to look—observing details, things he thought he knew already. The thick trunk of the tree outside the window looked still at a glance, but with concentration, Harry could see that it was moved too, by the wind. Branches connected to it moved with the trunk’s movement; twigs connected to the branches moved both with branches and with their own reaction to the wind. The slender stalk of a leaf moved with the combination of all these forces, actions upon it, helpless in connection to something much larger, and yet autumn proved that despite these connections tracing back to the trunk, each leaf was a life, able to die alone.
February rolled into March, and they were experiencing a week that nearly felt like spring when Teddy stayed behind after Sorcery (Ritual, Soul, and Spiritual Magic) to ask about dark sigils. Harry didn’t have to think long to figure it out. “Malfoy didn’t tell you?” Harry asked. “I already told him I’d help him.”
Malfoy was doing it now, hands moving rapidly as he discussed the opening days of the courses non-magical education centres would present. The Order had agreed that these initial courses would be offered continuously in the beginning, since many non-magical people were bound to have thousands of questions the day of Reveal. “Maybe we could have something like Orientation at Academy,” Malfoy was saying, “where instead of going from instructor to instructor, perhaps the non-magicals could visit different important magical sites: the Ministry, Hogwarts, the Academy—”
Harry turned around the room, looking at four fires full of powerful pure-blood men. “The bias against pure-bloods,” he said slowly. “In the Ministry. I’m just checking to make sure I understand, because you do know the Minister of Magic is a pure-blood. Right?”
“Let’s just do this. Here’s the Portkey.” Harry was holding the Auror badge in its cloth so he wouldn’t travel yet.
“By you?” Spragg sneered. “Lucky you were with MACUSA during the last war, wasn’t it? Now you can be here to start a whole new war again!”
Draco didn’t say anything.  When Harry glanced up at him, Draco was staring into the fire, and Harry couldn’t help the impression he’d made Draco sad.  “Draco?” Harry asked.
“What?” Harry asked, but then he heard it. It must have been the snake-shape the magic had taken, and he had been concentrating so closely he hadn’t realized. He’d thought the language would leave with Voldemort, but it hadn’t. “Sorry.”
he was flirting with him, but maybe it wasn’t fair to Malfoy, who had loved him once. But then Malfoy was guiding Harry’s hand to his waist, and Malfoy’s shirt was silk. Harry could feel Malfoy’s skin through the thin pink material, and it didn’t feel confusing. It felt hot, searing hot, and only then did Harry realize his mistake.
“It means irrational.  Harry.”  Draco hesitated.  “When you first de-aged, and you thought I had kidnapped you—were you scared?”
Draco yawned.  “At least I don’t have to go to school.  Again, I mean.  I mean, I can get first year all over with in—how long?  A few hours?”
For the first time in a long time, Harry thought about Dudley.  Harry had heard Dudley had got married.  Good on him.  Harry should have sent a card.
“I know,” Kavika said now, her rough voice its own version of gentle. “I’m sorry I couldn’t be there for you.”
Harry had been sitting on one of the stools in Tailored Tinctures’ lab.  Now he stood, moving over to Draco.  “Come here,” he said, but when he tried to pull Draco into his arms, Draco pulled away.
When Harry came out of the bathroom into the kitchen, Draco wasn’t there, but the silver fox was sat just outside the door.  “Uh, hello,” Harry said, feeling a little foolish talking to it when it was
But Ron would never, ever be careless enough to see money simply appear in his account and think nothing of it.  Anyone who thought so didn’t know Ron, didn’t know what he had had to do to save enough for uni and for Auror Academy, to save enough for his kids and Hermione and the lovely home they had.  That they thought Ron would take that money and go buy diamond earrings with it was just goddamn stupid.
It was probably sexist, or something.  Hermione or something would say it was sexist, maybe.  Ginny would shrug and say it was because Harry was bi, but Harry knew bi people who weren’t into boys who looked like girls.  Apparently, Harry was into it.  Apparently, he was very, very into
“So, you’re an Auror,” Malfoy drawled.  Putting a hand in a pocket, Malfoy began strolling around the lab.  “What is this place?  I’m not Minister for Magic, yet, I reckon.”  Picking up a beaker on one of the lab benches, Malfoy pretended to look at it, while his gaze slid to Harry as if to judge his reaction.  Malfoy looked as though he thought he was being subtle.  “You didn’t know I was going to be Minister for Magic?  Well, I am.  I expect it’ll take another decade or two.”
“I thought you’d never ask,” Malfoy said, his voice silky. “You know, 'this would go a lot faster' if I had help.”
The driver had been right; the ride was long.  It was summer, though, so it would not be getting dark for a long time.  Still, by the time they arrived at Colville Road, Harry was getting rather hungry for supper.  “Here?” the driver asked, sounding sceptical.  They’d arrived at an intersection with a bunch of boring-looking buildings.  None of them had names or numbers on the front, and Harry wasn’t even sure which one was the right address.
“You don’t have to forgive her,” Harry said.  “For whatever she—you don’t.  And you don’t ever have to see her again or talk to her.  I just think—she loves you.  She still loves you, and I thought you should know.  In case you didn't.”
; Draco had a boyfriend, and Harry wanted that boyfriend to be him, for Christ’s sake.  And yet Harry felt happy anyway, and he knew that it was pride.  He also knew that pride, if he expressed it, would be humiliating for Draco just now, so Harry held it in, but he still felt it.  He felt it all through him, as though he was a pitcher filled with something soft and silver and perfect, all the way down to his toes.
“I—as long as—as you were touching me.” Harry took a breath. “As long as you didn’t leave me there.”
is Reveal, and the world’s gone to shite, and what if Granger doesn’t win the election; this whole thing is bollocksed—”
This quickly devolved into a discussion of which pure-blood children were rebelling against their more conservative roots, and why these figures still managed to wield more influence politically than non-mag-borns who had never been raised in a pure-blood culture to begin with. Not all of the influential “rebellious” pure-bloods were in Nyala’s or Harry’s generation, however; Arthur Weasley was one of the most popular advocates for Reveal, and he was seventy-three. Still, a few non-mag-borns had definitely made their place in politics, Hermione being the primary example. The coming year was a general election year, and Hermione planned to stand again against Fudge for Minister of Magic.
Obviously, that wasn’t true, as Harry knew Hermione and Hermione had always worked harder than him at everything, but Hermione was split between work and family and her political obligations, whereas Harry really only had his job.  Meanwhile, Malfoy only seemed to have potions.  His sitting room was filled with tables stacked with glassware and potions ingredients.  Whenever Harry went over there, Malfoy always seemed to be working on something new—boiling things on his cooker, measuring powders in the sitting room.  Once, Harry even found him mixing tinctures in the toilet.
“Draco.”  Harry came out from around the lab bench, noticing that Draco was very pale.  “I’m all right.”
When Harry looked up again, Goldstein and Pomfrey had also stopped, moving to watch the holds Malfoy was demonstrating for Liang with Abbott. Harry let it happen. Malfoy was good at this, and always so gentle with the younger trainees. At last, McDevitt wanted to try it himself, and Harry left him to it.
About a year after Narcissa’s death, Harry was fiddling with a potion bottle in the Auror Office, trying to get the tiny stopper out.  Having taken the bottle from the potions dealer he had just arrested, Harry was fairly certain the powder was illegal, but he hadn’t yet figured out whether the brew was one the department was already tracking or whether it was completely new.  Mainly he was avoiding taking the powder to Malfoy, as the cool way Malfoy treated him annoyed Harry without Harry being able to explain why.  It’d been a year since Malfoy’s mum, and yet it felt somehow like Malfoy was still angry with him.
“Muggles aren’t our population,” Savage said, turning on Spragg and still managing to snort while doing so.
“Right,” the man said again, but didn’t move.  His shoulders sagged, and the furrow in his brow made him seem very unhappy, but he did not look at all as though he would let Harry go.
“I’m okay,” Harry told Molly, because he had tried being honest and telling her he was not okay before, and she had not had the capacity to leave him alone until he had finally lied and told her he would be all right.
“Well, anyway,” Ron said, walking on. “I’m glad he wasn’t there. That would’ve been bloody awkward, wouldn’t it?”
“Forgive me,” he said, sounding blank.  “I was functioning under the assumption that I was a normal person.  How silly of me.”
“You’re not ‘meant’ to feel anything. You feel what you feel.” Hermione turned to Ron. “And if you do feel something for someone, Harry, it doesn’t have to be for a witch or wizard; it can be a non-magical person. There are more than twelve of them, last time I checked.”
“Really?” Harry asked, annoyance having mostly worn off into amusement.  Draco was always saying he knew everything.
There was a time when Harry wouldn’t have asked, when he didn’t want to interfere in his godson’s life, didn’t want Teddy to feel dictated to, about who his friends could be. Teddy’s closest friend at Hogwarts had been Icarus Zabini, a member of Slytherin and niece to Blaise Zabini, and Harry had been glad. Now, however, he knew that asking would not hurt, as long as he was careful and aware of the possibility. “Are you and Malfoy friends?” he’d asked finally, doing his very best to make it sound as though he had no judgment about the answer either way.
“Gordon and I have a close personal relationship.” Greengrass’s voice was smug. “I’m sure he told me Draco Malfoy was failing. I’m sorry you hadn’t heard. I knew you were so invested in the little former Death Eater’s success.”
The dittany came shooting in from the lab, but by the time it got there, the bleeding had stopped.  Scabs had formed almost instantly on Draco’s arm, and Draco had fallen back on the bed, unmoving.  “
“In here,” Doctor Yin said, showing him into an office. Almost as stuffed with paraphernalia as the hall, the room looked like a non-mag painter’s impression of a fantastical magic study. A crystal ball sat wedged next to an old-fashioned genie lamp, which was stuffed under something that possibly was a magic loom. In the corner, what appeared to be a taxidermy leopard poked its head out from under a tapestry woven with silver astronomical symbols. Across from this stood a terrarium with many tiny exotic plants, spelled to contain a sky, complete with clouds and its own sun.
“What other matters?” Harry asked, before he could think.  When Draco just looked at him, Harry realized that whatever a proprietor was, it was Draco, and Draco hadn’t opened his shop because he’d been trying to fix Harry.  Maybe ‘tailored tinctures’ had been the name of it.  “But it doesn’t look like a shop,” Harry said.
“Don’t tell Draco I told you.”  Andromeda smirked.  “Anyway, it had to come out somewhere, all of that emotion.  Where do you think she put it?  Certainly not her husband; she had to be perfect for him as well.  Twenty-three years of love, passion, affection, loneliness and heartache.  She put it all in him.”
Hermione laughed, looking at the arching cerulean lines of her daughter’s painting.  “Oh, Harry, how unlike you to notice.”
At last, the sacrifices were laid to rest. Only then did Malfoy shift his weight, a soft sound at last relieved from his lips, like a whine. “Just a little more,” Harry said, his hand moving down to Malfoy’s neck, so he could hold him steady and concentrate on his work.
.  She’d think I must be, to go and do something like that; she’d think she’d done something wrong to make me this way.  She loves me so much that she can’t even blame me.  She’d blame herself.”
insecurity, and feeling bad about not being recognized for something you hadn’t earned in the first place had never resonated with Harry to begin with.
Susan and a few of the others were Apparating their arrests back to the Ministry for holding, and Ron had stayed behind to talk to Teddy. Harry had only just arrived on the scene, sending his Patronus to fetch Malfoy, who arrived a few moments later. “What were you thinking?” Malfoy asked, striding past Ron toward Teddy.
Harry covered Draco’s right hand with his own, covering the Dark Mark that had newly appeared on Draco’s skin.
“Has anyone ever done that for you, Harry?” Draco’s voice was so low and soft, words whispered like a secret in Harry’s ear. “Studied you? Made a project of you? Taken you apart piece by piece so they know how your body works, every detail of you, every little breath you take?” Draco bit him again, almost too sharply.
“Yes.” She turned to him as well. “You helped me find the Snuffleupagus. You came to my father’s funeral. You helped my wife learn Occlumency. Would you like me to go on listing things?”
People passed by on the street, a wizard with an owl on her shoulder.  Two teenaged witches ate Fortesque’s ice cream cones.  An older witch held a young boy by the hand, the boy tripping along behind her and staring in wonder at everything they passed.  The first time Harry had come to Diagon Alley Harry had found it so strange, so fantastic.  It had hardly seemed real.
Pointing his wand at the table, Draco cleared the jam and butter as well, turning to put them away.  Coming back to the table, he fussed with the placemat, cleaning it with his wand even though it didn’t look dirty to Harry.  Then he put his wand away, then took it out again.
Draco angled his face away.  When he spoke, his voice was very quiet.  “His name is Rohit.  He’s a Muggle.”
“Zero for today.” Malfoy pushed himself off the wall to shrug. “Too bad, so sad. I’ll make up for it when we do Occlumency. When are we doing Occlumency?” he asked, turning to Adebayo.
There was something so gentle and almost sad in Draco’s tone that Harry looked up from his last strawberry, but Draco had already turned away.
Before him stood a child with blond hair, grey eyes, and a fierce scowl.  Realization sank in Harry like a stone.
He'd missed Malfoy, Harry realized with a start.  He’d missed him since his mum died, when Malfoy had stopped teasing Harry like a pet he sometimes tolerated having around.
“It’s an election year,” Hermione said. “A new Minister for Magic would appoint a different Head Auror.”
“Safe space.” Malfoy spoke choppily, not at all that breezy tone he usually used. “We needed it once the crowd began to get rowdy.”
with an ache that was not rational; he was so worried whether Draco was okay, whether anything had happened during eighth year that would hurt him.
“Very good, Harry,” Draco said, smiling again.  “What else did you learn?  How about the dust-banishing one?”
A week before the vote of no confidence, Harry came into his office in the morning to find Draco Malfoy leaning against the desk, holding a coffee. “Here,” Malfoy said, picking up another coffee from Harry’s desk. He held it out to Harry. “You’ll need it.”
,” he said, already turning away, not even watching as the glowing silver stag expanded into a big balloon, attached to a string, held by the hand of a child that looked exactly like a young Malfoy, except for how absurdly cute the child was. Springing a leak, the bloated stag-balloon popped off the string and went whizzing about the room, just like Lupin’s moon had third year. The Riddikulused boggart-child began to cry inconsolably.
Draco shut his mouth.  “Yes.  I—you needn’t worry about my in-between birthday, Harry.  I’m thirty-two.  That’s too old for in-between birthdays.”
Draco glanced up hastily, momentary guilt painting his features. “Harry,” he said, kissing Harry in a rush, as if he knew he was meant to be kissing him and had forgot for a moment.
“Proudfoot needs a revolution too!” the bald girl told Harry, when Malfoy was quite finished. Her voice was raised to be heard over the crowd, but when she went on, Harry still couldn’t hear her.
“Do you need anything to eat?  Your stores have got low.  I’ll go shopping for you.  I can pick up fish and chips.”
be Minister for Magic, though?  I’m not asking because I—never bother.  Forget about it.”  The tapping went on.  “Do you think . . . ?”  The tapping stopped.  “Never mind.  I know how to do Lumos.
“No,” Harry said.  “That got him out.  You got to have Lucius seventh year and a bit after.  But there were trails eventually, and he got sentenced.”
“Harry, I don’t care about the jar.”  Draco-in-Harry’s-body came a little closer, and now that he sounded less distressed and more concerned, he looked nicer too.  The lines in his harsh face softened, though Harry still thought he looked a bit wild.
Another chill wracked through Harry.  His head hurt; his nose felt stuffy, his muscles weak.  “I don’t need a cure,” he said.  “I need to know what poison it is.  I thought you could . . .”  Harry trailed off miserably, because Malfoy was right.  Harry had no idea what Malfoy could do without a sample.  “This was stupid,” he muttered, getting his wand back out so he could Apparate.
Harry wasn’t there. He was there, but he wasn’t really there. He was dazed. Malfoy was still there. Harry should be handling this better.
“I’ve been good.” Malfoy licked his lips. “I’ve tried to be good. I’ve done everything I possibly . . .”
, and there are people out there still like that. Do you think I don’t know? Blood supremacists, purists, twisted psychopaths who think our world would be better if non-magical people were all killed off—or enslaved, as Grindelwald would have it. I know. I know they’re out there. I
Harry remembered looking into ingredients from that region before.  The Slumber Slam had had scopolamine, a chemical extracted from a Central American tree, but Harry had investigated Slumber Slam long before Malfoy had developed that indicator solution.  Harry had to go farther back in time, getting more old cases from Records and Filing.  Slowly, the office at Grimmauld Place became full of boxes as Harry found other connections: the petrification poison made from elkhorn coral, found in the Caribbean Sea, the tortoise scales in the Forgetfulness Potion, the coca in Dream Dram.  Even the swamp-things whose bogies had been in the Ragerade were swamp-things from Florida.
Dudley stood there in the doorway, hand still on the doorknob.  “Look here.  A fellow came by, a few weeks ago, one of your sort—that’s not to say—I only mean—he was—” Harry didn’t help him, and Dudley gulped—“magical, and there was an owl, only he said it hadn’t anything to do with you, only—are you okay?”
,” Draco said, tossing the resulting light up toward the ceiling.  The room was nice, though not terribly large.  It had a sofa and two chairs, with a low table and some bookcases.  A kitchen opened up behind them and to the left was a hallway.  To the right was a hearth and a large window.  It was still dark out, and the blinds were drawn.
Harry went outside to help him. As the fire exploded against the sky in colourful showers of sparks, Ron put his strong arm around Harry’s shoulders, the other arm around Hermione’s waist. Sometimes Harry thought that Ron might be the only thing holding him up. The rest of the time, he was sure it was Hermione, and his world was a series of firecrackers, burning bright and then fading into nothing.
“Yes,” Harry cried out. “Uhghn.” He still struggled to swallow the drool. “Yes, yes—do me, like that, yes—”
“The kindergarten wouldn’t be going away,” Mark added hastily. “See, there are some similarities between Squibs and non-magicals—”
“Father did all the voices,” Draco said.  “I was wondering if you—would you want to listen to one of the stories?”
Uncorking it, Harry held out the phial, but Draco winced as he reached toward it.  “Let me,” Harry said, standing up.
“Draco.”  Harry didn’t know what else to say, and Draco was standing there, looking as though he was going to cry all over again.  “Can I,” Harry began, reaching out.  “Let me.”  Then Harry’s hand was on Draco’s shoulder, and Draco was letting him come closer, and Harry was hugging him.
Draco’s breath caught again, and Harry didn’t know what to say. He’d never really done this before, but he thought that he could manage.
Malfoy looked as though he wanted to pretend he hadn’t heard him again, but instead he grudgingly turned his face to Harry’s, not quite meeting Harry’s eyes.
Harry didn’t particularly fancy getting hugged again, but Draco was really messed up or sad or whatever, and anyway Harry had meant what he had said.  He didn’t want Draco thinking he didn’t care, just because Draco had done something bad, or lots of bad things.  Whatever, it didn’t matter, because Draco was a good person.  The best person, really, and even though Harry was pretty certain Draco was crying on him, being hugged wasn’t the worst thing ever.
.  Then Harry thought about what child-Draco had said, about being a scholar, and wondered how many things Draco didn’t do because other people had stopped him.
Taking out his wand, Harry and pointed at the shelves.  “There,” Harry said, putting his wand away as the phials on the racks all flew out and danced around each other.  “Will you do it now?”
“Wood weakens if you stretch it,” Andromeda said, “but Teddy’s bed is sturdy.  It should work all right for a few nights.”
Reaching into his pocket, Harry pulled out a bottle.  “I brought a potion,” he said, holding it out.
Dazedly, Draco blinked his eyes.  His lips were wet and red from kissing, just like a movie as well.  Even with his sallow skin, pulled tight over his sharp features, even with the hollows under his eyes and that dull hair, he was beautiful.  “Have you reconsidered the dry humping?” Draco said, sounding dazed as well.
Malfoy’s worst fear was the fact that his Patronus would reveal his feelings for Harry; of course, he had shame. “What do you want?”
“I’m not—”  Draco cut himself off with a huff.  “Who wants to dry hump you anyway,” he said, turning away.  “I don’t even care.”
“I don’t know,” Mister Malfoy said, heading toward the door that went downstairs.  “What are labs like on television?”
“I’m saying ‘should’ is a word I don’t think applies when it comes to us and Draco Malfoy.” Ron gave him a melancholy smile. “We don’t owe him anything.”
“But I hate salad.”  Draco’s voice was sour, but his eyes were cast down.  “I heard about Professor Lupin.  I—I really liked him.  As a professor.”
Abel Alby, however, was the opposite of helpful.  Though he still fawned all over Harry, he actively tried to prevent Harry from dealing with Malfoy, obviously missing the pay-offs Savage used to give him in exchange for help with potions ID.  Furthermore, he was always saying awful things to Malfoy, things Harry tried not to listen to but couldn’t help but hear: Alby telling Malfoy what a waste of space he was, how no one wanted him.  Meanwhile Malfoy was constantly working in clothes that didn’t fit him, still too thin and not allowed use magic.
If Malfoy knew he were bent he’d be relieved, as Harry had been.  Instead he sounded worried.  “Not that I know of.”  Harry remembered what Malfoy had told him.  “You’re a confirmed bachelor.”
The man was still looking at Heloise with that strangely rueful expression.  “She probably misses being petted.”
When Draco spoke again, his voice was soft.  “When you spend fifteen years of your life pretending you don’t want something—never even talking about it, never even allowing yourself to look . . . and suddenly everyone telling you that you couldn’t have it is gone, and you can not only look; you can touch—Potter.  Why
As the other side of Harry’s mouth curved up, he noticed the shape of Yin’s face once more—a perfect oval, which made the features of their face appear placed just so. They were less plain that he had initially supposed, their eyes bright like a night in a faerie parade, their mouth lush and expressive.
Harry’s arse opened up again, just as it had the first time Draco loosened it. With this spell the muscles of his rim felt slack, loose, and this time there was come inside, dribbling out of Harry’s arse down his thighs. Beneath him, his cock—already hard—began to get harder, muscles inside tightening.
,” Draco said again, and the fire turned blue.  This time it stayed that way, and Draco turned to him excitedly.  “I did it!”
Harry couldn’t figure out why Mister Malfoy was talking to him like that—like he was talking to a baby or one of Mrs. Figg’s scared cats.
“Oh, well.”  Draco drew himself up.  “Let me tell you—fathers don’t insult you.  They teach you how to be smart, and do magic, and get ahead in life.  They know everything—well, mine does, anyway.
“Right.”  Pointing his stick at the books, Mister Malfoy began restoring them to the shelves by floating them over.  “It’s meant to cancel the effects of minor potions or charms.  It didn’t cancel the de-ageing potion, which means the potion is powerful.  But it has to have been, to have lasted this long.  The Cure-All doesn’t do anything for panic, so it must have just given you something else to focus on.”  He wasn’t even saying anything to the books, just pointing at them.
Malfoy looked away.  “The powder’s got siren tongue,” he said.  “Sirens don’t live in Europe anymore, so it should be easy to . . .”  Trailing off, Malfoy licked his lips again.  “It’s got some of the same ingredients of Amortentia as well, and chili peppers, which as you know are . . .”  Malfoy turned to Harry again, as though he was forcing himself to look at him.  “You know I didn’t mean—to do what I did.”
“Let me finish. I’m giving a heroic speech. I thought I would prove myself. I thought I would graduate. I would become and Auror. I would put the past behind me. I would be someone new. But you know what? That’s not what it is to be good. Good is doing what you can, when you can. It’s doing your part, even when it’s not what you wanted. Do you know who taught me that?”
“Just sit down, Potter,” Malfoy said, sounding as annoyed as Harry felt.  “I’ll try to find out what’s wrong.”
“He’s not stupid,” Draco said, his voice almost sharp.  “I—I haven’t been clear at all about liking him.  In fact, I lied to him, the one time we—well, it didn’t count, and I wasn’t honest.  I haven’t been honest; I’ve hid myself; I’ve been disagreeable, discourteous; I’ve been—I’ve been ungracious.  I’ve been ungracious, but I only did it because—because I was afraid.”
“You’re right, Harry,” Draco said.  “Like I said, I was frustrated.  I got irritable, and I’m sorry.”
For some reason, Harry actually found this funny. Malfoy didn’t sound like he was making fun of Ron, or any of the Weasleys. He sounded like he was flipping words around for the fun of it.
he wanted to say, but it wasn’t true. There was too much to tell. “Doctor Yin is great,” he said finally.
Malfoy had been so bland, in fact, that Harry hadn’t really thought to dread him tonight, but now that Harry was here and turning back to watch Malfoy with the Greengrass girl, Harry realized that if Malfoy
“Mm.” Licking his lips, Harry swallowed again, because for some reason the thought of cock on his tongue sounded like the perfect solution for all of this saliva. He’d always liked cock-sucking, but nothing had ever made him this desperate for it.
“I wasn’t trying to . . .” Harry trailed off, because he still didn’t know what he’d been trying to do. Sighing, he took out his wand, pointing it at the wall. “
Her little joke deserved a smile, and Harry wearily gave her one. “No. I guess . . . he was loud. And bossy. Malfoy . . . he called attention to himself. He doesn’t now. He’s almost . . .” Harry waved a hand. “His marks are terrible. But other than that, he’s almost . . . forgettable.”
Using the stick—his wand, Harry guessed—Mister Malfoy opened cabinets, pointed at things in them, and made them float around the kitchen.  He got sugar, cocoa, and water into a pot and then the pot on the cooker, then started the cooker, only murmuring words now and then to make things go where he wanted.  Then he got milk out of a cabinet and a little bottle of something that looked like vanilla.
Harry recognized the incantation, but the spell was nothing like before.  The whole room seemed to fill with the shimmering cloud this time, and from the tip of Draco’s wand the unspooling silver spun and spun until forming the shape of a glowing fox.  “Say hello to Harry,” Draco told the fox, tapping on the butterfly to make it disappear.  All of Draco’s nose hairs were back in his nose as well.
In the dim light from the windows Harry could see the posters on Teddy’s walls, all the people screaming at drum-sets and guitars.  Harry had got to have the coverlet that changed colour, but in the dim light, it just looked grey.  “I don’t want to be thirty-one,” he said finally.
After twenty minutes, Malfoy finally said, “I’ve produced a cream.”  Holding it up, he set it on the lab bench beside him.  “You’ll need to put it everywhere the powder touched you.”
“Oh.” Harry pointed his wand, directing the coffee pot over to the table, directing it to pour more coffee, then turning it toward Teddy.
Malfoy took his arm away. “Astoria did it for me,” he said, snapping the sleeve down with a spell. This time, he buttoned the cuff.
“Yes,” Harry said, jerking his eyes back to Malfoy’s arm. The drawing of the flower was delicate, thin red lines depicting a long stem, the unfurled petals around the centre flute. Then Harry saw it—the tell-tale ridge of skin. “Malfoy,” he breathed, then touched the shape of the flower. The drawing had not been done with ink. It was a scar.
“He left.”  Andromeda lowered the newspaper to turn the page.  She had on a small pair of spectacles, looking at him over the tops of the rims.  “There’s cereal if you want it.  And I can make more tea, if you like.”  She put the newspaper back up again.  Someone on a broom moved across the page.
“Do you think this is being done by someone within the Academy?” asked Greta Stone, a writer for the
“I know the words.  It’s just the—never mind,” Harry said, because he didn’t want to bother explaining.  He’d never been able to explain it well anyway; only Hermione had seemed to get what he was talking about, and that was fifth year.  She’d taught him the reading spell then, which had helped a lot.
can’t be bought,” Malfoy said, counting off on his finger. “That’s a point in it’s bloody favour. Second of all, who? Third of all, why? All they want is for me not to be an embarrassment to the whole . . .” He made a frittering gesture with his hand—“pure-blood establishment. No one’s dowager aunt wants a scion of the Malfoy line to be in law enforcement.”
Removing three shot glasses, Harry got the Firewhiskey and poured them each a shot, then took the phial of indicator solution and poured it into the third glass.  “Do you want to be the variable or the control?” Harry asked, after he’d had a shot.
“As an Auror, I sometimes have to make sure people can’t recognize me,” Harry said.  “So, I know a bunch of glamours—just things to make you shorter or taller, change the colour of your hair, the length of your nose, that sort of thing.”
Harry looked at the moon. It occurred to him that the protective wards must be what made it appear unnaturally large. “He’s being asked to do something. Something dangerous.”
After Narcissa’s death, Malfoy was no less helpful with potions ID, but they conducted almost all business by owl.  Harry understood why Malfoy had sent that note.  Harry might not be a real person with real human feelings, but he knew what it was like to lose someone.  Your whole world rearranged itself, taking on entirely new priorities.  Apparently, Malfoy’s priority was to open a shop.
Bickford, Pillwickle, and Greengrass all slowly turned their green faces toward him. “This is a private meeting of the board,” said Greengrass, his voice as cool and disinterested as always.
“Our Chosen One.” Malfoy still had on his smirk. “Why don’t you get your Mudblood friends to help you?”
“And this is my job,” Harry said.  This was his life, and fuck Robards if he was going to stand in Harry’s way.
“How are you floating?” asked a girl, looking around Mark and Fairchild as though she might find some wires attached to their bodies.
Malfoy tilted his head at Harry. “You can kill him as well,” he said, but Teddy was shaking his head again.
In the end, Harry spent the evening with the most logical choice, someone he should have known to call all along, someone who always understood him and always cared.
“Draco,” Harry said, because at some point, Draco was going to remember about Narcissa—but Draco was tipping back the bottle again, drinking the rest.
Harry had said that—not about the restriction, since he hadn’t really thought about that, but he’d told Hermione about his first encounter with Malfoy at Slug and Jiggers and Malfoy’s subsequent assistance.  “He hasn’t done anything wrong,” Harry said reluctantly.  “Other than be Malfoy.  Robards is just obsessed with image.”
“I snuck a marshmallow once, while Dudley was having it.”  Harry followed along behind, keeping a larger distance this time, in case Mister Malfoy stopped again.
Harry gritted his teeth again. “What, you think that justifies it? You think that justifies someone who would do that to a witch—a nineteen-year-old witch, just because she’s dating a non-magical bloke?”
“Mum said . . . she said we should pity him—Severus.  Because he hadn’t any family.  She said he never got married because he was too much of a swot.  He couldn’t find anybody to love him.  It’s the worst thing in the world, to have no family, you know.  But—” Draco bit his lip, casting his eyes down.  “But then you
On the seventh day, Harry was alone once more in the evening, trying to decide whether he could go over there, after what he’d said, whether that would be allowed.  He was still dressed, mostly, but after he’d got home from work he’d taken off his boots and robe and belt and put on the dressing-gown Draco had given him.  It had grown with Harry’s body, just as Draco had said it would.  Then the doorbell rang.
“Vinicius,” said Sibanyoni. “Boyfriend. Auror. Boyfriend who is an Auror. Was a boyfriend, is an Auror. How did that make you feel, breaking up?”
“If I’d had my way, I’d be dead.” Harry sipped his coffee. “I guess it’s good we don’t always get what we want.”
Malfoy had said that to him once, and the truth was that many people had felt that, many people had gone through that. Many people had loved Harry Potter, but there was only one Draco Malfoy.
Harry was getting closer, but that meant Draco was that much more likely to pull back again, to tease him again. “Don’t tease me, please. Please.”
, but he couldn’t say it. To say it took too much energy, to reveal it took too much vulnerability, and Harry wanted to reveal that least of all to Malfoy, who might treasure such nakedness, or—worst of all—try to comfort him. Harry looked longingly at the bench, then away.
Ron opened his mouth to protest, but then thought better of it, perhaps recognizing the look on Harry’s face as well. “All right,” he said, “but call me if you need me.” Turning, he gave Malfoy an inscrutable look before going to join his fellow Aurors.
Harry reached out his hand, and Draco flinched away.  “I’m not going to hurt you,” Harry said, then put his hand on Draco’s shoulder.  “Eat your breakfast,” Harry said, squeezing, then letting his hand fall away.  He moved to push past, but Draco caught Harry’s hand.
In the memories, Vance had already gone in and out of the lab a few times.  Harry had told Draco to separate those memories, but Vance was not what Harry and Draco were looking for.  Neither Savage nor Ron were either, because Harry already knew Savage was involved, and Ron was being controlled.  What Harry needed was the supplier, because that had to be someone outside the department.  If Harry could find the supplier, he should be able to more easily trace everyone who was involved and where all the contraband ingredients were.  He should also be able to find whatever mechanism was controlling Ron, Hermione, and Shacklebolt, and get to the bottom of the whole thing.
“Immediately, Potter.”  Mister Malfoy grabbed his arm.  Before Harry could further protest, Mister Malfoy was swishing his stick and they were squeezing through blackness, the sensation almost familiar by now.
There were books. There were lots and lots of books about Harry Potter, and Draco Malfoy was barely a footnote in most of them. “Do you want to be in this class?” Harry asked, quite gently.
“Fuck!” said Ron, who was the one left without a Ward Bore, but it was too late. Aurors were popping into the room; the witches and wizards gathered there were turning to them, and then—the view on the IC:WUT/UC was back to the Dementors, then moving—moving—moving—Malfoy had to be leaping
“I quit because of all the bureaucracy.” Harry’s voice was calm, because he wasn’t really here. He wasn’t thinking. He was letting his body stand there, letting his mouth go off, but he wasn’t inside of it. He was somewhere else, watching it happen. It felt good. It felt fucking great. “All of the red tape. Inability to get things done. You catch a blood supremacist—what does it matter? One of their Old Blood relatives speaks on their behalf. The Wizengamot has always been more interested in protecting the Statute of Secrecy. The work is prioritized in such a way, the Force is built in such a way, you address one blood crime at a time, instead of the bigger strings that control the institution.”
Orientation was on a bright day in September, the reporters clustered around the Pallas Arch dressed almost as they might for summer. They were waiting to ask questions about Draco Malfoy and Teddy Lupin, but Harry had brought a broom in expectation of this, and Teddy was unrecognizable upon his arrival, which had always been his main advantage against reporters.
“No,” Hermione said. “I wish I’d thought of it, but honestly, Harry, I didn’t even notice you leaving. I think probably everyone was just too distracted.”
They pushed through the cold blackness onto a street with row houses.  The street was neat and quiet with a little park on the other side, so Harry thought it was probably posh, even though the houses looked sort of rundown.  The sign on the street read Grimmauld Place.  “Can you see number twelve, Harry?” Draco said, still holding his hand.
parchment’.”  Mister Malfoy flicked his finger as he said it, and the paper floated toward him.  “Now, you try.”  Setting the paper on the table, Mister Malfoy backed up.
, went Harry’s brain, and he breathed again. In through the nose; you should feel your belly expand; out through the mouth; it should deflate—two, three four. In through the nose, two three four, out through the mouth, two three four. In through the nose—out. Okay. “Why?” Harry asked, finally dull now, instead of shocked.
“My parents are wankers,” Nyala told Harry. “I’d rather spend the end of the world with the man I love.”
When they squeezed out again they were back in the room with the flower-print chair and the books everywhere, the fire still crackling merrily in the hearth.
“I know,” Harry said. “I didn’t want you then. I didn’t want someone who would do all that for me. It’s when you started doing it for yourself, I—I don’t know, Malfoy. Draco. You made me believe we can change. I can change. And I did. You gave me hope, Draco. Hope I didn’t even know I needed.”
“Harry, therapists are not your next-door-neighbour. You don’t have to suffer through anyone who doesn’t work for you; you can pick the one you like. Does it help to get to know someone and allow yourself to open up? Of course. But if someone instantly rubs you the wrong way, you have the privilege and the power to walk away.”
Draco must not have been as absorbed as Harry had supposed, because after a moment he closed his book and came over to the sofa.  “That book said it’d take a full twelve hours for that cure to mature,” Draco said, nodding at the ledger as he sat down on the sofa.  “I suppose that means we have to stay here.  You never said where here was.  It doesn’t belong to Severus, does it.”
“Let’s be clear,” Malfoy said. “I’m going to free the spirit of that sacrifice from that tree whether it gets me top marks on my exam or not. I just thought, if I did it for my exam, maybe I wouldn’t get expelled.”
“I—” Malfoy stopped himself and swallowed, immediately looking guilty.  “It wasn’t meant to be a question,” he said weakly.
“All you need to do is watch the memory,” Yin said. “Nothing besides that. Do you want me to come with you?”
“Well, partially thanks to him,” said Savage. “If Baggot hadn’t failed him, he wouldn’t have had to apply again. A third time.”
Harry waited for more, but Draco was apparently done.  “Can I put those protection spells on you now?” Harry asked, after another moment.
Responding to the tug, tilting his head up, Draco smirked. “I know,” he said, resting his chin on Harry’s thigh.
“Prolong your life by binding something’s life magic to you and sacrificing it?” Malfoy asked. “Right, it doesn’t work. Flowers and insects, worms—their life magic is small, brief. Their magic will die out before you would. But if you bound a person’s life to you—or a tree—it could theoretically prolong your life, if it didn’t drive you mad.”
“I’m sorry, Harry.” Soft warm light glowed on Kavika’s face, and Harry realized he loved her. He loved her. “Family obligations. Not only my daughter and her child, but my husband. And then, I should be honest—ambition. Things are not going well with the Deal.”
Draco had been heading out of the lab, but then he turned back to look at Harry.  “Oh,” he said, almost sounding like Draco again, instead of old-Harry.  “Harry,” he said, coming back.  As he reached out for Harry’s hand, he began to change—slimming down, his shoulders narrowing.  His hair grew blond from the roots, the beard on his face growing inward as his face thinned.  “I’m sorry,” Draco said, and now sounded exactly like himself.  “I’m—I’m just as lost in this as you, and I’m trying to make sense of it.  I’m sorry I can’t explain everything, but I’ll—I’ll tell you as much as I know.”
“We don’t need it any more.” Malfoy’s voice was that gentle tone he used with the other trainees, with Teddy, with Nyala. “You’re free.”
Harry took a deep breath of the crisp air, then another, already feeling better, more relaxed—now that he was outdoors, now that he had identified the conversation he wanted to have, now that Teddy knew it too. Teddy would have had any conversation Harry wanted and would have remained calm and soft-spoken throughout, but that was part of the problem. Teddy could be so even-keeled that Harry worried he might not always say when he was hurting, if he was hurting.
In the kitchen, a pan of scones was floating out of the oven to hover over bacon frying itself on the cooker.  A bowl of cream and another bowl with berries were already on the table, and Draco was spelling plates, cutlery, and napkins onto the table.  “Would you like breakfast, Harry?” Draco said, as though nothing at all had happened.
“I have more.” Draco bit Harry’s ear. “I have so many more ways to touch you. Do you like that, darling?”
At the end of the second month, a new brew called Ragerade came on the black market.  Ragerade could make you stronger, but also put you into a berserker rage for up to six hours.  Fights had already broken out on Diagon Alley, Gothat Way, and Havanold Avenue.  Those who drank the brew were worn-out after the rage and easily arrested, but the dealer for the potion remained elusive.  Aurors Vance and Kidder were assigned to the case, and they weren’t going to do anything about it.
“I’ve brought you fish and chips,” Harry said, thrusting the greasy bag at Draco, mostly so that it would block the view of Draco’s gorgeous neck.
“Your friend Ron Weasley is a genius at it,” Draco said, playing a card.  “Quite the best in our year.”
“That’s a bit of a long story,” Draco said, “and I’m sure Harry would like to know who you are.  Do you mind if . . . we stay for a while?”
“Marrying Astoria?” said Ron. “You never know. Maybe that pure-blood fortune was too good to pass up.”
Andromeda’s chimney piece had pictures—loads of them, a pretty lady with purple hair, a boy with wings, and a friendly-looking man with his arm around Andromeda when she was younger.  Standing on tip-toe, Harry looked around and behind the frames, moving them until he found the little bowl.  It was sitting behind a picture of the purple-haired woman, only in this one her hair was brown, her face was sad, and her belly was big.  The pot was an ugly thing that looked as though it had been made by hand, but in it was the same powder they’d used at Number Twelve.
The Higgledy Piggledy was a magical pub in Cambridge, a little ways away from the Academy. The pub drew trainees, instructors, and alumni alike with its homebrew lagers, excellent menu, and superb speakers, which were synced to the wireless. This made it a popular venue for magical world events: the big Quidditch matches mainly; the Wizarding World Cup certainly; but also, the trials. When Harry was still a trainee, his fellow trainees, instructors, and Aurors had gathered by the pub wireless to hear sentences for war criminals.
“Do we call all organizations who seek to help magical and non-magical citizens alike terrorists?” Spragg wanted to know.
“Not all the time,” Harry said, but he chose a story to tell Draco anyway.  It was about the Ragerade, mainly because Draco’s identification of that potion had proven invaluable.  Harry didn’t tell Draco why he’d been on suspension, but he told Draco that he had been on suspension, and that no one else had been able to help until he’d asked Draco, and then Harry had tracked down the brewer, who’d been keeping swamp-things in his back yard in Sussex.
“Lupin,” Harry said. “You’re giving yourself space and breathing really evenly, which is really good. Just remember to protect your chin.”
When Harry asked why Teddy was his godson, Andromeda told him about Remus Lupin and her daughter, Nymphadora Tonks.  “They both died in the war,” she said.
“Potter was trying to figure out something he thinks involved several different brewers,” Draco said.  “If he knew who some of them were, he didn’t tell me.  I was hoping we could find a clue somewhere here.”
Harry couldn’t find Malfoy amidst the crowd, but Rune was distinctly visible in black and gold robes that made him look like Hufflepuff’s fittest bloke since Cedric Diggory, except Cedric had been a child, and Rune was very noticeably a man. He was talking to someone, hands moving with his contagious enthusiasm, cheeks a bit dark with humour or pleasure.
“No, I’m meant to—I’m meant to teach them to protect themselves.” Harry stirred in the algae, suddenly frustrated by the gentleness of them, the ambient warmth of the water. “That’s what I’m meant to do; only, that’s not what Aurors are for—staying out of danger. How is it any better than sending a child to war?
“Fine,” Hermione said. “Bring your posh nosh. But if you’re getting sandwiches, you might as well get four.”
, Harry was going to say, but he didn’t know.  He didn’t know who he was when he grew up—a policeman who wasn’t friends with Draco.  For the first time, it occurred to Harry that he didn’t know what he was capable of.
“But your magic knew.”  Draco nodded across the room at Harry’s fox, who was snoozing in a ball and not paying them any mind.  “We’ve become good friends, your Patronus and I.  I think she’s in love with me.”
“Can I help?” Draco asked, swaggering over to the lab bench where the water was.  “I’m excellent at potions.  What am I saying?  You know that.  I’ll bet I help you with that as well.  Were we Severus’s favourite students?”
The shoulders went stiff.  “I work here,” Malfoy said, after a long moment.  His voice was tight but just as supercilious as it had always been.
“Down,” Draco said, jerking on Harry’s ankle. Harry moved farther down on the bed; then Draco was coming around to the head of the bed, sitting there and shifting himself so his back was to the headboard. “Don’t worry, Harry,” he said. “I’ll get you what you need.” Then he was pointing his wand at his cock, casting a cleaning spell.
Enough people knew that Harry wasn’t keen on Vance that Harry knew he needed help taking Ludville’s statement.  That way, Harry could be absolutely clear on the fact that the witness hadn’t been tampered with.  Ron wasn’t around, and he was Harry’s best friend anyway, so Ron wasn’t exactly the objective observer required for such a situation.  Neither was Savage, but she could at least help, so Harry told her what was going on.
“There isn’t a good spell for that,” Harry said, opening the salve and putting his fingers in.  When he reached out to touch one of Draco’s scabs, Draco flinched.  “I’m not going to hurt you.”
“There.” Melting back into his own form, Teddy nodded across the street, where the real Fenrir was running toward Gringotts.
Glancing down at Draco’s prick, Harry swallowed. Shiny and wet with Harry’s spit, it looked like a goddamn meal, and Harry’s mouth was still watering. He didn’t even know if it was still from the spell Draco had cast on his salivatory glands, or whether it was just him; he just wanted it. “I . . .” Helplessly, Harry licked his lips. “I need you to fuck my arse more.”
“I’m not going to the Caribbean,” Harry said.  “I think that supplier I mentioned may have smuggled some of it into a warehouse here in London, and I’ve got to go check to see if it’s there.”
Harry stayed out for longer than he should have, not thinking about Malfoy in particular, but thinking that he could get what he wanted if he demanded it. But was it right? Life had proven that getting what he wanted didn’t always make things easier. He’d got Ginny, and look how that had turned out.
“Good,” Draco said again. “So good, so beautiful, my good boy, my precious baby, yes, yes, so good for me—” Draco was dropping kisses on him as he babbled—helpless kisses, everywhere, all over Harry’s face, just like he couldn’t control it—again—
Draco threw the plate on the floor, right at the fox, who skittered aside even though the plate and food went right through her.
“He didn’t really hurt me,” Harry said, still a little surprised. “He wasn’t significant enough to hurt me.”
Harry stepped in front of Draco on instinct, Alby’s oily voice recalling enough instances of Draco getting called names that Harry instantly felt the urge to protect him.  “I’ve got a few questions for you,” Harry said.
“I’m so glad you’re not an Auror any longer,” Robards said, turning away. “We’ll use the Penseive Projector in Wizengamot Administrative Services. You two stay in the waiting room—we want an unbiased viewing.”
“You hate me,” Draco said.  “And I hate you.  Even if you changed your mind . . .” Draco took a big wet breath.  “If you changed your mind, I’d still hate you.  I’ll hate you
The corner of Hermione’s mouth pushed in, a small smile. “Okay, you got me. But I do want to hear about you.” She nudged him with her shoulder.
“I told you I would keep you safe,” Harry said, holding out the Auror badge so that they could port to the Ministry for another planning session.
“You were yelling.” Putting his glasses back on, Harry moved ahead of Malfoy, closer to the placards on the wall. The message was scrawled across multiple placards, but the target was obvious: Regina Fairchild. Harry remembered the holiday party, where not everyone had been a pure-blood power couple announcing marriage with the sole intent of making more spoiled, privileged pure-blood babies. Fairchild had brought her Non-mag boyfriend. Harry turned back to Malfoy.
“Yeah. Thanks. I’m his boggart; I’m his Patronus. He’s going to learn to be an Animagus, and he’ll turn into me.”
“Yes.” Harry looked around and found Malfoy, who had lost his broom and was duelling a witch nearby. “Expelliarmus,” Harry told the witch, running toward Malfoy.
“The problem is,” Robards went on, ignoring Harry, “every time we get a lead on an NDEs meeting, they know the second we Apparate anywhere even close, and they Apparate away before we can catch them. The wards are too good. The most we ever get is one or two, and we can’t arrest them for simple meeting—we have no proof of their crimes. But if we could get someone in there with a Ward Bore, Insight Contacts, maybe even a Hearing Raid . . . . If you go to the meeting and act like one of them, we’d finally keep the NDEs in one spot long enough to find out what they’re doing.”
“I say different things work for different people.” Hermione turned her smile on Ron. “Alpacas work for you.”
Harry thought his expression was enough of a reply, but then again, Malfoy wasn’t looking at him. He was strolling about Harry’s office, looking at the shelves, acting as though he owned the place.
“The rumour,” said Teddy. “That Draco’s at the Academy because old school pure-bloods want influence in the Auror force.”
“Fine.” Turning her head away, Parkinson snatched a glass of a smoking liquid from the tray of a house-elf, who had been passing by so discreetly, Harry had barely even seen her. “I’ll bite. Who is Edgar?”
“Edgar?” Malfoy said, sounding surprised. “I say—Edgar Travers?” Now he just sounded ridiculously posh. Who said “
Afterwards, he felt better. It was just a dream. A weird sex dream. Nine months had passed, since Vinicius. Harry had gone plenty longer without. Maybe his body missed him.
“Keeping unauthorized Dementors is against Wizard law.” Malfoy still spoke fast, as though he had all his defenses lined up, in order.
“Well, I mean . . . Malfoy came into my office to—deliver something, and he realized everyone had forgotten about Teddy. It doesn’t make sense, because Teddy wouldn’t—I mean, he could have just left. He
Swallowing again, Harry took another step closer.  “I was wondering if you could help me with a case I’m working on.  The supplier—the illegal potions ring I mentioned.  You always help—later, when you start potions consulting, so I—”
are a legacy, even if your mother was a—”  Draco cut himself off again, looking quickly at Harry as though to check whether he was offended.  Draco went on more slowly, “I just meant you’re from a good family.  Even if you never got to know them, Harry.”
“Anyway, the Dark Lord wasn’t as bad as people make out.  He wasn’t dark at all, really.  Or a lord.  He was—a political opponent.”  The way Malfoy pronounced the words, Harry could tell he was quoting this time.  “But people didn’t like his ideas.” Malfoy’s eyes slid to look at him sideways again.  “But you knew that.  Didn’t you.”
Harry wasn’t sure whether he should do anything about that. He didn’t exactly fancy giving Malfoy special attention, but he usually tried to help trainees who were struggling. Was Malfoy struggling? Maybe he was just being a prat. Maybe Kavika was right, and Harry shouldn’t even have to deal with him. Maybe Harry could go back to the Board and tell them Malfoy was a terrible student, that Malfoy’s application should never have been approved in the first place. He was Harry Potter; they would listen. He shouldn’t have to—
“I’m not the person that I was.” Malfoy’s voice felt sudden. “I’m not the person my mum and dad raised me to be.”
After breakfast they worked on potion things in the laboratory.  Draco didn’t give Harry a book again, instead having Harry help with the indicator solutions.  They made thirteen of them, and five tested positive.  After the first successful one, Harry looked up at Draco and asked—trying to hide his disappointment—“Does this mean you can make a cure?”
“Draco Malfoy wasn’t any older than him,” said another initiate, a girl with glasses and red robes. “And the war is over.”
“Children will be children,” Baggot said, sitting at the head of the table in the faculty meeting room in February, a day after a second message of purist hate-speech had appeared above Fairchild’s placard in the cloakroom.
Malfoy turned to her, smiling at her, then put his lips straight against her ear to repeat what Harry had said. This didn’t make him look very gay.
A gasp filled the room, and Harry jumped off the stool he’d brought into Draco’s bedroom from the lab.  Draco was sitting straight up in bed, as though he hadn’t fallen back at all.  His face definitely looked older.
“I’ll be perfect for you,” Draco said. “I’ll be so good.” Then he slid down to his knees and was opening Harry’s trousers, and Harry let him, let Draco press his face against Harry’s pants, Harry’s cock already hard and pressing against the cotton. Draco mouthed over it, desperate presses of his lips over the fabric while he worked Harry’s trousers down over Harry’s arse. Then Draco was licking it, tongue dampening the fabric as Draco nuzzled Harry’s cock.
For some reason Draco’s words were the hottest thing that Harry had ever heard, and so he swallowed the wet in his mouth and did exactly what Draco said: posted his pretty cunt back onto Draco’s cock, hard.
“I understand,” Malfoy said airily.  He just kept smiling in that light-hearted way, and Harry was so aggravated, and Malfoy looked so good like that, that Harry could feel heat begin low in his chest, spreading up his neck toward his face.  Fuck.  “But we have to stop seeing each other like this,” Malfoy went on in that light, teasing voice.
“There’s my good slut.” Draco’s hand wrapped in Harry’s hair, pushing down. The dildo was also moving down, and Harry chased it with his mouth until the dildo was on Draco’s upper thigh, almost directly parallel to Draco’s own dick. Harry had lost track of it during his orgasm, but Draco’s cock was fully hard again.
He felt as though his insides were too big to contain the things he felt; he couldn’t bear this any longer. Pushing Draco off of him, Harry held him down, got on top. “I need to fuck you,” Harry said, hating how his voice sounded rough when he’d meant to say I love you. “I need to fuck you right now.”
The portrait Draco was pointing to was of a young boy around Harry’s age.  His hair was quite long and black, his expression annoyed.  Both the expression and his hair reminded Harry of the black-haired girl from the previous page, as did his robes.  Everyone else in all the pictures were dressed very nicely, but Sirius Black looked dishevelled, as if he didn’t care what he looked like.  “Who’s that?” Harry asked, pointing to a portrait of a younger boy.  He looked like he could be Draco, if Draco had dark hair and were not quite so handsome.
“Funny story . . .” Mark went on to tell his story about meeting Fairchild, and Harry edged closer to Nyala, who had cast a Notice-Me-Not on herself as soon as Fairchild and Mark had appeared. It didn’t mean no one could see her, but the spectacle of the floating people was distracting enough that when Harry reinforced her Notice-Me-Not with his own, they were able to slip away.
Shacklebolt just nodded. “Keep me apprised as the situation develops.” Then the air cracked again, Shacklebolt disappearing into a shimmer and then nothing.
,” Draco said, then finally pulled away from the fire.  “Would you like to learn the colour spells?”
That meant leaving Draco alone.  Harry wasn’t terribly excited with this option, either, but as it seemed the most viable, Harry proceeded to make preparations.  First, he checked the wards on Tailored Tinctures and Draco’s flat above it.  Draco had been right to worry when they’d seen Vance at Grimmauld Place; if Vance—or Savage, since she’d seen them both at the Auror Office—thought that Harry knew about the potions ring with its illegal supplier and saw Draco with Harry, they might try to silence Draco as well.  But neither Vance nor Savage had been here, and Draco’s wards were fairly good.  Harry added a layer of his own just to be sure, feeling his magic mingle with Draco’s in a way that made his toes curl.
Six days later, Harry was at Rombe Pickle for Sunday brunch. Brunch was over. Andromeda had rushed off to another pottery class. Harry sat there with his coffee. It was almost gone. Teddy sat there too, tall today and unmistakably blond. Teddy’s features were more delicate than his own, almost feminine. He looked how Malfoy would look if Malfoy were pretty.
“Has the culprit been found?” asked Lee Jordan. Lee was the one who had told Harry he better invite all the wizard print journalist as well, instead of offering only the exclusive interview to RevealRadio that Harry had first proposed.
“I didn’t mean it as a bad thing.  I bet . . .”  Malfoy’s cheeks went pink again.  “Well.  It’s cool, is what I mean to say.  That scar.  Did you get that when you—you know—killed him?”  Malfoy was kneeling on the couch, his face still hovering over Harry’s.  His eyes were on the scar.
“Yeah.” Harry put his hand in Draco’s hair. “Yeah.” Harry tugged gently on the fine, silky strands. “It was good.”
,” he added, as the flannel floated into his hand.  “Here.”  Then a wet cloth was on Harry’s forehead, and Mister Malfoy was pushing Harry’s hair back as he wiped up the cold sweat.
“Cheer up,” Ron said, clapping Malfoy on the back, not very gently. “After another eight to ten years, you might even pass Level One—then who knows? Anyone can be an Auror, if they put their mind to it.”
“For digging things out.  I always thought a crane would be cool as well.  Those are for moving big things.  They have a big tower, with a line and a hook at the end, and you can use the hook to move steel beams and things.”
“What?” Harry tried to say, turning to look up at Mister Malfoy, who was holding out a phial.  Harry couldn’t see it too well.  When he reached out, he seemed to be shaking.
“Well.  That’s all over.”  Malfoy didn’t seem to want to talk about it any longer, but then he said, hesitating a little, “Father is very political.”
They’d talked more about it. She’d asked him for names of his other friends. He’d told her she could look at the
Uncertain what to do, Harry stopped slicing.  He should have known he couldn’t get away with it—the few times he had ever got to have cake, it had only been the thinnest, most meagre slice.  But Mister Malfoy had said . . . Harry took his knife out of the cake and began to cut himself a much more modest piece.
“Never mind,” Hermione said. “Hugo was meant to sweep. He thought he could cheat and use his flying broom; it’s frightened Ganymede. “How was your therapy?”
.”  Then Draco looked at him, and his face went soft all over.  “Come along, please, just get changed for me.  We’ll sleep, and then in the morning we’ll figure out the ingredient, and when it’s all fixed, you can grow up and decide whether to be friends.”
“I’ve been paying attention.”  Harry swallowed.  “How is . . . your boyfriend?  Are things . . . good?”
“What?” Harry squeezed the hand at Malfoy’s waist, encouraging. If Malfoy asked, Harry would probably say yes.
Malfoy still seemed tense.  “I suppose . . . I suppose . . .”  Then he was shrugging awkwardly, turning back to the lab bench, pressing on a balance scale and releasing it, just to see it pop up.  “I’ve got to be busy with my job and such, if I’m to be Minister for Magic.  No need to settle down right away.  I was always saying to Mother—do you know, Harfang Munter wasn’t married until he was nearly seventy.  He was too busy fighting duels and running Durmstrang and working on martial magic to bother with girls.  Gilderoy Lockhart isn’t married, and not because he couldn’t be.  He’s got more important things to do.”
Not knowing what to do, Harry squeezed Draco’s shoulders tighter.  He didn’t know what had brought this on at all.
“Harry.  I was in love with you since that day you came back to Slug and Jiggers just so you could yell at Alby on my behalf.”
Harry could feel his body again, fitting into his clothes, too many scars forming against his skin, his hands feeling the command of magic, the beard on his face.  The glasses were too small.  Taking them off, Harry instinctively reached for his wand, magically affixed inside the sleeve.  “
Draco had talked like that to Savage, and he’d sort of talked like that to Harry when Harry had first de-aged.  He hadn’t really talked to him like that since, though, and it rather took Harry aback.
have coffee, and this cup was perfect, so perfectly timed. It was probably poison. It wasn’t from Malfoy; maybe none of them had been from Malfoy, or maybe all of them had been from Malfoy in a nefarious plot to gain Harry’s trust so on graduation day, Harry Potter could finally be poisoned. It was definitely poison, and Harry drank every last drop. It soothed him down to the bones.
“I haven’t made tea,” Andromeda said, returning with a tray held in her hands.  “I’ve made hot chocolate.  Harry never got to have any.”
Harry wasn’t fighting that battle just now, though; he was fighting this one. “Why is it so important that I pass Malfoy? If it’s not Lucius’s money, what is it?” Harry asked, then made his voice sound conciliatory. “Maybe if I just had a better understanding, I could help.”
“Did you need something?” Draco placed a bookmark in the pages of his book with the same precise care that his adult self always did it.  “You could have said.”
, and it had been that way for so long—Malfoy bringing him coffee, Malfoy guarding his door, Malfoy pining while Harry just tried to live his life. Harry had been struggling for so long, just trying to make it through the days, that when he imagined himself with Malfoy, he imagined falling and Malfoy being there to catch him—but it worked both ways.
“It’s all right,” Draco said, lifting his chin.  “I don’t like you either.  You’re much different than I expected, although—I wish I’d found out you couldn’t read.  I could have used that against you.”
“Draco,” Harry said, holding one of the bandages steady so he could tape it.  “Absolutely nothing about this is kinky.”
Harry eyed him, suspecting Malfoy was playing some sort of trick, but at the same time, Harry remembered the breathing exercises he used to do, placing his hands behind his neck so his arms would pull down on his shoulders. He’d helped other students physically before, showing them stances, helping them get the correct posture, and Harry had decided to treat Malfoy like any other student. He’d decided to forget the collective shite of their past, because that had seemed the best way to move on. He just hadn’t thought Malfoy was going to be such a needy student.
“Guess you’ll just have to wait and see.” Harry poured half the memories into the Pensieve, leaving the other half for Draco.  Harry waited for Draco to take the jar and pour out the memories, then said, “How’s your mum?”
It almost made Harry want to help somehow.  Instead, he said “My uncle will be wondering where I am.”
“Hey, everybody,” said Fairchild, her voice magically amplified as well. She and Mark were floating above the crowd. “My name’s Regina. I’m a witch, and this is my non-magical fiancé, Mark.”
“Hm.” Sibanyoni nodded, sipped his Coke, then again said, “Hm. Did you tell him that? The painful mirror of humanity. Did you hold it up to him?”
“No,” Harry murmured, a warm feeling spreading through his chest, where the ache had been.  “It wouldn’t.”
The Dementors emerged like slow smoke, coiling out of the trunk in slowly growing waves of shadow. Their hoods slowly tuned, taking in the room, as though taking in its scents.
the trunk, then all was black and shadow. Next, the face of the non-mag, still unmoving under the effect of the Full-Body Bind. Next, the face of a Dementor, that grey skin, those dead eyes, that black hole of a mouth.
An alpaca appeared in the room between them, standing on Sibanyoni’s carpet. Something about the alpaca made Harry feel afraid Sibanyoni had Summoned a real alpaca, which was worrisome, because what would the poor thing think? But the alpaca did not seem perturbed by its surroundings; it just stood there with its large, well lashed eyes and its crooked mouth, which was curled into an amusing expression.
Still, they almost always made chit-chat at the beginnings of sessions, so, while Kavika made the coffee, Harry sat and asked after Nadia. They talked about the wizard doctors, Kavika’s son-in-law, and porting to Beirut. “It’s got to be brutal, jumping between time zones,” Harry said.
you ripped me open?  What is it?  You like me having been your victim?  That get you off?  Because I can’t figure it otherwise, why you like me, how we could ever be
“The Higgledy Piggledy has a very good icebox lily cucumber sandwich,” Harry said. “I’m going to pick one up—have you lot already eaten?”
, Harry almost blurted, but managed to contain himself.  “Er.”  Harry licked his lips.  “So, what have you been doing instead?”
Draco Malfoy stood in a doorway, an insouciant shoulder leaning against the frame.  He was still too thin, his hair still dull.  The way he lounged there, however, as though he hadn’t a care in the world—when Harry had got him sacked from his last job and was on his way to getting him sacked in this one—reminded Harry so much of the way Malfoy had looked in school that Harry swallowed hard.  He looked away.
Harry looked speechlessly down at the broom, so surprised that for a moment, he just stood there. Malfoy had disappeared from Harry’s mind as soon as the press conference started—Malfoy, who had come to distract the reporters. Instead, Malfoy had left the broom.
“But how can they charge you?” Harry had asked later.  “Can’t you just say you’re an Auror?  Isn’t it the law?”
“Cheer up.” Malfoy had been leaning against Harry’s desk again, but now he stood up straight. “I’m going to fix it.”
Harry entered his office, and there Malfoy stood, back to the door, limned by the drab dreary light through Harry’s window. His hair looked almost silvery, and Harry’s heart tightened in sympathy. They had not really talked since the mission, not privately. Trainees had interview him; students had talked to him and about him. Malfoy had returned to take his remaining exams, but that was all.
Usually they went to the lab for a bit after that, Draco setting out more things to simmer, soak, or dry overnight and mixing things together so they could blend the proper amount of time.  Once he had to proof something, and another time some sea cucumbers had to go into a box to chill.  He said that with the five ingredients they had already found, he thought he understood the original potion that had de-aged Harry, except for one ingredient.  If they could find that one ingredient, Draco thought he could make a cure, but he also said it was that one ingredient that had made the original potion so powerful.  It had to be something special and unusual—and maybe illegal—or else Draco would have figured out what it was already.  Sometimes he wrote in a ledger, saying he was keeping track of what he was doing.
“It’s not the sort of shop where people come in to buy potions off the rack,” Draco said, directing the pans from the cooker over to the sink as well, then doing something that made a few bubbles float in the air.  Soap, Harry guessed.  “I brew to spec.”
Harry looked at Draco, the downward twist to his mouth, the smudges still under his eyes.  Harry didn’t think Draco slept very much on the bunk beds, even though whenever Harry had checked in the middle of the night, Draco had been lying there.  He certainly didn’t snore.
Though the Academy grounds still had its anti-Apparition wards and buildings their protection wards, the wards that had concealed it from the sight and knowledge of Non-magicals had dropped. People gathered on the green, standing in the spot where the Timothy Tree had been, and ten times as many people crowded outside the Pallas Arch, waiting to enter as though to see some sort of miracle within. The sound of honking car horns and shouting people was almost deafening atop an undercurrent of sirens.
“I’m not better,” Malfoy piped up. “I never stole any dragons or fought any trolls or basilisks or anything like that, so now’s my chance to really shine.”
Harry remembered the way Malfoy used to dress—everything new with a perfect fit.  The restrictions prevented Malfoy from doing magic now, so he couldn’t tailor his clothes, and he didn’t have the galleons for those expensive fabrics that made you want to touch.  Harry had never wanted to touch in school.  He hadn’t.  Malfoy was a prat; he was a
The plant was some kind of bush.  Peeking through its leaves, Harry could make out the person who had opened the door.  He didn’t look like Dudley at all, for he was old like a grown-up, and his hair wasn’t nearly as blond as Dudley’s.  He was quite large, however—sort of like how Uncle Vernon would look, if Uncle Vernon looked a bit more like Aunt Petunia.
Harry held him for a minute, smelling Draco’s hair again, his sweat, listening to his heartbeat. Opening his mouth, Harry set his teeth on the curve of Draco’s shoulder.
, Harry had wanted to say, but didn’t, because of Draco’s mum.  It was true, though.  Dragons had been bred basically to the point of insanity, sort of like—border collies.  If you didn’t give them something to hoard and protect and fight for they got violent.  Charlie liked them, but he’d always been a bit nuts as well.  “I just mean,” Harry said, “foxes are neat.”
“I don’t,” Harry said.  “I didn’t even realize that was why I was always coming to you.  Not for a long time, anyway.”
Startled, Harry lowered his wand. He didn’t know anyone with a bumblebee Patronus, and then the bumblebee began to talk in the voice of its owner. “I found out where Teddy’s been. He’s in Diagon, by Fortesque; the wards have dropped; please come.”
.”  Draco’s voice was vicious, his features still contorted in that hateful way.  “He hasn’t got anything except—except that
Harry expected Draco to still be smirking or to make some kind of snide comment, but he was just standing there, looking oddly blank.
; I’ve sucked their cocks; I’ve smoked fags; I got piercings; I worked in a Muggle restaurant; I’m a shopkeeper’s assistant!  I’ve kept none of them!”
“Are you all right?” Harry asked.  He’d come to check on Draco once his Patronus had told him Draco had aged again, then he’d told Draco about the potions he needed.
“That’s also been mentioned,” Malfoy said in his light, quick way, and it made Harry realize he had barely talked to Malfoy since the start of term. Maybe a few times in classes, to give him assignments or comment on his work.  “Everyone mentions it all the time,” Malfoy went on, “how well I do.”
“Never heard of him,” Malfoy said dismissively, but then he went on.  “He really went from being an Auror to Minister for Magic?”
“It’s nothing,” Draco said, shoving the cloth and bundle of papers into the drawer and then snapping it shut with his wand.
Harry usually came to stay at Rombe Pickle in late August, before the start of the terms at both the Academy and Hogwarts. This year the visit had a different flavour, as Teddy had graduated Hogwarts.
After Harry dismissed the initiates, Malfoy left, but a group still lingered. Harry knew why. He just didn’t want to have to deal with it.
Harry’s heart twisted in his chest.  “I meant,” Harry said, just so Malfoy didn’t get the wrong idea, “we didn’t always wear uniforms on trips to Hogsmeade, and there was the Yule Ball, and you played Quidditch.”
“Right.”  If Draco had de-aged the same amount as Harry had, Malfoy would be eleven.  Christ, what had Draco done?  The letter had mentioned an exchange.  He’d traded away his age.
“Usually, they’re about people I care about getting hurt.” Harry was still playing with the crystals, pulling them apart so that they floated in the air, then watching them float back together, clicking into a single twisted object with a snap. “Sometimes it’s because of things that happened—in the past. At Hogwarts. In the war. Other times it’s—from when I was on the Force. Sometimes it’s—it’s my fault they’re hurt, and I don’t . . . I don’t know why.”
“I think about what I want. I think about what I want all the time.” Malfoy turned back to stare at him again, that unnerving, unblinking stare. “There’s not a minute of any day goes by when I don’t think about what I want and how badly I want it.”
“What about the puppies?”  Malfoy was beginning to smirk—an honest to God, old-fashioned Malfoy smirk, just like the ones from school.  It made him look less gaunt—healthy, almost.  Good.
Malfoy went, and Harry closed the door.  Jesus.  He was going to have such a fucking headache over this.
The décor would have surprised Harry once, the threadbare repeated sofas and the messy repeated desks and the lively bookshelves nothing like the pristine Malfoy in expensive and severely laced wizard robes from his first years at Academy. Since the end of Malfoy’s second year, however, he had been all threadbare jumpers and loose t-shirts and occasional women’s clothes, except for his one nice suit, which he was wearing tonight. Looking at Malfoy’s flat, Harry realized Malfoy must wear what he wore the last two years not because he had come out, but because he had been disowned. They had happened at the same time. Harry just hadn’t considered what that could really mean for Malfoy’s Gringotts’ account—or lack thereof, according to Lionel Greengrass.
Graduation day dawned grey and drizzly and remained grey and drizzly, unlike the break-out sun of the years before. Level Ones became Level Twos, and instructors gave Level Twos their graduating certificates under the Timothy Tree. Everyone attended—the Board, guest instructors, the faculty, the trainees—except trainees who had failed and were thereby excluded. This year, neither Travers nor Malfoy were eligible to attend, and no one could stop talking about it.
Harry didn’t want to look around the room. He didn’t want to look around the table and see the faces of Death Eaters, the Muggle Studies professor suspended over them.
“Oh,” Harry said, shuddering under this touch. His cock was so hard that his arse felt desperate for it. He arched his back a little, thrusting his arse toward Draco.
Eventually Draco stopped crying, but somehow, he was still shuddering, as though dry sobs still wracked his body.  “Where’s my mum?” he asked, after finally going still.
“You’re brewing a cure for vampirism?” Harry asked, a bit worried Malfoy might be a vampire.  Every time Harry saw Malfoy, he looked better than that first day Harry had seen him at Slug and Jiggers.  He’d filled out a bit; his hair had some life, his cheeks some colour.  Even his clothes fit a bit better, but in Harry’s opinion Malfoy was still worryingly pale and a bit too slender, compared to what he had been in fifth year.  Maybe this was just what Malfoy looked like grown-up, but Harry didn’t like it.
Harry scanned the crowd, finding Malfoy easily enough. He had on a sleek three-piece grey suit—so much for his new style of women’s shirts and threadbare jumpers. He was dancing with Nyala, who had on an absolute cake of a pink dress and looked as though she positively glowed. Not far from them, dancing with Penelope, was a bloke in gold and red, deeper than Gryffindor red, but still striking, setting off brown skin, an extremely expressive face, and wavy black hair. Harry felt he recognized the bloke from somewhere, and he wondered why Vinicius was not talking about
Teddy waited. When Harry didn’t go on, Teddy’s voice was all patience. “You assumed I became pen pals with an ex Death Eater who tried to get Hagrid fired? Multiple times?”
The wards around the Academy, of course, made it impossible. Harry wouldn’t do that to Penelope anyway.
“But . . .” Draco’s eyes sought out Harry’s Patronus.  She had a wary eye on Heloise, who had gone to perch on the back of Draco’s chair when Harry had taken away her letters.  “But what do you mean, it knew what you felt?”
Harry wasn’t afraid of being blamed. He was afraid of something else, something he wasn’t sure he knew how to articulate.
Malfoy sucked in a tight breath, eyes snapping down to where Harry had grabbed his upper arm. Malfoy looked at it so long that Harry let him go. “Did I hurt you?” Harry asked.
“Maybe save it for lunch,” Kavika said, and Harry felt himself smile. “When will you talk to them about Draco?”
Then the tap came at the window, and Harry opened it.  When Heloise came in, Harry’s heart jumped into his throat and lodged there until he got the note unfolded.  The intervals between Draco’s age-jumps had not been increasing in a mathematically predictable way, not that Harry would be able to calculate it even if they were.  He hadn’t been much better at maths than he had at reading, and then Hogwarts hadn’t taught it anyway.  Draco could be twenty-eight by now, or he could be thirty-two and remember everything.
“Hilda is only interested in past injustice,” Spragg said in his ever-pleasant voice. “Never present.”
“Yes,” Malfoy said, chewing on his lip, “but the problem is always personnel—how to get enough magical people to talk to enough non-magical. I thought if
“Do you mind if I make myself one? While I do it, you could perhaps tell me a little bit about yourself—that will make this starting part less awkward.”
“Like I said, we’re still not sure,” Harry said, “but the people on it have been doing weird things.”
Harry’s shoulders sagged.  He wasn’t sure he could do this any longer.  He wasn’t sure he could stand it, how little Draco thought of himself.  “Draco,” he said quietly.  “I’ve already been profaned.”
“Oh, sure.” George gulped his Butterbeer, then wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. “Obviously. If it was a well-made body, I wouldn’t be asking the question.”
Thanks again to icmezzo and seraphcelene, without who this would not have been written, and to siemejay, without whom there would be many typos and less loveliness in the world.
” Harry put out his hand, and Ron dropped the rectangle into it. “I shrank it. I thought you might not have read it.”
Harry remembered Draco saying his father was important, and then they were at a set of heavy oak doors.  Draco opened one, revealing a large room walled off into cubicles.  The cubicles they could see in front of them had desks within them, as well as a chair at each desk and a filing cabinet beside.  Although the desks were obviously used frequently, no one sat at them.  In Draco’s body, Harry was tall enough to see over the cubicle walls.  No one else appeared to be around, but if they were sitting at a desk they wouldn’t be visible.
, because with you, I wanted—I wanted.”  Draco’s breath hitched, which seemed to cause his whole expression to change, breaking down. “I—I don’t want to live in a world without my mum in it.”
After a few more minutes, Harry remembered he was allowed to chew his food, and eventually he slowed down. “Did you make them?”
But Harry wasn’t a real person with real human feelings; he didn’t trust himself to know what Malfoy wanted, to be whatever Malfoy needed, not when he’d already fucked it up so badly.  Fairly certain at this point that anything thing he did would be hurting Malfoy, Harry tried not to move.
“Why isn’t it working?  Malfoy Manor!”  Crawling out of the hearth, Draco grabbed the whole pot of Floo powder from the chimney piece.  His fistful lit up the whole lab this time, the green flames making a bursting sound before licking happily at the sides of the stone hearth.  Draco climbed in again.  “Malfoy Manor.  Where’s my house?  Malfoy Manor!  Goyle Park!”
“Okay,” said Ron. “You can look after his safety if he’s your student. What I meant was, you don’t have to put yourself on the line. You don’t have to invest in him.”
Mouth twisting, Harry set his coffee down. “I think Malfoy told him not to make it worse for me.” When Harry looked up again, Kavika had on this calm, placid look, which Harry thought she sometimes did when she was secretly interested. Most of the time she was so genuine with him, but she never shared everything;
“He’s the one who gave you all those sleeping potions, right?” Yin added an avocado next. “How’s he doing?”
The fawn had stood when the chair clattered to the floor, its legs looking wobbly under it.  Now it stood there staring at Harry, its little silver ears perked, its tail up.
With a dramatic flourish, Malfoy produced a small scroll from a pocket in his robe.  The robe itself was a drab little thing, threadbare and grey, just like the shabby clothes Malfoy wore underneath it.
Harry whined again, sucking hard, arching his back and thrusting into the air behind him to get more of that faux cock.
“I can give it to you,” Malfoy whispered, rocking his hips again. “I notice everything you need, don’t I? And I always give it to you.”
“Nudity?” Harry glanced at himself incredulously in the mirror. He’d intended to Banish the sweat from the vest and put it back on, but just for that, he’d leave it off. “Because I don’t dress like a nun?”
“We’re gathered here today to discuss the horrific implications of Reveal on the wizarding economy, culture, and way of life,” Parkinson was saying. “First, let’s discuss our political efforts.”
“Yes.”  Harry held up the potion.  “It’s turned a nice colour,” he said, because the swirling storm in the glass had resolved into something almost completely clear, with just a trace of blue.  This matched the colours that adult-Draco had predicted, so Harry was feeling pretty good about it.
“I’ve got to leave for a bit,” Harry said, trying to make it sound as though he were going nowhere special and that Draco would not be in danger if left alone.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “You breathe humility out your pores, Potter. Don’t cake false modesty on top. Let it breathe.”
“Maybe that’s my own business,” Draco said, his gaze dropping again.  “Leave me some decency, at any rate.”
“It comes in handy,” Harry said, even though his ability to resist Veritaserum wasn’t necessary in answering questions about his beard.  Working most days, he didn’t really see the point in shaving.  He hadn’t been on a date in over a year.  Having a beard was just easier; the most he had to do was keep it trimmed and shave around the edges to keep the short-boxed shape.  He hadn’t had a haircut in a while either, but Malfoy didn’t need to know Harry was just lazy.  Let him wonder.
“We’ll just clean this up,” Mister Malfoy said, but Harry could barely hear him, his stomach already heaving.  “Do you want to—”
“Here is Alphard,” Draco said, pointing out a picture of a man who looked about as dour as the tyrannical old woman.  “He’s my great uncle, and not very important for the purposes of this family history.”  He turned the page to reveal another old man.  “And here is Cygnus Black, my grandfather on my mother’s side.”
Draco’s gaze swept down.  He was still holding onto the front of Harry’s robes.  His voice was quiet when he said, “I feel like you have higher standards than that.”
“All right.” Harry nodded at him. “You changed. Good for you. Am I supposed to forget it ever happened?”
“Do you think someone’s attacking the Academy?” Teddy went on, brow furrowed. “Do you think it’s like . . . a Death Eater?”
“That’s ridiculous,” Harry said, putting his arm around Draco’s shoulders.  “People are allowed to see you cry.”
been there—Merlin.  You’re really not afraid.”  Draco frowned.  “No wonder you got sorted into Gryffindor.”
“I meant he’s done it poorly,” Harry said. “He’s obviously been trying; he just—is . . .” Harry thought about it, Malfoy’s marks, the parts that gave Malfoy the most trouble, other than the Patronus. “To tell the truth,” Harry said, “Draco Malfoy is bloody terrible at Dark Arts.”
“Yes.”  Draco sniffled.  “I suppose that—I suppose it turns out all right.  In the end.  But I can’t help . . . I’m so worried about it.”
“Smile,” Ron said, putting his hand on Malfoy’s shoulder, then turning toward the library’s doors, which burst open.
“Not particularly,” Harry said, because Minister Fudge and the lack of the Deal were all anyone was talking about these days. Then he realized he had done it as well; he had brought it up. He was being an arse again, and maybe he was torturing this poor therapist for being young and a little bit in awe of Harry Potter, which wasn’t fair. Finding someone not in awe of Harry Potter was rather difficult, and he tended not to hold it against people—particularly young people. The trainees got over it soon enough; so would Duggings. “It’s my godson,” Harry finally supplied.
And deeper, pressing into him until he was pushing Draco, and Draco was stumbling backwards, clumsily backing up until Draco was at the wall between two of the hearths.  Harry slammed him up against it.  “Oh,” Draco breathed, shocked.  His eyes were very round, his lips very wet.
This seemed to snap Draco out of it, causing him to look down at Harry.  Petunia said that Dudley could be an astronaut, but Harry didn’t think Dudley could.  “No,” Draco said, smiling faintly.  “Not an astronaut.”
“Did it recognize me?” Harry asked, looking around as though some part of the house might nod to him or say hello.
The next day, Kingsley Shacklebolt, unable to gain agreement on the Deal, faced a vote of no confidence from the Wizard Council. He lost the vote fifteen to thirteen, with one member abstaining.
“Ah.”  The cold expression melted.  The eyes were very green, Harry noticed.  He’d known already, but he hadn’t really known what it could feel like to have them looking at you like that, as though they could see right through you.  It wasn’t a very nice feeling.  “No one thinks we’re friends.”
“Are you going to tell me what we did?”  If Harry hadn’t been in Draco’s body, he would have pushed up his glasses again.
Only rarely had their social connections interfered with his therapy, but Harry still remembered what she had told him from the beginning. She was helping him because she knew his particular special circumstances, and because he had been in a very bad place when Hermione had first reached out to her. Kavika had warned him, however, that when their personal lives intersected, she might not be able to help.
“Wand slipped,” Malfoy said in that light, quick way. “Travers distracted me. Are you sure that kid is all right? Politically, I mean. I think he’s a purist.”
Here, now, Leck Hall, Baggot was speaking. “Of course we’ll conduct an investigation. Obviously, it’s a bad thing. Sometimes bad things can’t be stopped. Sometimes, you have to work with what’s there.”
“It’s true,” Spragg said, in his young, passionate voice. “I don’t see any Aurors questioning any Revealers about the latest ward-drop. How is that making the world safer for Vulnerables?”
Malfoy, distracted, was glancing down. Realizing he was still holding Malfoy’s arm, Harry quickly looked down at the Mark again, seeing if he could sense the magic that bound it. When Harry touched it, Malfoy shivered, and that was quite enough. Harry let him go. “You tried extracting blood from it, for the blood oath?”
Draco’s lip curled.  He struggled with the bedclothes, then finally untangled them from his legs.  “I want some clothes.”
to know why Robards was doing this, except Ron was using his Reasonable Adult voice—the one he had gained around the time Harry was having trouble finding his. That it wouldn’t really hurt Malfoy to stay was absolutely true.
Andromeda was magical too, so she didn’t think he was a freak, and she didn’t have any cats.  That made her much better than most adults, even though Harry didn’t like the way she teased.  She seemed to tease quite a lot, but he was never sure that she was doing it, and usually when it happened he was pretty certain it was him she was laughing at.  Harry, who was very used to being teased in a mean way, didn’t find it funny.  Draco hadn’t teased him a lot, but when he had, Harry had always felt in on the joke.
Harry had dreamed of this, Malfoy moving against him, confident and sure, Malfoy attuned to his every need, Malfoy responsive to his every desire. Why had he dreamed of this? Why Malfoy, when there were other people who were just as good, who had never hurt him?
Malfoy’s hand felt cool and soothing against Harry’s hot skin, only Harry didn’t remember being hot.  He’d had chills.  He’d felt cold, hadn’t he, except he could feel the sweat at his temples, and Malfoy’s hand was magical.  Harry remembered those long, slim fingers, and this was a bad idea.  This was such a bad idea, and Harry was ashamed, so deeply ashamed of how good this felt.
That morning he spent the morning time skimming through his notes about the Dark Mark. One of the only things he missed about being an Auror were the puzzles, for while Hermione had been better at solving them, Harry had exceled at pursuing them. He had difficulty letting go; it had led him down many dark paths as both a student of Hogwarts and an Auror in the Ministry, but that had not changed his essential nature. When presented with something that seemed wrong, Harry found that very few things could distract him until he set it right.
I want you, Harry wanted to protest, but Draco’s mouth was covering his, warm and inviting while Draco’s hand did things to his cock, things no one had ever done before because it was a cock. It wasn’t a plaything to be poked and tested and explored. Everyone who’d got their hands on it before knew what to do with it, how to make it feel good, how to get it off, except for maybe Ginny in the beginning, but they’d learned quickly and together. Draco didn’t seem at all interested in that. Instead he was interested in torture, touching it softly and warmly with firm strokes—the way it should be touched—then suddenly changing, scraping his nail along it, tugging it too roughly.
Chan brought up her Kneazle as well as Bloomenthal, a fellow trainee who was one of her best friends. For the presentation, Chan asked Bloomenthal to cast a Stinging Hex at the Kneazle. When Bloomenthal did so, Chan used her love for the Kneazle to transfer the Stinging Hex to herself, which Bloomenthal immediately healed. Most of the trainees seemed relieved the Kneazle hadn’t been hurt.
“A couple weeks ago,” Draco said, apparently not noticing that he hadn’t mentioned anything specific happening, other than Theo ‘getting the wrong idea.’  “It doesn’t matter,” Draco went on, tossing his head.  “I’ll meet other boys at Hogwarts.  I’ll make much better friends with them, and then—that will show him.”
Harry sort of wanted to slap him, the way Hermione once had when Malfoy had called her names. Travers was looking at Malfoy with slowly growing approval, and Harry wanted to slap him too. He was only a little older than Teddy; it didn’t matter. He deserved to be slapped.
The pub grew louder behind Harry, then softer, then footsteps. A voice. “You don’t know where he goes either, then.”
“Obviously, not everyone,” Hermione said hastily. “I meant—Revealers, anti-purists. My voters, essentially. How do I convince them we need all of it? We need the Ministry; we need the Aurors, and we need the activists on the outside who will always push us to be more, to be better.”
Ever since learning he was a wizard, Harry had spoken to very few non-magical people. While he was at Hogwarts, he had really only spoken to the Dursleys. After Hogwarts, Harry hadn’t even spoken to them. He’d met Hermione’s parents once. Sometimes as an Auror, he would have to deal with non-magical bystanders, but usually not in any real capacity—the Obliviators came in to handle the Statute, and Harry rarely had to actually talk to them. The most interaction Harry had had with any non-magical people had been with Mark over the past few years, and then more recently the other non-magical members of Teddy’s Order.
“Don’t mention it.” Malfoy turned to look at the non-mag man. “I do this all the time. Rescuing people. Stopping bad guys. It’s kind of my job.”
“It’s some kind of historic landmark or something,” Malfoy said carelessly, as though he hadn’t sat under the Timothy Tree countless times—for its shade, for its calm, for its company.
Maybe he would just wait until someone else came in to use the toilet. When someone else came in to use the toilet, he could pretend he was washing his hands, then dry them, then leave.
Harry, who had been sitting on the edge of his desk to watch, as this exercise usually required very little interference from him, took a sip of coffee. “Not everyone has gone.”
“I can hold the book for you, Harry.”  His voice eagerly solicitous, Draco grabbed the book away.  “I’ll keep your place, so you can look at the letters.  That’s what I do for Vince.  I’m a good friend, aren’t I?”
“We could sic the Rita Skeeter-lites on Malfoy, if you want us to,” Hermione said. “At least he deserves the trolling.”
“That’s it, Harry,” Draco rasped. “Fuck like you want to fuck. Fuck like I’m here to fuck, not for any other reason, like you need it. You need it, don’t you? You need a good fucking.”
The next day was a Sunday, which meant there would be no Academy classes, but Harry would see Malfoy at Rombe Pickle for a meeting of the Order of the Phoenix. The Order had grown since autumn, taking on more and more non-magical members—friends and family of non-mag-born magical people. By the time Malfoy rolled out of the Floo, the room was already packed, but Malfoy walked straight to Harry, a bundle of scrolls under his arms.
Harry read for a while, until Draco’s finger fell off the page, his head against Harry’s shoulder.  Careful not to wake Draco up, Harry pointed his wand, Levicorpus’ing Draco back up to the top bunk.
The blond hair was lank, lacking shine.  The shoulders were spikier than Harry remembered, and the clothes were quite notably un-posh—but Harry would know him anywhere.
“What word would you choose?” Teddy said a while later, as though there had not been a break in conversation at all.
There was a pause, and Harry looked up.  Draco quickly turned the page.  “I’m not sure.  What sort of punishment do you mean?”
Malfoy looked back up at him. “I said some things to you,” he said slowly. “At one point. About—I said that I—that I knew you. That I was
“Here,” Harry said, turning from him to rummage on the desk. “I brought this for you.” Turning back to Malfoy, Harry held out a bottle of liquid.
Meanwhile, the fox walked over to Harry’s side of the couch and sat down, looking up.  The fox seemed quite thin, something wilder and savage about it than the foxes at the zoo.  It looked like a fox who’d gone through the winter, cold, with barely anything to eat.  Harry couldn’t take his eyes from it.  “It can understand you?”
“How could you tell?” Mrs. Mulpepper said, her puffy red eyes curious.  “You didn’t even distil it!”
A few of the trainees tittered nervously, which was expected. Harry’s fling with Andre Ricci had been all over the news when it had happened. Harry hadn’t really thought of himself as bisexual when it had been going on. He hadn’t really been thinking of anything except for the fact that Andre was the first person since Ginny that he had wanted, but the press had had quite the day defining him, and Harry supposed the definition worked.
“I’m what?” Malfoy demanded.  “I can handle it; I was handling it.  I’m not one of your little friends!  Go pick a fight with someone else.”
“He’s always getting things wrong, you see,” Alby went on.  “Or it’s possible he’s doing it deliberately—he
“Right. And I had to quit my band to go to Academy.” Looking off thoughtfully into space, Teddy gave his slow nod, then looked back at Harry, abruptly focusing. “Are we good?”
Mister Malfoy’s five-p eyes shone brighter in the firelight.  “And Harry,” he added softly, “you don’t have to hide things from me.  You don’t have to pretend to feel differently than you do.”
Harry thought about this, staring at a spot between them on the floor. It was empty after all. He looked up. “Close to when I started, you had me make a list,” he said, “of everyone I could go to in a time of need. You said it was different than seeing a therapist, that I had to remember they were friends.”
“I’m sorry.”  Harry pulled Draco closer again, his hand in Draco’s hair letting Draco know he could put his head back against Harry’s chest, his face against Harry’s neck if he wanted.  “I’m sorry,” Harry said again.  “It’s stupid.  It’s going to sound so stupid to you.”
Harry had been concerned for Nyala on the first day of hand-to-hand, mainly because Nyala had said she herself was concerned. However, she’d also said she could handle it, and she hadn’t wanted to make a big deal of it, so Harry had not singled her out on the first day when they had chosen their partners. After Harry had told people to pair up, Malfoy had not hesitated for a second. He’d walked straight across the room to Nyala, holding out his hand. They had been partners ever since, and Nyala had excelled because of it; Malfoy’s instruction was always quiet, infinitely patient, and gentler than Harry had known Malfoy could be.
Harry had no idea what Tanglewood Abbey was, but Draco’s disappearance propelled him into sudden action.  Grabbed a handful of Floo powder, he threw it in the fireplace.  Putting his head in, he said, “Tanglewood Abbey,” then pushed himself farther into the hearth to come rolling out the other side.
Malfoy was standing by one of the shelves of memories, the morning light making his skin and hair look almost white. His robes were severe and black, as though he were in mourning. Harry had never seen him dress so severely, and for just one moment, Harry thought of Snape. The turncoat.
Harry wasn’t kidding anybody.  Draco had had to stay in Azkaban to await his trail; then there’d been the trial, then the destruction of the Manor, then the magical restriction.  For the next ten years of memories, he wouldn’t be allowed magic.  All of it would be painful for him.
“Yes what?” Draco cast the lower spell, the one that went inside Harry’s body, taking away the open, relaxed feeling of having come, tightening the parts inside him that could release more come.
Draco’s eyes widened, soft surprise colouring his features, but then it was tucked away swiftly. “Of course,” he said, leaning in to kiss Harry’s again. “Of course, you like it. You’ve never been anyone else’s darling before, only mine. You’re only mine. I’m going to make you feel so good. You’re going to feel so good, Harry.”
Harry wanted to ask, but he had already known that.  At twenty-one Draco had said Harry was his ghost, the one Dumbledore had mentioned. And at seventeen Draco had told Harry that Dumbledore’s ghost was desire.  “All right,” Harry said.  Taking out his wand, he waved his Patronus away.  “Tell me if you need me.”  Harry turned to go.
Draco took his arm away from his eyes in time to see Harry spit on his own hand then bring it back down. “Oh my fuck,” Draco breathed, when Harry’s hand wrapped around it again. As if unable to help it, he arched into Harry’s hand. “Merlin. Fuck. Fuck.”
Right. He was kind of amazing, and more gorgeous than ever if wizard photos were any proof. Malfoy hadn’t seemed like he was paying attention when Rune’s Order had been discussed at the last Phoenix meeting. Then again, pretending not to pay attention was a trick of Malfoy’s.
Draco’s grey eyes were big, his mouth red from kissing. “I want . . .” His hands were on Harry’s dressing gown. Then his lips were again on Harry’s, closing on Harry’s bottom lip, sucking, warm and soft and so fucking sweet as he opened the dressing gown, pushing it off Harry’s shoulders. Draco spoke between kisses, pulling off the dressing gown as Harry helped. “Can we—I want to—I want—Harry.” Draco kissed him, then spoke in a rush. “I want to shag in your bed. Please?”
Harry did so, finding the memory he had chosen, one that had come to mind recently. Spooling it onto his wand, he directed the memory into the pool.
Malfoy’s features immediately softened. His reply was under Mark’s, who was saying, “She’s probably off fighting the revolution herself,” but Harry heard it. “I’d do my best,” Malfoy murmured.
“I thought . . .”  Thinking was difficult, with the way Draco’s teeth were teasing Harry’s ear.  “I thought—Slytherins couldn’t be relied upon to keep their promises.  That’s what you said.”
“Old hair, precisely.”  Draco’s lips twitched into a smile.  “These are hairs from your older self, which can help me determine how old to make you when we fix it.  Don’t worry, Harry,” Draco added, apparently seeing Harry’s disgusted expression.  “I’m just taking them as a precaution; we may not need them.”
“And how about you?” Harry looked down, saw that he was rubbing the scar on his hand, but thinking of something else, he didn’t think to make himself stop it. “Excited about the holiday party?”
Draco had stopped whinging altogether when they got to Flourish and Blotts, so Harry still knew the way to Draco’s heart, he guessed.  Then they’d got more fish and chips at the Leaky, and now they’d stopped in front of Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes.  “You can’t make me.  There’s no way I’m going into a shop run by—” Draco stopped talking, his attention caught by something in the window.
“No.” Draco tugged a bit on Harry’s hand. “It’s fine now. I’m fine. I was just . . . I got a little . . . worked up.”
Harry didn’t think he was doing so well, as Draco seemed to be following some sort of plan that Harry didn’t understand at all, but he kept quiet as they went back to old-Harry’s desk.  There, Draco gathered up all the papers he had left lying there when Savage had been watching them, as well as several files from the cabinet.
“There was an improvement in the building of ships and new trade routes through Asia that led to the Age of Exploration, which meant non-magical people were closer to having access to power previously only held by magical people. That was the real reason,” Hermione went on, “but the wizards behind the movement to conceal the Wizarding World from the non-magical weren’t about to admit they supported the Statute because they were terrified of non-mags, so they made it about law. They said that non-magical law wasn’t extensive enough to govern wizards, that they needed to have the power to create their own law—so they did.”
Yin’s head tilted in a thoughtful way, their eyes kind, their lips turned down in an expression that seemed almost sad. “Harry. Giving someone a chance doesn’t mean falling in love with them. It doesn’t mean having sex with them.”
“Er, yes,” Harry said, coughing again.  “Quite ill!  And I need the number to call to get a taxi, so I can—can go to the hospital.”
“No,” said Harry. “Death Eaters dropped the wards. Fenrir Greyback. You would know that if you had spoken to any Aurors at all before you called this meeting.”
“Whatever,” Harry said, picking up the bottle of Wood-Eye Lye.  “I just came to get this ID’ed.”  He started heading out of the back room, Alby trailing behind.
“Why is this only about Malfoy?” Penelope asked Savage. “Is it impossible to imagine that there could be
The final Council vote was tonight. Hermione’s bid for appointment as Minister had already failed to reach majority. Fudge’s bid, in a shocking turn of events, had succeeded. All that remained between the people and a Fudge Ministry was Proudfoot, a staunch moderate with very few political opinions other than neither side was right, and Reveal should happen because witches and wizards had called for it, but also maybe it could be stalled forever, that sort of thing. However, if he achieved majority tonight, Proudfoot and Fudge would be in a runoff, with the Wizengamot casting the final vote, and hope would remain. If he failed, Fudge would be the de facto Council appointment for Minister, at least until the general election in a year and a half. It didn’t work like anything Harry could remember about non-mag Parliament, but then again, nothing about the Ministry did.
“Yes,” Draco said again.  Going over to her, Draco took two of the mugs off the tray.  “Thank you,” he said, looking into her eyes meaningfully.
“I don’t know who the supplier is,” Harry said.  “I just know that there are people who may know we know about the Life Water who wouldn’t want us to find it.”
Harry wanted to tell him it didn’t look like a dragon at all, but it looked so pretty up there, and Mister Malfoy vibrated a bit when he talked, like a low hum.
This was stunning enough that Harry quickly cast a Notice-Me-Not and slipped away to catch a breath, his Patronus returning to him once he was closer to the house, along with Ron’s terrier. “We’re all right, Harry.” Ron’s Patronus went on to describe Diagon Alley, where Ron was stationed. “We’re having to move the non-magicals out,” he was saying, “otherwise, they’ll crush themselves trying to see a goblin, or a magic broom. But obviously, no one likes being moved by magic, especially without their permission, and there’s a question of how far to go—do we keep on moving them when they’re crushing each other outside of the Alley? The non-magical police are here—”
The naked surprise on his face was embarrassing.  Malfoy was meant to take it as a joke; they’d been joking before.  Hadn’t they?  “What did you used to want to be when you grew up?” Harry said instead.
Malfoy sighed, putting aside the moss he’d been sorting and finally meeting Harry’s eyes.  “What is it, Potter?  I hope you haven’t poisoned yourself again.”
Harry had seen the Snitch whizz by just under him, and he’d thought if he unhooked his legs he could kick it into arm’s reach, but he’d miscalculated.  His broom was already spiralling and proceeded to spiral out from under him, and Harry was free-falling through the sky.
Surprise filled Malfoy’s face, followed by something almost like the beginnings of an unplanned smile.  As soon as it started, Malfoy angled his face away.  “Well.  Well—I don’t suppose you could possibly understand.  They’re all very complicated, and you’re such a dullard.”
