cling to you” Finnigan nodded like he has seen it many times before and got back to changing into his pyjamas
Pansy squeaked, he could hear the desperation in her voice, as if he wasn’t just as disappointed as her “Never mind, I heard what I said.
“Harry, you are as smooth as sandpaper” Draco snickered, pushing his blond hair behind his ear and continued, trying not to blush “You aren’t subtle at all, you hold my hands all the time, you gave me gloves and said I should use it when you’re not around. One time, you put my hands in your pockets to keep me warm” Draco recalled the memory, it still made him blush every time he thought about it.
, the scent of apple from his lipgloss, the taste of wine from Draco’s tongue, the way their bodies were flushed together, Harry cupped Draco’s face and deepened their kiss. Kissing Draco felt like running under a rain, wet and exciting, kissing Draco felt like walking under the July sun, hot and sweating, kissing Draco felt like sleeping in on weekends, it made him keep wanting to do it. If he could kiss Draco forever, he would, he would do anything to be next to Draco. Harry slid his hands down to Draco’s legs and grazed his fingers over the blond’s inner thighs.
“Potter, you really need to learn how to talk properly” Draco rolled his eyes at him, waiting for an answer to this weird behaviour of his.
“I thought we agreed on calling each other by our first names yesterday” Potter pouted with his hands behind his back. It was dark outside but he could still see Potter’s face clearly. He was wearing his scarf again, a new one because Draco had kept his. He even has a red knitted hat over his head. He looked like a dork, but Draco found him kind of cute, he fought the urge to blush at the sight of him.
“Yeah” Pansy nodded at her wife and held her hand “I know someone, well, you know, after the war, things got hard for us Slytherin, especially Death Eaters?”
good of a kisser. He grabbed both of the Auror’s hands and rested them on his hips, allowing Potter to touch him as he wished, Draco wished Potter would do more anyway. As the Auror’s hands gripped tightly on his waist and started moving up under his short top, Draco hummed into the kiss, wrapping his arms around Potter’s neck when the man deepened the kiss. He could taste the beer from Potter’s kiss and felt the heat spreading everywhere on his body, Draco has come to a realisation,
“Didn’t you get married to Blaise Zabini?” Lucius asked him, his eyes squinting. Right, he totally forgot he got married to a guy who tried to buy him an island on their one year anniversary
Draco watched as Pansy kept following Hermione closely, wanting her attention. Maybe there was resemblances between the two worlds then, Draco smirked and once again, back at his thoughts. What should he do with Harry?
beautiful replica of Hogwarts, Draco” Hermione said and he glared at the girls, they were clearly lying to make him feel better
“Maybe it’s good for you, Ron” Hermione said, he knew she’d agree with that suggestion, she was fed up with teaching Ron anyway
“You know, I never tell lies” Harry winked, he took a deep breath before continued “I have something to tell you”
Draco bit his lower lip and looked around, but fortunately there was no one around. They were at a secluded beach, no one could come, it was on an island Blaise bought for Ron on their five year anniversary just years ago, and they let Harry and Draco celebrate their own anniversary here now, well, with a catch, of course “They’re at the Manor, you know!
“Er, I was just back at home from my shift, and I heard the smoke detector, it’s kind of my instinct to barge in”
“Of course” Draco played with the rim of his glass and breathed out a heavy sigh. Of course he remembered, that was the night he
“You see them?” He pointed at Hermione and Pansy, who were watching people behind the bar “That’s my friends, apparently I don’t go out enough so they’re making me suffer” He said, just when the door was opened to reveal someone he didn’t want to see, he choked on his own words, staring at Harry, who was walking in the pub like he was in a rush. This couldn’t be…He turned around and glared at Pansy, but she was sashaying to his table already
“Yeah, totally, like what the fuck, Harry, how could he do that?” Pansy frowned and huffed out a breath “Weird”
“Thank you, Pansy” Draco smiled tenderly at her, she was his best friend and no one could change it, she always know what to say, and she always know what Draco thinks, and Draco knew she was right. He looked up and saw Potter glancing at him before looking back and continued talking to Hermione, he pulled Pansy in a hug and buried his face in the crook of her wet neck “Thank you for always being there for me”
“Shush” Draco nudged her and looked back at the stage, he heard Potter’s soft snore and silently hoped he didn’t hear any of that
She said and all the Aurors rushed out in barely a minute, grabbing their robes and wands and just left
“You’re still Draco, right?” Potter said, waiting for Draco to slowly nod “I want to give you this, because you’re still Draco, and I love you”
“You are so wild, Theo” Draco commented, his hand fidgeting with the belt on Harry’s trousers “What if you got caught?”
“Yeah...something like that” Draco smiled and buried his face in the crook of Harry’s neck as they embraced each other. He believed he’d have his happy ending now, because he’s with Harry, and Harry was happy ending.
” Harry mumbled when his phone rang again, this time it was Pansy, Harry wondered what went wrong, he picked up the phone and answered it immediately “Pansy? What’s up?”
“We’re boyfriends, Harry, of course I like you, but I’m not obsessed” He said, snatching the articles from Harry’s hands as his boyfriend dug in for more. It was more like a hobby for him as a kid and he refused to think otherwise “And you’re no different, you used to stare at my dot on the Marauder’s Map for hours and even before you go to sleep” Draco smirked as Harry stared at him with wide eyes “Oh yeah, Ron talks a lot when I give him sweets”
“Looks like your soulmate is tired today” Lovegood said, looking at Draco and he turned around to see Potter snoring from behind, his arms still locked around his waist “Maybe you should take him up to his dorm, it’s a long way to your dorm anyway”
“Let’s go, alright?” Draco told her, intertwining his hand with Harry’s and kissing Lily’s hair. They’ve had her three years ago, she was the light of their life and Draco could never forget the first time they held her in their arms, it was one of the most special moments in his life.
. That was when it started, they sometimes do it for fun, not always, once every few months if they were in a mood, it was a guilty thing to do, Harry knew it, but he felt different when he did it with Draco, perhaps because they were good friends, or perhaps it was something else he’d never admit to Draco himself.
“Well, your dad’s hands are always cold” Harry crouched down to mumble to their six years old son, who was giggling at him “And my hands can warm him up. And in the summer, your dad’s hands can cool me down”
“Sorry, I had to say that so they can continue their date, they have been working all week, I don’t want to ruin their time together” Draco explained, he didn’t want to bother them, but he wasn’t sure he could stay alone in his house right now either. He still felt that scary, unsafe feeling in his chest, afraid that someone was behind him, he couldn’t forget it.
“Did you apologise to Luna?” She asked, narrowing her eyes at him, she didn’t believe him, she’d probably think he was scheming something “Are you scheming something?” Draco smiled in his head, pressing his lips into a thin line and nodded
“That’s why?” Draco asked and Pansy nodded, sighing deeply, he didn’t know Goldstein has a crush on him, he also didn’t know Potter could get jealous. He has definitely never seen this side of him before, at least not in his world “I thought he just really suck at Potions”
“You’ll be fine, and no one comes early to a party, it’s common sense” Pansy hooked her arm around his and smiled “Your look is on point, do not worry” Draco nodded and hoped he looked good enough, he was wearing a black mesh button up shirt tucked in his black trousers with a pair of black shoes, the shirt was partly see-through so it was both revealing and discreet in a way, Pansy had even curled his hair so it looked a bit wavy. And
” He cupped the face of the raven haired man above him and urged him “If you don’t do it now, I will find anoth-
“I know, Pansy” Hermione pulled her in a hug and kissed her forehead, letting Pansy’s buried in her neck “We can sit closer so Draco can sit down”
“Early” Hermione answered “We’ll go hiking, then kayaking, then swimming under the waterfall, then after all of that, couple massages, and then…”
“Let her” Harry chuckled, he has no intention of leaving this office until his birthday was over, that was why he decided to do paperwork tonight “She can do whatever she wants”
want you to do me right now” He smiled, taking off his shirt in under a second “What if someone caught us?”
“I like this better” Harry looked down at him and smiled, showing his teeth, the blond bit his lips and nodded
” He nodded and looked back at the board, clearing his throat and trying to forget what had just happened “Robards said he assigned this case for Auror Potter and Auror Weasley to solve, your files are in front of you, meeting dismissed” He put the pictures on the white board back in his files and watched as the Aurors left the room, he glanced at a certain someone and spoke up when he intended to flee
” He murmured, but the rest of his sentence was swallowed by Neville, the Auror pushed in slowly, and Theo arched his back, pushing back as well “
” Draco begged, breath hitching when he felt Harry angling his cock at his entrance, his fingers balled into fists and his toes curled when Harry began pushing in. The Auror wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist, holding him flushed and didn’t let go, he kissed the blond’s shoulders and Draco exhaled the breath he didn’t know he was holding when Harry finally pushed it all in.
” He said, turning to the guy, he swallowed hard when he noticed Brandon’s arm wrapped possessively around Draco’s slim waist “
“Bertie Bott’s beans?” Ron leaned over and extended his hand, Theo looked at the bunch of beans in Ron’s palm and smiled “Don’t worry, I made Blaise eat all the gross flavours, it’s all good here”
“He could have just come here instead of sending a waitress, I don’t come to them, they come to me” Draco pushed the drink that man bought to the end of the table and sipped on his own cocktail “I hate lazy men”
“Well, I don’t remember anything at all” Potter replied with a smile on his face “Sorry I threw up on your boots back then”
“I was thinking, we could go back to our dorm, and have a taste of the chocolates” Harry leaned closer and whispered in Draco’s ear “And maybe I can have a taste of you too”
“Oh, and maybe do something with the bags under their eyes, they have a lot” Pansy mumbled “And also remember to put lotion on them”
Hermione tapped in code on Pansy’s back again as both of them watched Harry’s thoughts run around in his messy head of his. His eyebrows furrowed just so slightly, his lips pressed into a thin line and his hand was grabbing on the beer bottle a little too tight, he must have imagining Draco kissing Cormac right now, just according to plan.
“Quit that” Ron said softly, pointing at the ashtray and Draco noticed Blaise hesitated for a second before putting the cigarette out, the one he just started smoking, the blond smirked to himself, Ron has
“Turn around, I, er, I want to try something” Theo furrowed his eyebrows but turned around anyway, showing his arse at Neville’s face
“Oh, I was just helping Ginny with her date with Luna today” Pansy shrugged, opening the book she brought with her “She needed
“Oh, Terrence” Draco said, Terrence Higgs was a fellow Slytherin student, but he had graduated years ago already. That day he was only visiting Hogwarts to have a talk with one of the Professors. Draco didn’t know about it clearly and Pansy was the one to tell him about it, but Terrence was the one to see Ernie in pain and brought him into the hospital wing, leaving shortly after “Why do you ask?”
“He isn’t that bad, Theodore” Draco murmured, as if he wasn’t trying to make Theo find Neville to say thank you “He’s actually a pretty decent lad, for a Gryffindor. You should find him, to say thank you”
“No” He turned Harry down and sat down, putting his brushes back in the box “Just go and change your outfit” After hearing a sigh from Harry, Draco eventually looked up when he left, glancing at Theo’s spot, his friend was putting on…
you had a crush on him, or have, I think you still like him” Pansy pointed out, crossing her leg over the other “If not, why do you always ask me why Harry keeps asking for another Healer when he’s injured and not you? Why do you keep worrying every time he got injured? Why do you always dress up for an event that coincidentally, Harry’s also there?”
“Be you” She leaned in and kissed his forehead, like how his mother used to as well “Want to go in? I’ll let you sit between Pansy and I”
“Draco, come here, I have something to give you” She led him to the big couch in the living room and gestured him to sit down. He clutched at his sleeves when he settled next to her, she was the one he wanted to impress most and definitely didn’t want her to call him here and tell him that she disliked him.
“Who says I don’t want to?” Harry grinned, his cock was already hard again, grinding against Draco’s half hard length. Draco couldn’t help but showed a smirk and he was soon attacked by Harry again with a kiss. Draco was supposed to be there for the meeting too. If it was three years ago, Kingsley would have a blast shouting at him, but now, he didn’t really care anymore, after all, he did get married to the Head Auror, who’d protect him with his life, who has been loving him for years now and who he loved most, yeah, he’s married to Harry Potter and he bloody loved it.
“Some charity event, I’m not really sure anymore” Ron shrugged, flopping down on the spot next to Harry and opening Harry’s computer that he had borrowed a few days ago “I just think of it as one more spot I get to do it with my husband”
“Hey…er, why is Potter looking at me?” Draco whispered, quiet enough for Harry not to hear it. Ron was surprised to hear his question as well, he leaned over and whispered
“Ready?” Harry asked, earning a nod from Draco. He Apparated them both back to the Grimmauld Place, right in the middle of his bedroom
“He said he wasn’t sure how it happened, or when” Hermione began “Remember when you two were assigned that case and it went on for six months? It’s just a year from now”
Draco walked in the crowded pub alone, Pansy had come earlier and picked out his outfit for him. She insisted on making him wear a black crop top with a pair of black trousers, a long black jacket, just to be sure it wasn’t too cold for him and he could take it off if it gets warm in the pub, and black boots. Pansy even put a little bit of lipstick on him, to make his lips
She turned back to Draco and sighed “Fine, it is. It was Muggle movie night, Hermione got me into it ever since we started dating all those years ago. And I thought of speed dating, so Hermione, being the brilliant, awesome, perfect person she is, thought of this whole thing”
“It’s fine, I think I had a bad hot dog today” Ginny shrugged it off and continued smiling at them “Not that bad, really”
, Hermione and Pansy’s 5 years old daughter, she has black hair like Pansy but it’s long and curly like Hermione’s.
Draco tilted his head to the side, avoiding Harry when the Auror leaned over for a kiss “I asked you to join me in the shower, not sex” He smirked but pressed a soft kiss to Harry’s cheek when he pouted “Now are you going to soap me up or should I do it myself?”
” Draco breathed out, turning around and bit his lower lips, draping his arms around Harry’s neck as the man pulled him flushed again, he pushed Harry’s head down for a kiss, smiling into it. He couldn’t help it, he was just…happy. For the first time in his life, he was truly happy, like he had found…the right one, he didn’t want to believe it, but his feelings never deceive him, and for once, his mind was agreeing with his heart, that he was all in for this man. And not just because the sex was brilliant, hell no, it was because of everything else, the sex was just a bonus, it was the way Harry cared for him in the smallest things, the words Harry said, the actions Harry did, it made Draco felt special, like he was loved, and he had wanted that since he was a kid. Harry was probably the only one to know Draco so well besides his friends and family, he knew how to get under Draco’s skin, and…they couldn’t seem to be apart from each other, no matter how much they tried to avoid one another, it seemed like…destiny wanted them to be together, and as corny as it sounded, Draco believed it.
insisted” Draco pointed at Pansy, who was talking to Hermione and Astoria chuckled, her gentle smile, her bright eyes, it reminded him of the time she confessed her feelings for him in Eighth Year, it was the last time he ever saw her “Why are you here?”
“You’re really good at this” He said, and Draco knew exactly what he meant, he was trying to seduce Harry again, and here he thought that Draco might need a break, instead the blond just invite him for round two.
“Thank you” He said, shuddering a bit when Harry applied the soap on his back, from the nape of his neck down to the small of his back. He felt Harry’s hands from his feet up to his thighs and stopped there again. Draco turned around and looked up at Harry, who was standing again.
Pansy and Harry’s words came rushing back in his mind, making him wonder again “If I could prove that this world is just like that world, then maybe it’ll work” He mumbled to himself, looking at his own handwriting ‘
” She said “Neville and Theo’s wedding? We have to be there for the cake tasting. Luna and Ginny are already there, waiting for you two to spill everything. Ron and Blaise are also there, they even got there earlier than the real grooms, Ron got hungry” Pansy grabbed Draco’s chin when he came down and inspected his face “Pink cheeks, red lips, messy hair, marks on your chest and especially that glow around you, you
“Okay but what about me?” Ginny chugged on her beer and pouted, she wore a couple shirt with Luna today, she always wear it if there’s a celebration and they were going to get drunk, Ginny’s shirt said
“No” Ron said, glaring at Draco “But Hermione told me to be decent, and Zabini told me I couldn’t win against you”
“Yeah, I will give it back to you later” He looked away, avoiding the Potter’s eyes and clutching at his robes “I forgot about it, sorry”
“No! No” He looked at them and sighed “I just, I just need to be alone right now, or maybe get a good shag, I’ll decide on the way home”
” Harry’s voice broke a bit, he cleared his throat and sat straight up “Er, how-how, how did it happen?”
“Not really” He said, sighing deeply and turning on his heels to talk to Ron “Why are you here? Another rematch?”
Ron squinted his eyes to read the words in Harry’s ring and looked at the words inside Draco’s ring in his hand “
Another week passed by and Harry was still sulking at home, all he did was working and sleeping, as usual, he didn’t have the motivation to do anything, he felt like there was something missing. After the uncomfortable situation on the opening night of Ron and Blaise’s restaurant, Harry had headed outside and stood there, leaning on the wall of the place, he felt suffocated just being in there at that time. Maybe he stood there for ten minutes, maybe half an hour, he didn’t check the time, he went straight home after that. Harry looked up when he heard his phone ringing, it was Draco. The Auror sighed harshly, he wasn’t ready to face Draco yet, he was such a coward. He waited until the call ended and continued watching the television, though he wasn’t sure if he was
oh no!” He denied, maybe he should just confess “I just…I was just…burning things. How-how did you know there was a fire?”
“Hey, Pansy! Why don’t you join some of the girls at the Hufflepuff Common Room? They’re having a secret party, just girls” Seamus asked but Pansy shook her head slowly
“Well, it caught my eyes” Pansy pursed her lips and rolled her eyes again, avoiding Hermione’s gaze “Oh no, she caught me, she’s gonna want to talk about book organising again”
Draco smirked, smearing his thumb over the head of Harry’s cock while his other hand tilted his chin up “
did you get bigger when I left or am I wrong?” The blond smiled at him before lowering himself down and pulling Harry’s cock out, which was glistening with precome. The Auror propped himself up on his elbows and watched as Draco stroke his length and teased him by licking at the head, his eyes never left Harry’s “I’m really concern whether I could take this or not”
” Hermione said while laughing loudly, Pansy was drunk, and she won’t stop making toasts, Hermione brushed herself against Pansy’s arm, she was wearing a backless navy blue cocktail dress, Draco was certain Pansy picked that out for her wife, she even has a small tiara on her hair, she has recently had her hair cut, so it was just as short as Pansy’s, but wavy as always.
“Oh, here, I can apply it on myself” Ron grabbed it before Draco could and just started rubbing it on his chest, as if Draco didn’t notice how Blaise stopped taking pictures of Smith and glanced at Ron instead, he smirked to himself, Blaise was obviously and truly head over heels for Ron, it was not subtle at all.
” Draco rolled his eyes and flopped down on the chair in front of her. He should have known Pansy would be the one to plant this idea in Potter’s head, the Auror would never do this kind of stuff “Who’s gonna be there?”
” He moaned and let his head fell, his eyes rolled to the back of his head when Potter started sucking him while scissoring Draco at the same time, he gripped on the fur of the carpet and breathed out when Potter stopped, the Auror planted featherlight kisses on his inner thighs, and moved closer, until- “
“Come on, you’re tired” Harry smiled at him and Draco hesitated for a second before climbing on Harry’s back, he was just so exhausted already, he couldn’t walk anymore
“Oh my god” Pansy gasped with her hands on her chest, Hermione showed her the two silver charm bracelets on her palm with a bright grin
He sobbed, head falling down to rest at a step of the stairs, Harry was still behind him, thrusting passionately while Draco became an indecent mess. He always had his composure, but when it came to being fucked by Harry, Draco just lost it all “
Draco turned around to see Weasley screaming, pointing his finger at the cauldron, with Potter standing next to him, staring at Draco from afar.
. And everyone was there, guys, girls, handing out chocolates to their crushes, Draco didn’t want to admit it, but he kind of made a box too, for someone he liked, for a while now, but it was after dinner now, and he still hasn’t done it.
being an unreasonable prick” Hermione rolled her eyes at her wife and turned to Draco “And Draco, why did you say yes?”
“I’m alright” Draco murmured between their kiss, and the deeper Harry was in, the harder it was for him to hold everything back and not come right there and then. Draco was impossibly tight and the way he wrapped himself around Harry, his entrance around Harry’s cock, his arms locked around Harry’s neck and his long legs enveloped Harry’s waist, Draco was a beautiful writhing mess under him.
“It looks cute on me” Draco said, showing off his wrist. Just a few days ago Luna had given him a nice bracelet with flowers on them, it was small and cute. Draco didn’t think he’d ever put it on, but when he tried it on his left arm, the bracelet was something of the opposite to his Dark Mark, like a ray of sunshine in a dark sky. He felt more comfortable looking at his arm now, which was why he decided to keep wearing it, even when it didn’t match his clothes at all
“Are you sure you want to stay?” Potter asked him one more time “We hiked all the way here for this”
to see Harry, but he ignored it. He will just have to avoid Harry for the rest of his life if he has to, he was too embarrassed, he would bury his feelings and live on like he always did.
“I’m so glad” He sniffled softly, and just as she pulled him in for a hug, Draco was surprised, she was a warm person. He didn’t even think she’d forgive him, and when she did, he couldn’t help but becoming speechless “I’m sorry”
“Okay, I’m sorry, I lost it, alright?” Pansy rubbed her face on his shoulder and smacked his arm “But to be fair, there was nothing much, just a bunch of articles about Potter”
“Has never shown affection towards anyone, I know” Draco said, looking at Blaise, who was still keeping his eyes on Ron. It was weird, he has never seen that kind of look on Blaise before, kind of like…he was craving for it, he wanted Ron bad. And once Blaise got his eyes on something or someone, he’d become determined “He’s just thinking”
“Y-yeah, yes” Draco replied and mentally slapped himself. He has never stutter at any guy before, and now this guy came, and he just
Draco mumbled, there was no need to think about this one, he already knew the answer. Draco moaned when Potter pushed him inside the house and pressed him on the wall, closing the door wandlessly as he kept ravishing Draco.
Pansy whispered and poured more wine into her glass, pretending like she didn’t say anything seconds ago. Harry cleared his throat, it was time.
” She shrieked and opened the door for them to walk inside, the room was huge and…blank, there was only two tables inside, and a few chairs, and all the walls were white “Come here!”
, and I’m saying this because I mean it, if you don’t fuck me right now, I will kick you off the bed, I didn’t save my virginity for 27 years for nothing”
“Trust me, I don’t even remember what I just said” Harry confessed, his hands helping Draco unbuttoned his shirt “I just…really want to kiss you more”
“Sorry, Professor” They both said but Professor Slughorn only nodded at them. He could never stop favouring Harry, couldn’t he?
He said loudly, it was comfortable now calling her by her first name, he didn’t know he’d feel this good about this…about being nice. Draco dusted his robes and walked back to his dorm. Luna was the first person, he still got more to apologise for, but he reckoned they’d come looking for him soon.
“You’re crazy” She said, chugging on her drink and stomping away, probably to Millicent and Daphne’s spot to tell them. Maybe they could guide her better than Draco.
“No, I’m fine” Potter said, and Draco gave up, he was a stubborn git, he could not convince him. So he did the only thing he thought of, Draco moved his hand and wiped the sweats off Potter’s forehead and neck with the back of his hand
Hermione yelled to drown the noise and for Harry to hear her, the Auror turned around with a beer bottle in his hand and smiled gently at them coming to his spot “What time is it?”
“Really? I could just borrow your phone to call my friend and pick me up” Draco said “Two of them are on a date, but I could call a few others”
I won’t tell anyone” Ron dragged Harry out of the lift and they kept walking. Harry was torn, he wanted to say it, but he just couldn’t “Not even Blaise, though I’ve vowed to never keep anything from him on our wedding,
“Alright, alright” Blaise chuckled, kissing Ron for real this time, the redhead opened his mouth when Blaise grind his hard on against Ron’s, giving him access to slid his tongue in, Ron could collapse from the excitement, he put his hands on Blaise’s neck, he didn’t intend to let the kiss go any second now, not yet. Ron’s hands moved on his own and started pulling Blaise’s belt off, unzipping his trousers while Blaise pushed off his trousers as well. He put Blaise’s hands on his arse, he had learned some wandless tricks from Pansy a few years ago when she said it’d be useful for him, it’s useful indeed.
“Well, I suppose I was surprised, I knew it was coming, but still surprised” Draco replied “To see how happy Pansy really looked for the first time ever. Before the war, she was always influenced by her parents, telling her what to do, she almost had to marry Theo, they’re all Purebloods after all, but after the war, she was free to do whatever she wanted. She was better since then, but something was missing, I guess Hermione was what’s missing”
“As you wish” Potter said and walked to the bar, and Draco might have sneaked a look at Potter’s back when he walked away
“I got a plan” Hermione gave her a smile and a kiss to her forehead before getting off the bed with Pansy quickly following her. She absolutely loved it when her wife was in on mischievous stuff like this with her, it only made her love Hermione even more, if it was possible for Pansy to do that “
He even repeated what he said again, so it was true, Draco actually believed that, he wondered why, maybe he was secretly a romantic at heart.
“Alright Aurors! You can leave now” Pansy waved her wand and the door opened under her magic. Most of the Aurors have already left, there was only Roger, who was pressing Theo back against his table, his face burying in the crook of Theo’s neck, so men were
“Yes, actually, I have seen their auras since they came in, it’s glowing” Luna said softly “Glowing means they had sex”
“What?” Potter looked down and looked back at Draco “I think it looks fine. Why did you wear formal robes anyway?”
was” Hermione said, eyeing Harry, everyone knew Harry has a thing for Draco, so when Draco told them this
“You’re just fucking beautiful” Harry said, pushing the second finger in, opening him up as Draco moaned out loud, his hands gripping on the table. His cock twitched with every stimulation Harry was making, with his lips once again on Draco’s stomach and his rough fingers scissoring the blond open.
“Miss Parkinson” Robards stood up and cleared his throat “You can’t just barge in an Aurors’ meeting like this”
“I know” Harry said and started walking, Draco leaned his chin on Harry’s broad shoulder, looking at the starry night and empty street while getting a piggyback from his boyfriend. Now that he has Harry right with him, he didn’t have to worry for another second, he was safe, right here in Harry’s arms.
“Do you regret leaving twelve years ago?” He asked, trying to stop himself from acting like an Auror at this moment and interrogating Draco right now
“I didn’t mean Harry” Pansy smacked his arm and started pulling him with her. In front of them was Granger walking with Weasley and Potter, the three of them talking again “I meant Anthony, that guy has been tailing you since Third Year, when you hit puberty, but you and Harry were always so close. Everyone just assume you two were a couple even before Hogwarts, weird, I know. But then Harry confessed to you, everyone was surprised, since then Anthony stopped. And now, suddenly you’re acting distant again, he’s wiggling his way back, that’s why Harry burnt his cauldron”
“I don’t care” Harry said as Draco glanced around, some were looking at them, and he could even see his friends standing at the end of the hallway “I just want to kiss you and make you mine”
“You will be fine” Draco chuckled at all the scenarios Harry created, it could all be true actually, but a part of him kept saying it would be alright, that he shouldn’t worry much
“This is our matching couple shirt” Draco sniffled softly while looking at the large bucket he found in his apartment, which Hermione had confirmed that it wouldn’t melt from the fire “The arsehole didn’t even wear it more than twice”
” He whimpered, clenching his hands on the table when Harry pushed his finger in, he arched up but Harry’s finger followed him, pushing up as well. Draco looked at the crowd, no one even noticed them, they were all caught up in their own business that they didn’t recognise the two people sitting in the corner of the pub about to have sex.
“Coffee?” Draco said, immediately grabbing Harry’s mug and drinking it himself. It had started three years ago, exactly on the last day of August, Harry remembered because he was panicking on what to buy Hermione for her 21
saw, I’m sure it won’t be out for a long time” Ron grabbed the potatoes chips from the table and started eating “Maybe never”
” Luna squealed, running up to them as they approached the entrance of the restaurant, she came for Harry first, pulling him in a tight hug, she was always the one to give the best hugs “You came. Are you feeling better?” She said, cupping his face and fixing his jacket
“Yes, mother, just a second, I’ll be right back” He gave them a curt nod before running out of the door to his Manor. His pace quickened the closer he got to the gate “
” Pansy chuckled quietly, stepping back and pulling her daughter with her “Maybe you should go find James, I think I saw him in the kitchen” She said and the little girl squealed before running out of the room. Pansy turned to look at them and shook her head with her hands on her hips “
. Draco read the dates and words on it carefully, his body quivering but not from the cold, it was from the surprise he has received from Harry.
“I don’t say I love you to a lot of people, you know” Draco mumbled to him and frowned a bit when Harry pulled out to lie down next to him, he draped Draco’s leg over his waist and pulled Draco close for a hug “Just my parents, Pansy, and you. So you better keep that promise, Harry Potter”
“No, never” Draco hummed, trying to remember all the years Blaise’s been his friend “Well he still gives us birthday gifts, if that’s what you mean. But like just randomly, then no”
“Well, it still felt like it was yesterday” He whispered to her, his voice almost sounded like it was broken already. It had happened three months ago, the day he and Harry broke up “Pansy,
here” Harry rolled his eyes, his hand digging into the bowl of popcorn on his lap as he continued watching his movie while Pansy and Hermione bickered behind the couch as if he wasn’t here and couldn’t hear them “You can stop fighting because of me”
I’m okay now” Harry said and slowly opened his eyes, his left eye was now returning to its original colour, without the red infection. Draco breathed out in relief and put a hand on his chest
Draco exclaimed with anger, he has never been this angry before “Stop with the fucking stuttering. Make up your bloody mind!”
Finnigan laughed and pulled Thomas up the boys’ dormitory. For Draco, he didn’t want to look up, Potter was still standing at the door like an idiot
“Isn’t this party for graduates only?” He looked at her, she looked tipsy, he had only just arrived for five minutes, later than everyone else, since he had some thinking to do.
Draco looked in his green emerald eyes, and tightening his grips without thinking “Yes” He said, earning a smile from Harry. Draco could hear his inner voice in his mind.
“Daddy, what are you two still doing here? I wanna swim! And build castles!” She said, pouting and pointing at the beach, jumping up so Harry could carry their three years old daughter up in his arms
“It’s…” Theo took a deep breath and stopped fidgeting with the clothes, he replied without turning back, but he could feel Neville behind him “It’s none of your business” He grunted each word out “Please, just, please go somewhere else, I can’t see you right now”
Dean approached her from behind, tapping her shoulder and breathing heavily, seemed like he just ran here “So I talked to Leanne, since you asked me to ask her about her dad’s broom shop, but she said his shop is also out of Nimbus 3000”
complaining at the same time, Ron” Pansy rubbed her temples and chuckled “It was exhausting, I can’t even express—er, did someone just knock?”
“Of course I did great, what do you think?” He let her leaned her weight on him as they walked through the crowded hall “How about you? Did Millicent help?”
go back to your room, and prepare for tomorrow, it’s our last day here, make the most out of it, alright? Be calm” Pansy suggested “Now would you leave? After Hermione said all those things, I’m kinda hot for her all over again”
“You started it” He said, touching Harry’s cock from outside of his boxers, he was already half hard from all the kissing. Draco rubbed the bulge with more strength, leaning closer to put his mouth on it, licking Harry’s length through his boxers. Harry has his eyes on Draco, his hand at the blonde’s neck, the blond slowly pulled the boxers down, revealing the now hard cock in front of him, leaking precum. Draco grabbed the bottle of Firewhisky on the table nearby them and poured it all over Harry’s cock
“So, it’s like what? Seven minutes until midnight?” Pansy looked around the room to search for the clock but turned back to look at Draco “You know what happens at midnight right?”
’, so he had asked Pansy to find out who he was, since she knew everyone in school, and surprisingly…it could actually be Harry
She smirked, walking out of the Great Hall with Hermione and everyone else. She waved her hand and the door closed, leaving Draco and Harry there.
” Theo turned to look when Neville called, he had pushed Abbott away, but it didn’t mean anything, they still kissed, he probably didn’t want him to tell their friends. So Theo walked in the lift, ignoring the call
Draco opened his eyes slowly to see complete darkness in front of him. Has he gone blind? He couldn’t see anything, his hands were tied together, and he was in a moving car
“You know, you’ve gotten all weird since you disappeared that day” She squinted her eyes at him but he only chuckled back, opening the book
“It’s not like you and Blaise don’t do that” Pansy pursed her lips and pulled out a lipstick from her bag “Seems to me, you and Blaise get it on real
“Oh yeah, but only a few times” He shrugged and looked around the huge house. He didn’t remember much, the furniture had changed, but the familiarity he had of the house was still there “Anyway, where were we?” He smirked, keeping his grip tightly when Harry carried him up the stairs. Draco stripped off his crop top and let it fall on the floor, shaking off his boots on the way as well, watching Harry gaped at him, his eyes glued on the blond’s chest “What?”
“Do you feel dizzy?” He asked, touching on the place with no blood on his forehead, observing if Potter has any reaction to it “Headache, blurry vision, trouble walking, nausea?”
“I’m going to go” Ron stood up and walked out of their booth, he just couldn’t take it anymore, he’d move out, he could crash at Harry’s place, and find a new place tomorrow. Ron marched into the restroom and turned on the tap, he bent down, washing his face, he needed to sober up, even when he wasn’t drunk
news! I better tell everyone! Oh Pansy is gonna be so happy! You cannot believe how many times he mentions you, Draco!
His last year here was a new year for him, he wanted to change, and he started being civil to everyone. Not Potter particularly, he just avoided any encounter he might have with Potter or his friends, he couldn’t come up with anything nice to say, let alone an apology. He wanted to, but it was an impossible thing for him to do.
” Ginny greeted them in her light blue sweater, her arms opened wide as she took the gifts from Draco’s arms, she tipped her head over and mumbled “Did you get it?”
“It’s a big deal” Blaise finally said something, and wrapped his arm around Ron’s waist, pulling him close while Ron blushed harder
“Juice is fine, tea makes it hard for me to sleep” Draco answered, watching Harry walking around half naked in grey sweatpants, the blond was definitely struck my this man’s body.
“That’s it for today” Pansy said when Roger finished his shooting, she tugged on Blaise’s jacket and mumbled “Do you think it’s good?”
“Alright, who wants to go first?” Luna shook her hat and Seamus quickly raised his arm along with Padma “One should act and the other will guess” Seamus and Padma started whispering in each other’s ear and Seamus finally put his hand in the box to pick up a piece of parchment “I’ll act, she’ll guess”
didn’t expect it from you, Mister Malfoy” Then she lowered her voice that Draco could barely hear it “But you have the Black’s blood in you, so I don’t expect much” She sighed and looked back at them “I don’t want the same thing from 20 years ago to happen
“Nothing” He heard Draco spoke and let out a soft sigh, they didn’t get caught. Ron pulled himself away from Blaise’s cock and turned around
“Theo’s gonna leave for France? Why didn’t he tell me this?” He did know that Theodore has a huge passion for fashion, but he didn’t he’d leave. What about Neville?
“It’s in her hand” Draco said, it was one thing he noticed when he came to hug her, she was holding both of their wands then. Draco hummed and opened the door to his room, he walked to his bed but Harry was still standing at the door, looking around the room “What’s wrong?”
“And don’t get me started on you” Theo’s lips curled in contempt “You and the whole thing with Ron. We know you’re hiding your gun to show you’re faithful to Ron”
Harry followed him out to the street and Draco finally stopped when Harry called him. He was out of breath, running was never something he was good at “Draco”
“I should have known, you slept on the left side in our suite too” Harry snickered “Alright, roll over me” He said and Draco smiled at him before getting on the other side of the bed
” Draco yelled and quickly put his short black silk night robes on, he barely has his boxer on after his shower, Pansy said she’d be here with clothes so he didn’t put on any proper shirt, he obviously didn’t really expect to see Potter standing in front of his door while he’s in his robes, and the robes barely covered his thighs “
didn’t show me anything, you-…I had to sleep with others to get over you, it didn’t work, I couldn’t get over you at all” His voice broke and he let his bag fall on the ground “And you-you kissed Abbott, and you didn’t care about me, I thought you are nice with me, but you are nice with everyone. How-how am I supposed to know how you feel about me?”
“We had to bring him” Luna said after putting all the bags behind the bar “He wouldn’t stay at the Burrow with Molly and Arthur because little Hugh wasn’t there”
“Ah, is it about Blaise?” Draco asked, and based on the flushed look on Ron’s face, he was right “What do you want to ask about?”
” Draco whispered in Harry’s ear and cried out when his husband started thrusting. At the beginning of their relationship, it took Draco months before he could get used to Harry’s size without wincing, now he felt like he was empty without Harry. The blond’s head fell forward and he rested his forehead on his hands, Harry sped up and the only sounds he could hear was the sound of skin slapping on skin and their breathing. The firefighter bent over and kissed the nape of Draco’s neck, his hand wandered down to stroke the blond again “
“Oh yeah” Harry hummed “Who could she be talking about?” He said, but quickly turned back to grin at Draco “Do you want to go on a date with me this weekend?”
be that you just felt his normal cock, and because you’re putting your feet on his crotch, it’s understandable that you feel it”
“Warming you up” was all Harry could murmur in his ear, a low grumble emerged from his husband’s throat when he nipped on Draco’s neck. He doubted Harry was warming him up based on the bulge under Draco right now.
“Fine” Draco breathed out, looking at Potter again and meeting his eyes. There was that warm tingling feeling again, he cursed himself for feeling like this “What were you preparing?”
“Why are you smiling?” Harry asked, pulling Draco out of his thoughts. The blond sighed happily, intertwining their hands together and met his eyes
birthday, they have gone out on a date the next day, and the day after that and decided to move in together at the Grimmauld Place after five months being in a relationship. Four months later, Harry had decided to propose to Draco in the middle of their big fight, which stunned Draco for a few seconds before he burst into tears with a loud
” He exclaimed and grabbed his Portkey “See you tomorrow” He said and soon, he was back at his own apartment, the apartment he got above Luna’s bookshop, he also sometimes took care of books with her, that was why he grew to be so close with Ginny too, since she came by a lot and slept on his couch when she was tired from Quidditch training.
“I just really want to kiss you right now” Harry said, and Draco grinned before lunging at Harry. It felt like their friends exploded, there were squealing, shrieking and applaud, he was sure Pansy was the one screaming the loudest. As their lips touched, Draco remembered how shocked he felt that night, but this time, he didn’t taste the Firewhisky off Harry’s lips, they were both sober this time. Draco smiled into the kiss and was startled when Harry slipped his tongue in, there was no tongue last time. He hummed happily, he was on the top of the world right now, it felt like he was floating in the air, being embraced by Harry.
“Shut up” Draco said “I didn’t do it because it was already humiliating for me, to think you’d ever like me back”
“I told you he wouldn’t be able to bear it” Hermione mumbled, sitting down on the couch and handed the tea mug in Harry’s hands “Harry?”
“I think the box under your bed would like to disagree” His mother gave him a smile that somewhat looked almost like a smirk “Lastly, we are surprised you want to move in with Harry. But if it’s what makes you happy, you should do it”
“Stand in front of it and tell me what you see” He whispered from behind Draco, the blond stepped up and saw a shadow in the mirror. There was a second shadow now, quickly enough there was Harry there, and Draco was there too, but he was crying as Harry threw a piece of parchment on the ground, stomping on it and leaving Draco crying on his knees. It was heartbreaking, and from what he saw, it seemed like he confessed to Harry, but he aggressively declined it, which broke his heart.
! Alright? I will be your Valentine, you git” He blushed and grabbed the box from Potter’s hand, hugging it tightly to his chest
Harry said, this was it for him, there was no way he could back out of this, Draco knew him like the back of his hand “Ron downloaded the the videos, because, er, he said it’d help me get rid of some pent up sexual urges”
carrying Draco for a while now, he was actually worried about the git. It was sunny and hot, it was May, Draco would have passed out on the filthy mud long ago if he was still walking by himself, he didn’t know how Potter do this
“Yeah, he actually traded Seamus so he could have June, I don’t know why though” Dean replied and looked at himself in the mirror “He originally got July, but he just switched it a few minutes ago and
“As a matter of fact, yes, I do, I have to go see Headmistress McGonagall to discuss with her about a few things” She flipped her hair gracefully and closed her robes so she looked more decent for the meeting “I still can’t believe she chose me to talk to the others Houses about unity, like I care about that”
Draco started to freaked out when he realised what situation he was in, he let out a loud scream, kicking Potter immediately off the bed and got off on the other side
“A pet name” She clarified “When they open their eyes, they’ll find their partner with the same name. And then the game starts, one person will perform an activity or mimic a person, and the other has to guest in one minute. The couple with the highest point will win. And I will be the judge”
Draco said with a smug grin on his face, leaving her alone so Hermione could talk to her “Hey, you both came” He said to Ginny and Luna, who were standing near a snack table “Please, have fun”
“Wait and see” Pansy grinned at him, she stepped back and waved her hand, opening the big double door to the kitchen with a spell “It’s Rose’s idea”
“I love it” Hermione smiled to Pansy and touched her necklace as they walked along the beach under the moonlight with Draco and Potter behind them, Potter was giving him the silent treatment, Draco knew it, and he wasn’t going to lose this game, he would play along, just like Potter wanted him to
“Tutoring Weasley, what do you think?” He walked past Draco and settled down on a table “Do you know where he is?”
” Draco gasped when his phone died, the screen went black and he clutched it tightly, Draco was scared. For the first time in life, he was scared, his hands were shaking uncontrollably.
“Spill whatever’s on your mind” Draco said, and began eating his grilled salmon, he needed a change in his menu soon, too much seafood could actually bore him out “Why are you having an attitude? Did I do anything to you? Oh, and why did you run earlier?”
“I know” Rose pouted, leaving her stuffed dragon on the couch and ran to the table to sit down on a chair. As Harry placed the plates down on the table, he realised he has lost his chances with Draco, all of it, just because he was slower than another dude.
“She got a point” Pansy spoke up, shrugging when the two Gryffindor looked at her “What? I know him, and she’s right, Draco’s brilliant”
“Now you’re saying nonsense” He replied, ignoring what Harry just said, he couldn’t believe the words of a drunk person, he should know that
Ron unfortunately had to be on Draco’s side this time, he understood why he would react this way, since he was in the same situation years ago when he was dating Blaise. He didn’t think his parents would approve of someone like him, he was afraid their relationship would be forbidden if they found out he was letting another man’s dick in his arse. Turned out, he was wrong “So they solved it?”
Draco whined, opening his legs intentionally for Harry to go deeper. Harry hollowed his cheeks, grazing his teeth teasingly while casting a wordless spell, and Draco seemed to know when his hands moved to open his arse wide apart. Since it was Draco’s first time, Harry didn’t want to hurt him, he pushed the first finger in slowly and stopped as soon as he heard Draco’s hiss
“Well, I’m still him, but I’m from another universe” He said and Harry’s eyebrows furrowed together “Okay, I know it sounds crazy. But in my world, we hate each other. We despise each other, we’re arch rivals. And, well, one day, I saw a mirror in this same room, and I saw us kissing, I freaked out and tried to destroy it, and the next thing I knew, I was here, in your world” He started explaining as Harry widened his eyes “It’s crazy, I know, but I’m telling you the truth. That mirror is cursed, and remember that thing Luna told us? About how there are multiple universes living like us right now? I think it’s true. Merlin, I know it’s hard to believe” He said, retreating his hand and clutching on his robes instead “You may think I’m going insane right now”
“Oh, and Haley, there’s nothing going on between us. She was just…she got drunk and slept on my couch, and invited herself to lunch, and er, and touched my…stuff without my permission. Nothing happened between us, and I don’t have any feelings for her”
Draco almost bumped into him on the way out, his hair still wet, droplets of water trailing from his neck down to his collarbone, and disappearing under the dark red satin robe he was wearing, tied at the waist and showing just enough skin to make Harry covered his lower part “
“I’ll heal you” He said, murmuring a wandless spell and then placing a soft kiss on his wrist, watching the way their son’s face lightened up “All done”
“Really?” Harry snickered at his tied hands, which Draco had done with his green tie while they kissed, the knot looked nice “This isn’t going to stop me”
want that to happen. Instead of confessing, he decided to keep his feelings somewhere deep in his heart and all his friends have to help him do it “
“Ron” The redhead stood straight up and looked in the mirror, Blaise was standing at the door, looking at him with sorry eyes, it won’t work this time
“Of course” He replied, looking at Draco again “Er, so, I’m sorry for avoiding you all this time, I have a perfectly good reason for it”
“Good morning, Aurors, you probably know why we’re are all in here, as you can see” Draco pointed to the board in the meeting room. It was just after Christmas and almost New Year, alas crimes never rest, he had to wake at barely four in the morning to check the crime scene. The Auror life hasn’t been easy on him, he was a former Death Eater after all, that was why they wanted him to go and checked the crime scene alone and didn’t bother to ask any other Auror to wake up that early, they were all still discriminating shit bags even after the three years that he’s been working here, Draco sighed and continued “There was a murder, the victim is…” He pointed at the picture of a dead body on the bed, blood all over the crime scene.
“I guess” Draco replied nonchalantly, he wasn’t sure they would even accept him, not with the mark on his arm, but he has hopes in Madam Pomfrey’s words “I haven’t thought about it much, I’m sure my parents would even dislike it, but I think I will try to be a good one”
“You know, you don’t have to do this” Draco said when they were having dinner at the Great Hall, with Potter doing everything for him, putting his favourite food in his tray, filling up his goblet with pumpkin juice. Not only that, he also did a bunch of other things, like holding his bag for him, carrying books for him, Potter was just too nice for him. Maybe it was because he still considered Draco as his boyfriend, but it was getting annoying, because it was way too sweet, Draco could not handle it.
Harry nodded and Draco let go of his hand, he remembered Harry had gotten a zero that day for forgetting the one ingredient, and here he was now, still making the same mistake.
“Don’t patronise me” Potter snapped at him, his nose scrunching up at the pain on his arm “You’re so bloody annoying, Malfoy”
Did you have a concussion when you fell down?” Pansy scoffed and started laughing, clapping her hands together “That’s funny, Draco”
going to surprise you” Theo spoke, one hand gripping on Neville’s leg and one hand covering his mouth to stop a laugh “But
cause Draco to stay in bed the next day because he couldn’t move his arse anywhere at all. One time it was a skirt, one time it was a pair of heels, and one time she even had the bloody sex swing delivered at their house, which she claimed was useful and would improve their sex life. Draco believed she just did this to tease him because without her
?” He slid his finger off and trailed it down Potter’s body “I can’t wait any longer” Draco planted a kiss on Potter’s cheek before sliding down on his knees, he pushed Potter back against the wall and locked eyes with him as soon as he started holding Potter’s length in his hand. Draco took a deep breath, he licked around the head teasingly, when he finally swallowed it in, he felt Potter’s hand on the nape of his neck and his ragged breath above him, he couldn’t go quite all in, but it was the best he could do, it was Potter’s fault for having such a huge cock. He bobbed his head, sucking in earnest, Draco hollowed his cheeks and heard Potter murmuring incoherently, Draco’s knees were starting to get sore, he slipped one hand down to stroke himself, his other hand playing with Potter’s balls, making the man above him even more pent up
“Alright” Potter snickered softly and looked at Draco, the blond felt a sudden wave of unknown feelings in his heart but kept looking back at him “The kiss was perfect, in fact, I want more” He said jokingly, but Draco’s heart beat faster when he heard it
“Sorry” Harry mumbled while Draco was still trying to calm his breath, Harry’s hands were still under Draco’s robes, holding him possessively “I, er…”
Harry mumbled, Rose must have taken it out of his pocket when he carried her out of the kitchen, he should have known she got Pansy’s Slytherin side “
” Pansy said, grinning at Ron before looking and clutching on the guy’s robes “Ready?” He nodded and Ron led him through the crowd. No one really paid attention to the guy covered in Slytherin robes and a mask when they were all focus on Harry. Ron quickly pulled a chair with him and walked to the middle of the room, putting the wooden chair down. He inhaled deeply before cupping his hands around his mouth and yelled
“Spin the wand!” Everyone was suggesting games that they’ve all played before. Draco sat down, before him was Harry and Ron, while he was squeezed between Theodore and Ernie Macmillan. Blaise didn’t play, he wasn’t the type of person to do it, but he was still watching them. For Ginny, she enjoyed alcohol more than games. And since Pansy was proving to Hermione she was responsible, she also didn’t join and decided to chaperone the party with Hermione.
“Thank you, dad” He grinned as Harry took Draco’s hand in his again, drawing James’s attention to their locked hands “Why do you always hold dad’s hand?”
was the same person Draco took a picture of this morning just because he got the hots for the guy in his campus. Turned out, this cologne
“Good” Narcissa smiled at him and pulled out a small box from behind her “Here’s something I prepared” He handed it to Harry and he opened to see a gold ring with green gemstone on it “It’s my wedding ring, it’s fine if you two want to have your own ring, you can use it as an engagement ring, if you want to”
“Oh, well, I feel closer to Draco using his, you know, since we’re pretty close now” He said, that was clearly a horrible lie, but he tried his best “What are you two doing here?”
me” Pansy furrowed her eyebrows, slapping his thigh and clicked her tongue “Get up, get dressed, and get out of here”
Harry wasn’t wrong, right? He thought about what he did, and he didn’t know where he was wrong, maybe locking the jerk in the loo was a little extreme, but if not, how could he warn Draco? During the two weeks after the incident, he still met Draco and Brandon with their friends, but they didn’t talk. Harry didn’t want to look at them either, but only because all Draco did was snogging Brandon, Harry was annoyed, but he was in no place to say anything about it. Pansy said Draco did it on purpose to rile Harry up, partly because he locked Brandon in the loo, and also because Draco saw Haley wearing the ring Harry intended to propose Draco with and got angry. Since Draco always tell Pansy everything, Harry believed her words, or tried to. Because it all led to this moment right now, when Pansy told him Draco just had sex with Brandon.
Theo shouted, a drop of tears fell from his eye, he wiped his eyes and really looked at Neville now “
” His toes curled and he was already feeling his orgasm coming close, with Harry ramming at the right spot and his hand jerking Draco, the blond couldn’t take it any longer
“You are acting strange, Draco” Blaise said without looking at him, he pulled out two quills and parchments softly, making Draco’s eyebrows furrowed
“I’m done” Luna said after writing down a bunch of stuff in the parchment and tear it in pieces, folding it up and putting it in her hat “Everyone, close your eyes, please” Draco closed his eyes, listening to her footsteps, it was soft and steady, just like Luna herself. When she put a hand on his shoulder, Draco jolted slightly “
“Come on, I know you always have a backup to your backup plan, and then a backup to your backup backup plan” Ron scoffed and leaned on the wall next to Pansy “You’re exactly like Hermione at that point”
” Harry said, and Draco surprisingly obeyed. He started bouncing on Harry’s cock, slowly at first, so he could get used to the size inside him, but every time he sank down, he has to bit back on a moan. People were dancing after the loud music, but it didn’t mean he could moan as loud as he wanted
“A scratch?” Draco asked, narrowing his eyes and looking down at Potter’s arm again “What scratched you exactly?”
—oh, Draco! You’re up!” Granger walked in the Common Room freely, which he has never seen before, giving Pansy a kiss on her cheek “I’m glad you’re up, Harry freaked out when he found you in the Room of Requirement, but you never want him to make a fuss about your health, so he asked me to check on you”
“Er, okay” Potter said, bobbing his head to show that he understood it, he extended his hand and Draco raised an eyebrow at him.
, did you just bite me?” Harry flinched away, gaping at Draco and covering the spot on his neck that the blond just bite on
“Oh so would you rather that I go around and let every guy fuck me?” He grunted at Potter “Is it all in yet?”
sad, by the way” Pansy sat on the other side next to him, her hands removing the bowl of popcorn out of his lap “We saw him”
“I’m getting upset because for once, a guy is not treating you like shit like the others, but somehow you still think of coming back to one of those former arse?” He said, clearly what he said shocked everyone, Pansy didn’t say a thing, Blaise looked like he wanted to know what Theodore would say next “Just so you know, don’t break his heart, he’s a decent guy. I couldn’t imagine if you do what all your former boyfriends did to him”
“…and five minutes into the car ride, we realised we forgot our kids at the mall” Pansy laughed and sipped on her champagne, leaning on Hermione for support “Hermione was yelling all the way back there,
“Yeah” He smiled “Will you still love me when I look like that?” He asked, looking up at Harry and wrapping his arm around his waist “When we’re all old and wrinkly?”
“Hey, hey” Harry sat closer and spoke “It’s alright, I won’t sue, your boss won’t know, and you’ll be fine”
“No, I’m not, hit me” Harry smiled at him and Draco punched Harry’s chest gently. As soon as he did it, Draco began laughing when Harry acted melodramatically like he was punched hard, he stepped back a few steps and leaned on the wall, his hand clutching on the spot Draco just punched, his face twisted with fake pain.
“Honestly, I didn’t remember what happened at that party” Ginny said, she probably ended up sleeping during it that day “But I do remembered vaguely that Ron cried because Romilda Vane yelled at him”
“Oh no, don’t worry” Hermione shook her head and placed her champagne down on the bedside table, she then Accio her robes and put it on gracefully without flashing anything inappropriate for Draco to see “We’re done”
He mumbled quietly and she nodded, he knew she loved him and only wanted the best for him. It has always been like that, she has always been his rock for over 17 years, she knew what she was doing, so he believed that she did this out of love “I know”
“Yeah, I guess so, who would have though? Maybe Weasley couldn’t handle Granger and her excessive need to be the best out of everyone” Pansy scoffed, rolling her eyes and picking up her fork. It got kind of funny when he realised Pansy has started talking about Hermione more. The blond dipped his fork into the mashed potatoes, thinking carefully in his head. Maybe he could do something about it after all.
“No, you won’t. Don’t worry” Pansy patted his back and reassured him “Don’t stress yourself. Maybe just…spray at the next person you see, I guess it’ll work” She said and Draco scoffed
“Harry isn’t over him either” Ron shrugged, chugging down his beer bottle and grabbed another from the table nearby “Maybe it’s a good thing. Did you call him on purpose?”
“Alright” She held her arms up in defeat and opened the door “Just finish this quickly, alright? I’m not missing my Thanksgiving at the Burrow because of you two, Molly’s gonna make me my favourite yam”
“That’s brilliant, so it’s at my house, Number 12, Grimmauld Place, you can Floo in or Apparate there, the party starts at 9 and last until after midnight”
“We’re discussing an important matter to him” Lucius said firmly, his hands holding the cane and staring at Ron suspiciously “About marriage”
Draco said, smiling at her and leaning back on his headboard “You’re just spending a lot of time with her lately, even more than before. Sometimes I just see you two together a lot, and not the other two, Padma Patil and Hannah Abbott”
“Want to go out there again?” Harry asked and Draco gave him a curt nod, standing up and letting Harry lead him out. The sweater made him warmer for some reasons, and he felt like this night has gone better than he ever expected.
the room” Hermione nudged her by the elbow and laughed “Sorry guys, all the nearby suites are for couples so there’s only one bed, and you two have to be close to us” She shrugged and pulled a piece of parchment in front of them “Here’s our plan for today and the next few days, we will go on adventure, hiking in the forest, swimming under waterfalls, kayaking, spa, cooking class, drinking by the beach, watch the sunset, stuff like that”
his food, he knew the blond didn’t actually mean it, since they have been living together for 3 years. The truth was that Draco loved his food but never letting him get that satisfaction, so instead of compliments, Draco complained all the time.
“I want you” Harry pulled Draco down until their faces were centimetres away, their breath ghosting over each other, he could tell that Draco was nervous “Scared?”
coincidental” Pansy nudged him, he could never study anymore now that she got here “A few months ago, we were having lunch, and you two were making out, Luna suddenly mentioned something about how there are multiple universes that are existing at the same time like us right now, like there are hundreds of versions of us in each universe there”
“I can do things without people noticing” Pansy shrugged, handing him his own box that contained the ring he has been keeping for months “Plus, you’re really oblivious” She said, and everyone nodded along “So, here’s how this is gonna go. Pretend this is one of your occasional special thing you and Draco always do. You’re in a restaurant, we’ll play the customers, Blaise and Ron are the chef, Rose
“Here, I got the prettiest mask I could find” Ron handed Pansy a mask after searching Ginny and Luna’s house for half an hour to find the nicest one, now they were standing in front of the door, just waiting for the person to come while Harry was in the living room talking to their former classmates
“Don’t be, it’s still good, I like it” Potter nudged him and Draco looked up at him “And if you don’t mind, I want to keep this as a gift too”
“Jealous? I’m just mad that she cancelled something that the Headmistress told us to, just to date someone”
Hermione gaped, but Pansy knew she was just being dramatic, that must have resulted from years of living with Pansy, Hermione acted like her too “I’m a Muggleborn”
“Smith, for the tenth time, stop talking” Draco said, Smith kept asking about him, and won’t stop winking at Draco, which made him super uncomfortable, considering Smith was so not his type, he might have had a one night stand with him, but it was out of desperation, he wasn’t that sad anymore “I can’t do this if you don’t shut your mouth”
“What’s that? I couldn’t hear you” Potter tilted his head to the side, he smiled knowingly at Draco,
“Hi, you two” He smiled, leaning close to hug both of them before looking down “You brought your kid to a pub?”
Draco leaned on the wall, watching as people came in every few seconds into the Room of Requirement. It was definitely strange being in this room again, but as long as there was no bloody mirror bringing him to an alternate universe, he should be fine. A few students from every House have already arrived, since the N.E.W.T.s was coming up, some have decided to stay, which was exactly why Draco was surprised to see the Golden Trio walking in the room.
“I won’t be convinced until he tells me” He said, as much as he liked Potter, he didn’t want to be the one to say it first. Their friendship was new, and it was fragile, he didn’t want to ruin it. Potter might have just been friendly to him this whole time, he didn’t want to assume anything, he didn’t want to get hurt.
Draco widened his eyes and a shiver ran up his spine when Harry said the word. It could not be coincidental, could it? The weird thing was, when Luna said the word, it didn’t make him blush, but when Harry called him like that, he felt like his cheeks were burning up. Draco stayed still in his place, watching Harry look around the circle with the others. Padma was switching her place to Seamus’s lap while her sister was with Dean. Meanwhile, Draco noticed Theodore’s small frown when Hannah Abbott took her seat on Neville’s thighs as he moved to Ernie Macmillan’s. And surprisingly, Ron was sitting on Romilda Vane’s lap, the one that gave Harry the chocolates cauldron filled with love potions that Ron took years ago, who kept calling him
“Alright, Gryffindor Common Room, tomorrow night” Pansy sprawled on Blaise’s bed freely like it was hers “The party starts at eight. You can wear anything”
“Hi” Harry greeted Pansy as soon as she opened the door, Hermione had called him for a emergency and asked him to babysit Rose, Harry had gladly accepted it, besides staying at home, babysitting Rose actually sounded better than anything he had done this week “I bought her a present”
“Well that’s why we’re setting them up” Hermione slipped her hands in Pansy’s hair and rested her chin on her head with a soft sigh. Hermione was invested in this just as much as Pansy so they were both frustrated with those two oblivious Aurors “Now that we’ve got them in the same place, it’s almost New Year, Harry hasn’t spoken any word to Draco, they’re clearly avoiding each other”
Everything aside from that was normal, they were going through a lot of tests, everyone was studying hard, no one suspected their relationship, and Pansy, of course, was still nagging him to tell Potter what happened. Draco continued eating, knowing Pansy was probably glaring at him right now, wondering why he just snapped at Potter.
“Here’s our free dessert” The nice waitress said with a smile, setting down the plate of chocolate soufflé “For the
was looking for him. Theo shrunk his clothing rack and his other tools once Draco left, Theo looked around the room and sighed before heading out. He walked along the hall and stopped when he heard voices on his right, he turned and that was it, his heart finally broke into pieces for real, because Neville was kissing Abbot right there. Theo clenched his hand on his bag and looked ahead, the lift let out a small ‘
way anyone could come here this instant, we need to find the best” Hermione said, flopping down on the couch again and turning to Pansy “Hey, you’ve been quiet”
“I can’t believe you can actually guess all of that” Seamus said in awe “Like without any act wrong”
“How could I not?” Draco exhaled when he remembered the night “We had dinner at the rooftop of our building, I kissed you when you complimented my eyes when we were looking at the moon”
Draco ordered and the Auror settled back down on his seat, the blond took a deep breath and intertwined his hands together, resting them on the table while processing what the fuck just happened
Pansy said, trying to find ways to get Lucius and Narcissa out of the house, they cannot see Draco right now, for the obvious reason.
“You go” He heard Ron mumbled and Harry was quickly pushed into the spot next to him, while Ron scurried to Blaise. Of course Ron’d sit next to the one that’s been tutoring him for the past weeks.
, Malfoy” Potter grabbed his shoulder the moment his hands started waving furiously, he made lots of hand gestures when he’s having a fit, it was a habit Pansy had pointed out many times but he couldn’t get rid of “I, it’s not a joke”
“Wait, who?” Ginny gasped “Wait…but Blaise and my brother became a couple days ago, so…” She pointed her finger at them and moved slowly until it pointed at Theo and Neville, who suddenly were sitting together now “
“Maybe if she doesn’t have to take care of everything, she might” He said and Pansy have him a weird look “What I mean is, if
“Really?” Harry smiled softly, showing one dimple on his left cheek, which Draco found adorable “They mention you a lot, especially Pansy. Er, and I’m also friend with Ron, I think you know him”
“Hey!” Ron waved at them as soon as he arrived at the table, Harry greeted them as well, but Draco didn’t care
” Draco mumbled quietly, there was something about Harry that Draco couldn’t quite figure out, he was…curious about Harry
Pansy, look at Harry with that stupid smile on his face” Hermione grinned at him “You two look incredibly happy”
“No, it was a pleasure to be Harry Potter’s boyfriend for a minute” He said teasingly, he did feel kinda proud to say that he was Potter’s boyfriend
“Ron tricked me here” Harry said, chuckling a bit, and it only made Draco’s heart ached more. He missed the sound of that, he couldn’t bear it “Draco…look” He reached out his hand and was going to touch Draco’s but he retreated it quickly “I miss you…so much” Draco stared at him, the guy he was deeply in love with, was confessing to him again
now Draco felt guilty for lashing out at him again. Draco didn’t do it on purpose, he just wanted everything back to normal. He could not help smiling back every time Potter smiled at him, he could not help feeling all soft inside whenever Potter did something nice for him, and he could not help but liking the feeling of Potter’s warmth against him. He was finding himself falling for Potter in this world, only after a month of being here. Maybe he was just
“That’s not the point. Are you guys going or not?” She pinched Theodore’s leg, making him hiss loudly
“Oh, well, you know, Draco likes it” Potter stuttered, he was going to place the drink down again but Draco took it anyway, giving it a try. It actually tasted amazing, it was pretty fruity and not strong with alcohol at all, which was good because he didn’t like alcohol much to begin with “Is it good?”
“I can’t believe we are graduates now, we are practically adults” Pansy said as they emerged from The Great Hall. The ceremony had started since morning and ended before noon so the students could prepare to go home. All Professors including the Headmistress have made speeches. Even some students, like Granger and Weasley have each made one, and Harry one as well. Draco knew about it of course, since he was the one to help Harry come up with what to say and they had spent the night before together for him to rehearse it “Have you heard Granger’s speech? It was inspiring, wasn’t it?”
Draco yelled and Pansy laughed loudly before getting out of the room, the blond turned around and cupped Harry’s face “Are you alright? Did I hurt you?”
“Yeah, but, you see, I didn’t listen to you back then” Draco huffed out a breathy laugh “I kept my feelings”
” The girls chanted through the screen as Draco threw the shirts into the firing bucket. Draco must admit, he felt kinda better after throwing a few things into it, the love notes he used to write about his ex and stuck it around the house so the jerk could see, the framed picture of them in Disneyland, some of his ex’s boxers that he left here.
’ but he doubted she would see the text any time soon, and if she did, she won’t be able to call him now that his phone would run out of battery in a few minutes.
“Are you going to cum when our friends are right out there fighting?” He teased Ron, his hand sliding down Ron’s untouched cock, the redhead pressed his lips into a thin line, he couldn’t cum right here
“I mean, I know we hate Gryffindor, right?” Draco said, helping her open her mind just a little “But the war is over, shouldn’t we listen to what Headmistress always say, all Houses should be united, right?”
“So you mean…like we’re soulmates or something?” He whispered, glancing at Potter, who was searching for books with Weasley from afar “That’s got to be a joke”
“I’m sorry, that was insensitive of him, don’t answer that” Thomas chimed in with an apology and Draco glanced at Potter, who was sitting on the bed like a sad Crup
“Harry” Draco said in shock, his mouth opened a bit, Harry guessed he was surprised too, he was wearing his fancy dress robes, next to him was Brandon. Blond hair, blue eyes, robes just as flashy as Draco’s, he was the total opposite of Harry, neat and clean, while Harry put on the black suit he wore every year on May 2
“Erm, so, what’s next?” He moved closer so his chest touched Potter’s arm, the Auror looked at him for a few seconds before replying
“Could be” Draco smiled, applying the same thing he has been doing with three previous guys. It has been four hours, all the preparation were long, and then apparently no Aurors can pose, which led them to a bigger problem, Blaise took a long time for the Aurors to get familiar with the animals, and learned some basic poses. It was like watching statues at first, they were too stiff, even babies could pose better than them, and Draco has worked with babies before.
“Ready?” Blaise asked and Harry nodded, raising his arms a bit, the white snake was there, slithering around his left arm to across his shoulder and around his other arm. Draco watched as Harry posed with the snake, it wasn’t bad like Ron trying to pose with a naughty dragon or Smith posing with a wolf that kept sniffing his crotch. Harry…Harry was different, it was like…he has control over the snake
“Hey, are you alright?” The guy with brown hair and blue eyes in front of him waved his hand and snapped his fingers at Draco, bringing him out of his thoughts. He was a nice guy, but he wasn’t Draco’s type
Draco tilted his head back and whispered seductively in Harry’s ear, he could feel his husband’s body quivering behind him, and before he could say anything more, Harry was spilling hot seeds inside him. Draco smiled in reflex, he loved that feeling, Harry was still holding him tightly, his chin leaning on Draco’s shoulder, they sighed softly and gazed at the city under the night sky.
“Enough with that, come on” Pansy raised her wine glass up and smiled proudly “To Hermione, who became the Minister for Magic today”
“Neville is sweet, they won’t have a problem with him” Hermione comforted Pansy, Harry looked at the long line of people waiting outside the restaurant, a part of him was looking for someone in particular, but he wasn’t here yet “Now, let’s go in first” When Harry walked in the restaurant, he was amazed, everything was simply extraordinary. White walls, the four tall columns, the massive crystal chandelier that spread across the ceiling, the oak tabletops with white chairs, big arch windows that Harry could see the people waiting in line outside, there was a big piece of art of the Forbidden Forest hanged on the wall, the art was totally opposite to the tone of the restaurant, yet it still looked incredible together, that was why Ron and Blaise decided to name the restaurant
, oh no, I was just thinking” Draco smiled mischievously and bit his lips “Like in those movies where the hot firefighter carried the girl in his arms. Have you ever done that?”
“Really? You are friends with Blaise’s fiancé? Wow” Draco gaped, he never would have guessed they have so many connections and… “
Romilda Vane got back on her feet and grabbed the piece of parchment, opening it wild and raised her voice “
“I don’t know how to do it, once I get back” It was what he was worried most when he got back. How could he do it, facing someone who hated him? Before this, it’d be fine because he hated Potter too. But now, it was different.
“Didn’t a girl ask you out on a date a few days ago? And you agreed and chose this day?” Theodore kept asking all the good questions for Draco
“But I don’t care about them” Harry said, moving closer to Draco “I care about a certain blond, pompous git that sneaked a few glances at me during the shoot, I noticed you, actually, you are the only one I noticed”
“Why? You could just say no” Harry asked, Draco has every right to decline Pansy’s offer. He knew Pansy and Draco disappeared a year after graduating from Hogwarts, but he never asked where they went off to, it just wasn’t his place to ask such questions.
He said, pushing Harry away and grinned at him, only to realised what he had just done. Harry was standing there, staring at him in disbelief, Draco cleared his throat and retrieved his hands on Harry’s arms, he was trembling himself too “I mean, you got it, good job, Potter”
“Well, okay so” Pansy’s thoughts organised by itself in her mind, it took her seconds to come up with a plan “We will gather our close friends around Harry and Draco, so we can block anyone we don’t want to from approaching Harry!”
“You are already that” Blaise smirked but stopped when he realised Ron was serious “I can put up with that, I like you being jealous, it means that you like me enough”
have feelings for Potter again in that six months, but he thought he’d never have the chance. He didn’t think Potter would actually be attracted to him
Draco mumbled, standing on his tiptoes to connect their lips. It was just a their lips pressed against each other, but then Potter began moving his lips, sucking on Draco’s bottom lip, earning a satisfying hum from the blond, the Auror definitely know how to kiss. Draco opened his mouth just slightly, giving Potter enough access to slip his tongue in, and the moment he did it, he realised he should have been kissing Potter instead of pining on him, because he felt more than just physical heat, more than just burning skins touching one another. His emotions were high like they were on Muggle rollercoasters, he has never felt this feelings before, and he wasn’t sure whether it was because he was a virgin, or it was because of Potter, maybe both, it just felt right.
