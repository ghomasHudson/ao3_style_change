“It is,” Hermione said quietly. She winced when she noticed the weather changing outside. Dark grey clouds were swarming and the tell-tale sound of thunder grew in the distance. “Get yourself under control, please. You’re affecting the weather again.”
“That’s a lovely tradition,” Hermione commented. “Does it actually work?”
Robards eyed him for a few more moments, and Harry could feel him still probing around in his head. “Stand up,” Robards said eventually, pulling back from his assault on Harry’s mind.
Harry grimaced, but downed it in one. Instantly, steam that smelled of stale booze started billowing out of his ears and nose, a bit like pepper-up potion. It was far worse, however, and felt like his brain was falling out of his head. “Five minutes of this?” he cried.
“Did it work?” Hermione jumped on them as soon as they arrived.
Harry, Ron and Hermione were not greeted with the Ministry’s normal hustle and bustle as they stepped out of the floos, but the sound of about a hundred voices shouting their names and the clicking of cameras.
Harry nodded. “Okay, so Malfoy Manor is HQ. Okay with everyone?”
Hermione did as instructed, looking distinctly uncomfortable. “What now?” she demanded.
Hermione half-ran into Ron’s arms. “Who will Harry dance with?” Hermione finally said, finding her voice.
“Poor Neville. I was hoping we could give him some good news tonight,” Hermione commented. Harry groaned. He’d completely forgotten that he’d agree to go out with everybody tonight. He’d been hoping to spent a quiet night in with Teddy.
“Instil fear in Wizarding Britain again. Gather followers by threats. Try to take over the ministry.” Harry frowned. “They’ll need a leader.”
Neville shook his head. “Sorry.” He paused, and then said quietly. “Do you think, once the Ministry is done with them, I could give their wands to Gran? I think she’d like that.”
“The Potter Manor?” Malfoy asked. He rubbed his forearm. “I might stay here if that’s okay. I’ve got a lot of work to do,” he said nonchalantly.
“Oh, that makes sense,” Harry said mildly. He’d almost forgotten that Bill was nearly twice his age. “We should go and see him and Fleur soon,” he commented.
When the horrible sensation stopped, his headache had completely vanished, his mouth tasted like peppermint, and his teeth felt clean. Harry felt a lot better. “Thanks, Ron. You guys are going into Diagon Alley?” he asked curiously.
Harry followed Malfoy into Grimmauld Place’s formal sitting room. He hadn’t spent much time in it since they’d moved in, finding the dark green curtains blocking the windows and the smell of rising damp a bit too gloomy for him.
“It’s quite alright, Grannuff. Ms. Granger and Lord Malfoy will understand it much better than I will,” Harry smiled. “They are my…” he trailed off, not sure what to say. Friends? Hermione, certainly. Malfoy, not so much.
Harry blushed, and turned his attention to feeding Teddy, who was impatiently shoving his fingers into his mouth.
Kingsley gasped. “A blood ward? That’s incredibly dark magic. Although, I suppose Dumbledore wouldn’t have resorted to such drastic measures unless absolutely necessary.”
“Of course,” Harry said, fighting to keep the excitement out of his voice.
Malfoy snorted. “I wasn’t cleared, Potter. I was pardoned.”
Harry perked up. The Hermione-like voice in his mind really didn’t like the idea of leaving his education unfinished. On his left, Ron shuddered.
“I smell like blood,” Harry warned. “And sweat.”
Harry smiled tiredly. “Yeah, I reckon I just did.”
. I will be sending out the letters later this week.”
Mrs. Weasley was frowning. “I know that Robards wouldn’t put you on the team if he wasn’t absolutely sure that you were ready, but I don’t like the idea of you being out facing those Death Eaters.”
Harry sighed, but nodded, sensing a losing battle. Perhaps Hermione would have some ideas. “Fine. I’ll do it tonight.”
Malfoy nodded. “I don’t think that’ll pass either, especially after the war.”
Malfoy looked up sharply.
Robards raised an eyebrow but pressed on. “According to Greyback, Jugson and gang have three safe houses. One of these, we already knew about, and they haven’t been back since the battle. One is in Scotland, nowhere near where they’ve been spotted, and one, a muggle warehouse, just outside Ottery-St.-Catchpole. I suggest we swarm it this afternoon.”
Harry rolled his eyes but agreed readily, not going to pass up an opportunity to get closer to the blond.
Harry pretended to ignore them, not seriously bothered, and far too excited about the list, but smiled when Ron interjected with a protective, “Hey, he’s got us.”
“Not necessarily,” Harry admitted. This version of Bella appeared slightly saner than the last time he’d encountered the witch. He wanted nothing more than to destroy Bella for good. For Sirius. For Hermione. For Neville. And, some little part of him wanted to kill her for just being inconvenient. But he knew that she’d be much more valuable to him alive. “You could prove useful. I have things I need to know. About your husband and his brother, for example. I’m also aware that you have extensive knowledge of the dark arts. It would be useful to have someone to teach me.” He pressed the fang against the corner of the painting. “But, I do have other sources for these things.”
The elves waved them off as, clutching bottles of the Potter Manor’s Elvish Wine, they stepped through a newly-connected floo with promises that they’d set up a nursery for Teddy.
the remaining darke objects from the cells, he took one final look at his basement before making his way up the stairs and into the kitchen. The door swung closed behind him. “
He worked in tandem with Cragg, but soon realised that Cragg was working quicker than he was. Harry frowned and holstered his wand. Closing his eyes, he willed each of the links to snap quietly. Subtly. He felt a hum of approval flow through Cragg’s magic. He worked in sections, and, in no time at all, the team had managed to bring down and replace the wards over the warehouse.
At Harry’s confused look, Hermione explained softly. “The Dark Arts.”
Harry couldn’t help but think that it would be much easier if Malfoy just came with them, but he couldn’t wait to see the house. Nodding his goodbye to Malfoy, and wrapping Teddy in his sling, he linked arms with his friends.
Harry blinked at him. “My ring?” he asked.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Yes. When is all this happening, by the way?”
“Oh brilliant, I’m starving,” Ron said as he swapped the bag of curries, rice and naan from Harry’s hand with his gurgling black-haired godson.
Harry nodded. Even though he was technically only talking to Neville, he could feel the others listening in. “Goyle was dead when we got there. Avery, Jugson and Crabbe are in custody. We think we know all their safehouses, but not sure that’ll be a great help anymore. Not sure how smart the Lestranges are. They know we know at least one of their safehouses, and presumably they’ve seen the paper, so they’ll know Greyback gave us information. If I were them, I’d not risk going to another safehouse.”
The three made their way inside. Harry could hardly see five feet in front of him, due to the cloud of dust that had enveloped the room. Keeping close to the wall, they advanced slowly, stopping as they reached a body.
Hermione and Ron soon entered the room, the latter carrying an unbearably cute Teddy in a tiny version of some dress robes. Harry stood and took the infant, who gurgled in delight and changed his hair from dark blue to black briefly, before returning to his currently-preferred style of bubblegum pink.
Ginny smiled softly. “You sleeping tonight?” she asked.
Harry chuckled, sitting down on the floor next to his friend’s armchair. “Rooky mistake.” He glanced at his watch. “He’ll wake up soon for his next feed anyway.”
“Nope,” Proudfoot laughed, taking the lead as they jogged into the building.
Sensing Harry’s discomfort, Savage smiled. “Well, if you ever need a babysitter, I’m always free. Same with Proudfoot.”
George’s smile froze on his face. “No, thank you,” he said quietly.
“Yeah, well, I can’t sleep if I don’t take it,” Harry grumbled, although perhaps two bottles had been an overkill.
Harry frowned. “But no one is in my houses. Everyone’s dead. Apart from Teddy, I suppose.”
Harry smiled. “It’s better than I could do,” he said, and turned to the fireplace. “मेरी माँ और पिता और मेरे गॉडफादर सीरियस और रेमुस को,” he repeated, wincing at his butchering of the language. He spilled the wine into the hearth. Nothing magical happened, but Harry’s heart lifted a bit, knowing that his parents were still with him. “Thank you,” he said quietly to Malfoy.
“Do you know where this money has gone?” Harry asked, not surprised by the goblin’s answer.
,” she cast, raising a painted thin black wand to touch the corner of the frame.
“You’d better, young man,” Robards grumbled.
The magic swirled around Harry for a moment. “I know.” The magic instantly settled. Harry and Malfoy were both left panting. Hermione and Ron jumped up from the table quickly.
Harry blinked. Ron very rarely voiced his opinion in large groups. Harry and Hermione knew he was brilliant, of course - he always knew what to say when Harry and Hermione got too passionate. He was their voice of reason – a quiet voice of reason amidst the chaos of Hermione’s brilliance and his own fiery emotions.
Ron smirked. “Always.”
Proudfoot sighed. “Well, it’s nowhere near as good as British quidditch,” he said, ignoring Kai’s yelp of indignation, “but since there are no professional games in Britain until next week, I’ve had to make do. Are you going to the Arrows vs. Wasps game?”
Before Harry could … apologise? defend his decision?, Hermione smiled and raised her glass. “True, but we’re celebrating. Harry got his dream job, and you’re having your very first meal on a living room floor,” she said drily.
Malfoy smirked. “I’m pleased you think so. I wouldn’t worry about it – it’ll never pass. We’ve been talking about it for twenty years. You won’t like the other side of the argument, though,” he warned. “Some of the Old Crowd want to bring back the Blood Laws.”
Harry frowned. “I don’t have my NEWTs.”
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. “Why would Lupin be impressed with muggle stuff?”
“No,” Harry frowned. “You were cleared.”
Balancing the cardboard drinks holder on the bar of the pram with one hand, Harry windlessly cast a stasis charm over the drinks so that they wouldn’t get cold. As he walked, he appreciated being out and about without too many strange looks. There were still a few – after all, a seventeen-year-old boy with a pram wasn’t a very common sight in the streets of Pentonville – but Harry revelled in his relative anonymity.
Hermione frowned. “You’ll just be in the training team, right?”
“Don’t be daft. There are exactly five people who know the spell that you cast on me in sixth year. One of them is dead. I know it wasn’t me. And there’s precisely one of your Golden Trio who is powerful enough to cast it,” Malfoy snapped. “Do me the courtesy of recognising my general intelligence, Potter.”
Hermione rolled her eyes. “Good luck,” she said, before stepping into the green flames of Harry’s fireplace.
P.P.S. I'm not sorry for all the Shakespeare quotes - warning: they will only get more abundant as this story develops.
“I’m sorry! It’s hard not to think about it!” Ron said, his ears going bright red.
Harry cast a silencing charm over Teddy, hoping he wouldn’t wake up from their conversation. He watched as Malfoy started to panic. “Don’t move, Malfoy. Your skin is barely stitched together. I’ll doubt it’ll hold if you move.”
Harry pulled away from Ron regretfully. “Lestrange brothers got away. We got the rest, but Goyle was dead when we got there.”
“That- that might work, actually,” Malfoy said after a moment’s consideration. “I don’t like it, but the magic will certainly be easier to manage if I do.” He turned to Harry. “And- and if you can find a way to get rid of, or lock away the darke objects in this house, my mother and I will move here. It was a very kind offer, and I do think it would help settle her mind. Thank you.”
“I trust you have a good reason to commit treason?” Bill asked once the wards were set.
Closing his eyes, he concentrated, and soon was able to see the threads of magic that were delicately laced around the school. Reaching out further, he could see there were tiny gaps between some of the links. “
Harry did as he was bid, Malfoy indicating which family each ring belonged to as he picked them up.
Hello everybody! I'm so sorry for the radio silence - I've only just finished my exams for this year. Also, I literally had to rewrite this five times before I was remotely happy with it. I know it's short but there is more to come shortly. xx
Harry nodded, his throat finally unsticking. “I know. Thanks, dad.”
Ron clapped him on the back. “Well, you’re alive. That’s all that matters. Have you read the paper?”
Hermione blushed. “Yes. I can’t say it was a surprise, but it is an honour. Did you get Quidditch?”
Malfoy kept frowning. He looked at Harry carefully. “I owe you several life-debts.”
Harry looked up sharply. “Who else had access to the account?”
“Mordecai Berrycloth,” a tall, bald wizard with an extremely long red beared said as he reached out his hand. Despite his facial hair – a long beard always reminded Harry of old wizards like Dumbledore – he looked quite young. In his late twenties, maybe. “But everyone calls me Kai. It’s good to meet you, Potter,” he said in a strong American accent. “I’m glad you’ve joined – it means I’m not the newest recruit anymore.”
Narcissa gracefully lowered her head. “I’m afraid I cannot do that, my lord.”
Harry sighed. “Yeah, Dumbledore said that about a lot of things.”
The day after the battle had been very bizarre. Neither Harry, Hermione or Ron had slept in over 48 hours by that point – unless one counted the 45 minutes in which Harry had been dead. Instead of grieving with his family for the loss of his brother, Ron had been forced to answer about a thousand questions along with Harry and Hermione from millions of reporters. Deciding to keep quiet about the horcruxes, too, didn’t help their case, as it meant they couldn’t answer many questions about what they were doing the year before. Hermione had spun a tale about working against Voldemort’s dark magic but didn’t go into much detail. The reporters were not best pleased, and the questioning became more interrogative. Ron had eventually given up hiding his frustration and politely told them all where to shove it. Hermione had pretended to be disappointed, but Ron and Harry both knew that deep down she was just as pleased as them when the reporters finally stopped their incessant questioning.
“No,” Harry said.
Comfortable silence wrapped up the room, until Ginny cleared her throat. “Harry, want to say a word before a certain blond joins us?”
Harry grinned at Hermione’s response.
“Ron, I want you to be happy. You do whatever you want to do. I think you’ll be a fantastic businessman,” she said firmly.
Savage looked like she was going to argue, but Harry thought Elfie had a point. Gossip and rumours in the Wizarding World were nearly always false but were a good indication of what the common man was thinking, and Harry, Ron and Hermione had long since learned to keep up to date with whatever nonsense the Prophet was printing, even – no, especially – when it was about himself.
“What the fuck?” Malfoy asked incredulously. “If Dumbledore wasn’t already dead I might try to kill him again.”
Hermione nodded indignantly. “Of course I can, Malfoy.”
“Lord Potter, I, Lord Malfoy, ask that you forgive me of my life debts to you. I willingly give myself for your service,” he said calmly. “On behalf of the House of Malfoy, I also extend my allegiance to the houses of Black, Gaunt, Peverell and Potter. So, mote it be.” Even when swearing his allegiance, Malfoy was able to retain his dignity.
“Yeah, Nev. It’s good to see you. You too, Luna,” he grinned, kissing the latter on the cheek.
Neville rose and reached out a hand for him to shake. “My pleasure, Lord Malfoy.”
“Alright,” he said quietly. “How do we do this?”
Harry swallowed nervously as the bear dissipated into a fine silvery mist. This was it. The last of the Death Eaters were on the other side of these wards. It was almost over. He reached out with his magic again and felt for the wards.
Malfoy blinked, looking at Harry with surprise. “No, this is good,” he said quietly.
like he usually would, he tried to picture Cragg’s wand flying into his hand. When he opened his eyes, he felt a tug of magic, and the wizard’s wand was in his hand.
Harry pulled a face. “Yeah I am. I was really excited, but Kingsley’s turning it into a press thing. I wanted to go with Polyjuice.”
Harry ran a hand through his hair. Neither sounded particularly good. “If some escaped from the sting, what are they likely to do?” he asked.
Robards’ bear appeared again. “They know we’re here.”
Harry swallowed. Without realising it, he’d sat at the head of the table. Again. “Erm. Well, he knows everything, so if you want to ask me questions about the past couple of days, you can while he’s here. It’s really weird to say, but I trust him. I don’t expect you guys to, but yeah, if it’s worth anything, I do.”
Leaving the room, Harry kept glancing back at the portrait, his heart hammering in his chest. Hermione squeezed his hand and Ron clapped him on the back.
Harry rubbed the back of his neck. “What happened to it?” he asked cautiously. He had long since learnt that one shouldn’t simply humour Luna, but actually listen to her advice. She was a Ravenclaw, after all.
Robards grunted something that sounded suspiciously like “Dumbledore.” He cleared his throat. “Greyback is holding back information. He is able to resist Veritaserum and has fairly strong occlumency skills. We might be able to get more out of him, but at this moment it looks doubtful. As we do not know where they are, we have to draw them out. We have two options: sting or battle.”
“The trials will take place on June 2
Harry made his way up the stairs to George’s room. It felt strange even calling it George’s room – before, it had always been referred to as the Twins’. Expecting the familiar sight of a pale George sitting numbly on his bed while Ron and Hermione fleetingly attempted to engage him in conversation, he was surprised to see Ron and George talking animatedly when Harry opened the door.
“Of course,” Grannuff said, looking mildly offended. “Lord Potter has inherited several, including this one,” he said as he produced another roll of parchment.
“She’s a Black, or at least she was, but she married a muggle. For my aunt, that was worse than marrying a muggle-born or a blood-traitor,” Malfoy explained. No one needed reminding who his aunt was. “Pity she didn’t get Bella’s tongue too.”
Harry shifted uncomfortably. “Several, actually,” he frowned. “How am I supposed to know the Old Ways. No one even told me I was a wizard until I was 11.”
There was a sharp intake of breath, but Hermione’s voice only slightly wavered as she said loudly, “It’s a really good idea, actually. Nobody lives there, and no one would expect us to use it, even if it becomes known that Draco’s on our side.”
“Not with brute force, Potter,” Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Think like a Slytherin, not a Gryffindor for once. Offer a significant donation to the paper on the condition that they’ll conduct an internal review and start acting with integrity,” he said, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.
before his head had left the pillow.
“You’ll be fantastic, Ron,” Harry said, grinning broadly as he scooped up Teddy from Hermione’s arms. “What do you think, Teddy?”
Bill sighed. “No. She went mad.”
Stepping outside Grimmauld Place, they checked for any nearby muggles or wizarding witnesses. Seeing it was clear, Ron kept his gaze on the street, wand at the ready, while Harry turned to face the house.
“Molly, you should hear what Teddy did,” Harry told Mrs. Weasley excitedly.
“Hiya Teddy,” Harry greeted, whooshing him through the air. The infant made grabby hands towards the food. “Sorry, love, you’re too little for that. But we’ll have lots of curry when you’re older,” Harry promised.
Kai whistled lowly. “You have a death-wish, kid.”
“Do you think you could get more portkey ring things?” Ron asked suddenly.
“Because practicing the Old Ways has become synonymous with being Dark,” Malfoy said without preamble. “I’m surprised your parents celebrate, Weasley.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes again. Harry was starting to hate the smug git. “No one would dare go against the saviour.”
Harry frowned, worried that Robards thought him some unkillable being. “I can die, you know,” he said. “I have died,” he added after a moment.
“Well you can’t let Teddy grow up in a world where you’re not there to raise him!” Hermione ground out.
A small, nagging voice that sounded vaguely like Hermione’s sounded in his mind.
Malfoy sighed and ran a hand through his hair. “We need to sort out the guest list. More than two hundred, definitely. I shouldn’t think more than three.”
Ron and Hermione were both gripping their wands now, too. Robards sighed and placed his wand back in his pocket. “You can apparate?” he asked.
Harry thought the rings on his fingers felt a bit heavy and unusual but knew there’d be hell to pay if he tried to take them off.
An owl tapped on the window. Ginny opened it for him. “Oh look! My Hogwarts’ letter. And the Prophet,” she said, looking at Harry carefully after glancing at the front page. Mercifully she didn’t say anything and allowed herself up with Mrs. Weasley’s exclamations of “It’s about time!” and “We can get your books firsthand this year.”
McGonagall nodded approvingly. “I really need your magical strength on the wards at the gate, but I didn’t want to pressure you.”
Kai rolled his eyes at the lot of them. “You all take house loyalty way too seriously,” he said. “I’m hungry. Let’s go and eat.”
Harry sighed. “Why can’t there be a happy medium?”
“No,” Malfoy said softly. “You were always far too trusting.”
Ron grinned, clapping him on the back. “Of course. Excursions with you are always fun.”
Draco looked at him in surprise. “What do you mean, Weasley?”
Deciding against using the lifts, they entered a dark stairwell. Ron clicked on the lights with his deluminator, and they all retrieved their wands from their holsters. There was a cold shiver to the air in the stairwell, almost like the breath of a dementor.
In this story, Harry didn't snap the Elder Wand at the end of the battle.
They worked in silence, with only Harry’s mutterings and the pops of Kreacher apparating in with more towels and water. At some point, the blood stopped flowing, and Hermione started bandaging while Harry continued to stitch the skin together. By the time they were done, Harry’s couch was the colour of wine, Hermione, Harry, Ron and Kreacher were pale and panting, and Malfoy was still unconscious.
Harry was aware that Kingsley had advertised some Ministry roles in the US and Europe after the war. The new Minister had attempted to fire half of the ministry for having open connections to and support of Voldemort, but in the end only a few people had left – most supporters of Voldemort having claimed that they had been Imperiused. Personally, Harry reckoned they should’ve made everyone explain their actions in the war under Veritaserum, but according to Hermione and Kingsley, that was very much illegal without sufficient evidence of any illegal activity. And since the harming of muggleborns under Voldemort’s rule wasn’t illegal, there was nothing he could do. The ministry remained as fundamentally flawed as ever.
“No,” Hermione shook her head. “The floos can be tracked, no matter who uses them.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Please no more,” he whined. “The robes I had to wear at that ceremony were hideous.”
Ron nodded. “She was in Mungo’s for a few weeks after the trial. Apparently, she caused some damage when she put up her mental shields against Voldemort when she lied to him about you being dead. That’s what the healers think, anyway.”
Together, they managed to wash Teddy. Kreacher was surprisingly gentle with him, and even soothed him by bouncing him when the baby started to cry. He certainly had a lot of experience. Harry smirked at the thought of Sirius as a baby, imagining a young Gryffindor in a house of Slytherins. He wondered what it would be like for him if he’d followed the Sorting Hat’s advice and became a Slytherin. Would he have felt the same as Sirius? Or would he have been better suited to the Slytherin lifestyle? He couldn’t help but wonder if he and Malfoy would have been friends, or if their school rivalry would have persisted even if they were in the same house.
“I was thinking it should be purple,” Ron was saying, grinning briefly at Harry in greeting.
Hermione stood up from the bed and unruffled her clothes. “Alright, boys, we’d better be off. You know how McGonagall gets.” Looking at George hopefully, she added, “Do you want to come to?”
The death eater grinned as he ripped off his mask. “There are others,” he said, his teeth glinting in the light of the fiendfyre. “There will always be another war.”
Draco shrugged. “She thought I might want to warn Goyle about his dad.”
Harry frowned. He had thought that they had removed most of them in fifth year. “I understand. Dark magic is probably not fantastic for your mother’s recovery. I can have them removed, though.”
Harry blinked. “They’re not?”
Robards nodded in greeting. “I assume you’ve all read the Prophet?” Everyone murmured sounds of assent and a few cast blatant glances at Harry. Robards ignored them and continued. “In addition to a full confession, Greyback left us a helpful little note that gives us enough information to take down the other Death Eaters.”
Malfoy half-smirked, but quickly rearranged his face into a frown. “I wouldn’t have come here if I knew it was yours. You don’t have to deal with this.”
“Hey,” Ron grabbed his glass back.
Suddenly, Harry felt the wards of Grimmauld Place shift. Frowning, he drew his wand, holding Teddy protectively. As far as he was aware, it was only the Weasleys, Hermione, Kingsley and himself who could see the house under the fidelius charm, but he didn’t want to take any chances. Making his way to the front door, he peeked through the spy hole.
Eventually, they had gathered all thirty-eight objects, and they were lying, seemingly unassuming, on the kitchen table. There was a door to the right of the fridge, which Harry had never seen before. “This must lead to the dungeons,” he said. There was no doorhandle.
Bellatrix looked sad then. “A Lord accepts obedience and servitude in exchange for his protection and a share in his power, whether that be politically, financially, legally or magically. The Dark Lord was … lacking in this part of the exchange.” She laughed bitterly. “I was foolish to think he would protect anyone other than himself.”
Malfoy frowned and said nothing for a moment. “Are you aware, Potter, how many darke objects remain in this house?” he asked quietly.
Hermione was silent as she read. She sighed, “I’m not particularly keen on the idea of being in between the press and you, either, but he is right. You’d be two vulnerable if you were by yourself, and if you took anybody else it would raise too many questions.”
“That’s a brilliant idea! I bet he’ll come up with something,” Harry said hopefully. Mrs. Weasley passed the address back to him. “Are any of the others here?” he asked.
Ron grinned at him. “You handled those reporters well, mate.”
“I’m not surprised,” Ginny commented. “He was always second to Hermione in class,” she added thoughtfully. “How’s Ron handling it?”
Bill rolled his eyes. “Harry, my job puts me at risk. I was at risk during the war. What makes you think I crave a quiet life?”
After a quick lunch, Harry had been hoping that he would be allowed the rest of the day off to go and play with Teddy, but Malfoy had other plans.
Aaliyah Savage smiled grimly. “Better now that we have a full team. How are you? How’s Teddy?”
Harry looked at him in surprise. “Where’d you hear that?”
They released each other’s hands from their grasp. Harry poured some dittany on both of them. “I’d really rather not do that again,” Ron said grimly.
Malfoy nodded. “That’s what my father joined for, originally. At least, I think. Also, because the Dark Lord was crazy powerful, and it was suicide in Slytherin house to go against him.” He looked at them. “Don’t get me wrong, he knew what he was doing. He didn’t have any qualms about killing muggleborns. He wasn’t a good person by a stretch of the word.”
Ron spluttered. “Fuck off, Malfoy. I’m not dancing with you.”
“Of course you do.” Malfoy rolled his eyes. “You’ll need to invite the Sacred 28, and all of the people that belong to those Houses. Not to mention your connections at the ministry, a few representatives of the press, and all of your friends.”
“There are six names here!” Harry said, excitedly.
“Confundus! Stupefy!” Hermione and Bill cast. The guards hit the floor before they even realised something was happening.
Harry sighed heavily. “Well, you’re not wrong.” He turned to Neville guiltily. “I’m definitely not meant to tell anyone this, but you should know. We almost got the Lestrange brothers today, but they got away. I’m so sorry. We won’t stop until we find them.”
Savage unfolded her arms and nodded. The rest of the group said nothing, but everyone was suddenly far less tense than it had been when he walked into the room.
In front of the doors to the Auror Department, a tall man with a deep scar on his left cheek was waiting for them. “Mr. Potter,” the man said gruffly, shaking his hand in greeting. “Gawain Robards.”
Robards sighed. “Okay. And we all know your track record with the Killing curse.”
“I’m aware,” Harry said darkly. He could see where this was going. “What has that got to do with me interrogating him?”
It was Harry’s turn to gape. Glancing at Ron, who was standing just behind Hermione, it was clear that he seemed to think so too. “What?” Harry demanded.
“Yes… no. I don’t know,” Harry said quietly.
“Well, did you?” Harry asked.
Voldemort. He shook his head slightly to rid his mind of that particular path of thought. It made more sense now, why Draco was determined to keep making Oaths and Vows to him, and why Narcissa had so quickly acquiesced to coming under Harry’s protection. He frowned. Why hadn’t Draco mentioned the right of conquest? Harry found it hard to believe that he simply didn’t know – he was far too clever and calculating for that. Did he think Harry would be like Voldemort, if he knew of his power? Harry sighed and rubbed his scar again. He needed a drink. “How do I find Rabastan and Rodolphus?” he asked. “There must be a way for a Lord to call on his vassals.”
Hermione leaned in. “Is it true the family rings can act as a portkey to your family home?” she asked Malfoy.
“Why on earth would you read that rubbish?” Savage asked accusingly. “That magazine is the singular reason Britain didn’t have witch’s suffrage until 1980.”
“You killed Greyback. Ginny’s face gave it away. And the blood on Ron’s shirt. I want in. For Fred,” he said plainly.
. Now that that’s finished, we can start his trial.”
Harry shuddered. He couldn’t help but spare a thought for his aunt, uncle and cousin. They were abusive and neglectful arseholes, but Dudley had apologised – kind of – and Petunia had done that weird thing when she said she lost a sister when Harry lost a mother. They certainly had quite a bit of nasty karma coming their way, but they didn’t deserve to be the targets of some rogue Death Eaters. He knew the Weasleys were relatively safe in the Burrow, due to the insane amount of Ministry-approved (and not-so-approved) protection spells and wards, but he couldn’t help but worry for them, too.
Harry shuddered. There was a proposed bill that all of the Death Eaters that were convicted will be sentenced to death by Dementor’s Kiss. Harry wasn’t sure how to feel. His first instinct was to be vehemently against it. It was a horrible fate, and not one he would wish on anyone. On the other hand, these were witches and wizards that had not only killed for Voldemort’s cause but enjoyed it. They had destroyed so many lives, including his own.
Harry turned to Draco and looked at him carefully. “Up to you,” he said after a moment.
“I see,” Kingsley said, looking relieved. “Well, let us know if we can do anything for you, Harry.”
He surged ahead, sidestepping the next curse and allowing his shield to absorb the impact of the following one with a loud gong-like noise. He saw Crabbe draw his wand back, ready to cast another Unforgivable.
“No, but I know someone who will,” Harry said grimly.
Malfoy shrugged. “No, but most pureblood children learn how to drink in other cultures, especially if they are the cultures of the other Sacred 28. As your elf said, the Malfoys and Potters have always been neighbours. It is only natural that the Potters would learn a bit of French and the Malfoys would learn a bit of Hindi.”
“I’m sorry? Have you met the Prophet reporters?” Harry asked sarcastically.
Draco huffed and rolled his eyes. “I’m not going to turn you in, you idiot. I’m fairly sure it was sanctioned, anyway, so I’m not sure what good that would do. Besides, as far as I’m concerned, it’s good riddance.” He paused and eyed Harry. “I would appreciate a forewarning, next time, as your unofficial publicist. It could all go rather pear-shaped very quickly if someone were to find out.”
Hermione smiled and poured herself a cup of tea. “See what I mean, Malfoy?”
“But that’s bonkers,” Harry said. “It’s all well and good in theory, but we can’t do that. They’ll want the magic for themselves.” He was surprised to hear his voice say all that, but the more he thought about it, the more he knew it was true. “There’ll be another war.”
“Harry!” Hermione greeted him. She was still attempting to teach Ron piano, but privately Harry thought that Ron was being bad at purpose so she would spend more time with her nose out of a book. “How did everything go with Malfoy?”
“Kreacher,” Harry called as he paced in the living room.
“Forgive me, Lord Potter. They would not wait for your authorisation,” the goblin said, scowling.
Harry nodded. He didn’t point out that he was the reason that they’d been camped out there in the first place.
They made their way into the living room, and Ron started to unpack the food, summoning some cutlery from the kitchen.
Luna smiled and calmly agreed. “As long as I never have to see the dungeons.”
Harry frowned. “I recognise the name.”
“You were?” Harry asked, excitedly. These elves had known his parents!
George nodded, “Only if the box itself is orange.” Turning to Harry, he grinned. “Your majesty,” he bowed deeply.
Harry shook his head. “I can take cruciatus. I didn’t know what that spell did. It was seriously irresponsible. I should’ve just left you alone.”
At Harry’s confused look, Hermione sighed. “When Voldemort was younger, before he went mad from making the…” she trailed off, glancing uncomfortably at Malfoy. They had decided not to tell anyone about the Horcruxes. As far as the three were concerned, the less people knew about them, the less likely they’d be to create them. Harry nodded at Hermione, indicating he understood. She continued. “Anyway, before he went properly dark, he wasn’t trying to kill muggleborns.”
“Itty bitty Potter, come to claim my family home?” she cried in a mocking voice. “I won’t have it.”
Harry snorted. “Full of observations today, aren’t you?” He shifted the baby in his arms, feeling pins and needles in his shoulder. “This is Teddy Lupin. I guess he’s your cousin.”
Proudfoot spoke up. “We could definitely pull off a sting, but it would take longer. We’d have to keep Potter’s employment with the Aurors away from public knowledge. Ideally, he’d move back in to his old house and draw them out by walking around visibly unprotected in muggle streets. I don’t know how long it would take before they attempt to jump him, but it would definitely be quite a few weeks. They’d suspect a trap. We would have to be hiding in bushes for months.”
At Harry’s raised eyebrow, he shrugged. “I won’t believe it until I see a corpse.”
“What’s the Old Council?” Harry asked. “Neville mentioned something about the Old Crowd. Is that the same thing?”
“I hope you know that I am sorry – so much so that I cannot express in words – and I hope you know that I will spend the rest of my borrowed time on earth to try to make up for my past. But know, also, that I know I don’t deserve your forgiveness, and I do not deserve kindness. I was going to make a Wizard’s Oath, promising as much, but definitions of ‘good’ can be misinterpreted by magic and I don’t want to make an Oath that is wrong. Instead,” he said, turning to an alarmed Harry before bending a knee. “I, Lord Malfoy, solemnly swear that I will spend the rest of my life, which I owe to Lord Potter, working towards the light, and avoiding the dark.”
year – it can display short messages,” she explained. “If you need to send a message, tap it with your wand and say it out loud. If you’re good at occlumency, you might be able to make a message mentally.”
he continued casting, a visible shield starting to form in front of the gate. Walking up to him, Hermione and Ron took over, chanting the protective spells while Harry reached out to the wards with his magic to strengthen them.
Malfoy scoffed. “Do you think I’d tell you if I had?” he challenged.
Ron frowned. “Are you going to move into your castle?” he asked.
Thirdly - speaking of uni, I'm really sorry it took me so long to update. I have had a bucket load of assignments to do - to be honest, I still have a lot of work to do but I wanted to procrastinate. If only research essays were as easy to write as silly fanfictions.
Harry rolled his shoulders, thinking that Malfoy probably wouldn’t like to hear that he downed two whole bottles ten minutes earlier. Instead he took a sip of his coffee, and said wryly, “I do have a two-month old.”
They made the slow descent in the lift towards the atrium in silence. Bracing himself, Harry stepped through the doors with more confidence than he’d had earlier. The crowd seemed to sense it, too, as they all parted for him without him having to say anything. Nodding his thanks, he strode with confidence to the grate. Realising a lot of people were listening, he didn’t want them to know where he was going. He grabbed Hermione and Ron’s elbows, prayed to Merlin that his plan would work, and stepped into the flames, screaming ‘The Burrow’ in his mind.
“Ah yes, I can imagine caring for a baby has been quite a challenge. You’re so young, Harry. Are you sure you don’t want to put Teddy in someone else’s care? I’m sure we can find someone suitable,” Kingsley said lightly.
“That’s alright, then,” Ginny said firmly. “You’re still you. The moment it feels good, you come to me, okay?”
Proudfoot, Savage and Elfie nodded in agreement.
Harry, making sure to keep his back straight, leant over Malfoy’s hand. His lips were so close to them, he could also taste the vanilla and sandalwood hand cream he had seen the man use at his kitchen table.
Harry carefully schooled his expression so that he could have time to think. It was fundamentally wrong what he was being asked to do, and it was an incredibly low blow for Kingsley to use Remus and Teddy as an excuse to manipulate him into breaking the law. But, he also wasn’t wrong. Fenrir Greyback was the foulest, evilest person – no, thing – Harry had ever encountered, apart from maybe Voldemort and the information the werewolf had could make the 6% that continued to echo in the back of Harry’s mind significantly less. He had killed Voldemort. Why should he allow Greyback to continue to hurt innocents?
“Really?” Harry asked, surprised. “I kind of got angry at them.”
“Crucio!”
Ron smirked. “’Course it did. I reckon I’m a pretty good ward-caster.”
Harry raised his eyebrow, wondering where she was going with this. “We can agree to disagree on that, but what does this have to do with life debts?”
“I just need a few minutes,” he said quietly in the vague direction of the living room. Scooping Teddy up, he walked in silence to the nursery.
Elfie answered. “It depends who we get and who we don’t. If we get a Lestrange, the other would be very volatile and wouldn’t wait around to lick his wounds. He’d aim for a public attack with the aim of bringing a lot of people down with him. To a lesser extent it’d be the same with Crabbe and Goyle. It’ll be easy to take them down if they’re angry, but a lot of potentially innocent victims.”
“Never again,” Hermione said to Harry. “Can you promise me that?”
Hermione shrugged. “I think you should have people honour them. Formally. I’ll have to do some research, but I’m sure it can be mostly symbolic. The people need to see that you respect the Old Ways, and they will too.”
Malfoy cleared his throat, bringing Harry out of his thoughts. “Right. When I’m done speaking, you’ll need to respond very carefully with ‘Lord Malfoy, I accept your offer of service to repay your three life debts. You may teach me the ways of the Old. So, mote it be.’ You have to be really specific. Otherwise, we could accidentally end up married or something horrible like that.”
Hermione frowned and said quietly, “Harry’s never had any family before.”
Malfoy didn’t hesitate. “You’ll have to earn the privilege, Potter,” he smirked, his tone haughty.
Malfoy sniffed, looking appalled. “Honestly, Potter. How do you live like this?” Retrieving his wand from the sleeve of his robe, he flourished it rather dramatically. Suddenly, the curtains parted, dust flew up from the rug and the room started to smell faintly of jasmine. At Harry’s look of amazement, Malfoy sighed. “I’ll teach you the household charms later.”
“Hermione,” he hissed. “Why’d you bring that?”
James smiled. “You’d best finish your tour of the house, Harry. We’re not going anywhere,” he said self-deprecatingly. Harry blinked and realised for the first time in his life, his three father-figures literally couldn’t go anywhere.
Hermione nodded. “Why did they make it so gloomy?” she asked.
“Yeah,” he said. He scooped Teddy from Ginny’s arms.
The elf had the decency to blush but lifted her chin defiantly. “I’m sorry for your loss, Master Malfoy.”
“Grannuff, sir,” the goblin supplied for him.
Neville himself had written with an invitation to Harry, Ron, Hermione, Luna, Ginny, Dean, Seamus and, notably, Malfoy, for drinks at a muggle pub local to him. He had included a brief explanation in Harry’s, saying that his grandmother had heard from Narcissa what Malfoy and Harry were attempting to do and that she was thrilled. Apparently, all of the ‘Old Crowd’ was. Harry had no idea who that was, but Harry was pleased that Malfoy was invited too. Harry penned a quick acceptance back, asking if it was alright if George came too, thinking it’d be good for him to get out for a bit.
Bellatrix pouted. “Several, but none that I can access. I thought I might be able to go between them, like a normal portrait, but it seems that the horcrux is contained to this frame.”
“Thank you, Draco,” Hermione smiled. “And Harry, stop frowning. The wind will change.” Most of the purebloods looked confused, but Luna just nodded seriously. Harry tried to de-crease his brow. Hermione continued, “I know that we haven’t really decided what we’re doing yet, but we’re an inch away from staging a coup. We will have to tell each other confidential and potentially dangerous information. We need protection. This contract simply ensures that if you decide to betray us, you’ll suddenly find yourself unable to do so.”
They sat in comfortable silence for a bit, before Harry sighed. “I’m worried about Malfoy.”
“Do they have any safe houses?” Ron asked. He glanced at Harry when Greyback didn’t respond.
“Good to see you again, Potter,” Pengfei Proudfood said as he shook his hand.
Kreacher blinked. “Yes Master.”
Savage cast a location spell. “Yep perfect. Just of the A382. The warehouse should be about half a mile north-east.”
Harry frowned. What was his most powerful language? The only language he really knew was English, but he could also speak parseltongue. He sighed. “Ron, can you think of a snake?” he asked.
“I have no idea, but it sounded good. Maybe we make pranks that look like crowns but then turn into arseholes if you’re being a dickhead?” he suggested, turning to Ron, launching into a heated conversation about products and target markets and marketable items.
Malfoy shrugged. “I was at St. Mungo’s, dropping off some bloodwork. Someone cursed me.” At Harry’s look, Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Potter, you were the only person in the Wizengamot willing to pardon me. Many people want me dead.”
“If the memory charm is activated, you’ll forget everything from the moment you walked in this room. Everything, not just things to do with Potter and his trigger-happy wand,” Draco said plainly. “This is a serious commitment. If you do not wish to sign, please leave.”
“What wrong with her?” Harry asked, trying not to sound too indelicate.
A few hours later, Harry was attempting to bathe his godson. Teddy cried every time he got his hair wet, but Harry had discovered a spell in one of Mrs. Weasley’s old books that died babies instantly. Bracing himself for the tears, he scooped up a bit of water to dribble onto the shock of bright blue hair but faltered when he heard Kreacher’s voice.
Savage rolled her eyes. “Honestly, the way you talk about Cragg’s magic is way too similar to the way a fifteen-year-old talks about his first blowjob. It makes everybody uncomfortable.”
Harry nodded, understanding (kind of). “Right. Okay, so who else is in my house?”
“Ah, Harry. Thank you for coming. Well done for passing Robards’ test. He was rather impressed with you. How was your first day?” Kingsley asked as Harry entered his office.
Hermione tried not to look too pleased. “Anyway, Harry, you are the leader of the Wizarding World now. If we want to make changes, we have to start at the top. That’s you.”
Harry found eighteen eyes staring accusingly at him. He scratched the back of his neck. “Erm, technically, yes.”
“Ooft,” Savage laughed. “That’s not going to make her very popular with Teddy when he’s older.”
Ron nodded at this. “We used to celebrate Midsomer Midwinter, Samhain and Beltane in secret.”
Narcissa smiled weakly and lowered herself into an armchair. “Please, my lord, call me Narcissa.”
“Good luck with that,” Elfie laughed. “My Kevin hasn’t even opened one of his textbooks in preparation for his OWLs.”
The wizard arched an eyebrow but nodded once.
Malfoy shrugged. “At the next meeting of the Sacred Twenty-Eight, I imagine the families will change their allegiance to another House. Probably to yours.”
“Oh?” Harry said raising an eyebrow. “You think I was thrilled to be called in about the interrogations?” he asked sardonically. Malfoy’s sarcasm was clearly rubbing off on him.
Harry nodded, grimacing. “I’m kind of rubbish, actually, but I remembered the spell Snape used on you back in sixth year…” he trailed off. He didn’t know how Malfoy would react to the time Harry almost killed him.
“Excuse me,” Hermione interjected. “I’m right here. Ron’s not my keeper.”
Eeep! It's my favourite part of any D/H story - last names to first names. Hope you guys enjoyed!
Harry shuddered, thinking of his parents. “Yeah, me too.”
You were only trying to defend yourself.”
“Oh Harry,” Hermione said, sounding pleased. “The house has finally accepted you as Lord!”
Harry raised an eyebrow when Ron agreed. “Maybe I need to find someone to share a bed with,” he said slyly. “Although, they’d probably rather not wake up every four hours to feed Teddy.”
Robards nodded. “Goyle and Crabbe are lackeys. The Lestrange brothers aren’t much brighter. Avery or Jugson are the obvious choices.”
Ginny looked at him, curiously. “Did it feel good?”
“Good. And remember, you’re never to punish yourself if you make a mistake, okay?” At Kreacher’s nod. Harry smiled. “You can go to the Malfoy’s now. Malfoy will need your help to pack. Thank you, Kreacher, for everything you’ve done for us. You’ve been a fantastic house elf.”
The tension in the room eased slightly, but Malfoy still looked as uncomfortable as Harry felt. “I didn’t mean to call on the life debt magic,” he said.
Kai steered them into the cafeteria and indicated to a large table. As they sat down, a plate of sandwiches floated over with two jugs of pumpkin juice. Proudfoot helped himself to two, eating quickly.
The elves left only after he’d finished the sandwiches and after several promises that Harry would attempt to sleep for more than five hours. Roslyn passed him a few small bottle of dreamless sleep before she cracked away.
Harry blinked in surprise. Neither had mentioned anything about paperwork to him. He frowned when Hermione placed a small vial on the table.
Malfoy paled a touch and nodded. He was silent a bit longer, but then said quietly, “Thank you.”
“Greyback,” Harry nodded coolly, pushing off the wall.
“Not if we fix them before they realise he’s missing,” Ron countered.
Ron laughed, kissing her on the cheek. “Well, there is now.”
“No,” Harry said immediately. “It made me feel sick.”
Harry frowned. Since when had Kingsley be concerned with image? Figuring that he got his way, he decided not to push it. “Well, I have to get to Hogwarts to help with the rebuilding. Thank you for meeting with me, Kingsley.”
Harry nodded back at him. “Pleasure to meet you, sir.”
Harry sighed. He might have accepted his place as Head of the Black family, but he would never be okay with the family motto. He closed his eyes and willed the painting to burn. When he opened them again, Walburga’s portrait was no more, and a pile of ash was in its place. With a flick of his hand, it vanished.
Ron nodded. “If you’ll have us,” he said nonchalantly, as if he hadn’t just offered Harry the solution to all of his problems. “Hermione wants to track down her parents in the Christmas holidays though.”
“The British ministry hasn’t had a proper peace-time in over two hundred years,” Bill explained. “I guess they thought this 1940s depressing colour palate was reflective of that.”
Harry shuddered. “That’s horrible, Hokka,” he said, remembering how Dobby had been treated by the Malfoys.
Harry raised an eyebrow. “Everything alright?”
Harry nodded slowly. “Bellatrix said something similar last night. But she kept saying the word ‘vassal’ – whatever that means.”
Ron nodded. “George asked me to go to the flat and pack it all up. He’s going to move back in there with Lee, but doesn’t want all the reminders, you know?” He glanced down at his toast, furiously blinking.
“I don’t know, my lord,” she said in a rushed voice from her kneeled position. “The Dark Lord told me about them when we were still at Hogwarts. He loved me. I loved him. He made his diary and I made this portrait on the same evening.” Tears pooled in her painted glassy eyes. “He promised me that it was just for us. That we were the only ones who knew.”

Thank you so much for the lovely comments! Have a great day, everybody :)
Malfoy frowned. “I’m not sure. I doubt it. By the end, the Dark Lord didn’t practice much. He was a psychopath. He forgot what he was fighting for.”
“It used to be more red. Your head’s nearly blindingly golden, and your left side is a bit darker,” she said.
Hermione took Harry by the arm and led them to a stone path that led up to the gatehouse. By the large stone archway next to the gate, three nicely-dressed elves stood to attention.
Robards nodded once at Harry’s challenge and began casting silently. They duelled silently for a while, both breaking out into a light sweat by the time Robards managed to expel Harry’s wand. The man smirked. Harry frowned but quickly cast a wandless and wordless revulsion jinx. Robards dropped his wand. He laughed in surprise, but summoned it back, and continued to send hexes and jinxes at Harry. Harry grinned fully now, and decided not to summon back his own wand, instead deciding to practice his wandless magic. He’d practised a lot right after the Battle whenever Teddy was asleep and didn’t need him. It took his mind off things. To be honest, Harry almost felt more comfortable casting wandlessly than with the Elder Wand.
Reaching out for the magic like he had at Hogwarts earlier today, he drew a circle in the air with his wand. “
Kingsley looked at Harry with scrutiny. “How will you get him out?”
Harry frowned. “How do I make it give someone good luck?”
“I can destroy them now, if you want,” Bill had said.
“For how long?” Robards asked.
Draco smiled. “I have to,” he said pointedly. He gestured towards the muggle pub. “Are you ready?”
George pulled him aside after they’d eaten. “I want in,” he said.
Kreacher nodded enthusiastically. “Oh yes, Master Harry. Kreacher is taking care of Master Regulus and Master Sirius when they is babies,” he croaked.
Harry frowned. “Legilimency?”
Seamus and Dean had written with an invitation to their engagement party. Harry was thrilled for them. A lot of people had been getting married recently, Harry supposed the war had made everyone realise just how short life was. Ron, Harry and Neville were to be their best men.
As Harry fell into bed that night, he forgot to uncork the bottle of Dreamless Sleep on his bedside table for the first time since the Battle.
Ron snorted. “Understatement of the century. You’re like a niffler in Gringotts when it comes to dark magic.”
Savage had a large cut just beneath her hairline and blood was dripping down the side of her face. “Took a
“Thanks, Kreacher,” Harry said, gathering the bundle of towels that was his godson once they were finished. “Could you get me a bottle, please?”
After lunch, the five of them made their way to the Auror changing rooms, where Cragg and Robards were talking quietly between themselves.
Teddy gurgled in his arms and, as he took his seat in an old armchair, he bounced the baby with his knee.
“Hmm?” Harry said after a minute. Hermione was clicking her fingers in front of his face.
When he opened his eyes, they were standing in front of Bellatrix’s portrait in Grimmauld Place’s basement. The portrait swung open without asking questions but she raised an eyebrow when she saw their prisoner.
Ron rolled his eyes, but did so anyway, lowering his mental walls that Harry had made him and Hermione build up relentlessly after the battle. “I hate it when you do this,” he complained.
Ron shook his head. “Not us, Bill,” he explained. “He apprenticed at the ministry for five years as a ward keeper before working for Gringotts. He knows the wards like the back of his hand.”
“Coffee, then,” Ginny said, stretching as she stood up and made her way over to the kitchen. “Where are my brothers, then?”
Mr. Weasley read the paper interestedly. “Greyback’s dead,” he told them. “Apparently he killed himself after writing out a full confession.”
“You mean it’s whiskey that has the potential of tasting like earwax or disappointment?” Draco asked. “Brilliant business idea, but no thank you.”
Harry cast to reveal the existing wards. The magic surrounding the Black family home lived up to its name, appearing like a large shadow in Harry’s mind. Notably, there were a lot of bright parts to, which Harry assumed were the holes in the protective shield. Pricking his thumb with a needle, Harry allowed seven drops of blood to land on the doorstep. “
seven times before Harry finishes the spell,” she said to Ron as she kissed him goodbye.
Harry decided not to comment. Instead, he continued, “I’m not particularly fond of the idea of bleeding once a week to keep the wards strong, either. I was just wondering if there were any other wards you knew about for protection.”
Harry was taken aback. “Luna and Xenophilius? But- “Harry trailed off. He didn’t want to mention the whole imprisoning of Luna thing.
Ron paused before taking him, eyeing his best mate carefully. Harry raised an eyebrow until Ron nodded and took Teddy. At the door he turned and said quietly, “Careful.”
“That’s a brilliant idea,” George said thoughtfully. “The wizarding world hasn’t really got any commercial baby products – most people just use the home recipes, or muggle stuff. I’d bet there’s a real market for it.” He looked at Ron, smiling slightly.
Ron shrugged. “You should see a shoey, mate,” he laughed in the same horrible accent as before, smacking Malfoy on the back.
Harry shrugged, looking at them. “I like them. Anyway, I’d best be off. I’m worried that if I leave Ron alone with Teddy too long, he’ll run away and secretly adopt him.”
A young Sirius elbowed James out of the way. “Prongslet! And Moonslet!” he cried excitedly. “Look, Moony, it’s your sprog!”
Harry nodded. He summoned another piece of parchment. “Write down the addresses.”
Malfoy’s seat at the dining table was empty when they returned, a note in its place.
“Ow, Ron,” Hermione laughed as Ron stepped on her foot, again. Their playful argument dragged Harry from his thoughts.
The seven gathered around a conjured desk in the centre of the room as Cragg spread out the blueprint.
Harry blew out a breath of relief. He’d rather that no one was in the house for what he was about to do next, especially Kreacher. Taking large strides, he made his way to the large, dusty curtains that hung over the foul portrait of Walburga Black. Taking a deep breath, he willed the various charms on the portrait to break and flung open the curtains.
“Advisors?” Ron supplied helpfully from the floor where he was playing peek-a-boo with Teddy.
George gasped. “You mock me, oh King of Wizarding Britain!” he cried. “Have you ever known me to make a product that was that simple? Watch this,” he said proudly, shoving it into Harry’s mouth.
The reporters took a few more photos and asked a few more questions, but, after it became clear that Harry was not going to give them anything else, rather guiltily filed out of the building.
“What’s wrong, Harry?” Hermione looked concerned. “Is it your scar?” she asked worriedly.
Ron squeezed her hand. “We’ll find them.” Hermione nodded absently.
Hokka shrugged and moved his hands and fingers in a strange manner. Roslyn looked exasperated at him, but translated, “You are already exceeding his expectations.”
Harry sighed, but nodded wearily. “Did he say what we’ll be doing?”
Harry shook his head. “Just tell me what they are and what they do first, if you can.” He couldn’t help but think some of them might come in useful later down the track.
“Come in, Malfoy,” he said, revealing the castle that he was about to call home.
Harry blinked. He had not thought those were going to be the next words out of Malfoy’s mouth – he’d imagined it was going to be more along the lines of ‘Fuck off, Potter.’ He shrugged. “I have no idea,” he answered truthfully.
Seeing his expression, Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Relax, Potter, I’m not about to criticise your dead family members for being gay,” he drawled. “Besides, it’d be awfully hypocritical of me,” he added as an afterthought.
“No,” Kreacher said. “Master Malfoy is thanking Master but is saying it is under control.”
Robards sighed and grabbed the wand. “
Kreacher nodded enthusiastically and popped away to fix it up. Harry walked slowly to the nursery, vaguely humming the tune of a lullaby that he had been forced to sing in his primary school choir.
To his surprise, Malfoy answered. “People just say ‘cheers’, from memory. Sometimes people offer some of their drink to their ancestors, by pouring a small amount into something natural nearby. Like a plant, a flowerpot, fire, or something.”
Kreacher nodded eagerly. “Kreacher is coming to Master Harry if Kreacher is hurt.”
“Alright,” Malfoy said wearily. “How do I ‘shotgun’ this?” he asked, picking up a can wearily.
Ron slapped Malfoy on the back, before collecting Teddy from his arms. “Harry’s just trying to get out of having fun for once.”
“Yeah, it was weird,” Harry said. “It was like lots of little threads knitted together. But there are a lot of stitches missing.”
Suddenly, several white masks appeared out of the darkness. The Death Eaters appeared from the shadows, converging on the aurors. Three on Three. Where were the rest of them?
Ron closed his eyes and muttered, “M
“You can remove the extra band,” Malfoy said. Harry put it back in the box.
Harry frowned. “I don’t know. I felt the wards shift, and then he was at the door. He looked surprised to see me though. I don’t think he knew I lived here. Before I could ask, he collapsed.”
“Really?” Mrs. Weasley asked. “I thought Kingsley was worried he’d walk free. Why on earth would he kill himself?”
“You want to be bait?” Kingsley asked, frowning.
“Reducto,” Harry roared. The curse blew the wall to smithereens and then continued on to blow a three-foot hole in the ceiling, showering Crabbe with chunks of plaster. Jugson took the opportunity to send another AK in Harry’s direction, who summoned a chunk of the broken wall into the path of the curse. As it exploded, Harry charged forward, shield raised.
“Do you think it’d be good for her if she moved in here?” Harry asked in a rush. “It’s just because, well, Hermione, Ron and I are moving into the manor, and you mentioned you’re in a safe house. And technically this is your mum’s home. Also, I’m worried that Kreacher will go mental if he’s not serving anybody…” Harry trailed off, realising he’d been rambling.
“Right. Okay. Good.” He rubbed a hand over his scar.
Ron blushed. “I wondered the same thing,” he muttered. “Come on, Ginny, I’ll buy you a muggle whiskey. Luna?”
Ginny wrinkled her nose. “It better be better than the last time I tried it.”
“Merlin’s baggy pants, Potter,” Robards growled. “If you wanted to avoid the crowds, just ask to be keyed in next time. Just because you can break protective wards doesn’t mean you should.”
Harry sighed. “You,” he said, pointing to Hermione, “are especially not going to like this.” The witch was nearly fanatical when it came to rules, and Harry was about to break several. He gestured for them to sit.
“We all were. You didn’t try to kill the leader of the light side,” Malfoy said darkly. He cleared his throat. “Did I hear something about a hangover cure?” he asked brightly, attempting to change the subject. “I should really be getting back to mother.”
Harry let out a breath he hadn’t been aware that he was holding. “Why will this be a war council?” he asked, not directly acknowledging Draco’s – albeit accurate – aspersions.
“Can Kreacher assist Master?” the elderly elf asked. He had become much more amenable in the past year, but he’d never offered outright to help Harry with something before.
They found Bill upstairs in the library.
Harry frowned. “Why in secret?”
Harry nodded. The Dursley’s. “Good to know how much I am worth,” he muttered. Addressing the goblin, he asked, “How many people have access to these accounts now?”
Harry rolled his eyes and immobilised him before the werewolf could say anything further. He grabbed the man by his shoulder and Ron took his other side. “See you later,” he called to Bill and Hermione. “You’ll have about two minutes to fix the wards before the alarm sounds. Good luck.” Harry closed his eyes and pictured the dungeons in Grimmauld Place and tapped the ring on his right hand with his wand. Harry felt a familiar tug in his stomach and then a piercing headache as he tore through the wards of the Ministry of Magic.
Hermione nodded. “The brewing process is fascinating – nothing like muggle wine,” she commented.
“Yeah, well, I don’t want to get away with anything,” Harry said. “I just want to live a fucking normal life.”
Harry breathed in sharply. “An unbreakable?” Malfoy nodded. Harry sighed. “What is with Snape and unbreakable vows?”
“Thanks Bill,” Harry said, relieved. “We’ll join you in a moment.”
The Potter gem was, rather predictably a large ruby. Harry held it in his palm for a touch longer than the others, wondering if his dad had ever worn it. Placing it on his finger, the ring warmed again, letting off a bright light as the four gems settled on the band.
Ron wrinkled his nose. “My grandmother. She’s alright but we don’t see her that often – her and mum don’t get along that well. And she smells like cat food.”
Mrs. Weasley smiled. “A pleasure as always. Ron and Hermione are visiting George with him.” George hadn’t left his room since the battle, despite Mrs. Weasley’s attempts. “Are you hungry? I have to say you’re still looking a bit peaky.”
“It seems quite unbelievable, doesn’t it?” Elfie smiled at Harry’s grimace. “I’d like to clarify, I do not read that magazine. I simply listen when other people are gossiping.” She raised a thin eyebrow. “There is nothing in this world that is more important than knowing what and whom people gossip about.”
“I shouldn’t have been prepared,” Harry said. “Does it muck everything up now that they know what I’m doing?”
The four of them made their way to the door. “See you later, Potter,” Proudfoot said. “Good luck with the Minister. We owe you a drink.”
; ultimately, they always fought
Harry sighed. “I do, but I don’t know of any other protective charms. Kingsley was worried. I have to agree with him. It feels weird to say, but I trust Malfoy. I just don’t know how many more people Snape told about this place. I don’t mind one death eater popping up on my doorstep, but I’d rather not have any more surprises. Especially with Teddy living here.” He started cutting up his potatoes but made no move to eat them. “I’ve told Kingsley that I won’t do it long-term. He said he’d research some other options, but…” he trailed off, looking hopefully at Hermione.
“If we don’t start acknowledging the Old Ways now, we will either get dragged into another war, or a whole culture will disappear. I’m not okay with that,” Hermione said with determination.
Harry willed her to be quiet. The elderly woman closed her mouth with surprise. “I am Harry Potter, Lord of the Ancient and Most Noble Houses of Black, Gaunt, Peverell and Potter. I need you to answer some questions,” he said, trying to remain calm.
“Almost as inspiring as Henry V, Potter,” a voice drawled from the doorway. Everybody swivelled to look at Draco, no doubt with warring expressions of acceptance and distrust. Draco took it in stride, though, quietly coming to Harry’s left and placing two pints on the table. He took a deep breath. “Thank you for inviting me, Heir Longbottom,” he said formally.
Harry blocked it easily and sent one back with a glance. “Now!” he said to the others. He heard shouts of other spells and duels behind him as they engaged in battle. The air was soon thick with spells, and Harry soon found himself duelling with both Crabbe and Jugson.
Ron hesitated, but eventually said, “I don’t want to do it either. I’m really excited about working with George.” He looked at Hermione, “You don’t mind, do you? I mean, being an Auror is a proper job. Not like working in a shop.”
Malfoy sighed. “My family lost most of our assets. My mother and I are living off the Lovegood’s.”
. “Excellent, Madame Malkin and her assistants should be here any second,” he drawled, glancing Harry up and down. “They’ve got their work cut out for them.”
“Indeed, it is,” George grinned, dropping a small object into Harry’s palm.
Harry blinked, taken aback. “My normal wand?”
“Never,” Harry said stubbornly.
Bill nodded gravely. “Harry’s wand can’t be traced by the ministry. Kingsley wants him to break him.” He ran a hand through his hair tiredly. “I can’t say I’m not surprised. I guess I thought more of Kingsley. He was a Slytherin, though,” he mused. “Not that that means he’s evil, necessarily,” he added at Hermione’s face. “Just that he’s ambitious. As for Greyback: I don’t want that bastard to walk free. I know she’d never say so, but I can tell Fleur hates him for what he did to my face.” Bill turned to Harry. “What do you need from me?”
This is bit of a filler chapter but I promise things will happen soon.
Malfoy laughed. It was the sound of honey again. “Honestly, Potter. It’s truly a wonder you paid enough attention to the Dark Lord in order to defeat him,” he drawled. He chucked a can at Harry. “It’s your turn.”
Harry shrugged. “It was fun at the beginning.”
“Yes, I think I might be familiar with the dangers of the public when yours is a household name,” Draco said wryly. Harry realised he probably didn’t want to go out in wizarding London either, after what had happened on Friday. “I shall meet you outside Angel station.”
Without waiting for them to react, Harry drew his wand at began working on the wards. He didn’t have much knowledge of this kind of technical magic, but Hermione had done a lot of research and explained it in detail to him.
Malfoy walked slowly towards Hermione and held out his hand and he bowed, almost kissing her fingertips. “Weasley, Potter, notice that I’m bowing from my hips. My head, neck and back are all in a straight line. It’s not a dramatic bow, either, just a shallow one. Think of it as having your eyes at their breast.”
“You’re welcome, Lord Malfoy,” Harry smiled. “Now, onto other business,” he said, folding the sheet of paper with his new family’s names carefully before putting it in his pocket.
“Well, a ‘vassal’ in muggle English is used to refer to a subordinate in a feudal system. I suppose that makes sense, since the last references to people invoking the right of conquest seems that I’ve seen date back to the Middle Ages,” Hermione said, throwing a hairbrush at him. Harry rolled his eyes- they both knew it would do nothing. “But no-one’s used it in centuries – how will it help us find the Lestranges?”
“Harry,” Hermione’s familiar voice admonished.
,” he said quietly. A ball of light lit up the dark room at the tip of the wand, but it was a much bigger light than he’d ever made before.
Malfoy rolled his, catching onto his way of thinking. “No. Well, yes, but incredibly far back. A Potter-Weasley match hasn’t occurred in over four centuries. Cedrella was née Black. Your relationship with Weaslette is safe.”
Harry nodded. He decided not to mention that he’d never technically passed the test.
16-year-old Remus smiled at Harry, his eyes watering. “Hullo Harry, Teddy,” he said softly.
Malfoy laughed. “That’s true. Cheers to us,” he said, clinking his glass with Harry’s. “Salut!”
“I think that’s highly sensible. Harry, I appreciate this, but I am not touching a burial shroud. That’s sacrilegious.”
Harry sucked in a breath. “I didn’t know their parents died. Colin was- “he choked slightly on the memories. “Too young.”
Cragg slapped him on the back. “You probably won’t need it, but that vest is laced with protective spells. An AK can still get through, and a few seriously powerful dark spells, but it should save you from the worst of the damage of other spells. Fair warning: it still hurts like a bitch if you get a
“You telling me what to do is of service to me,” Harry said quietly.
“Doing Nazi shit,” Ginny added helpfully.
“Yeah, well,” Harry said, feeling a bit awkward. “I’m used to it.”
“I’m going with him,” Hermione said, correctly interpreting Harry’s concerned face. “We’ll do it together.”
Hermione looked at Harry questioningly. “What if he was to repay you by teaching you the Old Ways?”
“Write down the names of every person you have killed,” Harry said again. This time he was quick to obey.
Robards nodded, but Hermione coughed. “No, Harry, you need to go back down. If they don’t see you leave, they’ll stay all day and interfere with the people who work here,” she said.
Harry reached for it hungrily, searching the list for the house he’d wanted to visit more than anything in his life. He breathed out. There it was – the Potter Manor. Where his dad had been raised. Where Sirius had run away to when he was sixteen. Where his grandparents had lived. His home. “Thank you,” he said softly.
“According to tradition, a Lord’s vassal must obey and serve their master, and follow them into battle. If their Lord is defeated, they become the vassal of the victor,” Bellatrix said matter-of-factly, almost sounding bored. “They must either swear allegiance to their new Lord or be disposed of in a manner of which the Lord sees fit.”
“Well, Potter,” Proudfoot drawled, smirking. “Who knew you to be such a utilitarian?”
Harry frowned. “So, even though you don’t like each other, you still have to get married?”
They trio made to leave, but Malfoy stopped Harry at the last minute. “Thank you, Potter. I think you might have just agreed to save the Wizarding World again.”
Harry frowned. “I’m not sure.”
“Ron,” Harry said quickly, and grabbed him by the elbow, dragging him away from the others. “Blood on your collar. Go and get changed.”
Walburga nodded aristocratically. “Take care of my home. It is yours now, my Lord,” she said, and this time her deferential nod was genuine. “Will you destroy my portrait, please?”
Kingsley nodded, pleased. “I’d like to discuss with you your plans for the upcoming year,” he said, moving on to business.
Bellatrix Lestrange, but also
Malfoy wasn’t looking at him. “Good, Potter. Weasley, back straight.”  Harry rose, trying not to feel too pleased about the praise. Harry raised his left hand without waiting for Malfoy to tell him. “Good, Potter,” Malfoy muttered, clearly surprised.
“What the hell was that?” Ron asked.
“How did it go, Harry?” Ginny asked curiously.
Harry hadn’t known. He frowned, “but what about Parkinson?”
For Hermione, Ron, and, Harry supposed, Teddy, they landed in a beautiful, if slightly overgrown, field, facing a mound of grass and the outline of a long since dried-up moat.
Harry reached for his glasses on the bedside table and frowned apologetically as he ended the spell. “Sorry, ‘mione,” he winced, watching as the witch gracefully stepped from the ropes that had been holding her to the wall.
Luna smiled. “Not too bad. You’ve been busy,” she noted. “Your aura’s changed.”
over himself and the painting.
Malfoy merely looked surprised. “You remember?”
“Hey,” Harry said quietly when Malfoy appeared. He did not look well – he seemed even paler than usual and had large dark circles under his eyes. “How are you?”
“How do you know that?” Harry asked curiously. “Have you been to India?”
Kai clapped him on the back. “Well, they know now in either case,” he said and led the group down the stairs.
He cleared his throat. “I’ll take him back to the Ministry with Bill.”
Harry’s cheeks lit up. He’d only been trying to impress Malfoy and he didn’t have any wine in the house. Malfoy didn’t strike Harry as a beer person.
“Fine. At the very least have him make a Wizard’s Oath,” Hermione said. “It doesn’t have any consequences for him, but we’d feel it if he broke it. We’d have time to…” She trailed off.
, the Hermione-like voice sounded in his mind.
“Won’t be fun for the death eater, either,” Ron muttered. “Dad told me about the interrogations. It sounds awful.”
Harry nodded but didn’t say anything. He didn’t know how he felt about that particular pure-blood custom.
Malfoy snorted. “No, you’re not. I’m not either. He was my father – he was suffering, now he’s not.” He shifted awkwardly under their gaze. “You were saying, Granger.”
Hermione closed her eyes and let out a whimper.
Suddenly, Hokka let out a bark of a noise. “Hokka finds you amusing,” Roslyn explained. “He lost his tongue working for his last family. Mistress Lily and Master James took him in.”
Malfoy nodded. “There’s also Iola Hitchens, whose an incredible old, yet formidable witch. She’s 146, but when the Death Eaters tried to attack her family last year, she sent four back without their tongues.”
“You really believe that?” Harry had never thought of it that way.
The Entrance Hall was very large but sparsely decorated with a richly embroidered rug, two bronze stag heads on either side of the door, and a large Gryffindor-red tapestry that featured a family tree, like the one in the Black House.
“Absolutely not,” Ginny admonished, plucking the baby from his arms. “Come on, Teddy, your godfather has to go and be a badass now.”
“Don’t be an idiot. You are my brother, Harry,” Ron said, a touch fiercely.
Harry nodded approvingly. From the amount the woman panicked, he was fairly sure she only had one horcrux, but he needed to be certain. “I will find your body. I will bring it back here, and I will keep it in the dungeon. You, this version of yourself in the painting, may live, as long as you do what I ask.”
“Fair warning, Granger: you will not be allowed to speak during the meeting. No matter what anybody says. Only the Heads can speak,” Malfoy warned. “Do you think you can keep quiet?” he asked, doubtful.
By the time Kreacher arrived with the bottle, Teddy was half asleep again. Quickly feeding him and burping him, Harry managed to place him in his crib without disturbing him too much. He gazed at the sleeping infant for a while, not wishing to leave the confines of the room just yet. Everything outside the little nursery was still reeling from the war and learning the politics of blood purity and the Old Ways was leaving Harry’s head spinning.
Hermione rolled her eyes, but everyone knew the first thing she’d do when they got home would be to research it. She pulled out several plain gold rings and dumped the blood onto them. “These work like the coins we had in 5
” he cast, and the door disappeared.
Harry paused. Ginny was the only person who he had ever told that he had had feelings for both boys and girls. In return, Harry was the first person that knew Ginny felt the same way. He blushed a little but said quietly. “Yeah, reckon he is.”
Harry summoned a few glasses and the elvish wine from the kitchen wordlessly. Hermione raised an eyebrow as he poured but said nothing.
“And you smell like whiskey,” Ginny commented helpfully.
Malfoy cleared his throat, and business resumed. Hermione, Malfoy and Grannuff discussed in detail Harry’s assets, but Harry himself found his attention wandering. Malfoy kicked him in the shin.
“You are a general, Potter,” Draco said, not unkindly. “A king, if you will. Every person in that room knows what you did and will expect that you are mobilising an army. Against whom, I’m not sure, but you inspire loyalty. Everybody in that room will follow you without question.”
They made their way back inside the house to find Kreacher at the front door, looking relieved. “Master is keeping Black house safe,” he croaked. “Kreacher is feeling the wards.”
Harry felt incredibly guilty as he made his way quickly up the stairs. He hadn’t mean to put people in danger. And a part of him, a bigger part of him that he cared to admit, was feeling guilty for disappointing Malfoy. Shaking off that unpleasant thought, he groped around in his drawer and quickly found the wand.
“I’ll have a word with the Prophet,” Harry promised. “Although I doubt they’ll actually listen to me. How many times have I told them to fuck off?”
McGonagall smiled at his readiness. “I need you to help with the wards. I will not have Hogwarts vulnerable ever again.” She turned to Harry. “Mr. Potter, I’m sorry to say this but there are quite a few reporters camped at the gate. If you wish to work inside that is fine.”
