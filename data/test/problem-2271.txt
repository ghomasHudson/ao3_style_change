The words barely reach his mind and it takes a while before he realises what Professor McGonagall had said. She thanked him.
“You don’t know anything.” Cassie spat. “Mother cheated on him. With Theo Nott. They hadn’t married out of love, but they had an agreement. Papa allowed Mother to sleep with whoever she wanted, as long as we wouldn’t find out. But Scorpius saw them, when they were on a date in Diagon. Mother broke the promise!”
Rolling his eyes, Draco nodded. “Obviously. The only reason I bear your presence is that it gets me closer to George. How have you not noticed yet?”
Ooh! Don't forget to leave a comment! If I get comments, I will be more inclined to update regularly ;-)
With a smile, Draco met her perceptive gaze and answered in a whisper: “Because they don’t want me there.”
Draco was fumbling for words again. He was incredibly angry with Neville, but for the half-Hufflepuff to do something this drastic, he must really want to talk honestly.
“Except that they might. They have infected the Auror Department, so they could get away with it. Are you going to stand by and watch them
Only after exchanging a pleading look with Scorpius, his son sat back down and Draco could breathe again. Cassie now was much paler than at the beginning of the trial, and seemed close to tears. She looked like she was on the brink of passing out. She locked eyes with Draco during Astoria’s entire testimony.
As the Potter and Malfoy children started chatting, telling him all kinds of excited stories, Cassie slowly relaxed and dared to look up again. Her smile brightened with every passing minute and her face gained some colour again.
The question that has been bothering me, is whether they are in a relationship. It may seem odd, since they were on the complete opposite sides of the War. As we all know, Mr. Potter was the one person who could kill You-Know-Who. He led the Light Side to victory and saved us all from a toxic man.
There was a bell ringing in his head, something trying to alarm him that he knew where to look. Right! One of Mr. Malfoy’s letters! He had said that papa had proposed a spell to Voldemort during the war.
Obediently handing the vial of unicorn blood, Mr. Malfoy summoned a knife – which barely missed Bill’s fingertips – and started crushing the Motherwort to extract the juice. “How much of this do you need?”
“All right. Nine o’clock, it is. Do not be late. Do not hand in some kind of pathetic excuse for a research. Do not come up with three lines of Hippogriff muck. I have high hopes for you now, James. You better not disappoint me.”
“However, the person they called for wasn’t compatible enough. Which is very rare. They needed someone with an even more compatible magical core, and the only that would be closer to Cassie’s signature, was me. They said it was a risk. Parents or family members are barely used for this spell, because the two cores, being so close in genetics as well, could link indefinitely. That has the same effect as blood bonds, and is not only dangerous, but just as illegal.”
Cassie was turning around in her bed, not able to sleep, until Draco gave her a soft peck on the forehead and created a tiny light, a replica of the light she had in her bedroom at home and at Hogwarts.
“Yes,” Potter chuckled. “You know how she is. She probably knows what we’re doing by the end of breakfast.”
When dinner’s over and Draco was relaxing in his apartment –Ophiuchus was spending time with Aquila in the Owlery, someone knocked on his door. It turned out to be Neville, carrying a good brand of Butterbeer.
Draco folded his hands together neatly to have something to do. “Why in Merlin’s name would you think that?”
Cassie smiled, knowing that she had won. “Because you are –inexplicably, may I add- pining over Harry, and I thought you might like the company of someone whose name means ‘defender of mankind’. You know, to feel like Harry is anywhere close.”
Draco was happy when his classes were over, especially those with Gryffindor House. Not only were most Gryffindors awful at Potions, but last couple of days, the Weasleys have been watching him intently. It was disconcerting.
“How do you know what they used to do?” he asked, already knowing the answer and dreading it. The look on Potter’s face said enough.
“Not particularly,” his father answered shortly. He turned sharply, facing Draco instead of the shelves. “Do you know what signal you are giving?”
Pansy rolled her eyes. “Shut up, you morons, and get in. Ask Scorp if you want some food.” She kissed Draco on the cheek before following the others, who were now in a heated debate with Ron about Potter’s supposed jealousy.
“What’s going on?” Neville asked gently, while he sat down and Draco kept standing. Draco sent him a devastating look.
“Go up the stairs. It’s the third dorm on your left. Their door is usually open, and there’s a blue lining at the top of it.”
“I’m going to sound stupid, but I’ll say it anyway,” he started. “I… Merlin, this is weird, but I actually… wouldn’t mind some… Godric, some physical contact? Like, that other night I stayed over because I had had one of the worst nightmares ever, and you held me tightly and we fell asleep like that? Yeah, that was exactly what I needed. Ehm, so that?” Potter rushed out.
“I can be creative. Ron gave me some tips on how to eavesdrop and he gave me a few of the Weasley products. There’s of course the Extendable Ear and the Extendable Nose, but also Order of the Phoenix spyware so I can sneak in and out without anyone noticing and – “
Septimius smiled a bit awkwardly before sitting down again, with Whithal right next to him. While Draco and Potter were trying to tune out everything else by fiercely staring at one another, an idea came to mind, causing Draco to smirk and raised his chin up. Potter hitched up his eyebrows in question.
“Well, I don’t exactly mind,” he said then, softly. “I miss them, and it hurts sometimes, but the date doesn’t mean much to me. It’s not like I can remember it. It might as well have been on Christmas. So the date is just something symbolic to me, and not an actual reminder of what happened.”
“No need, love, just lie down. Everyone does it here. You’re as white as a sheet. Do you sleep enough?” Molly tutted, handing both Potter and him a bowl with the left-overs from desert. Draco and Potter shared a look before they dug in the sweetness.
Rolling his eyes, Potter focussed again on Lucius and Narcissa. “But because she is this important person, is it possible to bring her down? She is Head of Mysteries, for Merlin’s sake. I’m not sure there is anything we can do to stop her.”
… They would never be able to catch her for a mistake. Assuming that Sifa Euripideia was the woman they were looking for, of course.
“What’s going on?” she asked her siblings. Phi merely shrugged, and Cassie smirked. At Draco’s confused hum, Cassie huffed a laugh.
“One Auror can’t convince the entire department to hunt whoever is attacking Draco,” Pansy persisted.
Cassie’s head shot up in worry, searching Draco’s gaze with fear in her eyes. Draco smiled calmingly – at least, he hoped he did. And judging by the way Cassie rested her chin on his shoulder again, he would think he succeeded.
So I was thinking about the time when I was pestering you, and about your collection, and I realised. Perhaps you did like me. And I started a campaign to try and find out. You must have wondered why my friends suddenly started talking to you in the hallways, or why your friends started casually mentioning me in conversations. So when I thought that there was a chance, just a small chance, that you liked me, I cut out this article and gave it to you. And so, here we are. You asked me why, and I can tell you all the reasons why I like you, but you need to do some work today. So, I would like to officially ask you out on a date. Tonight. I’ll pick you up from this office.”
Healer Brinsbridge walked into the room to check up on Aquila and – she thought Draco didn’t notice – see how Draco was coping. “She’ll be all right, you know,” she assured Draco. “There seems to be no head trauma, no health issues. We will probably start waking her up from the coma today or tomorrow. Her wounds are healing well and her bodily functions perform properly.”
Potter smiled. “Close your eyes and your ears. I don’t want you to know where we are going before it starts.”
He didn’t stop teasing his papa before Draco waved the lights off and demonstratively turned on his side.
At the same time, Molly called for them to get seated, because dinner was almost finished. Draco was squished between George and Potter, with his children scattered between the various adults, and he was having a hard time ignoring Potter’s smirks whenever George said something to him.
“No, I mean… Count them. The larger plates are for Draco, the smaller ones are for the children. How many smaller plates do you see?”
Draco nodded, giving Neville a light slap on the shoulder to thank him, as Cassie was already heaving the plant outside.
“Next lesson, you will be brewing a counterpotion. Counterpotions are difficult to brew, even if you already have instructions, which is why it is fifth year material. Don’t underestimate them: they may seem easy, but will have disastrous effects if done wrong.
needs a sort of guard, to make sure they don’t get out of their hiding place. Scorpius offered to help. To be honest, Scorp was the one to tell me that someone suffered from lycanthropy.”
When the Glamour fell off, it revealed a shabby red hoodie with a lion printed on the front. Potter’s eyes widened. “Is that…”
“You’re an okay one, for a pureblood. Neville was right about you,” he said sincerely, with his booming voice and square posture. Draco nodded uncomfortably, the overheard conversation between Alexa and Miguel still fresh in his mind.
“Everyone is, except his children. He is also not allowed to send a message to them via his other contacts, but I’m sure you will be able to tell them
The day after the Valentine’s Ball, Pansy and Blaise unexpectedly popped in to visit Draco, catching up on what happened. Draco told them about Phi’s transformation, which had them silent from shock, and Cassie’s breakdown. When Pansy told him that it wasn’t unusual for girls to become insecure during puberty, Blaise scrunched his nose and switched to wine, declaring that he needed alcohol if he was supposed to listen to puberty girls’s problems.
“So, as I said we have a tradition to go to a Muggle flea market. My plan was to go there as soon as you are all settled and just enjoy it for a bit. Probably we’ll have dinner there as well, buy something at a stall, since I guess we’ll be out till ten o’clock. Especially because I think you’d want to do some London sightseeing as well. And when we’re back, the children go to bed as soon as possible and then we can do whatever we like. You could sleep as well, or help me with the last preparations for tomorrow. Does that sound good?”
Alexa smiled at him. Miguel jovially cheered, but it didn’t reach his eyes. When Draco turned around to get his books, he sighed softly. Of course he couldn’t expect people to welcome him with open arms, and the fact that Miguel and Alexa were here was very positive, but after the last couple of days had been so pleasant, with Potter and Pansy and Blaise, Draco had forgotten that it could also be very difficult for him.
“My childhood wasn’t bad, really. In fact, I had a very happy childhood. The only problem was my teenage years. But those years were bad for every one of our age. I’m not exactly an exception.”
“Cool. Though, why do you keep that vial in your drawer? All your other potions are in the cupboards.”
“To put it bluntly, your children have showed inexcusable behaviour. Ever since they attended Hogwarts, they have bullied first-years and used violence on them. Magical as well as fists. For this, I have decided to expel them. I apologise for your inconvenience of bringing them to Hogwarts and having to pick them up just two days in.”
At the Hufflepuff table, Phi was seated, animatedly talking with the Hufflepuffs that wanted to listen, and winking broadly when he saw Draco looking at him. His eyes shone and his hair was green. If that was all Draco would see from him for the rest of his life, he would be a happy man.
“Yes. And I don’t know how well it would go if he were to be a Slytherin as well. I don’t know if my children would be able to live with two Slytherin parents. A Ravenclaw would always work well, but Cassie would appreciate a Gryffindor.” Draco wrinkled his nose. “Unfortunately, I don’t think any Gryffindor would be stupid enough to consider me.”
He had followed his father’s order. He had taken the Dark Mark. He had opened the doors for Death Eaters. He had walked up the steps to the Astronomy Tower. He had pulled his wand and sent a spell at Dumbledore. Fine, it didn’t kill the man, it merely disarmed him, but it was more than anyone should have expected of a teenager. He had done everything they had asked of him, except kill his Headmaster.
Draco swallowed. With any other person, he’d know exactly what to do: hold them, rock them, murmur soft nothings in their hair, while they either broke out in sobs, or clenched his shirt, trying to keep themselves in check, or –which happened quite often- start hitting and kicking him out of anger. But with Potter… he had no clue. It wasn’t just their petty school rivalry, it was more. Potter got under his skin like the annoying insect he was, but whenever he wasn’t trying to get in Draco’s hair, he was unsettling. It made Draco want to twitch and squirm, because he just didn’t understand the man.
“You’ve been through a war and its aftereffects, without as much as a scratch, and now, more than twenty years later, something as pathetic and small as a stupid curse will make an end of your life.”
“Spells? Charms? Potions? They can all change your behaviour and feelings towards people. Anyone could have influenced the way you act specifically towards Draco. The only thing they would have needed was a bit of Draco’s DNA.”
“I understand. And what would ‘good cause’ entail? You said the prophecy can’t be viewed without good cause according to the procedures. What situations would be that sufficient for me to see it?”
Potter saw Draco folding his hands together in the way Ophiuchus had told him meant that Draco was nervous and had to suppress a smirk.
I'm late again, I know. But this time I warned you, so I can't be blamed. Bit of a hectic weekend, but mostly fun stuff. Only fun stuff, to be honest.
For a long while, the only sounds were the beeping of the heart monitor and the bustle outside Scorpius’s room. Draco rested his head back, holding his son’s far too cold hand.
A bit later, he got another present, which turned out to be a locket with pictures of his children and parents in it. Draco squeezed Potter’s shoulder in thanks, sparing no words for something he wouldn’t even be able to verbalise.
And just like that, the door slammed closed, leaving Draco with Aquila, Cassie and Phi in the room. After a moment, they heard rocks breaking on the pavement outside of the hospital, and desperate cries of frustration, which could only come from Scorpius himself.
“Well, I don’t know,” Draco pondered. “I definitely will be odd for them, since they have never seen me in any proper relationship. Cassie might like the idea of some Gryffindors around, but at the same time, she might not appreciate the extra noise and people. And Scorpius and Albus… it would be so strange for them. Especially if Potter and I would break up after a while, they would be caught right in the middle of it all. It would put quite the strain on their friendship, and I don’t want to be blamed for that.”
“All right, everyone. You will be working in pairs today, even the Slytherins and Ravenclaws who think they can do better. For this potion, you will have to work together. You see I have given you instructions on parchment, instead of instructions in your books. I have my reasons for that, so I expect you to follow the hand-outs instead of the book. Any questions? No? Good. Start.”
He wasn’t fanciful, and he knew what the Wizarding world thought of him. His chances weren’t great. He had a few trusted friends who would definitely believe in his innocence, but the Wizengamot wouldn’t be so easily convinced. And the entire audience that would be present… He was doomed, and he knew it.
Frowning, Harry turned to face him fully. “You’re hiding something. How often do I have to tell you not to keep secrets?”
Potter’s neck clicked as he whipped his head around so quickly, Pansy was surprised it didn’t break, but she finished the string of names. “Dominique, Louis, Roxane, Molly, Lucy, Rose, Hugo.”
While Potter was shocked into silence, Draco kept popping chocolate into his mouth, until he noticed Potter’s sudden silence.
“Good. Now, the first thing we will be doing, is learning some new theory…” Draco started his first lesson.
Send headcanons about Draco! I mean, does he write? Does he play an instrument? What's his favourite colour? What does he like best about Harry? What's his weak spot? Is he ticklish? Does he have long or short hair? Does he wear a ring? What kind of ring? Does he have a weak back? What shampoo does he use? Or does he use cleaning charms only?
Students started chattering, most of it were words of surprise and sympathy. Scorpius was apparently rather well-liked in Slytherin House. Albus swallowed a couple times, before he cleared his throat and nodded.
Lily and Cassie shared a look, after which Lily stood up and asked for attention. “Dad, Draco, we want to say something. You know how much we want you to be together, and we understand that it may take time for you to give in to it. Therefore, we will not force you to answer any questions. However, we think it’s for the best if the two of you talk honestly. No chance of lying, no pretending and no hiding things. Even though you may feel you have bared your soul to one another multiple times now, we know for a fact that there are many unspoken problems between you. We have tried to get you talking about it, but it never worked. Veritaserum was our only option. Punishment is all right, as long as you talk. Please.”
“Well, with these plants, there is a significant decrease of harmful, addictive and illegal potions. It would help in the Healing sector, for example.”
Draco’s eyes shot up to his friend. Of course he remembered the promise. He only promised as much to cheer up Pansy when she was having a very difficult week. And how he regretted that promise now.
“That’s – That’s so stupidly brilliant, I can’t even insult it!” he guffawed finally. Potter laughed in response.
“I thought it was. So this room is James’s, this is Albus and Lily’s room is over there. Your guest room is right here.”
Draco exchanged a look with Doctor Selaminder, both not understanding what this had to do with the case, but at Whithal’s questioning hum, Draco turned back to him.
“It is a curse that attacks the part of someone that is worth most to them. For sportsmen, it’s their muscles. For intellectuals, it’s their brain. For others, their memories, or their sight. It’s different for everyone. However, for some people, it’s their heart. It’s very rare, but it happens. Because a heart encompasses everything; soul, memories, life, love, movement, actions. At least, symbolically, it encompasses everything. I think, and everything I feel right now, that in my case, it’s the heart.”
When the cup was empty, James and Dad looked expectantly at papa, waiting for some sign of life. Mr. Malfoy and the others had come in as well, staring from the doorway. The light still wasn’t on. The bed felt rough and unpleasant on James’s skin. The breeze from the window cooled down the hot, damp air of the room. Dad’s tears kept falling.
“In that case, I wouldn’t want to make your first year at Hogwarts boring, by telling you all the good stuff now.”
The pale, bony hand is pulling the wand towards himself, ready to fire. Ready to kill. Draco’s hand pulls as well. A sharp zing, a sound he already heard today, fills the eerie silence, just as the Dark Lord is pointing at Potter and starts his incantation. With the speed of a trained Seeker, Draco’s arm, which now holds something heavy and magical, swings.
Draco walked, with Cassie in tow, towards Narcissa and Andromeda to wish them a happy new year as well. Pansy, Blaise and Greg came up to him to thank him for his Christmas presents and to clink glasses.
And then the last one. Ophiuchus wasn’t planned —Astoria had said she never wanted more than three children—, but Draco couldn’t be happier. It truly felt like his family was complete. Phi was also very special. He was a Metamorphmagus. Unfortunately, Draco wasn’t completely sure what his natural appearance was. There were two boys in Phi. The first one was a blonde with a thin face and sharp angles, and the second a scrawny boy with a black mess that he calls hair and dark green eyes. Draco had no idea what kind of atrocities he had done to deserve a mini-Potter tumbling through his house. Or, well… Never mind.
A last grin was sent Draco’s way before Zarnel walked to the door. “Anyway, enjoy your evening!” she called, humming as she walked away from his office.
“Call me Pansy, please. We Slytherins have tried to stop calling each other by our last names,” Pansy smiled politely.
He treasured the blinding smile Cassiopeia sent his way and the loud “papa!” Ophiuchus exclaimed. Albus fidgeted with his shirt when he saw Draco. He was visibly nervous on how to act towards Draco, and how Draco would act towards him.
“Yeah sure. I only know that you can’t seem to be quiet during my lessons,” Potter shot back jokingly. “Very well then. I’ll leave you to it. Oh, Albus, come here for a sec. Where are your siblings?”
“No, Professor, there is no reason,” Potter replied shortly. Draco hid his smile and started eating.
“Good. You see, you know I don’t approve of your relationship with Mr. Potter, so what does it mean if even
Shaking his head, Draco didn’t take his eyes of Scorpius. When the door closed, they frowned at each other. Scorpius took in his papa’s clothing. “How are you feeling, papa?”
It was the only thing necessary to push Scorpius over the edge of sanity. He slammed against the ground on the spot where he had been standing, hyperventilating. When half of them were caring for Lily, and the other half for Scorpius, Albus found a moment to leave.
“But not as good as you do. The four of you will be this perfect model family, and then I run in looking like a warthog.”
“We’ve been doing that forever!” a voice sounding suspiciously like Phi’s called from another room, making Harry laugh.
Since the door was behind the teacher’s desk, Potter didn’t notice Draco standing there and continued his lesson.
Suddenly, all the thestrals in their boxes became restless, stomping and huffing. Outside, Draco heard trampling, panicked little sounds, even a shrill neigh. While Harry flinched away from the thestrals and Albus and Scorpius tutted when the thestral they were petting pulled his head away, Phi and Draco ran outside without hesitation.
“So Draco knows your preferences?” Pansy continued, sounding innocent. Draco recognised the glint in her eyes though, and warned her with an icy glare.
“Are you reading anything interesting?” Draco asked, trying to relieve some of the tension he had brought in the house.
“Everything she can achieve. She isn’t picky. Can you make sure she eats enough? She has the habit of neglecting herself when something happens.”
“I’m raising four children on my own. Yes, I like caring for people I love. And I don’t use that word often, but I hope that one day, I might find someone outside my circle of relatives, where I can say it and mean it.”
James hesitated, but nodded eventually. He wouldn’t be able to convince two stubborn Slytherins. He gave them both a tight hug and Apparated.
Blinking up at Potter, and the entire entourage of Gryffindors, with the occasional Hufflepuff – Hannah Longbottom, for example – and a rare Ravenclaw – Luna, with her husband, who was greeted very enthusiastically by Aquila, with hugs and all – following him close behind, Draco and his sons managed to be the perfect picture of innocence.
Pansy raised her eyebrows. “All right. Let’s see.” She took out an Extendable Eye – a new product of the Wheezes, since the Extendable Ear was so successful – and let it float up to Draco’s room. He was indeed staring, but rather at the window than at the ceiling. When he caught sight of the Eye, he laughed and waved them off, calling – loud enough for them to hear it downstairs – that they were idiots and he hated them.
Still, it was a fun chapter to write, though I fear it may be a bit boring. It's necessary for the rest of the story. Besides, Draco is in a cell. OF COURSE it's boring. What can one do in a cell?
Tilting his head in question, James squinted his eyes. “Yes, why aren’t you official yet? I mean, it’s pretty obvious to everyone with eyes that you like each other.”
They locked eyes for a moment, until Potter faced forward again. Draco bit his lip to suppress a smile. “They have thought about everything, haven’t they,” he stated softly, deliberately not denying the underlying question Potter asked. The result was an enormous grin.
Doctor Selaminder sighed, standing up and leaning on his desk. “Ms. Zarnel, were you the one to press charges against Mr. Malfoy?”
“Ah yes, you said something about the potion-brewing. The defense was wondering why Mr. Malfoy wasn’t allowed to take Veritaserum, if that made the case so much easier. Could you enlighten us?”
“Fifth year has two sides. You either had more important things to worry about, or you wanted some distraction and therefore allowed yourself to have a crush. Was your crush in fifth year?”
But Potter also didn’t have the same kind of scrutiny as Draco did. He didn’t have to watch his every move and every word like Draco did. Because Draco had been on the wrong side of the war. Draco had tortured people, and indirectly killed them. Potter had also killed people, but only in defense of others. He had killed the man Draco shouldn’t have sworn allegiance to. Potter had done the right thing. So for him, it wouldn’t be much of a problem what the papers said.
At Potter’s curious look, Albus shrugged. “It’s just that Mr. Malfoy is very complimentary about him, and Neville said that he was a bully, but he could understand where Severus was coming from.”
Blaise scoffed. “He would have been safer in the Ministry cells. This wouldn’t have happened there.”
Actually, I'm not sorry because I had fun, last couple of days, even with the writing stress. And all your comments were amazing, my mailbox actually crashed at a certain point because I've never had this much mail in one day.
Reluctantly, Draco waited for his daughter. When she had caught up, they walked towards Draco’s apartment together. Cassie stayed quiet, gathering the right words to say. At long last, she stood still in front of the door and stopped Draco from going inside.
One!! person guessed the right country! I will contact that person to ask whether they have any wishes for a scene between Harry and Draco, or some kind of other tiny thing, as a price for guessing it correctly.
“For example, if it turns out you have taught them the ways of your former affiliations, there is a pattern. If any of them are in touch with the wrong people, your fate is decided.”
Scorpius pointedly scraped his throat. “So none of us will have to worry about that. They like each other, and they have both accepted it. We just need to get them to admit it to each other.”
Septimius followed his partner silently, but not without shooting a bright smile at Potter and Draco. As Smiths closed the door, he had trouble suppressing a smirk. “I guess this means you have permission to touch.”
“Papa, you have always said that those robes were your best ones and you wouldn’t wear them without good reason!” she exclaimed.
Draco grumbled. “Until you get this wining and dining-thing going, why don’t I pour you some tea and we read a bit?”
Dumbledore had offered him protection. His family. But he couldn’t take the offer, because his father wasn’t forced to choose the Dark Lord. His father had chosen voluntarily. Protection was out of the question. Draco could take it, if he wanted to be kicked out of his family. If he wanted to disappoint his mother. And of course put her to risk. So, yes, theoretically, he could have taken the old man up on his offer. But practically? Don’t be a moron.
“We shouldn’t –“ Potter breathed, but was stopped by the look of utter adoration and love written plainly on Draco’s face, too much to handle so unexpectedly, and yet everything Potter wanted.
“And you never knew where she was?” Potter asked, a note of desperation in his voice, the sound of a parent who knows how it feels to not know where the children are.
With that, she left the room on her way to the Parkinson Estate. Potter grabbed the Marauder’s Map and scanned it to find Draco’s name, after which he ran to the corridor where Draco was supposed to be.
At that moment, Greg walked in with Phi under his arm. “I found this little one, does he belong to someone?” he joked, making Phi laugh uncontrollably.
from the film ‘Music + Lyrics’, Draco noticed the way many faces had already brightened, which caused him to continue singing and dancing for quite a while.
“Pathetic, you say? Why, thank you. It only means that I haven’t had much experience with lying. Isn’t that a good thing?”
Next came Cassie, saying that she was afraid of getting nightmares, with such a straight face that Draco couldn’t believe her, even if he wanted to. She sat on the edge of his bed.
“Since when are you capable of sharing chocolate? I seem to remember the twin’s birthday where you made a cake with one tier for yourself alone.”
“Cassie and Aquila look up to Ron and Ginny, Phi wants to be like Hermione, Scorpius almost wet his pants when he first met Charlie. Mother wants nothing more than become sisters again with Aunt Andromeda.”
The sobs got louder, racking Cassie’s small body. It tugged on Draco’s heartstrings to see her crying like this, and it made him want to hurt whoever caused it. Because he was pretty sure it wasn’t her arm that was hurting.
Molly returned with a piece of chocolate pie, handing it to Draco. “It’s double chocolate; milk glazing and white inside. I hope you enjoy it.”
“Adoption records, maybe even death. Could they have pretended that the child had died but got rid of it illegally instead?”
And if this godfather, this addition to the family had taken the photo, how had Draco gotten it? He hadn’t stolen it. Merlin, he wasn’t a thief. He would never do something like that. Then, perhaps, had someone given it to him? His father surely hadn’t. Severus hadn’t. And no one else he knew, would give him a present that wasn’t political nor approved by his father. So how had he gotten the thing?
“I know many instructions in your books are in fact useless. Your books are outdated and in some cases, even proven wrong. Unfortunately, the Ministry will not acknowledge new, modern Potions books to be used at Hogwarts, even though many top-of-the-class Potion Masters have written their own versions. I don’t mean to insinuate anything, but most Potion Masters have been Slytherins, and that might be a clarification.
“No, he shouldn’t. And Ophiuchus knows that this is the only time he will ever read papa’s diary,” Scorpius calmly explained.
Cassie was ecstatic when she unwrapped the new broomstick from Draco and Scorpius immediately tugged his new Quidditch protections on.
“Never. I will treasure this knowledge for the rest of my life. Who else knows about this crush of yours?”
James looked at him with big puppy eyes. “You are good in reading people, though. And I thought, perhaps you could explain how people work, just so I know what kind of signs I can look for.”
James grabbed the feather from Mr. Malfoy’s hands and put it down with the other ingredients. “No time to talk. Something unique for the victim, something unique. How can there be an ingredient unique to the victim? What is this nonsense?”
“And could you tell Scorpius I said hi, next time you see him? I really hope he will get better soon.”
“I think your one-sided shouting match kind of made her doubt her former decision. My one-sided shouting match may have helped a bit. But it was teamwork. Like Beaters, you know.”
“Listen. I know you do, infallibly. Because of the counterpotion. The curse hit me in the heart, right? That can’t just be cured by a simple counterpotion. My heart was weakened, and it had to get strong again. The counterpotion had to be brewed by someone with the same values, the same feelings, the same way of thinking as I have. Someone with a strong heart, who not only knows what to do, but also has the intrinsic motivation to help me. To save me. Someone who
They stood like this for a solid ten minutes, until Potter took a few deep breaths and looked up slightly. It was odd to see Potter up close without either of them trying to fight. Draco noticed there were streaks of tears across Potter’s cheeks and his eyes were red-rimmed. It must have been a terrible dream.
“I – we, well. Okay. Listen. Eh. I was trying to brew a counterpotion, for whatever spell this was. I’ve been doing that for the last six weeks, actually, but I didn’t know the spell and I was just guessing to what ingredients I needed. It- it didn’t go so well, because my cauldron kept exploding. You may need to buy some more next summer,” he chuckled awkwardly. Draco rolled his eyes before motioning for him to continue.
The children all picked up their bags and hurried towards their rooms, leaving Potter and Draco smiling at each other.
“I don’t. Not necessarily,” Draco grinned, handing Potter the spoon, so he could enjoy the chocolate as well. “I just like it better if I am to share.”
“Look at the potion, James. It looks good. We didn’t make a mistake. This is the way it’s supposed to be. Now, Bill is almost done with the Devil’s Snare, and I think you need all of it. Pour in the Dragon Claw Ooze, start stirring. This looks like a proper, working potion to me, and I have seen many potions that weren’t going to work. No desperation, remember?”
“Perhaps you should sit in with my lessons, I’m sure someone else could take over your Potions classes.”
Potter looked at Draco’s worried face, who was now also digging through his backpack in hopes of finding a spare beanie in one of the neglected pockets.
Involuntarily, he sees Potter body, dangling in Hagrid’s arms. He shudders at the memory. Alright, maybe he doesn’t want Potter dead, but he can live happily ever after without Potter around him. ‘You sure?’ he hears that stupid little voice say.
Why his father didn’t like Harry Potter was a mystery for Draco. Draco once asked about Harry Potter, when there was a big article on the cover page of the paper his father was reading. His father started shouting and yelling, and Draco was ushered upstairs by his mother. When Draco was cutting out the article later that day, his father had found him and had become very angry. This time his mother couldn’t send him to his room, because his father was angry
“Now, they aren’t. I am sure of it. Perhaps there is no physical abuse, but verbally, they are being beaten down.”
“She was a second year during my seventh year. The Slytherins all had nightmares of things they had heard from their parents or friends, so we slept in the common room. I stayed awake all night to wake people up when they were in a nightmare and to calm them down. I was responsible for them, I felt. One night, Rissa woke up from a nightmare, saying she had dreamt that her parents had been killed by Grandfather and she was alone now.”
Neville nodded. “Yeah. When she first came in, she didn’t know I was there. She crawled under branches of this massive plant, like she did it all the time. Which, I think, she does. The plant also didn’t reject her.” When Neville saw Draco’s puzzled face, he explained: “It’s a cutting from the Whomping Willow, only less violent. She must have had a good word with it, to be allowed under.”
“Is that the Muggle hoodie of mine? The one you told me about, the one you showed me? How did that get here?”
“Malfoy. Malfoy, listen. What was that spell they used on you, to make you feel what Cassie felt during her birth?”
Nodding, Doctor Selaminder turned to the Wizengamot. “May I address the suspect with a few questions?”
Potter’s stomach churned and twisted, his breath heavy and his face contorted in a frown so deep, it almost hurt him.
“I don’t believe it was you,” he admitted quietly. “I wanted to be sure. I don’t know what to think anymore, I don’t understand who else it could have been, I don’t feel right about all of this. Something is off, and I can’t seem to find what it is. I’m just examining every possibility, however unreasonable.”
“Yes. But also… We had a deal, when we married. She was allowed to have whoever she wanted, as long as the children were mine. There was no love in our marriage, you know that as well as anyone. The only demand was that the children would never find out about her beaus. Unfortunately, they did. Just as they were saying goodbye after a night together. Scorpius caught them. And since then, Astoria has been… acting strange. As if she had an ulterior motive. I don’t know, it makes me want to stay away from her.”
All students scrambled to enjoy a free hour, but Draco burst past them and marched towards the Defense classroom.
“Get used to it, Potter-boy,” he grinned afterwards. Potter groaned in response, but still asked Draco whether he wanted to do the Seeker’s game that evening or not.
“Now you know that those memories are mine, you must also realise that I can never really leave you, love. There is always something from me that you will have. Something tangible, something undeniable. Those memories are no one else’s but mine. They’re
They managed to pass the other guards as well, until they were stood in front of a door that said ‘Curse Breaker Weasley. Senior associate. Second in command.’ James pushed the door open to reveal a large office room with Bill in black trousers and white shirt, his uniform hanging on a coat rack in the corner.
Potter smiled softly, standing up to look at the gravestone again. “He did choose a beautiful place.”
“Minister,” Draco greeted politely, bowing as low as his traditional position would allow. The Minister smiled amusedly, gripping Draco’s hand firmly.
permission for you to roughen up your vocabulary. You will stay sweet and perfect and innocent and never say a bad word in your life, understood?”
to meet him. It has never been an option for her to skip it for a game of Wizard’s Chess or anything. It was an obligation.”
“I think they do want to know, since a Death Eater became professor at Hogwarts in the same year as Harry Potter did. I find it suspicious.”
“Why they would be against it? Most of all, because they don’t trust me. Apart from that, they find it unethical to adapt plants like that, or they worry about the kind of potions that would become available. It’s uneducated talk, of course, but that’s the way it is.”
“I don’t. Especially after seeing how Whithal treated you. I wasn’t a Hufflepuff for nothing, Mr. Malfoy-Potter, sir.”
“Well, same as you, really. Not enough players. When we play, I am Seeker, with Scorpius as my opponent. Aquila and Cassie are both Beater and Chaser. ‘Quila is the better Beater, and Cassie of course the Chaser. And Ophiuchus is the Keeper of my team, usually, and my mother Keeper of the opposite team.”
“But you won’t. Because you looooove me,” Pansy singsonged. Blaise joined her, and together they sang an awful song about friendship and love and whatnot. Draco was sure it wasn’t even a real song, that they made it up as they went.
“Now the rest of the Motherwort, please. Thank you. And are you done with the Maw yet? I need it in about… ten seconds.”
“Chocolate isn’t the answer for everything.” Draco felt Potter smile against his neck, warm, and soft, and far too intimate for the Great Hall with students around them. “Although, I guess I could be persuaded.”
Draco’s face twisted. Classic Potter. His son hadn’t done anything wrong, so he should stop his attack.
“Well… I don’t know what to think of it, but… there seems to be some kind of scar on his left forearm…?” the Healer asked, his eyes flicking to Draco’s own covered forearm.
“One has to imagine something funny, something one can laugh about. Only then can one successfully counter your Boggart. Boggarts represent your worst fear, and one can make the Boggart loose its form, but only through the Riddikulus incantation and a firm picture of something laughable in one’s head. For example, if one’s worst fear is, say, a wasp, then one has to imagine something else. I don’t know, a wasp with a cold that keeps conjuring a handkerchief from his breast pocket to blow his nose. Only with such a picture in mind, can one counter the Boggart.” He trailed of at the end, when he saw his papa standing in the door opening and watching with an amused expression.
“Yes. It was – it wasn’t that bad really. It was a compilation of everyone who had gotten hurt of had died before or during the war. You know, the low points of those years.”
That seemed to be the last Potter could handle. He growled, standing up to face Auror Smiths squarely.
But Cassie had disappeared again, and Draco heard Euripideia finishing her conversation outside. He undid every one of his spells with a flick of his wand, and bent over to get his bag.
“Ms. Euripideia. There’s – “ When she saw Draco, she gestured with her head for Euripideia to come out of her office. As she did so, Draco slowly turned around to appraise the room. Thirty seconds, he guessed, because Euripideia was keen to have him leave now. She wouldn’t let him wait here.
“But this case isn’t about love. It’s about mistreatment and abuse. And people can abuse others, even if they believe they love them. But I digress. Now, you don’t deny that Mr. Malfoy has done those things to you, do you?”
At the same time, Scorpius had gathered a few of his siblings, together with Albus and a couple Weasleys. They were carrying bags and boxes full of Christmas decorations.
“One time, she decided it would be fun to grab her bike and drive down the stairs. Needless to say, it went wrong. She fell when she was trying to slow down, and made a flip in the air. She landed on her back. When she tried to get up, she leaned on her bad arm –which was still completely untreated, then. She spent two weeks in St. Mungo’s, after which she was so full of energy, that she started crossing through the hallways on her bed, while Scorpius pushed her. They slammed into a wall, and Cassie got a concussion. I just can’t believe she’s in Slytherin, with this kind of behaviour,” he chuckled.
They shared a smile before turning to their essays. They marked in silence for a while, until Draco noticed that Potter started sulking again. It caused Draco’s nerves to tingle, and he bopped his foot impatiently while reading and rereading the same sentence of this –quite horrific- essay.
“Rissa May was brave and innocent. She was sweet. She didn’t deserve anything that happened to her.”
Sharing a look over Scorpius’s whining, which he had been doing all train ride long, Draco pointed to the parking lot where he had put his van at the beginning of the year. Harry raised his eyebrows at the sight of a dark blue Muggle car waiting for them, big enough for nine, including luggage.
“We know that people will think badly of you, or that they will take this to hurt you. We thought it through. But, papa… None of us have ever seen you smile so much with anyone except either one of us,” she continued. “You would be stupid to let him go. If only because he is a Gryffindor and I would quite like a Gryffindor in the family.”
Potter took the parchment, his eyebrows rising as he read it. “This is your last will and testament?”
“Good evening, come on in. Close the door behind you, please,” Draco smiled, quickly shoving the other essays aside in favour of James’s work.
“Well,” Draco started. “I heard that the hem usually holds the clues to that question. And in this case, I believe it is quite clear that this jumper was made by someone who only learned how to knit about two days ago.”
“You mean Lucia? I do know, and I also know you have been keeping her company. How very original of you, to gain someone’s loyalty by protecting them against bullies. It’s not as if my father hasn’t used the exact techniques in his
Doctor Selaminder stood up, calling ‘Objection! Conjecture!’ but was silenced immediately by the chairman, who made him sit back down and allowed Whithal to continue.
“Draco, please try to stop mumbling,” Lucius commented dryly. Phi grinned, giving his grandfather a shove. The two of them were the only ones that seemed to fully process that Draco was still alive.
Harry smiled weakly. “He isn’t. Shit, I said it all wrong. No, he’s not dead. He’s just hurt. I have no doubt he will be fine in no time.”
While Teddy looked at Phi, who was absently talking to Victoire and coloured his hair a dark kind of red, he smiled. “It seems like it runs in the family,” Teddy started, the first to address them being relatives. “Being a metamorphmagus.”
Harry Potter. It had to be. Crabbe and Goyle wouldn’t randomly tell him there was a boy named Harry Potter, if it wasn’t
You can’t lead him on like this. It’s not healthy, not for you and not for him. If the reasons of your inhibitions are so strong, let him go entirely. I don’t want you hurting him. You’ve hurt him enough in your life.”
“It’s just… If papa gave that curse to Vol- to Tom Riddle, then he must have been able to invent a counterpotion, right? Papa is the best potioneer in the world.”
“What is happening? Alissa, get up!” Laurentia hissed. Alissa tried to speak but suddenly she was puking out slugs.
Draco narrowed his eyes. “I’m not going to talk to you about anything like that and you know why. If that was all, I’d rather have you gone.”
“Well, if he’s right about the curse, it wasn’t meant to kill, just to torture. Do we even know which curse it is?”
Albus and Lily smiled, patting their siblings’s backs and shoulders, but James looked at the ground. Cassie was trembling in Scorpius’s arms, with her face hiding in his chest.
“Anyway, Albus, I’m glad for you, and I hope that you and Manila will be very happy together. Please, in the future, tell me everything. And papa… I don’t even have words for you,” Scorpius stated.
“Sure. That’s why you were so shocked, and that’s why you tried to deny you fancied someone, even though you were dosed with Veritaserum.”
“That’s not all. A couple days later, I was walking along the Great Lake, like I always did. But what people don’t know is that I wasn’t walking alone. Those walks along the Lake were with Amycus Carrow, who was giving me extra information about the raids that had been done that night. Rissa washed up the shore, attacked by Merpeople. I told the Slytherins that it had been suicide, but she was alive when we found her.”
Potter chuckled as well. “Did you guys know Malfoy had a crush on one of us?” he blurted out. His eyes widened and he slapped a hand over his mouth when he realised what he had said.
The Great Hall was already full and busy. Potter was seated in his usual spot and smiled at Draco when the latter walked through the doors. Draco nodded back, but turned to the Gryffindor corner, instead of the High Table.
“You are amazing, love. I wouldn’t know what to do without you.” Draco kissed her on her crown, and she smiled.
“You need to hydrate after a nightmare. It was a nightmare, wasn’t it?” Draco asked, while casting a Silencing charm around them, so Phi wouldn’t wake up.
“What? Why are you looking at me like I just spoke in Parseltongue, or something? Is there something in my hair?”
Draco felt a sense of satisfaction and a hint of fear go through him, and he was quite sure it was at least partly Cassie. “Uhm, it is said that the prophecy can only be viewed by the heir of the Malfoy family, and not unless the heir is deemed ready for it. I would like to see whether it thinks I’m ready. It is said to be a personalised message on what the greatest weakness in my manner of “ruling” might be.”
He crawled on Harry’s lap, directed James which game he wanted to play and pointed Neville to the drinks.
Aquila laughed. “I mean, my dress is already flashy. I don’t want my hair to pull attention away from my hair.”
“Hi,” Draco smiled, looking up at Potter, who had perched himself on the corner of Draco’s desk. “What are you here for?”
“No, I don’t think so. Sure, she hates me, but she wouldn’t do anything that might harm her children.”
Some fifty miles away, the Lodge was filled with scared people trying to put on a brave face. George had left the shop in Ron’s hands and Hermione had left the Ministry early in order to be there for Harry. Pansy, Blaise and Greg had Apparated over as soon as they heard. They wanted to have a meeting with everyone to decide what to do, like they had done before with Draco in the hospital. Even all the Weasley children had come around, leaving their parents at home or at work. Unfortunately, there was no one to bring order to the group, as Scorpius was shaking as a leaf and refused to come out of his room. Harry assumed Albus was with him, as Albus was nowhere to be seen either, and he was glad that the two had each other.
Ophiuchus extracted himself from Draco’s arms and looked into his father’s eyes, sniffling lightly. He smiled when he nodded, though, so Draco counted it as a win.
Lightning-quick, Draco grabbed his wrist and took the bit of chocolate for himself. “Merlin, this should be illegal,” he murmured. “What even
Okay, so I just wrote an entire chapter in one day. I guess I was inspired. And I still owed you a chapter, because I had skipped one. Perhaps even two. Anyways, a new chapter. Yay!
From the doors, guarded by an Auror, Lazarus, one of Draco’s more annoying students, stepped in. The students and teachers that were attending the trial, like the Weasleys, Jackie, Minerva and Neville, started chattering. Minerva was obviously getting agitated.
“And here I was thinking that the law –need I specify the clause?- states that every charge of which the sentence is fulfilled, cannot be used in later trials.” He stopped right in front of Whithal, giving him a side-glance. “Has that law suddenly changed?”
Just when Draco was about to cut in, because the Potions classroom was really no place to talk about how handsome and stunning and well-dressed Potter was, a fourth girl who had been silently working on her essay, looked up and sighed whole-heartedly.
“I just came down here because I thought you should know about Scorpius, since I know you were the one to get them expelled. And as far as I know, they never got to Cassie. Scorpius made sure he got her hits, and they never laid a finger on her.”
“Suzanne’s parents are friends with Ms. Euripideia. The things I had told her about you, she blabbed to her parents, because of which many things could happen that none of us would have liked to happen. Like Papa in the hospital. And since then, I did a little research about the rest of our plus-ones, and I found out that Manila isn’t to be trusted either. Sorry, Albie. She’s close with Theresa and Suzanne. I overheard them a couple days back, she was telling them things she could only know from you. This ‘movement’ is much bigger than any of us expected.”
“Don’t insult his family. Don’t insult Slytherin House, or Pansy and Blaise. Don’t insult his abilities.” Potter grinned. “And don’t walk into his office when the door is closed.”
James laughed. “Well, that sums her up. Does every flower really have a different meaning? That’s pretty cool, isn’t it?”
“Then stop walking for a second!” Draco grabbed Potter’s wrist, releasing it only a second later as if it were burning coals. It did satisfy his goal however, getting Potter to stop walking.
“If you sleep without shirt, that’s fine with me,” Potter assured him. “I’m already disrupting your night by coming here and asking to stay over, so I want you to be comfortable.”
“Because otherwise James will wake up and see us eating this. And when that happens, we won’t have much chocolate anymore.”
He felt like a liar. It wouldn’t be all right. Perhaps his children would get over this eventually, perhaps they would manage to continue living, but it would never be all right anymore. He knew well enough how much he meant to his children, and how much they loved him. Nothing would be all right, no touch of a hand, no song, no stroke through silky, wonderful, blonde hair.
“He is, indeed. However, the fact that he found the curse somewhere, doesn’t mean that he knew how it worked or how to counter it. He didn’t invent it.”
The few that didn’t know this, including Theo, made some surprised noises, and looked between him and Potter.
And so he did. He sat in his office in the dungeons with his door open, trying to focus on assignments of his third- and fourth-years. Their essays, however, were all horribly bad and he winced with almost every written word. He put Scorp’s, Albie’s and Aquila’s essays to the side, wanting to read those as last, because they were hopefully not as bad.
“I’m a sap? You’re a Slytherin who pulled out the Sword of Gryffindor, because you cared so much for me! I think you’re the definition of a sap.”
“Malf – Draco,” Percy acknowledged Draco, a bit stiff since they never had the most flattering conversations, back at Hogwarts.
at it,” Potter laughed. When he saw Lily’s lower lip form in a pout, he pulled her in for a quick hug. “Sweetheart, of course you will do fine. You always do. You still have two weeks to prepare, yeah?”
It turned out that James had tried to create his own potion. It wasn’t a very difficult one, since he had only worked with ingredients he was allowed to work with, but it was impressive, nonetheless. He had asked Neville for help on how to include some tough plants and had gotten in touch with the Ministry Department of Potions and Ingredients. In his essay, he had included an interview with a student of the Potions Mastery, where he had gotten information on the effect of stirring clockwise or anti-clockwise.
It got Potter quiet for a couple long seconds. “You hate me,” he stated flatly. There was a question in there somewhere.
He had tried. Give him a break, he had bloody well tried! He had tried to be a Death Eater, he had tried to be a good person, and none of it worked! He was nothing, and he could do nothing. He was powerless. Powerless to his father, powerless to the Dark Lord and powerless to Potter. He knew it, and he knew Potter knew it. Just give him a chance to work it out. To work out what he was, who he was. He couldn’t do it by himself.
“Right, yeah, of course,” Potter answered sheepishly. “I got carried away. Sorry. So the Healers say he will be fine?”
Other students all milled around to get the latest news, and Draco was quickly updated on everything that was known for now. Just when everyone was seated and gossiping with friends, a second piece of parchment appeared on the fireplace, which caused a new ruckus.
“Thank you” he says quietly. Pansy stayed behind with Luna. Why? Oh, right. She doesn’t want to talk to him at all. He’s not a Slytherin anymore. Now, he’s just the guy who killed Voldemort.
“Everything about you screams that you want him, which is okay. We’ve all accepted you. But then you go ahead and run away like that. Don’t. He needs
Draco managed to suppress his flinch, but couldn’t help moving away just a centimetre. What could Potter have meant? Did he mean the courtship, but regretted it now? Did he mean the Serpensortia he sent Draco’s way during the duel? Or did he mean those hateful things they used to say to each other?
“They’re the Weasleys. It’s the only necessary explanation,” Potter said easily. “If you’re worried about convenience, you could stay another night at my place. It wouldn’t be a problem. At all.”
Of course, in Malfoy Manor, he had recognised him as soon as he came into the room. He hadn’t said anything then. He hadn’t told his parents that it was Harry Potter. He saved Potter then, did he not? But that was because Potter could save his parents. If Potter had died then, Draco would never be safe from Voldemort.
It must have been a coincidence, that Potter wasn’t very busy that lesson, so that Phi could talk to him without being shooed away. Completely coincidental. Entirely unforeseen. Totally unexpected. Perfectly unanticipated.
Sitting on the side of Draco’s bed, Pansy took his hand and stroked it with her thumb. “Quite pathetic, isn’t it?”
The Great Hall was cleared away from dinner tables and one long, official duelling platform was created in the middle. All Hogwarts students had gathered around, the teachers were posed behind McGonagall.
“Papa says they’re just dreams,” the girl added, right before she would close the door behind her. “Nothing to worry about.”
“Potter, promise me that you will always come to me when you have a nightmare. No matter what happens, no matter what kind of dream it, could you just come to me?” Draco pleaded softly. He saw Pansy and Blaise share a loaded look from the corner of his eyes, but chose to ignore it.
“I am being followed. Everywhere I go, there is someone in plain black robes, just looking at me. It’s always the same person. I can’t be sure, but… that’s what it feels like. It’s been like this for a while now. About two years or something.”
“Very good. You should know that there will be no extensive theoretical research. We are going to work out a hypothesis. We can meet up at Fridays, after classes. I assume you never do any homework on Fridays?”
Rejected? Does he feel rejected by Potter? What does that even mean? Had he hoped for friendship, then? Yes, of course, that was it. He had wanted to be friends with the Boy Who Lived. ‘Is that all?’ Confusing, two-faced brain. Yes, it was all. He never wanted anything else than friendship.
Blaise was walking alone, casual as always, but happy to be part of their family. Scorpius and Albus were walking silently. Scorpius looked proudly in front of him, shoulders squared, with a perfect Malfoy mask in place. Albus on the other hand looked at the ground and his breaths were uneven.
Ever since the beginning of this school year, when both gentlemen started their teaching positions, they seemed to be on very good terms. At breakfast, lunch and dinner, they enjoyed each other’s company at the High Table, having long conversations that caused them both to be late to several lessons. Our source even told us how they had seen Mr. Potter sneaking to the Slytherin dorms late at night.
Draco’s hand inched towards the Dark Mark on his forearm and he couldn’t summon the energy to stop it. He knew that the moment his hand wrapped around the Mark, he would break down completely. He didn’t want Potter to see it. He wanted Potter to leave. But he couldn’t do anything to stop himself from telling the story, and he couldn’t bear to see Potter go, not now.
And because of all that, Draco found himself striding to the office of the Head of Mysteries. Lucius and Narcissa both had this woman, Sifa Euripideia, as their main suspect of leading the movement, and Potter had told them that she would be capable of doing it. The Detective Department of Team For Justice had therefore decided that Draco should visit her with an excuse, to observe her body language and maybe snoop in her office a little.
“Trust her to fight with a plant, honestly. She would do anything to get what she wanted. But I was wondering, what does your research consist from, really?”
“What we need to do is simple,” Scorpius started, having taken over control again. Aquila had produced some parchment and a quill from her bag, just like Rose and Hugo had, and they divided into three groups of four or five.
Draco smiled, looking down at the ground. “Thanks. I appreciate it. And Roxane is a lovely student. She is a lot quieter than I had feared, with you as her father.”
Potter stared at the letter. It sounded so sensible. It would also fit exactly in how Draco had been acting towards him. Besides, Potter had the feeling that Cassie was most like Draco and understood him best, which indicated that she might be right about this.
“It might be more of a hassle than you think. He doesn’t really like to break the rules,” Harry interrupted.
I might have spent two hours today on thinking how Draco's wardrobe would look like and which robes and shirts and things he had. It was fun. I had a lot of fun.
Draco looked him in the eye. He nodded slowly. A wide grin stole over his face. “Magnificent. You’re still not allowed to call me Draco, though,” he joked. Neville snorted.
would make an interesting plot twist. Draco no longer worried about meeting Potter and shaking his hand. He didn’t need Potter’s acquaintance. He was perfectly fine on his own. Every bit of influence he would ever need, he would get from his family name and the family vault. He knew how much his family was worth, unlike the blood traitor families, or muggleborns. He could achieve anything he wished, if only he was prepared to work for it. He didn’t need Potter’s acquaintance.
“Oh, we didn’t,” Albus said airily. “We were going to have this meeting, whether you were here or not. It’s better that you’re here, though. You seem to have kept a lot of information behind, and we need to know everything we can. Scorp, did we invite your grandparents?”
Priscus and his father had been silently watching, but now Mr. Belby pulled Priscus up on his collar and made to walk away as well.
After dinner, Draco went up to his rooms in the dungeons, where his children were already assembled. Pansy was there too. Neville and Potter would arrive with the Weasleys, Blaise, Greg and the other members of their group of friends.
But I'm glad you guys hung in there and have (hopefully) been patient. It's a short chapter (because of above-named reason) and it may not be very good either (because of above-named reason). Still, I hope you like it.
Aquila pulled a face. “Right, the Triwizard Tournament. So now they just do a Valentine’s Ball every four years?”
“You two are awful. I hate you both and you will never see my children again if you continue,” he threatened. Pansy and Blaise fell silent immediately, blinking up at him in perfect innocence.
“- dependant creatures that should not be kept in a neat yet far too chaotic house like ours,” Cassie supplied. “I
Chuckling, Potter caught Draco’s eyes. “He shared. I doubt he would eat caramel sea salt, though. He seemed very fixed on his hazelnut flavoured ones. And I liked them. How did you get them in the shape of those potions bottles?”
Potter’s team only missed his two Beaters. Draco saw George cast a wistful glance at the brooms and bats. He remembered how Potter had said that George hadn’t really played since Fred’s death.
“I was hoping that you would maybe like to marry me. If you aren’t sick and tired of the entire marriage business already. In case you’re wondering, Molly and Arthur actually gave me their blessing, and my parents did too, as I said, so that’s settled. What do you say?”
When he returned, he was carrying a large box, and he put it down carefully on top of Potter’s essays. The latter quickly undid the sticking charm and opened the box, revealing loads of bubble wrap plastic.
“- so that, when we reveal all the shit happening around us, this will add to our credibility. Also, if James becomes involved, we don’t know what its effects will be. It has to be centred on the Malfoys.”
“That’s cheating!” Potter yelled, when he was somewhat closer. Draco bit his lip, disliking the fact that Potter had caught up already.
“See, there is nothing to be afraid of. Now that you have had your transformation, you will be able to control it much easier. It’s just like your Metamorphmagus abilities.” Draco chuckled. “You couldn’t just have one shifting ability, could you? You just have to have it all. Can you change back for me?”
I received a few comments about mistakes in my story, so I just wanted to say that this is completely unbeta'ed, so there might be stupid typos or whatever. My apologies for those.
Draco grinned, looking down at his vegetables. Potter thought he saw a blush on his cheekbones, but he couldn’t be sure. Mostly because he couldn’t quite believe Draco would blush now, of all days.
Draco immediately saw the change, and his gut feeling told him he had to be prepared. His wand was in his hand before he could even think about it.
And then I got a letter telling me all about his new friend, Scorpius Malfoy. He told me how they had met and how cool Scorpius was. Albus got a lot of confidence from Scorpius, you know. Scorp taught him what he was worth and that he shouldn’t care what people say. He told Albus that everyone said bad things about his father and their family, but that it didn’t matter, because they loved each other. And that that was the most important thing in the world. Albus wouldn’t have been the confident, out-going guy without Scorpius. So I guess I should thank you for raising your son so wonderfully.”
“Let me refresh your memory. You kept on the defensive for the majority of the duel, correct? Then, suddenly, out of nothing, you cast a sharp Stinging hex, followed by a Pepper Breath, and then a Broken Bone curse. Do you know how many of these are illegal in exemplary duels?”
After what felt like thirty seconds, but was more like thirty minutes, the door of Draco’s room opened again to let in the other three Malfoys, guided by his Healer that came to check up on his vitals.
Some students nodded, a few first years seemed to brighten up. They had heard the rumours about Slytherin, and were disappointed to belong there. Hearing these words, cheered them up a bit.
James nodded, swallowing heavily before straightening his back and going back to the potion. He stirred it calmly, five times clockwise and fifteen times anti-clockwise. Then, he instructed Mr. Malfoy to start adding the Devil’s Snare gradually while he kept stirring. With every once he stirred, there should be a twelfth part of the Devil’s Snare added. Bill kept close eye on the amount Mr. Malfoy added, but it became abundantly clear that Mr. Malfoy really knew what he was doing.
“Mother, have you designed those posters?” The viewpoints were masterly worded, carefully chosen formulations that were just manipulative enough to get everyone to support SPEW, even if only out of fear for public shaming.
Great start of his first day of work. And now he only had ten more minutes to make sure he himself was presentable, and his desk was cleared, before third year Slytherins and Ravenclaws would walk in.
“That won’t happen, Malfoy. Such things only happen when much worse has happened than being beaten up. I’m not trying to trivialize what happened, because it’s awful, and if I would find out who did this, I will release all my Boy Who Lived shit over them –“
Aquila smiled apologetically and started to shake her head, when the seller cut in to try and convince her. Draco let it happen for a second, because he thought Aquila could handle herself well enough. When the man held on to Aquila’s arm to stop her from walking away, Draco cleared his throat and stepped up.
Draco greeted his daughter and Matias with a subtle smile and waited for Scorpius and Albus to arrive. They were late. Just when he was about to close the door, they slipped inside and walked to their seats.
“All right. If the two of you are in a courtship, don’t you think Harry should know something about you, Draco?”
“James, no cookies for you if you don’t get away from the presents this second. And where did you leave Ophiuchus?”
The Auror had started to circle around Potter too, ending with a sharp turn to make them face each other again.
told me to tell you everything. I should just have listened to you. I should always listen to you, papa.”
Somewhere around midnight, a few moments after the old grandfather clock in his living room had struck, someone knocked on his door. It was urgent, rapt. Cassie probably had had a nightmare, which would also explain why Draco was restless. He was always restless at nights Cassie had bad dreams. He felt them coming.
“Ladies and gentlemen, settle down. Today, we will be talking about potions that can counter spells. First, can someone tell me about counterpotions in general?”
The gashes he had gotten when James had been cursed were open again. Scorpius was dabbing Albus’s face with Dittany – copious amounts, by the smell of it – but every time Albie winced, a trail of blood left the gashes, making his face some kind of horrific mask.
Cassie swung around with an imperial fling of her hair and marched back to her siblings on the Slytherin table.
“That’s not what I’m asking. I explained why I brought Butterbeer instead of Firewhiskey. Do you think I’d want you to get drunk?”
Scorpius had come up with the name, ‘Malfoy Lodge’, which was proudly decorating the iron gate and the front door.
She tutted. “Because you two were too busy fighting to notice that the youngest Ms. Malfoy is trying to get your attention.”
The good thing was that both Draco and Potter had brought their children. It took the edge off. Albus had sporadically met Lucius and Narcissa on birthday parties of Scorpius, and Lily was sweet enough to have Narcissa doting on her immediately. Lucius stayed away from James, Albus and Potter, but couldn’t resist Lily’s smile. Especially when Lily and Cassie appeared to be best friends, giggling together and often glancing at their respective families.
“You wouldn’t, but I need to use the library. Can I disturb your Saturday by digging through all our books?”
Draco folded his legs under his body and leaned against the arm rest, holding his tea close and looking at the shelves with pictures and books.
“It’s been your own choice, Harry,” Hermione chuckled. “I mean, I would never have chosen to raise seven children, but you and Draco did this to yourselves.”
Albus clenched his jaw. It wouldn’t do any good to stay here, so he turned back towards the Floo and reached for the powder.
Snapping his head up, mug of tea resting against his lips, mid-sip, Draco frantically searched Potter’s face for any hint of more knowledge than he was letting on. When he noticed that Potter was truly just curious, he relaxed and finished his sip.
When the noise had come down, Minerva walked up to the lecture. “I wished to welcome Professor Malfoy back to Hogwarts after his adventures in St. Mungo’s, but I believe his welcome has been taken care of. Still, Professor Malfoy, I am glad to see you back, and healthy. However, the rumours that have gone ‘round about the reason for his time in the hospital, are something I would like to address. Professor Malfoy has not fallen ill just like that, but was attacked for malevolent reasons. Therefore, I’ll take this moment to say that whatever someone does or has done, nothing will ever justify hurting, bullying or degrading others. That being said, I also wish to highlight again that any disrespect to professors will not be tolerated, and that it will be adequately punished. Now, I will no longer hold you from your meal.”
“I just don’t. I don’t think it’s right to break into a Ministry department. Or anywhere, for that matter.”
“His eyes crinkle at the corners, and there’s a muscle in his jaw that twitches slightly. When he absolutely likes what he sees, as in, a piece of art or music or clothing, he scrunches up his nose. It’s barely noticeable, but there’s a small crinkle on the bridge of his nose.”
Draco grinned. “Then we know that it isn’t about me. Professor Potter asked me, not the other way around.”
There was a piece of cake waiting for him, with a cup of tea next to it, right in front of his favourite chair, and he couldn’t be happier.
Cassie rolled her eyes. “He was kept by a family that shaved his fur in the winter, and he didn’t get enough to eat. He lived in the smallest cage possible. It was abuse.”
“Do you actually have a bunch of French phrases written on your hand?” he questioned incredibly. “Just so you good ask me how I was in French?”
“You of all people must know that there are thousands of secret passage-ways here. Don’t you have some kind of magical thing with which you always stalked Draco?”
“Are you insinuating I’m fat?” Draco asked unbelievably. The smirk on Potter’s face made the insult not much of an insult, though, so Draco didn’t exactly mind.
“Good, because we called everyone to come after dinner so we could start planning,” James grinned, pulling Draco back into the Great Hall to eat their dinner.
“Papa, please. You aren’t as good at acting as you like to think,” Cassie said in a bored tone. She grabbed the note from Draco and read it over, after which she turned a questioning gaze on Albus. “Does Scorpius seriously not know? Even I did!”
Ron grinned. “I can’t imagine. Potions will always be awful for me. But Rose and Hugo seem to enjoy it.” He looked at Phi, who was talking animatedly with the bartender and was actually able to get a smile on her face.
Draco nodded, ignoring the twist in his stomach. “Naturally. When can the next appointment be? I’d like it as soon as possible.”
He had asked his father what the tattoo on his left forearm was. His father waved him away. When he asked his mother, she looked sad for a second, before she schooled her expression. “It is a political mark,” she said shortly. However much he pushed and manipulated, she would not tell him more. She passed him the paper she had finished reading and stood up from the table. Draco stayed put, reading
“They do the maintenance of it. I try to plant and take care of it as much as possible. There’s a lovely piece that I have claimed as my ‘silent garden’. I’ll take you there this summer. It should be at its best this month.”
Walking into the Great Hall, knowing what was about to happen, made Draco fidget a bit. He saw Potter at the High Table looking at his plate. When they locked eyes, Potter blushed and looked away.
There was a momentary bout of noise when everyone grabbed their books and parchment, but soon, it was quiet again. Draco pulled his own research out of his desk and worked on that while there were no problems.
“You promised me…” she started, hiccoughing. “You promised me you would tell me everything someday. I think that ‘someday’ is now.”
“Everyone stay where you are! You are surrounded by Aurors. There is no way out!” it sounded from outside. Laurentia got up to her feet and twirled in an effort to Apparate away, but Draco smirked. “You heard it,
He cast the spell that would make documents with his name on it light up, then started mumbling as he tried unlocking the drawer.
“Sorry for asking, but why are you here? You can’t be a student yet, unless your father has pulled some strings,” Draco heard Potter say.
It resulted in an eye roll and a glare from Potter. “I used to have a mind-link with Voldemort. I saw what he saw. It’s rather difficult not to get nightmares from that. So yeah, I’m quite sure you’ve had your fair share as well.”
Draco laughed. “Something like that, yeah. Pansy and Blaise usually clamber all over me. It’s all right, though. It’s nice and warm.”
“Therefore, I let him in, and tried to help him to my best abilities. Regrettably, we woke up late, and Pot- Professor Potter wouldn’t have time to go to his own quarters before classes would start. I lend him my robes.”
“No, in case you might influence them. You will not be allowed to speak with them until trials are held.”
“Exactly. Papa wouldn’t have responded in any such way if it was anyone else. You know how he responded when Scorpius was beat up. He keeps his cool, as long as people stay away from his family. The only reason he lashed out at Harry, was because of the HP effect.”
Draco, seeing that Auror Smiths wasn’t going to bend, coughed softly. “Potter. The ones that arrested me were Auror Septimius and Auror Whithal.”
“Obviously not. But their children will get a mixed upbringing. It’s not a coincidence that all Weasleys are in Gryffindor, even though some of them would fit perfectly well in other Houses.”
Draco scoffed. “’Teenage frustrations’ makes it sound like they were based on nothing. And obviously, they were based on very accurate observations.”
“We weren’t allowed,” Draco told. “Father, Mother and I couldn’t go to his funeral. Because our trials would happen later that summer, we were very closely traced. There must have been four guards per person, at any time of the day. Not only would our presence, with twelve guards, have been highly disturbing on a funeral, the Auror Department also forbade us to go, since the guards wouldn’t be able to keep a close enough eye on us. The main reason though, the one that was never mentioned out loud but always implied, was that Severus had been a bearer of the Dark Mark. If they would allow known Death Eaters to be present, his funeral could have become a place where the fight was renewed. The Aurors wouldn’t take any chances.”
“Yeah, he is. He’s actually able to calm me down, and no one else has done that before. Has he helped you too?”
“Because in those stories are bravery, determination and love. And those are the most important things in life,” Phi recounted, a sentence Draco had told them many times.
Potter shook his head, a faint smile having formed around his mouth. “No. No, I’m not. I… I understand. I think I know what he is struggling with, even though he won’t tell me. I think I get it. I’m willing to give him time. As long as I can be sure that we will be together in the end.”
“What do you know about what I’ve done for Hogwarts?” Draco asked, snapping his eyes open, searching Greg’s face for any indication of what he might know.
DRACO IS BACCCCCCCK. I watched A Very Potter Musical last weekend and now I can't pronounce Draco in any other way than the AVPM Lucius way. Ughh AVPM and the Sequel are soooooooo good!
“Oh, the women of S.P.E.W. like to gossip. Especially with me around, they talk extraordinarily much about people that fought against Death Eaters. It results in some very interesting information.”
“Also, that was a private conversation, Ophiuchus Sirius Malfoy-Potter. Have you been eavesdropping again?”
Squeezing softly in his son’s hand, Draco shared another look with Potter before continuing. “That bouquet of flowers is James’s.”
“Thank you, papa and Dad, for finally breaking eye contact. Thank you, everyone else, for giving up your evening to join us in making a plan. And lastly, thank you, to everyone who has been present at our meetings earlier in the year. As you can see, we managed to set those two up together, much to my regret, and they are now a disgustingly sweet couple. However, there are people who do not want them as a couple – which I understand, because, as I said, they are disgusting. But you know, as loving son, I am supposed to support them and I will not stand for people assaulting either or both of them.”
Draco dropped his head to the wall with a thump, fiddling with his signet ring. If only he could see his children, or send them a message. He needed to hear from them. He needed to know they were doing all right. And dear Merlin, did he need to hold them close and feel their warmth.
Pansy had snickered at that moment. “Go on, Draco. Tell him all the reasons why Potter can’t be gay.”
“But, I am very, very satisfied with your work. Your essay is the only work I have ever read, of which I think it deserves an Outstanding. That includes,” Draco added with emphasis, when he saw James’s eyes widen. “- essays written by Hermione Granger, Severus Snape and myself. Very well done, James. Very well done.”
“Happened a long time ago. I know. I just think that if Mr. Malfoy had no qualms treating you like trash, the way he did when he was at Hogwarts, he wouldn’t have any qualms doing that to others as well. He mistreated and abused
“Potter, I would like to see my son survive it now that it’s possible. Could you maybe not crush his chest now?” Lucius drawled.
“Unless you think you aren’t able to do such a thing,” Draco added, his voice sounding a bit more sneering than he intended. Eh, it got the message alright. The Gryffindor students sat up straighter and all got a fighter’s look in their eyes.
“I don’t either, but I suspect it’s in line with everything else that’s happened. Someone who knows how to catch James off guard. It’s a curse, or at least a spell that throws him off.”
For Scorpius, he had arranged to go with Narcissa to a S.P.E.W. event where Shacklebolt would be present, so he could talk to the Minister.
“What did you like most about marriage?” Potter asked, while they were both reading a book, leaning against one another.
“So he’s sending you love notes, now?” Theresa asked teasingly. “And you are sure that you aren’t in a relationship?”
“My family was never very interested in curse-breaking. We only had that book because, as Bill said, it was a must-have in every family library. Never used, never read. Which is why I deemed it all right to pass along.”
“And who are the other Weasleys here?” Draco asked, eyeing the Gryffindor table with quite some curiosity.
So... I may be a bit late? As in 5 days late? And I'm sorry? But I don't know what happened? And I use too many question marks now?
That evening, the Malfoy children had assembled in Draco’s apartment, for a ‘lovely family night of joy and peace,’ as Draco called it. At that moment, the lovely family night consisted of falsely crying out the latest songs. When it had gotten later, Cassie planted herself on one of the chairs and smiled sweetly at Draco.
Draco smiled, while the others were asking for a translation. Neither Potter nor Draco provided one.
“Of course. Of course!” he mumbled, rushing to his bedroom. He rummaged through one of the dressers until he pulled out the box of documents Cassie had stolen from Ms. Euripideia’s office.
When he said it, Draco realised he had revealed another vital part of himself to Potter, another vulnerability. Of course Potter would know he was talking about Lucius and himself. His right hand twitched into a fist, but he quickly –forcibly- released the muscles again.
Draco took a few deep breaths before nodding to himself. “Nagini was the very last horcrux. She was a snake, a cobra of some kind. She was some twelve feet long, and highly venomous. Severus was bitten and died within a few minutes. You know how terrified you can be when Mrs. Norris appears, because you know that Filch will come by any minute? That was the same with Nagini and Riddle. Where Nagini was, there was Riddle. And because Riddle was a Parseltongue, Nagini could tell him everything you did wrong and you would be punished.”
“I truly hope so. I barely sleep without you by my side. You are everything to me, you know that, don’t you, honey?”
“And with us being Malfoys, they don’t trust us. So they would try to reign us in,” Phi supplied. “Why can’t they just get over it? You have done everything you can to clear your name, and none of us have ever done something wrong. Our name shouldn’t be a source of mistrust anymore. It’s prejudice, all of it!”
Glad with the change of subject, Draco smiled. “I did know, yes. Do you remember that time we talked about which child was most like ourselves?”
Oh, Arthur was such a fan of Muggles, wasn’t he? Perhaps Draco had a present for him at home. He should remember that.
“Why didn’t you tell us, last couple of times we were here? There were enough opportunities. Why didn’t Dad tell us everything from the start?”
Aquila had changed in her dress in the bathroom, reappearing in baby blue dress reaching to the ground. The colour set off her eyes.
Narcissa laughed, waving Lucius closer. Lucius reluctantly joined them, grumbling when Narcissa asked him to show Potter around. Draco shot Potter a concerned look when he saw him leaving with his father.
The urgency in Draco’s voice quickly turned into begging desperation. Lucius’s hand was clasped in Draco’s, but there wasn’t even much strength in his grip anymore.
Potter left, softly closed the door, and Draco was sitting on his divan with the box on his lap. He leafed through every article he had ever cut out and read them again and again.
“But let me make one thing clear. Most Slytherins would never have done the things they did, if only they were treated equally.”
If Aquila, a Ravenclaw at best, was hatching some kind of plan with James, a Gryffindor too much like his father that had been brilliant enough to brew an antidote for a very Dark curse, it couldn’t be good. Draco decided to keep an eye on them.
No matter what everyone in the Wizarding World thought of Slytherins; they stuck together and protected each other when necessary. They’re family. Draco was proud of his snake nest.
“Let Aquila go,” he ordered as he popped into Manila’s room. She raised her eyebrows at him and took a sip of her tea.
Potter affirmed it, called a quick ‘Merry Christmas! See you next year!’ to Neville and Hannah, and then turned back to Draco.
“Indeed. These enhancers are usually the parts that make a potion dangerous, addictive or poisonous. If these enhancers aren’t necessary anymore, all kinds of potions will become available to the wide public.” Theresa took a breath and smiled angelically at the audience. “The moment I realised what this could mean – namely that untested potions with possible dangerous effects could land in every household – I told Auror Whithal all about it, to gain his advice on what to do.”
“If you’re going to sing, sing like you mean it,” he demanded laughingly. Potter put down the ball of dough he had been kneading and looked Draco straight in the eye. When he had caught Draco’s gaze, he started dancing abominably while increasing his volume of singing.
Potter hesitated, but at Draco forlorn gaze, he sighed. “Snape was in love with my mother,” he whispered.
“It’s all right, Potter. Everything is all right. You’re safe now,” he murmured, his thoughts going a mile an hour to find out what he should do now. When Draco tried to pull back to move Potter towards the sofa and get him something to drink, Potter merely tightened his hold on Draco’s shirt, so much so, that Draco actually started to worry his shirt might not survive the evening. With this in mind, and the fact that Potter must have been terrified to react in such a way, Draco just replaced his arms around Potter, wrapping them tightly and rocking them both softly back and forth.
“Just because your daughter ratted us out, doesn’t mean every Ravenclaw would. Indeed, it’s probably because she’s a filthy Slytherin inside! She should have had the same treatment as those other disgusting first-years. They have to learn to keep their head down!”
Draco’s right hand had closed itself around his forearm, around the Mark, that twisted and turned and bit. He was petrified, metaphorically and literally. Draco couldn’t move anymore, too invested in standing upright, in not screaming his lungs out, in breathing in and out and in.
Draco looked to his right, where Flitwick was talking to the Runes professor. “Sneaky bastards, they are. Merlin, I love them.”
“And I dream of people being tortured, not only with the Cruciatus, but also with Muggle torture devices. They are tortured until they’re begging to die, and then, when they’ve recovered a bit, they are tortured again. It’s really very disgusting,” Cassie continued, fiddling with her hands and looking down at the ground.
When Draco reached the end, it was somewhere around two o’clock in the evening, and he was tired. He scanned a few paragraphs where the essay wasn’t of the same quality, and marked them with a red-coloured quill. After that, he graded the essay, circled it and stood up. He decided to take the pile of parchment with him to his room, so he didn’t have to order it, this late at night.
“Professor Malfoy? What are you doing here, with Ravenclaw students in tow?” Draco heard McGonagall say, before she appeared in his vision.
“So before you start thinking you can judge papa because of the scar on his forearm, you should think about the scar on his chest, and re-evaluate your opinion. Good day, Professor.”
Dean thanked him profusely for the high-quality paint set he had gotten, and Ginny grinned widely at the practice Quaffle. Angelina and Audrey appreciated their bath soaps and perfume. George got a wicked gleam in his eyes at seeing the
He was kneed in the guts, resulting in a painful groan. The directly following punch to his eye was enough to get Scorpius’s knees to buckle, and he fell down. His breaths were punched out of him. From the corners of his eyes, he tried to keep eye contact with his assaulter. Why was no one helping him? Why were all those strangers walking past like nothing was happening?
“Pansy is picking up Greg from the rehab centre, they’ll be here in a moment,” Potter told Draco, kissing the stuck-out lower lip fleetingly, and making Scorpius roll his eyes and Phi utter a disgusted sound.
When they walked back, Neville kept teasing him gently, but didn’t touch any topics that were too sensitive.
“And even if you could, I still wouldn’t want your help. Merlin knows the entire Slytherin House wanted your help when we most needed it, but then you couldn’t see us as human beings.”
But they were here now, and if they worked hard enough, Draco might have a working charm for his research project. And that was all that mattered.
“Oh, that’s easy. You know, in St. Mungo’s, there’s a floor with children who have problems with their accidental magic, and to protect them, the Healers have created magic vacuums. It’s like living in a Muggle neighbourhood, far away from everything magic. Together with some Curse Breakers, friends of my wife who have always been interested in creating new spells, we were able to adapt the vacuums in such a way, that we can control the amount of magic it lets through. It’s easily done, with just a simple spell.”
James nodded, visibly faltering and debating whether to leave or not. If he left, he would have to wait another few days before he could execute the task that was given him by the Project Malfoy-Potter meeting. And this opportunity of Amortentia was too good to miss. But it was embarrassing, standing here with near to no knowledge on potions, watching two experienced Slytherins stirring and adding to the liquid.
“Like any other family, I suppose. We did our things, we worked, and we enjoyed our meals together. There wasn’t anything special.”
“It’s really –“ Potter tried, but was interrupted by the soft, barely there touch of Draco’s fingertips at his jaw, not present enough to actually be called a touch, but not absent enough for Potter to ignore.
“That’s all right. As long as you make it out alive. And do you remember what you always told me, when I didn’t know what to do?”
“I don’t think everyone here is quite aware. Would you mind telling us, dear, what is your sexual orientation?”
Potter once followed me into the bathroom of Moaning Myrtle, who I used to talk to about everything. We were friends, of a kind. He found me crying there. As a defense mechanism, I tried to Crucio him, but I didn’t feel enough hate. He then cast a spell that he didn’t know the effects of. The scars on my chest are of that spell. If Severus hadn’t been there with loads of dittany and a counterspell, I would have bled to death.
were carried by Aquila and Scorpius, as Draco bowed a couple of times – the proper, pureblood kind of bow, obviously – before he quickly rounded the High Table and sat down on his designated spot beside Potter, who was laughing uncontrollably.
Minerva cleared her throat delicately, having stood up and frowning disapprovingly at the two Aurors. No doubt she used to teach them when they were still at Hogwarts; both of them shifted under her hard gaze.
Draco laughed and picked the Ball from her hands, since she was almost dropping it. “Anyone else who would like to try this Prophecy Ball? No? Anyone who would like to buy it? ‘Quila?”
Draco nodded slowly. “Who is the gay person in your circle, then? I don’t believe it is public knowledge that you have a gay friend. Otherwise, you would already be papped together more often than you and Ginny.”
Draco reluctantly took the bite, but a smile soon appeared at the taste. “Potter, did you use magic on this? This is far too good to be natural.”
Draco shot him a look. “Because I know who she hangs out with, and I know that her Gryffindor friends say such things. Her Slytherin friends wouldn’t dare do that, because I know their parents. It had nothing to do with prejudice, Potter. Don’t follow the tunnel you call your vision.”
“Enough to make it work properly with only one sip. I know you’re not stupid, Draco. I know you’d notice there was something wrong with it. But unfortunately for you, you will be completely under the serum’s influence within a few minutes.”
“If you agree, I can invite everyone that is remotely well-wishing towards you. If they want, they can speak and support your case.”
No. Never again. Draco opened his eyes, seeing Nagini just a few inches from his neck. Concentrating hard, he yelled, “
Draco nodded to himself when he let Potter in, and moved to the kitchenette to make Potter’s standard Firewhiskey on the rocks, while Potter himself walked into the living room. Draco saw Pansy stand up with lightning speed. She locked eyes with Potter and tension rapidly build. Draco was about to send Potter on his way, when the two offered their hands at the same time. Blaise, tipsy as he was, giggled, which made Pansy and Potter relax as they shook hands.
“Right, bother me with it, won’t you?” James grumbled jokingly. “Anyway, it has something to do with Albus, so to spare everyone’s feelings, I’d really like everyone to let me explain entirely, before interrupting.”
“Hermione – may I call you that? I would like to apologise. I know I have already done that, but that was right after everything happened, and it was more out of duty than anything else. Now, I just want you to know that I actually regret what I have done. I don’t expect you to forgive me, because I have also done things that can’t be accounted for by my upbringing. It is already more than generous of you to allow my mother in the board. She is most grateful for that.”
The most surprising thing came when he sat down, though. He ignored Potter’s inquisitive looks and shrugged of the hand that he put on Draco’s shoulder. Aquila gave him a pointed look towards the Gryffindor table, where James was sitting on the complete opposite end of the table than Keira and Arthur.
Ron wanted to go back to the shop, so he wouldn’t go upstairs with them. “I’ll tell Harry that you’re here. Let us know how it goes, yeah?” he asked quietly. Draco nodded. He went to turn to his children, who were huddled together and waiting for him, but took a few steps back and enveloped Ron in a tight hug.
The next movement was completely unexpected, and the Shield charm Draco cast, turned out to be useless.
“We’ve never been there,” Draco said sheepishly, feeling more than a little embarrassed at the admission.
Draco nodded at her. They shared another look of exasperated fondness when Miguel joked about having a Firewhiskey, but the moment Draco turned his back to move to the kitchenette, the conversation took another turn.
“No. Thank Merlin she doesn’t. Just… the bulk of my memories and thoughts from the moment of her birth have been conveyed to her. She sees things that have happened to me during the war or before, and sometimes she says things I used to say every day of my life.” Draco shrugged. “She once told me that sometimes, she thinks the most awful things about Muggleborns and the Weasleys, without meaning them. I have had to press on her that she doesn’t say them out loud.”
“Here we go,” Draco mumbled, showing James in. The instruments that were permanently placed in Merlin’s Office were still as he had left them before. James sat down on the piano bench, where Potter had sat before Draco had been admitted to the hospital.
Surprise flickered over Potter’s face, but it settled in a glimmer in his eyes when he hummed, agreeing. “I think I can convince the children of a summer-long sleepover. Though I hope you realise I won’t give up Grimmauld, even if we’re married.”
“They’re okay. Not much different than they have always been. It’s just easier to have someone I can go to with the worst of them.”
“Because we had grown apart, and I had fallen in love with someone else. It was better for both of us to separate.”
“Malfoy! Malfoy, wake up. I’ve got a surprise for you,” he grinned when Malfoy had pried his eyes open.
Startle, the flying instructor, put down two strong Muggle whiskies in front of them, saying something about a celebration, and turned away to drink his whiskies with Neville, Hellodorn and Parnarush. Potter smiled at his drink.
After dinner, the Slytherins were herded towards the dungeons, and the usual talk had been held by the Prefects. The students were scattering and finding spots in the common room, where they would spend the rest of their evening.
Then, Draco took his wand, sighed deeply and made a slow movement. With closed eyes and his other hand tightly squeezing Potter’s, he mumbled ‘
Scorpius had a Dark Mark on his forearm. How clear was it, how recognisable? How deep did the wound go? How much had he hurt? And Cassie? Had Terence and Priscus known about her bad arm, had she been severely hurt?
Draco chuckled. “It’s going to be a Valentine’s Ball, instead of a Yule Ball. They weren’t able to organise it in such a short period. Besides, the Yule Ball bears some unpleasant memories.”
One of the men hit Scorpius in the stomach, but there was barely a flinch. Scorpius just kept looking at the man with as much dignity as he could muster. Another hit, to his nose. The bone cracked loudly and Scorpius felt blood starting to trickle. Apart from the initial clenching of his fists, there was no reaction. Getting annoyed, the man started hitting repeatedly in his stomach and face. Scorpius doubled over but straightened up almost immediately to stare his opponent down.
The Malfoy, Potter and Weasley children, who had now started to call themselves the Order of the Unicorn, eventually came up with sixty-seven ideas to achieve their goal, all of which were wonderful and worth a shot.
“And Ophiuchus,” he said calmly, not bothering to turn around. “I don’t mind you being here. I would just appreciate you being honest about your whereabouts. So next time, tell me where you’re going and don’t lie, please.”
“That’s different. He’s Head of Slytherin House, the Slytherins are his. And Draco is very, very protective over what’s his. You don’t touch what’s his.” That was Pansy again. She rambled a bit.
“When did she tell you that? When did it come up in conversation?” Draco fired. He had stood up and was standing on the other side of the room, with his back turned to Potter. Potter recognised his too-relaxed-to-be-authentic posture as the hurt Phi had described.
“I don’t care about that. My sleep will be disturbed anyways; because of Cassie or because of myself. So don’t you dare worry about any of that. It’s my business.”
“But I already see it in my dreams. It can’t be worse than what I dream. Can it?” she asked, looking scared and so desperate to hear her papa deny the truth of her dreams. Draco wanted to punch himself. He wanted to do anything to take away any and every memory or dream Cassie had from those times. He would rather face Tom Riddle again than seeing his daughter struggle with the things she sees.
They Apparated to the front door of the event hall, where house-elves were darting around with broad smiles on their faces. The spacious ball room was decorated in blue and silver, a few posters with SPEW’s viewpoints explained in persuasive sentences.
After Potter assured her that it would be fine, they entered the Great Hall, being the last ones to take their place. Just as the food appeared on the tables and everyone’s attention was on their meal, the doors flew open and a burst of bright green and red firework sparkled in the door opening, restricting the view of who was behind it.
, Malfoy. Trust me, I do. But I’m in a dilemma. I have no idea what to do. Pureblood courtship rules dictate that we are not seen together until I have gained approval. But I am also not supposed to tell you whether or not I have spoken to your parents. What am I supposed to do then, Malfoy? Tell me.”
If you've got some time to spare, follow me on the Tumble door: i-am-and-proud. Drarry blog with an occasional poem of my own writing. I'm always open to messages and will answer as soon as I can.
“Monday. I told you about the potion in one of the letters, it had your DNA in it, and Pansy explained that my negative emotions were probably projected onto anything with your DNA, including your children, albeit less aggressive.”
The moment they entered the Great Hall, Draco was attacked by three of his children. Phi jumped on his back, Scorpius pulled on his arm and Cassie was running laps around him like a rabid dog.
“I don’t know if it will work, but it’s something. If I could just go in there, just to give him this potion, then we might not lose him.”
“Very kind of you to volunteer, James. Just get papa away from Mother, all right? Saying that the cauldrons have exploded will do.”
On his way downstairs, he saw Potter waiting to go up. He tried to ignore the man, but that was difficult, seeing as Potter had caught his wrist and was searching his gaze.
“What, you don’t like chocolate now?” Cassie joked. When she saw how pale he was, she got him a washcloth and a glass of water. “What is it, papa?”
Scorpius nodded pensively. “The last couple of months, she didn’t need my company during the full moon. I thought it was odd, but she was adamant that I stayed away. I wouldn’t be surprised to learn if there was someone else with her now.”
“I’m sure I don’t know who you are talking about,” Scorpius sniffed with his chin up in the air and a light smile around his lips.
A grin later, they were silent, both looking at Scorpius. Draco frowned at something, seemingly worried.
last year, you have used Legilimency on Mr. Harry James Potter, without gaining his explicit approval. Do you deny this?”
“You ready to talk about it, now?” he asked after twenty minutes, according to the old clock on his wall.
“Well, little sis, because he sometimes tries to draw me out, so I don’t slouch away in my seat and stop paying attention.”
“That’s because he had always been able to keep me and Fred apart. He is special, aren’t you,” George crooned, ruffling Potter’s hair.
Cassie too looked surprised, but then got a wicked grin while pouncing on the clothing cover with the second dress. “You bought us new dresses?”
“And I did not need to see this,” the robotic voice from the Firecall sounded, after which Lucius broke off the connection and loud laughter filled the room.
“You have the right to remain silent, but every question you decide not to answer may be used against you. Every question you do answer, may be used against you as well.”
“I didn’t know you two already were in a relationship,” Ron commented a few minutes later. Although Draco felt his stomach twist uncomfortably, Potter only chuckled. “I just like to cuddle with people,” he smiled at Ron, opening his eyes a bit. “Normally I’d do this with ‘Mione or Charlie, but you always complain that I’m stealing Hermione, and Draco is actually warm, as opposed to Charles.”
He went upstairs, where Phi was already reading peacefully. Draco had sent him up the moment they walked through the portrait. Phi looked up from where he sat on the bed and beamed.
“Let’s get to business,” he announced. “Your mother has arranged a barrister, and she refuses to tell us his hourly fee, so I’m sure he’s good. She said you might know him, Doctor Selaminder?”
. So we’ll celebrate that, of course. That’s all I know, really, because my parents don’t have fixed plans yet.”
“I want all of you to write the best Potions assignment you’ve ever written. I won’t give you a subject, you can choose whatever you want, as long as it is connected to potions and potioneering. If you don’t know where to start, I will give you a few suggestions.
“Oh, ten already? Will you get your letter this year or the next? Since your birthday is in the middle of the year, and all that.”
“I don’t know, but it can’t get worse than it is now, can it? Help me get papa sitting up, will you? Go sit behind him.”
“They approached me a year back. They said that they wanted to support all former Death Eaters, and try to protect them from prejudice or violence. Of course I joined them. But in order to ensure your protection, I had to help them protect others as well. ‘It isn’t a one-way street’, they said. So I functioned as a distraction while they beat people up, and then I was asked to break into a house and steal some stuff. Stuff that was supposedly stolen from Death Eater families. And then, I had to hold back children from people that were beaten. I’m so sorry, papa, I really am, but I thought it was a good cause! And I hate it now, I don’t want to be with them, but I don’t know what I can do!”
After an hour, he left the flea market with his pockets full of breakable stuff. A neat pocket watch for Blaise, a glass bauble that showed a more beautiful reflection for his Mother, a bottle of Elf wine from his father’s year of birth, and a rare sort of plant for Neville.
“Ah ah, but I am one of his children now, aren’t I? James Malfoy-Potter, at your service. Come on, please, Mr. Malfoy.
“It can be brought to the Manor. I will try to find a new home soon, but until then, the Manor will be fine.”
Raising an eyebrow, Draco opened the door wider to place a supporting hand on Greg’s shoulder. “It seems I have. Why don’t you get in?” When he was alone with Greg, he raked his gaze over his friend’s posture. “You look better, Greg.”
“I happen to think that gossip –or catching up with social events, as I like to call it– is very important in maintaining your reputation. Do you know how valuable the right information is when you try to make a good impression on someone?”
Molly seemed slightly miffed at being interrupted, but after a short glare, she continued her question.
“Ten points from Slytherin,” he said dryly. Both friends sat down in their chairs and grinned sheepishly at each other.
“Just speak your question loud and clear, and it will answer you. Go ahead, try,” the owner encouraged.
“Of course I bloo- Yes, I do.” Draco had to bite down his earlier sentence, because Phi was approaching again and smiled brightly.
“Even if she did, she didn’t need something that doesn’t even work properly,” George Weasley shrugged. He was accompanied by Ron Weasley and Potter. “Perhaps you should check some of the charms on it. It doesn’t bear in mind age, gender, preferences and habits of the questioner. Low craftsmanship, to be honest.”
“He doesn’t. He can’t forgive himself. Not for Rissa’s death, nor for anything else that happened in the war. That is why he doesn’t sleep.”
“You underestimate papa’s need for comfort. If it’s a good, attractive smell, why not keep it and sniff the neck, every once in a while? Amortentia is a perfect example of the connection between smell and attraction. If the hoodie is comfortable and smells good, I think papa would totally keep it and preserve the scent,” Cassie stated with conviction. She saw she had practically convinced Scorpius of it.
“I’m worried about him. I get this feeling that something is going to happen, something that he won’t be able to handle. Something that will ruin him, maybe break him.”
Draco started to panic. He put down Phi, shooed all three of them to the window of some shop and turned around. “You three
Right before dinner, everyone changed in their Weasley jumpers, including Molly. She grinned proudly whenever someone looked at it and thanked Draco multiple times.
“Good,” Draco nodded, having an idea of who that student might be. “You know them, Terence and Priscus. Today, I walked into the Slytherin common room and found a student crying. Lucia Lilacia. As it turns out, these boys lured her into one of the bathrooms and thrown toilet water all over her. Her clothes and books are soaked and smell. When I went to the Ravenclaw Tower to ask them about it, I heard from their Housemates that they do this regularly. To be precise, they have done this ever since they started to attend Hogwarts, and only to Slytherin first-years. I thought it might be time to stop this nonsense.”
The Healer assured him that it wasn’t, after which they left the hospital. Draco quick-ordered a Portkey back to Hogsmeade. It was just after curfew when they arrived at Hogwarts, McGonagall frowning disapprovingly at them until she noticed their dejected expressions and the absence of Scorpius.
“So you Conjured Nagini? You threw the war right in his face, in front of his children. You showed him that you still don’t see he is a good guy!”
After dinner, it was –finally- time for presents. They gathered round the tree, James on the floor to choose which gifts to go next. He started with a present for Ophiuchus, one that Draco didn’t recognise. Potter, next to him, was doing a terrible job of hiding his pleased smile when Phi burst out laughing after tearing the wrapping paper apart. It was a calendar called ‘Handbook for the Metamorphmagus Wizards and Witches,’ in which every day held an anecdote of metamorphmaguses.
“Scorp, you realise that it’s for the better, that he doesn’t fight. It’s better this way,” the second –obviously Potter’s- voice sounded. Scorpius mumbled something Draco didn’t hear, but it made Potter chuckle. “You should talk to him about this, not to me.”
“They said it was people that bullied Death Eater families, but I… I think they attacked Death Eater families instead of protected them.”
Draco laughed and walked to the bedroom. He moved silently, to not wake up his son, but Phi turned out to be absent. Draco frowned, but assumed Phi had gone to Scorpius or Cassie, since it was already eight o’clock.
Sighing fake-exasperatedly, Draco settled more comfortably in his chair and started talking, absently taking the cup of tea Potter had brought him.
Draco sighed. “We know in which direction to look. We know what to look for. We know their background. We only need the evidence.”
Draco inclined his head, took her hand and kissed it lightly. “Aunt Andromeda. It’s a pleasure meeting you.”
“How are you, dear?” Blaise asked with the tender warmness that always creeped through his aloof voice. Draco ushered them to his sofa and sat down next to them.
“Hi Pansy and Blaise, hi Mr. Harry, hi papa! Papa, can I stay up some longer today? It’s Sunday, it’s still weekend. Please?”
Potter opened the box and freed the Snitch. It had a beautiful glow around, shiny and a proper golden colour. The men agreed that it glowed well enough, and Potter spoke the spell that would allow the Snitch to zoom away. Right after, Draco mounted his broom and kicked off. He was in the air and chasing the faint light, far before Potter had even got a good grip on his broomstick.
“You know,” Potter started conversationally. “The Sorting Hat wanted to put me in Slytherin.” He grinned now, happy to be able to surprise Draco like this. His face fell when Draco seemed undisturbed.
children were targeted, and this year we got together. Obviously. That’s the first thing I wanted to say. Secondly, I’m really glad that you are here with me. I used the threats as an excuse to get you here, although I’m happy that I can keep an eye on you lot, but even if we hadn’t been in this situation, I would have wanted you here. I was just thinking of ways to ask you. Ever since Christmas break, I have been wondering how this house would sound and look like with you in it. Thirdly, I love you and please just put the ring on.”
Draco was beginning to get worried. Had his intuition been right about Cassie’s behaviour the last year? Was there something terribly wrong?
Draco smirked. “Well, we were brewing a potion with fifth-years. And I noticed that many of them made stupid mistakes, things a second-year should already be able to do well. So I told them to write an essay. One good essay on brewing will usually help them with small inaccuracies, I’ve explained that to you a few times.” Pansy nodded for him to continue.
“They’re your good robes as well, papa. You gave up your good robes to Professor Potter?” Aquila grinned.
Draco quickly turned around to put a hand on Potter’s mouth. “Are you crazy? I know they’ll know soon enough, but if we tell them now, they won’t sleep until they’ve tortured us for hours!”
Draco looked up at the ceiling, which showed small snowflakes falling down. “Well… First of all, she is the most dramatic. You should see her when she doesn’t get her way. And she’s quite sneaky, and sharp. She can be nasty, like, actually
That night, Draco couldn’t sleep. He was restless, tossing and turning in his bed, afraid to wake up Phi with his sighs and yawns. He was so tired, he couldn’t keep his eyes open, but he couldn’t fall asleep either. Purgatory. That’s what it was.
Potter smiled at him. “Malfoy. I have something for you. A little Christmas present. I thought I owed you.”
Draco frowned. “Love, you really don’t need to be able to produce a Patronus yet. You’re only a third year!”
“Yes. I was blinded by love. If I had been thinking clearly, I had known that leaving them with Draco wasn’t the right decision.”
Cassie, Lily, Aquila, Roxane and Dominique were standing in front of Draco and Potter. Scorpius, Albus, James, Lucy and Louis were heading their way as well.
Right at that moment, a whooshing sound could be heard, and a blue light illuminated the cell. It was an eagle, majestic and strong, landing gracefully on the edge of Draco’s bed. To be exact, it was an eagle Patronus.
“Hi, papa! I was reading your book about Potions. What are mandrakes?” Draco grinned. “Oh, Phi, I wouldn’t want to bore you with that.”
And now he was standing beside his bed, with his illegally acquired wand in his hand. It was a children’s wand, given, but illegal it was. With a soft “Accio”, he summoned the box in his hand. It was dusty and filthy. A gentle cleaning spell was cast over it. His finger traced the edges of the wood. He didn’t know what kind of wood his wand was, but it was just as dark as the Ebony box. He loved the colour.
James nodded in understanding, but the smugness didn’t leave his face. “You’ll want to read my essay earlier than that.” He stood up to leave the room, but paused at the door, already halfway through the opening.
First of all, Potter had never had a relationship with a man, although he couldn’t imagine it was very different from a relationship with a woman. But the
After the musical, Potter led him to the Thames, where a small boat was waiting for them. There was a bottle of red wine and a cheese plate on the small table. Potter easily got the boat moving, after which they drifted along the London shores, enjoying the lights of the city and its monuments.
Draco didn’t react when Potter pushed the mug in his hands. Only when Potter sat down, Draco leaned over to him.
“Yes, very well done,” he answered. His tone was icy, and made Phi turn around. His eyes widened slightly, not very noticeably, and he looked at his father for a second.
“We need to move her to St. Mungo’s right away. There is still something we can do, but it has to be done quick. Mr. Malfoy, please join me. The rest of you will be notified when you can visit.”
The woman tutted. “That last part wasn’t agreed on, yet. But okay, here we go. We’ll start easy. What’s your name?”
Draco laughed. “The most stubborn and thick-headed is a bit too old for her, I think. He’s more my age,” he complained, Theresa grinning at him.
When he left, Aquila had dragged Phi back to Matias and Cassie was searching through her bag, Scorpius and Albus bent towards each other.
“Oh, don’t worry, sweetheart. I don’t mean it like that. I have a lot of faith in you, I actually think you can do very great things. And your children too. They are a bunch of bright, ambitious young adults. You’ve raised them well.”
“I’m not finished yet. It seems like I am the only who keeps his head clear. I don’t fight, I still sleep properly, I’m not angry and I don’t study my arse off. I keep normal. And that’s not really like you.”
While they were singing the last two verses, all five of them were dancing and jumping around, even Draco himself. He indulged in these little joys from time to time. On the top of his lungs, he belted out the last sentences, including some idiotic dance steps that got Cassie laughing like a madman.
Hiya! I'm so so sorry for being late, but last few weeks I was too tired to spend my evenings writing. From now on, I'll try to upload every Saturday. Please leave comments if you have something to say, because I love reading what you think. Thanks!!
The lengths to which Draco was willing to go for his children, was remarkable, if he said so himself.
“DNA, isn’t it? Just like Polyjuice, you put a bit of someone’s DNA in there, like a lock of hair, and you fall in love with that DNA or start hating them,” a Ravenclaw called. Draco recognised her as a girl with whom Aquila had a longstanding rivalry, because they both wanted to be the best of their year. Aquila had assured Draco that it was all in good fun, though.
“Good call. Why do you always melt chocolate before giving it to me? You could just buy me a bar, and I would be just as satisfied.”
“We’ll be at the Department of Mysteries, Cassie. You can’t just get in there, let alone while carrying dungbombs or firecrackers. They won’t allow it.”
“Papa,” she said weakly, slightly muffled by Draco’s shirt, in which she had buried her face. Draco nodded, although Cassie couldn’t see him.
When Narcissa looked up from the paper, she saw that Draco was smiling slightly, which wasn’t surprising. What
“They are all right, I suppose. Too bad it’s silk. Silk is a difficult fabric, you shouldn’t wear it any and every day.”
Euripideia nodded, scanning his face for any signs. He kept it impassive, even though he tried to reach out for Cassie and couldn’t find her.
“Perhaps. If you could explain it in a letter, it will be fine. And ignore Father, he’ll be in a strop about not seeing Phi or Aquila.”
“Cassie!” he yelled as soon as the other three came in view. “Run to the Weasley’s shop, they must still be open! I need to use the Floo.” At Cassie’s hesitation, he made a violent movement with his head to urge her on. “
If he were himself, would Potter give him a chance? Draco doesn’t care about anyone else. If only Potter would, he would be happy. If only he would get that bloody handshake.
“Okay. All right.” He set up the cauldron and opened the book at the right page. “The incantation, that stands for the spell itself, so the effects of the incantation are weakening some part of the human body. To counter that, we need a strengthening ingredient, something like unicorn blood or Motherwort. Or both, really, because unicorn blood keeps a person alive, and Motherwort has healing remedies.”
“Hold on. A few weeks back, a package was delivered at the Lodge, and Mother picked it up for me. Can you ask her to give it to my children and let it be put in my bedroom at Hogwarts?” Draco asked before the door closed behind his friends.
“Can’t. We’re not allowed to let students help us in classes, because that would give them too much responsibility over other student’s wellbeing.”
“I have many happy memories with him. He was just blinded by his own ambitions, and didn’t listen to the rationality that was my mother. He still won’t. It’s a bad Malfoy trait.”
“Do you know what my father said after Potter had gone for permission to court me?” Draco asked, smiling. “He said, and I quote: ‘Well, that explains your life-long obsession,’ and that was it! Never anything else. Every interaction Potter and I have ever had, are now being turned into some sappy love story of pining and repressed feelings. It’s idiotic.”
This brought a slight smile on Draco’s face. Albus smiled as well, moving towards the door. Right before he closed it, though, Draco called him back. He knew why McGonagall had done what Draco had suggested and why she had expelled the boys. A proper response was in order.
“What did you mean with how I looked at George that time at the Wheezes?” Draco asked then, hesitantly.
Draco grumbled, turning his back on Harry. He quickly stuck his bare feet in socks and sensible shoes, before moving to leave the room. He was held back by Harry gripping his wrist and pulling him into an embrace.
“The east wing consists of private quarters. The west wing, however, contains the library, a wine and whiskey storage, and portrait galleries. We will start with the storage. As you may realise, this is not merely a cellar with some alcoholic drinks. It’s a collection of rare, special or old examples from probably the best distilleries in the world. Not only is it a private enjoyment, but our collection is also known amongst experts.”
“She was a second-year,” Draco started. Scorpius was right, he needed to know the details. It just – the story Draco had told Pansy and Blaise all those years ago, wasn’t the entire truth.
Scorpius slammed his hand on the table. “What? No! How dare she? Albus, why are you so calm, why aren’t you angry, why –“
As you might know, tonight is a small event-meeting of SPEW. Since I am in the board, I am required to attend, but I do not wish to go alone. Would you be able to accompany me? If I do not receive a cancelation before 15.00 hours today, I will assume that I can expect you at 18.00 hours at the Manor.
Also, I'm ill. I feel like shit. I need sympathy. Give me sympathy. Give me love. Give me hugs. (Or chocolate. Chocolate works too). I'm really pitiful. *poutpout*
“Draco Lucius Malfoy. You are charged with domestic abuse and mistreatment of your children, especially your oldest son, Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy, aged fourteen years. From research, we have concluded that these charges form a pattern with earlier crimes. We have sufficient Pensieve proof and eyewitness statements to believe that you are guilty.”
“We kept it hush hush, told people who asked that the Carrows had done something to her. It was a common enough occurrence, so no one really payed it any mind. Especially because she was so silent and remained unseen by most of the student body. But it left Draco haunted, terrified.”
The ‘old gang’ consisted of the required Gryffindors, Harry, Hermione, Ron, Seamus, Dean, Ginny, Parvati Patil and Lee Jordan, and Neville of course. Then there was Hannah who represented the Hufflepuffs, together with Susan Bones. The Ravenclaws present were Luna and Padma Patil. Pansy, Greg, Blaise, Theo and Draco were the Slytherin counterparts for this evening.
“Now, Draco. I hear you’ve been looking into us,” the woman – where did he recognise that voice from? – said, looking down at the ground in a faux-coy manner. “Do you by any chance know who you’re dealing with?”
“I must come from me then. And since James is working harder for you than for any other teacher, ever, I assume this gene of mine must be dominant.”
Cassie hesitated for a moment, but sat down at a table in the first row. When she started talking, her voice was wavering a bit.
“Don’t you worry, Professor Potter. I’m right here,” Draco decided to make his presence known. Potter turned around to see him there and smiled crookedly.
Blaise giggled at Pansy’s comment and pointed out that Draco was already using the word ‘obviously’ in the same denigrating manner as Severus did, which made Pansy laugh as well. Potter stayed silent. When Draco caught his gaze, they smiled at each other, a bit awkwardly and a bit warmly.
“Yes, I remember, Dragon boy. ‘Oh, father, he wore the ugliest robes. They didn’t match his looks at all,’” Pansy imitated Draco with a high-pitched, whiny voice.
But Draco didn’t respond. The day had cost him too much energy, with the amount of tears he had seen, and the anger, and the fear, and the stories he had had to tell Cassie about his past.
“Merlin, it’s been so long since the war. We’ve changed so much. All of us. It’s ridiculous to realise how much time has passed and everything that has happened since then. You’re in a relationship with Harry James Potter now, who would’ve thought?” Greg grinned.
“And she, being who she is, jumped at the opportunity to save you. They chose the right child for this.”
“I haven’t tested it yet. I would like to, if I have your permission. But it doesn’t matter if it works. I told you, it’s about the research and the amount of work. But if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to break my fast. You did well, James, and I can’t stress that enough. I’m impressed.”
“I don’t know. I get the idea he is withholding his anger. Perhaps he’s blaming himself, and it’s eating him up.”
Draco hesitated whether he should tell his mother, but then shook his head. “Nothing to worry about, Mother. I just need to ask the Minister for something. I will see you when you and father come back from France.” He kissed her cheek in goodbye, and ignored Narcissa’s questioning sigh.
While Cassie started running –with her daily Quidditch practice, strong build and energetic behaviour, she had by far the highest speed of them all- Aquila and Phi came in action as well. Working together splendidly, they parted the crowd of human bodies for their papa to go through.
“No problem at all, sir. About the next appointment, I can fit you in in six weeks from now, and then I will have enough time to have a long conversation with you. If you are fine with a shorter appointment, we can meet in two weeks from now, in July. What do you say?”
“But, dearest, little devil that you are, you could easily get into Gryffindor. You try to be brave, right? You would sacrifice yourself for others, if you’d think it was the right thing to do.”
“It seems we’ll take the invitation,” he grinned. Potter only nodded and started talking to James, trying to hide his smile.
“I do wonder, sometimes, about you and my father. He never told me anything, and your children seem to know everything. It’s unfair.”
Draco eyed the box that indeed held many different flavours, most of which he didn’t know. While he was trying to make a decision, Potter joined him and easily picked one flavour, digging through the multitude of tea bags to reach the lowest one.
Now he not only had to fix dresses for his daughters, but also find something presentable for himself to wear.
Potter seemed to mull these words over in his head. When he looked up, Cassie was smiling at him expectantly.
Draco shook his head lightly. “Don’t worry about it. I have never mistreated either of them. I know that if everything is done properly, there is nothing I should be afraid of.”
What I saw and did, got progressively worse. I saw one of my teachers die at the hand of a casual Killing Curse, and I did nothing. I joined in raids of houses of Muggleborn wizards. I tortured so-called blood traitors. And I stood by and watched other people be burnt to death. All because I didn’t see a way out.”
Phi frowned. “Well, it could be this year, but papa says I shouldn’t expect it, because then I can get disappointed.”
“Hiya Malfoy! Christmas shopping again?” Potter asked excitedly. “I am so looking forward to Christmas! Man, I haven’t been this impatient for Christmas to begin since the first time I would spend Christmas with the Weasleys.”
Potter and Draco had sat together one evening, to reconnect after the three weeks of stress. They shared a bar of chocolate – milk, because it had been Potter’s turn to choose – and gulped down litres of tea before they switched to the Butterbeer.
But no, no one would think any good of Draco. So flirting with Potter was the worst thing Draco could be doing at this moment.
“And next year, I will go to Hogwarts as well, with all my siblings. I wonder in what house I’ll be Sorted!”
“And now we get to the heart of the case. Is Mr. Malfoy in his right mind, or has he somehow become a madman?”
Albus caught Draco’s eye and smiled incredibly, indicating that something rather good was happening at that moment.
Draco nodded. “We’ll be fine. Wait, what do you mean, Suzanne cursed you? What kind of curse was it?”
He was silent and seemed to hesitate to say something. Draco suspected it was about their schooldays. He took a deep breath and started talking.
“Yes, I would say the same. But there is something else. You know how certain enhancers can be illegal and dangerous?” Zarnel nodded again.
Even though Draco hadn’t meant it as a challenge, Potter certainly took it that way and pushed himself flush against Draco’s chest. Draco responded with a chuckle. His legs were placed distinctly unnatural, right on top of each other, so he wriggled one of them between Potter’s and snuggled further under the blankets. A lazy wave of his hand showed an alarm clock set for eight thirty the next morning.
With a frown, Scorpius answered, “To be quite honest with you, papa has never punished us at all. We just get a disappointed look and a lecture about responsibility or propriety or safety or something like that.”
“You panicked and did what you thought had the best chance in succeeding. As I keep saying, you’re an idiot, but we all love you anyway.”
A week later, it was the last day before Christmas holiday would start. Draco was very much stressed. It was the twentieth already, and he still didn’t have presents for everyone. He had bought Cassie a chocolate making set, Ginny a special, fancy kind of Quaffle to practice, a pair of expensive high heels for Pansy and some perfumes and bath soaps for the wives of George and Percy. He had been able to buy a book ‘Potions and Pranks’ for George and a book of the greatest wizards of Wizarding history for Percy. He was also quite proud of his present for Dean Thomas; high-quality paint for his artistic hobbies.
“Albus!” Manila mock-imitated him. “If they’ve already got her, it’s done. All right? If they have your sister and your father, I’m useless. Let it go. They’ll come back to you, alive, with maybe only a scratch here and there.”
Right before Draco would turn the corner that would lead to the Great Hall, he stopped and took a few deep breaths. He raised his chin and adopted the proudest expression he could muster without seeming smug and arrogant. When he entered the Great Hall, he refused to make eye contact with anyone that wasn’t his flesh and blood, and calmly walked up to the High Table. Ophiuchus trailed behind him, gaze pointed to the floor in front of him and shoulders slumped.
Sitting up in a flash, Draco seemed to brighten. “Of course! Yes, we’ll be organising something for them.” He scurried around the room to change in presentable clothes and moved to the kitchenette. “I’ll bake a cake. Cassie, do you know where the decorations are? You and Phi can start decorating the apartment.”
“It isn’t over!” Longbottom yells. With a sharp zing, the Sword of Gryffindor is pulled out of the hat. At the same time, a loud boff echoes between the walls. Stupid, clumsy Hagrid dropped Potter’s body. What does he think he’s doing? Trying to help Longbottom out of the mess he made for himself?
It was a long silence that ensued. Draco carefully picked up the wand and curled his fingers around it. It felt good.
“Silence, please!” a booming voice sounded inside Courtroom One. Draco was standing outside the doors with four guards around him. When the door opened, five hundred pairs of eyes landed on him in a deafening silence, and Draco knew not even ten percent was benevolent to him.
“Of course, of course! Perhaps it would also be nice for your children to see Grimmauld Place. After all, it is Black heritage, isn’t it?”
you?” Potter exclaimed in the echoing hallway. He hesitated whether he should walk down the corridor and see where it led, but eventually decided against it. The Marauder’s Map did not show this hallway at all, and he wasn’t sure of finding his way back if there turned out to be many twists and turns. But, seeing as Draco most certainly knew how to find it and had apparently lived here for the past couple of days, Potter Accio’ed parchment and a quill and scribbled a quick note.
“It kills me to think that his last words were in order to impress or frighten you. It wasn’t something I could tell his parents, it wasn’t a cry for help, it wasn’t
Rose’s eyes got a mischievous glimmer. “Of course I can convince them. We really are going to get them together?”
“Nope. Okay, I’ll explain. With the ‘Saviour Swoon’, we mean that there are a lot of people that start swooning and drooling and sucking up to Harry, right? They get nervous, and kind, and all they want is a smile from the Boy-Who-Lived.”
The house itself looked a bit like the Malfoy Manor, but it had many differences. For one, it was much smaller. It was still a sizeable home, even with four children, but it was definitely not a manor. It could be called a villa, or perhaps a holiday cottage of the richer kind.
“Very well. Why did you ask?” Draco relented at a certain point, where both had gotten uncomfortable with the silence during such a difficult conversation.
Potter smiled faintly, but the frown didn’t leave his expression. “How is he holding up, after the incident with Phi?”
From the corner of his eyes, Draco saw that Hermione was frowning heavily and whispering to some Auror guards. He didn’t turn his head to look at them, because Cassie was staring at him with an expression that told him she needed the contact they had. It worried Draco, how ill Cassie looked.
“Especially then. Potter, I don’t hold people’s hands without reason. I loved the way we were sitting then, with my children and yours around us and your friends and family.”
“You either be his friend, and let him in completely, or you walk away now. There is no in between. I will personally make sure you will regret it if you keep him dangling. All or nothing, that’s your choice.”
“Ron! I’ve got your Chocolate Frog card! I actually have a couple of them. And your wife, too. We really are in awe of what she pulled off with SPEW, it’s a very good cause. Grandmother is in the board, do you know?” he rattled.
Potter only laughed harder, holding up three WMD’s of High School Musical. Draco cleared his throat and tried to grab the WMD’s from Potter, but couldn’t move fast enough because of the tea. Before he could put the tea down and gain hold of the WMD’s, Potter had already cast the spell that would start playing the songs.
Draco was afraid to open his eyes again and took his sweet time. He was the last one to open his eyes. Everyone had raised their hands, even – Draco laughed – the Potter and Malfoy children. Cassie had decided to stand on her chair, to make sure her hand was the highest.
“I’m sure they won’t. They’ll appreciate the effort. Besides, it’s not like they know exactly what a Muggle Christmas looks like.”
“Yes, you were very disappointed,” Blaise smiled. “I remember. You cried for six whole days when he broke up with you.”
“Sometimes, Cassie drives me crazy,” he admitted with a grin. “She is so wild, it’s a miracle she’s still alive and well. Her energy is just too much sometimes. But other times it really lifts the mood.”
“Mr. Potter. What a pleasure to see you,” Narcissa smiled tightly, rising from her seat. Potter took her offered hand and shook it lightly, before turning to Lucius and exchanging a nod.
“The teachers will show you what Defense can be good for and how to use it right. You can also see what a duel will look like. Now, are there two professors who would like to start?”
“I told her how we, at the start of the war, when everything was the most dangerous, the most vicious, met in a bathroom and how we both made a mistake and tried to cast awful spells. I said you used a spell that you didn’t know the result off, and cut me open by accident. Then I skipped the bloody part, explained how Severus had healed me, but how he hadn’t been quick enough to prevent scarring. I stressed that I didn’t feel anything anymore, and that it wasn’t as bad as it looked. I think she understood that the circumstances made your reaction excusable, but she also seemed to sense that I neglected to tell her the real effect of the spell. She never asked about it, though.”
They stared at one another, after which James continued in a quieter tone. “My aunts and uncles, and grandparents, and my cousins most of all, would fight for you, always. Teddy keeps asking when you get back to another family event, because he feels you are the closest he will ever get to his real parents. We all love you so much, and you just… You just don’t have faith in us.”
“Come on, I’ll Apparate you to Hogsmeade. No time to dally! You’ll want to be back and settled in before dinner,” Pansy replied, holding her arm out for him to take.
“Father,” Draco greeted with a hoarse voice. Frowning lightly, Draco cleared his throat and tried again, but there was barely any improvement. The heart monitoring charm started beeping at a higher tone, probably indicating that Draco’s heart was doing odd things, and Draco sighed and leant back.
“I cannot tell you. That might lead to you making up situations. I’m sorry, I don’t make the rules.”
Shrugging, Draco took Potter’s hand, getting in the position to lead. “When did you learn how to dance?”
“My first question is, what’s up? With the trials and now this attack, someone must have a target on your back. What’s going on?” Pansy started.
“Yes,” Draco said, not sure whether he was confirming the statement of answering the unsaid question.
Potter’s eyes sparked with something like accomplishment. “A few weeks back, that wouldn’t have been the craziest thing to ask.”
“Of course. I always do,” Scorpius returned. When he let go, his place was immediately taken by Aquila, who kissed Draco on his cheek. Phi hugged both Draco and Potter, remaining close with James afterwards, and Cassie refused to leave Draco’s side.
“James,” Draco sighed. “I don’t know if you’ve realised, but I really have no experience with the female species.”
“Malfoy!” Potter greeted, going in for a tight hug. The Auror guard cleared his throat pointedly to keep them separated.
Cassie sat up, threw Draco a meaningful look and smiled at her siblings. Draco swallowed, letting the Healer leave before he announced he had something to say. His children surrounded his bed, Phi sitting against the headboard, Scorpius standing at his feet and his daughters flanking his sides.
“It isn’t difficult, Potter, it’s just two words. Shut. Up. Now, where was I? Right. I suppose you didn’t find the little note I left you on my nightstand in the hospital. If you had, you would have mentioned it by now. Apart from the letter, I had written a hasty note for you, which said that you should ask Harky for the package that had arrived at the Lodge when I was in jail before my trials. The package was a collection of wooden planks. That might not mean much to you, but it does to me. You see, in the year 1798, my Malfoy ancestor, Gerhbrandus, bought a batch of wood for his ‘close friend’ Leehart. Even though the Malfoy archives don’t mention it, there is a letter from Gerhbrandus to Leehart, presenting the batch of wood to him with the following words:
Ms. Euripideia pursed her lips. “I can take a look for you. We will have to make a new appointment to have you view the prophecy. The Balls cannot leave or storage.”
Draco looked at the Slytherin table. Aquila, Cassie and Phi were huddled together, with Matias and Albus close by. The Gryffindor Potters and Weasleys had probably been updated, since they were also less loud than usual. Suzanne was sitting next to James, smiling compassionately at him and the Slytherin table.
The moment he stepped into Hogwarts, Potter called his name in surprise. Draco pulled the Scrivenshaft’s bag a bit closer to himself and arched an eyebrow at Potter.
spell to counter, and warned them that there was barely any information to be found on the spell in the Hogwarts library.
“Papa has told me everything about them. He admired them, he says.” Draco clenches his hand again. This wasn’t going so well. Phi was far too sharable for Draco’s liking. Draco also felt Potter’s gaze on his profile. “And papa wants us to know every detail about the Battle, because we can learn from it.”
When the door closed, Potter kept looking at it and frowned. Pansy softly touched his arm to catch his attention.
“But none of Greyback’s victims have been inheritably changed. Teddy Lupin is no werewolf. None of the children are werewolves. That student of yours… if they really are a werewolf, their story is fake. Didn’t you know?”
“Okay,” George agreed. “Then you won’t be devastated if I say that I still think you were a prat, back in the days?”
“I’ve got another guest room at the boys’s hallway. I suspect I can trust you, with two of your daughters sleeping in the same room, and all that.” Potter sent Draco a wide smile. “And I just thought you would like to be close to Cassie, in case she got a nightmare.”
“Yes. This is part procedure, because those prophecies may have been charmed to cast a spell on whoever’s not part of the family, and may cause Ministry problems, you know how it is. But it is also part of the paperwork your father has filed in order to protect the family prophecy. You see, he has filed all kinds of requests for the prophecy not being allowed to be seen unless a direct family member is present. Therefore, even if the prophecy hadn’t been protected by Ministry procedures, we would not be able to retrieve it for you unless you or your father would join.”
Potter cleared his throat. “I’ll just pretend I don’t know what you are talking about, shall I? Shouldn’t you go to bed, Phi?”
Almost everyone had their hands up: Molly, Arthur, Narcissa, Bill, Charlie, George, Angelina, Ron and Hermione. Most looked a bit uncertain, others were completely calm. Draco locked eyes with his mother and raised his hand as well.
“It seems every song I dedicated to you is a sort of goodbye for a moment like this, isn’t it?” Draco remarked wryly.
Cassie laughed. “I thought you wouldn’t mind as much, seeing as you never sleep very deep or very late. You aren’t angry, are you?”
“Of course, because that was such a difficult thing to find out. However, I would still call it an obsessions. And I am willing to ask your friends what they called it,” Draco challenged, at the same time trying to convey he was merely bantering.
Good. Tonight, Draco would make a start in ordering the paperwork Neville had given him. He was looking forward to it.
Potter resisted, but sighed in defeat and lied his hand down on the table. Draco folded his palm open, turning his hand to the light so he could see clearly.
Blaise looked offended, “You came to him as well, didn’t you?” but Pansy’s expression softened immensely.
“No. No, I wasn’t telling you who I like. You heard the Veritaserum, I’ve never been in love with someone before.”
to be. I’m trying to act differently, especially now that I have children. I don’t want them to make the same mistakes I made. But that’s exactly it.
“Cassie is no regular twelve-year-old. She is highly capable of unlocking charms and she is extremely sensitive to magic. She would have felt what kind of spells were placed, and she only needs a couple of days to undo them all.”
“Ugh no, Slytherin is so much better.” Albus turned up his nose at his cousins, who were starting to argue.
“As I said, my mother was, is, very good. Keepers need a lot of skill in flying and balance. It a matter of control. And may I say, everyone who has seen my mother knows that she has full control over everything around her.”
“They’ve been talking about him insistently. Telling me about his mannerisms, telling me all these stories where he helped them with something, or where he made a joke. They were trying to set us up.”
During this talk, Draco had paled considerably. McGonagall frowned deeper again. “Why don’t you take a seat, Professor Malfoy? Is there something you ought to tell me?”
“So what happened? Just a few days ago, they were super close and laughing and living in their own bubble, and now Professor Malfoy is turning on the cold showers.”
It was silent in the room. Ophiuchus was –hopefully- sleeping peacefully in his own bed, and Potter didn’t make a sound. He buried his head in Draco’s chest, curling himself up to become a tiny pile of human, and pressed as close as possible. He had pulled his legs up on the sofa and had tucked them under him. Draco looked at him, truly looked, and saw nothing more than a man who had seen and heard too much to stay sane. He had met many people with nightmares, but never had he talked to someone who might dream of the same inhumane and ghastly horrid things he dreamt of.
“Well,” Potter seemed to think for a second, studying Draco’s features. “Let’s start simply. I like your hair.” He trailed a hand through Draco hair, twisting it around his fingers and tugging softly, before moving on to the rest of Draco’s face.
“No, he won’t like that. It’ll be too fake. You know he hates fake,” Greg protested. “Blaise is right, although his reasoning isn’t. We can’t do anything, except make sure that people don’t walk out on him. I think he needs reassurance that we’re still with him.”
“Aquila is calm as always, though she spends most of her time reading up on the Patronus Charm. I hope you won’t get angry, but I helped her practicing. She already managed an incorporeal one two days back.”
“Potter, listen to me. You don’t want to hear this, and you won’t believe me, but I’m going to tell you anyway.” Draco had decided for the only other option he had. Play it hard, but clear.
“Two friends of ours,” Scorpius lied without missing a beat. “They are in love, but they don’t know it yet. Anyway, what do you think of our decorations?”
“Who brought you this? Because if it would have been your children, or your friends, I would have known. Right? And I can’t imagine your
“I don’t suppose you know how it is to live without food or clothes, do you? So many people, either Slytherins who have been cleared from trials, or ex-prisoners who have served their sentences, live on the streets with nothing to live from. Their wands have been taken when they entered Azkaban, and most of them didn’t get it back when they left, even though that’s the law. Most of them don’t have enough money to buy a new one and get a job. So really, it’s good to know that a person with influence, like you, cares for fairness in this world, but doesn’t give two shits about those people at Knockturn Alley,” Draco seethed. He kept his expression under control and refused to look at Potter while he spoke.
Salazar, he worried too much. First, the summer. No, first the N.E.W.T.s. There was no reason to think of anything beyond, yet.
At the end of the story, Draco’s eyes were glazed with confusion, mouth slightly open in his effort to understand.
“Who was it from? What did it say? What was the handwriting like?” Potter fired, immediately in his Auror mode.
“Two years ago, they started following me. One person in particular. One woman in all-black clothing, never saw her face. Ehm, it’s probably the reason Phi became an Animagus. Perhaps even why he has had so much trouble with controlling his magic. Terence Goldstein, you know, that Ravenclaw, he’s the son of Anthony Goldstein, who is part of this movement to get rid of all Death Eaters. Terence’s hate of all things Slytherin is because of Anthony. Priscus, Keira and Arthur are probably part of it too, just like Theresa. Most likely, there is someone of the movement working at
It took only a short moment before the door opened and the same house elf ushered him to one of the drawing rooms. It was a formal space, clearly designed for unexpected visits; no personal belongings, no paintings, but elegant furniture and a lot of natural light flowing in through the large windows. Narcissa was seated in the light, reading, while Lucius was stood next to the fireplace, facing Potter when he entered. It was obvious that they hadn’t been sitting here before Potter had called; they had moved to present the perfect picture for him.
In the end, it worked out well enough, but they were five minutes late already. Draco only hoped that Potter was even later.
“I’ll help you, but only because you are clearly not going to leave me alone if I refuse. You owe me after tomorrow, Potter. Don’t forget that.”
“Yes, you can. Make it subtle, yeah? Those who work at the Ministry are trained to see through the most complicated invisibility spells. You’ll have to be creative.”
if you haven’t guessed correctly today, we will never speak of it again,” Draco demanded. With a smile, Potter nodded.
This resulted in a loud bark of laughter. The murmurings in the Great Hall silenced a bit, but picked up soon enough. Draco heard one very familiar laugh ring through the buzz of the talk, so he sent a glance in Aquila’s direction.
enough to not get angry when Potter waltzed into his office like that, made the grin annoyingly persistent. Although, by now it shouldn’t be a surprise anymore, that Draco liked him. It’s been made quite obvious over the last few weeks.
Potter began to laugh. “Can I just say how stupid you are for saying that for the first time while eating chocolate? I’m almost starting to hate you.”
“Both,” Potter laughed. “It feels good to love someone. Or to be in love, or to fancy someone. However you want to call it.”
All three watched Harry and Draco, who watched each other until Harry shrugged. Draco rolled his eyes. “Only when completely distracted,” Draco muttered then. He elbowed Harry before he started to grin and glared at the children, but to no avail. Soon enough, all four of them were snickering uncontrollably.
Mr. Malfoy pointed at the cauldron. “A slow spell needs a speedy brewing of the counterpotion. That’s why I adapted the basis to speed up the brewing process. We have five more minutes, and if Bill isn’t back by then, we don’t stand a chance.”
While Phi glared and Draco glanced at the clock, Potter started to clean up the mugs and chocolate bowls.
He handed out pieces of parchment with precise instructions for making the potion they would be working on the next lesson.
He cares for Potter. Alright. He can live with that. And if Potter would want to try again and perhaps give him a chance of friendship, he wouldn’t refuse. Being friends with Potter, how would that be? Being able to laugh with him. But then he would also have to be friends with Mudblood and Weasel.
Draco noticed the stance his father had taken, meant to impress and suppress. He also noticed that his father knew he couldn’t suppress Draco anymore. It was exhilarating and saddening at the same time, seeing his once so powerful father unable to keep his son in tow.
Meanwhile, a pained whimper sounded from Aquila’s throat and her eyes glazed over. Draco’s eyes flitted towards her before clenching his fist and slowly lowering himself to his knees. Bending his head downward, he murmured a soft “fine”.
As soon as Draco was proclaimed innocent, the magic binding him to the chair was released, and he flew to his children. Cassie fell into his arms, unable to keep herself up any longer, and passed out with her head in his neck. While Smiths was getting a glass of water for her, Draco hugged everyone who had tried to help him. Molly presented him with a sweater she had knitted for him, with the D in the front, and on the back the slogan she had thought of. George never once left Draco’s side, and kept a hand on his shoulder at all times, making it difficult to manoeuver, but making Draco feel steady as well. Percy, Bill and Arthur had to say goodbye to a few of their colleagues, after which they rushed to congratulate Draco.
Cassie turned to tower over him with a triumphant smirk on her face. “Don’t mess with me, papa. I will beat you.”
“Is one supposed to say it now if one is engaged? Why?” Potter asked, smirking when twenty-five heads turned to look at him wide-eyed.
“That was a note to Head Mistress McGonagall, saying that you are on your way to her office and with a short summary of why I sent you out. Leave my classroom, now.”
“Because I know he is in the wrong,” Theresa stated. “You see, when he asked me to become his apprentice, and help him with a certain research, he refused to tell me what the research was about. He only said that we were going to brew potions with magically adapted ingredients.”
“No, it didn’t. And which other Slytherin is in love with a Gryffindor, and were together at the Valentine’s Ball?”
Looking down at his hands, James sighed heavily. “Yeah, I guess I could do that.” He sighed again. “Am I obvious?” he asked then.
“Then it’s decided. When all this is done,” – Draco gestured to Aquila – “you’ll have to come over and we will discuss our books until the sun comes up. Just like old times.”
Smiling to himself, because surely Draco would give in soon to that self-indulging part Cassie mentioned, Potter walked to his apartment in the Gryffindor Tower. He wondered whether Cassie had had help of her siblings in finding this out. Perhaps this had been that thing James mentioned, the thing the Malfoys had been working on. What else could they have been discussing?
Draco looked down at what he just wrote down. “Well, the graph shows us when the potion wears off and when it’s at its strongest. The tables say a lot of things I’m not sure of, because it all sounds a little improbable, and the other letters are scientific shortenings of certain effects and possible dangers. You’ll learn the meaning of all those if you decide to actually do your Potions mastery. For now, it’s too complicated to explain.”
“I kept it from him to protect him,” Draco lied, Malfoy mask in place. It was a bit rusty, that mask, since he hadn’t had to use it in a while.
So Draco laughed a bit. “It seems I’ve been wrong about that all my life,” he admitted. “You’ve got a lovely home.”
“No, you weren’t,” Potter insisted. “You are worried about Scorpius. Why? What’s going through your mind right now?”
The class filed out, students chatting happily about every silly thing they could think of. When Draco saw Zarnel leave the classroom, he called her name. She seemed to tense a bit, but forcibly relaxed when she turned around to face him. Draco waited until every other student was gone, before he started talking.
“Can you?” Draco breathed. “Yes, I would like that. If you don’t have anything else to do, we could sit down now? Let me just put away this bag.”
Draco’s head swirled around immediately, only to be met with a deep, lingering kiss that left a sparkle in his eyes and a rhythmic
“And Fred,” he whispered, voice hoarse. “I’m sorry. I am so, so sorry. I never wanted any of that, I never wanted anyone like that to die. I may have disliked the Weasley family, but I didn’t want them to die. I didn’t want Arthur to die when Tom attacked him, and I didn’t want Fred to die. I cried when I heard it. Fred and George were those kind of beacons in dark times, like with Umbridge. They managed to make everyone smile, they were able to make life just that bit better with their jokes and pranks. I am so proud of George to continue his shop, and I am so glad that Ron has decided to help him, but Fred’s absence always hurts to think of, when I walk into that shop. It’s why I don’t come there very often. Can you ever forgive me, Potter? For the things I’ve done, or haven’t done?”
“This is the last of it, Malfoy,” Potter said. He had hung around ever since the trials, even though Draco tried to get rid of him. Luckily, the man didn’t come by that often. But with Severus’ belongings being moved into the Manor, Potter had forced himself upon Draco to help with unpacking.
Draco nodded faintly. “Yes, yes, that’s fun. If you want, we can entertain ourselves somewhere in London. It’ll be fine,” he assured Potter.
James shrugged. “You don’t seem like someone that easily calls people their friends. It’s all right if you think we’re not friends. We could get there eventually.”
Potter shook his head, drifting closer to watch Draco’s fingers move silently, as if he was already playing a song in his mind.
When Draco looked at the other three, he saw that they had covered themselves with his blanket and were nodding off to sleep.
“Apart from focus, there also needs to be a proper emotion. Anger will make the potion take effect too early and too abruptly. Sadness dilutes it, as if you’ve added too much water. Desperation isn’t good either. Desperation makes a potion unreliable, as it will affect the body desperately, affecting parts of the body that do not need to be affected, or becoming far too strong in its effects. Potioneers must therefore always be in full control of their emotions, able of presenting the emotion the potion needs, even if they don’t feel that way.”
But that didn’t matter at the moment, because Minerva was finishing off her speech with the names of all Hogwarts students that had died during the Battle. Draco loved her for not neglecting to name those students with a Dark Mark, even though they had obviously been in the wrong. Draco also loved Potter for the soft squeeze he gave when Vincent’s name was said.
“Theresa knows next to nothing. She knows that the ingredients are magically adapted, but she has no idea how or to what extent. Neville and I know, and you have some kind of knowledge. Though I’m not sure you know enough to get Obliviated. Besides, you’re the Saviour.”
“When I left for Hogwarts, I didn’t know what to do with it. If I took it with me, it probably would have been taken away from me, because I would never tell anyone what was inside.
“Yes, they are. Ophiuchus is thinking of dressing up as Hagrid, by way of his morphing abilities and a wig. I’m not sure whether he’s powerful enough to do that, but we’ll see,” Draco chuckled.
Behind us, you see the army barracks. Everyone who would like to have a function in our Kingdom, is part of the army. These not only include soldiers, but also doctors, teachers and firemen. Before being allowed in the army, you will have to meet with a few demands. Apart from capability tests, you will have to prove that you are not in possession of a soul anymore, and you are fan of Disney. Are you interested? Don't hesitate to come visit the barracks! We are always in need of more people to support our Kingdom, one way or another.
Minerva had started frowning early on, and hadn’t stopped. She opened her mouth to speak, but shut it as there was a click.
Potter laughed at Phi’s enthusiasm, while Draco was trying to keep a straight face. Mr. Harry. His son quite clearly had lost his mind somewhere. But of course, he nodded indulgently and couldn’t help but smile when Phi beamed up at him.
“I’m quite sure of it. There were… personal reasons for it. Knowing Mr. Snape, it can probably be found in a wooden box.”
Movements that were exactly on the beat, where Draco checked his wrist as if checking a watch, his hands imitated mime movements to suggest feeling up a wall, and thrusting his balled fist through the former mentioned wall.
“I didn’t do anything to achieve those things, Jackie. It was the fact that people gave me a second chance. My children gave me a chance to prove that I could be a good parent, that I could care for people. Headmistress McGonagall gave me a chance to prove that I could be a competent teacher at Hogwarts. My Potions Mastery gave me a chance to prove that I could do more than sling Dark curses to others. Without second chances, I would still be nowhere.”
None of them seemed to mind that they had to share the gifts. The adult Weasleys all crammed together to take a look at the games, seemingly just as interested as the children.
Lily frowned. “Someone needs to go in there to stop your mother from convincing your papa that it’s wrong.”
Since Draco was in London, he decided to do a bit more Christmas shopping. The first shop he stepped in, was a bookshop, where he bought a rare book of the meanings of Patronuses and historical Wizards that had those Patronuses for Aquila. After that, he visited the Quidditch shop to buy the newest broomstick for Cassie and high-end Quidditch protection for Aquila and Scorpius. When he walked to the Apparition Point he would be using, he passed by a sign of a small Wizarding flea market.
Draco and Potter were opposing Seekers. Ron was Keeper of Potter’s team, while Ophiuchus mounted his broom, a little shakily since it wasn’t the lighter broom he was used to, and took his position in the air in Draco’s team. Aquila and Scorpius placed themselves as Beaters for Draco’s team as well.
Leaving the others behind, they hid themselves in Draco’s study where they always did their genealogical research. Draco had been taught so many family trees when he was younger, as a part of his ‘elite’ upbringing, and he had slowly developed a passion for it. A passion Scorpius shared, which Draco found out several years ago.
“Oh love, don’t cry. Don’t cry, I’m right here. I’ll always be right here. Everything is going to be all right, I promise you,” Draco chanted right back at her. It took a while for them both to calm down, after which Draco hauled her onto his hip, for which she was much too old and he much too weak at this point, and opened the door again to let the others back in. They were now joined by his mother, Albus and Lily, and Pansy and Blaise, all of them storming towards him to give him a hug or a kiss or both.
“I never got rid of them. I burnt the letters of course, like Father asked me to, but I kept the pictures. So if we are supposed to find the note, we will have to dig through these. If you’re not up for it, that’s all right.”
“Phi? ‘Phiuchus, is everything all right?” Draco inquired gently, knocking on the door before entering. Phi was sat on the extra mattress, crying and holding a ripped cloth. The small wooden night stand had combusted.
Minerva nodded, and Auror Whithal continued. “Mr. Malfoy, you are allowed one letter the moment you arrive in the holdings, which you will dictate to our scribe. This letter may not be longer than five inches. Headmistress McGonagall, good day. We will stay in touch.”
“As long as you remember that you promised. Slytherins usually keep their promises, for reputation’s sake,” Blaise offered softly. Potter smiled back.
Angelina grinned at Ginny, who was striding towards Potter, giving him a smacking kiss on his cheek. “Hi Draco. Long time no see,” she said airily, as if they had been friends way back.
He walked towards the kitchenette where he opened a seemingly small cupboard. A paper with names of many wines, beers and other alcoholic beverages, Muggle as well as Wizarding, was placed on the shelf.
Potter took a few deep breaths, forcibly relaxed his shoulders and looked at the ground in concentration, while he started to circle around Whithal with precise little steps.
‘Fall in love with you…’ echoes through his head. Potter’s in love? With him? This world really needs to sort it out. What kind of joke is this?
He still had no idea why his father hated Harry Potter so much, but he had an inkling. It must have had something to do with Voldemort, the man he was still mourning. Perhaps he had been killed by “You-Know-Who” as well, and his father was angry because Harry Potter survived.
Phi, who had been sitting closest to the fire, nodded. “Grandfather is right. It isn’t polite, papa.”
A spark in Cassie’s eyes indicated that this was exactly what she had been trying to steer the conversation towards, but it was gone too quickly for Potter to completely examine.
, is the curse.” He quickly explained the effects of the curse. “It can’t be countered by any spell, curse or potion,” he said then.
!!! (Wednesday instead of Sunday). Does that date mean anything to you? Anything HP related? No? Well, better look it up.
your secret, and your father won’t find out,” she had said. Draco didn’t understand, but who was he to refuse a present? Especially since it was such a beautiful wooden box with shiny silver clasps on the corners. The lock was a silver snake, curled through two silver holes. If Draco wanted to open the box, he had to stroke along the snake’s body and hiss something. Draco liked to pretend he could speak to snakes. Perhaps one day he would meet someone who could!
Draco sighed exasperatedly, too tired to be angry (and not wanting to be angry). He was about to shoo the three oldest out of his apartment and Phi into the bedroom to change, when Scorpius spoke up.
Potter walked over to the big box of Wizarding Music Discs, and began rifling through it. At a certain moment, he started laughing so loudly, that Draco spilled a bit of tea he was carrying into the room.
Draco chuckled. “It means a lot to me. Though, will you even be allowed to testify? You haven’t witnessed me with my children, and you barely know me. And with you being an Auror, I doubt they will have you there without being on duty.”
“How long have you even had thestrals?” Albus asked disbelievingly, shaking his head. “I would never have pegged you for a horse-lover. Let alone a horse-breeder.”
“Wow,” Potter whispered, taking the Snitch from the air and inspecting it from all angles. “It’s really beautiful. Where did you get this?” he asked, turning to Draco.
And please let me know what you thought of this chapter. It doesn't even have to be full sentences, just GIBBY GABBY GOO I SAY BOO is welcome as well :D
This is the last chapter of the holiday rush, so enjoy it! No more Christmas vibes after this. But this chapter is extra long ;D
Pansy sat up straighter and frowned harder. Potter bit his lip and frowned. Blaise giggled, but frowned after that.
The labyrinth wasn’t that difficult to go through, but Harry suspected it was because it recognised Draco’s magical signature. As they neared the end, the shrieking noise became louder.
They were definitely flirting now. Weren’t they? Yes, they were. It had to be. Right? No one would just say these things, right? Or would they? Potter was an oddity, of course. But even he couldn’t be so oblivious to the turn the conversation had taken.
“What’s the use of denying it? I won’t be accepted for any job, no matter if I am honest about this or not. Yes, Potter, I might have a tiny bit of a crush on you. And that’s enough grovelling for today. I will be going inside to pack my trunk and chat with Pansy for a bit. Have a nice life. Good day, Potter.”
Draco smiled, tilting his head just so, in the way he always hated when schoolgirls did that with their Quidditch captain boyfriends, and started twirling his hair. Potter for his part sighed longingly.
Albus nodded. “I just think you two deserve each other. That you’re really good together. A kind of love that everyone should have.”
Draco turned around to see Potter holding something in his hands. His mouth fell open and Draco’s posture stilled. He swallowed heavily.
I'm a tiny bit late. Last weekend (and next weekend) were swamped, and then my laptop broke down, so I couldn't finish it. However, here it is! And there will be a chapter this weekend as well, because I have to stay on schedule.
Draco nodded again. “Yes. Ehm. I once asked one of the Malfoy house elves for the recipe, and now, it’s one of my regulars. You like it?”
