“I would like to talk about it somewhere more private.”
Draco wiped the shock off of his face and regained his composure. Based on what he remembered, Harry should be working as an auror, bringing criminals to justice. He scratched his neck, it didn’t matter. They probably wouldn’t run into each other too often.
After a few weeks of being ignored Draco began to get annoyed. If he had done something wrong he was adamant about fixing it. He pulled Harry into an abandoned classroom before classes began, “What the fuck?” Harry yelled. Draco stepped away to give Harry some room. Harry looked up and recognized the blonde hair and thin face even in the dim lighting. He sighed, “Draco, what is this about?” Draco’s face seemed to turn red, “Stop acting like you don’t know what you’re doing.” Harry looked to the side and hunched over. Draco grit his teeth, “You can tell me if you want to-“ his throat closed up, “break up.” Harry sat in shock, “break up?” He croaked. He repeated the phrase. Maybe? Draco’s eyes were squeezed shut and his eyelashes damp with tears. The smile he had grown used to was missing.  Something pulled at Harry, not again not again not again- “Draco-“ Harry grasped the other boy’s shoulders and whispered words of comfort. Draco pushed him away. “I don’t want to break up with you,” he whispered. Draco wiped at his eyes in disbelief, the top of Harry’s face hidden behind shadow leaving a shy smile. Draco scowled, “Why are you doing this?” He said loudly while standing up. Harry’s eyebrows pulled together with concern. “I’m not-“ Draco turned around to leave the room, Harry reached out to grab his arm. Draco had tears trickling down and a watery nose, “Is this not what you want?” Harry tightened his grip on Draco’s arm which responded with a bright pink flush. “Why would I break up with you? Why would I want to?” Draco’s crying intensified, Harry gently guided him onto the floor and comforted him until he stopped. “I don’t want to,” Harry whispered into his hair. Draco blushed at the muffled noise. “Why do you keep avoiding me then?” Harry played with Draco’s hair, the slytherin waited for the painful silence to end but Harry stayed quiet. Draco looked up at him and asked again. “ I was… scared.” Draco laughed quietly at that, “Of me? What am I gonna do to you?” Harry’s shoulders loosened, “Not you I suppose, the responsibility, commitment- definitely not you.” He hugged him even tighter, “Y-you are perfect.” Draco wriggled awkwardly at the praise.
, you know? It’s not fair to them, really. They weren’t raised like us. They don’t understand our world.”
“What do you mean?”
“You’re angry,” Draco said.
“But the Dementor’s Kiss…”
"We talked about that,” Daphne said at once. “About how you saved Harry. And I told him, you know…that you're my friend.”
Draco turned the parchment over in his hands, checking to see if anything else was written. “Father says he needs my permission to have funds withdrawn from my Gringotts account.”
It wasn’t his best work, but he was too agitated to think up something cleverer. Rolling the parchment into a tight scroll and putting away his things, Draco called up to Callidus. He knew the owl had heard him; he ruffled his wings angrily and turned away from the sound of Draco’s voice. Draco called him again—several other owls hooted at him irritably. Finally, Callidus cracked open his eyes, gave a low, angry hoot, and fluttered down to Draco’s side.
“It’s alright. I’ve already heard.”
. He dropped his head back onto the mattress and groaned loudly, not caring how desperate he sounded, when Potter rubbed Draco's wet slit with his thumb. Just as he started to thrust into Potter’s hand, feeling himself lose control, Potter suddenly pulled away, laughing openly at Draco’s wail of frustration. He gripped the base of Draco’s cock tightly and waited for him to settle. Draco ran his fingers through his hair, telling himself to
“And it’s ached before, right?”
“Usually before you start a reading, you ask the deck a question. Or at least, you give some idea of what you’re curious about.”
“Oh, very good, Mr. Malfoy!” Flitwick squeaked, clapping his hands. “And you, Ms. Parkinson?”
“I thought we might do your evaluation, Mr. Malfoy,” Proudfoot called.
Draco’s heart froze as he saw Harry diving towards the ground; in an instant, Harper was next to him, although he couldn’t quite keep up as Harry put his Firebolt through its paces. At the last second, he yanked upwards and shot off after the Snitch, Harper right on his tail.
“Do you feel better?” Harry asked.
“Ginny Weasley from Gryffindor has the Quaffle, there she goes…oh, and she’s passed it to Demelza Robins…I don’t know much about her. And she’s passed it back to Ginny…and there’s Felix Harper, looking for the Snitch. That’s a nice name, Felix. A man named Felix invented Cheering Charms, I think…Felix Summerbee…”
“Er—right.” Draco noticed Potter glancing over at Granger, who nodded at him. “Nonverbal magic. The trick is…you want to

Bragge produced a file from nowhere and Summoned a quill from his office, clearing his throat. “All right, Mr. Malfoy—if you would be so kind as to demonstrate a transformation for us?” He seemed to catch himself, belatedly adding with only a hint of worry in his tone, “That won’t be an issue, will it? Dear me, I’d hate to have to ask Mr. Potter here to go diving back into—”

Why would they waste their time on cleansing when it would be so much more expedient to just sit back and wait for any lingering curses or maledictions to get rid of Mother and me for them?” Potter looked absolutely
Harry’s mouth went dry. “At—at Hogwarts?”
After a good half hour of cavorting, Draco seemed to have finally burnt off enough excess energy he wasn’t practically vibrating out of his skin any longer, and they returned to the ground. There was a high, happy flush to his cheeks when he shifted back, his hair a windswept mess, but he was grinning from ear to ear with an infectious smile Harry couldn’t help but catch himself.
He swallowed thickly, then squared his jaw. “…That won’t happen,” he said, and he sounded so sober and serious that Draco almost wanted to believe him. But that was just the Boy Saviour in him. That ineffable quality that made people want to believe him capable of silly, impossible things, despite themselves. More fantasy.
, that must have been it,” Draco drawled, crossing his arms over his chest. “Clearly I only wanted to flirt with you.”
“Nothing, you just—you get this…” He trailed off, studying Harry, and then seemed to think better of it. “Never mind.”
He let the threat hang, and Draco shooed him away with one wing, placing his back to Potter and wondering in the back of his mind as he began picking through the pile of treats if owls could be charged with postal fraud.
Draco felt his face heating up, and he spat back, “Oh

“I’m not thinking of purchasing anything—just want to poke my head in and see what’s what. Probably won’t have much leave to drop in once school gets going again.”
“Er, well I’m…I’m getting rid of him, see. Giving him to a friend, and he’ll probably want to tag his new owl with his own band.”
And that was a dangerous question to entertain when they were five minutes from leaving, so Harry settled for. “I’m—working on it.” It was probably a good thing the bits of dragon that still held sway over Draco
“Because I want you there,” Draco said simply, as if that was all there was to it. Which, there might well have been; Draco was still a tricky, fickle beast to navigate, too draconic by half at times and in ways Harry didn’t think he’d ever grow accustomed to. Truthfully, though, it smacked a bit of ‘hoarding’, and Harry wondered if they ought to speak with Charlie, to see what else they might try doing in order to settle those restless bits of Draco that refused to be tamed.

“What, about leaving the pitch closed for the coming school year and postponing the Quidditch season until next?” Draco tossed his button-down into the washing basket with an angry huff. “Of course I’ve thought about it—it’s a fucking

Still, he’d vainly hoped he might be able to complete his probation and graduate without issue, and then go on to find a job somewhere that wouldn’t ask too many questions about what he’d been up to for the past few years, where no one could bother him. He was handy with Charms, he’d learned, and he had a knack for repairing magical items (never mind where that experience had come from…). Surely there was a shop in Knockturn Alley that would be willing to take him on, even if they might not pay the best wages.
Draco’s expression was a perplexing combination of utterly scandalised and absolutely delighted. “Then we’ll have to at least use

“…Not well, generally.”
Harry swallowed—then let his hips nudge forward, a shallow, experimental little thrust with no force behind it. Draco’s brows furrowed, but he didn’t cry out, didn’t wince, so Harry drew back, further this time, and slid back in.
Draco fluffed his pillow with a punch before lying down, drawing the coverlet over himself. “
Draco rolled his eyes, tossing the coin back into the drawer and sliding it shut. “Don’t sound so enthused, Harry.”
Draco gave a gruff, huffing scoff, shaking his head in bemusement. “…I genuinely do not understand you.”
“Wait.” Potter choked on his tea. “She knows you’re at the
He would stay in his room, within the Dungeon tucked deep beneath the castle, just hiding away and finishing school, head down and desperate to be forgotten.
“Hope you weren’t planning on finally fucking me today,” he drawled morosely under his breath as they stepped out into the Atrium, its rich hardwood floors and peacock-blue ceiling unchanged from a year prior. “Someone else has beat you to the punch.”
“Can’t I? Ask yourself—” he said, working a hand between them to fondle Harry’s cock through his pyjama bottoms, “—how
It was Draco who heard it first: the distant sounds of footfalls clomping up stone steps and raucous conversation following students from the Common Room to their respective dormitories. He shivered to rearrange his feathers—after leaning against Potter, a whole swathe of feathers down his side was now pressed flat in what seemed to be the avian version of bed-head. Potter startled, stiffening at Draco’s sudden movement. “What? What’d I do?”
Draco use magic to make this more pleasurable, for the both of them? Why shouldn’t he cast spells, for his own safety and Harry’s? Why shouldn’t he?
something. And it probably always would. Like the Mark on his arm, he’d never be rid of this urge to prove to Potter he wasn’t the snivelling little weasel he somehow always made himself out to be.
who waltzed into the Owlery and beckoned him down with a large enough handful of treats.
After bidding Blaise farewell until the New Year’s party the Zabinis were planning, Draco returned to Wiltshire, finally getting the hang of this strange time-slipping flight of which magical owls seemed capable. He didn’t think he was ready to try heading all the way back to Hogwarts with only his instincts to guide him, but perhaps with time.
“Me too.”
. “We’ll see how minor an injury
Draco popped the lid—revealing a pair of silver rings.
His lips twitched in bemusement, and he reached to take it in hand—
So he was grateful, beyond measure, that Draco hadn’t given up. Had waited, perhaps not patiently, until he’d been where he needed to be, and Harry had been where he’d needed to be, so that they could be just what they needed from each other, precisely when they needed it most.
Draco looked up, gaze slowly climbing from the file in his hands to meet Thomassen’s eye. “…Who put in the recommendation?”
The Snitch stayed put, and Draco tutted softly, slipping it into his pocket. “Come now, Potter. That’s basic rules and regulations. You can’t summon a Snitch.” He gave a little wave. “Enjoy your game!”
“She hasn’t decided yet; said she’s going to float around and see which she clicks with best. I think Kingsley’s hoping she’ll work under or alongside him, though. He’s going to have his hands full sorting through the corruption still ravaging the Ministry, after all. Not all the bad eggs have Dark Marks for easy identification…”
“I’m going to start shadowing some Ministry officials in the next week or so,” Hermione said, spooning a helping of sweetcorn onto her plate. It had been Ron’s turn this evening, and he’d recently taken a shine to all things instant, as Draco had; every dish on the table had come from a tin or packet and been zapped with a Warming Charm.
Draco said nothing for several agonising heartbeats, before asking, “Why?”
As soon as they ducked through the Floo returning home, Draco launched himself from Potter’s shoulder and made a beeline for the roost room, impatiently waiting for Potter to join him so he could get this
“But, as I told them both, I’m of age now and can make my own bad decisions. I expect they’ll come around in time.”
? Wasn’t that…”
“—and seeing as we’ll have plenty of time with Ron and Hermione come the end of the month, and probably more later on for house parties and whatnot—” Draco gave an exaggerated shudder and moaned
. “...You don’t seem half as pissed off as I’d have expected. Dare I hope you’ve finally learned to act your age?”
Oh indeed he did. “And that needs to be

“I meant it in a good way! It’s good, I like it.” This close, he could see the light flush painting Draco’s cheeks, and the way he kept his eyes resolutely fixed on securing the knot at Harry’s neck was telling.
Draco frowned, because now Potter didn’t sound like he was speaking from blind faith—but from sure knowledge. “…How do you know that?”

excuse.” He took Draco’s plate. “So? You coming or not?” He then held up a piece of tattered cloth that looked familiar—and on closer inspection, Draco realised it was a scrap from the ratty cable-knit sweater Potter had used to protect his arm when Draco perched on him. He placed it on his shoulder and gestured invitingly.
“Oh yeah; how’d the de-Modifying go?” Harry hadn’t wanted to pry, but she’d brought it up, so he supposed it was fair game.
“To my father’s great relief, no.”
“Why should I want to? We’re having

He’d half hoped Potter might’ve ignored the gossip; it was the
Harry.
with all manner of vermin, and though the very idea had disgusted him at the outset, Draco had become in the months since mastering his transformation a rather adept hunter, if he did say so himself, and he began to bring fresh kills to Potter’s window, just to see what he might do. A mouse here, a vole there, and even—just once—a little white stoat that reminded Draco uneasily of the weasel form he’d been shunted into back in Fourth Year for Moody the Misanthrope’s delight.
As he mounted the steps up onto the dais, taking his place at the stately podium behind which Dumbledore had always delivered his own quirky speeches, Harry could not help but feel everyone’s expectations weighing more heavily now than they ever had. A collective breath was held, all eyes on him—and Harry swallowed thickly, cast a quiet
for an Animagus form had passed—that he’d completed his training. “You’ve come this far, Mr Malfoy,” McGonagall had said with her lips in a thin, tight line. “Unless you think perhaps Animagecraft might not serve you quite as well now as it might have six months ago?”
It took some convincing, but Tedward seemed easily distracted and was happy to run through a veritable rainbow of hair colours, though Potter couldn’t seem to get his nose back the way it had been before, and for the remainder of the afternoon, it held a distinctly patrician shape that Draco heartily approved of.
“No?”
“N.E.W.T.s?”
. I just want it—hard, and hot, and—and—” He splayed his palms flat over Harry’s pectorals, tracing with one finger the jagged white scar from the second Killing Curse. “Light me on fire.”
Grimmauld Place was the liveliest it had been since the Order had held meetings there, which Harry quite liked, as it helped distract from the fact that every room outside of their bedrooms and the sitting room still looked like it was set to host a funeral—though the company left something to be desired. Draco had taken Harry up on his suggestion and then some, and now sprawled around the sitting room—on freshly Transfigured furniture, courtesy of Draco—were Pansy Parkinson, Gregory Goyle, Theodore Nott, and Millicent Bullstrode, all of whom looked about as happy to be there as Harry was to have them.
“…So you like them, then?”
. Pansy and Blaise certainly weren’t going to be hearing anything from
“What’s a bloody owl doing out here?”
Potter must have noticed him surveying the room, for he promptly explained, “The others are down in the Common Room—probably won’t be back up until curfew. I had a Charms essay to finish. It’s my week to let Ron crib my parchments, see, so I’ve gotta have it finished by the morning—oh!” He rushed over to a wardrobe standing beside one of the four-posters and began rummaging through, eventually pulling out a bulging purse that he shook enticingly. “It’s not from Eeylops, but the Post Office in Hogsmeade had a few boxes on hand that customers could purchase. Peace offering?”
“‘Out of there’?” Potter parroted, brows knitting. “Where? Your home?” His expression darkened further. “Wait—it’s not…there’s not, like,
“Now here’s a question,” Ron said, doing his own fair share of ogling. “What’s faster—your Firebolt, or Draco?”
Draco’s smile glittered with knives.
, so what had been meant to be a welcome finale to years of education wasted on parlour tricks and outright hogwash had instead turned into a year-long siege under the thumb of Death Eaters so foul a Dementor would’ve spat their soul back out.

“I once blew up my aunt nonverbally, you know.”
up at Draco, giving him a hard, appraising look. He could hear the rusty gears clanking about in her head as she tried to pick Draco apart, and in a desperate effort to put her off his scent, Draco took a wet shit on Potter’s shoes, doing his best impression of a disinterested owl. Potter squawked in bright offence, and Draco just blinked slowly, getting comfortable on his perch.

Pushed to it and admittedly missing the sort of company neither Ron nor Hermione could provide—biting sarcasm and cruel teasing, punctuated by bouts of frenzied groping—Harry agreed to let Draco stay on at Grimmauld Place, with the sole stipulation that they take separate bedrooms. Draco agreed to the condition startlingly quickly, suggesting he had either been sorely missing his privacy over the past eight months or else had no intention of actually
He was immediately drawn inside, and the chill of the evening was chased away by the tower’s cosy warmth. Gryffindor House had its charms, he supposed, as far as amenities went. The Dungeon could be draughty if you weren’t bundled up under the bedclothes, and even the likes of Blaise, who preferred to sleep in the buff, never went to bed without at least one pair of wool socks on.

Harry didn’t know about that; Draco no longer suffered from the

“Yeah.”

because…?”
“Yes, I must,” Bragge said. “We’ll have a few forms for him to fill out as well.”
Draco huffed in disgust, but he didn’t say no. “Anything. Anything to distract.”
‘Luncheon’ it turned out was a rather complicated affair, involving at least five courses, a virgin vintage from the cellars (far away, Harry hoped, from the mouldy, squalid dungeon with the cages of iron bar and steel), and stuffy dress robes that stank of some ancient cologne. If Harry had thought that house arrest and a decidedly inelegant fall from grace were going to sap the Malfoys’ love of tradition, he was sorely mistaken. Less surprising, though, was how much work they had managed to put into restoring the Manor to its former glory in just one week.

to improve his mood as the days grew shorter and the term drew to a close. Potter had tried to compromise by turning up in the Owlery more often, but it was a far from pleasant environment for a human, with the cold and the stench, so they were at an impasse.
at when I was your age. And I didn’t even have a criminal background I wanted to get past. You want to take your chances elsewhere, then be my guest.” He settled back in his chair. “Someone way above my pay grade told me to see if we could use you. So I did—and we can. What you do with that information is your business.”
“It can wait. I can’t.”
But much like the daydreams wherein he escaped the manor with Potter and his band of renegade war heroes, this was just another flight of fancy. He’d done Dumbledore in as surely by his actions as if he’d cast the Killing Curse himself. So no, he didn’t want to go back to the Astronomy Tower, whatever Potter thought his reasoning might be.
, Potter. As one does with a wand.”
. “Get—back here—”
It was Pansy, it turned out. She paused in the doorway, and he could feel her eyes on him, trying to work out just what was going on. Then, carefully and warily, as if she thought he might have been Petrified and perhaps the Basilisk that had rendered him thus was still lurking about, she approached. Her feet whispered softly across the plush area rug, and then she was there, settling down beside him on the mattress. He rolled over a little as the bed sank.
There wasn’t much to see, Draco thought: other than his bed and his writing desk, the only other furniture was a bedside table and bookcase. Above the desk, several photographs were pinned. They showed Draco with his parents, with his friends. And settled on the bag was his suitcase. Draco picked through his things, searching for his comfiest pair of pyjamas, refusing to look up at the photographs as the figures depicted waved happily at him.

And it got progressively worse as the evening wore on and we had more and more people around us. You’ve had me practically to yourself all this time, but…that’s going to change soon. We probably won’t even have our own room anymore.” Draco made a sour face. “So I was thinking that maybe it might be easier for you if you had some kind of—well…” He pointed to the ring box Draco was still clutching in his hand. “This. Especially when I’m not around to…you know…”
Draco gave a sharp little intake of air, and Harry tensed. “What?”

“That Mark on your arm says otherwise.”

“Well, of course not, but the point is—”
Draco viciously speared a sausage with his fork. “Going to clap a collar ‘round my neck this time? Be still my beating heart.”
Potter’s face lit up as he hit upon another idea. “How about the Room of Requirement, then?”
Harry took his time choosing a broom from the rack, and by the time he returned, a handsome Nimbus model (pilfered from the Slytherin stores) over one shoulder, Draco had shed his human form for something rather more suited to his name.
Such a filthy invitation on Draco’s lips nearly undid Harry, but he fought back his orgasm once more, desperate to give Draco time to catch up. Nothing about this experience so far had been quite how he expected it to be, so he felt entitled to one selfish request: that they get off around about the same time. Familiarity told him Draco would not be much longer, and Harry could hold off, he could. He

Potter did not bother fighting his own eye-rolling urge, indulging merrily. “Oh don’t be so

Draco let him stew in his self-loathing for only a heartbeat, then gave a derisive scoff, staring down into his half-drunk mug of tea. “…Don’t try and feign sympathy, and keep your condolences to yourself.”
“As it turned out, it was for an interview, rather than an interrogation.”

don’t think you want to be an Auror with me…well, we can’t say you didn’t give it a fair shot.”
Potter only rolled his eyes, throwing his hands in the air. “As I said before: you’ll get the pleasure of telling me, multiple times an evening I expect, that I’m thick, a dunderhead, and quite possibly beyond salvaging. That should give you

“Come on,” Potter wheedled. “George’s shop wasn’t so bad. And at least you got out in the fresh air. Plus, you’ve got some disgustingly overpriced treats to choke down now, so I’m sure all the other owls will be
He approached, carefully and cautiously, and scanned the branches above, a tiny little noise of defeat gurgling in his throat when he found the empty branches where the Hogwarts-owned owls usually roosted. His gaze then drifted, reluctant, to Draco, and he held before himself, clenched tight in his fists, a rolled up slip of parchment.

“Have you thought about using it for spell practice?” Hermione suggested, just as the sun was touching the distant horizon. Mr. Weasley and Percy would be home any minute now, and even this far from the kitchen, Harry could smell wonderful scents drifting out the open windows. “No sense in letting valuable skills go to waste!”
, got it?” Draco clacked his beak; as if he were going to make a scene in the middle of this scrum.
Potter released him all the same, though. “Well if manhandling you won’t do it, and asking you straight won’t do it, I’m out of ideas.”
Oh they knew Draco was an Animagus, knew he’d been not quite himself for a while and brought down Dumbledore in his animalistic rampaging—but they didn’t know
Hermione shook her head. “I asked for it; I was hoping for something a bit low-key to start off with. All the stories I remember Arthur telling suggested to me it was mostly harmless cases.”

Draco shrugged. “It was dull at the manor—no one comes to call anymore, not that I can blame them. Then that little Snidget of yours showed up, and I thought to see if I could follow it. Figured it might be a fun challenge.” He glanced around, taking in the sad, shabby state of the shed for the first time;

Draco squeezed tighter and thought he might be drawing blood. Good. “NO! No, no, uh, I just—” He grunted. “Just—please take it off. Please
Harry doubted that very much. “Yeah, maybe.”
“Fuck you, Potter.” Draco released a stuttering breath, closed his eyes, and forced his hips down—and then down and down, grimacing all the while, until his arse brushed Harry’s hipbones, fully seated, and he exhaled with an audible huff. “Fucking

the field I would have seen you expressing any interest in entering after…well, after everything, but it’s sure to earn you a measure of esteem, and perhaps you’ll even be granted privileges for visitations with you father!” She swished in her long dress robes over to a table where the house-elves had set out a tea service, pouring herself a cup from the everwarm pot. “Naturally it would be horrid if they tried to put you in the field, but you’re very good with puzzles, so perhaps they could find a use for you behind the scenes, as it were? Rather than charging into battle, wand ready, where you might come to harm. Why, that sort of work might even be
Harry was hunched over his desk, drawing up the syllabus for his class. He quickly scribbled in chunky print. We wrote so aggressively that he feared he would rip the parchment. Still, he pressed on. After a couple hours he leaned back and took a look at his work. He smiled to himself and ignored the countless spelling and grammatical errors. He swished his wand and stacks and stacks of copies appeared on his desk. He stretched his arms and back, and breathed out happily as the tension in his back lessened. He glanced at the wall, the only thing separating his and Draco’s room. He sat quietly in his armchair chewing at his lip. Harry stood up and made his way towards the door, it couldn’t hurt to visit.
He slipped on a robe which had gotten wrinkled in his briefcase. He harshly smoothed the fabric and slipped on a pair of old leather shoes. He combed back his unkempt hair but it refused to stay put. Harry quickly left his room, forgetting to lock it. He briskly made his way to the mixer which was held in the great hall. It was fairly empty, the staff being the exception, and undecorated. He looked around and found that he recognized most of the professors. Before he could take a seat next to anyone, Hagrid came rushing towards him. He captured Harry in a bearlike hug and smiled widely. “I almos’ didn’ believe it, Harry Potter is back at Hogwarts. Oh now don’ be shy!” Hagrid dragged him towards a crowded table and introduced Harry loudly. He was met with many cheerful greetings and smiling faces. People began crowding around him. All their words melted together. He couldn’t choose one person to focus on. A pain in his chest began to grow and his face heated up. He tapped Hagrid on the back, as he couldn’t quite reach his shoulder. “I’m going to sit over there for now.” He pointed towards a table near the corner. Hagrid frowned comically and then laughed, “Jus’ be sure to visit later!” Harry nodded and waved as he made his way towards the table. He sat down and noticed that Malfoy was sitting across from him. Just his luck. Malfoy looked up slightly w-hen he heard the bench creak. He continued picking at his food. “What are you doing?” Harry locked his eyes on the ground and gripped his hands tightly. “I, uh didn’t-” Malfoy shooed him, “Go get some food, you look dreadful.” Harry sighed as relief came over him. Harry scrambled up and grabbed a tray from the table nearby. He eyed the platters and scooped rice and the beef stew onto his plate. His wrist ached and his arm wobbled under the weight of the ladle. He quickly shook it off and walked back to the table. Draco watched as Harry balanced the loaded plate in his hands and stumbled like a schoolboy. He smiled with his mouth buried in his palm.
Harry opened his eyes, just barely and waited for his eyes to adjust to the light. He reached for his glasses and felt around for it on the bedside table. Not there. He sat up and turned the pillow over, scouring the sheets for his glasses. His hand stopped abruptly, these sheets weren’t his. Quiet snoring came from under the blanket. He lifted the blanket and shrieked before clapping his hand over his mouth. Draco’s face scrunched up and he muttered to himself before settling back in. Harry cautiously interjected the other man’s sleep, “Uhh, Malfoy?” Draco reluctantly got up and turned to Harry, rubbing his eyes. “Oh, good morning.” Draco muttered before burying his face back into the pillow. Harry sat in shock, mouth hanging open, “Why am I sleeping in your bed?” Draco sighed, “You’re the one who fell asleep in it.” Draco scratched his head and pointed to the door, “You can leave whenever you want, I’m going back to sleep.” Harry watched, eyes filled with awe, as Draco went back to sleep without any hassle.
Accelerating this relationship cause I’m fed up with these mfs I MEAN THESE BOYS GAY !! THESE BOYS HOMOSEXUAL !!!
By the time Draco got back to the dungeons it was late in the afternoon. He quickly jumped onto his bed and sighed. The Slytherin turned onto his side and curled into a ball, mindlessly pulling at his robes. He still felt the heat and tingling from the Gryffindor’s touch. Even the loud footsteps and chattering of the Slytherins no longer irked him. He was so fixated on what just happened to him that he didn’t notice Pansy and Blaise enter the room. “What happened to you?” Pansy asked, genuinely concerned. Draco dropped the pillow he was hugging and frantically stood up. “Nothing,” he lied. Pansy crossed her arms and raised an eyebrow. Blaise shared a look of second-hand embarrassment from behind her and covered his face. They all stood there in silence for what felt like forever. “I’m serious, nothing happened,” He reassured. Pansy sighed, “It’s fine if you don’t want to tell us but… something just feels off about you. Draco fell back onto his bed and shook his head, “Just leave already.” Both of them left with unsatisfied faces. Draco turned his head to look out the window and watched the sunset through his thin, blonde hair. The orange and red of the sky were warm and vibrant only making him miss Harry more.
Blaise hugged Draco with one arm and Pansy breathed out. Draco forcefully rubbed his eyes, “We we’re having a good time,” he said without going into a ‘good time’. “And then he just left, I tried to get him to stay but he said he had didn’t— and later today, I asked if he wanted to hang out and he said he was busy.” Draco’s body tensed, “I don’t know if he’s mad at me or just wants space or— what if he’s actually busy and I’m bothering him!”Pansy sighed, “Draco, sweetie, calm down.” Blaise patted his back, “He’s probably just freaking out, adjusting to a new relationship can be hard. Just try to give him time.” Draco blushed, “Maybe I did overreact.” Pansy shook her head, “ You can’t control how you feel.”
He didn’t bother washing up and left quickly. The halls were mostly empty, causing him to worry and speed up.
The plate and utensils clattered as he set them down. Draco discreetly watched as Harry stuffed his mouth full and turned away so that Draco couldn’t see. Harry cleared his throat after he gulped his food down. “So… What are you doing here?” Draco tapped the table rhythmically, “I teach potions.” Harry looked up at him, “Oh, I never imagined you in a teaching position.” Harry took a small bite from a carrot. “What about you? I thought you were gonna be a hotshot auror.” Harry scratched his neck, “I don’t know. I think after fighting Voldemort for so long, I wanted a break. Not just a break from fighting him, I think trying to meet everyone’s expectations really got to me.” Draco nodded awkwardly. “So you chose to work here. What do you teach?” Harry looked up as if trying to remember, “Defence Against the Dark Arts.” Draco chuckled to himself, “Not much of a break is it? I mean you used to teach it in your group, Dumbledor’s Army was it?” Harry smashed a potato under his fork, “This time nobody’s life is in immediate danger.” Draco nodded, “Valid point.”
Harry leaned in and cupped Draco’s cheek causing Draco to make a less than proper noise. Harry whispered a desperate “Yes.” and moved towards Draco’s lips. He stopped himself before impact, “May I?” He asked with a slight smile on his face. Draco somehow turned redder and nodded frantically, Harry pressed up against the other boy until there were no gaps between them. Harry knew that Draco was blushing but the heat given off was new, he loved how it felt, contrasting the cold rain. Draco had been frozen and sat underneath Harry rigidly. The messy noises made by Harry urged him to move and he began to push back and clumsily grabbed onto the soaked fabric of Harry’s robes. He could feel Harry smile into the kiss. “Harry,” the word came out ugly and rough and the Gryffindor couldn’t remember why he hadn’t kissed him before.
Ok I’m not super proud of this chapter but it’s kinda necessary for Harry’s character development, y’know? so we can understand his motivations for what happens later on or whatever
It was deceivingly large. He sifted through the clothes and eventually found a tshirt which he changed into. The dress shirt he had on had begun to irritate his neck. Once he was more comfortable, he began going through the various papers and keys given to him by McGonagall. He pocketed the key labeled “Classroom” and leisurely looked through all the documents. He stopped when saw a handwritten note from McGonagall. It invited him to a mixer between teachers and staff. He carefully folded it up and put it aside.
Harry stood in his room, getting ready for lunch. He had woken up later than usual as he hadn’t had time to set an alarm. His cheeks heated up as he remembered that morning but he willed himself out of his room. He slowly walked to the Great Hall, listening to the clacking of his shoes echo through the halls, trying to draw out the time before he saw Draco again. He looked around timidly for Draco and saw that he was sitting at the same table as yesterday. He was jittery but hid it with a smile as he approached. “You don’t sit with anybody?” Draco jumped in surprise, “Oh, uh- No.” Draco cleared his throat, “I don’t really have anyone to talk to here.” He chewed on his lip, waiting for Harry’s response. “Oh… Well, I’m getting my food but I’ll be right back.” Draco nodded, “okay.”
“He still did it for me, then,” Draco said bitterly. “To spare me.”
“Nobody’s forcing you!” she said shrilly.
“Harry,” Draco murmured, “that’s awful.”
Draco hummed thoughtfully.
Draco’s heart was beating furiously in his chest as he took out his wand. He told himself to stay calm, that Harry was there, that Harry would know what to do, that nothing bad could
“I do,” Harry mused. Slowly, he reached down and took him in hand. Fuck, Draco had missed this. The feel of Harry’s hand—rough, calloused, so distinctly
“I may not measure up to His Lordship Harry Potter, but I’m quite proficient in nonverbal magic,” he said drily.
“I guess so.” She looked down at her half-finished cup of tea. “We were never involved, not really. But after what I said last year…I don’t know, it’s…I still feel like everyone…”
them…It was torture, plain and simple.
“We’ve just been.” Hermione dug through her bag and held up the little pink planner. “I have to admit, George really knows what he’s doing. It was packed—we could barely even get in. I didn’t know if he could manage, since…”
“Unless I’m mistaken, the Dark—” Draco shook himself, and managed to say: “Voldemort—he’s gone now. So why can’t you just get back with her?”
Slughorn clapped his arm, causing Draco to wince, but he seemed to take no notice. “There’s a good lad. Go on, then. And I expect you to be on time for our meeting this afternoon.”
“Your Mark hurts?”
“Yes. Your next Hogsmeade weekend is in two weeks. I need you to go to Dervish and Banges and meet with one of my associates—Rochefort—he’s visiting from France and staying at the inn. He’ll give you a package. We aren’t allowed visitors at the Manor, but I’m quite sure they’ll allow you to visit for Christmas. So hang on to that package until then. Keep it safe. Can you do that?”
“I knew you’d react like this,” Draco said angrily as they swept down the stairs to the dungeons. “This is why I didn’t want to tell you.”
Pansy and Blaise bickered as they headed towards the entrance hall. Before he could stop himself, Draco peered over at the Gryffindor table. Potter was surrounded by his usual entourage—Granger, Weasley, Longbottom, Thomas, and Finnigan. They were laughing uproariously. Draco’s stomach twisted painfully as he watched Finnigan bring his hand up to his forehead and pretend to faint. He realized, with a start, that Finnigan was re-enacting his fall in Defence. And Potter—well, he wasn’t laughing outright like Weasley, but he smiled and shook his head as he sipped from his goblet. And that hurt. It shouldn’t have. But it did. In that moment, Draco loathed himself more for the sad little ache in the pit of his stomach than for passing out in class.
“I need to go to Dervish and Banges,” said Draco, alarmed.
Draco hummed thoughtfully. “And how’s your internship?”
“I’m sure. Come on.”
Kreacher and Winky were delighted to see them. They refused to let them go without first stuffing their trunks full of sweets. Harry presented Kreacher with a new pair of oven mitts; they came up to his shoulders, but he seemed very happy. Winky, meanwhile, was ecstatic with her gift of a little blue brooch. She pinned it proudly to her shirt.
Potter looked back down at his text, frowning. Growing restless, Draco levitated their dishes towards the sink. They floated down neatly until the very end, when he lost control and they dropped with a clatter. His magic was so rough around the edges here. He himself felt worn, as though being in this house was slowly unraveling him. The heat didn’t help, either. Draco leaned back in his chair, considering Potter, watching as he continued to work his way through his textbook. It wasn’t as though he had anywhere else to be.
Millicent scoffed. “He’ll have you Scouring the classrooms, more like.”
“Oh, I always mess that spell up. And I don’t want to ruin these again.”
“See? Look how much I’m learning already.”
All things considered, attending the party wasn’t his worst idea. Draco was so anxious about how people would react to his presence, and whether the night would be a repeat of the last party, that he had very little time to worry about his father and the wretched Portkey. In the end, none of the other eighth-year Slytherins joined them, which suited him fine.
“So Harry used his map, and we saw right away that you were here in this classroom!” Daphne said brightly. “It was no trouble at all, finding you. Isn’t that so clever, Draco?”
“Shacking up with our beloved Saviour?” Draco Transfigured the dark, heavy curtains into something light and diaphanous, bringing light flooding into Regulus’s dour, dingy room. He lifted one shoulder in an elegant shrug. “I suppose we’ll find out when you come to the Manor for luncheon on Sunday.”
Ron looked like he was ready to get right back into it, after nearly a month away from Draco’s barbs, and Hermione cleared her throat pointedly. “Well I have to say I’m glad to have a bit of time away from my folks as well…”
. He was the one making unreasonable—and unfathomable—demands of Draco. Tutor him? In
“Something I picked up in Diagon Alley,” Harry said, nudging the bag closer to Draco and keeping well back himself. “I thought you might be able to use it.”
Draco’s head snapped around at someone calling from down a hallway, “
close to suggesting we’re friends, Potter, and I believe I’ve already made my feelings on such insinuations well known.”
Harry rolled his eyes, returning his attention to more pleasant matters—like the fact his cock fit just right against the curve of Draco’s arse. He gave another experimental pump—but the friction was painful now, dry, sensitive skin chafing
Draco flicked his eyes up to meet Harry’s. “…What are Granger and Weasley doing?”
!” Draco shrieked in horror, making a tight fist around Harry’s cock—and the spell died on his lips. “So help me, if you Vanish those new robes I will snap your wand in half and then shove the pieces down your throat!”
Well that was just
anymore.”
But he’d never
And speaking of unwashed masses—Potter and his herd of Weasleys found themselves spat out of the public Floos near Gringotts at precisely 11 o’clock. As Potter had suggested they meet up at noon, Draco held back—reining in any urges to buzz him with a literal dung-bomb—and instead quietly watched the group wriggle their way through the throng, stopping first by the Wheezes establishment before continuing on to shops like Scrivenshaft’s and Wiseacre’s and Slug & Jiggers.
Harry’s heart was pounding a loud tattoo in his chest that he was sure Draco must be able to hear. There was a lot to unpack, but all that tumbled from his lips was, “That’s really not romantic.”
“Oh, yes, yes now I recall: the Charms classroom where you reassured me
full of owl treats if you’ll do it? Do you have a flavour preference or anything? George said Eeylops started selling a new ‘Cinnamon Pumpkin Tripe’ flavour after the equinox, and that sounds absolutely disgusting to me, but I’m not an owl, so what do I know?” He slowly extended the hand holding the parchment. “
; instead, he said something stupid like, “Try not to forget everything over break,” and, “I’m not starting over from the beginning come next term.”
The whole Weasley clan was in attendance—even Charlie was in for a dragon-tamers’ conference—along with a smattering of Harry’s schoolmates: Neville, Luna, Seamus, and Dean. Hagrid had been invited but hadn’t been able to get away from the restoration work and sent his regards, along with a rock cupcake slathered with ruby-red icing and bright yellow frosting piped into a 1-8. They had been instructed to arrive early, as gifts were to be handled before dinner, and Harry milled about, playing the host and greeting his guests, while Mrs. Weasley dashed around the kitchen putting the finishing touches on Harry’s birthday meal.
And because Draco was very sharp, he finally saw what Potter was trying to do: tell him, gently, politely, that he wanted Draco to leave.
Now, he could easily avoid Potter, of course—there were perfectly respectable roosts well out of Potter’s reach, and with one more well-positioned shit, Potter would probably never bother him again.
Draco lifted a brow. “Why on earth would that offend me?” Potter only stared at him in blank confusion, so Draco moved on. Potter’s head was a strange space; no sense in wasting time trying to pick him apart. “Those ‘like, three other homes’ are scattered around the globe, meant for holidays and business trips. How exactly were we meant to pop over to wizarding Paris when we aren’t allowed to leave Britain? Besides—” He gave a sniff, fixing his eyes on the issue of

Potter kicked him lightly in the shin. “Well you’ve gotta get ‘em started early if you want to make good fliers out of them.”
Harry rolled his eyes with a chuckle. “God you’re such a spoilt prick.” He shook his head. “Seriously? There’s never been
Draco was never going to know peace at mealtimes again, he was starting to accept. It was just a fact of life. There were certain immutable truths to the world—peacocks were always going to shit on anything that stood still long enough, Borgin was never going to part with that lovely emerald jewel he kept in a glass case over the register in his shop no matter how many times Draco’s father asked after it, and breakfast in the Great Hall was always going to be a fraught affair if your name was Draco Malfoy.
“Go on to where?” Draco asked quietly.
“The thing is…” He wavered for a moment, unwilling to put into words the thought that had been coursing through his mind for so long. “Do you think it’s worse to just do the Dementor’s Kiss and that be the end of it? Or to spend the rest of your life in Azkaban? At least with the Kiss, you won’t really know what's going on, will you? You’ll just be…there. So which is worse? And which does he deserve?”
“How did you manage to cut yourself across the joint like that, then? You were shredding Boomslang.”
“No.” He could still feel Slughorn’s eyes on them. “God, I wish he’d look away.”
“Your father, Draco—the Ministry—tonight, they’re going to—”
“You saved my life.”
“You don’t have to come with me, you know,” Draco said. “I can do it myself.”
“Well, yeah. I’ve had years of practice.”
“Put down your quills,” Vector’s voice finally came. She raised her wand and fifteen pages of parchment swooped towards her desk; Abbott, who had still been writing, gave a little cry as her chart snuck out from under her quill. “Now, please open your textbooks and turn to page fifty-five. Today, we’ll be discussing…”
“Let’s try something else. A Shield Charm,” Potter said suddenly.
“Tell me. Was it bad? Was it…was Macnair there?”
“You will!” she said, brightening. “Nobody will bother us with you around. And I thought maybe, if it looks like you’re okay with it, then the others might be, too.”
Harry took a sip of his tea. Not knowing what else to do, Draco followed suit. After a moment, Harry said, “Can you tell me anything about him? From when you were younger?”
“We were old Slytherin friends, back in the day. And he rather enjoyed having an insider at the Ministry. He never mentioned me?”
“I don’t know how I feel about this new, optimistic Harry Potter,” he said, sitting back in his chair. “You were always so moody and angry. I’m not sure this is an improvement.”
“Mother,” he breathed, rising to his feet. Dressed in black robes that threatened to swallow her up, she looked smaller and more frightened than Draco had ever seen her. She blinked down at Draco as though she didn’t quite believe that he was there.
“Lubricant spell,” Draco noted. “Nonverbal, too. Impressive.”
“I think you’re tired,” Pansy said tersely. “You should go back to bed.”
Goyle said nothing. Instantly he felt terrible. Deflating as his anger seeped away, he murmured, “Sorry, forget it.” They worked in silence, each taking turns attempting to transfigure the lizard, although by now it was a lost cause.
“Yeah. I couldn’t see past Voldemort. So once he was gone, I didn’t really know where that left me.”
“That was…” Potter let out a shaky breath. “That was awful.”
At last, Proudfoot asked, “And how are your classes?”
“And I need to go to Honeydukes,” said Millicent. “My cousin’s in Bangalore and I have a list of sweets she’s asked me to send her.”
“Take a deep breath,” Harry said. “Can I hug you?”
“It’s true, though,” she protested. “For the rest of us too, probably, but Draco especially. Your family must have burned all their bridges by now.”
“What…what have you done?” he said faintly.
Draco raised his eyebrows. “Meaning what?”
“It’s not fair,” Harry insisted. “You were the same age as us—you were a
“I wouldn’t care, you know,” Harry said, his voice suddenly serious. He abandoned his boots and turned to look Draco in the eye. “If everyone knew. I’ll kiss you in the middle of the entrance hall if you want.”
“You…you also like rewarding me, don’t you?”
” He should have been horrified at himself for being so forward, but he couldn’t be bothered. Not when he was crying so hard that his lungs hurt.
“At least no essay,” Daphne said brightly. “And I heard there’s steak and kidney pie for dinner tonight.”
Draco rolled his eyes and, with a sharp flick of his wand, cast a Cooling Charm. “No. We’ve been inside all day.”
. They’re worried you’re going to escape. They plan to give you to the dementors at that hearing. They’re going to use the…the…” Draco couldn’t bring himself to say it.
Harry wound his arms behind Draco’s neck and pulled him in for a soft kiss. “I do hate being in the papers. But you know I’ll take any opportunity to show everyone that you’re mine. In fact…” Harry pulled away, studying Draco’s neck critically. “Let’s get you to bed. I need to mark you up before tomorrow.”
Before Potter could respond, Draco snapped at a nearby Hufflepuff, “Straighten your arm out. You look like a limp noodle.”
Not knowing what else to do, Draco complied. Looking around nervously, he saw that the room hadn’t changed much at all since the last time he had been here. Draco expected Harry to sit next to him, but instead he sat across from him on Weasley’s bad, cross-legged. As they faced each other, Draco’s stomach performed all sorts of gymnastics. He was quite faint.
“Right. Harry.”
“Where are we going, Potter?” he asked sharply.
Greg had been placed in an incredibly dull position in a lower-ranking office. Privately, Draco suspected that the placement was a punishment, while also serving to keep him from causing any trouble. While Harry had also spoken at Greg’s hearing, the fact remained that he had cursed several students in their seventh year at Hogwarts, and that he and his father had not switched allegiances at the end. It was a wonder they had managed to find a placement for him at the Ministry. Perhaps Harry had put in a word for him. Glancing over at the Gryffindor table, Draco studied Harry as he spoke animatedly with the girl Weasley. Before he could stop himself, jealousy reared angrily in his chest. He looked back down at his bowl, urging himself to take a bite, but now he felt sicker than ever.
“Oh, it’s alright,” Lavender said. “The Floo panel isn’t the most interesting department, is it? And what I do isn’t difficult; I just review the requests to connect grates by Floo. If I approve them, it’s Theo’s side that sets everything up.”
“Take off your bottoms,” Draco gasped into Harry’s mouth. “Please? I want to taste you.”
“And what about your biography, Harry?” Parvati asked. “It’s just come out today.”
Draco whipped his wand through the air and Potter’s spell rebounded off his Shield Charm. There was a burst of applause from the Slytherins, led by Pansy, who was beaming at him; he rolled his eyes. “The point is,” he said, “you can react before your opponent knows what you’re going to do. And you can perform magic much more quickly. But it takes a lot of practice. Pick one spell you know well and then work at it until you’re able to cast nonverbally every time you try it. Then move on to another one. It’s going to take a lot of practice.”
At the look on Harry’s face, Ron muttered, “Come on, let’s get out of here.” They wove their way towards the apothecary, where Hermione refreshed her potions supplies. It was wonderfully cool and dark inside the little shop, and mostly empty—no doubt thanks to the lingering smell of rotting eggs and cabbage. Still, it was a nice reprieve from the busy street, where people gawked at them and asked for autographs. Most of the shopkeepers were used to Harry’s presence by now; he had spent the better part of the summer in Diagon Alley. But he had not been prepared for the fresh crowds of students and parents, all craning their necks to get a look at him.
Draco scowled at him, but he didn’t notice.
“I think it has to be that one,” Harry said shakily. “But Draco—in the memory—we didn’t see—what did he do?”
“What should we do?”
“From what the other faculty have told me, you’ve been very quiet this year. Not spending much time with your usual gang, or stirring up trouble as you used to. How did Professor Flitwick put it? ‘It’s as though Mr. Malfoy has returned to us this year as a ghost of himself.’”
“You were going to die,” Draco whispered.
“Oh, I don’t know. They’re getting in new swan-feather ones.”
“You’ve never been with a bloke?”
“Er.” He glanced over at Harry, who nodded. “It is, yeah.”
Slumping back, Draco read over his notes again when Greg suddenly said, “I know what you’re doing with Potter.”
“Oh, excuse me for caring about you,” she snapped.
“I hate sketching evergreens,” Blaise moaned as they trudged along after her. “I can never get the needles right.”
“It isn’t right,” he said, not caring how stupid he sounded. “The things I’ve done—you have no idea, we haven’t even seen—I’m positive we haven’t seen the worst of it, because I can still remember—”
“I’m sure we can all agree on that,” Daphne said brightly.
“Shall I get us another round, then?” Pansy asked, somewhat breathlessly.
“I’ll keep being ridiculous, then,” Draco teased.
Draco couldn’t help but smirk when he saw the blanket Harry had conjured: blue with a bronze border. “I thought you said I’m spoiled.”
“No. Maybe. I don’t know.” Draco ran his hands over his face, exasperated. “I hate him. If it weren’t for all of you pestering me, I could go my whole life without speaking to him and be perfectly happy.”
“That’s right,” she said.
“Ah, right.” Harry reached forward and took his hand. “I don’t care, you know. I don’t care at all. I’d have you right here on the table if you’d let me.”
to practice, what to practice. You’re brilliant.”
Harry brought his hand up. Draco had the wild thought that Harry was about to cup his face, but he hesitated before clasping his shoulder. “I’ll talk to Hermione. She might know what to do.”
“We’ve already voted,” she said. Her Patronus, a small, silver-feathered owl, was hooting angrily at them.
“Father,” Draco said in alarm, “your lawyers have to do something. It’s barbaric. Write to Shacklebolt, he’s not unreasonable, you told me once—"
“Oh.” Harry seemed to deflate somewhat.
All day Friday, Pansy, Daphne, and Millicent nattered on about the trip to Hogsmeade. McGonagall had gotten wind of their plans somehow, and at dinner, she sternly reminded them to make good choices and to avoid disrupting the younger students. The eighth years tittered throughout her lecture. Draco had given in to Pansy’s nagging and agreed to come—but only for an hour. By the time they left the castle and headed for Hogsmeade, it was growing dark, and the sun had nearly set. Nott insisted that they visit Honeydukes first so that he could stock up on sugar quills and toffees. The shop was as busy as ever: children trailing after their parents, demanding sweets; people squeezing through the aisles to get to their confectionaries of choice; and a large group of witches who stood giggling over a barrel of Every Flavoured Beans. Draco wove through the stacks of sweets, pausing to peruse a bucket of Fizzing Whizzbees. He was nervous, not least of all because he risked coming face-to-face with Madam Rosmerta. There was also the question of whether the other eighth years were actually willing to have a drink with the Slytherins, something Draco doubted very much. At last, Nott made his purchases and they headed for the Three Broomsticks.
“Why didn’t you mention this before?” Draco asked. “That you’ve seen a Healer?”
“I’ve liked you,” Harry said, a note of amusement in his voice, “ever since the mouse.”
“Well, yes, go on, then, but
“He is? He never mentioned it.” Too late, Draco realized what he had said.
As the pain dissipated, Draco said, “Okay. Pull out and then in again—but slowly. Slowly.”
“Mine’s wonky.” Blaise held out his sketch, frowning at it. “It looks crooked.”
“Don’t you dare touch me,” he spat. “Where’s my cloak?”
“Mmm.” Harry drummed his hands on the table.
“Okay,” he breathed. “Let’s do it, then.”
Slowly, Draco sat next to him. “Who was he?”
“Make something up. Say you have detention.” Potter pushed past him and slipped back indoors. Draco stood there for a moment, staring at the entryway. He must have absolutely lost his mind. The whole thing was mad. Surely there must be other students, even faculty, lining up to teach Saint Potter how to do nonverbal magic. And they had been enemies for years now. Even if Potter, like himself, probably thought their rivalry rather childish now, it didn’t change the fact that there was almost a decade of animosity between them. Perhaps Potter’s final battle with the Dark Lord had given him a serious brain injury. Or maybe the Ministry had Potter spying on him; he certainly had enough experience. Draco suspected that he had just made a terrible mistake.
“What’s that?” Harry asked, drawing his hands away.
“Well, I do,” he said flatly. “I feel stupid every time I complain about them to you. But it’s just…it’s so difficult. I don’t understand them. If I had a child, I would do anything I could to protect them. If I thought it was either them or me—either they became a Death Eater, or I died—I would die. I would be glad to.”
He was quickly coming to realize how many of Harry’s expressions he had grown to like over the years—the bemused look currently occupying his face was one of his favourites. Needing urgently to feel Harry’s lips on him again, Draco tugged him forward. Softly, so softly that it made Draco’s heart ache, Harry brought his hands up to cradle Draco’s head. Harry’s weight against him was comforting, an anchor preventing him from drifting off. He felt, for the briefest of moments, what he swore was Harry’s erection pressing into his thigh, and that was nearly too much for him. It was very difficult to resist pulling off Harry’s bloody cloak; his hands wanted desperately to do it. He distracted himself by weaving his fingers through that mess of hair.
Theo looked as though he wanted to say something else—Draco, his heart sinking, suspected it had something to do with visiting their fathers in Azkaban—but he was cut off by Lavender, who had taken his hand and was tugging at him. “Come on, Theo, I’d like to get home sometime this week.”
“That’s wrong,” said Draco, pointing at one of the runes Daphne had labeled. “That one there means ‘sun.’”
“And I do care. Don't be a prat. I care about you.”
The last day of the Christmas holidays found Draco and Harry meandering along the path to the lake. Draco kept peering up at the sky—Daphne was in Dublin for her audition, and he was expecting a letter from her at any moment. Harry, meanwhile, had already received letters from his friends earlier that morning. He read them aloud to Draco as they walked, explaining the contents and making interjections where necessary.
Suddenly, Potter reached down and undid Draco’s belt buckle. He yanked down Draco’s trousers and pants, swatting away his hands with a frustrated snarl as Draco tried to reach for Potter’s zip. He dared not complain as Potter took him in hand, pumping roughly. It was so sudden, so unexpected, that he gave a sharp gasp. In response, Potter laced his hand through Draco’s hair and brought their lips together again. They kissed, and it was nothing like the gentle, cautious kiss they had shared Tuesday night. This was raw, fiery, a fight for dominance as Potter continued to stroke him. Draco couldn’t help but moan as Potter bit down on his bottom lip—the metallic taste of blood should have angered him but only served to arouse him further.
“Draco,” Harry said. “Pull down your collar. Let me see your neck.”
“I hope I didn’t upset you in class, Draco,” Daphne muttered. “Please eat something. I feel awful.”
“It is, but I’ve known how to open it since I was seven.” Draco brought his palm to rest against the centre of the door. He waited one, two, three seconds, and then turned the knob widdershins. The door opened. They crept into the office, which looked exactly how his father had left it, save for the Pensieve sat upon his desk. Runes were carved around the edges, while the basin was filled with a silvery light.
“I’m not,” he protested. “I thought you’d have noticed me watching whenever you...well, anyway...”
“Yeah,” he managed to say.
“Why’s that?”
“Sometimes it was,” Harry said. His voice was hardly more than a whisper. “But after everything…” He trailed off, shaking his head. “I don’t want to do anything you don’t want to do.”
There was an uncomfortable silence as everyone stared down at their plates. Pansy broke it by saying, in an overly-cheery voice, “Blaise played, too. And I thought he was very good.”
“There are rumours Professor Slughorn wants to go back to his retirement,” she said, still pressing on in that overly cheery voice. “Teaching Potions would be quite fascinating, wouldn’t it? You’ve always been strong in Potions.”
“That’s because you have double servings of everything,” Pansy quipped.
“I thought you loved it there.”
As they reached the seventh floor, Draco thought they were headed for the Room of Requirement, but instead Potter led him down a separate passage. He only realized where they were going when they stopped at the Fat Lady’s portrait.
Nott opened his mouth to reply, but before he could, Greg said quietly, “I like it. Give us something to do. We won’t be at Hogwarts forever.”
“You dodged that Bludger easily. You caught the Snitch so quickly Harper couldn’t sort out what was happening.”
“Fuck,” Draco muttered, sitting up straighter in his chair. He didn’t care about losing, not really, but he wanted to put up a bit of a fight.
“Yeah. I guess that’s how Kreacher knew who you were.”
“You’re afraid the Mark will come back.”
Draco let out the breath he had been holding. “Well,” he said flatly. “It couldn’t be helped.”
