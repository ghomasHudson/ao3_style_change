: I'm just surprised you want to. You're the one who keeps saying that I live in a mud hut.
"I... don't remember us saying anything about us being together," Harry points out. He half expects Draco to answer ‘What do you mean, we had this conversation two weeks ago’ which would confirm the parallel universe theory.
Yep. Completely sure of it.
"Tell me more."
"Still, it was insensitive of me."
Harry turns around to greet Draco... Only he didn't expect to see him several feet off the ground. No wonder he smacked branches.
But if Harry is to do this job, he's going to do it right. Which brings him to the first thing he can think of, faced with armies of complicated books.
"Don't worry about it. Felt like you needed it."
. Harry, what have you gotten into again?"
"How different?" Draco asks in a voice that pretends to be light and unbothered. But Harry knows better.
“Apology accepted,” Draco says in an amused tone. Then he sighs again. "If it takes you this long to consider us together, this is probably too soon to ask about children."
The Prince groans while the Queen makes a delicate little chuckling sound.
"Quite."
"I suppose any sofa here would feel nice compared to your hut."
?" Harry purrs.
"Yup," Harry agrees unabashedly as he kicks his trousers and pants down to the store floor. Then he straightens up and gives Draco a giddy look.
"Like I'd listen," Harry answers with a shrug. "But no. We talked. They don't exactly like you, but they're not going to chase you away with pitchforks." At least Remus won’t, Harry doesn’t add out loud.
"Yeah, sure," he says distractly, more focused on the large bale of lucerne he's trying to unpack so his animals will have enough food while he's gone.
"Sirius, this is besides the point. You need to tell him."
: The paperwork is threatening to drown me. Please send help.
Harry let himself fall onto the sofa. Where to even begin?
Harry's fingers lightly pinch the cat ear, making his partner moan softly.
Harry drops two cubes of sugar in his own tea, which Kitten makes a face at.
"Yes, Sir. We're eleven elves all working together, tis very fun. Tis more lively than managing an estate all on your own."
"Yeah, you were great. So needy yet so obedient," Harry teases.
"We haven't
"I'm sure he knows what he's doing. He's been studying this for longer than you."
Harry has the words 'It doesn't, what kind of dumbass question is that?' halfway to his lips when his brain catches up with his mouth, in time to try to come up with a better answer. Even if it's a complete lie. That doesn’t make him a bad person, right? It’s not really a lie if it’s just tact.
"If he liked being with you, he would make time for you."
"What?"
"I'm okay, just..." Harry sighs.
"Did you wear one too?"
"IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT? YOU WANT TO GO? TO ABANDON YOUR DUTY, YOUR COUNTRY, FOR A TEENAGE CONTRARIANT FANTASY?"
“Okay. So we have, uh… a scarf. A bejeweled scarf.”
"Not really. The new wards wake me up sometimes."
"Harry?" Kitten asks, just a touch of worry in his trembling voice.
"How long will you be in that state?"
"For you, anything."
"Mmmmh yesss. Please."
Harry scratches where the cat ears would be. The Prince groans in pleasure.
Draco sighs at her. Then turns toward Harry, and Harry recognises these mercurial eyes, this long bright hair, this crease between his eyebrows. His face is different, which is
Harry did wonder about that. Did he know Kitten from Hogwarts in his true identity? They don't look too far apart in age.
"Yeah but that wasn't very illuminating. The renewal of the wards of Great Britain? I don't know the first thing about wards. I'm not sure what you want me to do here."
"Is that a request to reveal confidential sources?" a tall white-haired witch asks with a sneer.
Kitten snorts.
Harry takes a moment to consider this woman in front of him, clad in black and sipping tea while trashing the Prince and talking about the Queen like a childhood friend. He doesn't know which side she's on, only that she’s not an ally. Knowing that, how should he treat the advice she intends to give him? If she was a hippogriff, he would show her respect to earn her trust. If she was a dragon, he would fight her and force her to submit to his authority. Unfortunately, she's neither, and Harry has never learned how to handle a human. Even worse, a noble human. Probably a pureblood, though his inner Hermione immediately chastises him for stereotyping blood status. In the end, his Gryffindor instincts instruct him to just go for it, and handle consequences later.
"At the risk of being blunt, Lord Potter, I don't believe Draco is ready for this. Not yet. The last time he attempted to perform the ceremony, fourteen years ago, it was, frankly, a disaster."
"We don't curse people, we've been over this."
"Okay, I get it."
Yeah. He sure did.
"How are you doing?" Harry yells against the wind.
"For what?"
"Do you wanna come, sweetheart?" Harry murmurs directly into his ear, then bites it.
With his activities for the day decided, he scourgifies his coffee cup and starts to prepare sandwiches, when a knock echoes on his door.
"Definitely." Kitten beams.
. Think you can do that?"
Delicately, Harry releases the pressure and Kitten whines.
Harry sighs and lets his hands fall in his lap.
“Oh, I did.”
"I'm sorry!" Neville blurts out, the silence too much for him. "I swear I didn't know you were kept in the dark, I mean I wasn't sure, but at first I thought... Maybe I should have tried to broach the subject, it seems obvious from here, but I didn't want to make you uncomfortable, and I really didn't..."
"Why didn't you tell us it was him?" Sirius asks with a frown.
"Yes. The wards." Draco clears his throat. "What you need to know first, is that the wards of Great Britain are powered by the magic of the land and of its people."
"Afraid not."
"What an astute observation, Harry. You impress me more each day."
She twirls her wand toward the destroyed furniture. It disappears, piece by piece, leaving only empty, clean space behind.
"You'll get more, I promise. But don't you want to be good to me, too?"
"Ah, that's the right one."
"Stupid question to ask in a potion lab, I guess."
And now he has absolutely no chance of finding his shy unicorn for at least the next three days.
"It was a long time ago," Harry answers. "I'm sure Draco has grown a lot since then."
And he feels it, Kitten's pleasure pumping through his nerves. The endorphins and dopamine that shoot through his veins at his command. The particular taste of his pleased magic. He can feel it shake, trying to escape his ministrations, but Harry grabs it and keeps it
Right?
Draco goes silent again, but this time Harry recognises that he's gathering his thoughts. He gives him his time. They're still walking, now through what seems to be a lesser-used part of the Palace. The corridors are smaller, less richly-decorated, and they haven't seen anyone else in a while now.
you where it counts. That said... I never realised how many little things about life we never talked about. Like what we did at Hogwarts. What position we play in Quidditch. I think... I think I missed this, but I never realised. Until now."
"I thought we agreed, last time, that it was your turn subbing."
"Let's go then."
"What's the next step?" Harry asks, his fingers running through blond hair.
"Harry, this isn't..." Remus hesitates to say.
"With how well you seemed to know my life yesterday, I'm surprised you don't know how my parents died."
When Lady Zabini finally releases him, Harry closes the door behind him and slides to the ground.
"To take care of you while you're without magic?"
"You're on."
"Uh, yeah. From first to seventh year."
"I know," Harry answers in a small voice. "I..." He takes a breath, and jumps the cliff. "Draco talked to me about the Black family."
"I'll tell you if my plans materialise."
Harry gently caresses his shoulder in a reassuring gesture.
"So they... ignore you?"
: Your dick would be an acceptable form of help.
Just as Harry breathes, thinking things are going to be easy for a little while, the plug starts to vibrate.
"So, what do you have in mind for today?" Harry asks when Kitten is sufficiently relaxed, not stopping his scratching and petting.
Harry's distracted spell-casting makes half of the lucerne roll down from the neat pile. Thankfully Remus gets his wand out just in time and prevents a total collapse.
"We saw each other a week ago. You're such a sap."
of the woods. Not the dirtiness." Draco sneers at the ground, like he expects it to feel ashamed and clean itself up.
"... Is it because I'm here?"
Harry just shrugs. He follows Sirius into the kitchen, where Remus is already warming up milk for tea. They exchange pleasantries. It's almost a normal family scene, if not for the tension just under his skin.
In response, Kitten rolls over on his back to strike a more appealing picture. His hair flows all over Harry's lap.
"Great! I really need a good fuck."
"Didn't you say that you two have known each other for years, Draco?"
Obedient, Kitten does so, and his tail swishes through the air. Harry strokes one buttock.
"Kitten..." Harry whispers against his lips.
Harry has to take a second to take all of that in. So Sirius knows Draco’s family… They’re in fact the same family.
"Turn around. Show me your ass."
Immediate silence answers him. Perfect. He'll master the 'raise a hand and they all shut up' spell in no time.
Harry emerges, gasping for breath.
the Queen of Great Britain, Harry," Draco reminds him. "Great Britain is her charge."
Harry slightly slows down his broom. The thestrals fly up front, then turn and start to go down to the forest.
"Let me hear your voice," Harry demands.
"No. Why would...?" She gasps. "Do you mean...?!"
"Are you okay?" Sirius asks, worry in his eyes, passing a hand through Harry's hair.
"Draco... You really like him?" Remus asks.
"Harry!" Draco raises his voice, visibly fed up. The thestrals prudently back away. "We've frequented each other for two years. I've introduced you to my mother. We've seen each other at work. I just walked through mud to stay with you! Mud!“ He points dramatically to his dirty shoes. “Tell me. In this bizarre universe residing in your head, what exactly is missing from our relationship to be a "real" relationship already?"
Harry bites his lip.
"Child raising books..." Remus continues, lost in memories. "I was so terrified of hurting you." He strokes Harry's back abstently. "The books warned about reproducing your parent's harmful behaviour on your children, even if you want nothing less."
"If talking about your boyfriend causes you so much trouble then..."
"It has, hasn't it? We definitely have to do it soon then. We don't want my skills to go rusty."
"Wanna watch?" Harry proposes.
"What are you waiting for? Go. I won't bother stopping you this time." She turns toward them, having run out of things to destroy. "I won't kill you. It's more than you deserve, but I shall give you this last parting gift. You're not my child anymore. You're dead to me. I only have one son, his name is Regulus, and he's the heir to the throne. No one will ever say otherwise from this day forward. Now, disappear. Before I have to make you disappear."
: If it's not too much trouble of course.
"Okay everyone, first rule of interviewing Harry Potter: No flashes and no talking loudly," Harry says, loudly, because he has no choice if he wants to get heard above the cacophony.
has to work and needs to stay focused on his potion, makes it extra hot. Draco is a serious adult, with actual responsibilities. While Harry's fingering himself open like he has nothing to do in life besides waiting for sex.
"Should have guessed that dressing up properly would make you faint," Draco teases as he puts back on more casual clothes.
They talk, late into the night. The other patrons come and go but no one stays in the teashot as long as they do. Harry would have stayed even longer if he didn't have any obligation.
"We frequent the same teashop," the Prince volunteers and, yeah, close enough.
: Oooooh right.
"What are you, a nymphomaniac? You're covered in your own come and asking for more."
: Will do kitten. I'm hopping in the shower rn. See you in a bit.
"You're pulling our leg," Ron says.
the Prince of their country.
Harry looks up at the ceiling, thinking.
"Do you also have lube in your pocket?"
Draco gives him a look that makes him feel stupid instantly.
"Please, I'm just Draco. I'm not here in any official capacity." There's stress in Draco's voice. Why is there stress in Draco's voice?
The next day he floos at Hermione and Ron's place to work with Hermione on the wards. She's being fantastic: she read all of the material Draco gave, plus some other books she found who-knows-where, and made him little summary cards. She's an angel.
"That's... true. But we can't say either that we don't have any kind of relationship. After all, we've been frequenting each other for over two years now."
So instead of being angry, he just feels like shit.
A dozen photograph flashes greet him.
"Potions," Draco answers immediately.
Harry stares stupidly at the empty space where Draco was. There goes the honeymoon haze. He turns toward Sirius.
It’s the end of their evening. Harry summons the clothes he disapparated off Kitten’s back earlier. Kitten gets dressed, then takes off his collar and puts it in Harry’s hands. Harry accepts the gift, and gives the cat ear a last scritch.
: The unicorns don't like me being a public figure.
Harry raises his eyebrows at her.
"No way was I going to put you through the shite that was my childhood. So I bottled it up," Sirius says as he rummages through the unlabeled bottles of pale grey memories. "Now, to find the right one."
"Ready for a
When they're finished Harry collapses on a sofa, exhausted.
"You're not going to talk about your weird sex life, right?" he asks, a little green.
"Aaah..."
When Harry opens his eyes, Kitten is in the same position as before, the bag still on the top of his head.
Kitten blinks, disoriented for a second. His hands search purchase into the air before he gets the presence of mind to turn over. He gets on all fours, his cat ears standing at attention.
This conversation is quickly sending him into a parallel universe. Are they together? When did this happen? Did he hit his head and forgot entire parts of his life?
"Who are you?" She demands of Remus, who can't do much more than lay in the bed.
Before he can ask ‘Excuse-me, what the fuck?’, the dozen or so journalists start asking questions all at the same time.
They share a look. Again. They seem to reach the decision that Sirius is the one who should talk.
They watch each other silently for a moment. There's something uncomfortable in the air. Harry doesn't quite know what to say. His Gryffindor boldness pushes him to say the first thing that comes to mind to break the silence.
"We're going to stay a thing, right?" Harry asks. His heart starts beating with hope and worry.
Kitten makes a gesture and his wand slowly levitates out of his robe's pocket. He grabs it, then reverses the position of the wand in his hand and offers the handle to Harry. Harry's fingers close around the wand and he can feel the magic immediately responding to him with trust and familiarity. It's a powerful feeling, this wand who shouldn't be his own submitting to him easily, Kitten's magic responding to him as if it was his to hold. With this wand at his disposal he can feel Kitten's silvery magic much clearer.
"It will be work. Not as much as Mother warned. You will still have time to carry on your duties with your animals. But this is significant additional work that will probably occupy most of your free time for the next three weeks."
And to it, he gets.
Harry gulps. He can feel Draco's teeth tighten on his throat.
Harry grabs his finger, kisses it, and laughs.
Harry laughs, and kicks his broom faster. The lake disappears completely behind them. They zoom across the treetops, the wind stinging their cheeks, Draco's black robes flapping wildly. Harry only slows down when they reach a particular patch of dark forest. They now fly at a leisurely pace, their shoes brushing against the highest trees.
“Yes, but, still… We didn’t talk about it, so...”
The drowsy bird hoots and goes back to sleep, without nicking any part of him in protest, like a proper magical animal. Gods, Harry should really be doing a better job raising his hippogriffs.
There is a tiny smile hiding behind the teacup.
"This is a terrible joke, even for you!"
"You've been so good, you deserve it. You hear me right? You're being such a good boy right now. Such a good boy."
"Just because she's particularly unpleasant doesn't make her a villain, Mister Gryffindor brain.” Draco looks slightly annoyed… by Harry’s comment, or Lady Zabini’s behaviour?  “Be reassured, she's very loyal to the crown. She wouldn't sabotage the wards. But I will take a look, if that reassures you."
The Prince rolls his eyes.
"I'm talking about the ceremonial bath, naturally," she adds, though Harry has no doubt the double-entendre was entirely intentional.
Draco takes Harry's hands in his.
Harry nods.
"Do you?" Remus asks.
Harry shakes his head.
She looks him up and down, her gaze calculating.
"A Dark Lord. My apologies. I... forgot."
"I won't let that happen to you again. You know that, right?"
The Prince turns around, revealing his back. It’s the first time Harry can truly see it, free from the usual concealment charm. It's covered in red scars. A blade has traced runes of blood arranged in two rows on each side of his spine, circled by the outline of a shield.
Harry stands up quickly and walks around the coffee table. He puts his hand on the Prince's chin, goes for a kiss... and stops, just a moment. This is not the face he's used to kiss, and his brain can't help thinking he's forcing himself on a complete stranger.
"They've been looking new for fourteen years. Can you read it?"
"Mmmh... Let's try downstairs. See who's here." Kitten finally decides.
: How can you live and be this dumb.
domming?"
what he means and Harry grows even more uncomfortable.
Draco rolls his eyes and walks away, muttering imprecations.
: Apparate at my cabin, I'll send my patronus to collect you.
Does he want children? Maybe. He sees that as something somewhat distant, something to daydream about. Not something to decide right now. Does he want children now? Isn't twenty a bit young to have children? He still wants a few more years of childless freedom. What if he continues to want a few more years forever, and never ends up wanting the kids?
But eventually, Draco hears too. He turns, and he gasps.
Harry gets under the duvet and lets his mind wander into this imaginary home, with this imaginary family.
"I learned that they flee from anyone who isn't a girl."
"... Tell me what?"
"Want to see him cover himself in his own cum?"
happening around all of that. I have several different sets of robes that you will need to put on and off me, blessed wine to drink, baths to take, priests to recite prayers to, and more. But that's details." Draco makes a dismissive gesture. "You'll have ample time to learn about those. Later. Because now..."
"The throne thing," Draco repeats, unimpressed.
After having seen Sirius's mother shooting two AKs at Remus, Harry understands better their anxiety.
: Since SOMEBODY is always complaining that I take forever to answer, I'm taking it with me these days.
"We're both busy with work."
Merlin, he's thinking about it.
"No, it's not just that!"
Draco shrugs, an uncharacteristic motion for him. Is he embarrassed?
As he floos in, he wonders if he should talk to them about what he uncovered concerning Sirius's past. It's too fresh, too confusing, and he feels like he needs some time to process it before being able to discuss it. But at the same time, it's the only thing he can think about. They're bound to ask why he's so distracted. And when they do, what should he say?
: Are you home right now?
"I know you will," Draco answers in an almost bored tone. "I wouldn't have revealed my identity to you otherwise."
"I mean..." Sirius clicks his teeth. "I don't think you should trust him, or his sort."
"Apologies accepted," Draco answers very seriously. "Please, don't let me interrupt your work. I'm content to follow."
Oh, how he loves the desperation in Kitten's voice. Harry grips his thigh, spreads it wider.
"Let's see how you fare then..." Draco smirks, and drops a gemstone into his cauldron.
If Draco is to live here, he would need to rebuild the whole thing to make more room, Harry muses as he crosses his living room in two strides. He pushes the door to his bedroom and squeezes into the small space. They would need a double bed. Draco would need a study. If he’s daydreaming about renovations, why not add a bedroom or two for children? Draco did say he wanted children.
Harry rolls his eyes, irritated.
The very first thing Harry hears is the loud crack of an apparition. Then, the scene materialises around him.
"Yes, I'm not very surprised," the Prince says while looking at his clothes with this little sneer that means his noble sensibilities are bruised. And this is so
"Then I don't know what else to tell you," Harry says, spreading his hands.
"Oh. You mean for the throne thing," Harry says once his brain has catched up with him.
"Aaaah... thank youuu." Kitten moans.
"I'm not gonna land. I'm waiting for them to join us."
They get into a small room connecting to several areas, with just one bed in the corner. Harry immediately recognizes Luna, who is laying there with another body sprawled all over her. Harry catches her eyes and gives her a polite wave, not wanting to interrupt her scene by saying hi.
"... I'm horny," he whispers against Harry's lips.
"No! It's true he hid his name and face but that's just a word and, well, a face. I
"That's right, you're so pretty. Isn't he?" Harry asks the crowd.
"What are you talking about?" Hermione asks, to both Harry and Neville. "Does Sirius have trouble with the Black family?"
: Banter apart, I'm a little bit stressed at the moment. The calmness of the woods combined with seeing you seems wonderful.
"EVERYTHING I'VE TRIED TO TEACH YOU! EVERYTHING I'VE DONE FOR YOU! FOR YOU TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE CHILD!"
"... Is it really about Slytherin?" Harry asks, though he doubts that's the answer. He turns toward Remus. "What aren't you telling me?"
Harry gets up from his spot on the floor.
They walk together on the path that circles the loch, as Harry continues casting. The magic of the forest knows him and kindly allows to be redirected.
"I can imagine yes," she says, carefully neutral. "Well, I'm very glad to have had an occasion to finally meet you, Lord Potter." She puts her cup down, visibly preparing to leave.
With a caress along his back, Harry returns his attention to Kitten's backside. His ass and tights are red and a simple flick of the fingers makes Kitten produce a little whine.
"You're so full of yourself." Draco huffs.
"How are you feeling?"
Perfect.
"I realise that I don't know everything about him yet. I don't know what skeletons lie in his cauldron. But... We have something. And I don't want to abandon him because of who his grand-aunt happens to be."
"You’re mental. You think him being the Prince is so important, but it’s not. It’s just Draco and me, being together, because we like each other. Nothing else."
"Wanna go downstairs..." The public area. "...or upstairs?" The private rooms.
"Hey Neville. Did you know about Sirius and the Black family?"
Harry turns his attention back to Kitten, who's still breathing heavily, gently coming down from his high. Harry vanishes his cum and spoons him. They rest on the bed for a little while longer, Kitten's breath slowly going back to a normal rhythm. Harry never ceases to caress his hair, his back, his ears.
"So you're happy here?"
: Yes. Hence my request to see you.
"Do you know Sirius's birth name?"
: My collar. The small, hard crop. Your cock.
"For the record, I didn't plan on her to be here. I told her I was waiting for you and she wouldn't leave," he grumbles.
Draco lays down next to him, head resting in his hand, and pats Harry’s shoulder.
"Okay."
Harry wets his lips.
Draco marks a pause, and blinks slowly.
"What do you want with my godson?" Sirius growls, an implied threat permeating his voice.
"Will this be enough to satisfy you for a bit, so I can go back to work?" he asks in an exasperated tone.
"Yeah, that's what the guy who was in charge of those lands did before I came along. There are Kelpies in this loch. They love snacking on humans. 'The problem solves itself,' " Harry grumbles with air-quotes. "I use repellent charms."
They're still in a palace, and it shows in the high ceilings and polished hardwood floor. But there's no golden frames nor tapestries hanging on the walls. The furniture is modern and sleek, and the decoration sparse. Everything is neat and tidy, to the point that it looks like no one actually lives here; that it's just a photoshoot set for a furniture magazine. It may be the house elves being over-zealous, Harry reasons. He spots framed photographs on the bookshelves showing Draco's family, just about the only thing that makes the place lived-in.
"Ha. Not denying it are you?"
"But you didn't pursue a professional player career? You mentioned animals."
later."
: But I digress. What prompted this? I imagine that Draco has better security to provide you than a simple apparition lock.
The whole thing costs a fortune, most of it for nothing, all paid by the Crown, which incurs an article in the
The fire goes out in Hermione's eyes, replaced by tenderness.
: No one does.
"Don't worry about it. They were Aurors, it was their job. And they got the guy with them. I imagine that without the wards, Dark Lords would be more common."
: See you soon.
"Mmmmh... Like I can take more," he teases.
"Doesn't matter." Sirius scowls. "That's the distant past. Doesn't matter now."
Harry's first instinct is to say that yeah, it makes things a little bit different.
"So why are you the one who has to go through this ceremony in three weeks? Why not her?" Harry asks, bringing his knees up to rest his chin on them.
"Hi," Harry calls from a distance, not wanting to startle a potioneer in the middle of his work.
"So, Lady Zabini filled you in with all the boring details?"
He knows him very intimately, he doesn't add, because even hinting about your sex life in front of your almost-parents is weird. But the point is, he really, really knows Kitten. No, he knows
"Very useful to get over the bumps of life," Sirius mutters, as he reaches for a shelf.
"Floaty..." Harry answers honestly. Words are complicated, and he can't find any other right now.
"You've never mentioned him to us," Remus remarks with polite curiosity. Then his eyes light up with understanding. "Oh, the one you don't know if you are dating or not?"
"All I've learned today is that there's so many ways this big ol' pile of magic can crumble down if you look at it the wrong way. And if it does, it's going to fall right on Kit... the Prince."
"Mendy is very sorry to have made Lord Potter Sir sorry," she says in a grave tone.
"SHUT THE FUCK UP! HE'S NOT A THING, HE'S THE MAN I'M GOING TO MARRY!"
He let his fingers trail over the scars. His fingertips tingle with electricity. The Prince shivers.
Harry nods.
Harry deposits a kiss to Kitten's lips, who answers with a purr.
"Please," Kitten answers in the smallest voice.
"Ah, yes, speaking about it... What's the ceremony?"
"Why are you floating?" Harry asks, trying very hard not to laugh.
"I don't want to assume," Harry says carefully. "You can have regular sex with someone without it meaning feelings and stuff."
to mean something, if you don’t want to.”
It’s true the amount of things they know about each other is not equal. Draco has this tendency to know things about Harry that aren’t secrets or anything, but that he didn’t learn from Harry himself. Harry can at least agree with Remus on that point. But for the rest...
"This story already has a great start!" Ron comments.
"Harry is also the Ministry's unofficial liaison with a number of magical creature communities such as the Centaurs."
: Someone is not carrying his instant owl parchment anymore.
Why is this so complicated?
’s where you choose to suddenly reveal your identity? And without any warning?"
"You think we're not?"
"And stop being inappropriate, we're at the Palace!"
"Do taste the tea, Lord Potter. It is exquisite."
The Prince groans again, this time in frustration.
“Just stay against me.”
Harry has a day for himself before he's scheduled to work on the wards at the castle. It's supposed to be time set aside for him to take care of his creatures and prepare everything, so his absence for the three days of the ceremony goes smoothly.
He groans out loud as he hits a good spot inside himself.
"You want me to spill all over you?"
"We can always write more shibari classes as a business expense," Draco says back.
The word stirs something inside Harry, even if he's too spaced out to understand exactly what it means. Instead of explaining more, Draco elegantly sits on the armrest and whispers a spell.
"That's nice Pads, but it's Harry and Draco's business how they choose to live their lives, as long as everyone's happy about their choices."
"We need to talk, pup. In private."
"Just a little?"
"Ah..." Kitten's eyes are unfocused, his brain delays his words. "Yes. I'll be good."
Slowly, Harry's hand creeps from the belly to the hollow of a hip bone. Then to the seam of a thigh. Kitten hums encouragingly. Harry grips the skin with his hand and the magic with his mind.
"Errr..."
He finds Kitten just where he left him, a little bit more calm, a little bit more expectant.
Remus pats his head.
: Thank you.
“You’re good with animals, obviously. Children too?”
Harry shrugs.
Should he try to formally court Draco? He loves him.
"Ready, folks?" Harry asks the crowd. "It's not something you'll see everyday."
Harry winces.
Ron immediately makes a face.
"Is this the kind of related that makes it really really weird for us to be together? Please tell me we're not half-brothers."
Draco nods and continues.
"Twenty four hours. Then, the next step is to turn the runes back on."
"Listen. I don't care if you want to jerk off on my couch. There are more interesting hobbies, but to each their own. However, you keep making those sounds, and sound disturbs my potion. I need the lab to be completely silent for ten minutes before I can progress to the next step. And if there's noise, I need to start all over again. If you stay nice and quiet, I'll give you a reward. Do you understand?"
"... Okay? Just a few questions," Harry agrees, not feeling like he has much of a choice.
"I didn't know," Harry explains. "He wore a glamour on his face. I've only known he's the Prince for a week."
Kitten cuddles closer to him.
As if reading his thoughts, Lady Zabini giggles again.
"But it has, already," Sirius says in a somber tone. "They've made us fight. They forced me to drag the past into the open."
Family.
That puts things in an entirely different perspective.
"Leave those robes off. I want to see you a bit longer."
Harry does have a seat, as a Lord, but he can't remember ever going there unless there was a law about werewolves or muggleborns being voted. And he can recall the Queen voting in the opposite direction from him in most cases, so it's probably not the best idea to mention that.
"What's bothering you?" Harry asks.
Worried, Harry strokes his hair in a lighter pattern.
Harry barks a laugh.
"Have you talked to Sirius about it?"
sliding along his dick. It's soft and warm and moves perfectly.
"Is that a new way you've found to rebel? Pretend you're fucking a dog?" She sneers.
"This is caveman mentality," Remus criticizes.
The first spank is small, a warm-up, a tease almost.
Sirius rolls over and looks emptily at the ceiling.
"She thinks Mother is a great queen. And she is. But Lady Zabini thinks a bit too highly of her, and not so highly of me in comparison. It's just the old guard thinking that the newcomers can't possibly compare to their elders. When you're young, you make mistakes, that's not a flaw of character," Draco completes with a convincing tone. Maybe a tone made to convince himself.
Kitten snorts.
"I will, I promise!"
"We're not sure it ever was something precise. The French, perhaps." The Prince chuckles. "More probably Dementors."
Draco bit his lip, looking anywhere but at him.
Harry closes his eyes to try to ignore their audience. It was hot just a second ago, to be watched by all of these eyes. But now he feels like he's making them lose their time. No, this is not a productive line of thinking. He just needs to breathe for a minute, until he's 100% present for his partner.
Children.
"No! Just..." Okay, what Sirius just said is technically true, but... "No, it's not like that."
Draco chuckles.
"I see."
: Really, muggles have mastered the technology of the locked door a long time ago. It's astonishing that wixes don't consider this necessary in an ordinary person's home.
"Fine. Really, I should have done that a long time ago. You've always been a disappointment. I could put up with you, working hard to gift you in a good marriage, and hoping your first-born would be tolerable. But if you've been tainted by this thing, there's no way a good child is coming out of you."
"You were pretty great too."
"Are you good with children too?"
"W- what do you mean?" Neville gargles.
Kitten hums softly and holds Harry close. It doesn’t take Harry long to finish after such a good scene. Afterwards, he cleans himself with a spell and they go back to cuddling. Only this time, they’re both completely relaxed.
Harry rolls Kitty's hair in his hand to bring his fingers against his scalp. His other hand grabs his partner around the chest to brace him.
"Why was he here, really?" It looks like he's asking the ceiling more than Harry.
"Because..." Normally, that's the moment when he answers 'because you love my cock in your throat' or something similar, but he remembers just in time that they are having this conversation in front of the
could escape my notice? I'm the Queen. I know all."
Harry yelps in surprise. This thing vibrates?! That's so unfair! Harry gives a desperate look toward Draco, who doesn't see it because he's nose-deep into a heavy tome.
"I said to be
"Just a friend." Remus's voice is cracking in obvious pain.
"They seem to be treating you well," the Queen says with a gesture of her teacup toward a long scratch on his arm.
Neville flinches, as if the outburst is directed at him.
"Ah."
They give him books. Armfuls of books. Complicated books.
"Yes," Kitten answers immediately, focused, ready to serve.
But there's vulnerability in his voice.
Harry is happy to oblige, and Kitten shivers all over.
"Yeah," Kitten answers, still cognisant. For now.
Lady Zabini? The one who was lecturing him just a moment ago and presented herself as the best at this job?
use simpleton terms, then yes, we are going to be ‘flushing my pipes’."
Before the break, Harry was manipulating Kitten's magic to pleasure him.
Harry closes his eyes and allows himself to succumb to pleasure. Draco's spell is brutally efficient, tearing an orgasm out of him whether he wants it or not.
She's not alone. Another figure is pacing across the room, but he stops as soon as Harry enters. The man is tall and thin, and wears long hair of the fairest blond. There's something strange in the way he looks at Harry.
"And no one has bothered trying to break this spell? This obstruction of history is preposterous!" Hermione fulminates.
"Sirius, I don't need... I just wanted to know a bit, you don't have to show me your memories."
"Perfect," the Queen says. "Please take care of my son, Lord Potter."
And so, Draco makes him wait.
"Boyfriends."
Harry understands exactly where this is going and his dick responds accordingly.
"HOW DARE YOU BRING THIS THING—"
"A firebolt. It's a bit of an older model but I'm used to it and I don't find the newer models to be worth a change yet."
The mystery of Sirius's family may have an answer. And Draco is sure to have that answer.
Could that Draco be trying to take advantage of him, really?
"No. I have to show you," he says, examining another memory in the light of the day. "You need to understand exactly the kind of people they are."
Fuck.
"Use your words. We're not fucking until you tell me what's on your mind."
Harry turns on his side and dives into those mercurial eyes. The Draco who is patiently waiting while he thinks, who's listening and using his communication skills to help him sort out his feelings. The Draco who isn't mad that they're taking time away from ceremony training to address his family issues.
"I see where you got your wonderful manners, Harry," Draco breaks the ice with a deadpan tone that means he's definitely more amused than offended.
"I guess this is for the first day. The cleansing part," Harry says as he approaches the mannequin on the left.
"We'd just like to ask a few questions to the ward assistant!"
But Luna smiles invitingly.
"Pet me," he commands, his eyes closed.
"Yes."
"Okay," he breathes. "Anything you need."
"Yeah, here's nice."
In answer, Harry lifts a hand containing three thick rolls of parchment full of notes.
Harry blinks tears out of his eyes. The words take a second to make their way to his buzzed brain. Is the torture done, really? Or is it a trap?
"For everyone except me, apparently. Sirius never talks about his family. I know he's hiding something, and you know what it is."
: Don't you dare. I can make you apatride you know.
"I thought it was... off-putting." The Prince’s eyes turn away toward his bubbling cauldron.
Draco does help him get a fast appointment to erect wards around his place. Harry is initially very pleased to see the ward mistress come in, and thanks her profusely. But then things get complicated because she came in between other appointments expecting a quick job on a normal home. When she briefly mentions the spells she intends to lay, Harry's newfound ward knowledge is enough to guess that those would greatly disturb his animals. At best, they would never find his house again. At worst, it would sap them of their magic as soon as they got close, which would immediately kill a good portion of them.
"Will you do it?"
"Kitten?!"
"Did you miss the part about me not knowing the first thing about wards?"
"Not the studying type then?"
Harry is still panting, stars dancing before his eyes, when Draco dismisses the spell and stands up.
"I want more, please."
"Just be careful with this," Remus advises. "I'm not saying that he has an ulterior motive..."
"That's what you get for not sending me an instant owl."
"A few hours... And a few days before I was deemed sufficiently stable to regain my own magic."
“You did?!”
Harry spreads himself on the couch, coats his fingers in lube, and gets to work. Meanwhile Draco does return to his work, as announced, without giving him another look. The fact that Draco
Harry considers what to answer for a moment. He can understand Draco's concern. He was indeed the first to talk about things being different, just a minute ago. And he did spend a lot of time yesterday thinking about what this means for their relationship, now that he actually knows who Kitten is.
"HARRY.” Harry jumps. Draco so rarely yells. “I’ve spent the last five minutes explaining to you that YES. We are, indeed, together. Unless this is an elaborate way to stage a break-up."
"Is it related to the currently stressful thing at work?"
"Because of the coming ceremony?" Remus asks, bringing over steaming mugs.
"In that case... I'll have reading material brought over at once. Familiarize yourself with the topic at much as possible, then come find me tomorrow morning, when your other duties allow. Just apparate to the Palace, the guards will guide you."
"Because... Because I wanAAAAH!! to be good for yAAAAHHH!!"
Draco shrugs.
"Well, turns out... Kitten is actually the Prince of Great Britain."
"Draught of Disenchantment. I'll have to drink this during the ceremony."
"WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE?!"
"Only took us two years and you needing me for that stupid ceremony for us to figure it out."
They walk through the decorated halls of the Palace, politely greeting the occasional passerby. Harry earns some curious looks, which he ignores completely, his mind elsewhere.
"It's less that she has something
"... Yeah. You're right. I'm sorry... Draco. Can I call you Draco?"
“I’m going to politely decline,” Draco answers, looking a little green.
. Unless to mention yet again that his mother was horrible and that Harry should be glad he never got to meet the lot of them. Harry isn't even sure if the whole family died long ago or if they just don't talk. He doesn’t even know what Sirius’s last name was before he married Remus. He tried to ask, but Sirius always deflected. Until now.
Harry stays silent, thinking. Because the other thing is Sirius being so convinced that Draco is doing some sort of scheme to take advantage of him. And it's ridiculous, but... what if? Draco would never do that, not the Draco he knows.
"I bet their goal is to charm you to gain your vote. Or the public support of Lord Potter. Something like that."
Yes. Harry can definitely do magic play. That's one area they have explored extensively together and Harry never tires of it. The way Kitten's magic feels, trapped in his. The delicate silvery lattice of it, crushed under his power. Kitten, naked and vulnerable, trembling as Harry pokes and pulls at the very source of his magic... Yes. Yes, they can do that. But at the same time... Why does he detect tension in Kitten's voice?
"Yeah, totally. Now spill."
"What's going on?" Ron asks.
“But we are far from being a one night stand,” Draco points out with a frown.
"That's what I'm saying! It's a choice! Draco is not choosing Harry!"
All of the anger sweeps out of Harry, and he slumps into his chair.
that?" Harry sneers.
"Do you think I would put my life in your hands if we weren't close?"
There's tears hiding in the corners of Sirius’s eyes.
"Remember Kitten?"
"What changed?"
"I would be happier if we could never talk about this again," Sirius grumbles. "But since your prince babbled already, I'd rather you heard our version."
"You hear that Kitty? Because they want to see you come, I'll allow it. Thank them."
. Then, at Ron's face, she corrects with a roll of her eyes: "I’ll be quite happy to help you with this."
"More like I'll be waiting forever for you to answer your instant owl messages," Kitten counters with a pointy finger shoved in Harry's belly.
"Wanker."
"So pretty, so white... But I think I prefer them in red. Don't you agree?"
Draco lifts a single eyebrow.
It has changed very little, despite the years. The garden is still unkept and haphazard, and the house looks so small against the overgrown bushes. The broomshed is open, of course, Sirius never bothers to lock it. The front door is sure to be unlocked, too. But Harry feels compelled to knock. To give his guardians a chance to pretend they're not at home, if they want to.
This time the guard at the antechamber greets him by name. She leads him to a small room overlooking the gardens, where tea and scones await in front of an elegant lady dressed all in black.
"Sorry."
"I had to publish a job offer in the
"Hi Kitty."
He knows...?
"'s been a while since you've dommed me," Harry says with a saucy grin.
"Aaand ten minutes, good job!"
"Well they did a shit job," Harry spits.
Sirius falls down against the bookcase, hugging his knees. Remus sits down next to him and embraces him tightly.
Kitten’s yell almost masks the snap of the crop against his thighs.
The Queen gapes like a fish out of water.
Harry shakes himself from the oddness of seeing him with another face.
He gets a few more pinches. He can't even see Draco's hands move to cast the spell, so he has no way of seeing it coming. The plug's vibrations also increase slowly, no surprise here.
Harry pauses in his train of thought, midway through putting on pants, and has a sort of quiet realisation. He really likes Draco, doesn't he?
He knows.
"I know." Draco chuckles. "I'm quite aware. I quite like you too."
She removes the bed, the wardrobes full of clothes, the band posters on the walls. Until there's nothing in the pristine room but Sirius and Remus, huddled behind a shield spell.
Harry takes a strand of blond hair in his hand, deposits a kiss to it, and disapparates.
Damn, did he break some kind of protocol by saying that?
Kitten slides down from the ottoman like liquid and puts his head in Harry's lap, his teacup forgotten. Seems like he
: ᛉᛗᛚ
Harry pauses as he apparates back to his shack, alone in the dark. A place... where? Draco would hate living with him in what he calls a mud hut. And he's not going to live with Sirius and Remus, that's ridiculous.
His wand unties it a second time, and his hand delicately opens the robe to reveal the second layer. More white fabric, closed by a long line of tiny buttons. And underneath, the final layer: a thin, see-through muslin that drapes simply around the shoulders.
Draco's grip against his hair tightens. He pushes away, exposing Harry's throat. "Who said anything about
"Dark wizards... Yeah right. Could be doing a better job," Harry mutters.
But despite what he keeps repeating... does he really know Draco that well?
"Is there anything else I can do for you, Lord Harry Potter Sir?"
"I'll be around when we're done here," Luna answers with a caress on her partner's back.
"Definitely. And... magic play?"
"The wards warned me of an unauthorised person apparating in. Did you think you could sneak past me? Did you think
The Prince opens his eyes and gives Harry an annoyed look.
Draco chuckles.
Hands and crop alternate, leaving zigzagging lines and finger imprints. At each strike, Kitten tries to bite back a moan and fails. The skin turns a pretty shade of pink and Kitten is trembling, doing his best to keep his ass in the air.
"You're tyrannic. Alright. Give me a minute to find the right words."
: Don't take this the wrong way, but I'd really rather be alone and quiet right now. Still love you Kitty.
The second the door closes behind her, Harry slouches down, finally relaxing a bit.
“Yes,” Harry agrees easily, shame warm in his belly. “I’ll always be your slut. So can I have more?”
"Your brother is far from perfect, but he'll be adequate, at least. More than can be said about you."
"Second cousins isn't weird, right? ... Sorry, what's second cousins exactly?"
"I'll keep that in mind." And because he feels like he's being too cold toward Draco, he adds: "I really like you, you know."
"Now that this is settled, I'd like to know a little more about you, Lord Potter," the Queen asks, while taking a cup of tea in her delicate hands. "I haven't had the pleasure of meeting you at the Wizengamot I believe."
"Wonderful!" The moustached wizard exclaims. "Are the wards in such bad shape that it is necessary to renew them so often?"
"Did Sirius have an older sibling?" Hermione asks, already seeing the conclusion of the story.
In other circumstances, they could simply talk about it, like adults. Harry would have mentioned his feelings, in a very casual, 'just letting you know' manner. He would not have asked for reciprocation, naturally. Being honest would be the right thing to do, so Draco could decide if he was comfortable continuing their activities. Maybe things would be a bit awkward between them for a while, a bit strained. But it is the only long-term valid path.
"So you are dating now?" Remus asks with a smile.
Everyone nods their heads. Some whisper praise.
"Blimey, that's crazy! His mom kicked him out, just like that?" Ron exclaims.
"Are you even trying? Counter reset."
"What's the point of being together if you meet once in a blue moon?" Sirius grumbles.
: The unicorns don't like the journalists.
Draco laughs, a full, happy sound, different from his usual moderate chuckles. The sound warms Harry all over.
As his answer, Harry puts Kitten’s hand away and replaces it with his own hand.
Should he try to become the next King Consort? He has zero interest in politics. He loves his current job. He can't see himself smiling and waving in front of crowds who expect from him perfect propriety.
Neville nods quickly, robotically, and sits in the nearest chair. Harry sighs and drops in a fluffy armchair, while Hermione and Ron share the sofa. Everyone immediately forgets about tea.
Would Draco be happy, having him as a husband?
A few days later, Harry and Draco are scheduled for several hours of joint meditation, so Harry can work on sensing Draco's magic and state of mind. Something he already quite knows how to do, but extra practice can't hurt.
"I thought you would be patient?" Draco teases.
Would he be happy, being Draco's husband?
"They have similar feelings toward wizards," Harry lets slip.
Some creatures perceive the ward masters as intruders and try to attack them. Others think the new wards will trap them and try to flee. They need to calm down every creature before they can even start the several hours long process of erecting the wards. When the team finally thinks they're done, a shadow creature appears out of nowhere, one that Harry has never seen and can't for the life of him identify, and kindly informs them that the wards cut through a sacred ley line and if they don't undo whatever they did immediately, they would be forced to take this particular piece of land into another dimension.
"Still the same.”
"Ready for me to fuck your brain?"
"Youngest seeker in a century," the Prince adds with fondness. "He also holds Hogwarts' record for fastest catch: only 8 minutes 40 seconds into the game."
"To have made... what?"
"Alright. All three of us."
The Prince spares him a quick look before returning his attention to his preparation.
"Do we... " His eyes go wide. "Godric's pants, you're Narcissa's sprog?!"
"Read them all already?" the Prince asks with a raised eyebrow.
"Kinda," Harry repeats.
Feeling very stupid, Harry just nods.
"Wow, are all of those new? You worked hard, thanks," he says when he gets closer and can get a look at the little cards.
Little Draco? Just who is this woman to talk about him with such familiarity?
"Good floaty?" Draco caresses his cheek. His eyes are so beautiful. So grey.
"Oh, yes. A Ceylon black tea would be perfect right now."
"Quite." Kitten sighs. "Be as it may, we'll have to make sure that next time is about you."
"You really like that, don't you?"
"No, no time. Too busy with the ceremony approaching."
"Catch you later mate."
"Wait, Draco..." Harry starts.
"I was afraid of this," the Prince says after a moment. Harry can feel the tension he's trying to hide.
"Just be a bit patient..."
"Not until you talk about your feelings," Harry answers seriously, not taking the bait.
"I know,” Draco says, then turns around and kisses him.
"I'm not going to treat you differently, if that's what you're worried about. I just need a bit of time to become used to the new you. New magic, new face, and you being the Prince. From my point of view, this is a lot to get used to in a short time."
"Yes."
"Any reason why you bring it up? You want to do something?"
"Draco says there's not much to do."
"All my childhood's here. Only reason why I can sleep at night. Moony read way too many books when James and Lily... When you came here."
“It’s me,” the Prince answers, reassuring Harry. Or maybe reassuring himself.
: Honestly! He’s a public figure, and so are you now! If you don't protect your home, you'll have journalists knocking at your door at all hours of the day, along with nonprofits asking for endorsement or money, lobbyists wanting to swing your vote, and many more.
Unfortunately, that tenderness looks too much like pity.
Harry lets his magic pulse through. Here it is: Kitten's magic, answering his own with familiarity. It's powerful but tamed, organized, elegant in its movement. He lets his own magic in. They're so different. Harry’s magic is bold, impulsive, determined. It pushes against the delicate magic and Kitten whimpers in his lap.
"I would have preferred you used that particular nickname earlier. Did you have to call me Kitten in front of my mother?" he laments, dramatically flopping over the couch and closing his eyes in a tired expression.
“Sounds like it’s you who doesn't want it…” Draco looks guarded.
"Mmmmh that was good," Kitten finally says in the middle of a long stretch.
"I'm showing you my runes, you four-eyes wanker."
Draco's apartments are... simple. Not what Harry imagined the apartments of a Prince would look like.
: Sorry I was working outside, just came home.
: How do you prevent people from apparating to your house?
"There. Sorry to have made you wait. Do you want to get inside for a cuppa?" Harry asks.
"Pleased to meet you?" the Queen interrogates, her penciled eyebrow slightly raised.
"After all the trouble I went through to convince you that we’re an item?" Draco says with a lopsided smile. “I’m not letting you go that easily.”
"Convinced I still want to shag you?" Harry asks toward Draco's back, breathless.
“I can’t say I have.’
“I’ll pass on the fire crabs hugs.”
: Sorry. But still. You get my point.
: I'll talk to Draco. Thanks Hermione.
Harry's curious, but...
Should he stay a side-lover, in the shadows, making compromises with whoever will be Draco's spouse? Open relationships are one thing, but he can't see himself being the secret second man for life.
"I'll be here for you," Harry whispers.
Controlling Kitten's body through his magic is intoxicating. Slowly he presses, directly on Kitten's nerves, on his sensations. A dark moan rewards him. Harry searches for more, for the exact nerve ending to grab and squeeze, for the exact way in which to stimulate Kitten directly in his head.
A mischievous smile appears on Draco's lips.
The Prince's eyes widen.
"Look, uh," Draco starts, adjusting his hair in a bashful manner. "I know our families have not parted on the best terms." What? "But I assure you my presence here has nothing to do with this, or you. I was merely visiting Harry. I understand that you do not want to see me though, so I will see myself out."
"No, we're finishing," she says, gently petting the hair of her partner. Said partner turns glassy eyes toward them and gives a little wave, but she seems still pretty under it.
"... I see..." the Prince says with a forced neutral tone, and moves to put his robes back on, but is stopped by Harry's gentle hand on his shoulder.
They argue, nothing gets done, the ward mistress has to go to her next appointment, and it takes several more days before a whole team of ward masters puts together a suitable plan. They need to erect wards around the whole perimeter of Harry's lands to prevent intruders from apparating in, but they need to let the magic of the land through to not disturb the animals.
"Like we said yesterday, I don’t need to know much about your real life to
"Over-confident, are we?" Draco smirks.
"I don't see anywhere we could land," Draco remarks. He's right, the trees are thick here.
"It will."
"Afraid of what?"
"It had to be done. I'm not even sad, that was the best day of my life," Sirius says with a shrug. "The day I was freed."
Harry sees understanding flash in Draco's eyes, quickly replaced by hesitation.
It's probably a clerical error or something, Harry muses as his coffee finally arrives in his hand. He takes a sip and pursues his reading.
"Wait."
Remus sits next to him, the heaviness of the years visible in his slow movements. There's a new cut on the back of his hand.
: I'm using it right now.
"In cat mode?"
"I'm sorry I made you relive all this," Harry says in a small voice.
"How so?"
"Thestrals?"
Harry searches Draco's eyes. The Prince puts a hand through his unruly black hair and Harry can see in his eyes that the sentiment is shared.
Harry blinks and notices the tight grip he has on Kitten's thighs. He relaxes and breathes. Kitten came hard and Harry still feels the aftershock through their link. He purposely dials down the connection to get a clearer head, only keeping the minimum needed to monitor Kitten's state.
"... I'll do that..." Harry answers with a slump of his shoulders.
Kitten purrs harder.
: You can't see my face, so I'm letting you know that I'm judging you. And here I thought you were getting intelligent, trading insults in runes, but no. You're still as dumb as a rock.
"You're supposed to calm me, but I can feel your agitation," Draco says.
The Four O'Clock is the club where he and Kitten have met, and that they continue to frequent. Harry apparates in the antechamber, waves at the doorman who unlocks the door for him, and steps into what is, for all intent and purpose, a tea shop. A very private, very posh teashop, which just so happens to occasionally have patrons dressed in leather, and be located above a sex dungeon.
"Yeah, that's what worries me." Harry sighs.
"So you thought I knew?"
"Renewing the wards is my job, not yours."
Draco’s voice brings him back to the present, to the thestral’s drool on his hand, the dirt on his boots and the leaves in his hair. He doesn’t look like a prince’s husband. For the first time, he considers the differences between Draco’s life and his, and it gives him whiplash.
Harry takes a breath.
Harry throws his hands in the air in frustration.
Draco looks horrified.
Kitten’s magic stretches beautifully for him. It flexes where he pushes, swells where he allows. It runs through Kitten's veins, deeper than any body part shoved in a hole could ever get. All of him is open to Harry. His sensations, his emotions, his raw power, laid bare for Harry to dispose of as he pleases.
"Sorry that nature doesn't accommodate your exact needs." Harry rolls his eyes.
"Please what?" Harry asks, his hand squeezing the meat of the ass.
"Ah, sorry, I spaced out. Do you..."
"You want it?" Draco asks as if the answer isn’t obvious.
"I dunno,” Harry answers as he accepts the tea from Remus. “He often has a lot of work. Before, when we just met...." to fuck "... there and there, he often complained about being stressed from work. He said that he saw me to relax, and wished he had time to see me more often."
"Harry?"
"Yes to fucking," Harry agrees easily. "But I don't really feel in the mood for domming. You okay with just fucking?"
It must be the events of the week that make him think that way about family. Which in turn makes him think about children. Or maybe he's thinking about the future to escape the reality of the past.
So how is this different from what he felt for other people before? Harry had many different partners over the years. They sort of came and went. If he had to name his relationships with his different partners, most of them were more like friends. Yet, Harry has the sense he feels something more than platonic friendship for Draco.
Harry can remember Draco saying about the runes. What happened fourteen years ago?
Harry frowns. He recognizes some of them from seeing them in books the previous day. There's the name of England. Sea. One of the many runes that signify magic, though he can't recall the precise meaning of that particular one.
"I mean that this is all very practical. I was expecting more... ceremony stuff." Harry shrugs.
He thought they were at the strange in-between stage where they're becoming a bit more than sex partners but don't quite know what they want to become. And Draco is at the children stage already?
"What?
"They’re not stupid. They know me and they know I take care of them. But also... magical animals tend to like me from the start. Dunno why exactly,” Harry shrugs. “It’s always been that way. Even unicorns approach me if they're in trouble."
Right now, they have the sort of unlabeled relationship that often emerges from repeated sexual encounters. They've never talked about having a relationship between them. They're not boyfriends or anything of the sort. Sex friends might be a better term.
"So pretty," Harry compliments with a gentle caress. "Turn around."
Harry sits in the opposite chair, utterly confused.
"And it's going to be even more during the ceremony, right?" Harry asks.
"How are you feeling?" Draco asks when he notices him staring.
"Does it?" Kitten answers with a smirk.
Because during that time a few people have gathered in the leather chairs around the bed. Some of them they recognize, including Luna who smiles and waves. Others are silent strangers who stay quiet, having not been invited in the scene.
"I'm really playing the long-con in this scenario."
: Do you need something or are you just wanking over insulting me?
"Yet, unknown to the court," she continues. "Living like an hermit in the woods. One wonders what brought you in Draco's path."
"It is."
Summary of the pensieve flashback for those who preferred skipping it : Sirius brings Remus to the palace after a full moon to heal him. Walburga wal-barges in and attempts to kill Remus. Sirius reveals he and Remus are in a relationship. Walburga decides to leave them both go, but Sirius is dead to her from now on, and she'll pretend he never even existed.
"Didn't want to get mud on my boots."
"Mmmmmh," Kitten agrees. "Yeah... If it's you, it'll be okay..."
: It's not an issue, no worries. Love you too. Have a nice quiet evening Harry.
"Yeah, right. I was just wondering if... you know, if you're doing okay here? Are your masters treating you nicely?"
Harry hesitates... then nods.
"Give me your wand," Harry orders. He forces softness out of his voice, getting into character.
"Liar. I know when people lie to me. Do you take me for a muggle? What..."
"So it is." Harry grins.
"My body acts as a bridge to channel the magic of the land and the people, and redirect it toward the wards. The principle of the ceremony is to cleanse my body and my magic of any residue, artefacts or faults left behind by the continuous flow of the spell's magic."
"Yeah, sure, cause being an adult with responsibilities works like that."
Draco does not betray any reaction to that comment. He's good at the poker-face.
Okay, not a parallel universe.
Draco reaches into his pocket and procures a small metal plug. Harry laughs.
"Please, take a seat. I've taken the liberty of ordering blackpowder tea. I hope it is to your liking."
"If anything we're more than that. But yes, Harry. We are, indeed, boyfriends. In a relationship. A romantic relationship. With explicit love feelings between us. A very gay, very real relationship. Is that clear enough for your dense little head?"
After a short deliberation, and having an expert from the Department of Mystery scream at them to do whatever the shadow creature asks of them, they undo all of their hard work. They replace it with the lightest possible apparition alarm, just around Harry's house. Not enough to stop anyone, but enough to make it clear to those attempting to apparate that they're unwelcome, and to register their magical signature to charge them with trespassing charges. Draco pulls some strings to register Harry's domain as a protected site, which bumps up the trespassing charges to an amount high enough to make the average journalist stop and consider if interrogating Harry is really worth it.
And suddenly, it hits him.
: I'm missing you too :)
"Quite."
"Yeah? Bet you call me 'the Prince' now in your head."
The hours are long before either of them gets out of the potion lab.
"Good," Draco says neutrally. "My robes just arrived. Are you available now to learn how to dress me properly?"
"That's for you to decide."
"You can't trust the royals, pup. Just... believe me. If he's here, that means he needs something from you. He's
The Prince does the final step and brings his lips against his. Finally, something familiar in this strange world he's suddenly thrown in.
"Hello Harry, come in!"
"Draco... Are you trying to ask me to have children with you?"
"Hello pup!"
"It was Mother and Lady Zabini. Since it was my first ceremony, the priests allowed for me to have two assistants. It didn't help."
"Something for work," Harry evades.
"Guilty as charged."
: What about vanilla sex? Or just cuddles? I want to see you.
"Take a look at the other one."
As always, Hermione is quick to answer any question thrown at her.
At the end of the day Harry apparates right into his bed. There's so many thoughts swirling in his head that he's not sure he'll be able to sleep. Turns out, he's so emotionally exhausted that he passes out right away. Unfortunately his thoughts have waited patiently, and as soon as he wakes up, they come back to the attack.
There is a beat of silence, when the Queen and the man—from their similar hair Harry realises it must be the Prince—study him. Harry shuffles in place, not knowing what to do. Thankfully, after a moment, the Queen puts down her teacup and speaks.
"What about you? Did you know?" Harry asks Ron. His best friend. If his best friend has been lying to him for the ten years they've known each other...
: Yes. I want something sweet. Lots of praise.
"You don't have to—"
"I want them to see your pretty face torn by pleasure. Keep your head here."
"He lives with them," Sirius insists. "If he wasn't evil he would have fucked off long ago, like I did. You know the Queen's shitting on equal rights every chance she can. And she raised him."
"Better now that we're away from the mud," Draco yells back.
Soon a small clearing opens between the trees. When they land, the foals come galloping, all excited, but stop dead in their tracks when they spot the unknown passenger behind Harry. Draco starts an apology, but Harry stops him.
"I am?" Harry can't help responding.
: My incredulity is only surpassed by my skepticism.
"He was supposed to become King. But..." He bites his lip. He doesn't even know where to start.
A few days later Harry finds another owl waiting for him, with a letter sporting the royal seal.  It's an audience again, with someone whose name doesn't ring any bell. Lady Zabini? This must be related to the ceremony one way or another. One of those priests Draco mentioned perhaps. Harry gives the owl a big treat to reward her speed. He’s covered in mud and scratches, as usual, but this time he has enough time to make himself presentable before apparating to the Palace.
He finds himself far too distracted to do any work.
"I'm really really sorry."
"Tis a pleasure to serve, Sir."
"You didn't see each other that much before?"
"But it is a strong possibility nevertheless. As long as you don't trust him blindly... Well, I'll trust that you know him as well as you do."
Kitten is whimpering in Harry's lap, his whole body trembling, filled with Harry's presence.
Draco finishes his thirty-eight stirs in silence, then turns over his cauldron so that the rose engraved on its side faces the point where the moon rises over the horizon.
"See you then."
They spend the whole afternoon perusing the books and making notes of anything related to the wards renewal ceremony. When Harry's stomach reminds him loudly that he missed lunch, Ron uses the excuse of fixing them dinner to escape.
"You're the worst."
"Oh, there is much
"Yes, but..."
Kitten was a seeker?
"HOW DARE YOU BRING THIS THING INSIDE THE PALACE!"
"Be quiet,” Draco snaps. “I need to focus."
Narcissa? Oh, right, the Queen.
Draco nods.
"Look, Draco does need something from me." Besides the awesome sex. "He needs me for this ceremony thing at the palace. It's nothing nefar..."
After his meeting, once he's alone, instead of getting out, Harry finds himself a nice nook in a side corridor.
The Prince hangs his shoulders in desperation and looks at the ceiling.
Sirius slams the cork back into place and grabs another one. The yell of a child is the only thing that has the time to escape before Sirius forcefully closes it and pushes it to the back of the shelves.
"This is a lot to take in," Hermione says. "You should take some time to..."
Gods.
"Oh, yes," Luna agrees. "Are you about to?"
: This is surprisingly good thinking
At least for now.
"You look like you need a nap more than a cuppa," Remus observes.
Gods, he's hard. It's so frustrating, to feel the orgasm through Kitten even though he didn't come himself. Harry adjusts them so Kitten lays comfortably on his side, instead of having his ass against Harry’s dick.
Sirius doesn't answer. It's like he's frozen in place, suspended in time. Harry waits for the answer to his question... or... any reaction... other than gaping uselessly...
Murmurs of approbation among the crowd.
"Oh, he has!" She answers like she's talking tenderly about her grandchild. "But not enough. Not nearly enough. Draco is still a child, and I believe Narcissa should be in charge of the wards for one more cycle at the very least."
"So... Are you forbidden from talking to me ever again?"
"How long have you waited here little guy? Sorry for that," Harry apologizes as he detaches the letter from the owl's leg.
that if Harry had any doubt before that this was really Kitten in front of him, those doubts are immediately dissipated.
Eventually, with a little help from Remus and a lot of Sirius ranting in the background, Harry's lucerne is unpacked, piled and tidy. Ready for the nifflers to rampage through it.
"What do you mean? You've been seeing someone else?" Harry teases.
(See the end of the chapter for
: Sorry, I'm very busy getting everything set up here before I leave for the ceremony. I'm not really in the mood to play.
"It is," the Prince agrees with a serious finality.
Kitten is the Prince of Great Britain.
"This is a very good house, Lord Potter Sir, a very good house indeed. Very noble. A lot of good work. Mendy is very proud to be part of the estate, Sir."
Harry blinks. He's losing his focus. Thinking about power instead of paying attention to Kitten. He must be getting a bit drunk from magic, he deduces. He draws his magic back and takes a long breath.
"Please," Kitten whimpers.
"... Has it happened before?"
"Yeah, but it's me who's busy now. Sorry." Harry points toward the learning material spread on the table.
Kitten whines in lieu of answer.
But Kitten asked for other things tonight, and Harry is going to give him everything he can.
"Ceremony?" Sirius looks up, alarmed. "They want to involve you in a dark ritual?"
The atmosphere of the place changes drastically.
"Uh, I dunno..." Harry pauses in checking the baby thestral’s wing. "I haven't been with many children. Human children, I mean. Why do you ask?"
"Uh, sure. Same."
"Not denying it," Harry concedes. "But I'm not going to start calling you ‘Your Highness’. Unless you want me to?" he adds in a teasing tone.
: You do live in a mud hut.
"I said I would."
"Okay. Okay just... give me a moment."
When Draco comes back to his workstation, jars of ingredients in hand, he spares a brief look toward Harry.
"Do not worry, Lord Potter," the Queen says. "We have three weeks to prepare. We have arranged chambers for you in the Palace so you'll be able to devote your full time to it. Of course we don't expect you to throw yourself at the three days of ceremony without any training."
Kitten's throat works past a lump.
Finally, Sirius sits up on the couch with a rare gravity.
The other one looks, indeed, a lot more complicated. It's richly decorated and made of many different pieces: robes of course, but also belts, necklaces… things… Harry picks up the first piece of cloth he sees to study it.
"You're wise, pup." Sirius ruffles his hair. "If he ever wants to flee the palace, he has a place here."
"What I'm hearing is that he spent time with you under disguise to make you care about him, before revealing what he needed you for all along,” Sirius points out. “That's typical."
Kitty yells, seemingly untouched, every nerve on fire. Several people in the audience gasp in surprise at the abruptness of the reaction. Harry savours Kitten's pleasure for two more seconds, then lets go, bringing it down to a warm simmer.
"Sirius."
"You're right. Of course you are."
Harry automatically turns toward the window. The moon is full.
"The crop makes a nice sound," Harry remarks calmly, turning the crop between his fingers, a smirk on his lips. "Almost as nice as your voice. Tell me why you're here."
"Nothing good ever starts with that," Harry mutters.
"Not since Arthur's time, no."
"It's okay, Neville. Do you have any idea who knows, among our friends?"
equals
"Magical animals are... well... magical. And so... But, they don't talk, do they? So reading their magical aura, it's very useful. So I can know if they're okay or not. And it's the same for Draco. I mean, the Prince. I have to do the same things I do with my animals. I mean, regarding reading their magic. Nothing else. Obviously."
"Then aren't those charms a bit... out of proportion? It's a big area to cover and you're using pretty strong charms. I imagine obliviating the rare muggle wanderer would be more practical."
“I train them out of the habit,” Harry says to reassure him. “It’s bad manners. Shit happens, but it really isn’t that often.”
The ceremony is in one week, and Harry has rarely felt so exhausted.
"Yeah, Remus tells that to Sirius every other day. Seems one of them rubbed on me more than the other."
Since he knows Draco used to play Quidditch, Harry isn't afraid to kick the ground and fly high. Besides, he must prove that his Firebolt is the superior broom. The loch zooms out, a splatter of grey in the middle of the dark green forest, surrounded by brown mountains.
Harry delicately wraps his fingers around Kitten's white hair and pulls him up as he gets to his feet. With zero wiggling room Kitten is forced to follow, getting up a bit awkwardly. Harry keeps him down, forcing Kitten to look up to him.
Sexual activities aside, what would being the Prince's official boyfriend entail? Would he have to make official appearances? Go to official tea parties and shake the hand of politicians? Urgh. Harry's suddenly glad they aren't really boyfriends.
Harry gently parts Kitten's hair, uncovering the elegant column of his throat. He caresses the skin, then brings the heavy leather collar around it. He clasps it shut and feels his partner's skin shivering under his fingers.
Harry scratches at the base of Kitten's skull, who groans.
Remus, at least, seems to sense that they are going nowhere. He shares one of those looks again with Sirius.
"You don't know half of it."
"Looking forward to it. But, anyway, I'm glad I could help you destress tonight."
"I've made some changes since the last time you tried it," Draco explains conversationally, like he's discussing a cooking recipe. "It's going to move a bit slower, but the grip should be just a tad stronger. Tell me if you can feel a difference."
: Did something happen?
"YOUR POSTURE IS ALL WRONG YOU DISGRACE OF A—"
"Precisely. It was my first time feeling such magic in me and... It was overwhelming." Draco's voice goes very small. "I panicked, which made the magic of the wards even more unstable, creating a negative feedback loop. It took a while for me to calm down."
"I'll curse them all!! I swear I will!!!" Sirius roars.
"I'm busy," Draco dismisses without a single glance at him. Harry's heart beats faster.
"Ah, yeah, just this morning actually. I was traveling. I'm sorry for looking a bit messy, since I saw the owl so late I didn't have much time to prepare."
"Harry, did we tell you that Mrs Finnigan across the street just had a surprise litter of kneazles? She's not sure what she's going to do with them."
"I guess I can see his point of view. But it's so silly. There's plenty of other candidates for the ritual, no need for convincing."
"I knew those shibari classes would one day pay off," Harry jokes, his fingers tracing the shape of the knot.
"Fine."
He actually knows a lot about the most private things about Kitten, due to their activities. But ironically he knows nothing about the more mundane things, like his name. It doesn't bother him, but he does get curious from time to time.
Draco keeps adding to it. Vibration. Pinches. Caresses. Hair pulling. Harry writhes on his couch, seemingly untouched but secretly tormented by simple touches of magic.
Harry obliges happily with a chuckle. As his fingers begin scratching the Prince's scalp, his face relaxes slightly. Still, Harry can see clear as day that something is weighing on the Prince's mind.
"Hum, sure." Harry sits in front of her.
It's something important for Draco. Thinking more about it, Harry decides that they probably wouldn't live in the shack, renovations or not. It’s not safe for children, with all the wild creatures around. Draco hates the forest too. So they would probably all live in the castle. Would Harry have to apparate to the forest everyday? It wouldn't be too much trouble. But he likes it here in the forest... Maybe they could build a bigger house together. With protections around the backyards, for the kids. A little cottage in the woods, with real, big rooms.
Present-Remus's arm side-hugs him, while past-Remus groans in pain.
"Aren't you...?"
. What's the word? First gentleman? Prince Consort?
"About what?"
: Yes.
"Really? Isn't that dangerous?"
"So beautiful," Harry whispers.
"Good boy. Strip. Show me what you got for me."
"Exactly. This is powerful magic, Harry. Far more powerful than mine. It can only pass safely through me if I'm in a blank state, so to speak."
"Please do."
: It's a phonetic letter you simpleton.
"I would hope so," Draco says in a tone that means that Harry would have been an absolute cretin if he didn't. "The first step is to disable the influence of the wards on me. Then we’ll use this potion," Draco says as he makes the counter-clockwise stir number twenty-one over thirty-eight, "to completely disable my own magic."
Sirius's family.
"What about your assistant? What were they doing for it to go that bad?"
What? She knows Sirius? How? He's definitely not the type to hang around the Palace. And what's that got to do with anything? Harry does his best to hide his confusion and nod politely.
"Well I don't exactly have your version to compare," Harry snaps back.
They must have heard them talk as well, for they emerge from the kitchen at that moment.
Harry lets his head rest against the wall with a small "tunk", sighing.
After a while, Harry grabs Kitten's wand to remove the charm on the ear and tails. But Kitten grabs his wrist and gets back his own wand. He conjures flannel robes on himself, but leaves the cat attributes.
The Queen sips her tea, not disturbed in the least.
"We've been together for five years, old hag. It's no joke."
Mendy nods so widely her ears flap loudly against her skull.
"Sole heir to an illustrious name, and Sirius's adopted child."
"Lord Potter!" a witch calls. "How does raising magical animals relate at all to wards?"
idiot," Draco teases.
Harry may have daydreamed about a long term relationship with Draco, here and there. His bed is cold and he'd like to have someone to cuddle with everyday. Discovering Draco's a prince didn't change that. But it somehow didn't connect until now that
later the cat ears are no more and Kitten puts a hand through his hair to put it back into place. They go together to the antechamber and share another kiss.
"To the contrary, Lord Potter Sir, ‘tis very good for the nerves," Mendy says with a wide smile.
"I want to be a good boy and get praise, mostly."
Harry looks suspiciously at the teapot. Is he paranoid, or is there a possibility it's poisoned?
Harry places Kitten's empty holding bag on his head. The little pouch sits on top of Kitten's head, framed by his cat ears.
"Is... there any reason you're here, your Highness?" Remus finally asks, his words cutting heavily through the uneasiness.
"Tis a strange question, Lord Harry Potter sir. We house elves don't talk much with our masters. Tisn't proper. So they can't be or not be nice."
: Ok. That's all?
"Are you sure this is a good place? No one will come?" Harry asks in the middle of unbuttoning his shirt.
Lady Zabini's smile turns particularly sharp.
Harry leaves these two parts be. Instead, he focuses on the flow of the magic, the seven plexus, where each strand flows through the wizard's body. Harry gently reaches for a familiar chord, very close to an embryonic animagus form that Kitten never quite managed to turn into. Harry dips into the very same magic and takes a small amount of it into his own magic. He pushes on it, shapes it, directs it. Kitten's magic responds with easy familiarity and soon a pair of cat ears appear in his blond hair, and a cat tail at the base of his spine.
"If we're to stay a thing among the gossiping weasels of the court.”
Where the ground floor is quiet and cosy, the lower floor screams "sex dungeon" at every corner. The entrance room is a long corridor with vaulted ceilings that reverberate every sound. A couple they don't personally know but have seen quite often is doing suspension ropes. The rigger explains what she is doing to a small audience. Harry holds to the side the heavy burgundy curtain separating the area to the next room and gives an "after you" gesture to Kitten.
"Why don't we all sit down with a cup of tea," Hermione suggests. "And discuss this matter calmly, like adults."
"Oh, uh..." Harry's brain gets stuck between the what-is and the wants. "... You think we're together?"
"Nothing catastrophic happened,” Draco finally opens with. "It was my first time handling the wards, my first ceremony of the sort. They stripped me of my magic, then carved the runes on my back and proceeded to the rest of the ceremony as you know it."
"Sirius thinks you charmed me just to force me to participate in a dark ritual," Harry chooses to reveal.
There's a pause. A very short moment, where the Queen's face freezes.
: for you.
"It's nice to see you, Harry," Kitten greets back, and Harry immediately sees the tired lines in his smile. He sits down and starts petting his blond hair. Kitten melts into the touch.
Draco makes a disgusted face.
"Right answer. Such a good boy. But my potion isn't done yet. You'll have to be
"And she didn't manage to scare you off?" Draco examines his fingernails, his tone falsely nonchalant.
The flashes and loud questions continue.
Just daydreaming like that, it's easy to think he does want children. Someday. Somewhere. But can he promise Draco he definitely will want to have them? Soon-ish?
Draco hums.
Kitten huffs.
Harry silently notes the particular turn of phrase.
Harry refocuses on the Queen.
This is indeed a weird choice of time and place for this kind of revelation. Couldn't they have done that in private?
"Shit!" Sirius runs toward the bed, toward Remus, but a red light shoots from the woman's wand and throws Sirius against the wall.
"Shut up wanker," Harry says without animosity.
"I see," the Queen answers in a tone that betrays nothing. "With how rarely you grace these halls with your presence, I have to wonder how the two of you met," she asks conversationally.
"I'll never say no to that. Maybe we should free the bed though." He nods his head toward the couple making out nearby. "Since you're dressed we could go cuddle on a couch in the teashop?"
She's Sirius's mother.
: And apatride means stateless. Or, to get down to your level of vocabulary: I can expel you from Great Britain.
"So he did know who you were. That you're Lord Potter, and my ward. There's no way he approached you, you specifically, with no ulterior motive."
"Pardon me," the Queen says with mirth in her eyes.
Harry laughs. It's just too much to process at the same time.
A shiver runs through Kitten's skin.
"Why not. I'll consider it if you beat me."
Our two boys are so happy right now... It would be a shame if something happened in the next chapter...
But that's not right.
Harry takes a moment to inspect Kitten's magic. It always tells him a lot about his current state of mind and health. He feels a slight tension all over him, which he noticed already, but it's not running deep. It's something he can easily undo with a little bit of work. He feels the presence of the glamour on his face, as always, and the concealment over his back. He can vaguely feel the presence of the runes hidden under it, but nothing more. Kitten explained a long time ago that the runes are tied to his job, so under secrecy too.
“They cut cleanly, so It’s easy to reattach fingers. Dogs and wolves bites are actually more dangerous. Messier.”
"Nothing, I just told you so." Harry scowls.
The Prince looks at him like he's the biggest imbecile he ever had the disgrace of meeting.
(See the end of the chapter for
: Anyway, you need to fill a permit with the ministry so they can have a sworn ward master do it. The ward master (or mistress) will give you a key-spell, that you will have to share with your trusted ones so they can still come to your place.
"WHAT A DISGRACE! AVAD..."
"Sorry. I'm still thinking about what you told me the other day, about the Black family."
There's a moment of silence while Draco serves himself a cup of tea. Harry recognizes the delicate gestures Kitten always uses when drinking tea at the Four. Seeing the same gestures now, on the hands of the Prince, in the royal palace... It's like they found a home.
Before Harry can answer that, a wizard with an impressive moustache answers his other question.
Draco laughs at Harry’s confused look. He gets close against Harry’s back, softly takes his fingers out of the delicate silk cloth and smooths out the wrinkles.
"If you want to play, you'll have to prepare yourself. I'm too busy to deal with you right now." he says in a bored tone.
The Prince gives Harry a surprised glance over his shoulder.
"Chambers? Three weeks? Ki... Prince, you know I have a job," Harry objects, distraught.
Harry scratches at the base of the cat ears and Kitten purrs. Not a human sound, an authentic rumbling, resonating within the almost empty room.
That’s surprising. The only people who regularly drop by without asking first are his dads, but they never knock. Who could it be?
"Use your words," Harry demands.
Harry feels like scratching his head. Mendy seems okay. But she also spontaneously harmed herself because of a turn of phrase.
Harry hears the flap of their wings, first. He ignores them. They're shy. They're always more comfortable if he's not looking their way.
"Do children look like wild animals to you?" he asks with a laugh.
"What, you don't keep a plug in your pocket wherever you go?"
"I’m also skilled in transfiguration. It works on a similar logic. I recall having good marks in charms as well, but charms are easy.”
He distractedly sets the coffee to brew with a flick of his wand as he unseals the letter.
Harry nods numbly, not capable of much else.
"Yes, well, you have the whole backstory. Last cycle, seven years ago, I didn't complain when Mother suggested I let her take care of it. But this year, I want to try again."
"Ah. Well. You still could have given me a warning or something."
"Get behind me."
: FINALLY. I've been telling you for YEARS that it's a basic security feature that every magical home should have!
: Are you okay? I haven’t heard from you in a while. And it's not usual for you to not answer for more than a day.
"Did you even
"I don't know why I put up with you."
Kitten’s hand strokes Harry’s side, his ass, then slithers into his pants and comes to rest on his hard dick.
"Are we not?" Draco asks.
"Do you think you could check the notes I took while talking with her? I'm not really sure if I should trust what she said."
"Oh, well, no sense in sticking around then."
"So you are not a
The room is on the smaller side, compared to the grandiose of the royal palace. In its center stands a glass coffee table where tea and scones are served. Seated in an upholstered chair, a teacup delicately held in her long fingers, her long white hair braided in complicated patterns, is her Royal Majesty the Queen of Great Britain: Narcissa Malfoy.
"It's strange. Not off-putting," Harry corrects as his hand goes from the Prince's shoulder to his throat to his chin, caressing the pale skin. "It's a change, of course. Your face, now this. But, if anything, it makes you even more beautiful."
"As is proper," Mendy confirms, chest filling with pride.
"What are you studying for? Some kind of certification?"
Draco wants children? With him?
"Maybe I could have." He shrugs. "But magical animals tend to like me, and I like them better than most Quidditch players," he explains with a half-smile.
"Can you guys actually explain what's going on?" Ron asks. "I have no idea what you're fighting about. Neville knows some sort of secret about Sirius?"
Sirius's hand reaches for him.
"You call her Narcissa?! You know her?"
Harry claps a hand on his mouth. Shit! He was so expecting Draco to force moans out of him he forgot talking also counts! He's so stupid! He walked right into Draco's trap. He wants to throw insults at him, but that would make sounds. He throws the finger at him instead, but Draco makes no indication he even saw it. Asshole.
So Harry starts chatting about his day, all the while scratching and petting his partner's hair and neck. Kitten sighs and slowly relaxes.
"Journalists, I guess. They go away when the wards warn them they've been detected and will get a fine."
Narcissa does have something... calculated about her. Like she's careful in everything she does. Always perfectly polite, perfectly pristine.
"Sadly, yes. And if there is no way to convince her to take on the wards one more cycle, then my duty to this country is to mitigate the deleterious effects of this mistake. Hence your presence here."
For a moment, Harry’s attention is all focused on the foal. He checks how much he’s grown since last week, if he’s energetic, doesn’t have parasites in his coat… He forgets a bit about Draco for a few minutes. Distracted, he almost misses what Draco says next.
"The very last of the memories in these bottles."
During her litany Sirius grabs Remus and there's a crack of apparition, but their silhouette only wobbles, without disappearing.
"It's nice, you know."
"So we're still the same?" Draco asks, again, worry dripping from his lips.
Harry's other hand curls on Draco's hip.
All while continuing his ministrations, Harry carefully monitors Kitten's levels of endorphins, the state of his nerves, the wonderful transformation of pain signals into pleasure. It would be easy, to let himself fall into his partner's sensations, to turn up all dials to the max and to
Because they were not boyfriends yet, right? Harry doesn't see himself explaining to his dads how this relationship started out as just sex and blurrily progressed to today's point. From this perspective, it's not so strange that they didn't meet that often. They were just friends having sex.
"You're not mad?"
The Queen stops yelling right here. It looks like she has something stuck in her throat, her face going from red to white in a split second.
"A pensieve?" Harry asks, surprised. That's not exactly a common household item.
"You're holding your pose so well," Harry compliments with a scratch to Kitten's head. "Good job."
"WHAT? NO YOU'RE NOT! YOU'VE BEEN SAVING YOURSELF!"
Silence.
This mostly concludes this mini-arc exploring the past. Next chapter will be a lot sweeter !
"What is it?"
He would hate having house elves.
"Good boy. So good for me." He removes the holding bag from Kitten's head. "So good at keeping your pose too."
"Answer me," Draco demands, still gentle but a bit more forceful.
"Your not - boyfriend - because - we - haven't - talked - about - a - term - for - us - but - what - anyone - else - would - call - boyfriend?"
"I could have talked about this with you. Quidditch, and these sorts of things. It wouldn't have put my anonymity in jeopardy." Draco looks out the window, his grey eyes reflecting the sky. "But I wanted to keep things... separated, so to speak. Seeing you at the Four, it's a break from all the stress in my life. I don't want to talk about my job or anything of the sort when I'm there, with you. But..." His eyes turn toward Harry, a strange warmth swimming in it. "... I find myself sharing the sentiment you just expressed. Talking with you about mundane aspects of my life is actually quite enjoyable."
"Now you're just making clichés," Harry mutters.
Draco's entire frame tenses.
Draco offers his hand. Harry laces their fingers confidently. They disapparate.
Harry tells them the events of the morning, concluding with a gesture to the books spread over the table.
Kitten answers with a lewd smile.
"The ceremony?" Neville asks.
She drops to the ground and repeatedly bashes her head to the ground.
Harry bites his lip, organising his thoughts. Draco seemed really insecure about this topic yesterday, so he needs to be careful choosing his words. Thankfully, Draco leaves him all the time he needs.
"As long as you avoid calling me that in front of officials. Bad enough that my mother heard it."
This chapter contains a flashback that's a bit violent, featuring Walburga being a bad parent and human being in general. You can skip the entire pensieve flashback if necessary. There's a summary of this scene at the end of the chapter.
"Just let us go!" Sirius yells, his free hand desperately clinging to Remus who's looking in worse and worse shape.
"Going to ruin your bed..."
"More..." he pleads, and oh, how can Harry say no to these eyes full of tears?
Remus and Sirius share a look.
"Okay. And after that?"
"Pads, dear, stop making threats and come help instead," Remus asks gently.
Because he knows Draco.
"Look, Kitty. Our friend Luna is going to immortalise your face when it's full of ecstasy. So everyone will know how pretty you are when you come your brains out."
"Don't see any reason why I wouldn't. What do you have in mind?"
"Yes. But it makes them feel safer if they're the ones leading me there."
Harry hums happily as he gets ready for the day. Today he has all day for himself and his creatures. It's good to be home in peace, but he sort of misses Draco already. They’ve seen each other a lot this whole week, with all the work they have to do together for the ceremony. Studying Draco’s clothes, then the spells, and after that Harry got introduced to the priests, then Lady Zabini wasted almost one whole day criticizing Draco’s way of pronouncing the spells… They’ve been busy. Even if it was mostly work, he had a lot of fun just spending time with Draco.
"I'm sure you'll overhear about it," Harry says curtly. At Neville's face, he instantly regrets his outburst. "I don't want to talk about it right now... Later?"
Harry bites his lips and forces himself to relax. That's just teasing at this point. He can handle it.
: I’m sorry to hear that.
"Ah, yes. They can be a bit... playful."
“If you must,” he says with a pout.
Harry unshrinks his bag of meat and opens it. The potent smell makes Draco cough, which Harry snickers at. The thestrals raise their heads, interested. Nyx is the first to come trotting, of course she is, the glutton.
When Kitten does, Harry grabs his chin and turns his head outward.
"Kitty Draco," Harry teases with a scratch to the ear.
"This magic is collected and redistributed by the runes on the body of the members of the current ruling family."
"I've never seen thestrals that close. They're beautiful."
Can Draco still do that, now? He did say that he liked having Harry completely separated from his life, like a break from the stress. Now that Harry's very much involved with his life, can Draco still truly relax in his arms?
"One of those days you'll come in and I'll be naked," Harry comments as he lowers the heat of the stove before turning around.
"What can Mendy do for you?"
Draco's eyebrows shoot into his hairline.
"It's a really fascinating topic," Hermione comments as she closes one book to start on another. "There is so much to these kinds of historical creations. So many different rituals, spells and enchantments, all stacked on top of each other and interacting in unpredictable ways."
"...Yes. But there are ‘feelings and stuff’ between us. Right?" Draco insists.
"Oh, Harry..."
The room is shrouded in darkness. It's night, and the only light comes from the moon, pouring from the open window and revealing the two figures who just apparated. Harry is forced to take a step forward to be able to clearly look at them.
There is a tense silence while Harry gathers his thoughts.
"What is bothering you? You know you can tell us anything," Remus says calmly, almost a whisper.
Harry blinks rapidly to help his eyes adapt to the sudden change in brightness. And as the face of the intruder comes into focus, Harry recognises her.
Draco's hand slightly presses around his knee.
"I said I'd do it," Harry repeats, a bit more forcefully. "You need help, and I can give it. I don't care about anything else. Just tell me what I should do."
"... That's not how it works? And every seven years isn't often at all."
"Well I know now that the Queen and Sirius had the same surname before they both married into another name, and they were related apparently."
Harry contemplates the runes, feeling them pulse quietly under the Prince's skin.
"I guess I'm making it up from all the times you rejected my flashcards at Hogwarts."
"What were you good at in Hogwarts?" Harry asks, realizing suddenly that now that he knows Draco's identity, he can actually ask these questions, and not get a blunt 'That would be identifying information' in response.
"You did ask me not to tell you about my sex life."
"We'll fetch someone to replace you during this time. Surely your animals will understand."
That explains the secrecy. Their sexual activities are suddenly worth a national scandal. Harry's never been in the media spotlight before but something tells him he wouldn't enjoy it.
Harry grits his teeth. Not the right time to bring up the Ministry's stance on who should really not be treated the same way as a Kneezle by wizarding laws.
"Yeah, the books explained that."
Harry takes a second to digest this. He needs it.
"Make sure I'm okay. The ceremony is very... heavy, magic-wise. You're here to monitor my magic, make sure that I'm not overwhelmed by the spells... that sort of thing,” Draco concludes with a shrug.
Draco sits on the sofa next to him and folds his legs under him.
Harry doesn’t know if it’s Draco’s definition of pretty. But it’s certainly his. The wind on his face, the soft soil under his boots, the smell of pine trees and nature’s magic warming his fingertips… That’s home. A home more beautiful and magical than any Palace built of dead stones.
"I'm all for whispering sweet words in your ear for hours…” Harry starts. “But can we do that later? For once, I may have an answer to the ongoing mystery of Sirius's family. I'm going to be really, really frustrated if an angry hippogriff suddenly beats down the door and interrupts this conversation before I get my answer."
"So it is." Harry repeats, his grin larger.
Not a half second later an elf apparates right in front of him, bowing so low her nose is pressed flat against the carpet.
"What? Of course I'm okay, why wouldn't I?"
"How dare you... The only thing worth something in you, you threw it away for a dog? YOU'RE TERRIBLE! HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME! TO YOUR FUTURE CONSORT!"
"You do?! You're so depraved!"
He licks his lips.
Harry takes Draco's chin and brings him up to kiss him like they always kiss: with fire and a fight for dominance. Soon they're licking in each other's mouths. Harry's hand slips against Draco's back, goes lower, meets the fabric of Draco's robes, bunched around his hips. His fingers tease at the limit of the fabric, slip under, just a little bit, searching...
Harry wipes his hands, puts on some pants and opens the door.
"That's the thing. It wasn't a secret at all," Harry exposes.
"That's very kind Harry, but you don't need to make time for us. We understand that time is precious to you at the moment..." Remus tries again.
"Don't you see? Your parents, and all the magical parents of our peers know, obviously!" Hermione says. "They were alive when this happened. Unless memory spells were involved, they have to know."
"Dementors can enter Great Britain," Harry points out.
"Please hit my ass."
Once they see the food, It doesn’t take long for the thestrals to gather around Harry and completely ignore Draco. Harry laughs at the goofers who try to put their heads in the bag; growls at the rude ones who try to steal from their friend’s mouth; whispers at the shy ones who wait for everyone else to have eaten before approaching.
"Okay. Let's hear your advice then."
Draco sees him resisting. With a flick of his wand, he makes the spell squeeze just a little bit more around his dick, and it's becoming very difficult to think about anything besides pleasure.
: I resent that. First of all, it's made of wood.
Harry stops walking at that moment, and closes his arm around Draco. Draco stumbles, surprised by the sudden gesture.
Draco sighs.
Draco relaxes just a fraction, letting himself be held.
"It isn't," the Prince insists. "I'm still me. My face, my job, does it matter? You know me where it counts. Did I change because my outside is a little bit different?"
"What's bothering you?" he repeats.
"... Thank you? Pardon me to be blunt, but who are you exactly?"
“Aw, jealous?”
The Prince has to keep an eye on his potion, so they settle down in the lab, on a conjured sofa. As soon as they're seated the Prince grabs his own robes and throws them over his head.
A more simple explanation comes to Harry: Draco is only talking hypothetically. As a friendly conversation. Harry is probably reading way too much into it.
“Right.”
"Th... aaah... Thank you..."
family, he changed the subject with the subtlety of a ten-foot bludger. And from Remus I got the same answer as you. If I wait for Sirius to talk about it, I'll wait forever."
"Eh, I'm free now, and I'm here," Neville points out.
"Have you tried cursing them?"
"They won't hurt us," Harry reassures. "Even if that's really 'their' goal, we're a strong family. You're the best parents I could ever ask for. I won't let anything get between us, I promise."
It's time to go just one step deeper.
The guard salutes and closes the door before him, leaving the three of them alone.
: What do you want me to bring?
Kitty whines softly.
"Yeah, such a shame. So, Samhain?"
"You've worked hard since yesterday, didn't you? You think you've earned a reward?" Draco whispers into the hollow of Harry's throat.
Harry has no idea what Draco's political stance is. They never talked about politics. Harry really doesn't care much...
"We do, just... Harry, let me..."
"YOU'RE STAYING HERE UNTIL I GIVE YOU PERMISSION TO LEAVE! And this disgusting thing needs to be put down. Av..."
Kitten has always been beautiful. But here, in the low light of the laboratory, with his long hair braided back and this new, pointed face, he's even more breathtakingly beautiful than usual.
"You hear that, Kitty? You look so adorable. So pettable. So fuckable."
"Hell yeah."
Harry squeezes his fingers. Draco squeezes back.
“No, I... It’s just… We didn’t talk about it, and I don’t want to assume. Ever had a one night stand announce to all of your friends that he’s your new boyfriend?”
: That would be great.
Harry racks his brain. He has so many different creatures, it’s hard to find someone who knows how to care for all of them. Buckbeak vaguely tolerates Charlie, but then who will take care of Charlie's dragons? There's Hagrid, who's always happy to be bitten by angry creatures. But he has a job too, at Hogwarts. He can't think of anyone else who'd be able to cover for him on such short notice.
This time the two spells collide in mid-air and the bed explodes.
"Couldn't you find them on your own?"
"Oh yeah? Tell me this: When you two met, he wore a glamour, right? That's what you said."
One short instant owl exchange later, Draco is back in the shack, looking hesitant.
"Seeker as well, Lord Potter?"
"I'll get to it."
Harry tugs, and the bag on Kitty's head wobbles under the strain.
"Not gonna say no to that. My ass misses your cock."
: Anything you can do?
me, and more that she has something
Both of his dads look startled by his sudden outburst.
"Here?" Harry asks in a quiet voice.
Harry's mind is still half distracted by his coffee and takes a moment to process the information. The Prince's assistant? He has never even met the Prince, and doesn't know the first thing about wards. Who thought it would be a good idea to give him this job?
Harry is far too blissed out to make that kind of analysis. All he knows is that it feels good and he doesn't dare yet sink into it, in case Draco is going to snatch it away from him at just the worst time, the bastard.
"While you're still without your magic?" Harry frowns.
We're already mid-way through the story ! Next chapter, the ceremony grows closer, and so does the pressure...
"But Iceland's wards have last been renewed more than a hundred years ago, and Iceland's King predicts it won't need treatment for at least fifty more years."
"Want everyone to see how good you are?"
"I DON'T CARE!" Sirius yells.
Harry's not sure he has an answer to give.
"It’s not over-confidence if it’s true.”
If it turns out they can't be together not even 24 hours after they started being together, Harry is going to be pissed.
"... Does that mean we're boyfriends?" Harry asks in a timid voice.
Kitten whimpers. His lips move, but his brain is too overwhelmed to make words work. Harry allows him a few moments to compose himself, but grabs his hair tighter as a warning.
know why he hates you so much."
"You will need to do it without magic during the ceremony,” Draco points out.
: ᚾᚦᚠᛗ
: I know it's very last minute, but would you perchance be available this evening?
Harry wants to retort something, but his breath is taken away.
“Hello, pretty. You’re in luck. Look what I have here…” Harry plunges his hand in the bag and presents a whole bloody goat heart. “Your favourite!” Nyx whickers excitedly. Draco gags.
"I stand my ground: Draco is really a wuss!" Sirius is still growling when Harry bothers paying attention again. "He should be able to protect Harry. What kind of boyfriend is he if he can't do that?"
Silently, Sirius exits the tiny kitchen. With an encouraging touch from Remus, Harry follows them into their room. Sirius moves his wand in front of one of the bookcases. A concealment spell turns off, a very advanced one, for Harry had never noticed it during all the years living in this house. His newfound knowledge of wards tells him just how much protection Sirius is rapidly removing, until a secret compartment pops off the bookcase. Inside is a small stone basin, engraved in runes.
"Oh, so that's what you're worried about? Well, I understand your reasons. And it's just like you said: you're still the man I know in all the ways that matter. Maybe I should prove that I still like you..."
Harry expects a big fat silence to follow his eloquent declaration. Maybe even laughter. But another journalist shoots another inane question immediately, and then Harry has to try to find an answer that doesn't sound too dumb, and just like that, half of his morning is gone. He has to discreetly charm a tree to growl like a dragon to get the journalists to finally disapparate.
More enthusiastic whispers.
Neville's inquisitive eyes show that he knows Harry's hiding something, but he's too polite to ask. Bless him.
One is clearly supporting the other's weight. They both look exhausted. They take a few steps and the stronger figure drops the other into the bed. The moonlight falls on his body, revealing tattered clothes and way too many wounds. Claws and bite marks.
The next day, after feeding the animals in his charge and dodging Buckbeak's beak, Harry apparates to the Palace. He’s led by a servant through labyrinths of corridors until they end up in some sort of dungeon. He didn't even know there were dungeons below the Palace. When Harry is certain he is truly lost, the servant knocks politely on a metal door, bows, and leaves him alone.
"Sounds like a story alright," Ron agrees. "Let's hear it then."
Harry scrubs the dirt and sweat out of his skin, making himself thoroughly clean. He rinses the day away, steps out of the shower and inspects critically his 5 o'clock shadow. Kitten likes the roughness of it sometimes. With a shrug he lets his beard be and goes rummage in the toy drawers. There's several crops and sticks in here, but he knows exactly which one Kitten prefers for light play. The collar isn't hard to find, always on top of the dresser. For clothes, he gets comfortable muggle trousers and a light shirt, something that will not be too much of a barrier on his skin. Finally ready, he tucks the toys in a small bag and apparates.
"So why are you here?" Sirius asks. He puts his hands in the pockets of his jacket, tries to appear more casual, but there's an edge in his voice.
"Hope you liked the show," Harry says to the audience, an amused smile on his lips.
"The actual crazy thing is how well she managed to cover the story!" Hermione points out. "All the history books affirm that Walburga had only one child, Regulus. I have trouble believing they were all manipulated. Unless... Unless there's a spell."
there's bad history with his family. It's not just that they're all dead or something like that, that much is obvious. But if there's something the entire pureblood sphere knows except me... I will need to know about it if we... if we're to stay a thing."
He's not sure how much time has passed by the time he comes down. A few minutes probably. He still feels fuzzy. Pleasantly fucked out would be a good descriptor. His eyes lazily follow Draco's movements around his potion. Dropping ingredients, stirring, moving his wand over it. It's hypnotic.
"Is that so?" The Queen says, suddenly eerily calm. "You'd abandon your duty to the country?"
Draco leads him to his bedroom, and the atmosphere feels less asepticised than the main room, though it still looks unnaturally clean. The bedroom contains one large bed covered with a white comforter, an opened wardrobe filled with neatly folded clothes, a full-length mirror covering the better part of one wall, and two mannequins displaying Draco's ceremonial robes.
"A spell was cast to prevent any written record of this," Neville explains in a small voice. "We call it the hush spell. If you were to write down the information, no one would be able to read it."
Sirius remains silent.
There's a crack, and the memory ends.
It's 9:46.
"Mine wasn't like that either, according to everyone else. She always lamented about how much she did for her sons, especially for me, and how ungrateful I was. But behind closed doors... You saw. Everything she did and said in polite company was calculated to make her look good."
Draco doesn’t look very reassured. Harry grabs a liver and holds it toward him.
"On your knees," Harry commands gently.
That’s an embarrassing description after the discussion he just had with Draco.
"Alright. That doesn't sound too complicated." Harry smiles confidently.
"It's. It's a lot," Harry says with a tremor in his voice. His hand is grasping the Prince's shoulder, though he doesn't remember putting it here.
"Stop, please stop!"
The robes for the first day are pure white. White-on-white embroidery shimmers at the surface, revealing more runes to the attentive eye. Harry slips his fingers inside the collar, counting one, two, three layers of robes. The outer layer is held together by a thin cord which evokes to Harry a monk's habit, except that this cord is closed by a complicated looking knot.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco feigns to ignore the insult, but Harry can see his lips curling into a smile.
Hermione and Ron both give him a bewildered look.
And what he can notice easily is that Kitten is tense as fuck.
"About two years. Why?"
"You sure?"
"Misters Lupin, pleased to meet you."
"Yes, well, that's your job."
Harry shakes his head.
"It will not be." The Prince makes a final stir. Then he turns toward Harry. "Not if you're with me."
The only problem is that now is a terrible time to put a strain on their relationship. Draco needs to be able to put his utmost trust into Harry. He shouldn’t have to question his motivations or feelings. Not now.
"Alright. I'm following you so far."
: See you at the 4 in 30?
"You can relax. I got you," Draco assures, soothing.
Draco raises an eyebrow. The Queen did that exact same face gesture earlier. So it comes from her? Weird.
"... Did something happen fourteen years ago?" His Gryffindor boldness pushes him to ask.
"Very sure. I need it. Things at work have been a bit... overwhelming, regarding my magic. I want to not feel it for a while. Feel yours instead. Filling me up." Kitten's nails softly dig into the fabric of Harry's trousers and his voice dips in pitch, syrupy as honey. "I want to feel you hold me in the palm of your hand. Completely controlling me. I want you to turn off my brain, turn off my own magic, turn off everything except you telling me that I'm doing a good job."
"Later," Neville accepts solemnly. "Ron, Hermione, it was great seeing you."
: Hey Kitty what's this rune? ꗯ
him."
“Wanna try?”
"There's... something, coming up in the near future. It's... kind of big. And stressful, yes."
This is supposed to be about love, not politics! Harry wants to shout. But how can he say that while looking at Remus in the eyes? You can’t say politics don’t matter when they affect the lives of your loved-ones. You can’t ignore that.
Neville freezes completely, like caught in a Petrificus Totalus.
"This is no easy task," the Queen compliments. "The Centaurs have always been difficult."
Harry wants to say "I don't know". He wants to say "I still don't know exactly what you're asking of me." and "Isn't there anybody more qualified for that sort of thing?" But the Prince gives him a look. And Harry can almost see his cat ears dropping, his face coated in anxiety right before Harry takes him in his arms and makes him forget everything.
At that moment, Harry notices voices from the kitchen. Hermione follows his gaze.
"I'm here to help Draco," Harry answers honestly. "I don't have any ulterior motive. I can make an unbreakable vow on it, if you'd like."
"So, umm, the wards," Harry says to distract himself from his own arousal. It is why they're here, after all.
"Of things getting different between us, just like you just said, if I pulled you into this."
: Hey >:(
"If you
"Just like they do when they pass laws against werewolves!" Sirius shouts.
"What's your broom?"
"For allowing me to cooome..."
"So, how are things going with your Prince?" Sirius asks once they are sitting on the couch, while Remus makes tea.
"Of course," Kitten huffs. "It's not me who goes home with his collar still on half the time."
"We have work." He gestures toward the flashcards spread on the table. "I'll unpack all
Harry watches the two echoes of the past in fascination. He never saw any picture of Sirius this young. It looks like they aren't even twenty. Did they graduate Hogwarts yet?
"You will be excused from your job, of course," the Queen counters.
Neville frowns slightly in concentration.
Never before did he feel like such a stranger in front of the house he grew up in.
"Wanker."
They spend half an hour on this. Draco gently guides Harry's fingers through the knots and ties, the proper way to adjust each part and how to make sure the whole edifice doesn't unravel the moment Draco moves a finger. Harry is focused, delicately touching the precious fabrics and the Prince’s porcelain skin. And if his fingers trail a little too long on the skin, if he steals a kiss here and there… Draco doesn’t complain.
"Sirius was born into the royal family," Harry explains. "The predecessor of Narcissa's predecessor was Sirius's mother."
"Aaaaw pup!" Sirius jumps on Harry, gets him into a headlock and rubs his hair. "You want to grab a pair of brooms and throw a quaffle? That always cheers you up!"
Harry kisses his cheek.
"As a matter of fact..."
Kitten is looking directly at him now, his head resting in his lap. His mercury eyes are burning, dark and full of promises. Harry's hand closes on his hair and pulls, slow but strong, to bare his neck. Kitten hisses, a good hiss, a sound that goes straight to Harry's dick. Harry's other hand caresses his cheek, the column of his throat, and comes to rest over his heart.
Remus smacks Sirius across the head to prevent him from finishing that sentence.
"Progressing," Harry answers carefully, still not knowing who this woman is.
"It's always better to be close for this ceremony."
"I'll make cookies," Ron says very seriously, like it's the solution to all problems.
"YOU DARE TO RAISE YOUR VOICE AGAINST YOUR OWN MOTHER!"
"It's... it's weird," Harry tries to explain after a moment of silence. "I know your magic so well... or at least, I thought I did. I may not have known your name or even your face, but knowing someone's magic, it's more than that. And now that the runes aren't concealed, your magic is so different. And I'm still trying to get used to your real face. Everything feels so... different."
: I don't like the media.
Draco produces a long, particularly dramatic sigh.
"Yep. Don't look too directly at them. They're easily spooked."
"I can imagine that," Harry answers awkwardly.
"Stimulate them for what, Kitty? Be precise."
"Put this in. Don't touch yourself."
"Do you often have trouble with wandering muggles?" Draco asks after a while, sounding mildly curious.
"I would agree with the sentiment if we were three years ago. But the Nimbus has a new acceleration charm since the 3000 model that really makes a difference. I own a 3012 model if you want to try it."
"Oh, uh, uuuuh, Yeah! He's so, so cute. You're very cute," he says toward Kitty directly, awe in his eyes. "I really want to pet you. Your hair looks soft."
"Most people find them scary."
“Please don’t hug fire crabs.”
"My future children?" Sirius stands tall, defying. "You're looking at their father," he declares, pointing to Remus who looks barely conscious.
"My mother
Harry snorts.
"I know he will," the Prince answers in his place.
The plug doesn't vibrate strongly. But it's there, it's impossible to ignore, and Harry is not allowed to touch. And Draco... does nothing. Doesn't even indicate that he notices Harry being here. At some point he wanders off in another part of the laboratory that Harry can't see from his couch, and he seriously wonders if Draco forgot he turned that thing on.
"This magic. Can I feel it?" Harry asks to break the tension.
"I'm not sure..."
"Well. Now I know. No use ruminating on it," Harry decides brusquely.
"They're very scary, and beautiful."
Harry snorts.
"Okay, I got it!" Past-Sirius whispers, a small potion bottle in his victorious hand. "Let's get out of here."
: Not that the average muggle lock is worth much, but still!
That could be an issue. He and Draco probably have very different ideas about what their relationship is, right now. Does Draco have other partners at the moment? He didn't say...
“Is it alright, me being here? Won’t I scare them?”
Draco sighs. He shakes his head and Harry can see the tension seeping out of eyes, replaced by a sort of exasperated fondness.
Harry quickly walks after him and grabs his hand.
"You think I care enough about you to pretend anything?" Sirius growls.
"Jeez, what was that?"
"What are you brewing?" Harry asks when he's bored of looking.
Draco now peers curiously at the canopy below them. Harry is curious too. Will Draco be able to see them...?
Harry doesn't know what to do with himself.
my mother."
"May I?" Harry asks.
"Yes. For the very last time," Present-Sirius says, a trembling hand on Harry's shoulder searching for Remus's fingers.
"I... kinda have to learn how to renew the entire wards of Great Britain."
With a sharp twist of the wrist, he makes Kitten's clothes disappear. His pale skin glows like a halo against the shiny black vinyl, the contrast mesmerising. Harry's eyes follow the long lines of his legs, the pale shadow cast by a hipbone, the little patch of pearly hair between his legs.
Is that it? No, Draco is only waiting for him to drop his guard. Harry stays tense, waiting for the other shoe to drop... How long has it been already? There's only ten minutes to this game, what is Draco waiting for?
"I guess that's all... Thank you Mendy."
So, what do you think Draco is going to show Harry ?
"To make me feel pleasure d-, directly."
A brush against his cock. Harry tenses like a bow, almost jumping out of the couch. He shoves a fist into his mouth to prevent any sound from escaping. He steals a glance at Draco. He’s still working on his potion. Unperturbed. Unconcerned by Harry's obscene display. Above this sort of sexual depravity. Harry closes his eyes, because Draco's focused face is a serious turn-on and he doesn't need any more of that right now.
They stay close for a moment, quietly breathing each other's air.
Draco smiles and pushes Harry down onto the couch. Harry’s hands try to grab him, but Draco stays away, leaving Harry the only one sitting. Harry whines.
Harry closes his eyes and relaxes on the sofa.
"Want me to make you moan?"
"Not even in general terms, unrelated to Sirius?"
"Yes," he answers in a breathy voice.
Harry chokes.
(See the end of the chapter for
: And if someone tries to force their way in, there are various levels of security available.
Naturally, a money scandal involving the Crown is vastly more interesting than the routine renewal of the country's wards, and it seems everyone and their neighbours has read the article. Suddenly, people Harry has not talked to since Hogwarts owl him to ask for details, phrasing it as generously providing him with a chance to tell his side of the story before judging him.
"Maybe less than the average couple..."
"I'm convinced, no problem on that front," Harry agrees, his gaze wandering on the elaborate mouldings of the ceiling. No doubt about that. Kitten
Harry spots Kitten immediately, his long, silky white hair the only bright thing in the dimly lit teashop. He's sitting on a floppy ottoman in front of a low table, poshly drinking tea. Harry makes his way to him and greets him with a kiss on the cheek.
"So... you got the letter," Kitten, no,
"Harder, please," Kitten whines.
“If there’s one thing that’ll never change, it’s you being a greedy slut.”
Harry hears the branches cracking and the swears flowing. He smiles, knowing Draco is approaching. His patronus licks his hand, then disappears.
"Sirius, that's ridiculous,” Harry protests. “We've known each other for two years and Draco kept his identity a secret. And he would have continued, if he didn't need me for that thing. How can he… What are you even implying? Convert me? How could he do that without saying he's the Prince?"
Harry puts the tip of his wand against the knot and murmurs a spell. The knot unties then re-ties itself in the exact same shape.
The Prince's eyes turn to the ground, his posture becoming a bit... unsure.
"A teashop," Harry answers, volunteering nothing else.
"Welcome to my rooms." Draco says as he opens one of the many doors of the Palace.
"Draco's just visiting me. We're together." Harry’s heart does a little looping at being able to finally say this confidently. He can feel himself blush like a teenager, which is annoying, but he's too happy to care.
That reassures Harry a little bit. Even if the Malfoys never talk to them, they're not alone.
"How are the preparations for the ceremony going so far?"
"I wanna cuddle a bit more," he explains.
"So you
"What are you thinking about?" Draco asks, frowning.
: Asshat.
accusing him of profiting from his position to make lavish extensions to his personal home.
And Harry dives in.
"Yes, I can be patient, I want that, please."
"I'll make you eat dirt with pleasure," Harry grins.
: Why would Draco have better security?
Harry scratches the white belly offered to him. Harry's seen this body many, many times, but it's still as breathtaking as the first time. The pearly white skin, the lithe, svelte silhouette. It's a wet dream come true. One would think that a little glamour or two are at play here but Harry knows it's not the case. Not on anywhere but his face. Kitten is beautiful and pliant under his fingers, ready to be turned into a whimpering mess.
is stressed and in need of a good fuck, Harry notes. They usually prefer to chat a bit and catch up before going into business.
Out of small talk, Harry falls silent, his hands around the warm mug. He doesn't know what to say. He doesn't want to disturb this peace. This normality. If he asks about the Blacks, there's no going back. He can't, or rather he doesn't want to pretend Sirius has no past that he knows of.
something." Sirius spits the word like an insult.
"You didn't know your guardian's birth name?" Draco asks with only a polite amount of surprise.
"Can we stop already?!"
Sirius grumbles something probably bad about Draco, while Remus looks intrigued.
"Really?"
"Alright, one history lesson for you right away."
"So this is about him being from Slytherin." Harry groans. Really, all that tension for this?
The Prince turns around to fling an arm around Harry's midsection.
Even with these little breaks, Harry senses Kitten's breaking point coming up quickly. You can't sustain this level of intensity for a very long time. His dick is hard as a rock and leaking all over his thighs. It took just a few minutes of poking at the right nerves to ruin him. Harry never tires of it.
Soon, three thestrals glide around them, their great leathery wings flapping silently in the air.
"Fighting like old friends I see," the Queen interrupts. "Good. For a second I feared you might not know each other as well as my son indicated. After all, he never told me a word about you."
"Samhain," Draco says once he has taken a single sip of his tea. "Will you help?"
A wave of feelings fills up Harry's chest, so much that he can't speak. Instead, he closes the gap between them and wraps his arms around Draco.
"Uuuuh..." Harry answers eloquently. The only other rooms in his cabin are the toilets and his bedroom, where various sex toys are currently thrown everywhere. Not the best setting for a serious talk.
"His what...? Is this... Is this about him being from Slytherin? Cause if it is, it's really childish of you."
Her tone is amiable, but it feels like an order. An order that Harry obeys.
The Prince finishes his tea and stands up.
He disapparates, not knowing what to think.
: Next time I'll send an actual owl to let you know you have an instant message.
Mendy stops immediately, as though suspended in time.
"And you're doing so well so far." Harry punctuates his line with a blow of the crop, eliciting another delicious gasp from Kitten.
Harry brings back the unfinished tea to the bar, keeping Kitten's hair in his other hand. He only lets go when they get to the tight spiral staircase leading downstairs, which would be unsafe to navigate otherwise.
With zero hesitation, Harry removes his glasses and shrugs off his robes.
"I'll have to go in a couple hours to check on a pregnant unicorn, but I have time until then."
"What's the terror beyond the sea?"
Harry can't help coloring at the thought, and that makes him even more annoyed.
"Politics are dreadfully tiring. Be thankful you only have to deal with it for a short time," Draco says.
"That would please me. I've spent a nice moment with you, Lord Potter. But alas, duty never pauses. We shall meet again."
Tense seconds pass slowly in silence.
"Sorry?"
But now's not the time to get noisy about that. Rather, he has to get into Kitten's state of mind, know what he wants, what he needs tonight.
Now that he thinks about it, when was the last time he had sex with someone else than Draco? Draco is often available and their kinks are all compatible. Before, he would call one partner or the other depending on if he felt like domming or subbing that night. But with Draco, every itch is scratched. They never discussed being in a relationship, much less an exclusive one. But somehow, Harry has neglected his other partners and let them fade into the past.
"Do you want to talk about it with us?" Hermione asks, once Neville has left via the floo.
"... and that's why I have to learn all this stuff."
"I like you, you know."
"What will I stuff your ass with while I work, I wonder..." Draco muses aloud.
"Look, they all think you're pretty too."
The Prince frowns, his eyes still closed. Harry's fingers close around his hair and pull. The Prince groans.
Harry leaves them have this eternal debate. Normally he would help Remus shut down Sirius, but he has the beginning of a headache and just wants to get the fodder over with.
"Oh, uh, not right now!" Draco says quickly, panicking. "Don't freak out please!"
"Yeah well now that I'm hanging out with Draco, the Queen and all that, it's not so much in the past, is it?"
"Is there a problem with that?"
"Once the magic of the wards is stabilised, we progressively restore the flow of my own magic until we're back to its usual state."
Draco rolls his eyes.
Kitten makes an adorable whining sound and his cat ears fall down in sadness.
"Like I care. Don't move, I know I have healing salves somewhere."
"Pleased to meet you, your Highness., Harry politely greets.
The Queen shrieks, the sound an impossible volume and pitch.
"Them?"
Harry takes a breath, and dives.
The Prince smirks.
Draco frowns some more, then shrugs, letting the matter drop.
Kitten nods with a humming sound.
Draco is the same, when they talk with the Queen. He's himself only when he's alone with Harry. Behind closed doors.
"Who wakes you up?!" Sirius demands. "I'll curse them!"
"I can see that. Is the perspective of fathering a child who will sit on a throne this scary?" Draco jokes.
, says.
The elf beams with pride.
As soon as he hears the crack of apparition signaling that his guardians are gone, Harry slumps against the door, his face in his hands.
“How have you never lost a finger to those fangs?” Draco asks warily, watching how Nyx rips the heart out of Harry’s hands.
They all turn toward Neville, who squirms.
Sirius is ready to shout something back, but he stops, thrown off by her sudden calmness.
"What? No! I'm not going to end a relationship I didn't even know I had!"
"It sounds better in the original Anglo-Saxon. It rhymes," the Prince adds.
"Your Majesty, I doubt my animals will be content to fend for themselves for three weeks."
Kitten whines and pushes his head under Harry's hand. With one hand he pets the cat ears, with the other his belly. It's soft and comfortable. A moment to relax together, to become familiar once again with each other's body.
"You are a wildcard, Lord Potter."
Harry nods, his throat briefly too tight with happiness.
Kitten shivers, all the way from his head to the tip of his tail. Harry keeps a hand in his partner's hair, strokes the silky strands between his fingers, and slowly touches his magic again.
"Ron!" Hermione chastises. "BDSM is a perfectly normal..."
"Mother, please," the Prince sighs. "It doesn't need to be a full-time job, Harry. You're already well prepared, believe me."
: Oh no, such a fate :( Truly worse than death! How will I snog you from France?
"No! Yes!" Harry interrupts. "I do have some feelings for you.” Wow, confessing is so easy when you’re panicking. “But that doesn't
"I'm feeling a lot better," Kitten agrees.
"Let's train you, then," the Prince says with a smirk full of double-entendre that makes Harry blush.
, Potter. The counter resets."
Ah, yes. This is only until the ceremony. Then he will go back to being Draco's secret not-boyfriend.
"That's not a very enthusiastic answer."
Sirius laughs.
"Nope."
After that he relaxes a bit. He knows he's only at the beginning of a very long edge. Better not make things harder for himself by getting too excited. He's sufficiently hard as it is, with the heavy plug pushing right against his sweet spot.
Hermione grabs one of the books and reads the title aloud.
The rest of the conversation is spent in peace, FINALLY. Sure, Sirius stays grumpy, but Remus is doing his best to keep the boring conversation going, and it's wonderfully relaxing. So relaxing that Harry doesn't notice falling asleep. When the
That gets Harry to sit straighter.
"Look. Sirius will never tell me. He can talk for hours about my birth parents and their families. But the few times I tried to ask about
"I asked once but he deflected. I didn't think it was important."
"Not at Hogwarts, then?"
"Seems like you had fun," Kitten says with a smile.
"Simple curiosity."
The Prince pinches the bridge of his nose.
That’s new information.
They're silent for a moment, the only sound being Harry's fingers scratching Draco's scalp.
"Come here pup."
"... I need a moment..."
"... Harry? Are you alright?"
"You don't have to talk about it," Harry says in the reassuring tone he uses in play. "But if something went badly during the ceremony, it would be best that I know about it. So I can help you to the best of my ability."
