They Apperated straight to Olivanders. Draco went pale when he saw the old man in question still there. Sitting in a wheelchair. His hair was a bit fuller. He had gained some weight. But he looked healthier. He was alive.
a.. basic line of respect and perhaps an alliance had been formed between them. Draco didn’t dare call it friendship. He was too afraid of the consequences that would have. He already got nasty looks when they walked to class together.
He had made good progress. He was feeling better. Less and less did he have to put up a front of being happy and doing well. He was enjoying himself and finding things to be happy about.
“I’m not in a place to go in on that. I doubt he’d like me to discuss it with you but… he does have trouble dealing with his losses.. he’s a bit of the rails.”
“The hearing of Lucius Abraxis Malfoy shall be moved as new evidence has come forward by accounts of his wife and son.” Another slam of the hammer. His hands were freed.
They hadn’t spoken since.. since she had left the basement at the manor, he froze for a moment, looking down at her. She looked better. No longer frail, still looking just past you as she had always done. Tonight was different, her eyes met his. “Draco?  Care to have a dance with me?” she asked, there was no ice in her tone. There never was. Her voice was childish as ever. Childish and kind, she never lost her spirit. Even with the horrific things they had done….
He looked around. “Make friends.” That’s what Pansy told him when she had also refused to go. “You’ll lose Blaise. So make friends with the others. You’ll be fine.” He took another sip. Liquid courage right? Making his way over to Neville. Who seemed the most approachable of the bunch. He was talking to Lovegood.. which made him hesitate.
“Good… we’ll also be holding this.” He took up a twig, a quick tap of his wand turning it into a pole. “You decide the pace today. We’ll work on speeding up later..” he held it out, letting Draco take one end. Who took it rather hesitant.
“He’ll push you away. He’ll fight you. He’ll be a right git to try and rid of you. but I’m asking you to please keep pushing. Eventually he’ll accept it. Especially from you. My god Potter.. If you knew how many “Potter” rant’s I’ve endured over the years… Point is. He needs you. I believe there’s a reason you two were put up together. Both the golden boys of the opposite sides.”
He choose instead to go for a nice hot and steamy shower. By the time he got out he was thoroughly steamed through. His cheeks slightly flushed. His hair combed back the way he used to wear it. He got into his uniform for dinner, and made his way to the common room. Picking up his book again while he waited for Pansy and Blaise to pick him up for dinner.
“Sure Harry.” He mocked. They weren’t on a first name basis yet right? Too soon. They year had only just started.
“Asking favours after the fact? How very Slytherin of you. My notes are on the desk. You can compare them and ask me any questions after.” He hummed, taking one of the cookies.
“Well Pans. If you want to do more advanced stuff. Why don’t you bring it up? I’m certain no one would have a problem with it.”
He walked to the field with Hermoine and Ron. Talking about their usual stuff. This year they would be celebrating Samhain with a ball. Ron had an actual suit this time and Hermoine wouldn’t tell them what she would be wearing this time. No matter how much Ron was begging to tell her.
Potter grumbled in reply, getting into the same outfit as Sunday, skipping the robes like Draco had. No need to wear those. Today was one of those summer standing on its last legs. It was hot outside. Hot enough for Draco to debate risking wearing running shorts… but he decided against it. There were too many scars and he’d burn his pale skin to ashes.
“I’ve got some recipes. If we don’t end up cooking more we should do so after Hogwarts. You’ve got the patience it takes and I’m certain it’ll work out.” Harry replied, finishing his slice and making himself another.
Mandy Brocklehurst and Sally smith, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff had been friends before and seemed to do just fine together.
“My my. Try again. You can do better than that.” Harry snickered, lighting his own, showing him how to do it.
“Oh geez buddy.. you’re back? I’m glad to see you’re alright!” Harry whispered loudly. He was reeking of alcohol and clearly worse off than Draco had been.
Harry instead began picking some of the fur off of his clothes before dressing into his own sports gear. Wondering how a cat had gotten into their dorm.
“Ginger and Lemon zest.” He took his own. Could’ve used some more ginger.. but it was doable. He felt the potion run through his veins. He only felt groggy now.
No library time, as much as that hurt his soul. Perhaps some late night walks?  Early morning wasn’t a possibility without having to wake Potter up. He wasn’t much of a morning person either, so late night it was. He didn’t bother planning in time with his friends. He didn’t want to burden them with seeing him. He was too controversial. Blaise could help raise Pansy’s status and she would be good. Draco just needed to focus on getting as many O’s as he could possibly get. It was only a year. He could get through this. Perhaps if he worked hard enough, he could go and get a healer’s apprenticeship. Though unlikely, he felt confident enough to dream a little.
He combined the black jeans with a white button up, done up all the way up till pansy had undone all but two in the middle which made him grateful for the overcoat he’d picked. This woman was insane. It was nearly winter for merlins sake.
I'm just taking it as I go. Me rewritting every chapter 8 times before im satisfied seems to be a theme. and every time i just upload it out of frustration. I hope no one minds.
“I expected no less Malfoy. Want to try again? This time keep your shoulders straight, don’t lean forward.. oh and to get her into a trot, press your heels into her stomach and click your tongue. She responds really well so no need to kick her.” He instructed.
“Harry you had a nightmare. Do you want me to sit closer? It might help grounding you. try to focus on my breathing alright.” Harry nodded slowly. Draco carefully peeled the covers away, sitting next to him and pushing their legs and shoulders together. Going as far as to take the others hands the way his mother had done for him when he had dreams this bad.
Draco turned to Harry, whom was wearing a big, excited grin. “you cannot be possibly excited to do this Potter.”
“I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.” He was full on bawling now like a child. “I’m sorry for being mean all the time.” He sobbed into the others chest while he received some awkward back pats in return. Those pats soon turned into a hug, a tight warm hug.
He felt rather satisfied, the uneasiness from earlier had left his body completely by now. He looked at Potter beside him. His eyes darting to the dopey smile on his lips. He certainly liked seeing Harry like this. Satisfied, a bit sweaty, slightly flushed, handsome, a bit messy. Bit like one would expect him to look after a good shag. Not that Draco would want to know or knew what that looked like. That was simply the best way to put it. Really. Trust me.
He sprinted forward, Potter right beside him. His face was focused, they both had the same goal. Getting through this as soon as possible.
“This year will be hell wont it?” Pansy said, sitting down next to him, softly stroking his hair out of his eyes. “We’ll need all the friends we can get.. I suggest we at least make up.”
As soon as they were in sight of the stables Amour called to them immediately. Popping her head out of her stable. The weather was getting colder and during the night they were being locked away now.
“I know.. It must have run into the threstrals or griffins maybe? I feel bad for it, it’s rather friendly. I think you’d like him.”
Hermoine was the first to go for a band. She seemed rather excited about the whole ordeal. Eager to learn more about the ritual. Anderson put it on her arm, taking out his wand, which was in quite the state. He aught to learn something about proper wand care…  he muttered a spell in a language Draco had never heard before.
“We’re having a cooking class instead of sports since even leigh seems to realize that making us run over a field and ride horses hungover is cruel.”
The next morning was rather awkward. Waking up to bedhead potter jamming his curtains open. “Malfoy. If you don’t get up you’re going to miss breakfast and getting your timetable.” Was thrown his way. But potter didn’t leave, despite being already ready to walk out.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about Potter. I don’t know if you’ve ever fallen down a bunch of stairs. But they’re pretty big. Now if you’ll excuse me. I’m tired. I’m sorry. It won’t happen again. Night.”
He got into his robes fairly quick. Finding his tie was now bronze and an icy blue with a faint silver line in between the colors. Fantastic. Not even a Slytherin anymore.
By 1pm Draco found himself in bed. Tossing and turning and struggling to catch sleep. His mind was filled with too many thoughts.
“We meditate. So sit on the bed. Feet on the floor. Palms up.” Potter hummed. The git was enjoying this huh. Taking the lead in yet another thing. This was becoming a theme and Draco wasn’t a fan of it.
“Ah well. Anderson asked me to help you with finding your core. He said your paper was incredible he asked me to perhaps help you find your core.” He put a hand in his hair, combing it out. “Because you know.. I found mine already and were roommates and it would be helpful to know yours too.”
“I know, it’s one of my redeeming qualities. I can’t be perfect all the time you know.” Harry chuckled in reply. “I’ll get her back into the field. you relax for a bit.” He hummed, already starting on it.
“yet it is Scum.” Aah.. a Hufflepuff he had been forced to put into detention. He felt his wand being taken from his pocket. But he wasn’t completely defenseless. He knew some minor wandless magic.. enough to make a hex jump back.. but they weren’t planning on hexing him.
He drew an upside triangle. “Water. An element of healing and peace.” He draw another upside down triangle with a stripe though the bottom of it. “Earth. And element of grounded, logical and hardworking people.” Regular triangle “Fire. Courage and passionate.” Regular triangle with a stripe through the bottom. “Air. The element for social butterflies. They are known for their joy.” Anderson hummed.
They watched Ron walk up to his girlfriend, taking her hand and smiling at her, hermoine flushing lightly and shooting quick glances at Draco and Blaise whom had joined with Pansy at his side. The two of them grinned back. Pansy however was shooting the two of them glares, knowing full well who were responsible for dressing Hermoine Granger like a fancy pureblood.
Back to the challenge Seamus had presented him with. He Smirked, raising the bottle and taking a few hefty gulps before handing it back.
“Any hexes, jinxes or any form of harmful magic aimed towards another student will be punished with detention and expulsion. I will not tolerate any more harm done in this school.” She stared around the hall, glaring at the Gryffindors especially before looking to the new teachers.
“Oh Draco! You’re here too!” Lovegood said, sounding far too dreamy and happy for who she was greeting.
They spend some time together. Talking about useless stuff till deep into the night. Harry was quite open. Talking to him about how he felt lost on what to do after school and how traveling seemed like the only thing that felt right. They spoke of perhaps taking a trip to France with their friends, see the old remnants of wizarding society’s. and to this Disney thing that was supposed to be magic for muggles and everyone else.
“Oh I am. But house unity remember. I wouldn’t want to take an opportunity away from you. but I am willing to compromise. I’ll go with you.” Hermoine hummed, refilling her tea.
“Most definitely. Lets see if your gittish cooking has paid off.” He teased, grabbing their spreads.
“Of course the great Harry Potter knows how to ride bloody griffins. Is there anything you don’t know?”
It didn’t work. He was shoved into an empty classroom. Great. Day 2 and half the school was ready to take their frustrations out on him. About 5 other students. 7th years? 6th years? He couldn’t tell. It didn’t matter.
warning: Some stuff about the feelings of deserving abuse. obviously some physical abuse and talk of being hurt
Harry looked at Draco. He seemed determined. Grasping his wand. No pole to drag along this time, they would have to stick together by other means… so he reached out his magic as they ran. Draco looked at him confused for a second but latched on. This way they would stick together even through the thickening mist as they sprinted forward.
By the time noon rolled around he got into some tight muggle joggers and his favorite under armor turtleneck. Believe it or not. Even Malfoy’s wore muggle clothes when it came to sports.. the wizarding community hadn’t branched much beyond quidditch wear. Besides, muggle trainers were quite nice.. the foam? Felt like walking on clouds and it was a comfort no one was going to take away from him.
He got a muffled thank you as the other pulled the hoodie on, his hair a static mess as he pulled it over his head, making Harry reach out to fix it.
“Of ya go Potter.” Harry chuckled. Most of their interactions were like this nowadays. They were friendly. They would still spit insults but.. there was no heat behind them.
the cooking bit was inspired by a harringrove fic I'm currently reading called Lamp-bright rind by nagdabbit which has a lot of cooking in it and I'm honestly dead for the recipies in it. check it out if you're in for some lighthearted romance.
Neville and Blaise.. a very unlikely pair.. but they seemed to get along? A friendly nod between the two as they walked out. Not quite surprising there, Blaise could practically make everyone like him and Neville.. well he was brave, but quite simple minded. He had probably lapped up every lie Blaise had thrown his way..
He carefully danced with her, waiting for her to speak. She didn’t at first before she squeezed his hand lightly. “I never thanked you Draco.. for taking care of me in the manor. I know what they did to you when they found out. I should’ve come to your trail but I had to go to st mungo’s for a while after the war.” She suddenly sounded much more like an adult.
“Figured I should check up on my fellow pals.. we have quite the small group of Slytherins this year. We must stick together.” He smirked.
“Were starting with a small warm up. 2 rounds around the pitch and then straight back to here. If I catch any slack.. more pushups.” Draco groaned, Merlin this woman was dreadful. He reluctantly ran with the others. It went surprisingly well, it only had him panting slightly as he returned to his spot. He stole a glance at Blaise, who clearly had never ran for anything in his life. He already seemed like he was going to pass out. Leigh didn’t really take note of that though, making them go back to pushup stance as she continued her speech.
He split the vanilla pod, juiced the lemon and crushed the blueberries lightly in a large saucepan. Putting the fire on medium heat and dropping everything in.
“we certainly made a scene.” Draco commented quietly, noticing some people were pointing and staring at them still. “I’ll.. I should leave you to your friends. I’m certain Hermoine would love a dance with you.” he said, sipping his punch. The realization sinking in. he wasn’t supposed to have fun. Not with Harry potter of all people, that could ruin his reputation. He gave the other a forced smile. He’d enjoyed the dance and he wished they could continue talking but it would be bad for potter. He quickly turned on his heels to find Pansy. But was greeted by his cousin instead. Luna Lovegood.
“and I do not trust anyone to treat this case fairly. Auror, ministry, anyone. Please professor. Leave it.”
The drink tasted like a regular “Soda” that Hermoine had taken to introducing him to. He liked the think called coca cola, though he did wonder where said coca in this drink was.. it didn’t taste very chocolaty…
“Mr. Anderson here will be the head of your house this year. He will keep an eye on you. Manage the points given and taken.” She started. “You will not be playing Quidditch this year. But Mr Anderson has opted to teach you a sport the wizards in Denmark play, as well as an extra class on Nordic magic. Which, might I say, is very fascinating and a nice change. You will be able to take a NEWT for both these subjects.” Her eyes lingered a bit longer on the Slytherins. “I trust Professor Anderson to further explain matters.” With that she turned around, her robes flying after her.
He looked at the want. It looked nothing like his old one. It was longer. He picked it up. it felt uneasy.. he tried to cast a lumos. To which the wand simply flew out of his hand and back into the box. “Not that one then. I must say I am surprised. Unicorn wands are hard to change… lets try this.”
He waited for it to boil to turn down the fire to just make it simmer for about 30 minutes, skimming any skum forming on the top off and tossing it out. Making Potter sterilize two 500ml jars and put cooling spells on a plate. Around this time he also decided they needed some salted butter. Putting some heavy whipping cream in a jar and making it shake violently while he finished up his jam. He quickly let it strain itself and separated the buttermilk for perhaps a later date. He then added some coarse sea salt and stirred it. Putting a cooling charm over it and putting it aside.
Apparently “the others pick your drinks” meant “We decide awful combinations and Harry Pays for them”
Once they arrived at the great hall. all 8th years were appointed a new, smaller table in the back. Draco, Pansy and Blaise managed to get a spot on the far right end of it. As far away from any other classmates as they could… so far the 4 Hufflepuffs seemed to be alright with them. The 5 Ravenclaws were giving their usual curt nods, at least acknowledging their existence. Gryffindor, all 7 of them, shielded behind a wall of the other students were glaring daggers. Most of them at least from what Draco could tell in the quick glance he dared to shoot them.
He lost himself in his thoughts. Not noticing the time. “Potter. I can hear you thinking. For the love of merlin stop. You’re going to overheat.”
“Draco are you crying? It’s ok I.. it’s fine. I’ll always be nice to you if you’re worried about that.” he just nodded silently in reply, quietly wrapping his arms around harry.
He let his eyes linger for a moment longer than he should, he seemed more peaceful now than before the run. Draco found himself liking this look on Potters face. Flushing he turned away, shaking  his head slightly.
Memory’s of his father flooded his mind. There had been countless times his father had thrown him to the ground like that. his cane was black for a reason. Easier to hide the bloodstains. He inhaled sharply. Deciding it was best to take it as the first person jumped him, punching him in the face. Others soon joined, kicking him. He stayed silent. His mind switching between now and the past. One moment he saw the faint outline of some boy he remembered a Ravenclaw, punching him in the jaw. The other he saw his father, spitting on him, raising his want and uttering a crucio.
“I wouldn’t know.. I’m not my father.” Draco spoke, trying his best not to let his nerves show through… maybe he could defuse the situation.
He was last to pick up a silver bracelet. They were surprisingly heavy. He could feel the magic lingering on it.
He nodded to Blaise, who grinned at him. “I suppose I should change too then. I’ll see you at the ball. I’d wait for you but I’ve got a date for the night.” He hummed disappearing.
If it would work out, it would, no matter what. They were both strong and strong minded individuals. She’d dried his tears and promised to speak to Pansy to at least figure out If there was a chance.
He opened the window slightly, using the convenient stuck out bricks to get down. He was drunk, but his body knew what to do.
One of the elves. Pip. Had taken to Force Draco to eat. She also kept bringing him sleeping potions. God knows where she was getting them.
“But of course. What would mister Blaise like?” she asked, turning her attention to the other finally.
“Well yes Potter. Or do you not like fluffy bread?  We can make a blueberry jam in the meantime if there’s ingredients. Now off you go.” Draco smirked, glad he could show off a little for once.
Either way he did as told. Angry to admit that yes. The meditation had calmed him down significantly. And yes. He was feeling more evened out and perhaps ready to focus on finding his core.
Somehow his body managed to create just a tiny bit more of adrenaline. Using the same technique as before he got on the wall. Pulling Harry up once he was secure. Another shot…  Finnigan had let go while getting up. “We’re winning Potter. Lets get down.”
“I’ll explain later.” Harry smirked. Leading them through the damp tunnel into the shrieking manor. “Where to first?” Blaise asked, undoing one button too many of his dress shirt. He was after prey tonight, preferably a hot bartending witch.
“Of course. Its only fair.” Harry hummed in reply, flushing slightly by how deep he’d been lost in just staring at the other. he quickly got to cleaning. Doing it all by hand, which Draco found very inefficient but didn’t comment on. He simply watched as he went to make them some tea. He accio’d his secret stash of rooibos toffee tea and brewed some for them.
When he woke up he inhaled sharply. Bad dreams. Not nightmares but bad dreams nonetheless. Bad dreams that left a sense of uneasiness and discomfort in his body even now he was awake. He listened quietly for footsteps, the same ones with a slight limp he heard in the halls of the manor when Fenrir stalked up to his room for a session of taunting and torture. In his dream he hadn’t come in.. but kept stalking outside the door like a wolf waiting for its pray to get out of hiding, ready to grab him the second he’d lift the wards on the door. He opened his eyes, slowly returning to his senses. His pillow was wet, stained with tears and cold sweat. Perhaps he should note it as a nightmare.
“Not true Draco. I’ve got 3 main partners. 2 potentials and Pansy as a backup. Speaking off.  Offer still stands Malfoy.”
He hopped into the dorm, crouching when he heard hushed voices. “we searched the entire castle. Something must have happened.” It was Potter.
“Fair enough.. Say since I helped you right. Would you be willing to look over my potions essay. I’m lost.”
He ignored the stares, placing a hand on Harry’s hip and holding his other. he was glad he’d led Blaise before and was used to looking up to a partner. His grey eyes glinted slightly. Harry just looked into his eyes. “Don’t look down now Potter. Just follow me.” He shot him a smile, trying not to show he was nervous. This was the second time within a week that he was close to Potter. A bit too close. The music started and carefully he begun their waltz. wincing a little when Harry stood on his foot the first time. Soon enough though they found the Rhythm. Spinning around gracefully rather Daring when they picked up the speed. It was quite the sight to see for outsiders.  It was both elegant yet rough, a small battle broke out in which Potter took the lead, now leading Draco across the floor, glaring slightly at one another as Draco let himself be spun out and back into the others arms. Despite his reservations about it, he accepted the role, following Harry, adding more grace to the dance.
Potter grabbed the notebook, rustling though the pages. “a few weeks back. I had some bad dreams.. I take note of my dreams, its been a habit since.. It’s been a habit.” Draco couldn’t relax now.. he new exactly which nightmare. “.. I calmed down mid nightmare because of something. Something that’s been getting into our dorm. Last night when you were gone and I was.. panicking about it. It happened again, except I was fully conscious.” He paused for a moment as if thinking on how to word this correctly. He couldn’t seem to find the words. “… I know this is going to sound insane. But a literal tiger has been getting into our dorm. It seems to know when something is up or something. The first time I noticed all over my bed and clothes. But yesterday it came in. someone seemed to have hurt it. It left before I could get it looked at this morning but I believe it’s out there. And I was wondering if you could help me track it. It clearly needed help and it’s helped me…” Potter looked at him with sad puppy eyes and Draco couldn’t help but let out a relieved breath.
“They held me down in the dungeon. Father and Greyback. The dark lord told me it was my destiny. I was chosen to make up for fathers sins.” His knees felt wobbly.
“No buts. It’s fine. We get along now and that’s what matters.” Harry whispered, pulling back and rubbing his thumb over the others cheeks, wiping away the tears. “let’s get to the castle and then we’ll talk alright?”
“You know what.. let’s just do that.” Draco replied tiredly. Sitting up with a little groan and stretching out his arms above his head. only now noticing the hand on his leg. His eyes darted to it and Harry quickly pulled it off.
Hopefully that makes some sense. I was going to put Ron and Blaise together but I'm afraid that would end in death.
“Evening Lovegood.” He nodded to her. Turning to walk away, but she grabbed his arm. “Sit with us. The nargles will get you if you walk alone.” At least she never lost her weird talk.
“I’m fine. I talked to Luna and.. I don’t know. everything was a bit much and I needed a good rest. When did you get back?” small talk. Small talk was good.
“we need to talk.” Draco froze, he really didn’t want to talk about it more. He was tired and he felt that if Potter brought it up again he might tear up.
He was woken up by Pansy, who was gently stroking the hair out of his face. “Dray? Are you awake?” she asked, gently cupping his cheek.
“Better.” Draco mumbled in reply. Finally changing into his Pjs in the bathroom. When he got back, Harry was asleep. Not even under his covers. He pulled them over the other really quick before going to his own bed. Passing out as soon as his face hit the pillow.
He dusted himself off. Recollecting himself for a moment. “Now I do not wish to toot my own horn but I think I do deserve a drink. And I believe you’re going to make it.” Draco smirked at him.
“Just wai…” too late the other stormed in, jaw nearly dropping. “Way to ruin the surprise Potter” Draco muttered, stepping away from Hermoine who just beamed.
“Surely. How about we name her Amour. The French word for love. Make her sound a lot more lovely than she is.” Draco huffed.
The others egged him on. This was going to be a long night and… to be honest he was living for it. Perhaps this was what he needed a good night of drinking with new found alliances.
They stood on their usual spot. Draco behind him. He had given up on trying to take the lead. Harry was overall better at that, keeping in mind the others shortcomings, though he was starting to catch up more as they got into a routine.
He nodded quietly. “You shouldn’t have to thank me. I should have done more to get you out.” He whispered, his voice tight.
“Work together. Trust each other. Nothing in here can do any serious damage. Ready. Set. Go.” She cast a timing spell on them.
“It was him wasn’t it?” Draco asked softly, looking at Harry with soft eyes. The other just nodded in reply, taking the glass of water gladly as he sat up.
“It’s a small peace offering. You’re still doing tomorrow with me right? I’ve planned a run out for us. Blaise told me you are best bribed with Hot chocolate and these.” He tossed a small bag of chocolate frogs in into his lap. “I’m also supposed to tell you “I won’t bring up whatever happened to you Sunday evening. It is off limits and you have to respect that.” so I will.” He mocked Blaise slightly, making Draco smile ever so slightly.
Draco often silently joined them. Granger had proven to be quite forgiving and knowledgeable. He respected her. Though thanks to Pansy she had gotten a bit spicier and no one dared to go against her these days. It was her way or no way.
“Next time there will be spells fired towards you, creature will be simulated to jump you. take your time to get around todays parkour… 5 minutes to discuss a technique.” Anderson hummed, that man was far to excited. Getting up on his broom to watch over the field.
“What kind of backwards logic is that?” he chuckled, turning to look at Harry. He looked tired too. thankfully. That at least meant Draco wasn’t as out of shape as he felt.
“Just some tea darling. No sugar but a splash of milk would be nice.” Pip nodded. Immediately getting to it.
When his friends and Hermoine… well Hermoine was bit of his friend too now right? Left him, he felt drained again already. Potter hadn’t brought it up again, but did offer to bring him a hot chocolate for desert. He settled for that. Sitting against his headboard as he took the hot drink.
“Do you want to take it? And take a jar of jam too. it stays good for a long time and it makes a nice gift.” Draco hummed, packing away the jar they had taken Jam from. Harry gladly took the offer, putting the butter in two small jars. It really wasn’t a lot but it was nice enough to not let go to waste.
“Potter don’t overstep yourself here. I bloody hate anything that isn’t human.” Draco chuckled softly. “Let’s get up early though, will you set an alarm for 7am? I don’t want to make whatever this was my new sleeping schedule.”
“Back straight, heels down, hands low near the neck and elbows by your sides. As soon as she starts walking, follow the movement of the horse, don’t work against her.” Harry hummed.
Draco froze in place. Absolutely not, he had no intention of visiting madame Pomfrey again so soon. But then again. He couldn’t be losing his streak with their wins.. “Will you hold her like.. really do? I don’t want to fall..” he didn’t look away from Amour, she seemed to put some sort of spell on him, he felt the sudden tenseness ebb away. So that’s what they were mixed with huh.. unicorn. A magical race of horses the old wizards used to ride with before apperation was a thing.
For the 9th time this night Harry walked up. this time with something called snow white and the seven dwarves. Draco groaned as the concept was explained. It was a fairy tale about some princess.
He and the Weasley snuck up to the tree. Harry nodded to Ron. Who all of a sudden sprinted towards the other direction. The tree immediately began moving. Aiming towards Weasley while potter got to the roots of the tree, pressing his wand into a crevice. Just as the tree was about to “Whomp” Ron. It froze.
Tuesday was rather relaxing. The soreness was disappearing from his body and after Runes he was dragged to Pomphrey’s office by Blaise to get his eye fixed. After dinner he found himself in the common room. Reading one of the books his mother had send. It was a rather interesting muggle book the lord of the rings. About this very tiny dwarf like creature. It had no modern muggle appliances so he could follow it fairly well.
Next chapter will contain more angst and more anxiety. If you have any ideas or tips feel free to comment! they may be moderated but I always read the ones coming in. Thank you for reading and have a lovely day <3
Blaise continued his hideous accusations and banter when Pansy refused to be his out. Draco took it. He smiled.. Genuinely. He had only been here for a few days and Hogwarts was starting to feel the way it had when he was 11. Like home.
They did this for about thirty minutes. By the end Draco felt confident enough to ride by himself. and had some of the basics under control. They would try  galloping tomorrow since class was canceled.
Kingsley was looking behind them. Draco would turn around if he hadn’t been spelled in place.. or felt like he would faint if he made a wrong move. Perhaps he should have eaten what had been offered to him despite the spit on it.
“Pip. She..” be honest Draco. He wants you to trust him. It’ll make him happy. He wanted to make harry happy. “Pip taught me over the summer. Mostly how to make bread an some simple dishes though.” He said earnestly, starting to put away his toiletries. He felt a little embarrassed.
It really was true, working out had cleared his mind. He felt a lot better after it, even if he hadn’t liked it all that much.
“Me neither..” Draco uttered back. Not ready to admit he was growing quite out of breath. Another shot and Blaise and Neville were out. Blaise had slipped and let go of the pole. The only ones matching up to their speed were Finnigan and Thomas.
It was getting easier to talk to him. As long as he didn’t bring up anything difficult.. Malfoy seemed to shut down anytime he brought up anything more than a sports schedule. He had issues. And Harry was dying to figure them out.
“Kingsley. Let them go.” He knew that voice somewhere. “Narcissa and Draco both have shown heroic acts during the end of the war.” Oh.. Potter. The great savior was going to save him now? “Stop..” he muttered, but it went unnoticed.
“Try giving him these… I’ve got some extra’s and I’ll be making more soon once I get permission. If you mix em into his coffee he won’t even notice.” Draco muttered, pushing a few small vails into Harry’s hand. “Calming draught. It keeps stuff at bay. Don’t ask.” He said the last part a bit harsher than he meant, making Potter close his mouth again.
“So.. what do we do? I usually use one of those packets from the supermarket for bread.” Harry muttered.
When pip returned with their tea and a plate.. loaded with buns he let her have another hug. Smiling as she waved them off.
Draco grumbled. Couldn’t say no now huh.. he sighed, too a deep breath and brought the bottle back to his lips. Drinking as much as he could in one go… it took him three breaks before getting it. When he was done he felt ready too puke. This stuff was a bit too sweet to drink too much of in one go.
“It’s fine. They got their kick out of it. I’m sure they’ll be done with it for at least a while now.” Draco averted his eyes.
“Oh what?” Pansy hadn’t been following their conversation. But she was the perfect subject changer. “Me and Granger? She keeps offering me friendship. Its horrible. But she’s proven an alight help with homework. I guess.” Pansy shrugged. Going back to her conversation with Megan about Quidditch and how hideous of a game it really was.
For now though, he stood up, pushing Harry down onto his back. His purrs low and deep as he lay down next to him and propped his chin on the others chest, blinking at him the way all cats do when the respect and care for someone. His tail carefully placed over the others legs. He couldn’t speak.. but he tried to project it the best he could.. you’re loved… you’re cared for. Trust me. I’d know.
“You know you can call for me when stuff like this happens right? I’m your friend Draco. Always have been.. and seeing this. I don’t care for appearances if it means I can make sure you’re safe.”
“Longbottom and I have made a deal. I help him during potions. He helps me with Herbology. He hasn’t been that much of a pain in the ass. It’s about mutual respect really. The only problem is that he wont let me bring any sort of partner into the room. Even with silencing charm. So prude, Gryffindors.” He chuckled.
It held something alright. Or rather he was being held. He woke up to someone behind him, pulling him close, it was rather nice and warm and he leaned into it for a sec before remembering what had happened last night. “P..Potter?” he asked, heat rising to his cheeks.
It had been a long, rough process. The keeping a leaf in ones mouth for a month had been horrible combined with the fear of failing.
He closed his eyes and did as told. Trying to let his magic go. When nothing happened he dropped his hands. “I can’t Potter. My core is probably too dark it’s been ruined.” He whispered. He hadn’t meant to say that last part. Nor had he meant to sound so emotional when saying it.
He decided to simple grab the glass and filled it with the replenishing spell. It slowly filled the glass but it was better than nothing.
I always Picture Draco as someone that either cooked really well because he's into potions but might stick to the recipe a bit too close and Harry as someone that can cook but experiments too much and has zero patience. hence they would work well together.
“Harry? Wake up please.. you’ve had a nightmare.” He whispered softly. Watching the other stir awake. He still looked like shit. But at least he was actually awake. He gasped slightly, grabbing at his throat.
Draco rolled his eyes. Simply walking over to the bed his trunk was sat in front of, putting up a ward and grabbing his toiletries. Ignoring would be the best course of action. Fuck whatever contract they had been tricked into. Potter could go ahead and fend the fuck for himself.
Draco nearly lost his balance. Grasping the saddle. He remembered what harry told him. Right.. Watch the right leg.. soon he found a rhythm. Missing the beat just a few times as Amour trotted around Harry.
“Nothing to be sorry about potter. You would do the same for me.” He whispered, unable to stop a single tear strolling down his cheek. Fuck it. He hated seeing the guy that had been so strong this whole time, the man that had saved the world, that had saved his life more than once, broken and beaten down like this. He didn’t deserve this. He deserved so much better. He felt privileged to be allowed to help him. To care for him for once and here this stupid motherfucker was apologizing for needing help.
Monday turned out to be horrible. A full day of classes and teachers who found it a great idea to make their students drown in homework from day one. Potions brought them an essay on the importance of newt eyes in luck potions. Charms class turned into a sobbing hour. Where they all brought up happy memories from the past, but due to no work being done in class they would have to practice visualization charms by themselves, an ocean in a bottle was to be delivered by Friday. Muggle studies, a class that everyone had to take this year, was the only class that seemed fun. Well it was fun unless you had seen the last muggle studies teacher being murdered and eaten right in front of you almost a year back.
“Fair enough. We’ll follow your plan chosen one.” He grumbled. He had to add an insult. He couldn’t outright admit that Potter had him figured out AND made a half decent plan.
So they did. Pansy looked like she had gotten even less sleep than Finch. “She talked my ears off. She talked about the power of unity and friendship and all that FAIRY BULLSHIT.” She took a heated angry breath. “Who thought this was a good idea. I didn’t even talk to her. She has planned study meetings with me for the coming month. We don’t even know our classes.” Great. Another friend in distress. Perhaps Draco should stash some sleeping draught for his friends too.
“Certainly. Mind you I expected to break an ankle and spending the rest of Samhain in the hospital wing with Pomfrey.” Draco quipped.
The Parvati twins had been put together. For twins they had had quite the shouting match before going to sleep.
“Perhaps we should try getting a saddle on her today? I’ll hold her while you get used to the feel?” Potter offered. “I mean we should have started already, the others have and well be walking around either way..”
Draco stared at him blankly before bursting into laughter. He had been taunted the last few weeks. He had been telling himself he was too dark of a wizard. His core was too broken and damaged to ever recover and create something as pure as core magic. The stress and worry disappearing as he looked at the flame. He took his hands away from the other, studying the flame. “I’m not fucking broken am I?” he uttered under his breath. Forgetting he had been pissed about even having to try and smiling brightly. Genuinely.
He smiled at her. “I suppose we should.. How many curses have you had thrown at you so far?” he tried. Making her grin.
By the time he had showered and gotten into his sleepwear potter seemed to have gotten the same idea, the curtains closed and what seemed to be a strong shielding charm. As if Draco would dare to hex him.
He froze when the other patted his back, letting out a surprised little purr. He looked at the others face. Harry wasn’t awake… just patting in his sleep.
They laughed. It was rather comfortable. Weasley was after all quite funny when he wasn’t at your throat. They stayed for a bit longer before Harry excused them
I spend like an hour researching waltz and theres this one on yt called waltz nr2 wedding dance out youtube and its honestly what i picture harry and Draco dancing too
They quickly got to work. Everyone else was too. Seamus managed to fuck up by using a second rising spell, the dough exploding everywhere. Hermoine and pansy’s station was a flour covered mess. Lisa and Megan were avoiding rising spells all together. They had started on a butter recipe during their first rise.
“True.. Gra.. Hermoine why don’t you?” he had started using her first name just last week. He was still getting used to it. She smiled friendly in reply.
“Sure.” Draco snorted. Stiffly getting out of bed and stretching himself out. The man was like a cat in the mornings. Stretching and yawning for a good few minutes before moving on. When the others gaze finally turned to him. His eyes widened.
Aside from only Neville seemed to have produced another element, a globe containing a wild and unruly ocean. Glancing around the room he saw some of the other students being incredibly frustrated. Trying to make it work. Pansy was sitting down again already. She gave up far too easy. Draco was grumbling next to him.
“Oh don’t you worry. I’m grateful.” She smiled at him, letting Draco spin her around and fall back into his arms. “I always knew you were good, the wrackspurts were always around you, they made your brain fuzzy but I knew you wanted to be good.” She poked his nose playfully.  It made him smile for some reason. He regretted not befriending her before everything. He had been a prick before of course but… despite her tendencies.. she was kind. She was probably what he would have needed.
“So this one is about you right.. Dancing queen. What we do is.. two steps forward. Lean in. shake your shoulders. Two steps back, tilt back and shake em shoulders.” Was all he caught as the song began playing. He just let Harry lead. Laughing his ass off. They even managed a spin. Though he had to be caught, stumbling on his own feet.
“Sort of. Except you stand and sit in the saddle. Keep your ankles still. The movement comes from your hips and knees.. were going left side in first. So I want you to stand up when the right leg goes forward.” Harry spelled the lead longer. Letting the horse walk away from him and letting it turn left.
He was shaken out of his thoughts by a steaming mug and a plate full of cookies. “bout time Potter.”
She hummed in response, nuzzling into his side. “I might. I don’t know why they send us back… do they want us dead? Or are they planning on blaming the first best incident on us to send us to Azkaban either way?” Pansy hissed, silent enough for no one else to pick up on it.
Reluctantly however he let Harry drag him out to the field for a run. They went for a rather intense workout. Plopping down in the wet morning grass beside the lake near the end of it. They’d done everything in silence aside from the occasional exercise switch.
Speaking off the devil. Weasley came in. He and Rivers looked like they had taken a swim in the mudpuddle. He looked away, but caught their conversation.
He got into bed. This year was going to be miserable. Death was starting to sound a lot better the longer he was here.
It was a few weeks later. Classes had continued and Draco felt himself drowning in his schedule. Between the runs with Potter, which had been making him feel a lot fitter and distracted him from his thoughts, homework and classes he found himself to have very little time to relax and focus on himself.
The next morning he awoke to the sound of someone emptying the contents of their stomach. He sat up.. too fast. His head was spinning. He wasn’t much of a puking guy. He got headaches and a terrible mood.
“Lucky me.” Draco rolled his eyes. Watching the others leave for breakfast. “You really wanna grab breakfast? I’m not exactly thrilled to have to sit with these assholes either.”
It was a Thursday night almost two weeks after they baking class when he woke up to Harry nearly screaming next to him. Alarmed he rushed to his side. “Harry? Harry whats wrong?” he asked immediately, quite panicked. The other was drenched in sweat. Gasping for air and pulling at his clothes. Draco cast a quick mufilato and a locking spell on the door. He sighed. He knew he couldn’t wake Harry up. not when he was this far gone. Instead he went to his usual tactic.  If Harry were to turn violent the cat could get away easier and it definitely could take more.
“Decide to stay miss?” Draco asked with a raised brow. She paled a little, clearly having said something she perhaps wasn’t meant to say.
He felt the others magic lap at his. He let it connect. Nothing happened for a moment before his own hands started warming. He felt it. A scream building up, ready to explode. A burst of laughter threatening to leave his throat. A blue flame appeared. It was almost unbearably hot. He looked at Harry with wide eyes, finding him grinning. “Anderson warned me that might happen.. our core’s are the same. Together we create hellfire.”
“Good job! You’re a natural!” he sounded so genuine, Draco couldn’t help but feel accomplished, smiling at the other.
Before them appeared the parkour. It reminded Draco of the Auror parkours he had visited as a child in charm school. Poles to hop over, a crawling part. There were a few jumps over a rather muddy bit of water, a climbing wall.. it was bloody awful. He began to regret skipping lunch as his stomach turned.
“what can I say mate. I’m very convincing when I want something.” Harry hummed, carelessly opening the bottle and bringing it to his lips. Taking a sip before handing it to Draco. “You do have talent for it Draco. You were almost as good as me.”
“Lost it I think.” He snickered. “Trust fall potter.” He said, way to loud as he let himself fall backwards from the bench, right into Potters hands. “Caught me, good reflex” he commented, not getting up and leaning against the other.
Leigh hummed, she had been walking through the classroom and checking in on everyone. She had avoided the two boy’s so far seeing their deadly focus on it.
“I saw it yeah. It came up to me when I got up but I let him out. You were right. There is an actual leopard going around the school.” He smiled gently, finding he didn’t need to force himself to do so. He felt far more open with Harry. He didn’t know what had happened during their dance but he felt closer. More intimate and at ease. The others words later had done nothing but strengthen this feeling.
“Don’t ever apologize for needing help Harry.. I… I promise I’ll be there for you alright? I might not be perfect. I might not be a fantastic help but I’ll do whatever I can.” His voice was determined. Steady.
Draco nodded numbly. He took a moment before following the traces of magic leading him to a room. It was on the far right side, possible lake view… perfect.
He wasn’t disappointed when his mother didn’t come out to his new wand or talk to him about his day. She had bigger problems. Pip came out to bring him a chocolate milk and some of his own baked bread. Smiled when he complimented todays outfit.. a thick wooly sweater. Clearly hand knitted by a first time knitter, judging by the holes. And then left him be.
Kneed until the dough is elastic before adding the sunflower seeds. Coat a bowl with olive oil, put the bread in and make sure all sides are covered in a bit of oil. Cover and let rise for an hour. Or use the rising spell pip taught you.
Proudly they waited for her to walk into Draco’s dorm to look over the final result. They really did out achieve themselves.  She was absolutely looking like the pretty and strong woman she was. She flushed as they complimented her.
He leaned close to the book, hiding his face behind it almost. Nearly jumping out of his skin when he felt the armrest he was leaning on dented in. he glared up at the culprit. Potter.
It was a rather cold Saturday evening at the start of october when Draco finally found himself able to take some rest. Reading by the fire. Today’s book was called IT. He couldn’t supress the nasty shivers the book send down his spine every once in a while. Whatever this Clown creature was. He was hoping to avoid ever coming across it.
“Today is an exercise to prepare you for the sport you’ll eventually be playing. Right now I just need you lot to start getting Physically fitter. Get out some of that pent up energy from all summer. I’m honestly surprised you don’t have a P.E. class.” She shook her head. Looking over them.
I'm rather liking taking the pressure off and just uploading chapters when I feel with whatever word count I feel (I usually aim for around 5000/6000 words and just haven't been able to hit it. it was taking the joy out of it for me)
“I’m trying Potter.” He hissed in reply, trying to ignore the way his stomach flipped. What was happening. Why did Harry have to talk so hushed.
Draco reluctantly opened his eyes, looking around the room. It was the same group as Thursday morning standing around his bed. All looking rather worried. He rubbed his eyes softly, scooting to sit himself up.
“it was the graveyard again. Where he came back..” potter.. no Harry croaked. Draco nodded, taking the glass from him and carefully sitting down on the bed with him, not next to him but close enough to put an arm on the others arm. Trying to ground him as he still looked a little out of it.
Blaise snorted in reply. “I don’t know Draco. You seem to like him dragging you around fine enough all the other times.” He hummed, earning himself an elbow to the gut.
Draco stared into Harry’s eyes, he’d lost his nerves from earlier and now he was leading there were no more foot crushing incidents. He looked strong, like the way he had looked when he taught Draco how to ride horses, or when he was doing something to help others.. it was a look Draco was growing fond of, very fond.
He found his paws leading him into his dorm, three of them anyway, the frightened jump from earlier seemed to have shifted his bone somehow and the pain was worse. He limped into the room, dazed eyes looking up at potter who was staring at the door.
Blaise had left his side to talk to Weasley about something and Draco found himself in a discussion about Defense and how they should be doing more advanced stuff really.
“Seems like you’ve come in the right time.. my roommates missing, I’m afraid something’s happened to him. Will you keep me company again? I’ll take you to Luna tomorrow. She’ll know what to do about that paw.” Potter muttered, patting on the bed beside him before he realized Draco couldn’t jump up there. He carefully helped him up there. Laying down and very carefully stroking the literal leopard. Not questioning the fact it was a literal leopard, it nearly made Draco raise a brow. But his mind was too foggy to care. He just flopped onto his left side, curling his tail around himself and taking the tip in his mouth. Holding it in place.. before he knew it he fell asleep. Save and sound in Potters arms. He faintly heard him mutter about not wanting to lose another person.
“See this is exactly why I asked you. You’re logical about it. Let’s do that then.” Harry seemed pleased with his answer. He took another look at the picture before handing it back. Taking a few good swigs of his chocolate milk, noting the hint of cinnamon. Potter had some serious skills when it came too cooking at least.
“Do you think he’s doing ok? I’m a little worried for him.” Harry muttered, pointing to the sleeping form on the other bed. Draco responded with a croaky mew. Making Harry chuckle softly. “You’re right. He’d tell me if something was up. I think he’s starting to trust me.” There came the pats. Draco happily accepted them, bumping his head up into his hand and  wrapping his tail around the others waist, letting the cat take over a little as he lay down over the others lap. He was about the size of a Labrador, just really long, he shouldn’t be too heavy. Not like this anyway.
“Do you think I’m happy to be here? Being stared at? Fearing for my life?! Just get it on with then prat. Do it. Show your little friends you’ve got a pair and then leave it.” He lost control of his voice. He was seething with anger. The spell was recast over him and he dropped his head back down. All he could do now was close his eyes and relax his features. Refuse them the satisfaction of seeing any hurt on his face.
Once the class was dismissed he stopped Draco in the hall. He would have to ask him now or it would be too late. “we’re going to Hogsmeade tonight. Most of the 8 years are going. I’ve been meaning to ask you to come too. so like.. if you want too.” he tried to sound cool about it. Looking at Malfoy who was raising a brow.
“Oh shoo. We should be fine. Just don’t you know.. act like a git.” Harry hummed, walking up to the animal, carefully patting its head. The horse seemed rather friendly, pushing its nose against his hand. “Come here.” He motioned for him, taking his wrist. Draco didn’t struggle, but he did stand as far away as he could. Letting Harry bring has hand up to the horses cheek. “See… you’re fine. Just pat her.”
“Potter. There was nothing more I wanted than to die in sixth year.. I.. I thanked you on that floor as I was bleeding out. Nearly cursed you when I woke up again because I did. It’s fine… let’s talk about it when I’m not drunk.” The other pulled his shoulder, turning him back around.
He was pulled in by his right arm, right into Harry’s chest. When had the git grown a head taller than him?! He grumbled lightly. That was until, Potter forced him to move his hips. He couldn’t help but burst out in laughter. What the fuck was he doing.
“I wouldn’t do that death eater. I’ll have you put right into Azkaban.” An unfamiliar voice said from behind him.
Dinner was good. But he felt absolutely battered right after. Excusing himself from desert and making his way back to the dorms. He nearly stumbled over his own feat. He couldn’t have caught it in time.. the hex thrown at his back.
Next to him Harry hummed. “Absolutely perfect. 10/10 want another slice.” He commented. Closing his eyes as he took another bite.
“Furthermore I would like to introduce a few new teachers this year… Professor Slughorn will continue his position as potions teacher and will be head of Slytherin… Professor Anderson will take on muggle studies and Professor Leigh will take over the Defense of the dark arts and will be the head of Gryffindor. I myself will continue my Charms classes.” She pointed to the two new teachers. Anderson, a tree of a man with long blonde hair braided back. A beard and a pair of piercing, scary blue eyes. Leigh, a short middle aged lady with the biggest grin. Brown curls in a tight ponytail. They looked like they should be teaching the others subject.
Put it all in a bowl, mix the dry ingredients first before adding the water. Mix by hand or by wand.
Unfortunately he wasn’t too in tune with the cat and when he got head scratches.. he purred. Rather loudly too. Fortunately the only affect this had on Harry, was evening his breathing out further and taking him out of whatever nightmare he had. All Draco had to do. Was make sure he turned back before Potter noticed he was ever here.
“So, as you might’ve noticed I am not from here. I may not be as educated on what you have been through. But I do know how to deal with warriors. And the bunch of ye clearly are. Lets try and make this year the best we can yeah? You will all share a common room. Let’s go up there. I’ll explain how the rooming system will work this year. McGonagall asked me for a very specific reason.” The man sounded a lot more friendly than he looked..
“Seems like you lot were right.. What happened to you mr Malfoy?” she asked a bit harsher than probably meant. He flinched at his own name.
“I never thought I’d see the day a Malfoy would dance like that. You got him good harry.” Ron snickered. “a truly magnificent sight to see. Worth the money.” He signed a bartender over to get him a bottle of whiskey. Paying for it before handing it over.
A slow guitar started playing. Draco didn’t recognize it. He wasn’t all to familiar with muggle music. ‘you are… my fire.’
They split up in two groups. Boys and girls. Surprisingly there was an even split between the 20 of them. “You will take up a band. I will give you the blessing and the band will draw you to a room. There you will wait to meet your roommate. Understood?” Anderson sounded rather firm. But he seemed excited. “Please do be mindful. This ritual is very important in our culture. Its one of passing into adulthood. One of growing up and leaving your younger selves behind. Each of you will receive a band and a role for the sports team, which I am happy to announce you will all be partaking in to let out some steam… now let us begin..”
“It’s a nice tree if you know. once you calm it down.” Harry snorted, looking over the group that had now gathered in front of the tree.
He got his potion from a reluctant Pomphrey, Potter got his cut healed and the two of them were scolded out of the hospital wing for dragging a mess in.
He grunted. She was right. He was rather calm today. He felt rather alright for once despite the little sleep.
She scoffed. “Do not lie to me boy. Come in. your friends are worried sick.” She pulled him in, or at least tried too. she took his right arm and he yelled out. She paled. “Did they break your arm? Mr Malfoy who did this.”
He fell asleep on the sofa, without a potion this time. Dreaming nice dreams. And only waking up the next morning.
He didn’t know when he had.. but he did eventually fall asleep. Keeping his promise and staying with the other. not caring about what the morning would hold.
When the dough has doubled in size, start forming the bread in the shape you’d like, after let it rest for another hour under a warming spell. Do not use the rising spell this time. If you fuck up you have to start over.
When he finally woke up again his vision was clear. His mind was clearer too. though he did feel a faint buzz.. that probably had to do with any numbing potions he’d been given. He looked a his fingers. He could stretch them again. That was a relief. He groaned slightly, looking around the room. It was dark again.. he must’ve been in a bad state huh. Now if he could just silently make his way to his dorm…
Instead he carefully ran his hands through the others hair, pushing it back into place. Harry was propped on his chest but over time he could see the others furrowed brown relax. His breathing steady and slow. His arms squeezing around his waist. He smiled softly. Thankful he had been able to help the other.
He heard muttering around him… and then the loud slamming of a door. He dared a look to his side. His father was under a silencing charm but the man was screaming at him in panic. His wild eyes making Draco flinch yet again.
Harry greeted him groggily. “You happen to have Hangover potion.” He muttered, wiping his mouth, he looked horrible.
Grumbling Draco got down. His muscles already complaining at pushup number 5.. and something told him this was only the first of many sets they were going to do.
“I honestly don’t know lets just try to stay out of trouble.. I’ve already had a run in with the Gryffindor golden team. I’d rather try to avoid that.” he sighed. Playing with her hair.
She carefully placed the bow on her left ear. He fixed it when it was a little crooked. “There you go. It should change color when you put on a different dress. It’ll always match. I wish I could’ve given you something better. But I know you wouldn’t have accepted it.” Pip nodded. She had tears in her eyes. “Thank you master Draco.”
“I did not.” He croaked. Taking a sharp breath ready to be hit with a curse. He felt unable to lie.. veritaserum.. perhaps that was why the water had tasted so good.
He looked over his own neat and loopy handwriting. “It shouldn’t be took hard. We can add pumpkin seeds too if you’d like can you gather the ingredients?” he asked harry, who looked a bit stunned.
“It’s ok Hermoine, I’ll live through this.” His gaze landed on Potter who had his hands balled in fists. “I’m sorry for messing up the training schedule.. I’m sure I’ll be back up tomorrow.” He tried to smile.
“Weasley and Rivers. You can thank those two for the following. When I said line up behind the poles I meant in peace. Everyone down!” Rivers and Weasley were pushing to stand up front… how childish.
He barely registered what Kingsley Shacklebolt said. Naming the accusations and cases against them. he felt his sleeve being pulled up. revealing that horrible mark on his arm.. it was bleeding again. In his nightmares.. he would scratch it, one time he’d found a bite mark on it and tasted blood. He flinched when whoever was revealing it pushed his finger on it. He heard his mother speak. A yell from his father which made him flinch back before he heard what sounded like a silencing charm.
“Your breathing is too loud potter. I can hear you from over here.” He complained. He always had to complain.
“So. Have you picked out a dress yet Hermoine?” he asked casually. “You’ve got someone to impress further. I remember Weasley’s jaw dropping in fourth year. We have to surpass that.” Draco hummed, putting some of the rather nice looking salmon and steamed veggies on his plate.
By the time they came home, just in time before the ministry would be set on his ass, he was drained. Dropping down on the brand new, yellow loveseat the elves had deemed perfect. Groaning softly.
“So you’re also paired up with one of the golden trio. Seems like we both got unlucky.” Draco huffed.
“Defensive much?” Draco just grumbled in reply. Rolling to his side so he was looking away from Blaise. His eyes automatically landing on Harry. Whom always seemed to look better after sports. He had a new level of energy. He seemed calmer and more powerful when he’d exercised. Like he’d put his thoughts in order and could face the day.. perhaps he should ask him if they should move their runs to be in the morning.. as much as that would pain him..
When it came time to making the jam Draco wrote down the ingredients for Harry to gather. Cleaning up their work station with some simple spells. He’d gotten quite efficient at those over summer.
They walked to their dorm in a rather comfortable silence. No one else was back yet and Potter decided he could use Weasleys shower.
“Now. Three seconds in. 5 seconds out. Listen to my breaths alright. You can squeeze my hands. If you start feeling too panicked.. you can tell me. I’m here.” He forced himself to keep meeting the others gaze. Harry still looked panicked, but did as told, following his breathing. The squeezing on his hands became less and after a few minutes his shoulders relaxed again. “better?” he asked quietly.
Draco deemed her a friend at this point. He had apologized to her a while ago. Instead of accepting it. She had pulled him into a hug. Told him that him showing interest and willingness to learn was enough. She was bright. Truly deserving of her title as brightest witch of their age. She was fair and honest. A bit straightforward at times but.. she was good. Nice to hang out with.
Realizing he hadn’t replied nor taken her outstretched  hand as his thoughts ran he coughed awkwardly.
“That elf is scarily like you Dray.” Hermoine muttered, bumping him as she made her way over to the table.
Things were happy the coming week. No one had bothered him much. He’d been called a certain gay slur a few times for dancing with Harry Potter out of all people but.. Potter himself had shut that down quite quickly.
He got back to the task at hand. He wondered where all the bread went. They made three breads everyday for the last week. He knew the elves for one didn’t eat bread, it messed up their digestive system and he and his mum never ate that much anyway.. he decided not to question it.
“I snore? Potter… you invented snoring. It’s like you’re chopping down the forbidden forest every night.”
Pansy said nothing, shoving a plate into his hands. “Eat darling. Everyone is just worried.. do you really not know who did it?”
After an afternoon of shopping and fun they finally turned back, the three of them all satisfied and carrying bags of new outfits and other stuff.
Something was different the next morning. Draco had done his usual get out before dawn and get back into your own bed after a nice shower. Despite yesterday being quite difficult he felt well rested and ready to face today.
Draco stared him. “It’s alright. I’ll get through this.” His smile slowly faded again. “Don’t worry… I don’t want to be a burden any more than I’ve already been… what have I missed in class?” he changed the subject rapidly to which Pansy, Blaise and Hermoine began filling him in on everything, including notes and homework.
“What are you doing here buddy? Are you alright?” why was his voice so shaky?  who cared, he looked at the hand Harry reached out… was he offering pats? Pats seemed nice.
Without hesitation he hopped up on the bed, purring loudly at the other. It seemingly made Harry jump.
“I promise.. I told you last night right? I’m keeping you safe.” He didn’t sound hurt by Draco’s need of reaffirmation of it, instead putting a hand on his shoulder and squeezing gently. “Let’s start with simply brushing her and getting her ready.” He hummed.
“Oh shoo. You’’ll be fine. You’ve got good old Potter as a guard dog.” Blaise chuckled, playing with Draco’s hair.
So here he was. Dressed in what Blaise had called “Jeans, try them they fit nicely”. They were uncomfortable. He already had a great dislike for the stiff fabric. But one look in the mirror told them that they did indeed fit great. Did wonders for his ass really.
Before taking a second to think about it and sounding far to eager. He replied. “Sure. But you’ll owe me a dance.” Instead of clasping his hand in front of his mouth and beating himself up mentally. He smirked. “Unless you’re afraid to embarrass yourself.”
He didn’t remember much of last night. He knew he danced with Potter for a bet. Which apparently they won, judging by the almost empty bottle of fire whiskey. He remembered some of the serious talk they had. But not much.
