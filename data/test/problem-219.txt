“I agree! These are very delicious,” Harry says, biting into a chocolate éclair. He moans and begins to lick the excess cream off of his fingers.
“Draco, you’re home! Ron said you were on assignment and I didn’t expect you to be home this early.”
“Harry,” a voice calls out in front of him. For a second he thinks it’s Malfoy because of the blond hair, but then he smells the perfume that Luna favours and he relaxes a bit.
Draco laughs. “My father, at best, will behave, and at worst, will ignore you. That shouldn’t be too much trouble.”
Harry’s eyes widen in shock. He’s never heard Dudley admit to anything being his fault, not if it meant Harry would get in trouble.
“I know it isn’t true!” Harry interrupted, taking off his glasses to clean them. “Don’t you think that I know that you are not capable of doing that, not anymore.” Without his glasses he looked vulnerable and Draco had to squash down the urge to place a hand on his shoulder to comfort him.
“Is this an owl pellet?” he finally asks. It’s the closest thing he can think of on such short notice.
Harry takes a chance and stands right next to Malfoy, bumping shoulders with him. “Tell me if I’m wrong, but I think the only reason you objected to me kissing you was because I was still with Charlie, right?”
“Yes, it’s a recent development,” Harry says in a neutral tone as if he were just discussing the weather. Maybe if Harry keeps his voice low and bored, Ron will lose interest and talk about something more exciting, like Quidditch. It doesn’t seem likely, however, because the breakup is the biggest thing to happen to Harry all year.
“What?” Pansy’s eyes widen in surprise. From the bed, Pansy glances in Harry’s direction. She can’t see his expression of shock, or the way his hand automatically goes to his pocket when he hears Draco’s words. His hands brush against the small black box that holds a simple golden engagement ring. He had planned on proposing tonight during dessert.
Cradling an arm around Draco’s neck and placing the other arm underneath his knees, Harry lifts Draco’s warm body against his and makes the journey back to their bedroom. Draco’s hair tickles Harry’s nose and instead of Draco’s usual citrus and vanilla shampoo, Harry smells the woodsy shampoo he himself favours. He falters in his steps, which causes Draco’s head to roll away from his chest.
“I don’t,” Harry says. He reaches up to comb through Draco’s silky hair. “Do you know you still have confetti in your hair?”
“Well, I really do appreciate it,” Draco says, kissing Harry. They break apart when Harry’s stomach growls. “Let’s eat and then we’ll figure something out. I won’t let your thoughtful gift be ruined.”
Memories overwhelm Harry at the mere mention of the name. Harry remembers a large blond boy laughing as he dropped Harry’s food to the floor; remembers Dudley ordering his friends to hold Harry down as he punches him; remembers dragging a shocked Dudley to Number 4, Privet Drive after a dementor almost Kissed them.
Although Harry was expecting to hear that, it was still a punch to the gut. He had been friends with Ron and Hermione for so long that he couldn’t imagine them being apart for the rest of his life.
“Daisy takes after her mother and loves to read. She was sitting on the sofa in the living room and I was trying to read her a bedtime story because she was sick with a fever. She didn’t like what I was reading, so she held out her arms and a book came floating over to her.”
Draco closes his eyes and bites the inside of his cheeks to keep from pushing Harry against a door and snogging him senseless. Sometimes Harry did innocent things without realizing how it affected Draco and now is not a good time to start dwelling on taking Harry to bed.
Draco felt a drop of unease start to grow in the pit of his stomach. “Harry, whatever I have done in the past, I would never use dark spells against you. I wouldn’t risk Azkaban for something as stupid as this.”
“The Christmas dinner is casual. You’ve seen the Weasleys. Aside from that one son who works at the Ministry, who else wears fancy clothes? If I show up in something ridiculously overpriced, they’ll get the wrong idea that I’m still that snooty pure-blood from Hogwarts.”
“Ron says you broke up with Charlie,” Hermione says. “I just wanted to know if everything turned out well.”
“No. Let me ask you several questions that might be on the exam tomorrow. If you get them right, then I’ll choose what you do for the rest of the evening.”
“Yes. Maybe? I don’t know.” Harry stared at her helplessly. Sometimes it was all he could think about at night. Once Harry returned, could they start out with a true relationship, with dates and introducing themselves as a couple to friends and family? Harry would like to think so, but he wasn’t so sure. He was always tempted to ask about it in the postcards he sent to Draco. At last count, it had been forty-six postcards sent in three months. But Harry cherished each and every one of them and kept them locked up to read and reflect on whenever he felt lonely.
“Draco what are you doing?” Pansy says, crossing her arms and beginning to shiver. Their Heating Charms faded in the cab and they couldn’t renew them in front of the Muggles.
“Yes, I’m a Hit-Wizard. My specialty is bringing in Dark wizards, especially the Death Eaters still on the loose. Do you remember Voldemort?”
“Not likely,” Draco says, but before he has a chance to open his eyes, a handkerchief is already wrapping around head, courtesy of Harry’s wandless magic.
“We won’t need that,” Pansy says. “I would bet my entire fortune that he’s at my flat in Paris. It’s his place to go when he needs space from everything happening in London.”
The boxes threatened to fall as soon as the door opened and it took a quick spell to keep them balanced. Draco flicked his wand and had the boxes trail him back into the living room. He rekindled the fire and turned on the wireless, before sitting on the sofa and trying to see where he could start. At least the boxes were already labeled with Harry’s messy handwriting.
sign on the door would have sufficed if you can’t ward the greenhouse,” Harry says as he Vanishes the dirt. He puts pressure on his left foot and thankfully feels no pain.
“Hey, don’t be nervous,” Harry says, setting down a cup of tea and a large plate with several pieces of dessert on the table. “It’s only George and Ron and they like you.”
“Right,” Dudley says, pausing as if he has many questions to ask Harry and doesn’t know where to start. “Let’s go to Julia’s office,” Dudley says instead. “I don’t want Daisy to interrupt us.”
“Well, a dove is just a white pigeon and we all know you are terrified of them. At least that’s what Rita Skeeter’s trusted sources are saying.”
Draco’s lips are pressed in a thin line as he mulls over Harry’s words. “Alright, but I’m going to make us some tea before we decide to do anything rash.”
Draco smoothed out the creases on the newspaper. The entire top half featured a grainy photograph of Draco, recognised by his white-blond hair, coming out of a pub and following someone into a dark alley. From the way he was stumbling and clutching brick building, he had had more than enough to drink. Draco didn’t even need to view the remainder of the loop to know that it had resulted in him getting a blow job.
“Family means everything to Harry and since you’re the only ones he has left, I thought it would be proper to ask you for his hand in marriage.”
“Being in love looks good on you, Harry. If you ever have kids, he’d make a great father,” Dudley says, pointing at where Draco is carrying Daisy as she shakes the plastic bottle and lets it go. The mixture bubbles in the plastic bottle before it flies high above their heads and Draco falls back onto the grass in shock.
Immediately, Draco’s eyes grow cold. He’s heard all about Harry’s Muggle family and every time Harry has nightmares about the cupboard under the stairs, Draco has to be reminded that Harry doesn’t need to get revenge.
Well, for Draco at least. He hadn’t been telling the truth when he had cast the spell on Vernon Dursley, but the fool didn’t need to know that. Vernon would have severe heartburn for the rest of his life, enough to question if he was having a heart attack, if he ever thought about Harry.
However, Draco shouldn’t have worried about Harry’s reaction. When he finally gathers the courage to look up, Harry wears his heart on his sleeve. There’s an abundance of emotions flitting across his face as he makes his way to the sofa. Draco’s heart quickens when he realises the most prominent one is hope.
startles Draco and he looks over at the closet entrance. Harry’s older cat, Holly, stares unblinkingly at him, her orange fur standing on end. She leaps up at him, sinking her claws into the jumper.
in the centre. Attached to it is a ball of yarn and knitting needles, and Draco realises that it looks like a Weasley jumper.
So he had to settle by going every now and then to nightclubs, trying not to rationalise why he always seemed to pull someone who had dark hair and bright eyes. Even when he had moved into Grimmauld Place so that he could work on the books in that library, Draco hadn’t let himself hope that something could start.
Harry spins around and gives him the biggest smile anyone has ever directed at Draco since the war’s end. Draco’s breath catches and he can only stare at Harry as he heart beats rapidly, almost trying to escape his chest. He licks his dry lips and feels Harry’s gaze following the movement.
“Merlin, no! Why would you think that? Are you exhausted? Has all the revising done things to your mind? Should you be admitted to the Janus Thickey ward?” Harry manages to say. “The item you’re holding should help you on your exam tomorrow.”
Outside in the sunlight and fresh air, surrounded by people on the pavement, Vernon tries to rationalize the experience. It must be Draco, because Vernon had been feeling perfectly all right until they had locked eyes. Now that he thinks about it, the man is not handsome, but rather
“Thank you, Harry,” Draco interrupts, his breath tickling Harry’s ear. “It’s perfect.” This time it’s Draco who gets up and offers a hand out to Harry. “I’m ready to go back to the party.”
Hearing the worried tone in Harry’s voice, Draco takes a moment to really look around the room. Mr Hoppy wakes up and begins to nibble on lettuce, unaware he’s being watched. There’s skeletons of both magical and Muggle creatures that hang from the ceiling, along with several mobiles of bats and different bird species. On every available surface there are displays and vials of animal organs. His bookcases are lined with books on dogs, cats, and birds as well as magical creatures. For the past week Draco has been wandering around his office looking over everything that he’s collected over the past several years, even taking to reading his journals and notes on the classes he’s attended at the Muggle university.
Draco taps his wand against Vernon’s heart, whispering a few words that causes a jet of purple light to sink into his skin. For a few tense seconds, Vernon waits for the pain to hit him, but nothing happens. Still, he doesn’t trust that the purple light is completely harmless.
Draco thinks about it, but he can’t always remember all of Blaise’s mother’s husbands, especially when they die so suddenly. “It could be,” he concedes, as Mrs Zabini does enjoy the finer things in life. Everything at Harrods is obscenely overpriced. Even a simple cotton shirt from there could cost a small fortune, which makes it the worst place to find a simple jumper, Draco realises.
The long slashes on Harry’s chest were the worst Draco had ever seen. Draco had taken the wand with trembling fingers and had spoken the words Snape had used to save Draco’s life months before. When Draco had been sure that the wounds had stopped bleeding, he had Summoned a vial of Dittany and thrust it at Granger. He had left the room just as Snape had burst through the fireplace.
Draco traces the ivy’s thin stem, remembering how, as a young child, he would walk with his mother around her garden as she pointed out the different flowers and their meanings. If he remembers correctly, ivy symbolises friendship, affection, wedded love, and fidelity.
Draco watches as Harry walks over and places the bouquet on the table, before crouching down next to him. A few flicks of Harry’s wand sends a localised numbing charm on the back of Draco’s knee and he feels no pain when he extends it.
“Uncle Harry!” Teddy exclaims, pointing a finger in Harry’s face, “you said a very bad word.” Teddy is sitting in Harry’s lap, munching on an apple as he watches the telly.
Draco dealt in books because that was his refuge during the war. After the Dark Lord had given him that impossible task of murdering Albus Dumbledore, Draco had searched for any scrap of information in books that could help him, both legal and illegal. When the Dark Lord had resided at the Manor, Draco would take as many books from the library to hide in his bedroom under the cover of revising for exams.
“Well, you’re the best potions master I know and when I heard that they were looking for one, I recommended you.”
Fifteen minutes later, Draco steps out of the shower feeling refreshed and uses his wand to dry off before stepping into Harry’s walk-in closet with his towel wrapped securely around his waist.
Before Harry can respond, Teddy tugs on Draco’s shirt and Draco looks down even though he can’t see his cousin. “It’s not really dead, Draco,” Teddy says in a soft voice, “Do you need help guessing what it is?”
“Don’t be an idiot. We are no longer students at Hogwarts,” Draco said. “Look, I know that I don’t have any right to be, but I was worried when I arrived from Montreal and you were nowhere to be found. At least I tell you when I’ll be gone.”
“What makes you think I brought you back anything?” Harry teases. “If I remember correctly, I was on a mission, not on holiday.”
Pansy follows him, examining the first table they come across with a raised eyebrow. It’s filled with tourist trinkets: shot glasses, small stuffed bears, postcards with the Muggle queen, t-shirts, ceramic plates, photo frames and, surprisingly, socks.
“What?” Harry says, confused. But then he gets a proper look at Draco and his face softens. He takes the tie from Pansy and loosens the knot. After a moment’s hesitation, Harry puts up a Silencing Charm, much to Pansy’s displeasure.
Harry shrugs his shoulders. “Mostly curiosity. I mean, he doesn’t know where I live, but the letter somehow made its way to our doorstep and it’s not cursed in any way.”
“Teddy!” they exclaim at the same time. Draco almost falls to the floor as he jumps out of bed, Harry following a few steps behind him.
“Of course they can. The Howlers are attached to owls which are known to deliver the post internationally. Although they do need a few days to recover after each visit.” Hermione sits down in her chair and Ron gently takes Rose and cradles her in his arms, making sure to support her head. Hermione murmurs ‘thanks’ before she casts a Cooling Charm over their group.
“No, he didn’t kill Mr Hoppy!” Teddy says. All three turn to look at the corner of Draco’s office that houses the first patient that Draco had ever treated. Mr Hoppy, a black rabbit with a pink nose, named because he had broken his leg hopping down from a tree after a bout of Teddy’s underage magic, is Teddy’s pet. Draco breathes a sigh of relief when he realises that Mr Hoppy is also very much alive, even if he’s sleeping peacefully at the moment.
He had not walked more than a few steps from the kitchen before he heard the scratching of the kitchen chair against the floor. His arm was grabbed from behind, not forcibly to hurt him, but Draco stopped just the same.
Draco takes it from her. Immediately, he can tell that the jumper is poorly made, as there are several threads pulled loose. He’ll have to use tailoring spells so that the rough fabric won’t scratch his skin too terribly. He hides his frown from Amy, who has been nothing but helpful. It’s not her fault that the jumper is subpar.
Harry pulls the bouquet out of Draco’s hand and replaces it with his own, squeezing gently. Harry’s hands are warm, sun kissed and calloused, while Draco’s fingers are pale, bony and cold to the touch.
-- happy and only suggested that I add the ivy to wrap it around the other plants. He said that the ivy describes how I feel for you and that you would know what it means.”
Harry slowly lets out a huge breath. “Well, yeah. I want to. She’s just a child, only seven, and if she’s a witch, it’s still a long time until she gets her Hogwarts letter. Hermione says that Professor McGonagall personally delivered her letter and answered any questions her parents had. I don’t want Daisy to wait that long or cause her to be afraid of her magic because she doesn’t know what is happening.”
Hermione gives Ron a dirty look. “She was grieving, Ron. You can’t fault her for that. However, I do agree that perhaps you should have been a little more tactful, Harry. Have you apologised to Charlie?”
Pansy unfolds a garish pink jumper with multiple rainbows on the front and the collar trimmed in green tinsel. Her look of disgust turns to delight as she reads out the words. “Draco, look at this.
Perhaps if Draco had met Muggles like her when he was a child, then he would have had a harder time believing that Muggles were beneath him.
Harry gaped at her. He knew that she was the brightest witch he had ever met, but to guess correctly after only a small amount of clues?
He still can’t believe that he has been secretly dating Harry for almost two years, ever since he defected from Voldemort’s side after failing to kill Professor Dumbledore. Draco had left his parents behind that night in favour of helping the Order and hasn’t regretted it once.
“Sorry about the tie. Mrs Weasley was kind enough to darn our clothing over the hols, but it must have gotten mixed up when we were packing,” he quietly says to Draco. “Otherwise, I don’t care that you want to wear my clothing. What’s mine is yours, truly.”
“Well, was it fantastic?” Hermione asked, but immediately put her hand over her mouth. “Sorry, that was rude of me to ask. But I don’t see what’s wrong.”
Daisy beams at him. “Brilliant!” Daisy says, and she doesn’t hesitate to slam her book shut and throw her items in her backpack. “You’re so lucky to be able to do magic! Sometimes I wish I was a witch,” she says wistfully. Draco tries to find the right words to comfort her when suddenly Daisy’s stomach growls and she begins to blush.
Daisy laughs, shaking her head. “No. You have to solve for ‘x’, not find it. Here, look.” She picks up her Muggle gadget and punches the buttons, using her pencil to write down numbers and symbols.
Draco dropped his messenger bag on the sofa and made his way upstairs. He stood in front of Harry’s door and knocked, but did not receive a response. He knocked harder and even pressed his ear against the door, but was greeted with silence. He had the feeling that Harry wouldn’t ask for any help tonight.
He’s speechless and in that time, Draco hears the front doorbell ring. When he opens the door, Harry is standing outside. His Auror coat is thrown over his shoulder and his clothes underneath are wrinkled as if he’s been chasing after someone all day. There are no words to describe his hair, but that doesn’t matter, because Draco’s heart is still beating fast at the sight of him.
Draco nods. Even the greasy pizza will be better than whatever he attempts to cook. “Order one with pineapple on top.”
Harry laughs, his eyes crinkling. “Now that would have been a disaster.” He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a green and silver tie. “I saw this on the bathroom floor and thought you had forgotten it.”
No. Harry had to stop those thoughts before they got out of control. Yes, they had shared one night together and what a wonderful night it had been, but there had been no promises made. In fact, Harry could arrive home and find out that Draco had found someone. It would hurt, but there was nothing he could do about it. They were not promised to each other.
The cold water feels heavenly and Harry focuses on Luna’s dress as he tries to collect his thoughts. “Luna, I’m sorry,” Harry says as soon as his heart rate slows down. “You should be outside enjoying your special day, not stuck inside here with me.”
Draco whistles as soon as the song is over. The wooden spoon clatters on the countertop as Harry rushes over and greets him with a kiss.
Draco falls back into his seat. “I doubt it. I don’t think they follow the same etiquette rules that we were forced to learn.”
“Draco, you’re late! Where are you? I have some news for you! Don’t tell me that I woke up early for nothing!” Pansy’s voice gets louder with each sentence until Draco jolts awake, heart pounding. He quickly looks around the room, straining his eyes in the semi-darkness. Finally, his hand locates his wand underneath his pillow and he quickly casts a Silencing Charm on her dolphin Patronus.
“Well, we did sleep together already,” he said, blushing, and he couldn’t quite look at his best friend in the eyes.
.” The white smoke vanishes and Harry uses his Seeker’s reflexes to catch it before it hits the ground. He turns to Draco, smiling and lacing their fingers together, squeezing gently. “Actually, it’s us.”
Draco feels his cheeks warm at the sincerity of the words. By now he’s used to Harry speaking his mind, although Draco sometimes still struggles with saying what he means. “It happens,” Draco says at last, shrugging. “It could have been worse. Luckily, it wasn’t a Weasley jumper with the wrong letter.”
Ginny and Pansy both laugh at the look on Ron’s face. Even Harry tries to hide his grin as he passes out more glasses of wine before sitting down.
“No,” Harry replies, looking down at Teddy’s worried face. He hair has turned brown and he has his hands deep in his pockets. “I’m not angry. How can I be angry at something that is not your fault?”
“You’re telling me that I have supported the wrong team my entire life?” Draco says, taking a sip of wine. “How could I wasted forty years supporting the Magpies, a team who has won over fifty League Cups, when it’s obvious I should have been a Cannons fan?”
Harry shakes his head. “He’s never mentioned it. I don’t even know if Howlers can travel long distances without losing their magic. Can they, Hermione?” Harry asks her as she joins their table.
“Then what are we waiting for?” Harry asks when Pansy holds onto his arm and prevents him from moving.
“Draco, you practically live together as you haven’t been to your flat in months. I’m sure you’ve seen every inch of Harry’s body by now,” she says, rolling her eyes. She adds it to the growing pile in the shopping basket before picking up a bright orange jumper. After reading it, she tries to hold in her laughter as she asks, “Draco, does Harry still have that house-elf?”
He was a book restorer of sorts, nothing as glamourous or heroic as Harry, who had not bothered to return to Hogwarts. Instead, he and Ron Weasley had gone straight into Auror training where they had quickly risen in the ranks. In the early days, the
“Draco, what the fuck!” Pansy’s head appears in the green flames and she scowls when she sees him. “This better be important.”
At least that got a reaction out of Harry, although it wasn’t one that Draco was expecting. He glared at Draco, something that Draco had not experienced from Harry since before the war. It shocked Draco and made him question what this raid was all about. Was there some sort of Dark artefacts that had been connected to the Malfoys? It surely affected Harry more than Ron and that couldn’t be anything good.
“What is this shit?” He glances at the byline and lets out a groan of frustration. “I knew only Rita Skeeter would sink so low as to write this! Her words are worthless.”
Draco holds the bird in the palm of his hand for Harry to inspect. “After this, just observe the bird for a few days until fully healed. And the last question, Potter?”
With that bit of encouragement, Harry feels a great weight lift off his shoulders and he finds the courage to say what he really thinks about his date. “He’s really brilliant! He brews potions and has his own business and occasionally consults with the Aurors. He’s snarky and unafraid to take me off the pedestal that everyone else has put me on. He’s very sarcastic, but that’s only because it’s his default defense mechanism, but once he lets his guard down, he’s loyal to a fault.”
? Who’s your boyfriend?” she asks, frowning. “The last thing I’ve heard is that you were doomed to either an arranged marriage or a confirmed bachelor.” Without waiting for a response, she grasps his tie and flips it around.
Harry has a feeling that if he takes a bite right now, it would probably feel like a rock in his stomach. He doesn’t look forward to being questioned about his relationship with Charlie Weasley by his best friend. On the other hand, it’s easier to talk to Ron right now, rather than the entire Weasley family at the next Sunday brunch.
“So? They already know you are dating,” she says, shuddering. “Believe me, no one can forget the incident at the Leaky Cauldron. I almost asked Granger to Obliviate me. I’m sure Ron did ask, but—”
Harry lets out a huge breath of air. Draco loves to dance and he’s always trying to coax Harry into joining him for one dance. Which he usually doesn’t mind, but one dance leads to three, which leads to dancing the night away if Draco has his way. “Ah, I’m not sure it’s going to happen tonight. But I can make it up to you if you like?”
When he was younger and stuck with the Dursleys, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened. Until he was eleven and he had discovered magic, had found his best friends, and had found the Weasleys, who took him in and loved an orphaned boy as one of their own. Even after the war, when he had already lost so many friends and family, he had been fortunate to find Draco and fall in love with him.
“I’m so glad you think so. In the beginning, Draco told me that he didn’t know if you would work well together. But then as the days passed, he would speak less of how vexing it was working with you and more of—”
Expecting a ‘treat’ from Weasley’s joke shop, Draco tries his best to smooth out his expression as he closes his eyes. He hears Harry’s low laugh and Teddy’s giggles as an item drops into his hands. It’s very hard, cold, and fuzzy and Draco grimaces.
Draco had expected to find Grimmauld Place bursting with light, the delicious aroma of sugar biscuits wafting from the kitchen, and at the very least, Celestina Warbeck playing on the Wireless. It was the first of December, the very earliest that Draco would let Harry decorate for Christmas, and Harry had insisted he would take the day off to take full advantage of it.
“I’m sorry, Harry,” Draco says. He doesn’t say anything else, but Harry doesn’t need to hear any more words.
Harry shakes his head. “Sorry, you know I’m a Harpies fan,” he says. “They’ve never broken my heart with a losing season.”
“He was consulting on a case on Valentine’s Day and I was helping to finish a report. Someone had sent him roses and he Vanished them and then asked me to help sterilise his lab.” Harry smiles. “I think that was the first time I realised I had a bit of a crush.”
“What? That was three weeks ago.” Harry was single. This was something that Draco had never dared to hope happen. “Impossible. What did he do?”
Harry leans back, wiping away the tears that have started to fall down his face, and pulls Teddy onto his lap, his hand never letting go of Draco. “I’m not sad, Teddy. How can I be? I have everything I need in the world right here in my arms.”
“We don’t even know where he is,” Harry begins, but then he remembers the coin in his pocket. He pulls it out and shows it to her. “We can go to the Port Key office and have this traced to find his location.”
Draco pulls out the unravelled blue jumper from his pocket and shows it to her. “My boyfriend tried to knit me a jumper, for a tradition his family has at Christmas. However, his cats tore it apart before he could finish. So I’m here hoping to find a replacement.”
Realistically, Harry knew that the answer was no. But there was always a tiny sliver of doubt. All he could do was shrug his shoulders.
to refill his glass. He offers to do the same for Charlie, but the other man declines. Harry and Charlie stare at each other and Harry spots minor differences since the last time they saw each other. His hair is longer, there’s a new tattoo on his wrist, and there are more scars on his face. Most of the scars are faint, but there is a fresh one underneath his left earlobe.
The first few years he hadn’t looked for business, as it was just a hobby for him. Then Draco had started working on his friends’ libraries, which led to helping out other families who had fought on the wrong side of the war. Professor McGonagall had even taken an interest to his hobby and had recommended several people that needed his services.
“I am, too,” Harry says.  “Now, if you remember, I have a present for you.” Harry pulls out a tiny silver egg, the size of a Bertie Bott’s bean, from his pocket, before using his wand to return it to its original size.
Harry bites the inside of his cheek, tasting blood. Why has Draco never told him this? Memories of past brunches at the Burrow come to mind, but all of them are full of boisterous laughter, delicious food, and Draco is always by his side… unless Draco is sitting in the corner with no one but Teddy and Andromeda, who passed away last year, to keep him company. In fact, now that Draco mentions it, the Weasleys haven’t been as welcoming to Draco as they have been to their childrens’ partners. Draco never has received a birthday cake from Mrs Weasley and even when Draco participates in the Secret Santa gift exchange, his gift is always some trinket that could be found in a souvenir shop and not something thoughtful.
At those words, a lump forms in Draco’s throat. “Thank you, Teddy,” Draco says, giving him another hug.
“Oh this is rich. You’re single, Malfoy? Of course you are. Who would ever want you?” Ron says, almost laughing until Hermione hisses, “Ron!” and not so subtly pushes his shoulder.
Draco rolled his eyes. Forget civility. He would need a whole lot of alcohol if he wanted to get through this conversation, but it was far too early to start drinking. “So that I can inform Ron that when I finally left, you said that there was nothing wrong with your arm.”
“Look, Pansy, they even have jumpers for babies,” Draco says. “These jumpers really don’t flatter anyone, do they?”
There was no possible way he was going downstairs to an irritable Harry, especially when he didn’t know why Harry was acting odd around him. The bed creaked as Draco sat on it and he sighed as he looked around the room. There were no personal belongings here. He just had his books and clothes and if he needed anything else, he ordered it by owl. There were no photographs or letters from friends or family, only business letters that he filed away after he was done with a job.
“Thank you,” Harry says, kissing Draco as he enters. He toes off his shoes as he walks towards the kitchen, setting the bags down on the table. A quick swish of his wand has the groceries sorting themselves in the fridge and pantry. “What do you want for dinner? We could try the chicken -- Draco? What’s wrong?”
Luckily, he doesn’t encounter any distractions or troublesome students on his way to the Great Hall. It’s more than half-full, with students catching up with friends back from Christmas hols.
“Shit,” Harry says, turning off the water and running out the door. He forgets to put on his glasses as he hurries to catch up, almost stumbling several times.
Harry sighs. “My Aunt Petunia would never admit to anyone that her precious Ickle Dudleykins had lice. In fact, the one time my cousin had lice, she took him to the doctor’s to get a professional treatment and then threatened to sue if the neighbours ever found out. As for me, Aunt Petunia would just cut off all of my hair. It was the simplest solution, plus it had the added benefit of making my head look ridiculous.”
“Thank you,” Harry says. “It got a bit overwhelming.” He tries to give the sunflower bouquet to her. “Here. I think the dove was a little misguided and made a mistake,” he begins but Luna shakes her head.
Draco laughs. “That’s not true. You do not know how very wrong that is. I bet even Harry wouldn’t know how to solve any of this.”
“Hmph,” Draco says, but he’s not as irritated as he was before. He leans against Harry’s shoulder, squinting down at the crystal ball. “I don’t see anything. Give me a clue.”
“I need to know this,” Draco says at last, trying not to sound frustrated. “I don’t know what’s going to be on the exam tomorrow and I’ve come so far to fail now.”
Pansy tries to keep a straight face when she speaks, but the corners of her mouth twitch. “At least it didn’t scar. Besides, I’m sure that at the end of the day, Harry still loves you and doesn’t care that the jumper is ruined.”
“Yes, I broke up with him right after breakfast this morning just as he arrived via Portkey. I feel like shit about it because he had just finished kissing me and the first words out of my mouth were ‘we should break up.’” Just saying the words brings a heat of embarrassment to Harry’s cheeks, which is precisely why he didn’t want to talk about it in the first place.
One thing he knows for certain: he loves Draco more than anything else in the word. To give up something for him would not be such a hardship, not if it brought them peace of mind and happiness.
It didn’t take long for Draco to figure out that Harry was lonely now that his friends were married and starting families of their own. One Saturday morning, Harry had turned up outside his flat with Teddy to explore Muggle London, something that Harry had never done as a child. Draco had enjoyed the museums and was surprised at how much fun the football match was even with Teddy screaming in his ear. They had continued exploring London every Saturday and sometimes his Aunt Andromeda would join them, which reminded Draco that perhaps Harry only saw them as friends, or wanted Teddy to grow up with his family.
“Draco, look at this!” Pansy says excitedly, “you can wear this one with Harry.” She holds up an oversized red jumper made for two people. It’s supposed to be Santa Claus and one of his elves. “Although, Harry would have to be Santa because he’s the Gryffindor with a heart of gold.”
“Andromeda left us a box that the primary school used on the Muggle children. I’m sure that it should work for you.” Harry Summons the box he left on the kitchen counter and hands it to Draco, who scans it quickly before scowling.
“Why?” Draco asks. “I wouldn’t have said no, Harry, even though I might regret it later. I know how important family is to you.”
“There’s an article about Draco in today’s paper. It’s not good news, Harry,” she says quietly as she hands it over.
“Harry, is this my Weasley jumper?” Draco asks, looking down at the blue jumper, tracing a finger over the white
“I have a surprise for you,” Harry says as they sit on a bench in the gardens at the Burrow. They had just finished a wonderful Easter meal prepared by Mrs Weasley and were now enjoying a glass of wine before saying their goodbyes.
Draco doesn’t speak for a very long time and Harry’s already thinking of what words to help him understand why he’s agreeing. Suddenly, Draco takes both of Harry’s hands in his and squeezes them. “I hope that when you call your cousin, you wait for an apology.”
Harry tries for humour, saying, “Well, he’s very pale, wears no clothing at all just like you prefer, and he’s cold to the touch, just like you are right now.”
To Draco’s surprise and shock, six white ferrets jump out of the briefcase and run around the table. Their tails are brushed out, beady red eyes looking at everything of interest, whiskers twitching before they attack. They jump and scatter about, splashing tea and knocking things over as everyone stares at them. In an instant, all the desserts are quickly smashed into crumbs.
Harry frowned. “Well, I couldn’t levitate the tree in front of the Muggles. I had to drag the tree so that I could Apparate without them knowing. Even then, I couldn’t Apparate right into the house. I could have done some serious damage. The Muggles would have noticed if I had destroyed my house,” Harry said.
Harry gently removes the clock and sends it back on the wall with a flick of his wand. Draco is frowning in his sleep, lips pressed in a thin line, and a muscle twitches in his neck, a sure sign that his dreams are troubling him.
“Now, Harry, I wouldn’t be that dramatic,” Andromeda says, while trying not to smile. “My nephew knows that these things happen. It’s one of the joys of raising children.”
“Like the constellation?” she asks excitedly. “Mum is teaching me to find them, but they all look the same to me.”
“Potter,” Draco warns. Draco only says the surname when he’s annoyed. “Did you bring me a dead animal? Not even I can bring back the dead. That’s more of your specialty, remember?” Draco has only said the most outrageous thing to cross his mind, but judging from the silence, Draco thinks he’s close to the truth.
Even though Charlie can’t see him, Harry nods. “I’m sorry,” he says. “I didn’t plan it, but I did kiss him. The only thing that happened is that he pushed me away.”
“Dudley’s probably never mentioned that I’m a wizard to his family, if I’m mentioned at all. So if she has bursts of accidental magic, especially around other people who become scared, there would be no one around to tell her that it’s normal. Wouldn’t you be frightened if strange things happened to you, things you couldn’t explain? I think it’s better to know the truth than to be kept in the dark, don’t you agree?”
It’s on the tip of Harry’s tongue to say that Malfoy is definitely single. With Malfoy in charge of the wedding planning and having Harry as his assistant, they had found out they actually enjoyed each other’s company. Harry liked working with Malfoy; his sharp wit and constant commentary had been refreshing to Harry’s ears. With Luna and Rolf, Malfoy was attentive, always listened to their suggestions, and even found ways to incorporate their simplest requests in the wedding, such as having the white peacocks as their ring bearers.
Whenever Harry had first started talking to him as they were finishing their cases, Draco had been surprised. Yes, they worked well together, but that didn’t mean they had to be social.
Draco is sitting behind his desk, holding a framed photo. He puts it down and raises an eyebrow. “Normally, I’d be polite and say you have a lovely family, but that would be a lie.”
A loud knock on the door distracts Harry from his thoughts. Harry looks up to see Charlie Weasley step inside the kitchen and set a leather suitcase down on the table.
‘He doesn’t play with me like you do. He just stares at me most of the time, or lets me watch the telly.”
“Don’t worry, Weasley, we’ll put up Silencing and Privacy wards just for your delicate eyes,” Draco says as he follows Harry away from the birthday party and into the calmness of their garden.
. As Draco makes his way over to her, he sees Granger and Weasley at the Gryffindor table, deep in conversation. Granger is frowning, whilst Weasley tries to take a bite of everything on his plate at once.
“I was too stressed last night so I baked the Muggle way. Although I don’t think it helped much to keep my mind off the interview today.”
“No! Nothing like that! I didn’t bring home a literal man,” Harry hastily explains, turning around to see that Draco’s lips are pressed in a thin line. “I brought you back a statue.”
“Harry, go find a nice box for Mr Finny,” Draco says, ushering a still sniffling Teddy out of the kitchen. They settle down in the soft sofa in the living room and Draco lays Teddy’s head on his lap.
Draco was shit at cooking, no matter how hard he tried to think otherwise. When Draco had first admitted that he didn’t know how to cook, Harry didn’t ridicule him, but rather showed him how to make simple meals. Harry was the cook in this household; Draco was mostly there to supervise and sample because he had a refined palate.
Still, Teddy had recently contacted lice from the Muggle primary school he attended and there was a large possibility that he had passed it on to both Draco and Harry.
Inside the brightly lit living room, Draco takes a proper look at Harry. He’s dressed sharply, dark slacks and a white button down shirt. There are no scruffy trainers in sight, but rather polished black shoes that complement his belt. Harry’s hair is still wild and the curls that fall down in his face make Draco want to run his hands through them.
Harry sighs, taking his glasses off and cleaning them. The world blurs for Harry, illuminated only by the twinkling fairy lights that decorate the trees where the wedding reception is being held.
“Harry, did you forget who you are talking to? I will always be introduced as former Death Eater Draco Malfoy. If anything, you should be worried about being seen with me.”
Pansy’s mouth drops open in shock. “He what? Draco, I don’t think he has ever done that with anyone before. At least Ginny’s never mentioned it.”
Fuck. The news was supposed to be a secret, until he could figure out a way to tell Harry that wouldn’t scare him. They had never really talked about having children, but seeing Harry with Teddy never made Draco doubt that he would be an amazing father.
So even if Daisy had been a witch, Draco would have had the same problem. Harry’s the one who’s charismatic and outgoing and could talk to anyone, even if he had just met them. Draco, on the other hand, appears standoffish to everyone except his closest friends. He’s only comfortable when he’s with Harry or working on his lycanthropy research in his potions lab.
As he walks to the coffee shop, he hardly sees anyone in the streets this early. Soon, however, the shops will open and Draco can buy his jumper as well as something to give the hosts tonight. Perhaps he will buy some wine to go along with Harry’s dish.
“If by working together, he means that he would argue why things had to be done his way, then yes, ‘we worked well together,’” Harry interrupts. “But even when we would argue, he said that helping you with the wedding was the least he could do after all he put you through during the war. He especially wanted your wedding dress to be perfect.”
Pansy flings the door open so hard that it hits the wall and starts to shut again. Harry barely manages to leave the door open a crack, hoping that the shadows prevent Draco from seeing him.
“Teddy, tell me what’s wrong,” Harry says, embracing Teddy and gently wiping the tears away with his shirt.
At those words, Draco finally turns his head to look at Harry with wide eyes. “You’re telling me that you took a year off from the Aurors, a job you love, just to travel?”
Despite his nerves, a smile spreads across Draco’s face. “That’s only because the art of potion brewing is very similar to baking.”
Ron nodded. “Well, the only reason that Harry was allowed to discharge and return to Grimmauld Place was if someone was here to take care of him in case he needed anything,” Ron said, scratching the back of his head. There was a long stretch of pink skin on the side of his neck that had been recently healed. “But I wanted to go home to Hermione and tell her that Harry is okay. She’s rather worried about him, but couldn’t go to St Mungo’s that far along unless it’s time to deliver the baby.”
“I’m glad. I was a bit worried,” Harry says, and Draco frowns. “Don’t look at me like that. I know you can take care of yourself, but that doesn’t mean I don’t worry.”
“What?” Harry wishes he could hide. The last thing he wants to do is stand up in front of the crowd after the conversation he’s just had with his friends.
Draco scoffs. “How dare you!” Okay, he might be a little tipsy from the wine. “I would never give you a faulty present. Just take a bite, you’ll see.”
Hermione’s eyes are wide as she exclaims, “Harry, you were together for more than a year and you don’t honestly believe that’s the way you want to end your relationship with Charlie? A quick ‘we should break up’ with no explanation and then ignore him at the wedding where he’s supposed to be your date. At least with Ginny you ended things amicably, but how did Charlie react?”
Harry’s puzzled look soon changed into surprise when he opened it and saw what was inside. Draco had found the journal hidden in the floorboards of Sirius Black’s room. Inside, the pages were filled with drawings and scribbles that Sirius had probably written in order to keep him entertained during his lessons. “It was Sirius Black’s journal. Your father wrote in it frequently. So did Professor Lupin.”
“I’m sure that it was such a shock to find that out about Draco, especially for your friends and family.”
This isn’t the first time Harry has found Draco sleeping this way. Harry hates the stress the undercover missions causes his husband and he aches to smooth out the lines on Draco’s forehead. If he were awake, Draco would never state that he is unhappy with Harry’s job, because he knows how much Harry enjoys being an Auror. At least he isn’t crying in his sleep this time.
“Or it won’t be a proper surprise, silly!” Teddy laughs and he steps into the room holding his hands behind his back. Draco opens his mouth to decline when Harry joins Teddy and says, “Don’t worry, Draco, you’ll
Draco presses his lips in a thin line, just so that nothing negative escapes his mouth. He doesn’t like the way Harry has said
Draco had jolted back in shock. He had felt panic build in his chest as he watched Harry Potter dying right before his eyes. Without thinking, Draco had grabbed his wand from its holster, but Granger interrupted him.
! Draco frowns. The dreary weather and the long hours at St Mungo’s must be affecting his mental state if he’s hearing voices and no one is there. Shaking his head, he only manages to walk a few steps before he hears the opening words to the song again.
“I’m sorry, Vernon,” Tim from Accounting says when Vernon exits the lift, “the lift has been giving us trouble all day. At least you didn’t have to climb all those stairs.”
Draco flops down on the couch, breathing heavily as he thinks of what to do next. There is no way he’s reaching under the tree to grab the jumper. Once Harry sees his hair a different colour, he’ll want to know why he was disturbing the presents. An
“No, please listen before you say anything,” Harry says. He continues when Draco doesn’t interrupt again. “This last Auror mission made me realise how much of the world I still haven’t seen. I haven’t traveled properly and I can’t do it if I’m stuck behind a desk whenever I’m not on a mission.”
Draco watches as a smile slowly spreads across Teddy’s face and he practically yells, “I will? How?”
“Fine. If it makes you feel better, I’ll wear your tie, too,” Harry says, knotting the Slytherin tie. He makes it a point to turn it around to show Draco the silver stitching on the back. He grins at Draco and says, “Draco Malfoy. Have you heard of him? Supposedly he’s a gorgeous bloke wearing a Gryffindor tie?”
“I thought it was broken and I was trying to fix it. Your clock hand has been in the same place for far too long, never moving,” Draco says. He yawns, the warm air tickling Harry’s skin. “It’s okay. As long as you aren’t in
On the night in question, Draco had been out celebrating a colleague's birthday. One drink had turned into many and he had only seen that the man in front of him had messy black hair and hazel eyes, close enough to green in the dim light.
Charlies finally turns away from the window to look at Harry. There’s no judgment in his expression, but it still causes Harry to have difficulty swallowing water past the lump that has formed in his throat.
“Oh,” Hermione said, her brown eyes gazing at Harry’s. “I thought you liked it here. There are so many opportunities here. You could enter the Auror training programme—I know that you think you wouldn’t be given a fair chance in London, that they would just give you the position when you return.”
“They are super easy to take care of, practically self-sufficient, and in a pinch you can eat them if you get hungry.”
That got Harry’s attention and he glanced at Draco, confusion written all over his face. “You’re leaving?”
“The usual,” he barks, as if they don’t already know his order, “And make it quick! Some of us have to return to our
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to remind you of that night. I know Professor Snape used dittany to help heal you. You’re bloody brilliant at potions and I wanted you to know that I’ve appreciated everything you’ve done since the war,” Harry says. He pauses and then tilts Draco’s chin up so that they can look at each other. “I like you a lot, Draco. I hope I haven’t gotten this all wrong and that you feel the same way?”
He stares out the window, wondering if he should call Harry to ask for help. All the shops they pass are either closed, or food shops, which are no help to him at all.
“Ideally, yes. Ron only said that the mission you were on was not even a dangerous one, but that  you were distracted and you broke your arm.” Draco sighed. “I know that’s rubbish because you take your job too seriously to ever be distracted by anything.”
In the end, he chooses comfort over style, picking up a pair of Harry’s joggers. He browses through all the shirts Harry has hanging, hoping to find the Slytherin t-shirt he had given Harry for his birthday.
“Non-magic people,” Harry says. “He’s a pureblood wizard, which means there’s not a single person in Draco’s family who wasn’t born with magic.”
While Ginny and Harry were talking, the dove took flight and circled the group of single guests several times. The next thing Harry knows, the dove drops the bouquet. Out of habit from years of playing Quidditch, Harry reaches out and snatches the bouquet out of the air. He hadn’t expected to actually catch the flowers since he’s not the tallest person in the group.
“So you actually were knitting this for me, right? For a Christmas present?” Draco asks. The jumper is so soft, made of thick wool that’s perfect for a cold winter’s day. Or at least it would have been if it hadn’t been dragged around Harry’s flat.
Draco gives her a small smile. “Magic and technology don’t mix. But I have a solution to your homework. Put your calculator away, please.”
“It’s true,” Harry exclaims. When Malfoy doesn’t respond, Harry continues speaking in hopes of changing his mind. “We get along better now. He’s smart, charming, and would do anything for his friends, including bringing some murderous albino peacocks to a wedding.”
Harry’s hand tightened. “How could I have said something when I knew you frequently went out to pull? A different person every night? I didn’t want to become another person that you ticked off a list.”
“I’ve changed my mind about the coffee. Instead, I’ll have a cup of Darjeeling, please. Add an éclair as well,” the man says. The barista rings up his order and asks for a name.
One of Draco’s weaknesses is that he cannot lie to Harry. “I used magic!” he says quickly. “I know you said we shouldn’t, but I couldn’t help it!”
As soon as Draco regained his balance after arriving by Portkey, he frowned. He turned around to see if the Portkey had accidentally deposited him in a different location, but no, there were framed photographs of Harry and his friends on the fireplace mantle.
“I completely understand, Hermione. It’s not like there aren’t Floo calls or International Portkeys that I could use to come visit you. I could go back to London right now and come visit you on the weekends.”
Vernon knows he’s said the wrong thing when he feels the room become eerily quiet. He can’t hear himself breathe and the room’s temperature drops a few degrees. He shrinks back in fear as Draco lowers his wand and points it against Vernon’s heart.
The first box he opened was filled with what was supposed to be fake snow, but was rather yellow and full of moth holes where the preservation spells had not held. He snorted. Why would anyone use fake snow when there was a perfectly good charm instead? Where was this supposed to go? On the carpet?
Harry can’t even think properly, not when Draco is teasing him, slowly stroking his cock in the way he enjoys. “A man?” Harry says it like it’s a question.
Harry clears his throat and hopes his voice doesn’t tremble when he finally says, “He’s very fit and not hard on the eyes, but there’s nothing official yet. I haven’t even asked him out on a date.”
Teddy is standing on a footstool in front of their aquarium. A jar of fish food has spilled on the floor and Teddy is standing there with tears running down his face, gasping for breath, hands pressed against the glass.
“Tell that to the general public. I had to go to Paris to finish my education and now I can’t get a job anywhere I’ve applied. I’m surprised that I even got an interview to work at the Weasley’s joke shop.” Draco picks up a blueberry muffin and begins to pick it apart.
The wind picks up, stinging Draco’s face and tousling up his hair. He scowls, looking around to find an empty alley to Disapparate. Before he does, he hears the faint words of the Muggle Christmas song and his heart begins to beat faster.
“Now I’ll only ask again because I know you’re tired and sleep deprived. What did you get me, Harry?”
Teddy slowly nods. “I tried so hard to take care of him. I fed him every morning and sang to him and told him all of my favourite stories.”
“I keep forgetting that you had to help Malfoy with this wedding,” Ron says, shuddering. “It must have been horrible.”
Harry revealed to Draco that after defeating Voldemort, he had begun buying anything that caught his attention in order to decorate for Christmas. That explained the odd choices such as a dancing Santa wearing only swim trunks and sunglasses that played what Draco assumed was a Muggle song just by listening to the lyrics.
“Let’s hope that’s true,” Harry says. “I’m not getting rid of any of you anytime soon.” He grabs the tin of treats off the table and offers one to Noel. A few seconds later, Holly joins her sister, standing on her hind legs to rest her head on Harry’s knees.
, something that Harry had insisted on when Draco had come to stay. Draco decided that he would get another book from his bag.
uses when they write about Draco. He looks haggard with dark shadows under his eyes, sunken bones, and long hair that he hadn’t had a chance to cut, as well as the Dark Mark on full display. He looks exhausted and so very young, very different from the man Harry has loved for almost five years.
“Even though it’s absolutely freezing, it’s so gorgeous out there. Have you made any breakfast?” Harry asked, pushing his way into the kitchen. Draco’s breakfast was still on his table and Harry did not ask as he began to eat. Draco let him, as Harry had probably not eaten a proper meal in over a day.
“Are you overcompensating for something, Harry?” Draco teases, his eyes full of mirth. However, he sits up and holds out his hands out as Harry deposits the egg, now the size of a dragon’s egg, in them.
Draco leans down and presses a kiss against Teddy’s forehead. “Yes, your grandmother will be honoured to give Mr Finny flowers. Now please don’t cry anymore. Everything’s going to be all right, Teddy. Are you feeling better?”
“What does he want?” he says, crossing his arms, probably so that he isn’t tempted to grab his wand to Apparate to find the Dursleys.
Draco pushes past his nerves, clearing his throat as he manages to say, “I did, yes, but I’ve changed my mind.”
He stopped himself. Harry was an adult and he could take care of himself, most of the time. If he was really in trouble, then Ron would have been over by now with his wand an inch from hexing Draco. Besides, it wouldn’t be long before the entire Weasley family came over to check up on Harry. With them would probably be Nick, Harry’s boyfriend. Draco was surprised that he hadn’t come over as soon as possible. After all, he did work at St Mungo’s and had probably heard the news by now.
The door burst open and Harry barged past him, struggling to drag in a tree. It must have been about seven feet tall and the scent was overbearing. Pine needles scattered all over the floor and bits of snow came into the house.
“Now that my own father has contributed to their suspicions, I don’t know if I can keep pretending that everything is all right for the rest of my life. It’s exhausting and wouldn’t be fair to both of us.” Draco is panting by the time he’s finished everything he wants to say and his face has lost what little colouring it has. Draco takes deep breaths and counts them slowly, trying to ground himself, a technique Harry’s own therapist taught him.
Draco, despite Ron taking his time with his fumbling words and hesitation, already knew what he was going to ask. He wanted to be childish and say no, especially since the cold expression that Harry had given him earlier was fresh on his mind. “You saw what Harry was like just now. I don’t think that’s a good idea.”
Vernon avoids the blond man’s gaze as a prickle of unease settles in his stomach. Is Draco following him? Is he some sort of deranged stalker? The last time Vernon had felt this way was about ten years ago when the
Harry grins because he can’t actually help himself. Malfoy is far from perfect, but it’s things like this that show Harry he’s changed.
“I’m pregnant,” Draco says, “and I will be needing your help to take care of your baby brother or sister. Can you do that for me?”
Draco, who doesn’t like dogs, scowls. To him, every dog is Hagrid’s dog, Fang. At last he manages to gently push the dog down and prevent him from tearing his shirt.
Draco has just walked into the kitchen with a peculiar look on his face. “I found this outside on the doormat. It’s for you.” He holds out an envelope and Harry takes it.
“That’s my fault,” Dudley says, his face turning slightly red, “but I hope it’s not too late to fix that.”
Harry changed into white shirt and layered it with Sirius’ leather jacket. The shirt was tight against his chest, but he ignored it in favour of trying to tame his messy hair. Checking his reflection in the mirror, Harry smiled at himself before sitting down at the desk in his room.
In front of the small group, Luna’s rainbow wedding dress shimmers every time she moves. She has sunflowers braided into her hair and a glimmering tiara made of silver unicorn horns sits on her head. In her hands she holds a white dove with a bouquet of sunflowers in its beak.
Dudley Dursley is nothing like Harry remembers. For one thing, he’s wearing glasses and has turned the excess weight into muscle. For another, he’s keeping quiet, watching Harry almost as if he’s afraid of him.
“Neville, are you here? I need your help,” Harry says as he enters Greenhouse Three on the Hogwarts grounds. Immediately, he is pushed back outside, falling onto the grass as the glass door slams shut. Harry looks up at the bright blue sky in shock, wincing as he feels a sharp pain in his left ankle.
“Well, you see, there’s this bloke that I’ve known for over half of my life that I can’t stop thinking about. He was a prat at school, but he’s changed. And I want to get to know him better to see if anything could come of it.”
Harry nods. “Yes. I told you I was planning on asking you to join me at the Burrow tomorrow. I didn’t want you to feel left out at the dinner, so I was trying to knit you one. I was so happy when I received one my first Christmas at Hogwarts, so I wanted to include you in the family tradition because you mean so much to me.” Harry’s cheeks turn red, but he never breaks eye contact as he says those words. “But since I was away for most of December, I couldn’t finish it.”
“Harry,” Hermione said, leading him away from the window and into the living room. She sat down and placed another cup of coffee into his hands. “Draco’s not the same person, right? After all, you’re living together and you would know best out of all of us. I know he’s been making you happy. So tell me about him.”
He’s surprised to see so much Christmas merchandise. It almost feels like he’s inside Weasley Wizard Wheezes and he doesn’t know where to look. There are the traditional advent calendars marked below price, as well as lumps of coal, Santa hats, red reindeer noses and antler headbands, biros with ink that smells like peppermints, Christmas crackers with promising prizes inside, miniature nutcrackers, and, finally, Draco holds up a reindeer baby onesie outfit complete with tiny antlers.
“No, he’s still dead,” Draco says. He flicks his stick to move the chair in front of Vernon’s desk back a few feet. “Have a seat, I’m not here to harm you. In fact, I’m here to ask you a simple question.”
A draught of cold air catches Harry completely off guard and he immediately opens his eyes. That turns out to be a bad idea, because he doesn’t have his glasses on and the shampoo stings his eyes, blinding him further. In shock, Harry coughs, trying to get rid of the water that has managed to enter his oesophagus. Harry steps away from the stream of water only to bump into lean muscle and arms wrapping around his chest from behind.
He rose from the couch and stretched, groaning at each crack that signified he was getting old. He looked around the empty room and decided that he would surprise Harry and start decorating. Harry had already dragged all the Christmas decorations down from the attic and stuck them in the closet near the living room.
Since the beginning of December, Harry has been on an undercover mission in Madrid and has had no communication with anyone. It’s hard to be apart, but the one thing that keeps Draco going is that Harry had promised he would return in time to celebrate their first Christmas together. In all the time they have been dating, Harry has never broken a promise, and although Draco knows that things can change, he just misses Harry terribly.
“Are you all right, Teddy?” Draco asks, as he casts basic diagnostic charms on him. “Did you hurt yourself?” he continues, relieved when the charms reveal nothing.
“Do you want to help?” Draco asks. His face does not show any emotion, something Draco does on purpose when he doesn’t want to influence Harry’s decision.
to protect himself as he’s amongst Muggles. All he can do is hold his grocery bags closer to his body and walk faster to Harry’s flat in Muggle London
“Of course. Everyone has spoiled me with gifts. And as much as you’d like me to think that you did this on your own, I’ll have to give Pansy and Ginny a huge thank you gift for providing the entertainment and Molly for the delicious food.” Draco lowers his voice, forcing Harry to lean closer if he wants to hear. “However, there is one thing that’s missing.”
“There’s someone waiting for you back home, isn’t there?” Although it was asked as a question, Hermione didn’t have to wait for a response to know that it was true.
Draco thinks, glaring up at the drizzling sky that’s ruining his wool coat. He hates the cold and the light rain is making his mood worse. In his haste to leave St Mungo’s early to buy groceries, he had forgotten his umbrella. He can’t even cast
“Hermione, there was no chance to explain,” Ron says. “As soon as Charlie arrived, he saw Harry, kissed him, and the next thing we knew, they were broken up.” He shrugs his shoulders when Harry shoots him a glare. “I didn’t know why Malfoy was there, though.”
“Oh, please, don’t give anyone ideas,” Draco says, shuddering. “He would absolutely hate it. It’s bad enough that Rita Skeeter still tries to figure out where he lives and writes ridiculous articles on his life. He just wants to live in peace.”
Oh fuck. In the past, Draco and Harry had been lucky in replacing the purple betta fish before Teddy had noticed anything. It seems their luck has finally run out. It wasn’t their fault that the current fish, Mr Finny III, if Draco is counting correctly, had died while they were sleeping.
“I’m still in Madrid, waiting for my Portkey, but I wanted to talk to you as soon as I could. Sorry the mission took almost a month, but it’s finally over.”
“I could never forget one of the happiest days of my life,” Harry says. At those words, Draco’s expression softens. “However, I didn’t get you a ring.” Harry opens the black box to reveal a clear marble ball, which he then Transfigures back to full-size.
For the first time since seeing Draco, Vernon smiles. If Draco is here for an interview, then there's no way in hell that he will get hired. Vernon will absolutely make sure to let Human Resources know what an absolute creep the man is. He exhales and takes a sip of tea.
Draco finished the rest of his coffee and sighed. He had fallen into that disgusting habit that Harry had introduced him to and now he was too keyed up to attempt to sleep. He closed the book and glanced at his watch, surprised when he saw that it was a little past five in the morning.
Harry pauses, trying to figure out how much he wants to reveal. “Yes and no. He went to Hogwarts, but he’s entirely different than when he was a kid. So I’m trying to make a good first impression because I think he thinks that he doesn’t deserve me. In fact, it took me seven tries to ask him out on a date before he agreed. But I want to date him because he treats me like I’m a normal person and not some hero in the history books. He’s someone I could imagine being married to one day.”
“Ah,” Harry says, winking at Draco. “I’m afraid I can’t. I love him too much and he has shown me the error of my ways. Pineapple is an essential topping,” Harry says, kissing him again. This time Draco happily returns the kiss, making sure to run his fingers through Harry’s hair.
“No!” Draco says immediately. The shocked look on Amy’s face leads him to hastily add, “Believe me, children and pets don’t seem to like me. They prefer Harry, actually.”
“The value doesn’t make sense and I’ve tried to solve it so many times, but end up getting the same answer,” Daisy says, groaning in frustration.
“You can’t use magic!” Vernon says, remembering a hazy conversation he had with his nephew years ago. “You’ll get a letter from your Ministry. You’ll get arrested and go to Azakabam.”
“You were injured because of me?” Draco asked unable to stop the question from slipping out of his mouth.
Draco didn’t want to wait around for Ron to come back. He started wrapping the ornaments with care and placing them into the original container as fast as he could. The boxes were stacked neatly on the table and he was picking up his messenger bag when the sound of the Wireless shutting off finally got him to notice that Ron had returned. He looked a little worse for wear and his voice a little raspy when he spoke. “Listen, Malfoy, I need a favour.”
“Obviously the cat’s stomach is swollen and we would use an ultrasound to confirm it’s a pregnancy and not a tumor. Don’t make these questions too easy, Potter, or else I’ll think you’re up to something.”
“I’m just wondering if it’s time to go back to England,” Harry said, taking a long sip of his tea. Out of the corner of his eye, Harry gauged Hermione’s reaction to going home, partly to see if he was making the right choice.
Harry’s wardrobe contains his collection of t-shirts, denims, and Auror uniforms along with a few outfits from Gladrags that Harry wears when they go out to dinner. By contrast, all of Draco’s clothes are made in Paris, Milan, and New York unless he’s wearing his Healer robes.
, Harry thinks, as he grabs the doorknob to step inside the room, but Pansy shakes her head to stop him.
Harry had decided to hand in his resignation to Head Auror Robards, but instead of accepting it, Robards had told him to take a break. Harry could re-evaluate his decision about quitting when he returned.
He drops his wand on the nightstand and falls back onto his pillows, trying to breathe deeply to slow his racing heart. Draco had forgotten that he had written to Pansy asking her to meet him for breakfast on the first day back from Christmas hols. He regrets that now, especially when he hears the wind rattle the windows and he can see his breath every time he exhales.
However, now there’s an envelope in his hands that has only his name and no return address that has miraculously made its way to Harry’s home. This wouldn’t be the first time he receives a life-changing letter.
There are not many things that terrify Harry, but seeing Draco act like he’s being attacked and helpless to defend himself is one of them. “Draco! It’s me, Harry! You’re safe now,” he repeats over and over.
However, he has promised Harry he’d try to make Daisy feel welcomed and he is determined not to break that promise.
“Draco!” Harry says and it’s so good to hear Harry’s voice. It’s not the same as waking up next to him or eating dinner in Harry’s flat whilst listening to a Quidditch match, but he’ll take it. The last few weeks of stress starts to fade away now that he knows Harry is safe.
When Draco takes too long to answer, Harry pulls away for a second only to press the bouquet into Draco’s hands. “As Neville was putting together the bouquet, he asked about you-- well about my date. I know I talked his ear off, but I trust him not to tell anyone until we are ready, but he was glad that I was--
Harry bursts out laughing. “You’re right,” Harry says. “She is finally retiring and she gave it to me last time I visited Hogwarts. Even though her classes were awful, she did predict some real prophecies, so I thought it would be useful to have.”
Harry clears his throat, inhaling deeply to steady his nerves. “Well, here’s the thing, Neville. He’s allergic to roses.”
The brightness of the room was a result of snow falling outside. Draco stood and walked over to the window and pressed his hands against the glass. It was beautiful outside; the world was blanketed in a winter wonderland. Draco felt a twist of excitement through his stomach. He couldn’t wait to go downstairs to tell Harry that it was finally time to start decorating for Christmas.
Harry nods, at that point agreeing to anything as long as it lets him know that Draco is okay. Pansy scribbles a note to Blaise that they are going to pick up Draco. They watch it fold itself into an aeroplane and fly out the room.
Draco looks over his shoulder to see if there’s a caroler following him to ask for donations. He does not have any more Muggle money and even Muggles would notice if he drops large gold Galleons into their bucket.
Vernon stands there fuming. How dare he imply that he, Vernon, is rude? The nerve of the man to suggest that he would purposely make him wait! By the time he is working himself up to a proper response, the blond man is ready to place his order.
Ron clears his throat, holding up a scroll. “You even received a personal letter of recommendation from the Minister for magic.”
“Potter, did you really kill a rabbit?” Draco says at last, frowning. “Or perhaps a weasel?” Draco quickly pulls off the handkerchief. He sees Harry bent over in laughter, barely able to breathe as he wipes away tears.
“Listen, my Portkey is about to activate, so I have to go now. I’ll be home soon and we’ll talk about it some more. Oh, before I forget, I hope the cats haven’t caused you any trouble,” Harry asks.
So Harry had taken a chance and kissed him. What he got in return was a night so emotionally charged that a single Patronus produced from that memory would be able to fend off all the dementors in Azkaban.
The Floo roars to life in the room next to Draco’s office, distracting him long enough to splatter ink over his notes. He quickly Vanishes the extra ink on the parchment, before standing up to see if Harry and Teddy have returned from visiting the Weasleys. His bones crack and ache, and a quick
“Then wear mine,” Harry says, undoing his Gryffindor tie and holding it out for Draco. “It’s mine, I checked. Put it on, please. I like seeing you in my clothes.”
“Harry, before I forget,” Andromeda says as she digs into her purse and hands him a box. “Here. This is what the nurses at Teddy’s school recommended. It helps kills the lice. Draco should be fine after using this a few times.”
“No!” Dudley shouts, and Harry is taken aback by hearing Dudley raise his voice for the first time that day.
“Draco, are you serious? You can’t wear that! I won’t let you. I’ll give you one of my cashmere ones if we leave right now.” She pulls on his arm to steer him away, but Draco doesn’t budge.
Julia’s home office is the Muggle version of Hermione’s office at the Ministry. An entire wall is covered with bookcases crammed with books. Multiple diplomas are displayed behind a desk that is neat and organised, but stacked with several inches worth of paperwork. Painted on one wall are different structural formulas of chemical compounds.
, or even my friends and family can change that. I’m sorry for how they’ve treated you, but if they ask me to choose,” Harry says, reaching into his pocket to pull out the ring box. He keeps the lid closed as he continues, “I wouldn’t hesitate in my answer. Yes, there may be times when life is difficult, but I’m willing to be by your side because you’re worth it. I love you. Please tell me that you feel the same?”
Draco shrugs. “I don’t think it’s a wise choice for you. I know where you live. If you try to run, I'll find you. Remember the last time you tried to escape magic by traveling all over England so Harry couldn't get his Hogwarts letter? You never succeeded.”
will be displeased to find out that they need to print a retraction when they voted you as the best boyfriend one could possibly hope for. Your fans will be so disappointed,” Draco says. His hands are slowly making their way down Harry’s chest, touching every inch of skin that he can reach.
“I’m not leaving, Harry,” Draco said. “But I do have something for you, as an apology of sorts. I was going to wait and give this to you for Christmas, but I think you should have it right now.” Draco
“What?” Draco exclaims hoarsely, clearing his throat. “You know I don’t hate Teddy. I just feel so out of my comfort zone with him and sometimes I feel like I don’t know what I’m doing. I don’t want to fuck this up because he means the world to you.”
Draco shakes his head. “It’s almost over and you still owe me that dance. I want the first memory that I put in the crystal ball to be us of dancing.”
They are ushered in the living room where the walls are covered in film posters and there’s an entire bookcase filled with DVDs and Blu-Rays. Daisy runs over to a woman on the couch, who’s busy typing on a laptop. When she sees them, she shuts it closed and stands to greet them.
“I’ll do no such thing unless you stay and fight!” the knight responds. Draco sends a Stinging hex, smiling when the knight hisses in pain.
Draco smirks. “Well, you can try, but no one will believe you. Besides, where did you think I learned that spell? It’s untraceable; one of the perks of the job.”
“Ginny!” Harry exclaims, and he turns around once he feels the wand leave his back. “I’m sure that by now, just about everyone has heard about it and has wondered what’s wrong with me for always breaking up with the people I date.”
Draco’s breath hitches and Harry tilts his chin up so that he can look into Draco’s eyes when he says the next words. “I want to show the world that I am still yours and you are mine. Or this time we could do a proper bonding ceremony. I was going to wait to ask until we were fifty, but then I thought, why wait?”
Harry looks away from where Luna and her new husband, Rolf Scamander, are posing for the photographer while slicing their wedding cake. They look happy and carefree, vastly different from what Harry is feeling now that Ron is finally ready to discuss what he, Harry, considers the big Erumpent in the room.
He sits up in bed, looking over to Harry who might be in the midst of nightmares, but Harry’s as wide awake as he is, blinking owlishly.
Harry doesn’t respond; instead he trails his fingers through the blond strands, much like he did with Teddy earlier that morning. Poor Draco. Now that he’s close enough to see, there are red bumps and scratches everywhere on his scalp. Draco winces a bit and Harry stops combing the hair.
“Oh, cheer up, Weasley. You’re at a party,” Pansy says. “I don’t remember you being this glum at your birthday party a few months ago.”
A soft cough shakes him out of his thoughts. And even though there are people walking all around him, Vernon knows it’s the bloke from the coffee shop.
Ron nods. “I haven’t forgotten. I still remember Mum composing the Howler when she found out he was staying in Romania. ‘Charlie, what do you mean you can’t come home for Christmas? If the thought of not seeing your mum this Christmas can’t bring you home, then what about poor Harry? He’s missed you so much!’”
“Here you go!” Amy says, returning with the jumper. “We don’t have a changing room, but it looks like it’s your size.”
If Draco wanted to pursue a relationship, he needed to get a few things off his chest. He decided to start with the newspaper debacle as it was the easiest and most recent.
“You’re just like Harry, drinking pure sugar and calling it coffee,” Draco says, amused. He takes a sip of his black coffee and sighs, feeling the drink warm his body.
Dudley shakes his head. “No, nothing she ever did harmed us. I even took her to the zoo to see if she would talk to the snakes, but I don’t think she can.”
“I’m fine,” Harry had told her and it holds true now. Taking a deep breath, Harry pushes the white gate door open and walks through to the front door. The garden is lovely; it’s filled with roses, sunflowers, poppies, and lilies and holds a bird bath at the center. It’s much nicer than his Aunt Petunia’s. When Harry presses the doorbell, a dog begins to bark.
“Then it’s a good thing I decided to buy ingredients to cook beef stew tonight. Now don’t expect a fancy, delicious meal. You’re still teaching me, but I think I can manage this. Just dump all the ingredients in a pot, stir occasionally, and hope for the best. Exactly like you did in Professor Snape’s class.”
“Oh, I completely agree,” Pansy says, her eyes hard, “but what would be the point of publishing an article about Draco?”
Draco reaches out for it, eager to switch ties, but Harry pulls it out of reach. “You look good in red and gold, Draco. It suits you.”
Harry kept in mind that Malfoy hadn’t said he wouldn’t date Harry, only that he doesn’t ‘date taken men.’ That had been one of the motivations for Harry to break up with Charlie, who, after this morning, is now avoiding him and is standing as far away as possible for the bouquet toss.
To Draco’s knowledge, he hasn’t seen anyone in the wizarding world wear anything similar to these. Judging by Pansy’s incredulous expression, she hasn’t either.
Draco sits up straight and reaches for a book. “I have some ideas of making Wheezes toys, potions, and products. If you will allow me to explain?”
“Molly adores you!” Harry agrees. “She’s always asking about when you are going to come over and bake with her again. She says you’re a genius in the kitchen.”
“Who gave you this?” Draco said at last. He crumbled up the newspaper, trying to control the adrenaline and anger coursing through his body as he struggled to think. He looked up to see Harry standing there with his arms crossed against his chest, glancing outside the kitchen window.
Now, however, that the war is over and they are in the last term of their Eighth Year, Harry has asked Draco if it’s okay to reveal their relationship to their friends. Draco eagerly agrees, pleased that Harry wants no secrets kept from the people he loves.
Harry turns to look at her with his mouth open in shock. If Harry had to guess who the first person to figure out that he had a bit of a crush on Malfoy would be, he would have chosen Hermione.
“Hey, Draco, for what it’s worth, I’m sorry too. We both didn’t communicate properly, but we can learn from this, okay? This is not the worst argument we’ve had, and I doubt it will be the last.”
“Purge? Surely this is a bit too much? It sounds to me like you just found an excuse to get rid of my clothes.”
“I don’t know. It’s been almost ten years since the war ended, but I wouldn’t be surprised if people believed you did it under Voldemort’s orders.” Harry was breathing hard and he tugged down at the sleeves of the ghastly Weasley jumper he wore. “They’ve believed worse and there was nothing I could do or say to convince them otherwise. If you haven’t noticed, I can’t exactly go around and
Before he can say anything else, there’s two cracks of Apparition and both George and Ron land in front of them with a briefcase in hand.
Draco’s fingers accidentally press a button as he’s browsing and he lifts up a yellow jumper with angels on the front that sing. To his surprise, Pansy decides to buy it because, as she put it, “wouldn’t it be wonderful if I could change it to play Celestina Warbeck greatest hits?” He doesn’t have the heart to tell her no, that hearing her songs on repeat would become tiresome very soon.
“Draco! Draco!” Teddy’s excited voice carries through the flat, but he stops just before he enters Draco’s home office. A few months ago, Teddy had learned his lesson the hard way about entering Draco’s office unannounced, barging in on an experiment Draco had set up. Neither Draco nor Harry had been able to get rid of the cat whiskers on Teddy’s face for a few hours and had to finally ask Hermione for help.
Harry’s caught off guard when Draco pushes him down on the bed and rolls them over so that Harry is looking up at Draco, the sunlight making his hair shine gold.
“Go,” Hermione said, waving him off. “Don’t come back until we can give Draco the proper ‘If you break Harry’s heart, we will kill you’ speech.”
“Show-off,” Draco whispers, but the way his eyes are glued to the crystal ball reveal he’s intrigued. “What do you see?”
Draco’s removes his hands and Harry groans at the loss of pleasure. “Excuse me? Do you care to repeat that?” Draco says, his voice dangerously low. “You better not be asking for an open relationship.”
“I don’t see any reason why I should stay,” Draco replied. He glanced back to see that Harry had a worried expression on his face and he frowned when Draco added, “Especially when I know that I’m no longer wanted here.”
“What?” Draco frowns and looks down at the outfit in his hands. “This isn’t for a baby?” Upon closer inspection, he reads the tag attached out loud. “Christmas pet costume, one size fits most.”
Draco frowns. “No, I don’t think so. What if one of us needed to use the loo? We’d have to go in there together.”
Harry thanks her and closes the door behind them, levitating the box into the kitchen. Now faced with an empty flat, all Harry can think about are Teddy’s words and how he could bring this up to Draco without it becoming an argument.
“Not this time. Even though they are my best friends, they are busy starting their own lives together now.” Harry reaches beneath the bedsheet to find Draco’s hand, intertwining their fingers together. “That statue is just the start of the souvenirs I want to collect. For every place I visit, I want to have something that will remind me of the fun times I had whenever I see it. I want to have so many good memories during my year off, enough to fill a Pensieve.” Harry rests his forehead against Draco’s, as he adds quietly, “But they’ll only be happy memories if you’re there by my side.”
After starting a fire in the fireplace, Harry sat across from Draco. He grinned and said, “Where do you want to start?”
“Yes, Harry, the wedding has been lovely so far, but if I know you, you wouldn’t want to cause any distractions. Seeing as you already have, you should probably apologise to Charlie and Luna as soon as you can.”
“So your,” he says, pausing, trying to come up with the correct term. He points at the Muggle object, which is slim and has different coloured buttons, “Your phone is not helping?”
“You said you want to impress them, Harry?” Neville asks as they walk to Greenhouse Seven. “What do you want the roses to say?”
Draco shakes his head. “Is it? I read every word of the article on the train ride over here and not one word is false. I can’t sue for libel, which is a miracle in and of itself considering it’s written by Skeeter. I cannot escape my past nor should I be able to and this article will ensure that I’m even more ostracized.”
Harry says it so nonchalantly, but talking to Professor Snape’s portrait is always hard on both of them. There are so many memories, both good and bad, from the war that come up whenever they visit Hogwarts and speak to the portraits. For Harry to have done that for him is an act of kindness that Draco doesn’t even know how to begin to repay.
Amy brushes her hand against the fabric, frowning as a piece of yarn falls out. “What a shame for that to have happened to a thoughtful gift. Is there anything similar you have found?”
This is the reason Draco had been complaining about his headache for the past few days -- one that came with an itchy side-effect. It’s not, as they had previously thought, the result of a new shampoo from Paris, the one Harry had bought for Draco after one of his Auror missions.
“Harry!” Pansy exclaims, stepping out from the fireplace and making her way over. A few people in the crowd gaze appreciatively at her, and there’s even a flash from a camera, but Pansy ignores them.
“Draco is going to kill me,” Harry mutters. “He’s just left for St Mungo’s to have his head examined.”
“Draco, I’m sorry, you know I can’t. I always spend Christmas at the Burrow. I especially need to be there this year. Everyone is visiting Molly now that she has fully recovered from dragon pox. I can’t change my plans.”
Draco opened his eyes and immediately closed them again. His room was too bright and as he fumbled around searching for his wand, his teeth chattered because it was far colder than usual. He cast a warming spell and opened his eyes once more.
Draco nods, even though he doesn’t know how to use it. He picks up the calculator and feels a surge of energy, like he’s being shocked. He quickly drops the calculator and steps back.
The cold air hits his face as he steps outside and Draco looks up at the grey clouds where the snow is already coming down, painting everything white. Harry’s wish of a white Christmas came true. Draco casts the strongest Heating Charm he can, sticking his gloved hands deep in his pockets.
A sharp sound of breaking glass catches Amy’s attention and she says, “Let me know if you need any more help,” before walking away.
He was curious to find out what Harry’s ornament would be like this year. Would it include something about Draco?
Too late, Harry tries to defend Malfoy to his friends, but they aren’t paying him any attention as Hermione begins to scold Ron. As Harry gets up to join the crowd of single guests, he hears Ron tell Hermione, “He’s lying, Hermione. He’s just as single as Harry is now. Or else he would have brought a date to the wedding just to show off.”
Draco turns his head to the side. His boyfriend, Harry, is sound asleep next to him, one arm thrown protectively around Draco’s waist. He looks so free and young and unburdened of anything that has happened to him since the moment his parents died. The only signs that mark the troubles he’s had are the scars that decorate his body. Draco reaches out and traces the most famous one—a lightning bolt on his forehead.
For a moment, it looks like Harry is disappointed, but Draco can’t be sure as Harry quickly hides it with a small smile.
“There’s no one quite like Draco,” Harry says when they finally pull apart. “Did you know he eats pizza with a knife and fork?”
Draco hurried down the stairs. Why was it that Harry never followed any rules, even when it involved his own health?
All thoughts of that unpleasant encounter are pushed from his mind as the lift goes up. His thoughts flutter from how it’s almost Petunia’s birthday and the holiday he is overdue to take. He’s planning a nice trip to Barcelona when the lift suddenly stops. He’s the only one inside, so he jabs at the button, frowning. Miraculously, the door opens and he steps outside.
Harry adores his cats who, unfortunately, dislike Draco. In fact, the first few times Draco had come over to Harry’s flat, they had scratched his hands when he attempted to pet them and hissed every time they saw him. No amount of soothing belly rubs or scratches behind their ears could convince them to like him, except when he gives them cat treats. He still wouldn’t say that they are friendly, but at least they tolerate him
“I know you’re allergic to roses, but the bouquet doesn’t contain any! There aren’t any flowers, either! I thought you still deserved a bouquet, so I had Neville wrap these up for you.”
On the front page is an old photograph of Draco, taken just after the verdict from the Wizengamot that proclaimed him a free man. It’s always the same one the
Draco did not expect the silence, not when Harry had just been so animated a few minutes before. Harry sank back in his chair and stared sullenly down at the plate in front of him.
“I can’t either. Not anymore,” Harry says to a confused Dudley. “It turns out I was never supposed to be able to talk to snakes. That was a piece of magic transferred to me by the wizard who killed my parents.”
Draco spends the rest of the walk to Harry’s thinking about their conversation. On one hand, he’s ecstatic that Harry wants to introduce him to his family. As far as Draco knows, Harry’s never introduced any of his former partners. On the other hand, he’s a Malfoy, whose family has been feuding with the Weasleys for a long time.
, Draco thinks as he searches for the source of the song. The words, once joyful, now grate on his nerves as he searches all his pockets. He quickly fishes out the cell phone that Harry had bought him right before he left. Draco’s hardly used it as he has no one to ring except for Harry.
His stomach growled, reminding him that he had not eaten since arriving at the international departure point in Montreal. He had been looking forward to a homemade meal from Harry, but had to settle for a sandwich, something simple that he could make.
Charlie exhales loudly. “I wish there was a Pensieve around so I could show you properly. I was surprised, that’s all. You took me by surprise. Or perhaps I wanted to not believe what I had been suspecting for a while.”
Draco stills. “Harry?” he whispers. His names sounds like a sob on Draco’s lips. “Is it really you?” He blinks his eyes open slowly, trying to clear the sleep from his eyes and failing. It doesn’t stop him from trying to kiss Harry, missing his lips entirely and catching the edge of his jaw.
To make matters worse, Draco Malfoy chooses that moment to walk over to Harry’s table. Malfoy stands in front of the three friends with an eyebrow arched. He’s dressed in a Muggle three-piece suit with his hair not slicked back for once. The sight of him makes Harry’s heart beat faster.
Draco had his wand out and had the name of a spell on the tip of his tongue when he recognised Harry’s voice. He was spread out on his back, his arm in a sling, and he was not wearing his Auror uniform. Harry grimaced, but didn’t say anything or move even after Draco called out his name.
Harry smiled as he watched Ron throw a stick far into the distance. The dog, who was named Lucky, barked once before chasing after the stick. Ron said that they had adopted him soon after arriving in Australia. Back then, he and Hermione hadn’t known anyone and had felt incredibly lonely while they searched for her parents.
“You’re a little misguided and naïve, and wear your heart on your sleeve, but you’re not hopeless, Harry.” Charlie comes up and gives Harry a hug, one that feels like a final goodbye.
“Why do you need a present? If I remember correctly, you got everything you asked for on your birthday a month ago.” Harry smiles at the memory, one he still uses to conjure a Patronus. Harry had asked Draco to move in with him because he wanted to wake up and not worry that Draco wouldn’t be there in the morning. Draco had smiled and said, “Took you long enough, Harry,” before giving him the best blow jobs of his life.
“Of course you did,” Draco says quietly. Harry tries to turn around so that they can see each other properly, but Draco wraps his arms around Harry’s body, preventing him from moving.
“I don’t think that Ron and I, well, we talked about it and I don’t think we are going back anytime soon,” Hermione said, interrupting him from his thoughts.
“Are you sure I can’t convince you to cancel dinner with the Weasleys and instead stay here with me?” The question slips out before Draco can stop it, but he waits with bated breath for Harry’s response.
just for blinking. I care about you and don’t want you to get backlash from the public. They’ll spread lies and stories all the time just to ruin your life.”
Harry shook his head. “I was distracted because of this.” Harry reached into his pocket and handed him a slip of parchment. Draco only had to see that it was from the
“Ron and Hermione know it’s not true. All of my friends know that I can throw off the Imperious Curse.”
Hermione had told Draco that Harry, if left to his own devices, would start to decorate the minute Halloween was over. It wouldn’t be too much at first, a sprig of holly here and there, maybe a porcelain figurine on the kitchen table. However, it wouldn’t take long until Harry would drag a tree inside the house and insist on Draco helping him decorate.
“Wait! What do you mean? Charlie, come back!” The suitcase bursts open and Harry immediately withdraws his wand, trying to think of the perfect spell to use. A baby Niffler pokes its head out, staring at Harry with wide eyes.
and I understood why you felt that way. I seemed to have ruined your privacy with another one of my careless actions. I had half a mind to go and pack my things to leave.”
“And now? Do you still want to leave?” Harry asked. Again, he grabbed Draco’s arm as if he was afraid that Draco would Apparate away.
Harry nods. “When you mentioned how lonely you were at night while I’m away on Auror missions,” Harry says. “I know it’s not the same, but I hope this can help you.”
His hands shake as he tugs off his glove and presses the answer button, eager to talk to Harry. “Hello?” Draco says, ducking under the shop’s awning to get out of the rain. “Harry?”
Harry frowns when he hears his last name. “Sure it does. Since I helped Fred and George with the startup money they made me a silent partner and that means I help with the hiring process. You really only have to win over one person since we vote on whom we hire.”
“Come on, Pansy, it doesn’t hurt to look,” he says, walking over to the front door and pulling it open. “Perhaps there are better ones available.”
Draco scoffs and opens his eyes. “No one’s going to buy food from a Death Eater, Harry,” he begins, but Harry shakes his head.
“That’s it, Noel,” Draco says, waving the cat treat, “Step away from the jumper and I’ll give you this delicious treat.”
“Neville, I’m not sure that’s the right plant,” Harry says delicately. He’s relieved when Neville bursts out laughing.
By the time Draco arrives at Harry’s flat, he is completely soaked. Harry’s front door is painted bright red with a huge, handmade wreath with a lion’s head hanging on it. It’s a housewarming gift from Luna. The first time Draco had seen it, he had rolled his eyes. It was worse when Harry had tapped the lion’s nose with his wand and an instrumental version of “Weasley is Our King” had played along with synchronised flashing fairy lights. He has gotten used to the garish sight, but now wonders if he can add a snake to the wreath.
The barista’s smile dims as Vernon approaches the counter, but she still asks politely, “What will it be for you today, sir?”
Draco doesn’t get to finish his sentence because Harry’s lips are on his, kissing him as if his life depended on it. Draco eagerly returns the kiss, finding that he doesn’t actually mind Harry’s chapped lips, or the delicious burn of Harry’s stubble against his skin as he kisses his way to Draco’s ear.
Draco sees a couple walk by, kissing and holding hands and his heart clenches at the sight. All the while Harry’s been in Madrid, Draco has been thinking about asking Harry to finally reveal their relationship to their families. They haven’t exactly been hiding it, as their closest friends know they are dating, but they still only have dates in Muggle London.
“Come on!” Vernon mutters under his breath, but the blond man is still asking the barista many questions about the different types of coffee beans. The barista smiles at the blond man, talking in low tones, and glancing at him from under her eyelashes as a red blush appears on her cheeks.
Draco’s cheeks heat, but he’s spared from answering when a child runs by wearing a Santa hat. He looks over the customer’s head to find the Christmas section located in the back of the shop. He walks towards it, with Pansy following him.
Draco thought about sending an owl to Hermione, but decided against it. If she was not already up waiting for her husband to return, then he didn’t want to disturb her. She was heavily pregnant with her second child and already had a young daughter at home. She needed all the sleep she could get.
Vernon chokes on air, spilling the remainder of his tea on his hands. He yells and curses loudly, waving his hands to try to cool them faster. “Who are you? How did you get in here?”
Immediately Draco’s arms and legs start flailing, trying to escape the confines of Harry’s arms. “Stop! Let me go!” Draco cries out, twisting like a wild animal. “
Vernon twists the knob furiously, only to find that it will not turn. He starts pounding on the door, but hears Draco sigh behind him. When he turns around, Draco is staring lazily at him, a stick grasped in his hand.
Sleep does not come easy for Harry that night, but by sunrise the next morning, he has made a decision.
He reaches out and slowly takes the envelope, startling when the ferret squeaks and jumps off the table. Draco opens and scans the letter, his eyes widening when he sees what’s written. The contract states that he is to work with the Weasleys at their joke shop, but he has his own lab and can work on other projects in his spare time, if he so chooses.
The Great Hall, once silent, now breaks out into loud chatter and there’s even a camera flash coming from the direction of the Ravenclaw table. Draco hears Weasley call out “Harry!”, but nothing can distract him from the fact that they have revealed their relationship to everyone at Hogwarts. There’s no doubt now that news of them dating will make the front page of the
The huge Douglas fir tree in the corner doesn’t have a specific theme, but rather the branches are haphazardly decorated with tinsel, ribbons, twinkling fairy lights, or homemade ornaments according to Harry’s amusement. It’s only due to Draco’s meticulous charm work that the tree hasn’t fallen over.
“Now that’s hardly fair,” Harry protested, putting on his glasses. “I do know you, Draco, a lot better than I did at Hogwarts. For starters, you selected a job that wasn’t connected to anything you could do to improve your reputation. You didn’t wait for your parents to sort your life out even though they were the cause of most of your problems. You found something that you were passionate about and that’s really admirable. I’ve heard good things about you from Professor McGonagall and you know she doesn’t mince words.”
Harry immediately shook his head. “I don’t think I can,” he started to say. First and foremost there was Teddy to think about. It was already hard enough to be apart from his godson for this amount of time. And to bring Teddy with him to Australia was not something he could do to Andromeda. Besides—
Harry doesn’t fall to his knees; instead he hugs Draco around the waist and says, “As happy as you are right now, that’s how I want to make you feel for the rest of our lives. I love you, Draco Malfoy. Marry me?”
“After you,” Draco says, waving him forward with an exaggerated flourish. Vernon absolutely does not acknowledge him, instead going straight to the lifts. Before the doors close, he sees Draco checking in at the front desk.
Daisy nods, sighing deeply. “I’m having a little bit of trouble with my homework. We had a supply teacher today, which was no help at all since he didn’t know anything about teaching calculus. He just let us watch a film and sent us home with this worksheet.”
Harry scratches the back of his head. “Well, no, but Hermione helped me. You’ll have to ask her about the research she did in the Department of Mysteries.” He leans closer, tucking his head on Draco’s shoulder. “You actually gave me idea.”
Draco had placed a Stasis charm on the food and had come over to Harry. He helped him up and then used his wand to spell away the Floo powder, smoothing down the lines of his robes when he was done. Harry had stood extremely still, not breathing as he realised how close they were.
Draco shakes his head. “Today was the best day I ever had in a long time. I got to help Rose find all the Easter eggs.”
Harry stills, as if a bucket of ice water has been spilled down his back. He had spent months planning this party, consulting with friends and family and to think that it wasn’t perfect is a bit discouraging. Still, Harry can’t help but ask, “What’s missing?”
There’s only a few families that statement would apply to and as far as Neville knows, Harry is not friends with anyone whose family is part of the Sacred Twenty-Eight. Instead of a barrage of questions that Harry expects from all of his other friends, Neville just snorts. “Never figured you’d date a posh person, but good for you, Harry.”
With one last desperate grab at the jumper, Draco comes up empty handed and with a new scratch across his knuckles. Before he can grab his wand to heal it, Draco hears a loud
Amy looks at the two like they have lost their minds. “Goodness no! It’s too small. It wouldn’t even fit a newborn. Are you looking for baby outfits?”
As Harry had healed, he sought Draco’s company, first to thank him for saving him that night, and then just to talk. They had kept to safe topics such as their hopes and dreams for the future and not the war they were currently fighting. Draco had felt his childhood crush on Harry resurface the more they talked, until one day, shortly after Christmas, Draco had summoned the courage to kiss him.
“Sorry about that, Harry!” Neville says, removing a pair of yellow earmuffs before holding out a hand to help Harry up. Dirt is caked underneath Neville’s fingernails and Harry almost slips again when he grabs the sweaty palm.
“I’m sorry,” Harry says simply. “For so many things.” He twists the stems of the sunflowers for lack of a better thing to do. “I know that I haven’t been the best boyfriend and I didn’t want to hurt you, but it seems it’s all I’ve done so far.”
So for the past hour, he has been silently sitting at the table, watching Daisy scribble on several pages as he thinks of something to say. Harry is not due home anytime soon and Draco is tempted to Floo call Hermione to come for a visit if things don’t change.
“Like that’s such a hardship. You’re a fashion editor, always on the lookout for the latest designs. Admit it, you’ll enjoy this. Now, are you ready to go?”
“He’s still in the house, Harry,” Draco says, placing a hand on Harry’s shoulders. If Teddy is in trouble, he’ll need to be able to think clearly. “He probably just woke up and is hungry. If anything, he might have hurt himself in the kitchen trying to get breakfast.”
Harry nods. “My friends and family couldn’t understand how I could ever become friends with Draco, much less date him. To be honest, sometimes I think that they think that Draco is just a placeholder until I find someone else.” Harry runs a hand through his hair and sighs. When his eyes meet Pansy, he surprises her with the intensity of his gaze. “It’s never going to happen. The truth is, he’s very different from the spoilt boy at Hogwarts, more honest and vulnerable and I’m so honoured that he feels comfortable to show me that side of him. I learn something new about him every day and hope to continue for the rest of our lives.”
“Oh, ha! It’s edible gold with chocolate. Only the best for you, chosen one.” He continues laughing as he leans his head against Harry’s shoulder.
Harry has requested that they not use magic around Daisy to make her feel more comfortable. That means Draco has to stow his wand away as he gets home from work and pretend that his fingers don’t itch to reach for his wand whenever he doesn’t know what to do.
“This ornament is for you to decorate. Tomorrow, my godson Teddy is coming over to bake some biscuits and make hot cocoa and I was wondering if you would join us. I’ve been telling Teddy about you and he’s excited to meet you. Only if you want to, of course.”
Draco shakes his head. “No, nothing like that.” Before he can say anything else, Daisy appears in their entryway.
While Pansy’s lips are pressed thin at the mention of Lucius, Harry is quietly seething at the thought that Draco’s father is still trying to control his life. He doesn’t care about Lucius’ opinion of him, but as Draco’s only surviving family member, he can understand why Draco would be devastated at his own family rejecting him.
“Where did you find this?” Harry asks. He spreads the jumper over his lap. Noel and Holly immediately bat their paws at the loose yarn, but Harry shoos them away.
“I'm telling you the truth. I know we got married at nineteen, when everyone told us we were too young, but we proved them wrong. I love you now just as much as I did then, Draco, and I think it’s time we renew our vows.”
Harry cleared his throat to loosen the lump stuck in there. “Actually, I don’t even know if that last part is true. We never had a chance to talk about our relationship.” Harry looked away before he could see a pitying look on Hermione’s face.
“I heard you broke my brother’s heart,” Harry hears a voice say behind him. Before he can turn around to see who it is, there’s a wand jabbed between his shoulder blades. “If you give me one good reason why, then maybe I won’t cast a Bat Bogey Hex on you.”
“Oh, I’m so sorry,” the blond man says mockingly, “I am unaware that three people behind me constitutes as a long queue. By all means, as I am still undecided, I will allow the two women behind you to place their order because they are not rude. Perhaps by the time they are done, I will have decided what I want, and you can order after me. If you don’t want that to happen, then you can wait.” He turns around before Vernon can say anything, but the two women behind Vernon start laughing.
Harry’s green eyes gleam in the darkness and Draco can’t help but lean forward and press his hand against Harry’s cheek and kiss him deeply in response.
“I tried to help Daisy with her calculus homework and I didn’t understand anything, so I did the best I could and used magic.”
Harry shoves his hands in his pocket to reach for the fake Galleon that connects to an identical one Draco carries with him. To his relief, the coin is not burning as it would have if Draco is in danger. He opens his mouth to tell Pansy that, but she grabs his arm and pulls him into an empty powder room.
Instead of angel at the top of the tree, Harry had placed the constellation Canis Major that was suspended inside an orb, with each star represented by a small crystal. “I use this to honor my godfather,” Harry said. “I didn’t have much time with him, but I never forgot every piece of advice he ever told me. Which reminds me. Here,” Harry said, placing a transparent ornament in his hand. The accidental touch startled Draco, who did his best not to let the ornament fall.
“No, let me finish. You have been nothing but civil since I came here. Then last night, when you wouldn’t even look at me, it had me thinking what I could have done to warrant such a reaction. Then I saw the
“I thought you would have returned to your job as soon as possible,” Draco said, sitting down and unpacking the box of decorations. He watched Harry struggle with the tree, trying to drag it next to the window, the branches seeming to smack Harry the entire time he moved. Draco finally gave in and levitated the tree to the correct spot.
No matter what he felt, he still had to go check up on Harry.  Draco reluctantly changed into a thick jumper, one that Mrs Weasley had knitted for Harry, and walked to Harry’s room. The door was ajar but there was no one when he peered inside. On the nightstand were several different coloured potions, all sealed. Draco scowled. Trust Harry to ignore his Healer’s orders.
Neville laughs. “What kind of herbologist would I be if I didn’t know that? Besides, it’s one of the things Grandmother insisted I learn when she saw how serious I was about Herbology. I never thought you would ask about floriography. Isn’t that a bit out of fashion?”
Harry uses his wand to levitate the crystal ball in front of them before twirling his fingers above the glass like he had seen Muggle magicians do. White smoke swirls inside the glass, following wherever Harry’s fingers move.
Harry knew he had a crush on Draco Malfoy. They might have been polite and awkward housemates when Draco had first moved in, but Harry had felt their friendship develop as time passed by.
Draco was thankful for the change in subject. “What about your arm?” he asked, despite following Harry into the living room.
for more than a month, ever since the war’s tenth year anniversary. The undercover Auror mission had taken longer than expected, and during that time Harry couldn’t owl or communicate with anyone.
“Because Muggles have been dealing with it since the beginning of time. It’s practically a rite of passage. Didn’t the healers at St Mungo’s treat you? I’m sure their treatment is much more effective than the Muggle way.”
Instead, he stared at Harry, trying to decipher if Harry was telling the truth. He wouldn’t risk revealing his feelings until he knew for certain. Without the glasses on his face, Harry looked a bit shy and vulnerable as he waited for Draco’s reaction.
Draco looks even more frightened, so Harry stops in his tracks with his hands held out in front of him. “Don’t leave. Please. At least let me say something first and then if you decide to leave, I won’t stop you.”
Draco nods, stepping aside, not trusting his voice to remain steady if he were to talk. As Harry brushes past him into the living room, Draco smells the faint woodsy cologne that makes him weak in the knees. He’s pretty sure that if he were to brew Amortentia, Harry’s cologne would be one of the scents that would rise from the potion.
! Draco thinks. He training to be a veterinarian; he should be used to all kinds of creatures, especially if he hopes to pass his exams tomorrow.
Being without magic has never been a problem for Harry since he grew up in the Muggle world. For Draco, it’s a bit harder. He’s not worried about breaking the Statute of Secrecy because the Dursleys know he’s a wizard. He’s more concerned about trying to find common interests with a teenager. After all, at her age, he was trying to survive a megalomaniac whilst plotting to kill his headmaster.
When Louis had seen no progress with his gestures, he had taken to accidentally touching Draco, whether it be leaning against him whilst they read documents, or clasping their hands together to pull through the crowded hallways.
“Sure,” Harry says. He’s never seen Draco eat anything with his bare hands, so this will be interesting to watch.
“A tree,” Draco repeated. “You went out this morning, in this storm, for a tree? And you decided to drag it here with your hurt arm?”
“I know, Pansy. I don’t know how they will react to finding out I’m dating their adoptive son. The feud between our families is deep, even if you don’t include being on the wrong side of the war. That’s why I need everything to be perfect, even if it’s as simple as finding a jumper to wear to their Christmas dinner. So will you help me?”
“That better not be a joke, Potter. I am literal perfection. No artist could ever come close to capturing what I look like,” Draco says, crossing his arms against his chest.
Noel emerges slowly, her tail swishing back and forth, her eyes never looking away from the cat treat. Draco lowers his hand and Noel snatches the treat in her mouth before scurrying off. As Draco looks back to the tree, he sees Holly’s amber eyes staring at him from between the stacked presents. She yawns wide, before sinking her claws into the jumper and tearing it.
“Why is Draco wearing Weasley’s tie? Is this a joke?” Pansy demands, waving the Gryffindor tie in Harry’s face. Draco would have been amused by the look on her face if it weren’t for the fact that she’s pulling it a bit too hard and he struggles to breathe.
Harry takes a deep breath, exhaling slowly. “Look, I know it’s shit timing, but this is the first time I’ve seen Charlie in months. He didn’t come home for Christmas, remember?”
“Still, I sent off the letter, hoping that even if Daisy wasn’t a witch, then at least I could try to mend things between us. I understand if it’s not possible.”
“Yeah, you know him,” Harry began, “but not really. I know I’m not making sense, but I don’t know where to begin.”
“I’m glad that you do because I know it shows that you care,” Draco says, lifting Harry’s chin up. Harry’s green eyes stare at him with love that he’d never thought he’d find. While Harry may have been denied love while he was a child, Draco intends to make sure that Harry never forgets how many people love him now.
“Hey, no!” Draco shouts, reaching over to pick her up, but she quickly leaps away, running out with the jumper in her mouth.
Draco sits down at the desk, ready to pick up his quill and book and resume revising. He flips through the pages, all the while feeling Harry’s eyes on him.
In the week since that kiss, Malfoy had been cordial, as if Harry’s lapse of judgement had never happened. Harry, however, had not forgotten.
His old self-preservation instinct kicked back in and he tugged his hand away from Harry’s grip and stood up. “It would have never worked, Harry. Your friends don’t even like me and you value their opinion,” Draco said. “We’re too different.”
, Harry thinks. Out loud he says, “Sorry, Teddy. I was surprised at what your grandmother just told me.” He combs his fingers through his godson’s turquoise hair to see signs of what Andromeda just told him, but Teddy’s scalp is healthy and there are no signs of irritation.
Harry finds Draco in their bedroom, sitting on the edge of the bed. He has a silk bed sheet wrapped around his body, with only his head peeking out. Even though Harry is nude, Draco seems the most vulnerable at the moment. Harry watches him, trying to choose the words that will cause no more miscommunication.
“I promised to do that when I married you,” Draco says, grasping Harry’s hand. “I haven’t regretted it yet.”
Harry’s Muggle relative, Daisy Dursley, is staying in their home while her parents are on holiday in Japan celebrating their twentieth wedding anniversary. Draco has no problems with Daisy; she’s been pleasant all week, helping out with chores and generally keeping out of trouble. At sixteen, she’s funny and smart, especially in mathematics. If Harry is to be believed, Daisy is nothing like her father when he was that age.
“Believe me, I was surprised, too,” Harry replies, glad that it’s a hot day and the heat in his cheeks can easily be explained away.
When he hears the crack of Apparition, Harry runs up the stairs and into their bedroom, trying to catch his breath as he leans against the door frame, rubbing a stitch in his side. The air smells of strong disinfectant, the bed is stripped bare, the curtains are taken down, and there is a house elf trying to catch all of the clothes that are being thrown out of the closet.
“We’re making a rocket and I want it go higher than anyone else’s,” Daisy says, grabbing Draco’s hand and tugging him further into the house.
“Then a few weeks ago, you started writing to me again. You and Malfoy were helping Luna plan her wedding.” Charlie turns away from Harry to look out the window and his voice gets quieter as he continues talking. “You know, Ron used to tease you about talking so much about Malfoy at Hogwarts. I never realised how true that was until I saw it with my own eyes. You broke up with me because of Malfoy, right?”
There’s a sigh and then a jingling of the keys as Draco pulls them out and inserts them in the door knob. He pushes the door open and waves Harry through.
Harry holds up his hands. “Fine, if you don’t want the statue, then I’m going to put it in my office.” He steps closer to Draco, brushing his hair out of the face. He’s finally able to see Draco clearly for the first time. “Don’t tell me you’re jealous of a statue.”
Draco stands up, smoothing down his robes before offering a hand for them to shake. “Ronald, George, thank you for--“
“Oh,” Harry says, scooting back on the bed until he’s against the headboard and motions for Draco to join him. Draco settles down with his head in Harry’s lap and closes his eyes.
After the third giggle that escapes from her mouth, Vernon's had enough. “For Christ’s sake, stop flirting! Can’t you see there's a long queue?” he shouts at the barista. “Open another register!”
Draco buries his head against Harry’s neck, the short hairs tickling Harry. “Well, let’s try not to have an argument for a year, then. I want us to enjoy this holiday.”
Draco immediately settles down at Harry’s side, placing his head directly over Harry’s heart. “Promise me you’re not a dream and you’ll still be here in the morning.” His words come out low and unsure, yet seem loud in the silent room.
“I’m sorry, what was that?” Draco sat down across from Harry and leaned forward in his chair in case Harry decided to speak softly again.
“It’s okay, Sunny!” A girl’s voice calls out. “You’re okay!” The door opens and a black Labrador jumps on Draco, trying to lick him all over his face. Right behind the dog is a brown haired girl with blue eyes exactly like Dudley’s.
Draco reaches into his pocket and pulls out a vial filled with a pale orange liquid. “The cure is to drink three doses for the next twenty-four hours. It kills everything.”
reveals their family clock, another gift from the Weasleys, cradled protectively against Draco’s chest.
“I know that I had to do it as soon as possible or I would continue to put it off just like I have the previous times. I wasn’t thinking, Hermione. I’ll admit it though, it’s not my proudest moment.”
Draco smiles, holding Harry against him, brushing away a smudge of spice of his cheeks. “I am. The assignment was far easier than I thought. How was your day?”
He sleep was interrupted by bits of tossing and turning and waking up because he thought he heard Harry calling out to him. The first time he had stumbled out of bed and checked, he found that Harry had locked the door with spells that a simple
ing and traveling of the Floo Network, or the uncertainty of what awaits them in Pansy’s flat. He just hopes that nothing terrible has happened.
“What are you doing? You’re not supposed to be using your arm for anything,” Draco said. He flicked his wand to make the tree lightweight and then dragged the rest inside, slamming the door behind him. Harry took off his hat and gloves and started unraveling the scarf from around his neck. His eyes sparkled and his face was red from the cold wind.
Harry doesn’t know what to think. He never thought he would see the day that Dudley Dursley would ask for forgiveness. Harry only remembers the spoiled bully that thought the world belonged to him, but the letter shows that Dudley has grown up and now has a family of his own. He has a daughter who might possibly be a witch and rather than shun her, like Uncle Vernon did with Harry, Dudley wants to help her.
“To be honest,” Ron says, “I’m surprised Mum hasn’t come over here to start questioning you. The last thing she knew, you and Charlie were in relationship bliss!”
When she throws down her pencil in frustration, Draco can’t ignore it anymore and he sets down the potions journal. “Is there something wrong?”
It’s funny to hear Dudley be scared to say a word that has become a part of Harry’s identity. Still, Harry has promised himself that he will listen to everything his cousin has to say before offering his advice.
“Get away from the rattlesnake and cover the wound with a clean bandage. Call the local emergency number and get an antivenin shot as soon as possible. If you’re a wizard, just take a potion that will remove all traces of the venom. I believe that Professor Snape would have had a better chance of survival if he had had the potion on hand when he was attacked by Nagini.”
Draco frowns, unimpressed. “I hate to mention it to you, Harry, but in case you’ve forgotten, you’ve already married me,” Draco says, waving his hand in front of them. The gold band glints in the light.
Harry’s shoulders sag and he lets out a breath he hadn’t realised he had been holding in. “No one, Ginny,” he says at last and tries to give her the bouquet, but Ginny refuses.
“How did you get rid of them?” Draco asks, crossing his arms against his chest. “Surely you’ve had them once or twice when you were a child?”
Now that he can’t put it off any longer, Draco kneels in front of the fireplace and Floo calls Pansy, hoping it’s not too early as she doesn’t like to be woken up without good reason. However, this is an emergency.
“Er, thank you, Draco,” Harry says, taking the gold Snitch out of the box. He waits a few seconds for it to open its wings and fly, except it doesn’t move at all. Harry looks at Draco curiously. “I think it’s broken.”
“What? No! What are you saying?” he hisses. But he can’t deny the truth as he looks down to see gold stitching on the Gryffindor tie.
“Harry, the blame is on both of us. We should have talked more instead of falling into bed whenever we had the chance to see each other. But a relationship is not going to be easy. You have to work at it. Perhaps you’ll have better luck with Malfoy.”
Draco could hear them go slowly up the creaking stairs, which didn’t do much to drown out the rush of thoughts that came out in his head. The most important one was:
They walk to the kitchen and through the window, Harry can see Draco and Dudley’s wife and daughter in the center of the yard. Daisy is speaking to Draco, who is kneeling down on the grass and is paying strict attention to Daisy, despite Sunny trying to lick his face again. In his hands he holds a plastic bottle filled with a clear liquid. If Harry remembers correctly, the liquid is vinegar and when mixed with bicarbonate of soda, will cause the rocket to launch into the air.
Pansy frowns, as she doesn’t enjoy travelling by car. “Let me take you to Paris, Draco. You can’t go wrong with the fashion in Paris,” Pansy says excitedly.
“The first time I saw that, I was shocked and picked her up and took her to the kitchen to get away. At the time, I thought it was a trick of the mind, but then Daisy kept levitating different things: her teddy bear, chocolate sweets Julia had hidden from her, and even Sunny’s lead to go for a walk. I didn’t know how to mention it to my wife, because things only ever happened when it was just Daisy and me. Until one day Julia saw Daisy have a tantrum and make a dinner plate shatter without even touching it. That’s when I had to tell her that magic is real.”
“Finally,” Harry had whispered, before kissing him again. They kept their relationship a secret so it wouldn’t be used against Harry whilst they were still fighting a war. Not even Granger knew, which was a miracle considering how many times they had almost been caught shagging.
“It could be, if you let it, Harry. You’re more alike than you realise. You’re both stubborn, refuse to back down from what you believe in, and are both loyal to friends and family. You are suited for each other and I would say he thinks the same about you.” Luna goes around to Harry’s side and kisses him on the cheek. “Thank you again, Harry.”
“Oh,” Neville says, biting his lips. “That’s a shame. Roses would be easier to use on such short notice. I can put together a bouquet that tells a story, but if I can’t use roses, I’ll take that as a challenge. Tell me a little bit about him, if you don’t mind.”
“But I can’t let him do that. Why burden him with me if my past is going to shadow us forever? I’d rather break up with him now before I ruin his life ever further. It’s never going to be an easy life if he stays with me.”
Draco smiles at Harry’s words. He does have a near perfect record for saving his patients. “All right, Harry. I’ll owl my mother to let her know I am joining you at the Burrow. That means we’ll have to have dinner with my parents. Are you ready for that?”
“Draco?” Harry asks and after a few curse words are said, Draco steps out of the closet. He addresses the house elf first, not bothering to look in Harry’s direction.
Draco peers down at the page. “It’s right here,” he says, absentmindedly using a spare quill from his pocket to circle the letter in question. “Is this supposed to be hard?”
“Honestly, Harry. You still can’t exit a Floo gracefully? We practised and you’re making me look bad.”
“Don’t worry about it, Harry. Just learn from your mistakes,” Charlie says, using his wand to cancel all the spells he cast before leaving.
Draco has forgotten that pupils’ names are stitched on the back of clothing to help the house-elves return them to the correct owner. Horror fills his stomach and he slowly looks up to find Weasley at the Gryffindor table. Granger is rubbing circles on his back as Weasley tries to breathe between coughs, tears streaming down his face that’s as red as his hair.
“For Harry’s two cats. A sort of payback for what they’ve done.” He doesn’t mention it to Pansy, but dressing the cats is something that Harry will find adorable. It will be worth it to see the smile on his face when he sees Holly and Noel dressed as reindeers vying for his attention.
A wave of sadness that Draco doesn’t feel comfortable at the moment is overtaken by the anger that Harry feels. As soon as Harry sees for himself that Draco is safely back home, he’s going to make sure that Rita Skeeter never picks up another quill again
Agreeing with Ron was something that Draco never thought he would do, but there was always a first time for everything. “I second that. Harry, as a Gryffindor, you wear your emotions on your sleeve. It’s an unfortunate trait, but in the months that I have been saying here, you haven’t said a word. You’ve been in a relationship with another person for longer than that. Whatever you feel for me is simply not real.”
He quickly tells her what happened, and by the time he has finished, she can’t stop laughing. “If I didn’t know any better, I’d think those cats had planned it all along. They really do hate you.”
“Keep it,” Draco replies, helping Pansy out of the car, closing the door as the driver wishes them a happy Christmas.
Luna smiles and twirls once, causing her dress to billow out. “I absolutely love it! I’m so glad that you and Draco were able to leave things in the past and start anew as friends. I wouldn’t be surprised if it became something more. I see the way you look at him, Harry.”
It’s a rare occasion that Harry manages to surprise Draco. The last time it happened, Harry had asked him out on a date. Draco’s response now is the same question he had asked Harry many months ago.
Harry shrugs his shoulders. “It wasn’t so bad. Malfoy’s not as big of a prick nowadays. He’s the reason why this wedding was a success. If it were just me, today would have been a disaster.”
They turn a corner and that’s when he sees the mannequins in the window shop. They are tall, no facial features, pale, but, most importantly, they are dressed in Christmas jumpers.
Harry can’t listen to this anymore. He barges into the room and immediately Draco stands up with his wand drawn, a reaction ingrained in him from the war. He’s standing with his back ramrod straight, but his wand shakes ever so slightly. His eyes go wide as he looks at Harry and he retreats until he hits the wall. Harry can see that he’s thinking about Disapparating, so he rushes forward with a “Draco, no!”
“Teddy, dear, Draco is an only child and he hasn’t been around children that much. Give him a little more time and you’ll see that he likes you just as much as Harry does.”
. After that, Draco had not dared to try touching the presents for fear of risking an unexpected hair colour change.
Harry comes around the sofa and sinks into it, his side pressed against Draco as he wraps his arms around Draco’s waist. He murmurs against Draco’s ear, “Is it true? You’re pregnant?”
Harry thinks about Draco’s words all the way to their bedroom. Like Draco had said, their bed looks like it hasn’t been slept in a while. Harry wandlessly pulls the duvet down and gently lays Draco down on the silk sheets. He protests when Harry lets go, an anguished look on his face.
Draco is at a loss for words. Meeting the Weasleys is daunting by itself, but that Harry wants him to feel comfortable in a room full of people who by all rights might hate him is incredibly touching.
“This is not helping you at all, Potter,” Draco says through clenched teeth. “If you go any further, those might be the last words you say,” Draco warns.
Hidden just behind the door, Harry struggles to hold back and not to barge in as Draco lets out a noise of distress.
. Rita Skeeter hasn’t printed anything newsworthy recently and no one believes her. You are the best person for this job.” Harry points to the books and journals on the table. “I’ve seen some of your ideas and think you’ll be a great asset to the shop.”
Harry scratches behind her ears, stopping when he spots the blue yarn twisted around her body. His eyes grow wide before he gently pulls the blue jumper away from Holly's body.
“Harry broke his arm because he wasn’t paying attention on a raid and had to have his arm mended. He has some potions to take if any pain persists,” Ron said.
, Draco thinks, grinning. He loves surprises and gifts, particularly if it’s one of Mrs Weasley’s desserts. He quickly unlocks the door, saying “Come in, Teddy.”
“I think it’s a pun on a Muggle Christmas song,” Draco says, taking the pink jumper from her and holding it against his body. It’s too big on him, but he’ll buy it anyway because it’s too good to pass up. “What if I wore this the next time I had dinner with my parents? Can you imagine the look on my father’s face? He still can’t accept that I’m gay.”
She’s too quick, darting around furniture. He grabs for the jumper several times, but comes up empty-handed. He arrives at the living room just in time to see Holly’s tail disappear underneath the Christmas tree. Harry’s other cat, Noel, stares at him, her dark fur unaffected by Harry’s
“Harry, thank you. I would love to wear this tomorrow.” Draco holds up the jumper to examine it further. There are holes and part of the right sleeve is unravelling, not to mention how dirty it’s become. “Is there a way to fix it with magic?”
“The thing is, everyone is curious to know why, but they won’t outright ask you because we’re at Luna’s wedding and they don’t want to be rude. However, I figured since I’m your best friend, you could tell me anything,” Ron says, grabbing a floating plate containing a slice of wedding cake. He doesn’t wait for Harry to answer as he digs into the slice, spearing the fruit onto his fork. It really is a masterpiece, fruits and nuts cut up in the shape of magical creatures and judging from the groans and soft sighs coming from Ron, it tastes just as delicious as it looks.
“Julia insisted we take her to her paediatrician to have a physical because she wanted to make sure that Daisy had a clean bill of health. The doctor told us that her results were all normal and that nothing was wrong with Daisy. Julia convinced me to write you a letter and then to wait and see what you recommend.”
“A couple of Death Eaters sliced him open as we left the Manor!” Weasley had shouted, glaring at Draco as if it were his fault.
“Hello, Harry. Hermione and Ron would have come, but Rose needed to be fed so I came to see if you were all right after what happened out there.”
“I know everything,” Draco murmurs against Harry’s neck. He doesn’t offer any explanation, instead choosing to massage Harry’s neck and shoulders. Harry groans as Draco’s long fingers dig deep into his skin, working out the stress that has accumulated this past week.
That explained why Harry wasn’t home when Draco arrived a few hours earlier. Harry was injured on the job and it was serious enough to warrant him admittance to St Mungo’s. “Is there anything I can do? If you’re hungry, Harry, I can make you sandwich. I’m afraid there’s not much else.”
Draco sighed. He had spent three weeks abroad and had forgotten about the time difference between Montreal and London. It was three in the morning and no sane person would be awake right now. Perhaps Harry was out on the field and hadn’t had time to leave a note.
“Be careful!” Harry exclaims, rushing towards Malfoy. “Why did you do that? The Niffler hasn’t done anything to you.”
“Do you like it?” Draco asks. When Harry nods, he continues, “I saw them in Paris last month when I visited Pansy. I thought it would be perfect for you.”
“All right there, Harry?” Hermione asked as she set down a cup of tea and a plate of biscuits on the counter in front of him. Her bushy hair was tied up in a bun and although she had a smile on her face, Harry could see the shadows underneath her eyes and the way she tried to hide her yawn. Harry didn’t blame her for being tired. The whole reason that she and Ron were in Australia was to find her parents and to try to restore their memories. So far there had been little progress, but Hermione was not giving up.
Harry took a sip of his cold tea and sighed. “Nothing. Everyone thinks that I’m heartbroken. I’m really not. Nick is nice. Boring, but nice and predictable. After the life I’ve had, maybe that should be enough. But it’s not.”
As Ginny, Ron and Pansy have an animated conversation about Ron’s birthday party, Harry turns to look at Draco properly. “Are you enjoying yourself?” Harry asks reaching over to wipe a smear of icing off the corner of Draco’s mouth. His eyes darken as he watches Draco licking his lips.
“Why don’t you go and take a shower, Teddy. You can help me with dinner and then eat those delicious biscuits Grandma Molly made,” Harry says, to which Teddy eagerly nods and runs out of the room.
Spending all that time together had changed Harry’s perspective of Malfoy and he found that he wanted to know this new Malfoy away from a professional setting. In fact, a week ago right after the rehearsal dinner, Harry had wanted to ask if Malfoy would go to Luna’s wedding as Harry’s date.
had written countless articles about them, until Harry had threatened to sue them for endangering the Aurors.
The smaller pile that remains is just clothes. A splash of red stands out from the pile, looking very familiar and upon closer inspection, Harry sees that it’s his threadbare t-shirts, his jeans with holes in the knees, and a pair of trainers with the sole starting to rip apart.
. He slams his office door shut after instructing his secretary not to disturb him for the rest of the day.
“Harrods?” Pansy repeats, stepping inside the taxi as Draco opens the door for her. “Isn’t that where Mrs Zabini’s fourth husband was a silent partner?”
The pile of gifts under the tree is stacked high as Harry seems to have bought out the entire shop for his friends and family. They are wrapped in shiny, bright paper that tempts Draco into shaking the packages. The first time Harry had caught him, he had returned the gift and had cast a
Draco won’t admit it, but he’s nervous. He brushes imaginary lint off of his new robes, smoothing down an already crisp white shirt. For good measure, he uses his wand to polish his dragon hide boots. He’s even slicked his hair back with too much gel and hair potions. He needs this interview to go well.
Ron Weasley, who did have his red uniform on that was covered in tears and dark stains that looked like blood, stood up and offered Harry a hand.
“No, just be the person you are when you’re with me. Play with him and ask him a lot of questions, but most of all, love him for who he is and not for the person you expect him to be. Maybe then he won’t curse you with lice.”
“Are you sure?” Pansy and the driver ask at the same time. They both have sceptical looks on their faces, but when Draco nods and says, “absolutely,” the driver pulls over to the kerb.
“They haven’t destroyed any of my clothes yet,” Draco says. “And they let me feed them so they won’t starve.”
Ron walked over to the fireplace and grabbed a pinch of Floo powder. “Harry’s already agreed to it.”
“Hello!” she says with a wide smile, trying to pull the dog back by the collar. “Sunny’s a good boy, good dog! He doesn’t bite!”
“Not now, Sir Cadogan,” Draco says, rolling his eyes “I’m late! When Harry wakes up, tell him I’m eating breakfast with Pansy,” Draco calls out over his shoulder.
Harry smiled. “Of course. Family is important to me and I wouldn’t have offered if I didn’t agree. Now, are you ready to light the tree?”
Ron, despite his rather impressive imitation of his mother, nervously looks around as soon as he finishes speaking. Despite being a decorated war hero, he’s never lost the fear of angering his mother. He breathes a sigh of relief and asks Harry, “Did Charlie ever tell you if he received the Howler?”
Harry smiles ruefully. “Yes, it was supposed to be a surprise. I’ve told you how every year Molly Weasley knits her family jumpers for Christmas?”
Harry drags his fingers across his scalp, wincing in pain, but wanting desperately to get rid of the grime that had accumulated during his undercover mission. He had spent the last seven days all across Italy, hiding in abandoned buildings, rarely sleeping, and eating the most horrid meals as his team had trailed a group of illegal potions dealers. Months of tracking down the potions dealers had paid off when they had finally caught them trying to sell to an undercover Auror in Venice.
, Draco thinks briefly before smiling. “Harry, you’re home!” Draco says, rushing over to greet him. He quickly kisses the bemused expression on Harry’s face, trying to give him a proper hug despite the bags that Harry is carrying. Harry tastes like peppermint from the Muggle gum he always chews. Draco steps back to properly look at him. Harry’s wearing his normal clothes, no Auror uniform in sight and he breathes a sigh of relief that there are no visible injuries. “Thank Merlin! You will not believe the day I just had. Never leave me again!”
“What’s this?” Ron asks, gesturing at the books. He grabs one and opens it and Draco barely refrains from wincing, hoping that there are no stains on the pages. Those are his person journals and books that contains plans, if he’s successful, of earning a good honest living and not relying on the Malfoy family fortune.
“Just a misunderstanding,” Draco says, watching as the scratch heals within seconds. “To be honest, I’m surprised that it’s not worse. If I didn’t know any better, I’d say that Holly and Noel are starting to like me.”
Draco stumbles backwards in his haste to get away, plowing into the small coffee table. He cries out as a corner of the table sharply jabs the back of his knees, causing him to lose his balance.
Draco closes his eyes when he hears the question. He can’t bear to look at Harry because then he would immediately blurt out that yes, he feels the same, has done for years. Draco can’t admit to Harry that he can’t quite believe that they have become friends, even if they haven’t told anyone yet. Being friends has to be enough; Draco can’t hope for the impossible because the rejection would hurt far more than the pain of being branded with the Dark Mark.
It had kept him out of the public eye, which was what he needed, and it had kept him busy. He mended the pages and spines of books, made sure that the book covers were restored and gleamed like new, and redid the print in the book so that it was no longer faded. The last thing he did was place new preservation spells so that the books could not fall apart as easily. All of the books that he had worked on were donated to the Hogwarts library. It would in no way forgive his actions during the war, but it was a start.
“Yes,” Harry said quietly. When Draco turned to ask him another question, he found that Harry was looking not at the Christmas tree, but at him.
“Are you actually talking to me now?” Draco said as he made himself another cup of tea. “Or are we going to pretend that nothing happened?”
Just as he’s about to faint, Vernon hears the barista call out “Tea for Vernon!” and Draco finally looks away. Vernon grabs his tea and avoids Draco’s gaze, too afraid that whatever just occurred will happen again. Vernon flees the shop as fast as he can.
They had saved the tree for last. Harry had carefully strung lights and tinsel with such precision that Draco suspected he had used magic despite claiming otherwise. Candy canes, colourful popcorn strings, and large bows hung from each branch. Each handmade ornament was gently placed on the branches. Harry had even charmed miniature Snitches to fly around the tree.
Draco, however, doesn’t feel cold. Excitement builds up in his chest as he points to the window shop. “Look at this, Pansy, and tell me what you think. Look at what they’re wearing.”
“When you moved in to help me with the library, many of my friends had doubts. They thought that we wouldn’t last a week working together, given our history. I liked the person you have become. You are someone who is a terrible cook and watches Muggle films in secret.”
“Harry, you haven’t hurt me,” Charlie says. When Harry makes a noise of protest, Charlie holds up his hand. “Or angered me, or even upset me, or anything that’s going around in your mind at the moment.”
“I’m surprised you didn’t hang any mistletoe,” Draco said, arranging the poinsettias. The plants were unlike anything Draco had ever seen in Herbology, but Harry had assured him that all they did was wave and dance if someone sang to them. He hadn’t demonstrated, citing his less-than-stellar singing, but his cheeks had turned slightly pink.
Ginny laughs and laughs until there are tears streaming down her face. “Merlin, Harry, you have the strangest luck. Only you would go from breaking up with your boyfriend in the morning to being practically engaged by the end of the night. Who’s the lucky person?”
Harry nods. “It took me by surprise, but in a good way. So can you help me? I don’t want to use roses or, preferably, any flowers. I want it to be something different. Something he’ll definitely remember.”
“I can’t. Robards ordered me to take a few days off to recuperate. He probably thought that I would stay in bed, but I’d rather decorate instead. Much better for my state of mind.”
“It looks like we need somewhere more private. So don’t go into the garden for the next half hour,” Draco says, winking.
“It’s too big without you next to me,” Draco mumbles against Harry’s neck, the rest of his body trembling in his embrace. “I didn’t want to be alone. You were gone for so long I thought you were going to miss my birthday this year.”
“I won’t, Draco. I just want to change out of this uniform,” Harry says. Harry quickly strips down and changes into joggers and threadbare Holyhead Harpies tshirt and settles down on his back, pulling the duvet over both of them.
“What are you doing?” Harry cries out, already pulling out the several Weasley jumpers that he loves. “You can’t throw those away. Those are my clothes. What am I going to wear?”
When Draco finally looks away from the pile of ash on the floor, his eyes are brimmed with tears. He looks at the box in Harry’s hand for a second before gazing into Harry’s eyes. Harry’s heart beats rapidly as the seconds go by.
“I’m so glad you enjoy my misery,” Draco deadpans. He holds up his hand and shows it to her. “Believe it or not, I had a scratch here. It’s like they went mad when they saw the jumper and anytime I tried to take it away, they would hiss and claw my hand. Harry didn’t tell me until later it’s because he spilled some catnip onto the jumper.”
Harry opens his mouth to respond, but then immediately closes it. He can’t think of anything to say that won’t make him seem heartless, and besides, all Ron did is state the truth.
Harry’s bright green eyes blink nervously at him. “I know you’re allergic to roses and I didn’t know your favourite chocolates, but I hope you like these,” Harry says, holding out a bouquet.
did not reveal a note from Harry. Still, Draco walked through the house, opening and closing each door until he returned to the kitchen.
Harry nods and they run down the stairs to the kitchen, pausing at the threshold to catch their breaths.
had finally left Privet Drive for good. For an entire year, his family had been placed in protective custody and cut off from the entire world. Even after the Dursleys had been released, there had been several times that Vernon couldn’t shake off the thought that any single oddity was the result of
“If you knew that you were going to hire me, then what was the point of all this,” Draco says at last, pointing at the ferrets who are now running around their ankles chasing each other.
Amy nods. “That’s a popular choice. I think that’s the last one. Let me go grab that jumper for you.”
Harry looks at Malfoy, wondering what would happen next. In the past, Malfoy would have hexed all three of them without hesitation. Now, his cheeks have turned pink, but he still holds his head up high when he says, “Not that it’s any of your business, Weasley, but you’d be surprised at the offers.”
Draco had met Nick several times in passing, but had only ever really talked about Quidditch scores with him. Draco agreed that he was nothing special, but he did treat Harry right. As far as Draco knew, he could find no major fault with him. Harry never said anything negative about Nick. He did with Draco, when they had reminisced about the Hogwarts and what utter prats they both had been. But Draco deserved that.
Harry’s face heats up as he avoids Neville’s gaze and rubs the back of his neck. “Well, tonight I have a date with someone whose family probably invented it and I want to impress them with a bouquet.”
Harry beams at him. “I’ve had one or two of those in my lifetime.” He Summons the crystal ball again and holds it out for Draco to take. “This is actually your birthday present.”
“It’s so silly, you know, to still call Draco by his last name, don’t you think?” Her grey eyes peer down at him and Harry can’t reply with anything but the truth.
“That sounds about right,” Harry agrees, laughing softly in his ear. “However, as much as I usually look forward to your cooking, let’s order Italian from that place around the corner.”
Harry clenches his hands into fists to keep his magic from accidentally unleashing. “That’s what everyone thought. But we grew apart, just like Ginny and I did. Our relationship is not like yours and Hermione’s; I can see you two dying of old age together, but to be honest, I realised Charlie and I weren’t meant to last forever. I don’t know if I will ever find that.”
Draco couldn’t help but agree. Harry kissed him again before they settled down on the sofa to read the musings of Harry’s family and friends, their hands clasped tightly together.
Harry shakes his head. “Possibly, but I didn’t want to use any magic because my tailoring charms are crap.” Harry looks down at the yarn that has unravelled from the jumper and sighs. “There’s no way I’ll be finished in time for tomorrow as I’ll be in the kitchen all morning with no time to spare.”
Draco doesn’t have a chance to respond before Harry Potter enters the Great Hall and the students begin to whisper and point at him.
Draco points to the window shop. “I’d like to see the jumper from the window. The Christmas stocking one that I can add a bottle of wine to.”
Falling in love with Harry had come as a surprise. No one had trusted him despite Dumbledore’s assurances and therefore did not talk to him unless absolutely necessary. Draco had spent his days at Grimmauld Place brewing potions and talking to the old house-elf Kreacher, who always cooked Draco’s favourite meals.
Harry shakes his head. “Of course not. I’m too fond of it.” He is. Draco’s hair is smooth and silky, and sometimes Draco lets it grow out long enough that Harry can wrap it around his hands and pull on it during sex. It would be a tragedy for the two of them if they had to cut it off.
“That’s not true. Hermione loves the idea that you’re restoring books and preserving history. She has a few suggestions if you are interested. Ron might not like you as much, but he doesn’t hate you so that has to count for something. He wouldn’t have left you with me if he didn’t trust you.” Harry stood up and walked over until he was standing in front of Draco. “Even if they did say something, it shouldn’t matter because this relationship is just between us. I think we’d could prove them wrong if you only gave us a chance.”
Daisy stares at him in shock. “But Harry says you’ve published several important articles in academic journals and even have your own lab at your Ministry. How could you do that if you don’t know advanced maths?”
“Please let me finish. I didn’t realise how important you had become to me until you left for Montreal and I was stuck at Grimmauld Place by myself. I missed your company more than I ever thought possible. When I saw the newspaper yesterday morning and how it affected me more than I thought it would. It’s the reason I wound up in St Mungo’s after all.”
Harry loves being an Auror, but it has its drawbacks. His memories of Draco had to suffice during the last ten years of lonely nights he had spent in dingy safe houses, of terrible meals where even the scraps the Dursleys had fed him were marginally better, and trying to survive as he chased criminals whilst being hexed within an inch of his life.
“I already opened my birthday gifts, Harry,” Draco says, his grey eyes confused. “You got me tickets for a trip to Santorini.”
“Of course I’ll help you. You’re my best friend,” she says. “But please don’t stress about the Weasleys. You get along well with Ginny and Ron now. Besides, Harry
wand.” It’s one of the few wandless spells Harry has taught him how to use. Draco points his wand at the paper and murmurs a spell Hermione taught him when he had complained about accidentally spilling ink on his parchment.
Draco smirks. “Always. I see you’re still a Gryffindor, asking questions you don’t have any clue about.”
“I deserve a present because I endured seven days without knowing if you were still alive. I missed you.” Draco’s voice is quiet, but it still manages to fill Harry’s body with warmth that comes every time that Draco admits his feelings out loud. It was so different in the beginning of the relationship, when Draco would stay quiet and reserve whenever Harry would say that he loved him. However, over time, Harry had come to treasure Draco’s quiet admissions.
Vernon can’t look away; deep down he knows that something terrible will happen if he breaks eye contact. However, instead of seeing Draco’s grey eyes, images flash in Vernon’s head, but nothing he can actually focus on. His heart beats faster, and little beads of sweat begin to dot his forehead, which Vernon wipes away with a shaky hand. A full minute into the staring contest and he’s gasping, taking huge gulps of breath, but it doesn’t seem to be working because he can’t breathe, and the oxygen can’t get to his brain, and black dots are appearing in his vision…
“Oh, Draco, what’s wrong?” Pansy asks, going to sit next to him. She wastes no time in pulling him into a hug. “Why are you hiding here instead of at the opening of Blaise’s new restaurant?”
Draco scowls, pushing the crystal ball away. “You better not say I’m pregnant, Harry! This body cannot handle a fifth child, not after having twins.”
“Harry, I think you will need it more than I do. I hear it’s attracted to bright, shiny things much like you are right now.” Charlie laughs before sprinting out the door.
Even though it’s early in the morning, the small shop is in absolute chaos. About twenty people, most likely tourists, move around as they search for last minute gifts, wearing stressed looks on their faces. Small children touch everything in sight with sticky hands, yelling at one another. Even louder are the babies that cry when jostled awake and can’t be soothed.
Draco listlessly shrugs his shoulders. “I don’t feel brave. I thought that it would be all right if I wasn’t brave as long as the people around me loved me. Harry always talks about his found family being warm and welcoming, but I never feel more alone than when I’m at the Burrow. After five years they still don’t trust me and think that I’m just dating Harry to restore my reputation. I’ve tried to show them how much my beliefs have changed and that I truly love Harry, but have been met with polite indifference, at least when Harry is around. I know Weasley checks if I’ve dosed Harry with some sort of potion every time we’re invited over for brunch.”
“I don’t know what to say, Harry.” Here were the words that Draco had longed to hear, going farther back than just these past few months. He had wanted to slot himself in Harry’s life since they were eleven years old. Of course, being his enemy wasn't the best way to go about it, but he was an idiot as a child. Now that he was an adult, and had learned from his mistakes, perhaps it was time to let himself accept Harry’s request.
Draco pushed the box of snow aside and opened another. Inside he found a Santa Claus figurine, a plastic snowman with a carrot nose, and stockings that were made of thick wool and had a letter stitched on.
“Sorry, yes, I was just distracted,” Draco replies, focusing on Harry’s voice “It’s just so good to hear you. Are you home yet? Give me a few minutes, I’ll be there soon.”
Draco holds his chin stiffly. “I am not. I have refined tastes and I am not a picky eater no matter what Harry claims.”
Harry scoffs. “No, he’s the one who helped me. I was a mess after the war, directionless and ready to leave my friends and family behind. I had even gone to Andromeda to apologise for not being a good godfather. My initial anger when first seeing Draco with Teddy faded when I saw how good he was to him. If someone who had seen the worst of the war could be that gentle and caring with a child, then there was hope for me yet.”
The door to Teddy’s room is open and a cursory glance confirms that he’s not there. Draco casts a quick
Not for the first time, Harry questions the brilliance of living in a fifth floor Muggle flat with a broken lift.
“I know we wrote sporadically, and it didn’t help that I would not always respond to your letters, but in the letters that you did send, you seemed more and more distracted. At first I put it off that you were busy with your career, or perhaps the long distance was a factor—”
Draco sits stiffly at the dining room table trying to read a Potions article about the discovery of the thirteenth use of dragon’s blood. The article holds no interest for him; he’s too busy staring at the teenage girl in front of him.
Before Granger could reply, Harry had coughed wetly, his lips trying to form words. At last he had managed a soft
“I realised that I couldn’t imagine a long-term relationship with Nick and it wasn’t fair to either one of us to stay.” Harry rubbed at his eyes. “The biggest reason we split is because there was someone on my mind whom I thought I could work up the courage to ask out, but I always thought that he couldn’t feel the same way.”
“Nice to meet you, Harry,” Julia says as she shakes his hand. “I’m sure you have a lot of catching up to do with your cousin. Draco, if you don’t mind, let’s go outside. I think Daisy wants to show us her science experiment.”
When Draco opens his eyes, he sees Harry at the hob stirring spices into the pot. The new Weird Sisters song is playing on the Wireless and Harry sways his hips and sings along, slightly off-key. Here is proof that there is no way in hell Harry can be related to a family such as the Dursleys.
But tonight is different. It’s just the two of them with a troubled past, but still, Harry is standing outside Draco’s front door and that has to count for something.
“Harry knows the truth; he can see beyond the lies,” Pansy says, voice trembling. She rubs circles on his back to calm him down. “He loves you.”
Harry finally glances at Neville and sees that he’s genuinely interested in what Harry has to say and does not care that he has revealed that he’s going on a date with a man.
“Please,” Pansy says. “Remember, Draco, you are still trying to look your best even whilst wearing this.”
“I’m an Auror, Neville. You know I can’t avoid trouble,” Harry says, grinning. “It’s just that you’re the only herbologist I know and I figured you’d know the language of flowers?”
Still, Vernon hasn’t heard from his nephew in a decade. Perhaps this was his way of checking up on him?
“Lassie, I want you to incinerate everything. And then Vanish the ashes. I don’t want any trace of them.” Draco points to the larger pile scattered on the floor where bed sheets and duvets are tangled together. Lassie quickly picks them up and Disapparates.
Draco snorted. Unexpected. That was a good word for it. “Actually, this photograph is about me. Why would I need to
“Arguing? Who says we’ll be arguing? I can think of much better ways to pass the time,” Harry says, lowering his voice. “We don’t have to leave my bed at all for as long as we want.”
“Teddy broke an egg on my head when I wasn’t looking.” Draco is grateful that it’s only confetti. Whatever spells George used on the Easter eggs ranged from harmless to full on embarrassment. “At least it didn’t turn my hair green like Ron’s did. Rumour is that
Teddy doesn’t look convinced, but he allows his grandmother to help him with his jacket and shoes. Harry follows them to the front door and then kneels down so that he is eye level with Teddy. “Bye, Teddy. I’ll see you next weekend, okay?”
His secretary has his second cup ready as soon as he walks through the office door. As usual, he doesn’t greet her, but rather grabs the cup and sits down at his desk, turning the computer on to start another dull day at Grunnings.
Vernon walks a little faster, bearing in mind that his doctor told him on his last visit that it’s not good for his heart to be so stressed. As soon as he sees the entrance to Grunnings, a sense of calm washes over him. He’s almost safe in his office. If Draco decides to follow him in, security can detain Draco at the door and, if Vernon’s lucky, arrest him.
Harry nods and closes the book. “I knew you would remember everything about snakes. Still a Slytherin after all these years.”
Harry Potter was also a lot more confident and it showed in the way he talked to Draco, no fumbling words, or quick outbursts whenever he was irritated. He kept his emotions in check and when he spoke, he commanded the attention of everyone around him.
George sighs, wiping his mouth with a napkin. “Well, I thought that I would be able to put this off a little bit longer, but let’s get down to it. We have a business proposal for you. Show him, Ron.”
Ron shook his head. “We already got the potions at St Mungo’s. I’m just putting him to bed. He didn’t want to stay at St Mungo’s.”
Without meaning to, Harry’s eyes find Malfoy’s in the crowd. Malfoy’s grey eyes widen for just a second before he turns around and walks away, ignoring the cheers that have started chanting Harry’s name. It seems that no one has noticed whom Harry had been staring at.
“Perfectly normal,” Harry says, smiling. “You were on assignment dressed like that? I didn’t know the Hit-Wizard uniform had changed.”
Harry feels a pang in his chest watching his best friends. While he might not have many regrets with any of his previous relationships, the major one he had was not having any children. Harry thinks he would have been a decent dad. Teddy Lupin more than fulfills that role in his life, but his godson spends the majority of his time with Andromeda and soon he would be starting his first year at Hogwarts.
