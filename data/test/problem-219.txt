“Told you: they love me more.”
And then Harry would drop Draco to St. Mangos on his bike before leavening for the ministry. They knew they could apparate. But Draco loved that quite ride along the London streets, as he held Harry close to himself, savouring the moment, dreading that Harry might not come back to him at night. It was always hard, knowing that he could lose his love whenever he let go of him every morning.
Harry’s expression went from concerned to panicked, and he pulled Draco close, wrapping him in his arms. And Draco knew he had lost it. It was a hopeless battle to begin with. Loud, broken sobs wracked through his body as tears flowed down his cheeks in abandon, soaking Harry's expensive robes.
Maybe some stupid part in Draco, a naive and hopeful and idiot and stupidly in love part of Draco had hoped it to be untrue. Had hoped that Harry's partner would be someone who didn't deserve him (not that Draco ever considered himself worthy of deserving Harry, but still!). That way at least Draco would have someone to hate, to scorn and detest and direct all his resentment and frustration for not being able to express his feelings for Harry, and eventually get over Harry. Even though Draco knew that would never happen, he could never get over Harry.
Harry looked away, "I mean, if you want to."
are the dumpster Baby! Give me my yogurt back-DAD!!” Teddy cried, turning to Remus for support, who pinched the bridge of his nose in exasperation. He probably wanted to throttle them both, but his love for them stopped him from doing so.
“Yes?”
His head snapped as he looked up, his eyes wide. Harry was standing there, leaning against the column, one hand in his pocket. His medals glinted in the moonlight. His hair was tousled and the top buttons of his collar were open. He looked breath-taking.
“What just happened?”
“Nothing. Would you floo the Aurors? I think there’s a man sleeping on our doorstep,” he inclined his head toward the entrance. “I’ll just pop back up and take care of this,” he held up his hand to show his bruised knuckles before disappearing up the staircase.
Sirius straitened, all his polite, cheerful facade forgotten as his expression hardened and a dark shadow took over his handsome face. Draco was glad to note that Sirius had a couple of inches over his father.
Draco buried his face in his knees, his fingers fisting his hair as he bit his lip in a vain attempt to stifle the sobs that wracked through his chest.
After Harry had ensured the safety of his family and kept him and his mother out of Azkaban, Draco had done his best to make the most of this generous second chance, but to also avoid Harry at all cost. But Draco being a healer and Harry being an Auror prone to injury had made their meeting inevitable. And before Draco knew it, Harry was inviting him for dinners and pub nights and friendly outings with friends.
“This reminds me: let’s put our own silencing charms for precaution, I don’t want you to get traumatised already,” He told Draco.
boyfriend. He was too scared to lose the love of his life right in front of his eyes. Protocols be damned. And so Draco had treated Harry, and being the chosen one’s chosen one, no one objected. He took care of Harry, then moved in to look after him as he recovered.
Harry glanced at Draco and nodded.
But Harry didn't seen to mind. He just held Draco close, drawing soothing circles on his back, shushing and mumbling sweet nothings into his ears.
“Is that so? And who, might I ask, are you?”
“Now, how can I help you?” Sirius asked cheerfully as he came to stand in the entryway, not so subtly extending a protective arm across Harry and gently edging the two boys behind him.
more! Tell him Dad!”
Instead Draco just glared at the floor, stubbornly pulling at the cuffs of his sleeves.
a napkin to wipe Teddy’s already choclate smudged face.
Harry scooped him up into his lap and held him tighter. Another sob tore through Draco and he pulled back, holding Harry’s face in his small hands. “Its you,” he whispered, giving Harry a chaste but firm kiss on his lips, “Christ, its really you,” he repeated, kissing Harry again. He pulled back and brushed Harry’s hair out of his eyes before kissing his forehead. “its really you.”
And that had been worse to hear. This whole time at least Draco had told himself that Harry was single. That even if it was impossible, Draco still had a chance. He could almost delude himself into thinking that he had time to get close to Harry, to know him and love him. But now, knowing that Harry probably already had someone special, had nailed down the reality for Draco and his hopes and dreams had come crashing down.
Draco dropped his eyes to the floor. His heart hammered against his chest, filled with guilt and self loathing. How could he even
Draco would just watch Harry, in all his carefree messy glory and Harry would look back, and smile, and sometimes he would kiss him in the middle of the song, or bite Draco’s exposed collar bone, or just wrap his arms around Draco’s waist and kiss his cheek, and Draco would just melt. Then they would have breakfast together, after which Draco got to pick Harry’s outfit. And then Draco would tame Harry’s hair, straighten Harry’s collar, while pulling him into a deep kiss, saying
“I wouldn’t finish that sentence if I were you.”
And it felt like crying was the only thing he could do—it was the only outlet. But it didn’t help.
Draco’s breath hitched at the use of the pet name, it was something he allowed only Harry to call him. His face still buried in Harry's chest, Draco shook his head. It was now or never. "I—I like you Harry. I like you a lot."
“Are you okay?” He asked softly, concerned eyes searching Draco’s face. Cradling his soar wrist, Draco swallowed and nodded. Harry turned back to face Lucius, eyes hard, “He is not going anywhere with you.”
“Do not argue with me.”
“Yes,” the man cut in, “ I have called to inform you that Mr. Potter’s team has just returned from the mission and are now reporting to the head of the department—”
In the end, Draco set the table as Harry pulled out choclate yogurt from the fridge and gave it to Teddy, ruffling his hair. Teddy’s face lit up, all his earlier rage forgotten, and he rewarded Harry with a wet smacking kiss on his cheek. As Teddy dug into his yogurt, Draco joined them on the table, sitting next to Harry and
This can’t be true. This is not true. Harry can’t leave him like that. Not so soon. They were so new. They were so happy. It can’t just end like this. Draco hasn’t even told Harry how much he loved him. He wished he had. He wished he had said that. And a lot of other things.
“Harry,” Remus warned and Harry shut his mouth, smiling innocently.
"No, no one said anything,” he mumbled in a small voice. Harry's protectiveness and indignation on his behalf was bitter sweet. It made Draco crave him even more, but at the same time the realisation that, no matter how close Draco got to Harry, Harry would always be just out of his reach, tarnished and chilled the warmth that he had felt moments ago.
Callouse hands held his waist, and suddenly Draco was being pulled in for another kiss. He eagerly responded, wrapping his arms around Harry’s neck, his jam-sticky fingers in the air behind him, away from Harry’s hair.
“That’s not true. And that’s mine!” He pointed at the yogurt. When Harry just shrugged and continued to eat it, Teddy launched himself at him, trying to snatch the yogurt from Harry, who grinned wickedly and raised it high above his head as Teddy bounced on his feet in a vain attempt to reach it.
The door bell rang, interrupting their bliss.
Lucius sneered, “And you are going to stop me?”
It made Draco sick. And so he had chucked down the last of his drink and stormed out of the hall, leaving Pansy surprised and calling after him. But he hadn't turned back, too desperate to hide his tears and leave the hall before they fell and spilled from his eyes, making him the object of ridicule.
He had known this was coming, he had always known that this would end in heartbreak when he had first realised his feelings for Harry. But he had no idea that it would hurt this bad. To see someone else in Harry's arms was gut wrenching.  It was like Draco's heart was imploding into itself. But it was happening slowly and torturously, as if every chunk was falling piece by piece, every vein and tending snapping like a thread one after the other, and pain chipping away at his insides until Draco couldn't take it anymore.
“ye--,” Draco choked. He cleared his throat and tried again, “yes, this is Draco Malfoy speaking.”
"Hey." Harry's voice was soft and
“Mr. Malfoy? Mr. Malfoy is everything all right? Mr. Malf--” the voice was cut off as Draco hung up.
“His father. Lord Malfoy.”
“Good evening Mr. Malfoy, I am officer David from the Auror department,” the man introduced. “you are registered as family and the first point of contact for Mr. Potter, is that correct?”
Teddy huffed. Then punching Harry’s waist with his small fists repeatedly, he screamed, “I hate you, I hate you! I want Draco!”
"We are so stupid."
Draco's eyes fluttered open. Harry was staring back at him, his hair and eyes shining like a mossy lake under the moonlight. He looked ethereal.
Its been 3 days, and Harry hasn’t come back yet. And Draco couldn’t help but think of the worst. He knew it was a dangerous mission. He knew that Harry wasn’t confident this time. He knew all of this. Because Harry had kissed him harder than usual, before leaving. He knew it because Harry’s promise of coming back was said with too much conviction, too much to be real and true. He could tell when Harry was being honest, and when Harry was simply trying to reassure Draco. And this time it had been the latter.
His father’s nostrils flaired. His grabbed Draco’s hand in a painful grip and pulled so forcefully that Draco almost stumbled. “I have put up with your nonsense long enough!”
“Why would I not want you, Harry? Have you seen me? Have you seen
Harry ran a hand through his hair, “That was just drinks and we were being stupid....Oliver would be leaving tomorrow for his tour anyway. There is nothing between us. We were just fooling around."
"A green Welsh," Charlie said after checking the clipboard. "Its a new arrival, it'll take a couple of months before it hatches. That's why its still so small."
"Uncultured!" Was all that Draco exclaimed and Harry in turn, swatted at him with the map of Greece he was holding.
"I'm here to represent the owner," He answered Ginny and looked at Ron full of distain. "I am here handling the affairs for the day."
"Yes?" Harry prodded.
"They did that at the muggle school I went to before coming to Hogwarts."
"That's Gavriil." Charlie laughed at the bickering and before he knew it, the man was back at the door and Charlie found himself admonished for laughing, still through the door which numbed the effect a fair bit.
"I never been to a museum." Harry admitted.
During dinner, Draco asked Harry if he could check the maps too, as he was joining in a road trip, the might as well see if there were places that tickled his fancy when Andromeda smiled, secretly pleased.
The next afternoon when Harry came back from the hospital he found Draco with distinctive pink ears and dishevelled hair at the kitchen table.
Two days long she had been searching. Two days of worry and in the one moment she wasn't actually searching but merely wanted to use the loo - she found them.
A desk was crammed in at the left and Harry, phone in his hand, crawled behind it, telling the person on call that no, he did not take apprentice applications. Those calls came more often but he didn't fancy teaching anyone. Normally getting behind the desk was hard enough but with a phone in his hand, it was double the trouble, really, if he would gain weight he would never be able to get behind it. The space was so small. He dropped himself in the white leather chair and sighed, dropping the phone back in its cradle. Simply another day of work just to begin and he liked it, just like that - Simple and easy.
"What's it?" Draco asked and tried to catch Harry's eyes, who avoided his with all his might while he was motioning for Draco to keep hush.
Harry grinned and followed her into the house to the kitchen and there sat Teddy, his godson in a high chair at the table, smudging applesauce all around, happy laughter filling the room.
"I do know that he doesn't want to depend on them so heavily even if he should and he is apparently so, of opinion, that being here he doesn't come in a situation where he does need them. Except, just now. When you arrived. I wasn't sure if it was you but when it did turn out to be you, I had hoped, things would go smoother than they did, but they didn't. The shouting match, followed by the duel, shot adrenaline through Harry's body, with my intervention, he relaxed. I don't blame you, or him," She threw a thumb at Harry. "I don't blame myself, but! That, is what made his heart stop."
It was a thing he didn't had to say, Draco practically ran in, shrugging of his button up shirt as he went. Draco's skin was a sight to behold. His entire back was done by Harry but he had a tattooed sleeve that went on to part of his chest and his entire side. It effectively covered up his dark mark and most of his scars. The design of animals, leaves and flowers done in black and grey with just hints of dull green was beautiful.
Draco hummed when Harry got up and easily made his way to the door that let to the back room and snapped the light on. "After you." He bowed mockingly and motioned for Draco to enter.
He reflected, knowing he could have done better, or differently, but, he was content. He was happy and adored what he did, having all things considered, even if he had grown to be that lonely, unsocial hermit of the block.
He was sitting on the cold floor with his back against the kitchen door trying to read the pages in a measly light of the lone torch burning while Draco had freed himself a while ago. Harry's stomach grumbled and roared loudly and every other minute a whispered curse left his mouth as the heavenly smells of delicious chicken and other foods travelled into his nose. Obvious Kreacher's cooking as Harry guessed, knowing Draco wasn't a master in the kitchen and he was jealous because he knew how dawn well good it tasted. He was jealous because he was on the wrong side of the door and practicing the wand movements of ancient trickster spells out of a dingy old book with a wooden spoon; The wooden spoon that was handed to him before Draco had slammed the kitchen door shut in his face and he hated it. It wasn't even a metal one. Harry couldn't even pretend for a later use of scooping Draco's heart out with it, painful and slowly as wood didn't cut. Thus, Harry was, to say the least, not amused.
Harry grinned, pressed himself just that tad bit tighter to the other and a simple swish with the shiny, sharp metal had him ripping through the fabric of his pants - leaving his upper thighs naked he skill fully twirled the knife between his fingers once and settled the blade against the already marred and scratched skin.
"Then what?" Harry wanted to know.
Harry nodded enthusiastically. The fountain stood by Gringotts, a place he needed to go before shopping as he was fairly sure the money in his pouch wasn't enough to buy everyone a present.
"I sometimes forget you grew up as a muggle." Draco answered to that. "So what are you going to do with it, you're not planning to go there?"
"We got you," Shelley winked and told Silas they might have some in the back or he needed to fetch them from the lower lab. Silas left on the search and Shelley made Harry sit at the round table. "He won't be long."
"No cursing," Andromeda gently kicked Harry's side. He looked up and mumbled a sorry, although he grinned and she smiled back. "Have fun." She said, a pointed look at the mess he just dropped on the floor.
Thus, the next morning, Harry left the house early. He was on a mission. Eventually, it had taken him quite a few hours but when he came back at the house, he had a bag full of study books and had signed up for a course that promised him his drivers licence within three months. It was an expensive course but with all the money he had, it barely made a dent in the pile of gold stocked up it his Gringrott's vaults.
"No!" Draco took a step closer, mirroring Harry's stance, a glare on his face.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I'll try to make it happen, no promises." Charlie had said, pulled Harry up and went to take the gear off.
If you have any problem or something with any OC, I'd like to hear. They'll be featuring more and more but now I can still make adjustments if pointed at. - Lyle.
He traced a few more patches, admiring the advanced work he'd done, stitches with colourful wires from Slytherin green to sunny yellow swirled with bright purple he'd spend to many time on having in his hands. He pricked his fingers bleeding and kept going, another stitch, another hour on the clock and eventually, having to stop due to him not being able to see straight and Draco cramping from the pain. It was a long way from a painless procedure. Draco was lucky to be a fellow wizard. The muggles didn't have the pleasure of a numbing, disinfectant potion before and a healing charm afterwards.
"Really, and what is that?" Harry asked as they made their way back to Charlie's home."
"I'd say you're lying." Ginny said and tapped Ron on the arm. It broke his intense staring and the softest of muttered curses. "Please hand him the papers."
Harry sighed and put the book atop of the desk and bend to pick up another one. Realizing this was going to take a while. "I know and I'm sorry for doing so but come on.." He gave a tiny smile as he showed a thin purple book: "Is this the one?"
Charlie asked what Harry's plans were for the afternoon. "You're planning to complete collecting them potions?"
"You can read that chicken scratch?" Draco asked then. "What even is that?"
It doesn't mean he wants too though. It's just to unnatural to be forced and then expected to life happily, cheerfully, smile and go trough the school routine as if they didn't just fought a war. As if they hadn't buried people they knew and cared about. If they hadn't seen the things war brought. They couldn't expect just because they took the child out of war, the war would be out of the child - Except they did. They just made them do, without a hand of help and expected them to succeeded in being a happy teenager who kindly went to lessons and made their homework. Twisted.
She smoothed down her robe, stuck at curl that dangled in front of her eyes behind her ear and made way to the fighting boys. As she passed the window, it went quiet and the flashes of light meant that the boys had turned to their wands. Quickly, she rushed out, her own wand at the ready.
Charlie explained that the pen was a down scaled and simplified version of the reservoir. The one real difference being that it held no wards between the habitats but rather, they put ward stones on the young dragons. The ward stones designed to keep the dragon protected from attacks and attacking other dragons and also the Dragon Handlers new to the Reservoir, using the pen as a practice ground. The wards were similar but not identical to the warding in the reservoir, the main difference being that they didn't separate the species. They also didn't keep out any humans but did prevent other magical beings from entering, the wards on the reservoir flipped.
Harry almost smacked himself. Sure he might've been a tad rude, but he was in a hurry. He almost just repeated his question, but when she raised an eyebrow and pursed her lips, Harry gave in. "Sorry, goodmorning," He huffed. "The potions, have they been cleaned up?"
Over the year he had removed a fair number of decorations from this piece and redone a whole lot more, one weekly basis. He added a thread here and another there but that first, silly clumsily done flower was always, just there. As if it had the power to demand to stay and both men obliged.
She nodded with a smile, shuffled some papers and motioned for Harry to take it.
Half an hour later Harry came stomping down the stairs. He carried several rolls of wrapping paper under his arm, along with supplies in a bag and levitated shopping bags in front of him. Andromeda raised an eyebrow when he came thundering into the living room.
Draco hadn't meant to, but he had accidentally fallen asleep curled up on the armchair with a blanket haphazardly thrown around him. He had wanted to stay awake to keep an eye out on Harry, to make sure Andromeda saw no reason to kill him come morning. Yet, even while reading a book that caught and held his attention he had managed to fall asleep. Fitfully that is, his closed eye time being plagued by nightmares of him being judged by the wizardgamot and the population alike for killing their beloved savior.
Draco had generously complained and Harry had shrugged it off. He found that whatever it was, it was innocent up till now and deemed it not worthy enough to rat himself out.
Harry could hear the boy yelling, but he didn't turn his head, didn't react at all while he kept running. Trying to get away was the only thing on his mind, talking with the boy definitely not.
Draco looked down. "Are you sure? You can't mess this up, you know?"
Harry nodded. He knew as much, but that wasn't truly what he meant. "I don't know. They seem so.." He scratched the back of his head, trying to find the words to explain what he tried to convey. "Silas is too proper, so formal. Solomon is like this extreme bad boy and well, Shelley seems to be the most normal although so friendly but still standoffish. Something isn't right."
Draco sighed, he had been there plenty of times. Paris was one of his family hot spots during the summer vacations but Harry had never been and so, the Eiffel Tower was marked as a must go. "If we are there anyway, how do you feel about grabbing some museums to see?"
Draco just laughed and told Harry to shut up. "Goodnight."
"I know?" Harry remembered well enough. Charlie explained that the Reservoir was understaffed and any taking time off meant more working hours for the rest. Take in account sickness and unexpected emergency leaves, vacation time had to be planned well in advance.
She turned around, narrowing her eyes and pointed her wand at the teen.
Harry let out a breath he didn't know he was holding and kissed the toddler on top of his brown curls, who was still happily gurgling in his hold and messing up his clothes in the process and Harry smiled, putting the toddler back into his seat and watched as Teddy immediately attacked the bowl again.
Harry shrugged and gave it over and watched Draco open it, using a finger to scan the index and then frantically flipped through the pages. "Pick up those loose pages will you?" He asked sounding nothing like the snappy displeased tone he used earlier. "This is definitely the one."
Straight no's, hesitant no's, maybe's after opening, some after reading turned no's; endless streaks of no's and maybe's, Harry felt tousled, hoping on a yes. Book after book ended up on piles scattered around. The stacks growing slowly higher with disregarded books that couldn't be the cause. At least Draco's anger had simmered away and was just plain displeased.
"Home, hours ago." The security guard answered in a clipped tone. Harry's cheeks blossomed, he always felt awkward when reprimanded even if it wasn't obvious. He figured he might have been a bit rude, interrupting as he had. The man however, silently dismissed Harry when he turned back to Charlie. "Charles, as you were saying?"
That night, they walked into the employee diner at six sharp. Harry hadn't really thought about how it would look, but if he took a guess, he might say something like the old lunchroom at his muggle school, or something alike the Leaky Cauldron. It was neither. It was actually more alike the Hogwarts Yule ball during his fourth year, if compared to anything he ever saw before.
"At least we know we'll be in danger then." Harry said.
"It's a good thing, you won't get paid, then. But-" Bernadette held her hand out. "If you don't want it?"
"Yes!"
"Yeah, so, that's Bernadette Dell'elion," Charlie pointed out a sweet looking old lady at a desk in the entrance hall. "She's lovely but stern, our receptionist, kindly let her know where you wander to as it's her job to keep track of all visitors."
"I won't be be just my own demon, but, yours too, Dear."
Charlie had taken his own 'd tapped one of the glasses with his finger to have it filled up and took a hold of it when it was still floating. He absentmindedly took a sip and settled it next to his plate, scanning the menu. He was obviously looking for something. "They change it every other day," Charlie said and ran his fingers along the lines. "I was hoping they have my favorite dish today."
"Teddy won't bust the furniture, Right Teddy?" Harry said in reply and ruffled the toddler's hair. "He's a good boy."
Everybody looked at one or another chair differently, like Millicent Bulstrode who couldn't keep her hopeful, longing eyes of the empty chair beside her - Pansy Parkinsons' seat. The girl who's still in St. Mungo's, undergoing long term recovery, if they could call it that. The staff was still trying to stop and counter the crushing curse that's trying to turn her inside out.
"Don't you dare call me by my given name, scum!" Ron bellowed.
"The window's fine to use, a silencing charm holds itself well and who cares what colour the kitchen is?" Harry gave a smile and hugged Draco close. "It's nothing."
"I can," Draco shrugged. "It's not that I have anything better to do and you're not all that bad a company."
Right in front of the house stood a race model car in shiny Slytherin green. Harry grumbled under his breath as he watched a very familiar blonde boy step out. He growled. "Malfoy."
Draco nodded. "Seems we have to take a few more rides to make it work. We have much to dispel."
Harry pouted, Draco laughed and after another half an hour of banter, they finally made way out of the shop. Trailing the street and leaping from store to store, Harry bought Ron his very own chessboard, a shawl for Mrs. Weasley and other odds and ends for the Weasley clan as well as a generous gift card from the craft store for Andromeda and some plush toys for Teddy. Harry was pleased with his haul, pretty much done but Draco, by far, had just started even if, his arms were loaded with bags. During their shopping, the gifts were their main topic, not really delving into other topics but as they passed a travel agency, Harry realized that he didn't quite know how it all worked. He broke his banter with Draco about the gaudy red shawl Harry had chosen and decided to ask.
"Yeah? Would you like to try one?" And without waiting for an answer he hauled Draco up with ease. Draco squealed and instinctively wrapped his legs around Harry's waist.
“Yes, love its me. Oh my god, I am so sorry!”
Draco stopped, panting. "You know, there are a lot of rooms here," he mumbled between their almost touching lips.
Draco’s shoulder slumped and he exhaled in relief, letting out the breath he didn’t realize he was holding.
It was for love, for comfort, for safety, for the cozy evenings, languishing afternoons, and lazy teasing breakfast mornings. It was for the unconditional and unbidden love that rediated in this house. The urge to protect each other like the family they were. It was just the feeling of having someone, or some place, to call your own, and feel it too. Like home.
But at the same time having Harry so close and yet so far was torture, and Draco wanted to pull away from him as if burned, unable to endure the agony of his yearning heart anymore.
“What happened?” Remus asked, eyes roaming over Sirius’s body, checking to see if he was hurt.
Dropping his head in his hands, he tried to control his tears. His shoulder shook, and he tasted the tangy coppery taste of blood from how hard he was biting into his lip to keep himself from falling apart. He just wanted his Harry back. Please.
“That won’t happen, they love me more,” Harry entered the room, kissing Draco’s cheek before leaning back against the counter, unwrapping a fresh cup of strawberry yogurt.
“Mr. Malfoy? Are you there?”
Harry’s face screwed up, “Urgh, they are going to fuck like bunnies now.” When Draco just gave him a blank look, Harry explained. “It’s their thing; aparantly, Remus going all feral, or Sirius being a protective bad boy gets them going.”
Draco had tried to refuse, partly out of wounded pride at being perceived as a pathetic loner (although now he knew that Harry didn't see him that way) and partly because he knew he wouldn't be welcomed. But Harry's sincere attempts to mend things between them and his earnest eyes had been difficult to rebuff.
to like Harry, let alone love him. And now Draco had gone ahead and dumped his feelings on Harry. It wasn't fare to him. He was sure Harry would hate him now. Or worse, he would try to make it up to Draco, and would be too careful around him to avoid hurting him any further.
need to know that. And neither should you. How do you even…?”
“I am here to take Draco.”
"Someone is impatient," he said, breathless, brushing his nose against Harry's. He felt so elated he could fly.
Last month Draco had received the invitation for the gala—which he knew was partly Harry's doing since the ministry would never voluntarily invite an Ex Death Eater to a function, even though Draco had been acquitted and had been serving as a healer for the past few years, doing his utter most to make up for the damage he had caused.
Harry opened his mouth as if wanting to ask what he was grateful for, but he didn’t. And Draco was glad, because he had a feeling that he himself didn’t know the answer. Because it wasn’t a Thank you for the pancakes, or for standing up to his father, or for letting him stay, or none of those other things. It was much more…just much more than what anyone can thank someone for in words.
"No, you are just thick!"
Draco bit back a smile as Teddy whined for the third time. They were in the kitchen, waiting for Remus to finish making breakfast. Sirius was doodling his latest design for his motorcycle, while Draco read a book and pretended not to evesdrop on the conversation taking place next to him.
Draco stared at him dumbly. "But I thought—Why didn't you ever say anything?"
Not from Harry.
“Eww.”
"But wasn't he your special someone?"
Draco's rambling was cut off by a pair of soft lips crashing into his in a chaste but firm kiss. Draco's eyes widened, but then they fell shut on their own accord as Harry snaked an arm around Draco's waist, his hand coming to rest on the small of Draco's back and pulling him close, his other hand cupped Draco's jaw before burying into Draco's hair as the nape of his neck. Draco gasped, Harry deepened the kiss and continued to kiss Draco like a traveller in desert quenching his thirst.
“Don’t ask, it’s painful as it is. They forget their silencing charm way too often. I swear to god, the way they are with each other, you would think they are still horny teenagers and not men who have been married for nearly two decades.”
"Draco?"
Draco’s heart constricted as he stared at the photo. They looked so safe, so calm, and so happy together. As if they had no care in the world. As if nothing could ever touch Draco if Harry had his arms wrapped around him. And maybe it was true.
Harry took his silence as a yes and slowly leaned in, giving Draco enough time to pull back. His lips graced Draco's, gentle and tentative at first, then sure and firm and full of promise as he pulled Draco close.
Harry tsked and shook his head, while Draco was extremely confused.
Harry burst out laughing and pulled Draco close again, smothering him in a hug. "Like you gave me any chance. You are as cold and stiff as an iceberg."
"Can we please keep him?”
“Yes,” said Draco, snapping back to reality. “yes, I am here. What happened? Do you have news? Any update? Is Harry—"
. After a while he didn’t know what he was doing. He didn’t care what he was saying. His world was spinning. And his chest felt tight, and his throat raw. And it ached, it ached everywhere and it ached
After they placed the charm, Harry began to finish preparing breakfast, picking up right where Remus left. Draco came to stand next to him.
Then his phone rang again. It was from the ministry again. This time Draco picked it up.
But not today.
“But I don’t want to go!”
At last, he had asked Pansy to be his date. Even though he knew he would regret it later, it was impossible for him to miss the chance of seeing just who Harry's someone special was. His desperation and curiosity had gotten the better of him. And now he regretted it tremendously.
. What had he expected to gain by coming here? That somehow a miracle would happen and Harry would confess his love for Draco? He had known Harry would be bringing his "someone special" . Harry himself  had told Draco when he had asked Draco if he was planning to go to the gala.
“And you are back. Back to me,” said Draco, stroking Harry’s cheek.
Minutes passed, hours passed—he didn’t even know. He was just there, on the floor, crying, hiccupping, sobbing; uncaring of the broken shards of the broken coffee mug digging into his skin and tearing it. He could see blood, but he didn’t feel any pain, not from those physical wounds anyway.
Draco's heart skipped a beat and he inched closer to Harry.
But Harry came back, he always did. And the nights when he came back late, or bruised, or injured, he brought Draco’s favourite ice cream Or takeaway as a peace offering, and smile apologetically. And Draco would just forgive him and hug him close and kiss him tender, and touch him all over. Partly to reassure himself and partly because he had missed him so much. But he would always forgive Harry because he always kept his promise and came back.
“Harry.”
Sirius raised an eyebrow and turned to look at Draco.
There was no news yet. Draco had texted Harry so many times, 673 in total. And 453 missed calls. But no reply. The ministry simply told him to calm down and have patience and that they would inform him if they got any update. But those bastards did not understand what was at stake for Draco. His life was out there in danger, fighting and struggling and maybe...maybe dying, to keep the wizarding world safe. And they didn’t understand that for them it would be just another martyr, but for Draco—for him his entire life will crumble if anything happened to Harry, he will be shattered, devastated, and he knew he would never be able to pick himself up if Harry fell. Draco will be lost.
Harry froze. Draco felt it the instant when Harry's entire body went rigid. Draco's stomach dropped.
Then Draco would sit on the kitchen counter, with one of Harry’s oversized jumper slipping down his shoulders as he mixed their coffees into the perfect ratio, just how they liked it, while Harry made their breakfast, humming along with whatever music played on the wireless.
“Father?”
"Do you really mean that?"
, he thought happily.
“—but...,” the man on the other side paused. “Mr. Potter has not...he has not reported yet.”
They had to do so much, together. They still had to plan their house together. Draco still had to go meet Harry’s parents at godric’s hallow, even if it was just their graves. Harry still had to meet his mother, they were going for tea with her, weren’t they? And on Sunday they had to go meet Teddy, Harry had promised to stay the weekend with Teddy and go the amusement park with the both of them. Draco hated that crowded place, but if Harry said he would come back then Draco would go anywhere with him, even to that muggle overpopulated park.
"I will understand if you want me to—” Draco hiccupped—"I would understand if you don't want to remain friends with me anymore. Not that we were ever friends. I wouldn't be so arrogant as to assume that but—I know I shouldn't—It’s okay if you hate me. I deserve it. I would never say it again, I promise. These are my feelings and you don't have to—"
“Yeah, It seems lovely,” Draco said shyly, a faint blush dusting his cheeks.
“Thank you.”
Draco let Harry hold him as he felt the emotional turmoil finally take its toll on him. He didn’t know how long they stayed there on the floor, covered in blood and tears and in each other. But it didn’t matter. Harry was back, and now Draco felt safe again, he felt whole again. He felt his eyelids dropping shut as Harry’s constant rocking and whispered words lulled him to sleep.
Harry pulled away, keeping Draco at arms length, his jaw slack as he looked at Draco with an unreadable expression in his face.
That startled a laugh out of Draco—who would have guessed?—but it was cut short as Harry grinned and attacked his mouth again.
"I am sorry, Harry," Draco mumbled between his sobs, his voice muffled and  strained with guilt and shame. "I am so sorry. I tried--I tried to stop it, I really did—but I can't anymore, I am so sorry."
Lucius glared coldly at Sirius, who simply flashed his teeth in response. It would have looked charming if not for the dangerous glint in Sirius’s eyes that was downright wicked.
"You bet I am." Harry mumbled before attacking Draco's exposed collar. He pinned Draco against the nearest door, his hand fumbling as he swiped his all access Auror card to enter the room, all the while not taking his mouth off Draco. The moment the door was shut behind him, he pushed Draco against it and latched onto his neck. "I have been waiting for this for so long, you have no idea."
"Oh." Draco looked at his lap, he hadn't expected that answer. Something warm spread through his chest, like a gentle balm soothing his flaming nerves. Harry had come looking for him. "You—" his voice caught, scratchy from crying. He cleared his throat, "You should be inside."
He cursed himself, a choked sob racking through his lungs. He was
Harry sighed and sat on the steps, facing Draco. Leaning his back against the railing, he scrutinised Draco with a grave expression on his face, his arms crossed over his chest. "Draco, look at me." Draco didn't. "Did someone say anything? Was it the media? You can tell me, you know, I will see to it that they--"
Remus closed his eyes as if asking the Lord for strength.
Draco’s stomach dropped, “What? Wh—what do you mean he hasn’t reported yet?”
“Draco, darling, do you want to go with this man?”
If anything, it made everything ten times worse. How could Draco ever be expected to forget this beautiful, caring, selfless man? Especially when he was hugging Draco like this, like he was the most precious thing in the world. In that moment, Draco wanted to stay in Harry's arms forever. He would happily embrace death in that moment if it meant that he would die in Harry's arms and Harry calm, loving voice would be the last memory resonating through the beats of his fading heart as he took his final breath.
"Hey! That's no way to treat your boyfriend."
Lucius grabbed Harry’s collar, he was atleast a foot taller than the teenager, and hissed dangerously, “Listen you filthy halfblood–”
Draco moaned as Harry sucked at a specially sensitive spot. "Really?"
But it had turned out to be Oliver Wood. The famous, charming, successful and dashing Oliver wood. Draco never stood a chance against Oliver. It was pathetic to even dream about it.
Draco pouted. "Speak for yourself, Potter. You are the one who chickened out of asking me to the ball. It was all your fault." Draco sniffed. "We could have avoided all the angst, but no, you had to go and make me cry. You enjoy it, don't you?"
They had barely entered the kitchen when they heard raised voices from outside. Then there was a dull thud of a body hitting the ground and everything went quiet, followed by the bang of a door being slammed shut. Moments later Sirius returned, rubbing his knuckles.
“Its my Harry.” Draco repeated softly, not caring how stupid and barmy he sounded.
“yes, your Harry.”
“I suppose it does.”
This was the first time Harry had gone away for a long time on an Auror mission since they started dating six months ago. Draco had just moved in with Harry last month when Harry got injured while chasing a criminal and landed himself in St. Mangos, and right in Draco’s department- spell damage. Draco knew that his healer colleagues were great at their job, but he didn’t let anyone touch
Harry leaned into the touch and turned his face to plant a soft kiss on Draco’s palm as he brought his large hand up to hold onto Draco’s small one. “Yes, back to you,” said Harry, his voice just above a whisper, “Where else would I go when my home is right here, With you.”
“Dumpster baby! Dumpster baby!” Harry sang.
Draco’s father wasn’t one to be messed with. Malfoys were notorious for being terrifying, Draco knew that, but they had nothing over Blacks. Lucius yielded, letting go of Harry.
“Wait. If you and Wood are not an item then why were you snogging his face off? I can understand why he was doing it. But I thought hook-ups weren't your thing?"
?" Draco gestured at Harry from top to bottom, generally encompassing his whole being.
“Yeah?” Sirius said, sounding almost bored. “I don’t know…being your enemy sounds very tempting.” He looked over his shoulders. “Harry, pup, will you be a doll and take Draco inside while I deal with our unwelcome guest?”
Lucius narrowed his eyes and inched forward till he was nose to nose with Sirius. “You don’t want to make an enemy of me.”
“Please,” Harry drawled, licking the yogurt exaggeratedly from his lips. “We picked you up from the dumpster. Plus, I came before you, so they love me more.”
Draco slowly peered up at Harry from under his eyelashes, his vision a little blurry from tears. Harry's expression was concerned, and there was such tenderness in his eyes that Draco felt his heart breaking, he could almost hear the crack, like the shattering of frozen ice over a lake. He choked on a sob.
Draco's eyebrows shot up into his hairline. "By snogging Wood?"
Finally a sob tore through his throat and he dropped his head on his keens again, this time letting his tears fall; crying and screaming and sobbing in abandon, his hands fisted into his hair, pulling roughly onto them, Draco could almost feel his heart break.
Harry broke away, "My fantasies were getting so blond It was creepy."
Draco nodded, his cheeks burning pink, whether from embarrassment or fear, he didn't know, or maybe it had something to do with Harry's closeness or the affection in his eyes when he looked at Draco. He suddenly realised that Harry had been giving him that look for weeks now, only he had failed to notice it in his apprehension.
"Harry?" Draco choked out and looked away, sniffling and hastily wiping his tears. "Wha--what are you doing here? I thought you would be at the party."
Draco shook his head and the tears that had been clinging to his eyelashes rolled down his cheeks.
“Hey!” Sirius looked indignant but went back to his drawings when Remus gave him a quelling look.
And look where it had all ended up. With Draco crying on the eve of Christmas in the dark corner at the bottom of the steps of the empty stairwell of a grand hotel, while the rest of the wizarding world celebrated in the grand ballroom. The ceremonies had ended long ago, giving way to the more raunchy after-party with booze and band and blasting music. It was then when Draco had seen the sight which had broken his heart into pieces.
Harry's mouth formed an "O" "You saw that?"
Sliding down the wall, he brought his knees close to his chest, curling up into a small ball, and burying his face into his knees.
Draco couldn't help the fond smile that curled across his lips. Harry's innocence in such matters was endearing. Harry really had no idea how amazing he was. It looked like his dreadful relatives really did a number on him when it came to self-appreciation. Well, Draco would just have to rectify that.
“Why?" was all Draco could manage.
“Mr. Malfoy? Mr. Malfoy are you—”
"But what about Wood?" Draco asked, his voice just above a whisper , afraid that this was a dream and he would wake up  if he raised his voice. He deliberately stopped himself from fixating too much on the fact that Harry had just called him love. "I just saw you two together..."
But even worse was watching so many people asking Harry to be his date. Every time Draco had been at the ministry to drop Auror medical reports or samples or anything, he had seen someone asking Harry or hinting to it or making a pass at him. And each time Draco's insides had clenched in a tight knot, afraid that Harry would agree. But for some reason Harry had turned down everyone, saying he had someone special he wanted to take.
Sirius shrugged. “Well, lord Malfoy, you heard the boy. Looks like Draco is staying here after all.”
More tears fell down his cheeks. "Fuck!" He cursed under his breath, angrily wiping them away.  But they kept falling. "Shit! Don't--"
“Yeah?” Harry’s voice was soft as he hugged Draco from behind, resting his chin on his shoulder.
“Hello,” a male voice said from the other side, sounding all professional and official. “Am I speaking to Mr. Malfoy?”
want to?"
Luckily, Harry had asked Draco to stay. Well, he mostly made excuses to keep Draco, but Draco got the hint and took no time in packing all his stuff and shifting in with Harry.
Harry just wrapped his arms around Draco protectively, softly stroking his back. “I missed you, too,” he mumbled back, just as softly, and his arms tightened around Draco. Soon after, he fell asleep, too.
Draco grimaced, finaly catching on. “I did
Draco grip on the door knob tightened. “If she wants me then she can come get me herself.”
Draco lifted his head and stared at the lock screen of his cell phone. It was a picture of him and Harry, together, sleeping soundly on the couch, with Draco above Harry, his face buried in Harry’s chest and his head tucked under Harry’s chin. Harry’s arms were wrapped protectively around Draco, saving him from everything.
It hit the opposite wall, and shattered. Just like him. Its light went out, reminding Draco of how his life was about to become. Dark and broken and irreparable.
Teddy’s cheeks flushed with anger and he glared at Harry, who stuck his tongue out in response.
They broke apart and Harry rolled his eyes at Teddy’s disgusted face and Draco snickered, dropping his head on Harry’s shoulder.
“Yeah?” He said distractedly, eyes on the pan as he flipped the last of the pancakes.
. And Harry would kiss him back, promising that he would try his best, and that he would never leave Draco to suffer through his nightmares alone, or to deal with this harsh world alone.
“Hey! let him go!” Harry was at his side in an instant, pushing at Lucius to break his grip on Draco’s wrist and placing himself protectively between them, shielding Draco away from his father.
Remus sighed, “Teddy, there is more yogurt in the fridge–”
sacrificed my beauty sleep from time to time to be with you. That's as obvious as it gets. Even Blaise knew, and he is a slut who only concerns himself with the matters of his dick, and even he saw that I was arse over tit for you!"
“So," Harry said haltingly, almost hesitant. “Now that you know everything, may I kiss you?”
Harry just blinked back at him. And Draco realised that Harry, stupid, idiot, modest, wearing-his-heart-on-his-sleeve, dorky Harry, really did think that Draco would reject him.
He hated it! Hated the way Harry was leaning against the counter in that easy confident way of his, with his strong arms wrapped around Wood's waist as the Quidditch star nipped and licked at Harry's neck while Harry chuckled before leaning down and catching his lips in a heated kiss.
“I am sorry, I so sorry that you had to go through this...” Harry continued to apologise, tears rolling down his cheek as he hugged Draco like a life line and buried his face into his soft blond hair, kissing the top of his head again and again between his apologise.
All in all it was a blissfull summer morning at The Black-Lupin’s.
Wrapping his arms around Harry's neck, Draco kissed him back with fervour, almost climbing onto Harry's lap.
"I said that because I thought you were going  with some one else and I didn't want to—you know..."
“No they don’t!” Teddy agrued. “They love
Peels of shrill laughter filled the house as Teddy struggled and tried to get away, while Harry pulled up his shirt and blew loud, wet raspberries on his tummy, easily holding down Teddy until the boy relented, admitting defeat.
“What do you want?”
At first it had been awkward, and more than once he had caught Harry glaring at someone or pointedly shutting them up if they tried to say anything mean or degrading to Draco and his friends. Yes, Harry had been kind enough to extend his generosity and his forgiveness to Draco's friends too, so that Draco didn't have to come to these gatherings alone. The noble, pure, giant hearted idiot that Harry was, how could anyone not fall for him?
Draco held up his hands in a gesture of dramatic defeat. "I shared my desserts with you
Draco looked at the door through which the two men had just left. “I think it’s sweet, though, that they are still crazy for each other, even after so many year,” he murmured, his eyes flitting to Harry. “I would love to be like that with someone when I am their age. Have what they have.”
The mug slipped out of Draco’s grasp and hit the floor, shattering into several pieces.
This time they ignored the mock gagging sounds that Teddy made in the background, like the hypocrits they were. It seemed like they had no right to criticise Sirius and Remus.
He gulped, suddenly feeling a little nauseous, then brought the phone to his hear, “He—hello,” he croaked, unable to speak.
But he didn’t wait for Harry to respond before rushing after Sirius, a hungry look in his eyes as he climbed two steps at a time.
“Oh, do you, now?” Harry grinned and picked up the 6 year old, throwing him over his shoulder like a sack of potatoes as Teddy thrashed and flailed, hitting Harry’s back. Harry guffawed, dumping the boy on the couch in the living room before viciously attacking him with tickles.
Draco blinked, his lips parting in shock. He was still a little dazed and incredulous at the turn of events. The first kiss had been sudden, barely giving Draco any time to think before he had reacted. But this time it would be for real.
Harry raised an eyebrow.
But Harry wasn’t there now. He didn’t come back, and he wasn’t coming back. Draco gripped the phone tightly and flung it across the room with a strangled cry.
Draco pulled back again, just to look at Harry, to reassure himself. “God, I was so worried,” he choked out. “I thought...I thought...” he couldn’t finish his sentences as he choked on his sob. He buried his face into Harry’s chest, clutching the front of his robes into his small fists as a fresh wave of tears hit him. “I though I lost you,” he cried, “they said you didn’t come back and I thought you...you—” he hiccupped, still not able to get the words out. “You...” he hit Harry’s chest, crying and sobbing and screaming, “I thought something happened to you,” he cried hitting Harry’s chest over and over again, and Harry didn’t stop him. “I thought I would die, you bastard! It hurt so much, I thought I would die!”
He was so lost that he didn’t notice the sound of the main door opening, he didn’t notice the footsteps, didn’t hear someone shouting his name at the top of their lungs as they made their way towards the kitchen.
“I tried! I tried to ask you but I kept chickning out and then you said that you were going with Pansy."
He shouted and mumbled—random promises—begging Harry to
Slowly, the heated kisses turned gentle and light and lazy, and Harry finally pulled away, his hand still on Draco's cheek, the thumb of his other hand tracing circles on Draco's back, teasing the hem of his shirt where it had ridden up.
The place where his heart should be felt hollow and painful, and heavy, and it ached! It ached so bad. Worse than the cruciatus, because at least the pain of the curse always ended. But this? This heart break? This loss? No. Draco already knew that this was a wound that would never heal.
“Maybe,” she smiled, “but I don’t think you’ll make me regret it.” She patted his arm softly. As if sensing that he would try to continue the argument, she rose to her feet. “Get some rest, Mr. Malfoy. If you still feel like it, you can try to convince me otherwise tomorrow.”
He continued to be astounded by her willingness to try to help him. “Even if you have to show them a memory of our conversation in a pensieve, I’d be glad to only have to do this once.”
Lily nodded. “Professor Lupin; I believe he taught defense against the dark arts.”
For the second time in just a few moments, there was no word for it beyond “dumbfounded.” Had he ever been asked that before? What did he need in that moment? “I think I’d like…a shower,” he said haltingly, thinking about washing the entirety of their conversation off of his body. He didn’t know how long it’d been since he’d been allowed to shower. He could tell that he’d been cleaned up—his skin was bright and healthy, though as pale as ever—but he wanted the physical act of it. “Is that possible?” He could hear the hope tinge his voice.
She smiled sadly then. “It’s not that I never see them, but it isn’t often any longer. I’m the only healer the Order has right now, and depending on what’s happening, that can be a pretty busy position to be in. And it can be a dangerous position, being associated with the Order; I have to be scarce to protect them.”
“I’ll rest much better knowing that I’m near him,” he assured her. He knew this was too vulnerable, too intimate a statement to make to a stranger, but he couldn’t find the energy to stop himself, to hold his mask up.
She chuckled. “Yes of course; I’d be surprised if you weren’t curious. My healing magic has always been advanced and apprenticing with such a renowned healer opened doors for me that most other apprenticeships wouldn’t have. Still, few places would even finish interviews with me when they found out how young I was, but the Order took a chance on me.”
“I have every reason to believe so,” she said. “The first few days were very touch and go—he’d been bleeding internally and there were some complications with his magic—but he’s been stable for the past two days. He’s under stasis currently to give him more time to heal, but in the next few days I’ll lift that and see how he does on his own.”
She must have felt the fear in him, or seen it wash suddenly over his face. She pushed more of her warm magic toward him. “You can stay in here with him for now if you like. He needs a lot of monitoring so if that disturbs you and you can’t rest then we’ll have to make an adjustment, but for now I’m fine with it if you feel you’ll be able to rest.”
“It is important for us to know what happened,” the man interjected from behind them. For the first time, Draco recognized his voice, put it together with his more ragged appearance, connecting both to a professor they’d had at Hogwarts but struggling to attach a name. “Harry has been missing for over a month. We all feared the worst. And you’ll excuse me if I have concerns about him showing up in the condition he was in, with you, given your history.”
“Five hours,” Draco replied. “What time is it?”
“Have you forgotten what he’s done?” The other man—Remus, Draco remembered—said then, his volume increasing astronomically as his frustration clearly boiled over.
The other boy could not even be considered upright at this point. Draco was shouldering the majority of his body weight as he dragged him along the corridor, Harry’s feet shuffling against the hard dirt as he struggled to make his body do anything. He was so weak; his head and his legs felt like concrete. Everything he saw was dark and fuzzy, with occasional flashes of lights behind his eyes. He knew that Draco was trying his absolute best, that he needed to stay awake and do whatever he could to keep his legs moving somehow so as not to burden him any further, but he felt like that possibility was getting further and further away. He couldn’t keep his eyes open, could barely sustain his hold around Draco’s waist, but he knew this was their best chance at staying alive, and he had to do something.
“Draco, we appreciate that,” the woman interjected, putting herself between him and the other man as if to offer further protection. “But it’s too soon. You’ve been through a lot and
Draco considered for a moment arguing, telling her this was unnecessary, but he decided against it. With his luck he would fall and Professor Lupin would find him, in the same poor mood he’d been in the previous day. He didn’t need anyone finding him in a vulnerable position, but he acknowledged that if it had to happen, Lily was the safest person. “Thank you,” he said quietly, doing his best to put as much sincerity into his voice as possible. She nodded again and slipped out the door, leaving him alone. He decided it was best not to take his chances, stepping into the stone shower and setting himself down on the bench before attempting to remove his clothes. He hadn’t seen his full body in a while, certainly not in a well-lit space, and while he’d spent an inordinate amount of time chained naked in the dungeons, he’d long ago learned to stop looking, knowing that watching his body deteriorate didn’t help him. He looked hungrily now, curious to see what shape he was in. He was shocked at how thin he’d become, how clearly he could identify each rib under all of this light. He knew he’d likely gained weight since he arrived here, and he shuddered to think what he had looked like upon his arrival.
“Can we do this now? I think…I think I want it to be over.”
Draco sat stunned for a moment. He felt like his emotions had been playing tug-of-war with his insides for the entirety of the time he’d been awake. He wanted to believe her. After such a long time being the only one looking out for himself, he wanted to believe that someone else would carry some of the load. Still, it felt too risky to believe her.
“You don’t get to see your family?” He asked then, again startling himself with his care for and interest in her. It’d been so long since he’d spoken to someone outside the manor, and he’d never spoken to someone like her.
She sighed. “At some point, yes, there will certainly be an investigative interview; I imagine it’ll be Remus and maybe Kingsley who you’ll speak to, though it could be a number of people, depending who is available. But it’s not the expectation that you share all of the traumas you experienced in that space.”
“Harry came out of stasis well,” Lily told him the next morning. “He probably still won’t wake for a couple more days, but he’s remained stable for the past five hours.”
Breaking above the tunnel into the light of day was something more beautiful than he’d felt in a long time. It was freezing in November in Wiltshire, and a steady drizzle soaked him through in seconds, but he couldn’t help the levity he felt in his chest. This was the first fresh air he’d seen in almost a year. He fell to the ground in exhaustion and gratitude, mud soaking through the thin linen of the pants Wipsy had brought them. He sucked in air like the tunnel had been underwater. He heard Harry fall with a thud beside him and knew that this feeling of freedom and levity was short-lived. There was no time to bask in their escape. Harry wasn’t conscious and in this cold rain he’d only sink further, faster. Draco knelt next to him and felt for his wrist with a shaking hand. He felt the thrum of a pulse under Harry’s skin and felt relief, but the relief was tempered by dread with the realization of how unsteady and quiet that pulse had become. Throwing sense and fear to the wind, Draco wrapped his arms tightly around Harry’s lifeless form. He reached for the warmth of his magic and tried with everything he had left to wrap its protective heat around Harry. With that, he gulped one last deep breath of air and felt himself twist into nothingness.
“How badly was I injured?” He hadn’t really allowed himself to think about this before, to wonder about his own wellbeing even after he knew that Harry was going to be okay. Knowing that it’d been almost ten days and he was still sleeping almost constantly, he wondered just how close they’d come to serious trouble.
,” Draco said then, the word “noble” coming out more like an insult than he intended.
This question surprised Draco, though he didn’t know why. It would’ve made sense for that to be the case. He almost wished that it had been. He shook his head. “No…it was a couple—the day before I left. It was the day before I left for Hogwarts the first time.”
Draco looked up at her wearily. “It really is alright. He has no reason to trust me, even less if he knew me at school. He was a professor at Hogwarts a couple of years ago, wasn’t he?”
The woman came into view then: maybe his age or a year older, she was slender, fair-skinned, with caramel-colored hair, deep blue eyes, and a warm, genuine smile. Draco tried to hold onto his panic, knowing that letting his guard down was unwise, but he felt himself disarmed by this gentle presence, the first woman he’d seen in many months, and the first friendly human face he’d seen outside Harry’s in even longer.
“They really did almost kill us, didn’t they?” Draco knew it came out as a question, though a hardly audible one, but he already knew the answer. He’d waited too long to get he and Harry out of there. They’d come too close to not making it out at all.
The healer flashed him a nasty glare as he edged forward next to her. The man seemed unapologetic. “I’ve done a lot of things I’m not proud of.” Draco said softly, staring down at his pale hands, following the lines of his fingerprints with his eyes to steady himself. “I am prepared to be held accountable for my crimes.” He did not have anything to argue this man with. He had done horrible things. He was sure the man had seen him do some level of terrible thing at school—it was who he was at the time. And it didn’t stop there. He was responsible for Dumbledore’s death. He was responsible for people being maimed by Greyback. He did not doubt that Wipsy was dead now, the latest in a long line of cruelties his existence inflicted on the world. He was spiraling, he knew, but he didn’t have anything left to fight with. He’d been fighting for so long, for months, years, though he had to admit he’d long given up fighting before Harry came back into his life.
. He thought again. “Where is he?” He croaked, his voice tight and pained. He struggled to look around again, agonizing over the possibility that Harry was lost, that he hadn’t kept his promise, that he hadn’t kept him safe.
“Mr. Potter is in the room next to this one. He’s in rough shape, but I believe he’ll be okay. It was touch and go… for a while, but I believe he’s through the worst of it.”
She nodded. “We may have had a class or two together first or second year. And my sister was Head Girl, so the name might be familiar. She had finished her seventh year the year before and without her there my parents were too afraid for me to stay, so they decided to continue my schooling at home. I do miss it, but it afforded me a unique opportunity. My parents were friends with a renowned healer, the head of St. Mungo’s magical traumas ward, and a part of my schooling from home was apprenticing under a healer for those next four years.”
“We need to go there? Where is it? How do we get there from Wiltshire?” But Draco knew that Harry wouldn’t answer any of these questions. He grew heavier against Draco’s side, with Draco heaving him up again, hoisting Harry’s arm up and over his shoulders so that he could carry as much of Harry’s weight as possible. “Great.” He whispered to himself. His plan beyond this tunnel was almost non-existent. Wipsy, his favorite house elf since he was young, had told him to follow the tunnel until it brought him above ground about a half mile outside of the manor grounds. She had told him that then he’d need to apparate to safety, that she’d keep everyone occupied as long as she could, but that the wards would trigger against their absence and she would only be able to stop it for so long. Draco felt the path growing steadily more uphill as he dragged a now-unconscious Harry with him. He knew he’d only be able to go on for so much longer, and he hoped with everything he had that the end was coming soon. He didn’t know how he’d manage to apparate when he did get outside the wards—he felt so weak, and apparating without a wand was already so much more exhausting, let alone with 150lbs of dead weight at his side. He briefly considered leaving Harry in the tunnel and making his way outside the wards alone where he could apparate away. He knew that this was the coward in him talking, knew that any attempt he made to convince himself that he could make it back to Harry before he was found was a poor lie he was telling himself.
“Okay,” she nodded. “Whatever you want to tell me, I’m here to listen.”
He nodded and took the phial, “Draco, please, you can call me Draco.”
Draco shook his head. “No, it’s okay. Harry and I have talked about a lot of this. He knows a lot of what happened.”
Draco felt his eyes tear up then, thinking about the past year, about the past many years. He felt the enormity of it and the weight of relief that he might finally be safe, at least for now. He knew she could make assumptions about what he’d experienced based on the kinds of injuries he’d endured, and he tried his best not to think about what kind of picture that might paint, about the assumptions she’d made about what he’d experienced and from whom, but that didn’t stop him from picturing what had actually happened. He felt a hand on his arm then, felt a flood of warmth from that place that tingled like unfamiliar magic. It stilled him, calmed the excessive beating of his heart. “Thank you,” he whispered, his eyes still glistening.
Draco could feel the tears well in his eyes for the first time, the feelings of confusion and helplessness in his gut as if he were stuck back in that chair. He felt her come closer, clearly wanting to show she was near him but not wanting to touch him without his permission. He felt thankful for her in a way he hadn’t expected. “He left me there for…a while…I don’t know how long. Half-naked and covered in…him. He walked around and did things…sent letters, did just…ordinary things. While he left me there like that. When he finally let me up…he…he told me he couldn’t wait until I was home next so he could see me like that again.” He felt the tears spill over, but he pressed on. “He swore I’d be disowned if I said anything… He said it was…special…just for us. And it went on like that for…a long time.”
He winced at her pointed nod to his current position. He propped himself up with an arm behind his back and she took pity on him, gathering herself up off the floor and offering him support to stand. After a few moments, the feeling returned to his legs. He felt steadier than he had when he’d tried to stand earlier but knew that he shouldn’t push it too far. She helped him back into bed and adjusted his blankets over him. “I know that physically I’m not up to much,” he acknowledged hesitantly, “but I know it must be important for you to know what I know, or at least to understand what happened.”
“Need—to get—safe—we’ll… be safe.”
“Okay,” she smiled gently. Draco wondered briefly if she found that odd, but if she did, she certainly didn’t make it known. “If you’re sure. Are you ready?” He nodded slowly, steeling himself for what was to come. She paused then too, clearly trying to decide the best way to start this conversation, the question to ask first. After several long, drawn-out moments, she spoke. “How long has this been happening to you, Draco?”
“I do trust him; I spoke to him yesterday, and he was worried about Harry. He wasn’t worried about himself, didn’t ask what would happen to him, just wanted to assure that Harry was okay. That boy went through just as much trauma as Harry did, and there’s no need for us to traumatize him further. When he is well, you can speak to him, but until then you and I have nothing more to say to one another.”
“Draco!” She exclaimed, skidding to a halt in front of him and dropping to her knees. “What happened? Are you okay?”
“I know you say you trust him, but if you trust him as much as you say, what is the harm in letting us talk to him?”
“Not much,” she agreed, tipping her head in acknowledgement. “But enough to think that I might enjoy knowing you better.”
“Oh, it was,” she said earnestly, smiling. “But my family hated the idea of me working privately for anyone, let alone in the middle of the war. They felt it was much too dangerous, let alone not particularly good for my resume if things turned out poorly. And of course, they wanted me to be available to them, to be able to see them as I pleased.”
"You and Harry should open the presents at the same time," Andromeda said. "While they are unique, they are the same."
Charlie picked a stem, let it fall into a glass test tube, corked it and put it in his pocket. "I usually collect on demand, but in a place like this I can't help but collect some and see if they want them, and if they don't.. Well." He shrugged.
"Star struck, Harry?" Andromeda asked but the smile and twinkle in her eye showed amusement and made it clear she thought it adorable.
"So there's no crime here?" Harry tried to wrap his mind around it and wasn't succeeding.
Harry Potter yawned, another day, another early morning. Until he saw the time. Harry cursed, left his breakfast uneaten and dashed off, running through the streets because he was late for work. He always opened his shop at eight precise. Today, for the first time in a good while, he had to hurry. Out of breath, he slid the key in its slot and turned it. He waited patiently for the wired security gate to move up and pushed the glassed door open when the gate had clicked into its place above his head. By the time he clicked the lights on, he had caught his breath and flew over to the desk, where the phone was already ringing.
"And?" She enquired. She stood up with difficulty, patting Teddy and gave a jerk of the head to Harry who stepped over and picked the toddler up. He smiled brightly, positioned Teddy on one hip and waved the papers at Andromeda.
"We have a Mayor who can pass judgement I'd say," Charlie said after he thought about it for a while. "And maybe, if it's truly needed, one of his bodyguards can fill the role of muscle man. I'd say."
The process had taken long enough, Harry shoo-ed Draco out of the room and back into the front." Wait a moment," Harry said and got behind the desk, he quickly duplicated the list and slid it into a drawer. He went into the backroom and collected his materials. "Ok. Get in there." He pointed at the other door that led to his workspace when he came back into the front.
They smiled at each other and checked out the last few eggs left. When they reached the last eggs, a nest full of blue ones with a flower pattern almost invisible by the amount of sunflowers surrounding it, Charlie happily clapped in his hands. "I know its almost dinner time but really, now we seen the eggs, it's time to fly with the babies!"
Still, trying and hoping she was wrong, she took another step and called out again, utter fear evident in her voice but she got no confirmation from either boy. Crouching down, she reached out a shaky hand and gently touched Harry's cheek. She slinked back, falling on her bum and her whole body shook, eyes welling up. He was ice cold.
"Where is the owner?" Ron barked.
"I could ask you the same, Potter." Draco pointed his key at the door and it beeped as it locked. "I think, I have more reason to be here then you. Seeing as this is my family I am visiting."
The new year was a simple affair. Naps at noon, bite sized dishes amd dessert to snack on throuh the evening, and a splendid firework show. Harry was hesitant to light the fireworks he'd gotten, but the Weasley twins had not been lying. were just regular fireworks. They'd hugged and drank some good ol' meads while they talked in the livingroom before they'd headed to bed in the early hours.
They came home and settled into the living room where they updated Andromeda. She listened quietly, bouncing Teddy on her lap as the boys rattled to her. When they were done, she sighed, a decision made. "I might've to describe to the Prophet again."
Draco wasn't so sure. In all honesty, he preferred to turn and leave but Harry's ease numbed the feeling and he decided that, if Harry deemed it safe enough to press on, he should too. Surely, Harry wasn't that bad in judging.
"Got it, and what if I, for example, want to know where to go?" Harry questioned.
Draco agreed and then rummaged to the other stack. Almost all countries further then France and Germany also were put on the stack. "Might as well not go there then too."
Harry agreed with her and they talked briefly but she too, busy as she was, went on with her work and left them to their own devices.
"Political stuff and whatnot," Harry guessed. "Bleeding arseholes."
"It's such a hassle though." Harry bemoaned and Draco seconded that fact with a nod of the head.
They stared at one another and tension rose in the room. Ronald Weasley looked positively murderous and Ginny Weasley didn't do much better, she even scuffed her feet over the floor and she tried to hide the grab at her wand but Draco's keen eyes noticed the movement.
Andromeda sighed and adjusted Teddy's hat. "Get ready, we'll be leaving in five."
As a leaf on a tree dancing in the wind, Solomon shifted moods. He cleared his throat and with an outstretched hand, made a beeline for Harry. Shocked by this, Harry took a step back. Solomon saw, and stopped abruptly, a sheepish laugh escaped him. "I know I can be a bit intimidating, sorry 'bout earlier," He now shuffled closer, slowly. "And about now." He added.
"Relax in the garden, prune and collect items requested by the Apothecary." Charlie revealed. "The weather is great to do so, tomorrow."
Harry chuckled. "I'll skip."
"Occupied." Which was, technically the truth. He waved the papers. "I'll serve him the summons but out of curiosity, what will happen if he doesn't comply?"
Harry wanted to ask why he had such, in his eyes, unnecessary series but he thought the better of it; he didn't even want to know so he scooped another book up. "This one then?"
Couldn't or wouldn't they see the pain within them?
Harry rolled his eyes but indeed got to wrapping. He'd only managed to wrap Andromeda's presents upstairs before Draco became unbearable and he'd moved spaces. Draco wrapped his perfectly in shiny, dark blue paper with twinkling stars and silver bows. Harry's on the other hand, done shabby but with effort in reds and greens, with too much stickers and other decorations. Eitherway, once both boys were done, they loaded Draco's car full and rode to the postal service to owl out all their presents. That evening during dinner, they finalized their plans and every now and then, they needed to let an owl in, bringing gifts for them.
This time, Harry reacted, his eyes flew open and he turned to his side. A load of vomit escaped him and he rolled back. Looking up at the worried face of the woman above him he croaked out a thanks and closed his eyes again.
Harry tried real hard not to sound whiny but he was really fed up with his situation and failed to keep the tone out of his speech: "Can I have my wand back now?"
"Good, because really," He exhaled exaggerated. "I can't cook that well. I'll say, bacon and eggs are pretty good but there will be not three course elegance at dinner coming from me. Now pretty please, move along!"
From that day on, the boys set on making an effort to erase the air between them. While it could not be called hatred but certainly could be called a severe dislike, it needed to be gone and if not for their sake, definitely for the family sake. They both had heart for Teddy and Andromeda Tonks.
"Wait, what?" Harry popped his ear. "Did you just?" He asked incredulously.
He knew the Harry was useless by now. He had hissed his name a few time but got no response. "Shit."
Draco examined the stone, an intricate piece of work, he realized. He would say, both his latin and rune-reading was fairly well but half of the words and symbols etched into the black stone were unfamiliar. Harry walked towards the window and pushed the curtains open. He saw the storm still going strong and his heart sunk. "As long as the stone is on my person when I need to discharge the overflow of magic, I can't be found and nothing worse but the weather is affected. If it's not on me while it happens.." He let the words die out and closed the curtains. Completely devastated, Harry slipped to the floor and hugged his knees.
The blonde boy hesitated for a moment to create a firm voice, summing it all up. "Well, no, I'm not crazy and, no.. no, no and no.. And hell no, I will not leave you alone. Why would I do that?"
"No, we can't." Harry agreed and the plans were set.
It was well passed dinner and Andromeda Tonks sat on the couch where she was twiddling her thumbs, staring out of the window without as much of a blink. Every once in a while, she checked the clock and the hours were ticking away. By now, she knew, the potion in Harry must have ran its course and should be gone. The boys however, still weren't back. Suffice to say, she was worried. They hadn't replaced the emergency pen yet and it scared her, thus, she remained where she was, hoping they would be back soon, preferably with Harry still alive and in no immediate danger.
"Registered and taxed," Charlie sighed. "I sell my harvest at the Apothecary in town, and they sell it to customers and other shops around the world."
It suited Harry just fine, although it was odd sometimes, he acknowledged that. They were on the other side of the same coin, they could understand each other more in depth then Harry's friends ever had, even if they shared most experiences with him. It was some kind of comfort hearing the other side of his suffering. Never mind the fact that Draco and Andromeda were the only ones he now could hold a conversation with, the letters between him and his friends at Hogwarts dwindling to almost nonexistence for all the explaining Harry did fell to deaf ears.
"But what if?" Harry pressed.
It took awhile to get the upset Teddy calmed down. In order to do so, they opened Teddy's presents first, leaving Draco's last forgotten. Teddy's gifts were simple, some clothes, a book that read itself out loud, a ball and from Harry and Draco he'd gotten a toy car he could ride around in the garden. Teddy was immediately taken with it. Although Andromeda rather had Teddy not riding it in the home, she couldn't deny the bright-eyed toddler from playing with it. "It'll be weeks before he can play with it outside." Andromeda sighed.
Harry knew in his in the back of his mind that spells didn't do well on old books, because really, he was forbidden to use any magic in any way on or near the books; multiple times. Even house elf magic wasn't allowed. Making up his mind, he shrugged and started levitating the books one by one to their place on the shelf. Damn that rule. Damn that ladder. Damn this library. Damn the fact I'll be in trouble later. Damn it all. When he reached eyelevel he started picking the books up by hand. He trusted them onto the shelves venting off his anger. He heard some rips and crackling but he didn't care. Books onto the shelves, no matter how and getting the hell out of the doomed place was the only thing he could think about.
"This," Charlie said as they came close to the rectangular building, positively giddy of excitement. "This is the nursery! The building is old, creaky and overgrown, I know, but it's important and really, really cool!"
All was said and done with laughter and Harry was glad, very glad he'd come here. He hadn't been here long but was already feeling happy, lighter and Charlie's tongue in the cheek attitude was a welcome change of pace.
"Shit." Draco yelped, only now realizing Harry overcame his panic attack and channelled out his magic build up from the stress through the stone.
For now, they still had a bit of shopping to do. At least Draco had, Harry gotten his presents done already but decided a drop into Madam Malkin's Robes for all Occasions wasn't wasted. He would go see if she did muggle clothing and fancy him a riding suit. The thought of a dragon leather suit, maybe some charms for safety was enticing.
"Yeah," He nodded. "I like it here, its peaceful and.. Easy, I suppose."
Charlie winced. "We don't have an Auror office around here."
It was late at night, well beyond curfew and everything inside the big castle was empty and dark, it looked like all the students were asleep, but they weren't.
Draco nodded and lazily dropped himself on the comfortable bed in the middle of the room, waiting for Harry to get himself ready to start.
"To understand I'll have to explain the original plan behind the Sanctuary in a nutshell."
Harry laughed brightly and breathlessly happy when he saw who exactly got him out. Even if he was a blur, Harry recognised him always. There was Ron Weasley smiling, cheekily so, for the roles of saving had been reversed and Harry jumped onto him, hugging him tight.
"It's another one." Harry said, confused. He pulled at Charlie's sleeve to stop him.
"He did." Andromeda answered and turned to leave. "I'll leave you to it. They're yours now. Add, erase or discard as you wish, but, I do remember you saying-"
Thus, knowing that; Harry had sourly set off, feeling that it was the same story as the front door and had taken a bottle of fire whiskey up. Not even intending to try. After a few hours, he had, with a sarcastic stance and in an unmistakably drunk drunk state, twirled and bowed after smashing the bottle broken on the door. Then, he had gone on by turning around, giving a roar and skipping over the mud puddles, another mishap in the house, to the master bedroom. Harry had never heard the tick of the door opening but Draco had heard the roar, gone up, seen the door stand ajar and smiled when he had followed Harry into the bedroom.
Euphoria. That was the word for how they felt.
Draco ran a hand over his face and through his hair. It all happened so fast. The bell rang. Voices were heard that Harry recognized and panicked. He himself panicked.
"The Bermuda Triangle Island?"
Draco was about to tell Harry he had a nice place but the thunk next to him foiled it. He ran a hand over his face. Here he was, drenched and windswept completely wrecked after the ordeal he hadn't even began to process and Harry fainted.
Gavriil, a short and little overweight man turned out to be very nice, albeit in his own way. He didn't speak much and barking seemed his default setting. He wore working overalls, almost had no hair left an while he wore the same atrocious glasses as Harry, they seemed to fit by his face rather well, which, spiked a jealous sting in Harry. Why didn't they look good on him, he wondered but never cared to replace them nor would he anytime soon and he shrugged it off.
"Hey mate" Ron said coming out of the room and leaning on the door frame smiling.
But then the boy in question turned around and Harry gasped as fear gripped his body. Not cause he was scared of the boy that had just turned around, but because that boy was Draco Malfoy, and Harry thought he looked rather handsome.
I’m sorry I’ve been so inactive lately, but I’m just not really feeling this fic anymore. It’s not getting too much attention on here anyways but I figured that any readers who do check in on this fic should know that I’m not planning on continuing it. I might of course but I’m just not vibing with it anymore. We’ll see what happens in the future but until then consider this fic abandoned.
Suddenly his eyes settle on a boy who's off in the corner talking to some others, he wasn't sure who it is but he sure was good looking, even from the back Harry could tell that he had a toned figure and he could definitely see he had a nice ass even through the robes he was wearing.
Draco was silent for a moment before he says, his voice laced with anger and hatred. "Why do I care? Why do I care?! Well believe it or not Potter but unfortunately I care about you you overgrown barn rat. I am infuriatingly and unforgivably cursed by your stupid emerald eyes and dumb messy raven hair that gives me the irresistible urge to run my fingers through it to tame it down. I hate you and everything you stand for and yet I can't help but notice when you don't eat or sleep or change something and great Merlin I am unfortunately I'm love with you you-"
Eventually a carriage pulled up in front of them and Ron and Hermione moved to get in. But Harry couldn't bring himself to move because instead of the carriages pulling themselves there was something in front! A big black skeletal being that looked vaguely like a horse was pulling each carriage!
"Your not coming with me?" Harry said, a tad nervously.
"Who are all these people?" Harry asked Moody.
He'd thought he'd been getting a bit better, but as these thing tend to happen, the pressure kept mounting and eventually Harry had to do something about it so he found himself in a bathroom between classes, distractedly muttering the same cutting curse he'd been using for weeks which backfired on him because he cut a little too deep for his liking. He'd been in the middle of watching the blood flow when he heard footsteps and who should walk in but Draco bloody Malfoy, but that wasn't even the surprising part. That was the look of alarm on Draco's face when he took in the scene.
Sirius was the first to speak. "Of course you would want to join Harry. And I feel you have the right to know some things. But you aren't old enough to join the Order just yet. I will tell you what you need to know a little later."
Harry laughed and they kissed and talked and cuddled and talked some more and eventually the two boys fell into silence. Harry could think of no better place to be right now, huddled up with his boyfriend under a heating charm they'd cast watching the stars. He let his guard down and he felt genuinely happy for the first time in a very very long time. He'd worry about Ron and Hermione and the future another day, right now all he wanted to focus on was how Dracos hair turned silver in the moonlight and how relaxed he looked. He was content to spend the rest of his life there with him and never move at all from where Draco had laid them down. Harry didn't think that his life could get bad again because all he could think about was his boyfriends heartbeat and hopefully lasting relationship. Nothing could ever possibly stain that relationship could it?
"Well it sure looked like it? If no one did it then-" a look of understanding dawns on his face and he sneers weakly "figures the chosen one would harm himself. What, looking for attention on famous potter? And it's Malfoy to you"
Once he took the badge the bottom of the telephone box started moving down like an elevator until he could see the shining floors and grand entrance hall of the Ministry.
In fact it almost felt. Good. Like a release. Harry stood there for a few seconds marvelling at how it felt and then cleaned himself up and went back to chopping the potatoes.
"Yes mame."
"Hello Harry"
Hey guys,
Eventually they managed to get off the door and stood on the first step of Number 12 Grimmauld Place. Mr Weasley offered Harry his arm and as soon as Harry took it, apparated them to a deserted muggle street. They crept down the block to an old telephone box where Mr Weasley punched in 5 numbers then held the receiver to his ear.
Harry followed him into the courtroom and took a seat in the lonely chair in the middle of the room.
Hogwarts.
Harry loved flying. It's one of the best feelings and if he's being honest the first time he's felt close to happy in a long time.
Harry intoned in an almost venomous voice, before walking out the room and thundering down the stairs to the door of the kitchens where the meeting was being held.
Someone was speaking to him. He turned around to see Hermione trying to get his attention.
"Where do you reckon Dr-Malfoy is?"
As he walked through the castle Harry couldn't help but feel sorry for himself. Well, who could blame him really. Umbridge was a bitch, Snape was a being a git, and of course Harry had to go falling in love with his bloody arch nemesis. It was like something out of a depressing movie.
"Dumbledore made us promise not to tell..." Hermione faltered. Harry looked absolutely murderous.
"I have to tell all of you something"
The next morning Harry woke up around noon and went down for a late brunch that Ms Weasley had made up, and then went straight back upstairs to pack up his trunk.
"What's with the things pulling the carriages this year?"  He asked vaguely to Hermione and Ron.
He sat down and waited for them to call him in. He was just starting to wonder whether he was just supposed to go in when someone came through the doors to the courtroom.
As Harry and Draco's affair continued their feelings for eachother only grew, of course they had to keep up the act of antagonizing eachother in public buy in private it was laughs and fuzz. Harry's main problem was worrying about Hermione and Ron.
"God why does this always happen to me" He whispers to himself after a while.
It was the usual latter half of the summer vacation for him. Hanging out with Ron and Hermione, catching up on homework, and Ms Weasley giving him third helpings at every meal. It was so normal he almost forgot about the trial. That is until Mr Weasley reminded him the night before.
Obviously Harry did a double take as he was wearing what could be considered pyjamas by the way they looked rumpled and worn in. Harry found himself looking down at the mans abs and forced himself to look up, tho he couldn't stop himself licking his lips just the once.
As soon as Hermione let go of him he went quietly up to his dorm. As much as he loved Hermione she could be a bit much sometimes. And all he wanted to do right now was take some time to himself to let the fake smile fall off his face and relax. He was having a bad day, usually the numbness took over and Harry was happy to let it do that so he didn’t have to feel the sad, but today it hasn’t leaving Harry to survive all day with bone crushing sadness weighing him down like a 1000 pound weight over his head. So Harry went and did the only thing he knew how to do on days like these to make it easier.
"Uh. You coming mate?" Ron poked his head out. Harry climbed in a confused look on his face.
"What do you mean Harry, nothings pulling the carriages. Nothing ever has..." Hermione said, a concerned edge to her voice.
manner and then turned begrudgingly away from the beautiful boy next to him to look at the blackboard where Snape was explaining the project.
"Alright". Harry nodded.
"What? Who's that Harry?" Hermione asked. Harry pointed up to wear she was talking to Dumbledore.
Harry is a confused sad baby gay
Harry glanced down at the schedule Draco had made for them after their last positions class and noticed that he was on duty to stir the potion that night. It was almost getting too late to go down so he grabbed the invisibility cloak just in case and slipped out the portrait hole.
He looked on in disbelief as Number 11 and Number 13 Grimmauld Place started shaking and moving apart to reveal a grim greyish black coloured building between them. The lights shook and things rattled all around but the Muggles didn't seem to notice. There must be some sort of magic on the place then thought Harry.
"Molly, dear remember that if he didn't have this trial he would be expelled" Mr Weasley gently reminded his wife.
"The whole summer."  Ron said so quietly it could have been a whisper.
Harry is late for detention with our least favourite toad bitch and he feels the pain, literally. Ron and Hermione are protective QUEENS
He for some reason hadn't gotten into too much trouble at the Dursley's, Aunt Petunia has miraculously defended him after receiving a strange howler.
Harry froze at the husky sound to his voice and obediently stood still as the older boy raked his gaze along Harry's body. He then tentatively took a step towards Harry as though nervous and then quickly shook himself and backed away. Draco suddenly looked very uncomfortable.
"Maybe because I don't want my potions partner dying on me? Who did that"
Classes that day went pretty much as usual, nothing out of the ordinary.
His meetings with Draco got less frequent as he was studious as well and he found himself thinking Draco and Hermione would get along.
Harry, feeling incredibly nervous, walked through the door and descended down the grimly lit staircase into the waiting area of the court room.
They went up to the common room after getting the password from the Head Boy, and, feeling very full and tired, they all went up to their dormitories and got dressed for bed.
For all his thinking Harry arrived at the potions room with crescent moon shaped indents in his palm from his nails, and a sufficiently destroyed mood. He watched the potion for a bit and looked over the instructions in his book, adding a little bit of the next ingredient and giving it a couple stirs, and was about to head out when none other then Draco bloody Malfoy swaggered into the room looking perfect as ever.
"What is this place?" Harry asked. Almost immediately the smile dropped of of Ron's face and Hermione looked down guiltily.
"Well, well, we'll, Potter. Back for another year? I'd think you'd have thought twice after last years events. Poor little Potter facing the big bad Dark Lord." Malfoy taunted.
"This can't be bloody happening".
They ate like pigs and Harry didn't understand how they do it, especially now that he wasn't really eating. It's not like he meant to stop eating, he just kept forgetting about it. And he wasn't very hungry anymore anyways so he supposed it didn't make too much of a difference.
Harry was frozen in disbelief, because standing in front of him was his former Defense Against The Arts teacher. Remus Lupin was standing in front of him with a small smile.
He went through his usual routine; get up, shower, get dressed, get breakfast even though he was never hungry anymore, and then go to class.
Draco grabs his arm. "No, tell me what the fuck just happened, I come in here and find you calmly staring at a bleeding wound so I think I deserve an explanation"
"This is our schedule. I would urge you to stick to it Potter I would prefer not to get a failing grade"  he sneered. Harry just nodded and turn to place the paper in his bag. He wasn't sure he trusted himself to speak at the moment.
As he walked down to the dungeons with Ron and Hermione he braced himself for the inevitable mini heart attack he would have when he walked into the room. He took a deep breath and walked through the door, only to find that his infuriating infatuation was not there. Harry immediately felt uneasy, Draco never missed a Potions class. As he sat down with Ron at their usual table he glanced over and asked
Harry didn't ask anymore and eventually found himself out on the Dursley's back lawn, pushing off into the night sky on his firebolt.
After that everything went downhill. He was constantly worrying, writing letters to Sirius and Remus day and night and needing to know they were alive and well and what was going on with Dumbledore and having to word it just right so that Umbridge couldn't identify anything from reading his letters. He couldn't focus in class, the DA took up too much of his time, his sanity was cracked, and his grades were falling rapidly, which is how he found himself in the library at 7pm on a Saturday night with a pile of books and parchment in front of him, preparing to tackle his giant mountain of homework.
"No one did it. I could have stopped it anytime I wanted Draco I'm not incompetent"
"well. Since your here and it looks good I'll just go back to my dorms now"
They broke into a run as they got close and Harry closed his eyes. When he opens them again they are on Platform 9 3/4. He looks around with nostalgia remembering all the things that have happened over the years trying to make himself feel what he should be feeling, but he still felt sad and empty. Once again though he places a fake smile on his face and loads his trunk onto the train. After a lot of pushing and pulling and lifting, everyone's things are on the train. They get off again to say goodbye to Mr and Ms Weasley and to Sirius who they all give loving pats on the head to. Ms Weasley gives all her children big, bone crushing hugs and Hermione blushes when she's pulled in as well. Harry just merely smiles as he's used to Ms Weasley compassion for them, though he is a bit embarrassed when he realizes she has tears in her eyes after pulling away from them.
"Hey Potter didn't expect to see you here. Would have thought you'd be off with Dumbly raving about your lunatic theories"  he smirked "or did he ask you to spread your little rumours about The Dark Lord"
At that almost everyone started laughing and Harry sat down. The rest of the dinner was very comfortable with people congratulating him and cracking jokes and the like. Harry thought that it was amazing that everyone was just so, accepting! In the muggle world people weren't near as accepting as they were, None the less he loved all of them there for accepting him as he is.
It had been a Friday when he was assigned to work with Draco and so he'd had all weekend to feel sorry for himself and dwell moodily over the boy who had captured his heart as well as his dreams apparently. He'd had a new one appear over the weekend that consisted of them working together in the potions room and Draco touching him inappropriately under the desk as Harry struggled to keep a straight face.
After Hermione's ridiculous request that Harry had stupidly agreed to, he spent most of his free time making lesson plans which to he found actually helped distract him quite nicely. Of course he still cut every now and then but he had slowed down considerably.
Harry rolled his eyes. "There were dementors!!" He said loudly.
"blimey mate is that all? That's great!"
"Hello and thank you for contacting the Ministry Of Magics visitors office how may I help you" Harry could hear the phone saying.
Hermione must have caught the look crossing Harry's face because she quickly said "We're sorry we didn't tell you about it. Dumbledore forbid us to say anything in case someone intercept something"
Draco smiled at him and waved his wand, revealing a blanket obviously taken from the slytherin dorms, some food, and a telescope "I thought we could have a nice night somewhere other then the library"
Harry looked at the slip and saw four words written there.
Then he heard Aunt Petunia calling him.
Harry was feeling pretty proud of himself for that while looking at Dracos shocked face...until he was suddenly being slammed against the wall by the older blonde, That shook his confidence pretty quickly.
"Hello Professor Moody."
And then she found the DA. Cho Chang's friend Marietta had blabbered about it and Umbridges infernal Inquisitorial Squad  had triumphed the Room Of Requirement, but luckily they'd gotten everyone out safely. After that ridiculous stunt they had decided not to hold anymore meetings for a while just to be safe which made Harry restless and antsy for something to distract himself lest he spiral. However soon enough he did.
“So?” Hermione looked at him hopefully. “Will you do it?”
Ms Weasley was downstairs making breakfast and snacks for the train, Mr Weasley was reading the paper, Sirius was laughing with Fred and George, Tonks was making faces at Ginny causing her to snort into her pudding, Hermione had her nose in a book while petting Crookshanks, and Ron was pacing quickly most likely nervous to be a prefect.
They got out and went over to security. After a good deal of waiting in line the security officer inspected Harry's wand and deemed him fit to enter. They crossed the room to the Golden lifts and got in. Mr Weasley started talking to a large man and Harry decided he didn't want to listen, though he wished he had when Mr Weasley turned around looking pale and shocked.
Harry quite honestly couldn't quite believe his luck.
"It seems that your court hearing has been moved up a bit. We only have 5 minutes to get there." Mr Weasley said nervously.
They both stared at eachother and Draco mutters "fuck it" before leaning in again to kiss Harry, gentler this time. When they broke apart Harry swallows and whispers* I feel the same way about you Draco.
He gathered his stuff and sent and sat himself down next to his sworn enemy and now crush feeling the blush creeping up his neck as he remembered his dream from the other night. Draco just scowled at him. Harry put his hands up in a
"It's nothing Hermione it's just Umbridge's dumb form of punishment." He shrugged it off but the stubborn girl would not be swayed. She held out her hand expectantly while staring him down. Honestly she scared him sometimes and he recognized the glint in her eyes well enough that he knew that if he didn't comply he'd be in some serious trouble, so he sighed and gave in placing his hand gingerly in hers.
Hermione ended up going back to her room around two and him and Ron fell asleep not long after, tired out after the exciting events of the day.
He woke up every day either numb, or heavy with indescribable sadness. His feelings bottled up inside with no way to escape him and honestly it made his skin itch and feel too tight. He was drowning in himself but he couldn't let anyone know. He was the Chosen One. He wasn't supposed to feel weighed down or upset or scared because he could take down Voldemort! But Harry didn't feel that way at all.
He sat in his bed for what felt like hours and hours until the sun came up and he heard the Dursley's starting to move, which meant he had to start going as well.
Over the course of a lifetime Harry would find out the answer to that question, but for now he was contented to lay with Draco underneath the stars in the highest tower in Hogwarts for a night of peace and quiet that, unknowingly to Harry, would be broken quite soon, in an irreparable way.
Draco was packed and ready to leave before Harry so he surreptitiously watched him glide out of the room sighing a bit as he remembered the dreams he'd had about them. He forced himself to choke down his blush and got up to go to his dorm for a quick break before dinner.
Harry spun around so quickly he hurt his neck but he didn't care.
"What was tha-" "what the fu-"
The trial went on and on, he spoke, Dumbledore spoke, Fudge spoke amongst his little minions up there, and even Miss Figg came and spoke! Harry still couldn't believe she was a squib.
"What the fuck Potter?!"
Harry and Draco weren't exactly close, sure they're conversations had gotten less murderous in private throughout the length of the project, but nothing that would explain the level of concern and slight fear shining through Draco's usually well placed mask and he just stares in shock "what do you care Malfoy?"
Harry is mad that his friends didn’t tell him about The Order. Harry is mad he can’t join the order. Harry is just mad in general
"Well sir me and my cousin, Dudley, we're walking down the street and all of a sudden it just got cold. And everything went dark. And Dudley was freaking out. I saw dementors and what they did to people last year at Hogwarts so I knew it was a dementor when I started feeling sad and like nothing would ever make me happy ever again. It was awful. Professor Lupin had taught me the Patronus Charm last year and a dementor had grabbed Dudley and was about to kiss him so you see I had no choice but to use the Patronus Charm sir."
"Unfortunately I can't Harry. I've got work and you'll be fine now go on there." Mr Weasley patted Harry's shoulder.
she turned to Hedwig's cage and tried a quick "
In these dreams his mind let go and showed him the impossibility of
Malfoy chuckled. "Scared Potter?" He sneered.
They were all going to make an Everlasting Elixir and each would take about a fortnight to make. They would have to schedule checking the potions between class time and when to put in ingredients etc. At the end of the lesson Draco slid a piece of paper towards him with times and names and when to add ingredients written on it in his neat scrawl.
Draco undoubted had more to say but he was cut off because in a fit of self confidence Harry had shot forward and kissed Draco Malfoy dead on the mouth, and to his surprise, Draco reciprocated. Their mouths moving against one another in tandem. They spent what could have been second or hours like that, Draco pushing Harry back against the bookcase and kissing him senseless and eventually breaking apart for air, both of them looking dazed before they jumped apart from one another, both going to speak at the same time.
"All in favour of letting the accused go and clearing him of all charges" everyone else's hands went up.
Hermione bugs Harry for an obnoxiously long amount of time about leading the DA
"Go on then dear," Ms Weasley said in a soothing tone. "I'm sure whatever it is will be alright"
"Well boy it wasn't me who was teachin' ya now was it. It was that grimy Barry Crouch" Moody grumbled.
Soon enough Harry and Draco's potion project is finished and handed in so Harry expects that to be the last he hears of Draco so close to him, but then why was he finding him everywhere? In the library, courtyard, honey dukes, Draco was always there. It was driving Harry insane.
"How long has this been happening" He said in a low voice.
Then Harry heard a calm voice behind him say: "Witness for the defence, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore"
"Take this and memorize it quickly" he said shoving the paper into his hand roughly.
"What do I do now?"  He asked, a bit confused.
All the boys fell asleep pretty quickly except for Harry who, for the life of him, could not get Malfoy out of his bloody head. He thought he would surely go insane if he thought about him any moment longer so, once he assured himself that all the boys were asleep, he crept out of bed and into the bathroom.
"Harry get down here and start on breakfast!!"
Hermione started a bit at that and started muttering to herself eyes wide, but before he could ask what was wrong the first years arrived.
"THE WHOLE SUMMER?!" Harry thundered. "HOW COULD YOU NOT TELL ME SOMETHING THIS BIG ALL SUMMER!!!!"
The next morning Harry woke up to the smell of bacon and the sound of Ron moving around the room.
The first meeting came and went with the suggestion of the name, Dumbledore's Army, and methods of contact, charmed galleons that would get hot when a message was sent through them, and the place, the room of requirement. Harry was distracted by all the planning and by Umbridge's infernal behaviour which consequently, caused him to miss his check in day on the potion which Draco berated him about before class, yelling at him to make sure he got there next time or he'd regret it, Harry heard him mutter to Pansy Parkinson that he "wasn't going to lose a grade to an uppity git like Potter." Harry just sighed and put it in his mental to do list.
Harry gasped. "It's Umbridge!"
Harry finally came to his senses. “Nope. Nope nope nopety nope nope” Harry said immediately getting up. “I will not run this group.” He said as he walked out of The Three Broomsticks, Ron and Hermione following close behind.
But he couldn't get the memory of how it felt out of his head. Later that night he laid in bed and replayed it over and over, fingering the cut absentmindedly.
They flew for hours and hours Moody directing them in complicated patterns and doubling back until everyone was frozen to their brooms. Harry enjoyed every second, though he wished he had brought a jacket.
Soon enough they were at the school sitting down at their House Tables getting ready to see The Sorting. While they were waiting though Harry happened to glance up at the staff table and noticed a short, stout, vaguely toad like woman wearing all pink.
"Harry where were you! We've been waiting we were worried sick when you weren't back before curfew and Ron said he saw you rush out again right after coming back and-"
He had all his supplies as Ms Weasley had gone out and bought it for him while he was at the ministry for the trial. They had also discovered a few days earlier that Hermione and, surprisingly, Ron, had been made prefects. When Ms Weasley had found out she'd just about thrown a fit in here happiness, and Ron has gotten a shiny new broom for it.
"C'mon mate! Mums made bacon and eggs!" Ron said sounding as delighted as can be. Harry swears he can eat more then Hagrid sometimes.
He stumbled a bit but regained his balance as Hermione called "Harry! Ron, Ron Harry's here! He's here!"
His hand went up and so did the toad like lady's. He made note of this and sighed in defeat.
By the time Umbridge let him go it was half an hour passed curfew and his hand was worse then ever. First he ran to the nearest bathroom to run it under cold water for 5 minutes to try and help with the burning, and then he wound his way through the halls trying not to get caught by Filch. The nasty caretaker almost caught him once but he managed to hide behind a tapestry.
Sirius looked at Harry very seriously and said
As he stepped into the classroom he was pretty sure his heart had stopped for a solid minute because in all of Merlin somehow Draco had gotten even more handsome. He already felt a tad warm as soon as he saw the glorious boy, but when Snape announced that they would be sitting with their partners for the majority of the project Harry's temperature sky rocketed.
They walked into the station, Sirius trotting along behind them in his dog form, and geared up to run into the platform. They went in pairs, Fred and George first, then Mr Weasley and Sirius, Then Ms Weasley and Ginny, and finally Harry and Ron.
"Your not old enough to apparate and the Flo can be traced. We don't need anyone knowing where we are Harry" Remus explained softly.
Harry calmed a bit. He'd get to know things. Sirius always knew what to do.
At that point Ron was standing over his shoulder glaring down at the words "I'm gonna kill her"  he said.
He sprinted down to the DADA office and burst in panting a quick "sorry I'm late sorry I forgot".  Umbridge sent him a stern look and said "you'll get detention next week as well Mr Potter"  he just nodded and sat down in his seat, picking up the quill with trepidation, and starting to write his lines. The now familiar, but still painful prick of the words on his hand started and soon enough the scars on his left hand reading "I must not tell lies" were reopened and oozing blood.
The young witch with purple hair followed him up to help and he found out her name was Tonks, or at least that's what she liked to be called.
"This way Mr Potter" the man said calmly.
Harry shook his head and scolded himself for even thinking that. To distract himself until Malfoy went away, he turned away and dug his nails into his palm under his cloak.
It was a large room in pastel blue and dark woods. One side had ceiling high windows, giving a perfect view of the mountains and two seat tables with linen cloth underneath. There was a small buffet table with drinks, sauces and spare tableware. In the middle of the room were larger tables that could seat easily twelve persons. Floating candles were almost touching the ceiling, while water pitchers and clear glasses just hovered above head height. Each table had elaborate centerpieces of plants and flowers that hid miniature dragons within their leaves. The small dragons seemed very much alive; some slept, others flew around blowing little smoke curls from their noses and others ate or played-fight with each other. They seemed trapped in an invisible globe, never straying far from the centerpiece they belonged to. The tables were decked out with empty golden plates, menu cards and little salt and pepper sets.
"I grow them until a day comes that they do ask for it," Charlie said as if that was obvious. He then made a come along motion. "One more bounce around the sight before we go? It'll get dark soon."
Most Aurors had cleared the floor by now. Petrified people were dragged into a line. They worked fast and one of them came up to Harry. The man, large and broad zoned in on him, the glint in brown eyes shining determined.
Draco pinched the bridge of his nose. He was caught at a crossroad and didn't know which way to go. He was always so sure of himself. For someone who was always so sure of his choices and always knew what to do, even if the problem hadn't arisen yet, the current situation was a pinch to the gut. Prepared, he liked to be prepared and now, he was completely out of his dept.
"Bernadette, dearie," She corrected him with a smile. "You're very welcome!"
"Well, yes, I promised lots of pictures and letters to home," Harry admitted. "I plan on doing exactly that."
"Well," Andromeda started, drinking the final bit of her tea. "You two better learn to get along quick then because, if he cannot go home, he's bound to stay here and if he is staying here," She stood up and levitated your cup to the sink. "You get to share the attic. Goodnight."
He felt haunted by the people and mostly, by his own mind. The nightmares and alike shredding him piece by piece. He left the wizarding world slightly beside himself, with a mind in shambles and slightly suicidal.
"Don't bother," Draco grinned. "I shall have it wrapped and call it a day on finding you a suitable present."
"I have bought myself the same set I gifted you." Harry said. "We'll have to try in the muggle world though. The components fry when used around too much magic."
Harry watched him go. He thought about going back to sleep but he felt too awake already. He sat up, ran a hand through his hair and yawned. Then he looked around and wondered. "Now what?"
"Are you serious?" Charlie asked but he still has a smile on his face and Harry returned it.
The blonde resolutely snarled. "Wack Harry for me."
"So.. I'm out?" Harry asked defeated. The man had already explained the difficulty of the matter in length but he had a hard time believing it. He just wanted to be an Auror, had been told he would have been a great one, he would have loved it, he knew. Yet, in one swift blow, the one wish he had was gone.
The blond had his eyes closed and to Hermione they looked oddly slumped together. Sagged bonelessly.
Harry explained about the potion bottle circle he'd found in the front garden. "It looks about the same, not as neat though."
"You're just addicted." Harry shook his head. "It's fine the way it is."
"Ready to fly?" Charlie asked, the biggest smile on his face and Harry nodded enthusiastically, returning the smile with an equally bright one.
Harry loved the garden, neat but wild and as he strolled through he enjoyed following the small animals about. He enjoyed it and childishly happy when a swarm of blue butterflies surrounded him. The slowly moved away and he followed, giggles escaping him whenever a Butterfly touched him.
"No you can't and next time, when I ask you to wait, you wait. Okay?" It sounded as a statement, like there would be a next time. Harry huffed and folded his arms over each other while he stood in front of the blonde boy, locking his eyes on him and taking every detail to him. He saw and heard the anger but sadness was flooding trough, Draco couldn't hide it well enough.
"Thank you." Charlie said shy and promptly gave Harry a hug, a clap on the back and swiftly turned on his heels, to skip inside. He whistled a tune and when Harry didn't follow immediately he called him. "Ready to go?"
"That's more then I thought you boys could accomplish, in all actuality."
The shop roofs had been covered in snow during the night and the shop owners took great detail in their shop fronts, each decked out with colourful lights, baubles and full of christmas scenery. Decorated garlands strung from one building to another, criss-crossing above the street. Some shop owners had put up Christmas trees by their entrance, making people walk around them, never going straight. The first street vendors were unpacking, their merchandise all winter themed. Harry saw a small child building a snowman in the far distance. The parents, he assumed, sat on the small bench by the Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour sipping from mugs with hot liquid. He loved it.
"Me?" The black haired wizard scanned the pages, noting the counter-spells weren't the easiest ones.
"No, not really, it's interesting because once in school I learned that at that space in the ocean a lot of ships disappeared and they, including the people on it were to never be seen again."
Harry gasped for breath when he shot up. Draco said nothing, and neither did Harry. Several minutes passed but Harry remained white in the face. He wasn't looking too good, Draco noted and the blond didn't stop the snort that came when Harry finally broke the silence when he wryly welcomed the blond into his house. They didn't speak at all after that. They sat there, each taken by their own thoughts.
"Dressing styles?" Harry asked as he moved to topple the book onto the stack Draco pointed at. The blonde nodded. "Clothing. Fashion through the ages. It's a serie."
"Can I mail it here?" Harry asked the stocky man behind the counter.
"I suppose that fair enough as this is my fault." Harry answered hoping Draco would give in a bit and help but the other just shook his head and continued reading after canceling the magic on the loose pages, waving him off. "It is your fault and it suits well enough that you fix it, besides," He looked up and eyed the other. "I'm upset with you for not listening and I have to pee."
Draco grumbled a bit about it but shrugged it of.
"I knew the Sanctuary saved dragons but I didn't know this was the cause nor that it is so bad." Harry muttered.
"You just gave me a job," Harry said bewondered. "I'm here on vacation."
Harry shrugged. "I guess so, then." Harry answered. He wound the wire expertly around his finger and held the needle close at its point and settled it down. "Here it goes." He pierced the skin and settled the first stitch, Draco just hissed, but knew not to move.
"Like you know that many!"
"Stop!" He screamed and gathered split second attention for the second time. Never lowering his voice, he kept on screaming. "I asked what the bleeding hell is going on!"
She held the door open for Harry. He had seen the study before. A large desk against the wall which fitted between the other two walls exactly, a bookshelf above and two large bookshelves shoved against either wall had their sides tapping the desk. Next to the door stood an old, frilly pink crib filled with little keepsakes of Nymphadora; Toys and books she had once called her favourites through various ages, her Hogwarts letter, report cards and her Auror diploma. Underneath the crib were standing two boxes. One obviously held stack upon stack of photo's and the other was labelled Remus Lupin.
"Sometimes." Draco said. They talked for a while, convincing Andromeda it wasn't that big of a deal until Draco picked up his forgotten present from the floor. He was about to tear the paper off when Andromeda stopped him.
"I'm not," Harry yawned, not wearing a coat yet but he laughed and pointed at Teddy. "Captain One-eye is though."
And now, he stumbled into her place after being chased by the pest. There, he saw Draco Malfoy. He caught the blonde in the act he had edged him onto doing so often and he smiled. The former junior Death Eater looked lovely in Harrys' opinion.
"Let's go check if they cleaned it?" Harry asked by lack of anything better to say now his main idea was foiled. Charlie agreed. They got onto the broom again, Harry flying this time as he remembered exactly where it was. Even in the dark, Harry flew straight to it, and to his surprise, it was still there.
They nodded at him and Harry whispered to Draco. "I can't wait to bleeding leave Britain."
Draco blinked once, twice and pulled all his energy together to sit up - cupping Harry's chin and forcing them to look straight at each other. "No." He answered and pressed forward, making their lips meet in a soft kiss. A kiss he didn't need, his high prevented such feelings – any feelings, but knew it was one that the other asked for without saying it. A kiss desperately wanted.
To Harry's surprise, the last option he explained sounded the coolest but very expensive and time consuming. It was like an private taxi in the sky, flying carpets to be exact, which connect Ministries around the world. They mostly are used to transport delicate items, those that can neither be floo-ed or port-keyed but any civilian can buy themselves in on the ride.
Charlie quickly pointed, naming the main items and slowly muttered, "Don't try to feed or water anything except yourself and, well, you may feed me of course. Though, do return books to their proper place and stay out of my bedroom.. Unless.." He lilted the last word and laughed. "Joke, joke."
"Obviously." Harry laughed.
"It is, most countries don't have any Dragons free roaming left, we luckily were able to bring in the few left in assorted countries after a plea with their Ministry to pretty please not kill them but have us take them instead.
"I believe that is a correct assumption." She agreed and went over to make tea for the both of them.
Draco closed the door. The weather had changed massively since he spied outside. A storm brewed. Car alarms rang loud, a scooter beeped and the wind blew dust and garbage around. The first drops of rain splattered. Big drops. He watched Ron and Ginny walk away, pulling their hoods up with some trouble as their robes danced on the heavy wind.
The fountain became a whole other matter. Someone had charmed the sprouts from the water to shine lights, foil garland was wrapped around the statue and dozens of baubles floated about, each rotating on their own circle, putting up a brilliant show. Andromeda waited patiently when Harry and Teddy both gaped, following the baubles and walking around the fountain several times. She laughed when se saw Teddy reach out for them and Harry holding himself back as to not copy the little one, the baubles didn't feel like being touched and when hands came to close, the floated out of the way. Draco however, didn't have much patience and told Harry in no uncertain terms that he could waste his time there later on but to get a move on for now.
Harry was taken aback by that, and the discomfort was clear. Silas dispelled it however, when he walked up to his twin and slapped the back of his head without a word. He turned to Harry apologetic. "Sorry, don't mind him," He jabbed a thumb over his shoulder towards Solomon. "He had a rough tour this morning."
Harry shook his head and sat down next to Andromeda where the witch was curled up on the couch, enjoying a glass of fine wine and listening to the Wizard Wireless. "They think. I don't want to be their friend anymore." Harry sighed as he let himself fall against her side and rested his head on her shoulder. "They can't. They don't want to understand why I didn't come back to Hogwarts and now they think I don't want to be friends anymore and I don't know what to do."
Draco waited no longer and started running again and Harry almost reached his floor of destination, but Draco could almost keep up with him. Harry was annoyed about the fact that he got traced again, so he speed up and ran down the hall as fast as he could. Just before Draco spotted Harry, he disappeared behind the portrait of The Fat Lady, leaving Draco behind. All that Draco saw was a huge portrait closing, knowing that it was Harry that went through.
"How big is the magical world?"
Harry smiled. He hadn't had the chance to answer because the little whoop of happiness beat him to speaking.
"Hey, it's just and oversight." Harry said but kept hush when he saw how overworked Draco became all of a sudden.
"Apologies but no, I'm afraid I will be pushing Teddy, the street are slippery and rather uneven."
"As if. I can multitask." Draco said and Harry groaned but grabbed a white coat from the back of the door and washed his hands. He sat sown on the chair, pulled the cart close and set to the tedious job of cutting of pieces and sticking them through needles. Draco stopped him after the first five minutes and ordered him to do it by magic. It was easier and faster, but Harry wasn't entirely happy. If it had been his choice, he had broken and thrown away the pieces a long time ago. It was Draco who made him keep the wand and use it whenever he came down so, as to his words, Harry would keep in touch with his magic, just in case he might need to rely on it in the future.
"I bet you'll love what they've done to the fountain then," Draco said, Andromeda still smiling fondly at them as she agreed with him. "Shall we go see?"
Harry looked over, Solomon was laying on the couch, mostly covered by a cloak again. Only the shock of white hair was visible.
He walks through the halls of Hogwarts as a zombie. Dragging forth his body even if it protests, screams at him for a moment of peace but he can't sit, can't relax. He must walk, can't stay in one place. He must move - go somewhere, anywhere in the hope to shake the feeling of being hunted. Alas, he isn't hunted. Not anymore. No, he's haunted. Haunted by his own ghosts of evil and guilt. It's damnation.
"So, about your colleague, is he fine?" Harry asked with interest.
She saw the potion bottle that must have slipped out of Harry's hand, it still balancing between three points; Draco's body, the other's hand nestled there and the wall.
"Bernadette, dear, you may call me Bernadette."
Harry nodded and stretched. "Yeah, I could do with an early bedtime today, I have to get up early."
"I can't believe it." Harry shook his head as he got off the broom and bent down. He inspected the circle, as far as he could see by the Lumos of his wand, the potions had spread. It went from just a small circle to an uneven patch, a few steps all around of dead land. No more critters or creepy crawlers and no more plants. "I thought Mrs. Dell'elion would do something!"
"Well, rumor has it they aren't one hundred percent human," Charlie shrugged. "Eitherway, they're good people, they're just a close knit family and a bit out of the ordinary. Although I second Solomon is a lot to handle when you first meet him."
"Why not?"
Two car doors slammed shut, one followed by the other and quickly after that, the blond stomped into the house without as much of a word to her as he pushed past, dropped op the couch and covered himself with a blanket. He did so from toe to head, leaving nothing but a tuft of blond hair visible. Obviously he wasn't going to talk with anyone.
The door of the shop was pushed open, the small bell above it ringing, alerting the black haired man a potential customer had come in.
Right beneath his feet was a circle of potion vials, corks unscrewed and dripping onto the ground. The grass was sizzling and most of the insects close gave it a wide berth. He found it odd. He wondered if it was supposed to be there, it seemed so out of place. At first, he reached out but knowing how dangerous a move that could be, he resolutely turned around. He better ask Mrs. Dell'elion.
The other just gave a glare and dipped into the pensieve.
"Come Teddy bear," Andromeda kissed his cheek and set him on the floor. "You'll be a good boy now and play with your toys."
"You should be at Hogwarts, young man, what are you doing here?" She waved her hand around.
"I can, sort of, almost." Harry answered and rubbed his eyes before he pointed at the title.
"Poor word choice," Draco said. Pure hatred and loathing was raised in one fell swoop with the one simple word of the redhead. "May I remind you, you're on the clock. Please be respectful, I haven't insulted either of you. Although," He grinned and couldn't resist a well placed jab. "Do these red Auror robes clash horribly with your hair, piss poor choice, I'll tell you."
"That's it?" Harry said confused. He sort of hoped there would be immediate action taken. Who knew what those bottles held, and what it did. He felt uneasy leaving it as it was until the morning. In all honesty, Harry felt some anger rise. He never liked the hands-off attitude of not in my garden, not my problem, find someone else to bother style.
The blonde hopped of the desk. "Why, thank you, kind Sir." Draco replied, his tone perfectly on par with Harry's jab. Harry shook his head, a smile still present as he followed Draco into the room.
This morning in the kitchen, Draco told he had found the library locked again and Harry couldn't even remember it had opened up at all. Draco scolded and waved his wand, levitating their pensieve onto the table.
Andromeda was seated on the couch, little Teddy playing with his toys by her feet when Harry came in. She immediately noticed the small smile on his face and praised herself on a job well done. She knew, way before Harry had even come to her, that the black haired wizard shouldn't go back to Hogwarts. She had known he needed a while to just be free and when he had knocked on her door, she happily provided him with the means to do just that. Harry had taken to it big time and considering he was now in her kitchen, laying out stacks of books to learn what he needed to do what she suggested, she counted herself one lucky woman.
"W-why are you bothering with the door when you can use the window?" Draco raised his eyebrow and folded his arms. "How illogic are you?"
Harry followed her and they sat down. Harry liked the small seating arrangement, he hadn't noticed it before as it stood off to the side. The walls were soft yellow, the simple chairs were bold yellow. It matched with the large light blue pot that had painted golden rings spiralling up with a light green plant. It had huge leafs, and between the chairs was a low table with some pamphlets regarding the tours and lectures given in the building. Harry had almost forgotten about it, and made a mental note he really should check that, and the exhibition out sooner than later.
"Same reasons as you just gave. You really want to go to Russia in the middle of winter? I mean, It'll be pretty but also cold as heck and I don't think you and I are equipped enough to dare snow roads."
"So you came here."
"Back then, we still had a lot of space and could move fairly free but around the 1900's rolled around, the magical community was pushed into corners and space became limited. The further muggles progress, the less freedom there is for us," He tapped Harry's camera. "Muggles got them, right now they're trying to implement them on little handheld phones. Every muggle will carry a camera and in the future the quality will only get better and wildly used. It'll hard to hide when an obliviate wont take the evidence away."
"And this?" He took the thing Harry took from the box. "What's this?"
"We will come back with a warrant, probably ransack the place and arrest the owner." Ginny said, surprising Draco by answering truthfully.
The twins had sent him some fireworks.
Draco Malfoy sat on the navy blue couch across from Harry. He twiddled with the wand he wasn't supposed to own between his fingers. He briefly glanced down, seeing the red spot that marked his ban on magic on his wrist. He sighed, and twirled the wand again. Time ticked by, the storm kept brewing outside. Draco occasionally checked the time on the small clock above the hearth.
"I made it! They took my picture and all so in a few days I can pick up the license."
(See the end of the chapter for
He motioned for Harry to look into the first enclosure and the sight definitely something to behold. It looked as if someone had cramped the entire forbidden forest into the small space only here, a small yellow and green egg with a tree pattern was snuggled deep within glowing coal, keeping it warm and toasty.
Draco moved to the corner where the mirrors were handing so he could see his back. He ordered Harry around, having him hold the wires at different patches of his back until he was fairly sure which colour he wanted where. Talking all the while, Harry now knew what the other wanted, down to the details. Even though done, Harry was still staring at it for a while, his finger tracing a simple blue flower on the left shoulder. The stiches there weren't quite even, the leaves all slightly different in size and the stitched crosses following the outer line were uneven. Still, tracing it fondly, he was certainly proud of that particular piece. It being the very first, as Draco had signed up to be his guinea pig at the time.
"And you have one?" From his voice, it was undeniable that he was bewondered, totally intrigued.
"Sit." Andromeda said as she put two mugs of tea on the table and sat down. Harry scooted in the seat beside her and curled his fingers around the steamy cup.
As it was, Draco held a lot of knowledge on the topic. It turned out, they could shrink and apparate with their vehicles if done by coordinates but neither of them had any experience. Draco was quick to say how tricky it was, how easy they could splinch and that he really rather not try such a way of transportation.
Kreacher still didn't move but Harry straightened himself out, being smart enough to give his wand to the house elf realizing his mistake. "That was stupid, I know.. I get it. Sorry about that."
"She definitely has a gift for ear pulling," Harry answered and smiled as he spotted Teddy slurping up some red-ish goo who, in turn, smiled and gurgled his hello as he spotted Harry. Then, Teddy waved happily still holding his spoon and thus splattering the goo all ways. He smiled toothily again, as he noticed the effect of spoon waving and did it again. Harry walked up, kissed the tiny man on top of his head and sat down. "So what did you do to deserve it?"
"I said it. I really like your house. Its very light and homey." Harry had a smile reaching from ear to ear as he now knew most of Charlie's excitement came from getting to show of the place he lived in and hoping for a positive review.
The reporters could not follow. The tell tale sign of Aurors coming down by the whistle they blew to control large crowds prevented them for doing so and Harry let out a deep breath in relief. He, thoroughly dishevelled, ran his hands over his face. He mourned his lost glasses for a second and spun around to thank his saviour.
"Such hostility, Ronald." Draco tutted.
"What are you doing?" He asked and got on the ground, noticing one of the piles held the Bermuda triangle island.
Harry had to suppress a laugh, because there was nothing to laugh about except at how seamlessly Charlie fell into teacher mode and added facts that while on topic got nothing to do with the story on hand. "Yea, the witch hunts and all that, Binns taught it."
Andromeda didn't elaborate even though she saw their confused looks. She waved them to continue. Harry searched his small pile and sat next to Draco. "Let's see what she got us."
He questioned Harry about it. It seemed so specific and Harry shrugged. "I want to see Spain and Italy when its sunny and I think January is hardly the time to lay on a beach or go endless sightseeing."
Harry nodded. "Oh, so locals."
The wireless was softly playing Christmas songs, Teddy gurgled along, very clearly not on the beat but swayed happily from his spot on the couch. He had a present in his hand but opted to just turn and shake it instead of making any attempt to get the wrapping paper off.
Harry closed the door. "Choose your poison." Harry said and waved his hands about. Draco moved to the wall, small bits of wire were on display, the strands carefully lined and the light above put them in a good sight, their colour combinations splashing off the white wall.
"Fine!" Harry braced himself, slighty ashamed he looked the other straight in the eye. "I might have used magic on your damn books!"
Draco glanced over his wand. Magic was a pleasure, until it was against you. Especially when it came down to laws. He'd experienced that once before and it wasn't something he would've wanted to repeat. It was a complete pain in the arse. He stared at Harry, still unmoving. The longer he stared and saw no difference the more he felt anger creep in. If only Harry had left him, he would've stayed out of trouble. But Harry hadn't and so he was.
Despite the cold weather, Harry and Draco spend over an hour seated at an table in front of a small cafe, going over details. The cafe placed warming charms on the chairs but it stayed cold and the hot chocolate was welcoming, as was the refill.
"Tea?" Bernadette asked. Harry refused. He tapped one of the leaves on the plant, the few dust particles on it flew up and Harry watched them dance in the sunlight. He asked her to continue.
"At the corner shop, dear." She said and looked at him with a small smile. "My husband started to provide the service when the shop in town closed."
"Strawberry gashes." Harry said again and Draco sat up with difficulty so he could nod his agreement. Now that he sat up, he overlooked Harry and his eyes found the knife. He took it and pulled at Harrys' clothes until he had the bare shoulder in sight. Draco nicked the skin. Carefully he caught a bead of blood with the tip of his finger as it made its way out and held it up for Harry too see. "Strawberry gashes." He grinned and licked his finger clean, he slumped back down again, finding his spot against Harrys' side without difficulty and gave the knife back at him.
"So what, a practice run?"
Harry mentally added a maybe as he watched the blonde produce his wand from out his back pocket and dropped it into his lap. "When you're done, there's dinner in the fridge for you."
The blonde nodded and snapped at the other: "Yes wonder boy, that's the one," already stretching an arm out to take the book. "Give it here."
Harry got up, quick to understand now would be the best time knowing he wouldn't drop while fighting with Draco, having the medicine still running thick though him. And when he stood next to Draco, he had the cheek to ruffle the blonde hair. "It's cute, really, how bad your hair can look." And with that, Harry made a run, knowing the blonde wouldn't react all too well on that.
Harry sighed again as he watched Draco walk away. Half his mind wanted to throw the spoon at the blonde but he knew it would only lead to more problems and settled for throwing it into the kitchen; which wasn't one of his brightest ideas. He missed hitting Kreacher by mere centimetres and instead it smashed into their porcelain cabinet. A loud crash of ceramic clatter and Kreacher let out a hysteric screech.
"Lucky you," Harry said when he watched Charlie tap the plate with his wand to place his order. Harry glanced at the menu, spotted a dish from which the description sounded like a meatloaf of sorts and chose to order that. With their food on the way, Charlie explaining it may take a minute or ten, Harry leaned forward and said softly, as to not be overheard. "What's the deal with them?"
"I assume we can. We cannot scare the child by having his uncle and godfather having a go at each other, now can we?"
The Auror turned to the two still flanking Draco and saw the hall was cleared. "Stand down and escort them on whatever business they have here until they leave." He turned back at Harry. "And you two aren't very smart yourself appearing in the Atrium like that. The Prophet has been reporting on the riots here for weeks now. Don't either of you follow the news?"
"Alrighty then," Charlie threw an arm around Harry, smiling even wider as he bumped their heads together. "Do make me look good!"
"We can go to some stores together, but I doubt you want to come with me when I go on a clothing hunt."
Draco mulled it over, and in the end curiosity won out. Curiosity killed the cat. He knew that of all options, this was the worst. Yet, he knew that, without a doubt, Harry was going to stick his neck out for him if he couldn't manage to save himself. It would go against everything Harry stood for to let anyone else take the fall for something he'd caused. With that, Draco took his wand and cast a rennervate at the still form of his friend.
"You want to go there?" Draco asked, looking down at Harry who shook his head.
Charlie poked his head through the door opening. "Are you crazy? Course not. We finally reached the point where I can start showing you the important stuff," He spoke slow, exaggerating his next two words. "Like, dragons.."
"It says, well," Harry slipped his fingers along the lines and slowly read out loud, skipping some parts to summary it." Bermuda Triangle Island, large, sunny, last known population about five hundred, almost fully self-sufficient with a handful of import wizards to take care of the rest. Lots of farms, small city centre and apparently they turned a wrecked cruise ship at the only dock into a huge casino."
So, how does it work?"
"I do, but seeing it firsthand is something new!" Harry said. Charlie slowly sped up again and Harry kept looking over his shoulder until the unicorn flock was well out of sight.
Harry had to read the note twice before he understood that one of the other Dragon handlers got knocked off his broom and Charlie had to take an emergency shift because of it. "Let's hope it isn't serious." Harry muttered. He knew falling off a broom could cause horrible injuries.
The last bit was barely audible but Draco grinned. "You'll do fine, stop channelling your inner Granger."
Luckily, when he reached Peony Patch the light was on, so Charlie must've ended his shift. He walked inside and was greeted happily by Charlie. He was watering his plants. "I've been back for a while, what have you been up to?"
"Exactly." Andromeda pointed towards the other armchair. Draco sat down, barely able to look Andromeda in the eyes but did it either way, knowing she would not speak if she didn't have his full attention.
That evening, when they came back at the main building, Charlie almost flew straight up to Mrs. Dell'elion desk. Harry almost thought he had to warn Charlie that flying inside wouldn't be much appreciated when the redhead stopped by the backdoor. They jumped off and ran inside. Charlie was fast. Harry always thought he was an experienced runner but Charlie left him well behind. Once Harry reached the desk, he was fully expecting to see the old lady again but in her place was just a man passing from adult to elderly seeing the wrinkles and tufts of grey in black hair. Judging on the off blue uniform and metal badge, Harry thought he must be the security guard for the night.
As they started to leave he added one last bit and off he went himself, to deal with the aftermath. "Next time you find the need in visiting the Ministry, kindly floo into the Auror department."
Harry came in much slower and did bother to greet her as he made his way to the kitchen. She followed and they sat down, a flick of the wand had tea being made and floating onto the table.
Harry disappeared out of the room, took the magazines from the desk and unceremoniously dropped them onto Draco's head. "That'll shut you up for a while, no?"
Glancing up, Harry caught his own image in the mirror and chuckled lightly. He didn't look that different from the other. He looked like he had gone to hell and back but he knew, felt he was still trapped there. Suddenly everything was too much and when Draco heard the sound, he scrambled to get his stuff out of sight but Harry shook his head, his toneless voice stopped him. "Don't bother."
"It's pretty, isn't it, boys? A female voice broke their moment. Neither heard Zhanna come close to them from wherever she came. Harry actually yelped, so spaced out he was. He turned and gave her a once over. Zhanna was just a smidge taller then him, plump with dirty blond hair and wearing a floor length dress that seemed out of place. She had a cute smile, dimples and all. It took the attention away from mud brown eyes and wrinkles, even if it didn't look bad om her. She had aged well.
"Turn them around, and open the back slot." Andromeda ordered when she noticed neither both had seen the small zippers. They did and both found some neatly folded clothes. Draco's being form fitted jeans, button-ups and a woollen vest; Expensive, semi-formal muggle wear, Draco noted. Harry's were different lengths of scuffed jeans with t-shirts and one set of formal clothes. He'd spied the last set in his bag but didn't take them out. He did, however, got up to hug Andromeda for a heartfelt thanks, and so did Draco.
Harry lacked any real objection to a piggyback ride with Charlie steering his broom but he was a bit sad that while packing, he didn't have the foresight to bring his own. The upside now was that there was no wind cutting his face, hairs blowing into his mouth and that he didn't need to pay attention to anything but his surroundings. He could take everything around him in without worry. Charlie flew along the edge of the Reservoir, weaving in and out the barrier ward. Beneath them were hiking trails in the forests and hill tops stretching far beyond the Reservoir. The rustle of the leaves by the easy breeze was calming.
