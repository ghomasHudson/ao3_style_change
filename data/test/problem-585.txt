It was later that same day, late at night when he was hurrying back to Gryffindor tower after visiting McGonagall to avoid being out after curfew, that he ran into yet another dark hooded figure, this time at the end of a poorly lit Hogwarts hallway.
all these vegetables, he might realize it was in fact not his wife and that he was actually spending money on his despicable nephew and throw a fit. Harry took extra care to hide even more suspicious things, like tofu--if Vernon ever plucked up the desire to bend down and see the back corner of his own fridge Harry might actually die from the lashing he'd get from having brought that 'hippy nonsense' in the house.
"Theory?" Draco chirped towards his mother, and Harry realized as the two adults exchange yet another loaded look, that this might be a clue he hadn’t had before.
, Malfoy.” The tall Slytherin snapped in a tone that said he clearly wasn’t offended with the implication, more that he didn’t
Draco instantly dropped into a scowl, which seemed to light up Blaise’s whole body as he got the reaction he wanted.
“Yikes.” Harry was liking this guy less and less, but could see where Draco was coming from. “What was that about not being in Slytherin though?”
card, and literally anything else he could think of as the giant swayed over his loyalty to Dumbledore and his newfound friend in the son of two people he once cared about.
until he’d had to track the boy down and wrestle the truth out of him said a lot, after all. Harry wouldn’t betray his shy friend by going out and telling
why had no one ever heard of these places? If Daphne didn’t then it really was something arbitrary, or at least hidden, which peeked his interest and made him regret not asking Axeclaw when he was last there.
The fact he now only had one week left brought a sense of relief even if that week seemed like ten years at times too for how the hours seemed to drag on. He’d timed it so that he’d be gone two days before Dudley’s birthday so hopefully they’d be so wrapped up in that they wouldn’t even care he wasn’t there to cook the veritable feasts they always demanded of him on their special days.
He gasped at the screech and something hit the counter over him. He panicked, no words coming and his normal wit failing him entirely.
would’ve done that?” He challenged and Draco was brought up short before tossing his hands in the air.
… but Harry was really just reaching for excuses not to get mad. Being mad was easier than sitting there in terror of what he was about to read while waiting for Axeclaw to get back—he kind of thought he’d need more time or that a real will reading would need to be arranged to
The truth of the matter? His apology to Weasley was utter bullsnitch and he honestly had nothing against the likes of Dean or Seamus. Their muggleborn or half-blood status left something to be desired, but these days he was trying not to think of that too much. He couldn’t change on a dime, but he was making the conscious effort.
Slytherins almost as much as Black did, and the two fed into each other’s hatred and school rivalries until it was positively evil—even said as someone who willingly took the Dark Lord’s mark and actively served him both legitimately and as a spy for years. Many Death Eaters had
There was a third group though, which was where the likes of Hannah and others seemed to fall. They seemed hesitant to approach him, but once they did and he confirmed the rumor for them, they seemed to just gape a bit with wide eyes.
He still didn’t explain what the stone was and frankly Harry didn’t care. His fear had morphed into anger at some point—anger at Dumbledore and anger at this monster who’d taken away his parents. Anger he hadn’t felt since Christmas when rage had made his hands shake for days after facing this mirror. Rage that burned hot and ugly in his chest, sparked by the unfairness of it all when he’d seen his parents look at him so lovingly in a way that would
Ron stumbled back, not being prepared for Harry to whip around fast as lightning, and surprising both of them his hand found perfect purchase on the offender’s cheek to leave a sharp red mark. Rob grabbed at it in shock and whatever cry of indignation almost made it out of his mouth was drowned out by Harry advancing on him with vigor.
The Weasley twins had joined in too, and they were quickly becoming some of his favorite people. They were definitely the life of the party in any room and several second and third years had joined in not long after too, drawn in by the chaotic laughter and excitement the twins could easily whip into a frenzy, so it’d been a great night and a great start to the year. Even Neville had been laughing freely by the end of the night, which made Harry feel all warm and fuzzy.
, but Slytherins liked debts. He thought as much, as least; a trade that can be banked in whenever? How could they say
He didn’t even have the energy to move from where he sat on the ground surrounded by his upturned cart, trunk, and cage, and with the muggle warding stone no one even looked at him anyway, so it was fine.
he walked calmly but with certain purpose down the aisle behind the table and the far wall and didn’t glance to see if anyone was giving him looks for getting too close. He was moderately successful as even Draco didn’t notice his approach until he was shoving his shoulder lightly to make room for himself and the blond jumped a little bit, glancing up at him with grey eyes quickly composed once more and a small smile on his lips.
Harry had already proven he had the ‘intent’ part down in Transfiguration this morning and while he took some cursory bullet-point notes automatically just because, he stopped paying true attention quickly. He noted that almost every pureblood and half-blood he knew of in the room was also either staring out the windows or writing notes back and forth to each other. He figured if you grew up knowing about magic then this was a really stupid class to have to sit through, but everyone had to take it so they were all on the ‘same page’.
He got a bit closer to it, and one hanging curled around a middle branch lifted it’s diamond shaped granite head, coming out as if to look directly at him.
He was caught up in this weirdo event and wondering if this is what most muggle lines looked like, that he snapped his head to the side a little too hard when Axeclaw spoke again, breaking him out of his thoughts as he pointed out another section of the tree. A section Harry belated realized wasn’t actually connected to the main tree at all.
“Gryffindor seems pretty concerned over the house points.” Draco pointed out, ignoring his roommate as he attempted to turn and go sit down, only to be halted by Harry latching onto his sleeve insistently. He paused, seeming to realize something was up and got a concerned look on his face.
wondered why the third floor was forbidden, but Harry’s explanation of ‘one of Hagrid’s pets’ had silenced any further questioning on the topic. It almost made their shoulders hike up in tension as they glanced nervously around the floor for said mysterious pet, keeping close to Hagrid’s side while they were there in the faith the pet would at least be hesitant of eating its owner.
He was only a year older but this kid’s squeaky voice and the fact he was vibrating on the spot made him seem half his actual age, easy.
he mused as he packed up everything after giving up with what he had so far. His clothes he figured were easy—he’d pulled out a long sleeve shirt and a blue bandana to wear around his neck that would look strange as hell in mid-August weather but you know, better than letting people see it. He could cover the grey tone with makeup, he couldn’t change the thin, too stretched skin of his neck that easily.
of their parents… if neither of them had… they might’ve been brothers of a sort if not at least raised as friends if they’d lived in a better world where madmen and their followers didn’t kill and torture people. If they weren't both orphans and their parents were just friends they got to see all the time.
“Knowing about plants is all and well I guess, but I’d have to have top marks in things like Potions and Charms to be a healer. Charms is one thing, but I will never be good at Potions.”
"It seems Salazar Slytherin had three children, of which was always known. It was believed his youngest daughter to be infertile though, as she never bore a child. That is, as of this moment, disproven." Axeclaw observed to no one, probably for Harry’s benefit mostly as it was obvious that was what they’d come to learn. Harry was also kind of annoyed by how unperturbed he was, although in hindsight there was no reason for a goblin to be concerned over the bloodlines of wizards, even if they were related to old famous wizards—humans were humans and goblins didn’t particularly care about humans as a rule.
slightly so they now had the ears of most of the Ministry as well as all their old dark contacts. And of course, money fixed a lot of things so being able to bankroll the dark lord when he returned would also probably help.
"This is never going to work." Lu huffed, crossing his arms pointedly. "We're all at such different skill levels and knowledge of the game that it won't be fair to those learning to have to put up with those more skilled and those who already know the game and want to play won't be content to doing basic passes and kicks every week." He laid out the problem like a true Ravenclaw, his housemates instantly looking thoughtful on how to solve it but not quite sure how. Mainly because most of them didn't really know what the game entailed in the first place.
Quidditch had more competition--Oliver and McGonagall both being quidditch nerds had gushed over him and they clearly knew what they were talking about, so he could be reasonably sure he was good at flying at least. 'Youngest seeker in a century' and all that, so yeah, he had some proof there.
scar was in plain view once more. Clearly he hadn’t been able to cover it up for a while now, and he wasn’t happy about it.
Both seemed entirely blank in return, but Mr. Malfoy nodded once curtly while his wife greeted him politely. “Mr. Potter. My understanding is that you would like to shop with Draco; I have other business to attend to so we will meet again here at three.” She explained curtly, getting right to the point with no room for questions in her tone.
“That glimmer will last a day so you’ll be good for the rest of your time at Hogwarts. I will need to fix up your potion regimen to take with you but you can leave once I collect it all and have plenty of time to make it to lunch today. Pain reduction potions can make you hungry and calming draughts work best on a full stomach so have a full plate even if you’re not starving, please.”
Her wand didn’t stop but her expression paused as she looked down at him in surprise. “Accidental magic? At your age,
were studying for their first big defense test and his nosy self was not invited, he’d elected to visit Hagrid. He felt bad about not stopping by to visit the giant man nearly as much as he planned to, but the Keeper of the Keys didn’t seem to mind at all, just welcomed him in for some tea and then let him trail along as he did his normal route around the grounds to ensure everything was alright. Curious as to what that actually entailed, Harry tagged along for the fun of it and had a great morning listening to Hagrid talk about the trees and gardens and forests. By even an hour into their walk, Harry now fully understood why it was called the

He’d debated about hiding his scar, but decided for it in the end. He used to like it because it made him feel unique, but it served no purpose when he was trying to keep under the Dursley’s radar and he had his hair if he ever wanted to stand out some day. His hair was part of who he was and he took more pride in it than a funny looking scar he got from the car crash that killed his parents. It wasn’t the only thing that made him special anymore, since he decided that he himself was special and he should stop treating himself so terribly, and really
“No more cruel than life has been to him.” Poppy gave a glare for all she was worth, her wand not so much as wavering. Steady as only a medic’s hand could be. “I am a healer. I will do what needs to be done. I cannot face Albus on this, he has too many connections—and I taught him occlumency myself so I couldn’t even get through his mind if I tried. You however… your mind is too open and if he is getting information on Harry through you, do not dare think our years of friendship will stop me from protecting a child.”
“Besides, the floor is huge. Of course we got up there, but in the time we had before Filch came looking, it’s mostly just empty.”
Flitwick was visibly disappointed he didn’t have the same interest and passion for Charms, since that was apparently his mother was great at it, but other than getting decent marks in Charms he wasn’t nearly as gung-ho about it as he was with Transfiguration, and barely read the chapter ahead in that class, much less the whole textbook or any additional readings. He wavered between Os and Es there, and honestly the Es far outweighed the Os he got most days—with a sprinkling of As just for flavor. He’d even gotten a rather unfortunate P once too, much to his chagrin.

Harry really should consider himself lucky that the twins were willing to bank so much on his future Transfiguration skills, because he owed them quite a few favors at this point and they were more than happy to wait a couple years for his skills to be worth cashing in on.
the words were not said but they might as well have been by the red head’s wide, too-pleasant grin and the fury etched onto Montague’s face.
“I’m not going to torture you, you know. It’s literally just a couple of diagnostics spells and then I’ll fix whatever I find. Lady Malfoy tells me you ran into a wall today, so sorry about that.” She pointed out calmly.
moment to let Dean and Lu take charge as the unofficial-official leaders of this club. He plopped down next to Neville on his bench off to the side, ignoring the blue eyes still following him with a silent intensity more fitting on Hedwig, honestly.
“The third years only have to write an essay on the hardening charm? I’ve already written tons on that, it’s a bit boring isn’t it?” He frowned when they’d discussed what they heard about the upper year finals.

He was thankful, because he didn’t have a good reason why he couldn’t respond. He couldn’t even give himself one, though the stupid answer he knew was his pride.
Besides, Blaise would be thirteen by then and if what Draco had told him was true, be getting a lot more pressure from his mother to start making
“You only told Lucius about your wrist because it would impair your ability to write in the coming days of classes.” She put together while totally ignoring his comment, smirking in a pleased way. “Very clever, as it soothed our suspicions and got you what you needed, while still guarding your appearance of strength. I approve of the tactic, if even I’m displeased you attempted to lie to me.”
First, he’d confirmed with Honeydukes that they could arrange and send a chocolate-themed gift basket on his behalf, he just needed to send along the money for their quoted price on it, as well as whatever letter he wanted sent along with it. So, he had one large letter for Honeydukes with the form to open a tab and link his Gringotts accounts to it
subject for this, but Transfiguration was easy for him and with McGonagall willingly, and seemingly out of nowhere, offering her assistance not even realizing what he was actually planning, Harry couldn’t exactly pass up that unexpected gift.
The Slytherins didn’t ask though, but they sure gave him an even wider birth out of sheer wariness that his weirdness was somehow contagious considering he’d roped some Hufflepuffs and a Ravenclaw into his schemes too. He’d invited and then proceeded to needle Draco into playing with them and got a resounding ‘

the fact that she had her whole life planned out before everything changed right before the start of this year. Her parents were in an alliance with the Malfoys and when the Malfoys went grey, I heard they cut it off dead. She’s as ambitious as anyone, so she was fully intending to marry into their family—which definitely would’ve been considered marrying up— and live out her days as part of one of the oldest, purest, and
“I’m glad you’re in one piece Harry, but now I can tell you to your face how much of an idiot you are,” Draco ranted without preamble as he pulled them down to sit on the steps and Harry was dunked right into this confrontation. At least he didn’t beat around the bush needlessly and cause more stress working up to it. Maybe he got that from his mom. “
Harry was light and polite when he asked, and the tall boy beside him just turned his chin forwards once more. The Slytherin had been staring at him not so subtly since they left the Great Hall, and Draco had actually dropped behind them. His expression was calm and smooth as always, but Harry knew his stomach was in knots over this coming potions class. Harry couldn’t fault him—he sort of felt the same way but was apparently better at hiding it.
Harry snapped his face into the most non-aggressive, calm smile he could. Ron had caused no problems at all over Christmas break besides his snoring, and had really just avoided him the whole year, ever since Halloween
Harry tried to absorb that, flashing back to some of Daphne’s lessons and realizing the gap he’d been missing.
the football team in here, but they were by far the biggest group and had taken over the ends of the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables in the center of the room to spread out and work on their team shirts.
Harry had not really had a Christmas himself, but he was well aware of the concept. He’d seen the movies they played in school, he got caught up in the holiday spirit like the whole world did even if the Dursleys themselves never really brought it into their home themselves. Oh yes, they had him stringing up lights and wrapping presents and decorating the tree and the house and cooking their holiday meals, but somehow the true

of being that sassy really, and he supposed befriending a spoiled brat had its upsides. He smiled widely at this thought.
Because as much as he loved Draco and trusted McGonagall, love and trust would not save him in the end.
“What?” Montague finally broke, seeming taken off guard despite seeming pissed a Gryffindor firstie was actually talking to him right now.
she’d even mentioned the Hogwarts express was one of the most well-guarded places in the magical world since there were a bunch of unattended magical children on it. So he couldn’t exactly
“You deserve to know, I suppose, although you will not tell any of your fellow students.” He nodded in agreement as she gave a sigh and continued. “Hogwarts has been protecting an important object all year after it was threatened in its original hiding spot in Gringotts. Hogwarts was deemed the most secure place after that, and we knew someone would attempt to steal it, but had hoped to leave openings and catch them in the act so they could face justice. We didn’t realize they would make an attempt while there were still children in the school, nor that it would be one of our own.” She seemed genuinely remorseful about it, and Harry believed her. He recalled upper years saying Quirrell only started wearing the turban this year—if she’s known him as a teacher for years before he became possessed, she probably had no reason to suspect him now.
“Free me…" He frowned, eyes closing as if in weariness as he tried to grasp this concept. "Who… family…"

” She told him pointedly, but calmly. He seemed surprised by that change in direction the conversation had taken. “First year spells are what they are to protect growing magical cores from overexerting themselves too young. You can learn all the theory you’d like and I’d never stop you, but the fact you were able to perform and alter a third-year level spell concerns me, because I fear you’re unknowingly doing damage to your magical core.”
“Hogwash!” Hagrid burst out, causing Harry to jump a bit in surprise. “What downrigh’ ‘orrible muggles—yer Lily and James’ child and ya don’ even know wha’ they look like! Absolute cobswallop!”
Any question on his outfit choices was derailed when the twins had dropped to their knees and cried in dramatic fear that that was his ‘ass kicking’ outfit and they were all in for it now. It had sparked enough laughter and was so weird that the color of his shorts seemed secondary to surviving he intense training regime Wood had whipped up on the spot to get them to stop goofing off.
As it was, Harry, Draco, and Neville had followed at a distance to ensure Hagrid actually made it to the third floor instead of chickening out and taking Norbert back to his hut, and he’d paused long enough a couple times that Harry knew if the man didn’t know they were following him, he probably would’ve done just that. It was because of that, that not even Draco put up a fuss when they followed him all the way to the forbidden third floor to

A presence beside him had him looking up, realizing Blaise was looking down at him with an unreadable expression, bag still on his shoulder and not taking his self-appointed seat behind them.
, we’re going to have tons of things to do from here on out…! Aw, come on, would you like me to hold your hand too? I typically only do it for people who are having a bad day but for you, I’ll make an exception.” He teased wickedly. Neville just shifted, not having said a word since reuniting with Draco but just pressed close to Harry’s side.
“You can’t make me care about it!” He declared, giving him a playful look over his shoulder, to which he got an annoyed groan in return. Not really ready to settle down just yet though, still overwhelmed by this unexpectedly exciting opportunity in front of him, he walked around their little bubble just to inspect it further. There really wasn’t much to it but he did like the fireplace itself—it wasn’t nearly as ornate or roaring as Gryffindor’s, being much smaller and more for ambiance rather than heat in the still-warm fall weather, but the stone carvings around it were some of the castle’s finest work.
Adrian Pucey and Terence Higgs were outer members of the alliance—they got onto the team in their own ways not strictly related to their talent so they were clearly useful to the alliance. Both were dark, but more… Theo level dark. So,
“Theoretically if his magical core is being taxed it might stunt normal growing so it’s probably just to be sure. Better safe than sorry and nutrient potions only help, even if you’re not deficient. They’re nasty tasting but can only do some good.” He explained automatically and Theo seemed to accept that logic.
He shook that odd train of thought off quickly. “Anyway, the broom did settle a bit after the first bout of it acting up, so maybe he was saying a counter-spell or something.”
that he could then hide in his cupboard entirely. Again, going with his ‘low expectations’ mantra, he stuck to things he needed and could get at either the grocery store where he shopped or the drug store he passed on his way home: new underwear, new socks, tiny bottles of nicer shampoo and conditioner, a sewing kit to try and fix some of his hand-me-down clothes just a little bit with his unskilled hands, band-aides, new shoelaces, hair ties of prettier colors, soap, notebooks, pens, crossword puzzles for his long cupboard-times, a decent flashlight for said cupboard, a reading light for a book, and the list went on. Tiny things the Dursleys wouldn’t notice, but things to make his life just a little more bearable.
table one fine weekend morning. He didn’t even need all his fingers to count the amount of times Draco had willingly, of his own accord without prompting, come to sit with him at the Gryffindor table in the past year, so this was a big thing.
aside, he was feeling pretty good with himself. The Potions professor might’ve been a royal snitch in his behind, but he was predictable in his maliciousness. Predictable people, Harry could definitely handle—he’d only had a lifetime with the Dursleys to get the hang of it. Snape had made it clear he hated him, so if Harry proceeded under the assumption that the snarly teacher would pull out all the stops to get at him, he could plan accordingly and as annoying a hindrance it was, it wasn’t a
“To be honest I know the least about Hufflepuff, so if you are you’ll have to tell me all about it. Or we’ll both be there and we’ll learn together! How’s that?”
The international wizarding communities—those that knew about the British wizarding prison at least as it was all rather hush-hush—condemned this place as heinous and vile. A war crime even, although she was fairly certain that was a muggle term that hadn’t yet tainted magical communities in the UK.
“Uh, I did have a couple questions actually, on my last statement. But ah… I think you said you had a potion to stop the aftereffects?” He hinted, and the goblin nodded.

“Oh.” Harry had no idea what to make of that. Hadn’t considered it before but he did know Draco was a night owl and that he
"Yes father." Draco complied immediately and stood, glancing back at him with a warmer smile, though it was back to his small, polite smiles instead of real ones. "It was nice to meet you Harry." He said politely, clearly well trained to have good manners and making sure to be on them in front of his parents, both of them acutely aware they were being watched like hawks now.
The only thing they had in common was that they were formidable opponents or allies to have, and that the Dark Lord had never tried to mark the two as his before. No one in either of the two families had a dark mark on them, but the reasons for that were not exactly similar. The Zabini’s were powerful, and their international connections meant even the Dark Lord wouldn’t risk insulting them, at least not when he was still mid-way through taking over magical Britain
And Blaise didn’t need to flaunt that he was wealthy to be the untouchable Slytherin. Hell, Draco was utterly distraught to realize
He’d told Hermione how helpful her books had been, and she’d been happy to track down the next one in the series for him, but he hadn’t read it yet. It had started talking about what’s
To his credit, Draco didn’t ask for details and just tilted his head back to think it over. “Ask Father, to start.” He admitted honestly, but by Harry’s unamused deadpan continued without prompting. “I would guess Father would say I’d need to cash in favors, and if I didn’t have any I’d have to get some. If it’s an adult you’re up against, you’ll need adult allies I’d think, no way around it.”
reputation behind the Malfoy family and realized it was far more complicated than he could’ve even imagined. Turns out them being grey was probably fitting—they really did not care about anything but money and power, as a defined trait, and Dark and Light connections were always just a means to an end.
“To say it lightly,” The Zabini sniffed delicately. “Fourth years had him second block and said he’s a vain idiot.” He declared bluntly.
And while he’d never regret nor apologize for his willing decisions, it didn’t mean he didn’t feel a bit guilty about what how his choices would impact Draco, and so he smiled his most apologetic, warm smile he could at his friend, which seemed to sooth the blond a fraction.
"A bit. Magical creatures and dark monsters and such, can't go totally wrong with that I suppose. The defense and attack spells sound like they're going to be more fun, but it'll be a while until we get to that."
“Wonderful.” He sighed, a lot louder and more annoyed this time. “Since you seem to know so much about it… what would you say if I were, like…
Harry made a show of tapping his chin trying to think, before he realized that he actually had no idea. Dean had nothing he wanted and maybe he was hanging out with the Slytherins too much, but something about that struck him as odd.
in the direction of implying an invitation, he’d been shut down pretty swiftly. He knew Harry’s relatives didn’t like magic and he was actually hiding the fact he was writing to him at all from his family, so he got the message pretty quickly that his guardians wouldn’t let him go even if he had officially invited him.
Harry was surprised, but he felt a smile forming on his lips unwillingly, as a warmth and fond amusement hijacked his heart.
want those things so it was only natural—he was born that way and any other thought process was foreign.
Narcissa nodded, not surprised by this conclusion, probably having thought through it herself. This is why he loved this woman.
And Narcissa’s eyes were much bluer, but the last time someone had pinned his gaze like that and compelled to his
He frowned though, thinking it through. "How did you know Quirrell was possessed then? If you had no idea and just found us in that chamber…"
The fact he was good enough at arguing his point to know what equation to use and how to break it down in a clearly worded, simple manner only a child would be so good at was impressive enough, but backing himself up with no less than two dozen texts and principles proven to be true meant his argument was all but impenetrable. She would have to run it by Septima to double check the Arithmancy, but from what she knew of the subject is was all spot-on.
“Bit hot for a hat, don’t ya think?” Hagrid commented casually as they rode the subway wherever it was that they were going. Boring as traveling was most days, watching Hagrid try to navigate a bus, a train, and a subway, commenting all the clever ‘muggle inventions’ a bit too loudly and then whipping out a
Her smile could’ve cut ice as she brushed down the front of her robes briskly. “Turel informed me when she tended to your wrist that it wasn’t the only injury you have on you. I asked you to stay for tea because I’ve also summoned our family healer to see to you more thoroughly.” She inclined her head gracefully towards him. “And you will not resist.”
an answer about what the bloody hell this approach was but he was very much not in the right frame of mind to actually say something for a solid couple of seconds.
“No way, I need a Gryffindor recalibration to start the year off before pestering other houses. Susan can come bother me if she wants to ask about my mail wards, at least for today.” He said it like it was a joke, but he didn’t just mean Susan either—rules applied for any particularly mother-hen-like Slytherins he knew of too.
After all, at eleven-years-old, James Potter had been a bit of a spoiled brat and Lily Evans had been a bit of a foul-tempered know-it-all. They
Also, he felt a little light-headed from having a wand pointed directly into his face. To say it didn’t bring up great memories was an understatement.

He made a lot of Hufflepuff friends as people came up to him to talk about it, cheering him on as they too were a bit annoyed with the two house rivalry, and he’d gotten an earful from both Hermione and several Ravenclaws who were appalled by the blatant display of violence. Some more chill Ravenclaws said it was enjoyable, but most thought it was pretty startling—better than the normal fighting in the halls or passive aggressive comments during class, but still not their favorite thing.

If he spent a significant amount of time curled up in his bed reading Dell’s journals or in his dorm bathroom using up all the potions the hairdressers in Contrair Alley had given him to make his hair curly or straight or fluffy just to play around with his admittedly large collection of hair supplies after his Christmas haul, that was also no one’s business but his own.
“Good morning dear. Harry.” Mrs. Malfoy nodded politely in greeting to them, and Harry felt obligated to nod back with a low ‘good morning’ of his own. Draco seemed to relax a fraction though and greeted them a bit more warmly.
She had plenty of contacts and favors to cash in so it was only a matter of going about checking in with her network of allies—only to be started when one of them said she wasn’t the only on interested in something similar.
the words went unspoken but he felt it harshly in his stomach that was exactly what her wide eyes were trying to silently communicate to him.
“They were Ancient and Noble, of course. I never met any of them before they died out but it’s said they had a good commerce base and plenty of researchers in their line. They were quite small most of their history, tended to marry pureblood when they did marry but had a bit of a reputation for being single or childless on the most part which probably didn’t help their chances of survival.” Harry actually appreciated how clinically he was talking, as if only imparting information to Draco as if this wasn’t pertinent to Harry’s history
, actually. He’d very carefully left out talk of how far he’d come with his Transfiguration work amongst the snakes in his life.
time you’ve almost died! And you dismissed me worrying about the broom incident!” Draco accused him.
“Except McGonagall.” Harry corrected, and at his questioning look continued. “She listens to me when I talk Transfiguration and actually responds as if I’m an equal. Think that’s why I like her so much.”
“I’ve only ever played football but quidditch as a sport sounds amazing; and actually flying!? I’ll race ya’ to see who can stay on the broom longest, Harry.” Dean joked too, and Harry grinned at him.
But that was probably an unrealistic line of thinking even if it was true—the chances of them actually expelling
that this wasn’t his fault. I mean he hadn’t thought it was, he’d just assumed this was something else terrible he’d encountered, as there was a lot of those encounters these days. In any case, it was still a relief that Mr. Malfoy personally wasn’t judging him
If they’d known that all along it would make a lot of sense than that they just literally hate their own nephew for no good reason. They’re stupid, and cruel, but they’re not smart enough to have held a grudge for what amounts to a decade over stupid little things like the fact they “put clothes on his back” or “feed him”. They were terrible people but if they were going to hate him constantly for ten years then it’s because of something that hasn’t changed in all of those ten years. Him being not
and Voldemort was a ghost who very much wanted him dead but that was just kind of a ubiquitous fact of life at this point. Voldemort wasn’t going to come after him before next summer when he’d be faced with Private Drive, so it was a secondary concern for the time being. The most imminent threat deserved more of his brain power and therefore he spent more time trying to confront that trauma mentally than what had happened between him and Quirrell.
Harry wondered if he would’ve had that complex too, had he had parents to grow up with and look up to.
“The downside to this is that whatever teacher’s subject this is, they took two hundred points from Slytherin for it. And Snape can’t even argue about it because, come on:
But it meant someone had snitched, seeing them leave the castle after dark and informing Snape that he’d catch a couple Gryffindors if he just posted up and waited them out—Harry hadn’t exactly cared who’d seen him go at the time because he had no idea Hagrid was going to get them caught up in illicit activities out of the blue like that, nor that they’d spend that long trying to convince the ground’s keeper not to be a blooming idiot about the whole thing, to very little success.
There was only so much worrying you could do alone though, and it’d eaten at him all break until he finally set eyes on Harry to see he wasn’t dying in a puddle somewhere, but even though some of his fears were soothed it wasn’t nearly as fixed as he thought it’d be. He just… wasn’t sure how things were actually broken or how to go about fixing this thing that he couldn’t put a finger on in the first place. Given his parents utter lack of commentary on meeting Harry earlier that day, he knew they were up to something as well but probably had way more awareness of the situation than him which was kind of annoying.
set of disappointed puppy dog eyes until Harry couldn’t take it anymore and excused himself from class to go lie down—if only to pacify his friend since he really did feel much better literally minutes after leaving the room.
the blood-red and gleaming gold tie and badge that’d appeared on his robes since he got sorted kind of matched his hair so… there was that.
take a wild guess and say it was probably related to Harry not getting away with it in some way. He sure as hell had not been acting like himself this summer nor in this talk in the alley today, so for some reason he wasn’t being allowed to be who he wanted to be or do what he wanted to do, and that was probably crushing him slowly.
That was another point in favor of specializing—if he thought it was good for trades then he’d underestimated how much Slytherins liked information. It had turned out even better than he’d hoped if he’d got an invite directly into the snake den itself within a year and change of starting Hogwarts after a centuries-long house feud. This was awesome!
have bouts of accidental magic after getting to Hogwarts, and they were kind of hard to forget.” He teased dryly, and Harry rolled his eyes.
Once he was content that he had as many books as he could physically read in this coming school year
Draco lifted his head, realizing this plan had merit. Whether he knew it or not, Harry had used him to make a point about where he stood in this school—and Draco had known from literally day one
With that information distracting him, it took him a second to realize what Luna was getting at by telling him this though.
accidental magic incidents last year and the rumors about how much magical power you have is going to go crazy. I know that’s what Blaise was thinking at lunch just now—Nott too actually, but Blaise is the one who’s going to tell everyone.”
“May I? I’m quite partial to sweets.” The headmaster asked, and while Harry thought it kind of weird and rude, even he couldn’t eat all those sweets so he just shrugged. He watched the wizened man pluck a jelly bean from a Bertie’s Box and hum to himself as he tasted it… “Ah. Earwax.”
"W-wha..I.." Lucius would have laughed at the small squeak that ended in, but he was already running through the best solutions to fix this conversation. Brutal honesty seemed the best way. Maybe it would pound through that cushioning charm.
Lucius grimaced at the thought of giving Draco the talk if the boy was this slow on kissing. Hell no. He did his part as a parent! Cissy could get her ass into gear for that lovely conversation. He scowled. Why did he have to be the parent to scar his kid with these types of conversations? He was not cut out to be giving the boy advice of that sort because his own father never even had to. Lucius knew he was going to be married to Narcissa since his first year at Hogwarts, there hadn't been much room to expand on that bloody part!
But Lucius Abraxas Malfoy was going to be the first to confess (and unfortantely, only in his mind for the time being): his son was irrevocably romantically retarded. Honestly, he didn't think all those years ago when his love had been pregnant that he should have wished for anything other than his child being born healthy; because there was more to a child than that apparently. He never would have thought he should have been wishing for his first born to understand romantic feelings, be able to translate them, and then act accordingly. Definitely would have saved a lot of migraines.
"..-Could the git at least brush his bloody hair? And those aweful glasses! Father, they are three times too big for his stupid head! Why doesn't he take a damn eye correction potion? All those damn wire lenses do is get in the way! Its so muggle like!"
"Father! He did it again! Can you believe the nerve of that bloody git? Rushing head first into anything that bores You-Know-Who's name and being all gryffindor like some bloody knight-in-shining-armor! What a bunch of complete bollocks!"
"It's not that bloody complicated Draco! Quit being so thick-headed! You're a slytherin! From the moment you met Harry, you've been scrambling for his attention, any bloody attention! You're like a five year old pulling on his crushes pigtails and stepping on toes! You are jealous of the Weaselys and Granger because they're actually getting positive attention from the boy when you're not. Do everyone a favor and grow the bloody hell up! French kiss the boy in front of the entire school for all I care, but do not come back in my office again with one of your lovesick rants because I swear, by merlins balls, I will walk willingly into an Avada Kedavra!"
Lucius gave a half-hearted shrug as he read over the details of the report in his hand. Why didn't his son ever track down his mother for these rants? Not like she really did much other than have tea parties to socialize with the other Ladies. She always knew what to say when it came to Draco's... dilemmas. Lucius struggled to even keep up with the boy when he opened his mouth. He found himself suddenly missing the little boy who used to sit in his lap and be content with getting to spend time with his papa. That small child had been so easily pleased and the only dilemmas needing fixed was buying some toy or delicious treats.
It had been in the moment he had lost all loyalty he had felt for Voldemort; he was officially out. He didn't attend another death-eater meeting, and Severus seemed to be following in his footsteps at the murder of Lily.
'Born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies...' Those words had damned two families with all of Voldemort's paranoia; the Longbottoms and the Potters both had sons born July 30 and 31, respectfully. While Lucius didn't put much into divination and all that rot, it appeared that his Lord did as it seemed to tear at the once unbreakable man for the next year; breathing down his neck. He became easier to anger and didn't hesitate to take his rage out on anyone he deemed worthy. Dumbledore's lies about all Dark magic being evil had people snubbing their noses at anyone who breathed a word of a spell 'too tainted'; it only intensified with Voldemort's volatile attitude and his appearance had turned... decidedly unnatural. Suddenly, being apart of the Circle meant being a murder and a wanted criminal for the dark arts; not that his Lord showed any acknowledgement of the sudden shift of the public's opinion, because he was busy hunting down two 15 month old babies.
“Fine.” He resigns, irritated and moves down the room to a spot that’s empty. How could his mood possibly drop anymore?
“I've already said sorry! I did your childish promise! If I remember correctly my words were ‘ wanted your attention’, meaning past tense. I obviously don't agree with my child self!”
Draco sits up, hands shooting straight to his head, where the worst of the pain resides. He groans and casts a Tempus charm.7:34 AM. Normally Draco would just get ready and wait for a reasonable time to go to breakfast, but he's been promising himself that he would tell Narcissa the truth. Anxiously pulling on his clothes he sets up the fireplace ready to call her. He sits for a moment, then Narcissa’s head sits in the flames, and he straightens his back along with his cloak.
Love? She thinks, curious. So, technically mates aren’t chosen at random? Though falling in love usually seems random at the time. Rarely does it ever make sense. She smiles as she thinks of a certain freckled git. Sighing, she continues as the sun gradually slips from the room.
“I love you too Draco, now if you would not mind, I quite fancy you not being single for the rest of your life. Go get your man.” Draco cuts off the call with a blush and a curse of embarrassment.
was used on him. At the thought, Harry cringes and he feels a pang of guilt. He shakes his head, now's not the time. Interested, he follows regardless. At once he's aware of desperate weeping coming from somewhere inside. Startled, he hides behind a pillar, not wanting to interrupt something so intimate like the last time. That doesn't mean he won't listen though - he doesn't have the nerve of a Gryffindor for nothing.
“What do you mean ‘won't be enough’? Not enough for you or for your Veelas side?” Slightly surprised Harry could think of something so subtle he answers.
“I’m sorry.” Draco says after a minute of hesitation, straightening his shoulders, and holding his chin high. Draco had apologized to Harry before. When Harry had given him his wand, he blurted out said apology, then swiftly walked away. Harry better realize the importance of him saying it twice.
“Hi Pans.” Draco says with a small smile her way, feeling bad for his attitude she had to deal with. Unforeseen, Pansy neither answers nor acknowledges his presence. Her eyes never stray from the magazine in her hand. Unbelieving that Pansy would ignore him, he tries again.
“I've ruined everything Myrtle! All because I was a jealous lovestruck little boy whose only way to get his crush's attention was to make him feel horrible! Do you know how much I regret it? It eats me up from the inside. The horrible things I said to Granger? Then listening to her screams on my drawing-room floor, while the Weasly pounds on the wall. I've done unforgivable things..”  Concerned, Harry peaks around to see the state Malfoys in. Myrtle is trying to help, but considering she isn't a solid being, it doesn't seem to be working.
us, it probably chose you more for bringing a lowly death eater to the light than for your own sake.” It's teetering on true. Draco loves him because he is the light. Everything he wishes to be. Has always wished to be. If they were together, it would only benefit Draco, he's not wrong on that. The Daily Prophet would have a grand old time writing about the defamed Malfoy heir tricking their gracious Potter into his poisoned touch.
“One will be casting the knockback jinx while the other casts Protego. Tomorrow the roles will be reversed, so choose wisely! Don't wanna be stuck with someone you hate.” She laughs and Draco rolls his eyes. She continues to talk about technique and theory for a moment before she finally allows the students to work. Begrudgingly he looks to Pansy, hoping she's gotten tired of the silent treatment. They lock eyes and she points with expectance in front of her. There Harry stands alone, Granger and Weasley already making their way to another part of the room, teeth showing and hands clasped. Scoffing, Draco shakes his head and strolls over to her.
Harry storms into the Gryffindor common room - Hermione shoots up, taking in his appearance. Ron wakes up from lack of heat on his lap. Ron, bleary-eyed, takes in Harry's look as well.
They’ve been at it for hours, and Ron's chagrined. He had complained and complained the whole time, Hermione never once faltering in her mission. Barely any texts have information on Veelas; Hermione's agitation continues to grow. With every book she passes to the side she lets out a huff, frizzy hair flying.
Perhaps Draco was being genuine earlier in the week. He looks so distressed - surely no one would act like this on their own time if it wasn't real. Harry's palms begin to sweat, and he has a sudden need to help Malfoy. Even if it is his former rival, seeing someone in this state is troubling.
“No idea, we haven't spoken since I gave him his wand. You don't think he'd try cursing me after all this do you?” Hermione faces both boys and stops walking.
“Then why haven’t you met up with him yet? He watches you anytime you’re in proximity. He’s confused, waiting.”
“Pick a partner, because today we’ll be practicing nonverbal magic!” She chirps, making eye contact with students here and there.
“Prick. What're you doing here?” Malfoy asks, not pulling away. He brings his hands up and rests them on Harry's chest, still crying.
“I wanted to talk before but you ended up jinxing me and running. I doubt you'll stay the second time around.” Malfoy scoffs, his eyes squinting.
“I told Harry,” Draco sniffs, “a few days ago.” Myrtle sits down beside him, laying her head on his shoulder.
“If you ever find a reason, you have to tell me. Because I want to understand this.” His voice was certainly frustrated enough for it. “Why you feel like you didn’t want my help.”
It spoke to the young Malfoy’s level of distress that he was saying this at the Slytherin table during dinner, loudly, with not a care in the world who heard him. Given that the whole school had just watched Harry almost fall to his death, they weren’t giving him a hard time about sitting here tonight. In fact in the name of house unity they were ignoring him all together because they’d lost the game today, which meant Gryffindors were not to be considered worth
… he couldn’t help but imagine it for a brief moment here and there and was… conflicted, about what his assumptions were telling him. Potter had
All three of them stared at him, openly. Lord knows what Draco and Theo were thinking though as their poker faces were firmly back in place, but Blaise blinked several times rapidly.
“Do you honestly think we’re ever going to get to practical work in Defense? Because having met Lockhart, I don’t.” He scoffed. “And Pomfrey wasn’t worried about Charms; she said second-year Charms’ spells were light enough it shouldn’t bother me. It’s mostly because I’ve put too much emphasis on Transfiguration.”
Snape surprisingly didn’t jump to the top of his list. I mean, if he really wanted him dead the potions professor wouldn’t have been the one beside McGonagall pulling him from that troll’s fist not two weeks ago—there were many other teachers present and his loud distaste of him in particular would’ve been a good excuse to just let someone else help the crushed student and stand back to watch the scene unfold. Also, if nothing else Snape would be bored in his first-year classes without his resident
, Mr. Zabini, are perplexing. You want nothing to do with me, but you can’t keep your mouth shut. You clearly want to avoid conflict but aren’t afraid to finish it when it starts; you look down at me and certainly don’t like Neville, but you put at least some effort into defending him as a favor for me out of some kind of twisted respect? Or perhaps even some odd form of obligation so that there would be no interpretation that you would then
of the school seemed to be generally with the program—or at least the blatant whispering and stares had seriously eased off.
“Jasmine is better, is all I’m saying. Earl grey will do in a pinch, but it tastes like a cloud.” Harry dismissed him.
He… couldn’t think about Draco, in this hypothetical situation. He was too terrified of asking and finding out the answer. Or, simply terrified that his answer might be
who came to her with wide green eyes always so surprised when she complimented him, and surprised that she wasn’t dismissing or ignoring him every time he spoke.
History told him if he didn’t sit up and at least pretend to be awake in the next minutes, the shaking would turn to magically summoned water and that always put him in a foul mood for the rest of the day, so as soon as he was just awake enough to make that connection he lurched upright with a groan, blinking.
He’d inherited the Monroe family magic, he could prove that with his blood test this morning. The requirements for inheriting magic from and Ancient and Noble house were to commit and act of magical vengeance or victory against the person who’d wiped them out. Obviously Voldemort had been the perpetrator, and obviously Harry had, somehow, gotten vengeance over him. Killed him or simply reduced him to that ghost… that apparently counted.
off his broom to forcefully drag the rouge stick earthwards again. It was an awkward grip and he felt his heart lodge into his throat as the weightlessness of flying his own broom disappeared and then both of them were tumbling to the ground with an unhelpful broomstick between them. Neville screamed and it was all Harry could do to hold onto the broom handle with one hand in a death grip, and fist the other into Neville’s robes for dear life.
, no great proclamation or dramatic confrontation in front of the whole school that changed things. Harry honestly hadn’t even seen it coming, and even later when he tried to think about it in earnest, he had no idea what triggered the change.
Severus had never actually liked Quirinius, and him acting off last year had obviously made it worse. Yes Severus was serving Dumbledore in protecting the stone, but he hadn’t known the dark lord was around to even want the stone and so it could be seen as continuing to follow orders in his master’s absence.
He’d only been twelve a couple months at this point, but the tone still irritated him. He wasn’t stupid enough to think he’d always been that good at picking up social clues, but he wasn’t
, he felt his imagine itch to be let free and just picture himself over a big cauldron of some crazy concoction or flying through the air on a broomstick like a real witch from picture books…
Neville’s now free-falling body was a bad idea. He only held on long enough to stop Neville’s momentum dead before he couldn’t hold the broom anymore from the force of it and slipped—two boys and a stupid broomstick going tumbling to the Earth in a free fall that was a lot less scary than it’d been three seconds ago.
introduce herself to a whole train of new people in search of someone else’s toad. She might be smart, but she was way more bold than the traditional bookworm and given the hat’s speech he wasn’t shocked by the turn of events.
He wasn’t sure what happened, all he knew was that the air was unnaturally hot and the moist, filthy hand on him was wrenched away as if burned. There was a shattering sound so loud his ears ached, and when his vision cleared a second later, every single thing that had been on the counters, the tables, the shelves around the kitchen… was broken on the floor, bits of broken glass and ceramic rolling to a stop across the now covered white tiles amongst twisted metal scraps of ex-kitchen appliances and splintered wooden cooking utensils.
He hummed vaguely in acknowledgement, before a thought hit him. He looked up suddenly at Draco who blinked in alarm at the green eyes suddenly shining brightly in his face.
As soon as he asked himself that, he realized he already knew. Harry wanted to do whatever he wanted, whenever he wanted, with whoever he wanted. He wanted to be free, to have the freedom of choice—to act and speak like he wanted with no repercussions. Which was selfish and unique and just so
By the time the next day ended, Harry realized that this was going to be way worse than he’d been imagining. Even he, who was pretty damn cynical, had tried to think of the bright side by thinking of all the things he
about the theory to be able to successfully alter a spell and leave a gaping hole in the magical world’s understanding of Transfiguration as a branch of magic, she very much doubted he was just reading theory. Which means he was
“Right.” Draco simply accepted that, and it was probably the simplest conversation they’d ever had. The surprisingly oblivious snake must finally be picking up on some things after all this time to be able to read the room for once. “Speaking of a foundation, did you ever get an answer on your investment? That glasses shop, right? It could be a good opportunity depending on how it’s set up.”
, realizing that despite the sharp tone, Nott remembered all the way back to first day when he’d snapped at him to call him Monroe. That was…
I've seen people talking about what they imagine Harry to look like in this and so the links below are actually what prompted me to write this in the first place--all are mostly fanart from the BNHA fandom and obviously I imagine them all red in Harry's case. I figure he'll re-do his hair as he sees fit to get around to these styles eventually :P
“Harry! First you miss the train then you ditch us!?” Seamus cried indignantly and Dean clapped him on the shoulder with a laugh as he sat down at the table too.
Still, he had what he’d wanted two-fold—a bargaining chip with which to get into more Slytherins’ good sides and their information network,
to be young and stupid. That had passed, and now he was under no illusion that the war would not come back in full force one day. Call him paranoid or war torn, it didn’t matter—the fact Quirrell had been
It was quite a bit after afternoon tea that Turel popped in again, and Mrs. Malfoy paused in her explanation of how they’d started to breed the peacocks to lean over and let the small elf whisper something in her ear. Harry was suspicious, but not nearly as much as he was when the woman sat up again and gave him a smile that iced him to his core.
He ran up to the purchase desk which was thankfully empty and slipped a couple galleons from his pockets although he guessed a book like this wouldn’t cost nearly so much—the clerk just smiled politely at him and picked the book up to check the price.
however it wasn’t the main reason he’d asked either. Someone had had his key before Hagrid, and he already had a main suspect. “Apologies for not knowing much, but I didn’t know magic was real until this morning; is Gringotts like a nor—uh, a muggle bank that is has statements and, like, everything? Sorry, I didn’t even know how other banks work but since I’ve an account here I am just curious, if you know anything.” He hedged.
looked as she had a son to raise, a house to run, and politics to sway, but had she noted some convenient opportunity in front of her she would’ve taken it. It just hadn’t happened upon her as of yet.
Still on guard of course, but it felt a bit more comfortable to know this was all according to Draco’s plan and he trusted the Malfoy heir before a lot of people.
He walked in and a bell at the door alerted his entrance, and a man looked up from where he was writing something at a desk near the back. The shop consisted of plain tan walls and tiled floors, a long row of spinning black chairs on metal stands lined up on one wall and very muggle-looking eye charts on the other. It kind of gave a hair-dresser like vibe actually.

In short order, only a few more names were called before clearly his name was coming up. He figured this was it when McGonagall paused just a second too long looking down at the list in front of her, but her face didn’t give a thing away thankfully.
to straighten him out, at least just a bit, since it was clear his own parents would never actually discipline him.
Neville seemed to want nothing more than to disappear from sight; it was written all over his blotchy, tear soaked face clear as day and into every line of his slouched posture where his shoulders curled in as if he could smother himself from existence if he wished hard enough.
the one talking quidditch on study time.” Harry countered and Draco ignored it in favor of pushing a textbook into the middle of them and changing the topic to crushed beetle shells quickly, his ears slightly pink.
They're dead and they should stay that way… this world wouldn't be the way it is without their sacrifices. Without people who live and die for something
Again, not a pleasant conversation but at least they got that out of the way. He had a feeling making sure they were all on the same page

At least he had faith no one would throw a punch like if he were a Slytherin approaching the Gryffindor table, although retribution if he messed this up would probably be a lot more long-lasting.
a werewolf child? Or maybe he got infected after Hogwarts… either way he hadn’t reached out once in twelve years and while Harry couldn’t help but be a little bitter about that, from Daphne’s attitude on this topic, he couldn’t get properly mad at the guy either. Sounds like life had been a royal bitch to him too.
Normally he wouldn’t announce his presence quite so loudly in the Slytherin side of the Great Hall, but he wanted to catch his friend before he could sit down to breakfast properly. True to form Draco paused to turn and spare him a greeting smile
feel like it was something from the Hogwarts library. Severus knew enough of the dark arts to know that spell had been tricky in a way only the most annoyingly brutal dark spells could be. Still easily reversible as professional brooms were far too well protected to be damaged long, but still.
“I—uh—yeah! Thank you!” he perked up, taking a few seconds for his brain to stop short-circuiting but then getting back to it at full steam. “That’s so awesome, I was so excited to meet you! When I was reading about the magical world there were a bunch of book on you you know and everything you did is just so
“You haven’t eaten I don’t think and you’ve got to be hungry—Neville’s bringing food back to the tower and I’ve got my pockets full here of candy if you want to share? Tons of it, take your pick: gummies, chocolate, bubble gum, sours-”
“Did you actually want to go back to Bethany’s or do you just want to get books another day? Did you have any other summer plans or could we meet up another day to talk books specifically?” He proposed and Draco perked up at that idea.
coughed out for Harry’s benefit, and then she was gone into the bustle of people watching the showdown curiously as they made their way to lunch.
be interested in the game, and further isolate himself from his potential future allies, later down his path at Hogwarts.
The remaining three kept tense and silent as they entered, and Blaise thinking they’d just go their own way to let what had happened settle their nerves some—but Harry had one last surprise for him as he broke the silence with a rather dry tone.
“Wha-” He gave a strangled gasp but he couldn’t even get it out before the wand was up again, and this time he heard it.
The silence that followed after was like a dose of pepper-up because suddenly Lucius felt wide awake and firing on all cylinders as his mind narrowed down like tunnel vision. Shit. He hadn't said that allowed, right? Cissy was going to slowly detach his arms and legs one by one before cruio-ing him into a coma. He lifted his head to stare at his son whose skin was a shockingly bleach white. There was a sort of stand still where father and son were locked in a staring contest; Lucius wasn't sure how much time passed but as he saw Dracos form sway backwards, his mind immediately locked down. Draco could smash his bloody head! He was not going to use a merlin-be-damned cushioning charm! There was no telling what else that would fuck up!
It had been terribly naive and it hadn't been until after his Lord had vanished did he realize his error. All the years he had worked closely with Voldemort and watched as he worked to help future generations through gaining control of the Ministry, it had obviously blinded him from the being that had took his Lord's place. He had became physically ill the morning of the first of November when he read the front page of the prophet. He had not attended the last meeting his Lord had called due to having to watch his son as Narcissa had fallen ill with wizarding flu for the past two weeks at Saint Mungo's and Lucius vehemently refused to allow a house-elf to care for his son any longer than an hour. He honestly had been lost on how his wife did it, because it took every fiber of his being to care for his son those days. He couldn't even use the Loo without the toddling blonde trying to follow him in!
Maybe he should have just spared this entire conversation and struck up a marriage contract for Draco to tie him to Potter. Damn he should have thought of that. There would have been a lot of yelling and complaining from both ends at the beginning, he was sure, but it would have eventually rolled around in Dracos brain that he might have a obsessive crush on the green-eyed boy. Potter liking his son back wasn't a question either. The handful of times he had seen them together was enough of a confirmation.
Despite popular belief, Lucius did not work well under pressure. His mind liked to focus on one task at a time, look at every possible outcome for that problem before he moved. And his mind was already working on the fuck up from over a decade ago, and the possible complications that it was proving now. That was a massive load on its own, not including the pile of paperwork that needed to be done weeks ago, and Lucius mouth never had much of a filter at home around family when he was deep in thought.
"No, Dragon, but I'm sure you will tell me." He signed his name down on the dotted line before folding the paper up to send off to the Ministry. He grabbed the next stack of papers, taking the moment to stretch his fingers out from the cramps that was starting to form.
"We're obviously not talking about Weasely, Draco! You're damn crush started years ago, and your mother said to let you work it out on your own, but I don't have the patience to wait until your peanut of a brain figures it out. I hate to break it to you, son. You're romatically fucking hopeless! So let your dad be the one to enlighten you, you've been lovestruck dumb with Potter since starting Hogwarts. Now that I have done more than my share as your father, please use your brain to solve why your constantly soaking in Potters business and hunting him down, and do something before I am forced to an early grave!"
...And that may have come off too strong, Lucius realized a little too late as he watched Draco's burst into the brightest red he had ever seen that traveled down his neck to his shirt collar. He was eerily still, Lucius couldn't even see him inhaling. There was no way that broke the teen. He only said to kiss Potter. Geez, Draco was grown enough to at least be able to talk about kissing without shutting down, right? When he had been that age, he already knew the whole nine yards...
He enjoyed the next decade raising his spoiled son before his 'Lord' returned as a wraith attached to Quirrell's head like some parasite; not that anyone had knew at the time. By the time news had reached the elder Malfoy, Quirrell was dead and his son had rambled on and on about the rumors floating about at school. The last few month's had been quite eventful and Lucius swore on his parents graves that he would have gray hair before the year was over. The next few years didn't prove to be any different as his Lord made increasing attempts at Harry Potter and failed. It came on suddenly that he was ensnared within Voldemorts grasp once again.
"...-and the Weasel! That arse! Acting like he is all high and mighty just because he managed to befriend the Boy-Who-Lived! Weasel's a nobody! What does Potter see in that daft twat?!"
He was a terrible father. Draco was retarded because of a cushioning charm! What the hell?! What'd it do? Repel feelings from impacting?!
Honestly, Lucius thought nothing could have brought him down. Murphy's law dug his claws deep into Lucius unsuspecting back in just a week after his son's birth in 1980. He hadn't known the domino effect it was going to have on his life when his Lord had stormed his mansion and demanded all of his followers to a meeting. His just and understanding leader seemed to undergo a revolting transformation just under two days after Severus reported a prophecy.
No, that couldn't be it. Lucius knew his son couldn't be a masochist in any dimension; the boy cried at the thought of needles, even as a teen. However, that didn't mean that he was completely clueless on his brats issue. You don't live as long as he had and be that blind to all the details that were aimed at him like blugders. Ironic considering he had years to talk himself into acceptice of the realization (which really only took the first few days once he realized there was no point in resisting) and Draco was still swimming around in dazed circles. Not like Lucius could shout it out in the ranting sessions his son sprung upon him because his wife was stern on letting Draco figure it out himself.
He fought a grimace as he looked down at his papers. Was his kid this way because of the 'incident' all those years ago? He mechanically signed another paper without looking, else he would have noticed his signature in blue ink spread across the paragraph, instead of beneath it. If he was being truthful, he tried not to think of the said Incident because his wife would skin him alive if she ever found out.
He hadn't truly given any real thought to what would happen when his Lord did find either of the boys. He figured at most the boys would be removed from Dumbledore's manipulating hands and cared for under Voldemort's careful watch. But reading the recent events he had missed, he didn't have the chance to make it to the Loo before his stomach was emptying itself across the floor of his son's bedroom where he had been resting as Draco went down for a nap. He hadn't responded immediately to Draco's sudden cries, his stomach releasing what little breakfast he had managed to snatch and his brain reeling in tight circles as it replayed the sentences morbidly across the backs of his eyelids. He didn't know what stunned him more; the fact that his Lord murdered the Potters and attempted it on a baby or his Lord had been 'killed' by said baby. It was so absurd that Lucius couldn't hold back the disbelieving laugh as his eyes watered at the sudden looming threat his stomach gave at the thought. A baby... just barely a month younger than his own little Dragon.
‘This’ being the fact he’d claimed Draco as his potions partner. Which mean sitting on the Slytherin side of the room
“Well that’d be awesome,” Harry perked up, because that was brilliant knowledge to have, for sure. And he reluctantly let the matter drop for now as he could see where the twins were coming from. What was with these Gryffindor’s and their surprising sense of morals?
Classes have ended, and Draco anxiously makes his way to the owlery. Apologizing has never been something he's good at. Even when he knows he's in the wrong, his pride stops him, reminds him that apologizing is not something a Malfoy should do. He feels bad, but that does nothing against the unprecedented hate he has for admitting he's wrong. He hypes himself up, bringing attention to the fact that if Harry reciprocates in the slightest, he might actually have a chance at being happy.
Dracos wailing, trying to keep himself quiet, closes his mouth and covers it with his hand. Consequently, he chokes on his tears, making his throat burn.
“I can't! I don't deserve his time anyway. I wish the nightmares and pain would stop. It's almost as if my own mind is mocking me.” His chest heaves with the deep breaths he's taking and he can't keep himself from shaking. “I've ruined everything Myrtle! All because I was a jealous lovestruck little boy whose only way to get his crush's attention was to make him feel horrible! Do you know how much I regret it? It eats me up from the inside. The horrible things I said to Granger? Then listening to her screams on my drawing-room floor, while the Weasly pounds on the wall. I've done unforgivable things..” Draco sobs. He bursts up from his position, instead taking to walking in a circle.
that causes outbursts? Harry already has outbursts! She thinks with raised brows. She searches for what bonding might demand. She expects the worst. From her knowledge of similar species, like werewolves, their bonding process is quite uncouth, containing unfathomable mess, destruction - even injuries!
“Well, I may have told him less than the basics before he blew up on me and ran away. I get it though, why would anyone listen to their previous tormentor?” Tears are sliding freely down his face now. Myrtle wishes dearly that she could wipe them away, but settles for resting her arm around him, almost a side hug.
bit shinier as the class rages on, Harry doesn't say anything. It's not until Harry’s attack sends Draco flying that everything's not fine. Harry runs to him with a startled shout.
“If you want privacy, the owlery, no one goes there in the morning or early evening. If you want aesthetics, the Garden or Astronomy tower.” She says the second bit dreamily, hinting for Draco to choose one of those options. Draco notices this, but chooses not to comment.
“I just wanted your attention.” Draco is trying to stay calm and push the butterflies down, but Harry scoffs and he can feel his resolve dwindling.
“Mm, I suppose so. I accept your apology, Potter,” Malfoy hums, softening his expression the tiniest of amounts. “Can I finally get to what's important?” Harry nods, registering the fact Malfoy didn't argue.
“Obviously not for you if he's your mate. It doesn't matter anyway, I suggest you just tell him. From what you've told me in the past, it always seems to be you starting the fights. Maybe he doesn't dislike you as much as you think.” Draco lets out a huff, deciding he'll make a plan during breakfast.
“I'm going after him. Somethings not right.” He says suspiciously, barely hearing Ron mutter something about him being an idiot before he's gone, falling into a fast stride to catch up with the blonde.
“Ill be defensive.” Draco says and lifts his wand. Harry huffs but decides not to dwell for too long. Forcing Malfoy into something definitely will not be the way he gets him to talk.
“Don't be frivolous, you know I'm on house arrest.” She says offhandedly, giving him a look as if to say “Stop with the formalities.” Draco nods.
Harry is his mate because he fell in love with him and the universe concluded they could help each other. In every way. But Draco just can't believe that. There's no possible way Harry could want or require anything from him. He's done just fine on his own. They both have. Haven't they? Draco shakes his head with heavy movements.
If you think somethings different about this chapter, it is. I tried writing in a published book type format, which ive found i absolutely love. i also edited what date he got a mate in the last chapter, for reasons.... im really excited about this project! I usually have a really hard time following through on stuff, but this story i havent had many troubles, besides taking a month to write the first chapter....oofers. I hope you enjoy :)
“Get out!” Myrtle screeches, flying in front of Malfoy. Harry jumps, yelling in shock. Malfoy just cries louder, Myrtles outburst obviously not helping.
“The nightmares-” He wraps his arms around himself and looks away. Pansy nods her head for him to continue.
“Yes, she lied. Whatever she told you was incorrect and you should go.” Harry makes no move to leave.
Something's not right about this, Harry can't seem to shake the thought. Ever since the Malfoys trial over the summer, he's been trying to remind himself that Malfoy never wanted to be a death eater and that he's changed since being a child, but it's incredibly easy to fall into old habits, he decides. Immediately after seeing the familiar bird-shaped paper fly in front of him, he snatched it and read quickly, showing Hermione and Ron.
"You're so frustrating!" Draco doesn't say anything to this and Harry sighs, tone softening. "Why haven't we met up?"
“I would like to make you aware of a certain situation I've been experiencing,” He says guiltily, trying not to fidget becoming arduous. Narcissa hums and Draco continues. “I'm sure you're aware of my being untruthful on the subject of mates. Well, I had the dream on my 18th birthday, and I've been having it every night since then, and horrible pains when I'm awake. They just started recently, I assume they are from consciously keeping myself away from my mate. I wanted to ask for a line of action.” Draco loosens up, finally becoming comfortable. He runs his hand through his hair and rests his chin on his fist.
“He apologized and everything was fine. I even tried messing around with him ‘Mione, I think he tried messing back, I couldn't really tell. Then he tells me he's  Veela and I'm his mate! Who just says that?” Ron interrupts, face scrunched in confusion. “Wasn't Fleur part Veela or something?” Harry groans, “I don't know Ron, unlike you I had other things to do than ogle Fleur,”
“Well, I don't believe you and i'm not going to sit here while my best friend wastes away in the remains of his pillow!” Her voice raises as she catches sight of the feathers Draco oh so carefully stuffed under his bed. “Why have you done that anyway?”
Ok, so, im failing most of my classes and anytime I draw or write I get really guilty that I'm not doing schoolwork, so I've just been playing video games, because that's definitely gonna solve my problems :) Im sorry if this chapter is shit. It was written over the course of a few months so my ideas are disjointed and the style is all over the place, but I didn't want you guys to think this is discontinued so I worked till 630 in the morning to finish it -_- Ive just realized this story will prob have a lot of plot holes because I've never been good at being organized, so try to look past it? hopefully the self indulgence indulges you as well. Anyway, sorry for venting my problems, Proceed~~~
Harry, Hermione, and Ron walk into the room just as the professorer begins to talk, explaining the task for the day.
“Oh, so you didn't study Veelas when I told you to?” She asks him playfully as he sputters. “Nevermind that. Draco, a mate is chosen because you've fallen in love with someone your heart deems perfect for you. It isn't random, your Veela blood doesn't make you love someone, you do that on your own. Your heart just tells you when you're right in giving that love. So, I am not disappointed in you for falling in love with someone that can give you what you need,” She smiles sweetly, wishing she could hug him in that moment. Her mood quickly shifts though, ready to reprimand him.
“I'm taking it didn't go well?” Ron asks, voice gruff. Hermione shoots him a quick glare before sitting down on a neighboring couch, patting the space next to her as Harry strides over, stomping loudly. He flops down, throwing his limbs across everything, including Hermione.
His eyes sting suddenly for the twentieth time that day and the ache in his shoulder from his bag is draining. He wants to cry, to drop to the floor, let all the people who glare at him in the hall stomp over him till there's nothing left. Maybe then the pain that takes multiple forms would subside. Maybe then the ache in his heart that accompanies the one in his shoulder would vanish, but alas, Malfoys do not cry and pain does not go away.
“I thought you hated me?” Harry seems almost pleading. If he thinks real hard, he realizes he's never really hated Harry. At first, it was just jealousy towards the reputation he had. Then, anger for rejecting his friendship so quick. Rejection. Their entire relationship had started with rejection, and could just as easily end with it too. After that, it was a slow decline to a want. Wanting the smile Harry had for his friends to be aimed his way. Wanting the unnoticed touches he gave his peers to be for him.
“M’spectacular.” Malfoy hums, but does not move, nhor does he open his eyes. That can't be good can it? So Harry leans forward, sliding his hands under Malfoysa head to look for a wound and hovers over his face. He can't feel anything out of the ordinary. As he pulls his hands away, Malfoy latches onto Harry's right hand with both of his, eyes still closed.
“And with that, I'm gonna go play some chess.” Ron exclaims with excitement, smile reaching his eyes.
They make eye contact and stare for a bit. Each waiting for the other to say something first. Harry's eyes finally waver and he says.
“How childish Potter.” Contrary to his tone, he holds out his pinky, looking away. How cute can Harry get? Holding out his pinky as if he's 6 years old again. It's embarrassing how quickly Draco will do something so stupid if Harry wants it. Their pinkies intertwine, and Draco gets nervous. Harry's pinky is warm and fits in the crook of his perfectly. He lets go of Harry quickly, embarrassed just touching his finger makes him happy.
“‘Mione,” He groans “ we can't possibly need this many books.” Ron watches as Hermione sets down part 1, 2, and 3 of “Creatures of the Unusual” by Selgy Aneme, astounded.
“She's right isn't she?” Harry asks with a groan, letting his head fall to the back of the couch. Ron shrugs.
Immediately when sitting down at the Slytherin table, Draco informs Pansy of the conversation he just had.
“I will meet him at the owlery so no one hears us. Also, if he decides to blow up on me, I won't have to deal with onlookers too.” Pansy cringes, disappointed, but knowing she won't change his mind.
“Marvelous. Long story short, I'm part Veela. I have a mate, but that only directly affects me,” Malfoy pauses. “You just so happen to be my mate.” Malfoy props his right elbow on his left arm, tucked into his chest, and examines his nails.
“So, in theory, you just need a cuddle buddy?” Harry suggests, tone rising along with his smile. Malfoys mouth falls agape, dumbfounded.
“Why didn't you come sooner? We could have talked about it? Maybe we could have come up with a plan.” She says sadly, knowing it couldt have ended well if he was about to cry.
“Obviously my Veela side.” He deceives. They're one in the same, really. But that hinges on the fact that Draco fell in love on his own, which he's concretely decided Harry will never know. Dracos headache grows more from the previous crying and it's almost impossible to see the room correctly.
“I had to go back in fucking time to stop an innocent creature from being killed,” Malfoy speaks up, “Wait, what-” Harry keeps going. “all because you wanted me to notice you? Malfoy, you're already the first person I look for going into rooms. You're the first person who comes to mind when I turn corners, hoping I don't run into you and get hexed. I always told myself, ‘Hey Harry, he's probably a royal arse because of the way he's raised, there's gotta be some logical explanation.’, but it's because you wanted my attention. Do you know how damn well fucked that is?” Harry swings his arms out, raising his brows. His hair goes frizzy and sticks up angrily.
“Course ‘Mione.” Ron replies looking to the left, away from her. He brings his arm up to scratch his neck. Hermione hums, not satisfied.
“Well first, you've got to tell him you're sorry, for like, everything. Then you have to ease him into a conversation about feelings, not necessarily romantic. Last, tell him what's been happenin. This is a strange situation and either way you have the disadvantage. Chances are you'll get rejected no matter what, all you can hope for is that he’ll at least be open-minded, then maybe you could worm your way into his heart.” She finishes with a long intake of breath, tired. Draco groans at his predicament. Especially since it's entirely his fault. He looks over towards the Gryffindor table, searching for a wild mane of black hair. He finds it and continues to talk to Pansy, still staring.
“That's it? I thought you would say Pansy, I know she's your best friend, but she's horrid. Anyone who's lived with you for any amount of time could've guessed that. My dragon,” Draco giggles, relieved. “You know how mates are chosen, don't you?” He shakes his head ashamedly.
“Well, I do, so - deal with it.” Harry says, far from graceful. With Malfoy pressed so close, Harry becomes self conscious. He shifts, uncomfortable. Gradually Malfoys tears stop until he's only left sniffling. Malfoy pulls himself back, only a few steps, blank faced, and makes eye contact with Harry. Malfoy's eyes are puffy and red, but he seems to ignore that fact, his hair falling from its perfectly set position on his head. Harrys never sees Malfoy so disheveled, his natural hair suits him more, Harry thinks. Seconds pass and no one talks, trying to avoid an awkward atmosphere Harry asks.
“You probably want to talk right?” Harry slides his hands down his robe pockets and rolls on his feet.
“I'm humoring you, don't want you running away again, do we?” Harry frowns and turns away, sticking his hand out nonetheless. They shake and Malfoy starts.
“Seriously Harry? You rant about him for 10 minutes in unfiltered hate then fall back into stalking? What kind of thriller novel do you think this is?” Hermione questions agitatedly.
“Did you really cut me off when I just said not to talk? And for what, Saint Potter?” Malfoy asks exasperatedly. He crosses his arm and taps his foot.
“Are you daft Potter? How much touch do you think nonverbal magic involves?” Harry drops onto his feet and doesn’t try to mention that it's not just touch he needs but his presence in general, which Malfoy said himself.
“Sorry... I'm apologizing for acting so rashly. Your words angered me and the only thing I could think of was wanting to be somewhere else. All I'm saying is I should've stayed to hear you out a little more.” Harry insisted with a shy shrug, glancing away. Myrtle, in the background, having observed the situation, determines that Harry is helping. Quiet as a ghost, Myrtle slips off and into her toilet.
“You've said sorry before. If you’re saying it again, you must haven't have meant it the first time. So, pinky promise you mean it?”
Harry walks after him, hugging the blonde from behind. Draco gives a start and looks back at the other. Before Draco can say anything Harrys already talking
“He may be justified in running away, but maybe if you told him how important it is to you, he'll listen?” She asks, grasping at any possible solution, anything to keep her Dray-Dray from crying.
“All right, that's much better than what I thought it was. I didn't read on it because it scared me. Mother, the only problem is, even if he is perfect for me, we’ve hated each other since first year.” He whines towards the end, but quickly stops when he realizes how childlike he sounds.
“Attention! You attack me in the bathrooms, call my friends names, get Buckbeak executed, go out of your way to ruin my life, to get my fucking attention?” Harry's breathing hard now. Malfoys eyes widen at Harry's reaction.
“Look, I know you won't be able to see past what I've done immediately, and I'm not asking you to forgive me. I just need physical contact with you in order to not go crazy. So could we please avoid a tantrum worthy of an Oscar?” Harry notices sweat on Malfoys forehead, and his eyes move constantly as he talks.
“Females are much more vicious than their male counterparts in this species you know, so the claw marks are a dead giveaway,” he chatted conversationally like they weren’t under a time crunch.
He didn’t even mention Longsgate or the Eileen Prince Foundation despite really wanting to know about them since if
Neville didn’t really react other than nodding slightly. He tilted his head a bit as he spoke again, in the same clam, even tone.
Before Harry could ask, Draco had snatched one of his hands up in his own, causing him to startle a bit. The blond didn’t really like touching people, he thought, so what was—
Pretending her boyfriend didn't leave her so readily, she peers down at the book, praying to all of Merlin it contains useful information. Contrary to popular belief, even she can get worn down by spending so much time searching for books. Sighing as she realizes Ron shut the book, she scans down the contents.
“And you Harry?” SHe switches, just about to walk into the Great hall. Harry doesn't hear her. He's quite preoccupied with watching Malfoy pause at the doors, then deciding against it, heading for the stairs. He stops walking for a second, looking after him. Suddenly he's elbowed in the ribs and he grabs his side in reflex.
“But I am disappointed in you for lying and hurting yourself even though you could've easily fixed the problem. I can't believe you think I would hate you for who you love, maybe your father would, but he's no Veela so he wouldn't understand, anyway.” She looks stern, and Draco’s surprised. Not ready for this lecture.
“Ow, What?” Harry's eyes widen and Ron Shrinks into the couch, avoiding the lecture bound to happen.
“Save your pity. The image on my arm is proof enough.” He says, edging his arm behind his back without noticing. Draco hangs his head low, closing his eyes.
“I don't know, at least I can touch him!” He says quick, “Not like that.” Harry mumbles to himself, the tiniest bit flustered. He strides over to Malfoy. Harry doesn't know what to do, he's never been the comforting type. Ginny always mentioned how shit he was at it when they were together. Hesitant, he hovers his hands over the other man's shoulders. Harry remembers back to when Malfoy mentioned he just needed him to touch him, he doesn't know if it will help in this situation but it's all he's got. Deciding to go big or go home, Harry pulls Malfoy into his chest and wraps his arms around him.
What was weird was that he'd been pretty sure they weren't muggleborns--not that he would reject them if they weren't, but it was curious as to why they were interested in a muggle game then. Well, power to them for broadening their horizons, even if just to watch a bit.
“Well I didn’t do anything—if I’d known there was a troll I wouldn’t have got cornered by the stupid thing. And also, I may be in Gryffindor but the hat thought long and hard about putting me in Slytherin so I’m not thrilled the Headmaster essentially told the teachers I’m an impulsive Gryff, like I only have a heart without a brain behind it. I mean it’s nice and all but he essentially called me thick, isn’t that what it sounds like?”
he was talking about since both seemed to press their lips a bit more in consideration. Killer poker faces of course, especially since they’d all been half thinking this was going to be the case for a week now. The surprising part though…
