Harry popped back up with a dirty old copy of "Advanced Potion Making", the ones they use (or at least used to use) at Hogwarts. "This is yours." He said holding out to Snape after reshrinking his trunk and placing it back on the chain.
"The funds will be transferred to where they can be further used."
Snape looked up from a book he was reading, "Yes, Mr Rogers?"
"Oh, thanks, sir." Bucky said, smiling at Snape.
Latin translations:
Merlin gasped. "Freya."
"If you had to choose between staying here with you or going with him which would you choose?"
Harry stopped mixing his potion and looked at Draco, "If we take over the ministry, we could post whatever we want on the Prophet. Rita Skeeter is as good as dead and we all know this Amerah Worogip guy is the new Rita Skeeter. He's young, a decent writer, plus, he's not half bad looking," Harry laughed at the way Draco's jaw clenched at Harry mentioning how good looking Worogip was, "But he's nothing compared to you. I only have eyes for you, Dray."
"Leo?"
"Yeah."
"Yeah."
"Only your husband would befriend the Once and Future King and Emrys."
"He speaks in all riddles and prophecies. He literally can't do anything else. It's like he wants us to hate him." Merlin whispered.
"And that's when all of you walked in." Tony finished.
The fight happened at an airport in Germany. Team Potter had shown up as well to stop the fighting but it didn't stop.
"You were a Gryffindor too, right?"
Harry completely forgot about the water he was grabbing and just came running down the hall into their room. When he saw Draco leaning against the chair, he ran over to him and helped him back onto the bed. He quickly sent a patronus to Severus saying that the baby was coming.
"Take off the gauntlet and give it to me."
"Well, there you go, warlock. Now what is it you needed me for?"
"If you're talking about his werewolf genes, no I didn't. Harry told me that when Dad went to him to ask him to be my godfather, he also said he was worried about passing on his werewolf-ness to me because he didn't want me to be treated differently because of it."
"Something... is... happening." Mantis said before she disintegrated into ashes.
"What? My school years something different. Everyone wanted to be with the Ice Prince of Slytherin and I was just bored." He explained.
"Arthur and Gwen? No. Gwen loves Lancelot."
Draco gripped onto Harry's hand tightly. "We're having a baby boy."
Harry broke out into a smile and went to pet the dog.
"Well, maybe if you weren't in jail for half your life
"Alright so. Morgana is rising. She came back the same way Merlin did. She's after what Merlin stole from her. She will show up soon and not alone. She has a dragon and Mordred. Harry's Patronus is the beast, a dragon. Her movement has begun. She'll show up on the solar eclipse. She got here the same day Merlin got here." Steve repeated.
"Vision..." Wanda whispered.
As soon as he signed, magic swept through the room. Hermione figured this was the magic trying to find out if Draco and Harry were a worthy couple.
"Help! Please!" The man next to the blonde man in the middle called out once he saw them entering. This one had strawberry blonde, shoulder length hair.
"Okay, we're ignoring the fact that your godson, husband and godfather died. When's the wedding? Can I come?" George asked.
"Oh! The Hulk! Doctor Banner, your transformation reminds me so much of an animagus or a werewolf transformation. You have to show me how you do it someday." Sirius smiled.
Teddy Lupin was ten years old and growing up with his grandmother instead of his parents. He knew what his parents died for, but he missed them everyday. Harry, being Teddy's godfather, visited whenever he could but never stayed for too long as he was reminded of Remus and Tonks and how he couldn't help them. Teddy asked for stories of his parents, Harry would try his best without crying but always ended up with tears down his cheeks.
"A Greek Titan? No thanks."
Harry stopped moving, his hands being tied behind his back, wand dropped on the floor.
"Can you help him?" The woman asked.
Then there was a conversation between the robot, who Harry learned was named Ultron, and the main six Avengers. Then Tony's Iron Legion broke through the walls and started attacking. Steve flipped a table over, Maria Hill started shooting, Thor started throwing around his hammer, Natasha also started shooting, one of the Legion almost killed Helen Cho, Clint threw Steve his shield, Harry stood with Sirius, back to back, and started firing spells around, Draco and Teddy did the same. One second Harry was freezing some of the robots and then Sirius hit them with a
"Yes, as in magic. Director Fury, you asked how we were able to show up ten years before Draco and I were born. That's because in 1970, my world was in the year 2053, I believe. It was hard to keep track in the woods."
"The woods?" Rogers asked.
When Nick Fury tested the blood, it led to a Harry James Potter, born July 31, 1980. How did his blood show up ten years earlier at the site of a SHIELD operation? Fury put two of his best agents on the case. Natasha Romanoff and Clint Barton.
Harry chuckled, "That's accurate. And also perfect."
"This way." Harry led him down the hallway towards the back of the house and opened a door which had some stairs leading downstairs.
She did not back down.
"What was it like before you... jumped through the Veil?" Arthur asked.
Once the runes were drawn, a couple on each corner of the room, he kneeled in the middle of the room, his charm still active so Thanos didn't notice him. He summoned all the Hallows.
"You being my uncle, Harry's godfather and Teddy's dad's ex is kinda weird, you do know that right."
"Right. That makes sense. If the Hallows are not housed in that bracelet anymore, but now in the circlet, the metal bracelet has no purpose. If anyone can just grab the circlet, anyone can Master the Hallows. But by shrinking it down to put it around his wrist again, it's only letting Harry access." Loki explained. "That shrunken circlet, is the new bracelet."
Harry nodded. "I love you so much, Draco. Even when everyone around us is dead, you'll always have me."
"The Prophet is owned by the Ministry, and the Ministry wants everyone to believe what they want." Harry mumbled as he focused on making a potion that he got from the Half-Blood Princes book. Draco had sneaked into Borgin and Brukes to get to the Vanishing Cabinet and managed to get the book along with some other items like trunks, spell books, potions books and the sort. Harry also went but to grab some books from Slytherin's library in the Chamber of Secrets.
"Fine." Snape and Sirius said at the same time.
"Still think I was a spoiled brat? They told me my parents were drunks who deserved what they got."
"It was back in the 40s. Ugh, if I can remember correctly, he said his name wasÂ Caelan Avery."
"It's possible. But that would be too much of a risk. For all you know, you could end up killing another half of the universe and ruin everything even more."
Teddy's hair settled on the blonde then he spoke, "You didn't tell me!"
That was odd. As far as he knew, according to legends, King Arthur only took his breakfast in his chamber.
The portrait was in one of the dark hallways of the dungeons that no one ever passes.
Tony stood at the front with Steve and Natasha.
That idea left her mind quickly. The child grew up with Draco Malfoy as a father, there was no doubt he would be in Slytherin, as all Malfoys were in Slytherin.
"How did you face this dragon?"
"I'm only here for Harry and Ted. I could care less about Halloween. It's just an excuse for kids to dress up and go out to get tons of candy." He replied, taking a sip of some scotch he found.
Steve sighed, "Only Merlin, Gwaine and Arthur," He said, seeing the other Knights protectiveness over Merlin. "Nat, Rhodey and Wanda, get on the Jet. The rest can stay here."
"No. I told Stark about a possible threat and he's looking for him too." He said putting the magazine on the side table. "But, based on what I knew about my cousin, I'm assuming there's something else you want to talk to me about. What's wrong Draco?"
"What're their names?" Merlin asked.
When Harry stepped out of the Veil, he was not expecting to come out of water. When he looked around he realized it was a lake. He cast a drying charm on himself once he was completely out of the water. From what Harry could see around him, he was in some sort of Medieval time period, so his jeans and t-shirt probably wouldn't be the best in this case. He transfigured his clothes into an emerald green tunic and some black trousers. On top of that, he summoned some chainmail and turned his Holly wand into a sword to make it less conspicuous. He stopped casting magic when he heard voices.
, do not call me Lucy. It's absolutely hideous."
Draco closed his eyes, taking a deep breath and cleared his mind. He called out from inside him and pulled on his magic. His magic was released into the air, Harry inhaling softly next to him. "Okay."
Chapter 14: Post-Infinity War/Pre-Endgame
"There's been magical activity in this house, Death Eater activity." Draco explained as they walked up to the house.
"I will. Don't worry."
Harry looked over to where he just came from and someone walked out.
"Oh! By the way! The strawberry spell, the one you could never get right. It's
"You went through all of that as a child?" Snape whispered.
A couple minutes later Draco finally came back with drinks for everyone. He passed them out, Natasha declining one, saying, "If they're all going to be drunk out of their minds, someone has to stay sober for the blackmail."
Harry looked down at his dragonhide armor. He sighed thinking about what the Avengers were about to do. They had to go travel to where Thanos and his army were located, to be in proximity with the infinity stones. When Thanos snapped, Harry was only a couple feet in front of him, meaning the Stones and the Hallows were essentially right next to each other. Now, to undo it, they had to be next to each other again.
Skips over some parts where there weren't many changes compared to AIW.
"I will. You can also come visit us, you know. You just have to give me a heads up first. Our Veil is on a different planet."
They all held hands, Teddy in the middle, as they passed through the Veil, not hearing the spell that hit Draco on his way through.
"Runes, of course. How else do you solve anything? Well. Take a piece of parchment. Write the following runes. TÄ«waz. RadiÅ. Ansuz. Kaunan. Kaunan. Hagalaz. Algiz. Then the full name of the person. Include titles."
Harry came over and kissed Draco's cheek. "You ready to leave?"
He could do things on his own, but that didn't stop Draco from treating him like glass. One day he just snapped and yelled that he was fine when everyone kept looking back at him. It stopped after that day.
"Ew," Sam threw a pillow at them, "Get a room."
"He... he's dead. Thanos killed Teddy."
"Alright, fine," Harry walked over to Draco and pulled out the Elder Wand. He had been working on controlling his power with the wand in the past years. Now, he didn't have the whispers in his ear all the time when using the wand, only when he was really, really emotional. "Let your magic out. Don't think about using your wand. Try to do it wandless."
"I feel attacked." Sirius mumbled.
"What is there to talk about? He killed my father." T'Challa said.
Sirius was gonna ask more but Tony burst down the door.
(See the end of the chapter for
Merlin nodded again, watching and Draco unwrapped his bandages to see how the scar was healing. Healing magic was really impressive. There was only a scar.
The four of them exited the Chamber. Neville split ways with the other three, going to the Great Hall while the others went to the floo in Neville's office.
" Then he saw her body sprawled out on the floor with green blood coming out of her head.
Merlin punched Arthur. "Maybe if I wasn't so busy saving your arse, I would have a chance to learn."
Harry, who was now also being followed by Tony and Steve, made his way to the living room. Sirius wet the towel in the kitchen then followed Harry to the living room. Harry used the wet towel to very gently clean his son from the blood he had on him. After that, he put the diaper on him then wrapped him in the clean blanket.
"Regulus?" Rogers asked.
Draco completely ignored them, "He'll be okay, right?"
"He and Harry have been through it. They were cast out from their home because of something that wasn't even true. Harry was almost killed every year from ages eleven to seventeen. Draco's father raised him to believe that because of blood purity he was above everyone else. Draco was forced to join the group of people supporting Harry's almost killer." Steve explained.
Merlin took Harry's hand and gently helped him up.
He needed to start reading the books and seeing what he could do to help. He may've only known the Potters for a bit less than two weeks, but he had a feeling the Avengers would need their help in the future.
"Alright."
(See the end of the chapter for
"He's gonna be such a heartthrob in the future." Scott said softly, but everyone heard it and started laughing.
"Whose?"
"Well, the circlet looks good on you. Makes you look powerful. And the gold eyes? They just complete the look."
Teddy came over.
"No, Harry. You're not dying on us. Not when you just got us back."
"I thought we already explained this. he's a Metamorphous. He can change his form at will." Harry said.
"He took her to Vormir. He came back with the Soul Stone... but she didn't." The lady said.
Draco was kneeling over an injured Sirius, a large gash on his chest.
"Sirius... you protected Regulus from your angry parents. He turned to the Dark, but in the end he always believed in the Light. He died trying to destroy the Horcruxes. Severus, you would protect your mother from your abusive father, even while you were only a child who was hurt. When he died, you felt relieved that your mother was finally safe from him. Teddy, everyone made fun of you at Hogwarts because of me and Draco. Your gran and others told you it was okay, it wasn't your fault, but you still felt you could've done something. Draco, your father told you you would be friends with me as a child. To try to lure me into the Dark side so Voldemort could kill me. Your mother, said you could be friends with me just to be friends. But I rejected your friendship, which made your father very mad. He would yell at you, he never hurt you, but you were always scared of him." Harry finally took a breath, his eyes closing. He collapsed in Draco's arms.
"Boom!" Quill said as the bomb exploded and caused Thanos to fall to his knees.
Merlin opened his eyes as soon as he entered. "Where am I?"
George spent the night watching old memories of when his whole family was together. It was nice. Like he was reliving those days. But, all while not leaving the comfort of his home.
He told them about meeting the Defense teacher of the year, Remus Lupin (who was also one of his dad's best friends), the Dementor attack on the train and hearing his mothers voice. He talked about Sirius Black and how he supposedly betrayed his family. He talked about Scabbers being Peter Pettigrew, who was alive, meaning that Sirius was innocent. He told them about the Time Turner and saving his godfather.
Severus walked up to Arthur and Merlin, pulling out his wand and muttering a spell when he got there. "That should stop the bleeding, it won't heal it, but it should help while we get him to Draco."
Once he finished, he stood up and pulled out two Energy Replenishing Potions. He drank one himself and gave the other to Barnes.
Baby Potter. Fluff. Calm before the storm chapter.
"Draco Lucius Malfoy! What would your mother think?"
"How are you still alive?"
"How did you take moving ultrasounds?" Clint asked while picking one up.
"Drop your sword." The first voice he had heard spoke. He assumed he was the sire the two other voiced had spoken of.
Then there was Peggy. Steve's best girl from back in the day. She finally passed away so he had to go to London to her funeral. Sam went with him and Natasha ended up showing up. Harry wanted to go but Steve told him to stay with Draco.
"Well, I guess, now we both know something about each other that no one else knows."
"And then the final battle happened. I somehow killed Voldemort and that was that."
The ex-professor completely ignored that comment and went back to his interrogation, "What do you do for a living?"
Harry could hear the sound of swords being unsheathed, Harry also unsheathed his sword and was ready for whoever came out from the trees that were surrounding the area.
"Well,
Merlin summoned a ball of light and looked at Harry.
Harry gripped Draco's arm.
Sirius scanned the room, eyes landing on Romanoff, "She's not another Weasley, right? Like she's not secretly Ginny Weasley in disguise, right?"
"During our run. Men can get pregnant in our world. I lost her after some French Aurors found us."
"Yes, ma'am," The agent left the room, talking to someone on a communicator.
"Oh, but, of course. She arrived on the same day the warlock arrived. My warning has been said. I must go. Proceed with caution, Master of Death."
"To wipe out half the universe. The Power stone was the first one he acquired from Xandar. Then the Space stone from the Tesseract which I gave him to stop him from killing Thor. The Time stone is being protected by the Sorcerer Supreme. No one knows where the Soul stone is being kept besides a few, I, of course, know where it is but I cannot tell you without risking your lives. The Reality stone is being kept on a planet called Knowhere where my brother and Odin had taken it after his whole ordeal with his girlfriend Jane. The Mind stone was in the scepter I had brought when I was being mind controlled by Thanos, but now is evidently in that man, robot, person's head."
Harry shook his head vehemently, "You need to stay with Scorpius. If I can't figure this out and I get stuck back over there, you need to take care of him."
"The one in the forest where they were caught by my Aurors, correct?"
"Young warlock, I see you have brought another warlock with you. I suppose you have no clue he is also a Dragonlord."
"But if the Infinity Stones are what's holding the living together, the Hallows are what's holding the dead together. They're opposites. Two sides of the same coin."
"My father had the cloak. He left it with Dumbledore who gave it to me my first year at Hogwarts. As for the wand, Draco unarmed Dumbledore, making him the Master of the Wand. Then after we were kidnapped to Malfoy Manor, I disarmed Draco to escape, making
Inside the Jet, Rhodey handed Natasha $20, Gwaine let out a chuckle before turning away and Steve awkwardly looked away.
Teddy frowned, "They died a month after I was born. Gran took care of me until she died the year I graduated."
"How did you get them?"
But no one listened.
"Essentially."
? You aren't Harry Potter. He would be at least 32 by now, in terms of this world."
In case you didn't know, there will be a sequel to this. It won't be posted for a bit, but if you'd like to get updated on when that'll be up, below this, there'll be a "Series this work belongs to... Part 1 of Et Inter". If you click on the Et Inter title, you can bookmark, subscribe or whatever you have to do and you'll be updated on when the sequel is out (or you can just subscribe/bookmark my account)!
"Great! Merlin, you'll be walking. Lord Black will use your horse."
"In legend, he dies six weeks after the Queen does. She had an affair with him during her marriage with Arthur.
Teddy nodded.
"Oh if you insist. He reached to his waistband and pulled out his Holly wand. He put his hands back up in the air then dropped the wand.
Draco took Merlin's shirt off of him and looked at the wound.
"And how'd you realize the first one was a death eater?" Tony asked, pulling up a holographic screen and started taking notes.
"C'mon. Our Boy Who Lived. Is he Worthy?" Clint teased.
Guinevere and Lancelot were matching.
"For?"
Harry felt his heart clench. "There's a dragon?"
"So, my favorite newcomers," Tony started, going to grab a box, he had hidden under the couch, "You've been here since... September? October? Since whenever and no one knows you exist. So," He said pulling out a packet of papers for each of them, "Congratulations, you're now real people in this world. I made middle and last names for you and you better like them 'cause I already made everything based on them!"
Wanda was mourning the loss of Vision when she turned to ashes.
"Trying to one up me, are you Potter?"
"Yeah, I think so."
Harry nodded and pulled Teddy to him as Draco held his wand up to protect them.
"Somewhere. I believe there is somewhere for me. Somewhere."
"How do we do that?"
"But then there's the other side. Witches and wizards who use magic for evil. Wizards that believe non pure blooded magic users should not exist. Dark Lord's that kill parents and infants. Dark Lord's that leave marks on children. People stereotyping a kind of people. Blood purists not knowing when to stop. Spells that can kill with two words. Ghosts possessing professors. Souls possessing little girls and hiding giant snakes. Hiding your true self in someone else's skin. Government officials using blood magic on students. Dark Lord's controlling 16 year old boys. Crazed maniacs killing innocent creatures."
When Tony called for an Avengers meeting with everyone, Draco didn't know what to expect. They were meeting in the Compound, of course. It was a giant meeting room, which was what they expected. There were 35 chairs at the table. Everyone who was dusted and those who survived were there. Nick Fury and Maria Hill were the other two people there. There was only one empty chair, which is where Harry would've sat if he wasn't in a coma.
"Who's she?" Natasha asked softly.
"No, Draco, I know I don't know much about you or your life, but I do know that you're nothing like your father. Harry wouldn't have chosen you if you were like him. I've been dead in our world for like 60 years apparently. I don't know what happened after I died, but I do know that you changed. You went from a prat to a less prat and someone who loves my godson. I think that's a real improvement from the boy you were before. And I'm sorry about your mother. I know we were never close or anything, but I'm sorry I couldn't help you."
- SVRCINA
First thing he did when he could finally do things on his own was take a shower. When he got out of the shower, he looked at his left arm in the mirror. Draco had told him it was scarred, but he didn't realize how bad it was. He looked like he got his arm slashed open in twenty different places, but a tiny bit better. It didn't hurt, meaning it was likely healed with magic. The more he looked at it, the more he realized it looked like Sectumsempra. He quickly put his shirt on after that.
"I'm so sorry, Ted. You know I want to stay with you but I ca â
"We have someone we'd like you to meet. He goes by many names, like Hadrian Black. But the one we all know him by... Harry Potter."
He looked at his wrist and saw the circlet that had been shrunken. He looked at it oddly. He focused on pulling out the Invisibility Cloak, not noticing that his eyes went gold when the Cloak showed up. He had half expected it not to work. He focused on putting it back and it went away. That was gonna take time to get used to.
Before he realized, 30 minutes went by and a squire knocked on his door.
"Hello, Harry James Potter." Draco said.
Romanoff pulled the gun out again while Barton left his bow and arrow down.
Harry smiled at Draco before he walked up to make his speech. He cast the Sonorous charm before he started, "Alright, so, um. I don't really know how I can top that," He chuckled a bit, "So, I'm gonna go completely off-script, sorry 'Mione, and just keep this hopefully somewhat short. I grew up with my Muggle relatives, my Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon, and cousin Dudley. I grew up treated like a house elf. I was forced to do the chores in the house, waking up terribly early to make breakfast and going to bed late after dinner had been cleaned up and the dishes were back in the cabinets. I slept in the cupboard under the stairs until I turned eleven when I first received my Hogwarts letter. Hogwarts was my home, since I couldn't really call the cupboard or Dudley's second room a home. I found out that the Wizarding world community knew more about me than I did. The Wizarding community treated me like a king, when I wasn't. I was only a boy who suddenly had the weight of a whole other world on his shoulders. People to this day thank me for what I did. But all I did was die. I reversed Voldemort's spell so it backfired upon himself. It was everyone else. It was Neville Longbottom, who killed Nagini, the last Horcrux. It was Ron Weasley who found the Gryffindor sword. It was Hermione Granger, who without we'd probably all died the second we stepped onto the '
"Make out with Mr Captain America."
"Where's Sirius?" Severus asked.
Tony stood in front of Harry. "I'm sorry I couldn't protect him. I tried. I tried to keep him safe. He did amazingly."
"Teddy, you cannot be serious."
Steve finally spoke up again, "Harry, Draco, Teddy, Severus and Sirius, call us if you need help. If we can do something to help, let us know."
"So that's why you seemed so depressed yesterday." Tony asked, looking away from the picture.
When the group made their way over, they did not expect to see a group of men in chainmail, a woman in a dress that was evident it was worn too much and another man who was barely conscious in the arms of the man in front.
Charlie spoke up, "You could ask Fleur. Or Mum, Ginny, Hermione, literally anyone."
"No. My father told me it was a useless holiday and my mother did what my father said."
The man looked up with wide eyes and abruptly stood up from this chair, grabbing his wand and pointing at the intruders.
"True. But I'll make sure they don't get themselves killed."
, if you'd been paying any attention whatsoever, you would've heard the water and footsteps. That says, person!"
Chapter 15: Endgame
"The surge happened in Southwestern England. This is the biggest surge we've seen ever. That may not say much, but in 1970, we thought Harry, Draco and Teddy arriving was the biggest surge."ï¿½ Steve said, briefing them on what they were about to do. "Do not attack until the travelers have been identified as hostile."
The epilogue is next then this story is over!
"There are too many guys in our giant family. The only girls are Wanda, Natasha and Pepper, they would kill us if we're having a baby and it's not a girl." Harry laughed a bit.
Draco nodded.
"Why... why didn't I just let the stupid snake kill me?"
Titanas exercitus occiditis = Titans army kill
Harry
Then Teddy decided to walk out of his place and whispered under his breath, "
Harry laughed and hugged him tightly.
"Yes, I did." Sirius said while stretching his arm out to Loki watching as the God hesitated before taking his hand and being pulled up by Sirius.
Sirius nodded in agreement.
"You just had to go get yourself killed, didn't you?" Harry mumbled.
He eventually turned the page to face her, sign at the bottom. "As Minister of Magic, you have the final say whether these two can be married without their presence."
" Harry said and watched as a small, blue wispy dragon was summoned from the top of his wand. At first, when he first noticed his Patronus had changed, he was sad about it, about losing the stag that represented his father. But now, he realizes that he moved to a different chapter in his life, one with Draco and was happy that it had changed, knowing his father would be proud of him for finding his love.
"Oh, my god. But we're all here. Who would Death Eaters take as a hostage? Who crossed the Veil?"
Harry sat down next to Draco, putting a and on his thigh, "Sweetie, we both know Ron hasn't been my friend since he betrayed our friendship. Therefore, him, Hermione and their not-so-tiny-anymore tiny children are not my friends."
Strange was sitting cross-legged while floating and jerking around. His eyes were closed and the green stone was glowing. When his eyes finally opened he seemed to stumble down, but luckily Pietro ran over just in time to catch him.
Everyone was shocked. Ron and Neville immediately tried to heal the cuts, yet none of the spells worked. Hannah, who had finished healing Draco had run over and cast the right spells along with McGonagall and Pomfrey who rushed over.
Draco smiled and closed the door behind them, going to sit on Sirius' bed after. "Do you have any news on our Death Eater?"
"You do realize that your husbands godfather and your godfather hated each other right?"
"Did he just say playroom?" Draco asked Steve.
"Get rid of the glamours."
"I didn't know you had a wife."
"Year six. The more Draco oriented year. Basically Draco's father, the Dark Lord's right hand man, forced Draco to join the Death Eaters, which are the bad guys. He was told to kill Albus Dumbledore, our headmaster. Snape was now our Defense teacher and Horace Slughorn was our potions teacher. I found a potions book, the Half-Blood Prince's book. I excelled at potions that year because of the book. Draco kept hexing students discreetly as a part of his plan to get to Dumbledore. Then the end of the year, Dumbledore told me about Horcruxes. That's what was keeping Voldy alive. A Horcrux is a part of our soul that is placed in an object that will grant you immortality until the Horcrux is destroyed. Me and Dumbledore went on a mission to find the third Horcrux. The first was the diary that was controlling Ginny in second year. I destroyed it without knowing what it was. The second was a ring that Dumbledore and Snape destroyed. The one we went to find was a fake placed by Regulus Black, Sirius' younger brother who was once a follower of Voldemort who switched sides and was looking for the Horcuxes. I'm pretty sure he died trying to find them. Dumbledore died at the hand of Snape. Only because Draco couldn't do it and Narcissa, Draco's mother, may she rest in peace, and Snape made an Unbreakable Vow, which is exactly what it sounds like, to protect Draco. Oh! And Snape was the Half-Blood Prince who was also in love with my mother.
4. Carol and Val will make more of an appearance in the next chapter.
"If only Gaius was here."ï¿½ Leon mumbled.
A couple minutes later, the three of them were back.
In the room with Draco was another blonde. His hair did seem bleached, as his roots were a dark brown color. He also had gray eyes. If one didn't know them, they could pass as siblings.
Harry looked up confused, "Where are you going?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Not for long, of course.
"Black, don't fool yourself. You'd probably encourage the illegal-ness." Natasha deadpanned.
"It's not my fault the Weasley boy found us. But,
"My godson is having a kid?" Sirius asked, leaning forward in his seat.
"Is that why I have a constant headache?"
"Why do you think I did something?"
"Where's Arthur?"
When the group finally arrived at Camelot, Harry was amazed at the giant castle. The more he looked at it, the more it reminded him of Hogwarts.
Tony stood up, "Besides the fact that you didn't tell us for almost a month, let's get to work. FRIDAY, bring up a board. Potter, tell us everything the Cailleach and Mordred said."
Harry laughed. "No, that's Agent Romanoff. From our world, it's only us four, as far as I know."
Harry found he rather liked the Arthurians. He was especially fond of Percival. He didn't know why, he just reminded him of Cedric. They all reminded him of someone from his past. Guinevere reminded him of Ginny, Elyan of Ron, Lancelot of Neville, Leon of Remus, Gwaine of Fred and George, Arthur of Draco and Merlin of... himself. But when Merlin spoke of Morgana and Mordred, Mordred also reminded him of Draco and Morgana of Tom Riddle. It was something Harry didn't want to think of.
The lights turned back on and the door opened.
"The fuck is that?"
"If a wizard had a Muggle soulmate, how would they know they were their soulmate? The Muggle obviously can't produce a Patronus."
"He's magically exhausted. He wouldn't be like this if he wasn't." Harry mumbled mainly to himself but also to Sirius.
When they arrived, the goblin, who George learned was named Trielk, asked for three more drops of blood. George did as he was told and the vault opened.
When she found the book, she picked it out. It had a plain black cover, but it had elegant gold designs swirling the border. In a simple gold font stood the title. It was a rather big book. It had Merlin's full life in it, of course it was going to be big.
He snuck into the training room when he thought no one was paying attention. He changed into some sweats and a t-shirt. He didn't want to go all out and put on his armor, so sweats it was.
He flipped to the back and started writing, but said it out loud so everyone could hear.
Draco sighed and walked over to the photo. "That's our daughter. Men can have children in our world. I lost her sometime in May of 2034. She was supposed to be born on October 31st of 2034. Her name was Carina Lily Potter."
"You start then." Natasha said.
He turned around and saw Teddy standing there.
"You calm down, Padfoot, you're not the one who's been here for 45 years." Harry said.
Draco thought for a second. "Yes to our people. But I don't know if I want to tell the Avengers yet. Plus there's those new guys that will probably pass out once they hear me, a guy, is pregnant."
"Who are you?" Steve spoke in his loud Captain America voice.
"Shouldn't you be going then? The Headmaster is always at dinner." Harry said.
He hadn't figured it out until one day on an Auror mission when he got hit with the Killing Curse, but didn't die. When he went to check where the Elder Wand was, he found it wasn't in Dumbledore's grave like it should've been. Then he realized he had it on him the whole time, wearing it as a bracelet. He had all the Hallows on him at all times. And he couldn't take the metal bracelet off. He should've realized it earlier but it never occurred to him that the bracelet he had been wearing the whole time, not able to take off, was holding the three Hallows.
"Potters, can you hear me?" Tony spoke into the comm, "Outside the giant hole is the Cailleach, she's the one that can close it."
"We can apparate away," Harry suggested, but was automatically shut down by Draco.
"Clint said to take him to you so you could bring him back."
"What did you tell him?"
"George?" Neville called out once he heard the floo. He knew what was happening but just couldn't believe it. Harry was dead. There was no way he would show up now to harvest a basilisk.
are."
"Who does Draco help?"
"I was one year old when my parents died. I was one year old when I had to live with the Dursley's and do everything for them."
"I'll go investigate." Teddy said, who had been apparently listening the whole time. "Cover me."
"No. It's just like a hint of gold."
The two made their way towards the kitchen, smiling softly at the playful banter going on between the team.
"So you are like Loki." That's when Romanoff pulled the trigger and shot him over the heart.
When the quartet made it to the basilisk, Harry was shocked as to how well preserved it was.
"Why're you here so early?" Draco asked while turning to look at Teddy who was staring between them.
They both nodded.
"Thanks, Sirius."
"I told you. You messed with something you didn't understand, and now look. Everyone is back. Your so called balanced universe is back to being unbalanced. But, the balance between life and death is restored. You can't mess with things you do not understand! You know where that gets you? Six feet under!" Harry laughed, âI think you forgot one thing, Titan."
All in all, it was a great birthday.
This took ages to post, and I apologize for that. I had originally planned to post this, like I said, near the end of May, but I ended up not posting it because I didn't like how I wrote it. I ended up rewriting the whole chapter again. Then, I didn't like a scene I included so I changed it to something else.
"Yes, sir." Came the reply.
"Yes, Padfoot. I know they did that. They thought it led to death which is why no one, that we know of, followed us. No wands were thrown in either, so if this man is from our world, he doesn't have a wand. But that doesn't necessarily mean he's powerless. He could be a really good wandless user."
"Yeah, but..." Harry looked down at Scorpius.
"Not quite."
This time when they passed Harry's room, there was a kid in there. He didn't look older than 17. He had brunette hair and brown eyes. He looked out of place compared to the adults in the Compound. He seemed to be working on something seeing as he had books sprawled all over the floor and was taking notes on a notebook. He was whispering to himself. Arthur picked up a couple words, "Coma... bracelet... Mr. Stark... snap... powerful..."
Some heads up before we start:
"I... I know what to do." He whispered, "But first, I need to see Scorpius."
17- Post-Endgame
"You were stabbed by a sword forged in dragons breath. Arthur, the Knights and Guinevere took you to the Lake of Avalon and you just disappeared? Where did you go?"
Once they were up in the lab, Bucky looked up from watching Tony fix his arm. "Hi, Stevie."
Once she was seated in an office with Griphook, she began speaking. "Harry Potter fell through the Veil, but he is alive. He married Draco Malfoy. I always denied their relationship, never accepting it. But, as new information came to light, I wish, if it possible, for them to have a legal marriage in the Wizarding World."
"Hello?"
"Tonks and who?"
"Family?"
"First of all, his name is Sirius. Second of all, he's Harry's godfather. Third of all, he was portal hopping the Veil and ended up here with us."
Harry waved his hand quickly and the gun in the spy's hand was in his, the bow and arrow was across the room and the other weapons the spies had on them were traded for small, little, toy guns.
"We're going to need to spend sometime rewording what the Cailleach said. She was very... Shakespeare."
"You're leaving me? I don't care if you hurt someone, I don't want you to leave me. My parents already left me, now my godfather and my cousin are gonna leave me?" Teddy frowned, tears already forming in his eyes.
"It's my destiny to protect you, Arthur. Always has been."
Once Pepper let go of Tony, he walked over to Harry who was still holding Pietro. Pietro reluctantly pulled away from the hug and looked around.
Gwaine nodded and leaned against the wall, "He's my best friend. I can't lose him."
"Mr Merlin?" Hermione whispered.
"Excuse me, but... does your friend often
He stood next to Teddy, Elder wand pointed at the door. Draco leaned against the wall with Banner next to him. He didn't even bother asking who it was. He was familiar with the Doctor's work. At the moment, he just needed to rest a bit. Coming back to life really takes the life out of you.
"You should know all about patronus' changing because you love someone, wouldn't you, sir?"
The others didn't manage to lift it.
"Your husband? That's allowed?" Merlin gasped.
"Actually there have been cases of people having the same animal but they each have their own soulmate. Um, in Poland in 1638, there was a reported case of this couple who had found another person with the same Patronus but they had nothing to do with them. They even did an inheritance test, only the couple were soulmates, the other person had their own soulmate in the world, I think it ended up being a Muggle." Harry said.
"Kilgarrah. The last dragon. Uther killed the others." Merlin explained. "Have you ever encountered a dragon?"
Arthur spoke, "How long has Harry been unconscious?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yes, sir. Born and raised in England."
"Why was Draco an asshole? Why did it matter if you were a Pureblood, half-blood or Muggleborn? What is Quidditch?"
Merlin decided he needed to talk to him about that. He sat him down and stared at him.
The lady held out her hand to him and he took it. The next thing he knew, he was traveling through the worlds again.
"Her name is Morgan. We were going to bring her over to meet everyone earlier, but we didn't." Pepper said.
Lord Draco Lucius Malfoy.
"To Harry Potter, of course. Except, Harry Potter was... slightly out of commission at the moment."
Steve slowly made his way to Harry, smiling widely. "I thought it was only going to be Teddy, Severus and Sirius?"
Sirius elbowed him before he went back to his comfortable position cuddling up to his boyfriend.
In all honesty, the circlet looked like it would belong to a king. There were three main bands braided around the whole thing. The middle was the most impressive part. The stone was placed where there were more of the bands sticking out and connecting to the main band. At the top of the stone were two parts which were made to look like horns, like something Loki would wear. It was honestly a thing that people wouldâve fought over if it wasnât a death symbol.
"Hurry!"
"I don't care if I'm crap at potions, I'm gonna have you to make the potions for the rest of eternity."
"Yes. When I was fourteen. It was a Hungarian Horntail."
"That's because we made it," Draco said before whispering the spell, "
"About eleven weeks." Draco answered.
His eyes shone gold again.
When the guard at the door introduced him, he noticed that the Knights of the Round Table, Arthur, Guinevere, Gaius and Merlin were sitting at the table. That was odd. Normally, Merlin was the one serving the food, not eating it. And Guinevere, seeing as she wasn't married to Arthur, shouldn't have been sitting at the table.
Severus pulled out a couple jars full of basilisk venom, scales and bones.
"Teddy? As in former headmaster Teddy? As in your godson Teddy?" Charlie asked.
The lights went out.
"It's all for you, my love." He whispered.
Harry spent whatever time he could with Merlin. Merlin had noticed his new sensory overload and offered to help him with it. Peter also wanted to help, seeing as he went through the same thing years before.
Tony and Quill (whose name was also Peter, so now they had three Peters!) were arguing until Teddy finally spoke up.
Natasha looked at him then back at Merlin, "The wound started bleeding again."
"Could you help my daddy? Peter said you're really powerful and I want my daddy back."
It went silent. Loki smirked then disappeared.
Natasha said their names wereÂ Proxima Midnight and Cull Obsidian. They apparently had run into them during their mission earlier that day.
He handed over the journal to Loki (who swore he would respond right after Harry wrote in it) and stepped through.
. So when I went to face Voldemort, the Snitch opened. It was the Resurrection Stone. So Voldemort shot me with the Killing Curse and I died. Technically. I came back, of course. Narcissa was in charge of checking if I was alive or not. She felt me breathing or something and asked me if Draco was alive. I nodded and she lied to Voldemort by saying I was dead to protect her and her son. Hagrid took me back to Hogwarts while being dragged by the Death Eaters. Neville destroyed the snake Nagini, who was another Horcrux using the sword. I jumped down out of Hagrid's arms, Draco tossed me his wand and the battle began. I ended up killing Voldemort. But his people killed so many of ours. Fred Weasley, Ron's older brother died, causing his twin George so much pain. Remus Lupin and Nymphadora Tonks died, Teddy's parents. Colin Creevey who was just a boy who wanted to fight for his school and friends died. Lavender Brown, Ron's ex, died.
"Well, we have six months to get ready for this. I think in the meantime, we get some rest, reconvene at a later date and discuss what Morgana could be up to between now and then." Steve said.
When Harry found out that George had written back, he freaked out. He almost started crying (it took Draco ten minutes to calm him down).
A week later, Merlin was back on his feet. Tony had insisted on buying him a new outfit, but Merlin said no. Tony bought him a whole closet anyway. He bought all of them new closets.
"So, Severus," Natasha started, gaining the attention of everyone else, "I hear you and Sirius still aren't talking."
At that, Teddy pouted and crossed his arms over his chest, "I'm not a child! I'm a big boy who's going to Hogwarts next year!"
"I apologize. If we can get Merlin to our Jet, we can get him back to Draco in about an hour and we can see what he can do to help him. In the meantime, I'm sure Severus could stop the bleeding so he doesn't bleed out."
Teddy leaned to Harry, "Do you think it's Sirius?"
"Gaius! That means there're other dragons out there!"
"Him and his friends, two of them who happen to be their fathers," Snape started, jerking his head at Teddy and Harry, "Bullied me in school."
. To conjure a Patronus, you need to focus on your happiest memory and use that as a focus for your magic."
"So, now you're threatenâ wait. You love me?"
"Hadrian!" Gwaine exclaimed. "Come, take a seat next to me!"
"Sounds intriguing. But... it sounds like the Dreamless Sleep potion. You try it once, it's nice and amazing. But then you want more and more and more. You get addicted. It's not easy getting over an addiction."
Last chapter!
Severus got there as quick as possible with Sirius standing behind him. Sirius saw what was going on and left the room to call Tony, who was most likely to be up at four in the morning.
When was outside, he was just expecting to see Sirius, Steve, Tony, maybe Natasha or Pietro. He definitely was not expecting to see all the Avengers. The first one to notice Harry leave the room was Sirius. Once he stood up, everyone else looked up and also stood up. Sirius walked up to him and looked at the baby.
"Let me out."
Rhodey, Sam and the twins looked so lost at that point.
Anyone else, had shown up after Tony gave out the pajamas and didn't know about the matching.
"Don't know. It's all you have in the kitchen." Draco shrugged, grabbing one of the to-go menus they had stored in a drawer.
Georgie
Draco came back and handed the potion to Harry who used his wand to add the blood required and pulled on the soul in his bracelet. Seconds later, Teddy's shot open, his hair and eyes switching colors in rainbow order before deciding on blue hair and green eyes.
him and then use
Charlie flipped to the next page. It was dated two days after the last one, but this one had different handwriting.
"You think there really could be Death Eaters here?"
Sirius stood up, gently letting Scorp on the floor and getting up, "I'll go."
"How'd you bring him back?" Wanda asked.
"We don't know. They got on the ship then left Earth's atmosphere."
Then Steve, Natasha, Bucky and Sam walked in in full gear just having come back from a mission.
"I am the Master of Death. Death listens to me, and me alone. You can do nothing that I cannot fix. I am immortal, while you will die. I can kill you with a snap of my fingers if I'd like. And wouldn't that be ironic?"
"Right. Of course. And my family?"
"You think you can bring everyone back using the Hallows?"
He sat up, despite the pain he felt throughout his body.
Thanos fell to the ground and groaned in pain. Tony used this chance to start pulling off the gauntlet. Thanos still had the control so he activated the power stone and knocked Teddy back by stabbing him with a shard of debris and the raw power of the stone, releasing his hold over him. Teddy just shuddered on the floor, not being able to get back up or even open his eyes. He had a wound on his abdomen. He was bleeding out. And with no Draco or Harry around, he was going to die. He just knew it.
"Before I defeated the Dark Lord Voldemort, I had to die because I had a piece of Voldemort's soul in my body and the only way for him to actually die, all his soul pieces needed to be destroyed. I used the Resurrection Stone to come back but by using it, I became it's master. It's one of the Deathly Hallows. I had the wand since I disarmed Draco who disarmed Dumbledore, the school headmaster, who was also it's previous owner. I got the cloak after my first semester at Hogwarts. Dumbledore sent it to me for Christmas, my dad had left it to me. I became the Master of Death, meaning I can't die."
"He really loved him?" Hermione whispered.
After Loki inconspicuously killed the chitauri at the door, they entered. The team split up, Natasha, Nebula, Valkyrie, Okoye and Carol Danvers (who made her appearance on Earth a couple months after the Snap. It was a bit surprising to see a floating blonde outside the Compound, but they got over it eventually) went one way. Thor, Rocket, Steve, Rhodey and Bruce went another way, while Harry, Loki, Severus, Tony and Pietro made their way to what they thought was the throne room (which is where they assumed is where Thanos would be).
"Oh, I so agree." Draco commented, getting up and making his way around the bar the normal way. "And you're all lucky I know how to make a semi-decent Firewhiskey here."
Draco was standing off to the side. "I was wondering if you would actually follow me." He chuckled then started walking towards a library.
He pulled a couple hairs from Hewion while Draco took from Syiltal. They put the hairs in their vials of the potion and quickly changed clothes with the men. They kept their personal clothes in their trunks and hid those in the pockets of the new clothes.
people dying. It's one of the reasons I wanted to be an Aurorâer, Knight? Guard? Officer? I don't know how to explain it. But, I wanted to become one because I wanted to do as much as I could to stop the deaths. But death is inevitable. After a while I just got used to that nagging feeling. I guess I just have to get used to it again."
"Aries?"
Sam booed, causing everyone else to laugh.
"Them we better keep 'em in front of us." Steve said.
"Sweetie, we have to wait for them to be weak. With Hermione as Minister, they're never gonna be weak unless she and Ron have another child which is pretty doubtful considering they're 71 years old. We just have to wait until she retires. It'll be fine. We'll be fine."
"Right. Forgot about that." George said before walking towards the exit.
He told them everything. He started by telling them about how he lived with his Aunt, Uncle and cousin. He told them about living under the cupboard and being called a freak.
When he finally came back up, Harry was waiting for him. He was on his phone just playing a game when he looked up and saw Snape. "Hey. You found anything interesting?"
Chapter 17: Epilogue
"Six weeks, almost seven." Draco whispered.
"Draco, love, you need to stop reading the Prophet. It's not gonna help."
Harry smiled when he saw his son. It had been a rough couple years but he had accepted a while ago that maybe they weren't gonna come back and decided to get better for his son. It was a bit hard at points but he was finally in a good place mentally and decided to take advantage of that by spending more time with his son.
"Psh. That was in the past. Plus, both our godfathers were slash are technically dead."
"Merlin." The woman smiled. "It has been a while." She said before turning to Harry, "It is time for you to leave."
Tony watched Pietro cry onto Teddy's limp body.
Once Merlin and Harry entered, Harry started looking around and was amazed at the fact that it reminded him of the potions lab they had at home.
"Right, well, I should head back. I have a school to run," Teddy said, breaking the tension between the other two men.
Harry smiled, "Remus. Moony."
"That's true." Harry laughed. "Let's tell them once we're back at home." Harry kissed him softly. "Are you ready to go back out there?"
He heard Gwaine gasp as he passed the room but Arthur was too busy setting Merlin on the bed in the room next door.
"Who are
"Did Potter agree to this?"
All of the Avengers seemed to be fussing over Draco whenever they saw him. Harry was getting to the point where he wouldn't leave him alone because he (not that he'd admit it) was scared of what could happen. He didn't want what happened to Carina happen to their baby. He was going on less missions with the Avengers, not that they needed they help, and chose to stay with his family. Even Severus was being nicer to him (they were on a first name basis now!).
"Tell me they're lying." He yelled angrily, "ASSHOLE! Tell me you didn't do it!"
"Carina Lily Potter. Named after a constellation to carry on the Black tradition and after Harry's mother."
"Great!" He said outloud before turning back to the floos, "You first." He mumbled.
Once the Aurors left, Draco dropped to the floor, ripping his shirt off. Harry dropped onto his knees next to him, cleaning up the blood with Draco's abandoned shirt in an attempt to try to find the source of the bleeding.
"We have to leave!" Draco yelled, already running to the other side of the entrance to get ready to attack whoever was coming.
"Let him rest. He'll get used to it. It's like... learning how to ride a bicycle. It's hard at first, but the more you do it, the easier it gets."
"Alright, sorry! I just didn't know how to react!" He held his hands up in surrender. "Now you were saying? About the War?"
Loki teleported away and back in two second, now holding Severus who was still holding Scorpius.
They got in the car and drove to an ice cream shop that Harry knew didn't close after the Snap.
"Thank you, Harry."
Harry nodded and chopped up some more, slowly adding, mixing and seeing if the color changed before adding more if needed. "I dunno. I like my job but maybe this could be what's missing from it. He said I'd go on cases outside of New York occasionally, so I dunno. It might be too much time away from you and Ted. From being an Auror all those years ago, I wasn't able to see Granger, the Weasleys and Teddy that much. I just don't know if I wanna risk doing that again."
A small future hint: The (very) possible sequel for this story will include Merlin and Arthur (and maybe the Knights, haven't decided yet). The end is just the beginning, is it not?
"Hello, everyone. I'm Wanda, as you probably all know. Just here to announce that the gender reveal is going to happen in a couple minutes! Make your final guesses on the chalkboard over there and with name suggestions!" Wanda's voice was projected over the big ("It's not that big. We could've gone bigger." Tony had said) venue that was filled by family and friends. Her voice had been amplified due to the Sonorus charm Sirius had cast on her seconds before. There was a chalkboard leaning on one of the walls. It was split down the middle, pink on the right, indicating a girl, and blue on the left, indicating a boy. So far, the boys side had 11 votes and the girls had 13. Some of the boys names were Anthony, Jasper, Daegan, Galen, Killian and Elliot. Some of the girls names were Antionette, Saige, Kora, Rayna, Emilie, Aurelia and Blair. Draco really liked some of them, but he still had his top list at home.
"Everyone hold onto me. We're going to Apparate. It feels really gross, but don't worry. It's normal. Any technology shouldn't be affected, so you should all be fine."
"Right. Play some pool. I'll be right back."
"So you need them in Azkaban?"
"Well, no. I did most of it, but Draco helped me at first when I still wasn't confident in potions."
"What about him?" Harry asked as his eyes narrowed. One thing was to ask about him and another was asking about his loved one.
"Harry, are you alright?" The god spoke into the comm system.
"Yeah, we need to talk about that." Harry crossed his arms. "You shot my husband with the Killing Curse, Sirius!"
"Is something wrong, Teddy?" Draco asked.
DÃ¨an lasair a nÃ¬ cron = make a flame that harms
Sirius did as he was told and watched as the bleeding stopped for a good minute before it started again.
Draco smiled sadly but nodded, placing a hand on his stomach, "We were so happy. For once, there was some light at the end of the tunnel. Since I was a Healer, I knew the spells to check up on the baby, check its gender, everything. I taught them to Harry since it's a bit awkward doing them on yourself. We were going to have a baby girl. We picked a name, Carina Lily Potter. She was going to be born on October 31st, because you know how fate loves us like that. But, obviously, we lost her. We ran into some French Aurors and they shot the Killing Curse at us. We both died. Since I have a Horcrux, I was brought back but our baby girl was gone. I thought it was my fault. I was so set on finally having a family that I didn't think about what could happen. We were both depressed for a long time, but never tried again for a child."
"Another?" Merlin questioned.
Then out of nowhere, a blue misty wolf appeared. It spoke with the voice of Teddy, "
Quod sit unire = to unite
Harry laughed, "Well it wasn't really legal until we got here, but we got married in this beautiful flower field. I was wearing white, we was wearing black. For the rings, I had a plain gold band and he a silver band, but the engagement rings are beautiful." Harry smiled and showed Sirius the silver ring with an emerald. "Draco keeps his on a chain since he works at a hospital and the stone would cut through the gloves. But, its a gold band with a silver topaz. I'm sure he'll show you."
"There's a reason we aren't talking." Sirius mumbled.
"Draco was a healer. He knows more about these spells than we do."
"Wouldn't have it any other way Sev."
The more Teddy looked, the more he noticed. They were all worn out, leaning on each other. He could also tell from the man carrying the unconscious man, that the unconscious one was bleeding profusely.
Harry smiled as he fell down to the ground, actively bleeding out.
Harry smiled at his husband, "Alright. I'll be there in a second. I'm just gonna go talk to Teddy about something really quickly."
Gwaine seemingly perked up at the mention of alcohol. Tony noticed and laughed, coming over to pat his back, "I think we'll get along nicely." He turned to Draco, "Your finest, m'lady."
She got to reading.
Harry searched his brain, trying to find out why that happened and later found out that Hermione ordered the marriage contract which had put into place the bond once it was accepted by the magic.
"Don't do that... Don't give me hope."
"Let me think about it. You can call me in 24 hours, assuming you won't lose my number in those 24 hours. Where would I work?"
Lancelot cleared his throat. "I think that's lovely. Everyone should be able to love whomever they want."
"You have not been my best friend in so long, Potter. Where's Malfoy?" She growled, casting a spell that she thought Harry wouldn't see. It was a spell that alerted security.
Harry laughed a bit, "I'm gonna wait for Draco for that part."
"Wait. So you could be richer than me?" Stark gasped.
Snape smiled fakely and nodded. "I can try. After not really using Legilimency in a while, it might be slightly difficult, but I am still the best Legilimens in the Wizarding World. Now if Mr Stark would just stop working on your arm, we can get started."
"When I was 15 I found out there was a prophecy about me defeating a Dark Lord. I, of course, defeated the Dark Lord when I was 17."
"Sure... Whatever you say..." Tony walked away, talking to a smart watch he had on his wrist, "FRIDAY, make the walls a baby green, but a nice green, and order lion, eagle, snake and badger toys. Max of five each. Put them in the playroom."
Draco dropped the silencing charm as the burst through the door. The two wizards had their wands in front of them with curses on the tips of their tongues.
FRIDAY announced his return to everyone at the Compound. Natasha and Steve were the first to show up, then Thor, then Severus, Pietro and Scorpius.
Right as Tony was gonna tell him to go again, there was a loud ringing noise.
Reading that made Hermione spit out the tea she was drinking. No way in hell would Sirius Black and Severus Snape ever date!
They had all gotten a considerable amount of gifts, seeing as there were a lot of inhabitants in the Compound. But, in Harry's opinion, Tony's present to the Arthurians was the best. He had saved it for last, of course.
"What's Parseltongue?" Bruce asked.
She had been too selfish to think that Harry would do something like what he did for no reason. No, all those years ago, on the 10th anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts, it wasn't him rebelling or going against the Ministry, it was him protecting his love. He loved Draco, even before the attack. How had she never noticed? She was supposed to be the brightest witch of her generation and she didn't notice her best friend was in love with Draco.
"With no runes, the Veil would take a person wherever fate thought they were needed. If a soldier were to go through with no location, fate would take them to a war where they could help. There is no way to track which universe one landed in, but you can track where, when, whether they were are alive, how many years have passed for them, what they are doing currently, their current family and their marital status."
When Draco went to get up to go to the bathroom he felt a sudden burst of his magic. He had to grab onto the chair Harry normally sits on to make sure he didn't fall. Severus had told him that with male pregnancies, their water doesn't break, they only feel something (what they felt wasn't described in any of the books) and they would instantly know that their baby was coming.
from here, but I ditched a long time ago and went to Earth-616."
"Harry Potter, we all know you're an idiot. So you can't die on us."
"Lord Draco Lucius Malfoy and Master of Death Harry James Potter." Hermione stated.
"Do you mind telling me why you're blood showed up in 1970 when you were born in 1980?"
"Merlin. Will you ever learn to knock?" Arthur said, exasperated.
Pietro, Wanda, Sam and Rhodey looked taken aback. Pietro and Wanda because they were new Avengers and had never seen this process before. Sam and Rhodey because they weren't there the first time they did this two years ago when Sirius accidentally killed Draco.
Once they put the date in runes, Harry hugged George tightly.
Tony laughed before patching himself through to the Compound, "Attention ladies and gentlemen, Severus Snape and Sirius Black have finally kissed. I repeat, they finally kissed. This is not a drill."
Draco thought of his memory. He smiled when it came to him.
Severus stayed quiet.
"No, like... There's a spell. It pauses time. If you pause time, no one dies. You don't feel the deaths."
They made their way to the entrance and stared up at the slide.
"Oh. My husband is named Draco and our son is Scorpius. They're two constellations. The dragon and the scorpion."
They went on to explain everything. From the Ministry to arriving on the new world to Nick Fury finding him and joining the Avengers.
"I can't die." Harry shrugged.
"A coworkerâfriend? I don't know what he is, invited me and my family."
Gwen laughed, "Yes, but they're some of the nicest people."
Scorpius was almost a year and a half when horror struck.
"Guess I'll finally get to meet my parents."
"I showed him what it was like to be loved. Seeing as you didn't. Your
"You must be careful, Master, she will make her appearance in the coming times, and she will not be alone. She has her beast and her loyal fighter."
"Minister Granger, I assume." He said in a bored tone.
"Hey, pup." Sirius coughed out.
Harry did not move.
so much."
Leon shook the look of shock off his face then spoke, "Why here?"
At first, for Harry, she just tried the Lord title. When it didn't work, she remembered something he had told her a long time ago.
'. It was Luna Lovegood who told me to look not in Ravenclaw tower, but to speak to the Grey Lady, Helena Ravenclaw. It was Draco Malfoy for throwing me his wand after I came back from the dead. It was Narcissa Malfoy who said I was dead when in reality I wasn't. It was everyone else besides me. I don't think any of us would be here if it wasn't for everyone else. I think that if Hagrid hadn't come knocking down the door at the cabin in the middle of nowhere, I wouldn't be here. But all of you would. Everyone here was the main reason we're all here. It wasn't a one-man job. It was a job for a whole damn village. It was everyone. We're all here because we did this as a team. And we bloody well better appreciate that. I don't want to talk about those who we lost, because we all lost someone. Think about those still here. Don't think about Remus Lupin and Nymphadora Tonks. Think about Teddy Lupin, who's still here. Don't think about Fred Weasley, think about George Weasley. Think about everything we have left. Those who we lost will always be in our hearts. But don't think about them so much that it takes over your world. Like Draco said, live for them instead," He stopped to take a breath, chuckling a bit,"I said I'd keep this somewhat short but that obviously didn't happen. So, I'm just gonna say, we're here. Be grateful. Thank you."
The strawberry blonde spoke, "He spoke very highly of you when he visited us."
Then Rogers spoke up, "What's a Gryffindor?"
"Can't you just... turn it off?"
Hermione nodded before she all but ran to the library. She searched the rows of books that she lived in as a student.
Harry laughed and helped Teddy tie his tie. Teddy, seeing as he was Headmaster (who didn't wear sparkly robes like Dumbledore) and is a principal, he knew how to get ready, tie ties, make bowties, but he missed out on having those perks with a father, uncle, cousin, godfather or whoever. So, now whenever he can, he lets Harry or Draco help him out to make him happy.
"Wizard, as in magic?"
"From mine and Severus' Occlumency lessons. I accidentally looked into his mind and that was the memory." Harry said. He also had a more detailed memory from the moment now, but he didn't want to mention it.
They heard muttering from the room, though since there was only one signature, it was obvious the man was talking to himself. The door was left slightly ajar, letting the trio hear what the man was saying.
Harry stood up and held his wand up to Mr Creevey who had been detained by Ron and Neville, who had also been an Auror before switching to be the Herbology Professor at Hogwarts.
Draco had only died a couple times, each time brought back by Harry. No matter how many times they went through it, it was always stressful when one of them died.
"Get to them discreetly."
"Tony Stark. He's a friend." Draco explained.
"And now Sirius and Draco are arguing about wine. Good going, Potter." Teddy groaned. "I just wanted some Firewhiskey."
Merlin's head snapped to the corner of the room when he heard whimpering.
Harry reluctantly nodded. He placed a kiss on Draco's forehead then one on his lips. "We'll be outside. Don't worry. Our son is perfect."
"You were shot. Hannah Abbott healed you."
"Yes, Harry, you can change now. There's no point. You're leaving today anyway." Merlin sighed, still not believing that the Knights had a bet about his secret.
"Board meeting," Harry smiled looked up at his husband. "How was your day?"
It was vault number 1372, so it was about halfway down of the underground vaults.
"You know how how we were gonna have a baby girl while were we still in our world?" Draco waited for them to nod before continuing, "Well, I'm pregnant again."
When Draco arrived at their house, he went straight for his and Harry's room. It was tradition now. After so many years being together alone on the run, now they always go see each other when the other gets home. No matter what.
"Oh, shut up. You know you love me, Sev." Draco snorted.
"Malfoy? You're supposed to be dead!"
"Drop your wand, Potter," One of the witches said.
"Assist of murder of Cedric Diggory. Murder of Tom Riddle. And Attempted Murder of Andrew Creevey. It's a really long story."
Harry smiled a bit sadly. He held up his wrist with the metal bracelet. "These are the Hallows."
"The Deathly Hallows? Harry James Potter, what the hell did you do?"
." Harry said, casting the spell as he did it and conjuring the strawberries and the rose that Merlin had created. He took one of the strawberries and ate it on his way out of the training room, leaving Merlin just staring at the door.
"Yeah. Here's an idea. Why don't you stay here with Leon and I'll go help your daddy? It can be a surprise for your papa."
But none of it mattered. They couldn't go into a new world and arrest people for things they didn't do in that world. They didn't even know where they were, for Merlin's sake!
"Then,
Sorry! â¡
"Yes, well, times have changed. Also," He turned back to Harry, "What spell did you use?"
Harry, unlike everyone else, knew exactly what he was asking, "I took a trip over to the Chamber of Secrets. I know, terrible decision. But, I thought you might like them."
My midterms are coming up which is why my uploading schedule has been wack.
"Okay, pass me the knife please."
"What a Horcrux normally does, is it brings out the worst in people. Like during our hunt for them, we had the locket with us since we didn't know how o destroy it. Whoever wore it was always so mean and saying everything on their mind. It's what caused Ron to leave us for a while. It causes everyone's mood to worsen. The Horcrux I had gave me the ability of Parseltongue. It means I can speak to snakes and most reptiles. It was supposed to disappear after the Horcrux was destroyed, but it didn't. Tom Riddle is a descendant of Salazar Slytherin, who is one of the most known Parselmouths. So when I started to speak to a snake in second year, they thought I was the Heir of Slytherin, the one behind the petrifactions. It made everyone think I was just like Tom because of how I looked like him, I don't see it though."
"Sirius, stop blaming yourself for this. It won't do you any good. You weren't here. You don't know what he went through. After you disappeared, he was so mentally out of it that he didn't even respond. He was just going through the motions. The only things to get him to move were trying to get you back and Scorpius."
Draco smiled at the dragon and summoned his own.
"He said your wards wouldn't let him in."
Harry spent his time in the library of all the magical books they owned trying to find an answer to the cracked bracelet. So far he found out that a broken bracelet in dreams were a symbol that your enemy is plotting against you. At the moment, Harry's only enemies were Thanos and himself.
Harry hugged Teddy tightly.
"We're here." Tony said a couple minutes later.
Harry stood up and walked out of the room, not realizing everyone was watching him. He made his way over to his sons room and opened the door slowly.
"I'm coming with you." Stark announced, pulling on a bracelet that could activate the Iron Man suit.
"Teddy's parents. Remus Lupin and Nymphadora Tonks. It was right as Teddy was born. Harry took the photo."
Okay, now she was confused. How the hell did they manage to all land in the same world? And what the hell was an Avenger?
Thanos was starting to take off the gauntlet when he fought off the curse and snapped the gauntlet back on.
(See the end of the chapter for
He started out small, testing his limits. He started with a simple Stupefy. When he didn't seem worn out, he moved on to harder spells. Then he just let all his anger out on the poor wall. There were curses, hexes, jinxes, spells and charms going around the room and no one to stop him.
Minutes later, everything calmed down. The parchment had now been signed by Draco and Harry. It had been magic who signed for them. They were a worthy couple and the magic clearly saw that so it had accepted them.
Sirius gasped. "Cousin Andromeda's grandkid? Tonks' son?"
"When's the due date?"
The director made an odd face at that, "Then find out who it belongs to. There isn't a single person on Earth who isn't in the system."
Gwaine and Percival were matching.
When Merlin was in his late teens, he moved to Camelot to live with his mothers brother, Gaius. He had taken him in and treated him like a son.
"Wait... you inherited Tonks' Metamorphous genes. Did you also get Remus'... illness, as he called it?"
Draco gaped at the ring then looked up at Harry, "Well, I'm not answering until you ask properly."
"Do you think Draco could ever forgive me?"
Sirius and Harry blocked Teddy from sight. When he showed up again, he was a completely different person. Ginger hair, pale skin, brown eyes, tall, muscular. Looked like a Weasley. Or a cousin of a Weasley.
"Of course not, darling. You're carrying our baby." Harry smiled, although Draco couldn't really see his smile.
They went on for a couple minutes, Teddy still holding off the man who was still trying to get in. The other Avengers ready to fight if needed, while Banner and Harry worked to get Draco back.
"They're the Avengers. The us, you could say, of this world. They're superheroes."
That made the three others stop what they were doing.
"Maybe you'll find out earlier, but as of now, it's going to stay a secret."
After a while, there were too many creatures and not enough heroes. Even while using knock out spells and a huge amount of power, the Potters still couldn't take them all on.
Again, the three other men were shocked.
"Of course."
"I'm going to change your bandages, just in case. Would you like Arthur and Gwaine to come in?"
"Of course." Teddy nodded, putting the ring on his finger and kissed Pietro.
Harry hummed, still stirring his cauldron. "Okay. But now I have to wait for the Nick Fury guy to call me."
He heard some rumbling before the door opened.
Draco and Harry Potter were currently walking around the Wizarding world, trying to find their two suspects. They were going to do the same thing Harry, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley did to get into the Ministry the first time on their Horcrux hunt. They had Polyjuice Potion ready and were now just waiting. They had gotten Muggle earpiece communicators so they could talk to each other from other sides of the town.
It resulted in Harry having to use the spell he used to knock out everyone before jumping though the Veil. All of them fell to the ground, some, like Steve, didn't pass out just they were immobilized because Draco also used
"Well, I guess this isn't the first time someone faked their death." He shrugged, twirling his wand in his hands. "But I'm not here to talk about my death. I'm actually surprised you didn't hear. Your son, Draco died with me."
It was a planet called Mecrore. From some scans, they found out that Thanos was there, along with an army of the Chitauri and his children.
"We have to move. They knew we're here," Draco said, standing up and heading to their small but big on the inside tent.
"Merlin? Who's your friend?" An older man asked.
The punching stopped.
"Yes. That's the simple way. Now can someone please explain how my godson married his school rival, how my school rival is still alive, and how my other school rivals son is here?"
spell, see if it works."
Only Steve, Thor, Rhodey, Rocket, Natasha, Bruce, M'Baku, Okoye, Loki and Harry remained.
"The one Harry got from the dragon. 'When the moment comes that the true one reveals himself, a suspicious death shall cause an era of harmony. The battle will shed blood, all but one will survive, his sacrifice the biggest of all'. Harry's going to die."
The rest of the day was them catching up and explaining to the Avengers what all their words and phrases mean. Stark and Banner seemed to be the most interested. Thor was a close second. Romanoff and Barton still seemed on edge about the whole situation while Rogers just looked confused. One thing was learning about what you missing in
"Is he finally going to confess his love for Arthur?" He heard Percival whisper to Gwaine.
Snape just hummed and kept looking around. He stopped by a bookshelf that was filled with books in Parseltongue.
It took Snape a bit of time to process what he had just watched, but then he responded, "I apologize."
As soon as they entered the room, Snape looked around. There were books covering an entire wall, three tables set up, all with cauldrons and a book stand ready to go. Along one of the walls, there were potion ingredients. From spider eyes to honeycomb, there was everything. Along the third wall, there were pre-made potions, calming draughts, healing potions, Veritaserum, the potion used to bring back people with horcruxes.
"And you still look like you're 18, Potter. Explain that."
"What's that?" Lancelot asked, pointing at his arm.
"Fury put me in charge of him. He's the newbie he's been ranting about." Barton explained but his eyes said something different. Something along the lines of 'it's him'.
All of a sudden there was a giant beam of rainbow light that knocked out the creatures in an immediate range around them and an ax came swinging out. It was hitting all of the creatures in sight before going back to the light source. Out stepped out Thor with his red cape flowing behind him in all its glory. Next to him was a tree and a raccoon.
Gwaine spoke up. "What happened to Harry?"
The guard nodded but Harry released himself from the restraints, grabbed his wand and knocked everyone out with a simple spell he and Draco created a while ago.
Quick Note:
Arthur looked amused, as did Gwaine (who had burst out into laughter a long time ago), Elyan, Percival and Merlin. Guinevere, Lancelot and Leon just sat there and watched everything unravel, amused smiles on their faces.
"What's your husband like?" Arthur asked.
Instead of sulking, Draco went over to the tower with his trunk and went up to the Avengers penthouse.
the Master of the Wand. But since Snape was the one to kill Dumbledore, Voldemort believed that while Snape was alive, he could never use the wand to its full potential, so he killed Snape. Then after Dumbledore died, in his Will, it included that I get the Snitch I caught in my first quidditch match. Engraved it said, 'I open at the close'. So when I went to face Voldemort, it finally opened and I got the Resurrection Stone. So, I became the Master of Death." Harry explained, mainly to Thor, but also to anyone else who listened.
Tony finally looked up from his work as soon as he heard his name, "What?"
"Yes, it was, wasn't it? It was your idea after all. Does it include a picture or something of him?" Harry asked as he walked over to him, putting his hand on Draco's shoulder.
"He's beautiful, Harry. James, Lily and Remus would be so proud of you and your pup. Now, come on, let's go get him cleaned up and in a new blanket." Sirius said smiling widely. He turned to Pietro, "Could you go grab a blanket, a small towel and a diaper from his nursery, Pietro?"
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no!" Draco yelled. "I thought we got away from them!"
Fury pulled up Harry Potter's file again. He printed out a shorten version without the classified information. Then he pulled up his work address and made his way over.
Connlach = strawberries
"His parents died on Halloween, he was left with his relatives that didn't like him on Halloween, a troll could've almost killed him on Halloween. Ginerva Weasley opened the Chamber of Secrets on Halloween. Sirius entered the school and everyone thought he was out to kill Harry on Halloween. Harry was illegally chosen for the Triwizard Tournament on Halloween. She could've been born on Halloween."
Scorpius nodded vehemently. Merlin smiled and got up, nodding at Leon, who was glad to stay with Scorpius. They were all in love with the little boy, especially Leon and Gwen. He had them wrapped around his little finger.
"This way."
Teddy rushed over and whispered, "
to keep them down. None of the Potters were affected since they were inside a shield being held up by Snape. Sirius, Teddy and Pietro went up rounding up the team and sitting them down next to each other. Sirius and Snape stood behind the Iron Man team and Teddy and Pietro stood behind the Cap team while Harry just sat in the middle and Draco was laying down with his head on Harry's lap, both just waiting for them all to wake up.
"Well, first of all, my name is Harry Potter. There is no Hadrian Black. Actually, Black isâwasâis my godfather, Sirius Black. My parents are James and Lily Potter. Hogwarts is actually a school in Scotland for witchcraft and wizardry. I grew up in Surrey."
"Thank, Merlin." Harry sighed in relief before wincing, "Sorry. Habit from my Hogwarts days." Harry said before he wandlessly and wordlessly changed the clothes he was wearing into a band shirt that Tony would be proud of and some jeans.
The team looked up at the quarter, originally expecting only three people but saw four.
"Congrats!"
"He's giving off strong Draco 'my father will hear about this' Malfoy vibes right now, but no. I do not know who you are." Draco contemplated telling Sirius that he was now Draco
It was like a palace. Surrounding the doors were Chitauri. Around the palace, in place of a moat of water, was a moat of some sort of lava. The whole place screamed death to Harry.
"Here in New York. At SHIELD Headquarters. It's a secret location, so I cannot disclose the real address."
Harry's eyes widened, but Merlin kept speaking, "Where are you Mordred?"
"Tony, Pietro, Peter and Teddy are on an alien ship with some man named Stephen Strange who is supposedly the Sorcerer Supreme."
"Harry, leave. You can't do anything now. We only need Teddy in here. Go wait outside please."
"Of course not. We're not naming her Carina. But it's too early to be thinking of names. Let's find out the gender then decide a name, okay?"
Then a day later, there was the rush of magic that was normally attached to a marriage bond. Now, Harry and Draco could feel what the other was feeling. It was like a tug on their magic whenever they wanted or needed to.
"Excuse me for a second, boys and Ms. Potts." Natasha smiled innocently and went over to talk to Draco. "What's up with you?"
Scorpius nodded vehemently. Draco chuckled a bit and picked him up.
"Daddy? Are you back?" Scorpius said, turning around.
Draco put protective shields around Harry, Teddy and himself before apparating him and Teddy to Harry, "Harry, love, we're not going to win this."
Steve, Bucky, Wanda and Vision were already awake. Tony and Peter were the next was to wake up. Then it was T'Challa, Scott, Rhodey, Sam, Clint and Natasha.
"My finest would kill you, love." Draco deadpanned, ignoring being called a lady.
"He hurt Draco." Harry said quietly, turning back to look at Draco. "Hey, hey, hey, how are you?" He whispered.
"It was actually his idea." Draco smiled. "I wasn't going to bring it up until later, but he just brought it up one day before we told the Avengers but we didn't tell you guys until now."
That caused a chain reaction.
Tony, Sirius, Harry, Draco and Rhodey took a shot.
"Shh, shh. Baby, I'm here now." Draco rubbed his back, letting his own tears fall. He sat in the rocking chair that was still in his room. They just sat there, both crying. Once they both calmed down, Scorpius spoke.
Draco nodded and scrambled to one of Tony's labs that now contained potion making supplies, including some already made potions, like the one they use to bring back people with Horcruxes.
"Did she have a name?" Snape whispered.
George was gobsmacked. Harry had managed to create a spell that would allow memories to be projected. It was a pensive in spell form. Only Harry could do that.
"Don't you realize how idiot that sounded coming from a 38 year old? Do us all a favor and get over yourselves. If not for you, then for your godsons who love each other very much and probably don't want to see part of their only family left get destroyed over petty school fights." She smiled innocently.
"Where will the child sleep?" Severus asked.
Harry gracefully (as graceful as one can me in jeans and a tee) left the great hall. He heard two sets of footsteps following him, then more.
The dragon just nodded and watched as Merlin and Harry left the clearing.
Merlin slowly approached Harry.
Sam and Rhodey were matching because they were best friends. So were Wanda and Loki considering how close they had gotten over the years. Valkyrie and Thor were matching because of their friendship. Elyan and Leon were matching too.
At the next Weasley family reunion, Hermione didn't know what to except.
"Dray!" Harry whisper yelled from the entrance.
She was shocked. They had barely passed through the Veil hours ago and it had already been 50 years for him. That meant he was 105 years old.
Harry smiled and hugged his godfather, "I missed you so much, Sirius."
Harry made his way down to the Ministers office while Draco headed to their
A few seconds later, some black ink showed up.
Harry slowly put Scorpius down, still holding his hand and stood up to greet them.
"Is he okay?"
"You never asked. There's a lot of things you don't know about me."
Merlin told Harry to follow him and they went into Morgana's old chambers. They had been well kept by the servants of the castle.
"Right."
"Our daughter." He whispered.
"He's my husband. He doesn't count as just anyone." Harry smiled and patted Snape's arm lightly before leaving the guest room.
Everyone showed up at the communal floor in the Avengers tower. They were all dressed fancily, even Peter who didn't have many fancy things. Teddy walked over to him and smiled.
"Daddy!" Scorpius came running at him so Harry quickly kneeled down to give him a hug.
"I'll go easy on you. For now." Barton said.
"I'm coming too." Draco said, making sure his wand was still on his person.
Teddy looked at Harry and smiled widely before hugging him, "Hi, Harry!"
Nebula, one of Thanos' daughters, told them where he'd be.
Enjoy this chapter!
Snape's eyes widened. "You married Potter?"
"Worthy... No... How could you be worthy? You're all killers." A robotic voice said from one of the entrances to the floor they were currently on.
"Draco!" Thor boomed as soon as he saw him.
He pulled up the street footage of London on July 28, 1970. He saw the blood that the Agents took the sample from. He went back a couple frames and saw the three. Harry Potter, Draco Potter and Edward Lupin. They looked like they did now, except maybe Lupin looked a bit different. He went frame by frame and suddenly they were gone. Without a trace, no one even noticing them or the blood stain.
Draco laughed, "That's me."
"I think it's because there's no one here to tell us we can't be together."
No one spoke up. "Alright. So just Natasha, Thor and me. We'll meet you back at the Compound." Steve said and walked towards Harry who was leaning heavily on Severus. Years ago, Snape would've cursed Harry into oblivion for leaning on him, but now, it seemed like they both needed it.
The tenth year anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts was coming up. Harry Potter still blamed himself for the events of the war, even if everyone kept saying it wasn't his fault. He had nightmares almost every night. It was always the same dream. Harry getting killed by Voldemort in the forest. He couldn't bring himself to take Dreamless Sleep because he knew based on his nightmares, he'd get addicted.
"Truth." Draco said, after taking a long sip of his beer.
"Yeah, I can help him. I'm always gonna be there for him, no matter what." Steve nodded, looking at Bucky who was looking back at him. He then turned to Severus, "Thank you."
Harry laughed, "Yes, Neville. I'm so happy. I actually might have to borrow the Sorting Hat in six years."
Harry inhaled shakily before he apparated away.
Thanos' eyes cleared up and awaited for Teddy to tell him what to do. Teddy could tell by his eyes that he had to be quick. It was evident that Thanos was fighting the curse.
Bruce only chuckled, "No. Only when Tony and/or Loki are here. You get used to it."
"Video call, Draco."
"Alright, boys. As much as we enjoyed the show, we need to get going." Tony spoke into the comm system.
"Loki." Draco warned. "Play nice. They're Harry's friends."
"Well... that's Reindeer Games for you." Tony said, clapping his hands together. "Who's hungry?"
Once Harry let go, he pulled the arrow out of his shoulder, not even flinching and frowned at the hole in his brand new uniform. Not that he cared much for it.
"Thank you, Loki."
Everyone got ready to run into battle, shield tightened, wands in hand, guns out, helmets on, power running through their veins, knives out, hand thrusters powered up.
Harry smiled and followed Draco into the tent. They worked quickly but easily as they packed up their home.
He turned and saw who he thought was a mini Weasley. Well, not so mini anymore. Draco only knew his name from the Daily Prophet considering he was the Ministers son.
The closest hero to him that wasn't knocked out was Thor.
Teddy nodded, "Letting go in three..." Harry started adjusting the wards. "Two..." Harry finished. "One." Teddy let go of the spell holding him back and Harry opened the door.
"I'd be honored."
"As good as he can be for a four year old."
"Okay."
Everything in the nursery was either the green-gray, a muted maroon, black, white, silver or gold. The crib that was on the opposite wall of the Hogwarts mural had a black frame with muted maroon sheets and white pillows. Next to the crib was a white rocking chair with an olive green pillow. The dresser was black with a muted maroon changing station on top. Inside the closet (seeing as all his clothes were currently in the dresser) was a shelf filled with toys, there was also another one outside the closet which also contained some children's books. Along the walls were pictures of their family, both with the Avengers and without, and some other accents in gold. On top of the crib was a mobile which Sirius had made. There was a Hedwig, a broom, stars, a deer, wolf and a dog. There were flowers, specifically narcissus flowers and lillies. When Harry first saw the room he almost cried.
Sirius took it upon himself to walk up to the man. He pointed his wand at him while nudging him with his foot.
"Nope. Where should I put Hadrian for the night?"
"Oh."
"Hmm. And you're obviously not from here so there aren't many places to find information about this."
"Harry?" He heard a small voice from next to him, causing him to look up and see Teddy looking at him with wide eyes filled with fear. "You hurt Mr Creevey."
Once George was finally back in his home, he looked at the spell written on the parchment.
When the Avengers met the Maximoff twins, Teddy's first response was to help them. He yelled to the other Avengers to let him help them but they wouldn't listen. To them, he was still technically a boy who was 17 years younger than Harry and Draco.
"In the workshop!" Harry yelled from their basement which they had claimed as a workshop to work on potions or other normal magic stuff they can't have out in broad daylight. It was hard finding ingredients for potions in the Muggle world, but so far they had found some easy replacements for Magical ingredients.
"Yeah. We need lillies and narcissus flowers there. For Aunt Cissy and Lily." Teddy smiled weakly. "I'll be back before you know it. But in the mean time, take care of them for me. I'll always love you." Teddy put a bloodied hand on Pietro's cheek.
"I'm delivering books to Tony. He's helping me with something."
Scorpius nodded and got out of his bed to give his dad a hug. "Thanks, Dad."
Draco's reaction to the nursery was amazing. He had cried a lot and just hugged Harry the whole time. He thanked Severus, Sirius, Teddy and Steve profusely before starting to cry again. He had sat in the rocking chair for a good 30 minutes just rubbing his belly and looking around.
"Okay. After you died, that summer was hell." Harry went on to explain everything that happened that summer, his sixth year, the summer of that year and then his non existent seventh year.
"I'm so sorry!" The man said.
While Harry and Draco were having their conversation, Steve wanted to ask Snape a question.
Harry smiled before the stones flew into the circlet, three going on each side of the black diamond. Harry shuddered.
After a couple minutes, Harry put a glamour on his face and the four of them went down to the second floor girls lavatory.
It was cracked.
It was silent for a bit before Pietro smiled a bit and whispered a thank you.
He heard footsteps. No. He sensed it. He sensed someone coming his way. It was odd. The person wasn't within a reasonable distance to have heard footsteps. But his magic was telling him.
"Middle name?"
"I'm sorry I couldn't do more to protect you from those Aurors. I should've known that they would show up sooner or later."
"FRIDAY? Can you show me their happiest moments?"
They walked into the Ministry, making themselves look as normal as possible. They made their way towards the elevators when someone stopped them.
The next week, Harry found himself locked in a cell. A day later there were eight other people on the other side. Steve Rogers, Tony Stark, Thor, Natasha Romanoff, Clint Barton, Bruce Banner, Nick Fury and Maria Hill. Apparently Romanoff and Barton tattled on him and now he found himself in Magic reducing cuffs in front of the Avengers. He was aware that there was some sort of truth telling wards around the cell (he didn't know where they came from, considering he was the only magical person they knew besides Loki who was in Asgard and most likely wouldn't help them) but there wasn't anything he could do since he wasn't familiar with whoever's magic was being used and if it was even magic.
"We've got time."
"'Kay.." Teddy mumbled as his hand weakly went up to the stab wound.
Harry sighed, "When I was 17, I had to fulfill my prophecy. I killed Voldemort, but in doing so, I became the Master of Death. To do that, first you have to get these three items. The Invisibility Cloakâwhich I inherited from my father, the Elder Wandâwhich I got after I disarmed Draco who had disarmed Dumbledore who was the owner of the wand and the Resurrection Stoneâwhich Dumbledore had left for me after he died. I got those three items. But, before I defeated Voldemort, I had to die. I came back, of course, using the Resurrection Stone. I greeted Death like an old friend. After that day, I had the constant feeling of death in the back of my head. I could
He probably couldn't go around saying his name was Harry Potter in the Medieval Times so he went with a different name, "Hadrian Black, Lord of the Ancient and Noble House of Black." He secretly cast a disillusionment charm on his hand and summoned a twig which he transfigured into the ring he has back at home.
"I love you too, my darling. So, come on, stay with me."
"They're from the Chamber of Secrets. Salazar Slytherin's secret library." Harry said once he noticed what he was looking at.
Draco looked outside and was amazed by the shield that was blocking the debris that fell from the sky and some ships outside the shield. "It looks like magic."
"You are simply a child. You cannot harm me."
"Does that mean Teddy's also back?"
Draco's eyes suddenly narrowed, "What was the first potion you taught me and how old was I?"
"He told me that."
For the first time in forever, he looked down at the bracelet he wore bearing the symbol of the Hallows. And for the first time ever, he noticed that it wasn't smooth metal.
"What the bloody hell is that?" Elyan groaned when he got there.
The nursery in the Potter house had been worked on by Severus, Sirius, Teddy and Steve. The walls were a green-gray color except for one wall. Teddy and Steve had worked for hours on the other wall. It was basically a painting of Hogwarts, as Teddy remembered it. He had sketched it out, seeing as Steve didn't know what the school looked like, and told Steve what to paint what color to help him out. When Harry last checked it, the only thing left to paint was the Quidditch field and the Forbidden Forest.
"Harry, it's not your fault. Stop worrying. We've had this same conversation every year."
The man looked at Harry, "Let me buy you a drink to make up for it?"
"Just something I need to speak to with the Court Physician."
"Now the spider venom, please."
Draco, unlike Harry, was spending most of his time with Scorpius. He was teaching him small bouts of magic to play around with just for fun. He taught him spells like
"Great. Another prophecy I have to figure out." Harry sighed.
"WAKANDA FOREVER!" The King yelled which caused a chain reaction of the sector of the border to be opened, heroes running towards the creatures that were now entering through.
Minutes later, Draco and Harry made their way to what seemed to be the middle of the dance floor. Sirius was holding a package. He set it down and smiled at Draco and Harry.
When Draco and Harry got there, Draco almost cried because of how beautiful everything was. Harry just held him in his arms and kissed his cheek.
That was the last question she took that day. She made her way down to the Chamber of Death, where the Veil of Death stood. There was a group of Unspeakables working to see if they could somehow find out where the trio ended up.
"Yeah." Draco smiled nervously.
"No, bull
The new compound was ready which brought a problem with Peter Parker, or Spider-Man. Teddy went over to help him when he could but it was getting harder to do seeing as school had started mid-August. There was a winged man who was selling alien tech for a lot of money? Tony ended up taking away the kids suit after an incident on a ferry boat. Happy, Tony's bodyguard (and one of his closest friends) got calls from his friend Ned saying that Peter was going after the winged guy and that they needed to stop one of the jets going to the new compound. It ended with them having to go salvage what they could of a wreck and seeing the winged man all webbed up with a note from Spider-Man.
Teddy laughed into his hand while Pietro just chuckled.
"I'll do it." Teddy said from the Â door.
"That's why? Because petty fights you had my dad? I'm not my father. I'm not my mother. Can't you get over it? You're the godfather of the man that I love and my mother's childhood best friend. I'm pretty sure Draco and my mom would want us to get along."
"Oh my god... He's perfect." Draco said while crying.
With his family, he could do anything. Be anything. Be himself, most importantly.
"Let me see it."
Harry thought for a second, "In modern magic, the spell is
Harry lowered his wand, causing the rest of the Avengers to drop their hands from their weapons.
"What business?" The one who was closest to Arthur asked. Leon, he thought.
"Alright," He stuck his arms up in surrender, chuckling softly. "I believe I'm supposed to train. Director's orders."
"FRIDAY, tell me when he wakes up."
"Malfoy! Give me the boy and he won't get in trouble. I can't say the same about you, though."
So. They did manage to get married and have two children, although one was dead. No matter how much she hated Malfoy, losing a child was the worst.
"Do you miss him?"
Hermione nodded, took the quill and sighed. Griphook grabbed the parchment again and signed his own name next to hers.
Time after the Snap passed quickly. Scorpius grew up quickly. When he started showing his accidental magic, Harry had been so happy for the first time in forever. He went to call Draco but then realized that he wasn't there. The remaining Potters didn't stay at the compound for much time. After the Snap, they went back to their house to try to stay away from all that.
"Your eyes turn pure gold when you do magic. You were supposedly the only magic user that was able to do that. Not even Gellert Grinelwald or Albus Dumbledore, two of the most powerful wizards, have been able to do that."
"You mean the constant feeling of people dying every second? Yeah I feel it. It's not nice, but I've gotten used to it and now it doesn't bother me."
"HYDRA."
Seven minutes later, the Team arrived. Arthur quickly picked the bleeding Merlin and followed Bruce and Severus to the medical wing. The rest of the group was following. On their way to the room, Arthur looked into the only other occupied room. He saw a man with shoulder length black hair and striking green eyes looking at him. The raven gave him a quick smirk before turning back to the blonde child that was playing on the floor with some action figures. On the bed lay another raven haired man. Harry.
"We both did." Harry laughed, "It was funny actually. He proposed first, but I had been planning on proposing to him so we just exchanged rings and we got married a couple months after that."
There was slight tension through the rest of the harvesting process.
"But-"
Before he realized, everything had gone quiet. They all watched as the new couple said their goodbyes. Based on the fact that Thanos was gone and they had no Time Stone, and only one ship with not enough fuel to get back to Earth, they were stuck there. Thanos had five of the six stones. There was no stopping him at that point. Chances were that Harry and Draco were going to die so even if Teddy survived the aftermath of Thanos, no one besides them two knew how to bring them back. It would be a lost cause.
His voice, although an accent was evident, was very raspy. Like he either yelled or smoked a lot.
"Draco." Harry said, his voice raspy.
Before they had realized it, all the lights in the castle were off besides theirs and the torches of the knights on patrols.
Scorpius was actually a really quiet baby. He didn't fuss too much as long as you let him sleep and eat at the right times. He was almost always in someone's arms, mostly either Harry or Draco, but his godfathers also had a lot of time with him.
Draco laughed, "Sweetie, my birthday is in six months. We should be more focused on Sev's birthday. It's in five days, the ninth. I already have his present, but I'm assuming you don't."
Harry knocked on the door and waited for the "Come in" heard from inside before entering. He smiled again before sitting down in front of Hermione.
"May I ask what your studies are?" Gwaine asked him as they got closer to Camelot.
Hexes, jinxes and curses were thrown around the room, Teddy and Draco sticking together while Harry was on his own.
Teddy let his shield drop as he was magically exhausted. He staggered as he was shot multiple times before the jet went away. Pietro, who had his back facing Clint (who still had his eyes closed and was still holding the boy tightly), turned around and saw Teddy with brown hair, brown eyes and the face of a 30 year old, and watched as he fell to the ground.
"I'm sorry I killed you. I thought you were your father."
Everyone in the room fell down unconscious on the floor besides them three.
"Okay, take us out of our misery and just tell us what he got you!" Sirius practically yelled, wanting to know why his godson went to the Chamber of Secrets.
Merlin stayed quiet for a bit, just staring at the woman. Merlin was intimidating, he knew that. By seeing if the woman would back down, he would know if she was worthy of the information.
It seems Harry also heard it because he also stopped moving.
"They have this tattoo, it's a snake and a skull, on their forearm. It's called the Dark Mark. Hold on. Draco. Come here." Sirius watched as Draco excused himself from his conversation with Pepper Potts and walked over.
The other three left, leaving Harry and Draco alone in the living room.
"But jumping across universes does." Merlin smirked. This was something the girl didn't know. It was always fun teaching young people how the universes worked. "For us, it's 2053, for them it's 2020. For us, they just jumped through the Veil a couple days ago. For them, it was 40 years ago. When they jumped through, they were essentially pushed back in time in a different timeline. But since no portraits of them were made, no one knows what will happen to them. Merlin had one made of him and since he is from this universe, I have all of his memories until 2053."
"Never have I ever slept with more than 15 people in a year." Rhodey started.
"That means Draco is going to be one of the five coming with us." Merlin said.
It took a bit of time but Snape managed to get all the HYDRA out. Bucky would still remember everything from his HYDRA days. It could give him PTSD but he could get over that with time and therapy. He was sure that his friend (or maybe more, Severus didn't know) would help him though it all. After all, one of the memories had them saying "til the end of the line".
Argo laughed, "I'm from England, as are you if I can tell by the accent."
"The suspect acts like a normal person. He gets up in the morning, goes to work at the NYPD, gets sent on a dangerous case, brings in the perp with ease, goes home to his husband and son, goes to bed, and starts all over again," Agent Romanoff started.
"Since Narcissa died. The first time I kissed him."
Two days later, a ship landed on the Avengers property. Everyone went outside to see who Steve, Natasha and Thor came back with. This time, Severus was holding Scorpius. Harry had changed out of his dragonhide into some of Draco's clothes but other than that he hadn't changed, he was paler though.
Thanos tried to snap again. Carol stopped him. Then he tried again. No one was there to stop him. Until Tony showed up. He tricked Thanos. Tony had the stones.
Harry just seemed to be frozen. He wasn't crying. He wasn't moving. Only blinking and breathing. Losing his godfather, husband and godson all in one day wasn't a healthy thing. But the fact that he didn't say anything said he was in shock.
Harry shrugged, grabbing his water and going back to drinking it.
"I'll never get over that time difference. But, on to what I'm here for, harvesting a basilisk."
Merlin hummed, walking closer to Harry. "I don't think you noticed. Your eyes went a bit gold the last couple minutes there."
Harry considered what Severus was saying. "So we have to bring everyone back and then the balance will be restored and the bracelet won't be cracked anymore."
He looked around to see if he could find a clock. It was 5 pm. His magic let him know that someone had entered the wards. He couldn't tell from this far away who it was but it was either Draco or Teddy since no one else was keyed into the wards. Harry tried to pull on the thread of his magic that set the wards but he still couldn't pick up on the magical signature. Then he shuddered.
"You said he owns a hospital. How'd that happen? You need a lot of money for that."
Comment if you know what the cracked bracelet means! â¡
"The room next to ours. It's just a guest room for now, but we can make it into the nursery. And we can spell a door between our rooms for whatever reason." Harry explained. "We were gonna ask the girls for advice on how to decorate whenever we tell them."
"Your godson got proposed to while he was dying and you think it's kind of sweet?" Neville all but screeched.
Draco picked him and and hugged him, "Oh, my love, I'm so sorry."
Oh, bless her. First of all, he was gay and his spouse was a male. Secondly, he was dead.
"But anyways. How are you here?" Harry asked Sirius.
"But is there?"
"Your third year, you and Hermione used a time turned to get me out of getting Kissed and told me to use Buckbeak the Hippogriff to escape getting Kissed. I hid out with Crookshanks, Hermione's cat, in my Animagus form during the school year."
"And I'm not planning on leaving again for a while." Harry smiled.
"Well, once we started our run, we went back to grab some stuff and I came across this book and decided to grab it. I hope you don't mind, we've been writing in some alternatives since magical items are really hard to come by here."
"No, I'm no Queen. But, yes, I am Guinevere." She nodded, turning a bit red.
It was going great until...
"Yeah, um," He cast an
"What does this
Chapter 16: Post-Endgame
"Okay." Draco smiled a bit reluctantly.
"Dead. She was never born. The Aurors killed her, not that they knew she existed."
Merlin looked up and smiled at the kid, "Yes, Scorpius?"
"What will happen to all the funds that were placed on the investigation to find Potter and Malfoy?"
Harry laughed and shook his head. "You haven't seen the half of what I can do."
"Harry, please tell me this isn't the last time I'm going to see you." He said.
"Stay here. I'll find you something to wear."
"I believe so. If what he is saying is true, that most likely means that my brother was being used by the Mad Titan."
As he walked into the Auror's office, he saw someone he never thought he'd see again.
"Fury. Nick Fury."
"But him? A Death Eater's son?"
Harry looked at the chain and smiled. His rings. Harry took the chain and put it around his neck again. "I told you I would. Your papa would've died without me."
"The scorpion."
Then he told them about when he got his first Hogwarts letter. He told them of the Hogwarts Express and meeting Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley for the first time. He told them about the troll, Quirrel, Snape and the Philosophers Stone. He told them what it was like returning to the Dursley's â because it'd never been his home â house.
sleep with each other. How long ago was it? Were you drunk?"
"Better me than him." Teddy said.
Him and Ginny Weasley broke up a year after the war. She had told him, "I think we should both move on, Harry. But I'll always love you." They were still good friends, as good as they can be after dating for a year and a half. It hurt Harry to see her with another man but he knew she was happier now without him. She was currently the Chaser for the Holyhead Harpies, and a bloody good one.
"Somewhere."
Tell me what you thought!
"Yes, well, I have an announcement to make." Merlin said loudly, while he stood up.
"We got married 50 years after the war because we loved each other. Sirius is here because he kinda portal hopped until he got here. Teddy is here because we picked him up on the way to the Veil room." Harry explained.
and got started. "Can you pass me the vial that has the yarrow, please?"
Arthur dwelled on that before speaking again, "Did you find out how to bring back your people?"
As the Knights started riding out towards the Lake, Harry got on his broom and rode next to them.
"And Draco?"
"I'm the last of the Black's. My last family member died a couple years ago." Harry lied easily. His eyes scanned over the small crowd. Seven people. From what Harry knew it was King Arthur, Sirs Percival, Lancelot, Gwaine, Leon and Elyan of the round table. The other one was a raven haired man with blue eyes, giant ears and high cheekbones. Merlin. Harry gasped on the inside as he looked at the most powerful wizard.
"But what does that have to do with this? He's most likely dead by now."
"When he visited me, he was depressed. He had lost his husband, godson and godfather all in one day. But he had a son he had to stay strong for. For someone with a lot of 'baggage', as the kids say these days, he was very strong. He doesn't give up. Must be the Slytherin in him." Merlin was quiet but Hermione didn't speak. She could tell he had something else he wanted to say, "There's a book. The most accurate book, in my opinion. Merlin and His Majesties Knights: The Unknown Past by Taleia Dhisor. She was a witch in the 1700s, I believe. She was who found my portrait before you. I gave her almost every piece of information of my life, up until my death, of course. Not many people believed it, so it did not go far. Who would believe that Merlin the great sorcerer was a manservant for King Arthur? There is a copy of the book in this library."
"McGonagall asked me to come early. I don't really understand why. But, whatever. What about you?"
"Firewhiskey?" Someone who sounded like Bruce said.
"What?" Arthur spat.
Harry debated. He had been keeping the broken bracelet a secret from everyone for almost a year. "After heâAfter Thanos snapped, I noticed that the Hallows bracelet was cracked. I've been trying to find out why and if there's a way to fix it."
"My finest, as you say, is back in the Wizarding World. Believe me, I've tried to remake it."
"He is in the medical wing. He's asleep, in a coma." Draco whispered.
"What'd she say?"
"No, it was my fault." Harry said, straightening out his suit.
Draco nodded. He poured himself some more scotch before talking again, "Please don't tell anyone. We only just told Sirius and Teddy today and I don't want anyone else to know."
When he got out and through the other side, he was saddened at the sight. The Department of Mysteries. Not a happy place. But, bringing some light to the place was George.
come back. But they'll only be a shell of what they used to be. It worked for me since by that point I was the Master of Death. At least I think that's why it worked for me." And then the Wand was in his hand. "This is, in my opinion, the most dangerous of all. The Elder Wand. I got this from disarming Draco, who disarmed Dumbledore, who got it from Gellert Gindelwald, another Dark Lord from the first Wizarding War. Apparently Dumbledore and Grindelwald were lovers? I dunno. This is nicknamed the Deathstick, and believe me, it's named that for a reason. It's what caused my spell against Andrew Creevey to be so powerful. It's the most powerful wand to exist in our world."
Harry whispered a spell that he invented to show memories even without a Pensive.
But apparently, wherever they landed, Steve and Tony were alive.
If Harry had been drinking something, he would've spit it out right then and there. "What?"
About halfway through, Harry spoke up, "Teddy's getting married."
"Tell me something only Sirius would know."
"Alright, so those are the books that could possibly have something about the Dark Mark, Voldemort and the Death Eaters."
"Loki? As in the one who attacked New York?" Sirius asked. "That's where I recognized him from! I'm such an idiot."
"I'm fine. Just a small scratch. There's a note in my bedside table. Give it to Severus after you read it if I don't make it."
Tony watched a panicking Quill. "Steady, Quill."
"I tried to kill him. Multiple times. But our sister tried to kill both of us." Loki shrugged.
Eventually, the Avengers were going to die. Sirius and Severus were going to die. His
"Dare."
"How do you get through it? Merlin's been unconscious for an hour and I'm dying."
"Draco? What's wrong?" Tony asked.
"Don't forget me! I was sentenced to 20 years, I think they said, for harboring a fugitive!" Draco laughed, though there was nothing funny about it.
"I can."
"Harry. Take a breath. Why're you bringing all of this up?" Draco asked, placing his hand in Harry's, trying to calm him down.
"Hmm... Professor. The antidote, please?"
"I am indeed Harry Potter, if the scar doesn't tell you that. Now answer me, who are you?" Harry asked again.
Merlin went over the words quietly.
"Malfoy? You've got it all wrong, Granger. It's
They finally got back on the Jet and Clint started flying it back to the Compound.
That was a very interesting conversation.
What Harry didn't realize was that when he let out his magic, he also brought everyone back. He only realized when he started to see portals start to show up. He looked around and saw everyone stepping out. T'Challa, Peter Quill, Doctor Strange, Wong, Peter Parker, Mantis, Drax, Wanda, Shuri, Groot, Hope, Scott, Clint, Sam, Bucky, Sirius, Teddy and Draco.
In 2013, Thor has an issue with his girlfriend Jane, about her having a soul in her? Harry didn't understand it very well, even if he had another soul in him for the first seventeen years of his life. When Thor came back to Earth after that, he announced that his brother Loki was dead. There was a huge argument about that. Tony and Sirius were pissed since now they couldn't find out anything about the 'Mad Titan' that Sirius mentioned when they first found him. They had never found anymore information about the Titan. Loki had gone missing after the invasion on Earth. He was in Asgard's prison for a while before disappearing. Clint believed that he was back with the Titan (he had a vendetta against Loki after the whole mind control thing). Sirius just wanted to know more about the man who saved him while Tony wanted to know more about the Titan to prepare the world for him.
"Then take it. It could be a lot of fun for all you know. It might remind you of your Auror days."
As it was falling, he caught it using a levitating charm and started casting hexes and curses at everyone around him. He deflected everything that was aimed at him with his wand and used wandless magic to cast the curses and hexes.
' The news that we died. That was beautifully executed plan, by the way, love."
"You are welcome. Do you need help figuring out the Runes?"
Teddy left his mind and whispered, "He killed her."
5. A certain death that happened in chapter 14 will be explained in the next chapter.
"I couldn't care less. As long as I get to find out the gender of my baby, I'm perfectly fine."
"It's Harry Potter. Take him to Azkaban. Draco
"Oh, Mr. Hewion! Just the person I was looking for!" A voice called from behind them.
"I'm going to check it out." Tony said, grabbing one of his bracelets that would activate the Iron Man suit if needed.
"Scared of what? My reaction? There isn't anything that would scare me into leaving you, I hope you know thâ" Harry started but was interrupted by Draco.
can't. I'm going to be sent to Azkaban for attempted murder if I stay. And Draco already stood up for me so he's gonna be hated for everything. We can't stay here."
Draco looked apprehensive but ended up agreeing and rolled up his sleeve when he realized it could help Tony. "I hated it so I covered it with tattoos but you get the point." True, there were flowers covering the outside of it, but the Dark Mark was still prominent on his skin. Draco had tried covering the Mark, the black ink would still be there, no matter how many tattoos he covered his skin with, it would always come out on top.
"You just said Draco knows everything about your life." Snape deadpanned.
The Ministry was still after Draco and Harry. Draco and Harry had established that they both liked each other and had been dating for a year and a half. They moved location every week. The Ministry had no idea where they were, but once they had an idea, Draco and Harry were gone the next day. The Ministry had even gotten the American Ministry of Magic to help them, even though they were never near America. They stayed in Europe, though never in the same city.
The team nodded (minus Tony who was piloting). Teddy looked out the window as they passed through England. To be honest, Teddy hadn't been to England since they landed on this world.
"Yeah. It never goes away. People die every second and I can't stop it, so I live with it."
Harry let out a tiny laugh, wiping the tears that were falling on his cheeks with his sleeve, "You're the bloody idiot, you idiot," Harry pulled out a similar box, inside the box was another beautiful ring. It had a gold band with a perfectly cut silver topaz in the middle.
Severus stayed close to Harry the whole time. The Avengers (minus M'Baku and Okoye who had to stay in Wakanda) made their way back the QuinJet to get back to their home. The flight lasted two hours at the speed Bruce was flying. The whole two hours were full of silence besides Scorpius fussing at one point which stopped once Harry started rocking him in his arms.
"Yeah."
"Hmm. Keep an eye on the place. Make sure it doesn't happen again and see if anything changed from before. And test that blood, see who it belongs to."
Hermione had never been more confused by a book (well, maybe by a Divination book).
"Harry Potter. You may also know me as the Master of Death." Harry whispered but everyone heard it as it was quiet on the field.
At one point, once there was nowhere to go other than death, Sam, Rhodey, Nick Fury and Maria Hill showed up with a carrier to evacuate the people and get them away from the city.
Draco looked at him for a good ten seconds before he started making a drink. He mixed together the weirdest things like bourbon, apple juice, crushed cashews, ginger, milk, a lemon and ice. He put it in a glass and set it in front of Tony, as if daring him to drink it.
"What?" The one on the other side of the blonde said. This one had shoulder length brown hair and a beard. If Sirius was being completely honest, he could've been looking in a mirror. "How?" It was also evident that he was leaning against a giant blonde man, meaning he was either hurt or just plain tired.
"My love." Draco kissed him.
"Teddy?"
"What?"
Then someone asked about Thor's hammer. And a whole 'who can pick up the hammer' game started. Draco didn't even bother. He said, "As long as I'm marked by Voldemort, there's no way in hell I'm worthy."
"'Us'? Who is 'us'?" Severus asked, skipping over the part where he called Black and Potter by their first names.
"Saves people. He's a doctor and honorary Avenger. He hasn't really been accepted as an Avenger but we all know he is."
Harry smiled a bit before he closed his eyes, his hand going limp in Dracoâs.
"But I don't have a family! My parents are dead, my grandparents are dead! You guys are all I have. And don't you dare say anything about your father, because we both know he's gonna be in Azkaban until he dies!" Teddy yelled.
"How many years?" Draco replied, still working on packing.
"Okay." Scorp nodded.
"We'll try and do something. Maybe Mr. Hewion can send more Aurors to Hogwarts to make sure Potter or Malfoy or anyone else doesn't attack," Weasley shrugged.
Harry said, picking up his stuff and walking towards the exit.
M'Baku, a Lord from one of Wakandas tribes spoke to Okoye, "This will be the end of Wakanda."
"Use the
"Is he under? Don't let up." Tony told Mantis.
"Great." Draco smiled. "He should stay asleep, mission alarms don't ring in his room, but just watch over him, please."
Barton made a grunt as if saying 'follow me' and headed back down the way he came. Harry followed closely behind.
"Dad, can you tell me about how you met Papa?"
"You want to disrupt the balance of the universe. I can't allow that. You think killing half the universe will fix everything? No! You're power hungry. You think you're doing something right but in reality you know nothing. You know nothing about how this universe works. People die so others can live on. People risk their lives for the ones they love all the time and now you think you can waltz in with your villain agenda and try to change that? You won't fix anything. You'll ruin yourself in the process."
"How about Orion?" Harry suggested.
"Harry... What'd you do?" Sirius groaned.
"Minister Granger, I hope you realize that my Aurors are doing the best they can. No offense, ma'am, but as of right now, we've been searching for 45 years and still nothing. We've come close on multiple occasions but never close enough to catch them. They have wards up, from what your son told me from the recent sighting. These men have been on the run for 45 years and don't you think it's finally time we let them go?"
Merlin looked at her (examined her was a better word).
Peter Parker webbed up his eyes and swung on one of his webs to kick him in the face. Drax leapt into action and used one of the blades in his hands to slice a tendon on the back of Thanos' knee. Doctor Strange jumped through a portal he made to duel Thanos while Drax attacked from behind. Thanos punched Drax and tore the webs from his eyes. He went to hit Strange but his shield saved him. Peter Quill shot Thanos from behind while using platforms made by Strange to run away. He had stuck a bomb of sorts on Thanos' back that was going off. After that he flipped Thanos a bird then fell through another portal.
"You messed with something you didn't understand. You messed up the balance of the universe. You brought this upon yourself, Mad Titan. You, and you alone." Harry said.
"I'm surprised you didn't recognize him. Well, not really. He's a Metamorphous."
"Steve?" Bucky called out to his boyfriend.
Draco made his way down to the Magical Law Enforcement department. Apparently, Tiswer Syiltal was an Auror. The partner to the Weasley boy. It was just perfect.
"Good."
"Harry, Teddy and I."
"It was Helmut Zemo. He's the one who activated the words in Berlin."
"âlin, you idiot. Why would someone be by the Lake?"
On June 27th, they had the option to find out the gender, but instead gave the paper with the baby's gender to Wanda who wanted to plan a baby shower/gender reveal party for them.
Steve could almost hear Sam's laughter from here.
As soon as he said his name, Lucius Malfoy's eyes shot up.
Two years later, nothing had changed.
"I'll watch him." A female voice said from the doorway.
And for the first time in two, almost three years, the Avengers family was complete again.
"Wow, okay," Harry laughed a bit, blinking away his tears before starting to talk, "Ted, I could never spend too much time with you because you reminded me of your parents and how I couldn't save them. But now I know it was wrong to think that because, they died to make sure you had the best life possible, like what my parents did for me. I loved you since I first saw you in your mothers arms. And I loved you even more once Remus asked me to be your godfather. I wanted to be better, I wanted you to have a better life than I did. I knew my godfather for two years before he died and I didn't want the same for you. Which is why I regret not taking better care of you. I know you grew up to be an amazing man, but I wish I could've been there more more of your childhood. So, I'm sorry about that. But, I love you and I always will. Draco, love, I'm not gonna say much because these past years have said everything they need to, but I am going to say this. It's been an honor to be your husband, to be with you, to be able to hold you, to have so many great memories with you and I love you. I got my first tattoo for you, over my heart, because that's what you are to me, you're my heart. So thank you for being my heart."
"Oh! It's a communicator. My wife is making me wear it. Y'know, making sure I don't die on the job." Draco replied, cringing on the inside at the word
"Edward Remus Lupin! You can't come with us! I can't watch you die because you came with us. Haven't you noticed that I still look like I'm 17? Or that Harry looks like he's 17? He's the Master of Death, he can't die, he stopped aging once he got all the Hallows! I have a Horcrux that the Dark Lord made me make, making me immortal. I can't watch you die! I can't lose you after all this everyone did to make sure you had a good life."
!"ï¿½ Sirius yelled.
"So the legends are wrong." Harry whispered. "Do their eyes turn pure gold like yours do?"
"Don't worry, he's right outside with Gwaine. I just wanted to check up on you before they come in."
Draco nodded and moved back to the pile of books. He used a simple floating charm to get them back up to the normal world. Tony followed him and watched as Draco put the books down on the kitchen table. "Tell me if they help you out with anything. If they don't, also tell me and I'll search through the other books we have to see if theres anything in them."
"Yes. We'll need to catch up at some point, preferably not in the middle of a battle scene." Harry smiled.
"Since you are really good with mind stuff, do you think you can help Bucky get that HYDRA stuff out of his brain?"
The god turned around and smiled when he saw him. "Harry. I see you made it back fine."
"No, darling. It must've been hard to think about it at first."
Sirius chuckled but nodded. "Yes, but continue."
"The answer you seek is more obvious than you think. Look for the broken one and join all three to make a whole. Life and death, two sides of the same coin, one cannot survive without the other. The battle will shed blood, all but one will survive, his sacrifice the biggest of all."
"We need to tell them."

that?" The bug chick, Mantis, said while pointing at Strange.
"How'd his hair change color?" Banner asked.
"Okay. That's creepy." Barton said.
"Pietro." He coughed.
"What were you sentenced with?"
"I'd figure out a way to have both of you. We already lost a child before and its not fun. I don't know how I'd react to losing you. I love you both so much."
Hermione had a thought. Sirius Black had fallen through the Veil. So had Severus Snape. Did that mean they were with Harry?
"Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it right now, you understand?" Tony said while still working with Peter to get the gauntlet off.
"I'm pregnant."
"Harry?" He whispered.
It was a simple exit, no one really stopping them.
They both watched as the dragons flew around each other. Their tails intertwined and they flew around the forest.
to check the time, "It's dinner time. Everyone should be in the Great Hall, so I don't think you should need the Cloak."
"At some point. How about after we find out the gender?"
"Done, Agent Potter." FRIDAY said after a couple seconds.
Hermione didn't know what to say. The unborn child, Carina, had been killed. It wasn't a miscarriage or an abortion. She was murdered by her people. She couldn't think. Everything was overwhelming her. There was so much going on. Harry always had so much going on.
Chapter 16: Endgame (or my altered version of Endgame)
"But, no. I'm not royalty. It's a Master of Death thing. My own personal power source, I suppose."
"Merlin is bleeding out and he's rejected literally every spell weâ
"What I have to say might interest you, Mr Potter."
Barton hated him already. Harry had insisted he knew how to take care of himself but Fury wouldn't budge, causing him to pull Barton out of training and introduced him to Harry.
"Where is he or she?"
"Sirius." Teddy whispered. He had crouched down next to Harry, he picked up Harry's wrist with the bracelet on it. The crack in it that once only reached to the middle, was now completely broken. Teddy gingerly took the two ends apart and took the bracelet off his wrist.
"Of course, Minister Granger."
"No, actually, I didn't. You see, it's funny really. You might've heard of it, the Veil? Yeah, we jumped through that, but looky here! I'm still here. And you're still in jail!"
"No."
In the kitchen, Scott was at the couch with Scorpius while Draco was working on making something.
The trio made their way to the room, trying not to make a sound even though Draco cast a silencing charm on them the minute they entered the house.
Harry clapped. "Great! Now that you're all awake, let's talk about this."
"Believe me, I'm not going anywhere for a long time."
Harry took his son and held him tightly.
Merlin could recognize that voice anywhere. Mordred.
"Boys, boys. Calm down." Natasha said, standing up and walking over to them. "Now, why don't you explain for the rest of us why you don't like each other?"
"The man identifies as Doctor Stephen Strange. Sorcerer Supreme. He was in a car crash in 2017 which meant he couldn't operate anymore so he resorted to the Mystic Arts. He has a sanctuary in New York City. He guards something called the Time Stone."
Once they were all on the Jet (albeit some hesitation from the newcomers) and they all knew each others names, Bruce told Gwaine to sit down so he could look him over.
"Dragon, huh?" He turned to the other blonde, "Pietro, bring me basilisk venom, basilisk scales, a cauldron and yew leaves from my workshop. Also, turn the temperature down to 65 degrees fahrenheit."
"I know you do, buddy. And I love
She got to the last chapter.
"Then who would want to marry a man who looks like he's 18, when he's actually 118?"
"Okay, let's see... If Teddy and I weren't an issue, would you do it? Would you take the job?"
"Yeah. There's something that I talked to Harry about that he decided you should know. Harry's telling Teddy right know since he doesn't know this either. Only us four are the ones who will know this."
Teddy shook his head with a smile on his face before making his way back to the Jet with Harry and Draco following him. On his way into the Jet, Harry patted Sirius on the back.
Scorpius looked around from his room in the Avengers compound. He was now five years old and spent a lot of his time reading. Severus was in the room next door to his but he didn't want to go talk to him. He would've liked to talk to his dad but he always seemed either sad or was busy working recently. The time he did spent with his dad, it was full of laughter for a bit before his dad started crying and left the room spewing apologies and saying that someone was going to come into his room to spent time with him. So, Scorpius left the room and walked mindlessly around the compound. He came across a room full of books. It didn't look like a library, seeing as there were vials filled with multicolored liquids.
Without using any hesitation, he whispered, "Sectumsempra."
"I wasn't going after Ron or Harry! You should know that better than anyone considering you're the one who only protected Harry because of your obsession with his mother!"
When he left the room, Gwaine turned to him.
"I said you would tell me first then the Knights." Arthur said.
Harry sighed. "The Killing Curse is exactly what it sounds like. It's one part of the three Unforgivables. It's the Killing Curse, the Torture Curse and the Mind Control Curse. When you use them in our world, you're supposed to get sent to Azkaban, the prison I was talking about. The Killing Curse can kill you with just two words. The Torture Curse causes you an immense amount of pain just by saying one word. The Mind Control Curse, is also what it sounds like. With one word, you can get anyone to do anything for you. The reason he's still alive is because he has a Horcrux."
"And no child would be able to detect the sexual tension going on between you two," Teddy mumbled, but both of the men picked it up.
, you could say.
Draco's dragon instantly disappeared, Harry's following shortly after. Draco turned around, trying to locate where the sound came from.
"What? You wanted me to yell, 'Harry, dear, your friends son is attacking me'?! Even if I did tell you, who knows if they would've hit me or not! And why are they even using that spell?"
Tony, Rhodey, Thor, Loki and Carol Danvers went down first to scour the area to see where they had to go. Once they found it, the ship landed and everyone got out.
"I love you both too much to leave you again. I'm always gonna be here for you. Both of you. Whether you like it or not."
"It was supposed to be a surprise, darling, what did you expect?"
"Eventually." Severus said.
"Yes, I think I'd like to know that too." Tony said, inactivating the suit.
"You never know. There were a lot that were sentenced to the Veil. We don't know where they are but we have to be on the look out. Like Moody said, 'constant vigilance'." Sirius said.
"Just Arthur, please."
"I outflew it. No Dragonlord magic goiâ" Harry suddenly stopped. "In some mythology, dragons are considered serpents. I can speak to serpents. It's a very rare ability. I didn't even realize I was speaking a different language when I first started speaking it."
"Yeah. They're 118. Sirius is 39. And I don't know how old Professor Snape is..." Teddy said.
The goblin finally looked up and pulled out another piece of parchment with an ornate knife.
"So pay up." Leon said, sticking his hand out. Slowly, everyone put a small pouch of coins in Leon's hand.
"But why did you come here?" Gaius asked.
They got on Tony's personal elevator and made their way to the communal floor.
"Are you okay, Hadrian?" Merlin asked.
"Give it a second. They always come back." Steve reassured.
"I warn you... you will want to talk to me after the ending. It is something not most believe. It is rather abrupt, but that is how it happened."
"I'm the Master of Death." He smirked, showing off the bracelet.
"Merlin. My name is Draco. I'm Harry's husband."
He told them that the Ministry was watching Hogwarts with Dolores Umbridge, the worst Defense professor and Headmistress (though for a short time) Hogwarts has ever seen. He told them about Dumbledore's Army and the Order of the Phoenix. He also included the Battle of the Department of Mysteries and the death of his godfather.
The sudden aching feeling in Harry's chest made him stop moving. He could feel his godsons pain. Harry fell onto his knees and screamed, letting out a powerful burst of magic that knocked everyone around him out, both heroes and Thanos' men.
Barton scoffed. "So your worlds most powerful items are a bracelet?"
Severus whispered a quick spell then said, "He's overwhelmed. He has so much knowledge in his brain he doesn't know what to do with it. I'm assuming when he took power of the Infinity Stones, he gained knowledge of our world. How else would he know all that about us? He only spent a day with all of you, and I've never told anyone, besides Lily, about my father."
"No, I'm good thanks. Take care of them, will you? I know you have a thing for Severus, even if you don't want to admit it. Take care of him and Scorpius."
"A Mad Titan wiped out half of his universes population. That included... Draco, Teddy and Sirius. His husband, godson and godfather. He was left with his son, Scorpius, and Severus. I believe you know them."
The Avengers slowly trickled out of the room, going to the main lobby of the Compound. Draco found Pepper there with Morgan and Scorpius.
Snape hesitated at first before he nodded.
Harry faked a smile before making his way over to Draco and dragging him to the pool tables, catching the attention of Sirius and Teddy. "They're here." He whispered.
"Yes, you arse, it's a hell yes."
Then the fighting happened. Team Tony had gained two new people, the Black Panther, who happened to be the Wakandan soon-to-be king, T'Challa, and Spider-Man, or the fifteen year old Peter Parker. Team Steve also had Ant-Man, or Scott Lang, and the Winter Soldier, aka Bucky Barnes who says he didn't cause the explosion that killed T'Chaka.
Hermione gasped once she saw who was behind the Polyjuice, "Harry..."
The more she read, the more intrigued she became. None of the other books about Merlin's life had things like him being King Arthur's manservant or having spent days in the stocks because he was an idiot.
Neville laughed then the floo chimed again. Both men looked up to see who it was. This time it was George. A couple seconds after George stepped through, Charlie stepped through.
"March 10, 1917."
"Now if you'll excuse me, I have to fill out more paperwork."
18- Epilogue
Griphook didn't comment and just kept writing.
"Back again so soon, Minister?" The warlock teased.
"Yes," Harry nodded, going back to washing his shirt, "We use Polyjuice to change ourselves into Ministry workers. Then we wreck havoc."
Severus answered this one, "An inheritance test, usually done in a Gringotts bank. If you've met your soulmate, the piece of parchment will tell you their name. If you haven't met them, their name doesn't show up."
"Don't, don't, don't engage,
George nodded and pricked his finger with the knife, letting three drops fall on the parchment. After a couple seconds, ink started forming on the parchment. The goblin took the parchment and looked it over before leading him down to the vaults.
Sam, who was injured hidden in the grass and shrubs, also turned to ashes.
"Every second. But I have you. My beautiful son. If only he could see how amazing you've turned out. When you were a baby, you were definitely your papas boy. You liked him more than you liked me."
"I can't make any promises, but go ahead."
"Malfoy."
Everyone stood back up slowly.
Draco made his way over to the other side of the bed where Arthur was standing. "It's best to leave him be for a couple hours. He most likely won't wake up for a while."
"I need answers." He responded, basically throwing a book aside and moving onto the next one.
"Hmm. What are you gonna say?" Draco asked as he came around, peeking at the book Harry was reading out of to make a potion before peeking into the cauldron. "You need more mushrooms. It's too purple. It's supposed to be a pink by now."
The plan was... not so simple.
Scorpius opened the box and smiled at the blue diamond ring. It was a simple silver band with a simple cut blue diamond.
"What spell was it?" Harry asked, seeing multiple scratches that were oozing blood. He already knew the answer but wanted to make sure he was right.
"Well, Draco does. I never touched anything in your vault unless Draco looked over it and made sure it was fine. He knew you had somethings you'd like to keep private."
Harry took a second raking his brain for some of his favorite names he had found.
There would always be a new adventure around the corner, but this one was coming to an end.
"I couldn't care less about Halloween. It's a crap holiday."
"But it hasn't happened yet!"
"Oh, fuck, uh.." Harry gently set Draco on the floor, making sure his back was facing up, seeing as the bullet hit his backside. "Someone detain him! Who here is a Healer?! We need a Healer!" Although Aurors were trained in simple healing spells, they caught Dark Wizards and chances that Dark Wizards have a gun on them are slim to none so they didn't learn how to heal gunshots. Hannah Abbott, a healer that worked at St Mungo's and that had married Neville Longbottom, ran over and cast some spells, the only one Harry recognized was the diagnostic spell.
"I'll go next," Draco said, "Teddy. I never really liked your parents because my father wouldn't let me get to know your mother, but from what your Gran told me, she was an amazing woman. She would be so, so proud of everything you've done. Your father was my professor in 3rd year, but, again, my father told me he was bad because of what he and his friends did to my godfather. But, I know that that's the complete opposite of how he actually is. Your parents did great things and they are so proud of you. I just know it. I'm so proud of you too. Since watching you say your first words to now. I've always been so proud of you, and I love you. Harry, you're a git for making me love you. I hated you since the moment I met you because I grew up thinking you were a dark wizard, thinking that we were going to be best friends, then you go and make friends with Weasley and Granger and my chances were ruined. These last 45 years have been absolutely amazing, I have loved every minute with you and I know that we're gonna be okay. Even if we die, I know that I have lived a great life since I had you. Thank you for that."
"Merlin. You clotpole. You shouldn't jumped in front of the sword for me."
Draco smiled so widely, "Oh my god."
"Can I teach it how to hold a knife?"
Merlin nodded. "Where's Harry?"
Snape looked at the book in question before grabbing it and opening it, seeing his writing. "How did you find it?"
"I trust you." Harry smiled, "Plus you have the Avengers. This is only if I don't make it back. You don't have to worry that much."
Overseas, a couple minutes earlier, a confused Draco Malfoy, an amazed Teddy Lupin and a once bleeding, but now completely fine Harry Potter landed in London, 83 years in the past and on a different Earth, one with superheroes instead of wizards. Not that they know that. Yet.
"Yes." Harry said, now getting nervous seeing their shocked faces.
The trip back to Earth was quick, like always.
"Okay, I have it," Draco nodded.
Here are some songs that I was listening to while writing this, feel free to listen if you want (right click to open in new tab):
Harry hummed. "Would you ever want to have another kid?"
"Come back soon, okay?" George whispered. "I can't lose another brother."
"Hm. Draco, my love." Harry said. "I love you so much."
"Because while the infinity stones are of life, they were used for death. I have the Deathly Hallows which are of death. I think I can use them to bring everyone back but I don't know how. Merlin, you're the most powerful wizard, you should be able to help me."
Tony gasped, "The two lines of the prophecy."
"Bet? What bet?"
"Yes! I was wondering if you had any new information on what we can do to finally get Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy in Azkaban. Since you are the Head of Magical Law Enforcement, I needed to know if it was possible to get them found quicker."
At that, Draco, Teddy and Sirius' eyes widened.
"Okay. Yeah."
Everyone was silent. Even the children who didn't know Harry that well.
"Lucius, dear. You've got it all wrong. I never tricked Draco. He chose to be with me. He chose to not continue Voldemort's cause! He chose everything! Because now, he's in charge of his own life, not you."
Stark turned to Fury then walked up to the panel next to the cell and entered some codes, causing the cell to open and the cuffs to fall off.
"But you love me!" He giggled.
Draco laughed and gently shoved Harry. "Liar. Scorpius, don't listen to your father. I'm much more put together than he thinks."
One day, Scorpius approached Merlin who was talking to Leon.
"I'm assuming this would be a good time to talk to that dragon?"
"Well, Sir Gwaine, he..." Draco took a breath in, "He brought us all back like the prophecy said he would. He fought Thanos. He took control of the Infinity Stones. But in doing so, he essentially drained his magical core. He's in a coma. We don't know when he's gonna wake up."
Harry wanted to get back to training but everyone advised against it. That, of course, didn't stop him.
The man held his wand to Harry. Harry thought he recognized the wand, but he could be wrong.
"We can't." Rogers said.
The Weasley boy instantly grabbed his wand and a cup of water from inside his desk, splashing it on Draco.
"What do you think they're going to talk about?" Tony asked, breaking the silence.
"If all these terrible things happened, why did you stay?" Arthur questioned.
"What was he stabbed with?"ï¿½ Draco asked.
Romanoff saw this and pulled out a gun, pointing it straight at him, Barton following after him.
"My younger brother. Died trying to get the Horcruxes once he turned against the Dark Lord." Sirius explained.
"When'd that happen?"
"First, can we, y'know." Merlin gestured at his, Arthur's and Gwaine's sleepwear.
