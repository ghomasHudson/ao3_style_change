Just a few more minutes and they were free. The rush of anticipation made Harry stand taller.
the bar had vodka. But no, they had to make it tasteful. It wouldn’t do to have ex-students binge-drink the party away. To be fair, the night was gorgeous, this year’s spring brisk yet warm enough to go out in just a jacket. When he’d crossed the lawn leading to the castle, the scent of freshly cut grass in the cool, humid air had filled him with a pang of nostalgia. He’d been happy here, he thought. In the first years, at least. He’d made his best friends on this lawn, in these classrooms, in the Slytherin dungeons. He’d weathered his first crush for a certain green-eyed, gorgeous menace. He’d loved everything about Hogwarts, everything, even the exquisite pain of Harry Potter’s nearness, even knowing they’d never be friends, they’d never be anything more. These days seemed so carefree, so distant. A different life that had happened to a different person. How had ten years passed so fast? And what did Draco have to show for them? His classmates had last seen him as a pitiful, reluctant, anxiety-ridden Death Easter. This was how they’d remember him. He was afraid that the person he was now, ten years later, wasn’t enough of a redeeming sight.
Draco closed his eyes briefly. How could he phrase it so it wouldn’t be a lie? “Before the war—before Eighth Year, I always thought there would be someone else to choose what I’d do next. I never... let myself think about the future.” He opened his eyes to find everyone watching him.
“Don't remind me!” He hears Hermione’s irritated voice before he sees her. She holds a stuffed unicorn and a miniature Knight Bus that rumbles and smokes like the real thing in one hand, and pushes her bushy curls out of her face with the other.
The room they walk into is much larger. The atmosphere is warmer, darker; all dark wood panelling, thick rugs and a merry fire crackling in a huge fireplace on Harry’s right-hand side. There is a large, elegant mahogany desk in the middle of the room, facing two brown leather club chairs and a high-back, pearl-grey silk upholstered one; the desk and the floor around it are covered with piles and piles of sheets of parchment and leather-bound books.
“Weekend breakfasts are big tradition in this house, Mistor,” she says. “It’s family time for Mistor Draco and
“If I call out right now, you’re in big trouble,” he says in a strangled whisper.
“When Dr Dawson first met Scorpius, she was saying, ‘Scorpius needs a trained nanny, a special nanny who is knowing how to work with

in his hundred lives had made him want to cross the border. He turned to face Harry. “I’m glad I met you, Potter.”
to say it.” He was shaking a bit. Harry took a step back. He nodded carefully, watching Draco from behind his round spectacles, and Draco’s chest ached. “I know you liked him. I didn’t, but it’s no excuse. You have to know—you
“Yes,” Draco concedes. “It’ll take some time to get used to. You’ve been working for me since I came back to London.”
I should stop enabling you. Just go back to the dark hole you call an office, and think of a harder bet, next time.
“feels so good up against me—”
It may come as a surprise to you, but I don’t go around telling everyone everything that’s on my mind at any given time. Even my friends. I had the most ridiculous crush on you for years. I’d just spent the night with you. I needed time to process what happened between us...what could happen after. I wasn’t ready to regale Pansy with stories about your favourite position or the size of your dick.”
Harry looks at Draco through blurry eyes.
“Hey!” Hermione chides softly.
he’d thrown a few dismissive words at Pansy, and
Draco had conveniently forgotten about the addition.
Harry nodded. “Fair enough.” He pushed the Library door and turned to Draco. “Although if you really want a chance to see how your resolution to ‘be better’ could go, we should probably get started. Unless, you know. You want McGonagall to murder us both.”
“You went snooping.”
Harry thought. There was no other way to explain the faint tremor in his chest, the butterflies in his stomach.
“I’d love to believe you, but I’m not sure it’s true. You like being with people, Harry. Companionship would… do you good.” Before Harry can object, she lifts her hand. “Besides, this place is full of unexpected meetings! I’m not the only one who’s run into interesting people.”
“Yes, Headmistress,” Draco said. Harry didn’t speak this time. “We’ve actually done some research. Here,” he pulled a book from his school bag, “this one is called
Draco felt several pairs of curious eyes on him. The Headmistress hadn’t asked to talk to him face to face since the beginning of Eighth Year. Theo lifted an eyebrow. Pansy stared at him with concern. At the other end of the table, Blaise murmured, shaking his head with a small smile, “What have you done this time, Malfoy?”
When they leave, Harry kneels next to Scorpius, takes a look around the devastated study. He wipes the blood off his face with a dirty sleeve. He’s alone in a big, empty house, with a catatonic child and an unconscious dog. He’s certain the loud ringing in his skull can only mean one thing.
“And I intend to spend them shagging you on every available surface of my flat.”
Thanks for sticking with Harry and Draco through this rollercoaster of feels. I hope you enjoy today's chapter <3
is one thing,” Draco snapped back, “but this isn’t mourning, this is you feeling sorry for yourself!”
Only, when Potter is done, his eyes are drawn back to Draco, wide and intense. It’s unsettling. Potter hasn’t looked at him like that in
With a sigh, Draco rode a warmer downward wind current and landed a safe distance from the excited little group surrounding Harry.
“I know what I’m doing. And if all you’re going to do is make me feel shitty about it, then maybe I shouldn’t be here.” He sounds childish and petulant, and maybe that’s just what he is. That’s exactly how he feels when he stomps over to his friends’ fireplace, grabs a pinch of Floo powder and looks over his shoulder. “I’ll see you when either of you is ready to be less of an arse to me.”

It was a high-profile case, too: it had all started when a few nutters had become persuaded that the end of the world was nigh. Not only nigh, but like really,
“During the war, there was one thought that kept nagging me as I read article after article of shite I couldn’t trust. How could one be sure that the person writing it is doing so on their own free will? Or that the person they’ve interviewed is not coerced, bribed, Imperiused, or threatened?" He gave his head a shake. "After the war, I spent three years in a juvenile rehabilitation centre for wizarding delinquents. They allowed a few hours of free activities a day. We could read, play cards or chess, listen to Quidditch games on the wireless. There were also tools and materials available to those of us who felt like working with our hands. Over the course of those three years, I made the Prothimioscope my own little project.”
As if reading Harry’s thoughts, Malfoy has the decency to turn his expression sheepish. He straightens and brushes his suit jacket, pretending to look around.
Draco jerks his head away from Harry's mouth, shoves him back. Harsher than he intended, but he can't believe Harry's said something like this. The fierceness of Harry’s feelings is like an open fire sometimes. Draco’s only going to get burned and
“Thank you,” Malfoy says with a slow, soft smile. He looks pink and so well-fucked, Harry can’t help but feel a little proud. “That’s very gentlemanly of you.”
So they’d ended up with new books to read. They’d agreed to work on it that afternoon after class. Draco had many other,
With Harry’s friends around the table, Draco decided to seize the opportunity to bring up something that had been nagging him since their last day at Hogwarts.
“‘She’s a survivor,’ they’ll say. They’ll make excuses for me. But it’s also so...confining. It’s like being in this gilded cage. If I reach out, if I open up, if I share too much, people get scared. ‘I’m not equipped for this,’ they’ll say. ‘Why don’t you seek professional help?’ But at the end of the day, I’m just
Harry sucks him, standing on all fours above Draco’s spread legs, arse in the air. Draco desperately wants to touch him, yet all he seems to be able to do is pull Harry’s hair tighter, listen to Harry’s soft moans reverberate through his body. Harry sucks him so good, and Draco forgets about his misgivings, fights not to push deeper into Harry’s mouth, so hot and soft. He slides his hands down Harry's neck, rests his palms each side of Harry's face, feeling his own cock bump inside Harry's cheek. His orgasm catches him unawares, steals his breath, too fast. He feels it happen a split second before he can warn Harry, and then he comes. And comes... It’s a long moment, suspended in time, where all he can think of is white-out bliss. Then his arched back falls against the sofa cushions, his pulsing cock still in Harry’s mouth, his hips pushing up in a few last exquisite thrusts.
“Yep. Hagrid said the MacFusty clan in the Hebrides are breeding them. A hybrid of a Welsh Green and Swedish Short-snout. I don’t know how they did the miniaturising, though I imagine it took more than a
Malfoy pushes up on his hands, turning his head to look at Harry over his shoulder. His face is pink and sweaty and ecstatic. He’s moving in time with Harry now, thrust for thrust, skin slapping on skin, little whines of pleasure escaping from his slack mouth. Someone’s grunting and moaning, too — a wanton, abandoned sound that Harry realises is coming from him.
“Mistor—?”
“To put a stop to this travesty of an investigation,” Harry says. Draco snorts, a bitter sound. “I’m serious,” Harry presses on. “What is this parchment for?”
When Slughorn was out of their immediate line of vision, Harry wrote on the corner of Draco's parchment. The gesture spoke of an instinctive intimacy that made Draco yearn for more.
It’s just a job.
With one last irritated glance at Harry, Malfoy slid a few inches down the bench, head resting on the wall behind them, exposing his long, pale throat.
“I don’t
Indeed, it had. They were lying on the floor of the cabin, Harry’s Auror cloak long gone, discarded in one corner of the room or the other. Harry couldn’t remember, despite the protestations of his scratched elbows and knees—a reminder of the last time they’d fucked before sunrise, Malfoy holding him by the hips and pounding him roughly from behind, the both of them moaning as though it was the first time they’d ever fucked and not the fourth already. A soft ray of sunshine was filtering through a crack in the shutters that wasn’t completely filled with snow.
Draco narrowed his eyes. “Didn’t you?”
Well, if we spent more time in the kitchen together…
“It’s your house, Weasley.”
Malfoy places a hand on Harry’s chest, pushes him off. The gesture’s not unkind, but it is firm. Something crumples inside Harry.
Malfoy met his eyes, visibly still unsure, but Harry felt his body relax infinitesimally.
Draco rushed up the path leading to the Hogwarts gates, his breath coming out in small white clouds. It was 4 o’clock; the sun would be setting soon. It had already started its descend towards the horizon, the cold white light of the winter day slowly fading to yellow, then orange, pink, night. Looking up, he could see the half-collapsed silhouette of the Astronomy Tower cutting a dark shape against the golden sky.
good… Harry’s knuckles tighten around the coat rack as he struggles to keep his body still. Malfoy gives an eager moan when Harry’s hips shudder, and Harry gives in to the urge to thrust. He slides a hand around the back of Malfoy’s head and threads his fingers in the feathery soft hair, feeling the bob of Malfoy’s head over Harry’s cock, pushing him down on it, fucking Malfoy’s mouth.
There was an excited sparkle in Harry’s eyes. It was only offset by his smile, guarded and almost shy. Draco was certain his own expression mirrored Harry’s. With their schedules and the fact that Harry seemed to spend every free minute surrounded by his friends, it was their first interaction since their kiss—their many, many passionate, life-altering, unforgettable kisses. Part of Draco’s mind was certain kissing Harry meant something real; the other part was convinced it would all blow up in his face the moment he sought confirmation with Harry.
“Harry wants to make a good impression on his boyfriend’s mum,” Ron sings-songs under his breath.
Hi Harry,
Harry surveyed him from a safe distance of a few feet. A gust of wind swayed their brooms, sending a swathe of hair flying into Harry’s eyes. He lifted a hand to tuck it behind his ear.
Harry! What I
He’s kissing Harry Potter.
who…?’ The benefits of being the Saviour of the Wizarding World, eh? Which means I had double the balls to do it, so the Unspeakables are paying double the rounds next Friday.
“It's okay, honestly,” he shrugged, still smiling that crooked little smile as though he knew a secret Draco didn't. “It was mutual. We weren't really each other's type.”
I think that’s it?
suck him off…
with Longbottom.”
“Coffee?”
On Saturday morning, when Harry steps into the kitchen, he finds Draco’s house-elf already busy cooking breakfast, the kitchen table and countertops a mess of pans, wooden spoons, whisks, coffee grounds and cracked eggshells.
“You don’t know that, darling. You’ve been there for years. He’s probably not felt like this for as long as you have. Give him time.”
“—Malfoy worked at the Ministry? Yeah, mate, he just started,” Ron told him. “My dad found out last week. Penelope Clearwater hired him.”
“He already has a shiny thing of his own,” Luna said, examining the ring again. Jeff squirmed in her hands. He seemed to realise he had just been adopted by a human.
“I’ll leave you young people to help my son celebrate,” she says, retiring for the night. “I had a lovely time.” The word ‘lovely’ seems out of place in her mouth, like she’s at a loss for a more accurate description. Perhaps she is: Harry doubts dinners at Malfoy Manor were ever so… relaxed. There are smears of sauce and wine across the white tablecloth; Blaise is leaning his chair on two legs as he sips his drink with a contented air; Pansy licks the chocolate off her fingers; Hermione scribbles notes in a notepad she produced from Merlin knows where; and Ron’s eyes are slowly closing. Draco’s cheeks are pink, and Harry wouldn’t trade this evening for anything else.
Sorry I asked you to help. You seemed like the best person for it, though. I’ve seen Ron’s handwriting. I don’t trust him with a pencil around my eyes. And you looked like you could handle some more… delicate… er… tasks.
“Okay,” Harry said. “Also, I—er, I brought something.” He rummaged inside his school bag and took out a small pouch of dried fruit and nuts, pouring some into his palm. “I thought it would be nice to have a snack until dinner time,” he added, almost apologetic. He held out his hand to Draco. “I wanted to thank you for the chocolate truffles the other day, and these always remind me of Christmas.”
Draco stifled a groan. His cock twitched at the sense memory. Lucifer, he was already hard inside his pyjamas. If he could just touch himself—just get this over with, just get it out of his system...
-Millicent Bulstrode
“Why didn’t you?” she asked quietly.
But peaceful and strong might never happen… and Draco makes an impulse decision. Fuck it. Fuck
I didn’t expect to encounter a familiar face, let alone find that familiar face on stage. At least, I
The scratching of the Quick-Quotes Quill on the floating parchment was the only sound in the room until it finished writing down the last sentence.
“Hey, don't say that,” he still tells Ron once his flash of irrational anger ebbs away.
That’s all. I’m at a loss what to say. If you don’t want to see me again… I could understand.
“I can sneak around unnoticed, and I’m nosier than a Niffler on a diet of wet paper towels.”
“Draco—”
“Then get on with it,” Harry growls, and rip Malfoy’s t-shirt off. With a few frantic, grunting motions, they undress each other, clothes getting tossed to the side of the bed. Then Harry wraps his hand around the back on Malfoy’s neck, and pulls him down next to him.
He’d almost given in. Had almost grabbed Malfoy by the collar of his expensive shirt and kissed him right then and there. It would have been a terrible mistake, probably. Quite a scandalous one, too—”Wizarding World Savior and Quidditch Star Harry Potter Kisses Ex-Nemesis Draco Malfoy At Hogwarts Class Of ‘98 Reunion!” would be spread across every bloody front page the next day—but in that moment, that hot, frustrating, delicious moment, Harry hadn’t given the scandal much thought.
“And we wouldn’t have ickle First Years visiting us here if our common room wasn’t open for the occasion,” Pansy added, directing a toothy grin towards the First Year boy who lingered near the fire. With an alarmed yelp, the little boy scurried away.
He cursed his lack of brain-to-mouth filter. He was going to have to go through with this.
There had been no documentation on how Malfoy had dealt with that tragedy. The Auror reports had remained factual to the point of clinical. They usually did.
Draco reaches up, hand in Harry’s hair, and brings his face down to kiss him.
to do something? Do I look like the kind of parent who would force his child to do something?”
“Here. This isn’t right. If you compute this formula with the affinity index you have here, your people skills rating will never be applied correctly. And have you taken your foreign language proficiency into account?”
Malfoy doesn’t do any of that.
Smith is talking, and Harry pricks his ears up to listen.
you’re familiar? Nobody could be that… blond. With a face that pointy. And an accent that posh. And legs that skinny.
Malfoy’s face remains set, irritatingly unreadable. “No, Potter. I assume it was a last-minute invitation, and they scrambled to find a free seat for you, because you’re here alone.”
“You make damn sure I feel like there’s no room for me in your life.”
“Gay sex lesson number one, Potter,” he says, whipping out his wand. “Pull your cock out when there’s still time
I still don’t feel I did, ten years later.
“Erm,” Longbottom chimed in. “I actually came to get Luna for a minute. We received fresh
his back against the covers, his mind reeling, reeling, with worry and threadbare hope.
Draco’s eyes are shining in the darkness. “I can’t do this anymore, Harry,” he says, defeated. “It’s over.”
“Shove off yourself, Potter,” Draco outright laughs and puts a hand on Harry’s chest, pushing lightly.
Then Draco does. He’s next to him in an instant, a warm hand on Harry’s shoulder.
So he straightens up, and turns around.
Oh, dear Lucifer. Harry had been so close last night. His skin had looked so real, so soft. It was for the best that Draco had been so tongue-tied, or he would have slid his hands into Harry’s hair, his stupid, ridiculous bird’s nest of a mop of hair, and he would have pulled him in for a proper kiss.
“It’s not the same,” he said, voice low.
“Oh, Merlin, will you shut up!” He put his hand over her mouth, muffling her cackle. Above his palm, her eyes sparkled with glee. He narrowed his eyes at her. “Pansy. How much do you know?”
“Fine,” he says, happy to give up his callow grudge already. “I’m sorry I left in a huff yesterday. That was very childish of me, and I felt like an arse afterwards. I know you and Ron mean well, and… you’re probably not wrong.”
ensured their conversation stayed private. It was the perfect configuration for a discussion about the future of the Boy Who Lived and the youngest Death Eater alive. “I counted about forty-three different personality tests we could take to determine our ideal careers.” He gave Draco a conspiratorial little smile. “You were right. McGonagall doesn’t have a clue what she asked us to do.”
This time, Harry laughs. He throws his head back, barely feeling the cold rain. “Fine. Don’t say it. I don’t need you to tell me, I just needed you to know.”
“Minister Shacklebolt will be with you any minute.”
“That would be lovely, but I had other ideas in mind.” Malfoy’s words would have been painfully casual if he hadn’t sounded so devastated. He turned, pushing his naked arse flush against Harry’s groin. All the air left Harry’s lungs.
That evening, Harry walks into the Eldridge House early. Only a few guests — donors — are here, gliding from room to room and chattering in the polite, stilted way of people who’ve joined a party before it had time to warm up. A few photographers mingle among them, looking like hyenas on the prowl. Harry frowns when one of them spots him and flashes a picture.
So Harry just walks to the bay windows lining the side of the waiting room that overlook the Atrium.
“I’m really glad. Thank you, Ernestina,” Harry says. He makes an effort to stand tall and upright as he is hit by contradicting waves of sadness and relief. And underneath, dread — that Draco’s made his decision about Harry, that he’s meeting him one final time before sending him away, discarding him along with the memories of their disastrous shared past.
Luna tore her gaze away from the hypnotic spin of the Prothimioscope and blinked. “Oh. I thought the newspaper contacted me because of my work. And Neville’s job. They’re much more interesting than the war, really.”
“Unspeakable,” Draco says to his mother over Harry’s shoulder, an explanation. Narcissa nods.
“One thing I think all our readers are interested to know, Luna, is how you moved on after the war. Do you want to tell me more about that?”
“Come here,” Draco whispers, out of breath. “Come for me.”
The sarcasm, sadly, comes a bit too close to the truth. Harry has a pocket full of Galleons and Sickles he hasn’t earned. Galleons and Sickles that are waiting to be spent at the bar to support the charity of the day — in addition to the sizable donation Harry’s already made by owl post. Harry slides a glance at Ron. Unlike Harry, Ron’s taking the time to savour the taste of the eighteen-year-old single malt he’s selected for the both of them. The difference is that Ron’s
“I like every bloody version of you,” Harry growls, wrapping his arms around his waist and bringing him flush against him. “You damned fool,” he adds, a whisper in Draco’s ear.
“Yeah, yeah, you’re positively huge, I get it,” he says. “Fortunately, I have enough experience in that area.”
“Okay,” Harry says with good grace. He steps aside. “Come on in.”
does he?
enquiring about my dear friend Draco, that’s all.
Draco felt himself blush. Heaven dammit. He let his shoulders drop with a huff.
This day has been… the worst day.
“It was brilliant. I’m so happy your assistant called me to schedule this interview.” She got up and drifted off toward the kitchen. Draco hurriedly stuffed the rolls of parchment and the quill in his satchel. He snatched the Prothimioscope from the floor and followed her.
Hand on his mouth, Harry stifled a laugh. “If I’d known you were this bad at flirting, I would have done this instead of challenging you with duels and fights all these years.”
he’s thinking about. Jesus, who’d have thought?
For a moment, they just look. The silence stretches on, and still Harry can’t tear his gaze away from Malfoy’s. His brain desperately searches for a topic of conversation. Which is ridiculous, because Malfoy hired Harry to be his bodyguard. Not his conversation partner.
So he reaches the top, panting slightly, and heads for the Minister’s office.
Malfoy turns his back to Harry, tossing the tin foil container in the bin under the sink and washing his fork. Harry’s gaze travels down the long line of Malfoy’s back. His movements are deft, strong shoulders jutting under the cashmere jumper, dark jeans hugging the pert curves of his arse. God, Malfoy’s so— infuriating. So… gorgeous. Harry wants to drape himself over Malfoy’s back like a snug blanket. Wants to push up against him and bend him over the sink—
Legs for
And then Harry had said his name against his neck, half-moan and half-whisper.
Was it the Snitch? Could Malfoy hold Harry’s unwillingness to share that personal bit of history against him? Or had he been hurt by Harry’s wish to keep their relationship under wraps? Malfoy couldn’t very well expect Harry to run to the press and make a big official announcement about them, could he? They’d only seen each other a couple of times — and none of these times had been planned. Until the last night they’d spent together, Harry hadn’t seriously envisaged being involved with Malfoy in any way. It wasn’t until Malfoy had settled in Harry’s kitchen, and later, in his bed, that Harry had let himself dream of starting something more with the man.
Merlin, even thinking the word makes him cringe. He’s a twenty-five year old man, after all. Isn’t it all mostly mechanical, at his age?
When he looked up again, the ravens were gone.
He turned sharply just as the two men were walking in the living room, winter cloaks casually flung over their shoulders and carrying crates filled with potted plants and boxes of seeds.
to be noticed, to be stared at, for his looks to be commented upon. What with his outfits, each tighter and more revealing than the next. What with his hair, its colour so unique, all soft-looking strands falling in his eyes. What with his rings, and his impeccably polished nails, and that rainbow badge always pinned to his shirt or jacket. What with his trademark drawl, more languid than it had sounded at Hogwarts. Silky. His posture, back straight, chin held high, narrow hips swaying lightly when he walks, as if to say
“It did happen, though, didn’t it? And maybe it was for the best. It’s the one single thing that forced me to face the choices I’d made. Forced me to make new ones.”
(Harry can’t quite believe he got Malfoy all the way here) — Harry traps the bag of takeaway under a stasis spell. He sneaks off to shower while Malfoy gets settled in the kitchen — Draco Malfoy, in Harry’s kitchen! — and returns wearing freshly laundered jeans and a jumper.
So it’s pub night tonight and all, but I was wondering if you’d like to go out for dinner instead?
But blaming Malfoy for being… well,
“Oi, where you goin’?” Seamus Finnigan called from near the fireplace. A little group of Eighth Years had gathered on the sofa and chairs and were watching Ron Weasley beat Dean Thomas at Wizarding Chess. The entire common room glittered with silver and gold ornaments, enchanted snow and twinkling fairy lights. Hannah Abbott’s CD player spilled Muggle Christmas songs. Odd as they sounded, they contributed nicely to the haphazard, festive holiday cheer of the room.
“We were just about to,” Luna said, cheerful and seemingly unaware of the tense atmosphere. “Draco was telling me about the Prothimioscope and how he came to invent it. If only we had this back when the
That’s how Harry ends up in Draco’s study that evening, with a glass of champagne in one hand, a canape in the other, and the most improbable assortment of people he could imagine around him: Draco, his mother, Pansy and Blaise Parkinson-Zabini, Ron and Hermione. There’s also Ernestina and Scorpius, adding their slightly perplexing presence to the mix. Next to the sofa, on the lookout for fallen crumbs of canapes, Balzac lies on the floor, tail wagging.

standards,
“Let’s have it out, once and for all,” Draco drawls. He sounds more confident than he feels. A matter of survival, when it comes to being in the presence of Harry Potter. “Since there’s a chance we’re going to be working in the same building for the rest of our lives.” He blows his fringe out of his eyes. “I want to hear you say it. Does it bother you that I am gay?”
He’d recognised what Harry was doing, perhaps before Harry saw it himself.
Malfoy is waiting for him patiently, arms folded over his chest. “So?” He tilts his chin when he sees Harry.
“Okay.” Despite Hermione's admonishment, Harry laughs. “You do talk about it like it’s a car.” The pushchair sits folded against the leg of the kitchen table, and little Hugo bats his arm, trying to reach it. Hermione laughs, a soft, domestic sound, and ruffles her son’s hair as the baby squeals in delight. Something about the scene tugs at the corner of Harry’s subconscious, but he can’t pinpoint it. The kettle whistles, and he loses track of his thoughts.
“Oh.”
Malfoy was grinning in earnest now, eyes flicking to Harry, as if uncertain whether he should meet his eyes or firmly look away. Merlin, how long had it been since he’d looked at Malfoy from this close? He’d forgotten—he’d forgotten how
“Not at all. Do you?”
“Never been here before?” Harry asked, stopping beside him.
“Yes. You told me about you, and Ginny, and how she was dating Luna, and how you preferred men...” Draco knew he was blushing but he pushed his bashfulness away and trudged on, “and I think it would have been a good opportunity for me to be honest with you about something too.”
Eventually they’d lifted themselves off the floor. Draco had grumbled he was too old for those kinds of antics, and Harry had laughed. Draco’d slid him a look and a pleased little half-smile, and had led him back to his bedroom, to his bed.
“May I help?” Malfoy asks.
“You’re killing me,” he gritted.
“I can see you really want it,” he mused. “Shall I ask Mephisto about giving it to you? Wonder how he’d like to hear his
at him, calm as you please—Malfoy pushed his cloak back and pulled his wand from its holster. He pointed it at the door.
Every Saturday now, Harry has breakfast with him, Scorpius and Ernestina. The four of them share comforting, hearty food and cups of hot tea while planning the day ahead. Ernestina throws appraising glances between him and Harry, and Draco guiltily hopes the house-elf has no Legilimency powers, or he’s in for the dressing-down of his life. Harry patiently listens to Scorpius tell him about the new Chopin piece he’s practicing — this month’s new favourite — and nods in all the right places even though he obviously doesn’t know the first thing about classical music.
“Oh, I definitely plan to have a good time,” Hermione says with a decided grin. She links her arm with Ron’s and pulls him off the stool and towards the dancefloor. Ron follows with a resigned look, his meekness undermined by the fact that he’s already shimmying his hips to the music. A trail of flashes follows them, the journalists too busy with the two more interesting members of the Golden Trio to notice the third one making his exit.
Draco flinched at the noise. Lifting his head from his pillow, he checked that his roommates were all still fast asleep: Longbottom was sprawled on his stomach, head almost buried under his pillow; Blaise was snoring on his back with his arms crossed over his chest
“Draco, I have tremendous respect for your work. If I let anyone write anything about me, it would be

around them. Draco felt the tingling wave of magic surround him. All of the sudden, the atmosphere was as warm and cosy as if they'd been sitting directly by the fire. Draco remembered finding Harry by the fireplace yesterday.
Harry gives a fond, long-suffering sigh, and sits down in front of the hearth. “No one can reproach you for not getting to the point,” he says. Hermione has a talent for jumping right in, all business. “So, the Society for the Protection of Acromantula and Magical Tarantulas. SPAT, right? Tell me again why I should care about giant spiders who tried to murder me when I was a kid?”
Harry breathed out through his mouth and nodded. “Yeah. Alright. Sorry, you... I was surprised.” He made a whiny little sound and settled his hands more firmly against the door. “Keep—keep doing it. Please.”
Draco. You had me so worried you had some sort of skeleton in the wardrobe. I can't believe you have to hide this. You’ve kept this a secret for years. ”
And Jesus, can the man take a cock. Harry can’t tear his eyes from Malfoy’s bouncing arse, the pliant line of his back, the way he arches into Harry’s thrusts and moans wantonly, like Harry’s cock is the most divine thing that’s ever happened to him… And Harry wonders, with a sense of fearful curiosity, what a cock in his arse would feel like. If Malfoy would ever agree to initiate Harry with that most foreign, forbidden of pleasures.
He folded his cloak over the back of his chair and leaned closer to Harry.
There are rumours at the Ministry. Lucius Malfoy chased his own son out of their home, people say. Found in a compromising position. Mother visits him in secret when father is traveling.
“You know my only goal in life is to ruin your plans,” Draco shrugged with feigned nonchalance. “Although I agree it’s a shame that you came here today of all days, what with the nice wide-open schedule you must have.”
late, too. Do you know who else went to bed ridiculously late?”
consolidating
Of course his oldest friend would pick that special seat for their last official meeting.
It’s like the sum of all of Harry’s worries, questions, and trepidation since Malfoy left are materialising in those few curt words. Harry can tell Malfoy is doing his best to act detached, nonchalant, even. But the cool glare of his eyes speaks of something much more personal. Malfoy’s upset. He’s hurt.
Drake O’Malley,
*~*~*
“Shacklebolt listens to his advisors. And one of them is Smith.”
“Cold, eh? I wonder if permanent Warming Charms are part of the renovation plan of Hogwarts.”
“As much as I love the reminder of how empty my life is, with or without a romantic partner in it…” Harry interrupts them before the whole room decides it’s a good time to eavesdrop, “...it, er, might be getting better.”
“But…” Harry’s insides go cold with the thought, “...they could still find you. They could still try to silence you somehow. None of them know what you do… right?”
Because I’m done with lies.
Draco looks at Harry over his shoulder. Just here to get some running clothes and go change in his rooms. He looks expectant, slightly puzzled, like it’s Draco who’s lost the plot. Like he hasn’t torn Draco’s world apart, turned it on its head. Always reminding Draco of the harsh reality of their situations, the unbridgeable gap between the Golden boy and the ex-Death Eater, the spy and the suspect, Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy.
He was mulling this over in the Library while slowly flipping through his
“All right?”
“Right,” Auror Boyle says. She opens her mouth, the slight hesitation of those who’ve never had to arrest a house-elf before. When she finally speaks, though, it’s evident she’s at least checked some of her facts. “Ernestina Yolanda Maria Ramirez Granado, you are under arrest for obstructing an investigation and for failure to comply with Auror orders. You are also suspected of participating in a potentially illegal business.”
Draco handed her a quill. She signed at the bottom of the scroll in the same loopy, diligent handwriting that Draco remembered from their childhood days. The parchment folded itself into a crane and took off. It flew in a low, graceful circle above their heads, then disappeared with a faint pop. Luna looked at Draco, amused.
Malfoy leans his chin on Harry’s shoulder with all the proprietary ease of a housecat. “Yes,” he breathes, like he relishes the word. “Tell me what you want, Potter.”
He didn't mean for Harry to see it. He’d forgotten about it. These days, he never has to hide it. His team knows him. They know everything there is to know about who he used to be. Most of the time, the Mark is hidden under his long-sleeved shirts, just so he doesn’t have to think of it.
“Origami is an undervalued Muggle art,” Draco smiled back. He snapped his fingers and the Quick-Quotes Quill sprang to life next to him. It hovered half an inch over a floating sheet of parchment, quivering with anticipation. “Ready when you are,” he told Luna.
Draco is quietly putting his clothes in order when Harry’s eyes fall on the parchments strewn across the floor, the rolls previously neatly stacked on the desk thrown off balance by their fucking. His mind flashes to a similar scene from months ago — Harry walking in the empty office, rolls of parchment falling to the floor, one of them catching his attention.
Draco didn’t need a reminder. He didn’t need a reminder of his own inaptitude as a demon, and he didn’t need a reminder of the ticking of passing time, of his numbered days in this life until he had to start everything all over again, and again, forever.
And Harry hadn’t moved from where he stood.
“You know about the shelter? You did do your homework, Potter!” He heard Malfoy’s mocking voice behind him, muffled by the howling wind. “And here I thought you made it through five years in the Aurors by being the Chosen One and looking pretty!”
“The reason is that I’m a war criminal.”
Draco caught up with Ginny, the others on his heels. When he saw him, Jeff ran to him and fell on his knees, gripping Draco’s bootlaces pleadingly.
this song!” she says. She puts the record on and tipsily hums along, gliding out in the garden where they all greet her with hoots and cheers. She opens her arms, face lifted towards the black, starry sky, and roars,
“If they’re hiding in there and we find them… the case is over. We’ve solved it.”
“What brings you here? For real,” he speared the Niffler with a hard look. “You never check in on me, even less so visit me inside the castle.”
I don’t think I want to meticulously think of
“I cannot believe—” Matilda laughs.
“Precisely.”
on earth did you get a dragon?”
The picture is slightly unfocused, a short, apparently uneventful moment captured on paper and running on a loop. Yet Harry would recognise that white-blond hair and those sharp, pointy features anywhere.
Harry’s head snaps up. So does Malfoy’s. Two deer frozen in headlights, only one is on his knees and the other still has his spent, softening cock out.
“I haven’t said anything,” Harry says with a small smile, “and anyway, I would imagine other kinds of ‘guests’ might not need a guest room.”
“Draco—I’m not—going to last,” he said haltingly. Draco thrilled with the strain in Harry’s voice.
“Ernestina is told Mistor Potter, sir,” she sighs. “You can be family… if only you want to.”
“Alarms? Plural?”
And now that Draco’s here, bathed in the soft afternoon glow, turning the dreary hospital room brighter, Harry can’t bring himself to regret it.
Harry wants him.
“So you've definitely taken this evening’s dose?” Draco looked over his reading glasses at Harry.
“No.”
Harry—do you even realise how long I—?” He threw his hands up in defeat. “You know what? This isn't the time or place to sort this out. I've work to do; now, if you'll excuse me.”
Harry smiled and touched the back of his hand. He nodded towards the career books.
“Maybe you should consider changing your logo,” Harry suggests. As soon as the words are out, five pairs of eyes turn towards him. The only person who seems to have no idea what they’re talking about is Ron, who shrugs from the other side of the table. Harry squirms in his chair. “I mean… it’s rather ominous, isn’t it? The snake, the wand shooting sparks?...”
your talents, then?”
As required by the betting rules, she successfully made Plinius Thompson, Head of the Department of Mysteries and blandest person to ever walk this earth, sing
“I bet you could even make me beg.”
Uh. It’s been a couple of days, and you haven’t replied to my last letter. Are you all right?
And Draco wonders, not for the first time since Harry Potter showed up in his life again, exactly how worth it is playing this game against Harry, at the cost of endangering his heart.
“Yes. Fuck, Draco.
“Would you say diving into the massive task that awaited you after the war helped you move on, then?”
Draco felt his cheeks pink. He cleared his throat. “This is how the Prothimioscope works in a nutshell: it spins as long as the author of the article or, in the case of an interview, their respondent, is writing or speaking of their own free will. Readers have become wary of the press. There was so much misinformation during the war—even before it, if you think about it. Today, the Prothimioscope acts like a warranty. Readers are at least assured that the people involved are fully consenting to what is written.”
Draco shuffled his question cards, looking for the next thing to say. There was an odd lump in his throat that made it harder for him to speak right away. After a pause, he asked in a rather raspy voice, “Apologies for another personal question, but our readers are keen on finding out more about your relationship with Neville Longbottom. You’re one of England’s favourite celebrity couples. They even have a name for you: Luneville. Did you know that?”
“What?” Draco snaps.
of his initial assets. A company like Caduceus must have required a very substantial investment to get started. Our experts at the Ministry estimate the initial investment at around three million Galleons.”
Harry thinks. This time, thankfully, he keeps the words to himself. He just scoots his arse further down the seat, casting a nervous glance at the other guests in the darkened opera box.
And so Draco folds himself onto the sofa, pulls Harry by the belt until he’s standing between Draco’s open legs. He shivers when he looks up at Harry. There’s something overwhelmed, almost painful in Harry’s face. When he reaches down to cup Draco’s cheek, slide his thumb over a cheekbone, Draco closes his eyes.
Draco takes a breath, head spinning. He can handle this. He can —
The moment was warm, easy, intimate. Something had shifted in their friendship. Draco couldn’t tell if it had happened tonight, or if it had been months, maybe years in the making.
But Malfoy…
Harry wants to snap, before realising how revealing that would be. How many of Harry’s secrets Malfoy seems to read so plainly, when Malfoy is still a mystery.
“Happy birthday,” he tells Draco. He must look like a lovesick idiot, and doesn’t care one bit.
Malfoy pulled away with a gentleness that set something loose in Harry’s chest. His glasses were fogged up and slightly askew.
“Harry…” Malfoy says, the syllables long and full of promise, “...I want you to fuck me.”
Draco looks up. It’s as if all the tiny threads of tension they’ve both been trying to ignore ever since they realised they fancied each other, ever since they touched each other, are materialising into a sudden, crushing weight. It’s this feeling of being out of control — unable to control the outcome of the case the Ministry is building against him, the case he has to trust Harry with… and also unable to control how he feels about Harry. Reckless, insatiable. Like he’s running down a hill, gathering speed, unable to stop. There’s a low buzz in his head, and Draco wants it to end — to go back to the light, lovely kisses of a minute ago.
“No, it’s not,” Harry says. “But she’s in it with you, if I can’t bring proof to the Ministry that we can solve the case.”
is not something Ron ever is. Not with Harry, anyway.
I don’t understand why Daddy would make it a surprise. (I dislike surprises. They break the routine. They give me little frights. But I noticed some people like them. It makes them feel ‘special’, Nestine once explained.) (I feel plenty special on my own, thank you very much.) Also. Isn't a surprise only when the other person doesn't know it’s coming? Harry must know. After all, last Wednesday, he took me to the same shop as Daddy did the Saturday before. (Bright. Loud. People. Why do they insist on taking me along with them?) (But the shop is muted. Low voices. Flitting gazes. I like it.) Harry looked at the rings. He asked me what colour Daddy would prefer. (The answer is silver.)
Harry swallowed.
“No,” Harry said, mulish frown firmly in place. It still sounded like a ‘yes’ to Draco. Draco drew a breath, trying to collect himself. As much as he loved Harry, Harry needed to hear this from him.
Hand flying over his cock, Harry pressed his heels onto Malfoy’s shoulders, pushing him back a little. “I am, just—come on, Malfoy” he taunted, “come on, fuck me harder, I know you have it in you, you stupid hot—”
He can’t let Harry go.
Harry shifted and turned his back to Draco, his hands on the butcher block and his bare arse in the air.
His satchel on the floor, propped against the wall.
Lavender had hooted. ‘
“Only on weekends, Mistor,” she says. “Weekends are for family.”
Malfoy leans over Harry to turn the light off. “Maybe I’ll make you live up to that promise tomorrow morning, then,” he whispers.
“Kiss me.”
Draco laughed. “Good call, Potter.”
Are you saying my long, delicate gay fingers are better equipped to put make-up on you?
“I’m going to assist George at the shop,” Ron said. “He needs the help. The business is slowly picking up again... and Mum says the days are long sometimes and it can get lonely in there. A little company can’t hurt.”
But in the end, there was only ever one answer he could give. So he does.
“Merry Christmas, Harry.”
“Sure. Need help carrying this downstairs?”
Pansy and Blaise are the first to arrive in a flourish of stylish fashion, expensive perfumes and intricately wrapped gifts. Blaise looks dashing in a perfectly cut sky blue suit; Pansy looks like a caricature of a Parisian, all red lipstick, fashionable high heels, and sophisticated black bob. They make a show of stopping short when Harry appears in the doorway.
Shhh. I’m the one doing the interview here.
“Is it… is it true?” he asks softly, still too loud. He can hear his breath in his ears.
“You said ‘Harry’! Not ‘Potter,’ ‘Harry’!” Parvati squeaks.
They climbed the final steps to the Fourth Floor. Harry’s expression turned serious.
It was like going simultaneously blind and deaf. Harry was surrounded by disorienting darkness and silence. Only Malfoy’s breath, slightly raspy, remained, grounding him in their new reality.
It’s fucking unfair. Draco, this whole situation is fucking unfair. You deserve… God, you deserve so much better than what you’re getting.”
Harry hears a fast, irregular
So seeing Malfoy again — in the middle of the Ministry cafeteria, no less — was a strange kind of shock. Less strange than seeing him bent over in a room full of weirdly attentive women, of course, but Harry was curious.
He strides over and grabs Malfoy’s wrist. The grip is forceful — more so than Harry intended — and Malfoy opens his hand with a grunt. Whatever he was holding clatters against the metallic foot of the rack and rolls away on the carpet. Harry catches gold and silver from the corner of his eye. Galleons. Sickles. A glinting pocket watch — platinum?
“Now, Draco. Fuck me.
“Thank you,” he places a hand on her shoulder as he walks past her. She looks up at him, still not convinced he can handle himself.
Draco, holding the pose and standing very still, carefully turns his head to look at the intruder.
“How do you feel this is going so far?” He asked, nodding towards his mother and Andromeda deep in conversation.
The Prothimioscope kept spinning.
But irritation couldn’t kill a demon, so Mephistopheles was still here.
“They’re happy for us.”
Harry elbows Draco once his mother has left.
when he realised they had arrived in front of the gargoyle guarding the Headmistress’s office.
“They’ll assign another team of Aurors on it, probably. Smith is the Financial Auditing Director. He holds no police power.”
Harry watches the scene for a moment, unsure if he should interrupt. Ask Malfoy if he needs him, or go back to his rooms. He feels the house-elf’s wary eyes on him, and he clears his throat.
“Sure, Malfoy,” Potter said, rolling his eyes. “So you’ve come to the reunion to brag about your perfection, then?”
...and
Fuck, he was panting, and Harry was, too. His breath was so hot against Draco’s face...so hot. Scorching. Draco realised he had moved close enough to see the flecks of gold in Harry’s irises.
“Sure, it wasn’t.” Draco snatched a piece of toast and bit into it.
in the middle of a Muggle street. He thought he’d been on time, but maybe it was best not to start the day by contradicting her.
has openly and ostentatiously done what Harry, for all his legendary Gryffindor bravery, has never admitted to anyone but himself.
Hermione cut him off gently. “For once, he chose something
“Oi! I was making this into a sandwich.”
“Mistor wants to give me his coat, sir?” The house-elf asks courteously.
Draco Malfoy is photographed walking out of the building, the large silhouette of another man looming over him as he opens the door of a sleek black car parked a few feet away. The scene lasts for all but two seconds before the photograph loops back to Malfoy walking out of the building again.
you.”
she hisses at him with a meaningful look, as if he could commiserate.
No, Draco had been wrong before.
“Luna could come back at any minute.” Draco whined and pushed Harry off.
Malfoy, on the other end, seemed caught between embarrassment and bravado. “Shall you lead the way, then?”
Of course not.”
Draco.”
“Here. Months ago. I’d picked it up because it looked so out of place… The font, the foreign language… I didn’t realise why until a minute ago.”
Harry pushed his hands deeper in his pockets and hung his head.
He carefully put a few extra inches of space between himself and Malfoy.
Harry shook his head, the incredulous laughter still on his lips. He strode up to Malfoy, took his face in his hands and kissed him. The same slow, purposeful kiss that he’d given him a minute before they’d fucked. This time, sated, happy—god, he was happy, wasn’t he?—Harry wanted to give their kiss a new meaning. One he hadn’t fleshed out in detail, but that he wanted to say
he thinks wryly. “Thank you for worrying about me, my dear Ernestina.”
“Draco Malfoy,” Auror Boyle’s words echo in the quiet study. Her voice is trembling, barely — but Harry hears it nonetheless. “You are under arrest for obstructing an investigation and attacking a Ministry official.” She takes a breath, casting a quick, apologetic glance at Harry and Scorpius. Then her eyes turn to Draco once more. “I’ll ask you to follow us without making more of a scene. You are entitled to a lawyer and a firecall once we arrive on Ministry premises.”
“No one,” Draco pretended to be absorbed in his search. There had to be a magical solution to his quest for the perfect career—or Harry’s. Harry, at least, had a future career to plan for. He eyed Pansy, who was tapping her foot as though she expected an answer. “What?” he snapped.
“Down, Balzac,” Ernestina tells him. “Leave Mistor Potter alone.”
his mind keeps churning over and over.
Potter marches to Draco’s desk while Draco makes room for the box. He doesn’t have to look up to know that his colleagues are watching the scene like thirsty hawks. Ever since their last collective encounter with Potter, when that green-eyed spoilsport had walked in on the entire DLF striking sexy poses for fun, Draco has not had a minute of peace. ‘
His second thought.
Malfoy pulled out with a filthy wet sound, his long, thick cock pink and gleaming in the darkness. Sitting on his knees, he grabbed Harry by the hips and pulled, leveled him up with his pelvis. Harry squirmed, frustrated, as Malfoy studied his arsehole, which he imagined fluttering, swollen and glistening with lube. By the hungry, focused look on Malfoy’s face, he was certainly right. Because Malfoy lined up his cock again and slid slowly, impossibly,
Luna’s pale eyes were fixed on Draco, waiting for more. He sat straighter, gazing at the spinning device.
“We will. We’ll get that coffee,” Harry confirmed, grinning like an idiot. “Tell you what—it’ll be our reward if we solve this case.”
“Yes, you were. It sounded Muggle. It sounded like this,” she said, and started singing just loud enough for Draco to shush her in embarrassment:
Draco thinks of being eleven, holding out his hand, hoping for the best — and seeing his offer for friendship turned down in the most humiliating way.
and a burst of childish laughter startled them out of their thoughts.
Whatever such a person is supposed to look like.
“I have noticed,” Harry’s breath tickled his neck again before he sat back with a smug smile. “Get ready to have your mind blown.”
“Sorry.” Harry did not look sorry at all. He looked smug and well-shagged. Draco was so elated, he could have floated to the ceiling had Harry not been anchoring him with the strong weight of his arms around his waist. “At least you got to
Pansy snorts into her glass of wine.
Then he sleeps on it fitfully, and wakes up in the morning with the same silent ache in the pit of his stomach, the same heavy longing.
Harry realises he’s staring at Malfoy once again. The grey eyes are downcast and hard, the jaw set and proud. In the soft, inviting light of Harry’s kitchen, he looks vulnerable and lost. Harry’s heart squeezes with a painful little jolt that has nothing to do with pity and everything to do with recognition. Harry had always thought Malfoy had it better than him at Hogwarts, but seeing just a glimpse of the constrained, pressured life he’d been forced to lead makes him reconsider that belief.
The Christmas tree near the grandfather clock is so tall. Taller than Daddy. Nestine Leviosa’d the golden star perched on the tallest branch. Fourteen (No.) (Fifteen.) gifts on the floor under it. Shiny, pretty paper. Garlands of lights wrapped around the tree. Turned off. I touch it. (Tiny lightbulb. Round, smooth under my fingers. Satisfying.) The lights flicker on. Magic is cool. (Sometimes.)
“They told me about the series of articles. I read the ones you’ve published so far. I really liked them. When they said
“And what would that be?” Harry asked, patiently.
“My apologies. I was joking. I shouldn’t even be here. I assure you, this floor is yours. No one shall disturb you when you’re here.” Malfoy meets Harry’s eyes again. “I just wanted to check that you’re… settling in okay.”
And honestly, that one would open a whole can of Flobberworms Harry isn’t ready to examine too closely.
, Harry, it's a sodding
Draco totally slipped him the tongue. Harry looked like he couldn’t. Get. Enough. ‘For a bet’, my arse. They’re LOVING IT.

Then Scorpius puts his hands on the keyboard, holds them there for a second, and starts playing.
Meander down the corridor, push the door open. Daddy’s study. Bright. Warm. Thick rugs everywhere. Embers in the fireplace, glowing from last night. The dragon and unicorn chair, repaired. The sofa, new cushions, comfy throw pillows. Daddy and I put all the records back on the shelves in September, before school started (Daddy said he had a
“How did you make him learn to play that way?”
“You alright, Draco? You look a little pale,” Harry said, his smile wilting in concern. He flew down to Draco’s level, hand held out. Draco stood very still, willing his broom to behave. He would not let Harry touch him again; experience showed Harry’s touch tended to turn Draco into a flustered, babbling fool. It was just unfitting of a Malfoy and of a professional demon. “I mean,” continued Harry, this time with a tiny crooked smile, “you always look pale. I was wondering—”
“Are you plotting my murder now?” Malfoy’s mocking drawl snapped him out of his—whatever what had just happened was.
“Yeah,” Ron smiled wistfully, “‘S’not like Harry had many opportunities to see the world before now.”
“They haven’t found out for years. They won’t find out now.” Draco studies Harry with narrowed eyes. “Unless you snitch.”
“Oh, so you’re doing this out of the goodness of your heart? Do I look like a charity case to you?”
him, and he can’t quite believe his luck.
“Merlin, LOOK! Oh no, somebody help him!”
He feels sharp, abject relief at Potter’s approval.
That’s how he ends up in the darkened corner of an opera box on Saturday night, an empty seat next to him.
Seeing the rest of the house, Harry would have surmised that the Malfoy heir’s private space would be as neat and tidy as his father’s. But there’s no other way to put it: Scorpius’s room looks exactly like any other kid’s room Harry has ever seen.
“Well,” Draco sighed, “I suppose you’ve named her now, haven’t you? It'll be nigh on impossible to change your mind. Your stubbornness is only matched by your utter recklessness. It’s a good thing you’re so pleasing on the eye, Mr Harry James Potter.” Harry grinned up at him and winked. “Why did you name her Tamara by the way?”
“You could take this off,” Harry suggests, but doesn’t push. Draco shivers and nods, never taking his eyes off Harry’s. And then in all his glorious nakedness, Harry kneels between Draco’s legs.
But he’s interrupted by a third Auror who bursts inside the study, pushing a small, bound figure in front of him.
“I can do it,” Harry said, spearing him with his resolute green eyes. Then, with an almost playful inflection: “Can you?”
“Nice repartee, Malfoy.” Harry put his hands on his hips, looking smug. “Or are you just bitter after Luna called you out on your question?”
“I don’t think we’ve seen him like this,
under her breath. The pushchair lifts a few inches above the floor, barely disturbing the baby who gives Harry a placid look as his mother carries his pushchair to the kitchen.
Three: he would have to explain why he’d let
“I'm not playing.”
“Still not sure how I was meant to know you were allergic to raspberry jam,” Harry grumbled, crossing his arms over his chest, and doing an uncanny impression of a grumpy Teddy to Draco’s mind.
Harry shrugs. “I’m trying to be. At least I’m giving him a chance to prove my initial bias wrong.”
“That what you’re looking for?” he asks.
Regards,
Harry grips the doorframe.
“Just about ten minutes,” he tells him. “Ernestina and I were getting to know each other.”
Draco didn't know what to do. His chest ached, a strangely beautiful kind of pain. It was worth it, to feel this, to experience the full range of human emotions, wasn’t it? He squeezed her hand in his.
It’s particularly helpful since he needs to discreetly report to Kingsley every few days.
Bristling, Jeff took a step back. “This ring, youngling, is no ordinary ring. It’s made of goblin silver, and the centre stone is said to have belonged to no other than the great Merlin. It’s a treasure, a real treasure, wasting away as a vulgar family heirloom and even more so on the finger of a underling demon like you. It would be the crowning glory to my collection of rare and precious jewelry, and,” he started stamping his foot, “
(It would be cool. No pressure. I’m breezy.)
You’re the bloody Saviour. Nobody could ever reproach you for changing your mind.”
fucked
“Yes, but you’re the one who deserves it more.” Malfoy half-climbs on top of him, hand barely slowing down. “You deserve to have good sex. You deserve to give your desires free rein. You said it yourself: you’ve repressed them for too long.” He kisses him then, an open-mouthed kiss that blends gentleness with possession. “And that’s no way to live, Potter.”
“Fuck,” he murmurs, looking down at it. “This is it.”
in the hush of the study. Then he climbs down the stool, turns to the guests and bows. “Happy birthday, Daddy,” he says in his high, flat voice. Everybody claps, and Scorpius smiles — a small, cautious tug of lips.
Potter’s breath hovers over Draco’s face. Draco melts against the door. Summons the last bit of his pride.
Harry announced out loud. The gargoyle bent its head ever so slightly and stepped aside, revealing the spiraling stone stairwell leading to the office. With one last look at Draco, Harry took the stairs two at a time.
— a grey hydrangea. The room is minimalistic but bright and warm. There is no trace of its previous occupant, to Harry’s relief. The place looks both lived-in and completely blank, the perfect combination for someone to adopt it, to feel instantly at home in.
“Thanks,” Harry murmurs. Malfoy’s invitation should register as a small victory. Instead it feels like mutual surrender.
Scorpius finishes and lays his hands on the keys,
“Oh.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Ah, yes. The receipt form.” He leans over the side of his desk and grabs the parchment. “Because that’s what you came here for, wasn’t it, Potter.”
Ron clears his throat, ears pink.
Malfoy gave Harry a disbelieving glance and scoffed. “Thank Merlin, Potter. It appears we’re not going to die in a snowstorm. Perhaps we’ll die in a log cabin filled with Dark magic instead. Just brilliant.”
Harry leans in and kisses him. It’s supposed to be a soft, sated kiss; but there’s a wistful edge to it, because Draco’s laid out his conditions, and Harry isn’t ready to meet them yet.
“Step three,” he instructs, still bent over his leg, “lift back up with a
“Now what?” he whispers eventually.
Draco’s heart skipped a beat, just because it could now. All thanks to Harry.
“Hello, Harry,” Draco says, his expression contained, cautious.
did, at least. Remember how you were at Hogwarts?”
In the middle of the garden, his silhouette cutting a familiar shape against the immaculate backdrop, Harry stood with his back to Draco, his face turned up towards the stars.
Ernestina casts Draco concerned gazes every time they cross paths in the house, which is too often, now that Draco would rather be left alone with his sullen thoughts. He lets Jemima make an announcement at work, informing the Caduceus employees their boss will be taking a couple of days off to care for his son, who is indisposed. He spends most of the next few days and nights by Scorpius’ bedside, Balzac lying quietly at the foot of the bed, and they watch the Healing spells shimmer around Scorpius’ sleeping form. Whenever he’s awake, Scorpius wants to be close to his father. He’s always touching him — holding the bottom of his cuff, rubbing his thumb over the back of Draco’s hand over and over, twirling a short lock of Draco’s hair around his finger when they’re lying side by side on Scorpius’ bed and Draco tells him stories about famous pianists off the top of his head — like the little boy can’t get enough of his father’s physical presence. His magic, as powerful as always, feels unsettled, like a deep sea rolling in the storm. It prickles against Draco’s skin. Draco longs for the time Scorpius’ magic will feel like a calm ocean again, soft waves of it lapping against his own.
[Editor’s Note: Zabini and his family stayed neutral during the Second Wizarding War].
he wants to snap. And another, smaller part of him wants to roll at Harry’s feet.
Turning another coat rack, he finds a man with his hands deep inside the pockets of a mink coat. A mink coat that is decidedly a woman’s, and decidedly not his.
“Leggo of me, you HELLISH BEASTS, you pseudo-mythical MONSTERS, you self-important CRETINS, I have done nothing, NOTHING, I say leave me alone this instant!”
His music sounds like someone let a rampaging hippogriff in charge of the string section. Or a troop of terminally flatulent Blast-Ended Skrewts in charge of the drums. Such a lack of subtlety.” Malfoy shudders theatrically. “I’m more of a Chopin man, myself. Forceful yet gentle. Intelligent. Virtuoso. Sophisticated…” Malfoy crooks his fingers under Harry’s palm, stroking along the lifeline. Harry forgets how to breathe.
“He did?”
“Excuse
“Oh, but I wants to, Mistor Greg,” Ernestina wrings her hands, her huge brown eyes already swimming with tears. “Ernestina is going to be missing Mistor Greg a lot.”
“You don’t—you don’t know Muggles put a man on the moon?” Harry was fighting to regain his composure.
“Would it make you turn it down?”
Harry rubs his hands on his face. Groans.
When he stands and turns, Potter is staring, eyes wide and nostrils flaring, as if he can’t believe Draco just did — whatever he did.
“You come into my house, you pretend to be someone who’s trained for personal protection, you make a case for yourself and I give you the job. I put my safety in your hands. I put my son’s life in your hands…” Draco’s head is shaking, more fury than disbelief. “I put what’s most precious to me under your fucking care, and you have the absolute nerve to come and tell me you’re none of the things you said you were?”
“Hello, Mr Potter,” Draco’s assistant greets him. Jemima is always so nice to Harry, all bright smiles and friendly words, and Harry feels doubly like shit for deceiving her as well.
“I really can’t blame her for that. It was all me. And I was… already rich enough not to need a job,” Harry adds, somewhat abashed. “The incentive to make an effort was limited. So I dropped off.”
for far longer,” Greg responds, a small smile quirking his lips.
The song Harry and Draco dance to isn't mentioned, but I like to think Ernestina is a fan of good old Spanish classics, so you can give my fave
choices.”
“Yes.
Perhaps it was why he didn’t react to the news in any other way than, “Am I allowed to see you still?”
Draco snorted. “About you? What is there to ask? Everyone in Britain and beyond knows every single thing you do, Potter.”
“No,” Harry counters. “Have you got anything to hide?” Draco presses his lips into a thin line. He doesn’t answer. Harry wants to shake him. “Have you got anything to hide that I should know of, Draco? This is serious. Think about your business. Your employees. Think about Scorpius—”
“Thank you, we will,” Harry told him, fighting down a grin.
“Merlin, Greg, Millicent will have your head! And mine, when she finds out you stayed late talking to me.”
“Look, mate, did something happen? Is there something you want to tell me?” he’d asked, but Harry had shaken his head with a hasty smile.
Turning his back on the castle, he took a step, then another. Draco wasn’t worried about leaving a trace: his footsteps in the fresh snow melted away as he took the next step. Behind him, he was leaving nothing but untouched whiteness.
“Looks like you’re not going to have much of a choice in the end, Malfoy. You don’t even have your guard dog with you. And I’m not talking about the useless three-legged fluff ball over there,” Smith adds, throwing a disdainful look at Balzac. “It looks like your darling Potter has abandoned ship as well.”
Draco was in love with Harry too—had been for more years than he cared to remember.
Harry thinks with petty satisfaction. He watches Draco as he clenches his fists, then deliberately unclenches them. Takes a deep breath. Looks at Harry with a weary tilt of his brow.
PS: I see you’ve moved to ‘warm regards’. Brilliant. That’s progress ;)
Behind him, the door clicked shut. He turned to find Draco Malfoy carefully releasing the handle. Then Malfoy fixed his grey gaze on him, intense and predatory behind his glasses.
Ah. Here’s the catch. This is what happens when Harry’s so desperate to prove his friends wrong that he speaks before he thinks. Because… he hasn’t really thought this through, has he? He hasn’t decided how much he wants to reveal about the person he was snogging just a few weeks ago. If he wants to tell them what that person’s name is, or even what their gender is. That will sure as fuck open the pandora box of Ron being awkwardly supportive of Harry’s newfound sexual identity and Hermione bringing him all the books about LGBT history and forcing them down his throat. Maybe even creating a PowerPoint deck to walk him through his own coming out.
Draco holds him for a long time. Around them, outside the tall windows, the city lights glimmer in the night, an incessant race for life, as if Harry’s world wasn’t teetering on the edge of crumbling down.
Harry picks a quill from the box, lifts it up for Draco to see.
“No,” he says. “No, I’m not doing this. No way.”
Auror Malfoy,” he added, giving him his hand to shake, “for all your
“I was just—” Harry had gestured to the rows of coats, had finished lamely“—leaving.” His voice had come out scratchy, his breath too hard and fast.
Harry snorted softly. “Why, do you know anyone you'd like to set me up with?”
And everyone has heard: when Draco’s eyes flick to the other guests and Harry remembers they’re not alone, he finds his friends and Draco’s watching them, their eyes a fraction wider.
When Harry steps into the room after her, he finds it furnished with two black leather sofas facing one another across a round walnut table where a single white hydrangea sits in a vase. The room is filled with sunlight. It’s warm and quiet, with a view over an outdoor garden. It’s so unexpectedly peaceful that for a second, Harry forgets that he is in a house in the middle of London, a house that belongs to Draco Malfoy, whom he’s about to meet again for the first time in a decade.
“If the Chosen One says so,” he muttered, and shaking Harry’s hand off him, he stalked to a corner of the room where Harry could make out a simple, carved wooden bench. He plopped himself on it with a sigh and put his head in his hands.
felt colder.
— but knowing where to start is elusive and overwhelming.
I didn’t lose
It’s either Potter hovering by the beakers, poking his fat fingers in the petri dishes, messing with DMLE evidence, and giggling like a schoolgirl with Draco,
You’ve only shown me the tip of the iceberg. I want to know all of you. I want to listen to you tell me more about your life, and your future. I want to feel every inch of your skin under my fingertips. I want to listen to the sounds you make when I take you in my mouth. I want to feel the weight of you on me. Until you’re sick of me. Will I ever be sick of you? There’s no way we can predict it. But all evidence seems to prove the opposite. I’ve never really been sick of you since I was eleven. Always seeking you out, teasing you, chasing you, following you around like a lovesick fool (let’s face it, you weren’t much better).
-Draco Malfoy
Dewey’s eyes skim the page of the diary open in front of him, so heavy with notes and writing in various ink colours that Harry’s head hurts just looking at it. He spots the time slot reserved for Harry’s meeting quickly, somewhere between a note flashing ‘IMPORTANT’ in red ink and an appointment that keeps slithering across the page, and he crosses it out with a sharp slash of his quill. Then he lifts his big blue eyes to Harry’s face and smiles.
“It seems we are agreed, Headmistress. When do we start?”
“Draco…” he says, “I trust you.”
And Harry couldn’t wait to get started.
“Checking my Arithmancy calculations—” he started, but Granger had already extricated herself from her boyfriend’s arms and jumped down the sofa. Weasley protested at the loss but she didn’t seem to notice.
“I — that’s not all there is to it.”
“Daddy,” Scorpius says again, and without waiting for Harry to respond, breaks into a run towards Draco’s study.
Malfoy’s mouth lifts at the corner. “I can live with that. Besides, this isn’t really about me. My security detail is here to protect me but also, mainly, my son, Scorpius.” He rests his elbows on the desk, pressing his fingertips together. “You explained to me why
“I thought we had established
Draco rubbed his jaw. He gazed at Harry, who brought his socked feet under him on the sofa and smiled at Draco expectantly.
She shifted in Weasley’s arms to better look at him. Both were cuddled up on the sofa by the fire. Weasley was deep in conversation with Seamus Finnigan, also curled up around his own boyfriend at the foot of the sofa. At the other end of it, Pansy, wrapped around a Neville Longbottom who looked chuffed and terrified in equal measure by his own good luck, stared at Draco in surprise. She widened her eyes as if to say, ‘Striking up a conversation with Granger? What’s got into you?’ He lifted an defiant eyebrow at her to retort, ‘Longbottom? Now that’s new.’ She had the decency to blush lightly and look away.
to Draco was only making matters worse. “I did change my mind.” He swallowed, surprised by the painful truth of his next statement. “I want to be better.”
She let go of Luna’s hand and ran forward. In the distance, Draco saw them: starkly black against the white backdrop of the snow-covered Hogwarts grounds, there were two ravens chasing and pecking cruelly at a tiny creature that looked suspiciously like—
Malfoy’s grey eyes are cold despite the warm firelight. Harry notes the taut shoulders, the tight-knuckled grip on the book, the lips set in a thin line.
Draco’s eyes dropped to Harry’s flies. The sneaky bastard had managed to open them and  pull his jeans and pants a few inches down. His long, beautiful cock was jutting out, hard and already leaking at the slit, and Draco ached to touch it.
“That’s the point, baby,” Harry says sweetly. “I don’t want you to think
Harry smiles back, and feels a bit soft and pathetic for it. “Oh really? But you’re so brilliant at it. What
“I don’t think normal rules apply here, Hermione.” Harry tries to keep the rising irritation from his voice, but fails. Don’t they see? He’d do anything to wrap up the case.
“No,” says Harry, “the people who could help you out of a life of petty offences.”
“I’m not sure…" Boyle hesitates, then adds, "It will depend on how well they cooperate.” She nods towards Draco and his house-elf.
Which he had, in all fairness.
“I have no obligation to show anything to anyone,” Harry told him, eyes blazing, a mulish tilt to his jaw. “I never have, and I never will. Especially if it means I have to let my words be distorted by someone like you!”
And warmer, it was. Almost suffocatingly so, after the prickling cold of the outside. The air was heavy with the smell of sunlight, a misty kind of humidity, as well as something earthy that Draco couldn’t place. It was a scent that he associated more with his mother’s rose garden than with the inside of a house. Flecks of dust danced in the rays of sunshine pouring from the skylights of the foyer and the massive floor-to-ceiling bow windows at the back of the living room. Draco stopped in his tracks, his hands pausing on the knot of his scarf. The perfect curve of the windows, almost sixteen feet high, was too much of a feat of engineering to be entirely Muggle.
Ron’s coming closer. Harry feels a cold rise of panic. Malfoy stands then, with a feline grace at odds with his previous posture. He takes Harry’s chin in his hand, and leans in.
pining after a war hero around here.” She crossed her arms and stared expectantly. “Spill it, Draco.”
“Fuck…you…?” Malfoy was everywhere, all around him, a fist around both their cocks and his fast breath bathing Harry’s face, but the words he’d uttered still seemed nonsensical. How could this evening have turned out so lucky? How could this wet dream of a man offer up himself to Harry?
“What a fitting term, Draco. It’s wonderful.” Luna beamed. “I’m so glad you picked a career as a journalist. You have such a way with words.”
but he comes up short. This has never happened before.
for Merlin’s sake. He'd done hundreds of interviews, written hundreds of articles in his career. Just get in, ask the questions he had prepared, have Dennis come in later to snap a few pictures for the cover, and leave. Lovegood was the last interview of the series. He’d interviewed
he says as he clambers on the stool in front of the grand piano.
He extended his arm, bent at the elbow. The questioning lift of his eyebrow was all the incentive Malfoy needed; he linked his arm to his.
They were adults. And he didn’t want Harry to be upset and annoyed by his presence.
“Shut it, or I shall hex you into a toad,” Draco answers from the side of his mouth.
Harry said, fingers digging into the planes of Malfoy’s back, legs wrapping around his waist. “Fuck me, Draco,” he said again, Malfoy’s first name escaping from his lips in the daze of his lust.
“This is so fucking unfair, Draco. We discussed everything together. It was part of our plan. I stayed by mutual agreement.”
Draco moaned around Harry’s cock, his eyes falling shut with the intensity of the moment, Harry’s pleasure emanating from him in waves, lingering against Draco’s fingers like magic, dripping salty against his tongue. Draco started bobbing his head slowly, feeling his way around Harry’s cock, exploring the contours of it with his tongue, testing his own limits. When it hit the back of his throat, he gagged a bit and pulled away. He felt Harry tense above him.
Draco stood still, his eyes searching Harry’s. He hoped, a bit hysterically, that Harry was pulling his leg. All he could find in his eyes was the same legendary, infuriating earnestness.
“And my Zegna belt buckle, if I’m not mistaken.”
Harry stood in the middle of the group, cheeks pink, eyes crinkled with lighthearted laughter, head thrown back. He was

“Look, Draco. I’m not masochistic, either. That’s the reason why I never contacted you after Ginny and Blaise’s engagement party. Since we’re on the subject of truth...there’s something you should know.”
“And Scorpius will be fine," Harry says, "because we can only hope kids today are better than we were. He’s a brilliant kid, too, and he’ll make friends and be happy like all of us were back then — however occasionally.”
Draco looked up. Harry was so close. He had angled his body towards Draco, one leg folded under him, the other dangling from the side of the sofa.
And you won't even let me—” He rakes his hands in his hair, lets out a frustrated groan. “You're the one who made up that rule!”
Harry snorts. “Oh, shove off, Malfoy.”
“Do you not want them to know about us?” Harry asked, his face earnest.
Luna had suggested a cup of tea at the end of the first hour of the interview. The rhythm of questions and answers had been gruelling, more so for Draco than for Luna, he suspected. He’d brought the Prothimioscope and his notes with him when they’d moved to the kitchen. The golden top was still spinning brightly on the thick wooden counter covering the central island, indicating the interview was still in progress despite the informal setting.
Very vividly.
Dear Drake,

“I appreciate your honesty,” Draco says, forcing his voice to remain cold.

pants, matching the rest of his Auror uniform.
“No!” Harry says, forceful. “It’s fine. I’m making good progress. I just need more time to… to—”
“As long as the next ones are planned.”
“What—?”
“...well, they're hoarders, see?”
“All right.” He slaps the folder on the Minister's desk. “I’m going to need all the information you have on Draco Malfoy.”
little Niffler is off pursuing his own interests instead of working for the common bad?”
When he finally reaches the front door of his house and pushes it open, he knows what to do.
“Er, apologies, Luna, but if that’s the only thing they told you…I ought to be more transparent about what the interview entails.”
“Pretty,” said the Niffler, holding out his tiny paw toward Draco’s ring. His name was Jeff.

Draco held his breath.

Harry lifts his eyebrows but is unable to stop the spark of curiosity that must show on his face.
“Follow me,” he said.
“How does that feel, after all these years mocking me about mine?”
Ginny lifted a quizzical eyebrow at Draco but didn’t comment on his presence. The presence of other former Slytherins in the snowman-building taskforce didn’t seem to bother her either. Draco had tensed when he’d seen her walk up to them, but her and Harry had only exchanged friendly smiles and ‘hello’s, so he’d soon relaxed. After the heavy snowfall of yesterday, the weather had cleared. The day was blue-skied and sunny. When Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas had suggested a walk out on the grounds after lunch, they had naturally included Draco, Greg and Blaise in the group. Pansy had followed with Neville Longbottom, and Theo had tagged along without asking permission.
“You’re fifteen years too late.” Draco gives his head a dismissive shake, water dripping from his hair. “Apologising. Being my friend.”
All right, I'll get started then. Mmh.
Thank you for helping me win the bet.
“May I—” he nods over his shoulder and points at Draco, who’s sitting at his desk, filling out Ministry forms with slashing movements of his quill. “I’d like to—”
“Give me,” Draco says through clenched teeth, leaning in, “one reason. One reason not to kill you. Or worse, send you back to your precious Ministry to carry on with your pitiful life.”
Where was he?
“Isn’t that what school reunions are for?”
“Tipsy Draco… never thought I’d see the day.”
“Thank you, Head Auror,” Malfoy bowed his head slightly, the very picture of respectful deference, if not for the tiniest hint of a smirk playing at the corner of his mouth. Harry grabbed his arm and all but threw him out of Head Auror Smith’s office. Malfoy’s delighted chuckle was more damning evidence of their illicit off-piste antics than Harry’s burgeoning erection was.
“But you still knew you wanted to be an Auror?”
“I’m glad you’re getting to talk to all sorts of interesting people, Hermione,” Harry says. “But I’m fine being on my own.”
Leaning on one elbow, Malfoy waves his wand towards his back and mutters a rapid succession of spells. Harry only recognises one or two: he’s never needed more than a few of these in the past, he reminds himself with a thrill of anticipation. The slide of his cock between Malfoy’s cheeks is suddenly smoother. Wetter. His legs tremble with how much he wants to do this.
“Scorpius was very good today, Mistor Draco, sir. The teacher is saying Scorpius made a friend.”
Flustered, Harry squirmed on his seat. “Well.
That’s all the good Draco’s love can do.
Mere feet from the ground, Harry’s fist closed around the Snitch, and Draco heard the mixed cries of “Alright! Harry!” and “Malfoy, I’m going to catch you and
Ugh!” Mephistopheles reached up to rake his fingers through his hair. Sadly for him, there wasn’t much of it left, the few remaining strands brittle and singed. “That’ll teach me to agree to tutor younglings. Teenage demons are
For everyone else, it was a time of peaceful celebration. For Draco, it was a time of turmoil like he’d never felt.
“Ella DiCara,” he says, for the solicitor part. He thinks about the one firecall he’s allowed to make. Thinks of Harry, alone with Scorpius and Balzac in the big townhouse. Thinks of the fireplace in his study, the way Smith put it out with a careless Aguamenti when he barged into the room.
Upstairs, in the foyer, Ernestina stands next to a small, blond child. The boy is holding a plastic toy against his chest, some sort of dragon — a Norwegian Ridgeback, Harry thinks — and his eyes are fixed on it. Balzac is curled at his feet, tail swishing on the marble floor. Malfoy’s house-elf gazes at the boy, then at Malfoy, with a proud look on her face.
Weasley rubbed his wrist with a hurt look. “It’s not

It was just a very convoluted way to ask you on a date. And Merlin knows I’m not a convoluted person (so maybe that’s why it didn’t work?)
“Not just
was that?!” Zacharias Smith is lifting himself off the ground on all fours. He rubs a hand on his face, stares back at Harry and Scorpius, a mixture of disbelief and dark hatred written on his face. Then he turns towards Draco. “Malfoy, is that your
Harry let out a hesitant little exhale. “Yes, Headmistress.”
In that case, what are you even doing here, interviewing with me, Potter?”
“Yes, I'm sure you do.” With one glance at Harry, Draco reaches around him and opens the cupboard door, pushing past him and stomping out. In the office, the light of day hits his eyes. He’s forgotten — it’s afternoon. It’s a normal day. A few minutes in a cupboard with Harry Potter, and he loses track of time.
Harry turned at the sound of his name.
He braces himself for refusing the case—he’s never been one for financial fraud cases, and he supposes that’s what this one is—when his eyes fall on the next page in the folder.
for God’s sake.” After Draco’s stared at him for a long moment, blinking and stunned, Harry rolls his eyes and marches up to him. “I don’t care about your mistakes. I don’t care about your fucking Mark, Malfoy,” Harry says, and he engulfs Draco in a hug.
he chastises himself.
“That's never
me, perhaps grudgingly. They respect the work I’ve done. But they still hate me.” He looks at Harry then, his gaze sharp and inquisitive. “And you don’t.”
Draco glares at him, his eyes narrowed. “You keep my son out of this, Potter, or I’ll follow through with my desire to murder you.”
“Neville and I are brilliant together, thank you very much. What’s that got to do with anything?”
“I’m going to be so good, Potter.
-Hermione
He doesn’t look very mysterious now, standing over Draco’s desk, proud and official in his Auror uniform, if only for his slightly flushed face. He looks…
The bloody stairs are drafty and steep, and Harry has half a mind to abandon his ascent halfway through and go back home. He’s in good shape—his job requires him to be—but there’s something about this building that scrapes at his nerves and drains him of his energy.
Draco’s mouth waters, and he takes a swig of his tea to hide his swallow.
“Just taking a walk around the place,” Harry says, casting a discreet Tempus. Only quarter past nine. God, he’s twenty-five and already getting old.
I don’t...
“Uh-huh?” Draco asked, too stunned and sated to manage anything more constructive.
The memory of the third member of their trio, who hadn’t survived to live out the past twelve years with them tugs Draco’s heart. He can tell by Greg’s shadowed eyes that he’s thinking about him too.
Harry. And I apologised, again and again, for having fed gossip and false accusations to someone as morally questionable as Rita Skeeter. But maybe if you didn’t go out of your way to make sure you never heard about what I’ve been up to since the war, you’d know I’m striving, every fucking day, to become the opposite of her. To become the opposite of the little brat I was, for that matter. I’m striving to become what I think a great journalist should be. What I think a good

Hannah thumps him in the back and points at Gabrielle, “Be quiet, you dirty man, there’s an innocent little thing among us!” while Gabrielle pulls at her sleeve, “What did ‘e mean? What does zat mean, ‘Annah’?”
“Did you ever doubt it, Potter?”
“You said you were getting there,” he complained. Draco laughed.
he says, showing Harry the door with a flourish.
Harry takes a breath. This is the part where his made-up profession and motivation come in, and he hopes he can sound convincing.
“Ah, here you are, you two! In with you, come on, get in,” she hugged them tight and ushered them inside before running back to the kitchen, hollering at a toddler in a red velvet dress, “Victoire, will you climb down off that stool, darling! Mind that you don’t hit your head!”
Harry steps inside. The office is indeed empty. The space is tidy, airy, with floor-to-ceiling windows and a breathtaking view of the skyline. It looks cool, professional, befitting of the founder of an international company. It also feels like the opposite of Draco’s study at home, warm and dimly lit and cosy. Absently, fingers touching the piles of parchment on Draco’s large glass-top desk, Harry wonders what these differences say about Draco. There's the tireless inventor and ruthless businessman he is inside these walls, when Harry escorts him to Caduceus and stands guard in front of his office; there’s the warmer version of Malfoy he becomes in the safety of his study at home, Harry sitting on the sofa and watching him work while Scorpius practices at the grand piano. Harry witnesses the transformation every day: it’s in the way Draco’s jaw sets when he’s about to unfold himself from the black Mercedes and walk to the Caduceus building; the way he straightens the lapels of his jacket in the lift; the way his voice becomes more clipped, posher, when he’s in his role.
The doorbell of number twelve, Grimmauld Place rings early the next day, just when Harry is groggily pulling himself out of bed, trying to pull a t-shirt over his bandaged arm.
I’m including McGonagall in that.”
“Will you stop?!” Draco interrupts. He blows on his fringe, sending his white-blond hair flying. Harry’s starting to find that little tic of his weirdly sexy. Draco holds out a hand for Harry, who takes it and hauls himself from off the floor. “We were
Besides, Millicent told me she’d cut my balls off and wear them as earrings if she caught me helping you again. We can’t have that. As much as I care about my balls, I think we all agree they’d make the world’s most distasteful jewelry.
Mephistopheles took a deep, steadying inhale. “The bosses want him gone. They can’t afford to let the Boy Who Destroyed An Opportunity walk away unscathed. Humans like him need to be taught a lesson.”
But most of all, he likes that he got to
“We don’t have to,” he whispers, sliding his thumb across Draco’s cheekbone. “We don’t have to, Draco. I just wanted you to know.”
This can’t be the last time Harry sees him—
“I’m serious! I know exactly what I want to do, and so do you, Ron. I’m
so obsessed with me.”
“Hi,” Draco answered with a small smile. He felt strangely shy, uncertain about what would come next, his new heart beating madly in his chest.
“Please…”
Took me years to sort it out.” He kisses down the side of Draco's neck. “I've never done this before. Fuck, Draco, kiss me again, please—”
They stared. Draco’s chest felt tight and Harry swallowed, his Adam’s apple bobbing in his throat.
“Sure,” Malfoy chuckles. “Let’s call it… exploration, then. Would you like me to suck you off again? Would you like to suck
Seems crueler not to tell him.

“I mean… yeah. You never thought—?” Eyes shifting, Ron rubbed the back of his neck. “I thought everybody knew. Looking back… I’ve often wondered if the reason why he picked on you so much at school was because he…

“Maybe it's time, Harry. Maybe it's time you lived for yourself, not for the faceless masses.”
“Piss off, Malfoy, you wanted me all along,” Harry said with a crooked smile. Draco rolled his eyes and took his hand.
Speaking of, he finds her in the ‘Eldridge Family’s Wands Through the Ages’ room. She’s standing near the buffet, deep in conversation with an older couple over a tray of canapés. Next to her, Ron looks green around the gills, his eyes darting up fearfully at the giant paper maché spider hanging over the table. Hermione is in public relations mode already, too busy to notice the sheen of cold sweat on her boyfriend’s brow. Harry recognizes the people she’s talking to from seeing their pictures in the papers. Mr and Mrs Peterson, American expatriates whose children are currently studying at Hogwarts, and honorary members of the school’s Board of Directors.
She turns to rinse the whisk in the sink.
The kiss is nothing like the chaste brushes of lips they’ve shared until now.
“Draco...” he heard Harry groan above him. “That was—Merlin, that was—”
“More than a work
Malfoy moved with each of Harry’s thrusts, until he stood nearly bent over, hands pushing against the wall, arse pushing against Harry’s cock, shirt scrunched up to reveal the pale skin of his lower back. His head hung between his outstretched arms, and Harry had the sudden vision of what Malfoy was seeing. His heavy cock bouncing as Harry rammed into him, Harry’s balls as his flesh slapped against Malfoy’s arse… The image made his legs tremble.
I never wanted—” Lucifer, he’d never been this uneloquent in his life. His throat felt painful and tight. The words refused to come. He forced them out anyway. “I never wanted to kill him, but choosing between him and my family...” Dumbledore’s last words flashed in his mind.
Last night, they had both fulfilled an old fantasy, and the world hadn’t ended. And now that morning was here… what would become of that one night of passion?
“Oi! Potter! I’m about to change into my joggers. Unless you want to stay for that, too?”
Harry stares, slack-jawed. “You’ve got to go,” he repeats, feeling rejected and dumb.
Potter’s odd, awe-struck expression cleared. He frowned, leaned around Draco, and grabbed a glass of champagne. “You haven’t changed one bit, have you?”
Draco moaned around his cock and lifted his free hand to cup Harry’s balls. He experimentally rolled them around his palm, slowly, one after the other. He listened intently to the sounds Harry made, waiting for a sign that he should stop. When such a sign never came, he closed his fingers around the sac and felt it tighten against his palm. He remembered what Harry had done the last time they’d had sex at Hogwarts—his slicked forefinger rubbing circles around Draco’s rim, pushing into Draco’s hole. How heavenly it had felt. He decided to take a risk. Not even realising the bobbing rhythm of his mouth over Harry’s cock had slowed, he let his fingers trail up past Harry’s balls, along his lightly haired arse cheeks, slipping lightly into his crease. Harry’s breath stuttered and hitched. The head of Harry’s cock still pressed against the inside of his cheek, Draco concentrated. If he tried hard enough—if he could cast a wordless lubrication spell—
Harry’s never seen such an earnest expression on Malfoy’s face. He sits up and pushes the covers off. The book falls off the bed with a thud.
Luna tilted her head. “But I like the truth,” she said. “Who are you going to tell, if not me?”
Harry pulled back and gazed into Draco’s eyes, joyful and intimate. “You know...it could be just as unforgettable the other way around.” He laughed at Draco’s perplexed frown. “Listen...I have an idea.”
And with a spin too swift for Harry to stop him, Malfoy Disapparates with a crack.
“You can give me more,” Draco whispers. “I’m not going to break.”
“I came to check in on you, Draco,” he said. He had a low, gravelly voice that had always seemed at odds with his size. “I have to admit I didn’t expect to get
The sky was turning orange and pink when a shiny-faced and frizzy-haired Hermione cast the last preserving spell on the snowman—a masterpiece of sculpture and collaboration, if she was to be believed—and everyone took the direction of the castle. His hand in Harry’s, walking side by side with him, Draco noticed most of them were in pairs. Ginny and Luna, Ron and Hermione, Pansy and Neville, Dean and Seamus. It seemed so easy, so normal—a group of teenagers, some single, some not, walking back from an afternoon of teasing and fun in the snow.
His name sounds good spoken in Malfoy’s posh accent, and Harry notes, surprised and a little pleased, that Malfoy’s cheeks are pinker.
“We just kissed,” Draco admitted in the silence between the deserted row of bookshelves. “It was just a kiss. Well.
Cheers,
Hermione let out a breath. “I was surprised as well, at first,” she said. “And then after I gave it some thought... I wasn’t.”
“Yet you had the presence of mind to shield everyone from it.” Draco’s eyes are a bright burn on Harry. Harry turns to face him fully. Draco is leaning forward in his chair, elbows on his knees. The fingers of his right hand are resting on the sheet, tentative, as if he held out his hand for Harry and decided against it at the last moment. Harry wants to take Draco’s hand in his. “Thank you, Harry. There was damage, to him, to you. I mean… Merlin, Harry, you were
An earth-shattering fact Draco had been unaware of until this very minute.
“I just explained the rough content of the job to you. Is it really the only thing you want to ask me?”
Harry
He felt Harry move closer, his gloved hand touching his arm, squeezing a bit. When he looked up, Harry was staring at him, a pained expression on his face. Draco’s vision was going blurry. If he cried in front of Harry the way Harry had cried in front of him a week ago, would that make them even? He smiled bitterly. “I guess I never thought siding with my father and with that snake-faced maniac would lead to
And he smiled at Draco.
God, the glamorous life of a Quidditch star.
yes sir, it was a trap, that’s what it was. Even when he’d told Malfoy about that little fantasy of his, he hadn’t expected Malfoy to, er,
Harry couldn’t help but catalogue every detail of Malfoy’s appearance: the hair (longer than he wore it at Hogwarts, cut just below his chin, a graceful white-blond sweep across his forehead); the hands (nails painted black, rings on every finger except the thumbs); the piercings (one in his left eyebrow, one in his lip, several in his ears); and the clothes… Merlin.
—how precious this ring is?”
They lie like this for a while, their sweat and the mess between them cooling in the darkened study. Harry lifts his head slightly, nudges Draco’s nose with his. It’s soft and intimate, and Draco’s heart swells in his chest, painful. He just had sex with Harry Potter. He just had sex with Harry. They just had sex and it was slow and heated and nearly delirious and already more perfect than Draco remembers sex to ever have been.
Draco throws his hands up in the air with a frustrated growl and stalks back to his desk. Harry’s left with Penelope half-hugging him, and four women watching him with small, knowing smiles. He squirms.
“Say it.
“Because you’re so unbiased when it comes to Malfoy?” Ron snorts softly.
They kiss, all tongues and hands and hips pushing into each other. Thank Merlin it’s past eight o’clock, because this kiss definitely isn’t the quick-little-kiss-in-a-work-lift kind. Draco has half a mind to hit the emergency button and stop the lift so he can ravage Harry’s face properly, but he remembers he has other plans upstairs. Which include ravaging Harry’s face, too, but also. Showing him the news. Celebrating.
Harry sits down on the carpet, his legs crossed, a few careful feet away from Draco. “Draco…?” he prompts gently.
responsibility to decide what came next? You could have
While living in Paris, Malfoy had studied for a Potions Mastery.
“You’re allowed to talk, Ernestina.” The words pour out of Malfoy's mouth with a slow deliberation.
And getting to know Harry — really know him — does nothing to change that fact.
“You are hard to read,” she said. “Harder than Ginny. Her aura is red and pink all the time.” Draco glanced at Ginny Weasley. Her grin was positively dazzling. It grew wider when she looked in Luna’s direction.
It all seems so simple and unthreatening, Harry wants to laugh with relief.
Harry turned on his side, away from Malfoy. What if it was all they would have, then? It was only fair. Harry had only confessed his feelings to Malfoy because… well, because it was a weird situation, wasn’t it? He’d never expected to be confined in close, dark quarters with Malfoy. Malfoy, whose fit little arse he’d stared at for the five hours leading to… this
Malfoy leans in, his eyebrows drawn down balefully. “Say it, Potter.”
“And you needn’t worry,” Harry said as he scooped her up in his arms and she began to claw at his red jumper. “Tamara is a miniature dragon, a new breed. She won’t grow any bigger than a kneazle.”
“Okay?” he asked, his breath shallow and hot against Harry’s skin. His face was pink and shiny with perspiration and there was a swathe of blond hair falling in his eye. Harry had never seen him look so debauched.
Harry’s on his back, on the floor, a heap of Draco Malfoy crushing him. It technically wouldn’t be unpleasurable, if there weren’t also five women staring at them from the threshold of the DLF office, some of them gasping in shock, some others smothering giggles behind their hands.
“You don't...have a problem with it?” Harry asked slowly, "Do you?"
Malfoy’s company kept the prices of those vital potions voluntarily low; on their own, none of them were commercially viable. Instead, the production and selling of those references were supported by Juvence and other non-essential, but extremely profitable, lines of anti-aging and beautifying products.
“If the formula still doesn’t give realistic results, I thought a combination of Predictive and Algebra spells could help. My understanding is that all these tests have a Muggle base to them. It would be brilliant if we had access to more, but the Library has wizarding books only. Then we could just help the personality tests along with magic.”
Now, here Harry is, standing in front of Malfoy’s home on a chilly January morning, wondering what the hell he’s doing. He has half a mind to turn on his heel and piss off somewhere sunny for a long, well-deserved holiday.
Cheers!
“I used to hate a lot of things about you, too.”
Harry had looked at him with slightly glazed eyes. “Yeah. Let’s go back downstairs.” He had taken Draco’s hand and they’d walked down to the Eighth Year Common Room, stopping every so often to kiss around corners or in dark alcoves. In front of their Common Room door, Harry had kissed him one last time, soft and sweet, as though it was the most natural thing in the world.
Balzac jumps down the bed, looks at me and wags his tail. Waiting. I jump down too. Piled rug under my feet, shaggy. I put my slippers on, then my green dressing gown (thick, warm, like the blankets in my bed). Garlands of tiny light bulbs hanging from the ceiling. Fairy lights, though there aren’t really fairies. Turned off. I think about the lights, their flickering colours. I reach out to them — my magic does. And the lights go on. Too bright. Dimmer, please. They dim. (They listen to me.) Nestine and I put them up ten days ago.
“Merlin, Potter,” Malfoy’s voice was trembling slightly. “You sure kept
last night to pay proper attention.
“Partners. Sure.”
“I haven’t done anything,” Draco hissed back. The little boy was already moving away from his table. “I don’t know what this is abou—”
and the seeds are always highly unstable, and they could explode any minute if we don’t attend to them.”
Draco blushed. “Yes, well... I never said it was a bad thing, did I? It’s just a fact.”
“Live-in
He fists his hands in Harry's hair and pulls his head to the side, growling in his ear: “Fuck me.”
“Fuck, Draco, are you okay?”
“Er, yes. Thank you.” Harry takes off his coat and hands it to her. She practically disappears behind the bulky cashmere as she’s holding it against her chest.
Harry,
“You’ve changed,” she murmured. “Harry’s right. It wasn’t just the apology you gave me at the beginning of the year, was it?”
“I didn’t have much choice at first, did I? My mother was on house arrest, my father was in Azkaban, our vaults had been seized by the Ministry. I had no qualifications, and no one would have hired me anyway, even after you shed a slightly less unpleasant light on me by testifying for me at the trials. Nicking shiny things kept me fed while using two of my biggest talents. And no, before you ask, Potter,” Malfoy adds with a sharp smirk, “the two talents I refer to aren’t giving amazing head and being a total dickhead to you.”
Ways to kill Harry Potter:
He stood. Across the tables, Harry was gathering his books, gazing at Draco behind his smudged round spectacles. Draco picked up his books and placed them in his shoulder bag, hoping the trembling of his hands wasn’t obvious.
“Sorry, what?” he heard Malfoy quietly say next to him.
“Hi, Balzac.” Harry pets the dog’s head, and is rewarded with a big doggy grin and a soft yap. “You didn’t wake Scorpius. Good boy.”
Harry realised it as soon as he stood: there was an downside to being in a standing position that he hadn’t thought of. He brought a hand to his arse and squeezed his legs shut when copious amounts of come dripped out of him and along his thighs. Face heating, he saw Malfoy’s eyes follow the slow trickle of spunk down his legs. There was an almost imperceptible smirk on his lips, and Harry watched as Malfoy’s cock gave a hopeful lurch.
Dear Draco,
“Come on,” Pansy pulled him by the arm. “Let’s go out. I want to hear every little detail!”
Sensing the flood of sadness rolling from everyone around him in waves, Draco gathered his courage and said: “I want to write.”
Harry clutches at the coats, groping for purchase as Malfoy starts working him relentlessly. He finds the cold metal rail and grabs it, arms over his head, pants around his knees, Malfoy’s mouth on his cock. He chokes back a moan when Malfoy pulls off with teasing slowness.
“Just… maybe don’t let the news of your relationship with Draco travel to the Ministry. Ron’s not on the case anymore. It’s officially no longer his responsibility. But if Kingsley finds out about it… you’ll be out on your arse in an instant. Possibly forever.”
“When you’re ready not to hide.”
Draco blinks, mouth gaping. His hands slip away from Harry’s chest.
Balzac likes being called a good boy.
“I am. Tremendously. But I’m not sure I’m equipped to take much more of it for now.” Draco must see the question in Harry’s expression, and he shakes his head again, a minute sideways nod. “Don’t get me wrong. I’m… indebted to you. For everything you’ve told me. I’m not going to expand on my feelings about—” He waves his hand between them, cuts himself off, hesitant, but Harry’s heart sets off racing all the same. “I’ll take your promise for protection, still. If not for me, then for Scorpius. Because Merlin knows you’ve made a connection with my child, and that’s more than enough for me. For now.”

he wrote instead.
“It’s fine,” Harry catches his breath. “It’s… it’s all fine.”
“I wasn’t humming.”
The next few seconds feel like an eternity. Harry considers reaching for his wand, feels idiotic for it. When Draco’s form finally appears in the doorway, Harry’s breath leaves him in a rush. He doesn't know how long he’d been holding it.
“Are you sure? Two and a half thimblefuls? From the blue potion bottle?”

He hadn’t realised that this project would also expose the imperfections of his
So he clears his throat, and smiles slowly.
“Just get on with it, Draco,” Penelope waves her hand, “the Lost aren’t going to find themselves.” She seems amused in spite of herself, and the team chuckles and urges Draco on, “Yes, stop teasing and show us, damnit!”
“You watch out, Malfoy,” Ron said, watching his girlfriend with a fond expression. “Next thing you know, she’ll be your next Minister for Magic.”
Because really, never taking anything for granted is the only constant in Draco’s life.
“Sorry about that,” he apologised with a tight-lipped smile. “Let’s pretend the Prat Who Lived didn’t cut us off. Where were we?”
In the darkness, on his knees, he felt like he could tell him anything. “I’m going to suck your thick, hard cock until you come in my mouth, Harry, and I’m going to love it. I’m going to swallow your come and I’m going to love it. Unless you want to come on my face. We can do that, if you prefer.”
He only has three days left.
The last room is a light grey-and-blue tiled bathroom with a double sink, a large bathtub and a shower cubicle big enough for Harry to fit lying down on the floor of it. There’s a single bar of soap, white and appealingly round, placed in a shallow bowl next to the sink. It fills the bathroom with the scent of honeysuckle, and Harry takes a deep breath, absorbs it, relaxes.
“Well, that was fantastic, Potter. For me, at least.”
Malfoy’s grin widened.
“Do you mean...love?” She lifted her eyebrows. Draco had the uncomfortable feeling that he had walked right into his own trap, backed himself in a corner of his own making. Why had he even asked that question? What did he even know about love?
lost people. We went over this already. There was a war. Everyone did shite things. People you loved died. Now, there are people who love you who are still alive, and Christmas is as good a time as any to show them you love them too. You have this... this
“Us.” It’s half a question, and Malfoy nods.
Malfoy shakes his head with a disbelieving half-smile. “Merlin, Potter. I’m regretting my decision to hire you already.”
“Hermione Granger,” Draco tells the Aurors when they ask him again whom he'd like to firecall.
She flashes Harry one last look, somewhere between sternness and amusement, and glides out of the room.
“All right, all right!” Draco pushes his hair out of his eyes, pops the top two buttons of his shirt, and stretches his shoulders and neck. “The ‘Bend and Snap’, now. Easy. Watch and learn, babes.” He leans over the closest desk and grabs a quill. “Let’s assume the target of your…
“It’s been my pleasure,” Harry sputters, “and
She stopped and glanced at the Prothimioscope that was still spinning and buzzing cheerily on the carpet. The hot atmosphere from a few moments ago had turned to ice against Draco’s skin, the air frozen in his lungs. He swallowed thickly. Fingers trembling, he shifted through his question cards, hoping to find a way to regain his composure.
Playing the role of Frederic. The leading man, the hero, the heartthrob. Of course.
Harry holds Draco for a long time. He’s not sure why he does; he’s not sure the prickly, closed-off bastard deserves it.
OH. MY. GOD.
Last Saturday, he took me out for a walk. We put big coats on. Mine was like a pillow. I wrapped my Slytherin scarf around my neck. Balzac wasn't there, so I knew it wasn't a normal walk. The streets were filled with people. Christmas shoppers. Lights. Smells. Too bright. We stopped in front of a shop. Window full of necklaces, earrings, watches. Jewelry store. Muted colours inside. Daddy crouched in front of me. I looked at the strand of hair poking out of his woolen hat. (Straighter, lighter than mine.) He said,
“More,” Draco whispers. Harry gives a tentative thrust of the hips, his cock sliding between Draco’s thighs. Draco arches his neck with a hiss. “Yes.”
Harry’s eyes widen. “What?
Draco stares at him, eyes wide and dark.
“I’m always busy,” Malfoy says, his tone sharp, then seems to catch himself. “Merlin, that sounded awfully self-important.” He looks oddly flustered, exhales, annoyed with himself. “Anyway, it’s your first day, I can take the time to help you get started.”
“I’m just watching out for you, Harry.”
“Seems to me we’ve already planned our next… ‘accident’. Are there going to be more?”
Please don’t tell him,
Fine.
“I wasn’t supposed to tell you about this,” Draco says, shaking his head. “Looks like I can’t even keep my own secrets safe anymore.”
He thinks of being eighteen, surrounded by the sweltering inferno swallowing the hidden things, reaching out in supplication — and feeling Harry's hand closing around his, lifting him up, saving him.
She looks up at him with a start when he comes into the kitchen.
“And I wouldn’t have wanted you to be. Merlin, that was the fucking of the decade. Thank fuck I’m lying down, or I would have fallen off my feet.”
mean something.
“Nevermind. It was the easy thing to want to be, I guess. I wanted to be an Auror. I wanted a wife, three kids, a nice house, and a dog.”
“Here you go,” he hands her a steaming mug of tea, sitting across from her at the big table. They look at each other for a moment, the easy, familiar gaze of long-time friends who know one another inside and out. In Hermione’s arms, baby Hugo waves his little hands in front of his face like he’s just discovered them. Then again, maybe he has.
Draco snorted lightly, a smirk creeping onto his face. “Well actually Harry, I rather believe I do...” He removed his glasses, setting them on a side table, "Need to

Malfoy let out a little laugh and knelt between Harry’s spread legs. “Such a bossy Gryffindor,” he murmured with a wicked smile. He slid his fingers into Harry’s crease. His smile broadened when he heard Harry’s breath catch. “Don’t worry, Potter. I’m not one to leave last wishes
the nagging voice in his head hisses.
Malfoy stops with one hand on the handle of the door leading to his rooms. He turns around to survey Harry with another lift of his eyebrow. “Really, Potter? Making innuendos about my personal life on your first half-hour of employment?”
Remember when we talked about Harry’s crush on Malfoy?
Fleur Delacour. George Weasley. Blaise, even. He’d interviewed them all, and he had survived. What was the worst that could happen today, really? Lovegood had always been the most harmless of the bunch.
“I have. I
Like—” Harry nips at his earlobe and Draco is interrupted by his own embarrassing squeak. “Like what?”
“You can ask him,” Harry smiles. Then considers, and adds with a rueful shrug, “You
“Where did you find this?” he asks, slowly, like the parchment is a bomb that could explode if he raises his voice.
“Maybe that’s why Harry hasn’t managed to make a meaningful break in the case,” Hermione muses. “Maybe the house is diverting his attention.”
“I’m taking care of it,” Harry says. He grabs the box — it’s big, but not overly heavy — and makes for the door at a speed he hopes projects confident nonchalance, and doesn't give away his thirst to be down at the DLF already.
Next time I see you, the first thing I’ll do is kneel between your spread legs and suck your cock until you can’t help it, until you stop being careful, until you pull my hair and groan my name and come on my face. And then... Well, I’m not going to reveal all the plot. I’ve learnt as much from the play you’re in. Cliffhangers have their uses. Like enticing you to agree to another date.
it to happen, so badly, so viscerally, that his mind had gone blank with need. He wonders what it means that Draco Malfoy was both the kindling and the match.
“Well.” Harry gazes at him, a small smile on his lips. “You looked so — confident. Anyone would feel shy in comparison.”
Because despite all his misgivings, there is something about seeing Malfoy’s face again, after all these years — after thinking that he’d left the memory of that scared, angry boy in the past — that makes him want to prod at the unexpected wave of emotion that rises in him.
“Then by all means, please go,” Draco called after her as she disappeared round the corner. In the ensuing silence, he glanced at Harry, who was still standing on the other side of the kitchen. He looked distinctly uncomfortable. It somehow melted Draco’s acrimony away. He wished he could wipe the anxious look off Harry’s face, replace it with—
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “There are several leads pointing to Ben Macdui. It would be preposterous to overlook them and you know it.” It was his turn to flash Harry his best deathly glower. “Or do you?”
“I,” growls Malfoy over a forkful of rice, “do not need help. Not from you, not from anybody, and least of all from law enforcement.”
“You know who I am. You know it better than anyone.”
“Later,” he just says, wishing everyone would have left already.
Harry had been right, as was often the case when it came to appreciating the little pieces of beauty life had to offer. Although the view that greeted them at the top of the stairs was anything but
They got married a few years later.
Harry’d been sitting on Draco’s bed, hands between his knees, watching him.
Fast.
than it does about
“That’s because you’re a gay man, Draco. Gay men are the only ones still having fun.”
Draco only leaves the Ministry when the Aurors give him his wand back and when he’s made sure Ernestina was released. “She went home an hour ago,” the DMLE assistant on duty assures him. That’s all the information Draco manages to get. The Aurors won’t tell him if she’d received proper medical care upon her arrival at the DMLE. He tries to think rationally about it, about the fact that Ernestina was brutalised in her own home, under a roof Draco’d sworn she would always be safe. About the fact that it’s common practice for the Aurors and they probably won’t be blamed for it.
“You think I wouldn’t lose anything? Are you blind?” Harry feels a deranged, crooked smile twist his lips. “I changed sides to protect you, Draco. To be with you. Or did you forget?”
[shrugs]
sorry, Potter. You may not have the best memories of me.”
Harry spent the evening with us last night. Everybody likes him. (Even though Gran Narcissa goes after him every chance she gets.) (I think she’s testing him.) (Adults are weird.)
“You’re even more skillful than your CV led me to believe.” There’s a glint in Draco’s eyes, and his mouth twists into a playful half-smile.
“It’s all right, Ernestina,” Harry tells her in what he hopes is a placating tone. He bends down to pick up the whisk and hands it to her. She takes it with a nod.
He looked embarrassed. But also excited.
Dark, massive clouds were massing to the north, rapidly advancing toward the mountains.
Harry moaned as Draco gave his cock a gentle squeeze. “Then I’m going to spread you out on the bed; on your back with your legs as high as I can get them.” There was no denying Harry's building excitement as he hummed his agreement.
** The song that Harry and Draco listen to in this chapter is

Harry can feel his voice rising from a whisper, feels like he’s shouting in the quiet bedroom. “It might have not been the case months ago, but it is now. I’m… whatever you want me to be. Your lover. Your partner. Your goddamned
“There might be… embers.”
Harry shook his head. There was no annoyance in the gesture, just affection. “Draco...I was being honest when I said this hadn’t anything to do with you. You know I don’t do interviews. Not with you. Not with anyone. And I never will.”
So normal—until Ginny’s voice snapped him out of his thoughts.
Harry felt sick. Fighting a wave of nausea and misplaced pity for a man he had once intensely disliked, he shut the folder he was browsing and stood to leave. After all, soon enough, he’d be spying on Malfoy’s secrets under the pretense of working for him — a thought that only sent another rush of guilt through him.
Draco found Harry’s hand on the arm of his chair and squeezed it.
It doesn’t have to mean anything that Harry doesn’t want it to.
he said. (I know that.) His eyes were sparkling.
He rubbed his face, mortified. “Harry, I’m so sorry. Merlin. That was the most unprofessional thing I’ve ever done.”
Not only was Harry single, but he had come out to Draco and Draco had come out to him—Draco who, apparently, was notoriously
“I’m invited to the seated dinner bit. With name cards and all.”
“No,” Potter growls. He doesn’t move from the spot he’s been standing in since the beginning of their little exchange.
explain the interview process to you when they booked the appointment?” he asked her.
“Yes,” Hermione says. “Potions without heart is Poison.” She gives him a crooked smile. “You didn’t know that, did you?”
“You're doing so good,” Draco murmurs, hiding his face in the crook of Harry’s neck. Harry lets out a little whimper and humps Draco's hip harder. “So good. You feel so good, Harry.”
*~*~*
“I was wondering if you could introduce me. In a professional manner. For a… work collaboration.” At Harry’s raised eyebrows, she explains. “The work he’s doing with Caduceus is truly groundbreaking. He’s really changing the way the wizarding world is approaching science and medicine. I’d like to offer him to work with me on a project.”
to start, aren’t you? But Harry... he’s never really had a chance to plan for the future, has he? All his life—all he’s ever done was
Harry laughed, and it seemed to mellow Granger out a bit. Glancing at Harry, she said, “It’s not just filling out the form. Sending the payment in can be tricky. Waterstones is a Muggle shop, so unless you actually make the trip to the nearest Muggle town—I’d like to see the two of you try—you'll have to find a way to pay that isn’t Galleons and Sickles. A Muggle cheque, or a bank transfer. For which you need a Muggle bank account.” She crossed her arms on the table and surveyed Draco and Harry expectantly. “Remind me again, at which Muggle bank do you have accounts open?”
“You can’t make me,” Harry’s eyes shifts from Kingsley to Ron. “I’m independent, and I’m free to choose my cases.”
there was something wrong with you, Malfoy. Of
“Draco…” Harry breathes, pressing his forehead against Draco’s, and Draco pulls him in and kisses him more.
He’d barely had time to bask in the afterglow of Draco’s orgasm and the rather good job he’d done to elicit it. A small party of guests decided the library of the house was worth visiting, and they’d burst in merely a minute after Draco had come in Harry’s mouth. Harry and Draco had hastily readjusted their clothing — and Harry had swallowed and wiped his mouth — before they’d escaped through the half-opened door while the guests had been looking at some valuable tomes at the other end of the room.
Draco lowers his eyes, the pleased blush unmistakeable across his cheekbones. Harry wants to kiss him again because kissing Draco Malfoy is intoxicating, just as he expected. It’s about the only thing that is expected about Draco Malfoy. And Harry might never want to stop kissing him at all.
Harry casts the word like a Stupefy
“How is Scorpius?” Draco sounds like he’s only had those three words in mind for hours.
Luna looked up at the ceiling, deep in thought.
“We don’t have to talk about it.”
“Yeah.” Harry fiddles with the bottom of his jumper. He’s the one who agreed to jump down this rabbithole of confessions. “Many people I admired were Aurors… lots of members of the Order, you know.” Malfoy nods, his expression level. Harry carries on: “I thought I wanted to be an Auror because it was the only thing I could think of. It was a cool job; an important one. Kind of like wanting to be a firefighter when you’re five.”
“I’m so fucking proud of you,” Harry tells him, equally soft, but everyone can hear.
Draco had leaned in and kissed Harry some more. “So who’d have known you were such a massive sap, Harry Potter?”
“Exactly. We don’t have long.” He teased the buckle of his belt. “Or have you changed your mind, Malfoy?”
“Package for the D… LF.” Harry Potter walks through the door, holding a big cardboard box under one arm and an empty takeaway coffee cup in the other. Then the coffee cup falls to the floor, and he freezes.
God, Malfoy was hot. Tight. He made a sound that gave Harry pause. Harry felt him shake his head.
“Please always be this incoherent after a blowjob,” Draco said, wiping the back of his hand across his chin. “It’s really flattering.” He tried to sound nonchalant. The quiver in his voice betrayed him miserably.
Smith’s face turns redder.
Malfoy. I kind of have… this ridiculous fantasy about you. You’re fit and—I like—” Merlin, he was struggling to get the words out. “I like to imagine how you could… feel like. If we ever… you know.” He shrugged with a dismissive laugh. “I told you it was stupid.”
Draco. Do it for our sanity, if not for yours.”
Luna was gazing at him, unwavering. Draco wondered how much she knew. The girl had always had the detached, bluntly forthright quality of a Seer.
Draco pulled out a few inches, his hands gripping Harry’s hips, then slammed back in as Harry cried out. Draco did it again and again, every thrust rougher and needier than the one before,
“I knew you’d been looking. You never were the subtle kind, were you?”
This, too, feels like a lie.
Harry’s eyes darkened. “Merlin, Draco...“
He'd thought he’d have more time to rest after his last mission. He’d come in from Shanghai only yesterday. The task—infiltrating and exposing a network of Chinese spies who posed as interns and collected information on British Unspeakables’ experiments—had taken him half a year to complete. He missed London. He missed his bed. He still feels jet-lagged and woozy from the long Portkey trip. Kingsley, however, had been adamant. So Harry'd assumed he had no choice in the matter and left Grimmauld Place that morning, resolving to ask Kingsley for double the days off next time he wanted to take a holiday.
“And then what?” His nostrils flare, like he’s forcing to maintain eye contact with Harry. “What would you have done with that information, Harry?”
“Draco,” he says, placating. “Does it have to be a secret? It’s nothing shameful. It’s actually quite brilliant.”
Two: he would have to explain why he’d let said thief suck him off instead.
Draco swallowed. He knew all too well what had happened two weeks ago.
When he comes to, Harry’s humming softly against his cheek, his clean hand stroking Draco’s damp hair away from his face. They’ve had sex, quick and rough, loveless in everything but the soft touches of Harry’s hands in the aftermath. Things he can never allow himself to take for granted. Things he must never let Harry take for granted. Even though it might be too late, even as Harry rocks them together, as slow and tender as he was hard and possessive a minute before.
Harry took a step back. He couldn’t believe how close he’d come to Malfoy. Close enough to feel the heat of his body behind the cold exterior. Malfoy was like a magnet. A magnet that was far too gorgeous for Harry’s good.
“That knocking on our own office door is redundant and pointless?” Lavender adds.
Harry doesn’t rise to the sarcasm. Eyes on Malfoy’s face, he says, truthfully: “I only just recently discovered that… a wife might not be what I’m looking for.” And he watches with fascination as Malfoy stares back at him with wide eyes.
Just when he’s about to start fidgeting again, a door he hadn’t noticed opens behind him, and he hears someone pronounce his name.
“That's not all there is to it, though, is it? Removing a threat to one’s life isn't the same as—as finding a reason to look forward to living.”
He gave his head a shake. “I wasn’t brave enough to even pick a side and stick to it. People died because of me. I never meant for that to happen. I never thought...”
Until Harry’s eyes stop on Draco’s left forearm resting against his side, the pale skin and faded Dark Mark exposed by his rolled-up sleeves. Draco hears Harry’s sharp intake of breath and freezes.
The cut-glass accent is so familiar Harry’s heart aches with abrupt nostalgia.
“I do. Clearly, you’re living up to the high expectations.”
doesn’t make Harry feel any better.
Gripping Draco’s arse through his jeans, Harry moves impossibly closer, bites at Draco’s neck. “I’ll suck your cock, I’ll—I’ll
“I told you you had five minutes,” Penelope says, hands behind her back, walking a slow circle around them. “In my great magnanimity, I gave you ten.” She stops and studies them from above. “I assume that gave you ample time to sort your… quarrel?”
Draco lifted his hands in surrender. “Of course! Real life takes precedence. I’ll wait here.”
“So what’s wrong?” Draco said defensively.
“I know,” Draco says. He taps his fingers against the leather blotter on his desk. “I understand. I need to find someone to replace you, though. And trust me, that won't be an easy task.”
“Thanks, Malfoy,” Harry snorted. “But you still haven’t told me what
“The disclaimer?”
“Well...” Malfoy hesitates. Harry stifles a snort, and Malfoy turns to him with a baleful lift of his eyebrow. “I’ve always called him ‘Potter,’” he finishes weakly, and even Harry knows he’s not going to get away with that one.
“You sure about this, mate?” Ron calls from behind him, but the door has already shut behind Harry, and he’s hurtling down the stairs, two at a time, magical objects clattering inside the box.
And it’s been so long since he’s wanted anything.
“I can’t give too many details about my job, but let’s just say I specialise in the field of Healing research for the Ministry.”
A happy bark, and Balzac barges into the foyer, skidding to a halt in front of Ernestina and wagging his tail excitedly. He runs towards Harry and jumps on him, barking some more. Harry ignores Ernestina’s disapproving scowl and laughs, scratching the dog’s ears.
Harry snorted then seemed to think better of it. Draco realised his mistake, too late to do anything about it: mentioning Headmasters, however mental they could have been, had to rank high on the scale of bad decisions coming from Draco. He had tried to murder one of them, after all. He looked away, feeling the heat of mortification prickle the back of his neck. “I’m sorry,” he murmured, his words floating in the silence of the corridor.
"These will be next to go..." Draco murmured against Harry's lips, his nimble fingers popping the top button, before moving to the next. "They're very much—" he felt Harry's lips quirk up into a smile as this button also gave way, "—a hindrance—" Draco continued, taking a moment to gently squeeze the weighty bulge straining the last button, "—to my plans." He finished on a sigh, shoving the offending denims downward.
They were crinkled in a grateful smile.
I don't like metaphors. (Dr Dawson said that’s what that type of sentence is called.) I think it's the adults’ way of keeping private the things they don't want to share.
“More,” he asked, hoping he was still far from begging. Malfoy seemed like a relatively considerate lover, but he’d not like to give him cause to gloat if he could avoid it.
He’s a Slytherin. He’s Draco Malfoy. Keeping the façade is how he made it this far in life.
fault, now? Can’t you ever be straightforward, Draco? Even with your friends?”
“No. Malfoy —
Surprised and pleased, Draco laughed. He caught Harry’s eyes across the table, over the rim of his glass of pumpkin juice. His green eyes sparkled with mirth as well as something Draco couldn’t decipher.
The sex was glorious — with Draco, it always has been, and Harry doesn’t mind a rough shag from time to time. At all.
Another sudden gust of wind, ice-cold and fierce, whipped their faces. It seemed to slap Malfoy into action. He turned to look at Harry, face serious but for the tiniest smirk slowly lifting the corner of his mouth. “Last one to reach the shelter is a bag of putrescent Flobberworms?”
“Mistor?”
seen the sign on Muggle pharmacies, Potter?” Draco sits next to him. His expression is suddenly unreadable, and Harry’s not sure he likes it.

the chance to buy fancy drinks for his best friend. Hell, he even has a promotion to celebrate tonight. Commanding in his brand new Senior Auror uniform, Ron is the embodiment of serene success. By contrast, all Harry has going on for himself is an untucked shirt and black hair that seems to grow messier as years go by. Not only is Harry an idler, he’s an unkempt one at that.
“That is the thing, though,” Kingsley says. “When Malfoy started his company, he was twenty-four, and he wasn’t supposed to have that kind of money. In reality, he wasn’t supposed to have
Draco’s stomach dropped. Jeff had stopped running to bat his little paws at the birds. Charybd and Scylla took flight only to dive and peck him with their sharp beaks again. Protecting his head, the poor animal was half howling in pain, half cursing Mephistopheles’s ravens to the ends of Hell.
Maybe the first encounter with his boyfriend’s mother — is Draco his
Malfoy props his head in his hand. “Harry, I fucking loved it, okay? You were rough when you needed to be, and gentle all the way through. I’m going to feel the burn for the next three days, you’re so fucking hung.” He snuggles up to Harry, purring like a cat. “Now, I suppose that even among heterosexuals, it’s bad form to go fishing for compliments after sex, isn’t it?”
“Not if we’re both in a position to get in trouble,” he says, and smirks.
Make fun of me all you want. I’m a changed man.)
“Hello,” I whisper. “Hello, Balzac. Good boy.”
readership?
“It means palm tree, and Hagrid said she fit right into his palm when she was born. She’s still pretty small even now at two weeks old.”
Pansy, on the other hand, had been another kettle of fish. She’d already known why Draco was firecalling her, as she had reminded him by brandishing a copy of the

sounds about right, Harry thinks, remembering Draco’s cleaning charm and feeling his ears go hot. After everything, then, he’s feeling shy again. Bashful. Tentative. He approaches Draco’s desk, slides two fingers over the side of the mahogany table.
Harry stares at him in the dark, chest rising and falling with his breath. “What? To say it? I don't care.”
“I’ve been hard since the moment I saw you at that fucking reunion, Potter,” Malfoy said between panting breaths.
He grabbed his wand and swished it. The drapes of his four-poster bed slid closed around him, and he didn’t wait to plunge his hand into his pants and take hold of his stiff cock with a sigh of relief. Oh, this was going to be fast. He wouldn’t even have time to cast Silencing spells. He started wanking, a few slow strokes at first, just to test the waters. His cock spurted a long trickle of precome and Draco’s eyes rolled. Turning his face on the pillow, he bit back a moan. Umphff, okay, definitely a fast one this time. He moved his hand up and down his hard prick, faster, harder, marveling in the way his body responded, thanking every last corner of Hell for giving him a human form to live his lives, biting his lip when he let his fingers linger around the crown, teasing the foreskin before wrapping around his shaft again and resuming his frantic wanking. His head was full of Harry’s recalled presence. How real he’d felt, so ordinary in his jeans and hand-knit jumper and mismatched socks, how touchable his skin has looked, how close to kissing they’d come, how green and warm his eyes were when they locked with Draco’s—
So, in a nutshell: we won. You lost. Suck it.
In the quiet early morning stillness of the Muggle street, the knock on Luna Lovegood’s door resounded like a hammer putting the final nails in a coffin. Draco’s shaky exhalation formed white clouds in the cold air. He squeezed his hands under his arms, the leather satchel containing his notebook and Self-Inking Quick-Quotes Quill safely tucked against his chest. Come to think of it, the wizarding cloak draped across his shoulders was probably a bit conspicuous. He should have Transfigured it into something more suitable for the area—a wool peacoat, perhaps, or one of those puffy down jackets that seemed in fashion among Muggles these days. He shifted his weight from one leg to the other, wondering how out of place he must seem to potential onlookers.
Until recently.”
“Yet I keep showing up,” he says. “It’s almost like I’ve nothing better to do.”
a career fitting for a Malfoy?”
“No,” Harry says, shaking his head.
Harry holds him tighter, snorts a small laugh that reverberates through Draco’s chest. “Yes, you bloody great moron. Friends.”
A shame that Harry’s past the point of a reluctant crush for Draco.
Draco stood near the sofa, unsure what to do next.
“Oh, here you are!” Hermione waves at Harry over Ron’s shoulder as Harry approaches. Then she turns back to the Petersons and smiles. “This is our friend, Harry.”
The study leads to another room.
“I withdrew from the case.” Ron lifts his big blue eyes to Harry. “I just wasn’t objective about it anymore. Assuming I ever was…” He huffs a rueful laugh. “I’ve seen the way Malfoy answered ‘Mione’s nagging for a meeting.”
“Yes, my dear,” Andromeda stood with a crooked smile. Draco groaned inwardly.
Ron takes the stool Harry’s just vacated, a thin frown between his brows.
Regards,
“You should know… this isn’t just an opportunistic fuck,” Malfoy said quietly, as if there was a chance Harry wouldn’t hear him. “Not for me, at least.”
Harry licked his lips.
Ron,” Hermione scolded softly.
Draco lets out a frustrated growl. “Will you stop — being so bloody Gryffindor about everything?” he asks through gritted teeth.
“And what did he say?” Ron prods.
The first time Harry had seen Malfoy at the Ministry had been in the cafeteria, roughly a year previous. It was in the middle of his lunch with Ron. After three years as an Auror, Harry had developed a routine: lunch at the Ministry cafeteria with Ron every day at quarter past twelve, except on Wednesdays when they bought samosas and balti curry from the Indian food truck that stopped in one of the small streets near Scotland Yard.
“You’ve nothing to worry about,” Draco says, lower, urgent. “Whatever you do, just — feeling you up against me —  Merlin, you’ve no idea… You’re doing
I also apologise for going with the criticism first - criticism on things you can’t change, like your face or your accent or those interminable legs of yours. I probably missed a few lines of dialogue at some point, staring at your legs.
That shuts Draco up for a second. Then he hisses:
“Look,” Pansy said.
“Takes one to know one.”
Malfoy definitely falls into the latter category.
Harry had looked at Draco from over his bowl.
Penelope lifts her eyebrows. “How?”
attacked me for it. There were a few articles published about how I was wasting my time and energy saving animals when there were people who had lost their homes, who had sustained grave injuries, who were missing loved ones. As if one cause was exclusive to another.” She raised her eyes to Draco, and he nodded for her to continue. “I didn’t read the articles. I’ve never paid attention to what people said about me. I see my work as part of a big picture that everyone will benefit from in the end. I can only paint a small part of it—but I can do it well, and meaningfully. That’s what kept me going. That’s what helped me push away memories of flashing curses and burnt flesh. Defining the role I wanted to play in our post-war world was my way of moving on.”
Malfoy nuzzles the side of his jaw, a sleepy, intimate gesture. “Oh, I can’t wait to tell Pansy about this. She’s been rooting for me to get fucked for ages.”
“Is ‘special quill for Romanian legal agreements’ too specific, or not enough?”
“In the negative. Believe me.”
Malfoy sinks more comfortably in his seat, hands on the armrests, and returns his gaze to the dancers on stage. The music is as graceful as it is emotional and loud, mercifully drowning Harry's own cacophonous emotions. He and Malfoy lapse into silence for a while, watching the ballerinas swirl and sway like swans on dark waters.
“Used to?”
“Fuck,” he says, almost a sob, and fists his hands in Harry’s hair.
“I might

There was a variety of reactions when our relationship became public. I assume you expected that. However...did anything surprise you in the midst of the media turmoil? Anything you didn’t expect?
“Don’t be an arse. Have you only come here to remind me of my lack of worth—both professional and personal?”
so enthusiastically.
Malfoy mutters against Harry’s jaw. Harry snorts, and to his surprise and delight, he feels Malfoy shake with silent laughter against him. Like they’re schoolboys, hiding from the Prefects doing their rounds.
“I know you don’t need it.” Harry lets his arm fall to his side. “I’m still doing it. I didn’t know… I don’t know how to make amends for it.”
“Feels so grown-up, doesn’t it?”
Draco Malfoy was exactly as Harry remembered him. The same tall, slim frame. The same attention to detail in the perfect cut of his shirt and trousers. The same artless elegance in his movements.
It’s like flying amidst the heat of Fiendfyre, grappling for Harry with his whole body, thinking he’s about to die — only it’s the exact opposite emotion of that. He’s never felt more
you!”—the latter coming, ironically, from Draco’s good friend Blaise.
“Thanks,” Harry tells him, a lopsided little grin tugging at his lips.
“Will you let me interview you, Harry?”
“No, I think that was all,” Harry said hastily, smoothing the front of his uniform as he moved to leave. Thank Merlin for ample Auror robes. Just staring at Malfoy’s eyes, dark with promise, was enough to make him painfully hard. He couldn’t let Head Auror Smith notice he was hot for his Auror partner—well, not so soon, anyway.
He was almost exactly the same.
“Draco Malfoy has been in the Ministry’s sights for quite some time now, Harry. As you may or may not be aware, the man has built a literal empire with Caduceus over the course of just a few years. That isn’t a problem in itself. What poses question, however, is the
Three days later, Harry’s at the doorstep of Draco’s Sloane Square townhouse, standing under the rain and an umbrella charm, a pathetic echo of the same morning, four months before.
“Thank you.”
Harry swallows. The room is so quiet he can hear Balzac’s tail swishing against the marble floor in the foyer, Draco’s quiet exchange with Ernestina down in the kitchen. He can hear the rustle of Narcissa’s brocade robes when she moves to clutch her hands in front of her. He nods, slowly, and Narcissa’s expression softens.
“Aunt Andromeda? Mind if I hand you Teddy back? I think I’m ready to call it a night.”
“Are you done with classes, then?” Hermione asked the Seventh Year girls when the laughter had died down.
McGonagall extended her hand towards him, both a reassuring gesture and an instruction to keep quiet. She must have seen the look of disbelief on his face.
“McGonagall wants to see us,” Harry said over his shoulder.
“Well, yeah.” Harry eyed him curiously. “You do know they're dating, right?”
, if Draco remembered correctly. He’d sat in these lessons so many times, in so many of his past lives, the curriculum was seared in his brain.
Hermione Granger’s impossibly sharp dark eyes lifted up to meet his, half-obscured by a mane of bushy brown hair.
Was there tongue?
were at the receiving end of my bullying quite often.
He crowds Harry against the wall of the lift as they make their way up the building.
“Hello.” He smiles, very close to Harry’s face. Harry laughs some more.
And so it goes, for three endless weeks, during which Harry loses sleep and fears losing his mind. He wanks several times a day to memories of Malfoy’s lifted eyes, to memories of a hot, wet mouth, and it’s still not enough to calm Harry down.
“What’s going on?” Ginny asked, walking towards them. She canted her head to take a better look at the Niffler. “Hey, little one,” she smiled sweetly. “It’s over. I took care of the bad birds. They’ll learn it’s wise to never be found on the receiving end of my hexes.”
“What is it?”
With an enthusiastic groan, Malfoy kissed him back, his hands rising to cup Harry’s face, sliding into his hair, pulling possessively. Harry moaned into his mouth, chasing the warmth of it with his tongue, finding Malfoy’s tongue and touching it tentatively first, then in a slow, languid caress that made Malfoy melt against him. Hands roaming Malfoy’s back, Harry pulled him close, diving into the kiss, blood pounding in his ears. They  slid to the floor without realising it. When Malfoy groaned into his mouth and pressed his body closer—fuck, Harry could feel the hard edge of his erection through their Auror robes—they toppled to the ground, Malfoy on top of him, pressed between his legs.
Malfoy clearly likes men, fucks men, and wants that information to be plain to everyone who lays eyes on him.
And the strange feeling has followed Harry everywhere since then, like the chaffing of a rough label on an otherwise comfortable t-shirt.
Like any sane person, Harry had questioned his decision to come to the tenth year Hogwarts reunion from the moment he’d set foot in the Great Hall. He couldn’t imagine what drove people who actually looked forward to these things. To him, a school reunion could be summed up in three “X”s: ex-friends, ex-girlfriends, ex-people he’d gotten into fist fights with. The people he was still friends with, he obviously still saw. The people he liked to date nowadays had little chance to be here. As for getting into fist fights, he’d dropped out of the habit after one too many of his drunken rows had made the cover of every wizarding tabloid under the British sun. As such, Harry’s interest in the school reunion was minimal. The event was bound to be awkward, full of unpleasant memories, and constantly interrupted by sycophants hoping to get Harry Potter’s autograph.
“Ernestina can send Mistor Potter away until half past eleven.”
He pours two glasses of wine and pushes one towards Malfoy. Malfoy takes a sip, closing his eyes and making a small sound of approval. Harry decides to finally say something, anything, before Malfoy notices that he’s been staring pathetically at his lips, trying hard not to remember what Malfoy’s talented mouth can do.
Malfoy’s face was turned to the north, his white-blond eyebrows knit together. With a sinking feeling, Harry followed his gaze.
“Come on,” he says with a cheeky half-smile. “I need my bodyguard with me when I run.” And together they jog down the wet pavement towards the entrance of the park.
Harry walks back out on the landing, nodding at Malfoy as he heads for Scorpius’s room.
I love it. Let’s do this.
“I rest my case, Potter.”
Draco swallowed. Then set his champagne glass on the table behind him. His heart was thudding in his skull, his mouth gone dry. Potter hadn’t even bothered with an innuendo.
“Draco?” Matilda calls from near the door. “Could you show me again, please? I bend just fine, I think, but I’m not sure the ‘snap’ part looks very sexy yet.”
