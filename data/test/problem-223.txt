He piled his plate high, thankful for the distraction the food gave him as he was a little scared of how far his thoughts might go considering the slytherin had such an exceptional reputation in the art of sexual acts that even he knew about it. Later as he lay in bed he would think more on that but right now he just focused on the treacle that has just appeared before him.
Harry froze at the husky sound to his voice and obediently stood still as the older boy raked his gaze along Harry's body. He then tentatively took a step towards Harry as though nervous and then quickly shook himself and backed away. Draco suddenly looked very uncomfortable.
Dumbledore was there! He would make it right. Surely he wouldn't get expelled with Dumbledore in the room right?
Harry was smart enough to know that he wasn't going to be able to get anything else out of him so he left it.
Harry and Draco weren't exactly close, sure they're conversations had gotten less murderous in private throughout the length of the project, but nothing that would explain the level of concern and slight fear shining through Draco's usually well placed mask and he just stares in shock "what do you care Malfoy?"
Draco smiled at him and waved his wand, revealing a blanket obviously taken from the slytherin dorms, some food, and a telescope "I thought we could have a nice night somewhere other then the library"
"Alright Harry this is it. Don't know why'd they'd hold the hearing down here though. Anyways. Get on your way don't want to be late. I'll be back by the time it ends to take you home."
Harry followed him into the courtroom and took a seat in the lonely chair in the middle of the room.
Harry smiled at her thankfully. It was just what he needed to hear. He turned back to the table and blurted out:
He was about a third of the way through when who should appear but the blonde haired, grey eyed weasel Harry was all too affected by. Surprisingly he sat down and they worked in silence for a long while before Harry got up to go find a book, and Draco trailed after him.
He sat in his bed for what felt like hours and hours until the sun came up and he heard the Dursley's starting to move, which meant he had to start going as well.
"So this is Headquarters for the Order Of The Phoenix. It's a group of witches and wizards Dumbledore has gathered to help defeat You Know Who." he said hesitantly.
"Hello and thank you for contacting the Ministry Of Magics visitors office how may I help you" Harry could hear the phone saying.
He woke up every day either numb, or heavy with indescribable sadness. His feelings bottled up inside with no way to escape him and honestly it made his skin itch and feel too tight. He was drowning in himself but he couldn't let anyone know. He was the Chosen One. He wasn't supposed to feel weighed down or upset or scared because he could take down Voldemort! But Harry didn't feel that way at all.
Ms Weasley was downstairs making breakfast and snacks for the train, Mr Weasley was reading the paper, Sirius was laughing with Fred and George, Tonks was making faces at Ginny causing her to snort into her pudding, Hermione had her nose in a book while petting Crookshanks, and Ron was pacing quickly most likely nervous to be a prefect.
As Harry and Draco's affair continued their feelings for eachother only grew, of course they had to keep up the act of antagonizing eachother in public buy in private it was laughs and fuzz. Harry's main problem was worrying about Hermione and Ron.
Draco was silent for a moment before he says, his voice laced with anger and hatred. "Why do I care? Why do I care?! Well believe it or not Potter but unfortunately I care about you you overgrown barn rat. I am infuriatingly and unforgivably cursed by your stupid emerald eyes and dumb messy raven hair that gives me the irresistible urge to run my fingers through it to tame it down. I hate you and everything you stand for and yet I can't help but notice when you don't eat or sleep or change something and great Merlin I am unfortunately I'm love with you you-"
Soon enough Harry and Draco's potion project is finished and handed in so Harry expects that to be the last he hears of Draco so close to him, but then why was he finding him everywhere? In the library, courtyard, honey dukes, Draco was always there. It was driving Harry insane.
And hour and 3 servings of food later, Harry and Mr Weasley were at the door about to leave. Ms Weasley hovered around them pressing a piece of toast into Harry's hands, Ron and Hermione hugged him and wished him luck, and Fred and George cracked jokes about Harry getting expelled. Ms Weasley kept reprimanding them for it but personally Harry thought the jokes were a riot.
Once the train started and had pulled away from the station, Hermione and Ron got up to go to the Prefects compartment.
"This is our schedule. I would urge you to stick to it Potter I would prefer not to get a failing grade"  he sneered. Harry just nodded and turn to place the paper in his bag. He wasn't sure he trusted himself to speak at the moment.
"Well, well, we'll, Potter. Back for another year? I'd think you'd have thought twice after last years events. Poor little Potter facing the big bad Dark Lord." Malfoy taunted.
He had just been sitting there in The Three Broomsticks with Ron and Hermione, nursing a butterbeer, when the familiar drawl of the Malfoy heir came from behind him.
"Well sir me and my cousin, Dudley, we're walking down the street and all of a sudden it just got cold. And everything went dark. And Dudley was freaking out. I saw dementors and what they did to people last year at Hogwarts so I knew it was a dementor when I started feeling sad and like nothing would ever make me happy ever again. It was awful. Professor Lupin had taught me the Patronus Charm last year and a dementor had grabbed Dudley and was about to kiss him so you see I had no choice but to use the Patronus Charm sir."
Harry realized just before he got to his dormitory that he'd had detention with Umbridge that night. Shit. He thought checking his watch. Shit shit shit shit shit. He'd missed almost half of it and that surely meant he'd be getting more.
"It's nothing Hermione it's just Umbridge's dumb form of punishment." He shrugged it off but the stubborn girl would not be swayed. She held out her hand expectantly while staring him down. Honestly she scared him sometimes and he recognized the glint in her eyes well enough that he knew that if he didn't comply he'd be in some serious trouble, so he sighed and gave in placing his hand gingerly in hers.
As everyone had already packed most of the stuff they needed it was rather calmer then usual but the house was still amuck with people running around grabbing things from abandoned rooms and throwing them into their trunks.
"Your not old enough to apparate and the Flo can be traced. We don't need anyone knowing where we are Harry" Remus explained softly.
They got out and went over to security. After a good deal of waiting in line the security officer inspected Harry's wand and deemed him fit to enter. They crossed the room to the Golden lifts and got in. Mr Weasley started talking to a large man and Harry decided he didn't want to listen, though he wished he had when Mr Weasley turned around looking pale and shocked.
Harry ran upstairs to join Hermione and Ron and he spent his last free night of summer vacation, he'd have to pack the next day, talking and laughing and playing around with his best friends.
It went on like that for about an hour. They wanted to tell Dumbledore but in the end he convinced them that he wouldn't be able to do anything as she was placed there by the ministry. After begrudgingly agreeing Hermione and Ron went up to their respective dormitories and Harry followed behind closely.
By the time things started going bad the Trolley Witch had already come and gone, and they were just finishing the last of the chocolate frogs, when Harry heard footsteps and the door to their compartment slid open.
Harry laughed and they kissed and talked and cuddled and talked some more and eventually the two boys fell into silence. Harry could think of no better place to be right now, huddled up with his boyfriend under a heating charm they'd cast watching the stars. He let his guard down and he felt genuinely happy for the first time in a very very long time. He'd worry about Ron and Hermione and the future another day, right now all he wanted to focus on was how Dracos hair turned silver in the moonlight and how relaxed he looked. He was content to spend the rest of his life there with him and never move at all from where Draco had laid them down. Harry didn't think that his life could get bad again because all he could think about was his boyfriends heartbeat and hopefully lasting relationship. Nothing could ever possibly stain that relationship could it?
Harry’s almost late for his trial, he gets to go in a moving telephone box, and Ms Weasley is a kind ass human as usual.
He stood there dumbstruck for a couple of minutes before walking back to his dormitory wondering what in merlins pants had just happened.
Harry laid in his bed that night trying to sleep, but alas he couldn't. He kept seeing Draco's eyes roving over his body and no matter how hard he tried to stop, and he tried very hard, all he could think of was Draco standing there in his rumpled sleep clothes telling him to stay in that growling voice. Hell Harry was getting a hard-on just thinking about it. At least it distracted him from his hand.
He dragged himself out of bed and slowly got himself ready for the day, putting on a shirt and combing through his unruly hair with his hands. Letting his emotions shut off into that now familiar numbness that he'd been feeling since the end of the Triwizard Tournament.
It had been a Friday when he was assigned to work with Draco and so he'd had all weekend to feel sorry for himself and dwell moodily over the boy who had captured his heart as well as his dreams apparently. He'd had a new one appear over the weekend that consisted of them working together in the potions room and Draco touching him inappropriately under the desk as Harry struggled to keep a straight face.
Defense was as boring as usual. Umbitch, as most of the school had taken to calling her, had insisted that there be no practical lessons in her class. All they did was answer questions from the black board and read the books she had assigned. It was awful.
They walked into the station, Sirius trotting along behind them in his dog form, and geared up to run into the platform. They went in pairs, Fred and George first, then Mr Weasley and Sirius, Then Ms Weasley and Ginny, and finally Harry and Ron.
So he waited. He walked around all day, rather jittery, and was unusually quiet. As dinner approached he just closed more into himself.
Harry looked around feeling as though he should be happier, more excited, but instead all he felt was rather sad. He would miss Sirius and it wouldn't be the same with Ron on Prefect duty all the time. But as he didn't want to ruin anyone else's day, he plastered on a fake smile and sat down.
Wait. Did he just see Draco look him over? It seemed like it. Harry stood there a bit longer and...Yes! There. He just did it again! Harry was no expert in flirting but it definitely seemed like Draco was bloody checking him out! He made the move to leave but halted when he heard Draco growl "stop"
"Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge, Minister For Magic; Amelia Susan Bones, Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement; Dolores Jane Umbridge, Senior Undersecretary to the Minister; Court Scribe, Percy Ignatius Weasley-"
“Please Harry this would be great for all of us” Hermione begged while they were walking into the Entrance Hall. Harry opened his mouth to respond, but Hermione cut him off saying “And don’t you dare say your not qualified your the best at Defense in our year and you’ve defeated You Know Who 4 times!” Harry scowled and shot back “I was only a baby the first time and I don’t even know how I did it” but Hermione just levelled him with a stern glare and said “Exactly”
He stuttered over Draco's name and severely hoped Ron hadn't noticed. Fortunately Ron was busy covertly staring at Hermione so he just muttered a "s'don't ask me" as Harry rolled his eyes.
He looked on in disbelief as Number 11 and Number 13 Grimmauld Place started shaking and moving apart to reveal a grim greyish black coloured building between them. The lights shook and things rattled all around but the Muggles didn't seem to notice. There must be some sort of magic on the place then thought Harry.
Harry, not knowing exactly what to think about all this, followed Ms Weasleys instructions and climbed the stairs. No sooner had he gotten to the top then he was greeted by Hermione's lightening fast beat hug.
He gathered his stuff and sent and sat himself down next to his sworn enemy and now crush feeling the blush creeping up his neck as he remembered his dream from the other night. Draco just scowled at him. Harry put his hands up in a
At that almost everyone started laughing and Harry sat down. The rest of the dinner was very comfortable with people congratulating him and cracking jokes and the like. Harry thought that it was amazing that everyone was just so, accepting! In the muggle world people weren't near as accepting as they were, None the less he loved all of them there for accepting him as he is.
Harry intoned in an almost venomous voice, before walking out the room and thundering down the stairs to the door of the kitchens where the meeting was being held.
The rest of the train ride went like that, pretty uneventfully. Sooner then he would have liked, it was time to get their robes on as the train was starting to slow down.
While Ms Weasley is congratulating Ron and Hermione yet again on becoming prefects, Harry looks around the station to see all the other students being sent off by their parents.
Oh my god. It’s over. Finally. My writers block had me bad with that one holy crap. It’s almost 1 in the morning when I’m writing this so I’m going to do this quickly but I just wanted to say thank you to every single person who read this and that since this is an open ending, feel free to write your own fics that take place after this! Or even from Draco’s point of view! So many ideas!! Just make sure to give me credit either on here: pipedream69
Eventually a carriage pulled up in front of them and Ron and Hermione moved to get in. But Harry couldn't bring himself to move because instead of the carriages pulling themselves there was something in front! A big black skeletal being that looked vaguely like a horse was pulling each carriage!
The young witch with purple hair followed him up to help and he found out her name was Tonks, or at least that's what she liked to be called.
“Nice room, Harry.” He said, glancing around at the Quidditch posters on the wall, along with some muggle bands and some pictures of Harry, Ron and Hermione. “So, what should we do today?”
a good kisser. He heard a silence fall around him as they kissed, and he smiled against Theodore’s lips. They stayed like that for a few more seconds before they finally pulled away and noise erupted around them.
that no good would come of him saying it now, it wouldn’t change anything, but it all spilled out anyway. “But, I love you.” And there it was. Harry Potter confessed his love for Draco Malfoy. For the first time ever. And it couldn’t be worse timing.
Sorry for the long wait - I've been really busy and this fic is turning out to be longer than expected! I'm updating as quickly as possible!
Draco rolled his eyes. “Merlin knows. There’s always someone new with him.” Harry laughed. “He’s probably already left, the lucky bugger.”
different circumstances, but he was thankful that Ron was introducing them by their first names. It felt like… A fresh start, in a way.
“To some people, I suppose.” Draco’s voice was sort of cold, and Harry worried that he had messed it up again, but Draco turned on his side to face Harry. “Of course, my family knew. I never told them, but they knew. We all had a really fun silent arrangement where everyone pretended I was straight and acted as though the idea of producing a Malfoy heir was appealing to me.”
Draco smiled as he slid the ring on his pinky finger, watching as it magically adjusted to his size. Harry had bought him a ring that looked like a snake with green sparkly eyes wrapping itself around his finger.
They stared into each other’s eyes for a few moments, before Harry broke the silence. “I don’t care. You’re not that person anymore.”
Christmas went by in a blur, full of celebrations, gifts, food and Draco. It was the same as every year, apart from the fact there was one less laugh at the table, one less mouth to feed and one less jumper for Molly to knit. Well, Harry supposed, that wasn’t entirely true. Much to Harry’s surprise, Molly had knitted Draco a Slytherin green jumper with his initial on it and had told Harry to “make sure the Malfoy boy gets it”. Harry tried not to read too much into this, tried not to think about the fact that she didn’t even knit
“I’m sorry, Harry.” Draco whispered, tears falling slowly down his cheek. He turned around to leave, but took a breath and turned back towards Harry. He placed a kiss on his cheek, lingering for a few moments, and then sighed and turned back around, leaving Harry’s flat and placing his key on the table beside the door as he went.
Draco cleared his throat loudly to ensure nobody else would start speaking. “Apologies, Professor.” He said, his voice smooth. He knew that he couldn’t lie, and Harry could see him struggling to come up with an explanation, so Harry spoke instead, popping his head around Draco’s body.
“You need to know that I’m fine with it. It doesn’t bother me anymore.” Draco said, avoiding Harry’s eyes.
Draco gripped Harry’s hand tighter, trying to hold back a snort, and Harry held back a smile. “I’m terribly sorry. I wouldn’t normally ask, but that charm will show some rather… private things, and I’d like it if you could erase the footage from today? I don’t think you’d want to see what’s on there, anyway.” He smiled sweetly.
She smiled innocently as she looked between the two of them, before eventually speaking in a voice so sweet it could make your teeth rot. “Draco, darling.” Draco groaned. “Truth or dare?”
Hermione gave Harry a small nod, but then shook her head again. “I’ll talk to him if you talk to Draco.”
Malfoy laughed. “Exactly. Basically all of the Pureblood Slytherins, to be honest.” Wow, there really was a theme here. “And, you.”
Harry and Draco had bid them all farewell, neither of them mentioning the fact that both of them should likely be leaving, too. By this point, the only other students in the common room were sixth and seventh years who were still in the midst of studying.
“What do you need?” He asked, looking at the two students’ robes. They both seemed out of breath, their buttons were done up wrong and their hair was rather messy. Harry had to fight to hold back a smirk at the sight.
Harry needn’t have worried, though, because it seemed as though an odd sort of silence spread across the common room as his fellow Gryffindors realised who was left in the room with them. After about ten minutes, the other students left and Harry and Draco were the only ones left in the common room.
Harry was sure he had forgotten how to breathe, and as Malfoy turned the pair of them around, his movements graceful, Harry saw hundreds of eyes on them.
Ginny smirked. She stood up from where she was sitting on the armchair of the sofa, looked around the room and smiled. At first, Harry thought she was looking at him, and his eyes widened (they were friendly exes, but not
Draco looked down. “He owns all of my mother’s assets. He’s threatening to take them away from her if I continue to see you.”
But, he remembered now. That was when all of his dreams had started. He had woken up feeling like shit, with no recollection of why he felt so bad, but it was clear and vivid now. He had seen the dark mark, moving and contorting in shapes that weren’t natural, and Malfoy was there. He, too, was moving in an unnatural way, his eyes squeezed shut. He was suffocating, and he his hands were grasping at the snake that was wrapped around his neck, trying to pull it off, until his eyes finally opened. And his face changed. He stopped grasping at the snake, instead reaching out to Harry, his hands desperate. Until, finally, his hands went limp and his eyes went blank. And Harry had woken up.
Seamus put his arm around Dean and pulled him close. “I had to tell Harry, he’s the reason we’re together.”
He sat listening to Draco’s deep breathing for around half an hour before Draco woke up, inhaling sharply and mumbling, almost incoherently, “What time is it?”
Hermione rolled her eyes. “This is apparently the most interesting thing to happen at the Ministry since Ron started working there. And he catches bloody criminals!”
They stayed laughing about nothing for what felt like hours but was probably more like minutes, until Draco yawned.
Harry cleared his throat. “I’ve been doing well. But, there’s not much to say, really. Your job seems much more interesting than mine.”
Harry’s grin widened as he heard whispers all around the room. It felt odd, but the whispers weren’t angry this time. They were… almost excited.
“Lucius would need to sign away his assets, and I don’t think he’d be happy about that. I would love to stay and catch up, but as I said, I have a meeting to get to.”
He wished he could talk to Draco about this, about how he felt and what he had realised. He hadn’t just lost the man he loved, he’d lost one of his best friends, too. He was in the middle of feeling rather sorry for himself when there was a knock at the door. He instantly knew it was Hermione - she always knocked softly, as though she knew Harry had a headache and didn’t want to make it worse.
“My patronus is a stag.” Harry said. He could have said it better - nicer, even - but, he was on a time limit and he needed to talk quickly. He watched Malfoy’s eyes widen. “Did you know that?”
“Really?” Hermione’s voice was full of surprise. “That’s good, I suppose. But you know you can talk to us, right?”
Harry winced against the burn of the whiskey as he passed on the bottle and melted further into the sofa, conveniently slouching into Draco, too. He sighed happily as he heard the chatter in the room, watched people drinking and laughing with each other.
Blaise wasn’t what Harry expected at all. He was quiet, and smiled kindly at Harry before going to join Pansy on the armchair, telling her to move over even though all of the other seats were free (a quidditch game was taking place, which Harry agreed to miss for Draco). He seemed pleasant enough, but there was a certain air about him, perhaps in the way he held himself, that suggested he would kill Harry without a second thought if he looked at him the wrong way. Harry found it oddly endearing. He could see why Draco got on so well with them.
The three of them laughed at that, and Harry counted it as a win. They were doing well after the war, all things considered. They laughed through the pain and grief and they stuck by each other through it all. But not in the Great Hall. Not ever. The Great Hall was tense and hostile at the best of times and they
Harry stumbled into the Gryffindor common room with a grin on his face, a bottle of firewhiskey in his hand, and about 10 pieces of clothing that weren’t his. He had tried to return the clothes before he left, he really had. But, according to Pansy, it was in the house rules that no clothing could be swapped back on game night. However, he had a feeling she wasn't being entirely honest about that.
It had been a week since Harry and Malfoy’s ruse had started, and since then they had been casting obvious glances when passing each other in the halls, waiting for the rumours to spread. There had already been at least two newspaper articles written about them, detailing their “budding friendship” and questioning if Malfoy was really a “worthy companion of the Chosen One”. However, for once, Harry was enjoying the attention. It meant that soon enough he would be able to travel the corridors in peace, and wouldn’t have to deal with any more adoring first years.
Draco was the first to spot Harry and Ron, his face lighting up as he said, “Finally!”, as he stood up quickly, not bothering to dust the snow off his clothes. He grinned as he greeted Harry with a tight hug that Harry returned almost instantly.
It was only when McGonagall looked Harry directly in the eyes and said, “And for the eighth years,” in a chilling tone, did Harry straighten his back and hold his breath slightly. She moved her gaze around the hall, but he knew she was speaking to him. “You will now be provided with new communal areas that must be shared with other houses. An eighth year common room, bathroom and shower room will be available for you starting next week, and it is mandatory for you to use it.”
Harry filled Malfoy in on the way to the library. He told him everything, which he felt oddly comfortable doing. He told him that he had been having the same dreams as Malfoy. He told him what had happened at the Great Lake, with Harry and Sirius and the dementors. And he told him when the dreams had started. When he had first seen Malfoy in his dreams, with the Dark Mark and the snake suffocating him.
friends, Potter?” Harry always smiled at the way she used his last name unless she wanted something. “A year ago you would have gladly hexed me out of this school.”
Pansy’s eyes narrowed. “Felt in the mood for pulling another Slytherin, then?” She said, her voice suspicious.
Luna nodded, then looked over Harry’s shoulder and grinned. “Draco! We were just talking about you.”
They sat in silence for a little while, neither of them moving. It was comfortable and there seemed to be a mutual understanding between them. Harry finally broke the silence when he looked at the clock.
The common room was quiet and peaceful in its emptiness but, soon enough, noise was filling the room as Draco took a swig from his Firewhiskey bottle and started passing it around.
Sam was basically perfect in every way, in Harry’s opinion. They talked to the customers as they made the drinks, they always cleaned up after themselves as soon as they made the mess, they picked everything up within a day of learning it and they never ever questioned Harry’s insistence on closing up every night and sending them home early.
“Why didn’t you take her to the ball?” Harry asked, glad to be distracted from the tattoo for a few moments.
Harry chuckled. “No, she isn’t, Draco. She’s just… obsessed with keeping you safe, I guess. She’s a lot nicer than I remember her to be.”
Hermione smiled slightly, before inhaling sharply and increasing the volume of her voice so suddenly that Draco’s hand found its way to Harry’s forearm, clutching it for dear life. Harry could focus on nothing but the feeling of it for a moment.
Draco chuckled and handed Harry the bottle. They each took a few more swigs before Draco declared that he was bored.
He had woken up late today, even though he had lessons. He had decided to skip school for the day, the war and nightmares hitting heavier than usual. Hermione and Ron had been in for him in the morning, first trying to drag him out of bed, then bringing him a cup of tea before leaving him with comforting touches to his arm.
It had all hit Harry later. He had already been in bed, listening to Ron’s snores and Hermione’s soft breaths, when he had thought of Fred. Of the Weasley jumper that he would never receive this year. Of the jokes he would never tell this year. Of the laughter Harry would never hear this year. And then, all at once, it had dawned on Harry. How many families that would be silent this year as they sat at the dinner table. How many empty seats they would leave for those who would never return. And Harry couldn’t stop the dread that was filling every ounce of his body and the way his breathing shook and his vision went blurry.
They were both breathing heavily, but Draco managed to speak in between kisses. “Did you miss me, Potter?”
He busied himself with cleaning up the shop and waiting for more customers, but his mind was far away. Even as he chatted to his customers, he couldn’t stop thinking about Malfoy. He was so open and… different. And his scars… Harry could not take his mind off those fucking scars.
Narcissa smiled again. “So I’ve seen. I’ll get out of your hair, boys.” She made her way to the door, but stopped suddenly. “Oh! Draco, I left your favourite book from when you were a child on the tray. I thought you might have wanted some comfort, but… well, you probably don’t want to go upstairs.”
Harry was struggling to breathe. It was exactly the same. All of it was the same. They were having the same dream, and it had taken them months to realise.
Pansy smirked at Draco’s response, but she grabbed his arm from the sofa anyway, which he pulled away from. “Oh, don’t be like that, darling. Come sit with us.”
“Furthermore,” Harry reckoned her glare could kill a man, so he stayed still as she looked between the two of them. “If your behaviour keeps up, I will have no choice but to expel you. The war is over, boys, it’s time you started acting like it.”
Ron and Hermione both answered at the same time, the Veritaserum pulling the truth out of them. Harry couldn’t work out who had said what, but one of them said “Yes”, while the other said “No”. Draco’s brows shot up.
They both shifted around slightly, before each saying goodnight and falling asleep. Harry found it was rather easy to fall asleep beside Draco. His mind emptied, his breaths matched to Draco’s, and the whole world fell away as he drifted off into a peaceful, deep sleep.
felt right when he was with Draco. “It felt like we were together out of obligation. You know, I wanted to become a part of the family, and she had been into me when she was little. But, now it’s… We’re better off as friends.”
I hope you enjoyed!! I'm sorry, I feel like this fic was quite rushed - the truth is, I've been rushing through as many of my WIPs as possible so I can start on a long fic I have planned! <3
Malfoy laughed at that and squeezed Luna’s arm before letting go and moving a piece of hair out of her face.
Harry didn’t answer. He couldn’t. He wasn't sure of the answer, himself. He only knew that he was hurting and Malfoy wasn't, which was unacceptable. Now, all he could do was prepare for the impact. He watched as Malfoy raised his hand, his knuckles white as he held his fist up, ready to hit Harry.
“Why? Honestly, Potter, does it look like anyone even wants to be near me? Look at this table, it’s the biggest one in the whole fucking library, and yet its always empty, because everyone knows this is where I, the death eater, sits. And, oh goodness, look at that, no one is even daring to sit at the three other tables surrounding this one. So, I can guarantee you whatever it is you want to ask me will be staying between the two of us, because no one is around to hear.”
Draco squeezed Harry’s hand slightly, but his face was still, as though he was in no pain at all as the tattoo gun buzzed. The tattoo artist had commented on how high his pain tolerance must be (“a lot of people leave in tears - the magical tattoos always hurt more”, they had said), which Harry and Draco pleasantly laughed along with. Neither of them dared to mention why his pain tolerance must be so high, but Harry decided to grip his hand tighter.
She shook her head enthusiastically. “You don’t even need to do it, really. As long as he doesn’t know it’s me that asked.”
Harry tried to reach for Draco’s hand, but he pulled away again. It was a small movement, barely noticeable, but it was there.
Pansy smiled smugly and Ginny started playing with her hair as though to prove Blaise’s point. Harry was happy for them. He truly was. He just couldn’t help himself from thinking that, if it weren’t for all of their history, he and Draco could be the same way.
“I think I need to be alone, Harry.” He said, and then opened the door, gesturing for Harry to leave.
“When Draco told us he was inviting some Gryffindors, he didn’t say it would be the whole bloody house.” Blaise said as came into the common room with Pansy, both of them smiling.
“You’re good. And you’re good to your friends. And to me. You…” He took a breath. “You don’t need to be ‘better’ for me. You're already good enough.”
“Surprising.” Draco muttered, and Harry breathed out a laugh. “Speaking of Weasleys -” He started, but Blaise cut him off before he could finish.
Harry sighed. He supposed he would have to tell her eventually, but he didn’t think it would be this early. And he really was feeling rough. He nodded. “Fine. Give me the potion.”
Harry looked around and realised that they were all in his room. His bed must have been rather crowded - what, with Draco, Ron and Harry all squished up like that. He was also surprised to see that Blaise and Ginny were still sleeping on the floor, and Ginny was most definitely spooning Blaise.
“Is a prick.” Ron finished for Harry. “But, you can work past that. You still have Grimmauld Place - I’m sure his mother could stay there for a while.”
By the time they had returned to the Gryffindor common room, pyjamas and hot chocolates in hand, Ron, Hermione and Blaise seemed to be in a heated discussion about the rules of muggle chess and how it differed from wizard’s chess. Their conversation ended rather abruptly when Draco chucked Blaise’s pyjamas at him, and he held up the pants in confusion.
Draco noticed his rage immediately and grabbed his hand, soothingly whispering meaningless words in Harry’s ear, but Harry stood up in anger anyway.
Narcissa was already eating by the time they made it to breakfast, and she welcomed them both with a warm smile.
Hermione’s face was sullen, and the entire room was silent as they took in the whole story. Harry knew it was fake - it must have been - but, it was just that, he had never seen Hermione lie like that before. Maybe… maybe she wasn’t lying.
Still, Pansy seemed to think there was an easy solution to the rumours. Harry was aware of her thoughts on the matter because one day, in the Great Hall, she had walked over to his table, smiled at him, and said, “Harry - no questions asked?”
“Hmm… see, that doesn’t seem fair. You’re definitely richer than me.” Draco was massaging Harry’s thigh as they spoke, which made it extremely difficult for Harry to think, but he wasn’t complaining.
Harry bit his lip in thought. He had no idea where to even start with this one. “Umm… okay. It’s… It’ll probably take a while, though.”
Harry fought the urge to tear up at their kindness. It seemed he was always crying nowadays. “Thank you, guys. You’ve both been amazing about everything.”
Harry felt Draco’s smirk as he kissed him again and again, his voice rough as he ground out, “Shut up and take your clothes off.”
Malfoy scoffed. “You performed the patronus charm in your sleep without even realising it, Potter. You being a Legilimens is possible.”
surprised, however, to see that it wasn’t his mugshot. Every article that had been written about Sirius had shown him screaming in Azkaban - even the ones detailing his death - but
Harry sighed. “It’ll only take a minute.” He said, watching as Malfoy’s friends stood up. “One minute!” He exclaimed as he watched them draw their wands. “I need him for one minute. After that, you can come and hex the living shit out of me. Okay?”
“He came in early, before closing time. He wanted to make sure I wasn’t overwhelmed. He’s quite nice, if you’re into that gorgeous-daddy-issues type thing.”
He froze in shock, taking a moment to ensure he kept his mouth from hanging open, but was certain that his eyebrows were in his hairline by now. Because, standing right in front of him, in his very own coffee shop, was none other than Draco Malfoy.
They had barely spoken since they sat down in the carriage. Draco had said they still needed to be seen together, but Harry found it to be even harder than he had expected. For hours, he had been sitting on this train, thinking about how much he would miss Draco’s smell. He smelt like flowers, like apples, like luxury, like
Harry nodded. He found that phrase to be one of the most stressful things that could be said, but Luna’s voice lulled him into a sense of calm. “What’s up?”
Harry sighed. The bastard was being difficult, as always. “What does it mean?” Harry snapped, not aware of the fact he was snapping at all. Maybe he’d had more to drink than he’d thought he had.
He hadn’t read to anyone before, but he found it rather relaxing, and he could feel Draco sinking further into the mattress as he spoke. Every so often, he would pause, thinking Draco was asleep, but would look down to see his wide eyes staring up at him, at which point, he would smile and continue reading.
“It’s no problem,” They said with a smile, “I’ve heard the stories about you guys, and I’m so glad I could help cover that mark up a bit.”
For the most part, the game went rather well. A few secrets were revealed, of course, but it was mostly just an excuse to drink and laugh again. Since the war, it seemed as though this was much needed. The Gryffindors seemed to be having a good time, as well, Harry noticed. They all seemed to be laughing and joking with the Slytherins like old friends, rather than old enemies. Ginny was having an especially good time, what with her and Pansy sitting so close together and Pansy’s fingers in her hair. Harry found himself having a good time with Draco, and it seemed as though both of them were absolutely fine with not mentioning what Draco had revealed.
Blaise whistled, Seamus let out a “Whoop” and other people cheered, but all Harry could focus on was Draco’s breath on his neck as he leaned in closer and spoke to him, his voice low and only meant for Harry. “I can already see the headlines - Saviour of the Wizarding World strips for Slytherins.”
Ron plopped himself down next to Harry with a happy sigh and pulled Hermione down onto his lap. It was quite the squeeze on the sofa, but Harry didn’t mind. He was concerned that his friends would be awkward around Pansy and Blaise, but he remembered how well they got on with Draco and decided they could handle the situation themselves.
At the end, after he’d finished explaining everything, he sat, slightly breathless, waiting for someone to say something. He looked between Ron and Hermione, who were wearing matching expressions of shock and confusion.
He heard Seamus’ laughter and registered his voice in his mind. “Well, that’s something you don’t hear everyday.” He said, but Harry felt as though the breath had been knocked out of him.
He had tears in his eyes, but he hadn’t shed a single one. Harry wanted to tell him that it was okay to cry, but he knew that it wouldn’t make a difference. So, instead, he nodded. “When I… When I died, it was like everything fell into place, in a way.” Harry cleared his throat, and he looked down to where Draco had stopped the movements on his knee. Now his hand was simply resting there, the warmth a comfort to Harry. “It’s hard to describe.” Draco turned his head back to a more comfortable position, but he gave Harry’s knee a squeeze, as though to reassure him that he was still listening. “It was oddly… beautiful. I knew I was dead. And I knew that I was going to have to fight. But, it was like an overwhelming sense of love for everybody who was fighting for me. And it was sort of like clarity for me, too. It was a moment to just… well, breathe, ironically.” He felt Draco breathe a laugh against his skin and he smiled at the feeling. “It was like I made a promise to myself then. I wanted to be better to them, to all the people I loved. And to everyone else, too, really.” Draco nodded. “It hurt like hell when I came out of it, of course.” He said and he felt Draco breathe another laugh against his skin, and he grinned.
Harry grinned. They continued chatting for the rest of the time, and Harry realised how much they had both changed. There was a time where he and Draco couldn’t go two minutes without fighting, and yet, here they were, talking like old friends. It was comforting to know that they could be civil.
Pansy made her way over to where Harry and Draco were sitting, while Blaise sat next to Ron and Hermione. Pansy smirked as she saw the sign above the fireplace. “Well, Potter, you’re going to have to find a new place to pick up Slytherins.”
Harry wondered if the others were noticing this - how affectionate he and Draco had become. He wondered if any of them cared.
“Harry, why don’t you come to bed?” He said, his voice soft. “We can talk about it. Or, we can just… breathe for a minute. Whatever you need.”
And there they sat, the Weasleys and the Slytherins, laughing together for the first time in forever, listening to the way George’s breaths stuttered as his laugh came to an end, but his smile remained.
He saw multiple bottles of firewhiskey around the room, and he asked Pansy, “Do the first years in Slytherin drink?!”
“Look at me, Harry.” He said, his voice so harsh that Harry had no choice but to do as he was told. “Quitting?” His eyes narrowed. “I’m quitting?” He lowered his voice. “What the
Harry had been so focused on what the article was going to say, that he hadn’t even thought about what would come afterwards. “I don’t know.” He said stupidly. “But we’ll get through it. Hell, we survived bloody Voldemort, I’m sure we can survive Rita Skeeter.”
Harry welcomed them with a similar smile. He was still in a good mood from his day off, and he found himself to be smiling more than usual.
Harry turned on his side, too. He didn’t know when he and Malfoy had become so able to tell the truth to each other, but he felt oddly comfortable with him. Perhaps it was because they both knew that they would never tell anyone else. After all, they were both in on a pretty big secret together.
“These are delicious.” Draco said as he ate, but never talking with his mouth full. Sometimes Harry forgot that Draco grew up rich.
Harry glared at Malfoy as they left the office. Malfoy looked just as exhausted as Harry felt. None of this was fair.
Draco smiled against Harry’s skin and he snuggled in closer. “Goodnight.” He whispered, and Harry realised with a soft grin that he hadn’t meant goodbye.
“You know, Ronald’s giving us a lot of shit for someone who has a tattoo on their arse.” Draco whispered, and Harry snorted.
She nodded, but she was clearly still worried. “That’s good, darling. I brought you boys some snacks.” She turned towards Harry. “And how have you been, Mr Potter?”
Noise seemed to erupt in the room at the suggestion and soon, the wine was flowing, the laughter was loud, and there were challenges on everybody’s faces.
“Okay. Good.” Hermione said before beginning to complain about the latest drama at the Ministry, which Harry was immensely grateful for.
“As much as I hate to admit it,” Ron said with a mouthful of toast, “I’ve missed them. It’ll be nice to see them.”
“I don’t know.” There was a pause. “It’s not like I wanted to visit him on Christmas and pretend I agree with what he’s done, I just… I can’t believe they would let her visit.”
Theodore’s expression was bored, as it usually was, but he lifted one eyebrow as he heard his name. “Dare.”
like a lie. And, now that it seemed as though it could be over, he had no idea how to talk to anyone about it.
Harry nodded. “Yeah, it can be anything.” Harry tried not to think about the fact that he had left himself open to requests such as these. Vouching for someone who was closely associated with Voldemort was risky, but Harry knew he had signed himself up to this. “Just let me know who I need to speak to and what you want me to say.”
By the time he woke up in the morning, Draco had rolled over onto his back and Harry had his arm resting on Draco’s chest, feeling his heartbeat through his shirt. When Harry opened his eyes, Draco was already awake and staring up at the canopy above them, his face soft and his hair mussed with having just woken up. He must have felt Harry shift as he woke up, because he looked over at Harry, his eyes bright.
“So, no one will be back for another couple of weeks.” Draco said, a smirk on his face. “Slytherin game night tonight?”
“Malfoy,” Harry said, his tone firm, “Seriously, I’ve not been sleeping because of this shit. What aren’t you telling us?”
There was a significant change in atmosphere when the younger ones had left. It was darker, and Pansy started smiling in a highly unsettling way. Harry watched as she looked around slowly. The whole room took a collective breath and held it as they waited. Eventually, her gaze stopped on the two people beside her - Harry and Draco. Harry fought the urge to groan.
The Weasleys seemed worried for Harry, asking questions about him and Draco, making sure he was okay. Harry didn’t know what to tell them. He had been lying to them the whole time and yet, their relationship hadn’t
Draco rolled his eyes. “Yes, but breakfast is where the food is, and where your stomach will stop making such rude interruptions.”
Draco laughed. “No one can see my socks if my shoes are on, you idiot, so it doesn’t matter what colour they are.”
Luna looked at Harry, really looked at him. “Sometimes.” Her voice was quiet. “But, I love you both enough to see past it.”
Harry had been right. When he walked into the Great Hall for breakfast the next day, the room went silent. The rumours about him and Draco had clearly already spread.
Draco shook his head. “Not at all.” At least Harry knew that wasn’t a lie. “He’s been sneaking out a lot recently, actually. Off to meet someone, no doubt. He thinks I haven’t noticed.”
Harry’s robes weren’t right. They were itchy, and didn’t fit well and his shoes didn’t match. He told himself it was fine. Why did he even care, anyway? He was planning on making an appearance, smiling at McGonagall, and then leaving as soon as possible.
Harry wondered if she had told it like this as a child, but he realised that she probably had. She was much more intelligent than he was when they were young - no wonder she was good at storytelling.
Harry breathed out a laugh. He looked over at Ron and Hermione, who were taking a seat next to Blaise. They were chatting, as though they had always been friends, and he even saw Ron smile. It was strange for Harry to see but he loved it all the same.
As the room grew darker, so did their conversation. Harry wasn’t sure how they had gotten onto the topic, but they began talking about the war. Harry listened to what it was like on the other side of it, and he felt himself lean in closer to his friends, as though trying to tell them, “it’s okay, I’ve forgiven you, I would have done the same”, without actually saying it.
He heard Draco open his mouth, ready to protest again, but Harry wouldn’t let him. Instead, he kissed the scars gently, making sure to touch every single one. He hated himself for doing such awful things, but so did Draco. As unlikely a pairing as they were, they needed each other.
“None of them are here.” Harry said, his voice breaking. “So many people are just… Gone.” He shook his head. “And I couldn’t… I couldn’t stop it.”
“At the last moment, just as I was shutting out the snow and the cold and the light, I saw a shadow. It was him, I knew it. I only saw him for a second, but he was right outside my window this time, staring in at me, and… smiling.”
. His body was always relaxed now, no longer sitting stiffly upright. His hair was ruffled, his hair gel not making an appearance once during eighth year. Even his face was softer now, the creases beside his eyes becoming more prominent every time he smiled. And he smiled
He regretted it instantly. It was stupid, and now he’d messed up their friendship. Except, Malfoy’s face wasn’t full of regret, like Harry’s probably was. His face was full of… happiness and amusement, maybe?
Harry felt as though he couldn’t think a single important thought in that moment, other than More, Draco, more. He came thinking it, and came saying it over and over again until he couldn’t say it anymore.
On the plus side, Harry and Draco were getting on rather well. The game seemed to be distracting from any awkwardness they had, and Harry found Draco’s extreme competitiveness to be oddly endearing.
“So, how do you explain…” Hermione struggled to find the words. “All of the… confusion about muggle practices?”
Draco grabbed Harry’s hand and squeezed it tightly. “I’m so sorry, Harry. I’m sorry you had to go through that.”
“Would you please put this agreement into writing and owl it to me by the end of the day? It’ll help put my mind at ease.” Harry smiled.
“It means… I want him to know he’s loved.” She had responded with an odd look in her eye, before shooing Harry out of the kitchen.
“For everything. You know, my temper isn’t the greatest, but you… You handled it really well, so thank you.”
“Try to have a good time tonight, Harry.” She said, her eyes full of concern. “I know how hard it is… but, you deserve a good time.”
“I study potions.” Malfoy said, watching Harry’s hands as he made the drink. “I used to make a living out of selling them in France, but the Ministry of Magical Affairs offered me a job to help them in law enforcement. I basically study the criminal use of potions, which is a surprisingly necessary field.” He shook his head. “Although, whenever I say it out loud, it sounds… shit.”
Malfoy nodded. “It makes sense, Potter. I… I had a lot of nightmares. And I couldn’t sleep. But… Look, the only time I can ever relax is when I’m asleep. Unless, of course, I have nightmares. And, I
a few rumours spreading about the two of them, especially since Harry hadn’t been seen kissing any other Slytherins for a while.
Malfoy pushed him onto the bed, breaking their kiss to undress Harry. For every piece of clothing he removed, he trailed kisses along Harry’s skin, and Harry was sure he had died because this was
Harry laughed. They sat in silence for a few minutes, each of them taking a sip of Draco’s drink every once in a while, before Harry yawned and realised how tired he was.
Draco nodded. “They apparently don’t know any. I wonder why that is.” He rolled his eyes. “They’re clueless.”
“Um…” Shacklebolt didn’t know what to say to that, apparently, because his eyes were wide for a long few moments. “Well… Of course, Mr Potter.” He cleared his throat and collected himself. “Well, this… unique situation will require a unique solution. Usually, a prisoner would have to be declared unfit for their trustee to sign their assets off, but I’m assuming you’ll need this done as soon as possible.”
“Yeah, well, you shouldn’t have forgiven me for any of it, but you did.” Draco said, a slightly pained look on his face.
Harry shook his head, but did as he was told, carefully keeping the pen light to ensure Ron slept through it. He was rather proud of the finished product, in all honesty, and Pansy and Hermione seemed to be satisfied, too, if their grins were anything to go on. Pansy cast a charm on his face, which Harry frowned at.
Harry’s smile stayed on his face. Draco shifted his head slightly, brushing against Harry’s hand. It was an accident, but Harry saw how Draco sighed into the touch.
He tried not to give in to gossip. After all, rumours had made his life miserable. But, he couldn’t help but notice that Luna and Pansy
Harry was about to say something, anything, to fill the silence, but Draco beat him to it. He breathed out a laugh and shook his head. “You truly are the weirdest person I’ve ever met.”
As I'm writing this, I'm realising that there's hardly any angst in here! I honestly don't care, because I'm loving this fluff too much!!
“I banged on the walls with my hands, desperate to get my parents’ attention, desperate to get the man away from me!”
“Fuck off.” Harry spat out. “War isn’t something you just ‘get over’. At least, it isn’t for the ones on the right side of it. You seem to be getting on just fine.”
“No more questions about the war.” Blaise said, his voice travelling throughout the room. “That’s no fun.”
be compulsory for those attending to be accompanied by a student from another house, or else they must attend alone.”
“Merlin, Harry, slow down before you choke.” Draco drawled, an amused little smile on his face. “You can’t have gone through all of that trouble to survive, only to end it all over a piece of toast.”
The door creaked as it opened. Hermione took one look at Harry’s face and jumped into bed with him, toeing her shoes off as she went, with an “Oh, Harry”, as she wrapped her arms around him. Ron was slightly more reserved, but after shutting the door and watching the two for a moment, he chucked off his shoes and wiggled in next to them, rubbing circles onto Harry’s back.
“Thank you.” Draco whispered to Harry, whilst the rest of the room was laughing at the conversation. Harry smiled at him, decidedly not thinking of what he had just found out. He held quite a lot of power at this moment. One question - one simple sentence - and Draco could be…
, so he kept his mouth shut and followed the rest of his friends out of the hall, feeling as though there was something he was missing.
He didn’t even think to check the map. It was 3 in the morning. No one would be awake. It was fine. Except, it
“Potter, you’re an idiot.” Malfoy said, his gaze cruel. Harry agreed. “Why the fuck would you do that for me?”
“I thought you didn’t wear pyjamas, Draco.” Harry said, and instantly regretted speaking when he realised how it sounded.
Harry frowned. “Umm… Yes. I am.” He took a deep breath. He supposed now was as good a time as any to bring it up. “Speaking of which, I saw your tattoo.” He tried to keep his voice steady.
They spoke for a little while longer. Malfoy finished his drink, thanking Harry as he did so, and then left to go to work, leaving a galleon on the table and saying “see you tomorrow!” as he shut the door behind him.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Fucking obviously. Although, I’m afraid I may have to be eating breakfast for dinner. You know, we’re on different schedules.”
Harry looked over at Draco with a smile. The blonde was looking at Hermione with a look in his eyes that Harry couldn’t quite name.
“Come on, Potter. Take one day off. I’ll drop by in the evening to check your new employee hasn’t burned the place down yet.” He smirked.
, he said to himself. But then… Then, he saw Draco’s face. He saw the crease between his eyebrows and the way the corners of his mouth and his eyes seem to droop, everything weighed down by… Sadness. “Wh… What’s wrong?” Harry asked, his voice deep with worry.
Ron rolled his eyes and grumbled something about “all these bloody Slytherins”, but he didn’t say anything more.
Draco smiled. “It’s not your fault.” He led them to an alcove that Harry had never seen before, and sat down, pulling Harry in close to him. “Let’s just sit here for a while. This is all… a lot.”
Harry’s eyes widened slightly. “Wait, so I sifted through your dreams, found out you were having nightmares, and I sent you my patronus to get rid of them, all while I was
Slughorn frowned as he saw that there were multiple Gryffindors in the Slytherin common room. “What on earth is going on here?” He asked, his voice rough with sleep and anger.
Afterwards, they lay in bed in silence, simply enjoying each other’s sturdy touch, and mindlessly brushing their hands over each other’s bodies softly. They stayed like that for hours, neither speaking a word, but both still being certain that they knew. They just
She cut him off, grabbing his face and kissing him, allowing everyone to see. She stayed there for a few moments before dropping her hands and pulling away. Harry heard a couple of whistles - most likely from Pansy and Blaise - and he was sure he heard Slughorn spluttering (although Harry wasn’t worried about what he would say - he seemed to be rather fond of Harry), but he was more focused on
She let out a satisfied “hmmf” and went to drape herself on one of the armchairs, picking up a magazine that had been left on the table next to it.
Harry’s smile widened. “Perfect.” He grabbed Draco’s arm and led him towards the Potions cupboard. “What do you know about surveillance charms?”
After a while, they all fell asleep in front of the fire, a tangle of arms and legs and cushions. That was the best Harry had slept in years.
“Well, I was probably asleep then, too.” Malfoy said, and he seemed to make up his mind on what he wanted to say. “I drew it because I had been seeing it all the time. It was… a recurring nightmare I had.”
Harry found that he and Draco were having a much better time than his two friends. They were in the middle of the dancefloor, amidst most of their classmates, drinking and grinding as much as possible. They were in their own world, really.
“My parents are going crazy about it, too.” Draco said, his face screwed up in disgust. “They keep asking me to find them muggles for their parties. I told them to fuck off.”
“Let’s think about this logically.” Hermione said, as though she didn’t always think logically. “Have you been needing any help recently, Malfoy?” She asked, before quickly adding, “And it must be something big. A lot of magic goes into that spell, especially when the caster is unconscious.”
They hugged each other and Harry squeezed Hermione so tight he was worried the baby might suffocate. When they pulled away, they laughed and Hermione shuffled Harry inside and onto the sofa.
When Draco eventually pulled away, he spoke softly to Harry. “I’m completely in love with you, too.”
“Yes, I’m beginning to think you are.” Harry tried not to, but he looked into Draco’s eyes. He wasn’t surprised to realise that he saw nothing in them. Draco was truly excellent at putting up those walls.
Except, Harry didn’t get over it. He couldn’t get over it. Because, exactly three days before the winter holidays began, Draco found his way into Harry’s room. More specifically, Harry’s bed. Harry wasn’t asleep - he had been lying in bed for a few hours, as he always did, before giving up and reading up on the latest Quidditch news - when Draco had crawled into his bed and cast a silencing charm.
Hermione looked sceptical but smiled at Harry nonetheless. Now that Harry was drawn back to reality, he started to listen to the table’s discussion of their holidays. He laughed along, and even added the odd comment here and there, but in his head he could only think of his anger. And, well, Harry was aware of his temper. He knew that it was unreasonable and hurt people, but he couldn’t help himself.
everybody as he ran, and then circled back, running quickly until he reached the common room again to the sound of his name being chanted.
Slughorn's footsteps were loud in the silence as he walked in, mumbling something about too much noise while he’s trying to sleep, just as Draco slid in front of Harry, covering him up. He looked back at him, motioned to the drinks, and then looked back at Slughorn, making sure he was in front of Harry, so that Slughorn wouldn’t see him naked. Harry looked over at the sofas, seeing bottles everywhere, and waved his hand, wandlessly moving them underneath the sofa and hoping Slughorn didn’t see.
Harry listened to the ringing of the disconnect tone before it eventually cut to silence. He was going to lose Draco.
Harry nodded. "That makes sense." He picked up the book that was on the tray. It was a wizarding one that he had never seen before. “You used to read
Harry took a deep breath. “Um…” He didn’t know why, but he felt as though he could tell Draco. He knew he shouldn’t. “I’ll… I can tell you, if you promise not to tell anyone.”
Harry and Draco laughed at that and left the room to see Pansy and Blaise’s expectant looks. Blaise held out their drinks to them with an arched brow and they both grabbed them and took a sip.
“Oh, look at that.” Draco’s voice startled Harry out of his thoughts. He gestured towards the half-empty bottle of firewhiskey with the joint squashed on top of it. “I guess we must have rolled on it.” Draco laughed loudly, and Harry had no choice but to join in.
“Yeah, Malfoy’s a pureblood. Purebloods need heirs. And, well, you can’t really give that to him. So, just be careful.” Ron gave Harry a smile and squeezed his shoulder.
Draco grinned, and Harry could see he was trying not to laugh. “That’s my friend you’re talking about.”
Draco nodded, his smile filling half of his face. “I really like the ring that you got me, you know the one that hisses when I’m angry?”
Draco’s eyes were full of tears and caution. “How can you do this? How can you sit here and defend me.”
“One of my friends actually owns this place. She had a restaurant like this in France, but there were quite a few places like this over there, so there was less competition in Britain.”
Their plates landed in front of each of them, a small stack of waffles that smelled delicious on each of them, and Ron levitated the toppings through from the kitchen.
He saw Hermione walk towards him and he tried a smile, but it was too much effort for him. He was glad to see her, but he was feeling anything but happy right now.
Harry and Ron got ready slowly as they woke up. There was a general excitement in the air as they talked about meeting up with Hermione and the Slytherins.
Perhaps Draco was angry with him. He had every right to be - Harry had gotten him into this whole mess in the first place. Or perhaps, he was just upset. Whatever it was, they were due to go back to Hogwarts in a few days, and Harry didn’t know whether he and Draco would be going back as a ‘couple’ or not. He decided to wait for Draco to call when he was ready, but it didn’t make it any easier to handle right now.
Harry sighed. “The rivalry was… exhausting. Everyone was fighting. All the time. And I…” He took a deep breath. “I just wanted one normal, peaceful year.” He shrugged. “So, I took a chance.” He smiled. “I’m used to rumours going around about who I’m dating, so… I thought I was the best man for the job.”
“As I was saying…” McGonagall said, with a pointed look over at Harry and his friends. “The workload for the seventh and eighth years…”
Harry willed his cheeks to stop turning red, but he failed and rolled his eyes. “We’re friends, I suppose.”
Harry didn’t know what to say. He didn’t want to lose Draco, but he didn’t really have a choice anymore. So, instead, he just nodded. “Okay.” He turned around to leave, but changed his mind and turned back again. “I’m sorry.” He said gently.
He kicked the wand even further away from Ben and his friends before making his way to the Slytherin dorms to tell Daphne it was done. She smiled gratefully and said, “Pleasure doing business with you, Potter.”
Draco opened his mouth to speak, but Harry’s stomach grumbled loudly and cut off whatever Draco was about to say. Harry gave Draco an apologetic smile, and Draco sat up, smirking. “Time to go to breakfast, Harry.”
“Are you going to the Weasleys’ for Christmas?” Draco murmured, his head resting on Harry’s lap. Harry hadn’t meant for this to happen. He had simply sat down, leaving plenty of room for Pansy or Blaise or Ron or Hermione or Luna or Ginny or
Draco smirked. “No, Harry, I’m giving you shit for doing it in an alleyway. I did it in a restaurant, which is much more sophisticated.”
“Dreadful.” Draco said, his movements large and dramatic. “Every moment we’ve been apart, I have cried. I have simply been waiting for this moment.”
Draco nodded. “It does.” They sat for a few moments before Draco dragged Harry up to the Gryffindor common room. “I’ll need to give your friends time to get ready”, he had said, and Harry rolled his eyes.
Harry snorted in laughter and looked at Draco, who was shooting daggers at Pansy, his mouth twitching to tell the truth.
Harry felt Draco let out a sigh of relief, and a smile grew on Harry’s face. There was a short silence where no one even dared to speak, but after a few moments, Draco breathed out a laugh.
It didn’t take much longer for the others to wake up, each of them taking one look at Ron’s face and bursting into laughter. Draco protested when he first woke up - wondering why his legs were trapped under a
Draco nodded. “She brought me snacks.” Draco laughed, and Harry joined in, too. “She only visited once, but… it was her idea. To tell my friends, I mean. She said they should visit Hogwarts for a while.”
Harry and Malfoy made sure to be seen in the library together, making a big show of arriving together, or meeting each other there. Everywhere they went, there were whispers. However, Harry still found himself being followed by a gaggle of girls in the corridors, so he knew they would have to move their relationship on fairly quickly.
Eventually, Blaise patted Ron’s shoulder, a barely concealed smile on his face. “I think it’s time to give up. Let’s go get some breakfast, yeah?”
“He’s always here.” Pansy said from beside him, rolling her eyes, yet still keeping her head rested on his shoulder. “He’s our new pet.”
Sorry for making you wait a bit longer for this chapter! I want to thank you for all of your amazing comments - I've been writing this to get through some pretty hard times and your comments mean the world to me! Thank you!
“Oh, yeah. One of the more interesting ones I’ve been assigned to. I’d rather be working it in the day, of course.”
“Yes, but I don’t think ‘excited’ is the right word. I told you, she’s only nice to people she likes. And Blaise… I love him, but he’s very… protective.”
Harry nodded. He took a deep breath. “Do you know why he got it? Like, what does it mean?” He tried to keep his voice calm, but Luna’s face showed a splash of concern and he knew he had failed.
“Yeah, it really is.” There was a long pause where neither of them spoke, they simply lay in each other’s company. Draco spoke after a while, as though he was considering if he should say something or not. “I… I don’t really have anyone here apart from you, you know?”
“I was terrified that I would see the man again. But, I gathered up all of my courage, and went to shut my window and my curtains anyway. I looked outside, just for a second at first, and I saw that he wasn’t there. I breathed a sigh of relief, finally closing my curtains. But,”
After they became bored of thinking of questions, and they were both positively tipsy, they decided it was time to stop with the game.
Draco stood up out of bed and made his way over to Harry, wrapping his arms around him tightly and rubbing his back. Harry felt the warmth of Draco's Weasley jumper against him.
, but she quickly swapped her glare for a sweet smile. “Draco?” She said, her voice so sweet it made Harry’s teeth ache, and he realised his mistake. “A ‘no questions asked’? But… Wouldn’t that mean…” She widened her eyes in faux shock. “You don’t mean… Oh,
But, she answered all the same, her voice chirpy as she said, “Ginny”, causing Ginny to smile and sink closer to Pansy on the sofa. Harry smiled at the image, until he realised that it was Pansy’s turn to choose someone. He felt a growing sense of dread in his stomach and he somehow just
Harry narrowed his eyes. “The last time I checked, it was the Slytherins who were on the wrong side of the war, so, yeah, I
Luna giggled. It was strange, watching Harry’s childhood nemesis make Luna so happy. “He used to bring me biscuits and read me stories.” She said to Harry.
They stayed like that for a moment, staring at each other, until Draco broke the silence. “Merlin, you’re hot.”
Draco laughed. “Oh, that should never have happened, really. It was… We both needed a beard. But neither of us had talked about it beforehand. It just… happened. We only ever made sense as friends.”
for the rest of the morning. And Harry couldn’t quite handle that. So, when they arrived in the Great Hall, Harry had planned on going to sit at the Gryffindor table, far far away from Draco. But, when he had entered, he had caught Theodore’s eye and he had motioned for him to come over. And Harry had smiled and acted as though this were okay, but he mentally cursed himself for ever kissing a Slytherin in the first place.
Malfoy seemed to remember he was in a cafe, because he shook his head and looked up at the list of drinks that was floating behind Harry on a board. “Oh, of course.” He ‘hmm’ed for a few seconds, before seemingly making his mind up. “Surprise me.”
Pansy rolled her eyes, but the Veritaserum made her clarify, anyway. “Go streaking through the Slytherin corridors.” Her smile widened. “I was
Harry laughed, starting to unbutton his shirt. “Well, I apologise, I’m absolutely hopeless when it comes to fashion.”
Harry smirked. “Oh, you mean like the sort of last minute trip that one takes to help their heartbroken friend get over a break-up?”
Draco nodded. “It’ll be a tough one.” His mouth turned up into a small smile. “At least you’ll be with your family.”
Draco suggested they make a detour to the dungeons for a few moments, which Harry didn’t really question. He stood in the corridor with Pansy, discussing Slughorn’s latest show of favouritism in class, which everyone was painfully aware of. Draco came out quickly, smiling as he did.
He had expected a cheaper version of the Yule Ball and most of the seniors to have passed on the event, but he instantly realised how wrong he had been. The majority of the senior years were attending, and McGonagall had clearly gone all out in the way of decorations.
He kissed Harry hard while his hands reached towards Harry’s trousers, unzipping them and sliding them off. He moved his kisses towards Harry’s neck and he rolled Harry over so he was on top of him. It all felt so good, Harry felt like he could barely breathe. He felt as though he should have said more, done more to show Draco that he had forgiven him, but that thought was soon lost when Draco grabbed Harry’s wrists and pinned them above his head, all the while grinding and kissing Harry’s neck.
“What, you mean we won’t be shagging all day?” Harry looked at Draco with faux disappointment and Draco smirked back. “Well, I mean, it may be a little bit early in the day for this, but I have a bottle of Firewhiskey?”
Harry felt great for the rest of the day. His hangover was gone, he had finally stopped lying to Hermione - and she would, no doubt, tell Ron as well - and, whenever he passed any of the Slytherins in the corridors, they smiled at him.
He cast a simple Stinging Jinx on Ben’s friends, catching them off guard and getting them out of the way so he could focus on Ben. He started with one that left boils on Ben’s skin, which he had learnt a few years ago and found rather successful. Then, as the boy reached for his wand, he cast the Jelly-Fingers curse, causing him to drop his wand and watch as it rolled away helplessly. Lastly, he used the Bat-Bogey hex that Ginny had taught him. It worked excellently and he had to hold back his laughter to avoid dropping the cloak.
He figured they must have slept for a while - after all, they did fall asleep in the middle of the day yesterday - and he felt fantastic. He hadn’t had a full night’s sleep in months, aside from the occasional night out that would end in afters at his flat that someone would bring weed to. But, even that peaceful sleep was tinged by the nausea that followed from his hangover the next day. Harry tried not to think it, but he enjoyed waking up next to Draco, seeing his face so soft and happy. Harry also tried not to think about the fact that he was absolutely fucked. They were never supposed to actually sleep together. But, here he was, realising that, once again, his life was not going to plan. Nothing ever did.
But, Harry saw something change in his eyes. He saw it as his fist lowered slightly and his posture softened. Unfortunately for the both of them, McGonagall didn’t seem to see it. All she saw was Harry and Malfoy’s fists and a red cheek.
“Ah, lovely, I can’t wait to see them again. Are they keeping well? Are all of their memories intact?”
“Wow.” Harry was surprised. Maybe Draco hadn’t really changed too much, after all. Maybe he was just more comfortable showing who he was now. “And your father was okay with that?”
Draco laughed. Harry wanted to live in the feeling of it. He was silent for a few moments before he spoke again, his voice steady but quiet. “I hope you know I’ve forgiven you.”
“I’m… I’m sorry. I thought they had healed.” His eyes were still on Malfoy’s scars and he saw them move as Malfoy’s mouth turned up in a small, strange smile.
He was walking to the library and the corridors were empty. It was late and curfew was approaching, but Harry had left his bag at one of the tables by accident, and he had to go back for it before it got locked away for the night. He had had a bad day already. He had woken up early from a particularly disturbing dream that he couldn’t remember, and he couldn’t get back to sleep. Then, he had struggled to get out of bed, the war and grief weighing heavily on his shoulders as he forced himself to push through. And, when he went to the bathroom during lunch, he had a rather draining panic attack that had been brought on by a headache that felt too similar to when Voldemort was around. It had been a
“This isn’t safe, Harry. We’re clearly both at risk here.” He pointed to his face, which was bruised and had some nasty cuts on it. At least he had washed off the blood, so he didn’t look so bad anmore. Harry knew that he probably looked much worse right now.
He shook his head before speaking in a strained voice. “Theo, Blaise…” He winced. “Ron Weasley…” Harry heard Ron squeak slightly, and Harry’s eyebrows shot up. “And… And…” He seemed to be straining to stop speaking, trying to keep the next name in, but the potion was stronger than he was, and he blurted out, “And Harry.” He slouched with a sigh and looked at Pansy. “You’re a cunt, you know that?”
Malfoy was grinning. “I swear, sometimes you don’t even remember that magic exists.” Harry frowned. “This is a magical restaurant, Potter.” Harry was still lost. “Everyone who comes in here is unrecognisable to the staff and the other customers. It’s brilliant magic, really.”
“How long will they be staying?” Harry asked, a smile on his face as Draco ran his fingers through his hair.
“You’re a bastard.” He yelled, but Malfoy didn’t even pause. He kept walking, not reacting in the slightest.
Harry felt Draco move slightly closer to him, as though trying to shield himself from the imaginary cold that Hermione was describing. Harry couldn’t tell if he was doing the same thing himself.
Harry looked down to see it was Malfoy’s notebook, lying open on the floor. Harry frowned as he saw what was inside. It was a drawing, and a rather good one, in all honesty. Harry only saw it for a moment before Malfoy picked it up quickly and walked away, muttering “fucking idiot”, as he went.
The three of them made small talk until the food came out, chatting about the latest wizarding news and complaining about the Ministry.
Harry laughed loudly, glancing over at the prominent marks on Draco’s pale neck. “I think we’re in the clear for that one. I mean, I did say one of us shouldn’t be able to walk.”
helping him to get over his little crush. After they had brushed their teeth, they had went to the showers together, and Harry had had to calm himself down slightly at the thought of Draco showering so nearby. Then, they had laughed as they walked down to the Great Hall together, Draco’s hand brushing Harry’s as they went.
He was about to respond to her, to tell her that, if she’s in the mood, she could always come to him, but he was cut off before he could even begin.
He and Draco were more in love than ever, and Harry was intoxicated by it. Now that their schedules were aligned, they saw each other non-stop. Draco cooked for Harry, and Harry made him his coffee twice a day, each time trying out new recipes for him and kissing him every time he said, “Harry, this is delicious”. It was good practice for the coffee shop he was in the midst of opening.
He decided to talk to Luna. She and Malfoy seemed to be annoyingly good friends now, and Harry wanted to know if she knew anything about why he got the tattoo. He talked to her after dinner, finding her in the Ravenclaw common room the evening after he and Malfoy’s shower incident. The passwords were becoming increasingly redundant again, and Harry couldn’t help but think that it
She opened her mouth, likely to ask another question that she wasn’t supposed to be asking, but he cut her off yet again, this time grabbing her face gently and pulling it towards his own. He kissed her gently, and only for a few seconds. He would hardly count it as a kiss, really, but it did the trick. He felt a collective breath taken by everyone in the room, and he pulled away, smiling.
, he told himself. He wondered if Malfoy got this a lot. Did it upset him? His question was answered for him as he watched Malfoy smirk and wink at the students as they looked back at him. He was clearly very used to it, which was almost worse.
Draco’s response was much less formal than Harry’s letter. His handwriting, of course, was anything but informal, all loopy and smooth and neat. But, as Harry’s sleepy eyes darted across the parchment when he woke up, he could practically hear Draco’s voice, hear his laugh, as he read.
“It’s revealed by using magic.” Malfoy said, answering Harry’s question before he could even ask it. “Any spell works.”
As though to prove his point, the door to the common room opened and Harry’s friends entered, chattering excitedly. Ron was standing at the front of the group with a wide smile and his hands behind his back.
Draco nodded and skimmed over the parchment. “Okay, so, the main issue here is that all of these families are connected to the point where they consider each other their flesh and blood. That is, of course, until they have to marry.” He shivers. “At which point, it’s seen as absolutely acceptable to shag your cousin.”
He was in the middle of trying to find something to cover himself with, panting as he went, when he heard it. Slughorn’s door opening down the hall. Everyone froze for a moment, unsure of what to do as Harry realised there was nothing that he
So, he figured it out. He needed something to bitch about. And, luckily for Hogwarts, he had just the thing. In sixth year, there was a
But, he loved them even more when they came back from their classes, their hands full of pastries they had stolen from the kitchens.
And, of course, Harry and Draco talked on the phone a few times that day (which he was teased endlessly for). Harry had sent Draco a present, not expecting anything in return - after all, he was the one usually buying the gifts in their fake relationship - but a package from Draco had arrived on Christmas Eve with a note that read,
He waited for a while, wondering what was taking him so long. Draco was never late. He was always early. He stood up and began to pace.
“Merlin, Granger, that’s evil.” Pansy said, a smile on her face, although her eyes were still slightly wide with shock. “Maybe you should have been sorted into Slytherin instead.”
“Y - Yes.” He said, shaking his head, and avoiding Ron’s red-faced stare. Apparently Blaise and Charlie had gotten on rather well, after all.
Draco laughed, though Harry could still hear the sadness behind it. “Of course, she’s very interested in who I’m dating.” There was a long pause before Draco spoke again. “And, she likes to know that you’re okay.”
Harry wasn’t paying attention, though. He was too busy letting his eyes wander over to Draco, who was giving him an odd look. Eventually, Draco smiled and nodded at Harry, although the smile didn’t seem to reach his eyes.
Harry found it odd, hearing Draco and Pansy talk about their families in a negative light. When they were younger, they seemed to worship the ground their parents walked on. Harry supposed they had grown since then, but it still felt strange.
Malfoy looked rather taken aback by that, as though he hadn’t expected anyone to notice he was lying. “I… There’s nothing to tell.”
They opened their mouth but a customer came in, and they smirked at Harry’s expression. Harry sighed inwardly and made the customer’s latte as fast as possible before turning to Sam again with an expectant look.
Ron shook his head, but he never could miss a meal, so he followed the group down to the great hall, his hand still scrubbing his face.
Draco let out a laugh. “The three of us got matching pyjamas from our parents last Christmas and we never use them.” He explained. “So, now is the perfect time.”
Harry stopped her with a smile on his face. “Shut up, I’ve not been begging.” He wondered when this had gotten so fun - joking with the Slytherins.
“Shit.” He said under his breath, as Pansy started shoving the two into the nearest dorm room. “Sorry.” He said to Draco, smiling sheepishly.
“Thanks, Hermione.” Harry said after he took a sip. It was just the way he liked it, with a splash of milk and a spoonful of sugar. The warmness in his chest intensified for the hundredth time that day.
Harry, Hermione, Ron and Ginny had said goodbye to the rest of their friends as they left the train station and made their way to the Burrow, none of them commenting on how, even through all of the noise of the Weasley family, the house would be quiet and still without Fred.
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Malfoy’s smirk. He supposed being famous wasn’t all that bad. After all, the news of their newfound ‘friendship’ would be all across Wizarding Britain by tomorrow.
He was walking through the corridors, on his way to the library, when he collided with Malfoy for the second time that month. They smacked into each other, pain instant in Harry’s body, and he heard Malfoy grunt.
Harry smiled slightly. He knew Malfoy would be used to questions about the scars, but he had never given much thought to how he would answer them.
“It seems to be in the corner up there.” He said, pointing to where a purple light showed up in the top corner of the room. “Why did Slughorn put up a surveillance charm in the first place?”
When they entered the Potions cupboard, Draco performed a fancy spell to scan the area for magic. He bit his lip as he did so, and Harry found his gaze drawn to the movement.
“How are you guys here so soon? We were on our way to meet you.” Draco asked, a smile on his face as he looked at his friends.
Hermione still seemed to be trying to hold back her laughs, but she nodded anyway. “Sorry, Harry. It’s not a big deal.” She said, although the look on her face suggested that it was, in fact, a very big deal.
“Sort of. It keeps the nightmares away.” Draco relaxed down onto the bed slightly, shimmying until he was fully lying down.
Although their friendship was fake, he found himself genuinely enjoying Malfoy’s company, which he thought was odd at first. Malfoy had actually started to help Harry with his potions work in the past few weeks that they had been spending together, and Harry was grateful for the help.
They stayed like that for a long while. Harry didn’t know how long it had been, but as time went on, he saw the flowers on Draco’s arm brighten up a bit - not much, but the petals no longer looked as though they were about to fall off. Harry smiled slightly when he realised this, and he silently made a promise to himself to ensure that, by the end of the day, those flowers would be blooming again.
Harry was angry. The Ministry had improved so much since Shacklebolt had become the Minister for Magic, and yet, here he was, interrupting Harry and avoiding his questions. Harry really hadn’t wanted to play this card, but there was no other choice.
“Listen, Harry,” Luna’s voice was as gentle as always, and Harry figured he could probably live in it if it were possible, “I’m glad you came to see me. I’ve been meaning to talk to you about something.”
“It would seem our previous focus on the importance of each of your houses has not been beneficial in all of the ways we had hoped it would be.”
Molly nodded. “I’ve been doing well. I’ve left some biscuits out for you in the living room.” She shooed them towards the living room. “Go on, in you go.”
“What?” Arthur said, his eyes slightly wide. “They can’t be alone for Christmas. Not this year.” He cleared his throat. “You should invite them here.”
Harry practically felt Draco’s inward eye roll at Slughorn’s obvious favouritism, but Harry knew he could use it to their advantage.
Harry nodded. “He knows, Hermione.” Harry said, his voice thick. “He knows I love him. And he’s still leaving.”
“Oh, yeah.” Harry said, smirking. “I could have sworn I heard you with him in the middle of the night.”
She rolled her eyes. “I just heard you make another one of your deals with Tracey.” She walked towards him, and Harry resisted the urge to back away. “Although I have no clue why you’d choose
Harry smiled. “At the last one, a fifth year sat too close to the fireplace and his robes caught fire. We managed to put it out, of course, but his eyebrows are still growing back.”
He couldn’t think of anything else, really. As he served customers, he was thinking of what coffee to make Draco the next time he asked for one. When he was having a meal with Ron and Hermione, he was wishing Draco was there next to him. When he was at work, he was counting down the hours until Draco would wake up. And when he was with Draco, he was so in love with him that he couldn’t see past it.
Harry lifted Draco’s sleeve to reveal the mark. He didn’t react, he couldn’t. He knew Draco needed to know it didn’t bother him. Instead, he lifted the mark to his lips and kissed it. He kissed every part of it, then trailed his kisses upwards, up past Draco’s shoulder and up to his lips. His kisses were gentle and soft as Draco’s hands found their way to Harry’s face, cupping it and massaging it.
Malfoy nodded. “Not right away.” He laughed. “The first thing I did was dye my hair blue.” Harry chuckled at that, his eyes wide.
“It seemed as though he were… looking at me. Watching me, maybe. I screamed for my parents when I saw him, loud in the quiet of the night. They ran in instantly, thinking I’d hurt myself, but when they came in, I watched him… disappear. Like a shadow. He disappeared into the snow, floating away as the snow did. My parents thought I had imagined it - I was a child, after all - but I had known what I saw. So, I stayed up the next evening, waiting to see if he would return. I waited until I couldn’t keep my eyes open, but he never showed up. So, I went to bed, thinking that maybe I
Malfoy breathed out a laugh. “I told you yesterday, Potter. I’m working here for the next few months. Although, when I agreed to it, I wasn’t aware I would be working night shifts.”
“What?” Malfoy asked as he stopped for a moment, malice in his voice, and Harry tried not to wonder when he had started using that tone with Harry again. He had seemed so happy after the war - even his fights with Harry seemed less serious - but this felt as though they were 11 again.
“Oh my god, Harry!” Hermione picked up one of his pillows and whacked him over the head with it, one, two, three times. “He agreed to publicly date you, which went against everything his little pureblood head had been taught before. Then, he made the first move with you. And
“You don’t need to apologise.” Harry was finding this incredibly awkward - and he hadn’t felt awkward around Draco since… well, since their ‘relationship’ started. “Are you doing alright?”
Malfoy’s smile wasn’t polite - it seemed genuine, and open, and he looked more warm and freckled and oh, god, Harry was staring again. “It’s been lovely. You know, the sun and the warmth - you just can’t beat it.”
“Bye.” Harry said. He looked down for a moment, his eyes catching on Malfoy’s tattoo, and he tried not to react when he saw it. Because he saw, just for a moment, what he had been convincing himself wasn’t there. He saw great big antlers that stretched up Malfoy’s stomach. It was a stag. It was so clearly a stag. It was never a doe.
Harry was surprised by how well his friends were taking it. He was worried it would cause some sort of fall-out, but they all seemed to… well, they all seemed to expect this from him. He wondered why that was, but he quickly realised he didn’t really care.
“Well, you guys became friends. And with him and I breaking up… you sort of had to choose me over him.”
After their long shower, they had gotten dressed together, which Harry pointed out was very counterproductive when they could be getting undressed and telling the teachers that they had both gotten very ill overnight.
Malfoy’s smile disappeared completely at that, a deep frown taking over his face. He seemed to be resisting the urge to speak, perhaps trying not to worsen the situation.
Draco let out a small laugh at that. “It would seem so.” He looked down, his face sad and his body tense. “But… you know, it doesn’t change anything. My father still… I can’t be with you.”
the charming blonde who came in to check I was doing okay on my own and asked me to ‘surprise him’.”
Their journey back to Hogwarts was fun. They were all so comfortable with being together now that it felt as though it had always been this way. They laughed and napped and spoke about Hogwarts with the same excitement Harry had felt the first time he had stepped onto the Hogwarts Express. It was just what Harry needed and he felt a lot better by the time they arrived back in the castle.
Harry was shaking as he lifted his hand to knock on Draco’s door, but he forced himself to take a few breaths with Draco’s voice in his mind, telling him to, “Breathe, Harry”. He had prepared what he was about to say about 100 times in his head but, as soon as Draco opened the door, it all went out the window. He hadn’t seen Draco for almost a week, and he had forgotten just how in love with him he actually was. It almost hurt to look at him.
They ate breakfast in comfortable silence, Neville still reading his book intently. Once Theo had finished, he looked at Neville, frowning, and Neville seemed to sense his gaze, finally looking up.
“Umm… yeah, I’m pretty sure I, the person who has the mark, knows how it works.” Draco said, a glint in his eyes.
Malfoy must have sensed what he was about to say, because he held a finger to Harry’s lips, silencing his words (and his breathing) before nodding ever so slightly to his right. Harry followed his movement with his eyes, Malfoy’s finger still against his lips, and realised what was happening.
week for Harry and Draco, but the time seemed to pass in an odd way. Every minute seemed to drag out endlessly into hour after hour and yet, at the same time, at night Harry would feel as though he had no time left. He spent the days either talking to Draco on the phone or lounging around in Draco’s room. The Weasleys had gotten used to their relationship, but they still made jokes about it whenever they could, which Harry somehow found both comforting and unsettling all at once.
“Yeah, well, you see, I noticed that, too. But maybe, if people thought we were together, it would offer you some sort of protection. You know, me being the Chosen One and everything.” Harry hated that name, but he knew that it pissed Malfoy off.
Seamus had just finished talking about the job he had lined up for summer - apparently being an active part of the war was good work experience for… well, every job available in the wizarding world - and finished his story with a loud, “Let’s hope they don’t fire me! I’d like to last longer than a week!”
would you do that?” His cheek looked red, and Harry was sure it would have swollen by tomorrow. “I asked you a question, Potter.”
Harry blinked for a moment. This was odd. “Umm… Seeker Weekly.” He watched as Draco’s eyes stayed blankly fixed on the magazine, and Harry offered, “I could read it to you, if you like?”
Looking around, he saw that Draco was already seated at the Slytherin table, smiling at Harry. Harry gave him a grin, and went to go sit next to him.
“I’ll be here.” Draco said, his hand never wavering as it combed through Harry’s hair. “You’ll be okay.”
, but upon further inspection he realised it was a travel guide, detailing the most beautiful spots in Britain - both wizarding and muggle - and he found that Draco’s handwriting was all over the book. On the inside cover, he had written, “So you never have to feel trapped again” and he had dog-eared many pages, writing about his experiences of some of the locations, extra information, and adding references to their previous discussions about where Harry had wanted to visit.
They made small talk as they walked, smiling and laughing as they went. It was still light outside - summer was always like this - but the cool breeze allowed them both an excuse to keep each other close and Harry was grateful for it.
They finished their snacks and lay down on the bed, Draco’s head on Harry’s chest, as Harry opened up the book.
Before Harry could even register what was going on, Malfoy lunged forwards and pressed his lips to Harry’s. Harry froze, not breathing or moving as he tried to work out what was happening. He took a few seconds to realise that he was
They had just woken up and were both lying in Draco’s bed, Draco holding Harry from behind, tangled in each other, tracing light circles across each other’s skin. They had spent the most part of the last week in Draco’s bed, passing the time until Draco’s father had officially given Narcissa his assets. Harry had received the letter from Shacklebolt yesterday evening detailing the successful transfer, and Harry and Draco had celebrated with a bottle of Firewhiskey and Draco’s bed. And his shower. And his floor. It was perfect timing, really, as Pansy and Blaise were currently on their way from France to visit Draco.
. He felt positively ill at the thought of facing the Weasleys and talking about this unfortunate fact. But, he knew he would have to go back eventually, and putting it off would likely make it worse. With a sick feeling in his stomach, he said goodbye to Draco and Narcissa, stepped into the fireplace, and closed his eyes.
Harry was done. He was sick of everything. He was sick of having the same dream over and over, he was sick of seeing Malfoy’s eyes every time he closed his eyes, and he was sick of thinking about their damn kiss.
“Ah, Potter. You know, when Draco told me you guys were shagging, I wasn’t all that surprised, but when he told me you guys were
Ron and Hermione had gotten rather good at cooking. After the war, they used to cook for Harry every day. He wasn’t a fan of cooking and he wasn’t in the headspace to do much of anything, really. But, recently he had been living off of takeaways and the few meals he could make for himself. His visits to Ron and Hermione’s flat were luxury in comparison to his usual food.
Harry paid attention, too, listening intently and even managing a laugh or two as he listened to Seamus tell a story. Harry had already heard the story at least twice, but enjoyed it nonetheless. After about half an hour, Luna left him, placing a gentle kiss on the top of Harry’s head and disappearing to her dorm. Harry was planning to leave, as well, but Seamus scooted closer to him and he decided that his bed could wait a little bit longer.
She said loudly, her eyes wide. Draco swallowed beside Harry and let his hand slip off of his arm, as though it had never been there in the first place.
So, when it happened, he was tired. He was tired, and angry at the world, and he had just seen Malfoy fucking
He took a deep breath and started reading. “Lucius Malfoy, father of Draco Malfoy, reveals the truth about his son and Harry Potter to Rita Skeeter, Special Correspondent. Recently imprisoned and ready to tell all, Mr Malfoy has claimed he always knew…” Harry trailed off, reading ahead slightly.
Harry lowered his voice and leaned in closer to Luna. “Isn’t it… difficult? You know, after what his family did to you?”
A month or so had passed since Harry and Draco’s almost-kiss, and it was as though nothing had changed. Harry barely thought about it anymore, and it seemed as though Draco didn’t mind much either. After all, Harry thought, these things happen all the time. Friends sometimes kiss each other and it doesn’t mean anything. There had been plenty of nights out during the summer where Harry and his friends would snog each other and it was always completely normal afterwards.
They sat and talked for a while, both smiling more than usual, and then Malfoy went on his way to work. As he walked out the door, he called out to Harry, “Saturday, 8pm, I’ll pick you up from here.”
They all rolled their eyes and Blaise chucked a cushion at Harry’s head, but Harry knew that they understood what he meant anyway. They sat in silence for a while, watching the fire burn. They had lessons tomorrow, and it was far too late to be up like this, but none of them slept well, anyway. Harry realised how much he loved them all. They had been through hell together, and apart, but it didn’t matter. They had each other now. And this was good. He was finally happy.
They paused for a moment, staring at each other, feeling everyone holding their breath in anticipation.
day to drag the three of us out on a walk in the forest, and Pansy and I were livid. It was miserable, trudging through the mud in the rain - we were each using about a dozen warming and drying charms - and I, of course, was complaining the whole time.” Harry smiled slightly at that. “But, after a while, we came across a clearing. It opened out into a huge field that was full of flowers. It was still pouring, of course, but there was a kind of mist in the air, and the sky was a beautiful shade of purple. It was strangely… comforting. For a moment, we all stopped speaking, just looking at the flowers and the sky. Then, Pansy started laughing and dragged us all out into the field, dancing like a mad person. We all dropped our charms and danced for a while, laughing in the rain.” Draco swallowed and Harry felt it against his skin. “Of course, we were soaking by the time we got home, and our parents berated us for staying out so long, but,
They started walking again and Harry rolled his eyes. “Please, that man is obsessed with me. He doesn’t care about my homework.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Of course not, I’m not an idiot. All of our muggle friends think we’re muggles, too.”
He took a seat next to Ron and Hermione. Hermione was sitting cross-legged with her back against an armchair, and Ron was laying on his back with his head in her lap. He had his eyes closed, but he opened them when he heard Harry rummaging around next to him. He didn’t say anything, but he gave Harry a smile that was equal parts reassurance and pride, whilst Hermione beamed.
Harry tried to have fun. He tried to dance and laugh and eat, but he felt rather nauseous with the nerves. What if Malfoy
couldn’t help it, because his name sounded so good in Draco’s voice, and he could feel Draco’s words on his skin, and all of a sudden, he was reaching forward and kissing Draco hard.
Malfoy giggled slightly, and Harry found himself thinking of what Sam said again. “They’re nice. You chose a good one there, Harry.”
always did. Harry was finding it extremely difficult to pay attention to anything Slughorn was saying, because he was too busy thinking about the kiss. It had been over a week since it had happened, and Harry still couldn’t think of anything else.
They both laughed for a couple of minutes, every now and then commenting on the whole ordeal whilst trying not to fall off their chairs.
Draco laughed. “Don’t be. You were right, I didn’t enjoy the whole ‘being alone’ thing.” He smirked. “Your friends might be growing on me.”
Harry looked up at Hermione, his eyes wide. She was looking rather squirrelly, knowing what he was about to say.
resembling a gunshot, but even that couldn’t drown out the eruption of noise from the students on the other side of the door.
Oddly enough, it felt as though the 6 of them had always been friends - the conversation flowed surprisingly easily and there were no uncomfortable silences. Luna, Seamus and Dean joined them shortly after, all sitting on the floor and joining in the discussion.
“Well, instead of covering it with a tattoo, I was thinking you could surround it with a tattoo. Imagine this,” He grabbed Draco’s forearm, touching the mark with his finger to demonstrate his idea. “If you surrounded it with a tattoo like flowers or something, the lines of the mark would look much less… harsh, and it would almost be like you chose this tattoo.”
Draco had hugged Molly. He had seen Harry and Ron’s jumpers in the past - had teased them for it - but, when Harry was having a particularly bad day and he had pulled on the jumper for comfort, Draco had also complimented it. He had touched the wool and told Harry how loved he was. He had known what it had meant to Harry, and now Harry knew what it meant for Draco to be given such a gift.
By Saturday, Draco was a mess. He didn’t leave his bed all day and barely ate anything. Harry sat and read to him, offering him all the comfort he could give. In the evening, Draco cried in Harry’s arms and Harry rocked him until he fell asleep, but Harry stayed awake. He couldn’t sleep. He held Draco, feeling his deep breaths and his slow, steady heartbeat, but Harry lay awake until the birds began to chirp and the sun filled Draco’s room.
Harry grinned. “Oh, right.” He scanned the room. He considered asking one of the Gryffindors - he could aim his questions more easily that way - but he decided against it. Inter-house unity and everything. “Blaise, truth or dare?”
Pansy smirked. “These two idiots, of course,” she gestured to Harry and Draco, “and, obviously, Luna and Ginny.”
at healing charms, honestly, but I was really fucking good at Glamours. I used to use them to change my hair and my eyes when my father wasn’t around, so, when the cuts were first healing, I used them to cover it up. Usually, a Glamour takes a lot of concentration and magic to keep up, but I created a potion that helps it stick throughout the day. Which was the first potion that I sold in France, actually.” He cleared his throat. “For two years, I had a Glamour up all the time. I kept it up when I was asleep, just in case, and no one knew about it. But, after the war and the trials, my father wasn’t around to tell me what was ‘weak’ or ‘right’ anymore.”
“Yeah, mate. You know we fully support you, but I don’t think many other people at Hogwarts will be all that welcoming. Especially because it’s him.”
“I violated the sign, thanks to you.” Pansy said, although she looked like she couldn’t care less about the bloody sign as Ginny shifted closer to her in her seat.
behind in my classes?” Ron asked, looking in the mirror one final time before turning towards the rest of the group.
Harry didn’t know what to do. He didn’t know what to say. He supposed that fantasies could be harmless - after all, Draco had also said he had thought about
Pansy gasped and started laughing as Draco rolled his eyes and flipped Blaise off. “Stop trying to distract from the fact that you’re shagging a Weasley.”
After a few hours of Draco looking rather uncomfortable, the tattoo artist declared, “You’re all done!” and Harry was finally allowed to look.
Harry had been anxious all day, coming up with a million awful reasons for what he had seen in his dreams. Eventually, he decided that talking to Malfoy could help. If he could find out why he had the tattoo, maybe he could figure out why he had been in Harry’s dreams.
Harry rolled his eyes, but continued anyway, ensuring his voice was as quiet as possible. “I need you to… pretend that we’re dating.” Harry said it in a rush, trying to stop himself from blushing and ultimately failing.
Ron was the last to wake up, unsurprisingly, and he looked seriously disturbed when he woke up and found everyone to be staring at him with odd smiles on their faces.
. He looked around, expecting… well, he didn’t know, really. But, whatever he was expecting, it wasn’t this. This was… plain. There were no posters, no pictures, no
He pulled out his wand and, with a flick of his wrist, the purple light in the corner of the room vanished.
I realised that I forgot to include Hermione's parents in the last chapter like I meant to, sorry! I've adapted, though and I've made a minor adjustment in the last chapter! Sorry for the slow update!
Saturday nights were always Harry’s favourite when visiting Muggle London. He supposed he hadn’t really taken advantage of turning 18 enough - he was too busy with schoolwork, and his adoring fans and, well, Draco. But, he had certainly had a fun summer, drowning his post-war sorrows in booze and sex, while Ron and Hermione were much more reserved in the muggle clubs. They mostly kept to themselves, as their relationship status really only permitted them to dance with each other.
Harry shook his head. “They said that you’re charming and that the scars… the scars are hot.” Malfoy smiled, so Harry added, “And they said you clearly have daddy issues.”
Not many people were still awake, let alone in the common room, at this time of night, but Harry inwardly cursed himself when he saw that Ron and Seamus were on the sofa. They both turned towards Harry when they heard him stumble in.
She nodded. “Mmhmm. I don’t care how you do it - you can kill half of them for all I care - just as long as it’s not so bloody sacred.” She sighed. “Look, I know it’s a lot, but you’re probably the only person in Wizarding Britain who holds the same amount of power as them. Can you do it?”
Hermione’s eyes widened. “What?” She said loudly, earning a few shushes from around her. She was looking between Harry and Malfoy in a rush, and when she spoke again she whispered. “What do you mean? The one at the Great Lake?”
“Mmm, this is fucking delicious, I have no idea how you do it.” Malfoy said, licking the foam from around his lips. Harry tried not to stare too much. It’s just that one of his scars ran from his cheek to his chin and went right through his lips. That was all. It wasn’t because he had swore again. And it wasn’t because his tongue had swiped across his lip. Not at all. “Well, the British Ministry for Magic has asked for my assistance on one of their cases, and all of the Aurors working on it are working the night shift. It hasn’t been my favourite job.” He stopped to take a sip. “And we’re called potioneers, which is the worst name for a legitimate profession that I’ve ever heard.” Harry laughed loudly and Malfoy joined him for a moment.
“Shut up.” Draco’s laugh was contagious and Harry couldn’t help laughing, too. “Fine. I was at this club in muggle London.” God, he couldn’t believe he was telling Draco this. “And I met this girl who, can I just say, was the most attractive girl I have ever seen in my life. Like, mind-blowingly attractive, okay?”
Except, McGonagall clearly thought differently, because she continued to speak. “I will be arranging a ball for all senior students to attend at the end of the month. Whilst attendance isn’t compulsory, it is greatly encouraged. I’m hoping this night will help us unify the houses for the first time in decades.”
Draco let out a snort beside him and Harry elbowed him lightly in the ribs as the kid declared loudly, “Harry Potter, truth or dare”.
Hermione couldn’t contain her smile. “I told him I didn’t want to stay home, and he told me that he had been wanting to take care of the baby anyway. He had already written up his notice for work. He’s so excited.”
Harry decided this was enough socialising, he would ask Malfoy about the tattoo later. Or never. It didn’t matter. He just couldn’t stand seeing this side of Malfoy when he was feeling so bad himself.
Their little circle seemed to have a level of privacy and comfort to it that Harry had been wanting his whole life. All he had wanted was one peaceful year at Hogwarts and, by some miracle, he had gotten it. Even though it wasn’t what he had expected, it somehow felt so
She laughed. “It’s alright.” She gave him a tight squeeze before letting him go. “It’ll take some time, but… They’ll heal eventually.” She cleared her throat. “We all will.” She then squeezed Harry’s arm and made her way up to bed.
Harry was sure he had never seen Pansy so excited, and Luna looked rather happy herself, so she allowed herself to be pulled away by Pansy, whilst dropping her half empty cup into Harry’s hand. They were gone so fast that Harry wasn’t sure what to do.
“I guess we’re moving to France.” He said. He couldn’t stop staring at Draco. At his eyes. At his face. At the scars.
“Can you…” Harry swallowed through the tears. “Can you tell me something, please?” He cleared his throat. “Something nice.”
“It’s okay. Later.” He turned his head back to a more comfortable position. When he spoke again, his voice was quiet and muffled. “I’m much too tired for forgiveness right now, Harry. Would you be satisfied with a half-arsed ‘goodnight’?”
“What’s the matter, Harry?” Luna placed a comforting hand on his back and Harry remembered how grateful he was to have her in his life. He loved their friendship - she somehow always understood him in a way that his other friends couldn’t, and she never looked at him as though he were crazy (which was exactly what he needed after the war).
“Not bad, Harry.” Draco said with a smile, and his hand dropped from Harry’s face to his waist, where he began to trace circles on Harry’s side with his thumb. Harry knew no one would actually see that, but still thought it was a nice touch.
“So Pansy goes both ways?” Harry asked, trying to be casual about it. The truth was, he didn’t really know anyone who was into both men and women.
Harry’s eyebrows shot up, surprised at how well the Weasleys were taking his newfound friendship. “Umm… they’re staying at Hogwarts. None of them felt like going home, I suppose.”
Harry knew himself pretty well, and he was painfully aware of how fast he was falling in love. He couldn’t stop it - his head was spinning with the feeling. He had to remind himself that it had only been a few months, and it was far too early to be thinking such things. But, a part of him, the part that liked to fantasise, told him that it
Harry grinned. “I see. Well, shouldn’t you also buy me things I can afford but don’t want to pay for? Or does this rule only apply for posh twats, sweetheart?”
He stayed and chatted to Blaise about what he had seen in Potions, before Pansy and Draco emerged from one of their rooms and roped Harry into a heated debate on what the muggle phrase, “birds of a feather flock together”, meant and all of a sudden it was time for dinner.
Draco gave Harry a smile, but it was small and disingenuous. Harry tried to smile back, but he found it impossible. He was losing Draco.
“Um… well,” Harry fished in his pocket. “I still have a copy of your key.” He held the key out to Draco. “I figured you would need it back. You know, because you’re leaving.”
Harry’s head popped out of the covers just barely. “Yeah?” His voice was rough with sleep and tears and anxiety.
When he arrived at Draco’s they went up to his room immediately. Harry held Draco in his bed until his tears stopped falling and they both fell asleep. When they woke up, he held him again, rocking him as he sobbed, and when Draco stopped crying, he still held him. Until the day had passed and they fell asleep again. He held them as they waited.
Malfoy’s eye roll as he read the sentence, ‘This has only been found to be possible in powerful wizards, likely due to the amount of magic and skill required for the charm to be successful’. Harry was rather pleased at the insinuation that he was able to pull such a thing off, but his mood was immediately shattered as he read on. ‘The user’s motivation to communicate with the subject of the spell must, too, be powerful. This has only been seen in wizards with a very personal and urgent connection with whom they wish to contact.’
Salazar’s Socks was. He turned to Pansy to ask her, but she spoke with a smirk on her face before he could get a word out.
“Before I answer that, you can’t ask any questions.” She frowned deeply at that, so he continued speaking. “But, if you do this, no questions asked,
Draco seemed to be unsure of what to say, but he said something anyway. And Harry hated what he said. “I don’t think it’s a good idea.”
There was a murmur of agreement so Harry flashed Blaise a smile and leaned into Draco slightly, their arms still touching. There was a feeling of discomfort around the room as Harry cleared his throat, preparing to ask the next person. He needed to lighten the mood, so he smiled and looked at Pansy.
“Well, we can’t tell anyone. Not even our friends, so that means you can’t be sending any letters to Parkinson or Zabini about this, okay?”
Harry rolled his eyes at the question but he knew he wouldn’t be able to resist answering. He felt the truth bubble up inside him, so he cleared his throat and spoke, his voice sure. “Well, it was a nice break from all this bullsh…” He felt Draco nudge him. “Nonsense.” He said quickly, earning scattered laughter from around the room. He felt another answer coming - apparently the Veritaserum didn’t think his answer was adequate. “It was peaceful and painless and…” Harry strained to stop speaking, feeling as though he was about to say something he regretted, like “I sometimes wish I could go back.”
Draco pulled him into a kiss, a proper one this time. Harry ran one of his hands through Draco’s hair, and let the other one slip underneath Draco’s shirt and run along his back.
- that he was done speaking about the scars. The war was over. He and Malfoy were happy. It didn’t matter.
She frowned deeply. “What?” She shook her head. “So, you mean to tell me that you’ve been going around snogging Slytherins, for what? The noise in the Great Hall to come back?”
“What an astute observation.” Draco’s smile was apparent in his voice. “You know, I’m educated in both muggle and wizarding literature. That’s just common sense. Even when I lived with my father, I would still read the muggle classics.”
Draco nodded, still smiling. He was often smiling nowadays, Harry realised. “That was what I was hoping would happen. I know you’ve been promoting inter-house unity, Harry, but the rivalry’s still here. If the Gryffindors drink, the Slytherins will, too. At least, this way, some poor fuckers will be spilling all of their secrets.”
“That would be embarrassing if I could care about anything right now.” Harry said, rolling over so he was beside Malfoy.
Hermione’s outburst left Harry shocked and unable to speak for a moment. “Oh my god.” He said slowly, goosebumps rising on his arms. “He wants me.”
Harry sat in front of McGonagall, waiting for her to speak. She had been staring at him and Malfoy for the full minute that they had been sitting there since they arrived. Malfoy was in the seat next to Harry, slightly slouched over and his leg jumping up and down. Harry unconsciously tapped his finger along with Malfoy’s shaking leg. The only sound in the room was the clock beside them, which seemed to tick away all of the time they were wasting.
He shook his head and walked towards one of the many available showers, ready to forget about the other person. Except, he
Harry didn’t have an answer for that - he didn’t even know what he was doing himself - so, he did the only thing he could think of doing. He punched Malfoy in the face.
Draco smiled. “I can handle it, Harry. I shared a house with him for a year.” Draco looked at the ground, not meeting Harry’s gaze.
Before leaving the Great Hall to go back to the eighth year common room, he gave Malfoy one last glance and, feeling half the school’s eyes on him as he stood up, winked at him, grinned, and began to walk away as he heard a murmur of whispers spread through the hall.
He cried for hours, and they stayed with him until he drifted off to sleep to the sound of his own tears.
Draco nodded, his smile widening. “She loves secrets.” He reached over to the table in the middle of the room, picking up his drink. When he sunk back into the sofa, he was sitting closer to Harry, almost touching him again, and Harry smiled silently.
“Oh, it’s no problem, really. A small price to pay for our freedom.” Shacklebolt smiled, but it looked rather fake. “Is there anything else you’ll be needing, Mr Potter?”
It’s just that… when they had sat down at their usual table, a new coffee in hand, Harry had looked at Malfoy again,
“Agreed.” Ginny rolled her eyes, shrugging on her robes with a groan. “It’s the first day back and I’m already sick of school.”
probably a good idea for McGonagall to get rid of the house system altogether. It had never brought him any good.
They were both sitting in the library, at Malfoy’s usual table. Although the surrounding tables had started to fill up more ever since they started being seen there together, the library was mostly empty, aside from a couple of other students that were sitting on the other side of the library. It was late at night and only eighth years had 24 hour access to the library. The lights were rather low, bright enough to read the books on the table, but still provided students with a level of privacy that many eighth years used to their advantage (particularly couples).
“I got the tattoo because…” Malfoy took a deep breath. “I’ve been seeing it in my dreams.” He said, his voice unsure.
“I’m sorry, Harry.” He said in a voice barely above a whisper. He continued to trace lines on Harry’s knee, even as Harry felt his movements stutter with his deep breaths.
Malfoy looked him up and down, and Harry could practically feel Sam’s excitement from beside him. “Well, who will be making my drink today? I don’t want Potter to be messing it up.”
Pansy was still smiling, too. “We got here early, and we thought it would be fun to come back to the castle right away.”
irresponsible, Potter.” Harry thought it was odd that she was still using his last name, considering the fact that she was literally in his lap right now. “All of the games we play are adaptable. Whoever wants to drink can drink, but it’s not required.”
Harry looked at Malfoy, expecting to see some sort of reaction. But instead, Malfoy just nodded. “Yeah, that would be nice. You know, you guys are actually sort of similar.”
“So, whenever I’m angry or sad, the flowers start to shrivel up, but when I’m happy, they’re in full bloom.”
Pansy rolled her eyes, and gave him one last hit for good measure. “Oh, yeah? Did you get him a thong, too?”
“Okay, in the spirit of inter-house unity,” Draco flashed Harry a smile and Harry rolled his eyes, “We’re playing a muggle game tonight.” Draco grinned as he placed a vial on the table in the centre of the room. “But with a wizarding twist.” Harry frowned. Surely, that wasn’t - “This is Veritaserum. We’re playing Truth or Dare.”
They had all made their way back up to the Gryffindor common room after dinner. The common room was full now, whereas they had basically had the place to themselves before (the common room was mostly empty after classes nowadays - Harry wasn’t sure why this was, but the Gryffindors seemed to be in the mood for a change of scene, finding new areas to study throughout the castle). The Slytherins had gotten a couple of nasty looks, but Harry had simply glared back at the other people in the common room and said something along the lines of, “if you’re not careful, I’ll be taking down that sign outside”, which was usually rather successful.
Hermione rolled her eyes again. “You’ve been in love with him since you were eleven, Harry. Talk to him tonight.”
“Although, I’m not sure you could even call it a first time.” She said, burying her face in her hands, her voice muffled slightly. “It lasted about ten seconds and I could barely even feel it.”
“Holy shit, Potter, this is amazing!” Harry tried not to think about the fact that he had never heard Malfoy swear before, and adamantly ignored the fact that those words sounded so good in his posh accent. Instead, he focused on Malfoy’s grin. “Is this on the menu?”
rumour would be spreading. About him and Daphne Greengrass. And him and Theodore Nott. And him and Tracey Davis. And him and any Slytherin in his year that would be willing to be
Harry nodded, still furious, almost unable to control his rage. He allowed himself to be guided out of the Hall and into the corridors, as Draco held on to his hand tightly.
Harry would dare say that Draco was becoming friends with Ron and Hermione. He had already apologised to them after the war, and it seemed as though they had forgiven him since then. At first, they had been wary of him, approaching him with caution and an overwhelming amount of awkward politeness. But, after pulling their wands on three of his tormentors, they started to move on from small talk. Draco and Ron started to play wizard's chess and Ron was immensely happy for a worthy competitor, at last. While playing, they would often bond over their confusion over certain muggle objects and traditions, and would eventually ask Harry and Hermione to explain as they listened in fascination. Hermione found herself immersed in deep intellectual conversations with Draco, discussing both muggle and wizarding literature, while Harry and Ron tried to stay as far away from their conversations as possible. The more friendly they got, the more Harry began to regret his decision to not tell them the truth about his and Draco’s relationship.
She almost squealed in delight. “I’ve been saving this one for a while.” She said, and Harry sighed.
Harry sat in the Great Hall, listening to McGonagall’s speech about interhouse unity and watching Malfoy from the Gryffindor table. He watched as Pansy Parkinson nudged him and whispered in his ear, and he smiled - a real smile, not a smirk, not a cruel grin, but a smile - and he thought how unfair it all was. Harry was miserable. He had defeated Voldemort and he was miserable. But Malfoy, the bastard, seemed perfectly happy. Happier than he was before the war, in fact. Everywhere Harry went, Malfoy was there, laughing with his friends, or reading with a smile on his face, or writing in his little notebook that he carried around with him. What was even in that notebook, anyway?
Malfoy practically spat the words out as he spoke again. “Why would someone do that? You just couldn’t handle not being the one to save everyone. You just
Seamus nodded. “When you guys got together, it felt like you had been leading up to it for years.” There was a pause where Harry worked out what he could respond to that, but Seamus spoke again. “And what his dad said to Rita Skeeter… It’s despicable. I’m really sorry.”
“Time for potions.” Draco smirked. “Slughorn will be shocked that you’ve done your homework right, for once.”
He groaned at the sight and, overtaken by lust, he grabbed Malfoy’s arms and flipped him over. Harry was now straddling him and he kissed him hard, spurred on by Malfoy’s moans as he did so.
As Malfoy pushed Harry towards his bedroom, removing his and Harry’s suit jackets as they went, Harry thought to himself that he didn’t care about anything in this moment other than Malfoy. He didn’t care that he had work tomorrow which he was most definitely going to be late for. He didn’t care that his friends would think he was crazy for wanting this. And he certainly didn’t care that they were doing this on the first date. They had been leading up to this moment since they were eleven fucking years old - how
There was quite a bit more yelling before Molly finally declared that enough was enough and everyone ought to leave Harry alone. Harry took the first chance he got to leave the room and return to his bedroom, where he shut the door and lay down in his cot with a sigh.
Harry was sure Malfoy wasn’t coming. It was probably an accident. He had meant to say ‘see you later’, instead of ‘see you tomorrow’. A common mistake, really. After all, it was almost closing time and it was about to get dark. No one buys coffee when it’s dark. And it was fine, no harm done, because it’s not like Harry had been waiting around for Malfoy to come in. No. He had been working. A lot of work to do. Which is why he was open past closing time tonight - he had a lot of paperwork to go over and rent was due in… 2 weeks.
“Umm… I…” Harry frantically searched for a response to his question, and said the first thing that popped into his head. “I need your help.”
Luna looked a bit confused but smiled nonetheless and came to join them when they made room for her. “What are you doing here, Harry?”
Draco held Harry’s face and brought it up to his own, whispering. “How did I get so lucky to have this - to have you?”
Harry’s plan had worked out brilliantly, which was uncommon for him, and he was insanely happy. But, it was hard to remember how happy he was when Draco looked at him as though they had always been friends. As though Harry had never split Draco’s chest open and Draco had never become a death eater. As though Voldemort had never been born. It was nauseatingly sweet to be looked at in such a way, and Harry felt as though he could cry with how good Draco looked doing it.
Sorry for the delay in updating this fic! These past few weeks have been hard for me and I haven't been able to write very often. Please accept these next two chapters as a fluffy apology for the wait!! :)
After a few moments, Draco spoke between laughs, his words only slurring slightly. “How are you enjoying your first Slytherin game night?”
Harry’s heart stopped for a moment and his breath quickened. He nodded and whispered back, “I want to let him sleep for a bit more. Can you leave it on the desk?”
“Are your friends alright with coming tonight?” He asked, a smile still on his face, but fiddling with his robes as he spoke.
Harry got the sense that he shouldn’t ask any more questions, so he stayed silent - he knew that whatever he asked would be answered honestly - but Pansy cleared her throat and whispered, “She cheated on me.”
They came rushing in in a blur, and it took everything Harry had to not yell to Hermione from the door. They spotted her instantly, practically sprinting to her table, Harry speaking in a rush.
Harry inhaled sharply, looked around a few times, then sat down across from Malfoy. He lowered his voice to a whisper. “Look, this is going to sound crazy.” Malfoy looked at Harry with a mix of confusion and distaste. “But I need you to… Well, I need someone to… It’s just I…”
Draco and Blaise’s shocked expressions from behind him, and he smiled. “In time for what, Pans?” He heard Draco splutter behind him. ‘Pans’ was what
Harry’s heart was beating fast. He leaned in closer, dropping his gaze to Malfoy’s mouth, and biting his lip for a moment. He could have sworn he heard Malfoy take a sharp breath when he released his lip from his teeth. Just as their lips were about to meet, they heard a noise, and they both jumped away from each other, looking up to see who was there.
After a long silence, Harry eventually spoke. “Well,” He started, his voice slightly rough. “I guess that solves that problem.”
He got up, finding his clothes from around Malfoy’s apartment (which was big and beautiful in the daylight) and wrote a note that he placed next to Malfoy on the bed.
Draco chuckled. “I’ll have to ask Blaise about it. It’s complicated magic. Hogwarts magic is difficult to alter.”
However, that was a decision he was quickly regretting as he and Draco stood outside of Ron and Hermione’s flat, waiting for them to answer the door. Draco seemed fidgety beside him, adjusting his sleeves and standing up straight. Harry grabbed his hand and gave it a squeeze as Hermione opened the door, a smile on her face.
Hermione sat down on his bed beside him, passing him a croissant and keeping her voice soft. “You should eat.”
As they ate, they discussed whatever small talk they could think of, but it was much less awkward and boring than the other kind of small talk he usually had. Draco and Narcissa seemed rather happy, all things considered. They seemed to truly love each other, and not in the obligatory family way that Draco had always loved his father. It was endearing to watch. As well as this, they had a certain way about them that made their presence surprisingly easy and enjoyable for Harry to be around. Whatever it was, it filled their morning with laughter and left Draco looking a lot happier than he did last night - as though he had forgotten about Rita Skeeter all together.
Harry took a moment to recover from the shock of his surprise appearance. “Um… yes, Mr Shacklebolt, sir.”
“Fuck, I’m so sorry, Draco.” Harry knew this was all his fault. “Do you want me to come and see you?”
“If you must know,” Malfoy said, his voice harsh, “That tattoo is rather personal. It’s none of your fucking business.”
“I have no fucking clue.” He said, and stormed out of the library, on a mission to find Malfoy and ask him the same question he had just been asked.
Harry didn’t know what to do. He looked at Malfoy, and Malfoy looked at him. They both knew they had messed up. They knew that kiss they were about to have was not fake. If it were fake, they would have gone through with it when they heard someone. But they didn’t.
As they talked, the other Slytherins started pouring in, each of them frowning at the sight of Gryffindors in the common room. When the majority of Slytherin had eventually arrived, Draco stood up.
Pansy nudged Harry’s shoulder and started pushing him up from off the sofa. “Get on with it, Potter. We haven’t got all night.”
And with that, he left. He closed the door and walked to the hospital wing, feeling numb. When he arrived, Madam Pomfrey fussed over him and asked him what happened, but he simply sat there, waiting for this to be over. Waiting for everything to be over.
Malfoy smirked. “I suited it rather well.” He shook his head, his smile widening. “The hair paired with the copious amounts of eyeliner really defined my rebel stage.”
Harry woke up tangled in Draco, unable to tell whose arms belonged to who for one drowsy moment. His head was pounding and he felt slightly nauseous but he didn’t care. He was happy.
“What’s got you in such a good mood?” He asked them as they put on their apron and dropped their jacket in the back.
"Disciplinary hearing of the twelfth of August into offences committed under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery and the International Statute of Secrecy by Harry James Potter, resident at number four, Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey."
Harry couldn't believe it. He could not believe it. He fancied Draco bloody Malfoy. He had to get over this. And fast. Like. Ultra fast. He berated himself for even paying it this much attention and pulled himself away from his thoughts to try and enjoy himself with his two best friends.
He had all his supplies as Ms Weasley had gone out and bought it for him while he was at the ministry for the trial. They had also discovered a few days earlier that Hermione and, surprisingly, Ron, had been made prefects. When Ms Weasley had found out she'd just about thrown a fit in here happiness, and Ron has gotten a shiny new broom for it.
“...Harry?” Hermione asked after a few seconds. She was looking at him with pleading eyes, trying to get him to say something.
All the boys fell asleep pretty quickly except for Harry who, for the life of him, could not get Malfoy out of his bloody head. He thought he would surely go insane if he thought about him any moment longer so, once he assured himself that all the boys were asleep, he crept out of bed and into the bathroom.
As he walked down to the dungeons with Ron and Hermione he braced himself for the inevitable mini heart attack he would have when he walked into the room. He took a deep breath and walked through the door, only to find that his infuriating infatuation was not there. Harry immediately felt uneasy, Draco never missed a Potions class. As he sat down with Ron at their usual table he glanced over and asked
He didn't want them to find out just yet so most of his attention was spent on that. He tried to make it natural, going to the library, sneaking out in the invisibility cloak, making lesson plans with them like usual. At the moment he was mildly sure none of them suspected anything. Ron least of all he thought. He was lucky his best friend wasn't too sharp. However his other one was and he thought she might be picking up on something.
happen and he hated to even let himself think about it because it brought on a type of sadness that the numbness couldn't conceal. When those dreams happened he got up and he cut, or if he couldn't even do that, he laid and cried silent tears.
Harry groaned but he smiled a bit. “No problem Hermione. Now get off of me I have to go get my transfiguration essay done” the last part he said because Hermione has latched onto him in a absolutely bone crushing hug.
"Ah Mr Potter. No luck finding a partner? Well then your in luck that one of my students is away today."
Then Harry heard a calm voice behind him say: "Witness for the defence, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore"
Obviously Harry did a double take as he was wearing what could be considered pyjamas by the way they looked rumpled and worn in. Harry found himself looking down at the mans abs and forced himself to look up, tho he couldn't stop himself licking his lips just the once.
At that point Ron was standing over his shoulder glaring down at the words "I'm gonna kill her"  he said.
Bloody hell, he thought, I fancy Malfoy. He shook his head in disbelief. "This can not be happening" He muttered to himself, leaning his forehead against the window.
" I'm proud of you Harry. So very proud. I know how hard this must have been for you and I'm honoured you trusted us all enough to share that with us."  Sirius smirked. "Now go find yourself a lad off at Hogwarts to snog Eh?" He laughed.
And at that he flicked his wand and Malfoy was pushed out of the compartment as the door slid shut, Rattling in its frame.
"Oh Harry dear you've made it thank goodness I was getting worried. Now the order is still in a meeting so why don't you go up to find the others. Second floor, Second door on the left now dear Ron and Hermione will explain everything"
Hermione started a bit at that and started muttering to herself eyes wide, but before he could ask what was wrong the first years arrived.
manner and then turned begrudgingly away from the beautiful boy next to him to look at the blackboard where Snape was explaining the project.
Harry growled under his breath and shot out a snappy "Or maybe I'm just trying to, you know, save the entire wizarding world from inevitable doom at the hands of Voldemort" Harry rolled his eyes and stood up to meet Dracos glare. He was sick of holding in his feelings and it was making him pissed. Maybe a good fight would get rid of them. "But you'd know all about Voldemort's little plans wouldn't you Malfoy" He cocked his head and sneered "Or is daddy too distrusting to share"
"What is this place?" Harry asked. Almost immediately the smile dropped of of Ron's face and Hermione looked down guiltily.
"C'mon mate! Mums made bacon and eggs!" Ron said sounding as delighted as can be. Harry swears he can eat more then Hagrid sometimes.
Draco was packed and ready to leave before Harry so he surreptitiously watched him glide out of the room sighing a bit as he remembered the dreams he'd had about them. He forced himself to choke down his blush and got up to go to his dorm for a quick break before dinner.
Harry finally came to his senses. “Nope. Nope nope nopety nope nope” Harry said immediately getting up. “I will not run this group.” He said as he walked out of The Three Broomsticks, Ron and Hermione following close behind.
She frowned.  "Hmph. I was never good at cleaning spells. My mother was much better. Somehow got the socks to fold themselves and everything"
Two of Harry’s old teachers are in his house. No he didn’t get magically transported to school. Instead he’s being rescued by.....THE ADVANCED GUARD *dun dun duuunnnnnn*
They spent the rest of dinner talking and laughing about how good it was to be back and what classes they would have. Harry was not looking forward to potions as he knew he had it with the Slytherin's and he was sure that his grades would be dropping considerably in that course and any classes they had with the slytherin variety.
They went up to the common room after getting the password from the Head Boy, and, feeling very full and tired, they all went up to their dormitories and got dressed for bed.
And then she found the DA. Cho Chang's friend Marietta had blabbered about it and Umbridges infernal Inquisitorial Squad  had triumphed the Room Of Requirement, but luckily they'd gotten everyone out safely. After that ridiculous stunt they had decided not to hold anymore meetings for a while just to be safe which made Harry restless and antsy for something to distract himself lest he spiral. However soon enough he did.
Draco rushed forward and brandished his wand, causing Harry to flinch, but he only cast a healing charm.
They flew for hours and hours Moody directing them in complicated patterns and doubling back until everyone was frozen to their brooms. Harry enjoyed every second, though he wished he had brought a jacket.
He went into his trunk, grabbed the old switchblade he’d brought by accident from the Dursley’s, went into the bathroom, and chose a place to slice.
Harry scanned the boys body, his long legs, slim torso, all the way up to his pale blonde hair. Wait. Harry thought... He thought he knew who that pale blond hair belonged to and he didn't want to believe it.
As soon as it hit curfew he put down the quill and started getting up to leave, only to hear Umbridge say "where do you think your going Mr Potter? You were late you need to make up that time."  And, unwilling to argue with her, Harry sat back down and wrote his lines for another half an hour.
Harry tries to convince the Minister(ew) of his innocence. Obviously he’s just a good bean but oh no he can’t keep saying Voldemort’s back cause Mr. Lime Green Bowler Hat says that’s a no no
He had spaced out for a little bit and came to to Hermione begging him, once again, to lead the group. By this point they were in the common room and she was looking at him with that look that told him she would just keep doing this till he said yes. So he finally, reluctantly, said “Fine. I’ll do it. But your running everything ok?” Hermione’s face lit up in excitement. “Alright! Thank you so so so so much Harry!!”
It was the usual latter half of the summer vacation for him. Hanging out with Ron and Hermione, catching up on homework, and Ms Weasley giving him third helpings at every meal. It was so normal he almost forgot about the trial. That is until Mr Weasley reminded him the night before.
