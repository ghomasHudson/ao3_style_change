I think to myself.
So, I take her seriously and think about the choice she laid before me. Going to Hogwarts or living, just the three of us, in Grimmauld Place?
“I can’t do that.” Yeah, great point, Draco. Such a clever answer. No political career for me.
Sorry it took me so long to write this chapter! With everything that's happening with the Covid-19 I just didn't have the heart to write. But, well, I'm stuck in Australia and I can't go back to France (they're in lock down) so I've got lots of time on my hands and I tried to write.
“Er… no cause for alarm, really. My colleague can be a little… straightforward sometimes. Why don’t we take you up on your kind offer, Mrs. Malfoy, and have a seat? I could do with a cuppa.” Said the man, sending warning looks to his colleague, his brows furrowed. The witch just rolled her eyes and sat on a blue settee, her arms crossed. Her colleague joined her and started pouring tea in the delicate china cups placed on the tea tray.
Accordingly, I spent my summer in a calming daily routine. Nothing fancy. I tried to expunge from the manor all traces of the war. My mandatory muggle studies served me well ironically. Wandless and magic-restricted, I had to learn the muggle ways to go about my routine. I was so surprised to discover how clever were the Muggles! They can do so many things without magic! They’ve invented such a huge number of devices. I’m not comfortable using them since they all look like some kind of killing machines… but I’m sure they’re useful. I’m just flabbergasted at how I used to be oblivious before. I’m still not a fan of Muggles but I can see now that they’re a force to be reckoned with. I feel quite humbled.
I wanted to stay. Really. But after Fred’s death I just couldn’t get out of my head how much family was important. I
think we should let bygones be bygones. The war was awful for everybody involved. I think for Harry and you especially. You’ve got a lot in common, the both of you” and I could see the way Weasley’s eyes almost popped out of his head from the shock of hearing his girlfriend utter such nonsense. I would’ve laughed hysterically if my brain hadn’t simply given up and shut down for the foreseeable future. I just kept on listening to Granger’s speech without moving, wondering if I was having a weird dream. “You see, Draco, we’ve been on bad terms for all of our Hogwarts years, but after receiving your letter of apology, I –
Mostly.
“First,
“Shhh, ‘Mione. Everything’s okay. What did the prat say to upset you so much? Has he refused both options? We knew it was a possibility. You don’t have to cry, we still have other plans to get him out of his shell.” He whispers into my hair between soft kisses on my forehead.
“Don’t worry. Malfoy will still be himself. He just won’t be able to do permanent damage to Harry. For example, they can still fight verbally or physically, but if the fight goes too far, Malfoy will be pulled to stop it.”
I didn’t go back with Ginny though. We’re too different from the people we used to be now.
I posted the first chapter only yesterday and already a few readers have bookmarked it! Well thanks a lot to you. I didn't really think anyone would read it!
It was the same at school. The kids would make fun of me because I was an orphan. And the parents… The parents. They would watch me with pity and disgust. I guess I was a sight to behold in those days. So underweighted. So tiny. Drowning in those big clothes.
- . I can see Father regaining his bearings and trying to look placid. But I know I heard two sets of running feet and I cast him my famous smirk. He looks pained to have been caught in such an un-Malfoyish behaviour and starts to dust his robes to compose himself.
I start to calm down and can answer him between sobs.
I fall down on my knees, exhausted. On the hard, wooden floor. I can feel the cold sipping through my jeans. I don’t remember putting them on.
bad, thanks!
. It shouldn’t have happened. He shouldn’t have made me do it. He knew it. He looked sick after I spoke. “Don’t do this to me. You know I can’t do it.” I didn’t know if he could hear me for I couldn’t breathe, and the sounds that went out of my throat were softer than whispers. I could feel the tears gathering in my eyes from the agony that was flooding inside of me. But in the eerily silent office, Weasley must’ve heard me because he answered in a soft voice.
The nightmares…
Despair consumes me.

After the Horcruxes debacle and Fred’s loss, Ron has become an adult it seems. I’m going to miss his lightheartedness. But his wisdom is quite welcome right now.
Hermione has convinced Ron to go back. How did she do it I wonder. Well, now that they’re a couple, I’m sure I don’t want to know the details! Anyway, I guess if Ron agreed to it, it means he’s not ready to become an Auror. We haven’t talked about it yet, but I don’t want to be an Auror anymore and I think Ron is the same.
offended by that term!
“Oh, Draco, I’m so sorry! I didn’t know the spell would be so painful, the books I’ve read didn’t mention anything like that. How are you feeling now? We should get him to St Mungo’s! Can you stand?” Granger was crying whilst checking my forehead where I could feel blood leaking and reaching my eyes. I laid there, motionless, whilst she muttered a spell and my head was once again in its normal state: painless and blood inside it. But when she put her fingers on my throat, a small part of me took note that it was still sore.
I don’t understand myself. All those years trying to stay alive and always pushing on. And now I can’t do nor feel anything. I didn’t think I would survive. I shouldn’t have survived the war. I used to make all those plans for after the war, but deep inside I knew I wouldn’t be alive. It was all a front.
’s different. How can this be? If I really want to think about it, I would say I feel even
I kiss Ron quickly on the lips. I have things to plan and the Headmistress to floo.
I was just too far gone to attempt to change. I had to keep my family alive. And even though I regret so many of my actions and inactions during the war, I just know that I would do it all over again to protect my mother.
was their best shot?
Everyone mostly left me alone. I think they assumed I just needed a little time to myself to rest and grieve in peace.
I will fucking kill them all.
I heard a scratching noise and a big hand landed on my arm, keeping me from walking, in my trembling state.
I feel like crying all the time but on the other hand I’m just not able to. I gather it’s for the best since I’m not sure I would be able to stop crying anyway.
It downs on me then, how much I worry her. And Ron, I guess. For her to be that angry and call me on my “bullshit” as she says.
Such a tiny difference. A tiny difference that tore my world apart. It was a hard, harrowing lesson learnt. Learnt at wand point when my own father cast the
“I see your point, Draco. I’m sorry you have to shoulder the responsibility of straightening our name. Circe knows you’ve been through enough hardships already.” She squeezes my hand a little too hard for me to be comfortable. For a flitting moment, she looks distant, lost in her thoughts. But then, her gaze sharpens, and she looks at me sadly. “And you will face so many more hardships in your future because of us. I’m so sorry, my sweet baby. I’m so very sorry.” She’s caressing my cheek so lovingly, now. A few stray tears are rolling down her face. I feel so loved it’s crushing me. My throat starts to close, and my eyes burn. Who knew love could make it so hard to breathe? “I want you to know that, no matter what happens, no matter your choices, I’m proud of you. Your father and I are so proud of you, my son. You are our greatest joy and the best thing we’ve ever made. It is going to be hard for you, at Hogwarts, but know that you are not alone and that we will support you no matter what.” She tenderly strokes my cheek a last time with her thumb before composing herself. She takes a white tissue out of her robes and delicately dabs at her eyes. I find myself so shaken that I feel an urge to go to my rooms and be alone.
I could see the shock on my parents’ faces, the anger and the worry. So much worry. I could see through the tears that they were overwhelmed. They didn’t know what to do. What to think, I’m sure, given all the emotions that passed through their faces.
Can’t feel a thing.
Anything to keep me from sleeping. Well, anything to keep me from the nightmares.
I decided to apparate outside the Manor grounds. I needed some time to get out of my mind and absorb what had happened, and I couldn’t face my parents quite yet. I found an isolated spot under a tree and sat. I closed my eyes, started taking deep breaths and forced myself to feel again. It was an ordeal. Each new time was worse than the previous one. It would have been so easy to just stay forever in this state. Nothing to upset me. It was like floating, everything flowing around me without sticking. It was so hard to make myself go back to reality. But I forced myself to think of my mother, and I knew I couldn’t do that to her. She deserved a son and not the shadow of one. So, I let the sun warm my skin. I let the smell of flowers, grass and dirt fill my nostrils. I let the birds’ songs reach my ears. I let the metallic taste of blood permeate my mouth. And, as I opened my eyes and took the peaceful view in, I let myself
for them.
I try imagining us being roommates in time of peace. Hermione and Ron. An item at last. And I can’t do that to them. Being stuck with me in this dark house, with my dark mind and my dark thoughts.
Well I’ve been there for a week and I haven’t gotten out of bed since. I just keep lying in bed wondering where everything went wrong. I sleep half an hour there and then.
to find my parents and try everything I could to give them their memories back.
“There, there, Fang. Let it go.” Replied Brownon, patting her hand a few times. It seemed to me that the argument wasn’t new.
I even testified in some trials. I didn’t go there since I was so busy. The trials took place really early: beginning of June. I think the wizengamot would’ve put the trials immediately after the war if it weren’t for all the funerals. Seems to me they were really eager to wash their hands off of the trials.
Looking at my parents warily, I gave them a little nod. We then all took place around the tea table. My father in the armchair presiding the table and my mother and I in the settee opposite the Aurors.
Hermione has had a hand in this. Maybe she threatened him or something. She’d better not try it with me!
In mid-August, I flooed Ron and his family. They seemed to be faring better. I could still sense their grief, but it wasn’t controlling them anymore.
Those big clothes so handy to hide how cadaverous I was.
His green eyes are extinct now. There’s no more fire in them. No more life. I can feel the tears building in my eyes.
But I knew I had to, if I didn’t want others to see how bad I was. It wouldn’t do to lose too much weight. So I ate what Kreacher cooked but nothing tasted good.
, Mr. Malfoy, and not from any magical abilities you may or may not possess, so do not worry about such details. Everything will shortly be explained to you in more details by Miss Granger and Mr. Weasley here. Let me insist on one point, though. We are faced with a highly sensitive matter pertaining to the private life of one famous wizard to whom we are all indebted. Everything said in this room, and anything regarding this subject later on, must stay between the four of us, as well as Headmistress McGonagall and Madam Pomfrey who have both been appraised of the details.” That sent my thoughts to overdrive. McGonagall? Pomfrey? What did they have to do with anything? I had guessed that this
“We have to move on, Ron. Everyone changed with the war. If we keep holding grudges, we can’t move on. We’ll only be stuck in the past. It’s time to focus on the future now. That’s why we fought. To have a future. I’m not asking you to

she would ask an ex-Death Eater to her school. After everything I’ve done! What a joke. The war must’ve messed with her brains. She even wrote that special courses would be allotted since I can’t do magic. She thought of everything, the fool. She was most insistent I return to Hogwarts. I only bothered to reply because I had so much time on my hands.
Here is the second chapter. Don't hesitate to comment if anything doesn't make sense!
I survived.
“But Harry will never call on his life debts.” I say, disheartened.
“Yeah, mate, we should all go back to Hogwarts for our last year. It will be nice to see everyone again. And we must pass our NEWTs even if the ministry offered us jobs. It’s not fair to have a job only because we’re famous now”.
“I’m not sure Harry will like that…” Ron interrupts my thoughts, uncertain.
My current nightmares follow me when I’m awake now. They’re never too far away now. They follow me everywhere. I’m never safe from them. It feels like I have fucking
Disgust in their eyes. Disgust on their faces. Disgust in their words.
Nothing feels good anymore.
I spent July and the first half of August in England with my parents. I owled Ron and Harry every week. And I could read how they were doing as Ron answered more and more and Harry less and less.

I cast a quick
don’t care! There!
“Harry, I love you, and I will do anything in my power to help you. Even if it costs me my NEWTs. And do stop lying to me, please. It’s disrespectful. You can tell the whole world you’re
With all these galleons and this enormous manor to refurbish, it only took us a few days to find out what we would be doing as a house-arrested family. It seems like a long time to make such an obvious decision but when we first came back to Malfoy Manor, the reality hadn’t quite caught up with us yet. We were somewhat frazzled. It seemed to me like we were three ghosts haunting the hallways. Fortuitously, the Ministry had left two old house elves who had refused to leave the Manor, because we would’ve starved to death without them, and then, we really would’ve been haunting the manor!
At least, at Hogwarts, they’ll be able to see other people when it will be too much to stay with me. Because it
Malfoy. I’m just asking you to considerate him as… a tool, shall I say, if it makes you feel better? A tool to help Harry get better.” The word “tool” tastes like ashes in my mouth. I feel bad to consider anyone as a
“Just… just come back and take your seat. We didn’t want to make light of the past; we went about it poorly. But it’s true we need your help. Just hear us out, please.” I let him lead me back to my chair while I kept my eyes fixed on the floor.
My throat is always tightening like I’m going to cry but it just keeps me from breathing fully.
And whose fault is that?
Hum. I don’t say that to Hermione of course. I might have a death wish but I want to die quickly and not painfully.
I stand up from my spot on the floor and cross my sitting room towards the full-length mirror in the opposite corner of the room. As I look at my reflection, my eyes are automatically directed at my neck.
Most undignified indeed.
Thinking of it, I should think about Hogwarts. Hogwarts Express or Floo? Floo. There’s no point thinking about it, I can’t see myself stuck in a train full of animosity for hours. When should I go back? The train arrives early evening, but I guess it would be good for me to go earlier and have a talk with the Headmistress. Maybe see if Pomfrey has some additional knowledge about the bond. I’ll go to Hogwarts after lunch, then.
He had a puzzled look when he asked “Aren’t you going to open it? I thought you would have been overjoyed to have it back.”
I heard my father take a sharp breath and felt my mother straightening her spine rigidly, still holding my arm in hers, whilst alarms rang in my head. Come with them? What did I do that I had to be escorted by two Aurors?
And I’m so
And suddenly it hit me like a wave. Potter was depressed.

“Well, I guess I don’t really have a choice in following you to the Ministry.” I said, raising from my seat. “Since it seems quite urgent, let’s not let the good Minister wait.” The two Auror were already setting their cups on the table and raising. I turned to my parents.
I didn’t feel like washing myself.
Everyone was starting to worry about Harry by this time. I had to send him a howler for him to open his Floo connection. Well it did the trick, so I don’t feel bad about it. Harry flooed the Burrow afterwards so that’s my win.
“Well, in that case” I answer, hope returning and making my heart beat faster, “I think we’ve found the perfect wizard to help us in our endeavor. Harry won’t know what hit him. He’ll be quite angry. And it’s always better to be angry than on Death’s doors.”
I turn my head. I see his red hair. His tired blue eyes. The bags under them, telling me he doesn’t sleep well. His freckled face. And I burst into tears.
“N-No, Ron. Actually Har-Harry agreed on going back to H-Hogwarts.”
Chapter 1
Anyway there they were, all these adults. Happy to help! There
I’VE BEEN MARKED!!!
“I said I can’t do that, Granger. I can’t make nice with Weasley and you. We weren’t on ‘bad terms’ at Hogwarts: we were enemies. I made your lives miserable. I tried to kill your boyfriend. You were tortured in front of me and I didn’t do a thing to stop it. How can you do as if nothing happened? I deserve every hateful glance or hex thrown my way and more, for the choices I’ve made. Because, do not fool yourself, those were choices that I made. I could’ve gone to D-Dumbledore for help and I
“Don’t. Please.” I whispered. I begged. I didn’t think it would be different from begging the Dark Lord, but I was wrong. So. Wrong.  Begging Weasley was
“I hear you, Hermione. I’ll go to Hogwarts if it makes you feel better.”
“I, Ronald Bilius Weasley, friend and soul brother of Harry James Potter, on behalf of Harry James Potter, invoke the life debt owed by Draco Lucius Malfoy. As of now, Draco Lucius Malfoy will spend his life saving Harry James Potter from harm until his life debt is repaid, or until he loses his life in trying. Draco Lucius Malfoy cannot take his own life or go willingly into dangerous situations when not commanded by the life debt. If Draco Lucius Malfoy fails to do his duty, he will suffer pain proportional to the seriousness of the harm inflicted on Harry James Potter. If Harry James Potter is to die from any circumstance before the life debt is repaid, Draco Lucius Malfoy is to follow him in death. A life for a life.
“Wait, please, Malfoy” and Weasley’s voice sounded almost pleading, only a murmur close to my head that only I could hear. And it stopped me as surely as if he had stupefied me. Because why would a Weasley beg a Malfoy?
? Couldn’t he stay
brave.

Not thinking about it.
“Scared? Scared?! I am most definitely
I’m starting to swear now. Brilliant. Only the Golden Trio can make me devolve myself to a peasant level.

I don’t feel anything now. I’m just an empty body. A waste of space as would say the Dursleys.
from you, and we know it’s deeper than that. So, save us the time: stop lying to us. We can see through your bullshit.” Her cheeks are red as she swears. But they’re red from anger and not from shame.
“Hogwarts?! You want me to go back to Hogwarts?! I refuse, Granger! I can’t do it. I’m not going back there. Ever.” I was starting to panic. I couldn’t go back to Hogwarts. Too many bad memories there. “Anyway, it’s impossible. The Headmistress may have extended an invitation for me to go back, but I can assure you nobody else wants to be near me. Parents would be furious to have their children in the same school as a Death Eater! And the students… Well I don’t even want to think of their reaction.”

, would say my father when I was a kid. Hence, I act as if nothing can bother me. It works a little. At least it keeps the panic at bay.
As for my mother, she’s never been shy in showing me how much she loves me. She doesn’t say it often, but her actions are proof enough. I have always known I am my mother’s first priority. She might have seemed cold from an outsider point of view, and she might not have had a lot of time to spare for me when I was little, when she was busy with all sorts of engagements; but she always took time to spend some quality time with me every day, no matter how occupied or tired she was.
? Nearly dead and stuck at Hogwarts’s infirmary with Pomfrey? Was that why they were in on the secret? But why would they need me? I was driving myself crazy, slowly dying of dread on my chair, when Granger, who must have guessed where my thoughts where going, started to talk.
“Do you have any idea why Aurors would want to see you, dear?” asked my mother softly.
Finally, I break down.
I was there to clean and to have a semblance of life in this house when nobody could move. I was
When I heard he went to Grimmauld Place to restore it, I thought it was a good idea. It wasn’t healthy to busy himself as he did after the war. I thought having some time to himself would help him grieve in peace.
Each morning, I would wake up. And I would feel desperate.
Again.
Shackelbolt was serenely seated at his desk, looking pleased. There was no trace of urgency that I could sense. What was happening? Then I heard the sound of chairs scraping floor and I turned my eyes toward the sound.
I used to hate him so much when the Dark Lord was in our house. I still don’t understand how he could have put his family in danger the way he did. He used to tell me that family is everything. Family comes first. And I believed him faithfully. But now I know. I know.
when I’m awake. Sometimes I can even see myself dying in an accident or by my own hand. That’s how bad it is. I’m cooking and suddenly I see myself opening my wrist with a kitchen knife. And worst of all, it feels good. It feels
“Listen, Harry. We all can see you’re not well. You need help. I think you should see a mindhealer -”
“Just listen to me, Draco.” I cringed when she kept using my first name. “Harry is mentally unwell. Only a mindhealer would be of any help, and he refuses to go see one. We can’t force him to go until he becomes a threat for others or himself. As of now, he is shut down in his house on his own. We tried talking to him, but we can’t get through to him. I think he’s seriously depressed. He needs help to get a grip on his life. He keeps rejecting us, so we had to think of a different way to help him. That’s when you entered the equation. I think Harry needs someone to make him feel things, to keep him grounded in the present. And, during all those years, you were the only one who could rile him up without a word. You’re our best shot to make Harry react to his surroundings. We’re really worried about him, Draco.” Granger finished, tears in her eyes. I didn’t know what to say to that. I was quite shocked, I guess.
of September. I’ll buy the supplies and everything, don’t worry. Now go rest. I can see our conversation tired you out. I’ll see you then.” With a little smile that reaches her eyes, she cuts out the Floo.
Only this morning, my life was… predictable. A little bleak maybe. But bleak is good. Bleak is
“Well, I’m sure he won’t, but we have to keep an eye on him. We shouldn’t have left him on his own for the most part of a month! What kind of friends are we? We’ve basically left our best friend waste away without doing anything. After all he’s done for us! Merlin, I feel so selfish! Here I was, enjoying my parents, when Harry was letting himself die…”
Useless to say we were quite distraught, in our separate cells. It gave me time to think. I had already gathered that I didn’t adhere in the Dark Lord’s beliefs anymore. And all this thinking just comforted me in my way. I was so sure, then, that I would be granted the Kiss. I was just hoping the Wizengamot would spare my mother since she never was a Death Eater. But there was no doubt in my mind that my father and I would either be sent to Azkaban to suffer or Kissed on the spot.
They assumed wrong.
Chapter 2
Before I start feeling selfish again and decide to tell her to shove her choice up her arse (not in these words. Never in these words.) I open my mouth and I speak slowly.
I’m worried about Harry.
She also wrote she wanted us to go back to Hogwarts for an eighth year. Shocking, I know.
“So, either you come to Hogwarts with Ron and myself, or we both come live at your place for the school year. Nobody will have their NEWTs, or everybody will pass them. It’s up to you, Harry.” She announces calmly. As if she doesn’t mind not passing her NEWTs.
I was so naïve then. Those nightmares have nothing on the ones I have now! Those nightmares were dreams compared to what I see now.
I think I might be depressed.
He stops in his tracks for a brief moment and then he’s all over me. His arms around my waist. His face on my head. Squishing me into him. I’m safe. Merlin, I love him.
“Hum… actually, and it pains me to say it, we can trust him.” Ron drops, looking as if he’s just sucked a lemon.
In no time I was ushered in front of the Minister’s doors and, without allowing me time to take a breath, Fang knocked on the door and opened it. It must’ve been quite the urgency if we didn’t even have to wait for an answer from the bloody
I take a few deep breaths. Inhale through my mouth and exhale through my nose. I feel a little more settled.
“What do you mean “he’s not well”, Granger? Just bring him to St Mungo’s. I’m no healer, I don’t see how I could be of any help.” I answered, rolling my eyes. Were they stupid? How could I help with Potter’s wellbeing? I couldn’t believe they had interrupted my breakfast for such a reason.
Always so dirty.
The wards must have warned them of my return because as soon as I appear in the entrance hall, I can hear them running towards me. Really, if I was wondering before if they had changed, the fact they are
I didn’t see it coming. I mean, of course I knew the war took a toll on Harry. But he always seemed to get it together, at one point or another, before. I guess I thought he was used to it. Now I know it was stupid of me.
There’s a tattoo. Black-inked, thin tree branches fully encircle my neck, delicately intertwined with black bramble vines. Spots of colours catch my eyes, and I can see soft red, exquisite poppy flowers interspersed with delicate, pastel yellow everlasting flowers. It looks like an exquisite, fragile necklace.
for a whole summer? Was it too much to ask of him?
brain-washed. I used to worship the ground beneath my father’s feet. I would’ve done anything for him to praise me. And I believed him. Without questions. It took Hogwarts for me to start thinking by myself. It took the Golden Trio constantly shoving in my face the groundless reasonings of my upbringing. After all, one can only be academically bested so many times by a muggle-born before grudgingly acknowledging muggle-borns aren’t so much beneath one’s self. And those red-haired blood-traitors. They should’ve been living in poverty and shame. Granted, they weren’t so rich, but each time I would lay my eyes on one of their freckled faces I could see how they enjoyed their deviant lives. They seemed to live much more fully than I ever did. I reckon, when you’re so content, your life choices might not have been so bad. Not so bad at all. I think I resented them a little, seeing their… liberty. Their straightforwardness. Their freedom to make friends with whomever they chose. The only choice I ever made before going to Hogwarts was my decision to be friends with the most celebrated Harry Potter. See how
“You would just have to make Harry angry at first, Draco. It should come pretty easily to you, I would think. The anger he would feel against you would anchor him in the present. What is essential, as of now, is to keep Harry from overthinking. Arguing with you would keep him from depressive thoughts and would be familiar to him. I’m sure a sense of normalcy would be good to him. That’s why I got him to go back to Hogwarts-“
It would’ve been good.

Maybe they were right all along about me.
repay it, be it by saving their creditor’s life or by spending their life trying to help them. But for it to work, one has to call on the life debt. That’s why Malfoy is not actively following Harry around currently. He helped us at the end of the war because he was in front of us and, I guess, he was in over his head with Voldemort and couldn’t caution his actions anymore.” Ron explains.
It always comes as a surprise to me, how much my attitude towards my father has changed in a year time. I still love him, that much will never change, no matter what he does. He will always be my father. But now, I also despise him. I feel so disappointed by him. I even pity him. And this is so foreign to me to feel such negative feelings towards him. I used to fear him. Fear disappointing him. Fear the punishments. But you fear someone when you acknowledge their superiority.
Chapter 3
if I stopped to rest, I wouldn’t be able to get out of bed anymore.
I take a deep breath to anchor me so that I can answer without breaking down once again.
My own anger vanishes, as if sucked out of me. I’m left bereft of the only emotion who really kept me going. I’m just tired now. So very tired. I don’t have the strength to fight anymore. There’s nothing left in me.
They want me to cry and express my feelings to heal together or some crap like that.
Well no, I’m lying. I shouldn’t lie to myself. I
My parents were so angry with me, I think. But they couldn’t do a thing about it because I couldn’t stop sobbing. They just kept murmuring sweet nothings and stroked my back and hair.
I shudder at the memory, cold invading my body even though it’s so hot outside.
So the trials. I sent a testimony for Malfoy and his mother. It seemed like the right thing to do since they both saved my life. And it kept me busy for a few nights, trying to decide what to say.
I love them but I don’t

- that was stupid, and happiness at seeing them safe and happy. Seeing that the obliviate charm didn’t damage them.
“You keep saying you need my help, but you still haven’t told me anything about what you want me to do.” I answered, avoiding the subject I had brought up in my outburst.
Well, it’s better to stay away from these kinds of thoughts.
Dinners were a fairly sordid affair at the beginning. My parents both looked haggard, it was as if they didn’t know what was happening, what to do. I can only assume I didn’t fare much better than them. I recall this feeling of… unreality. Everything had a sort of dream quality. It felt so… odd being out of the cells. Being out at all, really. I think we all assumed we should’ve been dead by now. And being free, well, mostly free, seemed like a dream or a miracle. It shouldn’t have happened. But it did happen, and it happened fast. One morning we were at the trials and the afternoon we were escorted to Malfoy Manor. I didn’t think I would ever see it again. This bloody manor. So, yeah, it took us a little time to adjust, for it to sink. Each night I would dread to go to sleep, thinking it was all a dream (and because of the nightmares; I shouldn’t lie to myself) and that I would wake up in my cell or, worse, in Azkaban. I believed, for a time, that my mind had just created an ideal alternative for me to live in, in order to escape the dementors. But every night the nightmares would come and, every morning, I would wake up in my own bed, and I would feel relieved to tears. I didn’t cry, mind you, but the feeling was there, nonetheless. Eventually, my parents and I started to relax, step by step, day by day. We started to talk to each other during dinners. The tension in our shoulders dissolving a little more each day. It was like a weight had been lifted from our shoulders. I don’t think I’ve ever seen my parents acting so… natural. It was as if the misery of the war had mellowed them. We didn’t talk much, but it was still good. It felt like a second chance had been handed to us and we finally started living. I could see the three of us were worn-out, but nothing could dampen this feeling of
Chapter 4
I thought I was used to it. I thought I was strong. I thought I had the will to survive. I thought I could continue as always. I thought I could do what I had to do. I thought I could help others get it together. I thought I could be a pillar to my friends in this time of need. I thought I could do the right thing. I thought. I thought I could.
“Oh, okay, Draco.” She said – disappointed? - . “Well, if you think of anything, you can ask me anytime. Ron and I will be at Hogwarts as well.” I nodded and she gave me a smile.
By the time I had calmed down, my parents were just happy to see me. We had a big talk the day after and they told me all they thought about me obliviating them, but I was too elated to really care.
I undress and leave all my clothes on the floor. I lie, naked, on my bed. My eyes are open, fixing the ceiling, even though they could be closed it’s so dark in the room.
Where they disgusted? Where they ashamed they didn’t do anything to help me?
But here I am.
I think I stood there, looking at them, mask all but forgotten, gobsmacked, probably opening and closing my mouth like a fish, for what seemed like long minutes but probably for only a few seconds. Granger was actually the one who put me out of my fishy misery by taking a step toward me and extending her hand. I took it without thinking, my upbringing kicking in.
I think.
Two Aurors, a man and a woman, stood stiffly in the parlour, both wearing their job’s red robes. The tea tray was left untouched on the ancient ebony coffee table. They both turned at the same time as we entered the room. The man was a little shorter than his colleague, slightly fat but still muscular. He had brown, short hair and warm, brown eyes. Laugh lines marked his face. He sported a little smile and looked faintly amused. The woman had Asian traits. She was taller than your average witch. Her lean body seemed to have too much energy and she couldn’t stay completely still, twitching either her hands, feet, shoulders or any part of her body. Her long, slick, black hair was attached in a ponytail. She had hard, brown almond eyes. Her mouth was pinched in a thin line. She looked unhappy.
“Masters.” the house elf nearly burst into tears, speaking in a squeaky voice. “There are Aurors at the door. They insist to seeing Master Draco!”
“I would’ve preferred to be chasing errant wizards but instead I’m stuck
Well, I didn’t feel like doing a lot of things.
“Thank you, Minister Shackelbolt.”
, I just couldn’t stand being in this room a second longer.
“Sorry, Malfoy, but you’re not leaving.” Weasley calmly stated without meeting my eyes. He was on his feet, probably to stop me if need be. “There is a reason you’re the only one we can ask for help. You see, you owe Harry a life debt.” I went rigidly stiff. Understanding crashed over me, making the blood recede from my face and cold seep through my body. Life debt. I never had a choice, then. I should’ve been used to it. I never really had a choice in my life before, and it seemed that the end of the war hadn’t changed that.
I reckoned I couldn’t keep on ignoring them. I had to tell them I was fine if I wanted them off my back.
“So, you mean to say that
. I think it comes from the fact that it’s such an ancient magic, and, I have to say, it’s truly fascinating!” She then launched into a very detailed speech about her findings and theories. She was engrossed in her thoughts. Her eyes were glinting from excitement, her hands moving frantically to help make her point and she was sporting a little smile. Weasley coughed in an attempt to get the attention of his girlfriend. When that didn’t work, he settled to lightly shake her shoulder whilst calling her name. That did the trick, and Granger was back on track once again. “Sorry, Draco. As you can see, I find the subject… intriguing.” I looked at her without blinking, not understanding why she was apologizing. She looked at me sheepishly but then, her expression morphed into… concern? Sadness? I didn’t care and, after a few seconds, she sighed and continued “Let’s move on. So, as I was saying, the bond is sentient, and it adapts itself to the specific needs of each indebted pair. We can’t predict what the effects will be on you. It might be that you’ll only feel a pull when you’re needed by Harry’s side but there’s a strong possibility that you will forcibly apparate where he is; I guess it depends on the situation. Sometimes the bond can even prevent the indebted from saying what he wants. I think that it could apply to you considering your… relationship with Harry. You’ll just have to see as it goes. There’s one thing consistent in all my readings, though, and that is that there is some kind of sign that appears on the indebted, marking the existence of the bond. I don’t know what this sign is because it seems to be different for each pair. It can be some kind of glow or aura around the indebted, a feeling or even a physical mark. It depends. This sign is only visible to the pair so that they always recognize each other even with the use of Polyjuice or glamour. At last, there is also the need for privacy. The bond asks for it to prevent anyone ill-intentioned to target the debtor, and thus causing him to fail in protecting his creditor. I think we covered all that I gathered. Do you have any questions?” She asked me hopefully. I had stocked all that she had said in a part of my brain for a later review; but at the moment I hadn’t really understood anything, so I had no question for her. I could feel that my body was exhausted though, and I interpreted it as a sign that I had to go home.
But I couldn’t.
This stops my thoughts about mindhealers. It stops my breathing as well. I think I stop moving.
Ron looks at me, still laughing, and slowly starting to turn green when it sinks in that I’m seriously considering housing Harry with a Slytherin.
“Hold your horses, ‘Mione! Harry’s not going to
“Hi, Malfoy! How’s it going?” asked
. I tried to
I’ve been
about
I’ve just ended my talk on the Floo with Harry. He’s so much worse than I thought. He’s even more unkempt than usual. He lost so much weight his clothes are hanging from him.
At least the war taught me something: Malfoys are great fighters with their words but not so much with their fists. We are not all-powerful. And I am definitely
I cried and cried from the relief at having my parents back. I’ve never cried more in my life than on this day.
“So, since you can’t be left alone, you have two choices. You can pick which one you prefer. And you can thank Ron for having a choice at all! If it were up to me, I would’ve been at your place weeks ago dragging you by your ear.” She’s ranting now. I’m starting to drift away.
I fell to my knees. I think I hit a rock because I had a bruise for days, but I didn’t feel a thing then. I cried harder and I could hear myself nearly shouting while I was crying. My parents just fell on the ground beside me and took me in their arms.
“Of course, Draco. You had an eventful morning. You should rest. We’ll see you later.” Mother says, picking up her fork to finish her entrée. Father looks thoughtfully in the distance and I don’t wait for him to speak. I step out of the dining room and nearly run up the stairs and the corridors to my suite.
And I, I enjoyed the holidays. Australia. No war there. No Voldemort. It’s a huge country and the people are always cheerful. I had a great time. I was just too selfish to think about the people at home. I wasn’t there for the funerals or the trials or the rebuilding of Hogwarts in July. It’s so unlike me. But I wasn’t really myself at the time.
So yeah, even though I don’t want to take a shower I still wash. This feeling of uncleanliness is even worse now, I guess. Sometimes I swear I can sense blood on my hands.
just confirms it. It’s so undignified and opposite everything they’ve taught me. It’s nice to see I’m not the only one struggling to keep the Malfoy mask!
But Hermione seems oblivious to what’s going on in my wrecked mind and she keeps going.
Deep breathes. The need to turn off the Floo and be left alone wins over the catatonic state my body was getting into. Then, I lift myself up and go back to my room. I knew I should’ve stayed in bed today.
But Harry Potter wouldn’t be himself if he didn’t have a hero complex and tried to save everyone and anyone. Even his enemies. Thanks to his testimony none of my family went to Azkaban. My father was put on house arrest, wandless, for the remainder of his life. My mother was put on house arrest for 5 years but permitted to use magic. And I was put on probation. Wandless and house arrest for 2 years. I had to take Muggle lessons, write apologies and report regularly to the ministry to consult a mindhealer who would inform the Wizengamot of my progress. They were really lenient with me. Mostly because they thought I was young enough to be saved. Young enough that I was considered brain-washed.
And I can feel my blood starting to boil from the anger always simmering in me these days. I tried to be nice to her since she’s obviously worrying about me. She doesn’t have to take her superior air with me as if I’m a child needed to be guided! I minimized my health status because I didn’t want her to worry! That was kindness from me! I didn’t
! Fucking savior in need of saving.
And I keep wondering if it was really worth it to come back from the dead.
“Calm down, Ron. First, I’m not sure of anything. I mean, I only know that if we want someone to make Harry react, the best person on earth would be Malfoy. Second, I didn’t forget anything. And as I recall, Malfoy was more of an ally than an enemy back in his manor. I have a lot of griefs with him, but not from that time! He’s changed, Ron. I could see that. There was no fight left in him by the end of the war. I’m sure living with Voldemort was punition enough for all he’s done to us. And I will remind you Harry’s the one who testified for him and kept him out of Azkaban! Anyway, I don’t know his whereabouts or what he’s become. I
“The beauty of it, ‘Mione, is that anyone can call on it as long as it’s in the best interest of the creditor.” Ron answer, smiling now, glee in his eyes. “After all, if the creditor had been abducted it wouldn’t do him any good not to be able to call on his debtor.”
In my defense I wasn’t in a good place myself after the war. And of the three of us, Ron seemed to have the hardest time. Harry seemed to cope with it however he could. And he took care of Ron and his family so well. That’s why I could leave and find my parents. Because I knew Harry was with them.
on me, following his Master’s orders, in a failed attempt to regain his favors. I’ll always wonder if he would’ve killed me if the Dark Lord had asked him to?
Many times in the previous year, I had been on the wrong end of a
“- but I know you.” Hermione continues, ignoring my coughing fit. “I know I can’t convince you. So, I’m going to pick my battles. Here is what I think: you can’t stay on your own this year. We left you alone for a month and you locked yourself up in this awful house you call home. Well no more, Harry James Potter!”
“Before you take your leave, Mr. Malfoy, I have something to give you.” Said the Minister, sliding a long box to the end of his desk. I reached out automatically and put away the box in my robes.
But no, I just
Again.
My body doesn’t work but my brain does. Well, mostly. It seems to have some difficulties giving orders to my body.
“Well, if you put it like that…” Ron looks thoughtful, digesting the notion. “I guess I can accept that. Using Malfoy to help Harry. The git owes Harry anyway.” As the idea grows on him, Ron looks more and more cheerful. My manipulation skills are on fire today! First, Harry’s coming to Hogwarts, and now Ron’s thinking about rooming Malfoy and Harry. All in a day’s work. I’m starting to be quite proud of myself!
I think anywhere I look, there are awful memories.
“You’re so stupid sometimes!” I retort, exasperated. But the more I think about it… “Well, actually, maybe you’re on to something. Maybe it’s not such a bad idea.” I say, excitedly.
When I received Headmistress McGonagall’s letter about opening an eighth year and inviting me to join, I laughed. I burned the letter afterwards. I can’t begin to fathom
“No buts. It won’t do any good to let the guilt take over. You’re the most brilliant witch I know, Hermione. If someone can help Harry, it’s you. Don’t feel bad about going to your parents. Nobody thinks you’re selfish. If Harry wanted company, he would’ve had it. Maybe the mood was too… dark here to be comfortable, but he could’ve gone to Andromeda to see his godson or gone to see Luna or anyone, really. He just didn’t want to see anyone, and he would’ve pushed us away if we had insisted on seeing him before now. What’s important is that we’re here for him now, and it’s not too late.” Ron finishes wisely.
But I owed it to the departed.
“You’re right. You’re right, Ron. I’m sorry. It’s just… the sight of him… it was too much. We need to check on him even though he will push us away. I feel he doesn’t want to see us. Maybe it would be good for him to be roommate with someone else at Hogwarts?” I ask, the idea just popping in my head. “The Headmistress told me she’s amenable to put Harry and you in the same room, so I might be able to persuade her to room him with someone of our choosing.”
for Merlin’s sake!
After the first week staying in my bed, I actually tried to do something with myself. I started by cleaning the whole house. I didn’t feel like going outside.
“I – Thank you, Mother, for your kind words. If you’ll excuse me, I’m going to retire to my rooms. I am quite tired.” She looks knowingly at me as I stand.
The war’s been over for a few months now. I think, back then, I already knew something was wrong with me. That’s why I didn’t stop to rest after killing Voldemort. I just kept going from funerals to testifying in trials to helping rebuild Hogwarts. Anything to keep me from thinking and/or collapsing and never get up.
and I had somewhat managed to escape in my mind whilst writhing on the floor in agony. It had helped with the excruciating pain of the Unforgivable and with the aftermath. I remember feeling so detached from my body. I acknowledged the physical pain, but it had felt far away. I used to live in some kind of dream – or, well, nightmare – lost in a secondary state. If I had known the binding ceremony was painful, I would have gone in the safe place in my mind beforehand. I would still have cried my eyes out, but at least I wouldn’t have been so focused on it. And I wouldn’t have been plagued with all those
I feel my blood receding from my cheeks at the memory of Malfoy Manor. I can still feel the word ‘mudblood” being carved in my skin forever. Carved in my memory forever.
must’ve been none other than the one and only Harry Potter, bane of my existence, but what was the Hogwarts staff doing in all this? Really, in what new catastrophe our Mighty Savior had found himself,
I feel so shameful to have those thoughts.
As I close the heavy wooden door, I am thankful to have permanent privacy wards embedded in the walls of my rooms. My breathing is short, and I fear a panic attack is imminent. But as I forcefully make myself take deep breathes, I slowly regain control of myself, and sit heavily on the floor, my back on the door. I don’t know what to make of my mother’s words. I have never doubted my parents’ love for me. Even my father’s love. I’ve always known he loves me, even if he’s always been more distant than my mother. Yes, I have never doubted my father loves me. It is just that he loves other things more. Like power.
“Yes, Mistress.” answered Diddy, bowing low and disapparating in a ‘pop’.
“Hi, Malfoy. Thanks for coming, I wasn’t sure you would.” She told me with the shadow of a smile, uncertain, but with a strong handshake.
“Mother, Father, it seems I must take my leave. I’ll see you later.” As my parents were raising from their seat as well, I could see they were still a little nervous about this “urgent matter”. But I couldn’t do anything to set them at ease, so I just opened the doors and followed the Aurors until we were out of the Manor grounds, where they side-apparated me.
thinking about collapsing. If I go back now, I know all I’ll be able to see are the corpses. All those lifeless bodies.
, supplied my mind. The Minister had said that I should be overjoyed so I raised my head, met his eyes, and produced the biggest smile I could “Thank you very much, sir.”
be too much to stay with me. They are already moving forward. They want it so badly. To let the past behind. To let the war behind. To start living.
I don’t fear him anymore.
That wouldn’t be so bad.
But I took a shower everyday nonetheless.
No one even tried to look at me at the Ministry. Not with two Aurors flanking my sides; one of them a witch looking like she wanted some action and wouldn’t mind a fight.
gets used to grieving and fighting.
, addicted to studies. I know she’s pulling my leg with that threat. And if she thinks she can manipulate me as she does Ron, she’s sorely mistaken!
“Well that’s great, love. I knew if anyone could get him out of Grimmauld Place it would be you! Why are you crying then?” he furrows his brows, obviously starting to worry.
So I exiled myself in Grimmauld Place saying I wanted to renovate the place.
“Well, Granger, Weasley, Minister Shackelbolt. It’s… flattering that you thought of me to help Potter, but I must decline. Any Slytherin would be up to the task of angering him so you really don’t need me specifically. May I recommend Blaise Zabini? He has a wicked tongue and I am sure he would be delighted to find out ways to rile up the Golden Boy. I will take my leave now-“
He drew his wand and pointed it towards me. I recoiled even though I knew there was nothing I could do to prevent what was going to happen. Granger was standing and looking at me with what felt like pity in her eyes. She mouthed ‘Sorry’ with trembling lips and I had to turn my head due to the onslaught of emotions that was filling me. It was all too much, too fast. My eyes landed on the Minister who had yet to utter a single word after his greeting. He looked completely relaxed in his chair, looking at us with interest and amusement. What was the point of his presence, I wondered. The man had been useless so far. When I heard Weasley take a breath, I faced him again without wanting to. He was standing rigidly as if his spine was made of steel. His eyes were hard from resolve and his mouth was set in a stern line. His wand arm was extended in my direction without trembling. He was a man; a boy no more. I couldn’t detach my gaze from him, a sick fascination had taken hold of me, urging me to watch the man who would change my future - my life - forever, in the eyes as he uttered the dreaded words.
. When I opened my eyes to the world, I was in this state of nothingness that I had come to know so well.
“Well who would be a good match amongst the 8 years? I know we’ll all be in the same quarters, all Houses mixed because not a lot of us will be returning.”
“It has to do that purebloods have few rules, but those rules are unbreakable. One of these rules is that if a pureblood has a life debt, he
I owled Hermione later. She was able to lift the charm she cast on her parents. She helped them move back to England and they’re living together now. I reckon they were really angry with her… but at least one of us got their family back.
Sixth year was the turning point for me. It wasn’t so great to be a pureblood anymore. What’s the point in being above everyone when you have an evil being as a master? When you’re too afraid to do anything? My own mighty father had become a fearful slave. Everything I had once stood for was only a big, huge pile of nothing.
“That’s it ‘Mione. If we call on the debts, Malfoy won’t be able to do anything to hurt Harry!”
I hope you'll enjoy this chapter and that it will make sense to you. I always fear my writing is weird.
It seems passing our NEWTs is, oh,
I haven’t cried for a long time now.
I made my exit on their goodbye greetings. I walked the Ministry corridors at a sedate pace completely oblivious to my surroundings, still in a dreamlike state. It would’ve been an ideal time to hex me but, fortunately, nobody tried, and I reached the apparition point unhindered.
“Malfoy, are you sure you don’t want to go to St Mungo’s? We can discuss later-“
Thanks a lot for all of who gave me kudos!!! I hope you'll enjoy this chapter as well :)
I squash that voice.
I’m actually just starting to fall apart and they don’t want to see it.
She wrote she would be back at the Burrow soon.
“Well, as you’ve understood, this has something to do with Harry… in short, he’s not well and we need you to help him get better.”
. I bear the
“Do not worry too much, Mother. The Minister hasn’t explicitly said it was punishment. I’m guessing there’s a little bit of that, but I also think it’s intended as a way for me to rehabilitate myself. I… am not too keen on going back to Hogwarts, but I can see that passing my N.E.W.T.S. will be an advantage in the long run. I have to start thinking on ways to bring back the Malfoy name out of the mud.” I look into Father’s eyes as I say that. I want to see if he’s ashamed. And he is. An outsider wouldn’t have caught the flickering emotion that crossed his face, but I do. And I feel ashamed, as well, to want to hurt him. To know how to hurt him and use it.
I don’t understand what’s just happened.
They’re still mourning and all, but they kind of pulled their shit together I guess.
And I don’t. And this is my problem in a nutshell. I’m stuck. Stuck in the past. Stuck in my thoughts. Stuck in my feelings. Stuck in my grief. Stuck in my pain.
“I’m fine, Granger.” I said automatically, in a monotone voice. I picked myself up from the floor, since she had asked me to get up - standing on shaking legs I noticed – and waited for someone to tell me what I had to do next.
afterwards. It was too late for the pain, but I still could do something to avoid dealing with the consequences of the binding so, deeply breathing, I let go of everything on each exhalation, every emotion, every physical awareness, every memory.
Just a few days before September, a house elf interrupted our breakfast, wrenching his hands in nervousness.
“But isn’t it contrary to what we want to do? We want someone to push Harry to his limits. Not a puppy following Harry around, protecting from everything!” this is maddening! I was sure we had found the perfect person to stay with Harry! Now we have to do it all again.
“What!” Harry cried “you know she would tell everyone!”
“What is it?” Harry asked, increasing the pace of his fist and squeezing Malfoy’s cock even more tightly. Malfoy’s breathing quickened rapidly, to a series of uneven gasps. Finally forcing out:
They had been in potions, paired together for the practical by Snape once again. Harry had gritted his teeth and tried to deal with it, he really had tried but Malfoy had a way of getting to him like no one else could, murmuring insults in Harry's ear right when Snape walked obliviously past. And so, of course Harry had lost control as usual and punched the git, and then Malfoy had punched him back and they both got kicked out of class.
“Hiding from someone are you?” A drawling voice from behind him broke him out of his own thoughts. His eyes darkened as he looked up to see the familiar pointy face looming over him, hands on the back of Harry’s chair. Harry shivered, fire filling his veins.
Harry’s eyes flashed as they swiftly narrowed to meet Draco’s steady gaze.
Eventually potions lesson rolled around and Harry couldn’t help glancing at Malfoy all through Snape’s instructions at the start of the lesson. Harry was back to being partnered with Ron again, after the disaster of yesterday but Harry wasn’t sure whether that was a blessing or a curse.
“Have you spoken to them since the -um- incident?”
“What are you doing up the early?” She purred.
But then Malfoy forced himself down Harry’s throat a finally time before violently pulling out a spilling his load all over Harry’s face, soaking the blindfold.
He rose noiselessly, not only so as to prevent disturbing the hushed slumber of his respectively less restlessly sleeping roommates, but also to leave the delicate stillness of the air and the inky darkness unbroken as he moved silently out of the room. Creeping through dusty corridors, the absence of the usually demanding, congested passages did not haunt him as it did so many others, but comforted him in a lonely caress and not once did he stumble or trip on shadows- he had roamed this ethereal world far too many times.
Harry inhaled sharply as Malfoy leaned closer to him, lips so close to his bare skin.
He glanced over at Harry, who was seemingly paying even less attention to the class than Draco, shoulders slumped, lazily doodling nonsensical patterns across his parchment. Fitting, Draco thought, that he should like to draw when he had painted Draco’s whole world in shimmering ink of green and gold. Harry had needed a villain, and Draco had presented himself. He had needed a side-kick and Weasley had instinctively volunteered. He had needed someone to save and one by one each role had been assigned, sketched in bold, permanent strokes until he had drawn a whole realm for himself; each of them orbiting him while he sat back and pretended he wasn’t God.
Finally he met Harry’s stare, eyes dark and amused and extremely arousing.
When evening finally rolled around, it was on the back of a storm. Harry took deep, steadying breaths as he paced up and down the corridor waiting for the door of the room of requirement to appear. When it did, he could barely contain himself and walked straight into the room.
“Doesn’t seem like nothing.”
“You haven’t been listening at all have you?” Ron frowned
“On your knees.”
Staring down at quivering fingers, Harry released a shaky sigh as he strode briskly back up the corridor. Pale strips of starlight filtered down through the high windows and he was glad for it, whitening the fading vivacity of too much emotion and he desperately thrust the black tendrils of fear and uncontrolled hysteria back down inside.
"No I think I'm good" he said swiftly striding away before she could say anymore.
“Draco...” he moaned pleadingly, barely able to withstand the fire burning through his very veins.
Maybe the truth was that, deep down, he didn’t really want to move on, Harry mused buttering a slice of toast. Because his and Malfoy’s bitter rivalry was the only thing that seemed to remain unchanged since the very beginning. Malfoy provoked him and he provoked back, each one of them retaliating again and again until never won fights in insults and hexes and combat seemed as second nature as breathing, irrevocably unalterable even if he owed Narcissa Malfoy his life and Draco himself owed Harry his. Though he would never admit it, Harry was surreptitiously glad that this had changed nothing between him and Malfoy; Malfoy was the only person remaining unfazed and altogether contemptuous of Harry’s reputation as the “chosen one”, which had only grown in stature after Voldemort’s death and returning to Hogwarts for the newly instated eighth year. He was the only one that didn’t seem to expect anything from Harry, the only one that regarded him with resentment rather than curiosity and thinly veiled awe. Somehow Malfoy’s still burning animosity (even if it was no longer full blown detestation) and cynicism felt like a breath of fresh air.
They say all Slytherins are hungry: for power, for wealth, even for wisdom, but Draco had forgotten what it felt like to be filled. The bell for the end of lesson sounded, but he remained seated, twirling his quill unthinkingly while other students rushed up around him, a motionless white feather in a passing storm. Hate is far simpler than love, he thought. But he’d always known that.
“Okay then” She said slowly “why were you tied up?”
So, I’m planning on continuing this for as long as people want more so make sure to comment if you want me to carry on! Thanks so much for reading <3
“We’re in the library” Malfoy whispered quietly “think you can be quiet?” He trailed his tongue across Harry’s skin, making him shudder in response.
“See ya later guys” He said, jumping up and practically sprinting from the room.
It took only a handful of minutes to reach the place, crumbled pillar and thorny bush indistinguishable even in the light of day yet strangely familiar beneath the sheen of moonlight and he was soon stumbling out into the frosty air. Sitting inert against a looming stone wall in the winter dusk, his eyes slid shut and he rose his face to the starless sky, letting the cold and the black bleach his troubled emotions into nothingness. He remained until his breath began to unfurl in visible, icy curls from his motionless lips. He remained until his fingers trembled, callous and blue. He remained until numbness had spread through his entire body and the frigid air had frozen tears never to fall from stony eyes. And still, he lingered, bricks of rock and boulder claiming any remaining warmth his frozen body had to offer as he at last unfolded his eyelids. He took in the moon glaring blue like a chip of polished ice and gazed into its distant solidarity. He understood the loneliness in its pale face and the somehow beautiful pain in its fading grasp on the dark sky, thick black slowly diminishing into shadowy blue.
Harry was shocked and motionless for a moment at the filthy act before smirking and casually licking strands of cum from around his lips. He heard Malfoy’s breathing increase once again.
Harry saw red and raised his fist to punch Malfoy right in his smug face but he ducked. Harry swung again but Malfoy dodged out of the way. Finally Harry grabbed him and shoved him up against the wall, his fingers slowly tightening around Malfoy's windpipe.
Harry basically spent the entire morning avoiding Hermione as much as he could which was difficult considering she had started tailing him everywhere, trying to talk to him alone probably to question him relentlessly. Luckily she hadn’t had a choice to do so yet with Ron always in ear shot.
"I don't know what you're talking about Potter."
“Why thank you” he smirked, releasing Draco and turning around to collect his ingredients. Malfoy was panting and watched him with wide, luminous eyes.
“What?” Hardy demanded.
“Morning, Harry” Ron smiled and Harry couldn’t help but smile back.
But then all consciousness was lost as Draco straddled Harry and positioned himself over Harry’s reddened shaft. Their eyes met for one earnest, burning moment before Malfoy lowered himself onto Harry’s cock and Harry almost came there and then, it was so
Malfoy smirked down at him and, although the submissive position was unfamiliar, Harry was practically trembling with arousal.
Harry suddenly stilled, making Malfoy whine in desperation.
Draco just smirked back at him
“Excuse me.” Harry said in mock politeness with an evil smirk as he pushed past Malfoy and back into the potions lab.
“Why don’t you help me out?” He murmured in Draco’s ear, pressing their bodies together as he did so.
Finally Malfoy started pumping Harry’s cock faster and he could barely hold on to a single thread of reason, each stroke making him gasp and driving him closer to the edge. Suddenly the bell sounded, signalling the start of afternoon lessons.
Severus Snape stood at the front of the common, just in front of the fireplace, with an emotionless expression on his face. “Now, I am unaware of what Miss. Farley went into detail about, but I am aware that each Prefect uses their own made speech and then enters the basic scripted speech the moment they enter the common room. First and foremost, once a Slytherin, always a Slytherin. As the third-year and above students may know, Professor Vector is a Slytherin, as she says, not was a Slytherin.”
“Hello there, Dudley,” said Lily with a smile and began to instantly dive back into a conversation that her sister was just nodding to. She turned to Harry minutes later and smiled at him. “You have your trunk right?”
Hermione dropped into a sofa in the Gryffindor common room. “Do you think he’ll be all right?” she asked, somewhat nervous about the whole ordeal.
“Fuck off.”
Perhaps it was the mention of ‘Salazar’ or the constant complaining, but something triggered and every Gryffindor in the turned and looked at the person whining about their common room. A lot of the students clad in Gryffindor colours and tensed, as if the Dark Lord himself was in their common room.
This professor must believe the rumours that Professor Snape is a vampire.
James rolled his eyes as he cast yet another spell. He was steadily running out of options, which was concerning. He knew that emotional magic was far more powerful than any other magic witnessed. A witch or wizard that was immensely happy or sad could do things no other could. Whether that thing was positive or negative, it all was subjective. One of his worst assignments was a sixteen-year-old witch that had lost her entire family in a freak accident, which had rendered her in a state that no one knew how to describe. She had been fine physically and sent to her empty home. He had gotten the call about seeing aggressive magic and collected his team of fellow recruits and went to investigate. He had seen the girl attempt to end her own life, but magic did what magic does and protected her – even from herself. It made the witch more determined and she ended up defeated his entire group without effort. A sixteen-year-old defeated five grown men in combat with ease.
“Hey don’t blame me Harry, blame Pansy she spread it around.” Harry started to burst out in laughter and Draco soon enough joined in.
“Slow down,” he said to his brother, pulling him onto the seat next to him, boxing him into the wall. He waved his mother over with a smile. “You know, you really should listen to our mother when she tells you to do something. You can’t be running off, not in Diagon Alley, especially because people might grab you from the street.”
“Excellent,” said Professor Lupin. “Neville’s already in there, looking at the Grindylow.”
He thought back to the cloak, something in his mind clicking into place. Every time he thought about doing research on the thing, he suspiciously forgot about it. He was beyond beginner level at anything related to the mind, being a natural Legilimens and an accomplished Occlumens, something so easily slipping by and forcing him to forget was concerning. However, he quickly realised that the cloak would be infinitely useful in the Tournament. An invisibility cloak that could not be summoned, damaged, or wore out was priceless.
Neville looked like he was going to reply when Ron came around the corner and spotted him. “Ah, Neville, there you are – what are you doing speaking to Potter?”
Madam Pince hovered for a moment. “You two are speaking loudly,” she said. “Please tone it down.”
“A Draugr,” said Atieno. “Before you ask, we have discussed them briefly, but they can shapeshift, much like a Boggart, and therefore you would have had no idea. In their native lands, they are known as Aptrganga. Shapeshift, immune to all forms of magic, become more powerful when magic is cast on them, emit a stench that rots your insides, and can control hundreds, if not thousands, of Inferi with very little thought. What their ‘pets’ see, they see. They gain abilities through their creations, too. It can speak English because it devoured someone who could speak it.”
“Tell me about it,” said Robin. “Too much legal work for very little profit, I say. After a few days it dies down and I can enjoy
“Please, call me Harry,” said Harry. “And I never implied you to be weak, but we stand no chance against a werewolf if we don’t work together. I do admit that I am saddened by the fact you haven’t heard of me.”
He always wondered how each descendant of Salazar Slytherin felt, at least those that had pet snakes. Many were afraid of snakes, despite being able to speak to them. That had led him to studying the Gaunt line, which was a family distressing subject to study, as the Gaunt line was once incredibly wealthy, talented, and well-known. These days, the Gaunt line was known for the insane rambling Parselmouths that didn’t know a lick of English. Bedding cousins and siblings was the downfall of that house. They believed that none besides themselves were worthy of the ability to speak to snakes.
Ron was on the fence about taking the piece of parchment. He respected Hermione and her secrets, but he was curious. “Try and get it out,” he said while searching in case Madam Pomfrey appeared. “I’ll let you know if she’s coming.”
“What Atieno is trying to say is that anything that wizards did was explained away somehow,” said Salazar. “What are you learning in History of Magic?”
“Alright.”
“Even Daniel wants you to eat,” said Lily, placing another spoonful of food into said boy’s mouth.
“You are,” said Salazar, folding his arms. “It would be Harry Potter, who, in case you have forgotten, is quite known to Dumbledore and the man is very, very suspicious and caution of Harry.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco frowned and watched his friend walk away towards the staircases that would take him to the library. He walked back into the common room and found Higgs muttering to himself in a corner, looking rather frightened. For a brief moment, he wondered what Harry had seen in the boy’s head for it to have such an outrageous effect on the two.
I argued until Dumbledore put a calming hand on my shoulder and suggested I come back later, but later was never acceptable. I did consider sneaking into the hospital wing to see you, but my ability to sneak has always been awful. Without my cloak, I doubt I would’ve been able to do much of anything in school. You have it, in case you forgot. I’d love to know what you’re doing with it, you know. I know you don’t have much reason to sneak, but the cloak is useful… more than it seems at first. Even a late night escapade to the library is something I’d love to hear about.
“Normally you cannot, hence why it’s called accidental magic and not just magic,” said Neville. “Most magic you do before coming to Hogwarts is called accidental magic as you have no control over it. Some people still do it into their late twenties when upset or angry. Gran made a cabinet explode when she read an article from Rita Skeeter.”
Narcissa sat down next to Harry, “start from the beginning, I won’t judge.”
The group laughed it off and eventually split up to meet their families.
,” hissed Nagini in annoyance. “
“I’m sorry, professor,” said Harry softly, a sheepish expression on his face. “I was on my way here fifteen minutes ago, actually it was about twenty, and I was stopped when a second-year had fallen over and needed assistance, so being the noble person I am, I took her to the hospital wing.”
“The conditions are perfect, it shouldn’t be hard.”
“Was that a threat, Potter?” yelled Wood, his face tinging a slight red as he huffed, trying to yell at the second-year. “I’ll show you, Potter!”
Harry opened the book and started to read various things, it wasn’t long before his attention slipped and he just sat there staring blankly at the book. He flipped up the cover and realized the book was for second years. “Draco, I am well beyond second year charms…”
“We’ll be practising the charm without wands,” said Professor Lupin, coughing. “After me, please…
“Is it really?” said Lily, curious. “I always thought that Veritaserum was a good thing because it caught criminals.”
“Shut up, Potter!” shouted Ron, his tone just as loud as before. “She cannot talk to us about it as she’s a girl.”
“That’s one way to interrupt a class so rudely, Mr. Longbottom,” said Professor Snape, sneering. “Fifteen points from Gryffindor. Sit down.”
“Nah,” said Draco. “Their uniforms are silk. He probably told them that it would be cold and to prepare for it. Judging by the looks of it, none of them has any sort of winter clothing.”
“Speech” | ‘Thoughts’ | ‘
“Not so much,” he said, speaking before anyone else could. “I’ve heard a few mutterings from different people in different places, but nothing that could say what’s going on. The Minister seemed quite excited when I spoke to him last…”
“Speech” | ‘Thoughts’ | ‘
“What?”
“That foul mouth needs cleaning, I can help with that!” Bellatrix cast a spell that stopped Harry from breathing, “there, now let’s watch and see how long it takes for you to pass out from suffocation.”
She listened to the rest of the longwinded speech that the healer gave her and nodded happily to each of it with her eyes trained on her son, who was now in view and she could see his chest slowly rising and falling on the bed.
Draco nodded happily, he wondered if Harry would teach him some minor spell creation and help him make his own spells, but he didn’t want to hold his friend back. “Maybe I can watch as you learn the required material?” he suggested and smiled once more when his friend gave a very slight nod.
Her musing was cut short when she blinked and glanced across the table, more so at her husband, who had a rather offended expression plastered over his face. ‘Only Harry can make James so upset,’ she thought as she swivelled her head to her son, instantly seeing the delighted smirk. ‘I missed something important. Damn it!’
“Tut, tut – hardly any of you remembered that my favourite colour is lilac. I say so in Year with a Yeti,” said Professor Lockhart, reading though the quizzes in front of the class. “And a few of you need to read Wanderings with Werewolves more carefully – I clearly state in chapter twelve that my ideal birthday gift would be harmony between all magic and non-magic peoples – though I wouldn’t say no to a large bottle of Ogden’s Old Firewhisky!”
“No!” said Ron, shaking his head towards Neville, who had narrowed his eyes in suspicion. “Well… I wasn’t supposed to be using Errol. You know he’s not really up to long journeys… but how else was I supposed to get your present to you, Nev?”
“And that’s all you say? ‘Good to see you in Gryffindor robes’ and I thought I was stuck up.” Salazar laughed.
“You got one gift, Harry –”
“Please, no, stop it,” whined Neville, his voice slightly hoarse. “Not my mu, please leave her be, please –”
“I guess,” said Harry with a silent sigh.
It seemed wrong that they loved to wait around on witches and wizards without wanting anything. He first assumed that they had been forced into it, which Mopsy claimed wasn’t true many years ago. Funnily enough, he wasn’t the only person to take an interest in house-elves and their past. The other was a distant relative to the Smith line.
Sirius sent Peter a curious glance and just nodded. “Yeah, I mean, the pay isn’t half bad though, we get half of what a Hit Wizard gets and we only need half the requirements.” He barked out a laugh and finished off the last bit of Firewhisky that he had, he slid the empty bottle forward and leant back on the chair slightly. “At least we didn’t have to do the training those guys did, I heard that they do like five years of training just for one part of the complete thing, by the time you get the job you’re like thirty and locked behind fifteen or so Unbreakable Vows.”
Harry sighed, feeling as if he was explaining something to Crabbe and Goyle. “Helga Hufflepuff first sought the creatures after noticing that they were cleaning dirt. No one knows where house-elves come from, nor their name prior to that. Rowena Ravenclaw had a theory that they were the lower-class elves and banished from another realm, but she dubbed that theory childish. Salazar assumed the same, except a little different. House-elves have more power than us, in every sense of the word. They’re much like goblins in the sense that they have a lot of raw power, just no way to direct it.”
“Avada Kedavra!” The thump of the body hitting the floor filled the halls, “Nagini, your dinner.”
A plan formed in Harry’s mind. It was one that he had glossed over quickly and that was for dissension to form in the enemy team and drive them apart during the match, which was happening now. Glancing up, he met Terence’s eye, who in turn met Marcus’ and another plan was set in motion.
“– and take them on like that,” said Harry, ignoring Draco’s interruption. “I can take on these four with ease. You can split off and take on the lone one and complete our task.”
He only just opened the book and of course fate, the cruel mistress, wouldn’t allow him a moment of solitude and allow him to read more than four words before he realised someone was sitting on the edge of his bed, their weight causing the bed to drop slightly. ‘Better not be Crabbe or Goyle,’ he thought, closing the book slowly. ‘I’ll burn these sheets if it is.’
“That’s an excellent offer, Severus,” said Lily happily. “He told me to apply for a job as a teacher for Charms when Flitwick retired.”
“It really is quite disgusting down here.”
“Yes.”
The two of them sat there and mocked each person that put their name in, making sure to speak loudly enough that their voice carried towards the person as they were about to slip their name in. It was shamelessly cruel, quite lowly, but it provided them with a small degree of amusement, especially when the people reacted and stormed towards the Goblet and nearly threw their slip of parchment into it.
“I haven’t had the time to check the potion you left me,” confessed Professor Snape, still walking as fast as he was before, in long strides. “I must admit, the colouring the potion is unique, much like the spell you used to break my wards.”
“No –”
, Headmaster?” said Hermione, her eyes alight with desire. “I’ve read about the spell, but I heard it’s very difficult to cast.”
happened. Someone, somewhere must hate him enough to make him enduring such stupidity.
“You act like I’ve slept all day,” said Harry, pulling out his robes for the day. “I’ll have you know that it’s not even seven yet.”
“While I was chasing to catch up, which took quite a while, I had a pretty odd thought,” said Hermione, beginning to walk alongside the group. “How are
“Well, in Slytherin, we work by a favour system. As long as the favour asked is valid and won’t cause any harm or social stigma to the person it’s acceptable and is used to pay off any debts that you have accumulated.”
“Mr, Potter,” he said silkily, “if I were to ask where this staircase was, would you be able to redirect me?”
“I wonder how venomous it really is!”
“Oh… Ariana… sorry… I am.” Dumbledore stood.
“Err, well, yes. Urgent call… unavoidable… got to go…” said Professor Lockhart as he rolled up a life-sized photograph of himself from the door.
“At least you can help protect his daughters,” said Harry. “A police officer like you? No one would dare lay a stray hand on them. Do you know that they’ve been over there plotting most of the night?”
“Stop apologizing and tell me why you ran away, was the kiss bad?”
“You’re telling me,” said Vasily. “It was bought it, up. When the person insisted we come here, we all questioned it as our tent is quite secure.”
Harry sat down at a desk and smirked at the woman who gave him black, pretty much just handing him the win as he could go off her first move and capitalize on it instantly.
The four of them whirled past everyone, almost in a display of royalty. The Malfoy’s had no issues with looking as revered and well-known when all the attention snapped to them. A few people greeted them and waved them inside without much thought. What startled Harry the most was that he received the same attention and it didn’t appear to be any different from the same attention Lucius, Narcissa, and Draco received.
“Bets?” repeated Draco. “Oh, they don’t matter now, not important.”
“What’s a board game?” asked Draco, he had finished dressing and was now standing next to Harry in his green Quidditch robes.
Theodore huffed and started to pick up Draco. “God he’s heavy, he looks so scrawny. Why is he so heavy?”
Harry sighed and cast the spell with ease. He made Pansy pick up her quill and right that she loved, adored, and wished to be just like Daphne Greengrass, which was so out of character that he was amazed she didn’t scream when she came too.
“No begging… no crying… nothing?” said the voice. “I could get used to this.”
He stepped into what he presumed was the second-year Gryffindor boys’ dormitory and pushed open the door, it opened with a gentle creak and he poked his invisible head into the room. He let out a long winded sigh and a breath of relief when he realized the room was empty. His eyes scanned the trunks located at the end of each bed and finally found Longbottom’s trunk, it took all but seven seconds to find, the large N.L on the top in gold lettering was a dead give-away. He walked up to the trunk and knelt in front of it, studying it cautiously, his hands tucked directly at his side. He forced everything from his mind and focused solely on Longbottom’s trunk.
“It was this diary… Riddle wrote it when he was sixteen,” muttered Neville, softly, speaking before anyone could start an argument with Harry about it.
“Draco, I need to pee.” Harry didn’t want to squirm or grab a hold of his groin, but his face paled and he looked like he was going to pass out.
“I’m Death,” said Death, rubbing his head. “You must pass by me to actually die.”
“What will change?” said Lily, leaning forwards. “I can’t imagine him being any different than he already is.”
“All of your injuries will heal perfectly,” said Madam Pomfrey. “All three of you looked to be worse for wear until you touched that liquid…”
,’ whispered Tom.
He saw Fleur Delacour stand off to the side, wearing a beautiful dress that looked like it was created with the finest of materials by the best designer known to man. He was somewhat jealous of that, knowing his own outfit was average in comparison. He smiled at the other champion, following her gaze towards his date, his smile soon becoming a devious smirk as something became evident in her eyes. He knew that she would be livid that his date was from Beauxbatons, but there was more. There was always more.
“He told me that if I got a decent grade on this, I’d be able to scrape through with a passing grade, and be able to take my N.E.W.T.s,” said Marcus, deflating slightly. “I regret not taking my studies serious as it’s come back to bite me on the –”
He watched with a slight smirk as none other than Ronald Weasley attempted to summon the broom, his face going a hint of red as he screamed at his broom. “What’s wrong, Weasley, can’t get it up?”
Harry slowly pulled out his wand, copied the wand movement from the drawing, and carefully pronounced the spell. He waited, confused, for something to happen. He clenched his teeth, about to admit failure, when the drawings on the shelf slowly began to shift into a new picture. He was about to groan when the picture appeared to be a small paragraph of words.
“What about?”
He flicked over the page, smiling at the knowledge on this page in the book. To some it was boring, but his mind was always a genius when it came to potions. Severus and his mum teaching him really did wonders for the brain in regards to certain subject. Of course it bought up the age old debate of how he was going to learn spells if he couldn’t speak.
Chapter 6 –
He made a small mental note to not look to the left at the petrified bodies in fear of laughing at the ghost, who was hanging in mid-air, the professors unable to get him to actually lay on the bed. He hardly cared about Mrs. Norris, who had her own special bed, Creeves or the ghost, but Justin was somewhat of a friend and it was rather irritating to see him petrified.
Ernie hissed like a cat who had its tail trodden on. He glared for a few seconds before slumping and letting out a defeated sigh.
“So?”
“Nothing too exciting,” said Atieno. “I wanted to talk about special talents and abilities that are considered to be quite rare or unique. Talents like your ability with Legilimency and Occlumency.”
“Well,” began Lily, slightly taken back by the suddenness of that question. “I strongly believe that werewolves deserve a place in society and get jobs and live normal lives, as the rest of us can. A rather close friend of my husbands – actually, he’s my friend to – is a werewolf, and we get on splendidly. The man is the most caring person you’d ever meet, so gentle.”
He blinked and lifted his head towards the sky, which may not even be a sky. He could be in a room or a cave and he would have no idea as he couldn’t see. That didn’t make any sense, though, because the voices hadn’t echoed like they would in a cave or a room. He was outside. He just had to be.
Harry glared and debated about dumping the bucket of popcorn onto Ernie’s head. He decided against it quite quickly as he really wanted to eat it.
,’ said Tom, chuckling.
“That would be devastating,” said Hermione, shifting slightly. “I’m quite glad no one has attempted it.”
Draco ignored the fact that they were pretty much near the start whereas everyone else would be finished by now. He couldn’t muster the strength to tell his friend that he really was looking like he was about to keel over and just give in, no matter how much that hurt him to admit. He looked away from Harry and studied the cave again, looking at anything that may prove useful.
Lily watched as her two sons slowly disappeared out of sight, Harry still making vague promises about the adventures they would have, despite looking quite silly speaking with such enthusiasm to a young child. She would have never imagined that her eldest son could be so quick to flip personalities from an impeccable young man that tried his hardest, despite failing, to be an adult into someone who wanted the very best for a young child.
“Yes,” laughed Lily. “Regardless, what plans do you have today?”
“Pansy, I can’t believe you – Pansy?”
“Quickly, Draco will be here soon.” Pansy stopped tapping her foot.
“The quicker we can do this, the quicker that we can go home and then you can play with your new wand and pet,” said Lily with a slight sigh. “Oh look, there’s Neville. You can get fitted with him. I’m going to sit with Augusta and save her from the reporters.”
school. She says that it has too much opulence and not enough history.”
“About what we’re going to do and how we’re going to do it,” said Pansy. “I’m not sure how you’re so calm! This is ridiculous –”
Most people were still behind the rumour that it was none other than Harry Potter that wrote on the wall and petrified Mrs. Norris. Somehow people learned that he was an Occlumens and could hide any particular thought, memory or action that he had done without anyone knowing any better and that had everyone on edge. The fact that he was now both an Occlumens and a Legilimens had everyone on edge, no one daring to meet his eyes.
Harry, Draco and Rosier all burst out in laughter. Draco cleared his throat and smirked. “Granger, if friends were gold you’d be poorer than Weasley, and that’s saying something,” he muttered behind her, flicking her bushy hair with his wand.
“yes dear,” said Lucius, eyeing his father carefully, making sure the man was actually somewhat sated that things were being done and he wouldn’t take it out on Draco or Harry. “Read your letters and then we’ll leave.”
,’ muttered Tom softly. ‘
Parseltongue was a truly fascinating language, allowing for flexibility not seen in many languages spoken by humans. He had this theory about it, knowing that no matter what he would come up with, it would be wrong. Salazar was frustratingly tight-lipped on how the language actually worked. He was almost positive that it was a mix of intelligence and intent. Much like humans, not all serpents were intelligent and lacked the ability to communicate effectively. He knew that Nagini only understood him due to intent – intent to make her understand – but that intent did not mean that she understood everything that needed to be understood. It left a lot of grey areas that really could not be colourised. After all, magic could only do so much, which left the rest to the intelligence of the snake.
“I couldn’t escape if I wanted to,” said Harry. “They have my wand at the front desk and using nonverbal magic, not that I can, wouldn’t get you far.”
Harry wrapped an arm around the boy as they went through the empty corridors. He listened as the boy sniffed and wiped at his eyes. He remained mostly silent, knowing that the boy needed to clear his chest and heart, not perk his ears and listen to someone else offering platitudes. The last thing he would want to hear is someone else trying to make their life seem worse, which is what humans tended to do.
was when I allowed her outside to hunt for those annoying mice in the hedges,” said Narcissa, turning a page. She had put a lot of extra emphasis on the gender of the snake. “You must remember that Harry’s snake takes offence when you call her a ‘he’ or an ‘it’. Lucius only did it once and didn’t do it again after the snake appeared to torment him until he got it right.”
Harry sat back, happy with being somewhat ignored by everyone in the room, even Granger quit giving him looks and focused her entire attention on Hagrid. He wondered how Longbottom could be so careless to just come out with the whole talk about the stone, what next, they’ll try and flatter the half-giant into giving them information?
Nott did the only thing he could think of: he summoned the rock behind Potter, which was easily dodged, as Potter knew it was there and pushed it into the path of the lightning spell.
“So, what do we do?”
,’ said Tom cheekily.
“We’re not offended,” said Neville quickly. “Just tell us what to do.”
“He looked flustered?” asked Professor McGonagall, confused.
“What were you two doing? Shouldn’t have taken five minutes to reach here,” Lucius drew out each word and looked at the two boys, one had slightly messed up hair and the other as pink as the rose bushes out the front.
Harry squinted. He knew the boy was lying and that it was swapped around. The boy would have found true friends and happiness in Ravenclaw and that Slytherin would protect him and offer him opportunities in life. Of course, Slytherins had this biased attitude towards each other and a Slytherin would hire another Slytherin over a Gryffindor, even if the latter had more qualifications, but that was not present during school and most Slytherins held grudges and simply hated each other.
“Just one,” sniffed Hermione, as if the flowers in the room were effecting her nose. “That does remind me though – Neville, Ron, we’ve got half an hour before lunch. We should be in the library.”
Peter nearly jumped sky-high when he heard Sirius’ question, he was still thinking about what was said, that the war would be over before Harry could walk properly, it was true, it would be. “Nah, I dunno, really… I enjoy being in the Order of the Phoenix and such, but Auror stuff ain’t my strength, not good at it, y’know how I was in school.”
“Now, now, Mr. Potter, I will bring it up at the next staff meeting,” said Dumbledore fondly, earning a smile from Neville. “I have heard from three different professors that a fight took place in the library and that two of you have two week bans from the library,” he said calmly, eyeing the Slytherin carefully. “I would like to know the full story as I’m rather sure the story has been twisted.”
“Yes, Hagrid,” replied Neville, holding his toad close to him.
“Yes,” said Atieno. “Now, let us have a little duel to demonstrate the points I have made and to see your progress. I will reverse any major damage with ease, so worry not about causing harm.”
“I’d consider that to be a part of the duelling exam, not Defence Against the Dark Arts,” muttered Harry. “And yes, I am. I’ve read upto material that’ll be taught in our fifth year. Nothing’ll surprise me about this exam.”
“No, she wouldn’t lead us to the wrong spot, it’s definitely still in the library,” said Hermione with a slight sigh. “We need to find that a book, I knew I should have checked it out before the holidays for some light reading.” She glanced once more and saw the book she needed sitting on the table in front of the boy. “There it is! Potter had it the entire time.”
“In short,” said Atieno with a flamboyant gesture of his hand. “There is no Muggle-Repelling Charm around the Chamber and if they broke into the Chamber, they would have an easy, undetected way into the school.”
He stood and picked up the book on various breeds of dragons, making sure to be as careful as possible with said book, from what Madam Pince had said it was the only one left in the school, so naturally, he made sure to treat it with the upmost care. He slipped it into his bag and strut from the Slytherin common room and made his way towards the library. He slipped past a couple of sixth years and continued his small journey towards the library, unaware that Draco had decided to follow him.
“Harry!” said James, covering his son’s mouth. “Don’t get me wrong, I’m all for you using this over your classmate, despite what your mother might say, even more so because Gerald Boot, the father of your classmate, tried to hit on
He had to be patient, though. He needed to know what Daphne Greengrass had on Draco and the Malfoy family before he struck. He couldn’t allow her to keep those memories, no matter what. This entire situation could have been over in a minute if she wasn’t wearing that stupid necklace. The Paranoia Curse would stop her meeting his eyes, or anyone’s eyes, and that was an issue. He could have just ripped the information from her head.
He jogged up the first set of stairs, wincing as each step made a loud and almost unbearable creaking sound. He knew that the stairs would be a fantastic warning should someone come up, which would give them time to either run or create some sort of defendable chokepoint. Of course, the stairs creaking also would have warned the boy they were trying to find and protect that someone was coming.
“HARRY!”
The chat was broken with they saw Draco flying towards the ground and saw his head smack firmly into the ground.
Harry didn’t wish to count Longbottom in that equation. He wasn’t sure how Longbottom could speak to snakes, but his ability wasn’t legit. “
Harry gently punched Draco, “my punches hurt Draco, and you can be such a bully!”
“– of course, that family is so poor that they would steal something as trivial as a Remembrall and attempt to sell it off as an ancient artefact from their household.”
Shaking his head, at least the mental equivalent, he pushed off the ground and hovered slightly, much like a young child learning to fly for the very first time. The tips of his shoes brushed against the soft grass of the Quidditch pitch, his eyes locking onto the various seats, light fixtures, and a flickering board that was attempting to display an advertisement.
“Pretty sure he was attacked,” said Rosier. “Even if it doesn’t make sense.”
“You fed them a potion?”
“I was experimenting,” lied Harry easily. “It could have easily blown up, but that’s why I brewed it at night –”
“We, err, forget,” muttered Crabbe, looking distressed.
He guessed that his feeling was that of power and feeling like he was at the pinnacle of the proverbial food chain of wizards.
“And neither will they,” said Harry, dropping his head to the ground to study his shoes. “The fact you acted like a rabid fan and caused them to look at me like I was your caretaker and you escaped from the Janus Thickey Ward.”
“I told him to stay and hide in our dormitory for today,” said Ernie, his chest puffed out slightly. “You see, I used to think that it was Potter petrifying students, but you two have caused me to rethink that.”
“In first place, we have Ravenclaw on three hundred and ten points.” The Ravenclaw Table cheered.
“Be quiet! Go and buy your ordinary, boring books,” said Draco. “I’ll be here watching these ones tear each other apart.”
That confused harry as he assumed they were done and he was just waiting to be dismissed.
Ron grunted and stood up; he pointed his wand at Harry. Ron was now panting, either the run got to him or the fact he couldn’t beat Harry was tiring him. Harry on the other hand was perfectly fine, well rested in fact.
“What?”
Harry sighed, watching as Draco sprinted away from the feather wall. He listened and heard the four Gryffindor students cast spells at his feather wall. It was a genius spell because each feather would absorb one spell before vanishing. It had many flaws, though, as Salazar had said when he had aided him in the making of the spell.
“Petrified?” whispered Madam Pomfrey.
“I guess they do see me as some kind of head figure,” said Asahi. “That comes with age, experience, and wisdom. I am simply their elder and they show me respect. I am not some hidden warrior that defeats evil, saves damsels. I have been open and honest with you from the very moment we spoke.”
Remus stood, “I was informed that I would be continuing in the teaching of Defence Against Dark Arts again this year, as such lessons will begin soon.” The Gryffindor house cheered loudly.
“The person we’re planning to prank has been
“Yes.” Crabbe said.
“We tried!” said Lily. “We tried, Harry, we really did. What I wanted to say couldn’t be said over a letter and I couldn’t floo. I asked Dumbledore if he’d allow you to floo home so that we could talk in person, but he said that it was impossible.”
“Shut up, prat, I meant on the train.”
“Must suck to be him,” he muttered, gently tapping Draco and Rosier on the arm. “All that fame and talent while in school. He’s not gonna get anything done this year. I mean, look at Weasley…”
“You will keep looking while I’m away, won’t you?” asked Hermione with a huff. “And send me an owl if you find anything.”
“How will he help if he cast the spell? Didn’t you say that it’d weaken him?”
“Seamus and a second year, I cannot remember his name.” Oliver went red, despite whispering the last few words, people heard.
“I was forced into the Slytherin common room today by Pansy, and when I was in there it bought back some memories.”
“Harry?” said James, walking past Dumbledore and the other Aurors. “What are you – oh my God, Remus!”
Harry ignored Tom and continued on his musing, keeping a close eye on Nott and how he spoke. Something was off and he would prove it by the end of the year. He had the memory to prove it if the boy did anything suspicious. The boy, just like Pansy, would be somewhat of a threat down the road with all the dirt they had on him.
“Makes sense,” said Harry. “Are you gonna enter or just sit it out?”
“Countless studies?” repeated Professor Snape with a hint of amusement. “You’re eleven, your adolescent couldn’t understand anything that you’ve read, especially about a theory as the one that you’re proposing now.”
“Gryffindor colours,” said Draco, saying what had flickered onto Harry’s mind. “Never thought that I’d see the day where more than seventy percent of the teaching staff were in Gryffindor.”
It wasn’t much longer after that when Marcus Flint groaned and was tossed across the platform. His spell had miscast, due to his anger and he hit himself with it and then Gemma simply followed up on his mistake and wrapped him with magical binds.
Harry slowly opened his eyes, which he instantly closed the moment a light pushed straight into them. He wasn’t happy with Death, the rude ejection the moment he finished the chapter did nothing for him. He had questions, a lot of them. Would he be able to speak now? Why was he even sick in the first place? Seeing Death instantly changed the conversation topic when that second one came up even in the slightest. He didn’t doubt the man would make him sick just to allow him to die naturally for the first time.
Harry woke up at six on the dot, unbothered by the sun that had somehow found its way into his room, despite the thick curtains. He wouldn’t have complained about an extra hour or two of sleep, not that he needed it, but today was the big day that they went back to Hogwarts and he could show off his new badge, which would make everyone respect him, as he would be the one making Slytherin win from now on.
, not
Lucius shook his head, “Malfoy stubbornness was my greatest pain in school also.”
Harry, who slowly edged through the group reached the front and broke the silence. “The Chamber of Secrets has been opened, enemies of the heir, beware.”
“Shut up, Potter,” shouted Ron, his voice travelled across the Great Hall, echoing off each wall as if it was a stray spell.
Hermione looked confused, but quickly masked it. “Fluffy?”
“Oh, look Harry,” said Lily, directing her son towards the left just after they had passed through the barrier. “Molly’s over there, which means that Ronald should be around here somewhere.”
“I don’t think Fudge expected them to sell so rapidly,” said James. “If you look at past attendance of the World Cup, it’s never been this attended by so many people, no matter how and when you look at it.”
Harry spun around and saw Pansy storming at him.
Hermione pursed her lips, “not really, last I heard they were trying to catch up their grades. Both are dangerously close to failing.”
Harry glanced around, curious about what he would do, already spotting quite a few glares, as if everyone already realised it was his fault. Maybe, in some sense, the entire Weasley family realised that only he could help as he was a guest and it seemed that Mrs Weasley had a bit of a soft spot for him.
David laughed, his hands clenched around his stomach as he sent the smaller child a grin. He threw down his notepad and biro, not bothering with it as it was moot now. “I really should get you home,” he said, finishing his cocoa. “You’d be safe here, no doubt, but your parents are probably worried.”
Harry glanced around, finally seeing the person who was speaking, he took a few small steps forwards. After all, if this was his own nightmare, this person couldn’t exactly hurt him.
“I will not have my mother parading around in some group to fight Voldemort!”
“Yes, dear.”
“That failed, of course,” said Theodore.
“So, essentially, you’re saying to not act like a Gryffindor.”
“Why wouldn’t you,” said Harry instantly, not phrasing it as a question. “I personally have such a high ambition to be greater than everyone else, to prove that I’m not just a regular person and that I can do anything I want and do it better than anyone else. I want people to respect what I say, to treat me with the respect I deserve. I don’t want to be ignored and cast off to the side as if I were some reject. If I have intelligence, which means I’ll have power, people won’t question what I say.”
The trio fell into an off-topic chatter about everyday things. They made sure to keep a close eye on Longbottom and his posse, making sure that he didn’t slip out of the Great Hall without them noticing.
Before he left, he quickly added that he had a pet snake that would become upset if he was gone too long. He felt no regret throwing Nagini into firing line, knowing that no one could ever question her about it. She was a very dismissive yet clingy snake, which would be obvious to anyone looking. She hated being left out of things.
“You’re a Parselmouth?” she blurted out when she landed. “You – you! You can’t be a Parselmouth! You’re a half-blood…”
He sat down, quite slowly, onto a bench, which looked like someone had dragged the trunk of a tree across the pitch and dropped it wherever the person carrying it got tired. He studied the men, who looked quite a bit older than Vasily and the man he met earlier, which surprised him. However, all of them mostly had their heads bowed or were facing away from him, obscuring their faces. He turned his head, studying Vasily as he dropped onto the log next to him, speaking another language, which caused the other men to perk up.
Draco snorted, “we are essentially giants compared to Harry, he hasn’t yet had his growth spurt.”
Harry responded with a rude remark and let out a long sigh. He left the common room alongside Draco, who seemed unbothered by the remark, and walked through the dungeons, intent on avoiding all the other students who were trying to hype themselves up or summon the courage to slip their name into the Goblet.
“The truce and unity will fail the moment someone is chosen,” said Harry. “If it’s not a Gryffindor, they will riot. If it’s a Slytherin, they’ll burn the school down.”
Neville, Ron and Hermione, who had just joined them after hunting down Professor Snape and asking him something about potions, followed Hagrid through the corridors and towards Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas decorations.
“Desperation,” corrected Atieno. “He has been lurking around the school ever since, looking for a way in. He, like every other person alive, believes the Philosopher’s Stone to be destroyed. He attempted to get in last year when the Chamber was opened but was warded off by the headmaster, who looked highly furious that he had come back so soon.”
“Do you not desire to eat breakfast?” said Molly. “Do you not wish to prepare for the day with Neville and Hermione beforehand? If you are not out of bed, showered, and ready for the day by six thirty, you will remain here and de-gnome the garden!”
“I am, not that it would be hard, I know Seamus cannot fly, he tried in year one and failed miserably.”
“Yeah, right,” said Pansy, sniffing. “I’ll have you know that this is a very com – what the hell?”
Harry chuckled and threw the letter down on his desk, “I’ll be flashy if I want Severus, let’s see you try and stop me.”
“That’s what we thought,” said Lily. “All Aurors were called in to investigate it. The Minister is furious.”
“Excellent, ten points to Slytherin,” said Professor Snape. “I have one more question, if you wouldn’t mind answering it? Of course you wouldn’t. How do you tell if an Antidote to Common Poisons has been brewed incorrectly?”
Lily nodded sadly, she had heard about the struggled that Lucius was having. She offered silent support to her friend and took a sip of her tea, hoping for any more news on the matter.
Each idea had too many pros and cons to list without someone noticing, so he decided to just aid them and get a cover story in place with that.
“Shut up, Weasley, I was defending myself from Voldemort! I wasn’t going to just stand there and allow him to attack me, unlike you.”
“I think I’ve found something.”
“None of that applies to the process, though,” said Harry. “In fact, being a Quidditch Captain may hinder me because they don’t want to give one person every position.”
“Of course I care about you, you prat!” said Draco, glaring. “If you got petrified I have no idea what I would do! No doubt something stupid like trying to brew the potion to bring you back as soon as possible. I dislike you being in danger, you know that.”
“Hello Myrtle, hello Harry.” Draco smiled.
Harry fiddled with the letter in his hands, he really hoped Hedwig would have stayed he loved reading letters with her as she hooted when he fidgeted with them and demanded him to read them. Harry hoped no one would push the issue and that he could read it in his own time, but nope he just realized where he was and that it was impossible.
As he expected from the second he heard about it, he knew someone would aim to ruin it. He was very curious about who decided that making a duelling competition as safe and secure as possible was a good idea.
At least they assumed no one noticed.
“Merlin, Flint is such an idiot,” muttered Draco as they stepped inside. “What did he aim to prove with his stupid stunt?”
,” hissed the snake sarcastically, with a sound that sounded like a snort. “
Harry silently debated whether he should gatecrash the meeting between Lupin and Longbottom. He could say that he overheard and was on his way to the library to study some small things about the Grindylow. It was a perfect excuse to try and squeeze some things out of the man, who kept staring at him during lessons and meals.
Godric was probably stronger than Salazar, at least magically, but no Slytherin student would ever admit this, even though Salazar has admitted himself. Salazar simply held his own due to the sheer amount of obscure spells he knew and created.
“As you can see, I’ve added a second platform. Mr Longbottom, you’ll be using the left one, Mr Potter, the right,” he continued. “For those watching, you will not speak, you will not whisper, you will do nothing but watch. If any of you disrupt the class at all, you will be removed from the class permanently. Am I clear?”
“Stone…”
Lily pursed her lips, not like the fact that her son had said something about a brain aneurysm and compared it to either shock or disbelief. “Minerva has always been a rather fair teacher, even in my days she tended to help every house and not just her own.”
“Why they change it during Hallowe’en is beyond me,” said Harry, looking at the stretch of wall. “I don’t think you two know what it is either.”
Harry sighed. “It doesn’t make someone a Gryffindor because they have some red and gold decorations hanging about in their room,” he said, rolling his eyes. He pointed at one of the tables that was near the large window. “We’re sitting there as it’s the best place.”
“Silence!”
After what seemed like hours the Boggart emerged and twisted around, changing forms to torture the human in front of it.
“C’mon, follow me – any more firs’-years? Mind yer step, now! Firs’-years follow me!” called the voice once more, startling more than half of the first-year students who were slowly walking towards the man, traces of fear on their faces.
Professor Snape walked into the Charms classroom, his dark eyes narrowing at the students that were chatting idly about the next spells they would do. He wanted to sneer at the fact that none of them were listening to the professor as he was explaining something that would help the students in the future. “I am here to collect Mr. Potter,” he said as a girl almost screamed when he appeared behind her.
“It was,” said Albus. “The cost, however, is far more than creating a few golems or fortifying our position. We are best to sit here, pick the Inferi off one by one, and dwindle them down enough that I can signal to drop the dome and then we leave.”
“Oh no!”
“Are you gay Harry?”
“SILENCE!” shouted Dumbledore, his wand letting off two loud bangs after he spoke, silencing the Great Hall. “Everyone will please, not panic. Now, Prefects will lead their Houses back to their dormitories. Professors, will follow me to the dungeons.”
“I don’t want to grow old!” blurted out Harry and then recoiled as if something had betrayed him. “I only want to use it, to live forever and be immortal. There is so much I want to learn and improve on and I cannot do it in one simple lifetime.”
“You do it then, if you’re so clever!”
“My second-born was by far the most charismatic of the lot. He could – and would – talk the pants off anyone to get what he needed. He became a force in the royal scene and an advisor to some of the most prestige names known in the world.
“Of course, let me make preparations for your journey.”
“Luck, that’s all it was.” The hat snapped with an icy tone.
“When he told me that the Stone had sadly been destroyed in the battle that happened, he promised that he’d work something out and I trusted him, if the Stone was destroyed he would move mountains to help assist me, but the Stone wasn’t destroyed.” Nicolas gave a slight shrug, which caused the boy to laugh at the absurdity of it. “I have spent six hundred years with the Stone. There’s only one person that Albus assumed would want the Stone, and that’s You-Know-Who.”
“Is it possible to master all styles?”
He chuckled and decided to question it just a little bit. “So, the only rule is to not flee or act cowardly?”
Draco popped out of the cloak, “Merlin, how did you do that Harry and how did she not see us here?”
“Almost…” said the ghost sadly and slowly drifted away.
“Stop calling him an oaf!” snapped Hermione, but the gears started to turn in her mind and she put it together. “It was Professor Snape at the bar.”
“Are there any traps?”
“Funnily enough, no male Potter has lived past thirty, the deaths of the Potter's are always between twenty and thirty, and some were even killed at eleven. Harry has generations of the Potter magic in him, Harry is close to immortality, which is nerve breaking. The spell to do this is dark and very old, it’s rumoured that the Potter family made it after they kept being killed off. But that’s not it, when the Potter’s first settled here they caused so much conflict.”
“Oh Harry, a few people tried out for Seeker, you ready to defend your position?” Oliver kept his smile.
“I apologize,” said Harry solemnly, his head bowed. “Mrs. Feed.”
“Who escaped?” asked Ron, looking a little pale. “I mean, no one has escaped before, and now –”
“Just leave her there Potter, she will be fine.” Snape turned to face Harry.
“Unlike you, I was listening to them during Defence Against the Dark Arts and I learned something… something that’ll put us ahead of them.”
“– it isn’t life threatening, but she is sick,” continued Narcissa. “Your father is staying with her and refuses to leave her side, making sure that she has everything she needs and what she doesn’t need at the moment is her son flinging around words that personally insult her. He forwarded the report to Lucius, who in turn pushed it to me, claiming that I was better prepared to handle it.”
“Oh that is such a lovely shirt,” said Petunia, looking at the piece of fabric with a smile. “Where’d you get it?”
The lucky thing is that most people were starting puberty and it was just worthy of an eye roll and a mutter about teenage angst.
“Blaise, I have watched him every year, he does not eat, he slides a piece of food in his mouth then chews it for five minutes then pushes the plate away, his friends are to daft to realize it, that and he skips most meals.”
It occurred to him much later that he had just done magic out of school and that it wasn’t allowed. He counted the time in his head and waited for the letter to come or someone to come and snap his wand. Yet, no one or nothing came. He dug around in his trunk and placed the book he was reading into it safely, not wanting anyone to steal it, as only the cover was changed, not the actually contents. He pulled out a pair of his pyjamas that he would wear and set them neatly on the foot of the bed.
Marcus Flint stood like a giant compared to some of the students, he looked down on them with a slight sneer on his face. He made a grunting noise and watched as all eyes turned to him. “Alright,” he barked out loudly, “we’re only searching for a Seeker. Chaser, Beater and Keeper are fine how they are.”
Dean laughed quietly, “I know, I know.”
“They’re dull…”
“July 31
“Calm down, Harry,” whispered Draco, shifting aside when a spark almost hit him. “You’re going to burn the table.”
“He’s hurting, we’re all hurting.” Hermione whispered, she glanced around trying to locate Draco, but he wasn’t anywhere to be seen.
Harry sent his mother a blank look before he masked it with a small smile. “Differentiate is hardly a big word, in fact I’m more surprised you don’t know what it means, seeing as it starts with different.” He let out a long breath. “Recognize or ascertain what makes someone or something different. That’s what differentiate means.”
“I know that he’s a fighter, but that just makes it so much worse!” said Lily, sobbing. “While he’s out there fighting for his life, we’re in here doing
He was so distracted with that stupid anagram that he couldn’t even think without it occupying his thoughts. He considered himself lucky and his Mother a Seer for drilling this potion into him over the holidays.
“The Rosier name was tarnished by my father and his father,” said Rosier quietly. “Beauxbatons didn’t want me.”
“You have nothing,” Harry said coldly, “you had to live off others to live, and that’s pitiful.”
It was clearly the wrong thing to say the boy in front of him growled, as if he were an animal or a wild beast of some sort. He had read in plenty of books on creatures and never once read about boy that was standing directly in his light.
“This place is brilliant –”
“I can understand why you may dislike the idea of how I put those words, but just so you know I have no idea of ever replacing You-Know-Who, I just want to learn and study as much things as I can.”
Harry had drawn his wand, knowing that everyone now watched the scene with rapt intent. It was now that he would prove himself worthy of beating Longbottom, the incompetent wizard. He stared at Longbottom, watching as the boy twirled his wand nervously. ‘Good, he’s scared,’ he thought bitterly, ‘and so he should be.’
“Really?” said Harry, already knowing that, the woman took great pride in her undefeated streak. What a shame that it was now ruined.
“How do you really know?” said Draco, curious. “I don’t want to fail this, I need to pass it.”
He took his time to shift across in position to see exactly what Potter did to his wards to gain access, eleven years, that’s how long he has worked for Hogwarts, and not once has a student ever came close to breaking them and somehow Potter comes and within four days demolishes them.
“No matter, time to back on track. Now, Harry Potter is still currently in the infirmary as Madam Pomfrey didn’t want him to be moved… just yet,” Snape still kept his glaze on Draco. “In three or so days, Harry will be moved to a location only Dumbledore and McGonagall know-” Snapped paused and began reading Draco’s reaction, “-that much I can tell you, along with the fact the wards will be heavily strengthened, and I assume some kind of blood ward will be put in place.” Snape said the last part lazily.
“Easy,” he said, bending down. “I’ll slide my wand under the door and we’ll talk a bit and you can let me in. It’ll leave me defenceless and with no means to attack… not that I want to, of course. My goal was to protect you and get you out of here before they put enchantments around the village. It’ll happen soon enough, I think. Whatever’s lurking around isn’t gonna just leave.”
“Alas, it is the Malfoy way, but we all know you’re as much of a Malfoy as I am,” said Nicolas with a knowing glint in his eyes. “Now, tell Mr. Potter that I’ll be here every day, I love a good ice-cream, of course, I’m sure he already knows about this.”
‘I assume this is the work of the Tournament,’ he thought, waiting for the stairs to move into an ideal position. ‘Disrupt the mind, see how quick someone can overpower it… yet, it felt like it was impossible to overpower or even fight. Perhaps it was required for someone to simply remind you of the Tournament. Once Granger spoke about it, it all became clear – not just for myself, either. Longbottom had that infuriating look of clarity on his face.’
“I understand that Mr. Potter may or may not have been rude to you, but are some childish words worth his life? Another situation could be that he’s a Slytherin and that he does not need the assistance because he’s evil or in league with certain Death Eaters. That is false.”
“You’re a ghost Harry, at least be a happy ghost.” Voldemort sighed into his book. “If you wish I can ask Lucius to teach you how to go to Hogwarts? It was the place you died.”
“I was only just hired, I was filled in on most people, I was informed to treat a few people better than others and the Malfoy family and Harry Potter is on the top of the list.” The man regretted saying it, but lying wasn’t his strong suit.
Hermione hugged her tighter, “it’s Harry, he won’t die fixing your house, his house, and don’t think for a second he feels sorry for you, and he sees this as his own house. He told me last year that he would like to someday live here.” Hermione pulled from the hug, “come on, let’s get some breakfast!” Hermione and Molly retreated towards the kitchen, not before leaving a kiss on Harry’s forehead.
“Alright, alright!” said Lee Jordan, throwing his hands up. “Gryffindor in possession, Katie Bell is heading for a clean shot of the goals…”
Maybe that was the reason that this whole situation unnerved him slightly.
“Speech” | ‘Thoughts’ | ‘
Harry rolled his eyes as the arguing drew quieter and quieter over the seconds, the arguing couple vanishing out of earshot range. While it was rather interesting to listen to people argue as you learned so much about them in heated conversations, he had a book to find.
Harry slowly crept towards the portrait hole, waiting for someone to barge in and allow him to leave before the Gryffindors had a group meeting or something as stupid as that and made him spend all night here. It had been many years since he was so eager to actually read something, as if he would just sit down on the ground and open the book. ‘Maybe its Riddles own personal notes on the dark arts books? Much like I did in my own diary,’ he thought as he inched closer and closer towards the portrait hole.
“I do believe it’s the last point I made,” said Harry. “He’s asking Longbottom to catch the Snitch before the game drags on and Gryffindor’s aggressive playstyle tires them all out. He’s
“I honestly cannot believe you at times, Harry,” said Draco, a burst of renewed anger surging through him as he thought on it more and more. “I would never do something like this to you, especially if it was regarding such a rare and unique talent. I would never betray your trust and run off and tattle on you. You betray mine so regularly that I’m not sure if we’re even friends.”
“And if your detailing of what happened is correct, he said that you were recently groomed,” said James. “He
“They’ll react poorly, no matter what,” said Draco. “They’re Slytherins.”
“Because every Legilimens gets some sort of indication in their eyes when they use it as they’re connecting minds,” explained Harry. “Moment you see someone’s eyes go funny, whether they twinkle or get glazed over, break eye contact.”
“A plan from McGonagall, I think it’s brilliant – and guess what? You’re coming with – come on, let’s go!”
“Oh, I wouldn’t bother with that one if I were you,” said the woman, staring at the books disapprovingly. “You’ll start seeing death omens everywhere, it’s enough to frighten anyone to death.”
Harry made a shushing sound and squinted at the man, who was limping ever so closer to the teachers’ table. Each step the man took, a loud
“Not as far as someone would think,” said Lily, speaking before her husband could. “The magical population have done more extreme things, like being able to regrow bones within a single night. Muggles are still quite advanced, but solely in the basics.”
He fell towards the frozen river below silently, unable to scream or shout due to whatever that creature did to him. His final thought was revenge.
Draco was shocked at such a Muggle declaration by the professor, as wizards did not just smash things! He remained silent and listened on as the two argued and watched as Harry threw in ingredients in the midst of an argument without it even effecting his skill at brewing.
, Greengrass?” said Pansy, glaring. “Why don’t you talk to one of your own friends?”
“I don’t like the scarlet,” said Harry, turning his nose up at the colour of the train. “It’d look better if it was silver.”
“I don’t doubt it,” said Harry. “It’ll take more than a silly Tournament to take me down, Draco. I’ve evaded death before, I can do it again. Don’t worry.”
“I didn’t expect any less,” said Narcissa. “But I’m not here to discuss the famous, or infamous, depends on how you look at them, Black family. The word you used is a disgusting word that causes wars to start. How do you think the first war started, Harry?”
“The spell I just cast alerts the Head Auror that I am in trouble or that he is required immediately,” said Cornelius. “I dislike using this as I prefer to just use owls, but I think this is quicker than finding a piece parchment, ink, a quill, and an owl.”
Ernie laughed. “Did you leave any room for me to argue?” he said, watching the girl walk away, distraught. “Not that I’m complaining, of course.”
“Mopsy, can you go to my vault and pick up a book? It’s my special book, grab it and come back here, please,” asked Harry, a wide smile on his face. He waited for the house-elf to vanish before he lifted his head towards the Flamels. “Don’t worry about Mopsy, I learned early on that you could win house-elves over easily with kindness instead of beating them. She knows not to glance around when she comes to an unknown place.”
“Do you think I care?” said Harry, interrupting Miles’s rant. “Do you really believe that I care what you do in your spare time? Nope. I’m not going to give you the whole ‘I don’t care what you do, as long as you stay in decent shape and health for Quidditch’ speech as I just. Don’t. Care. I’m not going to spread your secret around, Miles, as I just do not care.”
Pansy sat next to Harry, “there you are Harry, we turned to see if you wanted to come into a shop and buy some candy and you were gone.”
Harry slowly moved towards the main street, sneaking as if he had just stolen the most priceless piece of art known to man. He made sure that Draco was behind him and not too far away. His eyes darted left and right, searching for any signs of danger or anyone else that was trying to get the jump on them. He had no idea what was attacking, but he was not going to foolishly only look directly ahead of him. He knew that if the attackers were human, they could be lurking on the roofs of various buildings, hiding behind anything, or even invisible.
“Why?”
is refusing to leave!”
“I didn’t see you there Harry.” Hagrid jumped up with excitement, almost knocking the table over. A few teachers looked over and just shook their heads. “How are you Harry? I miss you in my classes.”
“If you just asked instead of pulling me here, I would have told you that the potion did nothing, as it was an experiment,” he gave a slight giggle as the bunny licked his finger, trying to get the last bit of the carrot. “Yes, I took your ingredients, but I was certain you would understand that I was attempting something. In fact it was one of your lessons that actually inspired me to try this batch.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “There’s no good or evil, Weasley, you either choose to be great and accomplish your own goals or you choose to help fulfil someone else’s,” he said, glaring at the sword. “If you didn’t neglect history, you’d know that most, and I mean that in all, wizards and witches held no labels to magic and practiced any branch that they could.”
“I don’t care,” said Harry. “You said that only a handful of wizards can cast it, then I just don’t see the point. What a waste of time.”
“I know,” said Lily, laughing. “I don’t mind if we stay here, though. I know you’ll ignore me or wave me off if I ask whether you feel fine or not, but if you truly don’t feel like leaving, then I have no issues about staying here with you.”
The four of them continued up the corridors silently, of course Rosier was humming a soft tune that was unrecognizable, most likely foreign. The four boys were huddled together, not wanting to walk spread across the corridor. It was simpler this way and allowed for easy escapes. They reached the Grand Staircase and frowned when all the steps to the third-floor corridor vanished, blocking access to the said corridor.
“We should be unified to stop people from getting stupid ideas to try and betray us.”
However, he would address it later on in life, knowing that Tom was far from malevolent with his actions. If it had been a failed possession, something would have been attempted a long, long time ago. It was an anomaly, though, one he would crack once he could dedicate hours of research without anyone being wise about it. The last thing he wanted or needed was to make anyone aware of the situation.
Professor Quirrell waved them both into a seat, which was apparently saved so they could sit together and began to start the class, which was really on two minutes later and one minute and a half of those were listening to the Potter boy’s story about how he was almost kidnapped by a ghost.
Harry glared at Draco.
Draco half-smiled and took off, Snape was hiding something, and maybe in due time he would find out, but as for now, rest is all he needed.
,” hissed Nagini. “
“Wait, Harry is added to our wards? Why was I never informed?”
“You just want to get in his pants, Higgs.”
Harry shut the book and crossed his arms, “try me.”
Harry walked in and ignored the whispers, they seemed to be more than normal, maybe he had something on his face? Surely Blaise or Draco would have told him.
“Relatively?” said the girl that screamed. “She’s like… three times your size.”
“If we ever study Boggarts, you’ll know then, Theodore.”
“Nowhere has anyone said that the heir is a Slytherin,” countered Harry. “It could be a Hufflepuff or a Gryffindor.”
“This place is very… strange. Très étrange,” said Fleur, repeating the last few words in French over and over. “Time has been odd in Britain since we arrived. It is mending slowly. Madame Maxime suggested that someone has been meddling with time. It is repairing itself, time, so this is not caused by that.”
Draco made a slight gagging noise and then began to laugh loudly. “She looks like Crabbe, which would just be weird if you ask me, plus she isn’t that attractive and she has a brutish personality. The only thing that I like about her is her hair, I like black hair.”
“Sure,” said Ernie. “The lighting is better. You have some kind of evil scheme going on, don’t you?”
“I’m tempted to just let it kill you,” sneered Harry, ignoring the girl. “You have to be by far the most pathetic, downright disgusting human I have ever seen. When you’re asked to do something, you do it and not sit there and whimper –”
“I know that, James,” said Lily, placing her hand son her lips. “What are we going to do about Harry?”
“Perhaps,” said Severus, following the obvious clues that had been left by the boy with his eyes. “He simply got up and went for a walk.”
Harry gently opened it and glanced at the signature, “it’s from Severus, which could mean its private Professor stuff.” Harry lied easily, sometimes being the Boy-Who-Lived had some benefits, most people just took his word, “I’ll give it a quick read through and if it’s not, I’ll read it out loud for you.” Harry smiled, no he wouldn’t.
issues?”
He made his way over towards the shelves, studying the few completed potions with amazement. His green eyes were filled with excitement as he studied everything in the room. “I wish it was fully stocked,” he said out loud, a breathy sigh at the end of his statement. “I could probably use Mopsy to fill this up when I’m away at school.”
Narcissa placed her hands in her lap and smiled, “how did you sleep Harry?”
“Our job is done, we shall send down Ronald now, as well as Granger,” the two twins rushed up the stairs.
“It is possible, Mr. Potter,” said Dumbledore, picking up another candy from the bowl. “You know that the magical core begins growing at the age of eleven, hence why you begin your magical education at eleven and no sooner.”
“Pretty sure she wanted to throw me off the stairs and plummet down and die,” muttered Harry, following his father up the staircase, which seemed to be in some sort of pranking mood. He hadn’t realized that his father had stopped on a landing and he walked straight into it.
’ | “
“Of course, Gemma,” said Harry with a wide smile. “Make sure you punish those rowdy and annoying Gryffindorks out there and protect the Slytherins.”
Harry tensed and swallowed the insult that he wanted to throw back at Nott. He had to admit, as did Tom, that it was a good jab and he shouldn’t underestimate the boy. Who knew what kind of façade the boy had in this group, especially considering he hardly paid attention to anything Nott said in these meetings.
“Ha-ha, nah, I hate this class,” said Dudley.
“Hey, Dad, what object is the Portkey?”
,” muttered Ron.
“As you know, he has special permission to actually apparate directly onto the platform, as the Head Auror. Even if he wasn’t the Head Auror, I’m sure he’d be able to appear directly there, or he would anyway.”
He honestly felt as if he had gone from one interrogation to another. Draco had been adamant that something was wrong and that he wasn’t sharing for some odd reason. He laughed until Draco muttered about taking away books until he told the truth.
“The spell is completed,” said Lord Voldemort in a slow icy drawl. “Should your son to accept the Dark Mark and join my side, it will appear on his arm, no pain will occur.”
Harry took his hand and gave it a firm shake, “friends.”
Harry was already bored and tired of this little conversation. There was nothing that Riddle could do down here, even with Ginny’s mediocre ability in magic. The power Riddle had leeched from Weasley wouldn’t be enough to get him out of here and he’d need another Parselmouth to get him to leave, as Weasley didn’t possess that ability and it wouldn’t pass on if he used her body. He knew that it was possible, in very minor sense, to pass on abilities, but it came with a terrible risk and it could backfire in the simplest ways. Not to mention the ritual required you to do some nasty things, such as maim your own body with unhealable scars.
“He’ll also get Head Boy,” said Rosier. “Really, there’s no hope for anyone else.”
Harry sat next to Draco, at the back of the Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom, his chair propped up against the wall and he swung on it, leaning on the two hind legs of the chair. He was highly excited to know that he was being taught by none other than Gilderoy Lockhart, or Professor Lockhart, as he should be called now.
Lily peered at the book, trying to get a better look. “What book is it?”
“Maybe that’s what they wanted to do,” said Eleanor. “Maybe it was just an error…”
“If I recall right, today will be the busiest day at Diagon Alley, most children get their supplies today, I know I did.”
“Malfoy and his father,” said Neville. “Oh, and Harry was there, looking around.”
“We can’t take too long here, Harry,” said Lily as she tapped the correct sequence and watched as the bricks vanished, allowing them access to Diagon Alley. “There’s things that we must get done at home and if we get it done early, you can come home early.”
“Slytherin was a dark and evil wizard,” said Ron, glaring.
?” repeated Professor Snape sarcastically. “It’s odd that you don’t want share some humour with the class.”
She felt like she had somehow neglected her child, as magical children grew and developed faster than Muggle children. James had told her his first word was almost months before her own and he was walking before she could even crawl around.
“Yes, Professor Snape.”
“If I become immortal, he will sap the immortality from me, it could be years before he fully takes it, so we need to act while he’s weak, or has no knowledge about it. If he learns about anything ancient, he could take control of the wizarding world instantly as no one can touch him. The sources say that he must learn about the magic naturally before he can utilize it, it seems like a bunch of nonsense, and even if it is ancient magic it needs something to unlock it. We have no idea how to unlock it, which means we have no idea how to keep it locked.” Voldemort stood and walked to the bookshelves, “here Lucius, this is the Potter bloodline book, it may have something in it about their bloodline, and share it with Severus and no one else.”
I’m going to share a bit of my original drafts with you, even if it was drafted in book one. :)
One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall.
“That and it’s taught in Durmstrang,” said Vasily. “Stop glaring at me. He already said he goes to Hogwarts, which means he’s heard of Durmstrang.”
“Is that why you’re angry with my plan to lock Greengrass in there?”
“Grimdark the Green,” repeated Harry. “Fascinating.”
“Ten points from Gryffindor!” bellowed Professor Snape. “Keep your disgusting language out of my classroom, Mr. Weasley.”
“You don’t need to speak to me like I’m a toddler,” said Hermione. “You’re accusing Neville of putting another school on his parchment that he submitted.”
“A valid and legal play isn’t against the rules, Granger.”
He listened as Nagini continued to complain about the winged horses, not even calling them by their proper name. He shifted around the tree, responding when needed, mainly to pacify the complaining. He had learned the first time to not just levitate her down, else she would complain all day long about being independent and being able to get down herself, despite actually being stuck for more than an hour. Instead, he was made to create a makeshift ramp down the tree that allowed his precious familiar to get down herself. He had learned the first time.
In a split decision, he decided that it would be best if he left Diagon Alley completely and got away from the odd man that was lurking around, not wanting to be snatched. He may be talented in a lot of aspects, spells one of them, but he couldn’t outduel a snatcher, despite how dumb they appeared. Life on the streets had honed them and gave them knowledge that none could rival. Spells that would slow, trace, hinder, et cetera, were passed down the lines, from one snatcher to the next. They were best avoided, especially when they were on home territory.
“We know, but Harry has to say himself, I assume he asked his spirit to fix him and make it look like a scuffle, Harry will protect Ron for some reason, whether it’s because he’s threatened someone else or because of something else, but he will not tell, Dumbledore and I both know this.” Snaped huffed and picked Harry up.
“Odd,” said Harry. “Fine. Slytherins don’t look after their own, they seek to backstab you at any given moment. Many believe that we will stick together, but the moment you turn your back, a knife will be placed in it. Loyalty is a Hufflepuff trait, not a Slytherin trait.”
“What is it headmaster?”
“I see,” said Harry, slightly afraid. He balanced on his rock, testing the area that he could move and found that area to be very, very small. “And the first person to step off loses?”
,” said Draco, smiling. “Just not half your decisions.”
“What does a Boggart look like?”
“So?” the man’s rough voice cut across the street, not loudly, but not exactly silently. “Would you like to come in and look around the house? I have a feeling that you and your son will enjoy the house.”
“I assume Longbottom would have helped,” said Harry, tilting his head to the side. “Most people will donate the money back to him, amazed at what a kind and generous thing he did for a family that is struggling to simply survive.”
The main issue, at least from what he remembered, was that nothing was official and there was no documentation of what exactly happened. It was almost as if your mind and magic would scream and force you not to kill a unicorn. Only the most severely unrestrained, the most emotionally handicapped could even consider it.
“Yeah Draco, just imagine it! You’ll be a mere three inches away from Harry, wrapping your arms around him drawing patterns on his back as you breathe into his soft neck.”
“What are you even talking about?” said Draco, confused. “Blood purity was abolished
Lily wouldn’t argue, but she did need an explanation how it followed traditions. In the book it simply said to never ask, so she didn’t.
“Nice attempt at trying to be charming,” said Lily with a chuckle. “I’ve grown immune to your attempts at complimenting me to get out of things, Harry.”
Neither James nor Lily had any idea of what was happening, even Severus seemed at a loss on what could be causing it. Over the past three months, the Potter family had been all over trying to figure out a cause for the sudden sickness of their child. The flying issue was the start, it soon evolved into him not eating properly, and meals would often be pushed away by the small boy, shaking his head with tears streaming down his face.
“Menteur!”
“HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat.
“This corridor is creepy,” said Neville, looking at the long, thin, jet-black tapers, all burning bright blue, casting a dim, ghostly light even over their own living faces. The temperature dropped with every step they took. As he shivered and drew his robes tightly around him, he heard what sounded like a thousand fingernails scraping an enormous blackboard.
“J-just a game?” raged Wood.
Harry had to think on what his greatest fear was as he actually had no idea. He knew that most adults inherently feared the Dark Lord, but most children only grew up hearing bedtime tales about him and that if they misbehaved, the Dark Lord, or You-Know-Who, as they called him, would come for them in their sleep.
“Harry dear, I am Helga Hufflepuff, but you may call me Helga.” Helga gave an elegant bow.
Harry glanced around as discreetly as he could manage, his head turning toward the older students almost instantly, knowing their knowledge of spells and influence would be far more useful than the younger students. What shocked him was that barely anyone raised their hand, excluding his small circle of friends and people that were on or previously on the Quidditch team. It was both depressing and aggravating that no one would aid him if he needed their help.
“Yes.”
“Look who is awake? Means the fun can start,” the lady flicked her wand at Harry and made him stand, “excellent, excellent you need good manners for when the Dark Lord comes and kills you.” The lady cackled and turned to the nearby wall, “will you tell us what we need to hear or should we force it out of you?”
,” said Neville and Ron.
“Don’t be dramatic.”
“Someone needs to catch and bring in Voldemort’s forces, as there’s only so much that we can do alone. That someone is you, Jamesy boy.” Sirius said with a half barked laugh and a half shrug.
“We already have everything,” Pansy grinned at Draco with a mischievous smile, “he will need a set of Slytherin robes that we will use to take as the appearance, the only issue is that they must be the same size as him else bad things could happen, like things you don’t even want to imagine.”
“I know that this may be funny to you, Theo, but it’s hindering me in every single possible way,” said Harry, looking concerned. “If a cat wasn’t petrified, and this was done as a joke, I’d be laughing along with you, but one was and it’s making this joke seem real and they think I’m some sort of future Voldemort in the making. If I was in any other house besides Slytherin, I would have already been torn to shreds.”
“Where’s Harry?” Narcissa said quickly.
the Chamber?”
The owl ate the bacon and quickly took flight from the spot next to the boy and flew out the open window above the students.
“GO!”
“Calm down,” Narcissa laughed, “yes, he’s staying with us over the holidays, he refuses to eat and such, it’s actually saddening.” Narcissa turned to Harry, “Harry dear, have you ordered all you need?”
“Good morning,” said Harry enthusiastically with a tiny bow. He’d be a lair if he said he expected a response, but there was no harm in trying. He, of course, knew that goblins disliked wizards, it was a long line of hatred that led back centuries, but they still agreed to work with wizards, assuming that they kept their noses from their business.
,’ said Tom. ‘
To humans, that would have made no sense, but to a snake or someone that could communicate with them, it made all the difference.
The yard was lavish, more lavish than the one at Malfoy Manor. The stone path went in a circle, which had hedges and trees in it, as well as a marble fountain which was squirting fountains of water into the air at a rapid rate. It was almost mesmerising watch the water as it bounced around the fountain, dropping off in one section only to rise in another.
“I think we should go.”
“Slytherin follow the student with the most power. It all makes sense now.”
. A potions kit?
“It’s not actually called wish magic, Hermione,” cut in Neville before Hermione started on a tirade about it. “That’s just another term for controlled accidental magic, something that Harry was good at, simply because his magic was protecting him due to the fact he couldn’t ask for things verbally.”
“I have no idea, Dean,” replied Neville, he really did have no idea what had happened in the dormitory.
,” hissed Harry. “
“Don’t try and act like you have no idea,” said Professor Snape. “Everyone, including those dim-witted, can see that you hold yourself above everyone else and when you feel like you’re being threatened, whether intentionally or not, you react like a seven-year-old and aim to knock them down with retorts.”
Harry gave a bloody smile and wobbled a little, falling to his knees with a grunt.
“As I said just moments ago, I have six hundred years of experience over others. I am glad that you have it and not You-Know-Who, that makes me exceptionally happy, not that either of you can use the Stone, you’d need almost sixty years in the study of alchemy just to learn how to work the thing, it took me awhile.”
“You don’t think he’ll last?”
“It was horrible, at least Malfoy didn’t sit with me, I made him shove off as soon as I could,” Harry smiled, happy with himself. “Shit!” Harry yelled, once again garnishing looks, “I forgot to change into my robes.” Harry sighed, “I’ll meet you in the Great Hall?” Harry turned around and quickly changed, when he came back everyone was gone, everyone but Malfoy.
“You best watch yourself, Hagrid,” said Hermione in a concerned tone of voice. “They could come back.”
Harry bowed slowly, “as am I, Ronald.”
“Right the one who is obsessed with having pure-blood and harasses everyone with it,” said Harry. “So it wouldn’t surprise me if the password was something to do with pure-blood.”
“No thanks, you’re completely starkers,” said Harry, taking off his pants and placing them on a small platform. “But go on.”
‘Conversation,’ = Thoughts
’ | “
“That’s nonsense,” said Harry as he walked towards the sink. “It’s just another thing people made up to deter said people from here. People are still making Myrtle out to be another Bloody Baron.”
“Lily!” she said happily, looking at Lily with almost complete happiness. “You came a little earlier than I expected, I’m surprised you didn’t floo in.”
“Be careful,” she said, watching her friend with a slight motherly care, one that could put Molly to shame. “I mean it Severus. You may act like you can go against the rules and survive. If you must, tell him something about us, hold your spy status well.”
“I still find it curious that you remained,” said Albus. “I have no intent on calling you a dark wizard and I was neither implying it. If there is anything for certain that I know about you, Mr Potter, it is that you do everything you do for a reason.”
“I hate that you were right.”
He slowly turned his eyes from the wall that flickered between a twilight and a sunrise. It was a breathtaking sight that the boy had made his Occlumency wall. It didn’t take much to realise that the wall was more prominently twilight rather than sunrise. Taking a step forward, he realised that his feet left the footfall of the twilight wall. Each step left a small black circle that exploded after a few seconds of movement.
Blaise decided now was his time to re-join the conversation, “slightly correct, you see theirs three types of love. The lowest form is the friendship love, then family love and then relationship love. Draco loves Harry with the highest one, so neither of the others would work, the love must be genuine and from a new person.”
“That’s right; Seamus could beat you in his sleep!” Ron laughed.
I am still going to write, but I need to refine my motivation for it. I have started to write some smaller works… I will keep them Harry Potter based, but you know. My goal is to release a chapter of them each second Sunday and hope they keep me writing. Mostly, it will probably be male/male slash, as nothing is better to write than that, but we will see. If you want to see anything, just let me know and I will see what I can do. I need to rekindle my creativity and my love for writing.
“Rubbish!” said Hagrid rather loudly, holding the teapot in his hands. “Why would Snape do somethin’ like that?”
Draco woke up, bright and early only to find Harry in his own personal bedroom, “Morning sleepyhead!” Harry laughed, but kept a firmly smile. Draco pulled the blankets over his head and groaned. “I won’t peak Draco, just go and get your robes.” Harry placed his hands over his face; hiding the grin he had forming. After Draco was done Harry couldn’t help but burst out in laughter. “I can see through my hands!” Harry was still laughing; he decided to leave when Draco hurled his toothbrush at him. Harry peered back in, “honestly Draco, you can be cute when you blush.”
“Hm,” said Zacharias. “That sounds about right.”
“Really?”
“I don’t think it’s wise to take him to St. Mungo’s, Lily,” said Molly softly, her eyes filling with concern. “I know something must be done, but moving him will just cause him distress. It may be wise to contact Dumbledore or something, I’m sure he knows.”
“The Boy-Who-Lived endorsing a broom? That’ll go down well, I think,” said Harry. “It’d put sales through the roof, if we’re being honest about it. Nimbus is just as good, if not better than the Firebolt.”
“I’ll tell you later,” said Rosier, sighing. “I know you’re both curious – don’t give me that look, Harry – and I’ll tell you when the professor isn’t eavesdropping.”
He gently caught Pansy’s arm and twisted her away from the large, inviting archway that would have led her to certain doom. Another one of Salazar’s genius ideas. Have death traps in the Chamber. He grinned and turned towards the portrait of the man in question.
After the twenty-fifth attempt, the gargoyle moved aside.
Harry rolled his eyes and just stood there silently, not looking at anyone at all. He wished he had brought a book with him, he could get one out of his trunk but that would be rude.
“Can I have that?” asked Draco while Mr. Borgin looked at the list, he pointed at the withered hand on a dusty cushion.
Seeing as it was the first day of the summer holidays, he quite expected Diagon Alley to be deserted or at least somewhat empty. He did not expect to see groups and groups of foreign wizards that were pointing and laughing at signs and objects, nor did he expect the scattered Aurors that were trying to be discreet.
“Cute,” said Harry, causing the three of them to jump. “Guess it’s the four of us.”
“Which means we’ll be at the top and the Gryffindors on the bottom,” said Pansy, twisting her hair. “Decent plan.”
He backpedalled a few steps, making sure to remain close to Dumbledore in case something happened. He covered his nose, groaning, as the smell of decaying and disease filled the air. He was close to retching, his eyes filling with tears as the smell attacked him. He felt it all vanish in a second when a crimson red guard appeared over his nose, much like a mask. He glanced towards Dumbledore, realising that the man had not been the one to cast it and appeared to be struggling.
“Because she made it up, looking for sympathy,” said Harry with a soft laugh. He gestured towards the gate to the Restricted Section. “I can get you in, you know. Professor Quirrell gave me a signed note to access the Restricted Section weeks ago.”
“Potter,” huffed Rosier. “Stop walking so fast, you’ll find him.”
“I think that’s a question all of us ask, flower name or not,” said Harry, dropping his head. “There’s no way to live life right, just ways to live it wrong. We’re born to die, aren’t we? We put our trust in the hands of others, which gets us killed. We love others, which gets us hurt. With all that, tell me what it’s worth?”
“It’s just that you have been a brat,” Fred said.
“Because I like him, you cannot date your family.”
Ron shook his head, still looking at the mirror. “No – I’m alone – but I’m different – I look older – and I’m Head Boy!”
“How do you know that?”
“Well, it depends on whether you mean the traditionalist pure-bloods or not.”
!’ on it. Draco thought it was simply amazing, and had to bring it. Draco waved it when Harry flew past; of course Harry noticed it and shook his head with a smile clearly visible.
However, as he had grown, the magic of the village seemed to dissipate. Each building looked less perfect and magical and more worn than what he had remembered. The stores seemed to have decreased, the homes vanishing, and the green grass being replaced with dirt and mud. It was a depressing sight to see.
“Good, good…”
The lesson ended almost uneventfully, besides the fact that some Gryffindor caused his feather to explode. The students quickly fled the class, chatting about the upcoming Hallowe’en Feast and planning to stuff themselves silly with food.
Aside from all that, he was quite embarrassed with his fellow Slytherins, who barely lasted very long in the test. Some, Draco and Rosier, were quite good, lasting longer than most other people, Pansy was also the best female in the class, but all the others were seriously lacking.
“The one – and only – good thing about goblins is that they learn very quickly,” said Harry as the goblin growled and swore at the wooden gate. “They learned that they must maintain their position in Diagon Alley, which they took from the dwarves, so they can pass back information to the Goblin Nation. You give them a front and they’ll hold it until their entire race is dead. This place’ll never fall, no matter how much force and power is thrown at it. Greedy beasts.”
Harry clenched his fists. “He wouldn’t be willing to come here and get the ale from the
However, Diagon Alley was a better area that was bigger and allowed for a little bit more privacy. It didn’t offer much, considering the office of the
“James trusts him, which should be enough for me, but I just don’t feel secure knowing that he can pass on the secret of our home to anyone, especially You-Know-Who,” she paused, thinking. “Peter was never very loyal, I feel that he was only placed in Gryffindor because he lacked any notable traits from the other Houses. He has no Hufflepuff loyalty. No wit from Ravenclaw, and he’s far from ambitious.”
“Mr Malfoy,” said Professor Lupin. “Well done! It took you a little bit longer than everyone else, especially the Boggart, but you’ll receive full marks for being so cautious and patient.”
“Tell me again why you thought you needed to buy James the deluxe Skiving Snackbox?”
“Well,” he said, grabbing Harry’s hand, “Come along, you draft prat. Let’s go ask Pomfrey if you’ve cured me.”
“Don’t take this the wrong way, ok?” Harry said.
“Obviously,” Draco said, “But the right one isn’t interested in me. And he’s straight, so he never will be. Which is why I’m on the verge of opening a flower shop.”
“Do you really think he would, Dad?” Scorpius was looking at him like the world was made of rainbows, and Harry shrugged awkwardly, trying hard to smile.
Malfoy growled and bit Harry’s earlobe. He tugged on it meanly, but hissed through his teeth, “Please, Scarhead. I need your pretty little lips on my cock.”
“There’s an abandoned classroom up the hall.” Harry waved a hand off to his right.
“No, we haven’t, but if I’m flower-free I intend to drag you to the room of requirement and have my way with you until dawn tomorrow.”
