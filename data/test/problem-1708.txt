"You're dating Malfoy!"  Ginny Weasley was the first one to point out the obvious, although Draco had mentally thought that it'd be Potter's sidekick.  "Ron, why aren't you saying anything?"  And apparently she agreed with Draco.
He wasn't that exhausted. "Sure. I guess I'll have to trust you again," he said with a smirk as he took Potter's hand and they Apparated to London.  "This is Sirius' house, isn't it?"
"I never wanted to get you killed.  Definitely expelled, and it's your own bloody fault.  I just wanted to be your friend and you hurt my feelings.  I wasn't really used to hearing the word 'no' until you came around," Draco admitted.  "It made me hate you and… obsessed, I guess.  Why didn't you want to give me what I wanted? I mean I know why now, but back then, I couldn't conceive the idea that anyone would deny me anything."
Draco nodded.  "I'm not here on work matters.  It's… personal, but I didn't know how else to get in touch with you.  I wasn't sure that you'd answer owls from random people."  It was known that Potter got hundreds of pieces of correspondence and if rumours were true, he burned them without opening them unless they were delivered by owls he knew.  "I can wait in the atrium until you're done.  I came here because I wasn't sure if you left from somewhere else."
"Or maybe I should keep it more private, like this," Harry teased, before closing his teeth around Draco's nipple. He flickered his tongue over the nub while he tightened his bite.
"Stop, I do not want to hear it.  There's absolutely no reason for anyone to share about their sex life." Ron shivered.  "As I was saying to Draco for finding the spell that made same-sex marriage possible.  So cheers."
"You sound… better. In school, it was about doing what was right, what Dumbledore wanted, now, you sound like you know what you want and won't let anyone get in the way."  Draco rested his untouched glass on his thigh and turned his head to look at Potter.  "Pretending isn't you, though.  It hurts you. I could feel it in your body.  I don't want to be why you're hurting, not after all this time.  As I said, I'll take-"
"You proposed so I would fuck you faster," Harry said amused.
"Get in bed and I'll stop spanking you."  Harry smiled. "On your back tonight."
"You're not an Auror, no reason for you to know," Potter answered with a calm that was becoming infuriating.  Sure, Draco needed a favour, but that didn't mean that he was truly rational when it came to Potter, and he was looking forward to some of their banter. The conversation was not the only change.
Draco snorted.  "No, you old man can wait until the morning." He sighed. "You still haven't answered."  At the frown, he rolled his eyes. "Do you think you wanna marry me?"
Harry laughed. "I did tell you you'd be punished."  He pressed it all inside, before smacking Draco's arse.  "On your knees, my love."
"I'm sorry that I can't annoy you," Draco answered with a smile.
With his new specialization came plenty of new responsibilities.  He was working hard, but it was rewarding work and he spent plenty of time at St. Mungo's.  Macmillian had become the champion of his cause at the hospital, making sure that Draco had access to the high profile cases that would help him move up the chain eventually.  With all of that going on, he barely remembered the 'conditions' until he got an owl from Potter, telling him that they'd be going to a party.  The date and time were listed.  Potter added (because he certainly wasn't asking) that they'd meet at the gates of the manor beforehand.
"Right, the Weasleys. I'm sure they'll love this surprise.  May I ask why you need a fake boyfriend?"
"I see."  When they stepped inside, Potter put a hand over his mouth, indicating to be quiet, until they walked upstairs into a drawing room. The room looked old, but Draco was drawn to the large tapestry.  "The décor is circa 1978, isn't it? Dreadful, Potter.  I don't know how you can live here."
Potter nodded.  "It's… Let's just say that I'll get around to redecorating it."
Draco could feel Harry's eyes drilling into him the entire way up the stairs.  They hadn't walked, preferring to Apparate since neither wanted to wait.  As soon as they got to their room, they shed their clothes with ease. Harry moved closer and ran a hand down Draco's chest, all the way down to his erection.  His cock had been kept hard by a magical shimmering ribbon that worked better than any cockring, because the ribbon tightened and loosened on command. It was one of Harry's creations, one that allowed him to keep Draco wanting for hours, and on occasion, even for entire days.  They might be getting married, but they weren't boring.
"Carefully," Draco answered with a little huff.  "Very carefully."
"Fireworks make things fun. Come on, Draco, are you really so afraid to take a chance?" Potter asked.
, but he knew better than to push, especially with the ribbon digging into his sensitive cock.  Last time he had tried, Harry had kept him hard for three days before allowing him to come.
"Do you have a Muggle boyfriend?" Draco asked with a frown.
"Have you considered taking down the wall paper it's attached to?" Draco asked, amused.
"And what about your shag?" Potter challenged.
Potter took him outside the office and down a corridor Draco had never noticed, making him think that there had to be some spell to obfuscate it.  They stepped through a door that went nowhere and there was the pull of a portkey and suddenly they were on Knockturn Alley.  Thankfully, Potter's uniform ensured that people stayed out of their way and Draco wouldn't be completely humiliated.  "I had no idea this existed," he said, not sure how to even start.
Weasley shrugged.  "Figured it was him.  Harry's always been obsessed with him and when he stopped telling us about his boyfriends, Hermione and I figured that there was only one person it could be. Git-  I mean Malfoy showed up at the office a few months ago and that was pretty much it."
"It's not my fault. You know I'm slow unless you tell me what's going on.  You should have told me and we could have saved ourselves the trouble," Weasley answered, easily.  "And what are you staring at, Malfoy?"
"Right, as if they would ever consider me," Draco said.
Despite the many years, Draco still blushed. They said that if you couldn't say something, you shouldn't do it, but they were all liars.  Draco had grown up in a very reserved environment and he was happy to do things that he'd never mention aloud.  Harry knew it, too, which was why he was chuckling. "Do you know why I like it?  Because with a little spell, I can see through the glass, inside you, where no one else has been, because you're mine. Every part of you is
"Of course, Sir.  Harry will be delighted to get to know you," Draco answered, while thinking how screwed he was.  Majorly screwed.  They couldn't take away his specialisation, not anymore, but they could fire him.  They wouldn't say that he was being fired for lying about Potter, because that was ridiculous, but they'd find a way, a mistake, something, because even the best Healer made a mistake here or there, and with some cases, it was inevitable.  They would give him one of those cases, note his mistakes and fire him.
"What Ron is trying to say," Granger put it, "is that we've had months to come to terms with this, although Harry, you could have said."
"We haven't come out, because we don't want the publicity," Potter continued, "and with all the history with us, we haven't told our friends.  Ready?"
"Would you like to come to my place?" Potter asked.
For the past six years, they had gone to the Karaoke Box, a bar a mere fifteen minutes walking distance from Grimmauld Place.  This might have seemed like an irrelevant detail for wizards, but there had been way too many nights when they had been too drunk to Apparate. The crowd was incredibly supportive, not that Potter was any good, because he was absolutely atrocious when he sang, but everyone was too drunk to care.
Draco waited outside. The fresh air improved his mood. Or maybe it was just being outside of that house.
"This is a terrible idea," Draco said.
"Harry?"
"Of course, and we both appreciate your diligence.  I'm sure that now he'll be able to advance like he deserves.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to keep moving. As you can understand, Draco and I can't be seen together."  He turned to Draco.  "I'll see you later at home."
There was no finesse or build up tonight.  They were both too worked up and Draco was already teetering on the edge.  Harry rocked his hips hard.  The thud of the headboard against the wall matched Harry's grunts. Neither was capable of words now, harsh breaths filling the room.  With a murmured word, Harry loosened the ribbon and it was all that Draco needed, coming violently, body arching up while come spread between them.  Harry thrust through the clenching and then he was coming as well.
Draco rolled his eyes, although he really deserved that.  "You see, at work, the higher ups weren't willing to let me move forward.  St. Mungo's is half healing and half politics and as you can imagine my name comes with some baggage.  Pansy was trying to help, and well… she mentioned that I'm seeing someone, not just someone, but someone who could help with my position."
"And he'd be so wrong," Potter said with a sarcasm that Draco didn't recognize from their school days, reminding him that they had both grown up.  "Fine, I'll go along, but I have two conditions.  Both you and Macmillian have to take oaths.  I don't want either one to rat me out. And, two, you come to a party with me after the gala."
Potter laughed humorlessly.  "I work at the Ministry and the press hasn't left me alone in eight years.  I learned.  All right, then, let's do this oath and then I can go home."
Draco shook his head, despite the fact that yes, he wanted to say that he wanted to let go of the headboard, he wanted to touch Harry, he wanted to be fucked
"That's because your family and friends still worry about appearances and what's best," Weasley said.  "If we did, we'd have kicked you out already, but if you are Harry's choice, then you have our support.  Harry knows that we'll support him no matter what."
Minutes later, Draco was back at the manor, wondering what he was getting himself into.
"Naturally or I wouldn't have called you," Harry answered with a roll of his eyes. "Are you leaving already?"
Potter had grown up quite nicely.  He was still an inch shorter than Draco and yet seemed larger than life.  Annoying self-righteousness had turned into a quiet self-confidence.  He had worked undercover and that couldn't have been easy considering that everyone knew the Chosen One.  Even with polyjuice and glamours, Potter had learned to change who he was.  Or maybe people in general didn't know him as well as Draco did.
"And?  There's no way you came to the Ministry to tell me this if it were over," Potter said, crossing his arms and staring Draco down.
"How do you know that I’m interested in men?" Potter said.
"So what exactly can I do for you?" Draco asked.
Potter snorted.  "No one ever thinks that there's an entire Muggle world with billions of people and that's exactly why I date Muggles.  Wizards don't suspect, Muggles have no idea who I am and they can't sell my story to the papers.  So, why hasn't this Healer said anything yet? Harry Potter Is Bent would sell quite well."
Draco's whole body vibrated with need as he arched to meet Harry's mouth.  "Please… fuck, Harry. You're such a bastard."  Harry
The clapping and cheering got louder as he sang.  The word 'girl' was changed for 'Harry', but otherwise he sang it perfectly, not that it mattered at the moment.  The only important thing was the look in Harry's eyes when at the end of the song, he went on his knees and took out a wedding band with the Malfoy crest.
"Wait up!"
Draco got lost in the taste.  Fat, thick cock pressing against his tongue.  Large head pressing against his throat, cutting off his breath.  Then, without any warning, the plug began to vibrate inside him.  Each time Harry's cock cut off his breathing, the plug rubbed his prostate.  He tried to be good, to stay still, but soon he was rocking his hips, fucking empty air, while craving friction.  Harry wasn't complying.  Instead he kept fuckng Draco's mouth with abandon.  Draco knew that if it weren't for the ribbon he'd come untouched. It was such a heady feeling, thoughts disappeared replaced by sensations only, leaving him confused when Harry pulled away.
"Thank you for having me, Mrs. Weasley, and happy birthday, Sir," Draco said, politely, although he wished that people would stop staring right about now.
Draco moved without hesitation, spreading his legs wide, just like Harry liked.  His breathing was getting erratic, waiting for something, although he never knew what would come.  He felt the warm oil slide down his crack and gasped.  It was going to be one of those nights, when Harry drove him mad with pleasure.
Tonight was not one of their usual monthly visits.  They were here to celebrate and Draco had prepared only one song.
Draco finished off his pint, because some liquid courage couldn't hurt, before getting up.  This was not his usual song.  He went for pieces that were older, while this song had come out just the year before, but it just fit so well and he knew it was the one.  He loosened the leather thong keeping his hair in a ponytail and his silver strands came free.
How the fuck could Harry manage to sound so in control when he was barely holding it together?  Draco didn't know and didn't ask, but he went to bed.  He didn't try to look sexy or pose.  Harry would tell him what he wanted, like he always did in nights like this.  He didn't have to wait long before the order came. "Legs up, hands holding the headboard, no touching for you tonight."
"Open your mouth."  Harry stroke his cock a few times lazily. His fingers raked through Draco's long hair and Harry gripped it at the back.  He ran his cock over Draco's lips, before pushing it in.  He sat the pace from the start, rocking his hips and driving his cock deep into Draco's mouth until he was gasping.
"The house belonged to a friend of mine."  Before the Ministry had confiscated it and used the house for parties.
it, but instead he focused on keeping his legs up, pushing back as much as he could as Harry started to thrust.
"No, I'll tell him.  I don't want any misunderstanding that this is coming from me, and I will go after him with everything I have if he tries to sell the story to the papers," Potter said. "St. Mungo's is half politics, right? Turns out, I have plenty of political pull."
"Hopefully shagging," he said.  He put his glass on the coffee table, before reaching for Draco's and putting it away as well.  Potter stood up and offered Draco a hand. "Let me show you my bedroom."
That would have been logical, except he would have lost everything.  "They would fire me, Potter.  They barely accepted me, because the grades on my NEWTs were really good, but they have done everything in their power to make me quit.  They'll find a way to get me fired."  He looked at Potter.  "I know I have no right to ask you this, but could you pretend?  I can tell Macmillian that you don't want people to know, so we don't have to spend time together, but I can introduce him to you, we'll play the part and in a few months, I'll tell him we broke up. Please, you have every reason to say no, but it's my career."
Draco shook his head, breathless already. Harry had this power over him.  A few touches, a few words, and it made Draco go weak at the knees.  "Just right."
"I don't.  No one knows.  No one knows anything about your private life.  It's like you're a monk."
"Where are we going? Is this good or should I change?" Draco asked, always aware of the way he looked.
"School was the first time that I was able to do what I wanted.  I wasn't about to let you tell me what to do," Potter answered, making Draco wonder about his childhood.
After the trial and Potter's testimony, Draco had gotten a little obsessive, just a little no matter what Pansy said.  He'd read everything that had been written about the man, bought every magazine with Potter's pictures and if those were wanking material?  Well, no one had to know, right?  Oh right, he needed to stop thinking and start talking, because Potter was looking at him weirdly.
Draco stopped and faced Potter. "What's the real reason, Potter?"
Harry sighed. "The Ministry needs the best people and you are one of those people. I've watched you do things that no sixteen-year-old should do or know.  We need you, but also I really do miss you.  I was hoping that maybe once you're settled at the Ministry, you'd consider going out with me… unless I'm completely off about what our obsession with each other meant, in which case, you should still apply and I won't bother you."
"Hello, everyone.  Happy birthday, Arthur."  Potter handed the man his present, while keeping Draco's hand tight.
Draco snorted. "Come on, he talks about us, but he's been obsessed with her since we were eleven.  We all saw that one coming from the start."
should have.” Draco clutches Harry’s waist, pulling him back, fitting their bodies together seamlessly, lips to hips.
“I do not lust for
Harry thinks madly.
Pansy cracks her gum and drags a nail file across her thumbnail. “Ron tells me a certain stormy-eyed nerd was decked out in blue and gold team spirit this morning.”
Draco picks up a strawberry, using it to scoop a generous lump of icing—decorated with a golden “D”, of course—and offers it. “And it is your birthday,” he says softly. “You should have your cake... ” The strawberry caresses Harry’s mouth, a slow drag tracing the seam, connecting Harry’s heartbeats. “And eat it, too,” Draco finishes.
Harry’s gaze travels from Draco’s exposed ankle up to the peak of his bony kneecap to follow the shadowy path carved into the inner thigh muscle… all the way to the clear outline of Draco’s cock nestled against his hip crease.
Harry bites his smile. “I’ll tell you.”
“Uh boy,” Ron sighs. “You’d better go help him before he gouges out one of those
-The Roof is on Fire, Rock Master Scott & The Dynamic Three
“Harry James Potter, quiet down!”
“I thought you trusted me,” Draco grits.
Laughter and conversation float in from the kitchen.
“And a relief, honestly,” Draco continues. He sighs, swirling the ice in his glass.
“Indeed.” Draco smiles against Harry’s lips. “Carried that torch for me long, then, Mr Potter?”
Ron swipes a finger through the pristine white icing frosting Harry’s birthday cake, catching the “D” in
“Cute,” Harry says, only half-meaning the figurine. He holds up his own fluffy owl keychain.
Harry snags the hem of his jersey and tugs Draco into his arms.
Harry exhales a curse. He used to believe that Malfoy bloodied and beaten was retribution, that his broken bones were recompense. It had happened often enough at the hands of fellow trainees, and once by Harry. Only once. Instead of vindication, he’d felt as he does now—nauseated and repentant at the realization that he was the only one who could beat life into eyes as dead as slate.
Harry picks up Draco’s phone from the pavement and exchanges it for the wire hanger.
Draco sucks his teeth and folds his arms across his chest, prickly and perfect, and Harry wants to devour him.
Harry snorts. “Kiss my arse.”
Harry’s magic spikes, warming his fingertips. “You’re hurt.” He reaches for Malfoy’s hand.
If Harry hadn’t snogged him, at least five other blokes would have.
And Harry does. That’s the blank unholy surprise of it all. How could he not with Draco looking at him as though he would carve out his own heart and present it to Harry on a platter. It’s a glimpse so subtle, so fleeting, so rare, Harry wonders if he’s imagined it. Late at night, in the small hours, as he lay thinking about a sharply dressed man with steel eyes and sweating through his sheets, he convinces himself that it’s true.
He takes the drink intended for Theo and scoots Pansy out of the way with a current of magic for a clear view of Harry embracing Ron. The movement pulls Harry’s jumper taut around his broad shoulders and back. A sliver of tanned skin peeks out as the hem hitches.
” Draco taunts with hot open-mouthed nuzzles. “You’re driving me mad.”
Draco leans in and presses his lips against Harry’s mouth, timid yet bold. It’s off center, more cheek than lips. Draco’s tooth knocks against Harry’s canine, and it’s so fucking perfect Harry might just die right here amongst the stacks. He tilts his head, and melts into a proper kiss, licking into Draco’s mouth, tongue velvety hot against Draco’s upper lip. A sweet little moan has Harry pressing his face into Draco’s neck (
“It was a Fire Imp,” Luna repeats.
Malfoy vanishes the cigarettes and draws Harry to him with a firm hand to the back of Harry’s neck. Harry goes easily, melting into Malfoy’s comforting solidity and warming magic, tension slackening like a stayed hangman’s rope.
Draco is putting his foot down.
Harry’s magic bursts hot, rattling the bureau drawers and his bones. His cock twitches in his fist, dribbling pre-come. He whimpers around Draco’s cock.
Relief softens Harry’s muscles, followed quickly by clenching anger. “It’s been a fucking month.”
Ginny flips a page of her
reads our magazine, for Merlin’s… sake… !” Percy’s voice trails off as Luna waltzes him out the door.
Harry straightens. “I’ll take you in,” he says in a rush. “We can debrief Robards—”
, before suddenly Draco’s retreating.
Harry deeply inhales Draco’s scent, a mixture of ambrosial cologne, tart black currant, and rich leather. The blend makes Harry light-headed, and each breath fans the embers of his magic. Warmth eddies in his fingerprints. He distracts himself with Draco’s written words, picking out phrases at random.
Lily tosses cereal at Scorpius’ head. “Wake up, Scorpy! The toaster is on fire!”
signature drink, love?”
“Devon?” Draco laughs, a bubbly rumble that sets his Adam’s apple bobbing against the top button of his velvet shirt. “Oh darling, Devon’s out. Fitz is in. Do keep up.” He bends to brush wrinkles out of the cape. His trousers hug his long legs and pull taut over his hips. The smooth expanse of velvet over the side-divot in his arse broadcasts the fact that he’s not wearing any pants.
He had been slouched at the kitchen table, his curls a dark scattering of commas on the table around him, carving stripes into the label of an empty beer bottle with the shears, when the folded crane note had flitted through Grimmauld’s kitchen window.
“Fuck you.”
Draco leans against the wall, shoulder pressing hot into Harry’s.
And he’s wearing the jacket.
Draco exhales forcefully, nostrils flaring, his magic a steel tuning fork vibrating the air with indignation. He’s a little scary and a lot sexy, and on Harry’s desk the gloves, unsurprisingly, catch fire. Flames flicker, silver like liquid mercury.
Wallbanger for the birthday boy.”
He sweeps a velvet cape off his shoulders, revealing a matching neck-to-toe outfit in a rich indigo hue. The cape billows and flutters in shimmering violets as Draco drapes it over the back of the leather chair.
The silence was deafening before a large wave of sound washed over him.  ‘Now the fun really starts,’ he thought with a sigh before silencing the others and telling them what he had both been told and had observed. ‘It’s going to be a loooooooong night.’
“If it does, then between the three of us, we should be able to occupy his mind long enough so he doesn’t demolish the house only to rebuild it by hand.”
As predicted around ten owls landed before Tobias and Draco while another eight hovered nearby as the boys started to remove The Packages of various shapes and sizes.
“Wonderful!” Luna chirped. “You will need roughly fifty Galleons each transferred into pounds to have enough money to buy us all breakfast, lunch and supper and around fifty to a hundred sickles for if you find anything you like. We will get back to you with a day, time and details.”
Tobias smiled at her before biting into his breakfast, making those who could see him go green.
“Of course, Neogennito. I will tell you when it is time to leave also.”
“To be honest,” a new voice from in front of them said, making them both jump in shock. “I think that Alpha is the only one who Beta would ever act like this with.”
Draco rolled his eyes good naturedly and obediently opened his mouth. He struggled to chew and swallow the bite but the tears on his face revealed to everyone who could see them at how hard he had to fight the instinct to spit it out.
And when words are not enough
“Have a big night, huh Nev?” he asked slyly, wriggling his eyebrows. “Care to tell us who she is?”
“For those who do not yet know,” Minerva announced as the last student took their seat, “Two days ago we finished going through the students. AS of tomorrow – which is a Thursday for those who don’t know – We will be getting back into our usual routine. Today, use this time to read over your books and finish off the work sheets. The only students who will be excused for not doing the entire thing are the students from fifth, sixth and seventh year due to the sheets being harder and because they had the least amount of time to do them in. This does NOT mean that they have an excuse for not having done any of them.”
“That you.”
Severus couldn’t keep himself from staring at the transfiguration teacher in shock. The other teachers were silent.
“Mmm, Draco,” Tobias moaned into his mouth. “No touching … not yet.” He pulled away and moved to a small raised patch of hardened dirt.
“What’s wrong?” George asked, “What did you find?”
“It would be easier for us to remove any magical damage from first and second years, as well as safer for them, to go through them first. Less time for the magic to settle into their core,” Lady Greengrass stated softly. “Third and fourth years are too far behind young Mr Malfoy-Black to have been too heavily dosed, if at all, and as Amelia said, none of the students in seventh year has been noticed interacting with the victim of these attacks, so it stands to reason that they would not be overly interfered with.”
Chapter 45
“Charlie is a good bloke to talk to about animals. He’s almost a walking encyclopaedia on Dragons and Romania. I’m not talking about the things you can get from a book either, Hermione. I’m talking about the experience you get only by talking to someone who is passionate about that topic and can make shovelling Dragon shit for sixteen hours a day sound like heaven. Someone who is so enamoured that they can talk for days on end about the subject.”
“All right. Now that I’m in this house, Old Bumblefuck up there is going to be more interested in the students here, particularly those of the sixth and seventh years. Be prepared for anything, and I mean anything - Bribes, threats, extra days out of the castle, fewer detentions and the like. First through sixth years, you are to say nothing but the fact that you are loyal to Draco. Not me, not my father. Understand?”
“That’s what I’m afraid of,” Lucius muttered into the now barren room, before following his oldest friend.
Chapter 9
“Hey! I may be a businessman and dangerous when my family is threatened, but my Son has a grandchild for me to spoil growing inside him. I have the right to act like a child on Christmas morning!”
My fair lady.”
The four bowed. “We accept,” they chorused in unison.
“That promise stands, no matter what – even if I need to get on my hands and knees in the Great Hall in the middle of the welcoming feast and beg. And Bi?” He waits until the boy is looking at him again. “If you don’t go, you’ll never get to see me with red and gold hair.”
Tobias sat in Severus’ private lab with a sigh of relief. It had been four days since it had been announced that he was pregnant and the only time he had any time to himself was when he was in his godfather’s private rooms. He was thankful for the other Slytherin’s but the rest of the school was driving him insane! Not to mention that the Headmaster and Madam Pomphrey kept hassling him to get a check-up with the School Matron. He sighed. He hoped that the heard from his father soon about the N.E.W.Ts. Living here was hell at the moment. He was so glad that tomorrow was Saturday.
“I am assuming that you passed fully cleared,” Tobias asked with a smile.
Tobias started to cry again. “Dumbledore releases me, but keeps Draco – as I-insurance. I-I come here and find Pateras. We – We sit and talk for a while. I-I hug him and say I’m so sorry, but I have to save Draco. Pateras simply says, “I know” and that he is proud of me. I whisper ‘Goodbye” before pointing my wand at his back and whisper “Avada Kedavra” and he dies while I hold him. I feel the life leave his body and something inside me breaks, never to mend. I–I apparate with Pateras’ body to where Dumbles is keeping Draco. When he sees me with dad’s body, Dumbles points his want at Draco and utters the words “Convulsus pectus pectoris a-and D-Dra-k-cos’s h-heart e-explodes, killing him.”
Half an hour later, Severus walked into the classroom, followed by three green students who gave Tobias a wide berth. Tobias just smirked at them. Draco raised an eyebrow to which Tobias just grinned.
“Are the students giving you that hard a time?” Filius asked, worried.
Chapter 32
“You bring shame to yourself and dishonour to the Patil family,” Padma stated firmly. “You called a respected member of an old and ancient house a derogative term, without proof I might add, before his pregnant bonded; You knowingly disrespected a powerful man who is not only the heir of more than one family with more power to their name than our own, but is pregnant with the heir of another. Soon after this you insulted the two biggest names in the business world by insinuating that they are of lesser worth than you and finally, you sully your own honour by challenging the Patriarch of your family and accusing him of selling his own child into slavery.”
Remus smiled and bowed slightly. Tobias smiled.
Draco, Blaise, Theo and Pansy watched in amusement as Tobias and Vincent paced before the empty photo frame.
To everyone’s shock, she did so, gulping at the venomous looks being sent her way from her father and younger sister.
Amelia gaped at the older woman in shock. Minerva nodded slightly.
Draco growled deep in his throat after trying – and failing – to deepen the kiss his husband had started. After several more failed attempts, he took matters into his own hands and lay down slowly. Smirking to himself, he quickly flipped over, eliciting a whimper of delight from the delectable man that was now beneath him.
“Over the years there were some teachers who would ask their top students if they would mind volunteering a little f their time to tutor some of the younger students, but once more, it got cancelled by the new Headmaster. He put in new desks which separated the students from each other, so it was uncomfortable for them to work together to improve themselves. Then he started cancelling the school maps and subject guide books and eventually he stopped supplying new resources to the library so even though there are new magics being created every day around the world, we – the staff – cannot teach it to the students because we have no information on them.”
“We already know this Deloris,” Amelia Bones piped up from the other side of the small group. “And if I remember correctly, I was the one who was put in charge of this investigation, not you. Now, does anyone – make that anyone of importance," Amelia narrowed her eyes in the direction of the monster-in-pink as she opened her mouth, “have anything to say?”
Luna leaned back and looked at the ceiling. She was in the Great Hall writing down everything noteworthy she had done in a letter for her Father. As usual she used the code that her parents had made between them for times of unrest, and so her letter was full of Nargals, Crumple-horned Snorkacs, Glitterpuffs and other creatures they had invented to represent the people in their lives. She was now almost finished the ten inch letter and had re-read it twice, trying to remember what she had left out.
The owl bobbed its head and held out a talon. Ginny carefully removed the letter and read it while Luna absent-mindedly scratched the owl’s head.
Eyes sparkling with malicious intent, the old man leant over his desk – parchment and quill before him, to plan his attack.
Tobias chuckled in amusement. “So I was, so I was,” he leant back against Draco with a happy sigh.
Hermione broke down and told her the entire story – from reading the paper that morning so long ago, the urge to report everything Dumbledore had ordered her to do to the memories that battered her every minute of the day.
“Are you alright?” the motherly voice of Mrs Williams asked.
“I do promise.”
Tobias beamed at the two Daemon as the both disappeared.
Tobias looked at the babe in Draco’s arms and almost cooed. When she had first been born, she had no hair, black eyes and was an angry red, wrinkled alien-like creature; not that it made him love her any less – and now she was still hairless, a fact that was hidden by the cute knitted cap on her head, her eyes were slowly starting to lighten and her red, wrinkled skin had started to pale slightly and smooth out. She had also started smiling that very morning, brining tears to her Grandpa Tom’s eyes when she smiled her precious first smile at him.
The last thing Ron heard before passing out were the eerily beautiful voices combine once more.
Bill smirked in agreement; that was the reason he had taken the International Gringotts job rather than the one with the Unspeakables, after all.
Cornelius Fudge looked over the four tables with an internal smirk. His lord had told him exactly what was going on and he’d had to laugh. Who would have thought that the Boy-Who-Lived would turn to the Dark Lord for salvation! He had also come up with the best idea for how to get The Pack to sit for their N.E.W.Ts without anyone getting suspicious.
Lucius glared at his son who just chuckled, not at all worried.
“Not a hundred percent clear,” George said with a chuckle, “but close enough.”
“Sounds like your perfect job if that is the case Pavarti,” Padma replied without missing a beat, “I’m sure that when Father has finished discussing the terms of my marriage contract he would be willing to discuss terms of your bonding to a cart-goblin.”
“Amelia,” Lucius greeted as he joined her as she made her way back to the Great Hall after the small break they were on between years finished.
“You look like a needy slut dressed the way you are,” Harry whispered heatedly into Draco’s ear. “Only sluts wear such clothing while working in a Lord’s Manor. Tonight, you will be nothing but a whore to be used. You will not cum unless I let you and you will do EVERYTHING I say.”
Tobias moaned softly under the assault and sub-consciously wrapped his legs around his husband’s waist and pushed up, electing a moan from Draco. He did it again, only to have Draco push down and rub his groin on Tobias’ at the same time. Moaning with the pleasure caused between strong friction and smooth silk, neither of them lasted long. Draco collapsed to the side of Tobias, panting slightly and trying to adjust his now wet pants.
“You’re welcome Severus. I’m just ashamed it has taken so long for me to do it.”
“Shh,” Tobias said with a quick sip of his favourite drink. “Sleeping.”
Tom Riddle/Randal Jones/Voldemort – Pateras [Father]
Tom smiled. “I would like to take you out for lunch then go shopping for both Christmas and something for us to do as father and son. Have you ever been to India?”
He looked up at that moment and flushed slightly at the sight of a very amused Severus, Minerva and Xenophillus and a slightly-more-than-shocked Lord Patil. Within the blink of an eye, Draco’s shoulders snapped back, had dismissed Lord Patil as being unimportant and bowed to Xenophillus. “Mr Lovegood, how is Luna fairing?”
By lunch time, Draco was beyond worried. Tobias had had trouble staying awake the whole morning, so after he had eaten, he’d gone looking for his godfather. He found him hovering over one of his potions.
She let out a soft sob as the memory ended, feeling tears roll down her cheeks. She ran from the classroom as the next memory started – watching a news bulletin about a triple homicide occurring in Surrey, discovering it was Harry’s family and blaming it on him with questioning it – not even when the neighbours reported the begging, the pleading and the screams that came from the house at all hours of the day and even though they called the police nothing was done.
Dobby beamed. “Dobby accepts sir!”
Wash away, wash away.
Remus fought the flinch at the tear-filled, heart-broken statement. Slowly he pulled a chain out from underneath his robe, revealing the position of the missing ring. “I had to remove it,” he whispered, lowering his eyes, unable to look his mate in the eye as he made his confession. “I don’t deserve to wear it,” he clarified, fighting tears of his own as he smelt salt coming from the slighter man. “You have shown me – proven to me - that you are worthy of my heart and soul, but I haven’t done anything to prove that I am worthy of yours. I cannot, in good conscience, wear a symbol of the depth of your devotion to me if I have done nothing to earn or prove that I am just as, if not more so, devoted to you.”
“WHAT THE BLOODY HELL WAS THAT FOR!”
“Lucius please, at least for this,” the blonde man said with a sigh, “I’ve come as Lucius-the-Father rather than Lucius-the-Malfoy-Lord.”
Ginny nodded and set her alarm. “Meditate in the morning?”
“Anything I can do to help?”
Hearing a gurgle behind him, Severus turned sharply and watched as Harry threw up once again, but seeing spots of bright red mixed with the contents of his stomach, he yelled, “Lucius! Get in here now! We need to remove them!”
“It does Alpha,” Vincent said with a small smile, “and if you don’t mind, I would rather Kyria be the first to see it.”
“That is true,” Tobias mused as he too returned to his breakfast, easily pushing the disturbing vision out of his mind with practiced ease. “I have faith in them,” he added softly as he rubbed his growing bump, smiling softly as he felt a slightly stronger flutter than the previous day.
“What was it that he said?”
“How do you feel about organising a bonding ceremony?”
-Flashback-
“”Y-you? Why?”
Draco rushed through the rooms in the Chamber of Secrets, looking for his wayward husband. He scowled as every room he checked turned out to be lacking the person he was looking for. The scowl deepened when the only room left to search was Tobias’ study.
Draco shook his head. He was still in shock at the change in his husband.
Draco laughed and nodded. “Then add on the fact that he is also carrying the next Malfoy heir, so he got the added magical protection boost for that …”
The three men waited in silence until they heard a happy yip come from upstairs. This time they allowed themselves to release the breaths they were holding and talk about what they had discovered in detail. They all agreed to not tell Draco until after the two of them were bonded. This decided, Sev and Lucius prepared to leave. Before going, however, the three of them looked into Tobias’ rooms, where they found him in wolf form curled up with his nose buried in the shirt Draco had been wearing that day. Severus smiled. It seemed that he’d done the right thing in asking Remus to get Draco’s shirt from the laundry before it could be washed.
“What were you doing all day?”
“Well, I’m happy, and bubbly, and can’t stop grinning, bouncing or talking. Food sounds good right about now and I feel like I should be angry with you, but I can’t be bothered being upset at the moment.”
Lucius knelt at his Lord’s feet. “Our guests, milord, as you have requested.”
“We do. You Father came to wake you and he came out pale and shaking,” Severus explained. “We thought that something bad had happened so we came to see what we could do. However, it seems that all that was wrong was your sheets had slipped and he saw a slight bit too much for his own mental health.”
Subconsciously, Cornelius shuddered.
“You wanted to ensure that you caught everyone at once,” the man on his left said with a half-smirk.
“They know what to look for and are exempt from the Oaths we have needed to give since they were added as a precaution,” Fred explained.
“So, Har … Tobias,” Lucius spoke ... eventually.
Remus growled at them again. Everyone, including Draco, stepped back as Tobias’ temper flared.
Looking at each other, Vince and Greg stepped forward so that they could take him up to their dormitory. Draco was on his knees, hugging himself and silently thanking the gods that Tobias was all right, relief in all lines of his body.
“Sorry about that,” he said as he lifted the lid. “He’s a marvellous cook and good with money, but absolutely horrible with anything that is deemed company. Dig in!”
Luna watched with a smirk as he looked around for any sign of whom ever was responsible for his current predicament. Remaining cloaked in her magic, Luna started to prowl around the outskirts of the room.
“Together,” the newly woken blonde answered as he stretched. “It’s not that I don’t trust you but … I don’t trust you.”
“I would prefer it if you were to start it after Dumbles is removed from the school, so that leaves you with a few months to prepare everything for it. You are going to need to get specialised gloves and clothes so that nothing will harm you. I suggest writing to Bill about it and then you are going to need to start listing everything you will need. When you have the lists ready, bring them to me and we will discuss everything you have and you are going to need to have good reasons to have everything you write on the list.”
Draco sat at the table and started piling food onto two plates as Tobias lead the two silent men out into the next room. Lucius noticed a flash of reflected light and searched for its origin. His eyes widened when he managed to glimpse the ring on his son’s finger. Hopefully this means a wedding for Narcissa to prepare.
“Allow me to call for sustenance,” the goblin stated. “My brother is a very good cook. I’m sure he will have made a variety of foods that will be safe for you to eat.”
Stopping at the entrance of the dining room, Harry crossed his wrists, placed his fingertips to his shoulders and bowed, murmuring a prayer to the room.  Walking to Voldemort, he bowed deeply, until his forehead touched the ground and murmured a blessing before sitting on his legs and looked the man in the eye.
“I see,” the man murmured, hope alighting itself in his chest. “What occurred in your first lesson with the accused?”
“Who is the chosen bride?” Grapplefang asked once more, impressed that the young wizard before him understood the necessity of the ritualised form of conduct.
“I may like acting the part of a slut in the privacy of my own rooms, Weasley, but it’s always and forever for one man and one man only. The Wizengamot cleared Professor Snape because he was innocent – not because someone slept with them. Also, the room is spelled so any vote cast by a member who has taken a bribe is null and void, resulting in the guilty party being dishonourably dismissed from his or her position in the voting body.”
When Blaise, Vince, Greg and Theodore went to bed to be ready for the next morning and the first day of lessons, they all smiled inwardly at the sight that met them. Draco had climbed onto Tobias’ bed and had curled into him, his head on the dark-haired youth’s chest. He had a small smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. As quietly and gently as they could, Theodore and Blaise covered Draco with one of the blankets off his own bed before getting ready for bed themselves.
The other two nodded as the three of them separated to go to separate classes.
For the first time in nearly three generations, Madam Pince smiled at the student.
Minerva smiled to herself as she watched the group Severus had described as a pack. She didn’t know who the members were, but she suspected the entire Slytherin sixth year was a big part of it.
The next three weeks passed quickly for the Slytherins. Between meals, classes and homework, Tobias found it hard to find time to continue with the Chamber. He still had the weekends though, so he spent much of his time then either studying or cleaning.
--END FLASHBACK—
“If you don’t mind my asking … Have you plans for this evening?”
Starting to move to the music, Tobias allowed himself to melt into Draco’s embrace. “This is wonderful, Draco. I think we should do stuff like this more often.”
Severus looked from the vial, to Tobias, then to Draco. “May I?” At Draco’s nod, he gently removed the vial from Draco’s hand. Sitting in his chair, he allowed his magic to test the potion’s magical signature. He raised awe-filled eyes to Draco’s. “He is the maker of this potion, Draco.” Severus bowed deeply to Tobias.
“What, may I ask, is he doing this close to my son?” Randal asked.
Working quickly yet gently, Severus administered the potions and started to clean the boy of what blood and dirt he could.  He found, very much to his anger, that the bands around Harry’s wrists, ankles and neck didn’t respond to a simple unlocking charm, and on a closer inspection he discovered the presence of magic dampening spells in the metal.  What was worse, in his mind, was that he could sense the presence of not one magical signature, but three – The headmasters, and those of Harry’s two supposed best friends Hermione Granger and Ronald Weasley.
“In his words,” Minerva cut in with a rarely seen twinkle in her eye, “Getting away from all the brats. You wouldn’t believe they were all at least thirty with the way they act’.”
“Hello my Dragon,” Tobias whispered into his ear, making him shiver.
Harry awoke from his faint while Severus was cleaning the dried blood from his eyes.
It was the last day of term and the Headmaster was looking at the stay list in astonishment. For the first time in the history of Hogwarts, there were no students staying for the break. He sighed. This meant that none of the Professors had to stay. His eyes twinkled as a thought came to him. He could use this time to make an attack on that Tobias kid. He grinned. This will be like taking candy from a baby. Speaking of candy – he reached for a new packet of sherbet lemons.
My Fair Lady”
Return to School ... Yay ...
“And why would I be interested in this … product?”
Disclaimer: I do not own anything in the Harry Potter verse, and I’m very happy about this as no one would buy the version I would write unless they were hopeless perverts, much like myself.
Severus looked into Remus’ eyes, frantically searching for any sign of hesitation, annoyance or disgust and when he found nothing but nervous hope and pleading he whispered, “I, Severus Tobias Snape give my consent to Remus John Lupin to court me by way of the moon’s children.”
Everyone in the room went silent as a loud pop sounded.
“He … She … Our baby … really?” Draco asked in a horse whisper, eyes not leaving his husband’s hands.
“One more then I’ll leave. Question: What is the worst thing that can happen in a Potion’s Lab? Answer: Getting taught by Professor Snape while working with Slytherins and needing to touch icky squishy stuff.”
“You’ll see when we decide to change.”
“Mr Malfoy. Mr Black. It is an honour to be here. I am Ruen and this is my son, R’thir. We are in charge of your food and drink tonight. Mr Snape bids me to give you this.” He pulled Tobias’ potion from a woven bag.
Tobias took another careful sip of the strange cocktail in his hand before continuing.
“Come to us.”
“Tobias,” he said with forced calm, “Minerva isn’t going to harm them and you can’t keep doing that. You need to rest to recover from their morning.”
To goblin grinned at the man and shuffled his papers. “We have gone through both contracts and discovered that one of them can be cancelled as it was signed without a magical signature that matched your own Lord Patil.”
“Tobias made an oath to destroy everyone involved in his treatment. This oath will force each person to feel everything each of their victims had to feel due to their part of the plan. Your magic made a deal with someone else’s to protect you from the worst of it. Think of that before fighting even more against it. Also be thankful that all your Master wants you to do is report on the Headmaster – they could just as easily turn you into the school tramp and no one could do anything about it.”
“We will explain what we can,” the dark-haired man said with a sigh, much to everyone’s shock, “but I will NOT break the trust he has given me, so don’t even think of asking for more.”
Luna winced. “Intense.”
Draco nodded as he turned on the hot water. “Yes  - And it is going to be an eventful meeting tonight.”
I know I promised you forever
His brown and gold Eagle Quill and his favourite Slytherin green inkwell were placed at the top of the desk in the centre. To the top left was a line of inkwells full of red, blue, black and silver inks. In the top right corner was a wizard’s photo in a blue, green and silver frame of him and his son – taken after the Death Eater meeting several weeks ago.
A wolf’s howl trembled in the air. Both girls grinned and Ginny sat up excitedly. “They’re coming!”
Harry murmured something into Draco’s chest that made him chuckle softly.
“You really are becoming quite the paper-shuffler aren’t you?” the older man smirked.
Tobias grinned, easily sliding into the teaching roll he used when someone was having trouble understanding an assignment. “If I had used muggle grown cannabis, that would have been the case, Arpakitiko, but if you think back, I said ‘muggle cannabis grown in a magical environment.’ This combination creates a more … potent ingredient – much more potent than magical cannabis. As for how much I used in the potion – it is three seeds and a bud for 25 litres.”
“What was that, Gios?” Tom asked, humour evident in his eyes.
“I can feel her,” he whispered softly. “Draco, I can feel our baby move!”
Remus stood in the doorway looking at his broken mate with a heavy heart. He was the cause of the downfall of that proud man and he felt utterly horrified at the knowledge. He was broken out of his depreciating thoughts by a throat being cleared. He moved to one side and waited until the door closed before walking closer to the now trembling man.
The house-elf trembled more violently. “M-Mimpsie not find m-much f-fruit f-for Master.”
To the surprise of everyone in hearing range, Severus started to sob softly as he clung to the young man in his lap. “I’m sorry, Please don’t ignore me again.”
“Stop fretting Nonos,” Tobias whispered, running a finger slowly down the page before him. “Lykos will love it and he won’t reject you. I know you are nervous, but you are disturbing the class and keeping them from working. IF you can’t calm down on your own, then I’ll have to give you some suggestions. I’ll give you thirty minutes to calm down, or you can give us the weekend to complete these notes and the four-and-a-half foot essay on the differences between the different types of healing potion groups, including examples ranging from ‘a potato can brew’ to ‘don’t even think of reading unless you are a master’. Then you can leave us here at Hogwarts while you go out for a romantic lunch-for-two with Lykos. Drakontas and I will make sure the snakes complete the task. You have no problems with most of the Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw students – and who really cares about whether or not any of the Gryffindor goons complete it?”
A gentle pat on his foot told him that he had been heard and he turned to his meal with a slight grimace. Dobby’s food was better.
Draco grinned. “You know I will, Bi. I will be up as soon as I finish.”
Draco waited patiently for Tobias to wash and change into his school uniform. Thinking over everything that had occurred since the day Sev had stormed into his father’s study; he started to giggle … Giggle? Malfoy’s do not giggle! He fought to stop giggling before he was heard. Tobias’ arms wrapped around him once more.
Severus downed another shot of Scotch, unaware that Lucius and Voldemort – who had just told those closest to him to call him Tom in private – watching him sadly. They knew that this was the only way to punish Severus properly. Not even one full day and the man was already drunk. The two men were almost sorry for the students the normally bitter man taught, they also agreed that neither man would ever keep the two apart. A rather Slytherin approach, they had to agree.
Harry let out a dark chuckle and harshly bit the arse cheek that he was resting on. “Are you so desperate a slut that you can’t wait for a proper stretching?” he chuckled again when an aroused mewl came from his pet. “Well then, better hold on.”
Chapter 31
Lunch for The Pack was silent and tense. Luna and Ginny had appeared over an hour before hand looking as though someone had painted them in whitewash before trying to remove it after it had mostly dried. Neither girl would say what had happened, only telling the pregnant teen that he would find out in the next day or two, depending on how long it took their healer and overseer to do their reports and send it. It surprised no-one when Tobias announced there would be a full Pack meeting three days from today and vanished to write meeting notices to their missing members.
“Rule one. Only we five are to know what you are doing until I decide to tell everyone else. Rule two. You are to work together at all times. If the best way of doing something is with only one of you, I expect you to tell the other before it occurs. Rule three. You are to write an individual report each at the end of every week and a combined report at the end of each thing you complete. Do you accept?”
Albus Dumbledore scowled at the child before him. “I deserve your respect boy,” he spat, ignoring the incredulous looks he was getting from the spectators.
“If you don’t mind my asking,” Padma asked one of the goblins before them. “Is it true that the goblin nation is predominantly Matriarchal rather than Patriarchal?”
Severus nodded, turning back to his potion before Draco had left the room.
“It is not only the children that have suffered I’m afraid,” Amelia stated. “It was bought to my attention last night that while under the control of Headmasters Dippett and Dumbledore, the building and grounds of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry have been neglected and purposefully used in ways that endanger the lives of those within her allowed halls.”
“To my left are Madam Elisabeth Greengrass.”
“I missed you too, Tobias.”
Ron’s mind snapped to attention as he felt warm smoke rising around him as he felt himself rise into the upper reaches of the ravine. He opened his eyes to see a mist man smoking a mist pipe with the smoke from the pipe pushing him and the remnants of the bridge up towards where he started. He wriggled slightly, noting excitedly that the ropes around him were looser.
Nodding, the Slytherins settled around the room in silence. After a few moments, Tobias spoke again. “What are we doing this fine weekend?”
“How about we do to you what Tobias did to him,” a female voice sneered.
(Agnes Hayes Post – Rainbow Tressure)
“I can’t believe it! Both Malfoys and Snape are traitors to our Lord! How dare they. Why should we listen to them anymore? When the Dark Lord hears of this, I hope I’m there to watch him punish them. They deserve nothing less than Crucio for this! And Potter –”
“After all,” Tobias continued with a soft smile, “you cannot have a proper girl’s night without Pansy and Millicent – and since it is a Friday night, how about inviting the younger year girls as well? I’m sure Dobby will know of a trust-worthy elf that will take care of your food and drink needs for the night.”
“Hi,” he answered quietly.
Tobias started to whimper and moved his hips in time to Draco’s thrusts, causing Draco to be pushed deeper. Draco started to thrust with purpose, no longer scared of hurting his husband and after three more thrusts, he managed to hit Tobias’ prostate.
Ron sobbed  in terror as a pair of intense eyes appeared out of the mist and most of the hands disappeared, only to quickly reappear to snatch small pieces of the precious materials before vanishing once again. The bridge was still slowly inching towards the bottom of the ravine.
Tobias ignored him and continued to remove vials until he removed a blood red one. He looked around for the house-elf and growled when he couldn’t find it. Flashing out, he left a still giggling Dark Lord, worried Death Eaters and an amused Pack. When he returned he had hold of the vial he had requested and was muttering dark thoughts towards house-elves in general. Everyone watched in fascination as he added drops of multiple liquids to it. Shaking it lightly, he handed the vial to his father.
He took his precious burden into their room and tucked him into their bed before leaving a note on his own  pillow before heading out to try to get comfortable on the very uncomfortable and lumpy lounge that had been put into their room for storage.
“And what did you say?”
Poppy looked from the head table, to Draco, to the doors Harry just left through, then back to the head table. “Well, that went well. He came to see me earlier this morning feeling a bit under the weather. As you can see, he didn’t react all that well to the problem he ha …”
“Glad to see we were taught by smart people then,” Fred stated with a grin.
As the Weasleys were urged to their seats, the questions they had started to fly.
“Draco,” he purred again as he curled around the shell-shocked blonde. He stopped when he was standing nose-to-nose with his husband. Smirking, he leant forwards until he could see the blonde hairs around Draco’s ear flutter softly with his breath. “I can’t believe it is time,” he whispered, relishing the slight shiver it caused the other boy. “I can’t wait for you to claim me, to mark me. To make me yours and yours alone.”
This was attached to a set of three expandable metal rings by Acromentula silk that had been soaked in dragon’s blood – making it near indestructible. The first ring sat just behind the fringe of the mushroom head while the second and third rings cradled the bulge that was the result of the first piece of the device. Along with the Acromentula silk, a thin strip of steel ran down the underside of the bound cock.
Before the elf could reply, a young voice floated down the stairs.
Severus gave a half-smirk and bowed his head in acknowledgment.
“Oh, we had a bit of a problem last night concerning Tobias,” Narcissa stated, ignoring the laughter coming from the Hallway.
“What has he done now?” Remus asked, recovering before Lucius since he was used to Sirius Black and James Potter.
“I think we should all eat now though,” Theo announced. “What do you want Draco, Bi? I’ll get it for you so you can both just sit and relax a bit.”
“Sev, I can’t wake up from that dream. I get caught in it a-and I can’t make sure my Draco is safe a-and no one can h-hear m-me sc-scream.”
Fred heaved a sigh of relief while simultaneously shooting his brother a pitying look. Padma, to Tobias’ interest, looked both relieved and angry.
“I’ve sent them a letter with one of their owls,” Tobias mumbled sleepily, ‘telling them they will be receiving the same medical care that we are due to their closeness to me in our younger years. If you tell me when the last of the seventh years are in the examination rooms, I’ll send for my twins.”
“Ah, Miss Umbitch – sorry – Umbridge. I see you have recovered from your time with the centaurs. They do know how to celebrate, don’t they?” Tobias stretched lazily. “How are things going in your campaign against half-breeds? Pity about the Vampire Laws not going through, I mean, how could they not see that they are dark creatures because they need blood to survive? How could they also not see that creating blood banks where they can go to get blood taken cleanly so that no one is killed will make them more dangerous as they will attack more humans?”
“Luna is Pack,” Draco stated with a shrug as though that explained everything. “She is just as important to us as we are to her,” He frowned thoughtfully. “Is it only your blood that she needs or can others donate theirs to her in case she needs it fast?”
“The young lady is now unable to carry a child full term due to internal spell damage,” Minerva stated with a wince. “The son removed himself from the family and took on his wife’s maiden name and revealed that not only was his wife’s family the owner of his father’s workplace, but they were the fifth richest family in the Americas when they told him they were cutting all money from him.”
Harry nodded his understanding, and then playing with the band on his left wrist he asked, “Why did they do it, Professor? I thought they were my friends, but they betrayed me by taking away my only weapon. I know I cannot use magic out of school, but just the threat that I could lose my temper and have it escape my control scared the muggles enough for them to leave me alone.”
As he finished reading the article, Tobias’ eyes were lit with suppressed glee. Operation Twinkle-Toes was being set up. Keeping his face as neutral as he could, he pushed his spare copy of the paper in front of Draco then turned the page of his paper, enjoying the sudden silence that had overcome the Great Hall for the third time in as many days.
Half an hour later, Poppy walked quietly into the room to find both boys on one narrow bed in what had to be the most uncomfortable position. Silently, she scanned both boys and healed the injuries that remained before enlarging the bed to accommodate them both. She watched as Harry moved to the centre of the bed, pulling Draco with him. She smiled as Harry curled around Draco, who had his face nestled into the centre of Harry’s chest and his legs tangled with the sheets and with Harry’s legs.
“I’m taking that as a yes,” Rowena chuckled.
“You need to be aware, Mr Snape, that Daemon children are rare things. As such, we view all children as miracles – and this child wasn’t just any child. He had the Mother’s interest, so we sort of gave him our protection.”
“Ron will be here soon,” Neville murmured to her, a strange gleam in his eye. “Hey Theo, do you think I can try? I promise not to break it,” he teased making everyone who heard him laugh.
“We wish to exchange brides,” Tobias stated. “George and Pavarti are far too different to be compatible.”
“I will ask around,” the goblin said. “I’m assuming that species in irrelevant?”
The thought of his husband with his stomach distended and full of a child he helped create was almost enough to agree to have as many children as Tobias wanted. Almost being the operative word there. He would have to see how his husband handled his first pregnancy before agreeing to more than two. His thoughts were disrupted by a hand waving in front of his face. He jumped, much to the amusement of the man before him
Harry chuckled. “I understand. I have Ron as a friend, remember? I think he’s harder to teach than Goyle because he’s such a mule-headed idiot.”
The two men chuckled and Lucius caressed the fang gently. “I can’t believe how big that thing was.” Severus nodded in agreement.
“You mean Tobias didn’t tell you?” Minerva asked in surprise. “I sent him an owl last night telling him I’d be here.”
Booph smirked – a particularly evil look on the Shadow Daemon. “Our contracts say ‘killing’ not ‘torture’, Akzant’tra.”
“Because he earned my respect and my Lord wished to see if his heir and my heir were compatible enough for our lines to join. To our joy, they were and found love in each other.”
Godric gave a half-smile. “For magical beings, the magic comes from their mother or bearer. This, as well as the mixed up hormones in their brains, are going to make them a bit different personality wise.”
By the time the bridge was solid once more, Ron was almost sobbing in relief – or he was until the building materials changed to said iron and steel. He let out a high-pitched screech before starting to hyperventilate due to the red-hot burning that occurred when placing icy-cold metal onto heated flesh. The soprano voice rang through the area once again, this time with a smug undertone to it.
Moving slowly, the Healer removed a camera from her healer’s bag and snapped a picture. Looking up after she had put the camera away, she found herself looking into a pair of human eyes.
Harry shrugged. “That he was a strict teacher. One who would be hard to impress and who wouldn’t stand for the mumbo-jumbo bullshit of children unwilling to take him or his classes seriously. I also was under the impression that he disliked me.”
These two had only just signed their contract the previous night, but the emotional tie was the strongest they had ever seen before between two people. Both Slytherins pitied the person who tried to harm or separate the two of them. If they were like this after two days, they wouldn’t be surprised to find the two of them married, if not bonded before the end of that year. They silently wished the two boys well – It was evident that they were made for each other.
Draco smirked in satisfaction, as his husband became a pliable puddle of goo beneath his fingers. He now had knowledge of two of his husband’s weaknesses – and he would exploit them if he thought it would do his – and Tobias – health good. He worked slowly but steadily on the muscles presented to him until he only had the one spot he desperately wanted to touch left – his beloved’s firm rear end.
“What do you think the children are planning for their schooling?”
“What is going on here Bi?” he asked, watching as something was crossed out on several pieces of parchment that were scattered around the room.
“I know that I haven’t said it much, and contrary to how I treated you when you were younger, I am, and have always been proud of you Neville. You are deserving of the Longbottom heritage – and I am honoured and proud to have you as my grandson.”
And after all this time my heart still burns for you
“Yes,” Tobias pouted. “Draco’s being mean. He told me to keep eating and took my stuff from me.”
“Fifth, sixth and seventh years remain in your seats after finyou finish eating,” Minerva finished, glaring at – the youngest Weasley male, not knowing it wasn’t him. “The rest of you spend your time wisely.”
Remus carefully inched towards the prone animal.
“Lead the way,” Lucius smirked. It had been a while since he and his heir had time to bond. This was something he was looking forward to. Except … “Are you sure about not telling Tobias about this?”
“So my Raven has started his family,” a female voice said, causing all of The Pack – including Padma – and Severus to kneel in respect.
Theodore stepped forward and gently took the scroll in his hands, unravelling it before he nodded, closed it and returned to his original position.
Settling in, he reached for the shortest letter, which was from Tom. He slowly read the three inch letter through three times before putting pen to paper and, for the second time in his life, he wrote a brutally honest answer in reply to the Dark Lord’s missive. Checking the time, he turned to the letter that stank of old money.
“The two of you are being punished together. I know that it was nonos who is responsible – so he will be getting a much harsher punishment.” Closing his eyes, Tobias scratched a design into his forearm then touched his wand to it. Severus tensed as the design was slowly and painfully cut into his flesh. Tobias opened his eyes.
“I need a partner who can keep up with me, my brother and whoever my brother chooses to bond with. They need to be able to keep secrets because they will be working closely with both Fred and I on our produce as well as being integrated into Our Pack. The last and most important item on the list is that they not be scared to kick my and Fred’s rears when we get into our phases.”
Tobias shook his head and closed his eyes. “It started when I started being punished for doing magic. I always believed that no one came to my cupboard because they didn’t care. Well, that was partially true.” He looked up at Severus. “What you witnessed when you found me? There is a reason he never had the chance to do that before this summer. My magic kept anyone who wished to harm me away from where I was the most vulnerable. The longer the protective magic was around me, the closer it bonded with me - not as my own magic, but as a magical entity, it developed into a guardian for me. This guardian was always a carnivorous animal, but was never the same animal two days running. Sometimes it would be a wolf, then a big cat, reptile, bird or fish. I’ve had serpents – including basilisks – Dragons, gryphons, hippogriffs.”
At ten o’clock exactly, Luna, Ginny and Neville disappeared without a sound and all lights bar fourteen candles went out. The candles were numbered one through seven and had either a pink or blue flame. The students followed the candles to their rooms, smiling at the still sleeping couple as they passed them. Before the sixth year students left the room, they transfigured the lounge into a bed with warm blankets and covered the sleeping couple, not knowing that the next morning would be the first time that Tobias would not be awake before everyone else.
“Thank you for asking, now, whose books haven’t been recorded?”
Tom chuckled and clicked his fingers, causing a house-elf to appear. Tobias growled softly.
The other three founders, Draco, Severus and Remus winced, not knowing how Tobias was going to react.
“Fate.”
“Tobias, Draco and I were hoping that you would be amiable to having a nightcap with us after the evening meal, thus giving us the opportunity to have a private word with you about something that is very soon to be put in place.”
The owl bobbed its head in answer and flew back out the window after dropping the letter on the table. Without hesitation, Minerva shot spells of detection towards it before handling it to Severus, who read it without betraying his thoughts. When he was finished, he tapped the letter against his lips.
Blaise nodded still in shock. “Mother isn’t going to want anything to do with me, is she?”
“Yes my mother,” Tobias stated visibly calming.
“I’ll tell you later Bi,” Draco assured his husband. “First you have to have something to eat and recover from this morning.”
Seamus grins and grabs his crotch. “Fuck, dude, I’ve rubbed one off as we’ve been standing here!”
“Meet me in the stacks,” Draco whispers. “Section 550.” A movement and a rustle and Harry’s jacket slides off the back of his chair.
Draco catches her eye, and she scrunches her nose. He blows her a kiss and points himself toward the back of the flat.
She peers into Harry’s bowl. “Harry, your ice cream has melted.”
Those photos torched his favorite pillow.
Luna holds her wand poised above the cake, a plate hovering at the ready. “I’m not sure. Harry, do you want cake or cock?”
But somewhere, buried deep in his amygdala, his neanderthal brain awakens and beats its chest. So
In a delightful and ironic twist of karmic fate, Harry contracted Dragon Pox from Rose and recovery kept him from attending Pansy’s Valentine’s Day birthday celebration. All the better since he didn’t think he would have been safe around birthday candles and Draco in red leather pants hanging off the arm of his current fuck toy, DevonFitzArchibald the Fourth.
vanilla ice cream. Maybe more than treacle tart.
Draco’s blood ignites, flooding his groin. In two long strides, he’s in Harry’s stall, crowding him against the tiles, grinding his erection against him.
Harry rolls his eyes. “Cocky bastard.”
And then, of course, Harry’s teen years had been plagued by Voldemort repeatedly rearing his ugly head and throwing a pall on...
“Force equals mass times acceleration.” Harry bares his teeth.
“Where’s the lie?”
Draco purses his lips, and with a sharp tug to his shirt sleeve and crook of his elbow, checks his watch. “If we leave in the next
salty.” He gives them an obscene gesture, inserting his tongue to waggle between the vee of his two fingers.
“So you polish your rock in the second floor bathroom of the math wing.”
“Out!” Molly barks from the kitchen doorway. She’s holding the Quaffle under one arm, the other hand firmly perched on her hip. It’s a commanding stance, and for a moment, Harry can visualize her outfitted in a Gryffindor red and gold Quidditch uniform.
” He dips his head to lay his tongue over a nipple peeking through delicate lace.
—”a twat.”
The first time Harry sets his office on fire, the flame is tiny, a wee purple tuft that flickers at the corner of the parchment held in his hand.
“I’m already there,” he breathes. He relaxes into the comforting solidity of Draco’s body and nuzzles Draco’s neck, tongue sliding between cold metal and hot flesh.
“I have a spot on my forehead.” Draco frowns.
Harry knows that tucked somewhere between the verdant leaves and iridescent petals of lilies, narcissus, and dahlias, Draco’s skin is marked by a faded evil long banished. Harry hasn’t thought about the Dark Mark for years, doesn’t even notice it anymore.
Harry disentangles himself from Ron’s long limbs. “He did it!”
The leather is still warm, surrounding him in Draco’s residual body heat and scent. Harry’s head spins. Draco’s all over him. His cock throbs.
“I can’t fathom why,” Ginny drawls. She tosses a Quaffle at his head. “You’ve done fuck-all this morning.”
Draco ignores him, eyes focused on turning a page, the paper trembling in his fingers. Harry’s going to kiss those, too. He leans back against the shelf opposite Draco and
Malfoy chuckles blithely. “It’s good to see you, too, Potter,” he says.
“You’re the one pouring out the entire box!”
“It’s been a month,” Harry rasps. “A
“As this was a false alarm,” Theo continues, “I’ll need to see that you’ve got the proper permits in place.”
” Lily exclaims.
“You know how much printing delays cost us,” he says. He sets the document gently down on his desk. “Percy has memoed me twice already.” That second note was a shade of pink shy of being a Howler.
Harry quirks a brow. “Why?”
“I didn’t notice a spot.” How’s he expected to notice
“Blah, blah, blah, pansexual, we know,” Ron says. “Fine. This particular
Draco straightens and frowns. “Are you humming the school song?”
“It’s spelt B-a-l-m-a-i-n,” Draco says. He hikes his trouser leg to half-sit on the desk’s edge and nudges the active quill with his glass. “Get a quill that works.”
“This goes deeper in the organization than we thought—”
“It’s not true, you know,” Harry says. He affects a serious expression.
Harry yanks the keys from the ignition. The plush snowy owl keychain squishes into his palm.
Harry’s neck flames hot. “Bloody hell!”
Draco’s glass suddenly empties.
“Oh!” Luna nods her head decisively. “The Fae took it as payment for using their mushroom ring.”
Spots dot his vision and he gulps air, taking a moment to listen to his heartbeat calm. He tucks himself away, buttons up, and washes his hands.
because Harry’s thigh had been warm and firm beneath Draco’s hand under the table.
, please Obliviate me.” Draco wields his wand, and Ron glares. “Except you!” He flails his legs. ”
“You would,” Pansy says. “Oh for fucks sake, you two tomatoes, kiss already!”
As a rule, Draco has no qualms about the human body naked and on display. He, himself, is often unclothed. As he should be; he’s a fine specimen. And, by extension, the locker room is an appropriate place for wizards to congregate in various stages of undress.
“Velvet really is an unforgiving fabric,” Draco says. He grins smugly and sips.
Harry is so distracted by soft fingers and tart magic, he doesn’t see Draco take his wand from his pocket.
The clouds light up, revealing Malfoy’s face in a kinetoscope series of flashes—earnest, focused, resolute. Like that day in Robards' office when he demanded to be given the mission and Harry was assigned point. Like later that same day in the showers when Harry was on his knees and Malfoy moaned Harry’s name like a prayer.
“You made me do it!” Ron frowns. In addition to the icing on Ron’s jaw, a large smear cuts through his cinched eyebrow.
The only buzzkill is the blank storyboard that is the fashion section.
Draco tugs the hanger loose and bends it again. The hanger springs open and smacks him in the face.
. On the wall, a glob of his come slides down the tiles and drips into the electrical socket.
Hermione smiles wickedly. “Wouldn’t you like to know.”
Harry’s stomach swoops to his knees, a gastronomical Wronski Feint. He chokes down a gulp of his cocktail. The paper umbrella jabs him in the lip.
Ron’s long legs have carried him farther ahead on the path to disappear around a bend, which suits Harry just fine. He’s left alone to walk alongside Draco, a slow stroll that allows for an occasional brush of knuckle, a bump of elbow, a brush of knuckle
“Penises,” Lottie says, taking a thoughtful sip of her drink. “That can’t be right. Penii, maybe?”
and is standing—"
It’s bold and fucking risky standing in the boys’ bathroom with his cock out. And while he’s not the first to pull himself off in a school bathroom, this will be
“Oh, come on, teacher’s pet.” The lock pops open with a satisfying click, and Harry opens the door with a dramatic arm sweep. “Mrs Gregory always chose
Draco huffs away the fringe fallen into his eyes.
Harry’s phone pings, validating Draco’s comment. Draco peeks at Harry’s notification. “Another proposition for the elusive bathroom masturbator.”
Pansy and Hermione encroach on his view. Drinks and hors d'oeuvre plates trail suspended in the air behind them.
“It looks fractured.”
Section 550 of the library houses books about Geology.
“And the school could have burned down.”
By the time Harry enters the library for sixth period study hall, the school has been abuzz with ejaculation speculation all day, and Harry has a headache. The library offers quiet respite away from heated physics debates about the force and angle required to jettison semen into an outlet, and Mrs Pomfrey’s health lectures on the advantages of masturbation and self-care.
it when you call me Potter.” He dives in to lay the flat of his tongue against the rosy pucker.
“I am sorry about the berries, Molly,” Harry says. “I was looking forward to bramble jam.”
“I’ll tell you shit.”
posh lads that Harry could easily snap like an anemic twig over his broad thigh. The thought smooths his brow. He doesn’t feel bad about that, either.
“Of course,” Draco scoffs. “Star treatment for the star athlete.”
“He told him,” Hermione says, hands clasped under her chin.
Draco brushes Harry aside and enters their room. “Do not patronize me, Harry. If there is something wrong with me that I don’t know about then I expect you to tell me.”
“No.”
Ron grabs Harry’s bicep, bunching his hoodie and a bit of his skin into his clenched fist. Harry barely notices the pinching sting because the yellow chenille varsity font emblazoned on the back of Draco’s jacket spells out…
Harry hops out of the truck. The door slams shut, sealing his vow to never, ever,
Harry groans.
“Draco, darling!” Molly trills. “Good to see you again, love!”
Harry grins, and dipping a spoon into the ice cream, stirs a dollop into his tea.
So Harry, magic searing and sparking, hid in his office all day behind door-sealing enchantments and a Disillusionment Charm, a cowardly Gryffindor to whom the Sorting Hat would decidedly
been horrible—but they reserved the last day of July for a particularly nasty brand of viciousness.
“Oh?”
Draco smirks and shuts the car door. He turns and there it is again—
To his immense relief, the identity of HHS’ masturbatory miscreant remains A Great Mystery.
“Abysmal, Potter. If this is you flirting—”
, Harry wants to
A finger stroke against
“Looking for this?” Albus holds up a tiny plastic toy, his grin made all the more devious by two unruly black curls sprouting like devil horns from his temples. James, in his scramble to snatch his prize, knocks over a glass of juice.
Harry succumbs. The last thing he hears before fleeing the kitchen is Ron and Ginny say in unison, “
I want you, to kiss you.”
“How uncouth.” Draco grins and leans forward to pluck a gummy sweet from Harry’s bowl. His jacket gapes. Beneath the swinging chain, Harry catches a glimpse of rosy nipple. Three more mushrooms bloom into flowers.
Harry loves this part of the production process, when ideas gel and the magazine begins to take shape. It’s this moment, when the back of his eyeballs hum with what Xenophilius calls
Harry sighs. He’s becoming less enamoured with this stupid day by the minute.
A loud commotion sends branches rattling and flies scattering. Ron bursts through the brambles, tripping over grabby vines, leaves stuck to his hat and shirt. He freezes and stares, eyes wide, at Harry and Draco still in their intimate embrace.
Malfoy narrows his eyes, mouth twisting in the rain. “You think I can’t—”
Harry’s heart trips over a beat, caught unawares by the confession. He lifts his gaze to meet grey eyes, shining and vulnerable. “
Draco blinks. A small noise escapes his throat.
“Then, what—” Ron follows Harry’s gaze. “
“Not yet.” Draco hums in Harry’s ear. Harry grabs hold of Draco’s hand and laces their fingers, skin tingling at the promise of
Harry pauses, heart sinking, waiting for the verbal
He summons his cape and extracts a parchment roll from its vibrant folds.
“Come out, Draco. Ron and Greg will eat all the pasties.” He protects his eyebrows with his hands.
And he is completely mortified.
“As subtle as a Hippogriff in a china shop,” Draco mutters.
The second time Harry sets his office on fire, it’s not even his office.
and not their gender—"
“Oi, you tossers!” Ron calls, trotting back into view. “I spy blackberries.” He hops over the hedgerow that runs along the path’s right side through which brambles poke in tangly scraggly clumps.
He points the spoon at the blaze, now roaring. Yellow flames, so pale they’re nearly translucent, engulf the tree, consuming fat buds and withering delicate petals. Ochre smoke curls towards the fire alarm.
“And you were—”
Draco pants against Harry’s lips. “Do it, you
“Theo gifted me fireproof sheets for Christmas.”

Beyond the hedgerow boxing the wide field behind the Burrow lies a wooded copse that extends alongside a walking lane. It’s a lane Harry appreciates for its familiarity, having lost and found himself traversing its length many times over the half-decade since the war ended.
” Lily whines from the kitchen table. “James is eating all the cereal!"
