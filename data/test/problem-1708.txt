“Fuck,” Harry repeated, evidently frustrated. “I really, really want to... You have no idea how badly. I just don’t want you to have any regrets about this.”
“I’d like to spend more time with you,” Harry reiterated as Draco rested their joined hands on top of his stomach.
Harry snorted and took one more sip, draining the contents of his tea cup. “Oh, yes. Anger is always appropriate.”
Harry stared up at him, and their eyes locked, and suddenly Harry’s stomach was in knots. He read something in that diamond stare, something animalistic, something so irresistible and sexy and carnal that he couldn’t fucking breathe. Holy fucking hell… was Draco…
Draco snorted. “Whatever it is that you two are saying to each other through that very poorly disguised marital telepathy. Harry’s not here, so you can be candid. Let’s hear it.”
Finally Draco smiled at him and placed a cool hand on his cheek. “Honestly, the pair of us… I believe I’m not enough, and you believe you’re too much.”
“Now, I’m sure I’ll regret asking this, but what were you two talking about?” she asked, blowing on her tea and nudging her chair closer to Ron’s.
Harry pondered Hermione’s words for a moment; maybe she had a point. “Would that really work, though? People have been curious about all of us for years. Why would they stop now, even if I did do this?”
He nodded, still stunned. Potter requested him. Potter was the captivating Stranger from the coffee shop. Potter… oh fuck. Draco had flirted with him. Shamelessly. He’d asked him to bloody
Draco tried to read his face but he couldn’t, and he felt himself tense up as a result. “Sorry,” he murmured again, trying to pull himself off Harry’s lap again.
“Draco,” she exclaimed in her melodic voice as she stood and embraced him delicately. “It’s been far too long, my darling.”
Draco smiled back. “I’m not surprised that you would try to volunteer for this case. I’d predicted as much from a foolhardy, intrusive Gryffindor such as yourself.”
despite the hell you’ve gone through. You’re such a remarkably heroic person, and the entire world knows that. But when I’m with you, and you turn those qualities towards me... Merlin, I feel like the only person in the entire world who you want to be a hero for. You make me feel so special. So… safe, and warm, and… cherished. And I… Well. You’re remarkable.”
“I’m sure Granger will talk to him,” Draco reasoned. “Perhaps they both merely need a few days to ruminate. I imagine it’s not exactly easy to accept that their best mate is now in love with his former enemy. And theirs too, by all accounts.”
“Ron and I are a boring married couple with ordinary jobs,” she replied. “People can pop into the joke shop and say hello to Ron whenever they want, so he’s more of a friend than a celebrity, to most people.”
He sighed and swallowed a delicate spoonful of his bisque, waiting, like a coward, for the opportune moment to fall into his lap.
“There it is,” Draco chuckled, flicking Harry’s thumb playfully. “I’ll even forgive the insincere delivery.”
Harry laughed as he descended beside Draco, and Ron grinned as he came to a swift and far less graceful landing. Draco took a deep breath and another sip of tea in order to compose himself; he was still trembling.
Suddenly Harry looked up and noticed the look on Draco’s face. He must have realized that he was stalling.
“Cephalia curses are extremely dangerous,” she continued, as if he wasn’t already well aware of the fact. “And because it was fired from so close, the damage could’ve been disastrous. Not to mention permanent. Honestly, Malfoy, it’s lucky you’re not in a bloody coma.”
Harry grinned and flung his ankle over his knee. He pulled the throw blanket back over Draco’s shoulder.
Draco smiled and leaned back, taking a moment to just look him over. He looked for so long that Harry felt as if he’d been stripped naked, and he squirmed in his chair.
“Then talk to me, Draco,” Harry pleaded, clutching his hair with frenzied eyes. “Tell me what I can do.”
“That is rather kinky, Potter,” Draco said, smirking with a lifted eyebrow. “But not today. Let me put on some clothing and then you can go. Do you have all your things?”
His heart stuttered at the sight of him lying there, mouth slightly open, looking so at peace in sleep. Harry must’ve shifted closer to him during the night, because they were sharing one of his oversized pillows. Harry’s hands were resting snugly between their faces, and Draco thought he could smell broom polish on his fingers. His breath was tickling against Draco’s cheek. He was just so close… right there… he was too close, really; they were encroaching on each other’s space. And nothing had ever felt so right.
The weekly beer-and-chat sessions between the three of them had gradually become more of a biweekly beer-and-chat session when little Rose was born, but now that she was nearing two years old (and all their work responsibilities had increased), it was far more accurate to call it a monthly beer-and-chat session. Either way, Harry was excited to finally take a break from normal life and see his friends again.
Excitement flooded through him as he glanced at the clock on the sitting room wall. At least thirty minutes until Harry was due back.
“Never mind that, Potter,” he said, lifting his chin haughtily. “How long have you been out here? You’re soaked through.”
Harry loosened his grip on Draco warily, as if afraid he might try to bolt, but Draco’s feet were planted firmly to the floor now, and his eyes were glued to Harry’s.
In a feeble attempt at disguising his feelings, Harry shoved him back before picking up his tea. “Piss off, wanker.”
A tiny stone fireplace in the center of the far wall was the room’s crowning glory, and Draco looked forward to lighting a fire each evening once it became cold enough. A fluffy grey and white rug sat in front of the cozy hearth. Draco had spent hours on that rug, staring into a blazing fire and getting lost in thought.
Harry looked at him, surprise and delight on his face. “Pink grapefruit... Sorry, am I making you jealous?”
Harry took Draco’s face between his hands. “You’re having an anxiety attack, Draco. Breathe with me now. Just breathe.”
“It’s an obvious and resounding fuck yes,” Harry replied. “It was better than I could’ve ever imagined, and I imagined a lot.”
“You are, Harry,” Draco said, his whole being going numb. “Think about it. Your Gryffindor courage has never failed you before. I don’t think it would have failed you now, if you hadn’t subconsciously wanted it to.”
“It wasn’t just your hair, though,” Draco said, regretting saying it as soon as it was out of his mouth.
The Ministry-approved wand that Draco had been assigned during his two-year probation was one with incredibly limited power, and it had always felt uncomfortable in his hand. He had gotten used to doing things the muggle way since his trial, only using his wand when absolutely necessary. Even after his probationary period had ended last year and Draco had been allowed to purchase a wand of his own again, Draco found himself using it very little, most especially because it had never been quite the same as his first.
“Well, you’re right about that,” Harry agreed, moving one hand into Draco’s hair once again and leaving the other to roam Draco’s back. “I’ve always liked arrogant, pompous prats.”
Harry cast a drying charm on his white-blonde hair (Draco complained incessantly that Harry was doing it wrong); summoned him a plate of leftover scones (Draco remarked after every buttery bite that none of his clothes would fit him when he got home); and helped him into bed (Draco insisted that he was perfectly capable of doing so himself, even as he allowed Harry to tuck the blanket snugly around his arms). Then he left Draco alone in the bedroom and went downstairs to make some more tea (Draco told him to hurry back).
Harry moaned and Draco watched as he put his pointer finger in his own mouth. Draco wrapped his hand around his cock and jerked himself as Harry sucked on his finger. He saw that Harry was hard as a rock and dripping precum, and the sight made him feel as if he could come right then and there. Harry slid his already-wet finger over the tip of Draco’s cock, and then over his own, using the slightly sticky liquid as extra lubrication for Draco.
“It tends to be,” Draco smiled. “And for the love of all that is holy, don’t speak to me in Latin, it’s far too adorable.”
“Well, you obviously haven’t a clue what you really want, and I think when it comes to sex, or most things, really, if it isn’t an emphatic yes, then it should be an emphatic no. So I’m putting my foot down and drawing a line that says no shagging tonight. Deal?”
“But I guess the real answer, no filter, is that I wish none of it had happened at all,” he continued, looking lost in thought as he stared out the window. “I wish I had never been singled out from birth. I wish I’d had a normal childhood. A normal life.”
“Try not to hold it against my parents, Harry,” he said quietly. “We may not always see eye to eye, but their intentions were good. They usually are, really.”
Finally, mere minutes before he was due to meet Potter, his logical side convinced him that what he was wearing really didn’t matter at all. Potter would still hate him, regardless of his clothing; a dismal thought, but one that Draco had always accepted, and could accept now. That settled, there was nothing left for it but to apparate to Diagon Alley in his dressiest work attire. (And a spritz of his best cologne, of course.)
Yet again, Draco reached for Harry’s hand and placed another gentle kiss on top of it. “I didn’t say we should act as if we only have professional feelings for one another. That would be pointless and dishonest and… frankly, impossible. I like you too much to be able to ignore it now.”
It was too much… it was quickly becoming too much for Draco to handle, Harry’s body just inches away from his, Harry breathing against him, Harry’s shape visible under the too-thin bedsheet. Harry was everywhere again, consuming him, and yet he was not nearly close enough.
“I mean… I owe you too much,” Draco said in a low, shaky voice. “You pulled me onto your broom in the fiendfyre… you didn’t have to. You spoke at my trial. You didn’t have to. And, truth be told, you’re just an inherently better person than I am. Saint Potter will always lord over Death Eater Malfoy. It’s the way of things, Potter. It just is. I think even you must acknowledge that.”
Draco watched him spell open the butterbeer and take a long swig, after spilling a little on his fingers in apparent agitation. Draco had grown to love the way Harry displayed his every emotion in his mannerisms. If anyone wore their heart on their sleeve, it was Harry Potter.
Once more the pet name fell out of him with ease, and Harry refused to pick it back up again, even when Draco glared at him. Dammit all, Draco was a ‘honey,’ and he could bloody well deal with it.
“Are you looking to be graded?” Draco trailed his fingers along Harry’s toned bicep and then attempted to smooth out a wrinkle in the back of Harry’s shirt.
“A year and a half,” Harry replied, as proudly as if he was speaking about his own child. “Well, she’ll be two in August. She’s amazing.”
“I always make good points,” he countered arrogantly. “I’m thrilled to see that you’ve finally admitted it.”
Draco was about to kiss him, boundaries be damned, until he finally noticed that Harry’s other hand, the hand which had been on Draco’s arse only a minute ago, was now under the covers. Low. Almost like it was trying to hide something…
Draco finished chewing the bite slowly and swallowed before answering. “Why are you looking at me like that, Potter?”
. And the little smiles, coy glances, and foot nudges they kept exchanging--not to mention the fact that Harry was shirtless--made this an absolutely perfect morning.
“Indeed.” Harry chuckled again. “I’m definitely not broken up about it anymore, but needless to say it took me a couple months to warm up to dating again.”
Draco sighed, feeling both flattered by Harry’s remarks and a little remorseful for the negative way he knew he’d sounded. Perhaps being totally unfiltered around Harry wasn’t always the kindest course of action.
“I rouse your snake, do I?” Harry said with an impish grin, and Draco couldn’t help but smile back at him.
Draco handed him his bottle and they cheersed automatically before taking a sip, ill-advised though it may be.
“We should get out of your hair,” Harry said, suddenly ashamed of himself for making this wonderful news all about him, even in his head. It wasn’t about
“Well, that certainly eliminates the vast majority of my classmates,” he said at last, all the flirtation now gone from his voice. “Their hatred of me was totally justified, of course. I was an arrogant little prick at best, and pure evil at worst.”
“If I’m without a wand, I’ll need to survive,” Draco reasoned further. “Photographs and trinkets won’t help me.”
“Please?” he asked, in the sweetest voice he could muster, because that word had worked very well for him the last time.
Draco had always thought that Potter had an ego the size of a planet, but he was forced to admit he was wrong, now that Harry could not come up with even three things he liked about himself. Draco felt unbearably sad for him.
“It does so,” Draco said haughtily, a little hurt. “What, a Death Eater is not allowed to cry at a beautiful piece of music?”
“It works fine, or you can even come earlier if you want,” Harry told him, his eyelids already drooping. “Do you want me to come see you out?”
“This fucking vermin should be in prison!” Harry yelled. “And if he isn’t there already, then I’m going to hunt him down, kick his arse, and put him there myself!”
Without thinking, Draco dropped his hand into Harry’s lap and gently rubbed his fingers against Harry’s rapidly stiffening cock.
“I apologize, that was a bit harsh,” Draco said. “It’s a very touchy subject for me, that’s all. I don’t wish to discuss my living situation with anyone, not even..."
Draco looked back at him somberly. “It’s bad enough, what you had to go through in the wizarding world, but even your early years with those awful muggles were traumatic. For you to have come out of everything you’ve gone through and be… well, be
“My throat is a little raw as well, though it’s much better than it was initially,” Draco added lamely. “And my body feels heavy, and kind of slow, sort of lazy. But they assured me that that’s temporary as well.”
“You’ve really taken to this bossy role.” Harry grinned, boldly running both his hands through Draco’s hair.
Harry continued. “I feel lighter when you’re around. I feel like I’m safe, and cared for, and… home. You’re the other half of me, and I’m whole when you’re next to me. And I want you next to me forever, Draco. For the rest of our lives.”
“No specifics as to which man?” Draco asked, a tiny smirk gracing his handsome face. “Should I be worried?”
“I always feel better when you’re around,” Harry said, smiling gently at him. “But I feel… what’s that word? Not morbid...”
To his surprise, Harry didn’t say anything but ‘black pepper’ for a moment. And ‘toast’ was Draco’s only reply.
“Rest assured, however, I have no ulterior motives this time.” He glanced up at Harry for a second, as if gauging whether or not to say what he was thinking.
“I would spank you,” Harry replied without hesitation. He ran his middle finger over the tip of his cock and caught a drip of precum. “I would call you my little whore and slap my hand across your arse until you felt like you were… until you
Instead, Harry nearly gasped when he felt Draco’s soft fingers brush up against his, skin on skin, and everything in him was electrified. They both stilled for a moment, the backs of their hands barely grazing against one another.
Before anyone could say another word, his father spun on his heel and apparated from the room, just as Draco had predicted would happen.
“I’ll go grab Hermione and Ron,” Harry mumbled once they were inside the house, still agitated as he flung the blankets carelessly onto the couch.
“That’s exactly what I said, Harry,” Hermione said, rolling her eyes. “But perhaps the most interesting thing of all is that you’re never seen with any romantic partner. And it doesn’t help that any time you’re asked about anything, you give no comment.”
“And no more questions, for Merlin’s sake!” he ordered, his fingers now tapping aggressively against his folded arms.
“We shouldn’t go out on a date, much less be intimate, until after our professional dealings are complete,” he insisted, sounding a lot like the Draco of a couple weeks ago. Austere. Detached. In control.
Keeping his head down out of sheer habit, Draco trod across the office and weaved his way through the labyrinth of mostly-deserted cubicles, dodging a couple of wayward flying memos, until he reached his tiny but workable space. Ordinarily he would take the long way to his cubicle to avoid confrontation, a habit he had developed when a coworker had “accidentally” aimed a particularly aggressive bat bogey hex at him during his first week on the job. Draco was better prepared for the odd hex now, two years later. Nonetheless, he did find the persistent onslaught of sneers rather demoralizing, particularly before he’d finished his morning coffee.
“Did you ever regret leaving Hogwarts before your final year?” he asked her a long while later. It was the final question on the page.
Draco felt a perverse desire to ask him to elaborate, but at the same time, he wasn’t sure he wanted to know any details. But Harry continued.
“Wouldn’t dream of it,” Draco smirked, eyes glued to that pert, jogger-clad arse. “And don’t shave.”
“I’m sorry, Draco, but you’re having a meltdown and that was a funny thing to say, okay?” Harry was grinning. “Ignore my face.”
“And here are some guidelines for you.” She thrust a short stack of papers at him. “The more information you get, the better, so feel free to ask anything and everything you can possibly think of, even if it’s not on the suggested list of questions that I’ve included in that packet. You’ll notice that the top page is a list of all the people I’d rather be doing this than you, to keep you humble.”
The words had slipped out before he could stop them, but he realized that he didn’t regret saying them when Harry pulled his head away and graced him with a sunny smile.
“Obviously I wouldn’t tell you that, Potter, even if I knew,” Draco replied calmly. “Anyway, he hasn’t been discovered as of yet. At least that’s the last I heard before I left the hospital.”
Draco nodded. If he was honest with himself, it was still a little bit of a sore spot for him, knowing that Harry had failed to tell them last night. But he also knew his boyfriend was doing his best to make up for it, and that was all he could ask for, really.
“Ordinarily I would be immediately culpable in such a dispute, regardless of the evidence,” he told her with a shrug. “I suppose I’m not used to being seen as anything but a liability.”
Harry lifted his eyebrows. “I think that’s the first time I’ve ever heard you say that to me, Malfoy.”
“Thank you. I like it,” Draco said. “I used to sit outside with Mother when she was planting her flowers at the Manor. It’s one of my favorite memories of living there. She taught me a lot about gardening. And yes, before you comment on that, my mother also gardens. I know it will shock you.”
Draco couldn’t help himself; he laughed his way through the kiss, and Potter joined in after a moment.
Harry answered all of Draco’s questions to the best of his ability, questions about his horrid upbringing, his regrets, his deepest wishes and desires. They discussed his loved ones’ reaction to the confession of his bisexuality, his feelings about never knowing his parents, and the fact that he’d always struggled to trust anyone. Harry oscillated between feeling like he was on a date, in therapy, and on trial. Talking about himself was far more exhausting than he had ever imagined, and Draco had been right: these were the heavy topics.
Draco chuckled and took a sip of the tea before answering. “Of course. I am a very thorough reporter, you know. What else did you consider, besides a mediwizard?”
“Tonight?” Harry asked. He couldn’t stop looking at Draco, so he stepped into the fireplace backwards.
“Fuck,” Harry groaned. “Yeah?” He ran his tongue along Draco’s perineum and Draco groaned back at him.
“As a matter of fact, tea seems to be growing on me,” he said, pulling out his wand with a smile. “So how old is their daughter?”
“Moved in, like… same bed?” Harry asked, before shaking his head in clear embarrassment. “Oh god, why did I say that--what I mean is, surely you didn’t get back together?”
Harry watched as Draco then reached into the pocket of his trousers and pulled out a thin, silver business card holder, his initials engraved on it in an ostentatious script. He took a card from inside and placed it unceremoniously in front of Harry. When Harry finally saw a hint of insecurity in his face, he felt oddly warmed.
Harry let out a hum of pleasure and leaned back so that his head was resting against the back of the couch.
They’d discussed everything from his owl (Draco nearly cried when Harry recounted the life and death of his beloved Hedwig), to his favorite and least favorite school subjects (Draco had laughed until tears streamed down his face when Harry did his spot-on impression of Professor Binns), to the night he’d learned that he was a wizard (Draco was so utterly enthralled by the tale that he had barely remembered to take notes), and plenty more.
Finally, when he found himself halfway through a main course of duck a l’orange that he thought Harry would’ve liked, Draco sighed and decided it was time.
“Yes, I really do know that,” Draco replied. “But, unfortunately, you are very much in the minority.”
He had seen Harry’s cock for the first time last night, but they had both been almost fully clothed then. Seeing Harry completely exposed before him was an entirely new experience. Every line of Harry was defined and hard, and Draco pulled his head down once again for a long kiss. He felt Harry’s erection against his stomach, felt precum pooling on his skin. He moaned at the sensation.
“Let me state first, for the record, that this is off company time and in no way part of our interview.”
“If I’m a prick, then why did you request me to conduct your interview?” Draco asked casually. He tapped his finger against his mug, and he avoided Harry’s eyes long enough for Harry to know that he was really dying to hear the answer.
“Well, of course you do, you wanker,” Harry said, leaning forward just a little bit. He wanted to study every line on Malfoy’s face to see what had changed and what had stayed the same.
“Look, Potter,” he said. “It’s like you said back at the pub: A lot of shit happened. To both of us. But we can choose to stop looking at it. We can acknowledge it, and move forward.”
Draco stared at Harry as Harry picked up his wand and spelled the plate of biscuits and the two teacups to the kitchen, once again acting as if he owned the place. Draco decided now that he didn’t hate that after all. Not even slightly. Potter felt like a piece of his furniture somehow. An old, broken-in, beat-up leather armchair that Draco wanted to snuggle into and never get up again. So why did he keep pushing Harry away, right when it seemed as if he wanted to come closer?
“Cheers.” He tossed it into his mouth. “Ah, blackcurrant. Not my favorite, but it beats dirt, anyway.”
“Stop doing that,” Draco muttered when they pulled away. “You make me forget my own name sometimes.”
“It’s coming together,” Draco answered, still keenly observing his arms with those piercing silver eyes. “To be honest, I have so much information already that I could probably write a perfectly adequate piece without even conducting another interview session.”
“Please?” Potter said, looking up at him, and Draco felt a sense of dread knowing he could never, ever say no to those green eyes.
“Eight fucking minutes!” Harry replied, his face reddening. “As if that’s what this is really about.”
The declaration chased away his somber thoughts, and Draco smiled at Harry, his ray of sunshine. After a few moments of gazing at each other, they both sighed contentedly and fell automatically into a warm hug.
A man a few years older than him and Draco stood at the entrance of the cubicle, his eyes shifting suspiciously between the two of them.
“No, don’t apologize,” Harry said, a little roughly, as he stood up. “Stop apologizing for being Draco.”
He spelled a hefty dollop of lube onto Harry’s trembling hand and dropped his wand onto the floor behind him. He then reached over and laced his fingers between Harry’s, spreading the lube all over both of their hands. Their eyes locked once more.
Harry felt his fist clench reflexively around his wand, and he had to actively force himself not to burst out of his chair. A
He shook off the discomfort quickly, however, and when Ron brought up the previous night’s quidditch game (in which the Cannons had suffered grave injustices from the officials), Harry was feeling nothing but cheerful. The three of them talked and laughed together like always, for several hours.
“Not a bad thing, Harry, no,” she said emphatically. “But it does leave you open to even more scrutiny. If you give them this interview, no one will have to wonder what you’re really like. No one will have to speculate about your personal life. You won’t be fascinating to them anymore, because there won’t be any mystery left to solve.”
Grimacing to himself, Draco sat down at his small kitchen table and finally let his curiosity get the better of him, opening the letter slowly and carefully. He unrolled the paper and glanced at the signature at the bottom.
“Are you going to tell me who you are now?” Draco asked, buttoning his suit jacket as he glanced down at Harry.
He was dressed rather like a muggle university student in a smart jacket, a black cashmere jumper (which hugged his body perfectly), dark-grey trousers (which looked sinfully casual on him), and a smooth leather cross-body satchel (which replaced his usual sleek briefcase). Harry noticed that he had styled his hair just slightly different… (which made him look--oh god--a little bit dangerous). The whole ensemble left Harry’s mouth dry and his skin tingling.
“Do you really think we’ll be able to stop at just wanking?” Harry asked, and the words made Draco instantaneously harder.
Draco did believe it, but he kept quiet so as not to agitate Harry further. Instead, he gazed upon Harry’s flexed muscles and ignored everything else.
The witch looked at him funny. “Do you mean George? Sorry, he’s off for the day. Ron’s in the back, if you want to talk to him.”
Draco considered himself a patient man, but this week had proved him wrong time and again. Where was Potter’s promised owl? Draco had seriously contemplated sending one himself, just to check in, but his better judgement had metaphorically slapped him across the face just in time to prevent him from doing something so utterly pathetic. Anyway, he just wanted to make sure he’d gotten home alright. Ergh, why couldn’t that idiotic Gryffindor just keep his promises and send the damn owl like he’d said he would?
“Very well,” Draco smiled, glad to be veering back into lighter subjects, but a little leery of this one in particular. “I’ll keep your plethora of ex-lovers anonymous.”
Draco nodded, listening intently. Though they’d briefly touched on the witnesses’ accounts at the hospital the night before, Rosalind must’ve realized that he had been too groggy to absorb many details. All he remembered was that his coworkers had seen Alex leaving the proffice (oh Merlin,
He tried to take a deep breath, but he felt shaky and unstable. He had known all along that his father would never accept this, but hearing his cutting words struck Draco more deeply than he cared to admit. His eyes were burning and he felt the familiar cocktail of shame and self-loathing brewing in his chest.
Draco watched then, unsurprised, as Harry wiped the crumbs from his hands onto his jeans. A few hours ago Draco would have rolled his eyes, and his inner Malfoy still wanted to in a way. But now he found it so painfully endearing that all he wanted to do was walk over and take Harry’s hands in his own and lick each crumb away.
To Draco’s shock, Harry reached around and smacked his bottom before he turned to leave the kitchen. Draco let out a surprised whimper.
“All day,” Harry said. “But I need to get going in a bit, I have to go home and do some tidying before I pick up Teddy at five. He’s staying over at mine tonight.”
When he arrived at the Proffice (oh heaven help him, it was already sticking), Draco practically jogged up the staircase and through the newsroom, a ridiculous grin still on his face. He didn’t think it was possible for anything to dampen his buoyant mood… until he reached his cubicle and saw Alex standing over his desk.
“It’s a great wow,” Draco grinned, staring back at him. His eyes were as vivid as emeralds, and a contented, sleepy smile played on his lips. There was a sheen of sweat on his forehead, and somehow it made his scar stand out even more. Draco wanted to lean over and lick it. He was delirious with desire for him, even in the aftermath of such an intense orgasm. God, he wanted to touch Harry so badly that his fingers itched. “Are you alright?”
The tiniest moan slipped out of Harry’s mouth, and his eyes fluttered closed for a moment. Draco’s control was slipping away; he tugged his hand back out from Harry’s shirt, because touching him was simply… too much.
“How about… if Ron’s reaction involves any sort of wand usage, you win,” Harry proposed. “If not, I win."
Chastened, and more than a little aroused, Draco took another step back and forced himself to stop looking at Harry. He slowly sat down on the edge of the couch and folded his hands in his lap, crossing one ankle behind the other.
Draco scribbled furiously in his portfolio as Harry elaborated for a minute or two, pushing the quill a little harder on the page than normal. He could do this.
“A fire in which I’m left with no wand, and no other means of putting out said fire?” Draco asked incredulously, leading them down the spiral staircase.
After the remaining introductions were made, Harry pulled out a chair for Draco to take a seat. He looked so stone-faced that Harry couldn’t resist discreetly rubbing a comforting hand along his back as he sat down in the chair next to him, desperately trying to tell him without words that whatever it was, it would be alright.
Harry kissed his hand three times in response, and they walked hand in hand out the bedroom and down the hall.
Draco smirked at him. “Don’t you remember, Potter? I offered my friendship and you rejected me? Tale as old as time, and what have you.”
Draco took a demure sip of tea in response, and then he held his plate beside Harry’s, transferring three slices of bacon over with his fork.
As he took a sip of Draco’s tea, their eyes met for a moment too long. Harry’s dark, windblown hair was doing things to Draco. And that confounded smile on his face…
“This is all irrelevant,” Draco insisted once again. “Besides, as I’ve already told you, it would be inappropriate to continue flirting with you. I’m here to do my job.”
“Although, it’s not exactly a matter of public record, either, so I would appreciate your discretion.”
Harry shrugged. “It’s my given name, I like hearing it. I think it’s because I didn’t hear much of it until I went to Hogwarts; I was always ‘boy’ or ‘you’ or sometimes something a little worse than that.”
“You have a strangely innocent charm about you,” he went on, and Harry started to feel a bit uncomfortable. “Your heart has no malice in it. You’re very likeable.”
“But then you kept talking,” Harry countered, his voice shaking, but he quelled under Draco’s glare. “But fine, okay, I can leave if you want me to leave.”
His gaze and his comment both unsettled Draco more than he wanted them to, so he took another sip of tea and skimmed his notes, though he hardly saw a word. He was thinking of train whistles and thunderstorms, and about the fact that, even though Harry Potter was cheerful and pleasant and good, maybe he was not always happy.
It wasn’t the first time they seemed to be having similar thoughts this evening, and Draco thought it was a little bit thrilling.
“That doesn’t matter!” Draco shouted, finally breaking his composure in his desire to win the argument. “The very fact that they’re spirits guarantees their victory in a battle against anyone! They’re immortal! They can’t die, therefore they can’t be defeated by any living creature! I don’t know why you can’t understand this!”
Draco asked her several questions while Ron and Harry flew, questions about Harry as a person, their history together, how their friendship had grown and changed through the years. Predictably, Hermione’s answers were well-phrased and perfectly thorough. She was less anecdotal than Weasley had been during dinner, more analytical than Harry ever was, and far more revealing than Draco had anticipated. Everything she said made it crystal-clear how well she knew Harry, and as irrational and childish as it was, Draco found himself feeling jealous of their bond.
you to think of me. I want to be in your head, all the time. It’s very stupid, but it’s true. I want to be everything to you. Because you really feel like everything to me. You’re everything to me, Harry, already.”
“Well he is a bit of an oaf, Potter,” Draco argued, and Potter rolled his eyes in response. “Honestly I was a bit afraid of him, if you must know. The fact that he was with you, and I could already tell you were leery of me… I don’t know, I felt oddly panicked that you didn’t like me, and I wanted everyone to like me.”
He hadn’t meant to look up at Harry through hooded eyes as he said the word, but he realized after the fact, as Harry swallowed audibly and licked his lips, that that was precisely what he had done.
Harry’s eyes drifted closed for a moment, drinking in the sound of his name like water on a hot day. He stepped into Draco’s space again, as if being pulled by an invisible string. Harry’s forehead leaned forward and came to rest against Draco’s.
“Pardon me, I do not get ‘persnickety,’” Draco replied, pleasantly surprised and grateful for the flawlessly executed diversion. “Nice word, though, Webster.”
“Such as?” Draco asked. He pulled out a chair and turned it around so that it was facing Harry, and he sat down.
“Ron’s come up twice now,” Harry said after a few moments. “If I didn’t know better, I would say you fancied him.”
“Okay. Well... I often get scared that you’re going to run away once you realize that I’m not this noble, larger than life hero that the rest of the world thinks I am,” Harry began, picking at the crust of his sandwich. “I’m scared I’ll let you down somehow. And you’re really great, and I don’t want to let you down, and I don’t want you to run away, because you’re pretty much exactly right for me. I guess I just try to ignore that fear and remind myself that we’re going to be together for the rest of our lives.”
“Your tea, your highness,” Harry quipped as he entered the room. Draco smiled up at him as he closed the magazine.
Draco grimaced. “Sadly, you are partly right. Poor, and uncultured, and rude, and frankly obtuse more often than not…”
The voice beside him should have been Dumbledore’s, but to Draco’s horror, the words were spoken in a cold, mocking hiss.
“Come on,” Harry said gently. “Stay. It’s still only like five in the evening. And you don’t really have to go into work tomorrow anyway, since it’s a weekend and they know you’re on assignment now, so you could theoretically stay all night. If you wanted.”
Harry swallowed, his gaze drifting down to Draco’s mouth. His eyes were hooded and looked nearly black now.
He straightened his jacket and glared down at Harry, but any snide remark flitted from his mind at the look on Harry’s face. Face resting in his hands, Harry looked positively forlorn. He stared straight ahead, eyes unfocused, his wand lying uselessly on the floor in front of him.
“I truly cannot believe that you insisted on this, Potter,” Draco muttered, mounting his broomstick.
“You don’t know that,” Draco insisted, a little irked that Harry’s blind optimism impeded his ability to think logically. He'd always been this way, even at Hogwarts.
Draco wasn’t sure how to say what he was feeling, because as eloquent a speaker as Potter told him he was, when it really counted, sometimes Draco still failed to find the words.
He pushed Harry away slightly and Harry yielded, gazing down at Draco with nearly black eyes and an open, pink mouth. His body… oh, it was divine.
Draco snorted, and the fondness in his eyes calmed Harry instantly. He fired another warming spell at the blanket.
Oh god. He would have to process that later. He knew he’d had too much to drink last night, and Draco had followed him home… Harry had been on the brink of sleep, and Draco had left the room swiftly, after pulling Harry’s shoes off for him…
“That is utterly illogical,” Draco argued. “But, very well, I can be mature about this, unlike some people.”
“As if you could resist me for a whole month,” Harry said, comically twitching his eyebrows and stroking his scruffy chin like a villain.
“Even when you’re in a room with three people you used to bully?” Harry asked him as he jotted down Ron and Hermione’s address with shaking fingers.
“I know we kind of talked about this already, it's just... I mean, it’s easy enough to know that I look like my dad, and have my mum’s eyes,” he began, thinking out loud. “But I’ll never really know that I… I dunno, straighten my glasses the same way my dad did, or hold a quill like mum, or whatever. I mean, there’s really no one left to tell me, oh you did that just like Lily, or that’s exactly what James would’ve said. It’s like they died all over again each time someone else died, someone who knew them, someone who had those memories of them. Like… so few people still have those memories in their minds now that it’s almost like my history is kind of lost. It’s like I come from nothing. Does that make any sense? Fuck, I know I’m being incredibly self-centered, saying all that. God, sorry.”
Draco thought about Harry’s kisses in other places, too. He thought about Harry’s lips around his cock, the way he always licked his tongue slowly around the tip so he wouldn’t waste a single drop of Draco’s cum, how his warm breath felt against Draco’s spit-covered erection. Harry always liked getting him nice and messy.
“For hating you, and everything you stood for. And for everything that that hatred led me to do,” Draco muttered, the shame of it hitting him so forcefully that he could feel his shoulders folding inward. “It was wrong of me. I was wrong. About everything.”
If there was one thing Draco knew for sure, it was that being so affected by touching fingers under the table was markedly unusual. It couldn’t mean anything, of course. It was just that Draco hadn’t seen Harry for six days. Six long, lonely days.
He tried to tell himself that it wasn’t a big deal. This was just Potter; nothing to be nervous about. Only a childhood enemy trying to do him a favor. A childhood enemy who also happened to be the only reason (several times over) that Draco was alive today.
Lucky for Draco, he heard the back door open shortly thereafter. Harry was a little early. Draco let out a tiny moan; the thought of Harry walking in on him sent a tingle through his veins. He gripped his cock more firmly in his hand and stroked it a little faster.
“I’m not sure why we always hated each other so much, to be honest,” Potter said without segue, sliding back into his bar stool. “How can two eleven year old boys hate each other so suddenly and so strongly?”
“Wh--,” Draco began, but he quickly realized exactly what Harry was staring at and dropped his hands from Harry’s chest to his own sides. “Oh.”
“I’ll never stop telling you how handsome and wonderful you are, Harry Potter,” Draco admitted, kissing the lightning bolt scar on his forehead. “And I love your egotistical arse.”
“You’re really good at it,” Harry said, squeezing his arm a little and kissing his forehead. “I usually last longer than that.”
Harry grinned at this unexpected burst of Malfoy-ness after the formalities of earlier. “What can I do to help?”
“What?” Draco asked, caught off guard. The thought hadn’t even occurred to him. “No, of course not!”
“No it’s not,” Harry said breezily. “And that’s a terrible excuse for someone who drinks espresso at three in the morning. Plus you did say I could ask you anything I wanted, remember, teammate?”
Harry looked at him expectantly, but Draco had completely run out of words. Harry was right; Draco didn’t believe him. But he believed that
It all still felt like the very sweetest kind of dream. Draco had masturbated in his bed. Harry had masturbated beside him. Oh god, the filthy things Draco had said… the things they’d
After accepting that the cloud of melancholy would be hanging over his head for the time being, Draco dragged himself out of bed and into the shower. Familiar memories of every terrible thing he had done, as well as the resulting feelings of despair and self-hatred, followed him there like a shadow.
Draco laughed, flattered and sort of insulted but all in all a little pleased. He felt himself blushing.
“Honest, and gritty,” Draco agreed vehemently. “You can really feel everything he’s singing. It makes me cry.”
“What is your type, then?” Harry asked. Draco tried to tell himself he imagined the eagerness in Potter’s voice.
“But you’re probably right about sir,” Harry continued. “‘Sir’ is only for when I’m naked and tied up and on my knees for you.”
“Nonsense, Malfoy, I’m here every bloody Sunday, as you well know, since you bloody are too,” she replied gruffly, standing up and summoning her jacket from the coat rack by the door.
Draco raised his eyebrows. “No pressure, but this promises to be a far more interesting topic than the weather, if you’d like to talk about it.”
Draco sighed as he approached Rosalind’s office; he would have to continue shoving it all aside for the moment, at least until after their meeting. For now, he had to keep it professional. Draco was beginning to truly loathe that word.
Harry rolled his eyes. “I really believe that no one in this world thinks more highly of himself than you do.”
“Harry?” Draco asked, taking a step towards him, concern immediately flooding his pale eyes. “What’s wrong?”
“Tell me something else,” he said, before tossing the bean in his mouth and folding both hands behind his head.
“Ask me again later, if you still want to know,” Draco heard himself say, having no idea where it had come from.
“Hi, Hermione,” Harry said, glancing conspicuously over her shoulder at Draco, who was nervously and unnecessarily straightening his jumper. “Ron’s just finishing up with Rose’s bath, and… here’s the reporter I warned you about.”
“Tonks was a really cool girl,” Harry said with a smile. “Always running into things, always making light of every situation.”
“Was I complaining?” Draco asked. He licked his lips as slowly and suggestively as he could, and he was gratified when Harry’s eyes followed his tongue like it was enchanted.
Pansy had a large grey barn owl, and Mother would only send him letters through Artemis, the Malfoy family’s snowy owl. Greg almost never sent him mail, and since he didn’t own an owl at all, Draco assumed this letter was not from him. Occasionally Blaise would send him news from his home in France, but he always used the muggle mailing system, thinking it was quite the amusing joke. Draco presumed that Blaise had finally relented to using owl post again, and Draco had begun unscrolling the letter before he hesitated.
“Cute!” Draco scoffed loudly, violently shoving down the snitches, which were now threatening to fly right out of his throat and all about the room. “I am not cute!”
“--but think about it. You’re an Auror, which is generally quite a fascinating job; you keep to yourself; no one ever sees you out and about.”
Draco took the nearly-empty plate from Harry and set it on the coffee table, shifting himself so that he was straddling Harry’s lap, rubbing his hands all over Harry’s hard chest. Harry looked up at him, eyebrows raised, and placed his hands gently on Draco’s sides.
“You should feel completely normal again after you get a good night’s sleep,” Harry assured him. “And don’t forget to take your potion first; where is it?”
“I’m glad to see you’re finally accepting Weasley’s shabbiness, almost a decade later,” Draco smirked.
“You’re Draco Malfoy,” he uttered, still in shock. Harry tried to mentally calculate how many years it had been since he’d seen Malfoy face-to-face. Maybe three years after the war? So he’d been… what, twenty? Wait, what year was that? Oh fuck it, it had been a damn long while, anyway. And now he was staring again.
Every ounce of reason that Draco possessed shouted at him that this was too soon, that surely two long-time enemies could not become lovers in less than a day. But when Harry sat up and kissed him, the crystal-clear whisper of his heart chased every shouted thought from his head. And his heart was whispering that this would work out just fine. This would work out, for the rest of their lives.
Draco looked over at him cautiously, but Potter was staring at the ground, looking angry with himself for asking. Draco smiled.
Harry didn’t say anything for a full minute. Draco could feel the tension radiating off of him, so he nuzzled his head in as close to Harry’s neck as it could get and kissed it a few times. He really did smell wonderful.
Draco knew he had said too much, and he refused to meet Potter’s eyes. Instead he looked around the pub and noticed that it was getting more crowded. Draco ordinarily hated crowds and avoided them at all costs. He desperately wanted to crawl out of his skin and leave, but instead he had willingly surrounded himself with all these people, people he knew would not have left him alone had he been unglamored. He could remember a few less than pleasant instances in public places that he wished he could forget, and he’d quickly learned, as a result, that it was best to avoid going out in public as Draco Malfoy.
“Yes, I’d love a cup, thank you,” he replied politely, his nerves creeping back upon him now that it was just them. Thank Merlin for Rose, the cutest buffer on earth. “Just black is fine.”
“I’m glad you think so, Potter,” he said, leading them to walk further. “But it’s not all bad. I love my work. And I’m good at it. It gives me a purpose. And muggle children--muggles in general really--they don’t seem to mind the tattoo so much. One of my students named the skull Herman.”
“We absolutely sucked each other off,” Harry answered cheerfully, squeezing him. “And then you rolled over, pulled my arm over top of you before I even finished swallowing, muttered something about my excessive sweatiness, and promptly passed out. For nearly an hour.”
To his utter shock, Harry was smiling when he looked over. “Wipe that fucking smile off your face, Potter! Don’t gloss over this, don’t act like it’s normal. And don’t let them make you feel as if you deserved one single day of that hell, because you bloody didn’t. And for pity’s sake, don’t try and make me feel better right now, because I can see it in your damn heroic face that you want to! I should rot in hell for the things I said to you from the first day we met. How on earth could you ever get over any of the things you’ve gone through? Potter, your entire bloody life has been shit!”
“Don’t be so dramatic, Potter,” he mumbled into his tea cup. His hands were shaking like leaves now, and god, they were twice as pale as usual. He could only imagine how disastrous he must look. It was the last thing he should be thinking about, but all he wanted to do was run into the bathroom and fix his damn hair. He didn’t want Harry to see him like this. He didn’t want Harry to see him at his worst. Harry
“I told you not to move your head,” Harry chided, freeing his hand from Draco’s. He reached gingerly behind Draco’s neck and began softly massaging it. “Where does it hurt, just your neck?”
“Because I actually showered this morning,” Draco answered pompously, “unlike a certain brute who shall remain nameless.”
“I really like you, Dragon,” Harry said, smiling contentedly. “No matter what path you took to become this person, I’m happy you arrived exactly where you are.”
“Maybe not to you, who never wears anything but worn-out jeans,” Draco retorted, the smirk on his face nearly crossing over into the all-too-familiar sneer of old, even as he, too, looked Harry up and down.
Before he could evaluate exactly how many levels of wrong it was, Draco unlaced Harry’s well-worn trainers and began shimmying them off one by one.
Harry smiled at him, once again feeling completely gobsmacked by his beauty. “You’re very handsome.”
Rather than leave Draco’s comment hanging there like a soap bubble between them, Harry lifted his hand once again and skimmed his thumb gently along Draco’s jawline. It was soft and smooth; he must’ve borrowed Harry’s razor. The image made Harry’s heart burst.
“Yes, observing you,” Draco admitted, watching as Potter took a sip of his drink. “I hated you and I wanted to use anything I could against you.”
“Right,” Draco muttered under his breath, taking one last deep breath as he weaved his way through the shop, following her vague directions down a bright orange hallway and towards the last door on the left.
“So, how do you think I should tell them?” Harry asked. “How did you bring it up with your parents?”
Harry walked towards the doorway to the sitting room, the doorway that Draco was still standing in, pausing to wait for Draco to clear the way. Draco remained frozen where he was and placed his hand gently in the middle of Harry’s chest.
“You let me lick your scar,” Draco began, without thinking about his words first. “Yesterday. You said you liked it.”
“What the fuck is happening?” Ron murmured, and this time Hermione didn’t bother to chastise him. Rose giggled into her noodles.
“Diamond?” Draco peered at him curiously. “I don’t believe so, no. Do you mean to say you like silver?”
“You never gave me a tour of your house, by the way,” Harry said out of nowhere. Draco really liked that he did that sometimes, as if he was saying each thought as it came to him, without filter. It made Draco feel like he was reading Harry’s mind.
“It’s French, Potter,” he explained, pinching Harry’s arm. “The English pronunciation, faineant, is also correct, though I’ve always preferred the word in the original French.”
“I wish you wouldn’t just sit back and take it,” Harry mumbled, finally plunking himself back down onto his chair and folding his arms over his chest. “I wish you didn’t act like you were just… I dunno, fair game for people to fucking treat this way. I wish you didn’t believe all that bollocks about yourself.”
Harry couldn’t help but doubt that. Draco, or at least the seemingly defunct Draco of his past, had relished every opportunity to point out people’s physical flaws, real or imagined.
“It’s not the same thing,” Harry replied, shaking his head. “I had much better reasons to make that sacrifice. Better reasons than a few people’s noses being out of joint.”
And there it was. He heard it immediately, now that he was consciously looking for it: the heavenly sound of Harry snoring softly behind him. It made Draco want to weep.
Once again, Harry tried not to think about Draco, but it was the worst he’d failed in a long time. He thought about the way Draco tapped his quill against his luscious pink lips when he was considering something. He thought about all the things Draco had confessed to him, and the way he’d looked when he had done so. He thought about his fancy clothes, his model walk, his diamond eyes…
“I reckon we’ll just have to find a way to share him, then,” Ron said reasonably. “Since he’s chosen both of us now.”
“Good afternoon, handsome,” Harry greeted him with a smile, his stomach fluttering at the sight of Draco walking gracefully towards him. “Welcome to the Auror department.”
Draco stuttered over his words as Harry stared at him with those stunning emerald eyes. "Well, yes. Not even you. Maybe I’ll explain someday, but… not yet.”
And Harry turned on his heel and headed into the kitchen towards the back door. Draco scrambled after him in shock.
“I want to be your pet,” Harry muttered, peering up at Draco with timid eyes, as if he might’ve said the wrong thing. “I don’t just want you to fuck me, I want you to own me. Control me. Anything you want me to do, I’ll do it.”
“I can’t place exactly what it was that drew you to me then,” Draco said softly. “It was a lot of things, I imagine.”
Harry felt the words blowing against his ear, and he shivered. Draco’s definition of ‘professional’ seemed to oscillate by the minute; Harry found it impossible to keep up with him, and he loved it. He didn’t want to say goodbye… he didn’t want Draco to leave. He wanted…
Draco was unsure what to do with that concept, but he rolled it around his head for a minute, letting it soothe him.
“Yes, as a matter of fact, there is,” Draco began. “I was wondering if the proprietor was available.”
Harry stared at him as if he was a spooked hippogriff. “Draco… we’re not doing another interview tonight, okay?”
“If you’re already trying to send me out of the country for a week or two, then I think that’s a rather horrible sign.”
Potter was right: Draco was indeed not expecting to hear from him. A hundred emotions flowed through him, surprise, of course, being the first. He reluctantly admitted to himself that excitement was a very close second.
“Are you okay?” Harry asked tenderly once he had his jeans on. He was looking at Draco with concern.
“Mother,” he murmured into her soft blonde hair. She smelled like lilac, the way she always smelled, and Draco was instantly comforted.
One by one, he watched countless others appear in a row beside them: Luna, Sirius, Professor Snape, Neville, Ginny, Fred and George, Teddy, Ollivander, Mrs. Weasley; people Harry knew, people he didn’t know. They were all ghosts.
After another shaky sip of tea, Draco continued. “He was standing over my desk. I asked him what he was doing there. He turned around and cursed me before I could stop him.”
“Not at first,” Harry said, panting a little. “But I start to play with myself while I watch you, I can’t help myself, and you finally hear me make a noise, and you don’t stop, you just stare right at me and keep fucking your own hand, just loving that you have an audience, loving that it’s me watching.”
“Do you think they’re talking about us in there?” Draco asked him at last, gesturing with his chin towards the hallway.
“Believe me, it’s not always easy,” he mumbled, rubbing absently at the back of his neck as he fought to regain equilibrium.
“Is it short for Harold?” Malfoy continued. “Henry? Harrison? I know your middle name is James, after your father, but there was some debate about the origin of your first name while I was researching. Is Harry also a family name? Or was your shaggy black mane the sole inspiration for the moniker?”
“I know, I know,” Draco groaned, even as he smiled. “Admittedly, I do much better on paper. Or when I’m drinking.”
I really hope you enjoy this chapter, and that you're having a stellar week. Thanks so much for sticking with this story. :)
Harry groaned once more and took a shot of water after licking his lips. After he swallowed, he stared up at the ceiling. “Okay. Fine.”
Rosalind ignored his feeble apology and used her wand to pull a thick binder off the shelf behind her desk.
“Your bed really is very comfortable,” Draco said, smiling at him, fighting to remain in control, despite the blood pounding through his veins. “Imagine all the things we could do in it.”
To his surprise, Harry dropped back down into his chair and leaned forward angrily. “Fucking hell, Malfoy, what is your problem?”
“What do you mean, friendship?” Potter continued after a sip. “You told me, in front of our whole year, that you thought you were better than everyone, and everyone else was basically thestral shit on your heel.”
“Don’t say things like that,” Draco commanded him, even though he wanted him to. He was concerned at how rapidly his self-control was slipping away, but not nearly as concerned as he should be.
“Maybe that’s why I requested you,” Harry said lightly. “Maybe you could use some stress in your life.”
Finally Harry reached Draco’s tiny little workspace at the other end of the room, instantly smiling at the back of his white-blonde head. Harry allowed himself only the briefest moment to stare at Draco, who was bent low over his notes, scribbling furiously while his self-writing quill worked beside him. His shoulder blades rippled pleasantly beneath his crisp white dress shirt, and Harry felt something inside of him squirm. Dammit, it felt amazing.
He smiled again. “Of course. I’m always here to listen, Draco. To anything you want to say. Especially when you end it with my name.”
Harry stopped in his tracks and growled in aggravation once again, squeezing the back of his neck with both hands.
Harry kept preparing his toastie and didn’t answer, which made Draco feel anxious and sad all over again. Finally, after one last kiss to Harry’s shoulder, he pulled away and walked wordlessly into the sitting room; perhaps Harry just needed another minute alone. Draco had, after all, interrupted his solo thoughts out in the garden. Maybe he wanted a little more time by himself.
Draco leaned down and put his face entirely too close to Harry’s, so close that Harry could smell the fresh scent of his shampoo and taste firewhiskey and coffee on his breath. He was inhaling Draco.
“You can get ready here, you know,” Harry said softly. “I mean you don’t have to rush off as soon as I do.”
When he walked through the doorway just off the sitting room and into the kitchen, Draco steadied himself against the countertop and blew out a shaky breath. He wondered how on earth he and Harry had gone from total enmity to sharing beers in his flat in a matter of hours, but he admitted that this was a welcome departure from his life lately. Everything about this evening was unexpected, but not outrightly bad, either, not by any stretch. Maybe it was even a little bit good. He could hardly say. Too much alcohol in his system.
Draco snorted. “Perfectly understandable; it was a laughable situation. Malfoy the lightweight Death Eater, puking his guts out in front of the chosen one.”
“I guess not everything has changed,” Harry said with a sigh. “We’re still really good at pissing each other off.”
Draco couldn’t help the smirk sitting on his face. “I’m a knob who’s apparently been observing you far too closely and for far too long.”
Harry’s ear-to-ear grin was infectious. “I’m seriously hoping this is all a joke, because I’m oddly jealous of my Spanish rival.”
Draco rolled his eyes, smiling. “I work as a teacher’s assistant in a primary school near here, to answer your question.”
“Astoria will be expecting me,” he replied reluctantly. “I owled her with a brief update before I left St Mungo’s yesterday.”
Harry took a swig of his drink and pondered that. “You Weasleys really do mate like rabbits, don’t you?”
There was a long pause. Draco glanced at Harry and saw that he was staring at the ground in front of him.
“Please?” Harry said, pouting. “It doesn’t even have to be dirty, it can be sweet. One flirty line. Just tell me how cute I look.”
Despite the confrontational delivery, Draco admitted that that was a reasonable question. He shifted slightly, a familiar cloud of shame hovering all around him.
He sat down on his garden bench and crossed his legs, enjoying the smell of the flowers surrounding him in the late afternoon sunshine.
“You’re giving me flashbacks, Ariadne,” Draco said with a nostalgic smile. “Do you remember the first time we met?”
“If you’re not completely okay with it, just tell me,” Harry said, though he wasn't sure what could be done about it now, if Ron did object. Merlin, he was an idiot sometimes.
He obediently sat down on the armchair. “Then tell me now, you git, before I assume the worst again.”
As he approached the table, Harry unzipped his jumper and shook his hair out slightly. Draco took a good, long look at him. Yes, he was the same Harry Potter. Same scar, same glasses, same wayward black hair. And yet…
“Come on, then,” Harry said, giving him one last nudge before heading back towards the sitting room.
Draco moved his glance down to Harry’s mouth and nodded boldly. Fuck the boundaries. Fuck professionalism. “Say everything.”
Harry laughed and kissed his forehead again. “Alright. Then I love hearing you talk, too. And you’re perfect.”
Harry obediently lifted his hand out from under the sheets and held it, palm up, in front of Draco. He could see that Harry’s fingers were shining with precum, and it took everything in Draco not to lick it off. Somehow that, of all things, seemed too intimate.
Draco scrambled to look and sound casual. “Come now, Potter, surely you knew that I was gay? I certainly thought the whole school did, anyway.”
“I’ll take a cup of your peppermint tea, Potter,” Draco demanded almost as soon as he stepped out of the fireplace, and he made his way authoritatively into the kitchen without waiting for an invitation. “I’m still chilled to the bone.”
Draco's foggy mind finally put two and two together; obviously at some point in the night, Harry had woken up and somehow managed to put Draco into bed without waking him. Draco must’ve been out like a light to have slept through it.
Draco bit his lip as Harry’s green eyes looked up again and met his own. He felt his heart stutter along with his resolve.
“You always look… warm,” Draco continued, and then his eyes shifted downward, like saying it was a mistake.
He didn’t need to. Draco wasted no time climbing over top of Harry, kissing his lips, his chin, his neck, his chest. He skated his tongue over Harry’s brown nipple, then over the other; over a scar on his stomach; over the thin trail of hair below his belly button that enthralled him so.
“I thought I told you we weren’t having sex tonight,” Harry groaned into Draco’s ear, and he almost came from that alone. Even as he said it, Harry rutted his erection up against Draco’s. The world blurred around him as Draco moaned in delight.
“And surely someone as highly intelligent as you, despite being ‘slightly inebriated,’ must’ve realized that I’m in disguise,” Harry said.
“He’s like my brother, Draco,” Harry said quietly. “We’ve been through so much together that I was really convinced that this would be easy. Maybe that was naive, but I needed him to accept this, to accept you… and he didn’t. He immediately assumed that I was under some kind of dark spell, or that you had me under the imperius curse or something… I dunno, I guess it pissed me off that he went after you without a second thought, when I had just told him how happy you make me.”
Harry laughed with him. “Sure, let’s get it over with. Won’t be on the subject very long, I’m afraid.”
Draco groaned and rolled his eyes. “I didn’t ask you to dinner, Potter, I asked the adorably nervous man in the coffee shop to dinner.”
Draco moaned softly against Harry’s cheek and leaned into him, wrapping his arms around Harry’s shoulders.
Draco raised an eyebrow skeptically. “What, erase ten years of hatred and viciousness from our history?”
“Malfoy!” Ron laughed again. “I always figured he was into blokes. Merlin’s pants, I love being right.”
“Oh I definitely still want to hear your type,” Harry said, “but let’s start with your relationships and sexual history, shall we?”
“I don’t know,” Harry said, squirming uncomfortably on his bed. “Look, I’m sorry, but I really don’t feel much like being interviewed right now.”
Draco clutched his mouth with one hand and his stomach with the other, hurling himself up from the couch and rocketing to the bathroom just down the hallway. He slammed the door shut and practically dove to the toilet, dropping to his knees on the cold floor.
Potter snorted beside him and gently nudged Draco to lead the way out of the pub. He tried to tell himself he was imagining the feel of Potter’s body heat underneath the thin cloak, but it was impossible not to feel something when Potter was standing so close to him. And his scent… so delicious was it that Draco leaned slightly further into Potter and tried to inhale subtly.
“Hold out your hand,” Draco instructed suddenly, reaching behind him and grabbing his wand from the nightstand. He didn’t want to dwell on his feelings now, not when he so desperately needed to come.
Draco couldn’t help but smile back at him, and then he released a humiliating giggle of pent-up nerves, feeling like a teenager again. “Goodnight, Harry.”
They looked at each other for a long while, and Harry took a mental picture of Draco’s face so he could study it line by line later.
Even after the initial shock of it had dissipated, he still found it incomprehensible that Potter was the one who had so enthralled him a few nights ago. He’d always been acutely aware of Potter in school, of course, but that was only because he was famous, and because they’d been enemies. He’d known more about Potter than most people had back then, but who knew what he would be like now that they were older?
Draco couldn’t resist the impulse to bend over the bed and kiss Harry’s cheek, his forehead, his lips.
“Quite good is an understatement,” Harry said. “Remember those homemade cauldron cakes? A full English every morning… mmm. And the treacle tart, ohhh Merlin, yes.”
When the time had finally come for Harry to head home after spending that memorable first weekend at Draco’s house, Harry had (only somewhat) facetiously insisted that Draco accompany him to the garden in his backyard to bid him farewell and kiss him goodbye beside the flowering rose bush before he disapparated.
“Malfoy?!” Ron asked, and he suddenly burst out laughing. Rose turned to look at her daddy and started to giggle as well.
Ron snorted. “I forgot it was Mum and Dad’s anniversary yesterday--grab me one too, will you?--so they’ve up and left town for their hundredth honeymoon.”
Would Potter respond? Draco tried to ignore the fact that he wanted to read another letter from Potter, tried to pretend that he wouldn’t be thinking about it all day.
“Hey, woah,” Harry’s voice broke through the ringing in his ears and Draco turned to him, pathetically holding his arms out, desperate for his touch.
Draco tried to hide his smile. He wasn’t sure why he loved Harry’s insults so much; probably because he was truly fucked-up. “Well?”
“I don’t know what to say, Potter,” Draco finally said in a shaky voice, feeling weak and useless, hating himself for not having an endless trove of comforting words for Harry.
Draco was momentarily surprised that Harry had once again said what he had just thought himself, but then, perhaps it wasn’t that surprising at all. He allowed himself to just lie there on Harry, his smile a permanent fixture on his face.
“We’re courting, Father,” Draco said, though he looked at his mother as he said it. She merely stared back at him. “Harry and I are together.”
Draco shifted even closer to him until there was almost no space left, and only when their knees were touching under the covers did Harry seem to realize where his other hand was.
“No matter how much we love each other, no matter how right we are for each other… we’re not the only ones involved in this relationship. Our feelings aren’t the only ones that matter.”
Harry let out a baffled snort of laughter and wordlessly folded his hands behind his back, wincing a little as he braced for impact. With all the strength he could muster, Draco hurled the pillow mightily at Harry’s head.
Once Potter had gone, Draco turned around and watched him walk up to the bar. He still walked the same, that casual, unassuming lope that Draco would know anywhere. Draco didn’t pull his eyes away the whole time he was ordering, telling himself that it was merely a force of habit to never have his back to Potter.
Harry nudged Draco’s shoulder gently. “And you’re sort of the opposite. No one can make words sound sexier than you can, until you really need to say something, and then it all comes out in rambles.”
“Ron! Not around the baby, for goodness’ sake,” Hermione mumbled, shaking her head with a forbearing smile.
Harry shifted uneasily in his armchair as he watched Rose smack her plastic toy wand against the coffee table, colorful sparks bursting out the end with each blow. “Bite!” she bellowed each time.
He took a long swig of his coffee when he reached the top of the staircase and surveyed the bright, open workspace. Since the full-time journalists at the Prophet had no fixed schedule, he never knew whether to expect an empty newsroom or a full one, but a cursory glance around the office showed that he had beaten the vast majority of the reporters to work. Well, it was only 5:54 am, after all; he supposed his odds had been good.
In response to such a delightfully obscene remark, Draco hurled his wand unthinkingly at Harry, who blocked it with raised arms as he laughed like a child.
“I suppose to the rest of the world, I’ll never be anything but Draco Malfoy, Death Eater,” he continued, his voice robotic. “It doesn’t matter if I've changed; I’ll never redeem myself. I will never be good enough--”
“Don’t, Potter,” Draco demanded authoritatively, lifting both hands to stop him from coming any closer. Harry just barely resisted the impulse to shove those hands aside and tackle him to the ground. (What he might do once he’d pinned him to the floor was another matter entirely; kiss him or hit him… it was anyone’s guess, really.)
“You look after me,” Harry remarked in an all-too-sweet voice, helping himself to another sip. He shifted his body slightly so that he was leaning closer to Draco.
“He was adamant,” she reiterated. “Believe me, Malfoy, I don’t understand it either, but he wants you. Obviously he doesn’t hate you as much as we both thought. Must’ve been quite the coffee date.”
“And what illness has befallen you so suddenly that you were unable to floo work until mere minutes before your shift began?”
Well, it was out. He’d finally said it. He'd never felt so vulnerable before, but he refused to run from it. He stayed inside the fear, with Draco.
Harry groaned in that sexy way that had become one of Draco’s absolute favorite sounds. “You’re a bad influence on me, Malfoy.”
After a minute or two of glorious snogging, Draco pulled his lips away. He took a handful of Harry’s hair in his fingers and tugged gently. “You might kill me, Potter.”
“Hush,” Draco told him, reaching for his warm hands again before proceeding. “Nothing permanent, only some pain in my head and neck. The Healers explained that I should try not to move them until tomorrow. They gave me a potion while I was there, but it doesn’t take full effect for twelve hours. In other words, I should be completely fine by morning.”
Harry leaned in once again at Draco’s silence, and Draco forced himself to pull out of Harry’s tight embrace. It felt like leaving the warm hearth of a fireplace in a frozen room.
Draco wanted to plunge into this topic desperately, to ask Harry why he’d initiated it, to tell him that the feel of their fingers brushing up against each other had lit up his body more than any sex he’d ever had, and to ask Harry what he thought that could mean.
“And I still say you think that way because you really don’t give yourself enough credit, Draco,” Harry said. “You’re good at talking to people. Most of the time.”
Draco peered up at him; he had researched Harry’s training records, and he’d done far better than fine. Under the question, he scrawled,
Much as he hated to admit it, Draco was afraid to hear Harry talk like this. Draco was still insecure about this relationship, and he hated that. Every negative thing he had ever thought about himself--and there were plenty--was magnified when he compared himself to Harry. No matter how his boyfriend tried to reassure him, Draco didn’t think he could ever fully erase the fear that Harry might one day realize that he was too good for him. If anyone was going to lose someone, it would be Draco losing Harry.
“Well… they probably felt like they were being ambushed,” Harry replied, looking down at his lap in shame. The three of them may not tell each other everything anymore, but Harry knew this should have been an exception. God, his friends really did put up with a lot where he was concerned.
Draco snorted. “It’s quite the departure from the way I grew up, I know. But yes, I rather like it as well.”
He balled his hands into fists and futilely tried to slow his heart rate down. Suddenly he was deeply regretting that fourth cup of coffee.
“Well, we’ve agreed to it now, haven’t we?” Ron shrugged, echoing his thoughts. “Anyway, as long as Hermione doesn’t mind, I don’t mind. I reckon we’ll see what happens when he gets here, eh? Get enough alcohol in him, and it might make for a good floor show after dinner.”
“Well stop fucking looking at me then!” Draco shouted. “Just leave me and find yourself some equally perfect bloke who you can show off to your perfect family. Go back to that Draco clone that you were seeing before you wrote me that first letter. He’ll be a great replacement boyfriend for you. Far fewer issues, far less drama.”
Draco tore a sheet from the back of his notes and slid it across the table as he said, “Well… I can’t wait to see the Weasley castle.”
When Harry arrived at the Farewell Point later that evening, Draco was waiting to greet him with a cup of tea and a sloppy kiss. The intermittent rain of the past few days had finally cleared, taking the bitter chill with it, and the air was now fresh and fragrant.
“I hope I see you again, stranger,” Draco told him before he walked toward the door with a wave that seemed like more of a salute.
“You’ve hated me for ten years,” Harry retorted. “I’d be disappointed if you gave up the habit now.”
might be thinking, I feel nothing but hopeful when it comes to us. More than hopeful: I feel pretty damn certain, honestly.”
Potter rolled his eyes as he shoved the cloak in his pocket. “Don’t get your wand in a knot. I just mean there are… signs.”
“It’s just the facts, Potter,” Draco said bitterly. “We all lost something in the war, not just the good guys.”
Draco cringed a little, until he realized that everything she said was the truth. Well, he’d always appreciated that Rosalind didn’t mince words, even if they did cut him to the quick.
Draco resisted the urge to turn around and face the very real possibility that, if he hadn’t dreamed the whole night entirely, Harry had already left. He wasn’t sure he could bear the idea. He held his breath and listened closely for a hint that he wasn’t alone.
“Because I have a lovely boyfriend who constantly tells me how handsome and wonderful I am,” Harry boasted with a grin. “If I’m a narcissist, it’s completely your fault, really.”
“No, you’re not that bad,” Draco agreed, smiling softly at him. “Though I rather like the thought of you being bad.”
“Fuck you, Harry Potter,” Draco whispered, his voice suddenly devoid of any heat. He felt his face crumple as hot tears spilled out of his eyes.
“That’s literally the worst answer I have ever heard in my life,” Harry said in disbelief. “Everyone knows you make sure your loved ones are out first, then you go for photographs and memorable trinkets and things. You don’t think about what happens next, you just grab and go.”
“Damn… that’s a bit of a mean thing to say,” Harry said quietly, all of his optimism shrinking away.
“It means you’re the most hot and cold person I know,” Harry answered. “One minute you’re addressing me like I’m just some acquaintance that you barely tolerate, and the next, you’re calling me cute and kissing my hand like a bloody hero in a romance novel.”
“And now I’ve spent the evening recuperating,” Draco replied calmly. “Thanks to your doting, of course.”
“I notice that you’re choosing to bring this up mere moments before you walk out the door,” Draco mumbled, though he smiled at Harry as he said it.
When Harry woke the next morning, his thoughts crept into his mind in a far more orderly fashion than usual, much like one of the lists in his journal:
But Draco didn’t move. He kept his knee right where it was, nestled up steadfastly against Harry’s, and Harry was frozen to the spot. He couldn’t even turn his head, though he was dying to see Draco’s face just then.
“Yes, you raging prat, I do,” Harry said, once again answering Draco’s thoughts. Draco smiled at him, and Harry smiled back.
“Yeah... Okay,” Harry said, and Draco wanted to believe he heard some reluctance in the words. “Well, hey, I reckon I won’t see you till Friday, at Ron and Hermione’s.”
“And you agree with that label?” Draco asked. “We’re in a relationship, we’re together, we’re a couple?”
“I love you, too,” Draco replied, and it somehow still didn’t feel like enough. “I love you, Harry. I’ll always love you.”
Draco smiled and followed the sudden impulse to lean his head onto Harry’s shoulder. It felt warm, hard, reassuring under him, and it wasn’t more than a few seconds before he felt Harry’s head on top of his own.
“Look, I know it was a shit thing to do, and I really am sorry,” Harry said humbly. “Am I in trouble?”
Harry shrugged, blushing a little. “I may have made a floo call to St Mungo's while you were in the shower.”
Harry let out a somewhat frustrated groan and took a full step back, shifting on his feet. He ran a hand through his hair and looked up at Draco.
“Of course it is,” Draco replied gently. Harry was right: he had hashed out more than enough hard topics for one evening. “Next time.”
Draco nodded, sitting back slightly. Harry linked their fingers together and Draco grinded his arse against Harry’s cock.
Draco started to ease off of Harry only when he knew Harry was finally coming down from the high. Draco met Harry’s hooded eyes once more, and he would’ve sworn on his life that, in that moment, they could read each other’s minds.
“Alright,” Ramesh finally stated once the preliminaries were finished, scanning one of the papers on the table. “We’re aware that you’re the victim here, Mr Malfoy, so this is nothing to be nervous about; we’re just trying to flesh out the situation.”
Harry pursed his lips in that distracting way he must’ve developed since leaving Hogwarts. “Well, I kind of just… get lost?”
“I’d prefer not to get into the details of my personal life,” Draco stated, “but suffice it to say, it didn’t exactly end well. Alex, perhaps understandably, faulted me for that.”
That being said, it was the circumstances which surprised Draco so much. He, a (former) Death Eater, having a beer with Harry fucking Potter. And not only were they not killing each other, but they were actually enjoying each other’s company. Draco was, at least.
He leaned back and Harry groaned softly, loosening his grip on Draco’s waist. Draco unhurriedly unclasped each button of his own shirt, drinking in the mesmerized way in which Harry was watching him.
It was the last thing Draco had expected. He had no words, so he just kept staring at Harry’s emerald eyes. He could feel his knuckles go white around the handle of his mug.
Even though he was facing the other way, Harry could feel Draco’s eyes on his back as he ran his fingers along the orderly wooden desk in the far corner of the cubicle.
He wordlessly took Harry’s proffered hand and they walked back into the house. Draco walked through the kitchen while Harry shut the back door behind him.
“Bloody hell,” Ron shuddered, and he gulped back a long sip of tea. “Part of me was still hoping it was a joke.”
So this one is, again, a whole lotta dialogue (are we sensing a pattern?). But I'm sorry to tell you it's entirely plotless lol. Seriously, I feel very on the fence about this chapter in general, so I hope it’s at least... okay??? (Like actually. I don’t know how I feel about this, y’all...errrggghh.)
“Oh, that’s right, I’d forgotten,” Draco said, shifting lazily onto his back and leaning up on his elbows with a yawn. “It’s a good thing you woke up when you did.”
“I put up a better fight than last time, though, eh?” Ron asked him with a genial grin, before chugging back the rest of Hermione’s tea.
“Harry?” he said, standing up and taking a step towards him with a sweet smile. As much as Harry loved Draco’s unruffled composure, he couldn’t help but melt at the way Draco looked in rare moments like these: an unguarded Draco was a beautiful Draco. “What are you doing here?”
“Well, what does it matter?” Draco bellowed waspishly, the blood pumping heavily in his veins. “We’re not teenagers anymore, Potter. It’s not as if we’re unable to manage finding each other slightly attractive. Good grief, are you incapable of being mature about anything?”
“Hey, when did you first start fancying me?” Harry asked in his random way, tracing mindless patterns up and down Draco’s bare arm.
Draco laughed at him and squeezed his hands. “Well, you’re wrong. Very wrong. About every part of that sentence.”
“I’ll be good, Draco,” Harry said then, in such a deliciously naughty voice that the words themselves were entirely nullified, and Draco was immediately convinced that being good was the worst idea Harry had ever had.
“As I said,” Draco continued, his cheeks tinged with pink, “I think we need to establish boundaries. I’m the reporter, you’re the subject, and that’s that.”
Harry flushed with pleasure until he remembered, rather despondently, that he didn’t look like himself at the moment.
Draco couldn’t help but laugh with him, because that did make him feel better (the first part, anyway). Although he was now inconveniently wondering whether Harry preferred to top or bottom.
“Well hurry up!” Draco spat, painfully aware that this was the wrong way to go about things, but unable to stop himself. Potter was just so… maddening! "We've lost enough time as it is!"
“Draco, what the hell?” he yelled, nearly knocking the chair over as he flailed about, his unbridled anger making him look twelve years old again. Somehow that alone comforted Draco immensely. “Will you please fucking explain? You’re weirding me out!”
“Both of them heard someone shout, so they both stood to see what was happening,” she explained, jumping into things with all the usual vigor of a reporter with a juicy story. “Henderson attested that she saw the red light over the wall of your cubicle--and only one red light, mind you, which pretty much rules out that Morris could’ve been acting against you in self-defence. That’s also lucky.”
They both sighed then, and Draco was surprised when Harry suddenly leaned forward and sucked on his nipple. Draco felt his cock twitch.
Draco glanced swiftly around the small, cluttered office and noticed that Weasley had lit a cozy fire on the opposite wall. He instantly felt more at ease, and he stepped forward to approach the desk. Draco cleared his throat and Weasley finally glanced away from his paperwork.
Draco obeyed, setting his wand in his lap as he perched himself, as dignified as was possible, on the rickety old stool.
He exited the shower and toweled off quickly, rubbing lotion on his arms, the kind that Harry loved the smell of. He left his hair untamed, the way Harry liked, and stayed naked, like Harry told him he should always be.
“It’s entirely up to you whether you wish to disclose your sexuality to the public, Potter,” Draco said gently. “You certainly shouldn’t feel pressured either way. Rest assured, nothing you would rather keep private will make it into this feature. I know it may be hard for you to believe this, but you can count on my discretion.”
Draco smiled, oddly flattered that Potter was still seemingly in the habit of observing him and had thus noticed how he had prepared his tea.
Draco merely rolled his eyes, but Harry could tell he was trying not to smile again. “I hope you’re aware of how utterly ridiculous you are.”
Harry didn’t respond to that, but a moment later, he nudged Draco slightly away from him and rolled to his side so that they were facing each other, with only inches between them. Draco’s heart started to race as soon as he looked into Harry’s bright green eyes. He felt himself smiling again; he’d given up trying to fight that particular impulse several hours ago. Lucky for Draco, Harry was always smiling back at him.
“Your friends all hexed me after fourth year!” Draco continued, feeling anything but relaxed now. “In front of my friends!”
“Sorry, I suppose you wore me out,” Draco said through his smile. “One of these weekends I’ll truly shock you and manage to stay awake the entire time.”
Oh god, why was he always saying things like that? Draco had to be very careful, and he knew it. Harry made him want to cross every line and break every rule.
Finally, after several seconds of uncomfortably staring at each other, Potter blurted out, “You set a snake on me when we were twelve!”
As Harry and Draco made their way into the kitchen side by side, Hermione tottered off down the hall, tossing befuddled glances over her shoulder as she went.
And it summed up everything he felt, that name. Harry, who would defend him against any attack. Harry, who would take his hands and call him honey and look at him as if he was a human being, not a villain. Harry, his safe place to land.
“I think we can get away with ‘pet’ in public,” Harry argued, flipping gracelessly onto his stomach. “You’ll just sound a bit like a gran. But you kind of talk like a gran already, no? So it fits.”
Draco shrugged, a little distracted; Harry’s exasperation was nearly as adorable as that confounded pout of his. Good grief, every damn thing Potter did seemed to unleash a raging flurry of emotions in him.
Finally he arrived at his desk, where he saw that Rosalind had already left him one of her pale orange notes.
As cute as Harry’s reaction was, Draco was afraid that the delicate early-morning spell was breaking. He wanted this moment to last as long as possible, for all of Harry’s warmth to keep permeating his skin. He clutched Harry’s arm--hard as a rock, oh Merlin--and held him there.
“‘Mr Potter, who evidently hates formal titles, appears to be prematurely losing his memory, as he seems to have forgotten that he was the one to bestow that flattering nickname upon Mr Malfoy.’”
However, once nearly an hour had passed and there was still no sign of him, Harry vanished the cold tea and began to wonder what on earth he might still be doing at the Proffice. He took out his broomstick and started polishing it just to distract himself, but of course it didn’t work.
“Perhaps,” Draco replied, keenly inspecting his face. “Though you did say we knew each other. And now that I think of it, your voice is a bit familiar as well… your manner of speaking, anyway. Hmm.”
“Yeah,” he answered, flashing him a thumbs-up, because he remembered Draco smiling the last time he’d done so. “Took a while for us to match up our schedules, but we can all make Friday evening work, if you can. Ron’s off that day, and Hermione is theoretically off at four, but she never leaves on time, so we settled on meeting up around half five. The seventeenth, or whatever date Friday is.”
“Of course you would ignore the arrogant and self-involved part.” Harry rolled his eyes. “But yes, you certainly are impossible to forget.”
“Harry James Potter,” he scolded as he approached. “What on earth are you doing, sitting out here alone in the rain?”
Draco sighed. He had a few guesses as to Alex’s motives (none of which he wanted to dwell on), but absolutely none regarding his whereabouts.
“Erm… toast. And bacon.” Draco gave his head a quick shake and pulled out two plates for them. “I ran out of eggs the other day, though, and I haven’t had a chance to do any shopping. Cast a warming charm on your tea, but everything else should still be hot.”
He pulled back for a moment to appreciate the way Harry looked in that instant. His eyes were closed, his arm was flung over his head, and his mouth was wide open. He looked so thoroughly aroused that Draco knew he wouldn’t last long either. Draco wanted to stop time and stare at him, just like this, until the end of his days.
Draco thought once again of Harry picking up Ginny’s quaffle, but this time the thought made him want to start sobbing.
Harry pushed aside his righteous indignation and looked at the card more closely. “David McKinnon,” he read aloud. He couldn’t help the snort that escaped him. Thinking of Draco as a David was nothing short of bizarre.
“Why do I get the feeling she still hates me?” Draco asked Harry as he looked around the quaint little kitchen. “Not that I don’t deserve it, obviously.”
“Is that so?” Harry asked him, turning around and smiling beatifically at Draco. He walked over to the table, hovering the two heaping plates of food as he came.
Harry groaned in frustration. “Are we going to keep discussing this until I come up with a reason? Because I don’t even think there really
“I’ll do it,” he said, stronger. “I’ll do it, Ms Peters, and it will be the best damn feature you’ve ever read.”
“Just pure horror.” Draco laughed out loud. “Merlin, it’s funny to me now, but it was rather traumatizing for both parties at the time. She realized her lifelong crush was officially fruitless, and I realized I would never kiss another woman for the rest of my life.”
Draco saw no point in arguing with him about it. Harry’s humility would prevent him from seeing how perfect he was, which, of course, was part of his perfection.
Harry rested his knee against Draco’s, and he felt the familiar heat, the fluttering of snitches all through his body.
“So I finally apparate to their house,” Harry continued, “and Ron hands me a butterbeer, and we all gather around their kitchen table and have a nice normal conversation about our jobs. I could tell they were both curious about why I was there, when I’d just seen them yesterday, but they didn’t ask me. But then eventually Hermione tells me I’ve been looking really happy lately, and she says it kind of suspiciously. So I figure that’s my lead-in.”
Harry shrugged, looking maybe just a little proud of himself. “Can we stop talking about me now, please?”
Draco bit his lip and released another moan, stroking himself a little faster now that he knew Harry was watching him. Sure enough, when he looked over at Harry, he was frozen in the kitchen doorway, staring at Draco with his mouth open, entirely rapt.
They furiously stroked each other, the sound of their slippery cocks making Draco practically mad with lust. Suddenly Harry took both of them in his hand, rubbing them at the same time. Draco nearly screamed. He was close, so close to coming. He had never been so hard in his life.
“You still get angry with me,” Draco chuckled. He moved his hand downward and Harry felt his cool fingers hooking over the collar of his t-shirt.
“Oh god,” Harry mumbled into his arms, “that has to have been at least an hour’s worth of questions, right? I’ve talked more about myself in the last hour than I have in my entire life.”
“And do you still feel that way?” Harry asked, running his thumb across the neck of his butterbeer bottle in a way that Draco found quite distracting. “That people should want to be friends with you, that you’re better than others?”
When Harry licked his lips, Draco had to lean forward and kiss him, as slowly and intimately as he could, gliding their tongues together.
It wasn’t that he wanted to make a good impression on Harry’s friends, because that would be naive and foolish, and Draco was neither of those things. Anyway, that ship had sailed, he thought sadly. After all, even if they had agreed to open their home to him, there was no guarantee that Granger and Weasley would forgive him for his past wrongs, as Harry had so graciously done. And why should they?
“I have a type, it seems,” Harry continued. “At least when it comes to blokes. For some reason I’m less picky when it comes to girls.”
“You baked for me?” Harry said, placing a hand over his heart and looking as if he might cry. “Really?”
,’ Draco had said then (Harry still thought about that comment at least ten times a day). When Draco shot him a brief, bashful glance, he knew Draco was remembering it as well, and Harry was positive that he was going to feel off-kilter for the rest of the evening.
“I can’t help it,” Harry muttered. “As obsessed as I am with Teddy, weekends are the only time you and I spend together. And now I’m missing a full day of Draco time.”
“Realistic,” Draco corrected, swatting his arm. “So what happened then? Did Weasley eventually come around?”
“Well you’ve done it three times already,” Harry said. “Doing anything three times makes it official.”
Harry let out a long hum and leaned back off his elbows again, resting his hands on Draco’s back. “Yes, this is where you should be.”
“‘Intriguing’ is certainly a compliment,” Draco said, sipping his coffee. The way he was staring at him was almost indecent. It felt like a challenge. Harry’s skin was burning.
“Well, someone has to,” Harry said with a grin, firing another bean at Draco. “Are you going to tell me about the rest of your exes now?”
Draco waited for him to expand, and when he didn’t, Draco flicked his wand so that a single Bertie Bott bean from the bowl hit Harry sharply on the forehead. “Focus, Potter!”
“Well, come around the other side then,” he suggested. “Your bed is massive, there’s ample room for both of us.”
“No more questions tonight, remember?” Harry asked with a grin. “Feels good to be the one saying that for a change.”
“Don’t you dare fucking stop being loud,” Harry ordered, the sincerity in his tone sounding almost menacing. “Your moaning is the hottest thing I’ve ever heard in my life.”
“Well…” Draco began. “Do you remember when I came to your house after the attack? And I explained to you what the cephalia curse was, its effects, and the like?”
Harry closed his eyes for several seconds, and when he opened them again, his face was pure happiness. “I love you, too.”
He gave his head a quick shake. This was exactly why he needed to redefine some boundaries between them. All of the lines were far too blurred; Draco could no longer see them anymore. He couldn’t see much of anything at the moment, only Harry, kneeling in front of him…
“At least remove your shoes,” Draco grumbled, rubbing the back of his neck, eyes glued to Harry’s arse and feet frozen to the ground. He wanted to weep for how comically adorable he was, and simultaneously to scream at him to stop being so fucking tempting.
“Look,” Draco said as he trailed behind him, down the hall and up the stairs. “I’m not sure why you’re suddenly lying to me, but if I did something to anger you, then I apologize.”
“Not until you, apparently,” he said, in a voice that made Harry’s insides turn to gold. “You are an extraordinarily attractive man, after all, though you’re somehow totally unaware of the fact.”
Harry took a long swig of butterbeer, and Draco chewed on his bottom lip for a moment, trying to read Harry’s eyes. He couldn’t this time.
Draco shivered again; he could feel his cock stiffening. The mental images changed: Harry’s obedient mouth around his prick, roughly pulling Harry’s hair, fucking Harry’s throat mercilessly until he finished, Harry looking up at him with obedient green eyes, Draco’s come leaking out of Harry’s mouth and streaming down his chin.
it all felt. Harry’s nonstop moans and the look on his face told Draco that he was right on the edge, just as Draco was. Draco kept moving for as long as he could, but he knew he was about to come.
Draco tucked his arms inside Harry’s robes and perched his hands on the very top of Harry’s arse, just low enough to be considered improper.
But Draco was afraid. He didn’t want to open up this particular Pandora’s box, because what if Harry slammed it shut? He didn’t want to ask Harry if he’d thought about him at all during their six-day break, because what if he hadn’t? Draco couldn’t stand the idea that his undefined but ever-strengthening feelings for Harry might be one-sided, even though Harry’s actions and words hinted at the fact that they were at least somewhat reciprocated. Somehow, however, that was even more terrifying, and so Draco did what he usually did: he ignored the issue and hoped it would go away on its own.
“I’ll never be good enough for you,” he said, suddenly sobbing. “Even your best friends think you’re mental…”
“And what’s wrong with my clothes, Potter?” he asked, more than a little defensive. Certainly he tended to dress a little more formal than most people, but he quite liked looking sharp every day.
Draco shrugged. “Guilty as charged. I suppose I’m old-fashioned. Regardless of it being a somewhat farcical marriage, our vows meant something to me, and I took them seriously.”
“Only around you,” Potter grumbled. “It’s been this way for ten bloody years. No one else gets to me the way you do, and I don’t understand why.”
“Alright, then we could end up quarreling too much,” Draco suggested. “We’re already quarreling about this, if you hadn’t noticed.”
“Right after the Dark Lord was defeated.” Draco furrowed his brow. “What is that, three years ago now? Four?”
Draco was starting to feel genuinely panicked as he pulled the chair out and took a seat. His throat had gone dry, so he conjured himself a glass of water and took a swig.
“Okay, okay, sorry,” he said, not sounding sorry in the slightest. “But it’s weird, you asking me things and me not asking back.”
“What time is it?” Draco asked, reaching his arm down and lacing his fingers between Harry’s. He slowly opened his eyes and peered out his window at a dusty blue sky.
Harry gave him that heart-stopping half smile again, but he wordlessly left the sitting room, moving about the place and into the kitchen as if he owned it rather than Draco. Draco couldn’t decide if he was angry about that or ecstatic.
He aimed his wand at the radio, which turned on immediately to a preset muggle rock station. Ordinarily it took Draco at least two tries. He couldn’t help himself; he turned a boisterous grin at Harry.
Draco felt like his chest had just cracked open, and a little bit of Harry’s sun shone through. Draco was very accustomed to cracking open, but he wasn't used to sunshine.
Draco shook his head in exasperation and dropped the floo powder with trembling fingers, another mortifying giggle escaping his lips. He needed to get the hell out of there before he did something he would later regret.
Rosalind had been his only visitor during his brief hospital stay, and after Draco regained consciousness, she had explained the situation to him with uncharacteristic patience. Draco was incredibly touched and grateful that she’d been there for him.
Draco felt himself shiver at Harry’s gentle touch on his wrist, at the look on Harry’s face, at the way his name sounded rolling off Harry’s tongue… and at his genuine words.
The irony wasn’t lost on Harry that he had managed to deal with his problems far better when he was actually experiencing them in real-time; it was only long after the danger had passed that Harry truly felt the effects of it. It was a little exasperating that the horrors of his past kept him up at night more often now, at twenty-seven, than they had when he was a teenager.
“With bells on?” Harry asked, poking at his arm playfully. Draco thought they might have to get some sobering potion in him before they did anything else.
Once Draco had finally finished making his tea, he leaned back against the countertop and cleared his sore throat.
“I shouldn’t have brought that up,” Harry said softly after a moment. “And I didn’t mean to make you feel bad about crying. But yes, it does surprise me. A lot of things have surprised me tonight, Malfoy.”
There was a long pause, and Draco tried his hardest to just breathe and focus on the way the flames danced in the fireplace.
Draco hastily exited her office, but after he had taken three steps he stopped dead, as everything hit him all at once. The man he had been daydreaming about for two days, the man who had so captivated him, the man he had once hated, the man who had once hated him…
“Isn’t it the hosts’ job to ask me that?” Draco asked curiously, pulling the satchel off of his (perfect) body. “And to tidy up, for that matter?”
Harry snorted and took a calming breath. Yes, the more distance between himself and Draco, the easier it was to breathe.
“I like how you kiss me goodbye,” Harry muttered against his lips when they drifted apart. “Like I’m a soldier going off to war.”
Draco felt the bile rising in his throat and scrambled to find equilibrium, let alone something to say that would undo even a breath of the pain Harry must have gone through. But Draco, as usual, could not muster up a single right thing to say.
“I would wager a mild July, followed by a warmer August.” Draco added another spoonful. “Perhaps a late-summer heat wave to usher in September?”
Sod it; he decided to throw caution to the wind, because he had nothing to lose. Why not flirt with him? It wasn’t as if Malfoy knew who he was. And so what if he found out? What did it matter, really? Sure, in the back of his mind, he knew it was a bad idea, but when had he ever been able to resist a bad idea, particularly a bad idea in the shape of Draco Malfoy? Anyhow, it had been far too long since Harry had taken a risk just for the fun of it.
Draco chuckled as they slowly made their way through the lobby side by side. “You and I are the very definition of a conflict of interest.”
He tried to sift through Draco’s deluge of questions, aware that ‘I don’t know’ wouldn’t help him much.
Harry sighed into Draco’s mouth and brushed his tongue against Draco’s. Draco eagerly returned the favor, running his tongue in a circle over Potter’s once, twice, three times.
“Well I’m sorry for showing up eight fucking minutes late,” Harry declared. “And for calling you names.”
When they got there, Harry outright flung Draco back onto his bed and Draco yelped, then giggled. Harry’s face lit up in a smile, and he took his glasses off and set them on the nightstand before he leaned down and crawled up over Draco and kissed him deeply. Harry tasted like Draco’s cinnamon toothpaste and marmalade, and Draco hummed contentedly into his mouth as he placed his hands on either side of Harry’s neck.
Draco rolled his eyes. He found that he rather liked being called sweetheart, even if it was used in a teasing manner.
He forced himself to face the more likely possibility that he was merely jealous: marriage and children were everything Harry wanted, and while he was truly overjoyed that Ron and Hermione were getting those things, it was depressing to stand by and watch while his life stayed frozen where it was.
Harry released a long breath, somewhere between a sigh and a groan. “I didn’t think it mattered who I was.”
He clenched his fists and marched through the hallway, down the stairs, into the fireplace, out of his own floo, into the lofty entry of Astoria’s grand estate (calling it ‘home’ had never felt quite right, even in his mind), up the stairs, down the hallway, and into his bedroom.
, and you were looking at me so intensely, and I was just thinking, oh fuck me, those damn eyes. Oh, and then again when we were walking home, the first time you laughed. That was like a punch in the stomach. And honestly by the time I walked through your front door I knew I was not leaving until I’d at least kissed you.”
“There are a few reasons,” Draco said quietly. He cast a sidelong glance at Harry, and suddenly Harry felt just as anxious as Draco looked.
“Blimey, I wonder what that’s like, being constantly surprised by someone?” Harry asked sarcastically, finally smirking at him.
Draco realized he had just essentially admitted to fancying Potter in school. Bugger, if he wasn’t just a champion at cocking things up.
“What’s the matter?” Draco asked, sitting up straight and immediately feeling on edge. He turned and faced Harry, sitting cross-legged.
getting pissed. But I’m pretty used to drinking--not to mention that I easily outweigh your skinny arse--and can therefore handle my alcohol much better than you. I’m barely tipsy yet.”
Draco wanted to acquiesce, wanted to dive across the room into Harry’s arms and make camp there permanently. But he held to his pride a little longer.
Potter stared at him and, tellingly, his head tilted to the side once again. Draco might’ve smiled, if he hadn’t felt so awkward about what he had just said.
!) out on a bloody date, and now he was interviewing him for a bloody newspaper. Life was a funny thing indeed.
“Only when I want him,” Draco amended. “And I’ve never wanted a man the way that I’ve wanted you, Harry."
“Lecturing me on bed sheets and preparedness.” Harry chuckled. “You’re very responsible. I think you would be good with Teddy.”
“You’ve made an uncharacteristically wise move, using your adorable baby as a distraction from the potential awkwardness,” Draco told him.
“Of course we can,” Harry nodded, forcing a smile. “Let’s get the fuck out of here before I kill a man.”
Harry didn’t reply to that, and Draco smiled to himself; rendering Harry speechless was among his favorite things to do. Instead, Harry sighed deeply against Draco’s neck and kissed it gently, over and over, as if Draco wasn’t just the most precious thing in his world, but the
Draco leapt into the shower and gave himself a swift but vigorous scrub, pulling at his cock every so often in order to tease himself. He would have no problem staying hard until Harry arrived; the thought of being caught jerking off, even if it was planned, turned Draco on.
He simply couldn’t pretend anymore; this week apart had shown him, plain as day, that he felt something deeper than just a crush, something immense and terrifying and… well, singularly wonderful. He didn’t know what to do with it. (Aside from masturbate, obviously. Draco had been wanking himself raw the whole damn week.)
“Essentially,” he replied. “It’s a composite of all the things I love to do. Writing, obviously, but also research, communication… over-analyzing absolutely everything.”
“I’m supposed to be finished by nine tonight, so as soon as I’m done work I’ll go home and change clothes and check on Ariadne, and then I’ll be off to Ron and Hermione’s.”
Harry’s breath was ragged as he stared at Draco’s mouth, his own mouth slightly open. He leaned forward and Draco felt himself do the same, drawn to Harry like he always had been.
“And I have sobering potion,” Harry continued. “I promise to give you some if you get too hammered and try to throw yourself at me.”
“That’s your second question,” Draco said, and Harry rolled his eyes. “I suppose it means… My mother spent her life ensuring that all her emotions remained in check. She never once allowed her composure to slip. She only gave power to the things she chose to give power to. Thus, she always had the upper hand. She was in control.”
“Sort of, but that was about Voldemort’s return,” Hermione explained. “This would be all about you.”
“Well, Ron obviously laughed when I said your name, because he assumed it was a joke. Which I totally called, by the way.”
Potter stared at the table for a moment longer but didn’t reply. Draco took a few swigs of his drink in an attempt to calm himself.
“If they hadn’t been alright with it…,” Draco asked him, suddenly looking very serious indeed, “if they’d said no, what would you have done?”
Mmm, Draco did love when Harry complimented him, and he loved it even more when Harry read his mind like that. He smiled and pulled Harry down for a deep, sloppy kiss. Draco drew away with a sharp gasp only a moment later, when he felt Harry’s hand grasping his cock.
Malfoy once again lifted his eyebrow in surprise and stared at him. “Is something about this funny?”
Harry looked like he knew just what it had taken Draco to ask, so he smiled and nodded energetically. “Love to. Lead the way.”
“Whatever it is, you can tell me later, okay?” Harry muttered under his breath as he took Draco’s coffee mug out of his shaking hand and set it on the large conference table. Ramesh took a seat next to Gareth at the opposite side of the table, which was already littered with papers, quills, and coffee cups.
“I’m just trying to process everything,” Draco said honestly. “It still boggles my mind, all of this. I mean, you just jerked me off in my kitchen, for Merlin’s sake.”
Ron gave him another knowing look as he stood up, lifting Rose with him. “Time for your bath, sweetness.”
“I see,” Ramesh said after a pause, his eyes flitting curiously between them both. “So, that might’ve been a factor in the assault?”
“You know,” Harry murmured, “I was determined to go do something just a moment ago, but now that you’re finally in my arms, I really don’t remember what that could have possibly been.”
It stormed in the evening, and that alone would have flooded Draco’s mind with Harry, had it not already been full of the man. He could easily picture him, standing pensively at his window in his ratty jeans and fitted white t-shirt, watching the lightning, one hand holding a mug of tea, the other resting casually in his pocket. Draco wondered if the storm had reached Wales, as well; whether they were observing it together. Even if Draco was watching it alone (which he was, really, either way; any fanciful notion to the contrary was perfectly foolish), there was something oddly romantic about this storm-watching thing of Harry’s. The way the air smelled, the magical energy in the atmosphere, how the rain turned the entire world the most awe-inspiring shade of green, just exactly like…
“Well at least I’m no longer being called a stranger,” Harry pointed out, shrugging nonchalantly despite his still-racing heartbeat.
“Well it mattered,” Draco argued. “You didn’t think I would want to know who I was bloody coming out to? Or that you were the one I was...”
“Please?” Harry asked, pouting playfully. Draco cursed that absurdly cute pout; it was a dangerous weapon.
“But if you split up with his brother so long ago--a year ago, you say--it doesn’t exactly explain why the perp chose to attack you now,” Gareth mused, fiddling with his wand, deep in thought. “It just seems so unprovoked. Are you sure there were no recent arguments? No particularly tense encounters?”
He knew his mother ran in a vastly different social circle from the Weasleys, but as he had pointed out to Harry earlier, this kind of information always had a way of getting back to her.
“Anyway, what’s the big deal?” Ron asked him. “You know me and Hermione don’t really care. Sure, he did a lot of shit things, but all of that’s ancient history.”
“You’re so smart,” Harry teased, and Draco thought Patrick bloody Hunter might have had a point: Harry’s smile really was the sun.
Draco let his most wicked self take over, feeling lewd and depraved as he rapidly beat off for his boyfriend. He was as loud as he could possibly be, and Harry drank it all in, the unbridled lust in his eyes driving Draco to his very limit.
“So? Complaints? Thoughts? Regrets?” he asked as he flopped onto his stomach in the bed beside Draco.
“It made me uncomfortable in a good way,” Harry said softly, resting his hand against Draco’s cheek. Draco leaned into it and kept looking into Harry’s eyes, unsure.
“You’re easy to compliment,” Harry continued, grinning broadly at him. “And I like complimenting you.”
to take it back, because it was the truest thing he’d ever said. Nonetheless, nerves clenched at him tightly as he looked down at Harry, searching for a reaction. But oh, the look Harry gave him. All the fear flew out of him in an instant.
I see you’re still a pompous ponce from our school days, too, but there’s no way that I’m surprised about that, either.
He ambled out to the sitting room so Harry would find him sooner, and he made himself comfortable--as comfortable as he could be whilst stark naked, at least. He closed his eyes, once again thinking of Harry. It wouldn’t take much for Draco to become fully hard; the real challenge would be waiting for Harry rather than finishing himself off alone.
Draco imagined that throwing his cloak over a date was one of many successful moves that Potter could have used to get laid, if he hadn’t been shackled to the Weaslette. Not that he and Potter were on a date. Not that Draco wanted Potter to try and pull him. Not that Draco was thinking that way at all. Potter wasn’t gay, and he had a girlfriend regardless.
Draco could only breathe out something like a laugh, feeling almost hysterically euphoric, his legs feeling like water.
Draco lifted an eyebrow but ignored the comment in favor of another sip of tea. Harry mentally kicked himself for trying to flirt yet again when he’d been rejected multiple times now. Competitive indeed.
His bold actions were well worth it: Draco was rewarded with a surprised Harry, wide-eyed and mouth agape.
When Harry still didn’t say anything, Draco just kept talking. “I’m even glad that you went out with that stupid bloke who made you think of me, because I
Draco inhaled sharply through his nose, and the smell of Harry filled his lungs, and everything around him and inside him and beyond him was Harry, and he had to leave. Right fucking now.
“Because you’re ashamed of me,” Draco whispered, the truth of it hitting him forcefully in the stomach.
“Let’s see if I understand this,” Ron said, bouncing Rose on his knee on the comfy two-person couch in their sitting room. “Draco sodding Malfoy works for the Daily Prophet, he’s the one interviewing you for the ten-year anniversary, he’s coming to our house tonight, and we’re all supposed to gather ‘round the fire and talk about you like we’re old chums.”
“Do you think you would’ve done anything differently?” Draco asked, writing furiously in his portfolio.
“I’ve dated around quite a bit since then, but nothing serious,” Harry said. “Well, the longest relationship after Natalie was Patrick Hunter. I suppose that was fairly serious, for a little while.”
“Do you always find yourself so at ease in other people’s houses as to show up shirtless at the breakfast table, Potter?”
For someone who couldn’t do legilimency to save his life, Harry really was very good at reading Draco’s thoughts. Draco smiled and kissed him once again.
He knew how small it sounded, but he meant it with all his heart. He hoped the words would convince them, nearly as much as he hoped they would convince himself.
He was reminded vaguely of when Harry had picked up the quaffle for the Weasley girl. Draco thought he would’ve quite liked it if Harry had picked up his quaffle, but he found he quite liked it when Harry made him tea, too.
“You love that too!” Harry smiled, backing out of the kitchen as if he simply couldn’t tear his eyes off of Draco. Finally he disappeared around the corner and into the hallway.
“He’s the love of my life,” Harry said, placing a hand on Draco’s face. “There’ll never be anyone else.”
He leaned forward and kissed Harry’s eyelids, then his nose, then his lips one more time. Draco just wanted to kiss Harry until they both faded away to nothing. He tilted his head up and slowly kissed Harry’s lightning bolt scar, light as a feather, three times. When he pulled back again, Harry’s eyes remained closed, but the smile on his face was blissful.
Harry took the not-so-subtle hint, however, and pulled himself away from Draco with one last kiss on the shoulder.
Draco couldn’t stop the giggle from fluttering from his lips. “Harry… Merlin’s sake, let’s get you into bed, shall we?”
know that. Because they’re good people, Draco, the very best I know, and they’ll forgive you just as I have.”
This was how it was always going to be, Draco realized in a sudden moment of clarity. Harry had a piece of his heart, and when he left, it logically followed that Draco would feel somehow… incomplete. Perhaps this worrying was merely another side effect of love. A most inconvenient one, at that.
“I want your final draft on my desk on the thirtieth,” she continued, glaring at him. “That gives you just under four weeks to do all of your interviewing, as well as write and rewrite the piece. And rewrite the bloody rewrites.”
Harry smiled down at the neat stack of papers. Of course Draco’s desk was immaculately tidy. A row of identical quills were lined up at the top right-hand corner, a half-full mug of coffee on the left. There was only one photograph pinned to the cubicle wall, a small but formal picture of Draco and his mother gazing haughtily at the camera. The items surrounding the photograph were less personal: a couple of memos, a Daily Prophet crest, several jotted-on sticky notes. Harry took one last look at the photograph before turning to face Draco again.
“‘Babe’ is a new one,” Draco said, still smiling. “And I’d make it look a lot better if it actually fit me properly. But alas, my handsome boyfriend is far too muscular for his own good.”
He concentrated hard on speaking clearly as he dropped the handful of floo powder into the fire without further ado.
“And truth be told,” Draco continued, “my sense of loyalty to my family was very strong then, even after the war; so much so that I was willing to ignore my own desires in favor of my duty to the Malfoy name. As you can imagine, not many families were willing to attach themselves to us at the time. Well, that’s hardly changed. But when I married Astoria, I thought maybe we could try to restore some honor back to the disgraced house of Malfoy. Live differently than our parents had. Stand for good instead of evil. Repair the name.”
Harry looked down at his bottle and fiddled with the label nervously. Draco felt himself smile; it felt lovely.
“Nevertheless, I daresay you’re allowed to feel gloomy once in a while, Harry,” Draco said quietly. “And I want you to feel comfortable being yourself with me, because I’m always going to be here, regardless of your emotions. I’d like to be a safe space for you.”
Of course, Harry knew that Draco worked for a reputable newspaper and therefore couldn’t exactly use this opportunity to slander him on purpose, but he was still a little shocked to hear him say something so considerate. It also made him feel guilty all over again, having essentially tricked Draco into confessing his own sexuality.
Draco giggled and rolled off of him, sitting up in bed and facing backwards so he could see Harry. His heart skipped a beat or two as he looked at his beloved, one arm flung over his head, messy hair strewn across the pillow, a soft smile on his face. Harry reached up and laced his fingers into Draco’s hair, and they merely gazed at each other. Draco felt euphoric.
Oh god. Harry had said something about ‘doing it’… What on earth had he said? Had he made a pass at Draco sodding Malfoy!? He’d said something about sex… No, he’d said
“You work wonders for my self-esteem,” Harry chuckled, releasing his fingers and nudging his arm. “Good thing I already know I turn you on.”
“I never tell anyone anything,” he said, and then he felt unbearably sad to realize how true it was. “Except for this evening, evidently.”
He stood up abruptly--rather impressive, considering the state of him--and strolled out of the sitting room. Draco followed him, unsure why, but unable not to.
“Where’s your bloody jacket?” Draco asked testily, already feeling irked to be addressed by his wretched pseudonym.
He hadn’t thought twice about saying it, but Draco realized after the fact that his comment might’ve been a tad insensitive. However, one look at Harry silenced his fears and then some; heavens above, he could never have prepared himself for that expression.
Draco considered this, and he knew that Harry was right. He also knew that hearing that he was in a relationship with Harry Potter wouldn’t go down easily for his parents, no matter when he told them, so why not now?
Harry stepped after him aggressively, blood boiling, but Draco grasped his arm and held him back. He glared at the man’s back as he walked down the hall, and Draco finally released him. Immediately he fired a privacy spell around the cubicle to release some of his adrenaline.
Harry looked beyond pleased. “If you’re coming back, you can also expect an endless supply of my prick--”
Harry looked up at him, his eyes softening marginally but still looking bemused. “Okay? And that’s a bad thing?”
“I see,” Harry said, startled by his words. He dropped his arms back down to his sides. “So… are we done then?”
“Well, I suppose--” Draco shifted uncomfortably for a moment before picking up a fistful of floo powder. His glance shifted between the two of them for a moment, and he decided this was another chance for him to speak with courage.
Draco hadn’t been expecting that confession, but it made perfect sense. Perhaps Ron’s negative reaction to their relationship had been borne from jealousy rather than any real disdain. The thought gave him hope, and it made him oddly sympathetic to the Weasel. Good grief.
Draco followed his gaze, and through the tall wooden doors strode Harry, looking dashing in a splendid grey three-piece suit. Draco desperately wanted to go to him, but he couldn’t move from his seat.
“I love it when you come over,” Harry muttered out of nowhere, unfiltered and unable to stop himself. “I love having you here; you fit so well it’s like you’re a piece of the furniture. And when you leave, I can smell you all over the house for the rest of the night, and it makes it impossible to concentrate, and I love that, too.”
Lo and behold, to Draco’s shock, there sat Harry, outside on the garden bench in the middle of a misty rain, visible only by the dim flicker of light emitting from the tip of his wand.
Draco narrowed his gaze in confusion for only a second, but then realized in sudden horror what he had just unwittingly confessed to Potter.
Ron waved his wand, and two floral teacups hovered over to the desk as a matching tea pot poured a dark, steaming blend of tea into each cup.
Some plot at last! Lol. Sorry for making you wait for this chapter, but I really hope you enjoy it. As far as this story goes, the end is in sight, y’all. :S Maybe 2 chapters more to go? I appreciate your patience and your support so much, and I’ll see you soon. :)
“He’s right,” Hermione muttered in frustration. “Haven’t they gotten enough out of you over the years? How much more in-depth could they possibly wish to go, short of coming into your home and rifling through your underwear drawer?”
Draco swallowed the lump in his throat and turned to see that Ron and Harry were finally descending, merrily tossing the quaffle between them. Mercifully, Weasley looked to be only teasing him and, in true Weasley fashion, had sufficiently managed to ruin the moment. Draco couldn’t say he was too upset about that in this instance; he felt as if he’d just run the longest race of his life.
“Good afternoon,” Draco started, hesitant. In hindsight, he really should have rehearsed this before coming.
“That many?” Harry smiled softly. He’d been mostly ribbing him, but Draco’s face told him he had taken the teasing seriously. Harry thought that was painfully sweet.
Suddenly Harry flopped up and down clumsily as he rearranged himself so that he was sitting the same way Draco was, cross-legged and facing him. They were suddenly face to face, knees touching each other, just enough to be aware of. Draco looked up at him and their eyes locked.
“Hmm?” Harry opened his eyes halfway, the bright green peering lazily out at Draco, easy grin fixed in place. Without his glasses, Harry’s eyes were almost staggeringly arresting.
Harry beamed at him, more affected than he should’ve been to hear that Draco remembered something so insignificant as a dirt-flavored jelly bean from their last session.
“I’m really happy you’re okay,” Harry whispered back, and then he scooted forward a few inches, as close to Draco’s warm body as he dared, just to see what he would do.
“I remember,” Draco smiled at him, walking beside him into the kitchen with his writing supplies in hand.
“You’re avoiding my question, non-stranger,” Draco pointed out, and Harry thought his face looked a little defeated again. “I assure you, you’re at perfect liberty to tell me no, and I will absolutely understand. No pressure whatsoever.”
Rosalind chuckled ironically and held her glass aloft to him before taking an impressive gulp of whiskey. Draco sipped his tea. It made him miss Harry’s.
“You just do that sometimes; we’re going along all flirty and teasing and then you say something so profoundly romantic that it makes my heart stop. It always shocks me.”
“I mean to other people, Harry,” Draco said. He placed his hand cautiously on Harry’s stomach again.
“Of course I want to fuck you, Harry,” he answered, unable to stop himself. “I want to bend you over this table right now and spread your arse open, use my mouth to stretch your hole for my cock, and pound you till you’re moaning my name like it’s a prayer.”
Sure enough, Draco Malfoy turned around at that precise moment, briefly scanning the coffee shop as he waited for his order. Before Harry could hide his face (unnecessarily, he realized after the fact, as he was unrecognizable under the glamor charm), Draco caught sight of him.
The spiel worked. Draco stilled in Harry’s arms and nodded at him; the authority in Harry’s voice left him speechless.
“Now you know how I felt at the pitch last week, Potter,” Draco teased him. “Impatience runs in the family, I see.”
Had this serendipitous late-night reunion even entered into the realm of possibility in Harry’s mind, he might’ve mapped out how he thought it would go. Would he ever have expected Malfoy to apologize? To talk to him with dignity and kindness and a comfortable familiarity? To
“I’m fine,” Draco assured him, almost smiling at Harry’s very typical impatience. “According to the Healers, Alex used a variant of the cephalia curse, which essentially produces strong concussive symptoms in the victim. Luckily, there were still two or three reporters working at the time of the attack, so I was taken to St Mungo’s straight away. According to their reports, Alex fled the scene immediately.”
Had Draco thought about it for more than a moment, he would have been anxious that he was about to give a man oral sex for the first time in his life. But he couldn’t find it in himself to be nervous; he wanted this too much.
As he made his way down the high street, he tried to focus on the sound of his breathing in order to calm his mounting anxiety. Due to a sprinkling of rain and a deep chill in the air, the bustling street was quieter than it had been when Draco had last visited two days previous, but he didn’t mind the thinner crowds in the slightest.
“I love you,” Harry whispered back, nearly choking on the words as he clasped their hands together, helping Draco to balance.
“No, it’s bizarre and ridiculously inconvenient,” Harry laughed, and Draco scribbled something down. “Oh, hey, I’ve just remembered, I asked Ron and Hermione and they agreed to be interviewed.”
Harry didn’t reply, but he moved one arm a little tighter around Draco’s back and let his other hand finger Draco’s hair. They laid like that for several minutes, quietly letting the fire and the radio lull them. Draco felt the beat of Harry’s heart against his head, and it made him feel like they were one person.
Draco felt surprisingly touched by that statement, despite the heat of the moment. He took another sip of water and tried to ignore the way his hands trembled.
“Most wands can’t be destroyed by ordinary fire,” Draco explained, putting his blazer on. “They’re nearly always equipped with protective enchantments against certain basic hazards, one of which is fire. Honestly, did you learn nothing at Hogwarts?”
“Rapid-fire,” Draco told him, sitting at the table again and rubbing his hands together. “I ask you something straightforward and you simply tell me the first thing that pops into your head. We’ll start with the easiest questions, nothing deep. No overthinking your answers, and certainly no follow-up questions from you.”
“People tend to treat my scar like it’s… I dunno, off limits or something, tainted somehow. No one ever even touches it, but you licked it, like it’s just something normal, another nondescript part of me. It felt very, very nice. I promise. You can definitely do it again.”
“Good! I say leave ‘em hanging,” Ron boisterously chimed in, lifting his bottle in the air. “People have hounded you for more than half your life. You don’t owe them anything now.”
Harry released a soft groan and scratched his bare stomach. His breathing was becoming steadier and deeper, and Draco knew he was falling back to sleep already, if he had even been fully awake to begin with.
Finally Draco smiled. She was right; this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for him, despite the inevitable awkwardness that the next few weeks would bring. If he was totally honest, his deepest wish was to finally leave the name David McKinnon behind him and be recognized for his work, as himself. The very slight chance of it actually happening someday was enough to make this all worthwhile, and for the first time, he was beginning to feel a little excited about this assignment.
Draco believed him. Throughout this first leg of their interview, Potter exuded a pervasive humility, sometimes to the point of being self-deprecating, and it was abundantly clear that he was uncomfortable talking about himself. Truth be told, Draco hadn’t expected that; it had always been his belief that Potter was conceited and thrived on being the center of attention. Honestly, had he been wrong about everything?
Harry squirmed a little in his chair; their agreement might have something to do with the fact that Harry hadn’t mentioned that it was Draco who would be conducting the interview. He still hadn’t quite figured out how to tell them. Anyway, they would be fine with it. Right?
Draco grinned and then laughed. “First you wanted Harry, now you want dearest. Such a fickle, demanding man you are, Potter.”
She was already glaring at him. “Merlin, Malfoy, that makes you sound more than a little guilty. Is there something you’re not telling me?”
“Have I?” Draco asked. “How disappointing to discover that I’m so much less enigmatic than I always endeavor to be.”
Draco kept looking at Harry, trying desperately to read his unmoving face, but he could not. He gently took Harry’s hands in his own.
“No,” Draco said. “It’s like I told you yesterday, I don’t want to spend any time with you around anyone else, even young Edward, until I’ve told my mother about us. Things have a way of getting back to her.”
“You can call me Harry too,” Harry said, and for some reason he felt like he might as well have just asked Malfoy to take his clothes off.
Draco huffed, his stomach lurching at the tone of Harry’s voice. “Copious amounts of alcohol will do that to a person.”
“Much less than that, if we’re talking about romantic feelings alone,” Draco reasoned. “Don’t forget that either.”
“Thanks, Webster,” Harry replied, grinning as he took a sip of his butterbeer, subtly bumping his knee against Draco’s under the table in a gesture of solidarity. Draco felt warm all over.
“Here’s another tip, sweetheart,” Draco told him, resting his head casually against the headboard. “Don’t call me sir unless you’re ready for a thoroughly vicious arse-fucking immediately thereafter.”
Draco felt warm deep in his belly, safe, secure, at ease. It was a new feeling, one that he happily put on like a worn-in old jumper and snuggled into. And it was because of Harry. Harry made him feel like he was not broken, not beyond hope, not worthless. Harry made him feel like he was treasured and beloved.
“Only after Ron and I finally got together,” she admitted. “It was easy to picture him as a father, and eventually it became just as easy to see myself as a mother.”
“So you came to my place of work to apologize for wasting my time last night,” Draco surmised, “thus wasting even more of my time.”
Draco finally smiled back at him, a real one, and Harry had to physically back away to keep from touching him.
He looked over at Hermione to make sure this was alright with her; she was seated comfortably on the chair beside him, a flannel blanket already spread over her lap, smiling at them both.
“Alright,” Draco said, accepting the unspoken challenge. “How’s this: you’re a true original, you’re remarkable beyond measure, and you have the smile of a young Gilderoy Lockhart.”
Well, they could question it all they wanted. Everyone could. Harry was his, he was Harry’s, and that was the fact of the matter.
“Except you, obviously,” Harry said. Not that he had a clue what ‘guile’ was, but there was no way he was about to ask dictionary brain to explain it to him.
Draco shrugged. “I assumed everyone knew, and I didn’t bother hiding it. Eventually it just became common knowledge, among anyone who actually cared enough to wonder.”
“Yes, go ahead and feel free to use my wand, sweetheart,” Harry teased, smiling broadly as the bottles flew into the sitting room and into Draco’s hands.
Harry tugged on his hair a little before planting a kiss on the top of his head. “Angel,” he whispered.
“Well, since you asked,” Draco muttered, ignoring the snitches once again. “I am highly intelligent. Well dressed. Impeccable manners…”
“Sure thing, dear,” he muttered quickly, gathering the brooms in his arms and traipsing into the house beside her.
Draco heard his mother stand up, and he watched as she wordlessly moved around from the opposite side of the table to sit next to him. She took his hand in hers once more.
His words, along with the vision of Harry’s pleasure, pushed Draco over the edge first, and he felt himself come with a scream, throwing his head back in pure ecstasy.
Draco sighed in resignation to Potter’s persistence. “The fact that I, a gay man, willingly remained married to a woman for four years without straying should answer the question for you.”
Draco had given him a bacon and tomato sandwich, a shiny red apple, two napkins, and an intricately folded note. Harry opened the note like it was sacred (which, to him, it was) and read:
Harry couldn’t control himself any longer; he stood up and began pacing the tiny room, on edge. He could feel Draco’s eyes following his every step now. How could Draco be so okay with this? How could he always be so resigned to the abuse?
“And Harry tells me you and Weasley are alright with my use of a self-writing quill, if I’m not mistaken?” Draco asked.
“Don’t say a word, Potter, I’m in a particularly foul mood,” he muttered before taking a haughty sip of tea.
“I’m furious with you, Harry, and I’m going to throw this pillow directly at your head, and you’re going to fucking stand there and take it, and that’s the way it’s going to be!”
But Rose was perched in Ron’s arms, facing Harry and Draco, looking very sweet in her white cotton pyjamas, and Harry’s ire waned
“Then yes, in that case, I’d love a tea,” Draco said, removing his jacket. “I’ve been dreaming about your tea all week, actually, though I suppose I’ll have to wait until we’re back at yours for the good stuff.”
“It means nothing, Potter, I’m just fucking furious with you, and I obviously don’t want you to leave my house, dammit… but I don’t know why you couldn’t just tell your two best friends in the world that you fucking love me.”
“Honestly, you’re probably going to have a much harder time of things when you tell your family,” Draco continued. “Malfoys don’t really relish talking about our feelings, as you know, so even after a bombshell such as this, there was minimal discussion. But you know your Weasleys are going to want to dissect every single aspect of our relationship in great detail.”
Once again, Harry had spent far too long searching through his sad wardrobe for something impressive to wear, and once again, he’d miserably shimmied into his tired old jeans and a white t-shirt. Honestly, as much as he hated shopping, he thought it might be necessary at this point. He wondered offhandedly where Draco got all his fancy clothes. He probably had an extremely overpaid personal tailor and everything. (Worth it. Obviously.)
Their eyes met once more, and not for the first time that evening, Harry’s pulse quickened. He had a fleeting thought that it was a good thing he was in decent physical shape: Draco gave his heart a damn workout. He hated that Malfoy had this effect on him. He hated it almost as much as he loved it.
His mother, on the other hand, was all poise, and she hugged him like she was a mystery unwilling to be solved. Draco loved both of their hugs equally, but Harry’s was the one that felt like home to him now.
“How about this, then,” Harry said, leaning towards him. “Turns out Malfoy’s not actually bad at all; he’s really almost halfway good?”
“What more is there to explain?” Draco replied with a shrug. “We married when I was twenty-one, she was twenty. Neither of us were in love, of course, but that hardly mattered. We were to produce an heir, carry on the bloodline, and continue being miserable in our perfect pureblood union until one or both of us died. It’s the way things are done.”
“How are you feeling?” Harry asked him after a few moments of quiet smiles. “Is your head okay? Are you in any pain?”
, I can’t help but hate myself!” Draco retorted petulantly, knowing it was a step too far even as it came out of his mouth.
“Harry,” he began, realizing only after the fact that he had said it. The name alone seemed to be the right thing to say, though, because Harry turned and smiled at him. It was a different smile, a soft smile that melted away any words Draco may have had.
Narcissa’s collected composure slipped only slightly as she stared at her son. Draco saw a flicker of understanding in her eyes.
“That’s about what he said, but I was hoping you would give me a more detailed answer,” Harry said with a grin. “I’m dying here.”
Draco nodded. He hadn’t been especially concerned about that, but he knew it would comfort Harry to know that he had added protection.
“Hey, Draco,” came Harry’s sleepy voice, and Draco stopped dead in the doorway. He turned his head to the side, but he couldn’t bring himself to look back at Harry. He was terrified that the pull of him would be too strong to resist.
“Don’t look at me like that, Potter,” Draco said almost sadly. “I made some unforgivable decisions and I am now reaping the consequences of them, acquittal or not. I can accept that.”
“So well,” he corrected, inching forward like a moth to a flame and perching himself on the edge of Harry’s bed. “Your feet had better smell like roses, Potter.”
There was nothing else he wanted to say just then, and as he looked down at Harry’s head between his legs, slowly lapping up the last of Draco’s cum, Draco fell in love with him all over again.
“Draco, it’s fine, okay?” Harry said with a sigh. “I’m honestly okay. Nothing is wrong. And I’m not drunk. I promise. Maybe just a bit tipsy… or maybe really tipsy. But I’m still…”
