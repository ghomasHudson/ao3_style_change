Malfoy almost fell into the room, when Harry opened the door; his skin was a worrying shade of green, he appeared to be having trouble walking, and Harry had to half-drag, half-carry him to a large armchair.
It was a fifth-year class, the first one. Harry seemed to remember that fifteen year olds were a particularly cranky bunch.
— the Gryffindor dormitory. A dry bar, and a small tea service. Harry took another step inside, but he didn’t let go of Narcissa’s hand.
Draco hadn’t actually intended for that to be Harry’s cue to pull him in close and kiss him like that, hard and biting and insistent, getting annoyed when he couldn’t find somewhere for his fingers to get at Draco’s skin. Very satisfactory, Draco thought, as he pressed closer.
Anticipation came. He acknowledged it; it was a feeling he didn’t often encounter, and he appreciated its child-like excitement. He sent it away.
“Hermione Granger had inflicted a stinging hex which made my face swell up, so my identity might be hidden,” he was saying, very calmly, his voice more adult than any Draco had ever managed to achieve. “Mr Malfoy was brought to identify me. He did; we’d known each other for several years, and he knew it was me. He lied to Bellatrix Lestrange and said he didn’t know if it was me or not. He risked his own life, and those of his parents, to save my life.”
Draco let his nose graze against Harry’s nose, and stole another kiss, this time letting his tongue press curiously against Harry’s lower lip. Harry opened his mouth, after a moment, and Draco felt Harry’s hand slip carefully to his hip. Did he even know? That he was pulling Draco closer, even as he trembled, and seemed to want to pull away? Was he aware of the soft dance of their tongues, the hungry way he was coaxing Draco nearer?
“There hasn’t been a Duelling Club at Hogwarts in some time. And I know why, I do.” He scratched at his hand, a nervous habit he had. “Everyone wants us to feel safe, and that’s… lovely, I suppose, but — it still seems like a good idea, to me. There might not be Death Eaters anymore, but that doesn’t mean we might not have to defend —”
Draco felt that now-familiar wave of anger threaten to peak again. He ignored it. He had a job to do, and if he had more than one set of interests to deal with then he would deal with them. “You want him back. In the professional sense.”
”, and held her lit wand over the box. “Not as often as it used to. There are some people who will never forgive, and never try to understand. You’ve seen this particular curse before, Harry, I take it?”
He could have tossed Harry down on the bed, in that moment, and demanded anything, anything at all, and Harry would have given it to him. He could feel it. But he didn’t want just anything. Harry might have been considerably more discreet than Draco, but that didn’t mean he wasn’t known for having spent a good number of messy weekends with random men all over London.
“I’m a speccy Gryffindork, remember? I don’t have one.” It was getting cold. The sun had gone down, and Harry had barely noticed. “I might make some tea, if you’d like one.”
at that hair. And he was such a Gryffindor. And he didn’t know how to have fun, and who could stand that for longer than a long weekend with Blaise?
Harry seemed to take a long time considering it. “No. I trust you. About this, at least.” But he didn’t pull his hand away, and somehow that simple point of contact became the centre of the universe, for a little while. It seemed like an excellent moment for a very distasteful joke, or to tell Harry he was an idiot for trusting a Slytherin. But instead, Draco nodded serenely, unwilling to break the spell.
Hermione drained her glass, which entirely shattered the impression she was trying to project — that of being utterly calm and collected and of course, right.
He made his way downstairs, to find Harry frozen in front of a smoking frying pan. Draco flicked his wand at the flame beneath it, reducing it to a slower cook. Harry looked at it, and blinked helplessly.
“It is completely unprofessional to fall in love with a patient,” Emrys said. He scratched his nails over his short hair. “But you know that.”
The wand hummed faintly. Harry gave it an experimental little wave, and weak yellow and orange sparks tumbled from the end. He laughed. Not something the DMLE would appreciate, but it felt so good to have figured something out by himself that Harry kept making sparks for a good ten minutes.
“Did you tell a policeman?” Ron asked, his eyebrows high on his forehead. “I don’t expect they’re as clever as Aurors, but I still think it’s best to tell them. D’you think he’d go to jail?”
He nodded jerkily. “I’m not discussing it in here. Some patients wake up and repeat entire conversations that they heard while seemingly unconscious. When you’ve finished sitting with Harry, come and find me. I’ll have an elf deliver you tea.”
Harry chuckled. “You might be on to something, there. But this boy — I don’t really know how to say it, but… well, things got complicated, you know? I think by the time I started thinking we should have been friends, so much had happened that I didn’t know what I could do to change any of it. We were… rivals. Enemies, in a way. Though I don’t think either of us knew what that meant, really. We just… fought. I suppose in retrospect the mutual stalking and appalling behaviour should have told me something important but I missed it at the time. For a long time, actually.”
“Harry Potter,” Malfoy said, leaning forward in the chair. “This room is an abomination. And it’s so
The days grew shorter, and the nights longer, but twice a week without fail Harry had dinner with Ron and Hermione; sometimes at the Leaky Cauldron, sometimes at their house in Ottery St Catchpole. Sometimes they went to Grimmauld Place to watch Teddy grow up, but Harry always spent time there without them, as well. Sometimes they ate in the kitchen at the shop.
Mrs Malfoy raised her eyebrows expectantly and Harry remembered his manners, offering her his elbow. She nodded in silent praise as she slipped her hand around his bicep and let herself be led down the street. She nodded her hellos to many, stopped to greet a few. She smiled warmly at those who narrowed their eyes at her. Harry was impressed. She could have easily become a pariah. Or a hermit. Instead, she had already donated a significant amount of her wealth to very worthy causes and made everyone rethink her. He wondered if his own words at the trial had helped, and immediately felt like a wanker.
She sighed regretfully. “No International Floo Powder,” she said sadly. “It’s a new rule, needs to be approved in advance so that people don’t — well,
Alaric chuckled, his smile getting wider, and turned slowly and deliberately to look at where Draco’s attention had been. “Enjoy your morning?”
“I should get some sleep,” Harry said, placing the frame back on the desk and avoiding Draco’s eyes. Draco glanced at the clock. It was barely eight o’clock. He didn’t want to go. He wanted to hear things. In the most terrible way. He wanted to hear stories. About Sirius Black, his rebellious uncle. About the year Harry and Granger and the Weasel were off searching for Horcruxes. About his mother, whispering to Harry in the forest, wanting — needing — to know that Draco was still alive. He wanted to tell Harry what it had felt like when he realised that Harry was going to save him from the Fiendfyre. He wanted to hear about Harry’s godawful Muggle family, and feel angry about their abuse, and tell him so.
“No. Rubino has been very offended that you continually refuse his hospitality, and I won’t have him taking his bad mood out on anyone else.” Draco nodded once more and closed the door behind him.
“You asked the question all wrong, of course. You do that. Tell me, Harry, why would I not approve of someone you were in love with?”
The wand flew gracefully across the room from where it had been tucked away on the bookcase and Draco directed it to Harry’s hand.
She made it sound as if it was nothing; something rich old ladies did with their time and nothing more. But she avoided Draco’s eyes when she said it. Something else for them to discuss when it was just the two of them.
Harry shrugged. “More or less. I was allowed clothes, of course. Whatever my cousin Dudley had grown out of, as long as it wasn’t nice enough for a consignment store.” Draco was staring at him, now. Harry still didn’t turn his head, but he could feel the gaze, and he didn’t mind it.
Draco had taken Harry’s hand, and placed it on his shoulder. He had placed his own hand on Harry’s hip, before their free hands found each other. “You haven’t danced since the fucking
Hermione was sitting at a desk in the corner, apparently responding to a few last-minute owls. She shot Draco a grateful smile and continued her scribbling, and a few minutes later, Blaise responded to a knock on the door and went to accept a couple of pizzas.
Hermione and Blaise turned to look at Draco, emerging from the kitchen. He looked tired, Hermione thought. In fact, they both looked a little unhappy, and Hermione fought to keep the smile on her face.
“Harry,” Neville called, and Harry clenched his teeth, and turned back. Neville looked like he was about to ask question, and then he changed his mind. “I’m sending both of our RSVPs back.”
“I’m Professor Potter. I have the lesson plans from your old professor,” he said. “This year, we’re going to be focusing on the defence spells and counter-curses you’ll need to get through your O.W.L.s. I don’t much like teaching from a book, or learning from one, so it will be a very practical course, though we’ll be using the textbook you all seem to have — does anyone not have one?”
George’s note came from Angelina. It was a reminder that Draco had been the one to toss Harry the wand that had ultimately led to Voldemort’s destruction, and that George would be alright.
Harry did — he couldn’t resist showing anyone around, if they showed the slightest bit of interest. With a grin on his face, he led Blaise up the stairs. “These old places make me laugh, you know. There’s the sitting room downstairs, and a sitting room up here —”
“You had a partner?” Draco didn’t know why he was surprised. He supposed that without Granger or the Weasel there, Harry would have insisted on being a lone wolf. Also, he was jealous, but he didn’t have to admit it out loud, and if he didn’t admit it out loud then it wasn’t ever going to be true.
“Your little friend asked me how you were,” Harry interrupted, placing the plate on the end table beside Draco. If he’d noticed that Draco’s wards had been shifted to allow him access, he didn’t mention it. He placed a glass of ginger ale alongside the plate, and sat on the armchair nearest. “I told her you were quite well. She thinks she’s in trouble.”
Draco looked perplexed by this, but dismissed his reaction after only a moment. “What happened to the Manor?” he asked, after a long time spent silently eating. He was, indeed, starving, Harry could see, but seemed to be having trouble, eating only tiny mouthfuls and resting in between. He looked gaunt. Perhaps he’d been hungry for a long time. All he’d eaten from breakfast was the bacon.
“I miss the way we were, Harry. I don’t know if I can do it anymore, but I’d like to try, if we can.”
And why his head kept mixing up ideas and images like Draco, and fun, and sex, and loneliness, he really didn’t know. Nor why his comments stung so hard. It was an attraction, and he’d had dozens of those. Easy enough to set aside when there was so much to do.
“What’s that?” Hermione asked him, brushing her fingertips over the petals of a flower she couldn’t hope to identify. Neville needed to know about this place. She sat back on her ankles, feeling younger and stronger than she had in… well.
Something dangerous and cold gripped at Harry’s intestines, and as the song finished, the guitar player turned towards him, putting one guitar down and reaching for another.
“I went to try to correct my parents’ memories. But it didn’t work. We came back. Ron and I did our seventh year when the school re-opened, but Harry had received dispensation to begin Auror training.”
It was much more difficult than a broom, which was a surprise. A broom wasn’t constrained in space in the same way, allowing one to rebalance in three dimensions instead of just… falling sideways. But Harry set subtle cushioning charms on both sides of the bicycle in case he came close to falling (… after the first few times, anyway), and by the end of the hour, he seemed to have the hang of it. Which was why he then stopped to buy one in a store before he headed back to Grimmauld Place.
“Don’t worry. I happen to know an exceptional Potions Master. Have I need for anything, I ask him.” Harry took a glass.
He felt an answering smile against his throat. “You’re an appalling sap. You sound like a second-year Hufflepuff. No arguing, then.”
“You have to ask them if I can come,” he said a few minutes later. “I’m not springing it on them. But don’t be surprised if they say no. I won’t be hurt.”
Andromeda froze, looking over Draco from head to toe. She glanced quickly at Harry, and Harry realised he had some explaining he would need to do. “Nephew,” she said. “I haven’t seen you since…”
“As it happens, I am an excellent cook,” Draco said. He pulled Harry across the kitchen to the cellar door, and settled in behind him, hands on his hips, breath in his ear. “Open the door, Harry. Let me cook you something good. Let me spoil you.” His voice got lower, seductive. “You can eat dessert off my stomach.”
“I usually leave here about noon,” Harry replied, already missing the weight of Draco’s head in his lap.
“You know what I hate about you?” he said to Emrys, as they sat at a beautiful and very tiny table overlooking the cliffs where Draco’s home lay.
“Well,” she said. “It is a busy time of year for shoppers. Perhaps you’d like to accompany me? I may be of some assistance. Mr Black.”
“Blimey,” Blaise said. “Alright. That might not be my cup of tea.” He poured himself a glass of wine instead. “You forget, those of us in Slytherin did know you better than most. We saw you at your best as well as your worst. You were funny, and clever, and you kept an eye on the little ones, even when you called them names. You cared about people. You had a funny way of showing it, but you did.”
She looked so knowing that Harry couldn’t hold her gaze. He bid farewell and locked the door with a gesture, flipping the open sign to closed, and forced himself to take the stairs one at a time.
He smoothed Potter’s hair off his forehead, taking a moment to glance at the old lightning-shaped scar. He let his fingers linger over Potter’s smooth cheek. He did look good. That didn’t make any of this more tragic, but Draco had eyes, he couldn’t pretend he couldn’t see it.
Harry slipped away past his new friends thanks to a quick and quiet Notice-Me-Not and he headed out onto the pavement. It was dark, and cooler, now. It didn’t take too long for him to figure out where the band moved their gear in and out. He stood unnoticed by the back door for a while, listening for any sign that his heartbeat might be starting to slow; but it wasn’t.
“My dear boy, unless you know how to turn the clock back, and make me young again, there’s nothing anyone can do. My wife is gone, my children and grandchildren have grown, and my great-grandchildren are getting there. I have far more happy memories than I do regrets — that’s quite enough to be getting on with. And what brings you to my shop?”
“But something to do with my days. Something constructive. It’s too easy to get caught up in my head; d’you know what I mean? She told me to find a new challenge, something to do with my hands and my magic. Something I’d be proud of in the end. I don’t know what, though.”
Watching Harry trying to relax enough to sit down was rather like watching someone break all their limbs in order to fit inside a teacup, but Harry managed in the end, and accepted the glass of wine without a great deal of protest. He still looked rather like he had itching powder in his knickers, but one thing at a time.
is old,” Harry was explaining. “She’s a Muggle castle, but very fit for purpose and the charms are coming along well; much bigger on the inside than on the outside, now, and we’ve disillusioned her. And do you know, I think she’s starting to wake up. I didn’t think it could happen that quickly. Another year of work and we’ll be able to start taking students. Just the senior years, at first.”
One of Harry’s t-shirts caught his eye. It had somehow made its way into Draco’s side of the wardrobe, and it fit like… a clue, really.
“Alright. So, Blaise Zabini, since I don’t think you’re here to ask me to be your Best Man, or join the Department of Mysteries — what
to perfect. Not tentative, not at all, it was a hungry, desperate kiss, perhaps a decade in the making. Draco pressed the length of his body against Harry’s, and reached up to free Harry’s hair from the loose bun, tangling his fingers in the length of it, pulling just enough to bare Harry’s throat and press hot lips to the shivering skin.
“Doesn’t have to be like that, mate,” Ron promised, his dark eyes wide. “It’s strategy, you see. Planning. Knowing your opponent, like in chess. And then you don’t have to take those risks.”
Harry felt painfully out of place, hearing such intimate thoughts, but he thought if he stayed respectfully silent, then that would be alright. Except the silence went on too long.
Draco sneered, but didn’t speak, and after a moment or two longer he repositioned himself over Harry’s cock, and slowly eased him in.
“She doesn’t need anything. She has everything she could ever want.” It was a test; would Harry back down and show up empty-handed? If he did, Narcissa might stop meddling and declare him a lost cause. “I cannot believe you accepted that invitation, Potter.”
“It was stupid.” Julian shook his head, and stared at the window — at, not out, because every man and his Crup knew they were underground and the windows were enchanted to look like real weather. “He just can’t mind his own, you know? I had everything under control, and he steps out in front of me and throws up a Shield Charm, like I couldn’t’ve done it myself. Tosses a few body-binds about the place like there were cameras on him.”
It wasn’t really a question. Draco Malfoy was most definitely in his kitchen. His hair had grown a little longer, cropped close on one side. He looked slightly healthier than he had the previous winter, though that wasn’t a very high bar. He startled, as if it was Harry who wasn’t supposed to be there. Wearing Ron’s old jeans, and a t-shirt that threatened to fall from his shoulders.
powerful. He could resist Veritaserum and the Imperius Curse. He was generally too polite to push hard against someone’s wards, of course. But right then? Exactly where he wanted to be, with the person he wanted to be with, his skin practically magnetised to Draco’s, and knowing that one way or another, he was going to ruin this?
Potter had changed. Twelve years older, certainly. But apparently the speccie git had never considered so much as changing his haircut. His eyeglasses were the same shape, his fringe still fell across the scar on his forehead — Draco was willing to bet his shoes weren’t polished and his wand was grubby. Perhaps that wasn’t fair. Aurors probably weren’t allowed grubby wands.
She nodded, held Harry’s eyes for a moment and then shook her head. “Fine. Do try not to sleep in too much, will you?”
“It’s not clothes, that Mistress is hiding in here?” he asked, suspiciously. Hermione opened the envelope instead and passed him the letter.
“You loved flying,” Hermione said, and Hugo fussed, and she went to pick him up out of his crib. It was comical, with her baby bump taking up the space that Hugo wanted to occupy, and Ron soon took over. Harry felt something huge and terrible lurch in his chest. “Quidditch. I’m coaching Quidditch. I fly.”
Harry’s gaze flicked across the room to where Draco lay, and for a moment the look of hunger in his eyes was so raw that Draco thought he might have come down with some fantastically debauched intent, and then he settled the Auror mask back down over his features.
“I see,” Harry said, trying to sound disappointed when all he could really think about was how nice a day it was outside and how being sent home wouldn’t really be so terrible. “Alright, no problem at all. I’ll try to get an appointment at Ollivander’s —”
Draco moved closer. Closer than an enemy, closer than a friend. Close enough so that Harry was suddenly forcibly reminded of those few inches Draco had over him. Harry let himself be crowded against the kitchen counter, watching Draco’s eyes, even while Draco deliberately avoided his gaze. When Draco reached a tentative hand out as if waiting to be stopped — Harry took that hand and brought it to his lips. He kissed Draco’s knuckles, and then his palm, and then the inside of his wrist. He curved his other arm around Draco’s waist. He seemed so fragile, but Harry knew he wasn’t. No one survived as much as they had and remained fragile in the end.
“Malfoy,” Potter said, following close behind as if he thought he might be able to snatch the tray away. They were inside Draco’s sitting room before Potter realised that he had even crossed the threshold. “Please don’t take
to do, ways to keep busy, work that would put them to sleep at the end of the day. Harry was regularly trotted out by the Ministry to talk to the public, asking them to dig deep; this was a world full of destroyed buildings and new orphans who needed help. Fundraising was easier than expected. Anyone who had ever expressed a shadow of agreement with Tom Riddle’s absurd fantasies about blood purity was particularly keen to be seen donating large amounts.
When they arrived at the apparition point outside the hospital Parvati was, of course, immediately on the lookout for anything untoward; Hermione commented sourly that there was every chance someone might leap from the shadows to offer them all wine and olives, but Blaise humphed irritably at her side and Parvati was too professional to rise to the bait.
“Liked yours well enough. Me, I’m all about brains, though. She’s the smartest woman I’ve ever known. Should’ve been in Ravenclaw. Should’ve been in
On Monday morning, he had to explain to Auror Bones (apparently a distant cousin of Susan’s, and with none of her gentleness) that he did not yet have a wand.
Harry shook himself and stood straighter, dislodging Draco’s arm. Draco fought the urge to fight back, wrap his arms around Harry’s body and pull him in, apologise, for everything Draco had ever done, and for everything that every Death Eater had done, willingly or not. But he kept his Pureblood, well-raised, Slytherin hands to himself and stood straight.
By unspoken agreement, the three of them shared Harry’s bed that night, Hermione in the middle, Ron’s chest pressed to her back, her head on Harry’s shoulder. But it took Harry a long time to get to sleep.
“Usually seven hours a night, and it’s good sleep. I’m not perched on a knife edge waiting for a disaster. I’m not waking up with my hand already almost on my wand. I wake up, I stretch, I yawn…”
“Alright,” Draco said, drawing him back with soft touches, smoothing his hair. “It’s alright, Harry. But I want you to show me something.”
“Malfoy,” he said, with relief in his tone, and then seeing Draco’s face fall, he amended it. “Draco. I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have come. I didn’t recognise the signs. This is a
“I take back what I said about you having the upper body strength of a Cornish pixie,” he murmured against the swell of Draco’s bicep. He was all lean muscle, not like Harry’s own bulk, but confidently strong, and elegant.
“Lissie is a free elf,” she said proudly. “Master Malfoy is making Lissie’s dress. Is Master Harry wanting a butterbeer, or a firewhiskey? Or some wine? Or mead? Or —”
Draco gave Harry a hard look. The little girl, Draco believed, had been abused terribly. Which was something Harry might have some insight into, but she was still a patient, and she still deserved her privacy.
It was easier to give in to tears from time to time knowing that every single other person did the same thing, and just as often. Harry didn’t think he would ever quite believe the day that he’d find Hermione and Millicent Bulstrode comforting each other in front of the fireplace, and sharing painful memories. And Blaise Zabini continued to be a git, but it turned out that he was a kind, funny git, quick to laugh or notice when someone needed something.
“I’m not,” Draco said, seriously again. “You’re the biggest idiot I’ve ever known, but you’re very brave. Which is the same thing, sometimes. You’re quick with defensive spells and you’re always trying to save everyone else, because you’re a sodding martyr, raised for self-sacrifice by Dumbledore himself.”
There was so much more that needed to be said, but Harry looked as if he might be balancing on the very edge of something, and Hermione could only nod.
“The Portrait of my great-grandmother Lyra Malfoy moves faster than that,” Draco shouted, across the water.
“I’m different,” he insisted. There had been such a long break in the conversation that Blaise seemed to take a moment to catch the train of thought. He shook his head, and lifted the limoncello to his lips.
Draco nodded brusquely. “I’m quite alright. You’ll remember that pale does tend to run in the family, Minister. May I assume you received my owl?”
“Not really. No, I mean it, Harry. He… assumed I knew things that you… why didn’t you ever tell us?”
Draco nodded. “We talked for a while, afterward. Or I did. But he listened, I think. And eventually, he relaxed enough to let me hold him for a while.”
He was relieved to find Draco quiet and reserved. It meant that for a little while at least he could pretend he didn’t remember anything of the last few months; and he didn’t know the date but the flowers outside the window told him in no uncertain terms that it had, indeed, been months.
.” Draco indicated the small meeting table, and Hermione stepped out from behind her desk, stepping carefully past piles of books to sit in the chair that Draco had pulled out for her.
“Certainly, Professor Malfoy.” Harry chewed on his lip. “We must be mental. Can you really picture me at a pub with Pansy and Greg?”
, what in Merlin’s name was she doing there — his hand to shake. She shook it, rather more warmly than he had thought she might.
Madam Shacklebolt took another biscuit. “You must send Molly my regards, and my compliments,” she said. “And tell me, how do you intend to celebrate your birthday?”
He sat on the edge of the bed, and rubbed the potion into Harry’s arms. And then his hands. Especially his hands. Rough and calloused and scarred and so fucking capable. The fingernails broad and certain.
“Very impressive,” Mrs Malfoy said, and sipped her tea. “I use strong wards, and many of them are ancient, tied to the family lines. There are still people who would use any weakness in them to enter the grounds and do me harm. Or hurt my home. She’s still recovering from the occupation, of course.”
“We can talk about it,” Draco said, his voice velvety and soothing. There were magic words. He’d stumbled on them before. “Harry. Darling. You can talk to me about things.”
Mrs Malfoy was too well-bred to comment on the bald-faced lie, and Harry found himself curling his shoulders inward. Once again trying to take up less space.
“I don’t want to interrogate you,” Draco said delicately, sitting across the small table with his own mug of tea.
Almost like old times, except he wasn’t stumbling into anyone’s bed. For a moment, before he fell asleep, he let himself imagine Harry laughing at his side.
After a long silence where Harry fancied some of the tension had drained from Draco’s body, he spoke again. “I’m a fuck-up.”
“I made such a mess of being a Wizard,” he murmured into Harry’s chest. “Everyone hates me, and they’re right to. But I couldn’t make it out there, either. And I didn’t want to ruin your life. You’ve been through enough. You’ve done enough.” But he didn’t pull away. Harry slipped his arms around Draco’s shoulders and let him keen quietly against his bare chest. “I didn’t mean to take your magic.”
, purposeful and productive, might be something he’d need to work on with his Mind Healer, now that he had stopped answering “I’m fine, really good” to every question she asked him.
“I’m not surprised at all. You haven’t done any magic in several months, and you need to start again soon, or it will get harder and harder to start again. You can start small.
have a million galleons, thanks to a series of stepfathers with deep pockets — but I was never stupid enough to bet against Pans.”
She was dressed, as always, in traditional African garb, gold and red robes which made the blackness of her skin look even richer. Harry hurried to the other side of his desk to pull a chair out for her.
Harry was disappointed; he’d thought perhaps after a day like this one had been Draco might be ready to talk at last. Draco seemed to have a finite capacity for being around other people, though, and being surrounded by that much magic might have worn him out as well.
“I don’t know if you can hear me. I don’t even know if you want to hear me. But if you can — I need you to focus. This is going to be fucking horrible, but we need to do it. I forgive you, you know. I do. I only hope I’ll know what to do, when… I hope I’ll know what to say. Fuck, I don’t even know if I can find you.
“Perhaps for the same reason you showed up on my doorstep in the rain,” Harry murmured, and the subject was dropped.
“Of course, Mr Potter,” she answered. She was focused; he appreciated that. “I reserve the right to decide whether or not to agree to this favour, but please go ahead.”
“You certainly have, dear boy.” He might have bristled at the endearment from almost anyone else but Madam Shacklebolt used it on everyone south of sixty.
The Hogwarts elves kept everyone fed and worked hard themselves — too hard, by Hermione’s reckoning — and every single day felt full of joyful purpose.
“Fuck off, Harold.” Ron came in, grinning, and looked around where Harry was standing at the kitchen counter. “Well? Where’s the new wand, then?”
Harry bristled, and Draco remembered suddenly that for years and years Harry had been hungry. Truly hungry, the kind of hungry you have to learn to ignore. The kind of hungry where you end up shorter than your parents, despite being so full of power that it rippled off you in waves, the way Draco could feel right now.
“Mostly?” Draco raised his eyebrows. “I can assure you he’s no longer my patient, but he’s also no longer within reaching distance, so—”
Draco moved lower, biting gently at Harry’s clavicle, and soothing it with his tongue; landing teasing kisses on his hard nipples until Harry started making some sort of demanding noise, low in his throat.
She nodded. “I think so. Or he will be. Good gracious, Harry, he would have died. I’ve never seen this before, never seen such a malicious…” He turned away and left her to her fussing.
“It’s… lovely,” Harry said. Fuck, one of these days he was going to need to make a proper home for himself. It was far too late for him to do anything about Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place. He’d neglected her for so long she would probably resist any effort he made to nurse her back to health. But perhaps he could gift her to someone anonymously. Buy a flat, or something. Let Luna Lovegood help him to decorate it, that would make her happy.
“No one escapes anything, Harry,” Hermione said. “Least of all war. But that doesn’t mean that things are terrible. We learned, we grew, and we survived. Maybe we won’t ever be the sort of people who trip light-heartedly through life, but maybe — maybe
When they were aching and exhausted and energised, Hermione stretched and slung her arm across Blaise’s stomach.
Harry ended the kiss, but he didn’t pull away very far. “I don’t know why you would, Draco. I just hope you do.”
“In a few days I’ll show him I’m doing alright, and once my magic is being a bit less… whoops,” he said, leaping to his feet to catch the teapot as it flew at him from the kitchen. “Er. Unpredictable — I’ll make a Portkey.”
That night, after checking that all of his things were in their rightful places in his living quarters behind the Potions classroom, Draco sat down to write a letter.
Draco rolled over, and pressed against Harry’s body, in a gesture that suggested he wasn’t prepared to have that conversation yet. He bit Harry’s bottom lip, and sucked it into his mouth. Harry shivered, and rubbed his hand over Draco’s bristly head.
Harry laughed painfully. “No. I’m afraid that didn’t really work out. I thought he wanted to come back to our world — but I was mistaken.”
They were quiet for a while and Harry decided to give his pie another go. He had barely shovelled a forkful into his mouth when Hermione let out a defeated sigh and dropped her shoulders.
“No problem,” Harry said, shaking hands with the two new elves in turn. “I’d be very happy to pay you all.” He didn’t argue, though, when Kreacher and Hennie pulled away with appalled expressions. “Did you three do all of this?”
“Oh, go ahead and tell me we can’t do this until the third full moon of the year, or something, go on. You started this.”
Draco blinked at him repeatedly. “I agree,” he said. Not condoning, but he hoped his expression was supportive.
He was debating what else might amuse him for another hour or two when he heard a hesitant knock on the door of his classroom, past his rooms.
Harry used to be such a scrawny boy, and as a teenager, wasn’t much less scrawny, really, but now he is all thick, ropy muscle. Draco’s hands were steady and practiced but only perhaps nine-tenths clinical, as his hands moved over Harry’s skin. “Physical contact is important,” Draco said. “Especially magical physical contact. He’s getting a little dehydrated, at times. Mostly I focus on the problem at hand and two other Healers take care of the rest of his physical needs, but…”
“No,” Harry said, alarmed. Draco was already halfway up the stairs. “Draco. No! Malfoy, no, don’t,” and he was running up the stairs behind Draco but it was like one of those terrible dreams where you can’t move fast enough, and Draco was already up on the landing. “Draco!”
“I’ve been trying all sorts of things,” he admitted. “But I haven’t seen — are they special, to your family?”
“Wow,” Ron deadpanned. “I didn’t know that at all. You’ve never mentioned it eight hundred times. In fact I don’t think Ollivander has ever said anything that you didn’t repeat back to us later.”
Determined not to let anyone see him looking quite this frazzled (or turned on) Draco took a long shower, wanked himself to a spectacular conclusion and then spent a good long time doing yoga in his bedroom. He cleared his mind with practised ease, focusing on only the shape of his body, the length of his muscles, the delicious stretch as he moved from position to position.
“Hullo,” he said, with a friendly smile. There were waves, some laughter, and a few soft charms of celebration, sparks and glitter in the air. “It’s so good to be back here with you. I’ve missed my home, and I’ve missed so many of you. I’m happy to be back.” There was a low rumble of laughter.
Around nine in the evening, they returned to Grimmauld place, with all but the ostensibly adult Weasleys (Molly and Arthur) and the next generation (just Victoire, for now), who was fast asleep by then anyway. Bill and Fleur were remarkably easygoing about leaving Victoire, which made sense, as she was such an easy baby, happy to be held by anyone. Percy’s wife was pregnant and they declined the invitation. Harry hated that he was relieved, but he still didn’t feel comfortable with Percy.
Joyful purpose began to look a lot like anaesthetising focus, and with the initial flurry of activity over, the anaesthesia wore off.
Perhaps Draco didn’t have Harry’s memories of… however long he’d been imagining this. Of daytime fantasies in the shower, or particularly enjoyable dreams (and what a mindfuck that was, the thought of Harry waking with his hand closed tight around that enormous prick of his and thinking about Draco, before he put on his ugly Auror’s uniform like a proper adult and heading to work), but he knew men. He knew men’s bodies, and desire, and he knew that Harry sodding Potter wanted to be held down and fucked until he was seeing stars.
“Alright.” Draco looked… disappointed, maybe, or perhaps he was just thinking. “I had an idea, actually.”
Also, he suddenly had no idea what he was supposed to say. This was not his world. He thought of Grimmauld Place. He realised he should have gone there, instead. Nursed his foolish wounds and reminded himself that he preferred to work than do things like courting, or getting maudlin with history professors, or… dancing with Malfoy in the moonlight.
Hermione nodded as she collected ingredients from the fridge. “Yes. You know, he’s much better as an analyst than in the field.” She sounded a little anxious. She had to know she’d been found out.
. Badly enough to have asked the person he hated most in the world for it. Harry pushed himself up onto his feet and crossed the room to the bed. Draco, mercifully, appeared to still be asleep. Deeply asleep. Harry ran his fingers over that silky, spiky head, but Draco’s eyes didn’t so much as flutter. He had to be completely fucking exhausted. Under the last of his makeup Harry could see dark shadows under his eyes. They looked like bruises.
“What, just because ex-Death Eaters hardly ever get secret love potions in the post? I’m perfectly happy with my cursed crystal balls and the occasional howler.”
“I don’t think so.” She took the glass and took a large sip. “You might have mentioned you were in love with him.”
Draco shook his head. “I can do it tomorrow. I need to check in about the overall potions stores anyway.”
Harry didn’t once think about explaining to Grayson that usually the overcoat was worn over other things and didn’t get close to the sensitive skin of one’s scrotum.
“No, I love it,” Harry said. Mad-Eye Mooney’s foe glass didn’t work well anymore, occluded with white fog. “It’s not — I just mean. Do you think we’re broken?”
“As far as we know, it’s the oldest Malfoy artefact in existence,” Draco said, as if it meant nothing. But his fingers twitched.
When Potter was gone, Draco sat watching the fire for a few minutes longer, letting himself think, and remember. And then he went to bed.
“We work so hard,” Draco said, and Harry felt uncomfortable. This was his first day off in so long. He didn’t want to think about work.
He sat bolt upright, all thoughts of arousal gone. Maybe for a moment he had imagined the war; but no, there was just that one sound, and then silence. He didn’t even know where it had come from.
Draco woke as the run was beginning to pink up the windows; woke up to hair that would have given a bird’s nest a bad name, the most impressive morning wood he could remember for a good long while and his fingers still tangled in Harry’s. He climbed off the bed and staggered to the sitting room, and then beyond, to the bathroom, where he stripped off his clothes into a messy pile he’d surely be annoyed about later.
“So what are you, Harry? In your heart of hearts. Were you not the Boy Who Lived. Had you not been the one to defeat Voldemort and end the war. Don’t answer too quickly. Just think, and tell me. Where does your heart lie? Where are you happy? Close your eyes.”
Draco rolled his eyes in the most dramatic fashion he could muster, given that he was feeling quite cheerful. “Grumbling slows healing, does it then?”
It took a couple of moments her Hermione to realise he wasn’t just tossing her an insult. Of course he wasn’t. He was a psychiatrist himself; he would hardly belittle his own occupation, not with his ego.
That didn’t make a lot of sense. But Harry nodded just the same. He didn’t dare look away from Ollivander’s face; maybe it would give him some clue as to what was happening, here.
“Perhaps we should leave off taking potshots at each other’s friends until we’ve figured out what exactly we’re doing, here, Professor Potter.” Draco raised an eyebrow and rested his hands on the balustrade. He missed the peacocks. The garden wasn’t the same without them.
He was shifting his weight from foot to foot right outside Flourish and Blotts, when Narcissa Malfoy approached him, cool and collected.
“Thank you,” he mumbled. Harry passed him a beer, and clinked the bottle against his own. There. That was a friendly gesture. Right?
“Not even in school?” Topher took a sip, and laughed. “Oh, you don’t have to tell me. It doesn’t make any difference to the treatment. I’m curious, that’s all. Not like I can share anything with the press, thanks to your ex-girlfriend’s magical blood quill.”
“You’re not,” she said quietly, moments later. “It’s reparations. But it’s not what the family was ordered to pay… it’s everything they have. The vaults, Malfoy Manor, a Villa in Tuscany… another in France. Everything. Except what he gave to Andromeda and Teddy.”
“Ah, but you can’t prove I did it.” Draco waggled his eyebrows. This was the friendliest they’d been in weeks, and Harry had to wonder if Narcissa had told him to behave.
He saw Draco in his mind’s eye; the short hair that still looked like it would be soft, the kohl-dark eyes, pale grey irises and the unfettered anger on his face. He hated how often he thought of it. Harry’s hair fell over his shoulder and he reached back absently to tie the lot of it into a loose bun at the top of his head.
And he wouldn’t. No, if Harry was looking to reject him a third time, he would retreat to lick his wounds for a year or two and then let Mother arrange him a match.
Harry shook his head, and took a centring breath. “No, please. I need you to be Healer Black, just for a little while.” His hand flexed, and Draco found himself hoping that Harry was struggling not to reach out just as surely as he was. “And then — later — I’ll want to see Draco. If he wants to see me.”
“It’s a big house. I think you might need help. Perhaps there are two elves who would like to come and live with you there? There’s a lot to be done, and perhaps it would be better if you — if you had a staff.”
Harry wrote a note to Molly, and another to Hermione and Ron, and finally to George. He told them all what he’d done so impulsively and told them that if they thought it was a mistake, they needed only to say the word and he would rescind the invitation.
“I have other patients to get to,” he said. “I’ll be back this evening. I have an idea. But if you could just wake up and be all indignant, I think it would be better for both of us. You think?”
“Oh, don’t be disingenuous, mother. Blaise’s mother makes up at least one third of the gossip in Witch Weekly, and if you think I don’t know you subscribe, you sorely underestimate me.” His mother had the sense not to argue. “And what’s wrong with Blaise? He’s attractive, well-bred —”
“Better underwater than on dry land,” Harry said, remembering the awful screeching in his golden egg when he was trying to figure out the third clue for the Tri-Wizard Tournament.
When the night fell, and the rain started up again, Harry sighed, and locked the door, drew the curtains against the shop windows. He crept up the stairs with a bundle of boxed wands under his arm, and paused on the landing. He knocked gently on the door.
He saw the moment of uncertainty on Draco’s face, and he recognised it for what it was; everything that Draco had, everything he’d achieved, he’d achieved by being someone else, Guaritore Christopher Black. If it took Harry the rest of their lives to convince him that Draco Malfoy deserved to be loved exactly as he was — well, then, Harry was up to that task.
“— Draco’s coming,” Neville said, hiding behind his pint. “And he’s very sorry for whatever happened. So be nice.”
“It was Draco. He’s playing guitar in a punk band. Or was, I suppose.” He reached for his coffee mug, but only turned it in his hand. “I was doing my best to talk an aspiring writer into bed, and suddenly there was Draco up on stage covered in tattoos and with his hair almost shaved off. Playing the guitar. I talked to him afterwards, or tried to… and he broke my nose. That was the last time I saw him, until he showed up asking for my help.”
Hermione did her best to keep the conversation light, but Kreacher went from wringing his hands to pacing on the tabletop to beating his fists against it in less than twenty minutes. “Master needs Kreacher,” he muttered, pulling at his ears. “Master needs his Kreacher, yes he does — Master’s
It didn’t feel like the sort of evening where the dining table was appropriate. Harry spread the food out on the coffee table in the upstairs sitting room with a couple of bowls, in front of the television (it had taken him almost a year to figure out how to shield it from all the magic in the house, but it worked fine now) and opened a couple of bottles of beer. He was about to knock on Draco’s door — the guest room door — when it opened, and Draco stepped out like a very tall ghost, drawn in by the smell, or perhaps by the sound of the television.
“The spikes were never as sharp as he wanted us to believe,” he said, and ignored Draco making a rude face at them both. “Wanker,” Harry said, and Luna and Draco swapped partners.
He opened his eyes again, and met Draco’s gaze. He looked… fucking exhausted, is what, drained and pale and uncomfortable, fingers hiding in the sleeves of what Draco suddenly recognised as an old hoodie that Harry had worn as a child, too big for him but comfortable, despite the chewed edges of the neckband. He looked like he was grieving. Perhaps he was.
“No, you git. My point is that we’re both fucked up. Beyond the telling of it. Vol— Tom Riddle made a mess of both of our lives. You’re not different to me. And I invited you to a courting dance because I want to court you.”
“Just a minute,” Hermione said, and at long last Draco relented, patting her shoulder briefly. “Thank you. You’ll never know how much… thank you.”
“Pansy is the only person in the world who knows where I am. At least, she was, up until… what is it, now. Two months?”
“I think it’s wonderful,” she said, quietly. “That you’re going to teach. I keep thinking about Dumbledore’s Army. How we learned more from you then than we’d ever learned in class — though Professor Lupin did a good job,” she finished, quietly. Another ache.
The moment she saw the woman enter the room, Hermione stood up, slipping a bookmark between the heavy vellum pages and setting the tome on the side table.
Just as exhausted, Harry brought the curse-box back, and opened it. “He called it fan mail. Does this happen often?”
“The Castle can accommodate it. Space is only space, Harry,” she said, taking her hand back and resting it on his shoulder. Narcissa was several inches taller than Harry even without her insistence on wearing the tallest heels that money could buy. There was something almost maternal in the gesture. “You could entertain guests. Adopt a family of kneazles — although I wouldn’t recommend that. They push things off tables, and those crystal tumblers are very old, fine Waterford crystal.” She seemed to sense Harry’s objection to owning anything that nice, and quickly moved on. “I would have liked for the three of us to have a meal together this evening but I am, unfortunately, otherwise occupied. A charity event.”
Harry tipped his mug over. The collection had been growing for a little while, now. He’d found some of Hedwig’s feathers, and put them in alongside the Hippogriff feathers. And Crookshanks’ whiskers — well, they were about five inches long.
“Sucking up,” Harry said, shrugging. “I guess. I can’t believe I fell for it all. If he’d come in all cocky and hit on me I’d have tossed him out on his arse. So I’m the idiot here, I guess.”
The advantages Harry had over Draco were significantly reduced by the fact that they had agreed that there would be no wandless or non-verbal magic; after all, it
When he had been somewhat reclusive, every time he appeared in public he was swamped with people who wanted to talk to him. Now that he was accessible, he was beginning to be just another British Wizard living in Diagon Alley. People thought of him as an excellent wand maker first, and Harry Potter second, and that was how he liked it.
“Another book? Well, I suppose they all sell, don’t they. But this is private. Like, you won’t use my name, right?” She looked anxious, and a little sly.
Because, there was a part of him that knew he hadn’t made a single mistake. He’d seen Potter’s gaze flick to his mouth, felt a hunger in him when they were close; Harry had summoned the music from the ballroom to the porch outside Malfoy Manor, despite resisting Draco’s efforts to get him to dance. And he’d thought it was such a good solution, too! Out there, with no eyes on them, he thought he might have been able to ease Potter from his discomfort.
Of course, everyone makes ridiculous faces when they come. Harry felt his mouth fall open, his eyes roll back in his head as the tug deep in his body, behind his balls, became impossible to control. As his balls tightened, and his thrusts lost their rhythm. And then he was coming, hard, with his teeth buried in Draco’s bottom lip.
Draco had a light breakfast of tea and toast in his room in the morning, reading over some notes for the N.E.W.T. class that afternoon. Satisfied, he headed out into the castle to find a student or two who was dressed untidily enough to warrant lose a house point or two — always important to keep them on their toes.
“Oh, not him. Fuck, probably gets a marriage proposal once a week, but he always says he’s married to the job, laughs it off. And he only dates models and movie stars, innit?”
Harry snickered. “I can’t imagine being bored, but as I have no idea where you’re going with this, I’ll just pretend I’m sat here waiting for you to say something a humble Auror can understand.”
“And then I met this boy. I rejected his friendship, at the time, and d’you know — I could have explained why at the time, but it doesn’t make a lot of sense to me now. Well, we were children.”
. I used those words, Harry, and I meant them. I might have taken the Dark Mark out of sheer fucking terror, but I was a ferocious little arsehole long before that. My father taught me about blood purity like it was a simple fact of life. I hurt people.”
“And here, I was planning to make you beg,” Harry said, clasping his hands behind his head as Draco started to kiss and lick down his body. It was much too soon for him to get hard again, he thought. Until Draco licked at a stripe of come on Harry’s stomach and moaned into his skin. “Good grief,” he muttered, reaching back with one hand to grip the headboard, moving the other back to the top of Draco’s fuzzy head.
“We’ve just got two more songs left for yeh,” the singer said, and Harry noticed the Scottish brogue he didn’t seem to sing with. “And we’ll let yehs be, right. This is Mikey on skins, Penny on bass, Draco on guitar and I’ve been Jackson. We’ve been the Burnt Lips.”
“Good girl,” Hermione said, scratching the back of her neck. Persephone was a beautiful owl. She closed her eyes and hooted softly, nibbled gently at Hermione’s finger, and flew to her perch to eat in peace.
“Hullo,” he said. Some of the students greeted him back; some giggled (including a few of the girls, hands covering their mouths; Merlin, did he not want to have to worry about something like that), and a few sat waiting for him to, what, explain how they’d won the war?
The Healer crossed the room to Harry’s bedside, cast a couple of quick diagnostic spells that Hermione was coming to recognise instantly (Harry’s stasis was holding, for now; his vitals were normal. He was just… asleep).
Draco closed his hand around Harry’s cock, and his own, rubbing slowly and torturously — no way in the seven hells was he going to hasten this.
“Do the houses mix, much?” Harry asked Malfoy, at lunch. There was a little splash of colour here or there, but for the most part, the houses still sat in their rows, oldest students at the back where teachers wouldn’t have to listen to them lie about their sexual conquests, youngest students at the front so the teachers could watch for any homesickness.
“I asked,” Draco said, as Blaise poured him another drink. “How he was found. That’s all it says, in the file. He was
Harry swore under his breath, and raced back to examine the damage. When he pushed Malfoy’s sleeve up, he could see where the curse was growing, the dark tendrils trying to take root. He gritted his teeth. At least it was something that he had seen before. He conjured a small crystal bottle and pulled out his wand.
“No, please, Hermione. I wouldn’t change a thing. And in the end, he helped me to come back. He gave me that choice and he let me make it, and I don’t regret that, either. You need to know that with all of this fucking garbage in my life, I’m okay, or at least, I’m getting there. And it wouldn’t have happened without the Mind Healer I’ve been seeing since I pulled my thumb out of my arse and agreed to commit to Draco’s rehabilitation program. And I sure as fuck wouldn’t have been able to do it without him.”
He sat. He thought. He was quite certain that all of the thinking was connected in one way or another. He let it stir his mind and ripple across his robes. He felt the sun bake it into his skin.
“Oh, I’ve always been happy,” Luna replied, her chin tilted just so. “It’s only a state of mind, you know. You choose it. It’s not a place you arrive at.”
“One day,” he said, knowing that there was nothing he could do to help a memory, but needing to speak nonetheless, “you’ll be loved, Harry. You’ll be so loved.”
Draco stood up, and locked the door to his office with a little swish of his wand. “And why would I let you do that, Potter?”
Draco laughed, and stretched his arms over the back of the sofa. “I’m surprised anything you come in contact with isn’t cross with you. You are, after all, the King of the Gryffindor gits.”
Draco favoured a wine bar nearby; it was run by two Wizards, easily a hundred years old and married since they were out of school. Most of the patrons were Wizarding folk as well, but Italy had rather a more relaxed view of Muggle-Wizard relations, and many of the tables were mixed; Muggle friends and partners laughed quietly alongside their more magically inclined loved ones. In the back corner, three vampires sat quietly, minding their business and drinking from pewter goblets, rather than glasses.
“Yes, thank you for reminding me of lessons I learned two decades ago — you’re a prince of a textbook, really you are.”
and opened the door to his office. Apparently the climate spell was glitching again; shortly after midnight, and the sun was shining. He closed the blind and the gaslights around the room lit automatically.
She stepped back a little, careful to stand between Draco and the other two, standing by the couch as if they were waiting to be told what to do next, and maybe they were.
He’d had feelings for Malfoy, but this disappointment paled in comparison to almost any other loss he’d experienced. He’d survive. And if nothing else, this had jerked him awake. Showed him that there were things missing from his life; sex, and companionship, and someone to share his life with. Things he hadn’t thought mattered, knowing he had friends and family and meaningful work. But they mattered.
“But,” Emrys said. And he paused. Draco poured more drinks. He poured too much. He wondered suddenly about writing himself off and then begging off sick tomorrow. “But. If you are the cream of the crop, and you are asked to treat someone you care for — can you say no? That’s an entirely different question. Tell me, Topher…” Emrys frowned. His eyebrows were like great fat caterpillars, and his face was so expressive even without them that he looked comical, in deep thought. He had the glass of Firewhiskey in his hand, and he was swirling his glass lazily as he thought. “Imagine you fell in love with a Healer yourself. I don’t know, what sort — let’s say a cardiovascular expert. Imagine that they were the absolute best of the best.”
“What makes you think I’ll want to hear from you? You paid your bill. Aren’t we finished?” He tried not to smile, but he could feel the sparkling under his eyelids.
Not fair, not fair. Harry didn't know Draco. Not the real Draco. Only the one... well only the one who had taken up residence in his head a long time back and never really left, fuelled by... but Harry wasn't ready to think about that. “Beautiful. Really. Are you sure…?”
looked like she belonged on a magazine cover. “And Draco Malfoy.” Hermione kept pushing food in her direction. She really needed something to soak up the alcohol. “Who’d have ever thought.”
“You know something — I’m not dwelling on this. It’s December. It’s nearly Christmas, and I’m not letting that manipulative git ruin it for me. And my New Year’s Resolution is… I’m going to start dating. Properly dating. Relationship-type dating.”
Harry slipped his hand between their bodies, conjured a little lube in his hand and took both cocks together, grinning when Draco’s head tipped back, insensible, his eyes rolling in his head. “Is that what you want?”
Harry stared at the knife in his hand; the handle was a snake, and the blade was carved with runes. As Harry stared at the handle, it flexed its wings. Not a snake; a Wyvern.
this, Harry?” Ollivander gave it a little wave, and smiled as the orange and gold sparks shot out from the end. “Is this — Kneazle whisker?”
“Not really,” Blaise said, sauntering to the bar, his Unspeakable robes shrunk down and tucked into his pocket, wearing dark grey trousers with a perfect crease beneath a black t-shirt which drew the ayes of almost everyone in the room, whether desirous or envious. “I was a snooty git in school just like you. I’m not sure either of us have changed. We’ve just got different bits hanging out, now. Metaphorically speaking, of course.”
him, Draco. Harry was my best friend and we survived the war together, and I left him all alone. We didn’t say a word to each other for almost two years, and I told myself it was because we were both so busy. He was always in the papers. Winning an award. Going to a party with some famous Witch on his arm. Making speeches and donations and then… winning another fucking award, and sometimes I resented that Ron and I — we were just the
“Well, I wasn’t. And I know it’s not fair. Not many people fall in love at fourteen and stay that way for the rest of their lives. But Harry — you’ve seemed so terribly lonely.”
“I want you,” Harry said, evenly, but there was something vaguely threatening about his tone which made Draco’s cock twitch, and the hair stand up on the back of his neck. He stepped in front of Harry, hands on the balustrade on either side of his hips.
It was a little like using a Portkey. The pressure behind his navel, the sickening pull, and he was just —
Hermione wanted to look at the map, she did. The lines moved, showing the different versions of the house, the two layers, as it were.
And there it was, quite suddenly. Here in the clearing, there were dark stones and about a million flowers budding and ready to bloom. It was pretty — actually, it was very pretty. It was…
Hermione gave a weak smile, intended to convey that Ron was managing with it as well as he managed with anything; by working hard the shop, refusing to think about unpleasant things and hoping it would all work out. She didn’t begrudge him that. “He’s well. Glad to hear you’ll be coming home.”
Christopher Black, since Draco Malfoy’s name is Death Eater mud, but beyond that… it was a coincidence, I promise. One I meant to keep secret and would have, without Minister Granger’s mysterious companion. Rather immune to Glamours.”
Harry had nothing to say to that. He took another bottle of beer and chilled it, passing it to Draco once it was open.
“Oh, Harry.” She tipped her head to the side and took his hand. “I don’t know where this all came from. But even if you hadn’t saved my son’s life, along with the rest of the world… you’re perfectly adequate just as you are.”
“I told you, he doesn’t go there, much. You’ve seen it. No. There was a break in a case. He was in his office. He has a terrible habit of sleeping up there when he’s worked late and he’s too tired to apparate.”
. It felt quite extraordinary to be the sole focus of all that intensity, and he couldn’t help but take Harry’s hips into his hands and pull him in close.
“I have more money than I could spend in five lifetimes,” Harry replied. He felt himself getting lighter. He felt himself imagining the gentle joy of coming to work in Diagon Alley every day, learning wandlore, working with wood. “I don’t care about money. Are you asking me to apprentice to you?”
Draco looked like he was searching for something cutting to say and then his shoulders dropped minutely. “Better,” he admitted.
). Saturday was busy in the shop. Draco was a ghost upstairs, sleeping a lot, eating a little, and keeping out of sight.
“I’d hate to disappoint your house,” Harry replied, shrugging. “I’m sure you’ve told them to expect terrible things from me.”
Hermione felt chastened. And she still wasn’t sure she agreed; but there was definitely something there to think about. Draco sat back in his chair, with a contemplative expression on his face. He reached for his quill, and made a few more notes.
He should have opened the paper right away, but a sickly anxiety crushed his stomach, his ribs, his chest, and he was terrified. What had happened? Harry was ill, again; Harry had died. Harry had married Whatshername Warbeck.
“I have to get back,” Harry said. He looked younger, by firelight, the grey in his hair lost to the highlights that flickered with the flames. “I have work to do. It’s important.”
Hermione snickered at Draco, which he liked; it suggested she was a lot more comfortable with him these days and also much more able to tell when he was joking (he had no idea why the Golden Trio had always been so thick about this, but they were).
It was a maze, it really was. Harry knew for certain that he would never find his way around the place alone, but he had to assume he’d never need to. Many of the doors were heavily locked and warded, entire wings closed and when Harry thought about the things that had happened here he knew he’d never ask.
Ginny opened a bag of crisps. “Leave off, mum. No one knows what it’s all about, except that he and Harry are mad about each other.”
“I look forward to it, Mother,” he said, mentally compiling a list of all the things they needed to discuss. It was not a short list.
There was a part of him that had known this might happen. Harry’s magical signature had been getting weaker much faster than his physical strength, and it felt like he was giving up. But they were so fucking close, and all that Draco could think was that Harry might never get a chance for a real day off. Or a week, or a month. Or to decide he was done, and spend the rest of his life making decisions that didn’t leave him scarred and in need of escape.
Harry wanted to argue, but he couldn’t think of anything sensible to say. He wished Hermione was there. She’d have said something clever and true and maybe made Draco smile a little bit. Harry had nothing. The silence stretched on, and on, and he allowed himself to glance at Draco from time to time, hoping to see something on his face which might give the slightest clue as to his state of mind. Nothing presented itself. His expression was cool and so controlled, as it often was, and Harry couldn’t feel his magic. He wondered again how long it had been since Draco used it, and why, and whether it could come back. Whether Harry could create the right wand for him. If it was an emotional problem, a physical one. So much to wonder.
“I can’t help it,” Harry said. “You look like you’re cooking up some kind of dreadful scheme, and I have to pay attention so I don’t miss when you start.”
“Yes,” she said, carefully placing the wand back in the box. “I do hope your friend is alright, Mr Potter.”
She examined it, and took a breath. “It feels so good,” she said. “Not right for me — it’s so… strong,” she said, frowning. “It feels as if it wants to build things.”
“But Harry — you’re important too,” he said. “Not because you’re Harry Potter, Saviour of the Wizarding World, The Boy Who Lived, and winner of Witch Weekly’s Most Charming Smile Award too many times to count. Not because you’re a skilled Auror, and you have a chocolate frog card in your honour. Just because… because you’re a
“Hogwarts,” he said, with a half-laugh. “I’m sorry, Madam Shacklebolt. Perhaps I need a holiday. I could spend some time at the seaside; I have friends who…”
“No,” Draco said, and in a rush, he knew exactly where he needed to go. “Please. One more. If you want to go, after that — fine, we’ll rest on the couch until you’re dead and I’m sobbing. Wondering what might have been.”
The nursery — which, Draco had realised very late, he himself had slept in sometimes as a child — was the room behind the door that had been drawn on in crayon, with no clear way to open it.
He looked at the place where he had been standing when Draco had fallen to his knees, and he felt a burning in his throat. He stepped quickly out of the kitchen lest his posture betray him.
“Harry is trapped in a world he has constructed for himself. The general layout is Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place. Not as it is now — usually — but a home, light and airy and full of memories and lies. Most of the doors are locked or boarded up in some way, though I have managed to find my way into several of them, now. These are the memories. Things he can’t escape from but won’t examine, either. Things I doubt he has ever really spoken of. Including his childhood in Little Whingeing.” He pointed to a room on the map that Hermione knew had once been a nursery. “A bathroom I have come to understand is probably the Chamber of Secrets at Hogwarts, here. Complete with large, angry snake, and more green smoke than I generally prefer to breathe in. Descending into the larder in the basement, I found myself trapped in a memory of Harry appearing before the entire Wizengamot after conjuring a fully corporeal Patronus charm to save himself and that awful fucking cousin of his. In the memory, he is about the size of a Kneazle kitten and his feet don’t touch the floor, while everyone on the Wizengamot… well, they look like Dementors themselves, if I’m honest.”
“Kreacher has a staff,” Kreacher said. He climbed down off the table, and stood between the two elves. Their eyes were as large as his were small. “Kreacher will go, now. Kreacher has work to do.”
There were fifteen students staying behind; four Slytherin, seven Ravenclaw (three related), and two students each from Gryffindor and Hufflepuff. There were a handful of staff as well, including Harry and Draco. Without discussion they assembled at the Ravenclaw table and feasted heartily. Harry sat by Draco, and Draco didn’t pull away when their thighs touched. He was barbed, and quiet, and affectionate, endured the gentle teasing of the students and laughed when the headmaster made her very festive hat light up with fireflies.
All of these months he had shifted between ages; inside his memories, of course, he could be as young as a year old, but when he was at Twelve Grimmauld Place in what passed for the present, he tended to range from his early twenties to his mid thirties, saving his real age for those horrifying moments of clarity when he took in some memory that had long been locked away.
He was expecting Malfoy to look angry. Or to be rolling his eyes, ready with a barb. But he looked… fuck it. He looked sad, and worried, and disappointed, and that was about a thousand times worse.
Draco spent several seconds staring out into a crevasse of rocks and burning shrubs in absolute horror, wishing that he had considered literally any other branch of Healing — indeed, any other
“I neglected her so badly, Hermione. I know she’ll never accept me again. Not after all this time. Just… sleeping in my office, and when I went back there I used to Floo into the bedroom directly… all the dust, and probably mould… I really fucked up, there, didn’t I?”
“I think it’s time I sought formal emancipation,” Draco said, though his voice was strangled and his face was pink.
Harry sighed. He wished very much that he hadn’t opened this particular can of worms. The last thing he needed was Draco fucking Malfoy to feel sorry for him. And just when they were getting along better, too. He scratched at his forehead.
“I think he probably is. D’you know, We were out in the field once, a big raid, maybe a dozen Aurors. This group takes Muggle drugs, right, treats ‘em with spells, charms, all that malarkey, sells them to Muggles and Wizards alike. The place blew up. Bunch of us were hurt, course, can’t avoid that, but no one died, thank Salazar. Anyway the mobile mediwizards came to patch us up in the field and I saw him without his shirt on — never seen so many scars on a Wizard before! Can’t pretend we weren’t all having a good look. He’s handsome, isn’t he?”
“I don’t think I’m ready,” Harry said, staring into the middle distance. He didn’t respond to Draco’s touch, his eyes, the kiss to the hinge of his jaw. He just stared at nothing.
“I simply can’t wait to put the Boy Who Lived on his arse,” Draco drawled, much to the amusement of the students.
“You’re invited as well, of course,” Bill said to Draco. He didn’t look up, though. Harry wanted to know if Draco was looking at Bill’s scars, if he was thinking about that night. The air could not have been harder to breathe.
to hear this, every word of it. She needed to hear it all and then examine it in a pensieve until she could figure out how it fit in with everything she knew, or thought she knew, about Draco Malfoy, the littlest Death Eater.
“No, that’s not what — I don’t want you to leave. But I feel as if you need some help, and you’re too stubborn to ask for it, and… — I mean something
“I think I’m still off my rocker,” Harry said drolly. “But I’m not sure that was new. I’m — I shouldn’t be here. Malfoy wants me to stay. A few months, he says, or a few weeks, at the very least. Hermione, I can’t. I —”
“Mum and Dad are in Romania, visiting Charlie,” Ron said, with a frown. A moment later, Ginny stepped out of the Floo as well, with a big smile on her face and a dramatic undercut on one side of her head. “Gin! I heard you’re the starting Seeker next week?”
“I don’t want you to be a long weekend. But the rest — I don’t know what I’m doing. And I’m not saying that to be modest. I have no fucking clue what I’m doing. I just know I want to do it with you.”
“I’m rubbish at gifts,” Harry admitted, with a sigh. “D’you suppose Draco needs a… a new snitch, perhaps? One of those ones that comes ack when you call it?”
Harry hadn’t wanted to compete in the Tri-Wizard Tournament. He’d begged to be excused, on account of his being
But he wasn’t, of course. He held his arm to his chest, bright bruises already blooming on his shoulder. I was no longer dislocated; Draco knew well enough that the joint had been pulled out and then slipped back in moments. But it obviously still hurt, and badly. Harry was breathing strangely, and tears poured from his green eyes, but he was determined not to make a sound. Draco imagined himself, at this age; whatever age it was. Harry looked like he might be small for his age. He’d have screamed until the paint started peeling off the walls.
“Professor Malfoy,” Potter replied, nodding slowly. “Thank you. I’m very pleased to be here.” There was wariness in his eyes, but relief, as well, and in that passing way that Draco tended to pick up on emotions when he wasn’t paying attention (being distracted, for example, by a particular shade of green) he felt him relax as well.
He was blessed to be a part of this; and if it was all he’d ever have, it would still be a blessing.
“Harry, where do you want to meet for our lunch date on Tuesday?” Hermione asked brightly as she wrapped her scarf around her neck. Harry was about to ask what she was talking about when he saw that familiar steel in her eyes.
Draco’s arse met the cool tile of the bathroom wall, and he slid all the way down, landing in an inelegant pile, tears streaming down his cheeks. “Because I’m asking you to. Because I’ll beg, if you want me to.”
Draco waited patiently. If only he’d worn his old expression of revulsion, she might have kept her composure better.
“No, thank you,” Draco said. More like the old Draco, polite to adults (and in front of adults) than the version who had broken Harry’s nose only a few months ago. “I don’t use magic anymore.”
Hermione sighed. “I think he just couldn’t bear to be at Hogwarts anymore. Knowing what he’d lost. Those memories. Is there anything else?”
“Let me know when there’s news,” Ginny said. She squeezed Hermione’s shoulder. “And stop fucking blaming yourself. That’s all any of us do, isn’t it? Blame ourselves, instead of putting it where it belongs. When Harry gets back he’s going to need you. Just as you are. Not crying on him and blubbering a thousand apologies.”
A familiar hand settled on Draco’s shoulder and gave a gentle squeeze. He didn’t look up, but he tore his gaze from Potter’s.
But Harry Potter was her best friend, too. And it was impossible sometimes to know if she was the Minister for Magic, or Hermione Granger, Muggle-born Witch. And it was also hard to know if Harry was… the sum of all of his accolades, or Harry Potter.
Black,” Harry said. His eyes were bright and determined and even if it was disappointing that Harry hadn’t just stepped into Draco’s space and pulled him close, there was something about Harry’s posture that said Draco needed to let this happen at its own pace. As Draco let his Glamour shift, Harry gave a small shake of his head. The Glamour slipped back up as easily as it had slipped down. “I don’t have an appointment, but I was hoping that we could talk.”
By the time Harry was back in his rooms he was in physical discomfort, he was so hard. He barely made it through the door before he was tossing his robes aside, unzipping his jeans and throwing himself onto his back on the bed with one hand wrapped around his cock, jerking furiously. He sucked the fingers of his other hand into his mouth and wet them just enough to make them slick against his nipples, the various other erogenous zones that he’d found over the years.
“And it’s not just me, either. Blaise, Nott, Bulstrode… well, if you see him,” Pansy said with a sigh. She took a scrap of parchment from the countertop and scribbled an address; sufficient for owls, anyway. “We should go. Lots to buy.”
Harry reached out to pat Hermione’s hand fondly. “I’m alright, ‘Mione. I’m not going to break. But you know, if I’d grown up with a Wizarding family I might well have grown up like that. And then I would have been that entitled brat. I wouldn’t have had the fortitude I came to Hogwarts with, and I could well have failed. Refused to do what I had to, or…”
Blaise nodded. “I’ll come by in a few days with some booze. The honey liqueur I started last year is bloody fantastic.” He hesitated at the Floo as if he had something to say, and for a second, Harry remembered what he’d said to Hermione, so long ago;
“Your definition of light duties would probably frighten the hair off most people’s heads, so I won’t ask.” Draco looked at his book again, but he couldn’t even pretend to read, now. He reached for his bookmark, a pretty, embroidered thing that a patient had given him, with a tree on it that changed as the seasons passed. Right now, it was looking rather optimistically summery, ready for the flowers to become fruit. He tossed the book onto the coffee table.
“One of the old gang, who helped to save the world,” Draco said miserably. He was going to need his own hangover cure in the morning. “
There were quiet tears, of course, throughout the afternoon and early evening. Harry doubted that there would ever be a holiday where they didn’t find themselves thinking about everyone they’d lost.
Draco let out a tortured moan, and seemed to collapse in on himself. Harry had no choice but to catch him, ease him to the ground, wrap arms around him.
“Alright,” Draco said, with a smile, his entire body thrumming with need. He glanced at the furniture. “I don’t usually consult up here.”
Ron and Hermione ate greasy hamburgers at the table at Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place, for the first time in over two decades. Ron looked over the parchments and puzzled over what hidden rooms there might be in the house.
When Harry went home he was feeling cheerful and creative so he fed Scamp a treat and spent a few hours in his workshop. It was time to be finished with this wand. It had come out precisely as he’d pictured it in his head; the deep red that looked black without strong light, the flames carved low on the base, the deep shine. His first successful thestral-hair wand. It had the most beautiful melancholy about it, and reminded him of something (or perhaps someone) he couldn’t quite bring to mind.
“I’ll send a team of curse breakers and Aurors over there as soon as possible,” he promised, at last. “Thank you, Harry.”
“Tell me about our first kiss,” Draco said, and Harry didn’t really feel like it but there was nothing quite like being the sole focus of Draco Malfoy’s affection.
“I’m exploring my sexuality,” Harry replied, innocently. “Remember how it’s all my Mind Healer’s idea? Well, there you go. It’s therapeutic.”
“You know we’ll need to go to Dumbledore,” Harry said. His voice echoed unpleasantly around the bathroom, like some portent of doom. The acoustics in here were frankly terrifying; Draco had always thought so. He might have chosen somewhere slightly less dreadful to have a nervous breakdown and prostrate himself at Harry Potter’s feet.
Harry rolled them over without dislodging himself, and Draco clamped his legs tightly around Harry’s hips. The spark wasn’t just in his eyes. The air all around them had begun to crackle like it was full of fireworks, burning their skin and making the air somehow thinner and richer at the same time.
Harry nodded dutifully, his hand still wrapped around Draco’s mother’s hand, his green eyes still so wide. The large bed, with its soft coverings and thick blankets, curtains around it — was that not a bit juvenile, Draco had thought at first, but now he saw that Harry liked the idea of being able to close them around him to sleep, as if he was back in —
Blaise and Hermione shared a long look. Draco sipped his wine and tried not to hate them both. Hating them both would serve no real purpose, of course. He scratched his forehead.
“I’ve known him since we were eleven years old and starting school together.” Draco flushed, humiliated, and then he told Emrys… everything.
“No,” Draco answered, frowning. “A prat would have laughed at me. You… you were… I think you were afraid. And there’s more than one reason that could have been. I’m curious as to which it was.”
Harry wanted to say… something. Anything. A murmured apology. Or perhaps ask some questions. But the tightness in Draco’s jaw told him it wouldn’t be welcome; it was just something he’d needed to say out loud.
It took Harry some time to dry Draco’s clothes with warming charms, once he had him in front of the fire in the workshop. He seemed to slip in and out of consciousness, but he didn’t speak again, and eventually, whispering soothing words, Harry managed to reach for Draco, touch him, hold his arm.
“It’s very, very easy to hate someone forever,” she said, pouring cream into a bowl. “Much too easy. It’s hard to forgive them and impossible to forget the things they’ve done. What’s harder still is to stand up and acknowledge all of the hardest parts, the worst of someone… and love them anyway.” She flicked her wand and a beater leapt up to whip the cream.
Harry hated to acknowledge that he had so much raw power. He hated that he even had it; the risks were terrible, and it was embarrassing. He briefly regretted having had this conversation at all. He rubbed his hands together.
“There is a wide world of difference between me sharing information about his present state with you, as his medical proxy and friend. It is another thing entirely for me to share details of things that occurred three decades ago without his permission, when he has clearly chosen not to share them with you for a reason. I’ve said far too much. It was unprofessional of me.”
“It’s alright to want to fall in love,” Draco mused. “And be happy with someone. I wish I could hear the music better.”
“He was asleep in his office, on his day off. He was summoned to be backup on a case that wasn’t his, at which point he was found asleep and unable to be woken.”
The three of them sat, for a while, waiting for Malfoy to wake. Professor McGonagall glanced around the room, more than once, but her eyes returned to Malfoy every time.
The worst thing of all: the way Harry had wanted to reach for him, wrap his arms around Draco, kiss that pale, fragile throat. Rescue him from whatever the fuck was going on.
Harry frowned. This was not what he had been expecting. Malfoy looked for a moment as if he had something else he wanted to say to Ron but was rapidly running out of steam. In fact, his hands had begun to shake.
“I don’t hate you. You did save the world, after all, and I don’t have alternative accommodations available.”
Malfoy rested his hands on the edge of the counter. “I can’t believe I fucked that up. It was really the only plan I had.”
“Harry, my boy,” the old man said, his hands shaking a little as he closed them around one of Harry’s, a little while later. Harry had dawdled terribly, stopping at a Muggle coffee shop to flirt with the man who always made his coffee, and to scarf down a couple of chocolate croissants. He’d stopped at the joke shop to see how George was doing. Angelina was there, and while George looked no less lost than he ever did without his twin, he did smile at her once or twice, quite wistfully.
“Teach me what?” Harry said, joking gently. “Sounds pretty simple to me — I thought the wand chose the Wizard, sir.” He only smiled when Ollivander pretended to slap the back of his head.
“Well,” Harry replied, wishing she’d accepted the other version of his sentence. “If they’d done something terrible, or… and I didn’t say in love.” Pedantic. He’d almost said it.
into a vampire,” Professor Saltzman said. “Isobel Flamel. Obsessed with immortality. You might have heard of her, uh… dozens of times great grandfather.”
“Maybe I should try to bring Hermione down with you, but your menagerie of horrors might put the dear Minister’s knickers in something of a twist, d’you think? Maybe one of your actress girlfriends. Or Gisella Warbeck. Would you be trying to talk them out of their clothes? You know Gran- Hermione is the only one of your so-called friends who so much as hinted that the reason these fairy-tale romances of yours don’t end in… a fairy-tale romance is that you might prefer dating Gisella Warbeck’s brother. Though I’ve heard he’s a dreadful flirt who never puts out. Maybe you’ve got that in common. Cheeky bastard,” he added under his breath. He unbuttoned Harry’s shirt.
you love chocolate, because the last time we chaperoned the children to Hogsmeade, you inhaled a block of it that was almost the size of your head.”
The house wasn’t at all what Harry would have imagined. It wasn’t icy and clean like the Manor; it felt lived-in, even if Draco did claim not to spend a lot of time there. A pile of books was stacked untidily on the coffee table in front of the fireplace and the large corner couch was overstuffed and rumpled and looked very comfortable indeed. The place was full of oddities he looked forward to exploring when he had a lot more energy and the scent of wintergreen simmering slowly in a cauldron told Harry exactly where Draco’s potions laboratory was.
He rested his elbows on the table, his face in his hands. He felt a cautious press of a finger against his shoulder, and looked down. Lissie, one of the house elves. He had sewn her a dress whilst he was on house arrest, all of those years ago. Pricked his fingers dozens of times while he tried to master the simple housekeeping charms required. He’d made the dress from a pretty pillowcase he’d found, a sweet, soft blue with teal paisley in the background, overlaid with pink roses.
When Hermione was curled up in bed with Ron, in one of the newly-decorated guest bedrooms which was anything but dark, Harry lay awake and turned it all over in his brain. It did seem like a bit much, some days. His childhood had been a bit rubbish. (More than a bit, but it seemed to pale in comparison to the rest.) And then Tom Riddle — not being believed and being believed and realising that Dumbledore’s kindness had all been a part of leading him to die for the rest of the world —
He knew he had won when Hermione’s final Owl was nothing but a scrawled, angry face and a demand that Persephone (who was a stunning creature and welcome to grace Draco’s rooms at the hospital anytime) only be returned when Draco was satisfied that Harry was ready for a visitor.
And they could be terrible. If he tried to extract himself from a situation he wasn’t comfortable with, they still sometimes shouted and called him names, accused him of thinking he was too big for his britches.
“And your handwriting doesn’t at all look like you dropped a handful of spiders into an inkwell and let them run all over the page.”
At the door to his quarters, he hesitated. He could do the work out here, but the rooms were cosy, and the fire was roaring, and he wasn’t going to pretend to himself that he didn’t want Potter to come inside. Otherwise, he would have offered to make the potion on his own and had a House-elf deliver it.
“I’m going to take you upstairs,” he said, and apparated them both as gently as he could to one of the spare rooms.
“So,” he said, “what you’re saying is that it would be economically responsible of us to support small local businesses by going down the street to buy ice cream.”
“I shall speak to Headmaster McGonagall,” he said. “And we’ll need to find a time when there are no Quidditch practices scheduled. I think it’s a fine idea.”
. You’re expecting to reach some sort of a point where you’re good enough for Draco, and it makes absolutely no sense — because you’ve come far enough to understand that we don’t love people for overcoming their troubles. We just love them. You’ll never believe that you’re good enough for Draco, any more than he’ll believe he’s good enough for you.”
“Oh — yeah!” Ron replied, turning toward the over-stuffed bookcase. The bottom shelf held several photograph albums, all enormous. He lifted two, and dangled them awkwardly, unsure where to put them. Topher took a satchel from his shoulder and held it open.
Harry felt tears prickle his eyes. So many years of trying to be someone other than the Boy Who Lived, the Chosen One, the Saviour. Trying to find his place in the world and forget his terrible power and anything resembling destiny. And he’d won, in so many ways. Here, in his shop, creating things instead of destroying, using his magic in gentle and artistic pursuits. But Draco?
Hermione came very close to giving a very snippy — and highly revealing — retort, but she bit her tongue.
“I didn’t have much of a demand on my time other than work. It was a way to pass the time. I don’t know. The focus was good practice. I don’t have accidents anymore. You know — accidental magic. Except if a nightmare is especially… anyway. Or at least… not as often.”
“Can you zip me? Blaise can’t exactly join us,” she said, embarrassed. “He’ll be there, of course, but he can’t… until he’s resigned… fuck. I need to stop taking third helpings of everything you cook.” She turned around when Harry had zipped the back of her dress. “Everything is so complicated. With all the fuss that was made of me being elected Minister. A woman, and single…”
Draco nodded and crossed to the tiny kitchenette — just a couple of cupboards, space for a kettle, and running water. He opened the cupboard to retrieve a bottle of Firewhiskey and two beautiful old crystal tumblers.
Draco moved closer. “Do you want me enough to work for it? Fight for it? Thumb your nose at those tossers at the Prophet, stand up for yourself in front of your friends and mine, and for once in your life take something you want?”
“I wanted to be dead. I wished that something terrible would happen to me at school, that I’d be accidentally killed, because I thought that would be the only way I could escape without my parents paying the price. Do you know… in Sixth Year, I got so desperate that I almost went to Harry for help. But I convinced myself Harry would think I was weak. Throw me to the Ministry. Something.”
“And then, I’ll do this,” Draco said, more seriously, He angled his head just so, and leaned the last couple of inches until he could taste Harry’s mouth. Warm and wet and pliant, willing and needy. Draco felt Harry’s hips roll beneath him. “Do you need a parchment? So you can take notes?”
“Oh, he’s interested in sex, alright,” Draco said. His expression was inscrutable. Amused, sad. Something else, too. “Do you think he might have some kind of secret life that you’re not aware of? A lover?”
Hermione shrugged, and poured, and pushed a cup across the table. “As far as I have been able to figure out,” she said. “What happened to that
Harry laughed, and Draco smirked until he couldn’t smirk anymore because Harry had switched angles just right and he was coming, instead, coming against Harry’s chest, come dripping from his snail trail and over his scars. The sight of it had his hips snapping faster, Draco holding on for dear life.
“So that’s all.” Draco rolled his eyes, and elected against tasking Harry if his use of the present tense indicated that he intended to return to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. “Necessity is the mother of mastering the most difficult bloody magic in the world.”
“It’s a timeline. The black is the true timeline.” He waved his wand elegantly over the page and murmured
“So we’re talking about your comatose patient.” Draco nodded, focusing on the moody water over the cliffs. “I had wondered. You did cancel a few of our sessions.”
“It’s alright,” he said. “Really. I’m not going to bury myself in my head again. It’s one night. It was bound to happen eventually. It’s time to go back to work.”
“I need an elf,” he called, and with a loud crack, he heard two appear in his room. Two was even better. He spoke firmly. “I need you to bring Madam Pomfrey,” he said, nodding at the first, who disapparated just as quickly as he had appeared. “And I need you to summon the Headmaster.”
“Time to go and be adults, I suppose,” Harry said, reluctantly, but they both headed for the castle doors. Draco felt almost tipsy. Adrenaline, and joy, and the unfamiliar hum of Harry’s magic, which began to dissipate as they entered the warm castle.
“I’m leaving,” Malfoy said. “There’s no place for me here. Not after everything I’ve done. You’re right to hate me. You all are.”
“The magical part of the injury will slow the healing of the non-magical part,” Harry said. “This reminds me a great deal of a trap my partner and I stumbled into in Belgium.”
In the first week of March, Harry helped Andromeda and Teddy to move into Grimmauld Place. She’d said
“I hope so. I think so,” Hermione said, and she indicated a chair at her little meeting table, before casting
“Fantastic,” Ron said again, grinning. “You’re like a proper Muggle sometimes, Harry. You’ll have to tell dad all about it.”
That all sounded improbable but it wasn’t something Harry had the mental capacity to consider at that point. Of course Blaise had seen through the Glamour; even Harry had little difficulty with that.
“Aunt Andromeda,” he said formally, and Harry found himself wondering how exactly this man and the nose-breaking punk guitar player existed in the same body. “It’s very nice to see you.”
“Ollivander thinks it’s because I mastered so many wands in quick succession. And because I’m so — …
Harry slipped his fingers under his glasses and rubbed his eyes, set the wand down by the television. “I must have missed your owl.”
“All Aurors have partners, Draco. And we often worked in groups. You look surprised.” He met Draco’s eyes for a moment. He could probably see the green-eyed monster lurking behind Draco’s eyes. Draco hoped not. All of this was getting ridiculously complicated without that to add to it.
“After the war,” Harry started, and then he stopped. “No. Honestly, everything starts a lot further back than that. I haven’t had the easiest life, if I’m honest.”
When Draco woke that final morning he was, for a moment, as disoriented as it is possible to be in completely familiar surroundings, and in the company of someone with whom one has spent most of ones time for months on end. Draco was getting used to waking on the transfigured bed, held down by mystical sleep, with his fingers tangled up with Harry’s. And Harry never moved. Never took his hand back. The sheets were never rumpled and nor were the soft flannel pyjamas Harry wore.
“I’m not proud. I use all sorts of methods. Muggle medications don’t work well on us, but I can sometimes pull together an equivalent potion — and psychology is psychology. We all have the same drives, in the end.” He yawned.
“Scamp?” he called, and the owl descended from the rafters. She was still a funny little thing, not very dignified, but embarrassed by her indignities. She would enjoy a good long scratch around the neck and then bite, hard, reminding Harry that she was the boss. Like a cat, Harry supposed.
It was almost an hour later that Harry stoppered the bottle. He put it aside, and reached for Malfoy’s hand; it seemed thin, dehydrated, but the normal colour. No further tendrils of magic invaded his wrist, or his arm, and in truth even his face looked more peaceful.
“Psychiatry is very difficult with people who talk. It’s a damn sight harder when they won’t even wake up. I think I understand some of this, you know. You’ve constructed this life, and this house, hidden everything away in it that you don’t want to think about. We have to open every last one of those doors, Potter, or I’m never going to be able to wake you up.”
“And every week after that,” she growled, grinning ferally. “You just see if I’m not.” She threw her arms around Harry as well, and he wished momentarily that he ever paid any attention to the calendar that Hermione painstakingly updated for him whenever she came by.
“I know what headlights are, ‘Mione,” Ron said, with more confidence than he probably should have. “Muggles wear them to go exploring caves. Just can’t think why a deer would need one. They see well in the dark, and they don’t live in caves — do they?”
“Please don’t. I’m still a Slytherin, Harry. We’re like cats. It’s never a good idea to point it out when we do something less than dignified.”
So modest. No mention of the stupid amount of power Harry had, and the way it was rolling off him in reassuring warm waves again now. “And what
Harry leaned forward, elbows on his knees. He was silent, his mind churning, almost nauseous. The ducks, though. The ducks were great.
The bright spot was watching Neville and Luna. Harry tried not to do it for too long, but Neville shot him a delighted glance from time to time. Luna was wearing the most colourful dress at the whole party, unsurprisingly, and didn’t seem to give a whit that the other girls were looking down their noses at her for it.
Harry woke before the sun was up. He wasn’t surprised, but he was disappointed. He suspected that he had been having a very pleasant dream. Probably better that he didn’t remember it. His dreams had been about Draco for much too long, and he still burned with humiliation when he thought about the fact that Draco knew it.
Hermione was halfway to pulling him across the table in a bear hug before Harry was able to register that she, at least, was proud and happy. “It’s an incredibly rare gift,” she said. “And it’s usually genetic —”
didn’t seem to have faded much since school. But in almost twenty years working as a Healer Draco had never seen anyone with so many scars.
No first kiss is perfect. It takes time to find the right rhythm with someone new. But this kiss was very
When the food was done, Harry found his favourite bench was empty. He sat at one end, looking out over the water, enjoying the warm air, the cool breeze, and his contentment.
“Terribly embarrassing,” Harry replied, drily. “Very unlike you snorting bats. And can I remind you that I managed to toss a
, instead of… because of the stupid scar on my forehead.” He closed his eyes. He looked younger, for a moment. Unburdened, perhaps. Resolved, certainly.
He had done one more thing, in Diagon Alley. Harry had been very sure he couldn’t ever have another owl, after losing Hedwig; but somehow, taking control over his future had made him feel bold enough so that he now saw purchasing himself another owl as an act of forgiveness. She was a funny little thing, who cocked her head this way and that, and even seemed to dance sometimes on the perch he had conjured her in the kitchen so that she could get used to him.
“I’m not sure it’s really something I should pursue,” he said, sounding more confident than he was. “I have obligations. I still consult for the Aurors… there is your campaign to think about. How would the voters feel about me being… And more importantly I have
“I might try to get a couple more hours of sleep,” Draco said. He didn’t meet Harry’s eyes as he left. He slipped up the stairs like a sylph. Harry stared after him for what felt like a long time, thinking.
“I learned to ride a Muggle bicycle,” Harry said, with a laugh. “It’s much more difficult than a broom. And I’ve been feeding the ducks. Marvellous creatures, they are.”
Draco couldn’t remember the last time he’d had a proper cry. One of those good, painful, drawn-out snotfests that left one feeling scrubbed raw inside. But he sat up now, legs over the edge of the bed, and he cried. For himself. For Harry. For everyone who’d lived through the war and everyone who hadn’t. He cried for that fourteen year-old in the cemetery, too, and for the little fuckwit Draco had been until he’d looked up one day to find that his father wasn’t just mistaken, wasn’t just wrong, but knew it — and had made a conscious decision not to change, regardless.
But he could see what would happen. He saw Amelia’s fragile confidence vanish, going back to Bath to live with her Squib parents and never knowing the joy of letting her magic unfurl beneath her skin.
“I don’t know why you’d do that,” Harry said. His voice sounded very, very distant, and very tired. “I thought we were having a good day.”
No one acknowledged the lie. Instead, they chatted about inconsequential things, and when Arthur and Draco returned from the shed, Draco was holding a battered old acoustic guitar.
Saturday night at the Hog’s Head, then, for a few pints with some of the other teachers. And Sunday, somehow, Draco found himself in Harry’s room, curled up on a comfortable armchair while they both marked homework, chatting from time to time about Duelling Club the following evening, and eating an early supper in front of the fire, thick-cut bacon sandwiches and boiled eggs, followed by Harry’s beloved treacle tart.
“He just needs some help, is all,” Harry said, miserably. “I’m sure when he’s feeling better he’ll be off again.”
“I know. That’s why you keep buying me green clothes. I should never have told you I was almost sorted into Slytherin.”
Topher nodded, but didn’t say anything. He didn’t look like he was about to dissolve into some sort of Muggle-appropriate fit about it, or anything.
“You haven’t had another package, have you?” Harry asked, looking up from his marking with a frown. “I thought your packages were coming to me, unless they were from your mum.”
Draco looked at him with resignation, and then stood straighter. “Harry, do you not know how to dance?”
Rubino opened the door to Draco’s rooms. It seemed strange that he wouldn’t knock or announce himself, and Hermione wondered for a mad moment if Harry had leapt cheerfully from his coma and insisted that elf subservience was very thirteenth century and had to stop.
If he knew Harry sodding Potter, Boy Who Lived, Saviour of the Wizarding World and sole possessor of Draco Malfoy’s miserable, useless heart, he wouldn’t come right away.
He stood as straight as he could manage and headed for the kitchen. Harry could see the sharp shoulder blades through his clothes. With another, hopefully final sigh, he followed.
The mood in the room started to shift. Harry recognised it. There were a lot of people in the room who had put the pieces together, over the years, and others who were shocked by every syllable.
Their eyes caught. That had not come out the way that Draco had intended it, surely? And yet — he looked calm, and confident, and the way he held his upper body made Harry want to crawl under the fucking table and loosen those stupidly flattering trousers, suck until Malfoy couldn’t speak English anymore.
“My father will probably crawl from his grave to stop the wedding, but I’m game if you are. That could be quite funny, actually.”
Over dinner at the Leaky the weekend after Harry had settled Andromeda and Teddy into their new home, he and Ron and Hermione had talked about how strange things were.
He kept thinking about that bird. Chirping away one day and the next, a broken ball of feathers and bones. It had still been warm. It seemed to Draco as if a thing that warm had to still be alive, but then, wasn’t that worse? You couldn’t wish on any living thing that it might be alive in that sort of a state. Poor fucking bird.
Harry sighed dramatically. “Well, you remember. Sixth year. Remember how I followed you around. Fucking pathetic, really. And I followed you out of the Great Hall, and I found you in the bathroom.”
All of this — he’d been so clever, so careful, made Harry think they were getting closer. Made Harry think that affection was real, that his hesitation and his beautiful submission had been Harry’s idea. So little was known about re-awakening a dormant magical core, but if someone wanted to do that, what better source than what the Daily Prophet constantly referred to as the
It was one of the writers that Harry decided to hone in on. He stood too close, looked at the man’s mouth more often than was proper, and asked sensible questions about his
After a long silence, Draco looked up, with a cool, professional smile on his face. “Do you mind if I ask a question?”
So it was at sunrise that Hermione and Blaise apparated a mile from the wards of Malfoy Manor. Hermione frowned.
In the morning, Hermione found them like that, asleep, Ron’s head on Harry’s shoulder. She pulled a blanket up over their bodies and let them sleep while she helped Molly and George in the kitchen.
“There are a thousand years of Wandmakers in my family, Mr Potter,” the old man said, examining the tiny wand. “The skill usually passes down from generation to generation. But my son, bless his good heart — he was a Healer, until he retired, and so are all of his children. And my daughter, light of my life, was a rather famous Quidditch player, until she settled down to raise her own family, and took a coaching job instead. Of course, she’s retired too, and her children are so clever — they do all sorts of things. One of them is friends with your Charlie Weasley, works with dragons in Romania.” He pointed at a photograph on the wall, of a woman who looked rather a lot like Ollivander himself, dressed in Quidditch leathers and clutching a quaffle, sitting up on her broom occasionally to wave at the camera. There were dozens of photographs on the wall. Healers, and gardeners, and everything under the sun.
“Your dress is very pretty,” Harry said, surprised that she was wearing one at all. “Happy Christmas, Lissie.”
“I like the way some of them recognise me,” Harry admitted. He handed over an extra twenty pounds. “Give some to the kids for me, will you?” he asked, and then he stepped away. He knew that every time he did it, some of the money went into the man’s pocket, but he always gave some children duck food, and really, both sides mattered equally, there.
She didn’t expect to see Malfoy — Draco — Healer Black being strong-armed by a pair of unfamiliar Aurors.
“You can take that stick out of your arse,” she said, “and tell me how long you have been working for me.”
Draco wasn’t going to express an opinion about anything that was so very, very far from his business, so he waited silently.
“I’d pass those on, but he has a big enough head as it is,” Potter said, and he peeled off toward the second-floor classrooms. He was walking straighter. He looked almost as if he had combed his hair, but that was probably Draco’s unfounded streak of optimism speaking.
Kreacher was wringing his hands in some previously undescribed combination of happiness and abject desperation.
He thought about the nightmares they’d unlocked together. Sirius in the Room of Death. The fucking Basilisk. Harry’s cupboard in Little Whingeing.
Ron laughed. “You’re not nearly as stuck-up as I thought you might be. Nah, Harry and Hermione never… I mean, I don’t think Harry ever really…”
“Hullo,” Harry said. He was much more beautiful awake than asleep and much more beautiful in real life than he was in his dreams. Still in his pyjamas and now also wearing the robe and slippers that Draco had left him. Hands in his pockets, slightly stiff-looking, holding himself as straight as he could.
Harry smiled. “He said that, exactly, and then he told me that Wandmakers’ apprentices make an absolute pittance. And he offered me an apprenticeship, and I said yes.”
“Of course we will,” Hermione said, wiping her eyes. “But right now, I need to do some hard work so I don’t spend the whole day crying.” And that was what they did.
Harry sighed, and removed the pages from the envelope. He frowned. So many words. Harry had never blossomed into a passionate reader the way Hermione had hoped he might, and this looked like a lot of legalese that he wouldn’t have been able to understand anyway.
“I want to be a magi-zoologist when I grow up,” she confided, eyes wide. “D’you think you could introduce me to Luna Lovegood? Only I know you’re close.”
Malfoy sighed deeply, and stood. He reached into the pocket of his robes and pulled out two envelopes, and then he walked in the direction of the group.
“I think I have a lot of thinking to do,” he said. “Do you mind if — if I just stay here? Instead of coming back to yours — I can Floo in tomorrow and pick up my things.”
Draco, for his part, only looked relieved to have something to do that might stop people from talking to him. He sat delicately on the arm of a couch and began to tune the strings. They were old. Two snapped, and he hissed as he withdrew his hand, which bore a deep scratch across the back.
He sat morose with glass after glass of Firewhiskey. When Neville eventually dragged him back to the Defence corridor, he pressed a vial into Harry’s hand.
“I didn’t intend to. I’ve been busy. I have more paperwork to catch up on than I could poke my wand at, and —”
For a moment, Draco looked panicked, and Harry could have sworn his body tensed. Well, sappy as he could be himself, he couldn’t always deal with Harry’s sap.
Potter was staring at the ruins of the Dark Mark on Draco’s arm, but shook his gaze away, embarrassed. “Sneakers.”
“You have never showed any particular interest in women,” Narcissa said drily. “Nor in the sane.” Draco choked on… nothing, literally nothing, as he had a glass of wine in his hand and had not yet sipped from it. “My first choice is always your happiness. And your first choice is Harry Potter.”
He wondered if he should call someone. A Healer, maybe, just to check him over. Pansy or Blaise, as they’d been so close. Hermione, because she was the smartest person Harry knew. Maybe even Molly, since — and he’d never admit to Draco that it had ever crossed his mind — Draco seemed direly in need of a parental figure of some sort. It seemed very strange, to think that Draco Malfoy was sleeping upstairs in Harry’s guest room and nobody knew. He wondered who was missing him. Perhaps he could find out how to contact the band, though that seemed very risky as well; for all Harry knew, they were Muggles, and if so, they probably had no idea about Draco.
“I couldn’t look at him, Draco. You know, he never once asked us to help. He didn’t. And he planned to go by himself and we said he was an idiot for thinking we wouldn’t follow anyway. And then, in the end… I loved him, I did, but I hated what we went through because we were his friends. And there were days when I hated him for it.”
Harry relaxed. They made breakfast and read the paper. No real news, there never really was, but eventually, Harry found the crossword, and that was enough to stay occupied for a while.
It felt inhumane to leave him like that, even if he did seem to want to be alone, so Harry transfigured a small armchair into a much bigger one that could be stretched out almost flat. He reasoned that Draco had, after all, asked for help.
“I’d always imagined you were raised a proper little prince. That your messy clothes were an affectation.” Harry didn’t reply. “There’s never been a word about anything like that in the
“What will you do with the place?” he asked. But Kingsley was already calling for his assistant to make arrangements.
as if he would fit in at a party of this sort) and congratulated Neville, who had taken to begging Harry to help him practise conversations with Luna Lovegood.
“No, you did,” Harry said, and he had a hand on Draco’s arm before he could think it through. Right over the Dark Mark. He pulled away again, slowly, embarrassed.
“Oh, fuck,” he said. “I think… ‘Mione, I must be misreading this.” He passed her the front page, and his eyes went very wide as he took in the second.
“That’s great, Harry. Really,” Ron said, and Harry suddenly remembered he had papers to mark, and he excused himself, hugging them both before stepping into the Floo.
Harry learned that there was no one way to make a wand. The materials knew what they needed; the hum of this piece of walnut called for dragon heartstring, which would not be coaxed to slither into the bore. The wood needed to be halved, instead, the core carefully stretched until the end of it kissed the tip of the wand, and then the wood needed to be closed again, and made whole, healed gently with warm touch and deep oiling.
Draco took his seat, and reached for a glass of wine, just as a parade of tiny first-year students, shivering from the rain outside, were brought to the front of the room for sorting. He clamped down the flurry of emotions, keeping his face steady, and prepared to clap politely as each child was sent to sit with their new table. He could do this.
“Alright,” Blaise said, after a few moments. They’d of course managed an entire conversation with a glance, and Blaise knew that she wouldn’t be swayed, nor appreciate a fuss. “Welcome back, Potter.” He clapped Harry on the shoulder. “See you soon. Draco? What do they drink in Naples? I think one of my dads was from around here… maybe the fourth or fifth one…”
Blaise closed his eyes, and thought about his studies. The Time Room. The Love Chamber. The Death Room.
Harry had decided that Sirius’s room was the one he wanted for himself and now that it was clean and repaired and the carpet had been replaced, he was glad. Sometimes he felt — or
“Draco,” he murmured, under his breath. He immediately regretted it; what if Draco heard him, and looked up? But the place was much too loud, and Draco was much too absorbed, testing his tuning in the four seconds he had before the singer started shouting incomprehensible lyrics into the microphone, and then he was off again.
He thought he was alone, but when he sank down onto the end of the tiny, thin, lumpy mattress to give himself time to figure things out he realised that Harry Potter, aged perhaps six or seven years old, was sitting at his side.
“There’s a memory Healer Black can’t get to,” Hermione said, pushing her plate aside. The burgers had sounded like a top idea, in the beginning, but now, she was remembering why she didn’t eat them very often. “I need your help, Ron. Something is missing from the list. The timeline.” She pointed gently at it, and didn’t miss the way Ron tore his eyes away from the sight as quickly as he could.
. People said it couldn’t be taught, but it had taken time for Draco to trust it. A different sort of magic. Harmonising with another person’s thoughts, figuring out the best way to reach them. And the fact that this was Harry Potter, whom Draco had hated and adored all through school — through a war that he didn’t think either one of them would ever recover from — didn’t change it. Calling him Potter, using the old names he’d used for his friends, it was all old, ugly habits designed to keep distance between them.
He paused for a long moment. He could sign off, but this letter barely counted as a letter, and his mother would immediately know that he was holding something back.
. He didn’t like to tell her that he was sick of being mobbed, that Glamours had been all that made his work as an Auror manageable. But he didn’t want to take the Glamour off and become the centre of attention, either. He could hear Draco mocking him from somewhere deep in the back of his head — no less brutally for one than the other.
She listened and listened. All these events in Harry’s day, utterly ordinary and completely wonderful. Tea and cake and cats. No horrors, no responsibilities, no one asking him for anything — she felt a pang, thinking of what his life had been like for the last few years.
“That’s about the worst thing I’ve ever heard. Goodness, Harry. You need a hobby.” But he was smiling, with one eyebrow raised crookedly. “Or perhaps you need to get laid? I don’t want to cast aspersions.” He crossed his arms. “Bonsai. Have you heard of that? Strange hobby, but the little trees are interesting, and if you took it up, Neville would probably follow you around making heart eyes at you.”
“Well, I didn’t mean a literal textbook, although you do have a tendency to look a little over-read and dreadfully dog-eared.”
he felt — Sirius’s magic still clinging in places. On top of the dresser a coffee mug with a broken handle held all of the feathers that Buckbeak had left behind. The permanent sticking charms on the Muggle posters didn’t bother Harry one bit; in fact, he had carefully stuck some equally wonky frames around them and quite liked the effect.
Draco woke up in an empty bed. He dragged himself out of it, reluctantly, knowing that Harry would be as skittish as a Cornish pixie. He dressed in neat, dark grey wool trousers, spent a long time considering his shirts and sweaters, and scratched his fingernails over his scalp.
And, there was a knock on the door of his classroom. Harry glanced at his clock, panicking for a moment that he might have slept through to Monday, but no. He crossed the room, and opened the door, and froze.
“Because,” Harry said, “if we did it in Italy, we’d have an entire clan of Weasleys to entertain for a week, in addition to the Minister for Magic and her security entourage, Luna Lovegood and her boyfriends trying to decide what order to do things by the stars, and —”
Ollivander had been skeptical when Harry had begun coaxing stones to settle into the wood; caging themselves at the base of the handle, or snaking their way up the shaft. But when he had seen how it worked, he had smiled at Harry with his eyes horribly bright and kissed his forehead, which was high praise.
Draco wasn’t surprised when he opened his eyes to find himself with Harry looking at him intently. There was a challenge, there; he’d made rather a mess of things several times in a row, and getting it right last time had earned him some good grace, but not much.
Granger let out a sigh of relief, and immediately made as if to leave. “Thank you. I shouldn’t stay, I need to make arrangements.”
Draco smiled, and crossed the sitting room, gesturing at the fireplace to fan the flames before he sat down on the edge of the couch. But he didn’t touch Harry, and he didn’t lean to kiss him, either, and Harry’s entire body ached for it. “How are you?” he asked Harry, and took Harry’s hand.
Harry and Draco stood awkwardly on the landing for a few long moments, after the green flames disappeared. They returned to the kitchen, where Harry packed up leftovers and Draco ran the sink full of water. Harry said nothing about that; he was rubbish as those domestic charms, and besides, he’d never minded doing the dishes. Silently, Draco washed them. Just as silently, Harry dried them. When they were done, and the kitchen was tidy once more, Draco gave Harry a weak smile. It didn’t meet his eyes, but it was a smile.
“We should call Madam Pomfrey,” Harry said, as he hurried across the small space and reached for a curse-box sitting on his shelf.
. It never was. Just some weird extrapolation from school, some redemption-seeking version of me that never existed and never will, appealing to his deplorable sense of justice and goodness. So — so my feelings
“Oh,” Harry said. “Living? I seem to remember that for years, your idea of living was swanning around drunk on the society pages of the Daily Prophet, in and out of people’s beds and flashing your money around. Not something that appeals greatly to me.”
“Don’t worry. I’m still as ambitious, sneaky and self-serving as ever,” Draco had, his voice velvety and mellifluous. Hermione didn’t call him on it. “I think that’s enough for now. You look as if you might need some sleep. Rubino will take you to your quarters. Is Blaise with you?”
When Harry was suitably attired, he carefully pulled the object from Malfoy’s robe pocket, and stared at it. “Where on earth did this come from?”
“This is Lissie,” Draco said. “Lissie, this is my friend Harry. He’s a Professor at Hogwarts, same as me.”
Harry nodded swiftly. “I know. I’ve seen it. I still don’t understand why he thought I needed my room to be so… extravagant,” he said carefully, deliberately avoiding Mrs Malfoy’s look of disappointment. “But it was a kind thing to do.” He cleared his throat. “I think I’ve given the wrong impression, Mrs Malfoy.”
“It’s all true. Well, but can you blame us? Young, fit, no time for a proper social life, or not much of one, anyway.”
— Tom Riddle, someone who had faced off with a troll at the wizened old age of eleven, someone who had flown a broom through Fiendfyre, look so very much like he might throw up in the face of
Draco leaned forward, elbows on his knees, and closed his eyes. His glass dangled from his fingertips. “I feel like you’re encouraging me to ignore my professional ethics. I realise I’m not exactly a model of virtue, but that still sounds very problematic to me.”
Harry opened the door. Most of the gaslights were off, just the one by the picture window illuminated. Draco sat on the wide, padded windowsill with his feet bare, and the old, worn cardigan hanging from his spare frame, arms looped around his knees. He looked like he’d been watching the rain, and Diagon Alley, for a good long time.
“Alright.” He ate the strawberry. Procrastinating, if only for a few seconds. “Do you think that there is any chance that this — this home that Harry has built in his head for the two of us is there because he has feelings for me? Or once did?”
He sat at his drab desk and stared at the broom in the corner and wondered if Draco was right. About some of it, at least.
“She’s not… not having another of those parties, is she?” Harry said, and Draco couldn’t tell if the expression on his face was one of hope or one of horror.
He had no control. His only hope was that Harry’s memory would be followed faithfully and that he would escape with the egg — but Draco had seen this. He had been there. He knew how high Harry had flown to escape the dragon after she had snapped her chain in anger. He had no control, none whatsoever, and it was only when his landing on safe ground once more immediately became a descent into the Black Lake that Harry — Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived, the Saviour, every other fucking name they’d ever given him…
“I can’t believe I didn’t know. I wondered… he only ever brushed those questions away, or… and Dumbledore gave him to them, and…”
Harry laughed, and handed over his second paper bag full of duck food. Blaise looked pleased. He tossed a handful over the ground and smiled as he watched them all waddle across the grass.
“Because you’re better than me.” Draco wanted to spit the words, but they were true, so he said them instead, cradling them on the edge of his lip for as long as he could manage.
As soon as the classroom door closed behind them, Draco collapsed in a heap on the ground, tears streaming from his eyes.
“I’m not sure I’ve ever seen this side of you, Malfoy. Have you lost all of your snark? I think I might be missing it.”
“I sometimes think I’ve seen some of his legs,” she said, surprised and pleased. “I see seahorses a lot, though. They’re so sweet, the way they gallop along in groups, with their green manes flying. And the baby Grindylows, until their parents come to chase them home. And when the weather is warm you sometimes hear the mermaids sing, did you know that?”
“Can you take this to Luna Lovegood in the morning, please?” he asked, offering up a peanut butter cracker, Scamp’s favourite. Scamp gave him an affectionate nip at the base of his thumb, and as soon as the letter was tied to her foot, she was gone. She would fly to Luna’s home, do some hunting along the way and then sleep a couple of hours, delivering the note as soon as Luna woke up.
“Harry sodding Potter, the Gryffindor git, married to Draco even-more-sodding Malfoy, Pureblood Prince of Slytherin. I wouldn’t even believe it if I hadn’t just watched them get their hands all tied together like… oh, no, it wasn’t a sex thing, was it? Ribbon’s not that sturdy —”
Except… well, this was the problem, wasn’t it? For twenty years, when Hermione had asked how he was, he’d always said he was fine, and he’d never been fine. He’d kept his secrets, and protected her from worrying, and protected himself from feeling vulnerable or needing to cheer her up after he’d been honest. And it was bollocks. He never felt burdened when she told him about things being difficult; why would she feel any different?
Grayson and Finn looked up then as well, and agreed in earnest. “We’ll stay here and drink,” they promised Harry and Luna. “But if you fall in, send up red sparks so we know when to have a good laugh.”
It wasn’t obvious and it wasn’t easy and it required interpretation. Was the base water, or distilled water, or the water of life? Was it a mercurial base? Dry ether or one of the precious oils? You needed to be able to read the colours and the thrumming and all the rest of it, or you’d get it wrong, and you might kill someone, and Draco had so many fucking regrets in his life that a mistake made when someone was already vulnerable was an impossible risk.
He closed his eyes. Happy. Alright, that couldn’t be hard. He was happy at the Burrow, with his chosen family. He was happy flying, but he knew he didn’t want to play Quidditch professionally; he watched Ginny bask in the spotlight and only knew he needed a much quieter place to shine. Where was he happy?
“You’re still a bit of a prat sometimes, Draco,” Neville said calmly, not looking up from his porridge. And there it was.
“Oh, hello, Persephone,” he said, as Hermione’s owl dropped a newspaper in his hands and flew into the room, perching happily on the foot of his bed and waiting expectantly. “Do I want to read this?” he asked the owl, balefully, and Persephone gave a soft hoot before flying down the stairs and into the kitchen. Draco stepped into his slippers, less for warmth and more because there was sometimes a splinter or two to be found on his floorboards and he hated having to dig them out.
Harry tried to take him aside after breakfast, several days later, but Draco jovially explained that he was Very Busy. Apparently he was Very Busy every day. Not too busy for Duelling Club, which was nice; but he was cheerful in a way that never reached his eyes, and never gleeful, never tossing an insult or showing off for the students.
Harry froze, preparing a passionate defence of his motivations, but he shook his head, instead. “Alright,” he said with a laugh. Draco’s mockery didn’t even sound like mockery. “What do you propose?”
“And you have an enormous head, Harry. I know people inflate it for you quite a lot, but there’s just no excuse.”
“Getting soft in your advanced age, Malfoy,” came a voice at his elbow. Draco smirked, and his eyes flashed to Potter’s. He looked significantly better. Of course, without the shadows beneath them to distract Malfoy, those eyes were once again a bit of a problem.
His companion, who was already hooked, shrugged. “Post-post-pop punk, really, but they have a pretty high opinion of themselves and call it something else — I don’t know.”
Harry shook his head. “I’ve asked people to be respectful of my workplace. There’s still a few wankers around the place, but mostly, people do the right thing. It’s about the time we’ll start seeing first years coming in, though, buying their first wand.”
“Perhaps.” Hermione took the map from Harry, and then the rest of the papers, flicking through them. “But if he really has changed his mind… if he really is sorry, and Harry, I believed him, when he apologised. I did. Would you want to keep anything that reminded you of…”
Dinner was exactly the raucous affair that Hermione had anticipated. She hadn’t yet told Ron that she was engaged to Blaise, and as nervous as Ron still seemed to be around him, he managed a very enthusiastic handshake, an equally enthusiastic hug (to Blaise’s horror and Hermione’s delight) and an assurance that he was well up to the task of arranging a Bachelor’s party. And then a long, awkward moment where Ron apparently remembered that it was generally the job of the best man, and that he didn’t have a clue who Blaise’s friends were; and then, thank goodness, Gabrielle being her usual delightful self, easing everyone into a slightly turned-on stupor for just long enough so that they were abe to gather their wits again.
Ron didn’t know how to respond to that, so he just followed Topher to the kitchen, where he was opening all the cupboards and drawers.
They were greeted by Rubino, who took another opportunity to practice his English with them, but this time didn’t take their coats. Perhaps because they were lighter; the weather was warm, as could be expected in this part of Italy in the late Spring, and anyway, Hermione was glad not to have to feel guilty about the wizened elf working for them.
Molly had been the closest thing Harry had to a mother in his entire sodding life, and he didn’t know how to tell her that he would be spending time at Malfoy Manor the following day.
“Hullo, Henny,” he said. “Can you please see that these are destroyed? Don’t let anyone eat them. Thank you. I’ll bring you another scarf next time I visit Hermione.”
“Charlie’s coming for Christmas,” Ron said with enthusiasm, and Harry and Hermione laughed at him. Hermione poured Harry another Firewhiskey, and they sat quietly for a while.
Merlin’s beard, it was disgusting stuff. Harry thought for a second that he’d been tricked. Draco had, in fact, poisoned him. His only comfort was in knowing that he would die, and become a ghost, and haunt the git forever. The fantasy only intensified for the thirty seconds that his pain, nausea, and regret intensified; and then —
“Ideal,” she said, looking satisfied. She hugged Harry tightly, and to Harry’s shock (and evidently Draco’s as well) she hugged Draco, too. He stiffened for a moment, but returned the embrace cordially when he had recovered his equilibrium.
He took a deep breath. Fear came, and it had something to tell him; but he acknowledged it, and thanked it, and sent it on its way. He stood for several minutes by the window, bathed in sunbeams, breathing from his diaphragm until he was solely focused on the sensation of oxygen flooding his bloodstream. He opened his eyes when he heard Persephone fussing, waiting for a snack.
“Well, have you thought about taking a different approach? Dating, perhaps? I know Blaise likes you —”
Harry took a long shower, trying to keep away the feeling of doom. He made himself a cup of tea, and checked the guest room in case Draco had struggled to fall asleep with Harry wrapped around him like an octopus. Maybe he had left. With his magic back, maybe he’d disguised himself, and he’d be back with chocolate croissants and proper coffee any minute.
At eleven o’clock, Pansy came in with a promising-looking brown paper bag, and a less-promising glare.
“Thank you for coming,” he said, and his voice was tight and reedy as if he was barely keeping himself upright. Perhaps he was.
“Minister,” Parvati said, turning as the door closed, ready and waiting for the gourmet fiends just waiting for the opportunity to attack. Hermione tried to tamp down the irritation. It really wasn’t anyone’s fault that she was in a funny mood. Lots going on. An engagement she couldn’t announce until after Blaise had resigned from his post, a best friend emerging from his coma, another still pretending that everything was right with the world;
He sat up, a few minutes later, when his breathing had returned to normal, and he dropped into the armchair by Harry’s bedside. Harry, of course, hadn’t moved. Not a twitch. Nothing but the rapid movement of his eyes under those pale lids, shot through with pale blue veins. He reached for Harry’s hand, and held it, gently running his thumb over the inside of Harry’s wrist.
“You know,“ Draco said, when he could speak again, when the lump in his throat was gone and he could breathe, and see. “I only ever wanted him to see me. I wanted to be his friend. I wanted us to… have secrets, perhaps, to whisper late at night. I wanted to kiss him. I wanted him to want me. And now I’ve had this ridiculous charade for months… this imaginary version of myself conjured from nothing, and I don’t even know why but I still fucking want it. It’s pathetic. I’m pathetic. And I hope he leaves before I can get any more pathetic.”
Mrs Anand waited a moment. She had heard the third possibility in Harry’s inflection. She tipped her head slightly. “Or?”
Draco’s eyes flew open in shock as he read the first three or four paragraphs, twice, three times, trying to figure out if he was making the entire mess up in his head. Still asleep, perhaps. Dreaming. But according to the front page of the Daily Prophet, Harry Potter had, in full view of most senior ministry officials and of course his best friend the Minister for Magic, resigned from his job after almost 20 years of maintaining his position in the front line of the war against Dark Wizards, the potions and drugs trade, corruption, and probably lost kneazle kittens because he was so appallingly wholesome. Two nights ago; it had to have happened after yesterday’s
of yours, who by the way sounds very, very handsome. If you confessed this gross violation of his privacy. Assuming he didn’t toss you out on your arse, of course.”
Mostly, Harry seemed delighted to have his Goddaughters back. They told a series of ridiculous stories, each tale taller than the last, while everyone ate takeaway Muggle Thai food (everyone present could cook, Harry being the best of them, but no one had seemed to have the time or inclination and Harry still looked incredibly tired. And when had he last cooked?).
“He woke me at six o’clock this morning. Said he didn’t want to leave again without saying goodbye. I thought we were friends, Potter.”
about teaching the children. But it really didn’t matter. It was fucking fantastic, and fun; Harry suddenly wavering terribly with a jelly-legs jinx, and then repelling a bat-bogey hex back at Draco, resulting in the students rolling on the floor with laughter.
“Oh,” Harry said, almost having forgotten. “I also wanted to show you something.” He drew the tiny, twisted wand from his pocket and passed it over. “Very crude, of course, I…”
The first few days of the rest of Harry’s life were blissfully structureless. That didn’t actually mean they were easy; in fact, Harry was starting to think that the guilt about not working, not being out
“I’m an Auror, Draco,” he said, with a sigh. “Trying to sneak up on me is rather like trying to teach a fire crab to sing. It won’t work, and you’ll annoy the fire crab.”
“Slytherin, are you?” Draco said, conspiratorially. She smiled. “Go on, then. I need a little colour.”
Harry had also bought a package of an interesting-looking tea as a get-well gift for Ollivander, and he offered it to the old man now.
He was itching to wake Draco up and ask what was happening. He didn’t, for the same reason he hadn’t the night before. Harry was reasonably sure Draco would vanish without a trace if he felt harassed, and then he’d never know what this — all of this — had been about.
When he woke the next morning, Harry was instantly tense. Noises in the house. Not the cat. In soft grey sleep pants and not another stitch, his glasses askew on his face and his wand in hand (offensive spells he could easily cast wandlessly; defensive spells, for some reason, were still easier with a wand), Harry opened his bedroom door.
“You feel so good,” Harry murmured, and pressed his lips to Draco’s, shifting to his neck. He tasted clean sweat and skin, arousal, he smelled herb tea and something a little citric, orange hair potions maybe, a rich patina of scents and tastes that Harry planned to map.
Draco had long since learned that if you wanted someone to say something they didn’t want to, the best way to ensure it happened was to give them enough time so that they had to fill the silence with sound. To that end, he took a few more notes, and then waited patiently.
“I haven’t aggravated Minister Shacklebolt nearly enough, this year, Mr Potter. Say no more.” She sat quietly for a moment, after writing herself a note. “Tell me, Mr Potter — have you given any thought to what you might do next? After graduation?”
“He doesn’t need your apologies. He’ll just be glad to have you back.” Hermione stood as well. “But go ahead and invite him. I’ll have Blaise make arrangements for the food.”
Harry looked over the map in his hands. “Instructions on how to bring the wards down. But why… this doesn’t make any sense,” Harry said, shaking his head.
He was ready to do this. He was. But if anyone in the history of Big Decisions ever claimed not to have had a single moment’s pause, they were lying. Being unsure was what made those decisions big.
Harry deflated, somewhat, and looked about to say something else when the morning owls flew through the windows, dropping letters and parcels everywhere. Draco caught a package with his own name on it, and passed it to Harry, who was still dutifully checking all of his parcels, and any latter addressed in an unfamiliar hand. Harry passed him back a letter with the Malfoy seal on the back.
bothered Draco all day. For dozens of reasons. The first and in his mind the most irksome was that the entire concept of love potions seemed like a grotesque violation. No different to… to holding someone down. He also had to admit to himself that he didn’t like the thought of anyone sniffing after Harry that way. It was pretty pathetic, and also, it was Draco’s job.
“I have to go,” Draco said. “Walk around. See if there’s anything I might have missed. Or rather, anything Harry might have. A hidden passageway, a concealed trap-door. A sodding wardrobe.”
“Well, half-Kneazle. We think. From Hermione’s old cat Crookshanks. I just wanted to see if I… are you alright, Mr Ollivander?”
“Same thing that happened this morning. But usually, long before I see it. You’re not going to turn this into some kind of thing, are you?”
Harry felt that he should have been annoyed at the way Draco simply smoothed over what amounted to ten years of misery by being flippant but the truth was, he enjoyed it. Draco had no reverence for anything, and it was refreshing. Also, he was already making himself at home, pouring wine. Harry liked it more than he should have. He’d been so absorbed by his thinking that he’d let the fire dwindle, but he waved vaguely in the direction of the fireplace and the flames grew quickly.
“Blaise Zabini and Hermione Granger,” Draco mused, as he took his seat and reached for his tea. “I wouldn’t have believed it, but you do seem to be remarkably well matched.”
“He’s never liked feeling like he got anything he didn’t earn.” She fiddled with a quill on her desk. “We thought he’d want to get his NEWTs.”
When Harry closed the shop on Christmas Eve he stood outside in the magic snow with a mug of hot chocolate held between gloved hands to watch the lights twinkle for a few minutes, and to breathe the cool air. He’d lived with a lot of sadness in his life. He knew how to handle that. He and disappointment were old friends, and most of the time, he knew how to keep his expectations low.
“Alright,” Harry said, as he found his legs again. He was barely aware that Draco was holding him up, and laughing. “Find a partner, find a mat — and focus on jinxes and defences. We’ll move around the room and offer some help.”
Draco stared at the tray for a few more moments. “Maybe you could refresh the warming charms,” he said, quietly. Seemed very strange for him not to do it himself, but Harry wasn’t going to poke at him about it. He just did it.
that it makes me want to tear tongues from heads. But it happened, Harry. It happened, twenty-five years ao, and you survived. And hiding it behind a curtain or a door, or tossing it in the cellar or the attic, none of those things can stop it from ever having happened. Do you hear me?”
After dinner, as Ron pressed a hand to his stomach and told Hermione that he was thinking about marrying Harry instead of her, Harry poured them each a second glass of wine.
was there, he’d be demanding, and rude, and affectionate, and he’d make cutting comments about how I poached my eggs, and talk me out of my robes, and make me laugh and argue with him… and I was there, in my office, half asleep and there was a sound and I… I knew I couldn’t do it. I didn’t even care what case it was. I only knew they were going to ask me to help with it and that I couldn’t. And I didn’t want to.”
under his breath. He didn’t miss the way Draco closed his eyes. He probably wasn’t upset that the mug was fixed. It had to be the mirror. Harry took a blanket from the closet and covered it up, using a sticking charm to make sure it stayed that way. He picked up the mug, and vanished the spilled coffee before it could mark the floorboards.
“Does it hurt?” Potter asked, and Draco didn’t feign ignorance. He turned his forearm to look at the Mark, blurred and scarred, the musculature beneath warped and twisted — his left hand hadn’t been quite the same since. Sometimes it didn’t cooperate the way it used to, his thumb failing to curl quickly enough or a sharp pain would make his fingers spasm suddenly.
“So fucking beautiful,” Harry said. “I don’t care why you showed up here that night. I’m just glad you’re here. Stay with me, Draco. Will you?”
He didn’t need to. It was awful, the way people fawned over him, barely letting him answer a question before asking another. The young woman to his right grabbed his thigh and whispered to him that she’d been thinking of getting a tattoo of his name on her —…
“If this was nothing more than a plan to sneak back into my bed so you could steal a wand, it was a very stupid plan. You could’ve nicked one when you left the first time, saved yourself the trouble of coming back.”
“No.” Harry huffed a laugh. “I did it to myself. I’m sorry, Pans. I really have to go and rest. You should take those with you; I don’t think I could eat a bite anyway.”
So Potter had expected him to make some sort of a scene? Perhaps he’d been waiting for Draco to hit him with a jelly-legs jinx, or another of the old classics.
“It is cracked,” he said. “Severed in the centre. I’m afraid it does happen, with heirloom wands. I could repair it…”
“Sneakers. For sneaking, presumably? How Slytherin of you. I must say, Potter, I know for a fact that you’re at
It took less than half an hour in the library to find the recipe and instructions. Tomorrow night, he told himself, he’d get this sorted right out.
Draco heard a burst of nervous laughter outside the cupboard, and frowned. He climbed to his feet, and in the spirit of experimentation stepped out of the cupboard, through the closed door. But it didn’t lead his back to the landing; he was in a hideously decorated house. At a kitchen table sat a little boy — well. Young, anyway — a tall, highly-strung woman with a hairstyle that looked like it might have been set in concrete and an immensely large man who had a napkin tucked into the top of his shirt.
And then, because he was selfish, and because hope had stayed, and because Draco had no idea how long it would be before he knew what might happen next, he kissed Harry’s forehead, before leaving him to rest and closing the door silently behind him.
It was strange. The last time they’d seen each other was at Narcissa’s funeral and though Harry hadn’t thought they’d been exactly warm with each other, they had been passably civil.
“Actually, I won’t. You don’t know my mum, do you, Harry?” He didn’t, except by reputation. “There’s a very good chance you’d end up my next stepfather.”
It was barely satisfying, lasting only a couple of minutes, and afterwards, despite the relief — Harry felt sad.
Mrs Malfoy’s voice was gentle, and too kind and inquisitive by half. Harry swallowed a lump in his throat. What was he supposed to say? That he didn’t want to put Mrs Malfoy out, that he wasn’t sure he really deserved a slice of lemon? That taking up as little space as he could manage was the only way he was able to cope with the way his existence tended to take up far too much space in the world? How ridiculous.
“It’s beautiful,” Draco said, awed. He gave a little wave, and sparks filled the air. “It feels so different.”
Draco didn’t know when he started to notice the tears burning his cheeks, but burn they did. Still Harry didn’t wake up. As odd as it seemed that someone might need to sleep off a five-month nap, it made a sort of sense, too. Draco was content to watch.
“You need to,” he said. “Because I’m missing something, and I don’t know what it is.” Hermione shivered, crossing her arms over her chest. Draco cast a warming charm, seemingly without really noticing. He probably hadn’t; just making sure they could do what needed to be done. Immensely practical. But then, in many ways, he’d always been that way.
Molly sighed, and turned to Harry, wrapping her arms around him. “Of course, Harry, dear. And you always will be. I just need a minute to adjust. I thought I’d have you for a son-in-law, you know. But you have to do what makes you happy. You know that’s all I’ve ever wanted for you.” She kissed the side of his head, and suddenly he felt like he was twelve years old again, when he’d craved this sort of affection and didn’t know how to accept it.
Knowing, or at least believing, that his life would be cut short at seventeen years old, when he’d scarcely had a chance to live.
“It’s not safe in there!” Harry shouted, but his voice was as thick and slow and useless as his feet. He heard the click of the door opening, the terrible hiss of the basilisk, and then Draco’s screams. “Draco! No!”
Malfoy stopped as the circle opened to include him, but didn’t step any closer. He didn’t look well. How could he, though, with everything that had happened?
“I’m tired,” Harry said, and he rested his forehead on Draco’s shoulder. “That’s why I sleep so much. Isn’t that okay? You told me. You said I needed to take better care of myself.”
A deathly silence had come over the shop, the house, and possibly all of Diagon Alley. Harry sighed, and closed his eyes, and climbed the stairs with Hermione trailing behind him.
Harry had never really thought about it like that. He filled the teapot with hot water. “Yes,” he said. “I love my life. It’s nothing like I’d ever imagined… not when I was a hungry kid sleeping under the stairs, not when I was at school…” His eyes closed for a moment, breathing it in. “Sometimes I think all of this is a dream, and it’ll go away again, and I’ll be back in the Forbidden Forest, dead under the trees, under the stars. And other times, I think it must be real. After everything that’s happened… I feel I’ve earned this peace.”
Draco nodded indulgently. He couldn’t deny that he was pleased. He knew it wasn’t as easy as all of that, but it sounded at least like Harry was trying to reclaim his life, and that was a start.
Draco shushed her gently. “Not if you’re careful, Miss Hubbard. You need to add the lacewings one at a time and stir widdershins after each wing. Just once.” He glanced around the rest of the classroom, and everyone else seemed to be getting along, so he turned his attention back to Amelia.
“Of course you are, darling.” Narcissa tightened her cloak against the cold air. “Don’t worry about a thing; I have everything planned out. I’ll see you on Wednesday,” she finished, and disapparated with a loud
Harry’s hair curled at the nape of his neck, thick and dark, but his eyes tightened into crows’ feet in the corners and his mouth was set in a tight line.
He hadn’t changed a bit. Harry felt the old anger flash. “Funny — when the rest of us grew up, I thought you might have, too. Guess not.”
“He’s entirely wrong for you. You are very high maintenance, darling Draco, and so is Mr… Zabini, is it?”
It seemed so strange now to remember that they had barely shared a single word in six years at school. He loved her. In a way he had never imagined he could love anyone. Every aspect of Hermione was wonderful, to Blaise; her confidence and her uncertainty, her power and her vulnerability, her extraordinary intelligence and her boundless curiosity. She seemed to remember everything she had ever read or heard, but remained skeptical of everything until she had some kind of corroboration or proof. She could command a room or his lap with equal gravitas.
The flash of irritation would once have set off Harry’s temper, but now, he was embarrassed. And frankly, desirous. If they were inside his head he might have sidled up closer and apologised with a kiss, with fingers pressed against Draco’s skin but here, he couldn’t. This was real. Draco should never have had to do what he did.
“My father loved me,” Draco reminded her bluntly. “That didn’t make him any less of a bastard, in the end, did it? Yes, Dumbledore was thinking of the whole world instead of just Harry, and perhaps he didn’t even have a choice. It’s not one I think I could ever trust myself to make. But when in his life has anyone put Harry first? Ever? He doesn’t even do that for himself, the sodding Gryffindor git.”
The armchair at Harry’s side was feeling far too much like home, Hermione thought. It had gradually, over the last six weeks, become accustomed to her precise way of sitting, the way she tended to hold a book open on one arm, and as a result it looked very strange when she wasn’t sitting in it. And it wasn’t comfortable for anyone else, either. In fact, it had developed such a high opinion of itself that Hermione had heard more than one person confide that they thought it had kicked them, right in the seat of their pants, when they attempted to requisition it for a short visit.
“I’m always nice,” Harry growled into his pint, as if he was blaming it very specifically for all the ills of the day, and hoping it would shrivel and die. Moments later, their colleagues were sat at the table with them, celebrating the end of another week and the absence of students in the pub.
Ron’s mouth flew open. “Me, too. I think I like being busy, that suits me. D’you know what Auror O’Toole said, he said —”
“Because going to Draco is the next big adventure. And I need to be the best version of myself if I’m to get there in the shape that he deserves. He can’t be my Healer anymore, Hermione.”
“Nah, he’s a show pony. Taking all the fancy risks, stepping in to save the day last minute — my brother went to school with him, and I heard he was a right wanker. Always showing off one way or another.”
Harry blanched, and Draco cringed inwardly. No doubt a mistake like that would not have been tolerated too well by Harry’s Muggle family. He regretted his tone. A lazy wave of his wand set the tea service to brewing, and Draco focused on his sandwiches again.
All the energy seemed to go out of them at the same time. Harry was almost relieved not to have to hear what Draco might have said, had he gone on. They sat in a silence that began tense and settled into companionable over time.
Ginny dropped onto the couch by Draco. “And I’ll drag all the gossip out of this one while you do it.”
“In a minute I’m going to tell you to fuck me, and if you want it to last for longer than thirty seconds, then yes, I’d sugg… Potter. Potter!”
“You don’t have your wand?” he asked, gently. Draco shook his head. He looked like he tried to sneer, as well, but failed. “I could bring you one. Or you could come down and pick one out.”
Harry sat in the dim workroom for another half an hour, listening to the rain, and basking in the peace of his new life. And then, as he often did when he had the time and space to wonder, he thought about Draco Malfoy, and wondered where he was.
“Glad it’s temporary,” she said, conjuring her own meal, still prepared by the elves but completely vegan. It looked good, actually. “I don’t like the House system. We abolishe it years ago at Beauxbatons.”
, Blaise. I intend to write up his case notes for his next Healer because I know that one day very soon I will return to my house after work or I’ll wake up in the morning and there will be a painfully polite note left thanking me for my hospitality and ensuring I know where to send my bill. And I’ll never lay eyes on him again.”
“Right now, I will only say this: Defensive and Offensive actions are not a sum game. This is a chance for you all to figure out what you are good at. And Dra — Professor Malfoy and I will demonstrate first. Professor?”
Harry stared, and turned the letter over, and handed it back to Malfoy, who read it with a frown and then (if it was possible) paled slightly.
“Can’t have that. I remember the squeaky little voice you had in First Year. No one wants to hear that again.”
After lunch they returned to their duties. Amorous older students were paired off in various combinations in various dark corners. Harry felt terrible; Draco must have agreed.
As if on cue, Dora leapt up onto the table. She looked very interested in the sauce that Harry was stirring, and her coat changed to match it. Creamy mushroom with cracked pepper. “You’re a delight, do you know that?” he asked her, fondly, and she preened. And then to Hermione, he said “I dream about lovely normal garbage that makes no sense and I usually can’t remember more than a snatch of it in the morning.”
“What happened?” Ron asked, incredulous. “She was in good shape for a, for a — well, she didn’t look like she was going to keel over and die. And they were on house arrest, being waited on hand and foot by the elves, right? Not like she…”
When she emerged from the room a while later, Draco was sitting at his desk, writing notes in a journal in his beautiful script. He gave her a small smile.
“Oh, I… Harry. I can’t — oh, this wretched bump! Help me, would you?” Hermione was trying to climb through the window, gravid and lovely, and Harry avoided making a crass comment about how the roof may not hold her. He only laughed, as he helped her settle.
“Hold your arms out,” Harry replied, refusing to rise to the bait. “They do look better. Just lay them comfortably and I’ll give them another pass. You should be right as rain in the morning. If you can avoid grumbling, and relax.”
Up close, Harry could see that Draco was wearing heavy eye makeup, and that he had sweated a lot of it off. Made him look like someone had swung by to corrupt his innocence or something, but Harry wasn’t sure that Draco had ever been allowed to have much of that. His eyes blazed. His skin was paler than ever, unless that was a trick of the light.
“He learned about prejudice,” Harry murmured to Andromeda as Draco fastened coats around himself and Teddy both. “I’m proud.”
They stayed exactly like that for several minutes, just breathing, enjoying the closeness, until Harry’s softening cock slipped from Draco’s body, and Draco started complaining about mess. In truth Harry would have been happy to lie in their filth for a while, but Draco looked like he was getting ready to fret loudly, and Harry thought it might be better to just head him off at the pass. A wandless, soundless
“You just wait until I’ve had some sleep. I owe you more loaded banter than I can properly calculate right now.”
“D’you know anything about the case he was supposed to get pulled into the day they found him up here?”
problems. This commitment to the old Pureblood ideals! Completely ridiculous. The Pureblood family trees look more like shrubs. Like spiderwebs. It’s very fortunate we’ve not started seeing generations of children with extra toes or tails. And by the time dear Lucius saw that I was right…”
He took Hermione into his arms and danced her around the kitchen. Poorly, but with a great deal of enthusiasm and more energy than he’d had the day before. He’d soaked up all the sunshine and it was converting to peace, under his skin.
“I got a variety,” Harry said, waving at the ridiculous spread. “I never know what I’m going to want until it’s in front of me.” He sat on the floor with his back against the couch and reached for a pakora, dipping it in a spicy raita. He looked at the television rather than Draco. Draco was too easy to look at and the TV was a rotten distraction, but he made a valiant attempt.
It was remarkably easy, Harry reflected, as he finally found his seat (mercifully he was next to Hermione, and had Parvati on his other side) to deflect all the thousands of questions that had been aimed at him as he had mingled in the entry, where drinks and canapés were served and the press swarmed like bats. He hated knowing that there would be photographs of him in every Wizarding publication in Europe and possibly the world the following day, but he had a strange sense of ease, as well. No one would really be expecting the events of this night.
“Penelope,” he said, with a broad smile. He was in the day room, taking a seat beside a young woman who had been brought into the hospital the day before New Year’s. Almost three months, now. She gave him a weak smile; she had only begun talking a month ago, and her conversation was still scattered and difficult to follow. “How are you feeling today?”
The entire potion seemed to hold its breath, and then it shuddered, turning a bright jewel purple. Draco took it off the heat. Potter looked relieved.
When the sorting was done and the tables began to groan under the weight of the platters which had suddenly appeared, Draco turned to Neville, on his left, to enquire about his summer. He was singularly pleased when he felt a prickle of surprise from his right; but if Potter hadn’t paid enough attention at school to understand the importance of the relationship between the Herbology Master and the Potions Master, he was likely to be decidedly more discomfited by the expected partnership between the Potions Master and the Defence Against the Dark Arts Instructor.
With that, Draco closed the Floo, warded his door, and made his way to Harry’s room. He took a very long time preparing. He used almost half a tub of potion on Harry’s skin, beginning with his feet, moving up his legs, spending extra time on the scars that were tightening over the weeks and months. His stomach, his chest. Again, the scars, working the potion in to soften them.
“I never sneezed at them,” Harry agreed. “My Aunt Petunia was very enthusiastic about Christmas as well, though in her case, I was always the house-elf.”
“Finished. I’ll bring you one when I receive my brag copies,” she promised. She handed over a long wooden case. “I’m here because of this. It’s not my wand, but it has been passed down for several generations, and it is used in certain private, traditional rituals,” she said. Not her usual cheerful self. Harry opened the box, and immediately felt the problem. He lifted it and placed it on a stand.
“I forgot how… he has a lot of scars,” she said quietly. “I suppose these days I don’t see him without a shirt on all that often.”
. Blaise wasn’t sure that his own mother had ever been happy. As dedicated as she was to hedonism, she had never been happy, and Blaise hadn’t been happy until he turned away from all of that.
“There’s something I need to tell you,” Draco said, when he was done. Sitting by Harry’s side on the freshly transfigured bed, wide enough once more for the two of them. His face burned. His voice was weak. “You’re not alone in this. I wanted you so desperately at school. I didn’t even know where to put that much need, and I… I’m like a cat, in a lot of ways, I suppose. I scratch when I want to be petted. And the more you hated me the worse I scratched. I didn’t know how else to be, with you. That day in Madame Malkins’ — I decided that you would be my best friend, and then you rejected me. I don’t blame you, of course, fuck, I wanted to be all impressive and imposing and instead I was a little gobshite. But I wanted you. And I still do.” He rubbed his forehead. “Merlin, I don’t know if I hope you remember this or I hope you don’t.”
He angled his head up for a kiss, and Draco gave him one. Strong and biting and utterly determined. “So you love me enough to die,” he said.
The day after Harry’s birthday (which had been a very quiet affair indeed, the occasion marked by a handful of extra tears but also one of Molly’s carrot cakes) Hermione opened the kitchen window for an owl, and accepted a copy of the Daily Prophet. By the time she found Ron and Harry, she was white as a sheet.
Draco hesitated, and shook his head. And then nodded, and then shook his head again. He drew two rolls of parchment from the pocket of his robes.
“Alright. Give me a wandless summoning?” A moment later, a mug flew across the room and into Harry’s hand; good speed, zero splash. “Show-off,” she said, taking the mug and sipping her coffee. “Disillusionment? Alright — apparate outside my door, and then inside again. No. Apparate outside near the trees and bring me something back.”
“I’m missing something,” he said. “I don’t know what it is. I’m missing something, and it’s huge, and important, and I — I can’t figure it… there’s something I don’t know. I’ve tried pushing deeper. I’ve tried legilimency —”
In the late afternoon Draco resolved that if Harry didn’t wake soon, Draco would wake him. At least to see that he could stand on his own, and walk, and to find out how much he remembered. To eat, and to have a cup of tea, the almighty British healer of all things. But fretting, he kept putting it off, until a shuffling step and a click of the door startled him, and Draco turned around.
His hand was beginning to blister. The colour of the blisters was very worrying. And he was in too much pain to try to sort through it all in his head.
Harry regarded the little girl. She was small, smaller than any of the girls who had come into the shop so far that day and most of the boys as well. She looked a lot like Pansy, without the bitter edges.
“I look forward to seeing you again, Harry,” Narcissa said, as Draco helped her into her coat. Harry was too lost looking around his room to help, but Narcissa didn’t look offended. Only pleased with herself, and sly.
Harry woke up feeling as though a centaur had shat in his head. He lay in bed, utterly morose, until he remembered the little bottle. He had, conveniently enough, fallen asleep in his robes, so he shifted around until he found exactly which pocket was poking him in the hip, and he downed the potion in one go.
Draco made himself a cup of jasmine green tea, inhaling the earthy aromas as he studiously ignored the front page of the Prophet. It was folded into quarters but Draco could see familiarly untidy black hair waving in the top centimetre of whatever photograph of Harry Potter was on the front page.
“Yes, I do. But I have you. I rest. We take holidays together, Blaise, and not to a dragon sanctuary in Romania. Harry doesn’t have a home — have you ever really thought about that?”
“Er,” Harry said, and then Hermione was pulling away and taking off her gloves. Ron shook his hand. Upstairs it felt as if the entire house had taken a deep breath and didn’t intend to let it go. “I was going to meet you at the Burrow,” Harry said. This would be it. If Draco heard these two he’d definitely climb out a window and run away and Harry would never find out what had happened.
Harry laughed quietly. “I’d like to see him try. I’m an Auror, you know, a rather good one, and he has the upper body strength of a Cornish Pixie.”
