“Have you been here the whole time?” Harry couldn’t help but ask.
Harry and Draco were huddled into a rather small alcove, created by a rocky outcropping in the tunnel. Draco ripped off a large portion of his cloak and pressed the fabric against the deep gash in Harry’s shoulder. He winced at Harry’s grunt of pain. “I’m sorry, Harry,” he whispered, “so sorry I forced you to come here.”
“Fine,” Harry gave in grudgingly, “you can cast first and I’ll copy some of the symbols, but then we can switch.  I’m not getting stuck copying down all of the symbols.”  Harry looked around where some of his classmates had already successfully cast and each object had quite a large number of symbols surrounding it.
“What… what sacrifice?” Draco asked with dread.
Harry’s heart pounded in his chest.  His moved his hands to Malfoy’s waist to steady himself.  What had they been talking about?  Hadn’t Malfoy said something about wanting something?  “What did you want, Draco?” Harry’s voice came out as a strangled whisper.
At Ron’s words, Harry’s arms tightened reflexively around Draco who stiffened in his embrace.  “Draco . . . I . . .” Harry began.
Draco had an affronted look at the Healer’s use of his first name, “Obviously I have missed something important.  And why the fuck are you still here, Potter?”  Draco glared at Harry, “Did you have something to do with this?  Is that why you’re here?  You’re feeling guilty?  Not content to just flay me open and have me bleed to death . . .” Draco rubbed one hand across his chest.
“Shhhh!” Malfoy shushed him.  “We need to be quiet.”  Harry’s head spun as they went down the hall and into his old room, but he kept his mouth shut.  “Now . . . Blaise always keeps a well-stocked stash.”  He walked over to Blaise’s trunk and spelled it open.  Malfoy rummaged around and came up with a very large bottle of Firewhisky.  “Aha!” He held it up triumphantly.  Then he promptly dragged Harry back down to their room.
Once all was in readiness, with shaking hands he withdrew the parchment from his pocket and unfolded it. He read through the words silently until he was confident he wouldn’t stumble during the spell.
The house elf was arranged for with surprisingly little fuss.  His assistant had known just who to contact, and it was all arranged that their new house elf, Hilly, would arrive tomorrow morning.  She would be paid, have two days off a week, with paid vacation and sick leave.  Even Hermione could find no fault with this arrangement.
Harry must have asked him a question, and Neville must have answered but Harry didn’t remember any of that.  All of a sudden Neville shocked Harry back into awareness. “Draco, truth or dare?”
“Keep your wand out,” Potter directed, dropping Draco’s hand and holding his own wand in one hand and the talisman in the other. He headed resolutely down a passageway and Draco followed closely.
“No!  No, you didn’t,” Draco pushed both his hands through his hair and then dropped his head, “Fuck this is hard to explain.”  He pulled his knees up and then crossed his arms over his knees and rested his forehead on his arms.  Harry stayed quiet, waiting.  “I don’t remember anything about sex,” Draco’s voice was so low Harry strained to hear it.  “About having sex, I mean.” Draco paused, lifting his head a risking a look over in Harry’s direction.  “Don’t laugh, but it’s like I’m a virgin.  Ridiculous isn’t it”
“I’ll cast first,” Malfoy said.  “You can copy down the symbols so that we will be able to decipher them.”
“Forever,” Harry affirmed.
Harry laughed back and rummaged in the basket next to him, “Well I have a sandwich or a biscuit?  Or you could have a kiss?”  The laughter fell away and Harry held his breath while he waited for Draco’s answer.  He looked at Draco, whose eyes were flicking from Harry’s mouth to his eyes and back again.
The one guaranteed daily contact he did have with Draco was thanks to Hilly.  On her first day with them, she insisted on setting the dining room table formally for dinner.  After she had gone to so much trouble, neither man had the heart to disappoint her so they sat down to eat together.  They had continued this every day, surprisingly even on her days off.  Some days all that kept Harry going was the thought that he would have Draco to himself for that hour at dinner.  Their conversations we casual and superficial, but it was better than the rest of the day when Draco avoided Harry.
Malfoy is wearing the red clogs again, with denim culottes and a blue poet sleeve blouse tied in the middle of his torso. He has a silk scarf tied around his neck. Harry wants to touch all of his skin, what is visible and what is under those delicate vintage pieces. He can’t stop imagining pulling the ends of the little scarf to him, to bring him close up over the table and put his lips over Malfoy’s sweet nose.
“Wow, it’s lovely,” Harry says. Malfoy scoffs.
And Draco understands, then, why people fuck and fall in love in wartime. He knows why, now, babies are born and weddings are left and right. He wants to kiss Harry every waking moment. Suddenly he can see himself dying a million different ways, because Harry fucks into him like it’s going to be the last time every time, and every time Draco comes as if he will never come again. It is terrifying and it is all Draco has ever wanted. His gut unwinds despite the risk factor rising. The more he has to lose the better he feels about his own mortality. The house settles around them.
“So lovely, Ron, of them to be married. Don’t you think?”
It’s something they haven’t done together yet, and it surprises Harry how Malfoy gets them both high immediately, then takes him to a car boot sale and then to two Muggle sales out of their own mansions in London. Both are being hosted by older women dressed to the nines in all sorts of costume, and both of them know Malfoy very well, it seems.
“Are you sniffing me?” Harry laughs.
“Okay? I’m just going to let you fuck me, then. Nothing else. We shall… coexist,” Malfoy says. Harry nods, under his hand. Malfoy’s palm is soft and his hand is long across Harry’s face.
with me? Who said anything about
By the time October comes, chilly and pouring rain as usual, Draco has grown his hair into a cropped bob, just at his jawline, and Harry has to wait for him to moisturize it far longer whenever he washes it. Sometimes he still slicks it back and Harry spends a lot of time looking at the shiny hair on the back of his neck. He likes to watch it disappearing beneath a heavy cashmere scarf or a bright red turtleneck that shouldn’t look good on him but does.
“It’s all right. Draco.”
me, per se, I mean I will say I myself rather enjoyed the past month but I know you were in it for perhaps, well, different reasons than I. I know what you said, I just… I don’t want you to be
“I have all the necessary literature here for you both. No need to do anything differently than you are now, the bond is new and will strengthen with time. I would say that you do need to remain near each other for the time being, anywhere from three weeks to two months abouts while the bond calibrates itself. I do assume that you have already been in close quarters though, for the bond to form. Living together?”
Malfoy rolls his eyes. Harry raises his brows and holds out his arms, beckons him over. And finally, the lump in Harry’s throat releases, and Malfoy inches over, ever serpentine, his big pants peeking through his robe, sets his hat down on the table and seats himself over Harry’s lap. All of his clothes feel heavy around him, drape over Harry’s legs and onto the floor.
“Alright. I’ll forget about the scars.” Draco rolls his eyes.
“Everyone doesn’t know much, then,” Harry growls, and then he’s got Malfoy pinned on his front to the counter, knocking Harry’s lotion and toothpaste down onto the floor with his elbows. Malfoy groans and reaches back to Harry’s hips, pulls them tight against his soft cheeks. Harry could cry for how much of a relief the friction is, his dick rubbing on Malfoy’s hole finally, finally, after a day of not being able to touch too much or too hard for fear of being chewed out.
“As I was
“He wears strappy clogs,” Harry groans. It sends Hermione off again, laughing and going back to the dishes as Harry downs his beer despondently. “I feel like he hates me.”
He had blown his Order of Merlin cash on furniture, antique to vintage mid-century modern and everything in-between. He had spent three straight weeks painting and putting up the most bizarre wallpapers he could find, magical and Muggle. He had charmed each bathroom’s white tiles a different color and pattern, to the point that when even Luna came to stay for a couple days to help out she had strongly encouraged him to reconsider the whole operation and start collecting plants instead.
A wave of nausea, because Draco has cut his hair and suddenly Harry is at Malfoy Manor, and he reaches for something, anything, but finds nothing. He is vomiting on the floor on his hurried way out the door, and Draco’s fingers are on his shoulder but Harry pushes him away, with all the force of his strength and magic, too.
“I still don’t know how I feel,” Malfoy whispers.
“Want a slice of cake?” He hears himself asking. Malfoy nods, laughing. Harry takes his warm, soft hand, and leads him to Luna, who is standing at the dessert table.
The next morning, after Harry has woken up to Malfoy in his bed,
“Oh my god, so hot. Draco,” Harry says into his mouth. Draco nods, kissing him. And then, they’re laughing at all of it, standing up against the door. Draco’s hand on the doorframe. Harry cups his chin again, just looks at his eyes and his lashes and those pink cheeks. He taps a finger on his bitten lips. Draco and his music taste, and how he writes, and his little ass in his desk chair, his long robes and his pretty cock and all of that
“What did he mean-”
It is not a question. Harry hates how well she knows him. He wants to respond but can only nod. She rolls her eyes.
“Your suit looks familiar, your whole outfit does, really. Have I seen you in that before-”
Harry knows what he means,
They get hard and ignore it, even though Harry wants to put Malfoy’s dick in his mouth he won’t, he wants to see what Malfoy wants to do first, or he’s a little nervous by how much Malfoy seems to be opening up to him, or something. It’s a little romantic, though, to be half hard lying beside each other and just talking, looking at each other. So much so that Harry is glad for the sunshine and how it is concealing his embarrassed flush.
“You’re getting more freckles,” Malfoy says to him, near impossible to hear around the creaky pipes. “Freckles all over…”
“I mean I just don’t want to cause you any trouble, Potter.”
“I’m sorry—it’s just—”
, period. But they know each other’s personalities, and are surprised by each other sometimes.
“Yes, Harry?” They’ve taken to first names only when they are certainly not thinking about it.
“‘S lovely,” Harry says. Draco takes his hands and brings them to his waist. Harry’s eyes are closed, and he breathes deep into Draco’s hair. He smells like smoke and a little of St. Mungo’s, but mostly of his cologne and his shampoo and leave-in conditioners. He smells like the house.
“Lie down,” he says. His voice is sure, like he has been waiting just as long as Draco has. Draco’s heart grows and his knees hit the mattress of Harry’s twin bed, Harry’s hands on his back pressing him down gently.
“Your classes in Arabic?” Malfoy offers Harry the cigarette, and when he takes it their fingers brush. Harry twitches slightly. Nods again. Forces himself to speak.
Eventually, Harry has to owl his friends to really explain where he has been. He’s half surprised that Hermione hasn’t broken down the door yet from sheer curiosity, so when her next letter comes he responds immediately. He invites her and Ron over for tea the next day, figuring it doesn’t make much sense to wait.
They eat a bastardized breakfast, early and made up of leftovers from dinner and whatever Hermione can find in the cupboards, all at the kitchen table yawning and in their party clothes. Ginny falls asleep on Neville’s lap, and Luna wanders off to the attic in the middle of their meal. Pansy and Hermione get into an involved argument about Ministry corruption.
“We are. And you like it.”
Not out loud, but in his most private thoughts, in the shower in his rooms or when he and Draco are making their way to the quidditch pitch to sit in the stands and snack on crackers and cheese. He thinks,
Malfoy’s lips are moving to his neck from his hairline, then, and Harry tears himself away to cross the room and pick some kind of something good out. He knows that Malfoy means the Stones, or something equally heavy, for his wine mouth and his mean streak. He’s in a mood Harry has never seen him in, in all his years of watching. Harry doesn’t want to cross him or encourage him, so he charms
“Come up to bed. I’ll help you sleep,” he says. He grips Harry’s chin and pulls him up for a chaste kiss, dragging him up further to stand. “‘Cmon,” he whispers against his lips. Harry nods.
“I—alright,” Draco says. Harry’s heart comes up into his throat.
, I like them. I thought, one, for Sirius—”
Harry pulls Draco onto his lap in the morning at breakfast, at the daily tactical meeting, at lunchtime when everyone drags themselves into the kitchen to see what’s around to eat, at afternoon tea in the parlor. He seems much too delighted to have Draco’s leg over his thigh at dinner. Harry likes to keep Draco’s ass between his strong thighs, likes to have his lips just brushing Draco’s cheeks at all times. It would annoy Draco were he not so similarly desperate to have Harry near him in every capacity for every moment they are available to each other. Harry tries to hold his hand through every meal, as if by letting go Draco will get up and fly out the window. Harry tells him that he loves him with everyone around. Draco wonders if they are better or worse than Granger and Weasley. Harry says,
“I’m not the one threatening violence,” Harry says, sticking his face into Malfoy’s chest, scraping his teeth over his shirt. Malfoy makes a frustrated sound and pulls them both up and off of the chair, up the winding staircase to Harry’s bed, where his hair fans out soft on the pillows and his arse looks so perfect in Harry’s big hands.
like he was made to taunt Harry with it, and isn’t it a turn from them laughing in Luna’s garden except that then Harry is laughing anyways again, into Malfoy’s lap.
“We do,” Harry says. He wraps his arm around Draco’s little waist.
. And all anybody ever talks about is sweaters this, scarves that. Pea coats. And I’m not saying it’s all awful, some of it is rather nice, but when it’s all paired together, I swear. My goodness, is it dismal. Greys and navy blues.”
“Harry, Draco,” she greets them with a warm smile. Her drink has a crazy straw in it that spells her name. Harry assumes it’s a gift from Dean.
“Of course it’s lovely. It’s my life’s work.”
“Draco, I’ve already asked them. They’re happy to invite you along. It’s a celebration of the school year, that it’s starting up. We want you there.”
Here is Malfoy teasing Harry in a way he never has before, letting Harry in on the joke. He’s smirking and it is achingly familiar but also new, in the way his eyes are dark, dark grey with want and sparkling with joy. Harry takes it and decides he’ll run with it, leans into Malfoy’s space and sticks his nose into his hair. He inhales deeply, putting his hand across Malfoy’s lap and at the far side of him on the bench, so he is diagonally all across him. Malfoy’s free hand not gracefully holding his cigarette comes up immediately to his hair, tugs where it is coming out of its loose braid. Harry groans, takes his lips right to the soft, delicate skin of Malfoy’s neck.
“Dinner? It’s only afternoon, darling,” he says sleepily. Harry pulls away then, to fingers still tight on his shirt, to check the stove, fiercely ignoring the hot blush creeping across his cheeks.
And Harry is the one to lead him to the bedroom.
Malfoy doesn’t go on, trailing off into silence. Harry looks around and confirms it to be so. There is not much of anything in the whole space.
“I’ll have to come and see them sometime! Watch the drink,” George says. He smacks a kiss on both of their cheeks, and waltzes off to Angelina and Luna on the dance floor.
“Travelling. You have got to come to a few games, you know, I can get you both tickets and you could come on weekends, when you’re not both teaching-”
So, he continues to work on the back garden while he waits for Malfoy. He wants to wait, because he wants him, and that is enough. He doesn’t mind it, almost, beyond feeling like he is stretched thin with need, because somehow he knows Malfoy will come back. And something to wait for feels like something to look forward to, and Harry has mastered finding things to look forward to to keep him going.
“Harry,” he whispers. He’s right.
, Harry thinks. So he sits out in the garden he’s been grudgingly trying to tame, at least the first twenty or so feet of it out from the back porch, and writes Malfoy.
Malfoy, once they are back at Grimmauld Place, shows Harry the empty bedroom on the second floor where he has been leaving a bit of his closet every day so that it is easier to be Harry’s “live-in fuck buddy,” as he calls it.
“Happy for you, Bowie. And you, Harry. Who would have thought, you two, in the end. Cute suit,” he winks at Draco. Harry is lost.
Harry snorts, pats the top of Draco’s hand. He strides ahead a few paces, and then turns to face Draco.
“Mmm, yes, Harry, finally. Oh, I’ve waited—” Harry groans at Draco’s little comments, kisses him to shut him up and strokes him just three times before he comes.
“I do wear robes,” Draco huffs. “Just open and draped
“Put something on, Potter. Something good,” Malfoy gestures to the turntable, and Harry groans loudly. “Come on, Potter. I want to feel bad, convince me to stay. Huh? D’you want me to stay the night? Put something good on, then. I might like you if you do.”
“You don’t want your kids to be redheads, too, then?” He says it against Harry’s lips. Harry wishes he could say his dick flagged at the mention of any Weasley, but with Malfoy’s hands on it it seems impossible under any circumstance and Harry shakes his head in confusion. “Ginevra, I mean?”
The lights in the big house have been dimmed and Draco has set up colorful fairy lights around each room and draped all of the lamps with silk scarves. Despite the crowd being fairly small, the party is loud and joyus, and Harry has a thrill inside of his stomach at the idea of Christmas, and New Years, and how good of a match he and Draco are and what they must look like together, standing as a unit and hosting.
“I like you so much. I didn’t know that about you, today,” he says. Malfoy rolls his eyes, looks grateful for the subject change.
Harry doesn’t have to ask to what he is referring to.
When they are back in Harry’s living room, he turns to confront Malfoy finally. His purposeful silence at St. Mungo’s and then all through their stop at his apartment to gather his necessities has been grating on his ears far more than his rambling could be in any other situation.
It now feels almost, tentatively, as though he belongs in the place. With Harry’s décor. And the house adores him, plies him with wine and fine whiskeys it won’t even provide to Harry.
“We could die tomorrow,” Harry tells him on Christmas Eve. Draco knows this, and he tangles their cold fingers together. The warming charms are fading, and Draco wants to lead him to bed. He nods instead, leans back to look up at the sky. It’s hard to believe that it’s the same sky as in Wiltshire, because here there are no stars and there is just that orange glow that reminds him of Harry, and silence, and soft noises of the dead garden, and the sirens in the distance.
When they are nearly to the castle, Draco stops to stare out at the snow, and Harry grips his delicate, sharp jaw in his hand that looks so large on his face and kisses him hard. Draco chokes into his mouth, but then immediately opens those pink lips and pushes that hot tongue Harry’s always wanted to touch against Harry’s.
Harry had renovated Grimmauld six years before, when he was lacking a proper job or a proper sense of motivation for anything otherwise than the simplicity of being as lazy as he possibly could. He was interested mainly in allowing the days to stretch painfully long so as to milk them for all they were worth, drinking, smoking, and going to gay bars with Ginny and maybe sometimes Neville and then Dean, when they spent a week hooking up and chasing as many threesomes as possible. It had all ended in an ill-advised orgy and radio silence from all parties for three years. In the midst of all of it, though, Harry had developed an obsession with making his living conditions as decadent and comfortable as he could possibly.
“He isn’t wrong,” Hermione cuts in. Harry does sneak a look at Malfoy then, who looks as if he is about to faint. He covertly beckons him over to the loveseat, where he sits gingerly beside Harry. He clasps his hands on his knees and doesn’t speak a word until Hermione directly asks him a question fifteen minutes into the conversation.
“You are fucked up,” Draco says. And Hermione hears it over the floo.
Harry grunts and grips Malfoy’s arse to settle him down on his lap more, unbuttons his impossibly tight pants and pulls his dick out, so familiar to him by now, and Malfoy is sweating down his forehead where it is pressed to Harry’s so sweetly, and when he comes his pupils are so blown out Harry wants to weep.
“You were not, come here,” Malfoy says. Again, so sure that Harry will come. And he does. He drapes himself across Malfoy’s lap, circles his arms around the back of his neck. “Come here.”
, hoping it isn’t too formal or too personal. He feels a bit like he’s writing a professor about an extension. He sends it off anyways, gulping down his anxiety and twirling a lock of hair between two fingers compulsively.
“Harry, I want to see you in this,” he says mercifully, beckoning him over with a beautiful hand.
, travelling up through his fingers and in a line of fear and more-than-possibly excitement up his arm—settling in the crook of his elbow and then barely missing giving him a spasm to splash the teacup he was setting (peace offering) on Draco’s desk.
Harry feels dumbstruck by Malfoy’s sweetness, even in his joking manner.
But every so often Harry can see how he is getting through to his houseguest. A bitten-down smile here and there, or a hand ran through Harry’s curls when neither of them are even acknowledging each other.
Harry laughs, lays his book down on his stomach.
“Hm?” He mumbles.
from where he is seated with his legs crossed and a cigarette smoldering between his fingers. Harry hasn’t gotten over the way that smoking is accepted in hospitals in the magical world, still, but figures that there’s likely a magical cure for lung cancer, then. Or everyone’s just mastered charms for lung protection. Maybe he’ll ask the healer when she’s done with the diagnostic spell. Malfoy pokes his shoulder, bringing him back down to Earth.
“I guess we should. Merlin, she’s going to be so pissed at me,” he says. Draco snorts.
“That’s that,” Hermione says, and levitates the bottle of gin from the ancient cabinet over to where she is sitting in the pink winged armchair.
“No, Potter. I may welcome you into my personal space more often than not, lately, but I do know where I am and am not welcome, otherwise. There is not a chance in hell that Weasley or Granger would ever want to speak to me, let alone at one of your precious shared pub nights.”
“But she likes you. She adores you. It’s lovely, that you know her the way that you do. Even if it’s all in pursuit of someone’s stuffy old clothes.”
Draco continues to write. His handwriting is long, but cramped. Harry watches his hand move across the page. Wide knuckles to match those long fingers. The top of Draco’s head, silver, bobbing a bit as he considers.
“It’s a small party, Draco. I’ve already said yes to the fucking decorations, and the music selection for the turntable, and for the literal feast of charcuterie- can’t I-”
“He always wears just one earring,” Harry says.
“Sure,” Harry offers. Draco nods, slips the tin under his arm. Harry raises his brows at him.
when they are in his office drinking late into the night and purposefully not remembering.
Draco sniffs, long. Harry lifts both arms again for him to see. Another offering. Draco’s fingers go to his inner tricep, tracing the sketched snitch, there.
. So he signs off, penning that if Malfoy wants, Harry will be home all summer and he can come over whenever he pleases, really, but then decides against it and scribbles it out as best he can. He leaves it with a
strong connection, and is exceedingly rare. Some even say that the bond can only manifest itself when the recipients are soulmates, though that has not in any way been proven in a magical science capacity.”
Draco had settled in quickly, despite having so many things to bring over. The second, larger parlor had been converted into his closet, and Harry often spends mornings there while Draco plans an outfit, sitting on the window seat, drinking his coffee and commenting on his choices lazily.
Which he did, and had commissioned Luna to paint the bathroom ceilings. And then, when all of it was done, he slept in each bedroom for as many nights as there were them, so as to admire his own handiwork.
“Malfoy. Look at me. Please?” Harry’s head is beginning to pound. “I need you to-”
“Potter. I’d be happy to join. You know Granger and I worked together, yes?” Harry nods. Hermione had led workshops on Hogwarts curriculums when he had been in Egypt. She had written him saying that she and Malfoy were going for tea regularly and that they had been revolutionizing, in her humble opinion, a more inclusive and well-rounded approach to Muggle studies. How Malfoy had provided insight into the topic, Harry hadn’t asked. He loves to imagine, retroactively, Hermione in her oversized cable-knit sweaters and Malfoy in his velvet pants chatting over tea.
“Move in with me,” he whispers to Draco as they climb the stairs. Draco stops him and presses him against the railing, kisses him hard.
Harry laughs again, stands, and goes about the spellwork to configure Draco’s books.
Harry sighs. Chooses his next words carefully. Sometimes speaking with Draco is painstakingly, quietly, rehearsed. It is better than the both of them threatening to kill each other.
Draco says nothing for a long while. He stares at Harry, unblinking. He is so expressive, Harry wants to pick him up and carry him around just to see what his face and elbows would do. Harry can see the journey he takes before acquiescing. Not without shelving a great burden of anxiety and disbelief.
“Well, dear. You keep him, he is special- and you match so well,” she says. Harry takes a generous sip of his drink and goes back to watching Malfoy methodically analyze the clothes.
“Lovely of us to be married,” he mumbles. Harry certainly does not whimper a little in his exhaustion and the warmth of Draco’s cheek. “Lovely.”
“I’m in love with you, Potter.” To couch it with a “too” sounds like a joke, at this point. “I love you.”
“You know, I. You could make yourself useful?” Draco’s mood has shifted, it seems. His eyes are sparkling with something Harry does not want to bother defining. He wants to lean into it, this new feeling. “I have piles of books I want shelved, just there—” he gestures, “... and they won’t do it themselves. Alphabetical-by-subject, Potter.”
“You,” Harry says. He isn’t sure what he means.
In the morning, or later in the morning, Draco knows it is nearing four, Potter may laugh that giggle, the one that makes your own stomach seize with the sheer joy of it. Painfully contagious. Potter has discovered some kind of endless font of amusement in these troubled times. Maybe it has something to do with Fleur’s pregnant belly, or Molly’s dinners, everyone crammed tight at the long table. Draco feels it, too, sometimes. Just barely. When they are all together and he looks at someone just the right way. A big feeling, in his chest. Wide and growing. A fast feeling, a flash between his temples. That hot, determined recognition of love, or maybe just camaraderie, that brings his hands to twist together and his heart to race.
Harry grins, lights Draco a cigarette, still lying on him, and they share it with Harry’s fingers stroking the side of Draco’s neck, up behind his ear, along his hairline. It’s more than they’ve ever spoken about it, and Harry feels immensely drained. He isn’t used to speaking his emotions, and doubts he ever will be. Draco is a welcome diversion, especially when he starts ashing onto Harry’s hardwood floors and he needs to be pinched lightly on the thigh for it.
Eventually, Harry can pull his hair up into a bun at the back of his head. It makes Draco look at him quizzically, almost like something, on a Friday, but then Harry leaves for a weekend with Teddy, and on Monday it seems to all be forgotten.
In bed, Harry has never, not with anyone, been held like this. Draco places him atop his chest, on his back, his head right below his chin so that he can stroke his hair. He holds Harry right over his heart and strokes his hair, massages his scalp without a word. And then Harry is asleep, before he can tell Draco just how much what he is doing isn’t working one bit.
Harry gratefully steps through without answering, and is immediately swept up into a tight hug.
“I am here,” Harry says. Malfoy strokes his hair back from his forehead, where it is hanging in his face. Harry snaps his fingers and his drink comes to rest beside Malfoy’s wine on the coffee table. He disentangles himself from Malfoy’s body to take a gulp.
, I would hide in the kitchen and ignore that nasty elf who I always thought would tattle on me for sneaking around. And I would look out that window into the garden, and wish I could go get lost in it. It was always overgrown, for as long as I can remember. But I assume a hundred years ago it was quite lovely, and well-kept,” Malfoy goes on. He has a habit of doing so, of rambling with a drink held up and away from him, arm across the back of the loveseat shaped like a pair of red lips, which he also has developed a habit of sitting on. Legs spread. Because he looks good on it.
“Who’s done all of this?” Malfoy had asked, in his bed with the baby blue blue silk sheets and the Peter Max duvet, naked and so so pink himself, panting and desperate with his dick in Harry’s mouth. Harry had pulled off of him, delicious, sweaty at his tender hipbones, to great protest to answer.
But Draco’s breath isn’t slowing, and he looks at Harry with wild eyes. Harry strokes up and down his back, breathing hot onto Draco’s cheek. Draco works to match Harry’s slow rhythm.
“Yeah,” he says. Malfoy rolls his eyes and shifts down in his seat. his bare toes wiggle on the hardwood floor, and he momentarily digs them underneath the purple rug beneath the coffee table. Harry watches all of that, because Malfoy’s delicate, pale ankles and calves are something to rave about. When he makes his way back up Malfoy’s bright blue denim pants and his little silk shirt to his grey eyes, he’s staring at Harry intently. And hotly. “I was listening.”
After they’ve eaten, Harry gestures to the parlor, and Malfoy leads the way.
“Mmm. You know what they say about assuming, Potter.” Harry takes Malfoy’s outstretched elbow and is immediately apparated away.
“You are, don’t bother arguing again. I don’t want you like this. We’re a good team,” Draco can physically feel himself doing the turning-up-his-nose thing. Potter laughs a little, hushed in the close room. The house makes a sigh, so alive with Christmas and despair.
Harry feels suddenly as if he would like to faint. Malfoy gives a strange whimper beside him. Harry can’t look at him.
“I love you. I’m done wasting time,” he says. Potter says it hot against Draco’s face. Draco is kissing him before he can take another breath. He tastes Potter’s blood.
Harry looks down at him from his perch with dark eyes, almost black in the dim light of the gas lamps beside the mirror. Freezing rain pelts against the window, but Draco feels comforted by it, held by the house despite what tries so hard to get in. The candles around the massive claw-foot tub are lit, flickering on Harry’s pupils.
“Harry. Harry. Sometimes, I swear, you are so silly. And forgetful. Willingly forgetful. I cannot forget. I cannot forget any of it, because
He’s put on his brimmed suede hat and a silk scarf to go out, and his shirt is so tight and the waist of his pants so tight that he looks impossibly skinny but also quite cool, and Harry is maybe just realizing it now, how he looks so retro with his outfit and his white ankle boots, cigarette hanging carelessly from his lips as he delicately sorts through two racks of clothes.
“Thanks, then,” he cuts her off. “I’d better be getting back. Not proud of it, but he’s coming back soon and I’d like to be there when, you know.”
“You idiot, I’m saying figuratively. You don’t want little redhead babies?”
Most days it feels as though those first couple weeks never happened. Harry wishes he could know why Malfoy changed his mind, what Harry could have said that night to make him pull back into such a strange polite detachment. But it doesn’t seem like much of a stretch, how Malfoy had wanted him and now ignores any and all of Harry’s advances. Harry feels it too, the awkwardness of being who they are and feeling like maybe they are operating on a wish that should not be fulfilled. Ex Death Eater and the Chosen One, maybe too much of a stretch.
“We should stay away from each other. You aren’t good for me. I’ve done all of this to be- I’ve tried to be a better person,” Malfoy breathes. Harry leans to try and capture his lips. His eyes are falling closed, Malfoy’s face blurring behind his eyelashes. “I’ve tried to be good. You make me want-”
Harry likes to put his thumb right in the middle of Malfoy’s pink lips, his fingerprint at the part of his upper lip where it is more flat and long. Malfoy always opens his lips beneath it, but maybe someday he will sit still long enough for Harry to be able to trace his whole face. His roman nose, flushed pink with hot water, his sharp jaw, his arched cheekbones.
Harry laughs again. He props his hip against the door. Draco is scanning his face, eyes skipping over his lips. Draco is wearing his usual robes. The cooling charms in his office have been cranked up. Harry wants to joke that he can see his breath. And then Draco is pulling away, to his desk.
His hair is growing out a bit at the top, but he has kept the sides short to his head. He sits grading on the couch as Harry takes his desk, some nights. Draco pours Harry shots of Firewhiskey at the small bar in his office, hands them to him with a look. Harry gives him the look right back.
“Well, I’m… I’m not in the mood, Potter. I need some time to really let this, well, sink in or something, I’ve not been prepared for this sort of thing happening to me, certainly not with
“And you seem to have quite a style about yourself as well, don’t you? I must say, darling Draco is so mysterious, I had no idea he had a
He looks as though he’s been fed a lemon, and Harry cannot help but laugh at him.
“I’m sure he likes you. I think you’re overthinking,” she says. She levitates the spices on the counter back into their proper places on the spice rack. “I think he’s just caught up in all of it happening so fast. You’re, well. A bit of a lot to handle, once you’ve put your mind to something. Which, Harry, have you thought any about-”
“You’re kidding-”
“I want you to call me Harry,” Harry whines. Draco huffs a soft laugh.
“What?” Malfoy is distracted with patting his pockets for all of his necessary items. “What are you on about?”
“Obviously not,” he says, eyes flashing with something like delight. “Everyone else did, though. Terribly. Bemoaning your absence all through the decade, wishing you were here. Writing you and sending you gifts. Group photos for to send to Harry. You have a degree now, I suppose.”
Draco has learned to love Grimmauld Place and its humdrum lonely feel. It matches Potter, he thinks, his dark presence that is flipped like a switch into pure delight. The largeness of him that he came into after the death of his godfather, almost as if Sirius had gone inside of him and taken up half of the space. The house has expanded to fit all of them, and sometimes when Potter is out Draco will whisper to the wall of their shared bedroom and stroke it, to feel his blood thrumming with something from before in his fingertips, like how it felt to put his head in his mother’s lap. Potter sits in the living room with dragonhide boots propped onto the antique coffee table, and the floorboards themselves groan in fond protest of him. Draco has learned the rush of magic in the walls and its ever-shifting meanings.
“Nice to know you think so,” he says as he pulls back. Harry rolls his eyes. “Which one was the veela, Lucius? Or my mother? Either way, you’ve got some debriefing to do.”
, like Malfoy is forcing distance between them, ignores him until they are drying off in the lunar eclipse bathroom, as Luna had signed by the door beside her name, when Malfoy pulls him close and tugs on his cock.
what the bloody “usual thing” is) as well as going in-depth on new legislation for ingredient regulation and how it will affect his lesson planning, Hogwarts faculty gossip he heard from Neville, whom Harry had no idea Malfoy was on speaking terms with, and his own personal beliefs about what the upcoming weeks’ weather will be like.
“She knows we love her,” he says. Harry’s thick brows quirk in confusion. “The house.”
It takes a couple of hours before they make it to St. Mungo’s. They get caught up in testing the bond, or whatever it is, Malfoy standing out in the street and Harry in the back garden, Malfoy all the way to the grocery and Harry seated dutifully waiting on the front steps. He can feel it stronger the farther Malfoy goes, when he is away Harry finds himself desperate for Malfoy’s touch, his voice. Like he felt those first days, wanting him so bad. He feels sick that he didn’t think it to be a bond, that he merely believed it to come of his own wishes.
, when they sit beside each other at dinner. Harry takes breakfast from the elves in his rooms. He usually scrounges something for lunch. He wonders if Draco eats these meals with everyone else. Despite everything, he still finds himself wondering about Draco. He supposes that he is making up for five years without a thought about him. He’ll always be obsessed. And Draco isn’t helping it now, with his long black robes and long blond hair and all of his grace and height beside Harry, who is filled out and shorter and sometimes accidentally brushes his brown skin against Draco’s most pale wrist. Accidents happen. Draco has fine blond hair all up his arms.
“‘Mione. I’ve invited her and Ron for tea. You don’t have to be here, but. If you’d like, I’m sure they’ll bring pastries and stuff from this French bakery we go to, and there’ll be enough to share, and-”
“‘M not self- self what? Self-flagellating… Christ, Draco.”
At this point, whoever’s left of the Death Eaters are the most deranged. The most deranged by

, darling. But I’ve kept them aside because you know, when you know they’ll be taken care of, you want to wait,” she says as she lights a cigarette and offers one to Malfoy.
“No! It’s okay. Listen—listen to me. I thought one for Sirius, and then one for Teddy, because he asked me to, and then. It’s like I blinked, and now I’m full of them.”
, I’m your baby,” Draco says. He looks like he is trying not to die. Harry kisses him for it. The bond adores it.
Malfoy seems different, more on edge. Like he wants to scream at Harry, like he’s being forced to come. Harry can’t help the way his slight barbs make his chest burn from the inside out, like he is on fire. He wants to snap Malfoy’s neck, a little, and then he wants to fuck him again. And then again, he hates him, after Malfoy mentions his aunt like it’s nothing.
on me this whole time? What, tormenting me at work on a daily basis wasn’t enough, you had to come watch me exercise too? What was the plan there, flirt with me from across the room until I asked you out, then shoot me down?”

Drawing back a bit, he pulls Harry’s hips back until he can get one hand on Harry’s cock, whispering to make his hand slick before he starts to pull slowly along the shaft, then gets back to Harry’s arse, shouldering his legs further apart to get even deeper.
Potter huffs a laugh. “Prat. Let’s get out of here.”

of options. He’d been singleminded in his task, pulling her down onto each display bed and asking her very seriously what she thought about the firmness, and whether the truly absurdly-proportioned super king was a better choice instead of just the already massive king. She’d thankfully managed to talk him out of that one, but spent the rest of the trip offering tentative, neutral opinions, because, well, it wasn’t

They were instructed to check in a full four days before the tournament starts, in order to set up surveillance along the course and in the public spaces and ensure they’re not seen arriving together by too many participants. This lead was also meant to allow them ample opportunity to figure out how to get into the hotel where most of the golfers would be staying; Draco had conveniently not mentioned that they no longer needed the extra time now that they were actually

Sighing the sigh of a man much put-upon, Ron hauls himself to his feet, shoots Harry one last anguished glance, and squares his shoulders before striding over to Hermione and planting a kiss on her mouth. “I’ll see you two on the other side,” he mutters, flushing red and practically running out of the room.
Suddenly, Harry’s cuddling up to his side and whispering a cleaning spell over the pair of them, and when Harry tangles their legs together and presses a kiss to his shoulder, Draco thinks that maybe he won’t
Draco turns a faint pink, but there’s still a crease between his eyebrows.

. That was an excellent try, though.” In truth, if this were up to him, Draco probably would have offered fifteen; the fact that Harry’s looking up at him hopefully means he’s lowballing, though, so Draco will add on. “We’ll start with twenty-five, and see how you’re doing after that.”
shit sometimes, Harry Potter,” Hermione huffs, pulling his pint glass over and taking a long drink. “Honestly. Winding me up like that—and don’t think that I haven’t seen right past your efforts to distract me.”
They’re quiet for a while, their magic quiescent and glowing, and Draco almost slips to sleep when Potter starts talking.
“Oh, your feelings for me, of course,” Draco says serenely, ducking back under the water to rinse his hair. He snaps his fingers and both showerheads shut off, then he saunters towards the towels. “And mine for you,” he adds as an afterthought, snatching a towel and his clothes and disappearing back into the main locker room.
Harry watches him closely, comprehension slowly dawning. “Are you...you’re not saying you were able to…”
a half-forgotten name, a pale, sneering boy from school,
Harry moans in response and presses his lips to Draco’s forehead, lifting and sinking back down with his thighs, squeezing his eyes closed in a desperate effort to stop from coming too soon. His cock is rubbing between their torsos, over skin slicked with precome, and he can feel heat building in his thighs, and from the way Draco’s trembling under him, they’re both nearly there.
He whips the towel into the “used” basket and starts to throw his clothes on, ignoring the chatter around him. He’d gotten to the gym before the rush, like always, but it’s starting to fill up now with the after-work crowd; the locker room is only a quarter-full, but Harry’s seen this place when he gets off his shift closer to 5pm—it’ll be packed any minute now.
“Harry, is that a
Draco flicks his nose in response. “You should stop talking, you’ll hurt your voice,” he remonstrates.

his brain whispers), but it’s enough, and when Potter’s nose is pressed up against his closely-trimmed pubic hair, Draco comes with a whimper, sagging back against the counter.
Oh, he’d noticed that when Draco went down on him he was always much more enthusiastic if Harry had a tight grip on his ponytail, but it wasn’t until a round of angry sex after a vicious argument over who was responsible for picking up which groceries (ah, the travails of newly living with someone), and Harry had been fucking Draco against the wall, slow and deep, and he’d snuck his hand up and tangled it in Draco’s hair and pulled back sharply to expose his neck, and Draco had come all over the wall with a shout, that Harry realized just

They’re at the soft opening of some French-Italian fusion place that Draco got invited to through the Slytherin social tree, and Harry had begged him to accept; apparently, the chef is quite well-known in the Muggle world. This conversation is probably not appropriate for the table they’d been dragged to when the maitre d’ had seen who exactly was arriving under the false name Draco gave when he sent their RSVP back, but Harry has long left shame behind, and Draco never had any to start with. He thinks the waiter may have gotten a bit of an earful when he was delivering the main course, but he had been professional enough to not react.
Ron wavers back and forth a bit until the books re-balance, then shoots Harry a murderous stare. “You’re a real arse when you’re single, you know. Look, I’m
“Oh fuck,

Sighing, Draco heads back into the sitting room and crouches in front of the fireplace with a pinch of Floo powder. “The Den!” he calls when the fire turns green, wincing at Potter’s utterly idiotic Floo address as always.
Harry won’t speak to the papers, of course he won’t, but at some point he must have said something to someone, asking for privacy maybe, because the number of hateful letters Ginny’s been getting decreases day by day, and she can finally nip over to Diagon to get her gear repaired, or her broom serviced, without getting hissed at by the busybodies on the street who don’t know
When he turns around, Harry’s managed to calm down, but he’s still hard—and since this particular toy is magical, it’s spelled to ensure that someone can wear it for extended periods of time and suffer no ill-effects, he’ll have that erection all day. Draco licks his lips, thinking about Harry squirming through meetings and assigning out fieldwork with his subordinates none the wiser.
Harry sounds like he’s falling asleep, so Draco pinches him. “Of course it was. And you can’t sleep yet; it’s only seven, and we need to go down and eat. I got that vile pasta thing you like so much, and a double order of garlic bread.”
He sits calmly, watching as Harry shifts from foot to foot and hunches his shoulders. Draco can
Draco sighs and slips under the covers, spelling the lights the rest of the way off. “Good night,” he says awkwardly.
“Wake up, Draco,” he finally hears, and he slowly opens his eyes and sits up, grabbing gratefully at the glass of water Harry’s left hovering for him. He looks down at his chest, almost shocked to see the angry red marks all over his skin.
The library is also where he and Draco reconnected.
“Fluxweed,” Draco replies drowsily, and the first golden string of wax spills over the lip of the candle and lands on his chest.
Draco feels more than hears the spells Harry says next—cleaning, and lubrication, and loosening. Harry normally works him open manually, but sometimes they’re both too worked up to wait, and tonight is one of those nights.
Potter shrugs. “I’ll probably just cancel, honestly. It’s a setup and I’m not that keen on him.”
Harry rubs at the bridge of his nose. “So does that…” He pauses. This is completely unprofessional, but the way Draco’s watching him now… “When you told me that I was being too needy. That you didn’t want me. That I was stupid to think I was ever more than a trophy you could brag over having. You didn’t mean it?”
In mild humility.
Harry is telling the truth about this library being intensely disturbing—he always feels like there are eyes on the back of his neck, but whenever he turns around nothing's there. However, he mostly doesn’t want to instigate another disagreement that will lead to weeks of muttered resentment whenever he and Ron get together.

The next weekend, Harry’s got Draco bound all up in his magic and dangling from the ceiling, and Draco’s having trouble keeping his eyes open as Harry watches him from across the room.

He yelps when Harry pinches his arse. “I suppose since you’re paying for the room, I could buy you a few drinks,” Harry muses, joining him at the wardrobe as they pick out clothes for the day together. “After all, we’re here for a few more days, and all that’s left now is collecting the surveillance spells before we leave. It’s almost like we’re on holiday together.” He shoots Draco a shy smile.

good, Draco, every single time.”
He downs the potion, meditates as it burns through the fibres in his muscles, knitting them back together with a rapidity that makes him grit his teeth even through his cogitation, then checks in with his supervisor to check out for the day. He’d done good work that morning, and he has some preparations to set.
To say that Harry is stunned is putting it mildly. “Draco, I…” he starts, but Draco cuts him off with a sharp hand motion.

Harry winces, but Ron leans back in his chair, apparently still relaxed. “‘Fraid not. Not just my story to tell, you know? It wouldn’t be right. I didn’t know Liaisons had the horn for Malfoy that badly, though—if it makes them feel better, you can probably tell them he likes women too.”
After passing the bottle back and forth for several minutes, Malfoy spoke again.  “It’s just my luck to be partners with the Savior of the Wizarding World,” Malfoy groused.  “Why couldn’t you have been partners with Longbottom?  Then he would be cursed, not me.”
“I’m not going to change my mind,” Draco gritted his teeth.  “I know what I want.”
Before he could think of more words to defend himself, Dilly popped out and popped back in carrying one of Draco’s own shirts (dark green silk) and a soft warm cloak. She held both garments out to Potter who stuffed Draco’s parchment into his pocket before grabbing the green shirt.
“Why?  Why would you joke about that?” Harry was confused all over again.
Pansy’s eyes sparkled and a feral smile graced her lips. “Are you in love with anyone right now?”
He wasn’t sure what had awakened him, but he woke to a darkened room with a figure looming next to his bed.  He pulled his wand from beneath his pillow and cast “Lumos.” “Draco?” he croaked, when he saw the man standing there, “Al?  Is she . . .”  He started to push himself up to get out of bed.
“I knew this would happen, of course,” Draco said icily. “So much for the undying love of Gryffindors,” he sneered.  His grey eyes flicked over Harry’s tear-stained face, and then he turned and left the room.
“Well you have me at a distinct disadvantage since you have sprung this surprise wedding on me and I do not have the memory of previous vows to fall back on, but I will endeavor to do my best,” Draco’s soft smile took the sting from his words.  “Harry James Potter, today I take you as my husband. You have been my rival, my friend, my anguish, my savior, my lover, and my greatest challenge. I may never remember our life before.  But most importantly, I know that you are the love of my life and you make me happier than I could ever imagine and more loved than I ever hoped. You have made me a better person, and our love is reflected in the way I live my life. I will dream with you, celebrate with you, and walk beside you through whatever our lives may bring.  I look forward to being parents with you to Atria Lily and any more children we may be lucky enough to have.  Our family is everything to me.  You are my love and my life, Harry, today and always.”  Draco reached up with trembling fingers and brushed the tears from Harry’s cheeks and then from his own.
Harry fucks Malfoy so hard after that his armpits ache from holding himself up and over him.
to play and is back in Malfoy’s space seconds later.
“I want you in a miniskirt at the next Ministry event. I can’t imagine it any other way,” he says. Draco’s forehead is still wrinkled in angst, and he is biting his bottom lip. “I hope you wear bangles, too. And a puffy shirt. I won’t let you dress in stuffy robes. I don’t even really
It happens sometime after then and before Christmas day.
They finally venture out to a club to dance on the eighth day, get much too drunk and stumble home much too early, and Harry ends up getting Malfoy to sit in the parlor with him late into the night with the sound system and all of Harry’s vinyl. Malfoy knows more Muggle music than Harry would have ever expected him to, more than Harry knows himself. He wants to ask why, but neither of them ask many questions beyond surface level, seeming to both of them understand that all this is is fucking, and enjoying non-judgement for as long as they can. It’s pure decadence, and Malfoy has an air about him that he is always wasted, or is merely floating through the world in his own head, where he is gracing everyone with his presence. And shockingly, Harry finds it hot. It goes quite well with his well-crafted presence, his whispering, and his perfectly fucked up hair, his necklaces and rings.
“You are. But not for me,” he says. Harry pouts, looks up at him through his eyelashes. “Potter, I am serious. Deadly serious. You’re ridiculous and I despise you. And your hair, and your arms, and such. You’re entirely too much. You’re an eccentric. I simply cannot be with you.”
The next morning, a humid Monday, Harry is in the kitchen smoking his first cigarette of the day and nursing an iced coffee when Malfoy rings the doorbell.
to Ministry events anymore, Draco.”
The kitchen is one of Draco’s favorite rooms in the old house. He spends a decadent amount of time here, when not on patrol, working out in the cellar, or agonizing over theory in the library with Granger. He wakes before all other inhabitants of the house, even Minerva, who usually comes down for tea half an hour after him. It is a not-rare, but still precious morning quiet.
“I know it. I can feel it, Malfoy. It’s my fault, the bond. I did it somehow. Or, my magic did. It just feels too…”
, that permanent scowl he gets when he does deep on his face. They are close enough that Harry can see him, despite him being a bit blurry.
“I’m coming inside,” Harry says. His voice feels like gravel, like he hasn’t spoken in weeks. He wants to hear it mixing with Draco’s tenor.
“But—”
to confirm that yes, he is scribbling away at January lesson plans.
“Come to bed, come on,” Harry says, flustered. He feels like he is floating on air, his limbs shaky. Malfoy lets him pull him up the stairs babbling on about how Harry is gagging for it and pulling at Harry’s hair.
Draco ducks to avoid a low-hanging branch, and his chin ends up sharply on Harry’s shoulder. Harry can feel his fingers, then, digging around in Harry’s jacket pocket for his cigarettes. He grunts, lets Draco push a cig in his mouth and light it with a flick of his fingers. And then he is leaning into Harry to light his own against it. Harry huffs a big breath of air and Draco’s eyelashes flutter. He feels very young and carefree, all of a sudden. Like he’s in a world he had thought he would never have. Draco blushes fiercely. Harry laughs out smoke at him. His hand on Harry’s arm doesn’t move.
“All right.”
Harry laughs. Draco looks positively taken aback. Harry pinches his sharp Roman nose. Draco’s lips curve downwards, but Harry knows the bashful joy in his eyes. He can’t stop grinning, not when they pass McGonagall in the hall and she looks disapprovingly at their linked arms, not when Draco tries to push him onwards when they stop at his office door.
“Alright, Harry. Sorry. What is it, my dear,” he says. Harry collapses onto him.
Draco’s face changes into something, something open and forlorn and longing. His forehead goes into little lines. Harry smiles.
When Harry wakes up the next morning, naked and sore on top of his bedsheets, Malfoy is gone.
“Well, Potter.” Harry waits for more, but Draco is still prodding at his skin. Goosebumps break out over Harry’s forearms, and Draco looks down at his face. “Fascinating.”
“Well, obviously I have some magical means of keeping everything perfectly preserved, in my closet at home. But these, now that we’re at the corner-” Malfoy pulls his wand from his back pocket and taps all of their bundles, and they disappear into the tiny bag over Malfoy’s shoulder. “Now, come. I’ll show you
“I love you, too?” Harry’s heart melts. Draco says it so genuinely, but with such honest confusion.
Draco turns, shocked and disgusted at him, but his nose and cheeks are bright red. Harry laughs, gathers him up, and kisses him soundly. Draco pulls away, pulls back to kiss him again, pulls away.
“You are

He is playing the Stones maybe too loudly when Draco comes stumbling into the kitchen, rubbing his eyes and lighting a joint. Harry pulls him in, swaying from side to side, and dances him a little welcome. Draco groans but doesn’t move to remove himself from Harry’s arms.
Malfoy ignores him, though, not without a cherry blush, and stuffs his face back into Harry’s chest.
Draco drops his arm unceremoniously.
Draco studies him. His face is clear of past emotion, Harry feels a gratitude for him that catches him off guard. Erases his almost-tears.
That is, until he runs into Malfoy, wasted at one of Luna’s spring parties. His first back. Harry is twisted,
“I am good,” he says against Malfoy’s chin. “I’m the most good. Goodest.”
“It’s gross how much I like you,” Harry says. He is too sleepy and high to not tell him. Draco hates it immediately, it’s visible on his face how much he hates it, but Harry just laughs at him and trails his fingers up to where Draco’s hair is parted in the middle. “I know you don’t think you like me as much as I like you. But you do, you do.”
Harry jumps, drops his biscuit on the floor. Draco is standing in the doorway, rumpled. His hair is sticking up in the front. Harry’s heart skips a beat, thrills at the sight of him. He is so gone.
The wicker chairs Neville had repaired years ago have little knit cushions on them, courtesy of Molly, and Draco curls up in his designated one to Harry’s left and they smoke until they are much too tired to sit upright anymore. Harry reaches over and strokes his cheek, runs his fingers over the closely shaved sides of his head and tugs playfully on the longer hair atop it.
“No, I don’t think I will,” Draco cuts him off. Harry’s heart sinks. His pale hands have gone back to rearranging the papers on his desk he had just finished with. He’s a busybody, always talking or moving, filled to the brim with nerves. Harry adores it. He perishes the thought.
Malfoy nods, winks at her, lights his cigarette with a Muggle zippo Harry has never seen him carry. He wonders who is a hanger-on, and why. But the moment is so mysterious that Harry is content to watch. Malfoy is clearly in his element here, has a whole other life Harry had not a single clue about.
Muggle cigarettes have a sharper scent than the pipe Draco’s father used to smoke. It reminds him of Potter, now, the smell that he can hardly place now for how often it is in his nostrils. Draco doesn’t know why he waited for Potter to come home, in the dark kitchen. Except it is warm and close and dreary, and Draco is wearing a long green scarf knitted by Molly. Except that he hasn’t had a solid night’s sleep for maybe seven years, at least. Not since he really realized the gravity of the thing, you know.
Eventually, when Ron is grabbing more coffee and Hermione has run to the loo, Malfoy turns to him haughtily.
Malfoy laughs, barely above a whisper. He steps towards Harry, in his hat and his little pink shirt. His elbows are sharp and fantastic. Harry reaches out to touch one.
“Go over,” she says. Harry feels himself blink at her. Slow as honey. She rolls her eyes. “‘Cmon.”
“Harry! I feel like we haven’t spoken in forever, what are you up to? Want to come through? It’s just me, Ron is out with Arthur for dinner.”
Malfoy snorts.
me, you idiot.” Malfoy takes him by the elbow where Harry is leaning onto him rather pathetically and drags him into the kitchen, sits him down at the table.
“You’re wrapped around my little finger, Potter,” he says. The music is almost too loud, but Malfoy is tapping in rhythm on his temple as he runs his nails gently across Harry’s scalp. “You’re all mine.”
“What’re you doing, bad boy?” Draco has laughter in his sharp teasing, and Harry melts from the inside out. Draco has gotten over his
He doesn’t quite remember how, in hindsight, but soon he and Malfoy are standing in Luna’s bright kitchen, Malfoy snatching the joint right from Harry’s mouth and exhaling smoke in his face. Despite Malfoy’s extremely satisfied look of impish delight Harry cannot find it in himself to be annoyed. There is something tugging at his gut at the smile lines on Malfoy’s cheeks. Those weren’t there seven years ago. Malfoy’s arms are certainly more sculpted than previous. He is simply beautiful in the afternoon hours in Luna’s familiar house, too much so for Harry to be able to ignore it.
The next morning, Harry wakes at noon and Draco is nowhere to be found, but the bond is not unhappy so he knows that he is somewhere in the house. He finds him, groggy with too much sleep, on the loveseat reading the
He writes him about Egypt, and his friends there, and what his classes were like. He asks unashamedly what Malfoy’s NEWTS were in, and when he finished his Potions Mastery. He asks about Hogwarts, and if he likes teaching, and then he thinks better of all of it and burns the letter right then and there.
“You smell like me,” he says. Draco laughs a laugh Harry has never heard before.
“I’d thought that was implied,” he says when he pulls away, and Harry has to pull him in again.
Fall seems like a new beginning for Harry. It’s been years since he’s lived an English fall, and he and Draco sit out in the garden for hours in the middle of the day when it isn’t so cold, Draco reading and Harry drifting in and out of sleep. Draco sprawls himself out on the outdoor furniture gracefully, very long and malleable.
Two weeks later, Malfoy has all but moved in.
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione sets a beer in front of him at the table. “Sometimes you have to look at your past self and just laugh- I mean, you were
Firstly, Draco expresses deep disgust at how he is still in his pajamas, and insists on going up to change into something more suitable for guests, but Harry and Hermione just follow him, standing around as he picks his outfit, a suede miniskirt and flowing blouse. Hermione laughs hysterically at the story of their bonding, and Draco gifts her a sparkling electric blue wrap dress he insists has never fit him right, despite Harry knowing he could have fixed it up after getting it from Eva’s the other day.
It looks at home there, in the middle of the wall, framed and adult. It screams competence and everything else Harry knows he may never truly feel. But he doesn’t want to face a job yet, doesn’t want McGonagall owling him at all hours of the day, and he wants summer in England free of looming plans. He has grand ideas and vague nostalgia of those years post-War, in the heat and dull of the goodness of all of his closest friends. He is under no delusions about how it will go- all of his friends have jobs now, and he’ll be spending time alone, but he covets laziness. Finds a decadence in it he’s never quite found in anything else.
“Potter, you called me back here after one day I was gone. One. Day. And now you’re all over me, on your knees for me. You
“Alright,” Draco says. Potter hands him one, lights it with those same snapped fingers.
“So are you,” Harry says, his lips so close to Malfoy’s that he can feel him breathing onto them. He’s addicted to the feeling of Malfoy’s breath. “Just look at those knit pieces.”
Smoking and eating yesterday’s leftover curry, he feels confident in his home and his adulthood and Harry wants Malfoy, wants to see him in his ancestral home that still has that construction and that magic despite being so changed. Malfoy leaving has convinced him of how badly Harry wants him here. And when Malfoy writes back to Harry after those two weeks of fucking and eating and fighting that yes, he’ll come back for dinner, and would Harry like him to bring food and wine along? Harry twitches and knocks his beer over, spilling it all down the kitchen table.
“Well? Do you feel it too? Potter, it feels like a bond.” Malfoy looks distressed, and suddenly Harry can feel it too, somewhere beneath his diaphragm, almost a tight wad of something that looks in his mind’s eye to be a thick rope that runs across the coffee table to Malfoy’s person. “Potter?”
“You do,” Harry whispers.
“Didn’t think so,” he says.
It’s a slow fall. Harry is back from University in Egypt, five years of backbreaking work and getting the absolute least amount of sleep he’s gotten since the War. He comes back tanned and relaxed despite all of it, hating English rain more than he ever thought possible. He sleeps for three days, after hanging his shining diploma on the wall in the parlor, with all the pictures of his families and Luna in Singapore and he and Neville in giant wading boots, holding carnivorous ferns.
“I’m rather sick of it too,” Potter says. Draco starts, then is reminded dearly of Potter’s absolute abysmal Legilimency skills. Draco’s exact thoughts must have been stark on his face. He fingers the old scar on his chin, where it runs down his neck and chest. Potter watches his fingers. His eyes are dark, but Draco knows what he is thinking.
crying at our wedding party,” he snaps. Harry laughs. “It’s horribly tacky.”
“What are you saying? I’m not in trouble because of you, I rather like you, like I said, I wasn’t lying to you, I mean the bond is indicative-”
Malfoy drapes the paper over the armrest and gestures to his gut. His knobby knees are crossed over, in his stripedy pants. Harry stares.
“What d’you think about coming to the Three Broomsticks with me, some night this week? I usually meet Ron n’ Hermione there, in the days before classes start, and I—”
“I know. He is rather partial to that look.”
“And those silk shirts. Lots of suede. Little silk scarves.”
“Potter…” Malfoy’s voice is low in warning.
“Well, not so much since I got comfortable in Egypt. It was like I was so distracted all the time, with work and everything being so new, I forgot to have nightmares. And yeah, so…”
, in his head. Maybe when McGonagall had told him, in her office with the silvery summer sun peering through the window behind her pointed hat.
. She likes you, too. Not the way I like you-”
“Draco, I want you,” he whispers. His voice cracks, and he swallows before continuing. His mouth is dry. “I like you. You won’t cause me trouble. We’ll be a power couple, like I said. I wasn’t joking. How could this bond have formed if I was stringing you along but didn’t truly want you?”
“Thank you, Potter. Don’t go spilling secrets to anyone about this, though. I have things that people would
It lulls him to calm, but he cannot fall back to sleep. He slowly extracts himself from Draco’s octopus grip, shoves on his glasses, tiptoes out of the bedroom and down the dark stairway. His house will always be creepy at night, he’s resigned himself to that fact.
Harry laughs for so long that eventually his stomach is aching pleasantly, and Draco is running one impatient hand through a flyaway section of hair at his temple. He is all red, once Harry catches his breath. Harry cannot stop looking at him.
, Harry’s mind supplies. As if Harry wasn’t aware.
“Well, not really,” Draco says. Harry squeezes his arse so he jumps a little, scowls at Harry in the mirror.
“Who would have thought.” Harry does his best to calm himself. Draco grins, like he can’t help himself.
with him, so so sickeningly obsessed. You’ve always taken yourself so seriously.”
“Nothing. I’m here to welcome you to the team.”
This is different. Harry knows nefarious magic, knows the difference intimately when something is trying to lull him into a false sense of security and when his own magic is making something to protect him. When he knew that he had sent that
the eccentric, Malfoy. With your lace shirts and your single earrings and all of your
, and Hermione writes Harry to say that she’ll get sandwiches and a salad on the way. Harry sets the coffee table, not wanting to put Kreacher out with the dining room, and Malfoy dithers in the entryway and then in the kitchen, hidden away from the door once he realizes that he is right in the line of sight of the front window. Harry hates it. Malfoy is only making him more nervous to have his best friends over, something he has never experienced before now. Hermione and Ron had spent a month each year with him in Egypt just for a holiday, they’ve never been apart for long. He isn’t used to worrying what they might think. But Malfoy is worrying enough for it to pour out of him and spill right into Harry.
And with that, far too little information, in Harry’s opinion, they are released into the world with a mere handful of pamphlets.
“You know, smoking will kill you. It’s a filthy Muggle habit,” Draco says matter-of-factly. “I’m not saying I
“Yeah. Well, no. Say you’re my baby. Please,” Harry cups his cheeks in his hands. “You’re my baby.”
Harry reads it twice, and then falls asleep reading it that night, in the light of his starry bedroom ceiling.
“God, you, you have style, Potter. I hate you- you don’t know anything about clothes, but you have fucking style,” he pants. Harry laughs through the kiss, smacking his lips against Malfoy’s chin and gripping his jaw hard in hand to keep his head in one place. Malfoy strokes him harshly so that he gasps and sees stars a little before he gains some balance in the situation.
“I know you do, Potter. I know you do.”
“I hated him in sixth,” Harry says. Hermione laughs at him, so hard that tears come to her eyes, and turns away from him to the fridge to compose herself. “What. What? I did, he was a right git and I wanted to kill him, a bit. I nearly
“Who is intoxicated?” She asks. Harry rolls his eyes, coughs a bit on smoke and floo powder. “Ah. I see. To what do I owe the pleasure of this afternoon call?”
With so many dead and dying, his old pit of gnarled fear inside of his stomach untangles into something that cushions embarrassment he would have felt not too long ago at saying so.
He nearly trips over himself making his way to the front door, opens it panting and hanging off of the doorframe like an idiot. Malfoy looks him up and down, judgemental as ever. Harry follows his eyes and is reminded he is only wearing his blue linen button-up, open, with his striped pajama boxers.
“You look nice!” Harry says. Malfoy clicks his tongue and turns away from him. “Don’t throw a tantrum, I’m serious. I think you look lovely today. Are you enjoying the lunch?”
He whispers it to Draco, lips nearly brushing his ear, at the table in the Great Hall. He ignores McGonagall’s eyes. He is starving from not eating lunch, from lifting his bookshelf and repairing it and re-stacking everything. He could feel Draco’s magic against the side of it, warm and now-familiar. Like when he would hold Draco’s wand.
“Wouldn’t be a good look on you either, you’re already so pale,” he says. He brings his free hand to Draco’s pink cheek. Which darkens redder. He marvels at how Draco warms under his touch.
In the winter, Draco wears black knit sweaters and black Muggle jeans rolled up at the cuff beneath his robes.
“Draco, darling, I’ve kept some things for you I knew you would love. These are from Pam, and then some of these we think were Anita’s, but we can’t always be so sure, can we. That’s the
“So, to what do I owe the pleasure? I can feel you burning up wanting to say it, Harry. It’s Draco, isn’t it.” Her eyebrows are high on her forehead.
The one night Malfoy leaves to go out with Pansy, Harry feels almost physically ill. His heart hurts, and his stomach is rolling in disappointment. He feels insane, almost, like there is an itch he cannot scratch, a mistake he made that only Malfoy in his bed can fix. Malfoy comes home early, saying he felt awful at dinner, like he would vomit up anything he put in his mouth, and he and Harry end up sharing his leftovers in bed. They fall asleep without fucking, with Malfoy’s arms around his head and Harry’s face where his heart is, trying to get as close as possible.
Hermione rolls her eyes for the fifteenth time and shoos him towards the Floo with a careless hand.
Draco looks up at him from behind long, blond lashes. His eyes are grey-er. Maybe. Harry sniffs, and Draco mirrors him, cautiously lifting the tea to his pink lips, blowing, and sipping. Slowly. Harry doesn’t dare break the eye contact. Draco has more of a jaw. His hair is braided down his back.
“I’m half redhead,” Harry says dumbly. Malfoy snorts, kisses him on both cheeks where Harry knows his dimples to be, because Ginny would kiss him there, and then Dean, and now Malfoy, who is in his shower all over him. “Like you’re half veela.”
He spends the afternoon, over tiny sandwiches and tea, shaking and going over this moment with Harry beside him. Harry tells him,
Luna cuts them slices of lazy-daisy cake with “Welcome Home Harry” written on in calligraphy-by-frosting in gold, atop the coconut topping. Harry winks at Luna’s serene acknowledgement of their clasped hands, and leads Malfoy again out to the garden, sits him down on the blue bench Harry painted years ago. The green is just popping out from the ground and from the budding flowers, leaves from brown dirt. The birds are singing in the early afternoon, near morning time. Malfoy lights a cigarette and Harry watches him smoke it.
She pulls him into a hug of the same intensity she had served Harry, even kisses him on the cheek. Malfoy looks properly confused but also quite pleased. Harry swallows his giggle.
Draco is panting, and Harry stalks over to him—all he can think to do, because Draco is so skinny and needing of him, and Harry is so desperate for a piece of him, always. Draco makes like he is stuck to the door with a sticking charm, but then tears himself away and plasters himself against Harry. Warm and wet from the snowflakes in his hair and on his shoulders.
“What about a live band.” It isn’t a question, and all Harry has to do is look his way for him to nod grimly and accept his defeat.
He loves the giant fireplace, heavy with old soot and carved with vague worn creatures, the big worn table and chairs, and the dark wood cabinets. The stack of old
“It’s okay. I didn’t think about it. I didn’t, well, I didn’t mean for you to join me.”
Harry kisses him, then. He wants to eat Malfoy up, swallow him down and have him live inside of him. Malfoy kisses him back just as hard, and Harry is high on the relief that Malfoy wants him as much as he wants Malfoy. They bite each other and Harry tugs him in so close his hat falls off, and Malfoy pulls him to sit him down on the red armchair, climbs onto his lap and pulls his dick out of his purple pants.
“I feel it.”
“Familiar?” Malfoy still isn’t looking up at him, his eyes fixated on something on the floor. Harry can’t help it, reaches to lift his chin manually. “I can feel it too. My own magic, in it. It’s our magic, Potter, either we did this ourselves without knowing or something in the house… Either way, it’s not solely your fault. It’s on the both of us.”
He showers, head pounding, brushes the sour out of his teeth while staring himself down in the mirror. His cheeks are less cut than they were not four years ago, before the letter from McGonagall. His hair is longer, his beard ages him. He stares at his scars: his forehead, his chest, his hand. Everywhere else he’s been sliced open. He feels all of sixteen. Everything from then, his years at Hogwarts, is either too-bright of a memory, sharp and hot and terrible, or is clouded over with a fog of nothing. Draco is vivid, real, before him still a child, sometimes. He wonders if Draco sees him the same.
Draco’s lips are on Harry’s neck and his fingers scratch his scalp a little.
“We’ve been sleeping for a day, we have to eat. Decorum be damned,” Harry says. Draco puts all ten fingers in his hair, scratches his scalp, tilts his head back so that he can kiss his forehead. He runs fingers down Harry’s neck, sticks his joint in Harry’s mouth.
“He will.” Harry looks to Draco in shock. “What? You think Minerva hasn’t already talked about it with me? I know all about this disaster waiting to happen.”
Harry sighs.
“I am most certainly not,” he says. Harry giggles, falls forwards into his neck, both hands on velvet lapels.
Harry blanches. He hears Malfoy’s teeth clench, he thinks.
Harry laughs at him but nods.
All through dinner, Italian from Malfoy’s favorite place (which, to Harry’s pleasant surprise, hot in his gut, happens to be Muggle and not far from Grimmauld), Malfoy watches him with a kind of steady stare that makes Harry desperate to get down under the table and do him right there in the kitchen on the black and white tiles. He hasn’t bothered with setting the dining room. But he would do Malfoy there too, on the magnificent Black dining table, with Harry’s jadeite dinnerware breaking under them.
“You should be proud of this, Malfoy. It’s crazy, what you’ve done here. It’s incredible,” Harry says. He turns to face Malfoy, who is looking in one of the full-length mirrors on the walls.
“You two are insane! And disgusting! I love you for it!” Ginny screams past them, dragged off of the dance floor by Neville, who seems to be coming upon a nervous breakdown.
He starts over the next morning, after he’s finished going through all of Sirius and Regulus’ clothes he’d stashed in the attic while doing the remodel. He finds about twelve pairs of bell bottoms he thinks Malfoy will like and fit into perfectly, really just tiny little things that are much too long for Harry, he’s never been good at alteration charms, and too many of those puffy shirts and little velvet waistcoats to count. So he writes to tell Malfoy about that, to say that if he would like them Harry has them all cleaned and dust-free, hanging in the closet of the first guest room where he also keeps his dress robes, and he can come and peruse the selection if he so desires. Maybe he would have kept the clothes if he didn’t want Malfoy to come over so badly, but really, he can’t bring himself to try most of them on when he’s already imagined Malfoy inside of them.
Harry shifts, coughs. Draco blinks, and then gestures, silently, one flat, long, white hand to the chair across from him. The desk between them. Harry sits. He thinks about, well, a dark corridor, sixteen, Draco’s muffled insistence. He thinks,
He thinks that he might be coming down with something, but then again, it could always be an allergy to the oversized, bent Christmas trees that have been stuffed into every room. Gathering spaces, Granger and Minerva had agreed, needed cheer—Draco thinks it looks desperate, the baubles from the attic, silver mottled with age, remind him sharply of his childhood. Each tree is stuffed full with them. The walls are tall and close.
He’s whispering in Harry’s ear. Harry turns and his lips are met by Malfoy’s, hot and wide open. Malfoy licks the corner of his mouth. The door is wide open to the street, yet no one can see them. Harry groans out loud against Malfoy’s soft mouth, reaches back to pull his hips against Harry’s arse. He’s hard, and Harry fights the urge to drop deadweight to the floor and take Malfoy with him.
Draco was saved from making a stumbling reply by the loud pop that brought Dilly to join them in the chamber. “Harry Potter is finally being here!” she announced before moving over to grab onto Potter’s free hand. “Dilly is being so relieved.” She beamed at Potter before looking him over and then turning to look accusingly over at Draco. “Harry Potter is being undressed, Master Draco! Harry Potter should be having clothes! Master Draco cannot keep Harry Potter undressed!”
His smile grew even brighter and more malicious. “That’s easy, young Malfoy. One of you two must remain here, in hell.”
Harry’s joy faded, “He didn’t come.”
“No.  Stay,” Harry whispered back. He was lying on his side, facing where Draco was lying flat and stiff as a board.  “You said you were thinking about before?  Do you mean when I touched myself?”  Draco didn’t answer but made a small noise in the back of his throat.  “Did you hate it?” Harry asked quietly.
“Hilly is wanting to ask Sirs a question,” she asked.
“Oh!  Oh, yes!  Of course,” Harry said as he rose and brought her over to his two best friends.  He placed the baby in Hermione’s arms.  “I don’t know how I can ever repay you . . . “ he swept fresh tears from his eyes.
Draco started to move away from Harry, but he stopped him by resting both hands against the mantle.  Caging Draco in his arms.  Draco raised his hands up to push against Harry’s chest, but Harry refused to move and Draco stopped pushing when Harry began to speak, “I think you can imagine it.”
The smile slowly faded from Draco’s mouth.  His grey eyes gazed intensely into Harry’s green ones.  “I love you . . . Harry.  I never thought I would get to say that.”  Draco bent his head for a kiss, caressing Harry’s lips with his own.
Malfoy didn’t seem to have the same problem.  “Tell us the rest of it,” he insisted.
“Lucky for us we won’t need to.”  He grabbed Harry’s hand and pulled him back out the door.
He was eating a sandwich at his desk while he completed paperwork, when Robards called him and Ron back into his office.
Seeing Draco looking soft and thoroughly kissed, Harry couldn’t resist leaning in for another quick kiss.  Draco’s lips followed his as Harry drew back, and a soft groan fell from his lips.  “Hold that thought, Baby,” Harry murmured.  He took a step back and swiftly tucked his shirt back in.
Once he was dressed Potter faced Draco once again. In a surprisingly calm voice, he asked, “What’s going on here, Malfoy?”
“Of Voldemort’s,” Potter clarified.
“Wait! Granger… we need to tell…” Draco began.
Even more color flooded Harry’s face at the way the question was worded.  Looking down at his shoes, Harry answered, “I grabbed his wrist.”
Unable to stop himself, Harry moved next to the bed.  He lifted a hand to brush at his cheek, but Draco flinched away from him.  “Draco, we’re married,” he said softly.  “I’m your husband.”  Harry felt his heart breaking while he waited for Draco’s response.
Then he moved into the bathroom and took a quick shower.  When he returned to their bedroom Draco was gone, and Harry hoped he was following his instructions.  He moved to their closet and dressed carefully, putting on the Muggle suit that Draco had picked out for him to wear the last time he had to make a public speech.  With it, he put on the deep green shirt and silver patterned tie that Draco loved to see him in.  He spent a few precious seconds trying to comb his hair into submission.
“Fine!  I’ll owl my assistant.  She might know what you’re talking about.”  Harry was too exhausted to argue with Draco, but there was one point he wouldn’t concede, “Cooking and cleaning only!  We agreed, before, that no one else was going to raise our baby for us!”
When they were alone, Harry started talking softly, “Come on, Malfoy it’s time to wake up!  You know you’re crap at being ill.  And they’ve put you in one of those horrid hospital gowns you hate.  It’s not your color at all.  Come on, wake up and tell them ‘Malfoys won’t stand for this!’.”  Harry’s voice got huskier and started to break, “Baby, you need to wake up now . . . I can’t do this.  I can’t do any of this without you.  Remember, our little girl is arriving soon and she needs her papa.”  Harry’s voice dropped to a broken whisper, “I need you, Draco . . . you can’t leave me too. . .” Harry buried his head in Draco’s shoulder and sobbed.
“Draco, I mean it,” Harry insisted. He cupped one hand around Draco’s cheek. “You didn’t force me.” He leaned in and pressed a gentle kiss to Draco’s lips but pulled back before Draco could return it. “Now the talisman is signaling that we must be getting closer, and I don’t see any demons in the passage, so we need to get moving.” He nodded briskly, all businesslike, at Draco but squeezed his shoulder reassuringly at the same time.
“Sit them down over here.” She turned toward the students and indicated two nearby hospital beds.  “Good, good.  Now, the rest of you students need to head back to class.  I will take good care of Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy.  If they are still here, you may see them during visiting hours tonight.”
Dilly popped into the Malfoy library carrying a tray laden with tea, sandwiches, and fairy cakes. “Is Master Draco being hungry yet?” she asked optimistically, setting the tray down next to him.
After dinner they headed to the DADA classroom.  They were going to meet with Bill and Professor Thropwaite and find out the progress they were having with breaking the curse.  Bill got up and gave Harry a bone crushing hug as a greeting.  Malfoy grabbed at Harry’s arm, squeezing his bicep like he was going to drag him away.  Bill stepped back quickly and threw up his hands. “Sorry, Malfoy.”  Harry looked back and forth between them.  Malfoy glowering darkly at Bill and Bill backed away slowly.
Once in the bedroom, Draco crowded Harry up against the nearest wall.  One hand tight on Harry’s hip and the other on the back of his neck.  The moment stretched out as they looked at each other, their breath quickening.  Draco leaned in for a kiss but stopped with his mouth a hair’s breadth away from Harry’s lips.  He slid the hand at the back of his neck up to tangle possessively in Harry’s hair.  “I want you,” Draco whispered roughly.
Draco pulled his sticky hand off of Harry’s prick and ducked his head, blond hair falling across his face and blushing.  “I . . . I’ll see you in the morning then,” Draco said nervously, looking everywhere but where Harry sat cock out and legs sprawled still covered with come.  Then he rushed from the room calling back, “goodnight.”
Harry went down the spiral staircase, and even though his eyes burned with unshed tears, there was no bond pain at all.  It had worked.  He and Draco were no longer bonded.  He returned to Dumbledore’s office and found the Headmaster and Draco huddled together and speaking in hushed tones.  “It worked,” Harry’s words came out sounding bitterer than he had intended.  He knew he should thank Bill but he couldn’t bring himself to say the words.
Blaise threw his arm around Harry and gave him a side hug, “That’s great Harry!  We’ll have enough for our own Quidditch team in no time at all!”  Blaise’s joke seemed to break the tension and everyone was soon laughing and smiling.  Everyone but Malfoy, who was frowning and staring at Blaise and Harry.
“Well, if you do it’s ok,” Harry turned his head and placed a string of gentle kisses on the inside of Draco’s thigh.  With his left hand he stroked the smooth muscles of Draco’s abdomen, and with his right he Accio’d the tube of lube from the bedside table.  He coated his fingers in the slippery gel and then trailed them down below Draco’s balls.  He took his time and caressed the tight pucker over and over until Draco’s hips were moving again and he was making little moans.  Harry slid the tip of one finger inside and let out a quiet, “Fuck,” at the smooth heat constricting around his digit. He slid in a little further and waited until Draco relaxed around him.  When he did, Harry pulled his finger back and pushed back in, slowly but determinedly.  When he checked, Draco had his eyes closed but did not look in pain.
“No, please, tell me Draco.  Would I want what?” Harry turned his body toward Draco’s.
“Enough!” Dumbledore said firmly.  “Mr. Malfoy, what happened when you cast the Curse Detection Spell?”
“What’s going on?” Harry asked.
Ron moved quickly to Hermione’s side.  “OK, I got you,” He wrapped his arms around her and she sagged into him with a sigh.  “We’ll get you to St Mungo’s.  Harry, can you get the kids to Bill and Fleur’s?  They’ve agreed to watch them.  And send a Patronus to Mum and Dad.”  While he was talking, Ron Accioed Hermione’s suitcase.  When he finished, he stood there staring at Harry expectantly.  “Harry?” he asked impatiently.
“Yes,” he quietly hissed, still refusing to turn and look at Harry.
When they were back downstairs, he updated Draco, “The house elf will be here tomorrow morning.  Her name is Hilly.”
“God!  I love you!” Harry said as he brought their mouths together.  Slowly, he brushed their lips together, creating delicate friction.  Draco opened his mouth with a needy cry, and Harry stroked his tongue inside.  He tightened his fingers in Draco’s hair when his tongue stroked back, and he rocked his hips bringing their hard cocks to rub together.
“That’s because it wasn’t working!” Harry shouted.
Before Harry could respond, Draco burst out, “It’s Potter-Malfoy!  He’s Potter-Malfoy!  I’m Potter-Malfoy!  We’re both Potter-Malfoy, we’re married.”
“Oh, sure.  Well, we have been able to trace the magical signature on the cursed object to Advard Bulstrode,” Bill informed them.
“We should go too,” Hermione said, “We kinda dumped the kids at George and Angelina’s when we got the news you were awake.  We’ll be back tomorrow.”  She leaned over and gave him a gentle kiss on his cheek.  Ron grabbed his hand and gave it a hard squeeze, and then they were also gone.
A few hours later found Harry and Draco standing in the middle of the living room at Grimmauld Place, the baby in Harry’s arms and Draco’s trunk at their feet.  “You must be out of your mind, Potter, if you think I will spend one minute living in this sty,” Draco said disparagingly.
“I did though,” Potter replied quietly, finally lifting his head and meeting Draco’s gaze, sadness and resignation flickering in his green eyes.
Harry wrapped his hand on top of Draco’s and held it still. “You didn’t force me to do anything, Draco.” His voice was equally quiet, not wanting to risk alerting the demons to their location. “I would never have let you do this alone.” His green eyes blazed with an indefinable light as they stared into Draco’s.
“Are you in love with anyone right now?” Neville asked timidly.
Draco shook his head ruefully, “I don’t think you can help with this, Dilly. I need to find a way to contact someone who is dead, in order to remove a curse.”
“I guess they’ll be fine,” Harry suggested nervously.
“You can get another house elf,” Draco looked at Harry critically, as his eyes swept over the disaster of a living room.
“Were we friends then?” Draco asked.  He broke their gaze and looked back down at his hands that were clasped loosely in front of him.
Draco looked down at Harry solemnly, the moment stretching out unbearably.  The lump in Harry’s throat grew the longer Draco remained silent.  Fearful of what he would see in his eyes, Harry lowered his head and stared instead at Draco’s fancy shoes crushing the rose petals.  This had been a stupidly impulsive idea.  He must have misunderstood Draco earlier when they were in bed.  ‘Why the fuck had he done this when things had been going so well,’ Harry berated himself.
They walked down the hall and Harry opened the door to the pristine bedroom.  He hadn’t used this room at all, so it had escaped the baby detritus.  The room was done in all in shades of grey and silver.  Draco stepped into the room and looked around.  “This is unexpected.  It’s quite nice,” he said in surprise.
Harry couldn’t bring himself to return home without Draco so he headed over to Ron and Hermione’s, and slept on their couch.  He knew he was in the way, but the hustle and bustle of the busy household helped keep him from dwelling in his own unhappiness.  He hadn’t heard anything more from Draco.  He had owled twice but had received no reply.  He had almost daily contact with Narcissa, though.  She kept him filled in on Draco’s moods and urged him to be patient with her son.
Dilly surprised him by moving a chair over to his table and sitting herself down across from him. “Master Draco is looking for something?”
Dumbledore continued, “We want you to try and go through your day as normally as possible.”  The twin snorts that came from the boys in front of him didn’t stop him. “Mr. Weasley and Professor Thropwaite will be working on a solution.  We will keep you apprised of progress.  In the meantime, try and make the best of things.”  He sent them both a benign smile that looked out of place.  “Do either of you have any questions?”  Harry and Malfoy both shook their heads no.  “All right then, off to class with you both,” Dumbledore dismissed them.
“Yeah . . . full . . . burns a little,” he answered.  Lowering his head, Harry licked Draco’s nipple.  Then he sucked at the nub until Draco was panting again.  Draco started rocking his hips, “Merlin!  Move, Potter!”  Harry gently slid out a bit and then pushed back in, biting down on his lip to keep himself from just slamming back into the tight heat surrounding him.  Harry fucked him slowly and steadily.
Harry walked out automatically, his brain to busy trying to process his new reality.  Before he knew it they were standing in front of the door to Transfiguration.  They found seats on a bench at the back and pulled out their parchment and quills.  Professor McGonagall gave them a small nod, and then continued on with her lecture.
“Yeah,” Harry tossed back.
Draco cut him off, “Mother is waiting, Potter.”  He stepped back and motioned with his arm toward the interior of the room.
“You seem to be doing all right.  You got her to stop crying and go to sleep, and I hadn’t been able to do that for the last four hours,” Harry said as he remained sprawled in the chair across from Draco.
Normally a location he avoided like the plague, he had decided the dungeons would be the best place to cast the spell. It was already the most heavily warded place in the Manor and he planned to reinforce them. He went to the largest chamber and started casting all the protective charms he knew; anti-Apparition, shielding, and restraining.
“No,” Draco breathed out his answer.
“Honestly, Potter!  Do you even know the spell?” Malfoy pinned Harry with a dark look.
“I . . . I can’t see.  Want to see you,” Draco whispered.
Now it was early Sunday morning.  The window was filled with the grey light of dawn.  Draco was still asleep.  He was facing Harry, his right arm slung around Harry’s waist and their legs tangled together.  He looked so breathtakingly beautiful that it made Harry’s chest ache.  His pale lashes lay on his cheeks.  His pink lips were parted and slightly chapped.  His straight and slightly pointy nose fit the sharp lines of his jaw and cheekbones.  All of it put together, captivated Harry.
“Harry, there’s been a potions accident,” Robards stated grimly.
“Salazar! Potter!” Draco gasped, “I . . . I want this, want you . . . thought about it for a long time.”  As Harry kissed along his neck, Draco thrust his hips and rubbed their dicks together.  “Merlin, you have too many clothes on!” Draco pushed his hands between them and started wildly grabbing at Harry’s shirt, buttons flying off as he roughly pulled at the fabric.
“You think this is because of me?” Harry asked indignantly.  He was starting to feel very fuzzy about things, but this still didn’t seem right.
They had been at this for six hours already and still, they had no clear plan on how they would travel to the underworld, confront Voldemort and survive the whole experience. Currently, Granger and Potter were having a furious hushed conversation across the room. Draco didn’t know what they were talking about but he could surmise it from the number of hand gestures and amount of finger-wagging that Granger was using. She had arrived that morning alongside Potter, a stoic expression on her face. Her face brightened only briefly when she had entered the immense bookcase-lined room that was the Malfoy library.
In the midst of all this, Ron and Hermione rushed into the room.  “Harry!” Hermione cried, running to his side.  She was about to throw herself onto his chest when Ron grabbed the back of her shirt and hauled her backward.
“Apparently the curse was set to trigger at the death of Mr. Malfoy senior. When he succumbed in Azkaban last month, the curse was set in motion.” The Healer threw worried glances in Draco’s direction, shifting away slightly.
Harry lay on his side and examined Draco.  He was lying on his side too, facing Harry.  His face looked so much younger in his sleep, relaxed and untroubled.  His eyelashes fanned against his cheeks and his lips were slightly parted.  He had the faintest blond stubble on his cheeks.
“And don’t fucking say ‘I don’t know,’ ” Potter interrupted angrily, grabbing Draco’s arm and giving it a firm shake. “You’re the one who brought me here! What the hell is happening?!”
“Sorry, I’m ruining our date, aren’t I?” Draco was back to looking at the ground in front of him.
“Flying?” Draco was looking at him with confusion.
Harry stuffed his parchment carelessly into his bag. Malfoy had stopped to look something up in a book, so Harry left him and moved to join Hermione and Ron who were closer to the back of the room.  The trio had just reached the doorway when Harry felt a stabbing pain move through his body.  It felt almost like
Draco’s hands stroked Harry’s back and then moved down to cup his ass, then they moved up again grasping and squeezing.  When he started roughly drawing Harry’s shirt from his trousers, Harry realized his romantic plan was being derailed.  He pulled away from Draco and stood up quickly.  Then he reached down and pulled Draco up with him.  “Not yet, Sweetheart.  We have important business first,” Harry laughed softly.
Harry had seen some of these changes in Malfoy firsthand.  There was a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher this year.  Thaddeus Thropwaite had come from Ilvermorny to teach at Hogwarts.  Professor Thropwaite had decided that he would assign partners for the entire year and, of course, Harry had been paired with Malfoy.  It hadn’t been as painful as he had expected.  For one thing, Malfoy hardly ever spoke to him.  No insults, no cutting remarks, and no sarcastic songs.  When they did have to speak for class, he was polite and stayed focused on the lesson at hand.  Harry slowly started to relax around him, and was beginning to appreciate his intelligence.  It nearly rivaled Hermione’s.  But just as Harry had started to settle comfortably into the school year, weird things had started to happen that Harry could find no explanation for.
She smiled sweetly at him and said, “Dare!”
“He… he stayed.” Draco could barely choke out the words. “Voldemort required one of us to stay. And Harry…” Draco broke down sobbing again. “I have to go to him!”
After they left Dumbledore’s office, Harry had tried one more time to talk, but Draco had brushed him off and had disappeared for the rest of the day.  Harry hadn’t wanted to return to the dorm and face the well-meaning questions from his friends. So he spent the rest of the day in the Owlry with Hedwig.  After an hour he hardly noticed the smell anymore.
“I can order takeaway.  Or I can make beans and toast for supper,” Harry suggested.
“Truth,” Draco spat out.
Draco returned her hug briefly before straightening to face the healer once again. “And there is nothing to be done?”
------
“Of course!” Draco answered smoothly, ignoring Harry’s hesitation.  He reached over and picked up Al, and then turned to place her in Hilly’s arms.
“What?” Harry blinked his eyes in confusion.  This wasn’t what he had been expecting.
“Draco, you don’t know shit!  I’m not going to leave you.  I love you!”  Harry pulled Draco up to sit next to him on the bed.  “You are not that scared boy anymore.    You have done so much with your life!  You are an amazing, brilliant and caring man!”
“For what?” Draco said with a bemused expression on his face.
Draco broke Harry’s gaze and raised his wand to cast a basic healing spell, he hoped that would be enough until they could escape back into their own world and Harry could be healed properly.
“Go Draco,” Granger urged him. “We’ll stay here and wait. I’m sure Harry has a plan.”
“Always, Ted!  To both me and the baby,” Harry reassured him.
Harry’s mind raced.  Draco was upset and angry and that hurt Harry's heart, and who was it that he was in love with?  Was that the reason why the bond had bothered Draco?  Because he was in love with someone else?
“It’s not fair,” Draco clenched his fist and looked away, “so much has been taken from me.  So many years I can’t get back.”  Draco gestured at all of the many photos in the room, “All of this.  I don’t know this man.  I’m not this man, I didn’t do any of these things.  In my head, I’m still some sixteen-year-old brat.”
“Yes,” Draco’s answer was short, without elaboration.
Early morning light filtered through the curtains and fell on the pale hair of the man lying beside him.  Harry had been released yesterday, after a week-long stay at St Mungo’s, and he was finally back in his own bed.  The man in his bed was a surprise though.  He had been alone when he had fallen asleep.  Draco must have come and joined him in the middle of the night.
Harry snorted with dark humor, “Of course you like it, you decorated it!”  Draco looked back at him blankly.  “You redecorated the whole house, actually.  So if you don’t like anything, you have only yourself to blame.”  Harry moved out of the room and back into the hall.  “Al’s room is right there,” he said pointing to a door across the hall.  “And down there is the hall bath, and on beyond that is our . . . I mean, my room.”  Harry looked away from Draco.  Fuck, this was so hard to treat him like a stranger!  “Your clothes are all still in the closet.  You can leave them there if you want.  The guest room only has one small wardrobe.”
“Harry, what’s happening?” Hermione clutched his arm and looked at him worryingly.
Harry had Al laying along his thighs and was bending over her to play their game.  He rested one hand on her tummy and used the other to cover his face.  “I know I sure do.  Peek-a-boo!” Harry laughed and smiled at the baby.
“Ah!” Draco cried out and he pulled his arms from the headboard, gripping Harry’s biceps as the head of his cock popped through the tight ring of muscle.
“Fine, fine.  Whatever,” Harry replied his mind solely focused on reaching Draco as quickly as possible.  Once they were outside, Ron apparated them to the front of St. Mungos.  And then Harry was barreling inside, pushing his way carelessly through the crowd, heedless of the complaints and objections he left in his wake.
“How…? How much time does she have?” Draco could barely force the words out.
“I’m here,” he answered quietly, without elaboration.
Everyone’s gaze swung back to Draco.  Harry held his breath while waiting for Draco’s answer.
“Oh, she is perfect, isn’t she?  Hi, sweetheart.  I’m your Auntie Hermione!  And I’m going to spoil you rotten, yes I am,” Hermione spoke sweetly to the baby in her arms.  When Ron pulled Harry into his arms for an extended hug, she whispered to the tiny girl, “you have the very best daddy!  I couldn’t bear to part with you for anyone else!”
“Of course it is!”  Malfoy took another long drink and then stared down at his hands. “It’s my fault though.  I should have objected.  Made Thropplepuff change it.  Demanded to be partners with anyone but, Potter.”  He took another long drink and then passed it back to Harry.  “But I was weak.”
Draco looked up when he heard Harry’s steps.  On his face was a pained expression and it looked like he had been crying.  “Draco. .?” Harry didn’t know what to say.
Harry shook off his fear and turned to look at a solemn Rose and Hugo.  “Hey guys, we're going to go see Uncle Bill and Aunt Fleur.  Let me go get your bag and we’ll leave.”  Harry grabbed the bag that Hermione had prepacked and took the kids to Shell Cottage.
“It won’t!” Harry cupped his cheek and gently turned Draco’s face toward his, “Whatever you want, that’s what I want too.”
Draco’s hands had balled into fists in the sheets at his sides.  “Please,” he breathed, “Please, Potter!”
Dumbledore cleared his throat to break up the silence that had descended over the room. “Yes, well . . . I’m sure you both wish to get back to normal as quickly as possible.  Your trunks have already been moved back to your original dormitories.  Do you have any questions for me?”  His piercing gaze fell on each man in turn.  “Alright then, off with you both,” he dismissed them both.
Malfoy’s face fell. “No, I’m not, Potter.  Hard as that may be for you to wrap your brain around.  Not everyone believes the sun shines out of your arse.  You should’ve gotten yourself bonded to Blaise.”
“What happened?” Harry asked, looking from person to person.
“My . . . my . . .,” Harry stood as if someone had cast an immobulus charm.
“I mean, for a living,” Draco explained in exasperation.  “Unless maybe you don’t.  I suppose you’re rich enough not to work.”
“It fell over our table, and . . . over Potter and I.” Malfoy pressed his lips together in a hard line.
Harry groaned and gave into the urge to tighten his arms around his husband.  “Fuck, you taste so good,” he muttered.
Draco took a step closer towards Harry.  “You,” Draco breathed out the word, “I want you.”
“No!  No want . . . Oh, fuck!  Want you inside me!” Draco growled as Harry continued to toy with his prick.
He looked into Draco’s eyes trying to read his expression.  His eyes were a stormy grey, and they glittered with determination.  His fingers tightened, pressing into Harry’s wet skin.  Draco wasn’t moving and Harry didn’t know what to do.  “Are you mad at me?” Harry asked, still trying to figure out Draco’s mood.
Trying to control the need to slam Draco onto the bed and push into him right that minute, Harry took a deep breath and brought his hands up to cradle Draco’s cheeks.  “We don’t have  . . . have to go that far,” he panted, “we have time . . . don’t have to rush.”  Draco’s hard body pressing against his was making it hard to keep his train of thought.  Unable to stop himself, Harry buried his face in Draco’s neck and kissed a path up to his ear.
“The thought of falling asleep each night against your heart, and waking each morning in your arms . . .” Draco’s voice became rough and he paused to clear his throat.  “You . . . Atria Lily . . . our life together, it’s everything to me!  Yes, Harry.  Yes, I will marry you!”  Draco’s smile was so joyous, Harry felt tears prickling in his eyes.
Suddenly he felt flush and his heart sped up.  “Is it . . . is it getting hot in here?”  Harry pulled at the collar of his t-shirt.  Something must be wrong with the heating system all of a sudden.  He looked back over at Malfoy, his lips were pink and slightly parted.  Harry felt warm again and ripped his shirt over his head and tossed it over the side of the bed.
When the wind had died down and the light faded Draco’s knees threatened to buckle at the sight before him. There in the dungeons of Malfoy Manor stood a half-dressed and slightly pissed off Harry Potter. He was wearing only a black pair of soft cotton joggers, so low on his hips, they seemed in danger of falling to the floor with the slightest provocation. His inky locks, already a mess, were tousled further as he pushed his hand through his hair, shoving it back off his forehead.
“I think it’s time,” she said calmly.
Potter reached down and laced their fingers together. Draco knew it was just because they needed to move through the Veil as one, but it still made his heart do a stupid fluttering thing in his chest. He tentatively tried to pull his hand free, but to his secret thrill, Potter tightened his hold on Draco’s hand even more. With a brief nod in the direction of his friends, Potter turned and pulled Draco with him through the Veil.
Draco kept up a string of wordless cries and moans as he worked himself on Harry’s cock.  When Harry grabbed his cock and started stroking, Draco’s cries got louder and the rhythm of his hips grew erratic.
“I want more than that, but I’ll have to be satisfied with lunch,” he pulled Draco down to kiss him senseless.
“What?” Ron threw a quick look over his shoulder at his wife.
Harry released the snitch and they both took off.  It was all joy and exhilaration as they both flew and dove and rolled, having the time of their lives.  Two hours later, they had landed and were sitting on a small hill at the edge of the meadow.  They were both reclining back on their hands, catching their breath.  They had played three games, Draco had won two of them and had been grinning like a loon since the first win.
“Not just an Auror,” Narcissa broke in, “He’s the Head of the Auror department!  The youngest ever!”
“Don’t thank me yet, Malfoy,” Potter brushed off his thanks. “You can thank me if we both live through this.”
Draco couldn’t think… he couldn’t breathe…his mind screaming for Harry. Crack! Granger’s palm snapped Draco’s head back violently but at least he could catch his breath now. Draco looked blankly up into her face and she demanded, once again, to know where Harry was.
Harry’s reply was lost as the room was suddenly inundated with visitors.  “Where’s my newest granddaughter,” Molly asked as she and Arthur entered.
Draco’s eyes were like ice chips, as he stared Ron down.  “Yes,” he hissed.  Draco turned to Pansy to get the attention off of him. “Pansy, truth or dare?”
“Dilly is being very good at finding things,” she said with a hopeful smile.
“You mean you’ll . . .” Draco began.
Ron turned from their hug and demanded his turn with the baby.  “She has your hair Harry!” he said with a grin looking down into her face.  “And it looks like she got Malfoy’s chin,” he said chuckling.  When Harry stiffened next to him, he apologized, “Damn, I’m sorry mate.  I forgot.”
“Malfoy mucked up the spell,” Harry muttered angrily.
Before Harry could get his brain working and respond in kind, the kiss was over and Malfoy had retreated to his side of the circle.  Malfoy flashed a smug smile in Blaise’s direction, and then the game continued.  Harry spent the remainder of the game in a daze.  He couldn’t have said what happened or even what questions he himself had answered.  That night in his bed, he replayed the kiss over and over in his head trying to figure out why it had happened and what it meant.
Draco nodded, “That’s acceptable, Potter.”  He looked over toward the hallway, “Where will I be staying?”
Without a word he walked over and threaded his fingers through Harry’s.  One gentle tug later and Harry was following Draco down the hallway to his bedroom.  Or was it back to being theirs, god, he hoped it was back to being theirs!
He squirmed in his seat, but Harry did not move away. “No, that’s not what I mean… it wasn't because of your mother.” Harry looked up and met Draco’s gaze again. “It’s um… it’s because of how I feel.”
“Sorry,” Draco said looking away from Harry.
“By all means,” Draco drawled, “please continue.”
Just then, Narcissa returned to the hospital room.  “Mother!  Thank Merlin!” Draco said.  “What has happened?  Why am I here?  Potter won’t tell me anything.”
Harry heard Draco mutter, “Going to kill me.”  And then he felt Draco’s hands grasp his hips and drag him back against Draco’s body.  His back to Draco’s front.  Harry dropped the soap and reached to cover both of Draco’s hands with his own.  He pressed down, trapping Draco’s hands.  He didn’t want him changing his mind and moving away.
“Your mum?” Harry’s voice broke into Draco’s thoughts. “I almost forgot… is she…?” Harry squeezed the hand he was holding.
When the Healer left the room Draco deflated, curling into himself and letting the tears fall. Pansy sat next to him and once again held him in her arms. She stroked his hair gently and let him ruin her designer blouse.
Uilliam blew out a sigh, “I’m sorry Harry . . . we just don’t know.  Our brain scans, show normal brain activity.  His body could just be taking time to heal.”  He reached out and held Harry’s hand, “We have our next best potions expert working on this.  In the meantime, we will keep monitoring him.  We’ll let you know if there are any changes.”
He wiggled his finger seeking that little sensitive bundle of nerves.  When he found it he set up an unhurried but constant rhythm, stroking across Draco’s prostate.  He heard a loud, “Aaaaaah!” and looked up to see Draco with his head thrown back and his mouth open in a little O.
Draco glanced at the tea and then up at Dilly, seeing the worried expression on her face. He lifted the cup and took a deep drink, the beverage warming and reviving him. “Thank you,” he said softly, before reaching for a sandwich when his stomach rumbled.
Draco’s gaze flew from Harry, to his mother, to the Healer, and back to Harry twisting his ring.  “Just what is it you’re not telling me?” Draco demanded.  When he received no response from the others, Draco looked at Harry’s left hand again and then he looked down at his own hand.  “No!  That’s impossible,” he gasped.  “What in Hades, is going on here?”
“We thought we’d lost you, Mate!” Ron said gruffly.  Hermione dashed her hand at the tears on her face.
First I want to apologize for how long it has taken me to update.  I had my first experience with writer's block.  :(  Hopefully, this chapter will make up for it.  It is pure mush and tooth-rotting fluff, but I kind of needed it.  There will be one more chapter after this, and that one will have all of the smut!!  ;)
Fuck!  Harry needed to slow it down, or it would be over much too soon.  He let go of his prick, instead just tracing his fingertips over its length, swirling them over the tip and playing with his slit.   “Do you want to see me come all over myself?” he panted.
Ron had gotten the word to the rest of the family, and they soon arrived.  Bill brought Rose and Hugo to see their mum and meet their new cousin.  Andromeda arrived with both a sulky looking Teddy and a nervous looking Narcissa in tow.
“I – never wanted that,” Draco was still sitting stiffly, “but you don’t want me with you all night?”
“Yes,” Draco said slowly, somewhat dazed by Potter’s thoughtfulness and willingness to cooperate. “We can work in the library, that way we can research if we need to.”
“Okay.  Calm down Potter!” Pansy squinted round the circle.  “I’ll change it . . . Draco, just kiss Potter then.”
Draco looked at Harry intently and then tipped his glass at him, “Congratulations, Potter.  That seems to be a habit of yours.”
A grimace twisted Draco’s face as he realized that the Healer was terrified of him. Of what he might do. It was as if the past six years hadn't happened and all of his hard work to become a respected Potions Master was all for naught. Most people, like this Healer, would only see him as one of those evil Malfoys. He supposed he should be grateful that they had even come to the Manor to treat his mother.
“Malfoy!” Potter hissed angrily as he grabbed Draco’s arm and hauled him into the protection of his arms. “You can’t just go charging into that tunnel. We don’t know what’s over there.” He swung Draco into a dark shadow and pressed him against the wall.
Hermione was crouched down next to Harry, pushing his damp hair away from his face.  “It’s starting to go away,” Harry said shakily.
Harry Potter “The Boy Who Lived” at the moment was more like “The Man Who Was Totally Overwhelmed by Parenthood!”  He had taken an extended leave of absence from the Aurors.  He was currently laying on his couch crying while his daughter lay, also crying, in her bassinet nearby.  He glared balefully at the three-foot-high stack of parenting and baby care books on his coffee table.  They had been no help whatsoever.  Al, he had decided to adopt Teddy’s nickname for Atria Lily, refused to sleep for more than two hours at a time.  Currently, he had tried everything he could think of and still she was crying.  He had fed her, burped her, changed her nappy, rocked her, walked with her, wrapped her tightly, wrapped her loosely, put her down and walked out of the room (that had only lasted 5 minutes), taken her temperature, checked her for curses and spells, and nothing had helped!  He was exhausted physically, mentally, and emotionally.  So he decided just to join his daughter in her tears.
Potter firmed his lips into a straight line and glared at Draco. “If I do this, and that’s a VERY big if”—Potter put his hands on his hips, surely intending to look imposing but his borrowed clothing countering that effect—“you must agree to work with Hermione on any preparations contained in that book.” He nodded at the book Draco held.
Comprehension dawned in Harry and he knelt down in front of Teddy.  “That’s too bad, Ted,” he said slowly.  “I was kind of hoping you could, you know, help me out.  Since you’re my godson, I was hoping you would want to be her big brother.”  Harry reached out and gently squeezed Teddy’s shoulder.  “I thought maybe you could show her the ropes, y’know.  Big brother stuff.  You’d be really important!”
They left the room and walked back to their dorm without speaking.  Both of them were too busy thinking about all of the information they had been given.
Once Harry was on his side, he could hear cloth rustling and knew Malfoy was getting dressed.  They still hadn’t spoken, aside from the cleaning charm and his muttered thanks, but this was typical of the last few days.  Apparently, their morning activity wasn’t going to change this.
The soft morning light filtered through the trees and fell on both men.  Harry thought Draco had never looked more handsome.  “You’re beautiful,” he breathed out before he could think better of it.  Then he reached out and twined their fingers together to pull Draco underneath the arch with him.  “Thank you,” he said before giving him a tender kiss.
“You have me,” Harry gasped, his lips brushing tantalizingly against Draco’s.  He slid his arms around his husband and grasped at the soft material of his shirt.  “Any way you want,” he panted.  He wanted more.  More touching, more kissing, more pressure to ease the ache forming between his legs but afraid of scaring him off he was determined to let Draco set their pace. “Whatever you want . . . anything,” he whispered right against Draco’s lips, relishing the silken brush of them touching his own.
Draco slowly stood and moved next to the bed.  He placed his left hand on the mattress next to Harry’s head.  “I don’t want to hurt you,” he whispered.  All Harry could do was nod, then Draco was lowering his head and his warm lips brushed softly across Harry’s.
Every surface in his home (floors, chairs, tables, and beds) was covered with dirty clothes, both his and the baby’s, dirty dishes, half eaten food, cups of unfinished tea, and dirty baby bottles.  His shirt had stains from formula, spit-up, and at least three of his meals.  He couldn’t remember the last time he had showered.  His hair was so dirty and lank it was actually lying flat.  And he was so ripe not even cleaning charms were helping anymore.
“Harry,” she started to reply cautiously.  She looked over to Ron as if seeking an ally, “Harry, we don’t know anything yet.  He’s still being evaluated.  Why don’t you head to the waiting-“
“We don’t know that this will happen,” Bill rushed to reassure them.
A small breathy sound made Harry freeze.  What was that?  Had he woken Malfoy?  He felt the weight and warmth of Malfoy’s body roll toward his own.  Malfoy’s lips brushed Harry’s neck and his hot breath skated across it.  “Don’t stop.” Malfoys voice was low and urgent.
“Wait, Potter, stop,” Draco took the step that put him in front of Harry again.  “I’m trying . . . I am.  I want this,” he waved the frame in his hand.  He looked at Harry, his grey eyes intense and unsmiling, “I do!”
“You’re here,” Harry pointed out.  “In my bed.”
Draco let go of Harry’s hands but stayed pressed up close against him.  Harry wound his arms around Draco’s neck and rested, too depleted to do anything else.   Draco slid his arms around Harry’s back and held him tightly.  They stayed like this for a long time, motionless, just holding each other closely.  Finally, they stirred.  Draco pressed a kiss to Harry’s temple and stepped back.  Once he was assured that Harry could stand on his own, Draco turned off the water and reached for a towel.
“And Millie?” Draco had now fallen to staring at his own hands too.
The spell was broken as Draco noticed him and snapped, “Potter!  Get over here and take her!”
Bright sunlight streaming through the windows and into his eyes woke Harry the next moment.  His eyes were scratchy and sore, he rubbed at them unhappily thinking about his awful night.  His mood turned even sourer as he looked over to see Malfoy sitting up primly, a small smile on his face, sipping a cup of tea.
“Would you want?” Draco began tentatively.  “No, forget it.”
Much later, after the sun had crept cautiously into the sky, Draco found what he was looking for. Poring over these books filled with the Dark Arts had taken a toll on Draco. The Dark Magic had crackled along the edges of his own magic all night, putting him on edge and filling him with dread. Only to save his beloved mother would he put himself through this. In a book that exuded evil just looking at it, he found a spell to summon beings from the dead and enthrall them to your will. Resolutely ignoring the sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach, Draco grabbed a sheet of parchment and started carefully copying down the spell.
Silence filled the room once again, and Harry risked a quick look at Draco.  He had his head down and his eyes closed, and he looked miserable.  He needed Draco to choose him, Harry realized.  They would have to sever the bond so that they could then choose each other.  “No, we’re ready.  You should do it,” Harry’s voice came out steady much to his relief.
“The Healers will be pissed, but just for a minute,” Cassie motioned them forward, and led them through an exam room door.
As Harry took his seat, next to a stiffly sitting Malfoy, he could see a pile of everyday objects sitting on a table at the front of the room.  Thropwaite addressed the class, “Students, as you can see we will be using the trainers today.  I have written the Curse Revealing Spell on the board.  I want you to take a few minutes to practice the words with your partners.  I will be levitating the objects over to your desks.  And even though the curses placed on these objects are mild, do not, I repeat, do not touch any of these objects directly!  You will use your wands to cast the Revealing Spell and there will be no reason for you to touch the cursed object.”  Thropwaite paused to look sternly around the room. “Is that clear?”
“Sorry I didn’t mean to wake you . . . I couldn’t sleep,” Draco stood very close to the side of Harry’s bed, with his arms wrapped tightly around himself, and frowned.  He was wearing a thin t-shirt and sleep pants.
“Yeah, uh . . . yes, yes, I’ll get . . . isn’t it too early?  I mean, she’s not due yet,” Harry turned worried eyes to both Ron and Hermione.
Harry tried to sit up from where he was slouching on Malfoy but when he started to fall the other way, Malfoy grabbed his shirt and yanked him back upright.  “What . . . uh, what did you want?”
“Well, it’s fairly obvious I’d say, Potter.  We’ve clearly been cursed,” Malfoy drawled.  “It’s apparent that the American cocked it up.”
“What…? I still don’t understand. What’s this provision?” Draco placed his own hand on top of Harry’s hand that was touching him, anchoring himself in that touch.
Harry bit his lip and glanced away briefly before looking back at Draco. He took a deep breath and then spoke, “Um… well… apparently, if you agree to stay in the underworld because of… love—you are released from your promise.”
“Can Hilly be holding the Little Miss?” Hilly asked, her body leaning forward toward the baby and her ears twitching.
He and Draco had fallen into an unhappy pattern after the night he had snuck into Harry’s room.  During the day, Draco was friendly but he shied away from any physical contact.  Harry had returned to work and Draco had stayed home with Atria Lily.  He was a loving caregiver to their daughter and lavished hugs and kisses on her but none for her daddy.  Then, each night after Harry had settled into bed, Draco would come and get into his bed.  They would make love passionately, and many times Harry would blurt out his love for Draco.  But every morning when he woke up, Draco would be gone and his side of the bed was cold.
Harry stopped the first Healer he could find, “Draco’s awake, but something’s gone wrong!”  Harry returned to the room with the Healer in tow.  Draco and Narcissa were whispering furiously, but broke apart when they arrived.
“Draco, kiss the person you’re most attracted to,” Pansy directed.
“I do.” Harry started across the circle.  “I do know what I’m saying.  I’m saying, I love you.  You can be an arrogant prat, but you are also clever, funny and thoughtful.  We aren’t under the bond anymore, but I just want to be with you.  All the time.”  Harry had reached the other side of the circle.  He reached out with his right hand and cupped Draco’s cheek.  Harry’s thumb brushed gently back and forth over the soft skin.
Draco whined when Harry lifted his mouth away, but that turned into a groan when he carefully slid a lubed finger in.  As he slowly pumped his finger in and out, Harry reached for Draco’s prick.  It was practically standing up straight and had been steadily leaking on his stomach.  Draco pulled his legs wider apart when Harry pushed in a second finger and leaned down to suck at the head of his cock.  “Oh, please!  Oh . . . please!” Draco was begging again.  Harry loved being able to take him apart like this and growled in his throat, knowing Draco would feel the vibration.
“Wait a minute,” Potter complained. “It was more than dumb luck,” he grumbled.
“Mr. Malfoy, Mr. Potter, what is happening here?” Professor Thropwaite said as he rushed to their desk.  “What was that blue light?  Did either of you touch anything?”
Now that they were actually standing in front of the Veil, Draco was too numb to feel the horror and fear he knew he should. He could hear voices as he stared into the swirling depths, but he couldn’t tell what they were saying. Off to his right, Potter was huddled with Granger and Weasley. No doubt they were trying to talk him out of this, and quite rightly so. He could hardly believe it himself that Potter was willing to risk his life for him.
“Wilcox?” Ron addressed the head Healer, “How is he doing?”
Draco stiffened up and broke away from the kiss.  “I’m sorry” he mumbled not looking at Harry.
Draco sank down onto one of the settees, suddenly unable to support his own weight. “Thank you for your time. Will you ensure that Mother is made comfortable?”
“What wasn’t like that, Potter?” Draco insisted, fixing Potter with his patented ‘Malfoy glare’.
The candle floats closer, and Draco’s eyes track it as it stops over his chest and begins to tilt.
. One that he should have realised earlier that Harry was eager to break down. Why hadn’t he seen?
touching my skin, but…”
“Fuck,” Potter swears, and they clean themselves up and jump to work.
. Harry’s feeling a bit of his own, against all odds. “Do you mean your apology?”
“Hey!” Harry shouts, finally getting his feet back in gear. He charges out of the shower area, barely stopping to grab his own towel. “Feelings? You
The fit bloke Harry saw on Malfoy’s second day at Mungo’s, the one at the front desk, had been signing up for a membership, and his work schedule must align with Harry’s, because he’s there almost every day. They haven’t spoken, and their routines don’t really line up so that Harry could casually drop a hello without looking like a creep, but Harry catches him
Draco obligingly slides one finger in, not stopping until it’s all the way in, and crooks it to rub firmly against Harry’s prostate, finding that spot unerringly. “There?”
Draco scrambles up to his knees and gets behind Harry, straddling his legs and twisting the toy in
Harry’s jaw drops. “You— What? You and Hermione were talking about...what, exactly?” He crosses his arms defensively over his chest; not that it does much good, as naked as they both are.
Ginny’s ducking her way through the crowds in Diagon, headed to Quality Quidditch Supplies to check in on her broom’s customisation work, when she’s practically bowled over by Harry, who’s laughing over his shoulder as he exits Twilfitt & Tatting’s.
Harry had been finishing his undergraduate degree and was knee-deep in his thesis and applications for post-graduate study, and he’d been hunting for a specific book on the impact of long-term Dark magic exposure on inanimate family heirlooms that had their own inherent bloodline magic, and
over drinks.
Draco comes all over Harry’s hand with a sound like he’s been punched in the stomach.
Well. He didn’t, really. And isn’t that part of the problem?
“What’s the
And if Harry had managed to put away his own hurt feelings and actually
” he says dryly, then spreads his thighs and leans back into the couch. Palming himself through his joggers, he winks at Harry. “Well, then; sounds like we’re on the same page for next time. For now, though...how about you come over here and suck my cock for a while, and then maybe later on I’ll fuck you?”
“Merlin, Harry!” Draco explodes. “I
Naturally, he misses it entirely, too eager to fulfill her first request. “Harry, hand over those books, I can carry them all—I’ll go get us a table, close to the window but not too close, right? And get these all organised by author for you.”
Potter
When Harry screams that time, Draco can
Harry’s speechless; it’s not often Draco’s able to render him this incoherent, if he’s honest it’s normally the other way around, but right now all Harry seems capable of is hitched breaths and loud, unashamed moans as his hands tug hard on Draco’s hair.
Draco nearly bites through his own lip as he comes with a strangled shout, slumping back against the wall and breathing harshly. His heart is thundering in his chest, and his vision is sparking black around the edges.
He pulls out with a hiss and rolls over onto his back next to Harry, staring at the ceiling as reality crashes down on him.
Draco turns and catches Harry’s eye, and he hastily looks away in an effort to look like less of a sex pest. He hastily snatches his preferred shampoo (he can’t get anyone to tell him where they purchase it, but it’s the only thing that leaves his curls feeling soft and actually looking nice when they dry, instead of frizzy and dried-out) and sends the rest back to the shelves, then squeezes some into his palm.
I’d simply stop being your friend.”
Draco presses his lips together, but he can’t fully conceal his smile.
cook but enjoys keeping a clean kitchen, so even the division of chores hasn’t been a problem. They keep similar schedules, are fond of quiet evenings, and conduct their
Harry lets him go on, stuffing his nose into his neck and closing his eyes, drifting off to Draco’s soft berating monologue. It is never harsher than vague poetry, and the stream of his voice is more comforting than Ron and Hermione, or the voices of a Hogwarts feast, and the knowledge that he has found such a thing fills him with the heavy sands of sleep.
Harry shakes his head, as Malfoy gives a haughty
“You’re a hopeless case, Potter. You can’t help yourself from saving people left and right. It’s only right that I take advantage of that. If you’re offering.” Draco sniffs, and looks down his nose at Harry. It’s so reminiscent of him at age eleven that Harry barks a surprised cough. Something pings in his chest.
, and
“Hm?”
“Natural soul bond?” He asks. The healer is already turned to the desk, scribbling on her sheets of parchment. “What-”
“Can you taste yourself?” He asks Malfoy.
“Come back,” he says as Malfoy attempts to escape him to the hallway. “What’s wrong with you? Besides the obvious, that is. Can you, like, support me? We’re going to have to figure this out together, or else I’ll call Hermione, or someone, I need to talk about it or I’ll scream, Malfoy.”
“Shut up. They could come back-”
“Want me to snap your neck?” Malfoy asks in a whisper. His eyes are sparkling with mischief, and Harry squeezes his sides so that he yelps and almost falls from his perch. “You are horrible.”
Ron comes later, much later, too late to enjoy any part of it, right from the Ministry.
“Hey, where do you keep all of these, anyways? Like, do you bring them to Grimmauld, or…?”
Their correspondence continues as such for days.
Malfoy sobs, and Harry comes right then, so fast with the knowledge of what he’s said out loud and how Malfoy heard it.
“You are…” Harry starts. Comes back up to kiss Draco at the back of his neck, to whisper in his ear. “Everything I’ve ever wanted.”
in third year, he knew it in his bones. He could feel it in his magic, the knowledge that he was wrapped up inside of that magic and reflecting it outward. He doesn’t know if he should tell Malfoy, or simply wait to hear more from a Healer.
“You are silly. You are
“I thought we’d take them outside,” Draco says. It isn’t a question. Harry grins.
“Oh Harry, it’s so lovely. How did I forget it? We didn’t really get around to visiting and checking up as much as I think you’d wanted us to, I just trusted that your charms would hold,” Hermione says, pulling away from him and looking all around, down the hall and up at the ceiling. “So lovely. And Draco, so lovely to see you, too.”
Harry nods. He’s growing numb, and he can’t believe that his look is not a hint for the healer to drop her grin. She continues with much of the same, though.
“He really is so lovely,” she says. “And so talented at restoring vintage. Everything looks almost good as new, I’ll never know quite how he does it. You must be so proud.”
“What, Potter.”
“Fine. Fine! I’m sorry. Potter, I am sorry, so horribly sorry and regretful of everything that’s, that’s happened and everything that will happen now.”
They dance for hours, with Ginny and Luna and then, when they are really drunk, with Pansy and Percy, who have somehow formed an alliance Harry believes to possibly be more about leverage at the Ministry than Percy likely thinks. Draco does not stop touching Harry the entire time, always a finger looped in his, never allowing him to be taken by another partner. Hermione puts on Puccini, this time, to make Draco laugh, but it just makes Harry’s eyes fill and Draco smacks him gently on the shoulder.
Draco’s body knocks Harry’s bookshelf down. Harry cannot even hear the crash, his ears are ringing. He seems dazed, there on the floor, looking up at Harry in confusion but also, somehow, deep understanding and nonjudgement, as if he has been expecting this from the beginning. Harry goes into his rooms and locks the door behind him. Draco knocks, for ten minutes, muffled questions behind the door, until Harry knows he has left.
you hate me being here, I’ll just go up to the study, I could be working on lesson plans, I have many, many things I could get done in this short time you would finally be out of my hair. Trust me, there is nothing I would like more,” Malfoy snaps. Harry looks him up and down, appalled.
“Oh,” Draco says, pleasantly, when they’ve separated. “Oh.”
“I’m obsessed with you and I hate it,” Malfoy groans as he is stretching Harry open.
“I was going to ask if you’d grab me some napkins from the kitchen,” he says. Malfoy slinks out of his line of sight without a word. “So insecure.”
“Like, Seamus Finnegan. Gay, yes? But still so… like the rest of them. He wears jeans and sweaters from Malkin’s Muggle line, for Merlin’s sake. It’s all so
“Draco- ‘cmon, ‘s our wedding, can we not-”
“Was boring tonight,” Potter says. A thick cloud of smoke spills out of his mouth on the comment. Draco raises a brow in acknowledgement. “‘S getting old. Patrol. Especially ‘round Hogwarts. I mean really, with Sev up there, what’s the worst that could happen? Nothing I could prevent, that’s for sure. We’ve been thinking they’re creeping further east, now that their numbers are fewer.”
Harry shoves Malfoy into the shower before him, naked and so pliable and agreeable from exhaustion. Malfoy leans his head on Harry’s shoulder while Harry soaps him up and kisses him down.
Draco laughs a little. Harry is always so bare and honest. His stubble scratches Draco’s neck.
Harry continues to write him. He doesn’t have much to do, and since Malfoy is suddenly skeeved out or put off by Harry, Harry can think of no better way to get him back than to write him.
“You know, as a child, when I was very young, I spent a lot of time in this house.” His tone is smooth and neutral. Harry raises his eyebrows to prompt him to continue. “I would hide from the adults in the kitchen, there would always be some row that started between my father and my mother’s side. And I would see that nasty elf-”
Harry stares unknowingly at him, until a tug on his braid pulls him to his right, where Ginny is sprawled against the armrest.
“I’m so in love with you. Draco.” Potter looks back up at him. His eyes sparkle in the dark. He huffs out a hot laugh onto Draco’s cheeks. It’s embarrassing, almost. The raw honesty that the both of them have accepted in their new reality. Draco wants to live in it forever.
And then Malfoy leaves their sex-den psychedelic dreamworld to visit so-and-so who-knows-where, and Harry writes him to come back after he’s only been gone the one day.
Malfoy has a more careless air about him than he ever did in school, and a more sincere one, too. He talks almost in a whisper, his accent less posh as it had been. He leans in to Harry when he speaks, and he is wearing blue eyeliner and a little mascara. He has a single dangling earring on his left ear. He looks more himself than Harry has ever seen him, three silver cuffs on his arm over his shirt. He feels happy for him, that he seems so comfortable.
“Malfoy, can you-”
Harry ignores Malfoy, especially ignores
They fall asleep there, and when Harry wakes in the morning, Malfoy is puttering about in his tiny kitchen with the coffeemaker, humming as he makes omelettes for the two of them, and Harry feels himself falling deeper and deeper down. Far beyond the point of no return, to a place where Malfoy’s straight back and thoughtful manner have him stuck here on this couch until Malfoy himself tells him he has to leave. He can feel it in his chest, like a string connecting them there, tied in little bows around their hearts. Malfoy is right- he can’t move for being corny.
“You alright?”
“It’s from a cousin,” Draco says airily, and offers no more. Harry frowns, but lets it be. All these fashion secrets. He can’t stop looking at the flush on Draco’s cheeks. “We look good.”
“How do you mean,” Harry says.
“Potter-”
When they grocery shop, Malfoy leans over Harry against the cart, now, his nose in Harry’s hair as he reaches to the shelves, his warm front pressed against Harry’s side. It’s thrilling, it's so much closer than they had been before, and Harry had thought he had it good, then.
on the chair in the corner grows by the day, and no-one really thinks to throw them out. Granger often leaves tomes on the counters, leaving Kreacher despairing whenever he and Potter start on dinner.
More stupid comments, and Malfoy is laughing even harder, pressing fingers beneath Harry’s cheekbones and rubbing up against his teeth through his cheeks. His palm cups beneath Harry’s chin, and he kisses him wet and uncomfortable right under the showerhead.
He drags Harry to the big bathroom on the third floor, the one they share with Weasley and Granger and Ginny and Luna and Neville, all the
“Potter. I’m serious. Give me time to think,” he says. Harry leans up, tries to kiss him again. His dick is growing harder under Malfoy’s sharp arse. Malfoy puts a hand over his lips to stop him. Harry licks his palm slowly, back and forth, as he waits. “I’m going to think about it.”
Malfoy turns back to face Harry, pulling a cigarette out of the top of his leather boot. He stuffs it in his mouth hurriedly and lights it with a snap of his fingers. He closes his eyes to take a drag and a little line Harry has never seen before manifests between his eyebrows. Harry waits.
“Oh my god, oh my god, Potter,” Malfoy says hotly.
And then Harry’s fingers are pulling down his trousers and his pants and he’s biting the dimples above Draco’s arse and Draco sobs, involuntarily, but he isn’t ashamed or surprised by himself. He just
,” Malfoy says. His voice is high in his throat. He reaches to take his wine back from the coffee table as Harry sucks at his underwear. “And you’re good. And you want me.”
And as Harry sits patiently, listening to the two of them fawn over the academic aspect of Harry’s recent dramatic life-changing event, he realizes that this may just be his new reality, until the day he dies. And he doesn’t hate it.
somewhere between the battle and when he had first seen her, interviewing. Four years ago. She needn’t have worried. Harry is here, isn’t he.
“Mixed. French and English, too,” he says. Malfoy’s long fingers circle his wrist and take his hand. He hums.
“Come to my house,” Harry says. Malfoy shivers. Harry can feel him hesitate, but then he nods. The way Harry’s spine lights up with shivers at his response almost makes him laugh, who would have thought. Him and Malfoy. Maybe there was something in the cake.
“Thank you,” he says, and Draco sees his eyes brim a little. He gently lifts Harry’s hair and twists it into a bun atop his head.
“Missed me?” Harry laughs as Malfoy rolls his eyes.
“Would you like a biscuit, Potter?” His words are clipped, like he is stopping himself from saying another thing.
“Lovely. Just lovely, really, everything’s going well at work and I’m quite busy but you know, aren’t I always,” she says.
They are walking down the street with two large duffel bags of clothes, and some hanging on hangers as well. Malfoy laughs down at him.
. So much like his parents. Dead with a baby at twenty-one. Harry and Draco, something like twenty-six years later, teaching children what Harry often wishes they would never have to know.
Malfoy jumps apart from him so quickly Harry’s lips feel cold, but Harry scoots over closer to him for the rest of the lunch, so that their thighs are touching, Harry’s yellow and green seersucker pants beside Malfoy’s soft grey. Hermione’s laugh gets more and more relaxed as time goes on, and when they leave Ron thumps Malfoy on the shoulder in thanks.
“Whatever you want,” Harry says. He pulls away. “Anything you want.”
“And so, I said to my mother that I would despise having a family house like this one. So dark, and dreary, and horrible. And I’m certain that’s why you haven’t had any trouble in doing all of this work to it. I simply did not accept it as entrusted to me. So you could have it entrusted to you with no warring claims whatsoever,” Malfoy says. His words are softer from three glasses of wine, and his nose has that delicate red flush to it. Harry has been waiting for him to Floo, even though he hates him, and hates the things he says, and hates how he could possibly be a professor with this attitude. He wants to smack him, even though he can’t tell if Malfoy is being nice or mean. He can’t tell if he is flirting or simply bullying Harry, has lost the plot totally.
“We have to talk about why it hurts so much for me to be apart from you,” Malfoy says. Harry jerks to look over at him, sitting in the green armchair, reading glasses at the end of his nose. Harry opens his mouth but nothing comes out, like he’s a fish out of water. “I mean physically, you dolt. I can feel a pull, here. I realized it this morning, about what was happening at the restaurant. You said you were sick, too.”
“I am so not,” Harry mumbles. But Malfoy’s hands in his hair are getting him hard, as anyone’s hands would. Harry swears it to himself. His scalp is just sensitive. And if Malfoy gets him on his knees in front of the loveseat in a matter of seconds later with just his fingers showing Harry the way down, down, down, it’s just because he likes to be touched. Harry is a stupid girl, on his knees with his hands on Malfoy’s strong, wiry thighs and his lips kissing Draco’s dick through his underwear. He always wears what look like antique high-waisted panties. Harry can’t get enough of it, the creamy lace against his cut hips. Harry worries that his pants might rip- Sirius’ orange bell bottoms, groaning beneath his knees on the floor.
“Because I’m the Chosen One?”
“Couldn’t dress up for me?” Malfoy asks. Harry rolls his eyes. He turns to make his way back to the kitchen, assuming Malfoy will follow, but Malfoy’s long fingers pull him back by his loose collar. Harry falls back into him, feels all of him against him. “Potter.”
Now, he knows that if there is petty conflict the bond will cast over it like a cool river. Harry finds it soothing already, to have something there connecting him.
morphs into
Harry’s groan breaks into nothingness, and then Draco is pulling his unbelievably hard cock out of his pants and boxers and lubing him up wandlessly—and Harry doesn’t breathe the whole time that Draco jerks him off slowly. Harry is still in his jeans and his boots. Draco is all done up in everything. And then Harry comes all over him, between the two of them, onto his white t-shirt and Draco’s long black robes. Draco makes an aborted, desperate sound, cut off by Harry’s mouth.
for, and I am not exaggerating,” Malfoy says, and he is wearing a faint smile that seems to be the most genuine one Harry has ever seen. He wants to kiss Malfoy badly, then, and doesn’t know if it would be too much, too romantic, if he feels like he is a little bit in love with him.
“You are. I love you. Say it.”
“It’s funny, when you think about it, how we ended up being the same kind of person,” Malfoy says, on a Sunday. They are sitting on the back porch, which had been the last thing for Harry to repair. He had stained it dark, like the wood of the big kitchen table. It is getting a little cooler than most Augusts, and September seems to be coming up quite fast.
“Well, it’s. It’s all fairly new,” Harry says. Malfoy smirks around his cigarette and places a green jumpsuit on the pile Harry assumes he is taking.
“Fucking shit, Potter. You are a piece of work. I do declare,” Draco mumbles around the cig. Harry giggles and decides to let the ‘Potter’ go. “You’re lucky I’m sticking with you because I’ve neared the end of my rope time after time. A bloody eccentric…”
is resting back against a sunny wall. The cottages’ low-hanging eaves and dried flowers suit Malfoy, Harry thinks. Perishes the thought. In having last seen him near seven years ago, his face has almost sharpened, but filled out all the same, his roman nose seems either sunburnt or flushed drunk.
“I have everything set up in the living room, didn’t bother with the dining room, sorry,” he says. Ron crosses to grip him in a tight embrace. “Great to see you, mate.”
He’ll analyze his reaction later, once Malfoy is gone again.
Harry puts his round sunglasses up in his hair, squints over at him. He is reading the
One evening, on the walk back from Hogsmeade, Draco slips his hand into the crook of Harry’s elbow, and Harry lifts his forearm to support it without thinking. The trees around them are groaning with recent snowfall, and the shrieks and laughter of the students behind them has Harry’s stomach warm.
Harry nods.
, as if Harry
Harry has taken to wearing Sirius’ leather jacket over his sweaters and scarves, has grown his beard and hair out a bit with the oncoming winter. He sees Draco’s sweeping looks over him, he sees those grey eyes fixating on his chin.
, and he bites Malfoy’s shoulder hard enough that he yelps.
“And you, well. You were a part of it, why I thought I would be alright coming back,” Draco says. Harry smirks.
“Writing?” Malfoy asks, sneaking into the parlor as always. Harry nods, sends Ron and Hermione’s barn owl out the window with his response. “Who to?”
“That’s exactly why I’m not too sure,” he says. “It’s much too late, anyways, term has already started-”
“It’s convenient. And nice, Ron,” he says. He has to ignore Malfoy’s little choking sound too, but he knows Hermione is analyzing their every move. “I like him.”
“You turn me on,” he says. Malfoy rolls his eyes. “I like that you’re good at things. I like that you’re cool.”
Harry stops himself. Draco raises soft eyebrows and possibly a corner of his mouth in question. Harry snorts, and all of it is broken to pieces, and something cracks inside of Harry’s chest like everything outside of him has gone right into place. It is an odd feeling, but not uncomfortable. Draco’s lips pull into the smallest smile. His cheeks are going pink. Harry watches as he laughs harder, deep in his belly, Draco’s hands as they twist on his desk and are then moved to his lap.
“Hey, ‘Mione. How are you?” He asks into her hair. She and the house smell like cooking and cleaning, but also like parchment and ink and the halls of the Ministry, and her essential oils that she’s been using as perfume since fifth year.
Draco nods, and Harry looks into his eyes when he pulls away. They are grave, wise. Knowing.
“I suppose you can mooch off me,” he says. Draco flushes in the candlelight. “Hey—”
“I just say that because I have
Draco hasn’t gotten used to Potter’s casual nickname usage where Severus is concerned, but he, as always, tucks it into the corner of his mind where he keeps the things he’d rather forget. He nods and takes the final drag of his first cigarette. He’d been speaking with Granger on the same hypothesis.
, you see. By the Skeeter-types.”
They spend more time in the back garden with the sky black-orange from the city lights all around them. It’s strange to hear the sounds of cars going by knowing that they cannot be seen. Draco has gotten used to the near constant wail of sirens, and the stink of the sewer in the summer. But he likes winter best, even despite the darkness always creeping at the edges of his vision. So much agony to be found in such a populated place; dementors have a field day in the skies above London. There’s been record snowfall, Granger won’t stop saying.
“But Malfoy. Hey,” Harry is watching him as he dithers at the coffee machine. He is still wearing his wide-brimmed hat. “Come here.”
Draco had suggested he put on a sweater, or a jacket. Potter had looked down at himself in genuine surprise.
Draco is in a tizzy before the party starts, all day he had been running back and forth between the front and the back of the house, perfecting the fairy lights in the back garden and setting the tables himself, absolutely refusing a helping hand, and then later showering for what seems like hours, and then Harry gets his dick in him for a while and shuts him up which is lovely, except that he then has to shower a second time.
. But Draco bites his bottom lip too hard to not be making a point, and when Harry obediently backs up from him Draco flicks his wand and all of the buttons are undone. Harry strokes a hand beneath Draco’s black sweater, the soft soft fabric of the shirt beneath catching on his dry fingertips. And then, the hot of Draco’s stomach. Hard and ridged, like Harry always knew it would be. Skinny and ripped, tiny and just for Harry. His fingers reach beneath the waist of Draco’s pants.
“Well,” Draco says. “That’s that, then.” He nervously pats his lap in finality.
, has made him breakfast and drank his coffee and read all his mail from McGonagall, he shows Malfoy the pond out back.
“Watch, Potter,” he snaps. Harry watches the spell between them, bright electric purple and pulsing. It makes his eyes ache, but he can’t look away now that he’s paid attention to it. A hot pink, fuzzy waving line travels between them, snapping like lightning and dropping up and down, up and down. Harry’s eyes nearly cross trying to follow it.
When Hermione and Ron finally arrive, Harry forces Malfoy to come with him and greet them at the door. He can feel him dithering beside him before he pulls the door open, but once it has opened and Hermione is in his arms, he knows Malfoy has composed himself to the utmost. He can see Ron shaking Malfoy’s hand enthusiastically from around Hermione’s hair.
“So, put some rose petals on the bed for when he comes back, light some candles, you know, he seems like he would like that,” she says. Harry groans and tips his head back to stare up at the ceiling. “Harry.”
The kids love Draco, despite being terrified of him. Harry loves to watch them give their two professors a wide berth when they make their way to the Three Broomsticks on Hogsmeade weekends. Harry wears Doc Martens boots Hermione had gifted him for Christmas five years ago in the snow, never minding how little they really do to warm his toes. Draco wears all of the same. Pointed leather shoes charmed to repel the cold. But stares at Harry’s feet, too.
“Potter,” Malfoy says. His voice is vibrating with warning. He turns to face Harry. “I swear to Merlin.”
“You want one?” Potter asks. He’s taken to engaging Draco in conversation at every opportunity. Especially when Draco craves silence. His voice is deep and cracking around the smoke. There’s a bit of tinsel on his broad shoulder, likely from brushing against the hallway decorations on his way in from patrol.
“Get in me Potter, get in me, hurry, I can’t last forever you fuck, been waiting all day for you to get in me,” Malfoy says, babbling. Harry ignores him for as long as it takes him to calm himself down so he won’t explode from head to toe, then lubes Malfoy up with a gentle pat.
A failed mission, something at the Ministry with Umbridge and Potter is storming through the hall to a harried Draco, who waits for him despite all his rationale begging him to remain upstairs, to not be in the way when the next best course of action is always to debrief. His hands cup Draco’s cheeks and Draco’s mouth has already fallen open, his eyes bore into Draco’s. His nose is bleeding all down his neck.
“I brought liquor,” she says, kissing Draco and then Harry on the cheek, shoving the bottle of fancy gin into Draco’s hands. He nearly coos at the sight of it, and Harry sends Ginny a grateful look. She smirks at him as Draco exclaims over how impossible it must have been for her to get it, however did she manage?
“What if you set the dress code terms, then,” Harry says. It distracts him long enough that Harry can start a pot of coffee and order pizza for dinner.
But- really, something about it feels like it came from the two of them, something about the magic feels familiar and comfortable. Harry has dealt with cursed objects, has fought their magic off and placed them behind magical barriers without trouble while his classmates passed out or vomited onto their desktops. He’s experienced magic that tries to control him, he is immune to the
Draco finally laughs, a little huff that makes Harry’s heart jump in his chest. The bond thrills at it, like Draco has thrown it a bone. He nods and Harry pulls him down, onto the low couch, settles his head on the pillow and lies atop him, to the side so he doesn’t crush him. He kisses him slowly, presses his lips to each thin eyebrow.
“Potter. I know. It’s all right.” Malfoy looks up at him, pushes up to his hands and kisses him chastely. “Thank you for trying to valiantly to preserve my innocence and coveted privacy.”
“Well. My, my. Whatever will I do about that.”
Draco likes Hole better than Nirvana. Harry wants to touch him. Draco plays
“I know. I mean, I’d gathered. It seemed private, and, that’s a bit why I didn’t ask, because you had never invited me here, and-”
, and Harry in the dim room is willing to give. Draco will receive all of it.
“Harry, you know most Muggle artists are really wizards, yeah? Half-bloods, usually.” Draco grins lopsidedly, and Harry can suddenly see it, the resemblance.
you keep talking, you wear fucking
Eva disappears almost immediately, and comes back with a tray of gin and tonics with a charcuterie plate. She sits beside Harry on the low couch and hands him a drink.
And if the next morning, when Draco has gone to bed and everyone has gone home, Harry sends off a quick letter to McGonagall, Draco will be none the wiser, fast asleep with his eyeshadow smeared down his cheeks and his lips soft and open.
“Orgasms? I like to fuck you,” Harry says. Malfoy scoffs, that piece of hair falls between his eyes. He squints over at Harry from the counter. “But seriously. I like you. And I hate you, a little. But can we stop pretending we’re sixteen? I’m trying to put all that behind me… being as you’re here, and all…”
Harry thrills in being back home full-time, being in a place of his creation instead of his thin-walled apartment in Cairo. He feels so spoiled by space, and color, in a place so radically different from anything the Dursleys would ever even

George comes up to Harry and Draco immediately, firewhiskey in hand, and claps Draco hard on the shoulder. It seems unforgiving, Draco winces and Harry chokes down a laugh.

Harry likes that they’ve all become teachers, and helpers, how they’re all scrabbling to make something better out of what they’d left destroyed, what their parents destined to be ruined for them. Something about Malfoy like this makes his heart explode. He knocks his socked foot against Malfoy’s red clog.
“Technically, they’d be at least one-fourth redhead any way it’d go,” Harry says, earning a quick spank from a damp hand. Harry squeals, shamefully, and Malfoy wheezes a long laugh. “But, no, not Weasley-wise. No.”
“You’re insane, Potter.”
“Thank you, ‘Mione,” Harry says gratefully. The bell rings, then, and Harry turns quickly to let Luna and Pansy in.
