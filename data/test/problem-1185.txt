Scorpius is what had kept him from giving up. From ending it all and letting his mother deal with his late fathers mess alone. Not that he had the gut to end it himself. He would’ve thrown himself in the death eater hunting party’s arms, they had a special grudge for him it seemed. Probably had to do with his father… and what he’d done in school because of the man. His mother? shed moved on Pretty much, they hadn't been together for long after the war. She went remarried another ex deatheather that had also survived the huntings. he send her letters the first few years but that had long since stopped too. As far as Draco knew, she didn't know or wish to know what Scorpius looked like.
“What?” Padma blinks, looking up from her astronomy picture book.
Ron pouts, “That’s different! It’s best girl-friend and best boy-friend.”
why,” Ginny points a finger at Draco the way her mother taught her
The recess brings most of the court into a better mood than before, though a good number of them are sticky. After a brief, tizzling discussion on whether or not they should break for a quick washing up (which evolved into whether washing up meant going home to their bathroom sink or being hosed down by the garden hose,
Harry shakes his head. “Draco needs to…needs to be tried in a fair and just manner!” He gestures to Hermione, who is sitting in a grown-up chair at the card table he set up earlier that morning with his mum. The young girl looks very pretty in her new Senegalese twists and Mary Janes.
Draco’s blush definitely shows up on his skin.
innocent,” Ron starts, before turning to Hermione again. “
Lily nods, cackling. “That’s what I call justice!”
“It’s possible.” She taps her chin with her index finger. “But I think she’ll be more biased towards one of them. Best not to risk it.”
A little scowl, upset at having to repeat it. “I trust you.” He’s still mumbling, but this time Harry hears it. He breaks out into a wide, shining grin that makes Draco’s tummy feel funny.
“I didn’t know Tonks was secretly posh,” Ron whispers to Parvati. “Or is Draco secretly poor?”
his family is. “It’s good.” He looks at Harry. “It is! It’s nutty and a little savoury--”
” Parvati adds.
The other children murmured in agreement that it’s a shame that such a good flavour of ice cream was lost, regardless of what happened to it.
Draco shrugs.
“Charlie is smarter than that,” Hermione says, though internally wondering if he wasn’t.
Harry, sensing Draco’s growing discomfort, rests a hand on his shoulder. “You don’t have to tell us if you don’t want to.” He knows, of course, his uncle Sirius was talking about it the other day with his mum.
Harry, thankful that his blush doesn’t show through his skin, scratches the back of his neck. “Thanks, Hermione.” He clears his throat, trying to sound professional, “Let’s go back to the trial.”
“Hey, guys! What are you playing? Can I play too?”
“Yeah.” Harry scratches the back of his head. “I’m not good at this stuff…” At all. In a few years’ time when studying metaphor and allegory, he will noogie his own head in frustration.  “But having more than one best friend is real!!” He points a finger to Draco, deadly serious. “I wouldn’t lie.”
“Ew!” Ginny giggles, “Nuts? In ice cream? Like peanut butter?”
Ice cream seemed to be a trigger word for all of them, and they cease their rioting in favour of excitedly asking about fancy flavours with Mrs Draco’s mum, or asking about her cool spy car and if she knows James Bond.
“I know.”
The blond boy gulps.
“Yes.” Harry nods without hesitation, causing Ron to gape and Draco to perk up hopefully.
It’s a bit of an odd concept for Draco, to say the least. His father has a best friend he sees rarely (Draco was told to address him as
” See? “Why should I have only one?” He
Two: Vincent gets up to fight Colin. Draco was a lot of things, but an ice cream stealer was not one of them. At least, not behind others’ backs. If this little pint-sized nugget was going to talk smack about his friend, then it was his duty to punch him, right? If only Greg was here, then he’d have another to do this with (thankfully though, Pansy is at home, because Pansy would have scalped Colin for this).
“Tonks is your cousin?” Ginny tilts her head, suspicious. “But she’s so
“What does that have to do with anything?”
Not a bad record. Usually, he had to promise to kiss grandmother Druella on the cheek without any fuss, pick up his toys, and offer to take Dobby on more walks.
“If Tonks is your cousin, she’ll take your side,” Hermione calmly concludes, “It wouldn’t be fair.”
Seven: Ron is shoved forward by Ginny into Harry, but in his distracted ranting, he assumes that Harry wants to wrestle him, and enthusiastically begins to fight.
“No, you can’t!” Ron wibbles, terribly betrayed, tiny fists closed tightly.
” Harry flushes, ever grateful that it couldn’t show up on his skin. “We’re in public.”
“Well then… that was surprisingly nice, for hanging out with Gryffendors.”Malfoy smirked as Harry helped him onto the sofa where he curled himself up and summoned a blanket.
“Potter, I stole something from Longbottom and flew away with it just to get your attention and impress you with my flying skills. “
“Fainted and tripped off the altar, he was holding my hand and pulled me with.” Hermoine snorted.
After a few moments of silence Malfoy opened his mouth. “I….” he seemed at bit of a loss. “I agree. I didn’t think you would be willing to allow them. The Malfoy name isn’t exactly good nowadays…” He looked at his drink. Wishing he had poured more than half/half. “What about Ginevra?” he asked, trying not to let his insecurities shine through.
And so, but 6pm he had arranged everything. Taking his bird and just some essentials, as well as a spell book focusing on finding spells. Hoping there would be anything to help them find Potter and his stupid antics. Who disappears from home like a moron. Leaving your kids with such worries. What would the press think?
“That.. just tell us.”
“that was you! You didn’t pull up. I am just very competitive and…”
“I still can’t believe you never went into the professionals league Harry. You have the natural talent for it. Weren’t you asked to join the leagues?”
“Hermoine you’re awfully silent. You talk some sense into him. He’s losing it.”
“You fainted?”
“All you have to do, is sit straight, elbows low, heels low, just your toes in the stirrups and follow the movement of the horse. I’ll do the steering” Draco said, looking back at him. The puffiness of his eyes was gone.
“You were just a dumbass” Potter snorted. “Its fine. You got me into the Quidditch team. It was a fair trade off snob.”
Harry, as dull  and pissed as he was, just smiled and answered. “Oh ya know. The boys. They became friends and Malfoy being a right git thought I wouldn’t like that. It started with a dinner and ya know… he’s an alright git nowadays. I wasn’t obsessed. I was suspicious.”
“I dare ye, to take a shot with me mate.”
“Typical Weasley, worried little creatures really.”
“That’s quite a lot to remember Malfoy.”
“Shut up.” Draco immediately shut his mouth.
“oh shoo, you kept distracting me.”
“They’re right Draco. The Weasley is right. It could make a difference. Even for your son.” Blaise said, speaking for the first time this morning. Surprising everyone.
“Fuck off.” He barked. “Stop it. Stop hurting him. Let him go.” Harry’s voice trembled slightly. A soft sigh of relief leaving him when Malfoy’s face calmed again.
An owl and a raven later and plans were made to meet in one of the bars at diagonally. Both seemed rather happy to hear from Malfoy. Even Pansy, who used to be as cold and stoic as he’d been, had written him a long heartfelt letter about how not a day passed where she didn’t think of him. How much she missed him but didn’t want to be pushy until Draco was ready to meet her again. How much she regretted their argument.
“Right. You’ve both lost your bloody minds.” Ron put his hands in his hair, shaking his head.
He heard a bunch of chattering approaching. Potter and his fan club. Draco snorted. “Enjoying yourself there Potter?” He asked, getting glares from their old classmates and their spouse.
“I don’t care you are telling me what is up so I can return him like a lost dog Weasley. Its not just your Kids upset. Its mine too.” Malfoy hissed, that was the final straw for her to just let him in.
So he thankfully grabbed his cigarette and made his way over to the court. Grumbling softly as he lit it. Huffing out some of the smoke as he looked around. it was fairly dark already but draco could clearly make out how much even this spot had changed, there was far more green around than before. The old waterspuwing gargoyle in the middle had a lovely flowerbed around it, some of the broken pilars had creeping Figs on them, they bore a poisonous looking purple fruit. Which was actually quite good for eating as long as you asked if you were allowed to take it first. If you didn’t do that you’d end up with festering purple blisters. Truly no fun.
“So, you go up to that guy, Neville Longbottom. Genius with the plant life we’ve got. And the big bulky guy over there, with the beard? That’s Hagrid. Now I personally cannot go up to that man because we never got along, incidents with one of his animals. But I am certain he’ll tell you everything you want and don’t want to know.” Draco hummed, sending Jackson off on his own after feeding him as drunk as he could get him without being beaten by Pansy. Smirking he watched him stumble over.
He woke up late. About 2 hours Later than his usual 7am standard. Scoffing slightly. Lovely. Now he needed to hurry up. He freshened up, finally taking his well deserved shower, dressing up into something clean and setting everything up he needed for the spells. There was one spell that would leave him be able to detect Potters magic for a while. But he needed something that connected them.. thank the old Norse gods for his blessed Bird. Who had bitten the both of them, drawing blood.
“So how did you two end up you know.. together. I know you were quite obsessive over Malfoy sixth year but this.. I don’t know if I’ll ever get used to this.”
He didn’t speak much after reading the letter. Perhaps it was the binding spell making him this upset. Perhaps it was really his feelings of gratitude and fondness of Malfoy. He didn’t know. All he knew was that he would have to find Draco and make it up to him. He missed him.
Draco nudged Harry under the table, startling him. He held up two fingers to his face. Harry snorted. “I need some air. I’m gonna catch a quick smoke. You Joining?” Harry said, loud enough for the others to hear. Was this how they were now? Did they have little signals for when they needed a break? Harry couldn’t say he minded.
Blaise, for once seemed to be caring too. Not the “I could care less, I was forced to go”  Blaise he normally was. He actually seemed excited to go.. He had taken a young witch with him, the bastard, she clung to his side like he was god himself.
“I don’t plan on leaving.. it’s all fine by me, being close to you that is. But I am glad you’re willing to sacrifice that. if you change your mind. Let me know. we can work this out.”
“Dear H. J. Potter,
Normally when Draco entered a place of magic, it gave him a little warm chill. Magic had a warm and welcoming feeling over it. It was almost overwhelming now. Constricting him and tightening his chest, squeezing at his heart, uneasy. Potter wasn’t here. Potters magic was close however, it was drawing him like Moths are drawn to lamps. He took a step into that direction, and immediately it made him feel less constricted. Definitely Potter. He took Skadi up. “Lets go love.” He hummed, grabbing the bird and making his way outside. The closer he got to the location, the more dreadful and empty the streets became. Something definitely wasn’t right.
Letting out a deep sigh he went to the kitchen, grabbing some sliced beef he was supposed to use for dinner tomorrow. Figuring the Raven would enjoy some after a flight from wherever Draco seemed to live nowadays.
“So Potter. I suppose that’s it huh.”
“I will, don’t worry.” He gave her a rare genuine smile before leaving.
Next was Pansy who let Ron paint her nails, he did a bloody awful job and she glared him down. Hermoine told them the longest she had ever spend on an essay on end was 8 hours straight before she passed out and collapsed.
He opened his eyes, relaxing in his seat, eyes running over his surroundings when suddenly…
“Could do with a little break. How bout you Malfoy?”
“I hope so..” Harry sighed, looking at him. Only now did Draco see how tired he looked. Drained and sucked empty.
“Sounds good, don’t bother cooking well for Potter. He has zero taste, you could plate the poor man a rat and he’d thank you for it.” Malfoy smirked.
Skadi seemed fine with whatever. She hadn’t bitten him since the first time and truth be told. Draco had grown very attached to her over the past few weeks. she was quite the personality to have around. seemingly understanding his every word and trouble. She had taken to bringing him “Gifts” when Draco had a bad day. Gifts  consisting of twigs, stones, the cap of an old beer. Worthless. But she insisted he appreciate it and applauds her for her great sacrifices.
By the time he came by, he felt a lot better. Something familiar seemed to be pulling him closer. A happy memory, something that made him feel so much more at ease, forget about the torture for a moment. He couldn’t help himself but smile as he felt it getting closer. Not knowing that whatever it was. Was walking right into the enemies arms.
“Fair enough. It is a Weasley house after all. Now I know its  big ask from you. But could you get these washed really quick. I’d rather not apperate butt naked, reeking like a drunk nights out.”
He nodded along the conversation the whole ride there. Not really listening to what his friends were saying, they eventually understood and quit asking him things, letting him nap the remaining two hours.
{ this is a short filler chapter. i sadly havent felt as motivated to continue on this story. I will try to update you as soon as possible}
Nights like that.. when they fell asleep together, whether it was on purpose or on accident, were the best. Harry usually woke up first. Watching Malfoy like this would be the last time he would see this, before getting up. Making the two of them a somewhat decent breakfast.
“oi that’s not fair, at least do be creative Weasley.”
“No one would ever want me on their team Finnigan. I am the embodiment of evil. And Potter couldn’t take losing too me all the time.” Malfoy snorted.
“To be honest no. They’re still the same. Giving me puppy eyes. Acting as if I saved them all. I don’t like it.” The other sighed long, looking out over the woods.
“It’s ok to be afraid of something Draco. Even if it’s the purest beings on earth.”
“How dramatic..” Draco couldn’t hide he was taken aback a bit. He knew his past would follow him.. but this much? Even the media was following him as soon as he got there? He shook his head.
“That’s too easy. I’ve got enough embarrassing moments. Worst is probably fainting on my own wedding day.” Ron snorted.
Somewhere along the lines as they got to the dinner itself (which was a lovely cooked chicken, stuffed with mozzarella, wrapped in parma ham with a side of homemade mash). The topic of doing stuff together came up.
Like the 14 year old watching helplessly as Voldemort killed Cedric, the man that couldn’t properly love his kids because he felt he hadn’t deserved them.
Severus and he.. Severus had always entrusted him with everything. He never took much of his advice to heart but he respected the mans wished. The only reason he was hesitant that night, the night Dumbledore died, was because Severus would die in Draco’s place. And at that point, Draco already wanted nothing more than death.
“He has been, he’s told me he hasn’t been able to give his children what he wants to give them. what else.” He raised an eyebrow at her.
“Shut it Potter.” He heard a deeper voice. New guy.
Draco snorted. “Good Bird” he chuckled, patting her little head as he carried her to the bird room. He’d send off Daisy this morning so she had the place for herself.
But… tragic backstory and life events aside. Today was the day. An anxious, nerve wracking day he was sending his little boy to school. Facing a lot of his past enemies.  Thanking Merlin for his panic and anxiety medications as he walked around. Ah.. the first group of Weasleys walked past. Practically spitting in his direction. Thank god for Scorpius and his incredible ability to ignore everything. Either way, he held the boy close. Keeping his eyes on the kid..
“I grew up around them. I have taken the liberty of finding you a pair of horse leggings and you should fit my helmet. We should hurry. Its getting late.” Malfoy smirked at him. Harry was most definitely in for a ride.
“We did kind off I suppose. How are you holding up Jackson?” Draco changed the subject. Listening to Jackson ramble on about the ceiling and the floating candles. “You should take him to the greenhouse tomorrow, and to the ground keepers hut. I saw a whole lot of pens out. Hagrid must’ve gotten more animals.” He mused, watching Jacksons eyes light up more.
“I asked on what terms. Do you want me to like.. pay you rent? I’m assuming Grimmauld place would be a better option than my tiny apartment here.” He asked, slightly annoyed.
“What do you mean.” Harry asked.
Once finally in, she silently sat him down in the living. Pouring him some tea without asking, which Draco found rude…. But he let it slide.
“Moron, hand me one.”
“Ginny I..”
Harry nodded. He understood and took a place at the cherry oak dining table.
Hermoine laughed as she took her shot. Harry flopped down next to Malfoy. “Don’t worry Malfoy, you look stunning. Truly.” Harry grinned, clearly full of himself.
“Draco.. I thought you got kidnapped.. you were so close all of a sudden.” Harry said, he looked like he was feeling a lot better too.
So, the next day, after doing his tasks around the house, he gathered his bag, put on a cloak and apparated to a small alley in Bergen, muttering the old Norse spell to open the gates. You see, where as magic was more based around merlin and is teachings in the UK. Most traditional wizards here believed they had gotten their magic from the great Nordic Gods. They celebrated their feasts differently, they believed in hand labor more than using magic for every task. And believed in living honorably and hopefully one day reaching Valhalla and feasting with the great god Odin himself.
Draco chuckled, ruffling the boys hair. “Good to see you kiddo.. and to meet you Albus. I’ve heard great things about you.” He looked at Albus, nodding friendly.
“No I am quite comfortable sir. Now shut up.”
Malfoy grumbled, pulling the blanket off of him and lifting up his sweater, revealing the bruises on his ribs. “You did this to me. Poor old me. Now hurry up. There’s muffins in the cabinet too.” he shooed him off, quickly covering himself back up.
“Potter?” Draco opened his eyes to find potters face really close to his. He swallowed hard. “Uh.. yeah. I don’t drink often.  I think I lost count at the 8th shot.”
“Potter you were born dull. The people should understand that any snark you toss is the pure stupidity itself speaking.”
“I… I have another. He’s left me alone for weeks on end. We haven’t slept in the same room since I gave birth to Lily.  He hates me and.. I felt alone and defeated. And then Richard came along and he gave me the actual love I needed and…” she choked on her words.
“I see.. well that is settled then. If you do happen to change your minds. Please owl me.” Malfoy said, seemingly relaxing a little more.
“I erm.. I think it might be smart for us to just move in together? Grimmauld is big enough, you could take your own floor. It’s just. We both know we feel better when we sleep closer together. At least until we find out what went wrong with the binding spell.” He could feel the blush spread from his cheeks to his ears. Come on Harry you’re not 16 anymore. Its for the best right.
“I will be, thank you. Please do feel free to come by anytime.”
And never ever. Would he admit that he had liked it. It was weird. Draco Malfoy making him feel at ease.
“I didn’t hate him Ron. I suspected him and found him a stuck up prick. And turns out I was right up until I wasn’t.” Harry sounded amused.
“I am most definitely not.”
“Portable music?”
When the headmistress walked in, silence fell over the room. She didn’t look a day older than.. well since the last time Draco had seen her. And she had looked quite ancient back then. It wasn’t too weird, wizards grew older than humans. She had at least a good 30 years before she would go downhill.  McGonagall gracefully made her way up to the teachers table. Looking over them, a small but stern smile on her face. She cleared her throat. “My dearest ex-students.. I am pleased to see all of you back in such good health. I… welcome you back to Hogwarts, tonight the great hall is yours. Please do keep in mind that the students will return to their dorms around 1am and we’d rather you don’t stroll around the halls after that time. Tomorrow you are free to explore the castle while the students are on a field trip, with the exception of those whose parents are amongst you. Your old teachers will join you in shifts.. now please. Enjoy yourselves.”
“I know Potter. You’re duller than Longbottom. But.. Sincerely. I apologize for how I acted upon my disappointment.”
He ran his fingers through Draco’s soft but thick hair. Smiling to himself. He couldn’t bloody help it.
“Harry. Truth or dare mate.”
Draco sighed audibly. He felt stupid doing this but it had to be done. His bands wouldn’t tighten if he was near Potter. In fact when they hung out they got a little looser. The binding spell was horrible for his mental state, his magic and his overall wellbeing. He was unable to function most of the day. Getting no sleep at night. His magic was trying to reach out to Harry constantly. Making any spell he did weak and unpredictable. Last night he had been unable to even pull up a Lumos to get to the bathroom properly. And that’s where he drew the line. He had to move. Even if it was just temporary.
Not that Harry really minded. He was kind of glad his time seemed to be getting close sooner and sooner. He was very much done with it all. Someone walked in. He snorted. “Whatchu gonna do this time. I told you you’re not going to scare me. Just give up already.” He found taunting them daily was one of the only things he could do really. It gave him great joy up until the moment it didn’t and he’d get punished. “You know it’s weak. Hitting a man while he’s tied up. What kind of power kick does that give you? You haven’t beat me in a proper fight have you no…”.
How long had it been? Why had no one come looking? He lifted his gaze. His eyes by now had gotten used to the blurry dark around him. His captors had taken and crushed his glasses a while ago. Not that Harry really cared. He just wanted to go home. Apologize to Ginny for leaving her like that. to his kids for being a shit, selfish dad… fuck they must be worried right? Or maybe Ginny had told them the truth he had left yet again because something wasn’t the way he planned it to be.
Harry snorted. By now he’d learned Malfoys defensiveness was just the way he liked to talk to Harry, supposedly to keep him humble.
The sound of wings rapidly approaching. Skadi cawing loudly as he held his arm out. The raven landing on it. She was panting, it was clear she’d flown as she could. She had been send with Draco’s latest letter and gifts to Scorpius as they had decided Daisy was maybe a bit too old.. Only a day ago. She must have returned right away.. with an urgent matter.
It had only been a day or two when Harry got a paper dropped onto his desk. Ginny stood behind him, fuming.
“but of course. What did you expect?” Draco chuckled, taking the lead rope that was on Sigyn from Helve.
“I have good faith. Harry.. cares more. Let’s be honest he has been reckless the past few years. You’ve seen the headlines. Crashing cars. Disappearing. And then that hideous savior job of decursing others. Just to get away. Its refreshing to have him back. And if it takes a Malfoy to get him back and to act like the old Harry. I don’t see a problem.”
“Quit it. Don’t stare. They’re gonna notice.” Pansy kicked him under the table.
It stung Harry. It hurt, he cared about Malfoy. He did owe him. He remembered it all. How he had his life threatened because of Harry. How he still got them away from there.
“S’fine. Its harder on the kids. I think we shouldn’t have even married to begin with. She gave me comfort and all. But we were never meant to go this far. I can’t love her.”
“You refused to let me take you to bed last night Draco. You protested and tossed a blanket at me.”
“Good, I’ve already send out the invites.”
By the end of the night they were both quite drunk. Genuinely enjoying one another’s company as they were finding they had more in common than they had thought. Of course avoiding any sensitive topics like the war and a lot of their childhoods. Harry found himself feeling.. more at ease than he had expected. Malfoys refusal to call him anything but potter, his snide remarks and no more respect than he had had in the past was a nice change from most of his friends. Some of whom would treat him like he was broken, others like he was a big giant hero instead of a friend. Malfoy was a nice change of tune most definitely. Not that either was going to admit they had enjoyed it.
He kept his mouth shut. Trying his best to deflect new guy getting into his head. He failed. After about 30 minutes, which felt like hours, New guy stopped. He took a sharp and pained breath. Did Harry succeed? He smirked to himself, the cut on his lip splitting open again before it hit him. It was worse than any curse so far. His insides were on fire. His lungs felt like they were collapsing in on themselves. He tried to grab for his throat but the cuffs he was in wouldn’t allow him, he fell forward, face first and passed out. Only faintly hearing new guy yell about who threw that.
Harry roled his eyes, taking it before moving to stand next to Malfoy, leaning against the wall “They’re so fussy. Did you see Ron looking?  He thinks you’ve got me cursed.”
The Love between them was platonic. They cared deeply for each other and he couldn’t imagine life without her by his side, she was his comfort. Even if she just did it for her son at this point. tonight some of that was changing.. a difficult change but... change nonetheless.
“it er.. it was alright having you. Not as horrific as I expected, but I did in fact expect you to show up ready to curse me into oblivion.” He sounded rather genuine as he slurred his words a little.
Draco was quite surprised when a small witch approached him. “Malfoy? Oh Merlin I barely recognize you.. Look mate I erm… I’m glad you’re here. I just want you to know that me, and the pair of dumbasses over there…” she pointed to a small group, one of whom Draco recognized as an old Hufflepuf. “We forgive you. The war was hard on us all. You did what you had to to survive, like we all did.” She said, looking dead serious.
Kiss the damn chef
By the time he came back home it was 4pm. Was it too late to make his way to Diagon? Probably. But he had just enough material to create a one way portkey to granger’s  since he had no floo. Figuring starting with Potters friends would be best. They were probably looking for him too but he wouldn’t mind waiting for them to get home.
“father would’ve made me betray you. They would’ve forced me into something and made me hurt you. The way it ended… it was the best solution.” Draco sighed deeply. “Don’t make me depressed Potter. Let’s head back before Weasley thinks I’ve taken you hostage.” He grumbled. Walking off.
Once he was done with setting up the altar at a north facing window he set up his other stuff. Before crashing down on the sofa, taking a two hour nap. He only woke up when Daisy was tapping his window. Holding a letter. Scorpius probably. He had told his son about the move.
“Well go on then. What happened, I haven’t got all day to spend sipping tea with you.” He asked, tapping his foot lightly, the place had changed, last time he was here, it had been cold, empty and most of all dark. There was no cute lights, the chandeliers weren’t home to every house spider species in great Britain anymore. It was much cozier with actual furniture. And without the looming presence of the dark lord forcing your mother to show him around the house and show him that the place was actually empty while holding his want to your throat. Leaving a deep cut either way while your father just watched you in disgust.
Draco had long left the wizards district, not that he could quite tell. His mind felt more and more clouded the closer he got. How many trains had he taken? No idea… skadi had hidden herself under his cloak, sitting by his side on his back. He absentmindedly patted her.
Surprisingly, Malfoy answered first. “Pretty good after the Potion you two provided. I feel slightly less of a wreck. Aftertaste was horrible however. Ad some ginger next time… Lovegood. Jam please.” He hummed. Luna passed it to him. Smiling friendly. Harry had been there when even Luna had taken the stance for Malfoy. Claiming he had brought her food and care while she was being held hostage. There wasn’t bad blood between them.
“I told him he’s been a useless father.” She swallowed hard. There was more. She clearly didn’t want to tell him more. He was going to have to push just a little more.
“Seeing you two together like this. Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy. I remember the tirades you used to have about Malfoy being a git Harry.”
Over dinner they had some small talk. Talking about the kids. Harry commenting about how Astoria was missing and Draco admitting she had moved on from him. They were only together for their son. Harry admitting he and Ginny weren’t too close anymore either and hadn’t been for years.
He got onto the horse with ease. Loki was scraping his hooves impatiently as harry got onto the chair, plopping his helmet on and very shakily and carefully got onto the horse.
Draco caught him but fell back in the process. He tried to think of more insults . none came to mind. He just felt emotion overwhelm him.
“I still feel the same. I would have done it even with this consequence. Your friendship is worth it to me.” Draco whispered almost.. the bands loosened up a little when Harry touched him and he could feel his fingers warming up again. It almost stung when he let go.
That.. well that went a lot better than Harry had expected. He’d expected rage and a whole lot more awkwardness. Not a Mellow Draco thanking him for staying with him. He quickly went to get his shower, thanking merlin for there being no one else around them, he wasn’t spotted in the halls.
“I.. we have been looking for him too. Ginny  called a few days back sayin she and Harry got into a fight and left. We thought he was staying with you?” Ron said, mouth full of spaghetti.
No years of muggle therapy could fix what his father had put him though. Draco still tried to blame himself.. but he didn’t have a choice in the matter. It hadn’t been his fault… his father forced him, threatened and manipulated him into doing the most horrible things. He’d been a toy without any identity for his entire childhood. he was only now discovering who he was, his interests and how.. extremely little he and his dad had actually had in common.
“Oh yes. The boys. Look before you go and give me a rant. I’m fine with em being friends. Let them be. they’re not us. Besides after Albus got sorted into Slytherin.. he needs anyone can get.” Harry started. Malfoy seemed a bit taken aback. He.. he hadn’t expected Potter to be willing to let Scorpius be friends with his son. In fact Draco had made a whole list as to why they should be allowed to and to please let his son have that chance.
“It’s really common amongst muggles, wait…” He searched up one of his favorite songs. That’s life by frank Sinatra. Malfoy’s eyes watered up. “That is beautiful..” he muttered under his breath. “So you’re telling me that.. this is a normal thing? You can just bring that with you? There is no spell?”
“Ah me and Seamus usually fly and toss quaffles. We gave up on seekers game a while ago because this man keeps losing the snitch.” Dean grinned.
By the time he woke up he wasn’t in the field anymore, instead he was in a soft bed, covered in layers of blankets. He opened his eyes, blinking against the light. Once his eyes had adjusted he realized he was at saint mungo’s, the healers center. And no one other than Granger and Pansy were sat at his bed. He sat up. Groaning softly. By the gods was he sore. He rubbed his arms. The silver bands hadn’t tightened but they weren’t ready to come off either. Not that he really cared right now.
He also wouldn’t tell Draco, nor anyone else present at the party, that he looked very peaceful when he slept. Soft and serene. Free of the hash, guarded expression he normally had. How soft he became when he was a sleepy drunk and how he had, without a warning, nestled himself against Harry last night.
Harry would. Of course, never admit he nearly cried after reading the letter. He hated himself for messing up with Draco. He looked forward to getting to know him better. Talk more. And he wasted it all. Like a moron.
“They are just dirty. That is all.”
“Certain, take care yeah? Don’t get hurt.” Ginny called back. The girls yelled their goodbyes and as Harry yelled his back. Grabbing his wand and the port key.
They laughed again. Draco tilted his head back, blowing little circles of smoke up in the air.
Thankfully It only took Scorpius three days to get a letter to his father, Draco had been out fishing out at the river near the Cabin. Stocking up before fall and winter because fish would run low quickly. Even if it was just him eating it. He had learned how to sustain himself for the most part. Without magic, growing his own veggies. Hell, he even had a coop full of chatty chickens he took better care off than off himself.
“Sounds good Finnigan. Harry here could use some humbling.”
“Not true.”
He smiled softy, patting her. “But it’ll be worth it in the end. I hope. I have to find him for Scorpius. And for his family. Perhaps a little bit for myself because I won’t lie. I miss the moron.” He sighed, running his hands through his hair.
Draco looked at him, seemingly thinking.  “I… you know what.. Sure.” He brought out. “It’s nearing Christmas anyway, the boys wouldn’t mind spending that together I think.” He sounded rather relieved. What had he been expecting to hear?
“Understood, I’ll be on my best behavior for the small Malfoy.” He hummed, getting up and out to leave to his own room. “Oh and Harry.. Thank you..” Malfoy gave him a soft smile before spelling the door close behind Harry.
“Lovely.” Draco took his shot.
The small blonde witch that had been taking the points was eerily silent as she rushed up to them. the other players landing. Yelling of they were ok.
“I am sorry to tell you this. But…”
“I don’t know what that is Potter.”
“It’s on then, let’s play after dinner. There’s a pretty good spelled field up in the woods. Some of the local wizards play there with us sometimes.  It’s not big but, it should be fun.” Seamus beamed.
“that’s it yeah, I should probably head home.” Harry hummed, leaning in the doorway.
“Yeah because I would definitely be able to do that. I wouldn’t feel like an asshole at all. Give me that.” Harry stole his drink. Tossing it back.
Draco wasn’t exactly planning on going tonight. He most definitely was not. At least he hadn’t been until Blaise, Pansy and their dates for the night had shown up this morning early with a suit and stern looks. They took his wand and shoved him into the shower to get ready. He had reluctantly drank a calming potion and done as told without to much protest after setting everyone up with drinks.
“I don’t..”
“Work? Oh yea. Work has been good. I’m off to Romania in about two weeks. apparently they’ve been dealing with a nasty well spirit in some small town. They think someone tossed a cursed item down and it’s been causing a bunch of failed harvests. I’m going to see what I can do about it.” Harry said, sighing softly.
“Fair enough, the Blacks house was part of my heritage at some point. They must’ve put something in that whiskey, I haven’t been this drunk since Hogwarts whiskey night in the dungeons.” He grumbled, letting the potion do its work. Wondering if it was even worth it with that after taste.
I do not remember ever thanking you nor apologizing for the past. Perhaps its time to do so.
The old lady shook her head, but she gave Harry, who had a lot harder of a time hiding his emotions and was looking a bit upset, a smile. She most definitely knew.
Without really thinking much more of it. He portkeyed to Grangers, knocking on the door. “Granger, Weasley.” He nodded as he walked in. “Is Potter here? I got a worried letter from my son wondering where the hell his best friends dad went.” He said, plopping down his bag. Hermoine and Ron both looking  quite shocked, making Malfoy roll his eyes.
“Well behaved. That’s a nice change from you Potter.” Draco smirked. Earning a chuckle from Albus. “Trust me, you should’ve seen your dad at school. A mess truly. Everyone likes to write about him as sophisticated and well behaved. I beg to differ. He looked a mess and the only reason he was ever in time is because grang… your auntie Hermoine kept him in check.”
Hermione’s face grows warm, and she’s not altogether sure it’s because of the summer heat. “That’s irrelevant to the case, Ginny.” (Vincent looks at Luna again, who explains that ‘irrelevant’ is a word meaning levitation. That Ginny was trying to levitate the point of the case away.) “I would not have been put on the case if I didn’t have the experience.”
He always has a camera. They all know this. “I was taking pictures earlier out the window of Nan’s car as we drove to the dentist. I got some great shots of the ice cream truck, and of you too, Draco!” He points to Draco. “You were eating some ice cream, and it looked so good! What flavour was it? Chocolate?”
” the bespectacled boy says, giving him a look, “that doesn’t mean he did
“Yes, he has!” Ron says, aghast.
“Cedric?” Harry scratches his chin, “I dunno…”
And for whatever reason, Draco believes him.
Harry is putting his neck out for him like this. It makes him scared that maybe he’ll have to end up paying him like the lawyers his father works with. Oh sure, he has a handy-dandy trust fund waiting for him when he turns twenty-five, but he doesn’t want to be in debt that long! His mother talks about the
this is a very important trial of law and order.”
“You can’t be a prat
team.”
Harry raises his little hand, gathering the court’s attention. “Draco and I have no issue with this.” He nods at Neville, “Neville deserves someone in his corner too… And I know ‘Mione can be in-par-shul.”
“I do not!” It’s worth noting that Draco does not deny being mean. He knows where his weaknesses lie. For what it’s worth.
While she then explains what impartial means (‘when your grandma loves you and your siblings equally’) and while Padma corrects her explanation, Harry ponders over the question. Neville doesn’t have representation like him… If the situation were different, Harry would be more than happy to prosecute on his friend’s behalf, but he just
“How about Ced?” Luna suggests, humming. “He lives just down the road. He’s a good boy.”
“You weren’t placed on the case,” Padma quips, distracted from Luna’s incorrect explanations. “You volunteered.”
“Harry’s your boyfriend?” Ginny inquires. “I knew it.”
“Mum!” Draco, the most proper little mummy’s boy this side of the channel, has never once heard his mother speak like that.
“Justice!” Harry pumps his tiny fist in the air the way he’s seen the
While Ron’s self-esteem is especially upsetting for a six-year-old child, his sense of ‘will this make my mum angry’ is much stronger than his need to prove to others that he’s Harry’s ultimate best friend forever, no take-backsies. He sticks his tongue out instead.
Hermione blinks, “Pardon?”
The court collectively gasps. Except the few who already knew, anyways. It makes Draco flinch, because he knows the circumstances surrounding his cousin Tonk’s birth are prime gossip subjects, at least within the blue blood circles that his parents are familiar with. He hopes he hasn’t just gotten himself in trouble.
Harry rubs his temples. Draco makes it so hard to defend him sometimes.
Harry knows he’s right. He nods his agreement. “Kay.” A smile, “And you don’t smell like hotdog water. Or look like you do.”
“Yes,” Hermione confirms. “But there are no cameras.”
“I say we get a big kid to settle this.” Padma rubs her eyelids with her thumb and index finger. “This is ridiculous.”
The specification does not help much.
Something in Harry’s chest sinks. “You do?”
“They’re playing Law and Order.” Lily supplies, sipping her lemonade (“It’s American!”) and bouncing a happy baby girl in her lap. “It’s getting rather intense.”
” Harry corrects.
“Sorry your father couldn’t join us, love.” Narcissa holds Draco’s hand with her gloved one. “You know how he gets when
“Thanks, Harry,” Draco says, sarcasm dripping off of him (much like that chocolate ice cream he supposedly ate).
Draco’s best friend is probably Pansy. Though he gets along well with her (they’re both a little mean sometimes), he wonders if now they’re only friends by default because their dads know each other. Is that still real friendship? He’d like to think so.
“Eating Neville Longbottom’s chocolate ice cream!” Lily says, triumphant.
you?”
“Well,” Harry starts, looking up and trying to come up with a solid comparison, “before today, I’ve never heard of a
Harry sits next to Draco, warming up his bubble bottle and mulling over his defence when the latter speaks up.
“Yuh-huh! How come me and ‘Mione are
“This is dumb.” Ron sticks his tongue out, blowing a raspberry. “Are we gonna vote or something?” He wants to be home and drinking some juice by now. Oh, and watching the telly. “I vote Draco guilty.” Draco was mean to him once a few years ago, and he still feels very petty about it even if he can’t quite remember just what was said or done.
Draco, who still lowkey thinks he’s going to be hanged at the end of this, shrugs his shoulders, mumbling quietly, “Uh drust ewe.”
because it was unfair to stay-at-home dads and working mums (most of her rant was copied word for word by her mother, not that it mattered because Ron had forgotten most of it the minute it came into his mind.)
“I have it written down somewhere, in my journals from that time.” Lily drums her nails on the table, “I’ll have to do some digging but it’s all coming back to me now!” She claps her hands. “It was the beginning of your play dates, you two!” Her hands are held to her cheek. “Before you were little love birds.”
The revelation causes some gasps from the children. Mainly because the majority of them have no idea what that is.
“Am I really your…your best friend?”
“What’s innuh-sent?” Vincent asks Luna, whose name he thinks is Lucy.
best friends, then?”
Maybe there’s more than one type of best friend. He should ask. Investigate.
I do everything myself if I want it done right?”).
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Draco, defensive and growing crankier by the minute, scowls at her. “I’m cool!”
Draco sniffs, and it takes a lot for her not to take out her handkerchief and dab at his cheek. “For eatin’ Neville’s ice cream.”
His mother was a little easier, requiring only his trademarked woobie eyes and about an hour of
“No one is fighting for Harry’s hand!” Hermione commands, hands akimbo.
“That’s just how men are, luv.” Lily smiles. “Just like how you and Harry are two sides of the same coin.”
Six: Harry throws himself into a passionate speech about not jumping to conclusions and that the law or justice or something important like that is blind and they should not take Colin’s offhand comment so seriously. So to heart. But nobody seems to listen because the sheer drama of it all is much more exciting than the mere concept of Draco possibly being innocent of all crimes.
Even Draco and Vincent are acquainted with him, his father working at the same firm as theirs, though they were never babysat by him. Instead, there were awkward little meetings between them during the grown-up parties thrown by their parents, in which they were forced to socialise and sit at the same table as if they had anything in common. Cedric, to his credit, treated the boys and other children fairly, despite being one of the eldest.
” He points to the empty ice cream wrapper, still dripping with sticky leftover chocolate because none of them wanted to clean it.
For the short time Draco’s known Harry and his friends, they’ve been very different. The main trio is always together, playing, or taking naps next to each other. Leg over stomach, arm over face. No sense of personal space. A single unit. Never asking to share lunches, but rather just reaching over each other’s spaces and taking what they want with little conflict.
“Is that fair?” Luna, who was among Neville’s closer group of friends, asks with a deeply sleepy tone of voice. “Shouldn’t a judge be impartial?”
” He’s referring to the black vintage car which dropped Draco off earlier in the morning (built before the war, though Draco does not know which one). It made a few of the kids stare and ask if he was a secret member of the royal family. “But I knew when I saw it that it was really cool.” It was hella cool. Harry thought it would be the perfect car to do secret agent missions in.
“Go home, Colin!” Ginny sticks out her tongue. “This is important grown-up business!”
“Nuh-uh!” Ginny protests, “Tonks likes
. You said, ‘in my professional...sperience.”
“Well, no matter.” She claps her hands, gaining the attention of the rowdy group of children. “I’ll buy ice cream for the lot.”
deserve a delicious snack, but that’s besides the point). He had thought at the beginning of this that it was some sort of odd game Harry was setting up, but now he’s starting to think that he really means it. Like the time Hermione proposed a sit-in during the Library’s showing of
In full honestly, Hermione’s only past cases were that which she held at home (in which she always upheld the very most highest standard of the law), the ones including her plush and doll collection, and occasionally her parents whom served as either jury members or witnesses to the little cases she’s put on.
Neville, who spends most of his time hiding behind Hermione or his mother, is already looking like he wants to run away. “I left it on the table.” He points behind him, at the little kids’ table Harry’s mum got him for his summer playdates; the one with the colourful cartoons printed on the surface (which he picked out himself). “It was chocolate flavoured.”
Four: Hermione sentences Draco to the electric chair, despite the fact that Britain has no death penalties (it’s something she saw on the telly while her dad was asleep in the living room, don't tell her mum), thus leading to Padma lecturing her on said fact.
“Oh my.” Narcissa blinks at the strange congregation of children out on Lily Potter’s front lawn, her driving gloves still in the process of being removed. “Good heavens, what’s this?”
“Let’s get back to the question at…at arm,” says Hermione, hoping she got the phrasing right. “Was Draco near your ice cream?”
rather terrible.
Neville had not actually seen Draco eat his ice cream, because he had been distracted by Ginny snapping at Padma to stop correcting Luna’s statements. The sudden screeching startled him enough to focus on the source of aggression (which only got worse by how fiercely Parvati egged on the confrontation, and how little control Ron had over his little sister).
“Question for ‘Mione,” she points to her. “You’re a professional?”
Three: At the sight of the very big six-year-old coming towards him, Colin screams and hides behind Neville who does not do much to help the situation: instead of finding his courage and standing up to Vincent, he merely sits looking pathetically towards the distant road whereupon his Nan drove off after dropping him off.
Draco pouts as Harry covers his hand with his. “I feel like my innocence is shattered.”
Oh geez, just watching him makes Draco feel terribly bad. Even if he insists that he didn’t do anything to anyone.
“Why would Draco steal plain chocolate when he likes fancy ice cream?”
Against some of their toughest classmates!
(“Wot’s save-or-ee?” “Another word for charity.” “
“Hm.” Narcissa presses her lips together, wondering about the merits of simply carting her son away for the afternoon and hoping that everyone would forget all about it tomorrow when he came back around to play. Children’s memories
“Be nice,” Hermione warns the both of them, though nodding her approval in Ron’s direction because she still secretly believes in Draco’s guilt (it took
Some nods, confident and quiet. “He’s smart. Like you.” Though Draco prefers Harry. “I think… I think he’ll listen to your case.”
“Why are we here, ‘arry?” Ron groans, throwing his little head back and sighing, sweat formed on his brow.
Draco twiddles his thumbs, finding comfort in Harry’s reassurance. “She’s my cousin.”
is in town.” She rolls her eyes, sighing into her cup of tea, looking spectacularly like a member of the royal family with her cream-coloured pinafore dress. “Sometimes I think he should have married him instead.”
Hermione, who was not at all being impartial, fiddles with her fingers and remembers her mother’s strict teachings on being true to one’s self and being honest.
“But Draco is Harry’s best boy-friend now too,” Luna points out.
smart enough to be impartial, he probably has homework or something equally awful to do. None of the other kids have older siblings (
Luna tries to argue that she saw a rather large bird swoop down and scoop up Neville’s ice cream, but when she’s given the floor, she begins to delve off and say that
“All this is true.” Harry scratches his chin. “And more.”
Harry blinks. “What?”
While it would be great and cruel fun to accuse Neville of having a crush on Hermione (something which a good portion of the children believe anyways), it is silently agreed among the masses that the poor boy has gone through enough trauma for the day. Maybe tomorrow.
“I’m going to the electric chair, Mum,” Draco states solemnly, as Harry resolves to fisticuffs with one of the Weasley boys (Narcissa doesn’t know which one), and the rest either try to separate them or edge them on.
to get that gum out of her hair). “We’re in court.”
“Long lost brother and sister,” Parvati concludes with such finality, that it is hard for Ron to deny it. “Out of wedlock. Probably from his father’s side.”
“My father will hear about this,” Draco mumbles.
), and they don’t want to just ask an adult...
“Oh quiet.” Narcissa half-heartedly smacks her son’s arm as the other two at the table laugh. “You’re old enough to know how your mother talks among friends.”
to do to people. “He’s a prat!”
It’s on the hottest day of the summer yet (tomorrow will prove to be worse) that Draco finds himself accused of the most heinous of crimes.
“Tonks?” Ginny narrows her eyes. “How do
“Hey!” Draco sneers, ready to throw back another insult.
“That’s true.” Parvati agrees. “And he was a prat when he insulted my new dress.” It had been specially tailored for her by her mother, and when she heard that Draco said something mean about it, she was particularly miffed. “And when he called my sister a swot!”
Everything was going so well. Except when it wasn’t.
Before Harry can reassure him that, again, he can have more than one best friend, a little voice interrupts them all.
evolved into a paranoia fest of what would happen if the children’s mums caught them looking so sticky for no good reason), the court sits down, deciding to stay sticky.
All this is very in line with how Hermione is. The rest of the children nod along.
Then again, she could just throw money at the problem. That always worked for her family.
The sun has gotten to a point where it was no longer fun to be under. The shade of the trees can only do so much, and the children lean into every breeze that comes their way, looking like cattails bobbing in the wind.
A few of them deem this fair enough grounds for accusation given the well-known notorious past of Draco in daycare, but this doesn’t seem to convince Harry who, with every suspicion, only pushes back harder on the idea of giving Draco the benefit of the doubt (though, in this case, he does not know the actual phrase and refers to it as ‘giving Draco the hen of the doubt’, which causes some confusion among the kids: mainly that Draco is owed a hen if he’s proven innocent.)
Several things happen at once.
Harry pushes up his little glasses, “Not for Draco.” He knows him well. He sits next to him in school and he pays attention. “He likes…
“Yes, you can bring it with you.”
And so he did. Switching his coffee for a glass of a liquor the local old lady that acted as everyone’s grandma had made and gifted him for bringing her fresh eggs each week.
Harrys POV
“Same here. My fan club is absolutely draining me.” Draco said dramatically, putting a hand to his forehead and pretending to faint a little.
“I’ll have you know I am very gentle.”
He felt significantly better after eating some toast and drinking a tone of water. Skadi sat by his side concerned. Watching him closely. “That’s just the start of it love, soon these will start tightening and may the gods know what will happen when I do find him.”
Draco shook his head. Medication made his mind wander too much. He smiled at Scorpius. “Now son… I don’t care what house you end up in. As long as you’re proud. You’re a Malfoy. Write me when you can and don’t let anyone tell you, you don’t belong.” He said, hugging the boy tightly. he inhaled deeply… after today Astoria would move out, with her boyfriend on trail. He’d be all alone up in the mountains and… “Ill miss you daddy… Ill write you as often as Daisy allows me.” Scorpius smiled. Looking at his owl. “Ill miss you too Scorp.” Draco let him go. Ruffling his hair one last time. “Stay safe my little buddy.” He called after him. The boy rolled his eyes as he got into the train.
“Dad,
Hogwarts looked different. It had repaired itself after the war. There were new stone guards. More of them. the bridge had been rebuild and looked far sturdier than its wooden ancestor. There seemed to be more towers. And overall.. the building looked far more welcoming, though Draco would be the last to admit that part. The friendly warm light from inside, the somewhat spooky decorations.. it somehow.. did feel nice to be back here.
Due to what has happened, I think it is for the best I go back to isolation. Do not contact me. It is ok. Take care of your family.
“so Harry how has work been?” hemione asked, smiling sweetly as she tilted her head, trying to encourage him to participate more.
What was that supposed to mean?
“Nothing” Blaise muttered. He’d been shut up thankfully.
Harry’s POV
Malfoy turned around, jumping slightly. “P-Potter.” He muttered. “I.. I don’t have more with me. Zabini took em.” He almost whispered looking down at his half smoked bud. “Just take this, I’m done anyway.” He held it out, ready to walk off.
Harry scoffed playfully, hitting Draco on the shoulder.
“Don’t be a prude.” Harry snorted, getting up to stand behind him, ruffling Draco’s hair up big time. Managing to make his semi long hair look an absolute mess. Earning a grumble and an elbow to the leg.
“It’s fine, sit down Draco, I know you’re going to try and avoid me all night. Let me talk now and you won’t have to interact with me for the rest of the Reunion. Promise.” Harry said, sitting down himself, whispering “Accio Malboro” under his breath and a pack came flying his way.
“Tell my Son that. When Scorpius sends me an unformal letter AND makes Skadi fly right back. There is something wrong. He is upset and I cannot stand for Potter making my son upset.”
Draco could almost hear his sons chuckle. See his cheeky little grin, knowing full well he’d broken a rule and here was nothing his parents could do. He smiled and sighed in relief… his son seemed happy. Safe.
Malfoy wasn’t sure what to believe really. Greg had been quite dull, he must be getting influenced by someone. Or it straight up not true. He didn’t care to find out for himself. he and pansy did have a falling out a long time ago… he should try to make up for that probably.
Harry snorted in response. “Chin up Potter. Its only one night. Tomorrow you get to see your kids and after that you’ll be on your merry way home.”
“It’s none of your business Malfoy. You got what you wanted, now leave.”
“Right. I’m.. I’ll…  I’ll grab the salmon before it burns, please do take place at the table” Draco seemed a bit taken aback. He wasn’t ready to talk about the war. Especially not to Harry fucking Potter.
“I mean it was to be expected. Living in England was hell just after the war and you took quite the hit despite Po…. Is that Potter and his gang?” Pansy leaned back to look over Blaise’s shoulder. “Oh my it is. Don’t look.”
They talked for a while once things were a bit more settled. Eventually Ron came in to take his statement on the events. Draco had some food and another nap and had himself discharged right after. Not like they really wanted to keep him.
“Don’t worry about it. I am a clingy drunk.” Draco muttered. “I’m sorry for you know.. probably making you stay. You don’t have to.”
“You have different animals?! Oh Pansy I am so glad to have you in my life.” Jackson smiled, squeezing her closer.
“You look like you want to die Potter. Are you able to handle it?” Draco asked softly. Lighting up a smoke for the both of them.
He took a walk around. spotting Hagrids old hut out in the fields. His memories of being attacked by anything that man raised flashing back. Thinking back on it he probably deserved that. he had been bit of a prick to the creatures.  He had Harry had talked about it when he got attacked by buckbeak. How Granger and Harry had saved the hippogriff and Black by using the time turner.
The first few days were hard. Malfoy felt himself lost after doing daily chores. He didn’t need it but at this point he was thinking about going back to working on the fishing boat and be so busy he wouldn’t have time to focus on the loneliness. But.. he decided against it. He had his son to look out for and send letters. Besides who’d care for the cabin. Who’d look after his chickens? Astoria? She hated them. She had a better life now.
He saw him tense up slightly. “She has a good idea on what is going on. But if she is right you will never forgive me.” Draco answered slowly, thinking every word through very well. “I know you would probably like to know more but.. I don’t have the words to explain it to you. So topic change potter.” He said it so coldly. It sliced through Harry. Nope not bringing that up again.
“Or she isn’t. If it could end the violence against anyone that’s ever been in Slytherin… Ill talk to him about it but it might take some convincing. He’s still Malfoy after all.” Harry hummed.
When they returned after a small tour they were greeted by the Weasley’s and their kid. As well as Teddy, James and Albus. The kids seemed to get along quite well. Albus and James seemed to be a bit upset with the news their father was divorcing but they understood. Apparently they were willing to give their dad another chance because they stood close to the man. Hugging him goodbye when it was time to leave.
And with that, he picked up his bag again and apperated to the wizards inn. Getting himself a room, where he got his first look in the mirror. He had horrible helmet hair, wild and all over the place. Sighing he attempted to fix it. A quick spell to clean himself up a little. He put the bird up on a perch. Watching food appear for her. “Rest up my darling. Ill go find Potter and his disappearing twat ass.” He kissed her little head to which she wagged her tail feathers softly before she turned to the food.
“You’re nuts.”
Harry took his sweet time to start talking. Mostly waiting till Draco relaxed slightly next to him, he swung his leg over the bench, watching him. God he had lost weight again, he looked like a living corpse with those dark circles around his eyes. “So.. I.. I’m sorry for what I put you through.” He said, you know. His plan had worked further than he had though it ever would. He had expected to approach Draco about a thousand times without result. He never actually thought of what he would say. Sober too damn it.
“you’re a dork love. My dork. You two should come over for dinner some time. Catch up.” Dean smiled.
Harry knew, he bloody well knew he was gay and in love with none other than the drunk guy curling against him this very moment. He couldn’t place it. What about Draco was charming him. He wasn’t bad looking of course. He was bit of a.. a lot of a prick. He treated Harry like he always had. But always made up for it in his own ways. It was refreshing, to not be treated like either a savior or a broken man that couldn’t fend for himself and was incapable of anything. Draco was just an asshole to him. Despite everything.
“I agree. Now off you go before I change my mind on letting you come back here again.” Malfoy smiled. A genuine soft smile.
And so, after dinner, they called up Seamus and Deans friends. Gathering at the field. They had just enough players for a full team. Harry joined Seamus, Draco joined Dean. A few makeshift goals appearing.
“Malfoy it pains me to say this. But you’re gonna have to be there mate. Your friendship with Harry could mean a big difference.” Ron said.
“Sure Malfoy.” Harry snorted, it was just getting amusing at this point. Why did this aggravate him so much back then? Who knows.
“I’m glad to have missed it.”
“You so were, you tensed up like a little baby. I could feel your fear.”
“Oh most definitely. Hermoine literally packs his lunch and makes him breakfast.” They laughed loudly.
When preparing to leave he grabbed Skadi. Daisy was on her way to Scorpius with some presents from him and Astoria and he figured he might want to send his mother a letter too. Once he figured out what to write to her. How to apologize for the lost years.
He took his time getting ready. But they didn’t leave without him. Pansy made it a point to “Fancy up his hair the way he used to have it.” While her boyfriend just seemed in awe with it all. He was incredibly interested in the solar globe. Which had the entire solar system floating around it.
“She says she is close. But she thinks its for the best if you figure out on your own.”
“Draco I swear to god if you do not let go of that fucking snitch your ass is grass and I’m gonna mow it. You made us crash.”
As per deal, Malfoy got his first smoking break. They had set a limit for today when they found him packing three packs for one night. “You can drink till you drop… or till I think you’ve had enough but I’m not letting you destroy your lungs over this. Now on with it” Zabini’s exact words.
They said a hasty goodbyes. Obtaining their significant others.
They noticed the others staring in awe. Draco groaned lightly, pushing Harry off of him. “You’re Crushing me.” He huffed, hand on his painful ribs. Nothing he wouldn’t be able to heal himself.
“Fuck off Potter. Taste it. Pray I didn’t poison you.” Draco smirked. There was no snide behind his comment.
“oh we should try that Draco. I used to play with Ron before he became a hardworking man.”
Greetings Malfoy.”
“sounds good Draco.”
New guy had shown up two days ago. He didn’t like talking. What he did like was Making Harry feel small. Harry had never learned occlumensy properly. New guy got into his head. Found his deepest secrets, his most painful memories. Made him relive them. then, when he felt broken and defeated. He showed him something bright, his children, Ron and Hermione at dinner with him, Draco asleep, Ginny in her wedding dress… To which he was Violently beaten by new guys minions. Stinging curses, forbidden curses, cutting curses. One sectumtemptra, but that one had been cut off before it had been thrown properly. He was dreadful of new guy. New guy had been the only one able to make Harry feel like the 11 year old boy being thrown into the broom closet under the staircase.
“Don’t tell me.. have you ever seen a movie?”
Harry’s first attempt was most definitely a fail, he flopped around but managed to stay on. Making some comments on how Weasley’s bucking brooms were better than this.
Harry laughed. “Can you please leave potter with me for a bit. I’d like to have a word.” Draco hummed, some guy opened his mouth but Potter Quickly shot him a “But of course, we do have all evening to catch up with everyone else.” He looked quite ashamed to even ask it from the others. But they seemed to take it.
“That’s me sir, Scorpius Malfoy!” he even sounded happy. Was this really Draco’s kid? I mean it was undeniable, but my my. Big difference. Malfoy must’ve done something really well and different from his own upbringing.
“I..” he rubbed his arms a little. “its not safe Harry. You heard them. They wanted me in.. Or dead. Us hanging out could mean horrible things. Its.. Its better for everyone if we just stop contacting each other so we’re no longer associated. It’s also no good for your reputation to hang out with me. Trust me… the binding spell will lift with time. And..”
“So Pansy… I heard you were working in Egypt on muggle artifacts? What’s that like?” Neville asked. And before Harry knew it everyone was chattering about work. That was until Hermoine stood up, smiling with her business smile.
Of course he knew Draco wouldn’t feel the same. He didn’t even know if he was gay. He just needed someone to be there for him. To accept him and care. Harry would enjoy and provide for that job until it ended. He would dread the day it would end and hoped that day wouldn’t come soon.
The moment it entered the building he inhaled sharply. he felt like he could explode. His whole body tensed, he opened his eyes wide, as far as he could with two bruised eyes. Ready for it to burst through the door.. to meet whoever it was trying to save him.
Malfoy raised a brow. Potter missing? Why? Well it was concerning his son. And he would do anything to cheer Scorpius up. And potter missing wasn’t to great either. He sighed. “Lets go back Loki buddy, we’ll have to continue some other time.”
“Have you figured something out Mormor?” Draco asked, he tried not to sound desperate but Harry felt he was. Did he really want to rid of him that bad?
Harry stared, he couldn’t help but notice the pale white scars running over his stomach and ribs as far as he could see them. He held back on commenting on it. “Fine. Only once. And I am stealing a muffin for myself. “
“Tell me Dra… Malfoy. It’s incredibly frustrating not to know. I don’t know if you’ve noticed but your lovely little binding spell hasn’t been lifted. Not just that. We’re friends. I miss hanging out with you.”
They played a few more rounds. Ron’s dares were the meanest out of all of them, though
Draco opened his eyes. Looking up at him, “Goodnight Harry..” he uttered, giving him a goofy little smile.
“Anywhere he could’ve gone too or are the both of you, even you Granger utterly useless at finding your supposed best friend?”
“You’ll be fine you can trust me”
“You wanna head back? I’ve got some ahem, homemade liquor in my bag and I honestly can’t be arsed to stay all night.” Malfoy sighed after socializing for a bit more.
For Scorpius however he’d done his best. He’d done everything he could to give the kid a worry free childhood. He wasn’t spoiled. But he had no shortages either. he was loved, he was happy, he had no worries. Astoria had been great with him.. with both of them really. She helped Draco recover, kept him from substance abuse most of the time. Supported him getting a normal people job and let him raise Scorpius on his own terms… she just… she was a woman. See as Draco had discovered more about himself as a human being, a living person with his own preferences. He’d realized there was very little about the female physique that he found attractive. They had come to terms with it. Astoria had her lovers and Draco had.. well he wast trying to come to terms with himself.
“Goodnight Draco.” Harry whispered back, squeezing him a little closer which was met with Draco relaxing and officially passing out. Not much later, Harry followed.
Anyway. Enjoy <3
Everything was different here. Some used magic without a wand. Despite using it sparingly they were so powerful and controlled. Draco by now had notes upon notes about the community, their magic and ways of life. It was one of the reasons he stayed where he was located now.
He halted Loki, thanking merlin he had practiced actually standing still when being halted with the horse. Freeing Skadi from her letter after holding her close to his chest for a moment. “Good Girl.. you did well..” He muttered, putting her on his shoulder where she immediately nestled against him.
“Are you.. did you mean it Potter? Are we.. friends?” he felt like an idiot for asking. Here he was a 35 year old asking a 36 year old if they really were friends now.
He opened the door to Harry’s room. He hadn’t woken up yet. Which was fair enough seeing as he apparently had been awake three days straight unknowingly.
“They did? I don’t even remember speaking to them.”
“I.. am not allowed or in an exact place to tell you this Draco. But.. she suspects either you or the other guy cared a little more than.. you know.. average friends do…” he started. Seemingly thinking how to correctly word the next part. Malfoy listened intently. “The spell you used has some.. other imple… uses? It is no longer used because of that. It is possible you are.. kind of like. You could have become more than friends, because either of you was wanting that.” Helve said, watching him closely. “But she is not very certain about it. And she is looking for a way to resolve this thing so you know.. you won’t lose your arms. And Draco. I want to say. If you do care about him more. That is ok with me and Momo. We just want you to be happy.” He gave him a gentle hit on the back. Draco just nodded, a bit stunned.
“We know Malfoy.. we tried to trace them back but they left the hideout already.. and Hogwarts has tripled its spells. Your boy is safe.” Hermione said, squeezing his hand. “you’re safe here. Nothing will happen.”
“Life isn’t always fair, but I’m doing alright. I’ve got my life together.” Draco smiled at him.
By the time they got back to London it was quite late. Too late for Draco to go and cook them the meal he promised. “So how about we go for dinner. Diagon Ally has quite the assortment of good restaurants.” Harry opted.
“Too late Malfoy.” Smirked, pouring himself of what Helve called a sweet berry liquor, which was basically berries from his yard, a red fruity liquor and a fuck tone of vodka. It was strong, sweet and a little sour. Honestly Draco’s favorite after Gin tonic.
It was only when the witch silenced them they heard they laughter coming from the two idiots who were apparently having a little brawl over the snitch on the floor. “I most definitely broke some ribs Potter. Its mine. Give it.”
“Sod off Potter. Can you grab me some tea. One scoop of…. Open fire, 500 ml of water. Boiling hot. And fast thank you.” He hummed, snuggling up under the blanket.
Much, very much cozier than that.
“Fuck off Draco you’re drunk.” Harry chuckled.
“Sure, so whenever you see the right foot go forward you stand in the stirrup, work from your knees, not your ankles, keep those still, when you’re ready, give her a bit of pressure with your heels.”
“At least get in the bed Draco.”
Draco Malfoy”
A weekly night trip to the flying fields to get some exercise and let out some energy as well as some planned visits with Helve and Mormor.
“Sure.”
“that’s it for now. I’ll owl you my concerns when I get back.”
Today, he dared carefully running a hand through the others hair, pushing it back to see his face. Tracing down his jaw before… pulling back to shake him lightly. “Wake up Draco, Breakfast time.” To which he earned a loud grumble. “Morning Potter.” He muttered, taking the cup of coffee “with too much milk” Harry held out to him. Taking a sip.
For a friendly game. Things got quite intense. Seamus and Dean were just as fierce as Draco and Harry seemed to be.  Determined to win. No insults were thrown but a few nasty bludgers were hit towards the other team. Resulting in at least one fractured bone, quickly healed by Malfoy, as they played.
“Well ofourse.” Draco could almost feel Harry’s brows raise. He most definitely didn’t get what was being hinted at and.. let’s be honest. Draco wouldn’t be the one to break that news to him.
Hermione smiled softly, taking his hand. “He’s fine, they’re healing him, he went through a lot. How are you feeling?” she asked, looking over at pansy whom was still asleep. “Skadi got us, we found you in the field yesterday. Harry managed to tell us what happened before he went out again. I don’t know how you did it but you got him out of there.”
“i.. thank you?” Draco was a bit stunned for a moment, before he remembered he had snitched on them once and she still had scars on her hands from the lines she’d had to write.
“Whatever Malfoy.”
By the time they returned Harry was battered, looking like he hadn’t slept for weeks on end and worked a long shift. There was dust all over his face and clothes. Draco laughed at him. “Lot more of a workout huh?” he asked, slapping him on the shoulder.
“We should play together more often. You two have got a pretty good team.”
“Are you even listening Potter?!” Draco hissed, getting up in his face again.
“What?”
“Excuses much.”
He looked back at the letter. Realizing he should probably read more than just who send it and get distracted by that. “Dinner huh.. fair nuff. I don’t see why we should break the kids up. They’re kids..” he mumbled to the bird, who tilted her head before cawing as if she agreed, making harry let out a soft chuckle. “lemme ask the wife if she’s aight with going so you can get this back ya mean bird.” He said, stumbling to his feed and walking up to Ginny’s bedroom.. They didn’t even sleep together anymore..
Harry’s POV
“Not a compliment Potter. Proving my point here.”
And then it was Malfoy’s turn.
“Whatever Potter.” Malfoy hummed, seemingly content.
“Bugger off yeah.” Draco laughed, finally looking at the other. his eyes widening. Was Potter nake… Oh no he was wearing underwear, thank Merlin. He sighed, stretching his muscles as he got up, thanking god he had had the decency to steal this grubby shirt from wherever he’d gotten it. He had… scars he didn’t feel the need to share about with potter. “Shower?” he asked, lazily looking back.
He sighed, putting off the blue sweater he had been wearing over the short sleeve white button up, revealing his bruising and hurt arms. Anything tight around them hurt too bad.
He took a deep breath. “You know Potter. I meant it. Back then. In the Robe store.” He whispered.
“it is ok to be nervous Harry. She knows and she is trained and bred to help you with that. She is a wizards horse. Has Draco not explained?” Helve asked him.
“You could’ve joined us.”
Malfoy laughed. “They have. Granger has, she’s kicking her husband under the table. Look away.” He hummed, taking another sip unbothered.
“We seem to get around fine now don’t we. I think it’s about time we try and break the stereotype. I’m with you Hermoine.” Harry stated.
“Thanks.”
He was trotting along nicely on the path. It was a cold day, just warm enough to not have to wear a coat. But most definitely sweater weather. Everything was going great. Draco had even gotten the horse, named Loki for his antics, to walk with a nice curled, but relaxed neck. He pat is neck, letting the reigns go a little and going back to a walk, closing his eyes and taking in the sounds of the woods, the smell of autumn filling his lungs. Letting his mind wander, letting the horse take control of where to go.
“We’ll figure it out Draco. Trust me.” Helve spoke with a thick accent. His voice was quite deep and harsh compared to his looks. He was no older that 25, quite short and scrawny despite his hard working at the farm he owned. His brown hair was thin and all over the place. He always wore a friendly expression but he didn’t like just anyone. He was a good friend to those he did like. And Malfoy was incredibly thankful to him.
Harry sighed, putting an arm around him, rubbing his shoulder softly. “Come on bud, lets get you to bed.” Draco opened his eyes slightly.
Draco snorted. A messy letter. But a formal greeting. They reminded him of his own letters to his mother way back.  He made a mental note to write back as soon as daisy was back on her feet. she would have to work her stamina up to be able to deliver faster without risking her health too much.
“That’s not a dare Granger. Dare me.”
He stood next to his wife, Ginny. Another Weasley that most definitely could drink his blood. The one time he did have to go to the healers after the hunters had found him and almost hexed him to death. She had refused to help him. It had taken him yelling at her to just end it then to make her help him. Out of pure spite she had lifted the curses and tended to the worst of the wounds, stitching them without any numbing while hissing about how she would make sure he’d have to live out his miserable life knowing what he did before kicking him back out of the hospital.
Draco’s POV
“You were absolutely horrible Draco. You were friendly with Hermoine. You even.. you dared sitting next to me.” Harry snorted.
It had taken them 2 years of counselling and another baby to fix their marriage somewhat. And now Harry was just simply travelling the world. Usually home for about a week or two weeks to spend with his children and play the good happy dad he knew he wasn’t. At least the traveling he did for work brought him some fulfillment. Seeing every part of the world. Helping people out of their misery  by ridding of deep and dark curses.
“either way, I have to go. Albus has a map that shows all the secret roads the castle has build after the war. Were gonna explore some. I love you and take care.
Malfoy smiled softly.  “In that case, please do feel free to come by when you wish. I do not care if you bring your friends along and use my living room if you do not feel like talking to me. Anything is fine. The closer we are the better.” He said making harry snort.
Harry ran upstairs. Deciding black jeans and a dress shirt would have to do. He didn’t have much fancy stuff, he didn’t value it nor did he care for his looks. The only reason his hair was semi cut. Was because Ginny kept chopping it off and trying to fix his “Hogwarts head he should’ve grown out by now.” After a quick shower and trimming his attempt at a beard he was ready.
The conversation quickly took on. People brainstorming about the party. Should there be a tour of the castle? Should there be a memoire for those they had lost? Should there be a theme? Which band would they have playing?
“You’re perfectly skilled to do so yourse…”
Even is magic was reaching out. It had been years since Harry had used wandless magic. It seemed stronger than ever. He heard the rumbling downstairs. New guy was cursing as he rushed down too, before he could even reach the door the hardwood table flew in his direction, splintering against his back. He dropped to the ground, knocked out. Others threw spells at him, he blocked them, threw them back. He couldn’t see what was happening. He just heard the screams of someone being hit with their own Crucio and someone rushing up the stairs.
“He left over a headline? What an absolute fuckwit. What did it say. Potter takes a walk outside without his wife. Are they divorcing? “ he asked sarcastically, crossing his arms.
“Its still Malfoy for you.” He grumbled, sitting down regardless. He still didn’t have much of a fight in him.
“we did. At the reunion. They’re married now and you commented about how I do not appreciate any kind of cooking.”
“A what now?”
Before he could close his eyes. Luna, Neville and Harry joined him. Making him grumble slightly. No naps for him this train ride.
As soon as his opponents were taken out, Draco rushed upstairs.
After Harry the others tuned in. Agreeing, all of them but Draco who seemed to be lost in thought. “I’m unsure.. I know it has been Years. But there are some pretty bad grudges out there. They would have to double down on security and…” he took a deep breath, shutting his mouth again.
Draco sighed shakily tears rolling down his face as he  pulled him close. He eventually let sleep take him over. He should’ve stayed hidden. He shouldn’t have gotten involved.
He opened. “Potter.” He said.
He was doing quite well. Despite being alone. He had taken it upon himself to do groceries in town more often. Grant himself the luxury of buying some local goods, speak to the townspeople and make some connections. He didn’t have too many friends left. Pansy lived far away and had a busy life after all. A lot of the others were missing, dead or in jail. Sometimes he held a diner with some of the muggles here. They were kind but hardworking people. They didn’t understand why a snob like him had gone to live in such a remote place, not all of them were open to conversation but those who were. Had grown onto him. Maybe he should organize another diner soon. He had the supplies for it and even with the littlest bit of magic he should manage.
“The kids ask for you you know. Why isn’t daddy ever here? Why can’t daddy come to the musical? I have to lie to them every time. They still think of you highly. But not thanks to you Harry. I raised them. I did everything by myself. Do you even love them? I know you don’t love me but at least love them.”
---------------time skip time-----------------------
They counted down and grabbed the key, arriving at the very familiar train they used to take as kids. The train Draco had taken.. maybe once? Twice willingly. The other times he had jobs to do. He froze but got dragged in by the others. It was a 3 hour ride and he already regretted agreeing to go. Sighing he sat down in whatever cabin he came across first, not really being willing to go to the good ole Slytherin cabin he and his friends used to sit in, remembering full well he had kicked Harry’s nose in, hoping to make him return home and not face the horrible things the dark lord wanted him to do that year. It of course hadn’t worked because Potter had , bloodied and all, joined the table either way.
“Of course.” Harry nodded. Somewhere along the lines he had been starting to hope the spell couldn’t be lifted. He had given in. He was bloody gay and he enjoyed it. Every little moment they got to spend together. He hadn’t had a single nightmare recently. He knew he would have to tell Malfoy eventually. But he didn’t feel ready. He wasn’t ready to be pushed away and be distant again. Perhaps when the spell would be lifted one day he could..
And so he did. Listening to Malfoy’s tips as they went into the woods. Listening to him talk about how his family used to breed horses until they got into the higher ranks.
Draco stiffened up, but relaxed soon again.
“Ah I see. He can be a bit mean. But do not worry. He means well. Let Sigyn connect to you. she is especially calming and protecting.” He ran his hands through the short Fjord mane, ruffling it up. Despite all the brushing, there was still dust coming up from her fur.
So about an hour and arguing over the shower later. The used the floo to get to Helve’s barn. Where Draco was met by a big hug from Helve. “I missed you my friend!” the guy whom Harry deemed was Helve said, scrunching up his nose and eyes as he smiled brightly. He was far from ugly and Harry couldn’t help but feel a sharp sting of jealousy. Draco didn’t let most people touch him. They must be close.
“So you’re both little trouble makers, McGonagall must have her hands full keeping you in check.” Draco hummed, Harry nearly jumped out of his skin, the bastard had sneaked up behind him. Scorpius beamed, hugging his dad.
Harry was most definitely here. His magic felt almost intoxicating to Malfoy. He took a sharp breath. Focus Draco. He heard the first set of footsteps approach him. A red bolt approaching him, which he blocked quietly and shot back. A soft groan indicating he had hit his opponent. Skadi flew up, flying over the candles around the room, dimming the lights before landing on the chandelier.
Harry noticed, putting his arm against Malfoy to try and calm him down a little. Dean didn’t seem to notice, or care that much. Seamus had hopped in to greet them really quick. Wearing the ugliest apron earth with the text
The moment scorp was out of sight, Draco leaned in on Astoria. “I cant take it.. I hate seeing him go.. I’m worried. “ he whispered, his expression was calm, he even put up a smile incase his son was looking. “He’ll make it Draco. He’s our son after all. Not a thing in the world can scratch that boy.” Astoria reassured him, squeezing his hand softy. Draco closed his eyes for a moment. Taking a few deep breaths. When he opened them again.. his grey eyes met the green ones of potter.. he was almost on the other side of the station but.. it seemed they were now both aware of each other’s presence. And Potter… my my… potter had the audacity to smile at him.. the vile creature that had bullied him for years. Taken aback Draco managed a half smile before turning his attention to the train that was about to leave the station., finding Scorpius he waved. Seemed his son had found friends already. Chattering about something he only managed to wave for a short second before getting out of sight.
Harry looked at the ground. Barely registering anything Malfoy was yelling at him. He was free. He took a deep breath, inhaling the cold evening air. Much better than the stuffy room he had been in for however long it had been.
“Yes, the Granger girl.” Narcissa nods. “She was very passionate about her role; it’s a wonder she never made it into theatre.”
Harry, missing a tooth, smiles with his hands akimbo, giving a nod of assurance to Draco.
“Well alright, who’s a big kid that’s em-par-shul?” Ron, exasperated, just about wails to the heavens.
Draco, who was previously regretting his decision to come to play today, stares at Harry.
“Nothing
Intense indeed. It looks as if the children are about to sacrifice one of their own for the good of mankind. At least, if Lily Potter’s son’s speech has anything to do with what’s happening. “Draco!” she calls her son. “Darling, what’s happening?”
Well, Ginny wants Ron to start fighting. She, like many of the other kids, has grown antsy. What’s worse than a group of six-year-old children who are impatient and bored? A five-year-old Weasley girl whose mother is Molly Prewett Weasley. “Show him who’s boss, Ronnie!!”
“Well, everyone
“I believe you.” Harry says, his chin out, looking oddly noble, “It sounds good.” It’s not much, but it makes Draco feel better.
Ginny raises her hand like her teacher taught her how to do when she has a question. Before Hermione can correct her and say that that wasn’t done in court, Harry calls on her. “Yes, Gin?”
“It’s a polite way of saying shut up.”
“More like they share a single brain cell,” Narcissa teases, putting on her judging stare. “They just take turns on using it for poppycock or bollocks.”
“But chocolate’s the best flavour!” Ron protests from his spot next to Ginny.
“All this for nothing!!” Ron is losing it. “I could have been home by now, Harry! I could have had my juice! My sandwich!!”
“What were your past cases?”
“If Draco wasn’t even seen eating the ice cream, then why couldn’t it have been someone else near it?” Harry’s little voice is fierce with determination. “Why does it
“Yes, it does,” Ron says, because his idea of logic is still very much black and white, and he just wants to get all of this over with so he can go have some juice.
“I don’t remember that.” Harry squints. “Do you?”
Ten minutes is spent explaining what a wyvern is and why it’s not
The other children gathered on Harry’s lawn look equally interested in why the sienna-skinned boy ordered them all here (promptly following Draco’s arrest). There were the kids originally playing
Five: Parvati starts laughing. So does Ginny. Full on, belly cackling. The kind that hurts so much but despite that, one can’t seem to stop anyways. The Gatorade previously being drunk by Parvati (red flavour, best flavour) shoots out her nose and splatters over Padma and Luna, which just makes Ginny laugh harder: causing her to topple over her chair and push Ron forwards.
Harry’s mum is watching them from the window, preparing dinner.
know Tonks?” Nymphadora is, of course, Charlie’s best friend (and secret girlfriend, if Ginny can convince them to get together because Tonks is
“You said, you said
Everything was going so well. His mum had dropped him off at Harry’s house to play with his friends and the rest of the children in the cul-de-sac,  many of whom went to Hogwarts Prep with him. It was, in fact, the only reason his father allowed it to happen: the school was close to his heart and the history of his family. It helped that the sons of his father’s law partners attended as well, save for Greg, who was home sick with measles (Draco resolved to visit later today with an ice lolly and maybe Vincent if they were allowed).
Hermione, who just that week had decided she wanted to become a judge (last week it was a barrister, next week it’ll be a ballerina), has volunteered without being asked to pass Draco’s judgment. During playtime in daycare, many years ago (two), the boy had stuck gum in her hair, but she is willing to overlook that for the sake of the law. Especially since he’s probably guilty. Neville wouldn’t lie.
surprise for you at home.”
“You don’t say?” Harry snorts, drinking his latte that was more sugar than coffee. “As long as it’s not flammable, I’ve no problem with it.”
that his uncle Edward (whomst Draco is not allowed to mention around his grandparents) accumulated on the house he and Auntie Andy (whomst he is also not allowed to mention) got, and it sounds positively exhausting. He wouldn’t know the first thing about paying off that much money (he can’t remember how much it was, but it was probably lots of monies, like at least twenty quid.)
“Ginny, be nice,” Hermione says, though she wants Colin to go home too, before turning to the newcomer. “Colin, we’re not
Everything was going so well. Harry had taken his hand and led him towards his group of friends for a game of footie, and he was allowed to play and get dirty and fall in the mud despite wearing his new trousers that his mum had just dry-cleaned. Girl-Weasley had gotten on his and Harry’s team, and they were
“Oh, I wouldn’t say that,” Lily hums. “Don’t you two remember? God, it must have been in eighty-five or eighty-six…” She looks to Narcissa. “Remember when the little ones were all outside playing courtroom?”
“So she’ll be equally partial?” Neville offers, confused at the events.
“I knew it.” Parvati points to all of the imaginary doubters as Ron mumbles, “No you didn’t”, under his breath.
“Ob-gect-shun?”
“It’s where a unicorn is willing to bless you in church,” Luna responds as the boy nods his understanding. Beside them is Padma (Parvati dragged her outside to play), who immediately indulges in her instinct to go
“Oh.” Colin scrunches up his brows, trying to understand. “Like on the telly?”
best and will know that Draco’s a prat because they’re related!” She’s not-so-secretly convinced that Nymphadora likes her better than Charlie, so this wasn’t such an uncommon statement to make.
Ignoring the use of his least favourite nickname is easy. Ignoring just how upset Harry would be if he picked a fight is not. He sticks his tongue out at Draco instead, because it seems the right thing to do to a boy whose father hated his (or so they’ve been led to believe, the reality of the situation is much too boring for the both of them to willingly comprehend.)
your best friend!”
“What’d Drakey do?” She specifically calls Draco that to bother him, ever since he was mean to Ron two years ago. He’s long stopped trying to get her to stop.
Draco looks down at his hands, “I’ve just…never heard of it.”
Cedric is indeed a very good boy. He’s been called on multiple times to babysit a good many of them, despite only barely being double digits. Ron had thought he was a bit of a goodie-two-shoes at first (especially because he was afraid his mum liked him more than she loved Ron), but Cedric soon proved to be really cool. The other children have similar stories, and he has shown to be an equally well-loved babysitter by those who liked order (such as Hermione and Padma) and those who were unhinged (Ron and Parvati) alike.
that Draco is innocent. And what kind of good boy would he be if he just let an innocent kid be executed?
The chaos of the best friend debacle (which will come back to haunt the group just five years later when Ron’s crush on Hermione is realised) causes a recess to be called. A small group of children are playing in the aforementioned inflatable pool (it’s full of water and spilled ice lollies) while others (like the Patil twins who were in new frocks) stick to playing with the bubble wands in a heated game of bubble tag.
“We’re in Harry’s front yard!” Parvati corrects, lifting up a finger. “I say we let them fight!”
“I don’t think that’s possible?” Hermione squints, turning to Padma for help. “Padma?”
Then during the visit, he’s all nostalgic retellings of their time in school and of the ‘brilliant’ way that Mister Riddle changed and challenged the school government and board. But he never talks about them playing together or pretending together.
Harry sighs and pushes his glasses up his nose, shaking his head. He shares a look with Hermione, who shrugs at him exaggeratedly and with exasperation. What can you do?
The court murmurs. This was true.
“N—No, I mean ask a big kid about Draco’s innocence.” Padma frowns, remembering the older child’s two-hour-long ramble on wyrms. Oh, it was fascinating, but she didn’t have anywhere to sit or to drink water or go to the bathroom. Miserable.
Harry never thought of it you know. Perhaps being gay or Bisexual. He wasn’t even sure now how to label his sexuality. He loved whom he loved, he loved them to bits.
Dusting himself off he walked up to the door. Which opened just as he was about to knock. “ Evening Potter. Come on in. The food took longer than expected so its just finishing up.” Malfoy said, a bit cold.. but he was trying, stepping aside. “Evening to you too Malfoy. Should be fine. I can wait. “ Harry said, lowering his hand finally as he walked in and found himself a spot in one of the big chairs in front of the small fire. It seemed to be far colder up here than in the UK so the warmth of the fire was welcome.
Blaise had a grin on his face almost comparable to the one the devil wore. “Hmm, bet he was eager to do so. I remember how he stalked you. Obsessive twat. I bet he’s jerks it to…”
She said something in Norwegian. Which Helve translated for them. “She approves of you, she says your magic is strong and it is no surprise you and Draco are bound.”
“I’ll be there.” That seemed to convince him.
Once back up he put a plaster on his finger to finally stop the bleeding, handing the raven her food as he went to write a note. “Did you have to bite the writing hand? Look. Its even worse than my usual writing.. though I suppose Draco would whine about it either way.” The thought of making Malfoy cringe made him grin. “There ya go. You’re free to stay for a bit if you need to rest up.” He hummed, handing the bird the note. “Now if you don’t mind I’m going to get to bed.” He hummed, dragging himself back to bed. Sleeping soundly and forgetting about the whole damn dinner until the day of.
Draco was a bit taken aback. Realizing the others thought they were.. dating?
“yeah sure”
“Ah. I asked you to be my friend. I was severely snobbish about it. You know. On brand. But.. I meant it. I wasn’t being pressured. I meant to be friends with you and I never forgot you turned it down. I mean I can see why you did it. But it bugged the hell out of me for years.” He stole the cigarette from harry who seemed a bit to baffled to take a hit from it.
“what are you smiling at Potter? I didn’t ask you to come here for nothing. Let’s get to business.” Draco said, waking harry from his thoughts as he handed him his drink.
The process that had taken harry about 30 minutes  to complete, was finished by Malfoy in about 5 minutes.
“About what?” he asked, slowly turning to him, trying to look collected, and failing. Harry gave him a gentle smile, putting a hand on his leg, trying to assure him it was ok.
So when he finally returned that night, after a dinner with Astoria and Ollie, to a cold empty house… he finally let his emotions out. He plopped onto the floor after putting on the fire. Hugging his knees to his chest. His head on them. Fuck… he felt so alone.. now what. No Scorpius, No Astoria,  no one. He didn’t cry. He just panicked in silence for a while. Let his mind go over the stuff. Eventually his body became less tense. So he went over the other events of the day… he’s seen some of his old friends. And his old enemies.. potter… Should he write Potter perhaps? It had come up in therapy. Why not write the guy you bullied. Say you’re sorry. Talk it out, express your regrets and perhaps stop beating yourself up over the guilt? He should.. one day, when he learned to be less awkward when encountering anyone he had done wrong in the past. Who knows.. maybe he should send a letter like that one day. But not today. Not tomorrow either. Right now he had to get his stuff back together
“I don’t get it honestly. They hated each other more than anything. Look at them now. I haven’t seen Draco smile that much. Ever.”
“Weasley, whatever it is you’ve done, do I look like I have the ability to tell some tabloid about it? I would be cursed before I even set one foot in  the direction of the papers. It’s safe with me. I just need to know what happened in order to find him and convince him its not something you leave your wife and children in distress over. So, by all means. Do tell me.” He hissed it. She had tears rolling down her face. It was clearly bad.. really bad.
“Dad you told me you simply used a time turner to turn back time at night to get more sleep and to get to classes you missed.” Scorpius teased.
“Sounds good, as long as you two try not to get each other killed.” Dean teased, wrapping an arm around Seamus.
“Pick dare.”
So here he was. Fancy dinner, suited up, hair done and  smiling and nodding as Hermoine talked about work and Ron brought up how he missed them being Aurors together. It’s a wonder really, how far one could get in an conversation with just nodding along.
Harry looked at him. “You’re drunk. Its fine.”
He knew Voldemort was looking through Harry’s thoughts a lot. But Voldemort had someone to practice on a lot back then. Draco was good at redirecting his thoughts, only letting the dark lord see what he allowed him too. But it was painful. He could only imagine what Potter felt like, who had probably been even less willing and hadn’t had any practice in redirecting thoughts.
But here they were. 20 years later. Surviving, getting by. But most importantly, Draco was dropping off his very own son. He’d lost everything, his family home. His status… even his wand for most of those 20 years. But.. he’d gotten by. Now living in what was once a broken old family cabin up in the mountains in Norway, together with his… well his wife he supposed.. they didn’t talk for the most part but… they did do their best when it came to Scorpius.
The healer had told him it was natural. It was a strong spell and seeing as he hadn’t known about it and Draco wasn’t experienced in the field. All kind of stuff could have gone wrong. He was told to just, try to relax. Realize he didn’t need the caster to be there and he wasn’t missing anything. They had given him some potion to help him get over some of the worse effects and exercises to help distract him. None of it really worked but.. he managed to keep up the act pretty well. Things would be ok next Saturday. It was all going to be fine right?
“I’m sorry?”
Harry’s POV
“Again it concerns my son too Weasley.”
“I’m still sorry for what I put everyone through… but I am glad you lot found it in you to forgive me. It means a lot.” He said, nodding a soft smile in their direction. His answer seemed to please her and she shook his hand before leaving him and his friends alone again. “well then..” he muttered, looking back. Finding Potters eyes meeting his. He was surrounded by a fan club of people thanking him. He seemed just as uncomfortable as Draco felt
Draco was panting heavy, trying to calm down. Grasping his wand under himself. Harry watched him. Feeling his panic, trying to reach out to him to try to calm him down.
Harry grabbed his arm. Making him turn. “Let’s be friends now then Malfoy. Let me make up for it. “
Even after all these years, he still had trouble with these things. Falling right on his ass as he landed in front of the cabin. A big, lovely cabin which emitted warm light all over the area. Was that a coop full of chickens? He turned around as he got up. The small lights of the town far below making him take a step back, just a tad further from the edge. Harry was fine with hights… if he had a broom with him.
Whatever had spelled him. It was coming closer. Harry had stopped feeling curses hitting him about an hour or so ago. Each beat of his heart felt heavier, slower. Whatever was reaching out to him.. he was grasping at it. Reaching out. Begging it to please stay with him.
They talked some more. Planning stuff they could do that wouldn’t be to taxing on their friendship but still close enough for them to benefit from being together. Harry would quit his job for now. They would do their shopping together.
Harry sighed softly. “Albus befriended his son Scorpius. He wasn’t sure me n Gins would be ok with that. I assured him all was good. Did you know he can actually cook?” he saw his friends expressions go from surprised to shocked, making him chuckle. “Don’t worry about it really.”
He felt a little less tense when he reached the great hall. They seemed to be early. Others had gone to explore the empty halls first. See their old dorms. Draco figured he’d do that tomorrow with Scorpius and the others.. well they didn’t have kids/ their kids didn’t know their dad was Blaise Zabini.
Harry of course wouldn’t be the one to tell Draco that he himself had grabbed Harry by the collar when they went out for another smoke, telling him that he forgot where the Inn was and he needed a place to stay, that he needed Potter to look out for him because he didn’t trust the others.
“Just because I was well off doesn’t mean I cannot fend for myself Potter.”
He added the other ingredients. Looking into his spell book every once in a while, adding incantations to the potions. And three hours later, he held up a small vail full of a bright Yellow liquid.  He sighed, taking up the ritual bands, silver bracelets with wolf heads on the ends. These would bind him to finish the promise he made, or hed loose his limbs, it was an old spell, made by long dead Norse warriors, it would make him stronger during his search at night, one hell of a lot stronger and something told him. He might need that. Shaking his head and pinching his nose he drank the potion. Praying he  hadn’t messed up and would drop dead right after he swallowed the last of it.
“Dad, do we look like we would cause trouble?” Albus started, shooting a little glare at Scorpius, whom ignored it.
Malfoy smirked wide. “Good choice, I would love, absolutely adore for you to give the group your best pickup line and smolder.” He hummed, knowing full well Harry was far to awkward.
“I guess she does but listen Malfoy. Even if Ginny is going to tell you what’s up. Harry is just like this. If he doesn’t want to be found. You ain’t gonna find him. He’s more illusive than some criminals, I would know. He’ll come back in a few days and it’ll be alright.” Ron said, grumbling as he put his fork to rest. Knowing this might take a while.
So here he was. Taking a big step, moving back to London in secret. He was almost certain Potter suspected at least something was up. He wasn’t looking all to well himself.
Draco nudged him. “You’ve been doing just fine. Just toss in some Malfoy class when you want to rid of them.” he hummed, taking a sip of the drink he’d brought with him.
“M’ fine.” Was the reply as Draco snaked his hands around Harry’s waste. Squeezing weakly. “Stay with me please.” Harry chuckled. “You are fine, I’ll look out for you.” He whispered, fixing up the mess he’d made of Malfoys hair somewhat before dragging him to bed. Not bothering with sleeping clothes as he let himself get pulled down.
“Didn’t know you could cook Malfoy, this looks lovely.” Harry smirked tossing back the last of his Gin tonic when Malfoy wasn’t looking.
“Very true Potter.”
“You have no right to say no Malfoy.” Ron huffed. Quite excited to get into some juicy stuff.
Why. Why did he drink so much. He remembered… did he do a shot race with Longbottom last night? Did Hermoine update him on the latest politics while he leaned on Potter because he was “The only sane one left in this goddamn bar” while he pointed at Pansy and Blaise trying to learn a spell from Luna and giggling like morons…. Everything hurt. He groaned, peaking through his lids. Oh no to bright. Keeping those closed. “Skadi. The potion… Please.. he muttered.” Holding his hands out. Expecting a caw and wing flapping.
He smiled when the small barn owl landed on his shoulder. She knew she wasn’t allowed to do that. But she did it anyway. Cooing softly and patiently as Draco gathered up his stuff and got inside. Only opening the letter as he poured himself a cup of nice and hot coffee and seated himself in his favorite chair by the fire. Daisy by his side for pets and some support.
“We’ve been trying to recruit you  Draco. You’ve become quite illusive these days.” New guy spoke. “but seeing as you broke in so desperately to save Potter. I don’t think we have much use for you as a member. Perhaps we could control you but at this point. You’re better off dead. You’re worth more as a ghost member. Don’t worry. We’ll put some of our actions in the Malfoy name. your family will be great again. We’ll have your boy part of us and…”
“No I… Why don’t you sit down. I’ll explain what I know.” He tried to not look phased. But he was quite surprised Harry had found him this soon. He didn’t really want to tell him they had to practically stay together as much as possible to avoid getting sicker.
“So. You put on the cloth first, like this… then, the saddle, make sure it is off the shoulder a little.. connect the girth and pull it tight. We’ll tighten it more when you get on… that’s the stirrup Harry.” Helve explained it all kindly, Harry found it easy to talk to him. He started to understand what Draco saw in him.
Soon Dean joined them. sitting across from them. Making some small talk. The dogs were still at his feet. Malfoy kept eyeing them like they were going to eat him alive. Barely managing to keep a straight face.
By the time he came by it was noon. 3pm to be exact. Shakily he sat up. At least he wasn’t dead. Though he didn’t feel too far off it. He hadn’t thrown up, but he had some spots on his face, oxygen deprivation. His eyes were red and he looked like he hadn’t slept in 8 weeks. the stains of tears still on his cheeks. Groaning he picked himself up. Ordering some food to be brought into his room. Not feeling ready to go outside and search potters Magic out.
Blaise’s response had been much shorter, but just as meaningful. Leaving Draco with a sharp sting of guilt. Had he really abandoned his friends like that?
When they woke him up he froze. They had arrived. “Maybe I should go back.. I don’t wanna see the Thestrals and.. I don’t want to see anyone.” He whispered. Pansy looked at him, smiling softly. “It’s going to be fine Malfoy. Were here with you.” Jackson opened his mouth but seeing Draco’s distress he decided not to ask. Instead he put a hand on his shoulder. “You’re not alone.” He smiled, and Draco gave in. he didn’t have much of a fight in him anymore. Thankfully no sight of Potter yet. That was good at least. Oh great, now that he though of him he sensed his magic. He wasn’t close. But he was most definitely here. Probably in the castle.
That would have to do. Casual yet formal and to the point. Looking at daisy he sighed. Maybe he should invest in another bird. Daisy was small, and truth be told, she was getting old. She wouldn’t be able to handle another flight to England so soon again. Especially to deliver two letters. And to be really honest… having a buddy around wouldn’t be too bad. He had the space. Plus he was in dire need of a trip to the Norwegian  version of the diagonally  anyway.
“Will you be good to him?” he asked turning to harry. “I know you have been nice so far. But I have to ask.. will you be good to him? When he came to Norway he could never smile. I do not know much of the war you fought. but no man should feel broken like that.”
The other flashed a small smile.
Harry Potter.. Draco looked up to him you know. When they were kids. Potter had good loyal friends, talent and overall people who loved him. And oh God had Malfoy been jealous. After initially being rejected as a friend Draco had done some moronic things to get his attention. Riling potter up with his badges in fourth year. It was funny to see Potter be an actual person and get pissed off over trivial things. Not the great savoir of the wizards, just a boy getting pissed off at another dumb boy wanting nothing to be liked by him.
“moron.”
“Leaving like that. Putting my son at risk. Making your kids upset. How dare you?!” he barked. Walking up to Potter, wanting to add another bruise to his collection. He walked back off again, it took a lot to do that. “You could have gotten him killed potter. Storming off like a stupid moron.” He yelled at him. “I don’t know what kind of imbecile you are but I am this close to kicking your ass.”
“Sure Potter, I’ll chaperone you so you wont get lost.” Draco rolled his eyes dramatically.
He popped his wand up the sleeve if his white button up. An old trick he had learned from Pansy, one last look in the mirror and he was off to meet his friends. Chin up, chest forward he left the Inn. Walking through the, despite it being late, still lively streets of Diagonally until he reached the restaurant the had agreed to meet at. Spotting his friends, who apparently also liked to be 30 minutes early he couldn’t help but stop in his tracks for a moment. Staring at them. they were so happy, they were healthy, smiling, and there. He took a deep breath, a pleasant smile on his face as he walked up to them. “Pansy? Blaise?” he asked softly. Pansy immediately got up. “Draco oh my.. I barely recognize you!” she exclaimed, almost stumbling over her chair as she went to pull him into a tight hug. “it’s been so long” she uttered, only letting go after a little bit, quickly wiping her eyes. She had definitely become less of a bitch and more emotional.
But he did it. His line was interrupted by a little drunk hiccup in the middle but: “Have you been covered in bees recently? I just assumed, because ya look sweeter than honey.” Was definitely new and absolutely horrible.
“I wonder… if I had just taken a second to get to know you if things would’ve ended differently…”
“That’s.. much broader than a broom.”
It seemed that after Voldemort had died.. or disintegrated into dust, Harry was in fact able to study fairly well when he could actually focus on the subjects offered. He had become quite the skilled wizard. He had changed a lot… and now. Now he was bored. He felt empty. Without a real goal. He’d never enjoyed the spotlight. He enjoyed helping others, surely. And thank Merlin there were still people on this earth that didn’t know about Potter the golden boy and saw him as just another curse lifter. Hoping he could help em out for a quick buck.
“What? Hes grown out of his awkward phase finally. I know a good man when I see one. The Weasley… well he looks like one expects of a Weasley. Overworked and overtired.”
I tried my best to portray the relationships and what I know of them but it just doesn’t feel quite right. }
He took her up, looking her over, hoping to find a blood feather, a feather that had broken off and was still bleeding, she seemed to have known what was going to happen and gnawed at one of her flying feathers, he plucked it out, thanking her softly as he healed the wound immediately. Letting blood from the feather dripped into a vail.
Malfoy spotted the snitch first. Smirking at Potter as he dove for it. Making the other his as he went after him. The game under them seemingly being dropped as they dropped down, fast. Neither of them willing to turn away as the ground inched closer. The snitch only turned about 2 meters off of the grass. Both harry and Draco chasing it back up, zigzagging across the field. Seemingly attached at the hip. They reached out to the small golden ball, attempting to shove each other off of their broom before… back down again. They were too distracted with teasing the other as they dove.
“Potter?” he asked hoarsely.
It burned, badly. Like his throat had been set on fire, the remains of it dropping into his stomach, burning its way through there, he choked out as he dropped to his knees, wheezing for air, trying his best not to scream as he felt the bands tighten slightly  around his arms. Skadi hopped up to him concerned. He shook his head  to make her keep her distance, before his head started spinning and he blacked out. Vivid memories, colorful and too bright for Draco’s eyes, making him feel sick passing in front of his eyes. Too strong of a potion probably.
“And of course Harry Potter has to be talented at everything he does. Sod off you arse.” Draco snickered, sitting back ever so slightly and going into a gallop. “Lean back a little, follow the horse. He called back, watching as Sigyn, who seemed to have fate Harry would stay on speed after him. He chuckled, watching him struggle ever so slightly before getting a hang of it.
As the ordered their drinks, the conversation of what’s your life like now came up.
“If anyone would have told me I would have to be the one to break to you what technology is. I would’ve called them insane.”
“Merlin, you really needed that huh.”
“Well. Since all of you so graciously stayed, I would love to bring up something I’ve been thinking about for a while now.. A reunion. The year 8 class and spouse. One big gathering. I sent an owl out last night and McGonagall has offered us to gather at Hogwarts the night of the Halloween party as the kids will celebrating in the quidditch field. What are your thoughts.”
Without looking up or even really knowing whom he was going with he let himself be guided to the outside. Taking a deep breath before taking the cigarette handed to him, closing his eyes as he pressed it to his lips. Taking a deep huff.
They said there goodbyes. Helve seemed concerned still but decided it would be best to give his friend some alone time to settle down.
Harry wouldn’t be the one to tell Draco that he had agreed and rudely invited himself and the others to Ron’s because “They were close and no one was in a state to apperate home safe”. And how Hermoine paired them anyway because that would look right and trustworthy.
“I mean it is understandable. There’s a thin line between hate and love. They were on opposite sides, both on the extreme ends.. there must be comfort in knowing they understand each other. more than you or I ever could.” Hermoine said softly, looking at Pansy.
So he found himself an empty cabin, rubbing his by now painful arms. He would have to find a counter spell soon, they were growing too tight, on one side the band was starting to cut into his arm slightly. Today he found however, they hadn’t tightened at all. It was the same as two days ago.. he could worry about that later to be honest. He was just tired now. Sleep sounded nice right? He made himself comfortable curling into the hard bench, Skadi on his lap for pats and…
“So you’re divorcing? I’m sorry to hear that Potter.”
By the time Draco came back, Hermoine had already made them all breakfast and she insisted he’d at least stay for that. it was surprising how much she was like Ms. Weasley nowadays. Fussing over everyone. Harry was almost certain she just craved some personal contacts. Her job prevented her from a lot of close contacts so she kept those she knew close.
“We’re fine… well at least for the most part.” A sigh of relief fell over the other players. Followed by laughter over the whole ordeal. No major injuries apart from the ribs. Which Dean healed because Draco was in no state to do that himself.
“So you’re actually taking his side now Harry?! What’s wrong with you!  You know I put up with everything you do. You’re never here, and when you are you’re up here. Filing those damn rapports!” she was screaming at this point, her face as red as her hair. Harry really fucked up this time.
Once back home, he added a short “The raven nips.” At the bottom of his letter before tying it to the bird together with a mug, a quick makeshift portkey. “now do be quick Skadi, when you return ill have a proper home ready for you.” He smiled, before sending the bird off.
After the dinner with Potter going quite well, Draco decided that it might be time to contact his old friends Pansy and Blaise. Not Goyle. He’d heard of Gregory, a lot more than he’d like. Last time being on the front page of the Daily Prophet for being wanted. Rumors were being spread about Goyle trying to restart some of what the dark lord had left behind. It was said he was gathering crowds of ex and new members in the underground trying to restore the pure bloodlines.
After some more conversating and talking about their lives, Harry and Draco decided it was time to Floo home. Landing in his apartment.
Draco’s POV
The dogs, named Cherry and Peaches, seemed to pick up on Draco’s uneasiness about them. curiously checking him out. This resulted in Malfoy almost losing all his composure as he leaned into Potters touch. Eventually Harry asked if the dogs could be taken away because allergies. Muttering an you owe me to Draco. Who seemed to be able to breathe again. He wasn’t a big fan of dog. He had ran into Fluffy, Hagrid’s hell beast once.. never trusted a dog since.
“Still Malfoy.”
For my story, Draco suffers from pretty severe PTSD. I will be basing it of some of my own experiences with the disorder. But I am open to criticism. He’s distanced himself a lot from the wizarding world. Living far from England and up in the mountains, fending for himself and his family most of the time. He’s learned to enjoy a simple life and get by with distraction after distraction. He's taken up fishing and other muggle activities. Living a mondaneish life.
“Git.”
Soon more people filled up the hall, some Draco recognized, some he didn’t anymore. He got quite a few glares but… overall it wasn’t too bad.
Stupid Potter getting himself into trouble on his nice Friday evening he was supposed to be reading right now. Enjoying a lovely wine after a hot bath. He probably still smelled like the damn horses. The idea of it only pissed him off further.
Liked by Harry Potter… Perhaps he did have a little crush on Harry as a kid. I mean was it really that weird? Hate and love weren’t too far off of each other right? Not anymore though. Draco had come to terms with the fact it would be better to not form any deep emotional connections but friendships with people. It was for the best really. He was too unstable. And being gay wasn’t something he would ever really accept him to be. he and his mom were talking again and he didn’t want her to have to deal with that. No. he and potter were friends finally, at least he considered him a friend and he would like to keep it that way. For the years to come.
Harry burst out in laughter. Making Draco raise a brow. “Enlighten me.”
“It’s absolutely ridiculous. You might’ve bought your way into the team but you didn’t lack the skill to back it up.” Seamus huffed, leaning against his husband.
Hermione had been able to get in. only to tell Harry it wasn’t looking good. Draco had become paranoid, badly. There had been a strange bruising around his arms where the bands were. But he didn’t want to go in on it. Hermione had tried to talk it through with him. But he didn’t seem open to any kind of help and after she discussed the manners she had been allowed in for. He had kindly urged her to leave him be again.
That shut Malfoy up. Harry got him there. “Fuck you Potter.”
“And so you slept with him without perhaps, opting to tell potter it might be better you both move on without one another.” Malfoy said, his voice actually kind, soft. The one he only used to talk to Scorpius most of the time and Astoria when he had suggested they’d move on.
Harry shrugged, lighting a cig. “You actually want one or is there more you need to fuss about.”
Knocking on the door of a single standing, adorable house in some middle class neighborhood. The knocks awoke what sounded like two big dogs. Their barks loud and clear as they came up to the door. Being shushed by Dean, whom opened the door with a young girl on his arms. “Oh you two are early! I was just about to put Jenny to bed, come on in!” he smiled kindly. Jenny seemed to shy away, making her father chuckle as he let the others in. “She’s a bit shy, Seamus is in the kitchen over there, but you can take a seat in the living.” He pointed them to the room, walking upstairs with Jenny. Two old English bulldogs following him.
“What can I offer you, wine? Beer? Gin tonic? Martini?“ Malfoy said, leaning on the back of the other chair. “figuring we might need some drinks to get this whole conversation going.” He tried a smile. Harry Smiled back. “I guess I’d like a Gin tonic. Half and half.” He hummed. Watching Draco. He hadn’t noticed last time since it had been up. But Draco’s hair was longer. Just over his shoulders and had a slight wave. He also hadn’t grown much. Harry was at least a head taller now which made him grin.
There was a short applause. Some sighs of relief, people were glad she didn’t bring up the past events and soon the great hall was filled with music, talking and drinking.
Now please do remember that you do not owe me. In any way. Do not attempt to repay me. Keep away. The binding spell should lift soon.
Either way he stepped into the store. Smiling at the keeper. No one here knew about his past. He was welcome everywhere.
Harrys POV
{ sorry not sorry but there’s a dragon prince reference because two of my friends who be reading this have watched that show and got me into it and it just kinda works. Also mentions of physical violence. this is a longer one. I haven't been able to update as soon as I'd like due to working again. Uploads will be less frequent but i will make them longer as i do write everyday when I find the time.}
{many POV switches up ahead. Mentions of a panic attack (indicated with *) Also some cursing and descriptions of violence. if this is too much for you, you can skip this chapter. I'll add a small summary to the next one.}
“As long as you need.”
Chapter 3 is underway}
The damn had been crossed  out with sharpies. He must’ve gotten it before they had Jenny.
Hermoine seemed lost in thought. “You know what.. this is good. This is great actually. If harry potter and Draco Malfoy can be friends. So can others be with ex death eaters. There’s been a rising amount of attacks on ex members again recently, perhaps this could help. Could you discuss this with him.. its been 20 years. A reunion wouldn’t be a bad idea.”
Draco took a shaky breath, he didn’t feel ready. But it was safe here. So he cast a silencing spell over the both of them. “Talk then Potter.” He crossed his arms, standing in front of him. Making himself look bigger than he felt.
He awkwardly took a seat with them. softly greeting them, taking another shot before… “Malfoy want a smoke. You look like you need one.”
“Not really asking Potter, it’s bad enough I slept in the same bed as you.” There was a devious little gleam in his eyes.
It turned out Draco was very fond of the sound of Jazz.
So that’s what he was looking forward too. he had picked a lovely dark blue suit. It was in just a week and he was really looking forward to it. Hermione told him not to be as excited and to not expect too much. But Harry couldn’t help it. The binding spell hadn’t been lifted, that’s what a healer had told him when he went to see them. he had been feeling miserable, horrible and dreadful, like a piece of him was missing.
From a little distance, pansy and Hermoine had found each other. looking in their direction.
“No.. it was a headline about Harry hanging out with an ex de…. With you..” Ginny said softly.
Harry.”
Love Scorpius.”
Smiling he read the letter. Scorpius was telling about how school had been lately and how he was glad his father was closer now. Daisy was excited to be delivering letters again. The old one eyed barn owl didn’t seem to really care but. What could he say about it. His kid had a vivid imagination and really cared about his bird.
“No, I have to take care of the horses. Loki will be sad without you so I will take him on a long ride when I am home.” Helve replied. “will you be ok?”
“I know. I really hope Mormor can find out where I messed up. I’m sad to leave you behind like this.” He was offered a kind but worried smile. Helve’s grandmother had insisted he called her his granny too, in Norwegian of course. She found Miss Olsen or just Annie too correct. Besides after hearing Draco never knew his grandmother.. she became his too. not taking no for an answer at all.
“Nice to meet you too sir.”
“Dare me.”
When the conversation seemed to come to an end, Harry decided it might be time to ask. “What did Mormor tell you? you seemed quite upset earlier..” He asked it soft enough for Draco to ignore it if he didn’t feel like answering.
“It is quite strange Harry.. I know you were there for the trails but after..”
“Doing quite well. After my mother passed I got her savings. A lot, so I set up a few bars of the kinky variety. Business has been very. Very good.” Blaise smirked. “Married 3 times so far. Following her footsteps well.” He hummed, turning to Pansy.
It took him a few more sips of coffee and being lost in thoughts before it dawned upon him.. his boy had befriended one of Potters boys.. a complete disaster… this could mean a lot of trouble for his kid. For him. For everything… what if potter got mad. He couldn’t put Scorpius through that. Now he would have to write potter a letter….
“Draco I just gotta say if this by any chance is you moving here. Please do. I haven’t slept this much and good in ages. I know we shouldn’t be giving in to the binding spell but I can’t take it anymore. I haven’t slept so horrible since just after the war. My magic is failing me and…”
Blaise smiled at him. “Good to see you” he said, hugging him for a short moment.
Pansy making Ron wear hemione’s bra wasn’t too far off. By the time they were done Hermoine had lost abut they a decided the last of Draco’s strong liquor for everyone was fair enough. They talked for a bit more but one by 1am everyone left. Draco had fallen asleep about 20 minutes ago. Resting his head on Harry’s shoulder. Not that anyone had really noticed. They were all pissed after all.
Goodbye. May the gods be on your side,
Scorp had a harder time saying goodbye. Nearly tearing up when Draco hugged him. “It’s going to be ok buddy. I love you. You know that right? You’ve got some great friends and I’ll see you during Christmas break.” Draco smiled softly, kissing his forehead. “Now chin up, I am so proud of you. Keep up the amazing work.” He said, letting him go. Scorpius nodded heavily, doing as told. Saying a quick “I’ll see you soon dad!” as Draco got into the train.
He sat himself down beside Neville, Malfoy flopped on the chair beside him, getting a stare from Pansy, but she kept her mouth shut. “So… how are the hangovers?” Ron asked, crumbs flying out of his mouth as he spoke.
They talked for a bit more, harry went to greet his other kids and godchild Teddy, while Draco took his time to meet Albus and Scorpius, letting himself be dragged around the castle. When he got some time apart with Scorpius he sighed softly. Telling him about the divorce, which Scorpius took surprisingly well. Wishing his father whatever would be best for them as long as they didn’t make him choose between either, to which Malfoy had responded he and Astoria would never. They were still friends after all.
“Harry you hated him your whole time at school and now telling me you and Malfoy are having cozy dinners at his place chatting about the kids.”
“come on Draco. Lets go. I’m certain Scorpius is excited to see his dad looking this fine.” Pansy smiled, taking his hand. “On three we all grab the Portkey hun.” She smiled at her boyfriend, who’s name was Jackson, born in France but moved to Egypt at age 7. His English had a slight accent but it wasn’t terrible. He seemed friendly enough.
{ Found out rose is the same age as Albus and Scorp so she’s at school too, Hugo and lilly are friends and Ginny watches them most of the time.
There was a bit of silence. “I mean. It would be great to see what everyone has been up to.. but you know how  there is still bad blood between a the other houses and Slytherin for our.. actions back then.” Pansy muttered, looking around.
