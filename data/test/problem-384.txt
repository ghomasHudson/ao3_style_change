“Why?”
He scans over the clusters of people gathered in the hall, eyes roaming for black hair and a pair of glasses. He sees Granger and Weasely huddled around the rest of the Weasley family, surrounding a body lying on the ground. Draco feels a pang of sympathy towards Weasley.
Draco locks himself in the toilet, and throws up the contents of his empty stomach. He gives in to the pain, and cries and cries and cries. Sobs wreck through his frame in violent tremors, and Draco clutches at his chest, because he has lost something he will never be able to reclaim.
Harry looks at him, and something in his eyes clears. The corners of his mouth pull up ever so slightly.
“That’s my wand you’re holding, Potter,” Draco says, pointing his mother’s wand at Harry. Harry readjusts his grip on Draco’s wand, and something swirls at the pit of Draco’s stomach at the thought of Harry wielding Draco’s wand.
“Are you alright darling?” Pansy whispers in his ear quietly. Draco nods, but when she doesn't reply, he looks up at her. Pansy is staring across the hall, and when Draco follows her vision, he sees that Granger and Weasley are looking towards him, whispering to each other. They look away guiltily when Draco catches them.
Sitting at his table facing the pathway, Draco stares out of the window and watches his father walking up to the iron gates, accompanied by two Death Eaters cloaked in black robes.
“No. I was on
But he’s here, and Draco is holding him in his arms, and he’s very much alive.
Draco instructs Tinky to do as she is told and not relay any of the information she is given to any other person in the house, and she leaves, looking more terrified than he has ever seen her.
Harry looks dreadful, and is almost unrecognisable with his face swollen up, distorting his every feature. Draco wonders if Harry had jinxed himself so as to not be recognised, but considers it to be a work of Granger’s.
Draco lands a kick to his ribs, and drapes his stupid cloak over him.
Draco falls back onto his pillow, and tries to make peace with the fact that someone that once loved him, has now placed scars all over his body.
Then, he’s gone. He runs back to Weasely’s side, and leaves Draco feeling colder than he has felt in his entire life. Draco scrambles to his feet just as he hears his mother shout Dobby’s name.
Draco had known it was Harry, from the shuffle of his feet as he was shoved forward. He had known from the jet black mop of his dishevelled hair, and from the lean lines of his body.
“Everything makes so much sense now,” Harry begins, his face lighting up considerably. “It was like– like I kept being magnetised to you. But I didn’t know why. I thought it was because you annoyed me, but you didn’t because you barely even talked to me and– and it drove me crazy.”
“He cares about you, you know,” she tells him, looking at him with pity. “Harry would do the same thing for you,” she says, and Draco nods, unable to speak through the lump in his throat.
Summer passes through a haze of darkness and misery. The Dark Lord takes up residence in his house, and he appoints Draco as the youngest member to join his command. Draco knows that he is punishing Draco for his father winding up in Azkaban, but he also knows that rejecting such a proposal will put his mother at risk.
Draco feels himself falling, his legs giving out beneath him. There’s a hand gripping his upper arm, tight enough to cause bruising. The hand keeps him hoisted up on unsteady feet, and Draco leans towards the steady weight beside him.
“Malfoy,” he scowls, and Draco feels that chasm in his heart delve deeper.
He notices the girl say something, and shove an envelope into his hands before running away. He knows what it is even before he sees the pink tinge on Harry’s cheeks.
He hears the soft patter of feet on the wooden flooring, and when he blinks through his teary eyes, he sees a dark figure looming over him. Draco feels dread filling his veins, and he can do nothing but lie on the floor, limp and helpless.
When they pass him, Weasley sends him a nod, and Draco knows that he knows. Granger turns back and gives Draco a sympathetic smile, and Draco can do nothing but stare at Harry’s retreating back. They disappear into an empty compartment.
Draco stands up on unsteady feet when more people begin to leave the hall, and a crowd gathers at the entrance hall. The crowd edges towards the front steps, and Draco feels himself being pushed forward with the throng of bodies.
As Draco gives her instructions, a scream resounds throughout the house, and Draco feels his blood run cold. He hears Bellatrix shouting hysterically, and hears the Cruciatus Curse cried out as another gut-wrenching scream pierces through the silence of the manor. From the cellars, Weasley shouts Granger’s name.
Draco lays on the ground, chest heaving as he struggles to draw air into his lungs. His neck droops to the side, and when Draco squints through the cracks of his eyelids, he sees a blurry figure walking away.
He risks a glance up towards them, and finds Harry already staring back at him. Draco feels his heart skip a beat treacherously.
“Malfoy,” she starts, her lips pulled taut into a thin line.
“I knew it,” Harry announces. “I knew it. There was no way Ron would have willingly asked you for something.”
“Help her!” Weasley continues to cry, not listening to Draco and overcome with grief.
Harry stops right in front of his table, seemingly unaware of Draco sitting only a few feet away. As though reading his thoughts, Harry looks up and catches Draco's eyes. The smile on his face wanes and disappears, and he blanches as he sees Draco.
Harry is like a buoy floating in the deep ocean, saving Draco from the waves of anguish that threatens to drown him. Draco holds on to him like a lifeline.
Harry comes forward, placing a hand on Weasely’s shoulder and trying to drag him backwards. He stares at the exchange between them in bewilderment. Draco spares him a glance, and when Harry notices, he shoots him a withering glare. Draco’s heart skips a beat, and he looks away.
Draco wishes he had burnt to death in the Room of Requirement, rather than to stand here with half of his soul missing.
The Dark Mark thrashes wildly under his skin, and Draco knows it’s only a matter of minutes until the Dark Lord graces the manor with his presence.
Draco almost says, as his name sits comfortably on the tip of Draco’s tongue.
Draco thinks that being murdered by the Dark Lord would hurt much less than being mangled by the boy he adores.
Panic floods through his veins and Draco clings to Harry, his arms wrapped firmly around Harry’s chest, so tightly that his bones ache. Draco’s heartbeat thunders against Harry’s back, and he ducks his face into the nape of Harry’s neck.
Draco remembers now, how he had seen Harry grinning at her, his eyes shining and a pink flush on his cheeks.
He has to see Harry one last time, he needs to.
Over the uproar, Draco hears Hagrid’s booming voice crying out.
Draco gives Tinky his own pillowcase and announces her a free elf. She cries and bows down at his feet, begging him not to let her go and Draco feels guilt swirl at the pit of his stomach. She is far too young to be stranded on her own.
“Hold it, Potter,” Crabbe says, and Harry turns around.
So Draco stays back. He ducks into a corridor amidst the evacuation of students and Crabbe and Goyle follow him, suspecting that he’s up to something. Draco curses silently but allows them to trail behind him.
It escalates further when he aims the Killing Curse at Granger with no hesitation, and rounds on Harry. Fury courses through Draco’s veins, and he digs his fingernails into Crabbe’s arm until he feels the skin beneath his fingertips tear apart, and seizes his thick arm, redirecting his wand to a pile of furniture.
His moment of relief however is disturbed by Granger’s scream, and Draco quickens his pace, grabbing the goblin with him in his haste. He enters the drawing-room and shoves the goblin towards Bellatrix.
“Do you think he’s killed someone or something?” Harry asks suddenly, and Draco sees Weasley flinch. Draco’s heart twinges inside his chest, because Harry couldn’t be more wrong. If only he knew the truth, he would not be sitting there accusing Draco of murder.
It feels far too cold suddenly, and Draco shivers.
Draco feels sharp pain ripping through his chest and face, and he topples over his feet and onto his back to the pool of water gathered on the ground, crying out in agony.
“This could be the scar, yes?” His father asks gleefully, and Draco feels sick.
Draco sniffles, blinking against the tears pricking his eyes. Harry is warm and smells of smoke and sweat and
Draco stands to the side with a bated breath, watching them taunt one another. Then, Harry says, “the true master of the elder wand was Draco Malfoy,” and Draco feels a dozen pairs of eyes turn to him as the words leave Harry’s mouth.
When Draco boards the Hogwarts express, he sees Harry with Granger and Weasley behind him, in search of an empty compartment.
Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived, with Draco Malfoy, the Death Eater. Even the mere thought of it is ridiculous, but Draco knows that despite their differences, they had created something beautiful together.
“I can’t– I can’t be sure,” he struggles out. “No. No, I don't think so,” he says, keeping his eyes trained on Harry. Harry’s head jerks upwards slightly, as though he’s trying to look at Draco, and Draco feels his heart lurch violently, certain that Harry has given himself away.
Harry steps forward until he’s in Draco’s space. He reaches out and takes Draco’s hand in his own warm and calloused one. He squeezes gently and warmth floods Draco’s veins.
Draco incinerates the parchment, and continues shoving his belongings into his trunk carelessly. His hands tremble violently, and he drops a bottle of ink. It stains one of his white shirts, and he drops to his knees, chest heaving as he struggles to breathe in through the weight pressing on his chest.
“I love you,” Draco whispers into Harry’s lips, pressing the words onto his skin. He needs Harry to know, he needs him to know so badly that his bones ache with desperation, because if he does not make it out of this alive, Draco will take his words with him to the grave, and he will never forgive himself. Harry needs to know that Draco loves him, will love him unconditionally and ceaselessly.
The noise increases tenfold as house-elves swarm the entrance hall. He sees Tinky amongst the throng of their small bodies, carrying a knife larger than herself and charging ahead. He watches with amazement as she drives the knife into the shin of a Death Eater, and he crumples under her attack. She draws back and plunges the knife into his thigh, spraying blood everywhere, and runs away before the Death Eater can retaliate, disappearing into the crowd. Draco feels oddly proud.
But now, Draco realises, his father is nothing more than a coward and a hypocrite. The only thing he cares about is power and esteem, to boast of his wealth and blood status. If it were not for his father and his greed, they would not be hosting a bloodthirsty lunatic in their house. They would not have to live in fear under their own roof.
Werewolves and snatchers and Death Eaters prowl the grounds of the manor, tainting the very soil that it was built upon.
A scream rips itself free out of the depths of his chest and resounds across the hall. Draco feels his mind going numb with agony.
Draco sits at the end of a bench pushed up against a wall and tries to read what Kingsley Shacklebolt is saying. It’s been more than an hour now, and for the last forty-five minutes, he has been talking to his parents. He doesn't even know where his friends are, and he just hopes they’re not amongst the bodies being moved.
Bellatrix addresses Draco then, and he jolts in surprise. She orders him to take the snatchers outside, and Draco sees the faint outlines of a plan beginning to form in his mind.
The hour is up.
The anger and frustration that he had kept locked away, bursts through like a dam breaking, and he stamps down on Harry’s face, hard enough to hear the breaking of bones. He doesn’t feel sorry, not in the slightest, and Draco smiles wickedly, revelling in the sight of blood that oozes out into his open mouth.
Draco sits on a table pushed against a window in the corner. Pansy finds him there while he’s working on a Potions essay.
He tells his mother that he had accidentally handed her a pair of his trousers without realising. She stares at him for a moment, suspicious, but nods, muttering something about obtaining more house-elves. He sighs in relief.
It’s better this way, he thinks, no one will suspect a thing. Harry is freed from any affiliations with Death Eaters, with the darkness that Draco had saved him from.
Weasely’s eyes are red, and under the light from his wand, his cheeks glisten with tear tracks that run down his face. When he sees Draco, he comes stumbling forward. For a dizzying moment, Draco thinks Weasley is about to attack him, but with a sob, Weasely grabs Draco by the lapels of his jacket, and holds him with a firm grip.
As he walks in, however, he sees Greyback, holding Harry and Weasley by the scruffs of their necks and pushing them towards the cellars. Draco panics, not wanting to be seen, and sneaks into the mudroom closest to the door. He waits with a bated breath and listens as the footsteps fade away.
“Have you heard, darling?” She asks, and the hesitancy in her voice makes Draco look up at her. She avoids his eyes, and Draco’s brows draw together in concern.
Draco immerses himself in his schoolwork and the increasing amount of homework. He keeps to himself, and refrains from thinking about Harry. Pretending he doesn’t exist is easier when the Harry he once knew and loved, no longer remains.
“How did it– how did they come back?” Draco asks, and he isn’t sure he wants to know. “The memories.”
Draco turns back to his food, moving it around his plate.
Draco lies through gritted teeth, and tells Snape that it was because hadn’t been sleeping well, which isn’t exactly false. Snape regards him with narrowed eyes for a moment, seeing right through his fib.
He smells the coppery stench of blood and realises that it’s his own, when he glimpses his hands covered in red. He hears someone screaming, and someone else muttering something unintelligible, but he can’t focus on anything besides the mind-numbing pain across his abdomen.
“Why was I on your side?”
Harry stuns his father and Draco ducks behind an armchair to escape his spell. Bellatrix has Granger’s limp form held up with a knife to her throat, and Draco sees blood collect and trickle down her pale neck as the knife pierces her skin.
“Tinky,” Draco starts cautiously. “Tinky, I need you to do something for me.” Tinky turns to him, her ears drooping down as her wide eyes stare up at him fearfully.
“I see you have done what I had advised you,” Snape begins, and Draco feels his stomach twist uncomfortably. “It was a wise decision, that boy was merely a ludicrous hindrance in your path,” he says, and Draco feels a flare of anger shoot through his veins.
Draco grits his teeth, and assures Snape that he will return his mother’s letters, before walking away briskly.
“So it was me? You were talking about keeping me safe,” he says, staring at Draco with a faraway look in his eyes, and Draco remembers that conversation in the library, all those months ago. It seems like a lifetime away now.
He traces the lines of Harry’s face, memorises the shade of green of his eyes, and imprints his loving gaze onto the backs of his eyelids. He commits the feeling of Harry’s lips on his own to memory, and hides it away in a corner of his heart.
“You don’t know him, he would if he joined
Snape hands him a vial of Dreamless Sleeping Potion, and stands with his hands clasped behind his back.
The man that young Draco had thought to be the best person in the world; caring and kind and
Draco had wanted to see Harry one last time, but now, Draco wishes he were blind.
Draco wishes he would give him a Painless Potion instead.
Draco ducks his face into his neck and breathes in a lungful of Harry. He tightens his hold, trying to meld Harry to his side.
Someone whimpers, and it’s the saddest thing Draco has ever heard. It takes several seconds for Draco to realise it’s himself whimpering, when Blaise tightens the grip on his arm and hisses in his ear to shut up. Pansy’s hand finds his, and she laces her fingers through his, squeezing tightly. They both hold onto him like an anchor, keeping him from drifting away.
Draco waits until his breathing evens out, and lets out a shaky breath. He detangles himself gently from Harry’s limbs, and sits beside Harry, watching him for a few moments.
Overhead, an opening appears, and Draco sighs in relief. His breath hits the back of Harry’s neck, and he feels Harry shiver in response. Draco squeezes him tighter.
His usual blank expression is tinged with concern. His mother has clearly told his godfather to keep an eye on him, and it makes something akin to irritation swirl in Draco’s gut. Snape shares his mother’s sentiments, because he too thinks that Draco is far too young and far too irresponsible to carry out such a task, as though he does not know what he has gotten himself into.
He hears voices shouting, and feels his stomach lurch violently. He has offered Bellatrix an entire supply of victims for her insatiable bloodthirst, and all those lives lost will be his fault. The blood of her victims will be painted on Draco’s hands.
Whenever his thoughts find Harry, Draco has to remind himself that it doesn’t matter what Harry thinks or does, because he did this to keep Harry safe. It doesn't matter that he will be nothing more than a Death Eater to Harry, because as long as Harry’s safety is ensured and his life is saved, Draco doesn't care if he becomes a bloody psychopath.
Because without Harry, there is no reason for him to continue living. Because without Harry, there is no Draco.
Granger and Weasley stay silent.
He hears the happy cry of a baby phoenix as it soars amongst the clouds, and Draco knows that now, everything will be alright.
On a bleak day in the middle of March, Harry Potter is dragged into his house, bound and gagged.
“Well, Draco?” His father hisses, and the stench of alcohol wafts up to his nose. “Is it Harry Potter?”
“Harry Potter…. Is dead!”
And with nothing but desperate hope running through his veins, Draco watches the withered figure of the Dark Lord, crumple to the ground with finality as death takes him under his shadow.
It's all for Harry.
Myrtle floats around him, speaking to him softly, and he cries even harder at her sympathy. He draws in a shuddering breath, and looks into the mirror again. At the very corner stands a figure behind him, a mop of black hair and wired glasses.
Through the slits of his swollen eyes, Draco sees the familiar emerald green of Harry’s eyes, and his breath hitches in his throat. His mother’s grip on his arm tightens.
Behind him, the sky glows orange with the beginnings of a gentle flame as the sun sits nestled amongst the mountains. Bright rays of sunlight pierce through the clouds, draping around Harry, and he has never looked more beautiful.
When he has the top buttons undone, he stares down at his chest in horror. His pale skin has been torn apart with deep gashes. The wounds stare back at him in a mess of bright red incisions, as though someone had ripped open his skin and hastily stitched it back together.
Granger stares at him, silently contemplating. She sighs, shaking her head slightly.
There is no sign of Harry anywhere, and a tendril of fear wraps itself around Draco. Surely Harry would not be so stupid as to give himself up.
Draco sees Hagrid place Harry onto the grass, and his neck lolls to the side, his limbs hanging limply around him. His face is covered with dirt and there’s blood smeared across his cheek and over the bridge of his nose.
The prisoners in their cellar scream into the night, and plague Draco’s dreams with their haunting cries. The drawing-room has seen more blood spilt on its wooden floors than any other battlefield in history, and the last words of its victims decorate the walls like portraits.
Pansy’s voice echoes in his mind and the words bounce around his head tauntingly.
“Yes Young Master Draco,” she says, nodding intensely. As he stares at her, he remembers Dobby, and the plan in his head begins to solidify.
There are black dots dancing across his vision and Draco begins to lose consciousness. He’s vaguely aware of someone raising him to his feet, and carrying him somewhere. The last thing he sees is a dimly lit corridor swimming in and out of focus, before everything fades to black.
He halts to a stop in front of Draco, chest heaving with exertion. Draco stands silently with his heart climbing into his throat and settling down comfortably.
Draco swallows thickly. “Great– Great Hall,” he offers.
He looks at Harry one last time, and with his heart in his throat, Draco leaves Harry.
talking about Draco and it was
The quiet conversations from the Slytherins scattered around the common room, fades away into white noise, and Pansy’s words echo in his ears hauntingly.
His parents, though, haven't seemed to notice, and Draco almost collapses with relief, but stays upright, shoulders squared back.
She strokes his hair and whispers soothingly as he tucks his face into her neck. The fabric of her jumper dampens under his cheeks, but Pansy doesn’t say anything. Draco sobs silently, and Pansy keeps holding him through his trembling. They stare out towards the lake, and Draco cries and cries until his body feels frail and exhausted.
Draco has the greatest wizard of all time at his mercy. Under the green light of the Dark Mark, Dumbledore looks frail and unsteady on his feet. Draco realises with sudden clarity that this man is old, more than a hundred years old.
“I didn’t do it for you,” Draco hisses. “I did it for him. To keep him safe,” he adds, and Draco wonders why he is so desperate for others to believe his reasoning.
He slams the compartment door shut behind him and leaves Harry in a puddle of his own blood.
He runs and runs until his lungs burn and his arms ache with Goyle’s weight. The flames lick at Draco’s heels, and he begins climbing on a tower of stacked tables to evade it. Black smoke permeates the room in thick clouds, and Draco coughs, spluttering as he struggles to regain his footing on the wobbling tower of desks.
Draco watches her walk away, and he calls out to her again. She turns around in the dark hallway, the reflection of the fire lamps catching on her shiny hair, like a beacon of light, of the last, fading wisps of hope.
“Draco,” he implores, hiccuping on a sob. “Help her! You have to help her, please.”
“Don’t,” he manages to hoarsely whisper, and the crying ceases. He hears someone say his name.
Draco stares back at him, waiting for something. He doesn’t know what.
When he awakes, five bodies litter the drawing-room, and blood seeps out through the gap between the door and the flooring. His parents remain alive and unharmed.
He knows he’s no killer, because even the mere thought of an innocent life ending by his own hands makes him sick.
Draco’s breathing sounds harsh and grating to his own ears, and he almost misses Bellatrix ordering them to drop their wands, and commanding Draco to pick them up. He moves on unsteady feet, and picks them up with trembling hands.
Harry can not be dead. That’s just not possible. He’s not supposed to die.
As though answering his prayers, Draco hears an odd sound, and he looks up and sees the crystal chandelier above them swaying precariously. It comes tumbling down onto the ground, caging Granger’s unconscious body and the goblin within it. Shards of crystals shower over the room, and one of them grazes Draco’s cheeks, spraying blood all over his hands.
Draco swallows down the words stuck in his throat. “You were far too important to risk being with me,” he says instead. Harry stares at him, green eyes peering into grey, searching and probing for something.
Draco holds him for several minutes, basking in the warmth and comfort of Harry’s weight beneath him. When he pulls away, Harry smiles at him, a bright smile that illuminates his entire face, and Draco feels his heart skip several beats, tripping and stumbling in its haste.
Draco feels a blow to his stomach, and remembers the anger reflected at him through green eyes.
Draco nods again, unable to bring himself to speak.
“Can you do it tomorrow?” He asks. “I need– I need to see him one last time,” he says, desperation tainting his voice.
The curse ceases momentarily, and over the throbbing anguish, he hears someone laughing in the distance.
Pansy is looking at him worriedly, and opposite him, Blaise has his brows drawn together in sympathy. Draco feels his stomach turn unpleasantly.
Something splatters down onto his parchment, a water droplet. Another one lands right next to it, and Draco’s vision blurs. He feels something wet slide down his cheeks, and Draco watches as the droplets soak into the parchment and the ink fades and smears across it.
He falls off the battlement, eyes fluttering shut as he plummets through the air.
“You have to,” Draco implores, swallowing through the lump in his throat. “You have to protect him. You of all people know what is going to happen now.”
Something flickers across Harry’s face, like a candle flame quivering with the wind. But it’s gone as soon as its come and Draco misses the chance to decipher what it means.
Draco stands rooted to the spot, and Harry scowls at him.
Draco watches Harry. His Harry—with his tousled black hair and piercing green eyes—and Draco wonders, if they will ever go back to being the Draco and Harry they once were.
With a deafening
Another flash of red light hits him, and excruciating pain assaults every inch of his body; an onslaught of stabbing pains crawling through him and settling into the very fibres of his being.
“I will,” she assures him, and walks away into the darkness.
She comes over to him several minutes later and tells him she has healed him to the best of her ability.
The crying is insistent, and it worsens the headache pulsating against his skull.
He feels tears prick his eyes, and he blinks up at the ceiling furiously. He’s tired, so tired of crying over Harry when he knows he had brought this upon himself.
“Protect who though?” Harry continues, oblivious to Draco standing behind him only a few feet away. “I’m surprised he even cares about someone other than himself,” Harry scoffs, and Draco suddenly feels nauseous.
“Come over to the right side, Draco,” he offers, and Draco feels a spark of hope flare inside his chest, amongst the despair and pain. He wants to, so badly, to accept the headmaster’s help. He will be safe, and his mother too, and it feels like a dream come true from the never-ending nightmare that he seems to be caught up in.
“You were the one that called Dobby?”
As he runs, weaving through the crowd and firing spells, he hears his name being called over the noise. He thinks it sounds like his mother but he cannot be sure.
Draco stills where he stands, and holds his breath, listening to what Harry is saying.
They leave, walking through the courtyard and towards the bridge. Rubble and wreckage from the destroyed parts of the castle remain scattered across the grounds, but the cold morning breeze that rushes past them, washes away the smell of smoke and fire.
He looks revolting, as though he had been mauled by a wild animal and left to die. Maybe that’s what Harry was trying to do, Draco thinks, maybe he was trying to kill Draco, trying to rid the world of one less Death Eater.
The next morning, Draco receives a piece of parchment with two words scrawled onto it.
Draco wonders what it is like to fly, to roam the skies, untethered by responsibilities and expectations. To swim against the clouds and let the wind carry him anywhere it pleases.
Draco used to admire him once, a time before he witnessed death and blood spilt with his own eyes, a time when the war was a myth from a faraway land. Draco used to stare up at his father with reverence, and he used to want to be like him.
Draco wants to rip his heart out, his bruised and battered heart, and stamp on it until it’s crushed beneath his feet, so that this awful pain he has been carrying inside him for months, will finally stop. He needs it to stop.
He sees Harry stare back at him with contempt, even when he is immobilised, and something inside Draco snaps.
The quiet murmur in the hall descends into silence. Somewhere in the back of his mind, Draco is aware that something terrible is going to happen.
Weasley and Granger both grab each of his elbows, and they turn Harry away from Draco, leaving the shop with hurried footsteps and hushed whispers. His mother watches in confusion, her gaze skipping back and forth between Draco and the Trio.
“I’ve tried. Trust me I have,” Draco murmurs. “But I can't.”
As they rush past the shop, Harry’s eyes find his own through the glass window separating them, and he keeps his gaze locked onto Draco’s, like he’s challenging Draco. With utmost difficulty, Draco tears his gaze away from Harry, and turns to Madam Malkin as she fusses over his measurements.
Draco feels heat prickle at the back of his neck, and sees flames advancing towards them. Draco grabs Goyle’s arm, and begins running. Goyle is dead weight behind him, and Draco fears that they will not exit this room without being reduced to a pile of ash.
“You don’t love me anymore?” Harry asks, and Draco thinks he hears a tinge of hope laced within his question.
Draco skips all his classes the next day and lands himself in detention.
Girl Weasley follows his line of vision, and when she sees Draco, her face darkens. She tugs at Harry's arm, but his eyes stay stuck on Draco’s. Draco blinks, and breaks away from his heavy gaze.
Hidden in his quarters, Draco scrubs his forearm under the hot water of his shower, until the skin is left raw and red, desperately trying to rid himself of the darkness swirling under his skin. No matter how hard he tries, it lays across his pale skin, motionless and tormenting.
Draco stays silent, huddled under the warm blankets, and staring out towards the lake. The door clicks shut as Blaise and Pansy take their leave.
Draco wonders what they would think if they knew the Chosen One had been romantically involved with him, the youngest Death Eater.
Pansy raises him from his chair with great difficulty, and takes him to the armchairs that are facing away from the common room and towards the windows facing the lake. He leans heavily against her side, his frame shaking even as his limbs feel like lead, and they shuffle to one of the green sofas. She gently settles him down onto it, and sits down beside him, wrapping her arms around him comfortingly.
Draco struggles to keep his face as expressionless as possible, and tries not to let his composure crumble.
Draco detaches himself from Weasely’s grip and turns back to the prisoners. He sees the goblin loitering behind Harry’s feet and he reaches behind Harry to grab the goblin by his arm. Harry, however, mistakes his sudden movement for Draco trying to attack him, and he jumps back abruptly.
“I felt like I’d lost something really important, but I didn’t know what,” Harry continues. “Like I’d lost a piece of me. And it was you all along,” Harry finishes, and Draco feels something inside him settle into place; a part of him that had been out of place for far too long, nestles itself comfortably back into its place within his heart.
He thinks of what Harry would say if he saw the mark on Draco’s arm, and imagines him recoiling in horror. Draco scrubs and scratches his arm until the skin tears apart and blood flows over the hideous brand, the water running red.
The girls from the years below, mutter indignantly, wondering what it is that Harry sees in her. They conspire together to break them apart.
He clutches Goyle’s body tighter, and tries to blink the tears out of his eyes. The acrid smoke entering his lungs makes him feel light-headed and Draco fears he will fall to his death just as Crabbe had.
“Yes. Yes, I do not doubt that,” Snape says, his gaze fixed firmly at something behind Draco. “Draco, please close the door,” he orders, and Draco does, peeking out into the empty hallway.
Amidst the haze of pain, Draco is aware of Bellatrix saying something, and he belatedly registers a yell from Weasley as he darts into the drawing-room, disarming her. In the next second, he sees Harry bolting in after him, and Draco almost shouts in frustration at their stupidity.
“Ah, yes. The one place I was avoiding,” Harry huffs out a laugh. Draco stands stiffly, his muscles frozen over.
“….keep him safe. What does that mean? Keep who safe?” Harry asks, and Draco feels his heart drop to his stomach. No. It can’t be. He couldn’t be talking about Draco, surely.
“I do,” Draco confesses with a heavy exhale. “Fuck, I do. I couldn’t stop even if I tried.”
The stark contrast of their lives creeps up on Draco, and not for the first time, he wonders how he had managed to be with Harry.
“Yeah, mate. He may be a bloody git, but I think killing someone is too extreme, even for him,” Weasley adds.
Harry nods, shoulders drooping slightly in acceptance. He stares at Draco for a moment, and from the slight crease between his brows, Draco knows he is turning his words over in his head.
“Draco, darling,” Pansy says softly, laying her warm hand over his shaking one, steadying his trembling arm. “Are you alright?”
The figure raises his arm, and Draco closes his eyes before the stream of red light hits him. Agony rips through his body, violently, and Draco howls in anguish.
Amongst the roar of the fire, Draco hears a terrible scream, and through his watery eyes, he sees Crabbe’s grip on the side of a table loosen. He falls, limbs flailing as the flames swallow him whole.
“Come,” his father says, reaching out a hand for Draco to take. “We’re going home.”
“I know. That’s why I’m trusting you to do it,” Draco says, and where she would have preened under the praise once, she now smiles sadly. Draco fights against the sting at the back of his eyes.
“Tinky,” he hisses. “What are you doing here?”
that roars into life within his bones and leaves him reeling.
Then, a familiar voice shouts,
Draco sees Granger round the corner, and she looks around sceptically before her eyes land on Draco hidden within the shadows. Draco feels his heart thudding painfully against his ribcage, and when he inhales, the breath rattles in his lungs hauntingly.
Harry’s green eyes stare down at him with an intense flame blazing in his eyes, and Draco is left breathless. Only mere inches away from Draco, he smells of sweat and dirt and
The thought of his mother has his eyes stinging with tears, and he feels sobs tremble through his frame.
it’s Harry that Draco has done all of this for. He wants to scream and cry that he loves Harry, he loves him so much to give up his own happiness to ensure Harry’s safety. But he can’t do that. He can never do that, because now, Harry will hate him like he had before, and he will think of Draco as nothing more than a Death Eater and a murderer.
She can kiss him in broad daylight, in front of his friends and family, and she can love him in the ways that Draco didn’t get a chance to.
Harry opens his mouth to argue, but Draco cuts through him. “I had to do it. I knew if he could plant images in your mind, it would only be a matter of time until he could creep around and find out about us, and I couldn’t let you be an easy target because of me.”
and Harry Potter stands in all his glory in the middle of the Great Hall. Draco nearly collapses under the weight of his relief.
Despite their upbringings, and beliefs and expectations, they are essentially cut from the same cloth; two boys thrust into a life that asks too much of them, bound and dragged into a world of black and white.
As they disappear, he looks away and watches a bird take flight against the pale blue sky.
Harry had always slept better when he was wrapped around Draco, he remembers sadly. Harry had told him as much.
He gathers the snatchers, and heaves them through the entrance hall, settling them down against the towering hedges that line the pathway to their front door. Draco considers their unconscious bodies for a moment, and knowing that Bellatrix would kill them sooner or later, Draco breaks the spell and goes back into the manor.
But with everything between them having been tipped out of balance, with everything they’ve gone through in this war, with everything they’ve seen and done, Draco isn’t sure if what he wants is what he deserves.
Draco pushes his plate away, and stands up abruptly. He walks out of the hall as quick as his feet can carry him, and tries to pretend he doesn't hear Harry’s laugh echoing across the Great Hall.
and from the heat of his body sprawled upon Draco’s own, Draco’s stomach twists into knots, something visceral swirling hot with longing, a
“No, you can’t. Nobody can,” Draco nearly shouts in frustration. “I have to do this, or he’ll kill me. I’ve got no choice.”
Draco takes his father’s hand and stands up slowly. His father regards him for a moment, and then draws Draco closer to his side, wrapping an arm around him in a gentle embrace. His mother joins in too, and the three of them stand together, wrapped around each other and basking in the warmth and relief of making it out alive.
His eyes remain firmly shut, and he looks oddly peaceful in his rest; every crease on his skin has smoothened out, and he looks… serene, as though he was smiling mere moments before death.
He turns back to his essay, because he really does need to complete it before tomorrow's lesson, and he cannot afford to get another detention.
They fly through the flames, and Draco is aware he’s screaming in his ear when Harry turns around, and dives for a piece of jewellery that falls through the air. The fire follows them, and scorching heat pricks against his back, claws of flames trying to drag them down to the devouring blaze.
Draco turns away from Granger and towards the goblin as he says something. Fear begins to course through his veins as he watches Bellatrix cast aside the goblin and pull up her sleeve. She touches the dark mark, and at once, the identical one on his arm writhes under his skin, shooting bolts of pain through him. He bites down on his tongue to prevent a cry from his lips and digs his nails into his forearm.
Harry, he needs to get to Harry.
“I love you,” Harry whispers back sleepily, and Draco breathes in his words, absorbing them into his bloodstream. Draco squeezes him tight against his body, trying to meld their bones together and become one.
Pansy and Blaise hover around him protectively, as though ready to catch him if he falls apart. They divert him away from Harry’s direction when they see him in the corridor, and take the long way to lessons. They snap and prohibit Harry’s name from arising in conversations in the common room, and amuse him with ridiculous gossip when they see Harry walk hand in hand with Ginny into the Great Hall.
Draco nods absentmindedly and continues to blankly stare out towards the lake, his eyes glossed over.
Despite the calamity and the disputes, amongst a war brewing with the threat of death looming over them, they had formed something rare and unique, and they had hidden it away in the empty crevices of their hearts, protected from the outside world.
he murmurs, holding him impossibly closer.
Draco wants to scream that it’s
Tinky. He could use Tinky, because they wouldn’t suspect her of anything.
Draco sees Harry stagger to his feet, and begins following Weasley and Granger. He stops, and turns back, glancing at Draco as though to make sure he’s alive and well. It warms Draco from the inside out. It shouldn’t, but it does.
Draco looks away, smiling bitterly. His chest aches terribly.
“After I–” Harry breathes in shakily. “After he killed me,” Harry says, and Draco feels his heart stop. The blood smeared across the bridge of his nose still remains along with the grime that clings to his skin, but the wound has been healed. Draco remembers Harry’s limp body held in Hagrid’s arms and he feels nauseous all over again.
“It’s a type of dark magic I’ve never seen before,” she informs him, shaking her head. “You’re lucky professor Snape got there in time, or else you would have bled to death,” Pomfrey says, her mouth set in a grim line.
Harry grips Dobby’s hand, and in the seconds before they disappear, Harry’s eyes lock onto his. Harry gazes at him from across the room with something incomprehensible but fervent, and Draco gazes back just as strongly, hoping desperately with every inch of his being that Harry will
She identifies Granger immediately, and Draco sees Granger’s fear reflected back at him as she glances past him. Weasley shuffles closer to her, trying to place her behind him so that he will take the force of a hit if she were to be attacked.
They lay in the dark, two hearts beating in sync.
Draco keeps his eyes on Harry, watching and waiting. He hears a cry, a final, drawn-out cry as the Dark Lord raises his wand, and Harry raises his own. With Draco’s wand held tightly in Harry’s hand, he aims and fires, and Draco feels his heart stutter inside his chest as red light meets green, sparks of light emitting from the collision of two spells.
Draco nods again. “Yes.”
The image of the man in front of him now does not resemble the man that had once sat Draco on his lap and read him books. The man that had spent endless hours teaching Draco to fly and a few hours more, healing his scraped hands and bloodied knees, pressing gentle kisses to his tear tracked cheeks.
It makes no sense. Surely she must be joking.
Draco feels relief and exhilaration flood through him, and choking back a cry, Draco pulls Harry forward towards him. He wraps his arms around Harry’s frame, one arm lacing around Harry’s waist and the other coming up to grip his shoulder. He holds him tightly against Draco’s body and Harry squeezes back just as tightly.
He leaves, and makes his way back to the drawing-room as nonchalantly as possible. Draco wishes he had stayed in that small, dark room, however, when he sees Granger sprawled on her back with Bellatrix standing over her.
She turns to leave.
He says something about no longer listening to Draco, something about his father, but Draco can’t focus on anything but Harry’s face. He refuses to let Harry be killed by a knobhead like Crabbe, not when the Dark Lord is still out there, waiting to attack.
Just as they’ve crossed onto the bridge, a voice calls out to him from behind.
Draco wonders what it is like to be free.
“You have to do it, Granger. Please,” Draco beseeches, and finally, she looks up. She must notice the sincerity in his eyes, because she gives him a small nod, despite the reluctance.
“I'm here now, and I'm not going anywhere,” Harry promises.
“Move out of the way Malfoy,” Harry spits, and Draco feels the fissures in his heart widen, his chest hollowing out.
He hears his mother and father conversing behind his turned back, and sees Greyback leering disgustingly at Granger. He pushes her forward, and Draco clenches his hands into fists to prevent himself from cursing the werewolf to pieces.
He opens his eyes blearily, and turns his head. The infirmary is awash with the weak rays of sunshine trickling in through the windows, and Draco registers faint muttering from Madam Pomfrey as she tends to another student.
“Your mum, she lied to him,” Harry continues, diverting the attention away from his death, and Draco tries to breathe air into his lungs. “She told him I was dead. She’s the only reason I’m even standing here now.”
He’s looking for a book for McGonagall’s transfiguration essay, when he hears hushed whispers. He pays it no mind at first, but the voice is too familiar to ignore.
Draco breaks his promise. Draco breaks his promise of never hurting Harry, because he breaks Harry’s nose.
Red light hits Granger squarely on her chest, and she screams in agony. Draco feels her pain rip through him harrowingly, and his body reacts to the memory of the torment as he watches her convulse on the ground. He feels bile rise to his throat, and he looks away as her cries echo off the walls in the room.
He doesn't know what happens next, only that a mass of people are running towards the castle, and the remaining crowd inside the hall are rushing out to meet them.
“Snape saw me, and made him close the door, so I don’t know what happened after,” Harry grumbles, and Draco’s heart kicks into overdrive. He
As the months trickle away, Draco begins to panic, because the cabinet still isn’t able to transport human beings. He diverts most of his attention to the sole task of repairing the cabinet, and begins to lag behind on his schoolwork. He’s forced to spend more time in detention with McGonagall than he does in her lessons.
He sees Longbottom carrying bodies into the Great Hall from the rubble gathered on the grounds outside. Draco looks away from the small body held in his arms and stares outside, the darkness blinks back at him.
Draco touches a small, pale pink scar, that had been healed by the dittany. The raised skin feels rough and calloused under his fingers. Draco bites his lip until he tastes blood on his tongue.
“Draco, you are no killer,” Dumbledore says, smiling kindly. Draco’s arm trembles where it holds his wand directed at the headmaster, and Draco knows he could easily overpower Draco if he wanted to.
Draco stays silent, not trusting his voice.
“Of course,” she says softly, and Draco regrets every instance he has ever treated her badly. Regret rises to his throat like bile, and threatens to choke him.
Draco knows it is him without a doubt, the second he is shoved into the drawing-room, with Weasley and Granger behind him. At the sight of them, captured and helpless within Draco’s own domain, Draco feels his stomach drop.
“I will!” Draco hisses at Weasley, the fear seeping out through his syllables. “I’m trying! But you have to stay quiet or else they’ll take you next. So shut up.”
Draco turns around, and watches in amazement as Harry runs towards him. His hair flutters with the wind and Draco feels his own heart fluttering inside his chest treacherously.
None of it matters now, Draco knows, because he has lost something irreplaceable and there will be a permanent Harry shaped hole in his heart.
Harry’s eyes find him, and Draco feels his heart crack and splinter inside his chest. Harry—his love, his life—is looking at Draco like he is a mere stranger, and he is, because Draco made sure of it. Gone is the warmth and the love that Harry had always directed at him, replaced instead with a cold indifference that leaves Draco’s insides freezing over with sorrow.
After landing his fifth detention in less than two weeks, Snape corners him in a dark corridor. He demands an explanation as to why Draco is slacking off and jeopardising his future, and Draco wants to laugh. Because he has already fucked up his future, ever since that wretched mark was placed on his arm.
He wouldn’t have to sneak around in the dark anymore, wouldn’t have to keep his lover hidden from his friends and family, from the world. He wouldn’t have to sacrifice anything to keep his relationship safe, because Ginny Weasely can give him everything that Draco could not.
One Friday afternoon, however, Harry stumbles into the library with girl Weasely wrapped around his side. He’s grinning, a red flush sitting high atop his cheekbones, and he laughs at something she says, gazing at her with bright eyes.
Harry’s hair hangs down to his shoulders, long and dark. Now that he looks closely, there’s a red bruise blooming on the side of his jaw and his lip is split, blood smeared across his chin. His face is ashen, and the dark circles under his eyes make him look haunted.
He walks to his mother’s side, and for the first time in months, Draco stands in front of Harry. He avoids Draco’s gaze, and Draco thinks that it's for the better, because he is not sure of what he would do if Harry looks at him directly in the eyes.
In an attempt to solidify his lie, Draco tells Snape he had been meaning to ask him for a Dreamless Sleeping Potion. Snape considers him a moment longer, and nods curtly.
“Because I loved you.”
Harry cannot die. Because if Harry is dead then there is no hope.
he says, instead of
Draco stands to the side, and wishes with every fibre of his being that his old house-elf will do something useful for once. Draco watches Granger; she lays limply across the wooden floorboards, and Draco watches her forefinger twitch with the remnants of the curse in her body. Her eyes begin to flutter shut, and Draco panics.
He wraps his arms around himself, as though trying to keep the broken pieces of his heart intact, and feels the pillow beneath his cheek dampen with tears.
Draco tries to say, but the words die in his throat and he whimpers weakly.
“You haven’t,” Harry replies into his neck. “You won’t.”
Finally, after what feels like hours, his parents come to his side. They’re holding hands, and leaning into each other as they walk towards him.
Blaise comes into the dormitory that afternoon with Pansy trailing in behind him, and Draco can do nothing else but wordlessly nod to all their questions. His lungs ache when he breathes in, and he doesn’t think he can talk through the lump in his throat.
“Severus… please…” Dumbledore whispers into the stunned silence.
and in that moment, Draco hates his last name more than anything in the world.
Draco closes his eyes and lets his exhaustion tug him to sleep.
“I’ve exhausted my supply of dittany, Mister Malfoy, but unfortunately, the lacerations were very severe,” she says regrettably. “You will have significant scarring.”
Crabbe says something, and the hostility in his voice fills Draco with unease. Draco watches with horror as Crabbe fires the Cruciatus Curse at Harry, and he screams, dragging Crabbe’s arm back.
Blaise finds them like this hours later, and he has three cold bottles of Butterbeer held in his hands. He settles down on Draco’s other side, and takes in Draco’s dishevelled state. Draco’s eyes are rimmed red, and the skin around them has swollen painfully. Blaise squeezes his thigh gently, and offers to finish his essay for him.
Hidden behind a towering stack of books, Draco sees Harry. Before he could even think, Crabbe and Goyle had stepped up and were holding their wands, pointed at Harry.
He struggles, thrashing against the torment, and his hands claw at the wooden floorboards until his nails break and splinter the skin around his fingers, raw and bloody.
Harry looks down at the ground uncomfortably, and Draco feels that familiar shadow of dread creep upon him.
“That was a very brave thing for you to do, my dear boy,” Dumbledore continues, and he smiles in sympathy. “You have placed his safety above your own happiness, despite the difficulty of your choice, and I must applaud you for that.”
“Goodnight,” Harry whispers into his ear. Draco kisses him one last time.
red eyes glare down at him.
“Oh,” he says, and his voice cracks, splintering in his throat.
He hides his face in her shoulder, because it’s mortifying to be in this state, but the tears will not stop. They choke their way through his throat until his chest is heaving for air.
Draco stands, watching Weasely pull Granger from the mess of crystals, and doesn’t see Harry leap towards him, until he’s in Draco’s space, trying to wrench the wands from Draco’s hands, and both of them go tumbling down to the ground in a heap of limbs.
“Please look after him,” he begs her, his voice cracking. “Keep him safe.”
“I don’t know,” Draco says, and steps back. The flames from the fireplace cast shadows across the hall, and the flickering orange glow of the fire paints Harry’s pale face with glimmers of gold.
Something behind Draco clatters, and he stiffens. He whirls around, and the light from his wand casts down upon his house-elf Tinky, cowering with her hands clutched at her ears.
“Darling, I’ve just heard…” She begins, but trails off uncertainly. Pansy looks up, her eyes catching Draco’s, and the pity swirling in her eyes makes Draco feel uneasy.
“Why?” Harry asks, and isn’t that the crux of the matter. Why did Draco sacrifice the only good thing he had left? Why did Draco risk his life to save the boy he loves?
for him. He stands rooted to the spot, watching Granger watch him.
He turns around, and Draco sees the sharp edge of his jawline. He looks better than he had last year; Draco watches the muscles on his back ripple as he talks animatedly with his hands, and sees the jumper he’s wearing fit snugly across his shoulders. He’s eating well, and that coupled with the Quidditch practice he’s immersed himself in this year, seems to be building his figure.
Then, they’re flying through the door, crashing into the wall and tumbling off the broom. Draco gulps in smokeless air, and coughs as it burns its way down into his lungs. He crumples onto the ground, leaning against the wall as he tries to calm his frantic pulse. Goyle lies a few feet away from him, still unconscious.
Draco thinks of Harry, and something inside him seizes up in pain. He knows now, that Harry will be happier. Because he wouldn’t have to hide anymore.
Harry seems to remember what he had come running for, because he stands up straight, shuffling his weight from one foot to another.
He stands up abruptly and his chair scrapes across the floor loudly. He grabs his stuff and begins shoving them into his bag. Blotches of ink stain his hands as he hurriedly shoves the cap on his ink bottle and his quill snaps in his haste.
“Your mother tells me you have not returned her letters,” Snaps says. “She is worried, Draco.”
“I thought– I thought I’d lost you,” Draco chokes out wetly.
Draco holds his gaze for one long moment, peering into those once familiar eyes, for a hint, a small crack in his stare that indicates, somewhere deep down under the erased memories, despite his attempts at harming Draco, that Harry still cares about him. That he still loves him.
Draco is standing on a fine line between two sides of a war, and neither side accepts him. Draco hopes, prays that the line will not give way under his feet.
“Where were you? I was looking everywhere,” Harry asks, like he’s conversing about the weather with a friend.
Weasley clears his throat awkwardly, but Granger, Granger, is looking straight at him through the gap between the shelves. She looks pained, as though she has been injured, and Draco belatedly realises she’s
Draco lowers his wand, ready to step into the light. He doesn't get a chance to take another step, however, because, in the next second, he’s being pushed aside like a rag doll, and Death Eaters are invading the landing, sneering and taunting both him and Dumbledore.
It’s tear droplets, he realises. His tears. He’s crying.
Draco descends the dark flight of stairs with tremors shuddering through his frame, and his hand trembles violently where it holds his wand directed in front of him. He utters a pathetic threat in a wobbling voice, and the door opens. Bathed under the feeble light from his wand, stands Weasley and Harry.
A great booming sound resounds across the grounds and into the hall, and the gentle murmur of conversations quietens. Some people walk outside hesitantly, searching for the source of the noise.
Draco wears the Dark Mark with faux delight in front of his father and the other Death Eaters, and they smile with glee and clap him on the back. His father squares his shoulders back with barely concealed pride, but his mother looks at him like the world has crashed down on her shoulders.
He thinks of the fondness from bright green eyes, directed at her, and Draco gasps softly.
“Were you the one that got us out? At Malfoy Manor?” Harry questions. Draco nods.
And then, Snape is standing in front of Dumbledore, his wand aimed directly at his chest. Draco watches in horror as a jet of green light fires from his wand and strikes the headmaster.
Through the raging flames, he sees someone soaring through the air, and the raven-haired figure is flying towards him. It’s Harry. Draco’s heart leaps and he feels a wave of relief wash through him.
He knows now, that this is the end.
“You have to do it,” Draco whispers, and his words fade away into the silent hallway. “You have to remove every trace of me.”
He lifts Draco’s hand up to his face, and keeping his eyes on Draco, Harry presses a gentle kiss on the back of his palm. He cradles Draco’s hand within his warm ones, cupping it like he’s holding a diamond.
Draco feels his heart clench painfully within his ribcage, and he feels nauseous.
Draco knows it’s only a matter of seconds before Harry notices, so he blindly grabs a random book off the shelf, and flees from the library.
Draco peeks through the gap in between the shelves, and sees jet black hair. Harry is turned away from him, but Granger and Weasley are sitting facing Draco’s direction. They look anxious, and Weasley keeps shifting in his chair.
Draco wonders if Harry had ever loved him at all, because the moment his memories of Draco and their relationship had been removed, Harry had gone back to being exceedingly hostile, just like he had been before they were together.
While Draco had deluded himself into thinking that Harry might one day come back for him, Draco has now been replaced. He’s been discarded to the side carelessly, and someone else has taken the place that Draco had once occupied.
He lays in bed the entire day, because when he tries to stand up, his bones ache and threaten to break under his weight.
The last thing he sees is dazzling green eyes and a bright smile, before the darkness swallows him whole.
Granger waits until he composes himself, and turns to leave. Panic seizes his heart in a cold grip and he calls out to her.
Harry’s breath fans across Draco’s face, and Draco’s grip on the wands slacken completely, until his hold is loose. They slip away from his hands as Harry easily takes them, and Harry looks down at him for a moment. Something in his expression must give Draco away, because Harry gazes at him with confusion and hesitancy clouding his features.
Draco hears his mother crying, and he struggles to keep his eyes open. He’s so tired, and all he wants to do is curl up and sleep. But his mother is crying, and he needs to tell her to stop crying, because the Dark Lord might hurt her too.
“Harry,” Granger starts hesitantly, turning her words over before she speaks. “I honestly don’t think Malfoy would do something like that,” she says. Weasley nods beside her.
Draco bites down on his tongue to prevent a cry from escaping past his lips, and surrenders to the hurt as his eyes well up with tears.
The fire has ceased, but the smell of blood and death still lingers in the air suffocatingly.
Draco finds himself falling in love all over again, and really, he’s never stood a chance.
“It won’t ruin him if he doesn’t remember me,” Draco says with finality. “I’m doing this to keep him safe,” Draco explains, because he needs her to know that he would never hurt Harry. He wouldn’t dream of it.
Something revives inside Draco like a bolt of lightning has struck down upon him, and he runs forward.
