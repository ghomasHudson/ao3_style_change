“Fine. But no insulting my family,” he added with a fierce glare, and Draco gave a long, suffering sigh. He had no idea this much negotiation would be involved in his Hogwarts days.
Back when Draco was eleven and spending his very first summer at Andromeda’s house, he noticed pretty early on that Ted and Andromeda almost always had a glass of wine with dinner. His parents had the same habit. Draco suspected it was a rich people thing that had stuck with Andromeda through her disownment.
“I need to talk to Severus,” he said and Harry frowned, grabbing his wrist a bit as he went to leave, “I’ll be back.” He told him and Harry let go a bit uncertaintly as Draco leaned down to grab his bag, "I'll tell you later - all of you," he added to the others before slipping out the door.
Quick favor if y'all want to help out. So, Draco's (well, Draco and Dumbledore's) plans should be like...90% clear by this point. There are some other things that will be cleared up next chapter (like why Draco can see thestrals), but if there is something that is still confusing you then it would be cool if you guys can mention it so I can double check that it IS something I address in the next chapter. Like I said, a lot of this is pre-written so I'm having a hard time remembering what my first draft entails. I'm gonna reread it tomorrow so if I had some notes on things to make sure are mentioned that would be cool - but no pressure. It's not your guys' job to keep me in check lol.
"Ginny and I a bit, but it wasn't serious or anything. Just a what-if type thing." He shrugged, "You?"
"Good morning to you too," Harry yawned and mused already very messy hair. "Are you going to stay like that today?" He asked and Draco shifted back as an answer. "Alright, well, Ron is making breakfast." He chuckled. Draco beamed - pushing aside any residual trepidation. Ron was an
"Right," he said slowly and held up a vial, "I can't explain everything to you. Just know that I made it so nobody can hear us or will come this way. I need you to drink this and tell me what happened the night you murdered Byron Jacobson." He started and Jenkins chuckled darkly, falling back on his poor excuse for a bed so that it squeaked loudly.
“Mum?” Harry asked sitting up quickly and then laying back down with a groan. “What kind of dragon that hit me, and why didn’t Caspian stop it.”
Harry had celebrated his birthday on the same day as Dudley’s, and both boys were given the exact same presents, three each, no arguments.
“You called?” Minxy asked as she popped into the room. Their time in Elphyne had altered the house-elves somewhat. Their intelligence and power were both boosted and their magic seemed to settle completely. All the Potter elves spend a lot of time in Faire because of this.
“Perhaps it would be best if you inform Miss Lovegood that we would very much like to speak to her after the feast. I shall send Axis to gather her father.”
“We shall see if we can turn even one of Draco’s parents. I do not hold out much hope for Lucius, but Narcissa has shown to love her son beyond all else.”
“Is there? I am sure there is nothing in the Department of Mysteries,” Lily said amused at the look she was getting from the old man.
“I do not know. I know the Fae keep hidden, they stay well away from humans, even magical ones. They believe that you all are tainted by your human blood,” Lily added with a chuckle. “Can you imagine all the blood purists finding out that they are believed tainted by muggles?”
“Seems I have much to learn to prepare my son for his future role,” Lily mused, “none of this was in the books my mother left me.”
“Mother had books that were passed on to me. I have kept them hidden and can only pray they were not discovered after my ‘death’.”
Darco’s laughter broke through Harry’s pain, as much as his mates hand on his, as magic danced between them. Harry sat up again, rather quickly but the pain had receded with Draco’s help.
“Welcome back to Hogwarts, for those of you that are returning, and welcome to all the first years. A lot of things will be changing this year, and I hope that all of you adapted well to them.
“Khidell can play with him later,” she said looking at the man and smiling at his bloodthirsty smile. “Now then,” Lily said, calming as soon as Snape was out of sight, the thought of what Khidell would do to him later, helping her gain that calm, “let’s have a little talk shall we.”
“They will have no choice,” Lily said with a small smile. “Get your things, meet us at Gringotts, I will bring Alice and Frank.”
“Change how?” he asked quietly, used to the soft voice that came to him in his mind. It had started two weeks ago when Uncle Vernon had actually tried to strike him but had somehow hit himself instead. He had stared at Harry strangely and then ordered him to his cupboard.
“Oh that’s right, I have to take guards with me,” Harry said, “how many is she making me take. She always goes overboard.”
Lily sneered at him as he fell to his knees, his face crumpled in horror and sorrow. Harry could feel his mother shaking as she looked at the man on his knees.
“Really,” Alice called out rather loudly causing the crowd to quieten down, “it seems witches and wizards really don’t have any manners. I think Siofra was right in her opinion of the lot of them, it must be the tainted blood.”
“Of course,” was all Lily said in response. They did not need to know the necklace held all the information she would need to protect her son, including who she could trust and who she could not.
“Let’s see,” he replied and poured the potion over the parchment. The potion swirled over the page, forming letters as it moved.
“First off, that is not possible, and second, who the hell are you and where is Slipknot?” Lily growled.
“Not since my time at school and occasionally during the first war. Lucius is a Death Eater. His son, however, is not.”
He looked out over the crowd trying to see if he could recognise Draco in the crowd of hooded participants and frowned when he noticed all identifying items had been removed from them, including the Malfoy Heir ring he was looking for.
“I do not mind,” Nyx said frowning at Siofra’s behaviour. “It would probably be best if Siofra stayed in Elphyne though,” he added.
she said as she watched him stretch before curling up and hugging his teddy bear, falling asleep almost instantly.
“I’ve come to take him with me, and raise him with Harry,” Lily said. “I plan on taking Alice and Frank too.”
“And the looks,” Dorea said, “you were always so much prettier than others, so compelling in your beauty. Then Harry was born and there had never been a more beautiful child. I had always wondered what happened to your sister, since well…”
After the feast, Caspian and Nyx led Harry and Neville to the family rooms, much to the boys' confusion.
“Well, no, but I thought you might be different. You always seemed to know that you wouldn’t find a match before each of the other gatherings,” Neville said.
“Are we still going to take the Hogwarts Express?” Neville asked. “I mean we will already be at Hogwarts, so what’s the point.”
The gates swung open, and Harry cheered as they walked through them, watching intently as they shut behind them with a loud clanging sound. Lily looked around as she paused inside the gates, the lawn was overgrown, so she could only imagine how bad the inside would look.
Harry got up at that moment and walked over to Sirius, clutching his toy in one hand and using the other to hold up to his Godfather. When Sirius pulled Harry up into his lap, Harry snuggled in and sigh softly. “Daddy’s gone,” he whispered as he burrowed into Sirius.
“It seems during the gathering, when your son and Harry bonded, Neville and Luna, reached out and touched them, causing a Sire bond to form. It is rare and we had no expectations of it happening. But it is a blessing by Danu herself, so it is to be celebrated.
“Indeed, the Fae are a thing of legend in the wizarding world and are equal parts feared and revered among our kind. It is said one Fae could wipe us all out if they so wished.”
When Neville finally entered their rooms, he was greeted with the sight of Harry pacing the room, muttering under his breath. Caspian refused to even look at him.
She had asked to see her account manager and been led to a goblin she didn’t know, and before she could inquire about anything he had sneered at her and told her about the Will.
“He has some messages for Sirius and Remus, just the usual, and told Draco he better take care of me, or else. He is also a fan of Caspian and glad I get to be with my mate and crush,” Harry said with a chuckle, “and he made me promise him plenty of grandchildren.”
“I will hex the first person that calls me that,” Harry huffed, slouching down in his seat. He couldn’t imagine how much harder this would have been on him if his mother hadn’t been so powerful, and rescued him.
She had pushed her magic and part of her very essence into her son when the Killing Curse had struck her, but she had no way of knowing if it would work until she touched his mind. She had been beyond ecstatic that she was able to bond to him this way and even more thrilled by the fact that in just a few short hours, she would be whole again.
“Yes, every day by the continued existence of your godfather. He is making me go, since he won’t see sense and stay here,” Siofra said with a lovely pout.
“Where have you two reprobates been? And where is Remus, he usually keeps the two of you in line?” Lily asked, ignoring the questions for now.
“The prophecy,” she gasped as she looked out over the children. Just under half of them were halflings.
Harry’s heart jumped in his chest in his excitement as he approached the portal. He could not wait to see his father’s world.
“Morgan was worried that we would destroy her magical legacy of witches and wizards she made in her image. Though she is unhappy about Myrddin getting all the credit and corrupting her creations, she was hoping that by reintroducing them to the Fae they would remember where they come from.”
“So I am full-blooded Fae now, as any human/wizarding blood is shed when we go through our second awakening. Harry, Harry is still a halfblood and will stay that way, until his final wizard awakening or magical inheritance as you call it, then he will start the purge, it will be complete by his 21st birthday.” Lily sighed heavily, “I was not strong enough yet to save them both. My second awakening happened on my birthday, but there was not enough time…”
“What about the others?” McGonagall asked. The more she learned about the Fae the more interesting they became. Nothing they had thought about the Fae was true.
It was a long-kept secret that if you said ‘get me’ and the name of the current manager, in this case, ‘Ragnock’, now,’ in Ghukliak, that the manager of the bank was summoned and everything was suspended until then. Lily and Harry remained unaffected, their kind was above the goblins and once they knew who they were dealing with… she grinned viciously.
“You just wish he would rub off on you,” Godric answered raising his eyebrows suggestively at Helga. He chuckled at the look on her face as he ducked the slap she aimed at him.
Lily figured it was because she was older now, even though she had not been technically living, she had been growing in strength. Or it could have been her complete fear of losing the ones she loved, she would never know.
“You can flirt with girls on the train Nev,” Harry said and smirked at the look he got from Neville in return. “At least these ones will flirt back.”
“Stop it, Neville,” Harry admonished his brother in all but blood, for what seemed like the millionth time. “The weekend is almost upon us, you seriously need to calm down.”
She smoked out, her body seeming to become vapour right before she disappeared from sight, and reappeared in the nursery of the Godric Hollow house. She sighed in relief that she had managed to achieve it. She had tried many times leading up to the attack and had even tried when Voldemort broke into the house, but she had failed spectacularly.
“I have no idea,” Lily answered, “but I’m sure he is aware of the guards being Fae, and of course he would have to be completely stupid to not understand that Harry will be Fae too, and we all know he is a lot of things but stupid isn’t one of them.”
“Yes, we have journals we use to speak to each other. She had them made because letters took too long,” Luna said, pulling out her journal. “We will not need it though, she will be here soon. Why do you need to contact her?”
“Yes,” Harry said, giving a small laugh at the relieved look on Neville’s face. “I should have never gotten so worked up about it, to begin with, you have been teasing me about Caspian since we were young. But with what is coming,” Harry added looking over at Draco, who was in deep conversation with Blaise Zabini.
“Yes, very,” Lily said distractedly. “There are no wards wizards know to keep us out.” She had heard a little cry coming from up the stairs. She pulled on Sirius’ hand and dragged him up the stairs quickly, just in time to see Neville being frightened by his Uncle Algie with his wand pointed at him.
“Sirius Black, you are a bad influence on my husband,” Alice said, trying but ultimately failing to keep in her laughter.
Caspian looked on as Harry and Draco’s magic intertwined, a small smile on his lips, pleased for his future King, even through his own sadness. He had never been able to find his own mate and had come to realise that maybe he never would.
“I am Lily Potter, Lady Potter of the Most Ancient and Most Noble House of Potter and I demand answers,” she said as magic whipped around her validating her claim, to the surprise of the goblins in the room.
“It seems that Harry, Neville, Draco and Luna are now full-blooded,” Ivy said, frowning down at her patients. “There is not a bit of wizard or human blood in them.”
“I have been informed that some of the properties were illegally rented out, but since I redid the wards with the goblins they would have been ejected now. Whoever did it will be getting a lot of annoyed visitors soon,” Lily added smiling brightly at the thought.
“Would you like to return to being Harry’s nanny elf?” she asked. Harry had already climbed off the couch and was pulling on Minky’s hand.
“I know,” Harry whispered, rolling his eyes. Trust his godfather to cause trouble wherever he went, Harry thought as he looked over to his mother. She was barely suppressing her own laughter before he saw her shake herself and prepare as they reached the Great Hall’s double doors.
Caspian and Nyx rushed forward to pick up Harry and Neville, calling for Siofra and Magus to pick up Draco and Luna.
“It’s your turn to get sorted, dumbass,” Harry whispered, causing Neville to finally pay attention and blush at the looks he was receiving.
“They have been spying on the Ministry, while others of the guard have been dealing with Death Eaters. Twenty-nine have been dealt with already, though many have begged for the privilege of joining us. And a guard was sent at the beginning of the week to watch Lucius Malfoy.”
“Minky,” Lily called, and the little nanny elf popped in, causing Harry to shriek in surprise and delight.
“Yes, he comes from the same bloodline as I do,” Lily said absently, she was still side-eyeing Siofra, much to the guards’ discomfort. Augusta chose that moment to arrive at Gringotts and Harry smiled at her, before turning to his mother.
Harry and Neville made their way down the steps and into the crowd, Caspian and Nyx close to their sides.
Harry moved forward and raised his hand, petting the bird, sorrow etched on his face, “he has chained the phoenix in dark magics. What is the bird's name, Godric?”
“Ready for another surprise?” Lily asked, and Harry nodded in excitement. “Daisy,” Lily called out and a pop was heard before the little elf appeared.
“You have traitors in your midst Khidell and they are not the only ones, just the only ones here,” Lily said. She replaced his sword and moved her hand to place her fingers to his forehead, “
“Tell us how you really feel,” Harry said with a small laugh at the disgruntled look Khidell sent him.
Lily adjusted Harry in her arms as she approached the gates of Potter Manor. They had been informed about James' parents two days after they went into hiding. Dragon Pox, Dumbledore had said, but after everything else going on she doubted that. She figured the old man had killed her and James, why not his parents. It seemed the old man just wanted her son.
“Welcome, all, Fae and halflings and the few magicals, to the Gathering. Each year we have a gathering, which is held for the purpose of our kind to try to find their mate. This is the first time we will be holding a second one in the same year.
“I knew that,” Harry said, “who do you think they came to for permission,” Harry added with a laugh. “We will have to go to Hogsmeade for that though.”
“There have been rumours for years that my mum survived that night. Dumbledore has been denying it, but what does that old man know? Mum has been working behind the scenes to thwart his every move. I can’t believe he tried to claim Hogwarts.”
“Yeah,” Harry said, leaning into her, both for his comfort and hers. “He is awesome. He told me how proud of me he was and how much he loved me. He also said how sorry he was he couldn’t be with me and you and to tell you he loves you now and always, and wants nothing more than your happiness.”
Lily waved her hand over Sirius and herself and smoked them through the wards into Longbottom Manor.
“Get some sleep,” Caspian said, frowning at the look on his Prince’s face, “it will be a long day tomorrow.”
“Excellent, make sure you set it up and put silencing charms around Neville's room, you know how badly he snores,” Harry added.
“We can give it a shot, I don’t think I have ever come across a halfling before,” he paused and looked at Lily, “and knew about it.”
“The Goblins were left in charge of the financial side of the school and the Guidelines of Hogwarts, the book on how to run Hogwarts was left behind for every Headmaster to follow.
“What?” Neville asked briefly looking at Harry before his attention was once again taken by the blonde girl at the Ravenclaw table.
“She didn’t seem to think so,” Luna said, “in fact, she seemed kind of sad that you didn’t name your Hedwig after her.”
“No, we are split into Seelie and Unseelie, since we knew we would all reunite when the King takes the throne. Though it will be a while before that happens,” Khidell added looking at their little prince.
Narcissa gave a subtle shake of her head and frowned before turning to look at her son. “He can not be trusted,” she stated, “my son has never been safe around him.”
“Yes,” Harry answered, screwing his nose up. He hated the pomp and circumstance of the whole thing. The scented bath, the robes, the ritual, and then the touching. He was hopeful he would only have to touch one person this time if he could manage to find and touch Draco first. He didn’t want to think about it happening any other way, but he knew the protocol by now and knew he would have to touch a lot of people.
“Your awakening gave me the push I needed to break through the veil and join with the part of me that was with you,” Lily replied, trying to keep it as simple as possible for her five-year-old.
“I heard mum had a little talk to Nyad, so there is that,” Harry added once he had finished laughing at Neville’s predicament.
“But Lily is Seelie, and Harry is both, why are the Unseelie here?” Sirius asked, but was ignored as Rugnuk asked a question.
“Yes well, you must be more careful in the future. If you forget, how are you to protect your King,” Meri whispered softly, before moving back to his spot to guard them.
“It will be funny to see his face when he sees you all without your glamors,” Siofra said, “and even funnier when you wipe his taint from the earth.”
“With all due respect, your Highness, I think it would be best to leave it between the two of them.”
“I see,” Harry said, smiling at Neville. “I have a question though,” he added, looking at Mivian and Aodh. “How were you unable to track Celeste?”
“Would someone like to explain what is going on?” Frank Longbottom said as he ran into the room, looking at his mother in shock.
Lily could feel her soul pushing through the veil, reaching out to the essence of her within her son's scar. Soon, my son, she thought as the clock struck midnight and Harry shuddered. Magic lit up the room, glowing green and golden, as Harry’s body lifted off the bed and a scream left his lips. She would have used her essence to smother the pain, but she was too busy being pulled from his mind as her essence and soul merged. Her body appeared in the room, whole and new, and when her soul entered it, her screams joined his.
“Daisy is not knowing what to do with this,” the elf said holding up the parchment in one hand and the cloak in her other.
The phoenix rubbed its beak in Godric’s hair and shuddered as if it was trying to burn. Harry frowned and placed both hands on either side of Ash’s head, studying the bird intently.
Lucius shut his mouth with an audible snap and could do nothing but watch as his wife was led to their son’s side.
“Yes and she had quite a few things to say, including some things about you Aunt Lily,” Neville said, smirking as he looked between Lily and Khidell, causing both of their eyebrows to raise in surprise.
“Something to get used to,” Neville teased as he moved over to Harry, smiling at his brother’s predicament.
A portal would be set up on the other side so the Fae could travel back and forwards with ease. Lily planned to have it erected inside the family quarters at Hogwarts once they had control over the castle.
They had been debating over breakfast whether it was a good idea for Lily to go with the group to take Harry and Neville to Platform 9 and ¾ but the write up had outed her as being alive, which made the whole discussion pointless.
“Rise Rugnuk,” Lily said quietly while Sirius distracted Harry. “We should keep the bowing to a minimum until he understands what's going on,” Lily added when the goblin stood up.
She took her time to soothe him before returning her attention to the Ragnock, completely unconcerned with his impatience. If he did not get to the bottom of this she would gladly take the whole bank down with her anger.
Lily Potter sat behind her desk frowning at the report Meri was giving her. She looked over at Alice and tried very hard not to smirk at the look on her face.
Lily smiled but said nothing, there was nothing to say. The Fae were a beautiful race, they were spellbinding in a lot of ways and used their beauty as much as they used their power.
Harry turned in her lap and wiped his eyes, before following his mummy’s finger. A beautiful smile broke out over his face as he watched the paintings wave at him, it grew bigger when they spoke.
“Interesting,” the hat said as it was placed on Neville’s head. “Hufflepuff’s heir. Very loyal, but only to those that deserve it, brave, yes, I see it here, cunning too, quite the snake you would make. Where should we put you…”
“Yes, the King's right hand shall be my fated, and we will ease the transition between Seelie and Unseelie for the King.”
“I…” Lily was caught short by the question, she had no idea why “maybe because I learnt Latin from a young age so it’s my go to. I mean, I don’t really know.”
His pleasure for his King turned to horror as Neville and Luna connected, their magic intertwining with Harry and Draco’s in a way he had never seen before.
“What do you think you are doing?” Lucius demanded as he was manhandled out of the room. “I am the King’s mate's father.”
“Stop it, mummy,” Harry said through his giggles. When she ceased he added, “the light told me stuff.”
“It’s okay, Daisy. It’s a long story, but part of it has to do with my history, do you remember doing research with me?”
“Never,” Lily said, holding him tightly. Charlus and Dorea watched on as Lily calmed their grandson, wishing they could hold him again themselves.
“Yes, I know exactly what I have destroyed. That wand was tainted beyond belief with dark magic. If you have been carrying that wand for a long time it is no wonder your mind is as twisted and dark as it is.”
“And your crush on Treva has nothing to do with that?” Harry asked with a smirk, adding, “you know she will not even look at you while you are still tainted. We have come a long way but still, their prejudice runs deep. Besides you need to get over that, she’s not your Fated. You tried at the last gathering if I recall.
“Sure it will, but that’s the point isn’t it,” Harry said laughing at the look on Neville’s face as his mum pushed him down the corridor.
“She talked to us about the history of the Fae, warned us to watch out for hidden dangers, and told us that we were doing well with opening up the Fae’s minds to the magicals. She said they are not tainted by blood but by knowledge. Ignorance is their curse and must be corrected.”
“I know pup, I know,” Sirius answered as he held on tightly, resting his nose in Harry’s hair and inhaling his scent. He would do better, he promised himself.
“Not that we can tell,” Ivy said as she moved over to place a hand on Narcissa’s arm. “They have had a significant power boost and finished their second awakening as you know. But other than that, all we can tell, until they wake up, is that they are healthy and stable.”
Harry held onto his mother and watched as Neville did the same, with his. They were shadowed out of the Great Hall and straight onto Platform 9 and ¾ much to the shock of the witches and wizards already gathered there.
Lily could see the questions in her son’s eyes, “I will tell you everything once we are safe, okay?”
“He said the same thing, but he also pointed out that you will live a very long time, potentially forever, so you should stop sulking and get on with things.”
“Pardon,” Gussy said getting to her feet and looking down at Lily, she could not believe the nerve of the woman before her.
“Maybe we should just leave the door open, then all the people that are walking past trying to peak in will stop,” Neville said rolling his eyes.
Lily stood with Neville on her hip and took hold of Sirius and smoked out to the shock of Augusta. She arrived back at the bank and left Sirius with Neville and Harry while she headed over to St Mungos to collect Alice and Frank. It would be chaos when they realised these two were gone, but she could hardly care.
“And when we do we don’t get caught,” Neville whispered to Harry, causing his dad to glare at him. “Sorry, sorry,” he added, not even the least bit sorry.
“Ivy seems to think it would do her good. Maybe after seeing so many halflings there are in Hogwarts will do her some good.
“Abscondunt scientiam protegam hanc revelationem,” Lily said as she threw her hands out, encompassing the whole room and everyone in it.
“Yes well, are you ready boys, it’s time to go,” Alice said changing the subject. She happened to agree with Harry but there was no telling Frank. He was just as stubborn and headstrong as his mother so Augusta had no one to blame but herself.
He heard the shocked gasp from his mother, but his eyes were on his gran, watching as her eyes fluttered open. She looked so different.
“Of course my King, but really you know you won't be touching anyone, you need to wait for gatherings for that,” Neville said rolling his eyes again, something that happened often when he was around Harry, and bowing while shooting him the bird.
“You know you can’t give me back,” Sirius said as he entered the room, wrapping his arms around his lover.
“When do you think they will wake?” Narcissa asked as she ran her hand over Draco’s now long hair. It almost shimmed, as it fell through her fingers. Her son had always been handsome, but now, he seemed to glow.
“Lily Potter? Is she, look at the ears,” they all heard, causing their guard to spread out and block the view of the gawkers.
“How did the rest of the gathering go?” Harry asked as he sat down on the sofa, next to Draco, in the family room, and smiled when Caspian sat on his other side.
“Yes but I much prefer English for speaking,” she translated for the others in the room. “As to your question, yes, Hogwarts was built by Fae, well by two Fae. Godric Gryffindor and Helga Hufflepuff are both Fae.”
“That will be purged soon enough,” Siofra muttered looking up at her leader defiantly, before bowing her head again.
“Depending on the severity of the offence, you will receive anything from point loss and detention to suspension and expulsion. A few of you, having gone over the records, are on your last chance.
“Me too Daisy, me too,” Lily said as they finally made it to the front door. It opened as they approached and Lily put a now wide awake Harry down, took his hand and walked into the Manor together, both smiling widely.
“You still need me,” Dumbledore protested when it registered what they had said before, about him being forced out of the castle.
They nodded to him, bowed to Harry and Lily and smoked out. Khidell moved over to Lily and held his hands out, “may I?”
Harry sat on the couch in the common room he and Neville shared, patting his snowy owl. It had taken almost all weekend for Lily, Godric and Helga to talk to the staff and fix as many problems as they could.
“Yes, Jinxy do,” the little elf said and then a few pops were heard through the house and things started to disappear. “We place things in Potter Vaults for Lady Lily to sort through later,” she added and started in the bedroom Lily was standing in.
Before anyone could move she had pulled Khidell’s sword from his side with one hand, spun around and sliced the heads off of two of the guards, with barely a jostle to Harry tucked into her side.
“Godric Hollow,” Lily said, “I have yet to have an opportunity to go there and see the damage, but I will have to go soon and hope my enchantments held. If Dumbledore got ahold of those books, there is no telling what he would do with that knowledge.”
“Ah,” Lily said as she looked at the man standing there in stunned shock. “The man that revealed the Prophecy to Voldemort and condemned my family to death.”
“What is not well known,” Lily continued, “is that Helga and Godric are both Fae, and retired to Elphyne after the death of Rowena, and left their legacy, Hogwarts, to be run under the rules they had set and left behind.
Lily Potter grew in strength as her essence rested inside her son’s mind. It was just an echo of the woman she was as a whole, a sliver of her soul, but the essence was of one mind, protect Harry at all cost. It was the single-minded devotion to him and an overwhelming need for him to live, be protected and prosper that she had been feeling at the time of her death and that was the part that clung to her son’s magic and mind.
“Okay, get some rest, we have a busy day tomorrow,” Lily said rising from her desk, Khidell every present at her side.
“Sirius, bind him,” Lily said, and watch as Sirius did as she asked. “Poppy?” She called Alice’s elf.
“Is that Harry Potter?” Harry heard from several people in the crowd and tried to hide behind Neville.
The owls head popped up and she hooted in delight and flew over to land on Caspian’s shoulder, running her beak through his long hair after she settled.
Lily frowned at Caspian before looking out over the children in the Great Hall, her vision flickering as she did so. “Oh my,” Lily said.
Harry looked around the room and noticed that the other staff members had moved away from Dumbledore and were frowning at him.
“Lily, is that you?” Minerva asked as she moved towards the group. She stopped halfway towards them and turned back to Dumbledore. “You told me she was dead!”
“Yes and no,” Lily answered with a smirk. “I’m going to make us invisible and silent so we can look around before we let Augusta know we are here.”
“And when does the old fool plan to lead the Aurors and Ministry to its death?” Lily asked, concerned about their timing affecting the gathering.
“Has mum given in to his charms yet?” Harry asked. Khidell had fallen hard for his mother but she had not looked at another since the death of his father, James. Harry had even spoken to her about moving on, but she had been adamant that she needed to mourn for her lost husband. He wondered if it had more to do with him than his father’s memory.
“That stop’s now,” Lily said her voice demanding as her eyes glowed. “It is inexcusable, the amount of abuse the students have suffered in a place they are supposed to be safe. One of the new rules put into place is the consequences for bullying other students.
“He was a bad influence on mine too,” Lily said, smiling in remembrance. It was getting easier to remember James and talk about him with a smile.
“On a lighter note, we are going to Diagon Alley soon, and then we will be going home for the gathering.”
“James,” she whispered as she rested against the door frame, closing her eyes in sorrow. It felt like a part of her was missing, and the ache felt like it would never heal.
“She will probably get her own way eventually,” Harry said, “and I for one would put odds on her surviving it and kicking Frank’s arse when she does.”
“Yes, it seems he has proven himself to Danu herself that he would die before he would betray his King. That is the only way the bond is possible.”
They could all hear the anger in the woman’s voice, and as much as it amused Lily to see one of her favourite teachers go after the old man, her eyes trained straight onto Severus Snape.
“Can you take our luggage to Hogwarts and place it in the Gryffindor suite,” Harry asked smiling at his nanny elf.
“I want to walk to halls my dad walked, I want to sit in the seats he sat in, I guess I just want to feel closer to that part of me,” Harry said with a sad smile.
“Take a seat, that’s already dealt with. Ronald Weasley is sleeping it off in the baggage carriage,” Caspian said with a smirk.
Either way, Harry was (not surprisingly) being a little irked by so many adults acting as overbearing body guards. Draco wondered how long he could deal with everyone babying him before he cracked.
“Everything Hermione had on hold. I thought it was good to pick up where she left off.” He said and nodded to the other pile, “Those are all… um, muggle books.” He muttered and shook his head, “I thought reading them might help me understand more about muggles, but I’m just more confused.” He admitted, running a hand through his hair. “Why… why do they eat people’s organs? I don’t…” He trailed off. Harry blinked a few times.
“I have no idea what you’re talking about. I thought Dora liked snakes,” he said with a shrug, “If she doesn’t then that’s news to me.” He told her. Harriet popped again, turning a bright pink color at Nymphadora's name. “See? Harriet loves her!” Draco added with a laugh. Andromeda rolled her eyes.
happening? Harry only shook his head in return. Had this poor man been forced to play third-wheel like this the entire time Draco was gone?
"I think the snake is one too. I've been having dreams..." Harry trailed off, possibly under the weight of Severus' look at him. Draco frowned. Why was he looking at him like that? "So, we're close. There are just two." He said. Severus didn't respond at first.
“Oh - don’t… we’re in public,” Draco sighed as Harry went about keeping his head pressed to the wall as he continued walking away from them. “I guess we’re doing this now,” he said before marching after him with a scowl. Ron and Hermione dashed after him.
He asked, momentarily stunned by the revelation. He felt as thought he had just learned Tonks was pregnant. He supposed he had seen how far along she was only a few days ago, but... wow. Remus grinned - eyes flicking Sirius over a second before giving a nod. "I - congrats, Remus. That's great!" He said. Sirius also gave a smile though it wasn't the one Harry was used to seeing on him. It seemed more... cautious somehow.
It felt impossible to pick one thing. Normally, whenever he tried his patronus floundered - never quite forming due to the confusion.
“So,” Draco was explaining, “It turns out there is a whole debate on what to call them. We call them muggles, obviously, but turns out the base of the word ‘mug’ means ‘to fool’ so others think it isn’t a very nice term. However, in America they call them no-maj, which is… well, it means no magic, which you wouldn’t think is all that bad, but the history there is a bit complicated.” He admitted. Theo smiled as he took a sip of his drink, watching with bemused eyes.
"Cassi?" He asked and she smiled, "I... you're... older." He said, gesturing her up and down. She had been nine when she died. Now she looked like she was maybe around Dora or Fleur's age.
It was… nice. Neville trusted him. Blaise and Pansy accepted him (admittedly, because he was saving their asses… but still). Tristam, Sadie, and Zoe stayed loyal as ever. It was a nice feeling, actually.
"He hasn't said anything!" Harry snapped. Draco flinched again. Fleur didn't say anything, but the look she pinned him with had the silent I-told-you-so written all over it. Harry looked away. Ron put a hand on his arm, squeezing tightly before gently pulling at him. After a few tries in which Harry stubbornly stayed in place he relented, shrugging Ron off as he marched from the room.
Harry grumbled, "But she took it the same way you just did. It was really awkward when she basically said she wasn't into it."
A few more hours passed. Harry didn't bother to go into the tent though. He stayed outside - rising a hand up to outline a familiar cluster of stars. After a moment, he swallowed back his regret, collapsing on the ground beneath him. What was he supposed to do? Harry should have thought of a way to locate Draco for situations like this. Maybe he should have come up with their own ways to keep in contact outside Ron's watch. Groaning, he gripped his hair in frustration.
“You know,” he mused as Draco let out a scream of frustration. He went to grab for his wand again - at least hoping to defend him and Ginny from the mystical tyrant - only to feel around at the wet floor to no prevail. “You… are an interesting case, aren’t you? Pureblood. Powerful according to Ginny, but that’s no surprise. Most well-bred wizards are.” He mused and Draco’s fingers twitched. “Most importantly, you’re young. Maybe with Potter out of the way I could make something of you.” He said.
“Well,” Slughorn said as he sat down, “I am so pleased to be able to meet some of Hogwart’s finest! I’ve heard so much about you all.” He said, flicking his wand to pour them all some tea. Draco froze. The room seemed to chill for a moment as he watched the teapot move around the compartment -
"Can I see the watch?" He asked Ron. Wordlessly, he tossed it to him. Harry gave a nod of thanks before slipping inside the tent as well. Draco was lying on the bed - staring at the ceiling. Harry cleared his throat. "Can I come closer?" He asked. Draco glanced over at him and shrugged. It was more than he usually got so Harry considered it a win as he made sure to stay in his line of sight, kneeling next to the cot he was in. "Hold yours." He instructed, tapping the watch. Draco looked at him and then slowly grabbed at the end of the chain around his neck.
“Of course,” Alecto chuckled, “We’re very interested in providing education to our youth. Severus will be headmaster, of course, but we’ll take over some of the classes.” She told him. Draco smiled. Good.
mess up your face.” He said and Hermione scowled at him, “You’re going to look like a disaster in the photos. Stop it.”
"Or maybe I could pitch myself off the Astronomy Tower." Draco answered as he tied the front of his quidditch robes in place.
“Hey, Hermione. Do you happen to smell butterscotch? I remember Viktor Krum ate a lot of those.” He said. Ron’s smugness dropped immediately as Hermione spluttered.
Severus Snape might be many things... but a fool was not one of them. Draco knew this. It was why he decided he would be upfront the second he called Draco out on his bullshit.
being punished for it? The thought made him angry as he began to wander aimlessly throughout the castle.
"Don't say a word," Hermione breathed to him. Harry grimaced. There were a thousand things he wanted to say. He wanted to tell the snatchers that they somehow smelled worse than them. That those Death Eater masks looked pathetic. That Bellatrix had major muggle
“Oh, wow,” he said sarcastically, “How exciting. I can’t wait to tell my parents I have somehow lowered myself even more. Perhaps I can finally reach Hell soon.” He added under his breath. Mrs. Weasley leaned forward to whisper in his ear.
“To be clear,” Ron (unhelpfully) jumped in, “Not only does this lot think a dead guy is going to pop out of a lake, but they also pretend to be in ye olden times as to not alarm the chap if he does come about.” Ron mocked. Draco kicked him under the table.
In a very similar way, Harry was the real thing. He was the real thing in the sense that Draco was pretty sure he could kiss a hundred more people and nothing would ever feel as real or genuine or passionate. And - much like what he found with the wine - his tolerance was much lower than he originally thought. Whatever he thought he could stand of Harry had lowered drastically.
“I have to get to class,” he said and looked at where Harry was getting closer. “Are you sure you’re okay?” He asked. Draco gave him a weak smile before nodding his head. “If you say so.” He sighed and picked up his bag. “I’ll punch Smith again for you.” He added.
The rest of the evening went by in what felt like minutes. He danced with Fleur... then Hermione... then Ginny challenged Fred and George to a dance-off, which McGonagall ended up judging. Molly gave a very sweet speech and Harry gave a very awkward speech. Draco's time to shine had also finally come.
“If you want to, sure. Just remember that you panic when he panics,” Lily said and entered the room to throw a bag on the floor before disappearing again. Sirius scowled.
"Hey, there. How's motherhood treating you?" He asked and then frowned, "Also, what the Hell are you doing here? What the Hell are
Then again, what the Hell did Dumbledore know about what was best for Harry? He left him with the Dursleys and hired a bloody Death Eater last year.
Look, it just felt as though he had been replaced somehow. As if Cho filled a role that Draco hadn't even been aware he had. It was confusing and quite frankly… Draco didn't care for it.
"Well," Draco said solemnly, "I did go out with a bang. Told the Dark Lord to go fuck himself and all that." He mused. Remus and Dora laughed. "Oh... um, that one wasn't a joke." He rectified. The humor fell away from Remus' face instantly.
“Harry goes on grand adventures. I just keep him alive.” He said with a small smirk. Harry made a face in return as Slughorn gave a loud laugh of approval, “In truth, it is mainly Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley who keep us both on our toes.” He added.
“I can explain,” he greeted and Draco paused in putting some of his books away to give him a cool look, “Oh, come on. I wasn’t actually going to go,” he said. Draco pretended not to care… because, you know. He didn’t. Theo stepped out in front of him.
see the risk with Harry knowing that Voldemort could see into his mind. Maybe it was safer if he didn't know... right?
“Um, no,” Ron told him bluntly. Harry scowled before heading towards the wall and pressing his ear up against it.
And that was how he found himself standing in the nest of quite possibly the largest spiders he had ever seen. Ron was clinging to him, whimpering helplessly with his absolutely
"You said you have personal experience," Harry asked him curiously, "What happened?" He asked. As open as Sirius was about... well, most things in the world, Harry realized that he didn't really know much about some of the more personal details of Sirius' life. Most relationships mentioned were just briefly labeled as some person he may have dated or hung out with no names attached. Hell, Harry didn't even know Sirius
Draco wondered when Dumbledore might reach out again. He sighed, running his hand over the side of his neck. Harry was already taking lessons with him… wasn’t the man busy enough? He supposed it was only a matter of time before the headmaster asked about his summer.
“And why don’t muggles think ghosts are real? Can they not turn into ghosts when they die? My father said it was because muggles don’t have souls, but that has to be wrong, right? It’s wrong. Tell me it’s wrong.” He said and Harry swallowed before getting up to grab his arms.
She asked, eyes going dangerously bright. Draco resisted the urge to chuckle. He remembered all too well Harry telling him how McGonagall reacted when Umbridge said he couldn't be an auror. Professor I'll-Make-You-An-Auror-If-It-Is-The-Last-Thing-I-Ever-Do did not like anyone telling her students they had limitations - not even the students themselves.
“They don’t know, do they?” Theo asked. Draco froze. “Merlin, Draco. I like your friends. They’re good people. Why are you leaving them-?”
“What are you talking about?” Tristam asked, shaking his head, “Of course we’re going to do it.” He said. Draco paused. Really? Just like that? “I mean, you’ll have to show us how to make polyjuice potion correctly… and we’ll need to figure out how exactly we’re going to get the hair, but those are minor details, right?” He asked. Sadie shrugged from beside him.
“Yeah… that’s way too much for someone new to this. Keep it to once a week and work your way up,” he said and looked Draco over, "Have you stopped feeling sick? I don't know what foods are bad for foxes, but as long as you keep the chocolate and stuff to minimum before shifting you should be okay." He added. Draco nodded. Sirius' previous instructions covered the basics well enough. No food that would upset his feeble fox stomach an hour before transforming. It was a taxing task given his love for peppermint patties, “Look, I’m sorry. I went too far.” He told him and then swallowed, “And in all honesty… I get it. I wish I could have helped Regulus.” He told him, gesturing to the room around them. Draco frowned.
“Given recent events concerning the tournament and a rather appalling lack of ethical journalism,” she said with her voice clipped and stern, “And also because I don’t believe there will be high attendance today… I will cancel my morning classes this
Huh. He wasn’t entirely sure what he meant by that, but Draco got the feeling that perhaps Longbottom wasn’t so much of a lost cause after all.
"You're going to hold that over me forever, aren't you?" He asked. Draco nodded. Until the day he died, definitely, "Whatever. None of that matters now. I just want to know how far we should go. Like... what's okay?" He asked slowly. Draco narrowed his eyes.
"I know you're angry. You should be, but we have a bigger problem," he said. Harry's blood went cold, "Draco sent me something right after I left. I tried to get to you both as soon as I could, but you had already gone. I just wanted to check on him and... we need to find him. Fast." He said. Harry felt his breath leave him for a moment.
She did relent and say that since he was getting involved in a war, he should be allowed to have a real glass (he watched her pour himself to be sure). When he finally had his first taste of the real thing…the difference was abysmally obvious. As it turned out, the real thing was so much better than anything he had tried previously and he knew that he would never go back to the child-version his aunt had tricked him with for years.
“I’ll take that,” Draco snorted and let go of Harry to flick Fawkes off. The bird squawked indignantly. “Tell your owner that I hate him.”
“I don’t remember it being too interesting,” he said. Dumbledore hummed before reaching over to move a black pawn forward.
“I promised I would bring him back. I’m sorry.” He said, voice breaking again. Draco clenched his jaw. He didn’t like this. He didn’t like this at all. Trying to keep calm for Harry’s sake, he pressed down harder on his hand.
“Well, you’re an obvious choice to train for a spy,” Neville shrugged, “With You-Know-Who back, I mean. Between your family and your friends… plus, you’re smart.” He added with a shrug. Draco laughed.
- he and Grindelwald definitely dated) while Ron seemed to just like him because he didn't give out punishments and helped them win the House Cup a lot.
you are not on best terms with Potter.” She added when Draco opened his mouth, “So I expect you to mend things. Then I expect you to find a way to
"Draco," she said seriously, "I know him very well. I thought it was weird he would teach in general, but... there is something wrong with him. I'm going to the ministry to get back-up, okay? Just make sure nobody goes anywhere alone with him." She said. Draco frowned. What? "I'm serious," she said when he opened his mouth.
"A pensieve. You made Draco a scrapbook." He added with a shrug. Andromeda slowly lowered her weapons. It had been awhile since he'd seen her. She looked pretty good for being in the middle of a war. Maybe it had something to do with being a grandmother. Speaking of which-
“I mean, Dumbledore has never been a favorite of mine. Fuck him, for all I care. You’re the boss, Draco.” Sadie said and brought out her wand, “Just tell us how to get this show started.”
“Trust me,” Draco told him quietly, “I am both of those things. Just not for the reasons you think.”
aren't the one allowed to have a mental breakdown," he told him. Draco snorted, "And... yes. Yes, you are a kid. Seventeen is a kid. Sorry." He said and patted his knee. There was a pause in which he patted the fabric, "Huh. That's a nice dress."
“Oh, she’s beautiful!” He said and held out his finger. Harriet nudged him slightly before giving what Draco could only describe as an open mouthed smile. “Harriet?” He asked with a tilt of his head. Draco nodded solemnly.
“Try this.” Fleur said, suddenly appearing to put a pink bottle in Draco’s hand, “It will help you stay young.” She explained when Draco opened his mouth, shook her head, “You are very pale. It means you will age fast. Drink.” She said and disappeared again. Draco frowned. Whatever. He took a sip.
, Montague,” Ron snapped back and pulled out his own wand, “Or maybe I’ll fill your mouth with mud.”
“....can I tell you something?” Ron asked after a couple minutes of silence. Draco hummed, flicking a page of his book as Harriet stole some eggs from the center of the table. “I know what the first task is.”
"Honestly, I would be more concerned with Fleur," he said and when Draco frowned, raised his hands, "I mean, she
“He does,” Harry agreed, “Come on. We need to get him to Hagrid,” he added as if there wasn’t a perfectly good hospital wing inside the school. Whatever. Don’t mind him.
him? What the Hell did you think that would do, Harry? His wand would fly out of his hand and then what? His Death Eaters were right there! You couldn’t have at least tried to stun him?!” He asked and hit him again. “I know you’re good under pressure! What the Hell?!” He repeated. Harry gave a grumbled response.
“Besides, his family has no idea I’m in his life at all.” He mumbled and Hermione reached over to pat his arm. Draco’s pout furthered. “I just… don’t get why,” he finally admitted, “I only… I mean,” he took a long breath. “Theo has pretty much gone against every other norm for his bloodline. I don’t quite understand why he’s following
as in it seemed like a stupid thing to talk about or try while you were missing! I didn't mean I wanted you to
was a car? He had heard of cars, of course. It was a weird sort of muggle machine that he knew wizards were fascinated with. His parents never consorted with such objects though so he had never seen one in person. It looked like an oddly shaped box with wheels and - “Draco,
"Yeah, of course," He said. It was hard to try and keep a low voice with the crowd all eagerly buzzing around them, but he managed. Draco frowned, following his eyes out towards the towering maze in front of them. Draco wondered idly if Harry could just summon his broom again and fly to the center. It was probably against the rules... worth a shot though. From in front of them, Cho Chang was laughing with another one of her friends as they waved a flag with Cedric's name. "Poor Harry," Theo added with a frown at the pair, "I hope he doesn't win only to walk out and see that."
“I’m not quite sure what to do,” he admitted. He really didn’t. Normally his friends rarely required
There was a pause as the boy shakily unpinned the anti-Potter badge and threw it to the ground before scrambling away. Sighing, Draco knelt down to look at it.
idea. What was this? "We did talk about when," he said and shook his head, "In hindsight, I was an idiot." He said, "I told her I didn't really want to try anything without you."
For a worrying moment, he wasn’t sure it worked. He was still there. Then he raised his hand and the other Draco did too. He smiled. It was just a mirror. Lupin walked over to look it over with unconcealed curiosity.
“Mr. Malfoy,” He greeted brightly, “I believe Miss. Granger is waiting for you presently. Don’t keep her waiting-”
us,” he said, turning to face him, “Look, I know I haven’t been… supportive, but if you’re going to do this then just let us help. So we know what’s going on-”
“Ooh, touchy.” Draco said and shoved him, “Get on your broom, you tosser. I’m getting you a new one for Christmas by the way.” He added thoughtfully. Ron seemed to brighten at that. He was actually riding the one Molly had gotten him after being made a prefect. It still could be upgraded though in Draco’s humble opinion.
"You're right," he said and slumped into his chair, "That... wasn't necessary - or fair," he added and closed his eyes, pinching the bridge of his nose, "I want to keep being angry with him about Winston..." he began and trailed off, shaking his head, "But I know it wasn't all on him. If Winston had just played along..." Theo said and then pursed his lips, "You know, it would be easier if he was bad at this." He said with a nod towards Draco.
"It worked," he announced and moved over as Hermione made her way over. She looked at the locket then to the bag of fangs. She stood frozen for a second before slowly looking at Snape. He stared back at her with an unreadable expression. Harry was about to ask if she was okay when she launched herself at the other man. Snape practically scrambled to get away - looking deeply uncomfortable with the fact he had just been thrown into a hug. Luckily for him, it didn't last long since Hermione let go seconds later to hug Harry next.
“It was good,” Draco answered slowly and then smiled a bit to himself as he watched Neville set up his ingredients exactly the way Draco had taught them all in their first year. He had forgotten his spiteful attempts to get Severus’ attention. It was actually a little endearing that Neville still abided by eleven-year-old Draco’s rule of organizing ingredients. “How was yours?” He asked, genuinely curious. He wondered what a Longbottom Christmas might look like.
“Wait, what?” Draco asked when he woke up to find a pile of packages the next morning. Ron was already ripping through his own gifts - urging a star struck Harry to do the same. “Who… why?” He asked with a frown, brows creasing slightly. Ron glanced up.
The world seemed oddly still. Cold. As if someone had put everything but this moment on pause. Draco had been scared plenty of times in his life. Fear was nothing new to him, but right now he was pretty sure he was past scared and more towards downright terrified.
“I don’t think so,” He shrugged “But we all know Harry. If he didn’t have Ron who would do the stupid stuff with him? They were friends first.” He snorted and Hermione smiled a little at that.
Draco stared. He felt as though a frog was getting caught in his throat as students around him took a seat.
Right… the turban wasn’t hiding any hair. In fact, Quirrell appeared to be completely bald as the cloth fell away. Harry’s eyes widened - unrestrained terror washing over his face as he stepped back.
“What is that?” He asked, voice rising when he finally got a good look at Draco’s eye. “He did that? Are you kidding me?” He asked and Draco groaned.
“Do you want to talk to him?” He asked when Roger Davies came by during dinner. Fleur gave a small wince, which was all Draco needed to turn back around and scowl. “Go away. She didn’t come here with you.”
"Do not speak of what you do not know." Dumbledore said sharply. Draco scoffed. There it was. The infamous Albus Dumbledore's weak spot. Everyone had one. Draco had wondered for years what his would be.
“Okay,” Draco agreed… except he needed that knife back. The other two sat in his pockets, but Bellatrix still held onto the one he had given her, eyes wild as she alternated between shooting spells and slashing with it. Sirius was rushing over, wand out to disarm her. Harry’s eyes widened.
“We’ll need to get you caught up on dark arts,” he said instead, ignoring the question altogether. “Anything that the Dark Lord might ask you to do to prove yourself. Also, unforgivable curses.” He added. Draco nodded. “Though, first…” He said and lowered his wand to stand in front of him. “We need to discuss who you will practice all of this on.”
“I knew you were useless. Didn’t I say he was useless?” He continued, pushing the thought away to look at Ron who nodded. “Okay, so in that case we can use him as bait-”
“Ron has earned that,” He finally said and Draco gave a small smile before nodding. “You and I cause too much trouble.” He added as an afterthought. Draco bit back a grin. That was probably true… Draco might be an unwilling participant in some of those adventures, but he had always been there to ensure it was a spectacular mess.
“Shut up. It’s not just a pureblood holiday. Purebloods just know lots about it because it is part of what is passed down every generation… as anyone with
“Graham Montague,” Pansy scowled, leaning back in her chair, “You are beginning to sound like our resident bloodtraitor,” she grumbled, pressing a finger to her temple, “I -
try to turn. It hardly counts as putting my life on the line," Draco said, shaking his head, "We've done way more dangerous stuff in the past. The only reason you would even care is because I'm trying to use it to find a way to help my parents. Otherwise you would be lining up right behind me to do it!" He argued. The room's temperature rose slightly, almost as if wanting to flush them out. Both Harry and Draco stood their ground.
There would be a time in Draco's life where he would be asked, in front of hundreds of people, what some of the worst experiences of his life were.
“For a daring nerve that could have been possessed by Godric Gryffindor himself I award Gryffindor… another forty-five points.”
Sighing, he reached into his pocket (with his non-Harry-occupied hand) and managed to tug out the worn piece of parchment that had been burning a hole in his pocket all day. Nobody had really pressured him to open it, but he knew the others were anxious about what its contents held as well. Draco just wanted some privacy knowing that... well. The words might not bring good news. Plus, he couldn't be sure who it was even from.
“Good guess,” he told him and leaned forward slightly. “Want to start now?” He asked. There was nothing else to do. Harry seemed to think similarly because he gave a nonchalant shrug. “Okay. Close your eyes. Try not to think or feel anything-”
“Oh, yeah, sure. That’s why he showed up to your muggle house,” Draco said and rolled his eyes. Idiot. Harry sneered back. “Let me try… Dobby?” He called and waited. Nothing. “Dobby, I need you to carry these for me,” he said, holding out one of his boxes. Nothing. “Yeah, I guess he doesn’t listen to me anymore,” he deduced. Ron frowned.
“You came.” He said, and his throat tightened at the sight of her. She wore a black cloak with the hood hiding more of her face, but he knew it was her. He could see wisps of pale blonde hair peeking out and recognized the diamond ring on her left hand.
“Of course,” he grinned and paused when a small knock caught their attention. Mrs. Weasley (who had been discreetly sliding food towards him throughout this entire situation), yanked out her wand.
"What? The poor girl is failing," Draco snorted and leaned back on Harry's desk at the front of the classroom, "Honestly, the whole 'mystery' behind it is kind of poppycock. We weren't even technically 'missing' for that year," he added with air quotes. A few people hurriedly reached for parchment in an attempt to start writing, "We were eighteen and went back for our final year at Hogwarts since we kind of missed it with the war or whatever," he said, waving the words away, "And it was like... three in the morning, I think-"
“Yeah,” Draco finally sighed, “Okay. Fine. I’ll help her.” He relented. He wouldn’t talk to her as he did it, but whatever. He would help. Maybe he could ask Harry to update him on his weird fascination with whatever journal he mentioned finding in the bathroom was.
“She’s nice though?” He pushed and Draco nodded. Despite Andromeda’s stern glances and voice of doom, Draco found she always looked after him in the same way his mother typically did.
"Right, yeah. That... makes sense. We should. Uh, have you had... that kind of conversation before?" He asked, sitting up. He didn't like this at all nope. This felt awkward as Hell. Harry was so lucky Draco was willing to put up with this. Dear
.” He grumbled, gesturing to where Draco and Ron had apparently decided to hijack the game and make their own rules. Hermione didn’t even both to stop them as Draco went about trying to change the name of the places on the board to ‘Diagon Alley’ and other familiar wizard names while Ron tried to figure out how to make the pieces into the Sorting Hat, Fluffy, and other things they were more familiar with.
“I’ll help him,” he snapped, shoving his completed potion to the side and marching to Potter’s table. Granger gaped after him, having just finished her work as well.
Christmas wasn’t exactly a thrilling event for Draco. Sure, Ron and Harry were here, but it wasn’t the same as being back home in his room with his parents and… No. He wouldn’t think of it. It didn’t matter. He didn’t even care anymore.
His thoughts were jolted when a roar came over the crowd. Everyone clapped and cheered as Harry smiled weakly back at them.
The world was strangely numb. Slowly, he put down the parchment. He sat there for a moment - unsure of his next move. Was there really anything left for him to feel right now? His life had been so...loud these past few years. There had been so many emotions, events, traumas... He wondered if the ability to process it all had been zapped from him. Forcing down the vile taste rising in his throat, he put the letter back in his pocket.
"We thought," she began, voice cracking, "We thought it could be different for us. That we could maybe do things... differently. Still within tradition, of course, but... maybe give our children more free reign. We did try, Draco. When we had Cassi it felt like a sign. Then we had you and I was so certain we could raise you better than my parents had. Your father and Bellatrix were meant to be married," she said and Draco nodded. Sirius had told him years ago, "When him and I met though... we fought for each other. I wanted you and Cassi to marry whatever pureblood you wanted. To not have to conform quite as much as we had to in the past."
"Hey, Jenkins," he greeted a few weeks later and put down a few cups of pudding at the edge of his bed, "What do you have for me?" He asked as he grabbed a piece of parchment and quill. Jenkins had been a
“See?” Hermione said when she dragged them into the classroom to put the poor thing’s tail into the wall. Draco frowned. “Then you put bread in here and-”
There to break his bones one at a time. There to rub salt in bleeding wounds. There to regrow body parts after they were cut off. There burn and there to -
“I don’t want to argue with you about this so soon,” Draco sighed. This did not seem to deter Harry. Draco could already see his face hardening. “My parents could be killed if I don’t do this.”
“Manipulative. Nice.” Draco said. Looks like he had been a bad influence on his friends after all. Hermione hit the back of his head. “Joking!” he defended and beamed down at Harriet.
“Yes. I need new robes already,” he laughed nervously, “Is mother with you?” He asked, peering around. Lucius shook his head.
“I don’t know. He probably knew your parents better than you do now.” Draco shrugged. Harry grumbled at that, saying some words that Draco was rather impressed he knew at their age. “Anyways, it’s nonsense that I have detention while you don’t. You have to come with me.”
“Are you Fae?” Hermione asked Caspian and before he could answer, continued, “I’ve read all about you, but there are so many conflicting stories it’s hard to figure out what is true. Do you mind if I ask you some questions….”
“You could definitely give her competition Aunt Alice, no doubt about it,” Harry said smiling at his godmother.
“It’s got to be better than Prince Harry,” he answered annoyed. “It will be even worse when I become King.”
“Love you to mum, see you soon,” Harry replied, his nervousness leaving him in the wake of his mothers.
“This Rita Skeeter is as bad as you said she was, Sirius,” Harry said as he read the paper with a frown. “She just barely stopped short of calling mum a murderer and a mudblood, if only she knew.”
“Banished to the human world, she was to have no memory of her beginnings, but when I was conceived, she remembered. She wrote that she believed her mother wove a spell to release those memories if she ever conceived a magical child. I found out later that my father was a squib, I think that is what helped activate the Fae blood.
“Yes, your Highness,” Magus replied and moved to take the man, grasping his shoulder rougher than necessary, and smoking out.
“I never should have let you talk me into leaving you behind,” Godric whispered to the now dubbed Fawkes.
“Git, way to be supportive,” Harry snarked, nudging Neville, causing the boy to outright laugh at him.
“Bidh an cruinneachadh inntinneach dhut. Cha do bhruidhinn thu barrachd air beagan fhaclan ri Draco bho fhuair thu a-mach gur e do charaid a bh ’ann,”
“Surprise, sweetheart,” his mother replied with a smile and sat up holding her arms open for him. Harry threw himself into her embrace and hugged her close, crying in his happiness.
“Caspian, stop teasing my son before he explodes,” Lily said as she moved to Harry and wrapped an arm around his waist.
“We have always known, one day, a new King would rise. The betrayal was devastating to our kind, and Fae split into two courts. But we knew, one day, we would be reunited by a new King. So we kept the guard and worked hard for the time we would reunite.”
Dumbledore clutched his chest and Lily’s smile grew as she waited, but it was not to be and he recovered rather quickly, much to the group's disappointment. It seems she couldn’t give the old man a heart attack just by her presence.
“We could not find anything about what I was until my mother passed away. I was given her journals, and discovered she was exiled from the Fae or Faerie folk,” Lily said, “sometimes known as the Sidhe or Seelie. You see she had no magic to speak of, and that, to the Fae is an abomination.
“I was so busy fighting the part of Voldemort that latched onto Harry, that I could do nothing to protect him, until he was 4, by that time, I managed to purge Voldemort from him and then I could help him, but only a little. It took me a year to get both of us strong enough to push from the other side to join my essence and reclaim my body.” She smiled at their shocked expressions.
she whispered and smiled as Harry drifted off to sleep as she said the spell. She encased him in a bubble of silence and sat back, to examine Ragnock.
“We are Fae are we not?” Lily asked with a smile that was not kind in any way. “We may not be as bad as the legends say, but Seelie and Unseelie alike, we do love our revenge.” Lily glanced at Khidell before adding, “some of us are just a little more bloodthirsty about it.”
“I’m sure a few of the others will be too. Gran has been using that chocolate to bribe many Fae,” Harry said laughing.
Harry had lost count of the number of people he had touched, his magic was unsettled under his skin in his annoyance at the whole thing. He just wanted to get this over with but knew he needed the ritual gathering circle for safety.
“This is Caspian and Meri,” Harry said to Hermione who was gapping at Meri. That seemed to distract the girl as she focused on his guards.
“Just be grateful it’s the only one I shoved on you,” Harry said with a glare, “that can change you know. Besides you know that if Helga hadn’t agreed it wouldn’t have happened at all.”
“Of course, though it will be difficult for him. His father is a Death Eater and has been trying to persuade the boy to join, but he absolutely refuses.”
It got to the point that they had to bring in teachers from Elphyne to pick up some of the subjects. There were quite a few that were up to date with the wizarding subjects, thanks to Harry and Neville. But Remus was the one with the most Wizarding experience, though he wouldn’t be coming through until tomorrow.
“We have always hoped a new King would rise and they would return. Life was so much better under the rule of the united court, goblins walked with their heads held high and sat on the council.”
“They are doing well, the soul anchors that Tom Riddle left are all destroyed, only his body remains. They have captured him and are holding him in Elphyne. A few of the guards have been testing out new spell work on him, but he will be kept alive until Harry orders his demise. By the hand of the other can mean many things, it seems. I am sure Caspian will be thrilled to end the so-called Dark Lord’s life.”
Lily felt the hairs on the back of her neck stand up and moments later the sound of someone arriving by apparition was heard. Lily moved downstairs and leant against the damaged door frame, looking out to see who it was. She was confident in her wards, knowing the place was now completely hidden from anyone but her.
“Yes, she and your father have been arguing about it for a while now. We all know it’s not safe for everyone. Your father and Sirius were lucky they survived it, but your Gran, she’s just too old. The Healers say the transformation will likely kill her.”
“Yes well, I’m more worried about you, brother,” Neville said eyeing Caspian, and then muttering under his breath, “I may have to ask Aunt Lily for a new guard, though.”
When the Goblin King, Rugnuk himself had rushed to the London branch of the bank at the call, he had taken care of everything and since he knew exactly what Lily could do to them all, the Potter’s were now under Gringotts protection, his protection and were made number one priority customers. He would not let his kind face her wrath.
“What do you know of Snape and Dumbledore’s relationship?” she asked as she walked back into the house.
“Luna,” Celeste said, hugging her tightly. “This is the reason why I had to leave and why I could not return until King Harry returned to the wizarding world to find his mate. She would have been slaughtered by our kind, before Lily, and even after. You know there are still some Seelie and Unseelie alike that would love to keep the two separated.
“Remember,” Lily said as they stopped, pulling him into a hug, “Cas and Nym will be with you at all times. You will be pleased to know Khidell talked me into lowering your guard to them two and just Meri and Magus,” she added looking completely put out by the fact.
“Being in the same room as you taints the very air, and makes my stomach turn,” she said and turned to one of the invisible guards. “Magus, take this thing and put it in the dungeons.”
Petunia had just placed a plate in front of her Duddikins spot, sneered at her nephew, who was standing next to her son and turned to dish up Vernon’s plate. When she turned back around she dropped the plate and screamed, causing her husband to come running into the room.
“We plan to rule it,” Khidell said as he entered the room. “It will be like it was before. Fae will set the rules, you pitiful wastes of magic will follow them.”
“Well, in the hidden family part of the castle we have a huge amount of farmland that grows the fruit, vegetables and herbs that are needed for the school. The elves run that, and also raise the animals on the land. Chickens for eggs, cows for meat and milk etc. The rest is just upgrading supplies and the like, hence the vaults at Gringotts.”
“Neville Longbottom,” Neville said as he stood up and grabbed her hand, kissing it after introducing himself.
Harry smiled at Neville and dragged him over to Quidditch Quality Supplies, “I have just the thing.”
“Oh and Nyad,” Lily said, “you will be meeting with Caspian soon, concerning your dealings with Neville and how you have trained him. When you discover what has happened, I expect Neville to be relatively unharmed at the end of your, shall we say, new lessons.”
“I remember touching Harry and being surprised,” Draco turned and looked right at Harry, a small smile on his lips. “He’s mine,” Draco breathed out in awe.
The castle has sealed them all in the Great Hall,” Godric said with a smile. “Seems she is feeling dramatic today.”
“Maybe this isn’t such a good idea,” Harry said as the crowd continued to try and get a peek at him and his mother while spouting off all sorts of nonsense.
He did not miss the smirk aimed in his direction from Caspian as he took his place beside his King, and blushed quite prettily as far as Cas was concerned.
“Hello love, how are you this morning, any nerves?” Alice asked as she hugged and kissed Harry, then her son.
“Sure,” Draco answered, “I mean when the Goddess herself tells you that you will be a triad you really don’t get to argue. Besides, look at him Harry,” Draco added.
“Though all halflings will be invited, only those over the age of sixteen will be taking part. For those of you who are of magical heritage only, I apologise for you being unable to attend, but we do not allow non-Fae without our realm, without cause.”
He could see it spread across Harry’s face when the words had registered in Harry’s mind. Stupid, he thought to himself. Caspian had always been a sore topic for Harry. He had been drawn to the man for as long as Neville could remember, and had hoped Cas would be his mate.
Light flashed as the ring resized itself, a fissure of magic arched off the ring and hit the necklace, causing it to turn to smoke and disappear, reappearing solidified around Lily’s neck.
“Now I know where you get it from, Nev,” Harry said, with a little laugh, causing Frank to glare at him.
“So Siofra will be returning with us, after the gathering? Are they sure she is completely ready?” Lily asked Sirius after they had been informed of everything else going on.
” she demanded, and once she had uttered those words, the room sealed, and the goblin in front of her was frozen in place.
“Khidell,” he answered with a bow, “leader of the Royal Guard. It is my honour and duty to protect and guide the future King.”
“Well, nothing here is as good as the stuff at home, but we should buy something,” Neville said screwing up his nose.
“They should under normal circumstances,” Helga said as she walked next to him, Godric at Harry’s back. “But we are here, and the school is ours, so no, he will be kept in the dark until we confront him.”
“Of course, your Highness,” Khidell said and called a guard to him, having a whispered conversation before six of the guard smoked away.
“What have you done,” Godric bellowed as he moved to stand in front of Dumbeldore, shocking Harry out of his thoughts.
“I named him Ash when he came to me as a boy. He put up with the childish name with as much grace as a powerful immortal creature could,” Godric said with a sad laugh.
“We died, October 31st 1981, I managed to protect Harry, when a part of my essence melded with his mind. When Dumbledore went against our wishes and sealed our will he placed my beautiful boy with my sister and her husband.
Rugnuk gentle took Harry’s hand into his and pierced the tip of his finger with the blade, and let a few drops fall into the potion. He waved his hand over the small prick and healed it instantly.
“I don’t know. One minute I had Harry in my arms, the next I was on the street with the single-minded need to get Pettigrew. They said I was spelled, there were many removed from me when I was under the Goblins care,” Sirius said, scrunching up his face in concern.
Lily waved her hand around her head causing half of her hair to rise and braid itself, allowing her ears to be prominently displayed.
“Two visible, twelve invisible,” Alice said laughing at the look on his face. Though they will be spread out over Hogwarts, and Khidell is taking even more to guard your mother.”
“Yes, the bright green of Harry and myself are significant for our heritage. Of course, not all Fae have green, but we all have the brightness.”
“Okay, first things first,” Ivy said as she moved forward. “Why have you gone through your second awakening?”
“We had a nice conversation with Danu,” Luna said from her position, snuggled up to Neville with a beautiful smile on her face.
“Mummy, you were gone from the room,” Harry said as he launched himself at her, trying to keep his tears at bay, “I thought you left me,” he whispered.
Her husband’s will was read, Sirius Black was in the process of being exonerated and wasn’t Lily pissed off about that, the goblins were moving to free him before she had left the building.
Cheers went up through the crowd, and Harry’s heart skipped in anticipation and nervousness. It was time.
“I know, it was stupid, and I’m sure Nyad will make sure I learn my lesson,” Neville said, slightly disgruntled.
“How can it be okay?!” Harry asked, spinning around, “I don’t know what I’m doing, Draco!” He said, voice shaking more than he had ever heard it, “My mother is the reason I survived as a baby. The reason I survived Quirrell. Fawkes is the reason I survived the chamber. Sirius would have died if Hermione didn’t have a time turner and-”
“Here!” He greeted and dumped one of the sacks in his hand, “So we can raid Honeydukes.” He told him with a grin. “Then maybe we can go to the Shrieking Shack… if you’re not scared that is.” He asked, eyes twinkling. Draco scoffed.
“I’m done giving you a pep talk.” He grumbled and then paused. There was something else he should probably say. Something he had actually been wanting to say since he got back. Just as he watched Ron turn away, he grabbed his arm back. “This was also pretty clever.” He said and pulled out the chain to show the ticking watch around his neck. Ron’s eyes widened.
He said firmly and pulled him away. Draco wanted to argue but found himself coming up short with every argument about to leave his lips.
“I… maybe, but they can’t just ignore the truth.” Harry said. Ah. Well. Wrong again. Harry’s frown deepened at Draco’s expression. “Can they?”
“Madam Pomprey said not to leave our - you’re a bad listener,” Draco interrupted himself as he sat up in his bed to find Harry already walking over with his blanket trailing around him. “There’s no room!” He added. Harry simply pushed him over and crawled into his hospital bed before offering him a box of Bertie Bott’s Every Flavored Beans.
Draco wasn't sure how, but... was he getting away with this somehow? No way he got out of this unscathed.
to get you together - and it wasn't like neither of you knew! Harry and I may have taken some time to figure it out, but you two didn't get together because you were both
“I like you with them better.” He decided. Harry tilted his head a bit at that. He looked at Draco before taking a long breath and turning to face forward.
“Maybe if you stop wearing such distressing clothes or using appalling table manners, I would consider it.”
to, but I figured we probably should eventually. I don't want to accidentally cross any boundaries." He said with such concern that Draco honestly thought he could die at how sweet it was. It was a fair question... That didn't stop Draco from turning red at the implications of it all. He gave a small nod.
"I believe you," he said simply and gently pulled his hand off of him to walk down to the courtyard, "But you were still going to go right."
All of which led Draco to this very disturbing moment. A room full of glowing, glass spheres. One of which marked with Harry’s name… and a room full of Death Eaters.
. Ron was dumb. The hat was very sensible... sort of. Okay, Draco didn't understand the hat either, but that was beside the point. "Where are we going?"
“We’ll figure it out,” he said… though the words sounded tired. “Somehow.” He murmured. Draco felt a stab of guilt at that and nodded. Sure. Draco would at least see to it they had a chance - or die trying. He glanced over to where Ginny was cooing over a Pygmy Puff. “How was Borgin and Burke’s?” He tacked on. Draco turned to stare at him.
"Yeah, nothing happened," he agreed, "Well, nothing happened that particular night. Actually," he said, shaking his head... because that wasn't technically correct, "Harry said he liked me that night so I guess it wasn't
“I know and I plan to keep it that way. The records have been cleared and his identity will be kept quiet,” Lily answered, looking at Khidell with a frown of her own.
She smiled viciously at that; whoever tried to open them would have been in all sorts of trouble. Even she couldn’t open them until Harry was born, James had had to read them to her before then.
Lily looked out over the students, her visage turning stern as she placed her hands on either side of the stand, “there are a couple more things before the feast shall begin. First and foremost, is the reports on the rampant bullying that has been going on at Hogwarts.
“Fine,” Harry pouted, as he got up, Hedwig flying off of Caspian’s shoulder to land on Harry’s as he stood.
Harry was still sleeping when Lily walked out of Gringotts, her ring firmly back on her finger, the Heir ring on little Harry’s. Three goblins were dead, including Ragnock and Dumbledore was forbidden entry into Gringotts by the time she was done.
Luna looked back at him, a knowing smile on her face. Yes, she would protect her mate and her Kings, she promised herself. Noone would take either of them from her.
There were new Fae in the crowd, that had not been old enough to attend last year, as well as the halflings from Hogwarts, causing Harry to sigh.
“We have a lot to discuss,” Lily said, smiling at everyone in the room, “but maybe someone should call Frank.”
“What?” Sirius stuttered until he realised Lily and Harry seemed to be in some sort of trance. He moved to reach them but was blocked by one of the guards.
Draco greeted them as they sat at the table and Harry smiled at the boy before paying attention to his mum.
Harry couldn’t help but laugh at the comment and the look on his Aunt Alice’s face, as the guard led them towards the train. The huffs of outrage from the gawkers were also rather amusing.
“You know your Uncle Frank, besides I don’t think Augusta would listen to any excuse either way,” Alice said with a frown. “She is just as stubborn as your mother,” Alice added with a smile.
“Well, we are powerful, but not that powerful,” Lily said with a smile. She frowned after a moment and sighed, “Harry will start to manifest his Fae traits eventually, though I am unsure of when, due to me being fae and his father a wizard, with active magic, but when he does,” Lily tucked her hair behind her ears and smiled at the intake of breath from her in-laws, “yes, it is hard to hide what we are,” she added as she flipped her hair back to cover her ears again.
She waited for Harry to get to her side and pulled him into a sideways hug, “so you saw your dad?” She asked, her voice dripping with emotion.
“Yes,” he said, letting his bag fall to the ground, “Are you going to try and persuade me not to like everyone else?” He asked. Severus paused in casting some enchantments over the door before looking at him in the same way he used to look at him back as a child. You know, the one adults gave when a five-year-old asked about Father Christmas or some other question that would create an internal debate on whether to be truthful or nice.
“I would be so upset if this kept happening while I was behaving myself in Slytherin.” Draco sighed. Looks like they won the House Cup again. How wonderful. He would have made another snarky comment, but was silenced by a familiar bird flying to Dumbledore.
“I’ll be honest, Vernon might be on my list if I knew you would let me kill him.” He said and a small squeak sounded from beside them. Draco turned to see Dudley Dursley watching them with wide eyes. “Don’t worry,” Draco told him brightly, “I pinky promise I won’t cut open your throat while sleeping.” He winked.
“I didn’t… Oh my God,” Draco groaned and flopped on his back, “I just said my boyfriend was the one with black hair and green eyes. I didn’t think she would assume it was
“Sorry,” he said and reached up to run his thumb over Harry’s jaw, “I’m fine. Just… tired.” He admitted, “Also, I am very annoyed with you.” He added, scowling a bit. Harry frowned.
To Draco’s utter bafflement, Lockhart himself was also found in Flourish and Blotts with a ridiculous smile and eager eyes. It only took a moment for him to find Harry in the crowd, dragging him to the front with cameras flashing wildly at the pair of famous fools together.
"Umbridge is using a blood quill on Harry," he said and the smile disappeared from Andromeda's face. Sirius also froze - going so still that Draco felt as though he better get the rest of it out fairly quickly, "He didn't want us to tell anybody." He explained and went on to tell them both the reasons why nobody had said anything and what exactly Umbridge had been doing to Harry during all those detentions.
Draco wrote and rewrote with a sense of fury. He was on his fourth draft of this stupid letter, and a wave of defeat was beginning to crumble over him as he swallowed.
"I don't know about Lucius," Andromeda said slowly, "Narcissa though... she may be on You-Know-Who's side, but she would help you if it meant Draco was safe." She answered and stood up, lightly tugging at her hair as she paced, "The manor is your best bet."
“Or,” he rectified, ignoring the relief on Montague’s face, “We can make a show of it. What do you think Bella?” He asked down the spiral staircase, “Should we give my headmaster the send off he deserves?”
“Aw, come on. Where’s that Gryffindor courage? Listen, I think I can maybe even make it so you have something like Moody’s eye-”
“You’re reaching for something that no longer exists.” He told him and went back to his potion. Draco swallowed. He was right, of course. It just hurt to admit. “What you should be asking is for me not to tell your aunt.”
“Who are you going with?” Harry asked. Draco paused. Oh. Right. He looked Harry over curiously. Technically…
Zoe tilted her head a bit, golden hair spilling down her back so that it blinded some students behind them.
“A knife must come out of it,” Draco said, though he failed to see how a knife popping out of the hole would be much different than just a normal knife. That was really the only way he could think of metal shooting out of it though. “I don’t remember learning about it muggle studies…” he mused. Ron opened his mouth to respond, but it was at that moment a knock sounded.
“Hermione.” Ron cut her off sharply and then shook his head. Hermione blinked a few times before very slowly turning back to him.
“Ron said you used a spell to wake me up,” he greeted. Draco internally cringed. He didn’t like the way Harry was looking at him. They were alone in one of the house’s many rooms - Draco had gone to one of the more obscure ones in hopes of being left alone - but alas. Not even the house's favor helped when his highness Sir Potter decided they needed to speak.
Draco tried to get up to join him, but there was another snap as the wall he had been thrown into cracked, and a large piece of stone tumbled down. The last thing he heard was Harry screaming his name before everything went black.
“I asked you,” Voldemort said, robes sweeping broadly as he turned, “To bring me the prophecy. You told me you could do this.” He said, taking a step towards her. Bellatrix took a sharp breath, stepping back slightly.
"We were actually hoping you would you choose the middle name," Remus corrected gently. Harry wasn't sure why, but he got the feeling that somehow Remus already knew what the name was going to be as Sirius blinked a few times - looking stunned to answer.
“We were just talking-” Theo began and Draco turned to find Ron and Hermione behind him, both looking equal parts annoyed and smug.
“Oh, but you’re going to be so very busy doing chores,” Andromeda told him, patting the side of his cheek, “Did you think I was joking in that howler?”
“Thank you for coming,” he finally said and paused when she put a hand on his shoulders, “I, um, know you didn’t have to-”
“That would have been nice,” Regulus’ painting said, voice muffled from the cover. Sirius rolled his eyes. “Glad to be included-”
,” Draco warned and quickly stepped forward to pull him into a hug. He had planned for this moment of weakness to last only a second, but Harry immediately returned the gesture, clinging somewhere between uncertain and pleased. Draco couldn’t blame him. He wasn’t really too familiar with hugs either. “Okay. That’s done,” Draco mumbled when Harry finally let go.
This didn’t answer Draco’s question at all, but he was beginning to think that Longbottom couldn’t carry on a conversation anyway. Instead he shrugged and bitterly picked at his food.
"Fine, fine," Harry murmured, "Since you asked so nicely," he added, tying the letter around Hedwig's leg. She gave a low hoot before taking off, diving from the tower before opening her wings to glide out towards the sky. Harry turned back to look him over. "Well, is there anything that would make you feel better?" He asked, coming back to towards the bed. Draco peered up at him.
“Wait,” Ron interrupted. “You haven’t heard from her?” He asked and Draco shrugged. “Ugh, she must still be in the library,” Ron sighed, running a hand over his face. “She’s going to miss the quidditch match… which you should be getting ready for.” He added.
He shouted and barely managed to levitate a rock to block a sudden flash of green coming from behind his cousin. Dora spun around, eyes blown wide as she seemed to register how close the hit came. More importantly though was the fact the onslaught was not done. More spells came at them both all with a rapid fire. Draco tried to block what he could, but Dora ended up taking the brunt of it. It was probably only her training under Moody that allowed her to move fast enough to deflect and dodge well enough so that they weren't dead in minutes.
"I've always told you what's going on!" Harry hissed, face going bright red, "I've never lied to you outside of that
“They’re horrible to him!” Draco sighed, “They put bars on his window. And how many letters have we gotten asking for food because they
It wasn’t that Draco minded at this point. Gryffindor had, admittedly, been one of the best things to happen to him. He just didn’t understand what about him possessed the hat to choose what it did. Any bravery or chivalry he had displayed throughout the years had been learned behavior. Definitely not inherent.
“And he’ll owl me if that changes - right, Harry?” He called over his shoulder. Harry grinned at him, pulling his suitcase up to them as Hermione fixed him with a semi-exasperated look.
“Then why is he?” Draco said and then yanked his bag off of the bench he had left it on, “You know what? I don’t even care. I have muggle studies to go to and we’re going to learn about video games and it’s going to be great. Bye.” He announced.
“I would,” Draco shook his head, “Even if it didn’t work out… I wouldn’t just leave you with nowhere to go.” He said. Theo opened his mouth to respond, but was cut off by someone clearing their throat. They both turned to find Ron, sopping wet standing to the side.
“This should be fun.” He said and reached inside his robes to grab his wand. Neville looked over the Hufflepuff practically sprinting out of the transfiguration classroom warily.
“Another close call by Potter out there… Oh, and Malfoy passed the quaffle up again. Very unlike of him,” Lee said as Draco spun around to see the bludger still chasing him. Really, it was only Harry’s talent in weaving that was keeping him from getting hit. He turned to Madam Hooch in frustration.
. It was such a simple name. Common. Muggle even. Draco had heard it a million times before. Why did it bother him so much? He looked back towards the boy, appearing in the mist almost as if he were part of the mist himself. Draco swallowed, noting with a sense of horror that the black diary in Ginny’s arms also seemed oddly familiar. Too familiar. In fact, he was pretty sure he had seen it in his father’s study numerous times. He picked it up, feeling his skin prickle at the name glittering in the low light of the chamber.
“I’m supposed to figure out what this is for my muggle studies class and now Ron is saying there is fire in walls and we haven’t even
“No, I… well, I suppose technically his mother was a witch, wasn’t she? I never quite got how that worked,” Fleur said and Draco paused. Obviously? Maybe he was translating something wrong. Fleur’s French was (unsurprisingly) quite a bit better than his. “I never heard much about his upbringing either. There are rumors that it was awful though. I don’t know in what way,” Fleur continued to muse, “Maybe you’re being too hard on him.”
“After this war is over I’m going to invite them to my house,” Sirius said conversationally, eyes watching Vernon thoughtfully, “To introduce him to my mom.”
"Do I?" He asked and took a step closer, "I am surprised in you, Draco. I would have thought you would have some sort of clever plan to get me to spare your life," he mused, "No more games?"
Lastly, idk how clear I made it in the chapter, but Zoe is 100% trans. It won't be too relevant for much other than Hermione getting to learn more about sexuality/gender in the wizarding world (which might not even be included in my final edits for future chapters, idk). I haven't touched too much on my hcs there bc they'll only be briefly mentioned in this fic, but I totally think there are basically two types of purebloods - the ones like Malfoys, Blacks, etc... who do the whole 'ensure the bloodline' thing so they are kinda annoyed by gender/sexuality fluidity bc it can make it harder for them to have kids (tho not impossible necessarily bc... magic). THEN there are purebloods like the Potters, Weasleys, Lovegoods, etc... who are just like 'ya love is love' type vibe. HOWEVER there's actually an overlap in the Slytherin house bc due to misinformation and propaganda BOTH don't like muggles/muggleborns. The former because of their 'filthy blood' and the second because muggles are made out to be notoriously homophobic/transphobic.
“Thanks,” he said and stuck out his tongue a bit as he worked, “They’re actually a lot more comfortable than the ones I used to wear.”
Granger’s hand launched in the air so quickly, Draco was quite certain it could have broken if something attempted to interfere with its course.
'. Draco assumed there was a story there, but didn't bother to ask more on it. He had no doubt that it had something to do with his boyfriend being the menace he was destined to be, "Potions prodigy..." He muttered. Draco tapped on the table to regain his attention.
hating myself for it. I thought they would kill you!” He said and shook out his hands to keep them from trembling. “I already have to deal with the fact my parents died protecting me. That I couldn’t save Cedric. That -” He began and cut himself off, looking away. “I couldn’t handle it being my fault. I didn’t. I
Draco was having a long week. Luckily, he was able to get fixed up rather quickly by Madam Pomphrey. That was good. However, what wasn’t as good was learning the next day from Harry (who had to stay in the hospital wing to regrow his bones) that his old house elf was trying to kill his friend. Then, upon entering the dueling club - something that should have been
“Because nobody is going to focus on this tournament until this is resolved.” She said, snapping her book shut, “So we’re going to all go have a great time, Ron is going to be an idiot, Harry is going to be super awkward, and I’m going to keep you from killing them both. Then we are going to
Normally, throwing rocks wouldn’t be a cause for alarm, but Draco knew for a fact Pansy had been privy to some early education in her household, which included a momentum charm. The rock would probably break Potter’s stupid face… a hilarious scenario indeed, but it would also increase Pansy’s status among other Slytherins, and Draco just couldn’t allow that.
“Narcissa let me see her once,” he shrugged, “Lucius almost had a heart attack when he saw me there.” He snorted and shook his head, “She was a cute baby, I guess. That’s really all I knew about her. I figured something must have happened when I saw you here and not her.” He mused. Draco considered. He honestly hadn’t thought of that. Cassi never came to Hogwarts. He wondered how she would have reacted to him getting sorted into Gryffindor… it might have been nice if she sided with him. Who knows? She could have been in Gryffindor too.
At this Hermione gave a low hum of agreement because Hermione was reasonable. Harry stared at her, obviously betrayed.
“Nah, you just say that because of the Lovegoods. Buttercup is definitely a Hufflepuff.” He said and gestured the tent up and down, “Look at all the yellow.”
“Are you kidding me?!” Draco shouted loud enough that the students sitting at the other end of the table went quiet, “You want to lecture
he breathed out and rubbed her eyes. “A nap sounds nice,” she admitted. “Are you sure?” She asked. Theo and Draco both nodded. “Thank you,” she repeated with a yawn before gathering up her things to slowly drag herself up towards the common room. Theo stared after her.
“Maybe your father sent him as revenge. He could think Harry is the reason you were sorted into Gryffindor,” he said and Draco paused. That was actually a pretty reasonable conclusion. He turned to ask Hermione what she thought of that only to find the girl frowning.
Harry mentioned he was nearby - hiding. The idea Severus knew was deeply, deeply concerning considering the last time they had met had… not been pleasant to say the least. Severus gave a weak grimace in return, possibly reading Draco’s mind (a talent the man actually possessed through legilimency).
"So, should we... you know, talk?" Harry asked one night. They were in the Room of Requirement since that was the only real place to have any privacy. Draco had honestly been starting to drift off when Harry's voice pulled him out. He blinked a few times. The room had dimmed - probably sensing Draco slipping off only to brighten back up again to reveal a room that had oddly resembled Draco's childhood room back at the manor. Silver furnishings with a marble fireplace and a crystal chandelier. Harry had been sure to endlessly make fun of his taste upon entering as Draco tried to loudly object he had asked for any of it when calling for the room.
“What exactly are those...death hallowed things you were talking about?” He asked. Draco closed his eyes.
“I said the same thing to her,” she said quietly, “The night I left home. I think she just realized you sound more like me than you do her.”
“I have something to take care of,” he said with a small smile that was a hundred percent fake. Hopping up, he weaved his way to where the Slytherin table was and sat down.
“Here’s a radical thought,” Theo said and Draco tensed a bit at how dangerous his voice was bordering at, “Maybe after the mudbloods the monster can wipe out all the icebloods. You know, since we’re speaking practically here,” he said, looking Pansy straight in the eye.
“No, it isn’t,” Ron muttered, face flushing a dark red. “I just don’t want him to be a nightmare to deal with if something goes wrong.” He added on quickly. Draco nodded in agreement. Yep. They were sticking with that.
“You know I’m planning on leaving with the Death Eaters after this, but maybe I shouldn’t. I can go with you, Hermione, and Ron. Hunt horcruxes.” Draco told him. For some reason,
The crowd all seemed to react with equal confusion. There were shouts and screams as the curse Voldemort had intended for Severus hit the Mirror of Erised, sending glass shards flying into the air. Among the endless reflections of the shattered mirror soaring around them was a flash of silver and endless beads of red floating in the air around them. It was hard to tell where the sword actually was until it was too late.
pretty powerful. I know there were rumors that he was also interested in getting the hallows. He might have found one and then after his duel with Dumbledore-"
“If my master can’t have the prophecy…” she began and pointed her wand at Harry. Remus and Shacklebolt both attacked at once. Neville grabbed a still convulsing Harry to pull to the side. Draco looked back. Bellatrix still had the knife. When she went towards Harry once more, Sirius struck again - his curse didn't quite hit, but grazed her side. Bellatrix spun back around with a snarl.
he was going to try and piss everyone off. Before the drama could start, he yanked Theo towards a quill shop.
He had a lot of questions. Until this moment, Draco hadn't known she was even alive. What did that mean for his father? For him? What exactly did happen at the manor? Was she a prisoner? Or one of them? Draco couldn't think of which question he wanted to ask first as she walked over to Harry's body. Part of him wanted to growl at anyone going near Harry, but forced himself to keep quiet as his mother knelt down and ran a hand softly over Harry's chest, pressing her ear down.
Luna had ended up doing the seating arrangement for the wedding. She had an uncanny ability to know where to best place everyone so that no fights broke out... she claimed the dingle frogs helped her. It had been a bit of a surprise to see she had left an empty seat in the reserved section.
“Vernon Dursley?” He asked the mustache man. There was a pause to which Vernon looked around, spluttering for a moment at this small eleven-year-old, “Hello, my name is Draco Malfoy,” he continued, nonplussed. “We have much in common, you see.”
“We’re skipping class,” he decided and stood up, noticing Harry entering the Great Hall, “WE’RE SKIPPING CLASS!” Ron yelled to him. Hermione rolled her eyes, but hummed in agreement, snapping her book shut.
“She also told me to eat dirt so she is still herself,” Harry tacked on wryly. Draco smiled at that, beaming fondly down at Harriet. There were a few more pauses in which Harry gave a few hisses and hums. “Rude.” He finally said. Draco gave a questioning tilt of his head.
“He’s dying?” Harry cut him off, suddenly sitting up very straight. Draco blinked. “What do you mean he’s dying?”
be careful." Draco told her. Theo's name was whispering in the back of his head. He had already hurt one person in that friend group. He couldn't let anything happen to Zoe too. She gave him a bright smile before skipping towards the phone booth. Great. Yeah, this was going to go wonderfully. He could feel it in his bones. Taking a long breath, he followed the others inside.
Draco. I know you mean well. Both you and my mom had your opinions even before Remus and I got married," she said. Draco flinched.
"No, I'm a pureblood," Draco said, "Though, technically, I'm also a bloodtraitor and he's trying to kill those too so I guess maybe I am on his list..." He mused thoughtfully and shrugged, "Truthfully, he's more obsessed with trying to kill my boyfriend."
"You didn't fail," Severus said, looking over his shoulder before glancing back at Sirius warily, "His fate was sealed for years."
There was a long pause. Harry opened and closed his mouth a few times before simply nodding. Draco gave a solemn nod before gesturing him a bit closer. Harry got out of his seat to walk over and frown right as Draco reached up to smack his head.
. Draco knew this because he had the unfortunate habit of always walking in on them. It was truly a nightmare. His only reprieve was when Ron had walked in on them once and then spent a solid hour screaming about it and banned Ginny from the boys’ dormitory. Then, because he liked to abuse his prefect powers, he gave them both detention, which Draco found
“They aren’t ‘banshee powers’, you dentist!” Tristam told her, leaning away from the rain that had started pouring over Zoe’s head, “Don’t call them that-”
“How are your teeth?” He asked and Draco shrugged, “When I first started transforming, my teeth would always hurt because of the fangs.” He said lightly and rubbed a thumb over Draco’s battered knuckles. “It happens when you transform too much. How often are you doing it?”
“I’m going to bed.” Draco told them. His entire face was hot. All he wanted to do was disappear under his blankets and not move for three days. He began to storm up the stairs fiercely just as he heard Hermione sigh and Harry say:
”Am I right to assume there are things you won't be telling us?” Remus asked from where he was sitting next to Sirius. His voice was oddly gentle for such a question. Draco grimaced.
Draco should really know better. Apparently, in true Harry Potter fashion, Viktor and Harry went for a walk only to come across a very bloody and very disheveled Crouch. Then, upon Harry leaving to get Dumbledore, Krum was then attacked by Crouch. Typical.
won’t do.” Zoe said and looked at Pansy with a small frown, “Blaise, come here!” She called joyously. Draco peered down to see Blaise pause in reading the prophet to glance over warily at them. Upon seeing Draco, he sighed and slid over.
"Two weeks ago?" she said, running her hand through her hair, "He spoke to Ted last, I think. He had gotten caught by some snatchers and Draco managed to get him out. Ted got to Hogwarts okay though. He said Draco had a plan on how to smooth things over. I... I mean, I hadn't thought to worry because Draco wouldn't have risked anything if didn't know he would be okay. His plans have worked well so far." She said but there was a rising note of panic. Ron grimaced.
have the Elder Wand or maybe he’s given up on ever finding the Resurrection Stone… or your cloak isn’t the right one. I could be grasping at straws,” he admitted, “I just know he’s ambitious. He’s always hinted that to me. Someone like Dumbledore would get bored playing with normal people and want a challenge. The hallows are the perfect challenge… plus he’s dying so I don’t know why he wouldn’t-”
Sirius stared back. Despite the rising cries and shouts from outside, he didn't seem to react. He just stood there. Not moving. As if perhaps the world had gone still until he digested everything.
eyes!” Bole swooned, holding up a book high above his head. Elaine scowled and flicked her wand so the book went flying out of his hand. From where he was lying in one of the couches, Marcus sat up quickly, spilling his forgotten homework everywhere.
Harry sighed. There was pressure on his hand and it took Draco a moment to realize it was Harry’s hand as he squeezed tightly.
Damnit. He should have known that he was being to brash with that one. His mind flicked through all the excuses he could possibly have only to come up blank. Bellatrix gave a dangerous growl and reared back. Fuck it.
Except for the fact he wasn’t sure how to get any. Honestly, did he have to do everything? Where even was Harry?
) eyes. Now, Draco knew, in theory, that there was a good chance this baby would end up a metamorphmagus like Dora... they wouldn't be sure right away though. It was hard to tell when babies didn't tend to have a whole lot of features to change. Now that he was a couple months old he might be able to turn his hair a different color or something, but for the most part Draco knew these were the features he would have without the magic.
“Is your scream fatal?” Belby cut in, twisting his hands together nervously. Tristam pursed his lips.
"That... could still work. He's still looking for the wand. He doesn't know it's broken," Harry said and Theo tilted his head, "We could put a decoy in there. Even better is if we time it with the Horcruxes." He said, heart picking up slightly. This could work.
“I’m honored.” Harry told him flatly. He looked down at both for a moment before shrugging and dumping some of the potion directly on his head.
“Yeah!” Ron shouted back. “Yeah, I’m okay. Lockhart too.” He added as if they cared at all about Lockhart’s wellbeing. “Listen, this is going to take awhile to clear. I can go back and get the teachers. You need to go find Ginny.” He said and Harry paused.
As it turned out, him and Fleur were a better duo than he thought. While obviously beautiful, she was actually pretty polite all things considered. Draco would have thought she would be annoyed by people crawling all over her by now. Harry had mentioned she had annoyed him earlier by being condescending during the beginning of the tournament, but honestly Draco was pretty sure she just was a blunt person. That and English wasn’t her first language. It was hard to be tactful when you were trying to keep up with what you were saying half the time.
“Don’t you have to get back to Nott?” Harry asked, turning to look at him with hardened eyes. Draco wasn’t sure why the anger hurt so much. He knew it wasn’t meant for him. Not really. “Pretend you're a Slytherin or whatever it is you do with him.” He muttered and turned away before Draco had a chance to respond.
“I’m fine. Don’t need the hospital wing.” He whispered. He already knew what was wrong, actually. He just couldn’t really explain it to anyone else. Harry’s jaw tightened.
"It's true," Draco said, folding his arms against his chest, "He was held in contempt of the court. It was quite the fuss for them to do it literally a month after he killed Voldemort," he said fondly.
“Been better,” Harry said cautiously and shifted a bit closer, “Um, listen. You probably already know, but I feel like I should say it anyways…” he began. Draco nodded. He knew what he was about to say… been waiting for him to say it.
"I told him to try to hold off until we got the next horcrux. Given that they've reported it on Potterwatch, I'm sure he's already started." She said and then turned to Ron with a squeak of surprise. "Oh,
to disown me. Not the other way around!” He said, voice rising slightly. “Why? Because I was sorted into
.” He said, a bit desperately. Draco’s stomach sunk. He stared at Theo. Part of him was bubbling with raw betrayal at the revelation Theo might actually turn him over. Maybe it was a bluff. A way to keep him from being stupid. Focusing, he tried to look into Theo's mind only to feel a sharp wall raise between them.
Things were, unfortunately, not getting much better for Draco. He had been so looking forward to his first flying lesson… In fact, he had been sure it might be the only thing that might make him feel better about this whole thing.
We also finally have a SMIDGE of Drarry as well (from Draco's end at least). I did mention this was slowburn, right? lol. I do feel a little bad at how some of you seem to be growing attached to Theo... It'll be fine. Probably :D
“And I’m trying to keep you from getting killed,” Draco said calmly, “No offense, but you literally asked me if the Whomping Willow had
“He isn’t my favorite either,” Draco cut him off, looking over his shoulder, “But he’s smart and he’s powerful. More importantly, it isn’t your business what I’m doing, Theo. Stay out of it.” He warned. Theo took a long breath.
“What are you doing here?” He asked and Draco gave a slightly hysterical laugh. “It’s been three days. I’m really surprised Madam Pince has been so nice about you staying.” He said. Draco didn’t respond. In truth, he knew the reason Pince let him stay at all was because the last time she had left two kids in the library well… let’s just say he wasn’t the only one with guilt issues. The real shocker was that McGonagall hadn't chased him out...which, admittedly, was mainly due to the fact Draco had nicked Harry's invisibility cloak. “What are these?” Harry sighed as he picked up the said cloak and held it close to his chest.
the idea that she wasn’t healing properly. Harry grimaced and edged closer to the trunk, putting his chin on his palm so he could hiss to her. After a few minutes, he nodded and sat back up.
“Clever, clever, clever boy!” Alecto chuckled as she stepped out of the vanishing cabinet. Bellatrix followed closely after her, looking around the Room of Requirement with a small smile before turning towards him.
“Obviously the dream was credible considering Mr. Weasley is at St. Mungo’s,” Harry answered hotly. Draco felt his own temper rising dangerously. He wanted to tell. He wanted to tell so
“What was it you called Pansy?” Hermione asked when they finally situated Ron with a bucket and some pats on the back. “I’ve heard of a 'mudblood', but…” She fixed him with a baffled look, lips pressed into a line that was ready to turn into a disappointed frown at any moment.
Stop. He needed to keep calm. Focus on other things. Normal things. Like classes. Hagrid had decided to show them thestrals, which was all very interesting. Draco was smart enough to play dumb when Hagrid introduced them.
"Already?" He asked and as an apology, Draco kissed him, "Fine." He sighed and looked around. It felt oddly exposed... just being on the street like this. Draco knew it was safe though. He had checked at least three different times to make sure he wasn't being tailed. Not that Voldemort ever would tail him, but it was good to be cautious.
“Oh, come on. He’s only fourteen! You said yourself he’s too young! How are you going to let a poor, innocent child drown?” He asked. Fleur stopped to give him a stern look. “He doesn’t have the vast knowledge of potential charms and spells that you do.” He added.
“Of course, not!” He growled “But people can change – I did!” He argued “I believed in all of that. And if I can help my parents see then maybe-”
"No!" Draco told him, a bit too quickly. Guilt gnawed at him the moment he heard the name, sending his stomach twisting uncomfortably. "I just - Voldemort is back. It's a lot, okay? I'm coping." He told them. Harry looked him over for a moment before slowly nodding. Thank God.
“...she’s interesting.” Harry said when Luna left to wander up and down the train for a while. He looked deeply disturbed, which… was probably a fair reaction upon meeting Luna. Draco shrugged, leaning back in the seat to think for a moment. “Hey.” Harry said and tapped his leg.
,” he laughed, “I don’t know if you would say I fancy her. I just... really clicked with her,” Draco said and paused to think. “Her name is Astoria.”
"Um, sure," Harry said, "Do you need any help?" He asked and Ollivander scoffed, already placing Harry's old wand to the side. Alright... that was apparently a no. He might have inquired more about how he planned on creating his wand while in hiding and under a limited time frame, but was distracted by Hermione speaking Griphook quietly in the corner. He glanced back at Ron for an explanation.
“Oh,” She said and moved towards him, arms opening. He rushed in without thinking. “Merlin, look at you.” She told him, voice shaking slightly as she buried her face into her shoulder. She still smelled like lavender. He hadn’t noticed how much he had missed the scent of her soap. “You’re taller than me now.” She chuckled and reached up to place a hand on his cheek.
Bellatrix barely dodged in time. The spell nicked her arm, sending her stumbling back with a sharp gasp of pain. When she looked back up her eyes were wild. Not that she had much recovery time because Andromeda stuck next, sending a yellow jet of light hurtling at her.
"Harry," Draco said lowly, pulling him to the side, "We should talk about what happens after we kill the snake." He said, glancing over his shoulder. "Look, you're the one destined to kill the Dark Lord. I... know how you feel about unforgivable curses. You don't want to bring yourself to their level, but... I do think you might need the killing curse to kill someone." He said holding up both hands. Harry crossed his arms over his chest.
“Honestly,” he muttered, “It’s shoddy work. I could have made much better.” He said. Harry paused in where he had been shuffling uncomfortably to shoot him a betrayed look. “What? I could. It would say ‘Potter Stinks’ with a very tasteful image of you getting punched in the nose or something... then if anyone tried to change the message it would just insult you worse.” He shrugged and threw it over his shoulder.
, Sirius-” he added when Sirius opened his mouth, “We’re good. Let’s go. Here.” He said, taking the bag before helping her to the chimney. “I’m going to buy you so much shit when this is over. I don’t even care if you don’t want it. I’m going to buy you flowers and chocolate and blankets and-” He continued on before they both entered the floo.
Ron didn’t really think it through though. Rumor had it that they made out during detention so… that backfired. Harry at least made it up to him by apologizing a million times and buying him a solid three pounds of chocolate.
"Severus Snape and Draco Malfoy. You are both under arrest," the wizard to the right greeted. Draco chuckled. This would be fun. "Please set down your wands and put your hands where we can see them."
“Draco?” Harry finally asked, turning to him. He didn’t respond. Draco wasn’t sure he even could. His tongue felt like lead in his mouth. Heavy and metallic tasting. He blinked a few times. “Draco… hey.” Harry said and tried to pull him closer to the bed. He yanked back.
Harry asked, voice rising slightly, "I didn't mean to forget! I just have quidditch practices to plan now and other homework and now the war - please? Just this once?" He asked, giving a truly pathetic look that would normally have Draco giving in. He shook his head resolutely.
“Oh?” Hermione challenged before putting the back of her hand to forehead like a fainting damsel, “I’m Draco and so sad because of my disgraced pureblood heritage and the fact the boy I’ve been crushing on for years is always shouting at me because he wants me to
“Better the ministry than a banshee,” Cormac said coldly. Tristam rolled his eyes. Draco shrugged. His work was done.
Draco held up a hand to cut her off. She wouldn’t be the one giving the order. If he was going to play this role he would do it right. He would make sure they didn’t see an ounce of mercy on him. He slowly moved his wand up from Dumbledore's chest to the base of throat. He absently tried to reach for Harry's presence. Trying to sense him. He had been right. It was helpful to know he was nearby. Draco looked Dumbledore in the eyes.
"Mate, he isn't in the best shape. Is it really fair to drag him along into more danger?" Ron jumped in, "Fleur is here. If we could trust anyone in the world with him it would be Andromeda or Fleur." He said, "So we're really lucky we have him someplace this safe. What's the sense of taking him from that? He can heal and be with people who care about him and away from any Death Eaters who might come looking for him-"
"Hogwarts seems like the obvious choice if we want complete surprise. He thinks it's in his control and we already have stuff in place thanks to Draco." he said with a nod. Theo nodded in return.
"Oh, is that Malfoy Jr himself?" Sirius asked brightly, giving him a sly grin before throwing a tickling charm his way. Draco shook his head and deflected it. Honestly. Was he really so fearful of Harry that he wouldn't even throw a proper curse at him? Draco struck back. "Oh, no. I think I angered him." Sirius snorted as he ducked and held up the knife, "Thank you for the gift by the way! I dearly cherish it-"
“Yes, loads of them…” Harry said. Moody leaned back, voice growing quiet as he tapped a finger on his knee.
“I had Professor Snape help me modify it!” He said proudly. “I told him I wanted extra credit… I’m pretty sure he knew it was for you though,” He told him and then frowned, “Then somehow my grade got worse afterwards. I don’t think he likes me very much.”
The real test came during their first potions class. As they had all filed in, Draco watched Harry and Ron take their seats before waiting to see if Hermione would join Draco as she usually did. It was so ridiculously
“I know who the Death Eater is,” Moody said and went to push Harry back down. He paused when Draco grabbed his wand suddenly, raising it directly at him.
“Reading over my shoulder?” He sneered. Admittedly, he was a little baffled by his apparent anger on the matter. Longbottom wasn’t really a threatening person, but Draco could still see his face set into a hard line of anger as his glare sharpened.
“Merlin, fine. I’m going.” Draco grumbled before going back to his animagus form. He could hear a commotion now. The Order must all be here. Draco had asked them to retreat as soon as possible, but it would be strange if they didn’t at least put up a fight. Concern tightened in the pit of his stomach. Where were Harry and Dumbledore?
“Well then Ron and Hermione can join you.” Harry piped in - bad mood momentarily pushed aside to annoy Draco. “You know, since it isn’t a date or anything.” He smiled because he was a twingy little git and Draco planned on haunting his dreams.
“You shouldn’t be here,” Sirius said, switching back into his human form. Petunia gasped. Sirius responded by flicking her off, “And you shouldn’t have warned us about the Death Eaters. Voldemort will suspect-”
Harry was gone. Andromeda was gone. Sadie was gone. Daphne was gone. Who else? He wouldn't know until the end. He didn't want to know. He had done enough, right? It had all been so much. It's okay if he tapped out now. The others could kill the snake. They didn't need him. He should be
“I’m sorry you got hurt,” Harry told him with a frown, “If I had realized I could hurt Quirrell sooner I would have protected you better.”
Daphne said, holding Pansy back when she launched herself across the table. Theo gave a delighted laugh.
"I'll get him somewhere safe," Hermione's voice said and before Draco could process anything there was more murmuring and suddenly Harry was gone again. Draco blinked. Wait. What? He frowned, letting Hermione pull them wherever they were going as his brain tried to process it. Where did he go? If they were dead why did he just
“She… kept crying over Cedric and comparing us. Then she got mad about Hermione.” He said, wrinkling his nose. “I think she only liked me because I was the one who saw Cedric die.” He said, looking a little put out by the thought. Draco felt a sharp stab in his chest at that. He was also pretty it might be more complicated than that, but that probably wasn’t the best thing to say. Hermione would be pleased with how far he had come with tact.
“I want to see what you look like with them!” He said brightly and Draco dove away. No way. He drew the line here. He would
"Do you think we'll ever be friends again?" He asked and Theo stopped twirling his wand to shoot Draco a legitimately surprised look, "I know things ended badly, but..." He was silenced by Theo kneeling down and placing his wand at Draco's feet. He got up and put a hand on his shoulder.
"DAPHNE!" A voice screamed and Draco looked up to see Luna and Ginny desperately working in tandem to drag Astoria Greengrass away from a pile of collapsed pillars, "Let me go -
She sang and then bolted off again. Pansy made a noise of disgust as both Ron and Harry’s eyes widened in alarm.
Draco sighed…and then hugged him back because quite honestly he hadn’t been sure if he would be able to ever hug Ron or Hermione again.
Other examples might be watching loved ones die or living as a double agent. Maybe his disownment. Draco really could pull anything out of the air and the crowd would be satisfied.
Draco was beginning to think he wanted this to end badly. With another clap from Quirrell, the ropes fell away, leaving Draco to sit with his final decision.
"It could be a more serious version of it," Hermione said and tapped her fingers against the table with a frown, "It said it was for enemies so I doubt it is used for cutting cloth." She pointed out. Draco shrugged.
”’s’kay. Just tired.” He sighed, closing his eyes contentedly. Harry grumbled something under his breath, but at least kept doing the hair thing. Draco moved in closer. He just needed... a bit of sleep... just a bit...
“Hey,” Tonks greeted slowly and tilted her head, “That was really quick. How did you recognize me?” She asked. Draco snorted. She did look different. Her hair was blonde now - eyes a silver that almost matched his own. It was a curious look. Andromeda had told him once that sometimes Nymphadora’s appearance changed without her permission (though it didn’t happen as often since her auror training). He wondered if she had meant for them to look similar or if it was an accident.
Harry turned out to have a bit of a temper. Draco learned this after watching both Ron and Hermione tell Harry they
“Hey, uh, you’re okay right?” Draco called after him. Harry paused in where he had a brief conversation with a painting to wave at him. “Harry - you… you’re okay?” Draco asked.
“I don’t know what you mean.” She said quickly. Draco sighed. She definitely had a time turner… and didn’t even use it to catch up on sleep. Foolishness… And he didn’t often associate that word with Hermione.
to leave him. Besides, Draco hadn't particularly shown any interest in joining them. It wasn't safe. He wasn't okay and Harry couldn't drag him into this danger knowing everything he went through-
with me. I killed someone. I mean, look at Susan Bones!" He said, thinking back to how distraught the girl had been at the beginning of the year, "How are you not angry at me? You just... you're just accepting it?" He asked, feeling tears pricking behind his eyes. He wasn't even sure why.
Hugging him with whispers of rescues and promises that nothing more would happen. Draco had fallen for it the first time. He had been so desperate to leave he didn't think to question anything. They were there. They were
“Why can’t we come to the World Cup?” Harry asked from underneath the cloak. Hermione closed her eyes. “Also, he stares at your lips a lot. Is that normal?” He asked and Draco flushed.
“She normally is so sweet. All she tends to do is play with my things.” She said. Draco gave an approving nod.
“He’s just using me as practice for when Ginny starts dating.” He grumbled. It possibly also had to do with the fact he was the first of their group to start dating and Ron being… well,
“The second you told me you were sorted in Gryffindor,” She swallowed, “I knew you had a chance. Maybe if you were free of our name and you could just see how happy Andromeda was… I assumed you would want to follow her example-”
Is that how it happened? Because I don’t remember it happening like that. Do you remember it happening like that?” He asked, poking a finger at his chest.
“The answer is this,” a woman said, entering the room with Meri holding on to her arm. She held out her other, showing a bracelet that glowed with power. “It conceals me, what I am,” she added smiling at her parents. “Hello Mother, Father,” said, as she removed the bracelet. “This is no longer needed, now that the King has brought us back together.”
“I must admit when I saw the state of it at first, no, but now that mum is working with the teachers, I am. Some of my instructors from Elphyne are coming to take over some classes and add more.”
“Where is the firebird?” Khidell asked frowning at the old man that still had not moved from his spot.
“Remus and Sirius were mad about it at first,” Harry admitted, “But now they help me… I don’t think Remus can resist teaching.” He grinned. Draco laughed at that. “By the way… him and Tonks…?”
They eventually came to a tentative agreement which was as followed: Draco would not call muggleborns mudbloods anymore because he understood they had no control over their heritage. Hermione (very warily) would acknowledge there was something to be said about magical beings that grew up around magical culture that she could maybe understand why people would think it should be preserved (though she made sure Draco was absolutely clear that even that didn’t warrant purebloods’ treatment towards muggles and muggleborns). Quite honestly, Draco wasn’t completely sold on half of what she said, but that might have to do with him not being a good listener and the fact she was wrong. He figured he would at least not call her a mudblood because she seemed better than most muggleborns anyway.
scarhead!” He snapped and flicked his forehead. Harry pouted, but gave a small nod as Madam Hooch tossed the quaffle back into play. If Draco thought he could refocus on the match, then he was sorely mistaken.
“Torture.” Draco said simply and then backtracked at their faces, “Just a bit though. Not… not too much. Just the amount you would expect.” He said.
“It isn’t that hard,” Draco shrugged, “Just don’t really worry too much about the tongue and try not to make any weird noises.” He said, wrinkling his nose. Kissing always seemed so awful in hindsight… yet he kept doing it. Really it was a bewildering duality. Harry looked alarmed.
“Could be the heliopaths.” She mused. Ginny smiled warmly at her as Tristam seemed to mull over that.
“Your classmates whisper a lot,” Fleur noted and gave polite nods to Cedric Diggory and Cho Chang. Viktor and Hermione were also entering, causing a new wave of scandalized whispers to follow. “Oh, she looks
“Yeah, the potion wore off,” he said and slid over so they were no longer facing each other, but instead touching shoulders. “So it worked for about an hour. Hope you don’t mind looking at them again.” He said dramatically. Draco smiled.
"YOU COWARDS!" Sirius yelled and Draco immediately shot up a spell into the sky (a signal to let the others know which one he was) before striking his first attack. This part was actually a little fun. If you took out the deadly curses, it was kind of just playful fighting. Harry seemed to agree as they went back and forth deflecting hits and parrying spells. Well, he was pretty sure it was Harry, anyways. His animagus smell said it was. It appeared he was disguised for the event, which Draco deeply appreciated.
.” He said firmly. It was then that Draco remembered Blaise’s mother was once married to the owner of Witch’s Weekly… and after he died, she assumed control.
“Mr. Malfoy, may I inquire as to what you and Mr. Longbottom seem so pleased about?” She asked, raising an eyebrow. Draco picked up the plant Neville showed him and cackled maniacally.
"Glasses!" Cassi agreed, "You would think they would have something for that, wouldn't they? Eyesight spells aren't a thing yet?"
“Darling, I don’t think that’s what he meant,” Daphne said gently and reached out to put a placating hand on her arm, “Just that there are so many muggleborns and more and more bloodtraitors breeding with them. It is hard to keep the lines pure,” she said, rubbing the side of her arm. “Nobody thinks you’re - nevermind,” she said. Theo scoffed. Immediately, the group turned to him.
“You dress well,” she greeted with a small smile. Draco scoffed and held out his arm, “I also did some research,” she added as she took it and began walking down the hall. “You did not tell me you were disowned.”
Plaintiff accused defendant of not controlling her cat (named Crookshanks) and allowing it to feed on the plaintiff's rat (named Scabbers). The evidence stands as follows - Scabbers is missing. Crookshanks has been said to hold past hostile behavior towards Scabbers. Ginger hair was found on the bed of the plaintiff along with blood on the sheets.
“My-? My invisibility cloak?” He repeated and Draco nodded. “Who? Dumbledore? Why would he need my cloak?” Harry asked. Draco shook his head. It didn’t make
“Say something else to me immediately because I don’t want the last words I ever hear to be that stupid.” Draco said. Harry made a face in return before walking over to try and pick Ginny up.
“Um, okay. Why?” He asked curiously. He wasn’t sure this was a good start to the conversation, but whatever. “Are you hurt?” He asked and Ginny bit her lip, wringing her hands together as she looked around. “Look, if this is about the monster then you have nothing to worry about. It goes after muggleborns.” He told her. Ginny flinched.
“You realize Ron and Lavender are probably going to date, right?” Zoe asked Sadie tiredly. There was still a note of amusement underneath whatever exhaustion was plaguing her.
"Okay," He said slowly and then looked back towards the maze, "Do you think he put Harry's name in the goblet?" He asked. Dora shook her head.
,” Draco snorted and shook his head. “Everyone was saying they saw you and Cho at Madam Puddifoot’s. What happened?” He asked, genuinely curious.
"A... what? What is this man? What the Hell are you?" He asked as Jenkins appeared, eying the guns with interest. "Who the Hell do you think you're mugging?"
“You definitely had a crush on me back then,” he decided. Draco rolled his eyes. He couldn’t believe he had a crush on him now, quite frankly. Somewhere down the road his standards had lowered drastically. The worst part was that he didn’t even care.
”Yes,” Draco said, ”Fortescue is the only one he doesn't know about. Though, I don't think he realized I overheard so I doubt he’ll connect it back to me.” he shrugged, ”Still. Proceed with caution.” he said and Moody nodded.
"I don't think it's time for that yet," he snorted and then did a double take, "Unless there is something
"Who what?" Hermione asked. Draco pursed his lips. He wasn't sure how much of this information was necessary to give. Especially since it was so personal to his godfather. Hermione waited.
“That’s where you’re wrong, professor,” Draco told him, “You treat us all like pawns who can’t understand this grand plan of yours. It gets people hurt. Well," He said, stepping forward and bringing out his own wand again to press it slightly into his chest, "I am not your pawn. You’re mine.”
Slughorn stared at him for a moment before giving a small hum of understanding. Draco rolled his eyes. Practiced hand. Whatever.
Luckily, Draco was smart. So when the DA assembled to go out on their newest ministry mission after taking care of Umbridge (yeah, Draco wasn’t going to get into the specifics of
Harry seemed to understand, eyes drifting towards the crumbled pieces of paper by his feet. Without another word he squeezed Draco’s shoulder before retreating towards the portrait hole. Draco watched him go before turning back towards the fire. He still needed to find Fleur and Gabrielle to tell them goodbye. Gabrielle, in particular, was downright
“Hey, can you give me a minute?” He asked, regaining his attention. “I just remembered I need to send a quick message.” He said and bolted before Theo could question his excuse too much. Following the small path next to the knocked over chair, he reached out until he felt silk cloth beneath his fingers. “What the
"Morning," Ron greeted when Harry finally sat down with a grunt, grabbing a few sausages before yawning.
“Hermione!” Ron said brightly as Draco launched from his seat. He raced over, pushing people aside to get to the other end of the hall.
want to keep it?" Harry asked, not bothering to voice the more brooding question. Draco knew who would pop up for him when he picked up that stone. He wasn't sure how he would handle it, but... "We don't have to decide right now." Harry said, squeezing his hand. Draco smiled back at him as Remus cleared his throat, giving them both an apologetic look.
“I’m fine,” he said again, though he couldn’t really decide who he was telling it to anymore, “It was a long time ago. I barely remember any of it.” He said. Sirius looked him over for a long time before nodding. “Tell me what you want to eat and we’ll find a way to send it to you… also, a bottle of Sleakeazy potion.” He added.
“Ow.” Harry whispered and gave a slight cry of pain as he went to move. Draco put a hand on his shoulder.
Funnily enough, Draco did end up attending Fleur and Bill’s wedding. To ruin it. Yeah. That part was a little disappointing. Especially because it looked like it would have been beautiful. The other Death Eaters kind of sprung the whole thing on him, but at least he got to see Fleur in her wedding dress. She looked stunning as she punched Avery so hard that his mask came off. Amazing.
times that Sirius Black is trying to kill you. Numerous. That means many. So why are you sneaking around so that he can kill you?” He asked, crossing his arms over his chest.
“Wonderful! I guess it's my lucky day!” She told her, cackling at her own (very bad) joke, and leaned over to kiss either side of Hermione’s cheeks. “I’ll get back to you on the charms thing!” She said and bolted up, “Tristam! Darling, don’t move. Your hair looks
"I see," Hermione hummed, letting go of the watch, "Well, we better leave soon then. We aren't exactly well-hidden," she sighed, looking around before grimacing at Mora's body and slowly putting down her breakfast, "Anybody have ideas as to where the next horcrux might-?" She began, but was cut off by an owl circling over them. Draco frowned. It was hard to tell given how high it was, but that almost looked like...
“Okay,” Harry said, stuffing a roll of bread in his mouth, “Let’s watch that one,” He said, taking another vial. Draco shook his head. Why couldn’t he eat like a human? It really was pathetic that he felt a wave of fondness hit him at the abhorrent lack of table manners.
what happens when a child is made under the influence of a love potion! That’s another reason to make it illegal - to keep there from being other Voldemorts out there.” He added fiercely. “She should be in Azkaban - YOU SHOULD BE IN AZKABAN!” Draco yelled when he saw Romilda peer back around the corner, “I’m going to break her neck-”
"I got upset," Harry informed him lamely. In response, Sirius grabbed a handful of sand and threw it at his face. He seemed too tired to do much more than that as he turned to where Dobby was playing in the water as the waves rose up to meet them.
“The other champion? From Beauxbatons?” He asked. Sirius gave a low whistle, “Okay, then. Congrats.”
“Riddikulus.” He said firmly, holding his wand out. Nothing happened. The boggart took another step out.
“I’m very glad you asked,” he said and let go of the mug so that it floated a bit away. “I’m not sure if you recall, but you and I once had a very interesting conversation about chess when you were eleven.” He said and it was then that Draco noticed Ron’s chess board sat between them.
So year 4 is done (: let’s talk about year 5 because I KNOW that y’all are gonna be mad at me and I’m gonna try and reassure you now that everything is gonna be fine. Just remember the real OOTP was a bit angsty with Harry being hormonal/filled with Voldemort rage/dealing with trauma. I mean, I’m still gonna be keeping the same vibe I’ve been keeping (not even war can stop Draco & Harry's snark and ignorant flirting), but also now we gotta start setting up some dominos on what new role Draco is gonna have in the war and stuff. And while we made him pretty chill so far we haven't quite made him battle ready. I mean, look at canon Draco. Smart af but my dude crumbled under the pressure. Imma need to iron that out of him unfortunately.
“Get the Hell away from there!” He snapped and a few of them immediately scrambled away from the door. Jugson blinked. “What do you think you’re doing?”
was the new DADA professor! That made so much more sense. Draco felt a stab of fondness at the announcement. He knew how badly Severus had wanted the job… even if he never outright said it. Ron and Harry gave exasperated claps of support, though they did look slightly bemused by how pleased the Slytherins were at the announcement. Zoe and Tristam had taken to giving shouts of encouragement while Sadie dramatically wiped a tear from her eye. Drama queens. All of them. They got even more rowdy when Slughorn was announced.
. Hermione was petrified in the hospital wing. All because of his father. All because… Draco hadn’t bothered to care all year long.
The world spun, everything growing disoriented as he tried to make sense of the figure in the hospital bed. Harry and Ron rushed forward, both giving their own reactions as Draco stood completely still. She was… not moving. Not in the way someone slept or even when they died, but… just… like a statue. He inched forward, fingers reaching out to brush over her skin.
Ron shouted, saving Harry from having to answer (though Draco was rather interested in hearing more about that) by turning to Draco, "Fuck
“Yes,” Hermione shot back hotly, “Imagine a poor muggleborn trying to escape a family wanting to burn them alive, only to be chased away by a murderous beast-”
"Excuse me," he told Andrea and pushed past to where the man was fiddling with a pile of weapons, "Hi. Draco Malfoy. Do you need a hand with that?" He asked, nodding to his bleeding leg. Trevor barely looked up from his work.
Still, Harry would probably eat them alive when he found out. The thought made Draco smile as he tossed his wand down and held up his hands. One of the wizards moved over and jerked both of their sleeves down, revealing their Dark Marks.
“Ah,” his father clicked his tongue, “Andromeda. I was wondering if I would see you today,” he sighed and Draco lowered his gaze. “Narcissa informed me you were… hijacking our son.”
"...remember when we spent an entire war with me being a third-wheel?" Harry called and Draco raised a hand.
“Who do you think I’ve gone out with?” Draco asked, not sure if he was upset or pleased by this development. Ron considered before ticking off names on his fingers.
.” He added with a small wave at where Harry was sitting. “I see you’ve made an appearance.” He added to where a new figure was on the opposite end of the room. That would probably be what Walburga was shouting about earlier.
She cried and zipped past Draco and Harry to launch herself at Molly. Draco watched with a small stab of envy as they all cooed over one another with small sobs of relief and hugging and… yeah. Just the normal, super gross family stuff. He wondered if his mother knew he almost died today. Were they still contacted about stuff like that?
“Uh, should I wake James?” He asked, gesturing to where another figure was also asleep on the couch. Draco almost laughed. He hadn’t noticed him at first. Mainly because his mind must have just assumed it was Harry (even if Harry was standing next to him). The man looked strikingly similar with the same messy hair, lean figure, and even the same chin and mouth. Ron knelt down to stare.
“Meda,” Ted’s voice called in the background, “Maybe you’re overreacting. The boy helped fight a snake and He-Who-Should-Not-Be-Named. I doubt Sirius is-”
“Neville and I were talking about it,” Draco shrugged, “He was saying some plants give you enhanced eyesight and then we got thinking if we could repair damaged - stop being a
“Why did you - oh,” he said, smile disappearing when McGonagall held up a dark red quill. “Did... Dumbledore give you one too?” He asked slowly. She nodded.
“Here, let me.” Draco said as he leaned over to grab the dishes. Andromeda smiled at him softly. “I don’t mind,” he added to Molly. “I think better when I do them by hand.” He added, stacking the plates. Hermione gave him a suspicious look - no doubt, she was wondering if he had ever volunteered to do a chore in his entire life. Harry still seemed too upset to really think too much on the matter as Draco walked into the kitchen.
Draco was watching another muggle movie - this time alone because Neville apparently had a life outside of him - when she walked in and plopped down next to him. They stayed silent for a few minutes.
Draco truly, utterly, completely and indefinitely adored Harry. He did. Really. He promised. He swore on Salazar. He would face Voldemort himself for him.
“Um, I’m meeting him there, Andromeda.” Draco said slowly as Hermione perked up slightly. Perhaps she sensed that Draco wanted to keep the pair as far away as humanly possible.
Draco swallowed. A giant was banging resolutely on some of the magic separating them from their opponents. They didn't have much time. Another shudder went over the castle.
Draco blinked, looking up from where he had been storming through the corridors to find a boy watching him. Slytherin… Of course. Draco rolled his eyes, reaching for his dignity clumsily as he straightened up to face him.
He yelped when he was almost immediately tripped by Harry yanking them to the side, “What the Hell are you - ? Stop!” He laughed when they continued to be pulled in a hundred different directions. He was positive this was all a ruse now. Harry was purposely trying to trip him at this point. In the end, he succeeded and Draco used all his strength to bring him down too.
“Draco,” Ted said gently and stood up, grimacing slightly as he did so. He looked awful. His hair had changed from golden blonde to practically red with dirt and blood. His face was scraped up, lip busted, and robes shredded. It hurt to look at him. “If I escape they’ll know it was you,” he said and sighed, “And even if you spun your miracle work… I don’t think I would get out of here.” He told him.
“Yes,” he said, looking up “After seeing your God awful dancing I think I immediately went through the five stages of grief.” He told him. A hint of a smile touched Harry’s lips as he shuffled forward.
“...oi. Malfoy! Are you coming or not?” A voice whispered and Draco turned back again. He would let Ron know that Harry was acting off so he could take care of it if Draco couldn’t grab him soon. “Malfo-”
"I - yes, of course," he managed, absolutely delighted by the idea. Remus grinned and him as Harry let the news settle in. He was going to be a godfather. He had never really thought too far into the future to imagine kids or anything like that. It felt to surreal... it felt surreal even now.
“Just a spell to protect that little piece of information and whatever else is said in this room now.”
“Daisy, once the house is in order, I want the elves to return to the properties they were originally assigned to before Dumbledore took them to Hogwarts. They can return back to their normal duties and if any of you want to change or do something else, let me know.”
“She has been getting one of the guards to sneak into Honeydukes to get her chocolates when she can manage it,” Neville said, smirking at Harry.
“Well, I guess the argument about me coming to the station with you boys is irrelevant now,” Lily said as she read the front page of the Daily Prophet.
Harry laughed as his owl turned her head and clacked her beak in what could only be described as annoyance.
“Your Highness, with all due respect, how many more tainted do you plan on bringing to our home?” Siofra asked.
This meant two things happened during that year, the first, Harry was treated extraordinarily well. He had enough food to eat, which was normal portion sizes for his age. It had the added bonus of giving Dudley proper amounts of food and the boy was soon as trim and fit as Harry was in his natural form. He had doctors visits, dental visits, trips to fun places and was told bedtime stories.
“Then let us go and see if just the sight of me can make an old man have a heart attack,” Lily said and moved, walking from the meeting room to the side chamber that held the portal that would take them from Elphyne to the human world.
“Yes, that would be for the best, for now,” Lily said. “Take her to see the Ivy; Sirius join us as soon as you get her settled, I need you by my side,” Lily added.
“Don’t worry so much Harry,” Neville said, “Draco already told him that he belonged to you and Draco.”
“They just should have done it when she first arrived, like the others,” Harry grumbled. “Now they are using her age as an excuse, which has nothing to do with it,” Harry said. “They should probably stop telling her that and tell her the real reason, that Uncle Frank just doesn’t want to risk her. Why I will never know since if he doesn’t change her she will die eventually.”
Harry vaguely heard Draco’s intake of breath as he tried to focus on what was going on around him, but it was getting harder and harder as the magic built. Even through closed eyes, he could see the magic, the electricity sparking between them. It was both peaceful and intense.
“Harry,” Neville whined, “you know that means nothing to us. Why should we care what happens to the Wizarding world, I would much rather stay here.”
“Harry,” Neville called and frowned when he got no answer. “Harry, wake up you lazy sod,” Neville called again as he struggled to get out of bed. With Nyx’s help, Neville made it to Harry’s bed and then proceeded to slap him gently across the face, “come on lazy bones, up you get.”
“Well, after we have cleaned this mess out, which won’t take long, by adding our blood, we will add yours and your mothers to give you equal control over the castle and its surroundings. It will also open the family part of the castle.”
Harry tried to sink down into his seat as everybody turned to stare at him, looks of disbelief on their faces, which quickly turned to fear as Caspian and Nyx stepped up behind him and placed a hand each on his shoulders.
“You felt it did you not?” Luna asked Caspian. “There was only one wizard that you paid attention to, that you actually flirted with, was there not?” Luna looked at the man, amusement shining in her eyes.
“She will be regretting her life choices soon enough,” Khidell growled, screwing up his copy of the paper and setting it on fire in his anger.
Then finally he felt a hand slide into his, causing a reaction, and grey eyes looked into his in surprise as magic sparked between them. Harry’s body arched as power swam through him, causing both of them to lift into the air.
“Harry, Neville come sit,” Lily said as she moved to guide them to a seat. “You remember Mivian and Aodh?”
“Nyx and Caspian might just be enough of a shock for people to not notice The-Boy-Who-Lived on the train,” Neville said frowning in disgust at using the name the Magical World had given his brother.
“Draco, you have to worry about your entire family being pricks. You shouldn’t have to worry about your boyfriend being a prick too. I can take care of that.” He said offhandedly. Unanimously, Hermione and Draco paused.
Unfortunately for him, his newfound ambitions didn’t mean much to his friends who still liked to storm around the common room like raging moose.
“I bet you could get something over it. Muggles sometimes put new tattoos over their old ones. Maybe magical marks are the same.” He mused, fingers tracing over the Dark Mark. Draco laughed. He wondered idly what he would get if he could do such a thing.
The rest of the day went a bit easier. He should really listen to Hermione more often. She had good ideas when it came to this stuff. He even felt moderately excited for quidditch tryouts.
“I would think anyone would be adverse to it,” Draco snapped back, “I mean, how likely is it that I would even need-”
Andromeda stumbled back, still jarred from Rudolphus' first hit, as the spell hit her in the back. Dora was rushing towards her.
“You won’t do it, will you? Because you know the Dark Lord values me. I’ve proven my worth and I will solidify it soon enough. He doesn’t have time to train another puppy. I can’t be a very good spy if I’m a blood lusting bitch like you, can I? So go ahead and do what you want. See what happens.” He said and waited. A beat of silence followed.
Draco laughed. He probably shouldn’t have given how miserable Harry looked, but Ron’s eyes were digging into him with a concerning amount of askance to them. He had written all his friends pretty consistently over the summer but… Ron was still a concern. He would worry about that more later.
“You’re already disowned. You don’t understand.” Theo said and Draco knew immediately it was a lie. Whatever the real reason was, it wasn’t disownment. He could tell the second Theo’s eyes flicked away from him.
“It’s true though,” he said and then gave Draco a small smile, “I’ll see you next year though, okay?”
“No, I want to. I do. I just… I don't want to kiss you for the first time when I’m sad and just had my ex-boyfriend shout at me for getting his brother killed.” He reasoned, “Ideally, I would be a lot happier and able to enjoy the whole thing a lot more.”
“You’ll always be my seeker.” Draco told her, fluttering his eyelashes dramatically. Ginny pretended to swoon. “A shame. I think you’re better than Harry.” He said. Harry flicked him off as he passed. “Oh, hey, cap.” He greeted.
He had served as a spy rather than a warrior. When he fought, he pretended to miss. When he killed, he killed in a shroud of discreet darkness. Never had he openly fought and meant harm to whomever he was fighting. He often thought the idea of it would be terrifying. He hadn't really liked dueling club or even those fake duels Harry used to have them in during the DA.
"Pansy already did," Blaise said, snatching the parchment back, "I didn't think it was safe to both go at the same time so we separated to make sure we weren't being tailed. Pansy was supposed to write with their new location, but I never heard anything."
According to Hermione, Harry’s fascination with his potions book was because of its previous owner who had kindly put a bunch of useful tricks and tips in there. Draco had to laugh at the revelation. Honestly, Harry was kind of a Slytherin in some ways. He never passed up an opportunity, did he? Hermione was far less amused by the whole ordeal.
“Very well,” she decided and tossed shimmering hair over her shoulder, “But you must point out this boyfriend of yours so I can be sure to make him very jealous.”
"I'm staying." Hermione said and Sirius turned to her, "I need to help Draco. Take the others back."
”So,” Draco said, sitting beside him, ”...I have to say it because it's going to bother me if I don't-”
“Don’t,” Draco shook his head, “I’m always getting in trouble nowadays. I can hardly blame you. I think my house has finally worn off on me.” He said. Theo laughed. “Thank you… for still talking to me. For getting them to talk to me.” He added with a nod towards some of the other Slytherins who were all loudly trying to explain the purpose of the party of a puzzled Hufflepuff.
“Yes and they listed your residence as the cupboard under the stairs,” Draco grumbled, “You should look into that.” He added, lying back down. Harry absently started tracing Draco’s constellation in the sky.
“An inferius?” He asked. Draco nodded. Harry thought it over. “I… that would be awful. Who was it?” He asked and Draco flinched. “Sorry. You don’t have to tell me.” Harry said quickly.
The girl hopped up, tossing dark hair over her shoulder as she gestured them to follow. Ron hesitated before simply picking up a nearly unconscious Hermione bridal style and following her towards where a small set of stairs led under one of the stone bridges. She waited until they joined her to speak again.
“I know technically I'm the one everyone is mad at right now and Harry is my friend, but, um, ” Draco nodded, “Can I be there when you tell him?” He asked, “Please? It would make me feel so much better.” He said. Sirius fixed him with exasperated eyes. No doubt he would be just as upset as his godson over the new arrangement. Draco would make sure Severus at least knew to take it seriously.
