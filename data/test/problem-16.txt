He felt Harry shake his head. "No. It wasn't as bad as before. But somehow... I didn't want to be alone."
The two men in bed jump violently, turning around scrambling to cover themselves with the blanket.
. What was that? With red cheeks the blonde looked to the ground. He felt so terribly exposed and vulnerable. What was he doing here? It was obvious that it was an exciting flirt for Harry and nothing more. Draco felt hot tears rise in his eyes and pinched his lips tightly.
The blonde cleared his throat. "Um, I was just admiring your bruises, especially here on the left ribs. Very nice pattern."
“So, how come that you wanna try it then?”, Harry whispered in Draco’s soft skin and felt the other man’s bollocks tightening against his lips.
Harry turned on his stomach now, eyes hungrily fixed on Draco’s not-so-soft-anymore cock. “But you like it, when I fuck you, don’t you?”, he growled deep in his throat.
"I'm sorry!," both said with one voice.
Yoga! Yoga and wine would calm his nerves. He poured himself half a glass of chilled Chardonnay and changed his tight cloth trousers and his button-up shirt to a yoga leggings and a soft T-shirt. Routinely he went through his exercises, bent himself, breathed, stretched his back, balanced, relaxed, sweated - and occasionally sipped on his glass.
Incoherent mumble and pleas fall from Draco’s plump lips. He feels Harry’s thick cock pressing against his lubed hole and his mouth falls open in a silent cry as he gets filled inch by inch.
Harry rubbed his tired face and finally seemed to back down. "All right. But I sleep on the couch!"
"Well, I better be going. I really didn't want to disturb you. I just wanted to apologize to you and thank you for your help, Draco."
Draco suddenly thought of something. "What about the little Weasley-girl?"
The black-haired man frowned. His eyes twinkled. "But...?" he asked and Draco thought he heard something like hope from his quiet voice.
So Draco took a shower and sighed with relief as the hot water ran down his body. Suddenly he remembered that just a few hours ago he had heard a similar sound coming out of Potter's mouth. And again his penis rewarded him with the same reaction, it twitched slightly.
so..." Draco rubbed his neck and let himself sink to the edge of the bed. "Have you slept until now?"
"What do you want?" Draco shouted gruffly through the door.
“But that’s – no – please, Pansy, you can’t be serious.”
Suddenly a loud scream woke him. Draco startled as if bitten by a huge tarantula and puffed out a wheeze. The fire in the fireplace was almost extinguished, only a faint glow illuminated the room, but Draco saw exactly what had awakened him. Or rather, who. Harry sat crouched in the large armchair, whimpering and moaning. His whole body trembled with fear and he had his muscular arms crossed in front of his chest.
Harry followed Draco up the narrow staircase, struggling to keep his hands off the firm butt, wiggling right in front of his nose.
When Pansy practically jumped at him, grasping his arm, Draco knew, that Harry had left his place in front of the bar.
Draco quickly went to Potter's other side and slightly bent his knees to put Potter's arm over his shoulders. He felt the warm body hanging close to his own and smelled a tangy perfume (which he liked far too much).
"Thought you'd know each other," Anthony remarked with a clearly curious undertone in his voice.
this summer. Like any 15-year-old would do. But of course, I had all this gay porn in mind. And all these asses being fucked. And these guys really seemed to like it.”
"Malfoy?! What are you doing here?"
Draco watched the black haired man take off his robe and unbutton his shirt. A tanned, muscular chest was revealed, a light oval was visible in the middle of the smooth skin, where the Horcrux had burned in (of course Draco knew the story, he was not living behind the moon). The young Auror winced a little as he stretched his arms to strip the shirt and again Draco could not help the scornful commentary:
? How dare you say – “
But the Auror was emotionally in a bad condition. He was a nervous wreck and still so anxious that Draco had to send Anthony to get the sleeping potion (which was actually his specialty), because Harry whimpered and trembled even more when the blonde man got up or otherwise moved away from him.
Simultaneously they pulled away and blinked in amazement.
It was certainly not easy for him to regain a foothold in the magical community. He was a Malfoy, a former Death Eater, not uninvolved in the suffering of many. But Draco fought. He fought and cried and fought on. It was tiring and exhausting, but in the meantime he had found a second family in St. Mungo. One who loved and admired him for what he did now. For his skill in dealing with patients, his enormous knowledge of healing potions and tinctures, his sensitivity and his charm and wit.
The blonde looked down briefly, but his patient was still fast asleep.
angle to hit his husband’s prostate over and over again.
“Oh, look at you”, I crooned.
So now it all starts...
“RON?”, he shouted booming, his own head protesting at the harsh sound.
“You’re very welcome. But now it’s my turn!”
Draco grinned. “My boss’s a wanker. So just go ahead and grab a beer or two.” Ron laughed. “I’ll be back around 6 p.m. My colleagues will arrive at 6:30 p.m. and we’ll open at 7 p.m., alright?”
, it just feels
And then it began right away. Draco didn't have a minute to catch his breath in the first three hours. In the emergency room all urgent cases first came together, witches and wizards were treated until they could be handed over to other wards or, in less dramatic cases, sent home. The emergency room was divided into a reception area and 6 small treatment rooms, each staffed with 2 healers working day and night shifts. At the back there was an operating room where urgent operations could be performed if it would have taken too long to send the patients to the appropriate ward.
“Thanks, baby!” Harry rolled his eyes, which earned him a swat on his chest. “I just wanted to try? Of course, I didn’t know a thing about lube and prepping and stuff. Since you can imagine, I never really had ‘the talk’, especially not about gay sex! So…”
The green eyes of the Auror flickered to Draco's face. A shiver went through him.
"Ooohh!" he moaned loudly as the buzzing stick slid into its moist hole and set his inside into vibration. Draco Malfoy was definitely not quiet in bed. And it didn't matter if he was with someone or satisfying himself. These noises made him just incredibly horny. Best if they came from someone else, but even his own lustful sounds aroused him immensely.
A low and throaty moan escaped Harry’s lips and he bent his head back when Draco moved down to kiss his neck and chest. “Hmm, this is nice” he hummed, and he felt the blonde smirk against his chest, cheekily twisting a hard nipple between his fingers.
His patient rolled his eyes. With his stool Draco rolled to the other side of the stretcher to look at Potter's back. Involuntarily he whistled quietly through his teeth. Shocked at himself, he opened his eyes, what Potter of course couldn't see.
Harry's voice was rough and trembled with effort. Even though it didn't seem possible, he took on even more speed and banged me so hard, that his balls beat violently against my firm bottom.
"And why did you send me away then?" Draco asked and hoped that his voice sounded as cold and indifferent as he had planned. But he wasn't sure if he succeeded.
Ron grinned. “You think he’s hot, don’t you?”
“Please, daddy”, I whispered seductively.
The deep cough that followed, however, belied his statement.
In the colourful light on stage, Harry just looked…
“He’s just gone, along with his clothes and his wand! Oh god, oh god. What are we gonna
"Well, then let's just get it over with, shall we," he murmured.
! First, you wouldn't survive 10 minutes in the emergency room and second, you don't have to interfere when I do my job, which I'm
?" Draco laughed and Anthony also snorted in disbelief.
"Oh, God, yes! Harry, fuck... I'm..."
“Uhm…” Harry felt his cheeks get hot again.
Shortly afterwards he was carefully lowered into the soft bed and let himself sink onto the pillow, completely exhausted.
He heard a spitting sound and something wet wiping against his fluttering opening. Then he heard Harrys belt and zipper, another spitting sound and finally – finally! – Harry’s huge cock found his way between Draco’s cheeks and in his saliva-lubed hole.
grade, right?”
Quickly he took another sip of water from his bottle and locked his belongings in his new locker. Then he took a deep breath and stepped into the hallway with a determined and polite smile.
[THE END]
“By the way”, Draco snarled, now completely missing the tone of worry in his voice, after finding out, that Harry wasn’t seriously injured. “Weren’t you supposed to have better reflexes? I mean – being an
Pansy turns back to the hallway and shrieks: “Draco Lucius Malfoy, where the
Harry stood at the stove in jeans and a dark blue T-shirt. He turned when he heard the kitchen door.
"Shut up,
"Left, but I fixed it already."
"How did you know it was poison?" asked one of his colleagues. "At first I thought it was his appendix or something!
"Harry, come on. It’s okay, you don't need to be afraid. It's just a dream, a bad dream."
"Shit, nnghaa," he cursed and moaned.
Staggering slightly, Harry took of his heavy boots and hung his cloak into the wardrobe. On his socks he sneaked into the living room and his tired face turned into a loving smile as he saw his boyfriend. Sleeping on the couch next to a crackling fire, hair tousled and soft, face relaxed and peaceful, Draco lay on his back. His head was tilted to one side, resting on a big cushion and he held a book still clutched in his slender hands. Harry’s heart felt warm and light in his chest, just looking at the person he loved the most.
Draco starred suspiciously at the large clock on the wall. This thing wasn’t working, right? It had to be broken! How else would it be possible for the hands to run in slow motion? It was 3:14 p.m. for at least 20 minutes! Draco supressed an annoyed groan and tried to focus his attention back to the professor down at the foot of the lecture hall talking about round and pointed arches. Normally he loved his architecture studies, but the message he received a few minutes ago set him in a bad mood. Jake, the owner of the Black Lion, a famous punk rock pub, where Draco worked in order to cover his living, once again decided only to show up in the evening and leave the hard work to Draco. That meant, that immediately when the lecture ended at 3:30 p.m. he had to head to Shoreditch to open the club for tonight’s live band and prepare the bar for a busy Friday night.
Harry stopped for a second before pulling out again and thrusting back in. “Sh, baby boy. You know how much I love your filthy mouth, but you have to be silent. Can you do that for me?”
"Merlin, you are a pain in the ass!" The blonde swung the door open and stopped in the door frame. "And you look pretty shitty," he remarked.
Trembling, the black-haired man took a deep breath. "I am so sorry..."
With a spell the healer fetched pillows and blankets from the couch. In the meantime Harry had climbed into his bed and curled up on his side. Draco shoved the pillow under his head and spread the blanket over him.
Harry moved closer and let Draco pull him into a hug. Draco stroked his hair and inhaled the fresh smell of shampoo.
I opened the door to our room and my cock twitched inside my pants. And this time not because he has called me baby. Harry was naked. Well except for his black boxer briefs, but with the way he was bent over, that piece of thin fabric didn’t really make a difference. The sight of his muscular thighs and his round, firm ass made me bite my lip.
The rest of tonight’s team arrived in the next half of an hour, Pansy already talking about the good-looking boys she saw outside the pub drinking beer in the moment she joined Draco behind the bar.
With a soft crack the broken bone settled back again and Potter moaned softly. No, Draco certainly didn't shiver at that sound!
"Malfoy, Draco!"
"Draco, you really have to sleep now," whispered the black haired man and Draco knew he was right.
A little wistfully Draco released the embrace. Harry's body against his had just felt good.
Draco was dancing. He was in fact dancing like a maniac. His arms in the air, twirling around to the beats of a song Harry could even hear through the closed door, he mostly reminded him of Luna. Just dancing. Just dancing and not caring about anything in the world. Just dancing because he was happy, and he felt like it. Harry’s heart throbbed in his chest, the warm feeling of love spreading in his stomach as he watched his boyfriend hop around in his tiny shop.
Draco sighed deeply and ran his hand through his fair hair, "We both know what it's like to be scared – scared to death. And I know exactly what it's like when you can't tell anyone, when there's nobody there to listen to you... Well..." He let the word float vaguely in the room.
Harry looked as if he had just noticed it for the first time. "Oh, right... So... we're like, um... like friends now?," he asked quietly.
“Yeah, hi. I’m Ron. That’s Seamus and Dean.” He introduced the two young men behind him, a tall guy with dark skin, short cut hair and one golden piercing in his ear and another in his nose and a smaller sturdy bloke with sandy brown hair.
"Harry, about last night..." the blonde started.
"And now that we're friends, I certainly won't leave you alone," Draco smiled.
And Harry means it. After all these years of enmity in school, they both came back after the war as different persons to go on the 8
Draco, the emergency room, and a surprising encounter.
"Oh, blondie, you smart little fellow," Anthony was already purring behind him.
Harry pouted way to cute. "I could ask you the same! After all, you grew up with house elves, while I had to cook every evening for my relatives - and that already at the age of 5".
Draco nodded. Granger stared at him in horror for a moment. Then she grabbed his hand.
!”, Draco whined, climbing on Harry’s lap and pressing a kiss to his forehead.
“Pansy, what’s going on?”
When Draco was finally done, he pondered. He was sweaty and hungry and hadn’t been home all day. Making a quick decision he called over to the red head.
"Shut up," Draco hissed back, but his voice somehow didn't want to sound as snarky as usual today.
“You’re so lucky, I’m generous. Right, baby boy?”
, baby.”
“I know”, Pansy whines.
“I don’t know…” His hands were back on his face. “The porn never showed it!”
"I cannot accept that, Draco. You've already done more than enough for me."
Harry grinned and Draco felt it lurching in his stomach. "If you say so..."
Pansy wakes up to gentle hands wrapping around her waist.
Draco didn't know what time it was. The alcohol and the stressful shift in St. Mungo had made him sleepy and he must have dozed off on the couch. The soothing crackle from the fireplace was all he could hear on the edge of his consciousness just before he dived into deeper spheres.
He shook Draco's hand, who was desperately trying not to jump up and down for joy.
"Well, there's nothing much to tell," Harry started and rubbed his broad chest. "We had a chase with those goddamn dealers we've been searching for weeks. Suddenly they ran into an old building, me and my team right behind, the guys rush up to the attic, out to the roof, we're shooting curses back and forth. Suddenly it there’s a loud crack under my feet and I crash through the rotten ceiling and land on the lower floor on my back."
Sniffling loudly Draco rubs his watering eyes and wipes his hair from his sweaty forehead. He tries to take deep breaths to calm himself down, but his clenching heart won’t stop hurting. Slowly Draco sits up and wraps the blanket around himself even though it isn’t cold. The streetlamp down the street outside the high window casts a dim orange light into the room and Draco looks around at the wild and colourful paintings Luna has drawn and the nightstand and bookshelf out of the same dark walnut wood. His clothes lie neatly folded on the comfy leather armchair together with is wand. Draco bites his lips. He thinks about the last conversation he and Harry had, just before he left.
Draco bit his lips and pushed his hips back against his husband. The endless pounding against his prostate brought him to the verge of an intense orgasm. So when Harry finally growled in his ear: “
So, Harry sank on his knees in front of his sleeping boyfriend, leaning forward and dipping the couch seat slightly, getting his face closer to Draco’s plump lips. Just as Harry was about to close his eyes, Draco opened his. Grey stared in green – and then Harry heard a loud high-pitched scream and felt a hot pain shooting through his nose. Harry twitched back and landed on his butt on the floor, groaning and pressing his hand on his throbbing nose. Speechless he glared at a gasping Draco.
"I happen to visit my best friend, who is apparently not well, you idiot," Weasley countered derogatorily.
As they stood up and Harry pulled his pants back on, he saw Draco shifting uncomfortable in his way to tight pants, his zipper clearly pressing against his sensitive cock.
And he spat the words at Draco as if it was a disgrace to work there. The blonde felt anger rising in his stomach, felt red spots forming on his chest. With a swing he turned around and drilled his long index finger into Weasley's chest.
! It was wonderful! It was amazing to kiss you and it felt so good and right and I want to do it again! Again and again and again!" The words were bubbling out of Draco breathlessly before he knew exactly what he had said.
“Okay, so. On the right is the stage, the electronics, lights etc. I'm not very good at this, but if you need help, let me know. I’m gonna set up the bar for tonight.”
Harry's low groaning and my high-pitched screams filled the room and almost drove me into madness of lust. I bit my lower lip to hold back the hot sperm, which was already gathering in my loins. I didn't want to come yet, didn't want it to be over. But I was
A wide smirk appears in Ron’s freckled face. “Of all the times, I caught you guys banging, this was by far my favourite!”
Next to healer Jones stood a tall man with broad shoulders and short brown hair. Unlike the Master healer, he wore the emblem of an advanced healer, only a few degrees above Draco, which calmed him down.
Harry snatches his wand from the night table. Experienced from years of Auror training and duty, he sneaks to the window, presses himself against the wall next to it and peaks around the corner. The bedside lamp provides only faint light, but Harry detects a hooded figure on the lawn. Another pebble hits the glass and startles Harry. He raises his wand, spells the window open and sticks his head outside, just as the hooded figure makes a swift movement.
"Fuck, what an asshole!"
He grabbed his college stuff and was just about to open the door, when it was ripped open. Draco startled and let out a high-pitched gasp, which he regretted again a second later when he saw who was now standing in front of him. A man, tall and muscular with tanned skin, his long hair tied up in a loose bun, 5-day stubble, leather jacket and sunglasses. Oh
"Could you perhaps do that again?" The question came almost shyly out of the blanket.
His eyes fell on the alarm clock on the nightstand. He hadn't slept long, it was just half past midday, but he felt
“I know”, Draco mumbles, snuggling closer to Harry’s warm body. After only a few more minutes, he’s fast asleep.
Placing light kisses against his inner thigh and the groin, Draco stilled his finger against the entrance and pushed.
“Poor baby. Let me hug you!”
"Are we back to last names then?" the former Gryffindor smiled and straightened his glasses again.
“Turn around, baby.”
Draco blushes. “Shut up.”
submissive…”
“Where were you?!”, Blaise and Ron asked in the same irritated tone.
"Um, yes," he stammered with a red head. "Very good, Harry."
"At least the Italian is gone", grumbled the Auror Benson, relieved. Until then he had watched helplessly as his colleague was treated. "Should I just come back tomorrow?"
“Not this time, baby”, Harry answered with a mischievous hint in his voice and Draco just knew that he referred to that one clash in the Hogwarts Express in 6
The blonde blinked twice in disbelief.
The other three tried to keep the young man's tense limbs steady with physical strength, but he had developed bear strength in his agony and screamed his head off.
"By all the gods, what?" Draco's knees trembled as he felt a sassy finger stroke light as a feather over his dripping glans.
Little sparks of heat blossomed everywhere Draco’s kissed and sucked and bit his skin and Harry felt himself relaxing deeper and deeper into the mattress. Slender fingers wrapped around his hard cock and Harry closed his eyes to just
Potter nodded and closed his eyes in concentration. As his chest did not lift any further, but remained so, Draco casted his spell and saw with satisfaction that the tense face of the former Gryffindor loosened. Relieved, he let out the air again and puffed deeply once.
"Oh, I'm listening! Did he come up with a good explanation why he chugs every liquid that shows up in his apartment?
"Since I rescued you and we realized that we were on the same side for good... And don't distract me. I asked you a question."
And then Harry pushes his finger in. Slowly, agonizingly slowly he pushes deeper and deeper.
"Does he still understand what we are saying?" Draco asked curiously, while Anthony scribbled diligently into the file. The blonde healer tried to catch Potter's gaze, who they had dropped on the stretcher in the meantime. With a dull gaze he swayed slightly back and forth and mumbled incessantly.
"Very quick thinking and good usage of the bezoar! And your potion was really excellent! I was very excited when I examined the antidote this morning. Arsenic is a very special poison, not everyone would have figured it out so quickly."
"Here, I don't know what that is or where he got it from, but he probably thought it was cherry juice or something. He drank it and immediately fell over with terrible cramps and vomited," Granger reported furiously fast.
If he had been told 10 years ago that he would be in the shower today masturbating to images of his school enemy, he would have declared him crazy. The old Malfoy would probably have jinxed them for this insolence. But now Draco stood under the hot, splashing water and tried to turn off his pushy penis. A voice pierced his head saying he was nuts and it was absolutely ridiculous and needy when he jerked off on two little encounters with Harry, no
There he stood. Still at the beginning of the street, staring up at all the lights and decorations. His big green eyes twinkled.
The black-haired man spreads Draco’s firm cheeks even more and dives his tongue into his hole. Draco’s eyes fly open. The stubble of the black beard is rough against his sensitive skin but
"Is there anything I can do to help?", the former Gryffindor asked when Draco slipped the spiced salmon into the pan.
“Oh, feels good…”, Harry moaned, feeling the slick slide. The double stimulation felt indeed nice and – “
"Draco... Draco... please!" Harry's voice was just a hoarse croak, his big hand groping for the front of Draco's shirt.
She led Draco, who was still pushing Harry in front of him, into a small free room along the corridor and handed him the obligatory paperwork. The blonde Slytherin sighed in relief as a bell rang and a patient from another room demanded Katherine's attention.
“Aaaanyway. I did some… research. On my cousin’s computer. When they were out one night. And I found stuff about sexualities and being gay and being bi. And it just fitted? It was like the explanation to my feelings I couldn’t even explain myself.”
"This is a 2012 Gris Pinot Grigio, of course it's
"Shh, it's about to end. You'll feel better soon. Just relax, everything will be fine..."
"You can go for a bite to eat, I only need a few minutes of sleep, then I feel better again," whispered the black-haired husky.
The story takes place about 6-7 years after the battle. Draco Malfoy, our favourite Slytherin is 24 years old now and has just finished his training as a healer in St. Mungo. The time after the war was not easy for him. 5 months he had sat in Askaban and waited for his hearing. Meanwhile his father was sentenced. And Draco could not blame the magical society. Even though he had not fought in the end and had remained rather forced in the ranks of the Death Eaters, his deeds had been so severe that he had been sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. Draco did not miss him very much. The change of heart that had brought him to his senses since he was 17 years old was also accompanied by a strong feeling of aversion to his father and his madness of power, pure blood and black magic.
“Fuck, you’re so hot, baby.”
to his luscious bottom that they looked like drawn onto his flawless creamy skin.
The blonde healer leapt up. "Yes, Sir?"
“Well, I figured out something was different with me, when I was about 15 or so. Boys seemed to be hot too, you know.”
The young Auror opposite him put his water glass, from which he was about to drink, down again and looked straight into his eyes. His gaze was hard to read and Draco had to look aside quickly to avoid getting lost in this bright emerald green.
Anger and exasperation flared up in Draco’s eyes. “But – you –!”
“Oh, love, believe me. I looooove you topping me, being strong and dominant”, Draco said in a sultry voice and Harry could feel the blonde’s soft cock twitching in anticipation, only inches from his face. He turned his head, gently kissing Draco’s ball sack, relishing in the shiver his actions created.
The day had been long. It had been a warm Sunday, in fact the first warm day since… well, forever! After a very frosty winter, the people now longed for the spring. And as soon as the temperature approached the 20°C mark, the people (magical and non-magical) poured out of their houses and flooded the shops and bistros and cafés of magical and non-magical London.
"Just as he pleases," he pressed out between trembling lips and rushed out.
“That dramatic bitch is going to kill me someday”, she complains, while putting on her black silk robes.
"I need your help, he's about to scream the hospital down," the young woman shouted.
"What is it, Harry? What should I do? What happened to you?"
A wave of relief streamed through Draco.
"I forgave you years ago, Harry."
“Do you really wanna know?”, Harry asked with this mischievous twinkle, that I love so much.
"Well I still have a small question...", came a cheeky voice from below.
Things are getting tough...
Draco’s silver-grey eyes became soft. “You’re such a sap, Potter”, he said gently, interlacing his fingers with Harry’s just next to the sugar basin. “And you’re changing subjects!”, he accused with his slender finger pointing accusingly at the dark-haired man.
Anthony and Draco both looked up and lifted an eyebrow.
Hermione smiled quietly. When she said goodbye, she turned around at the door and said: "He sends his regards, by the way".
Harry could only laugh breathlessly and nodded. He pulled his boyfriend closer, kissing him hard. Draco whined and pressed his pelvis against Harry’s leg. His erection felt hard and warm.
“I can’t believe you’re actually prepared!”, Harry growled back, burying his hand deep in Draco’s pants, feeling the end of a small plug between his cheeks.
“Yes?”, Harry answered carefully, not particularly liking the sweet tone.
It rang again.
Ron had come over by now and slumped into an armchair next to us. “There’s a notice on the board, that Hogsmeade will have a Christmas Market on this last weekend before the holidays.”
"Fuck it," he gasped. He had worked a lot and had been under a lot of stress, he deserved to relax a bit.
He just had to come now. He
“I have to taste that cute little ass of yours.”
“How can I make it up to you, daddy?” Draco’s voice was smooth and dark and full of promises and Harry felt the exciting spark of anticipation twinkling in his stomach, as Draco started the game.
And his words worked magic. I let go. My legs started to tremble and I nearly fell over as I felt something hot shooting through my veins. My cock twitched inside my pants as I came
"Well, we'll get him pepped up again," Katherine boasted.
"Talk to you! Would you
Draco’s voice was a bit breathless when he answered: “You know I am.” He moaned lightly, as Harry sucked on his neck. “And you know, I would never back down…”
Draco got up so quickly that his chair fell to the ground behind him, clattering. He threw himself at the smaller one and let their mouths crash against each other. Two hands clawed into the front of his shirt and Draco buried both hands in the black silky waves. Yesterday was nothing compared to today. The passion with which Harry pressed on him and hogged his lips and tongue took Draco's breath away. He gasped and dropped his head backwards and gave a slight groan as he felt Harry kissing his neck and sucking on the sensitive skin.
“More”, Draco gasps and looks down into Harry’s dark, lust blown eyes. “More, please, fuck,
to ignore.
were the same when we planned
"Miss Granger here reported that Mr. Potter's symptoms started when he ingested this juice," the nurse's voice sounded and Draco whirled around.
“Gods yes, Harry.” Draco moaned when the raven-haired man wrapped his lips around his cock. “Fuck, daddy, yes…”, he hissed.
“So, this is not about power play then?”, Harry asked between two hard sucks.
“Stop it already!”
"Yes, yes, yes..." Draco thought and internally crossed his fingers for himself.
"But first we will accommodate you in the emergency room. A healer on maternity leave left us and we urgently need a suitable follow-up. Well, well, boy, don't look so abashed. I wouldn't have chosen you for this position if I wouldn’t be sure that you could master that!”
I felt his dick grow hard in his pants.
“Now come to me, baby. I will help you with this.”
"There you are! I hope it was okay that I started already, I didn't know what you wanted to cook, but I wanted to return yesterday's favor".
“You looked so cute, baby”, Harry smirked.
“Why should I? You wake me up anyway.” Pansy giggles as Hermione tickles her neck. “And it’s much nicer, by the way.”
Harry couldn't take it any more either. His legs almost buckled and he clawed his fingernails into Draco's side as he came in with a deep moan in the blonde.
"Accio Bezoar," Draco shouted and caught the little black stone that flew out of one of the drawers with one hand.
Draco lowered his eyes and bit his lip. “I’m sorry, daddy.”
. That was one of the reasons he loved to work at the pub every fucking weekend (besides of the obscene amount of tips he made). Rock and punk pumping through his veins, flooding his head and making him forget all the stress in university, the pressure he felt because of his parents’ expectations, the strange glances on his tight jeans and the occasional nail polish. And Harry looked so freaking
. If you would kindly heal it?"
“Hmm morning, sweetheart”, she murmurs and presses back against her wife. “What time is it?”
They have been a couple ever since. Then
With a few steps of his long legs he was at the front door, opened - and immediately closed it again with a bang. Potter! Why was Harry Potter standing outside his door?
7 messages and 3 missed calls. Shit. The guys are going to give him hell for this. They’re supposed to play a show tonight in this pub in Shoreditch and they have agreed on meeting at 3 p.m. in their small studio to pack their stuff and be at the location at 4 p.m. to set up the stage and do a proper soundcheck. Not like this awful last time in Elephant and Castle…
Harry sighed again. “Obviously, I wanked
I felt the curious gazes of our friends hanging on my red cheeks.
"I'm in the kitchen," Harry tried again louder and of course had to cough again promptly.
made? “Oh, I’m just messing with you”, the blonde chuckled. “Don’t get your knickers in a twist.”
With three long strides, Harry was in front of him. Gently he pulled his hands away.
“Don’t”, Harry panted. “I wanna hear you!” Little kitten licks now danced over my hole and I nearly lost my mind.
Ron stopped in his tracks, bending over his bass guitar amplifier and looked up to Draco.
The side of the bed next to him was deserted and tidy. Draco had got up early this morning and had given Harry a kiss on the cheek to say goodbye. Nothing unusual on a Thursday. Draco's shifts in St. Mungo were always quite different, while Harry had reliably every Thursday off during his Auror apprenticeship, but had to work every other Saturday. This day of the week he used (if Draco wasn't free by chance) for the household. He did the weekly grocery shopping, cleaned, did laundry and cooked an elaborate dinner for his beloved. Of course they could have hired a house elf without any problems, but Harry thought it was silly. He would also be able to keep their small apartment in good condition himself.
Harry hid his face in his hands, his ears glowing out of embarrassment over his juvenile rashness. “I tried it with the handle of my brush. Without preparing or any lube.”
The old witch blushed and giggled like a schoolgirl when she left the room again. Draco felt the urge to puke. Potter was still such an arrogant crawler with everyone lying at his feet."So, Mr. Potter, tell me," Anthony asked him. He sat down on the stool while Draco was still leaning against the wall near the door.
“Of course, I know, love. I’ve been gay my whole life…”
“Yeah… And then when Ginny and I got together, naturally I was the one topping. I liked it, I liked being dominant. But you know Ginny!” Harry chuckled. “She’s definitely
"Yeah, I have no idea..." Draco mumbled in shame and Harry laughed. Somehow he hadn't thought that far.
"Can I go to him? Oh heavens, I need to let Ron know..." Granger mumbled excitedly.
He let Harry push him against the wall and both groaned simultaneously as their semi-hard erections touched through the fabric. Again they kissed breathlessly, their tongues wrestled and fought with each other. Draco shoved his hands under Harry's shirt and pulled it over his head. His hands felt warm strands of muscle that felt hard and soft at the same time. Harry also took off the blonde's shirt and threw it aside just as carelessly.
Granger thoughtfully wrinkled her forehead. "It could be that he thought I had brought him the juice. I usually bring him something I made myself. You know: jam, biscuits, cakes... Once I've brought him apple juice from apples from my parents' garden. It wouldn't be far-fetched to assume that he thought the bottle came from me."
It might have helped that shortly after opening
"Say,
It had not escaped the blonde man's attention that Anthony Young's face darkened briefly at the mention of his surname. But quickly the tall man put on a polite smile and the two shook hands.
“Hmm, don’t know”, Draco murmured, and his hands pulled a bit on Harry’s hair when he gasped as Harry licked a broad stripe over his sensitive skin. “Maybe it’s because I know how
"All right, Potter. You said you broke a rib. Which side?
My legs shook as I turned around and braced my arms against the wall.
“And we both know that you love me for it.”
With a flick of his wand, Draco turned on the wireless and started to clean the few bistro tables, rapt in memories of their weird first encounter. Without noticing, his hips started moving to the rhythms of a faster song.
Draco spoke to his boyfriend in a quiet, deep voice. A pain shot through his chest. He didn't want Harry to feel so bad. But after a few minutes the trembling slowly subsided and the black-haired young man let out a relieved sigh as the pain gradually subsided and was finally only dull to feel. He enjoyed Draco's slender fingers on his scalp and neck and leaned exhausted into the touches.
A soft smile played around Harry's full lips and he rubbed his bearded chin. "You're probably right."
And they come, only one second apart, and the world seems to slow down. Draco screams, nearly endlessly he shoots ropes of white onto his stomach. His arse clenches around Harry, who throws his head back and comes deep within his lover.
"Well, he is an Auror and hunts black wizards... So it's possible that they were after him", Anthony interjected.
"I'm bringing Harry...
"Heavens, fuck me already," Draco exhaled moaning.
“I thought I told you not to stay out that late”, Ron grumbled in that accusing voice that always reminded Harry of Ron’s mother Molly.
Oh, Draco couldn’t lie to himself any longer. He had fallen head over heels for this dork.
"Hmm," the other hummed and nibbled on Draco's lower lip.
"Stay here, I'll need you later," he shouted over his shoulder to Granger and had already stormed into treatment room No. 4.
"Weasley, I could ask you the same thing," Draco snarled.
“Yes”, I hissed. I was indeed naughty.
He flinched, because I caught him by surprise, but he chuckled. “Later, my sweet boy. But now, let’s get dressed!”
"It's true," the idiot behind him sounded. "That's not your ward, that's none of your business here. You don't even wear a robe! And you are just good enough for the
When Draco came home in the evening quite exhausted and wanted to open the door, he hesitated. With the key in his hand, he stopped in front of his apartment door and bit his lower lip. What if Harry wasn't there? If he regretted everything? The food, the conversations,
"Oh, much better!"
“You okay, baby?” His voice was soft and he pressed little kisses against my sweaty temple.
The next day at 8 a.m. there was a knock at the door of Treatment Room No. 4, as the two healers had just started working through the pile of paperwork on their desks. A small, plump man with a bushy grey beard stuck his head through the door. Draco immediately recognized the lime green robe and the golden badge on his chest. That was Edward Ferguson, the head healer of the department of poisoning by potions and poisonous plants! Draco's heart gave a jerk.
Draco even hadn't admitted it to himself until that moment, but it had to be true. This tingling, that he had already felt at their first encounter in St. Mungo, had been so real and had not subsided since then. Draco swallowed once and nodded tightly. Now Harry could joke about it, he would go through this with his head held high.
Draco had finally settled. Sure, he had his bigger and smaller problems with his past every so often, but he had survived. The strict, violent patriarchy of his father, the moods of his aunt Bellatrix, living with Death Eaters and the most powerful black wizard in recent history, and a war that still today frightened him in some nights bathed in sweat.
But Harry smiled slightly. "All right."
The black haired sighed. "I don't know either. We may have gone through the worst of all time together, but I'm starting to feel like I'm annoying them. I don't want to burden them so much with my problems anymore. They've really done enough for me already. Don't get me wrong, Hermione and Ron are my best friends and they would do anything for me, but sometimes..."
After starting the same sentence for the fifth time, he closed the book with a bang, grabbed his coat and left the apartment. A few minutes later he stood in front of the staff entrance, a door invisible to Muggles, and entered St. Mungo.
Draco nodded thoughtfully. He had thought something like that. Again he felt this subtle hint of pity rising in his stomach.
As Harry was through the door, Draco let himself fall back against the countertop and buried his head in his hands. Holy shit, this guy was everything he ever dreamed of! The tattoos, the beard, the messy hair bun… How could he possibly survive the night, listening to him playing guitar or drums or bass or whatever it was, that he was doing? Draco always had a thing for musicians, the way they seem to feel the music and rhythm, their hands working their instruments. And what if he was the singer? Damn, Draco had always had a special crush on the all the singers’ voices he had heard in his years in the Black Lion. But this one – Harry – was just a
Draco’s triumphant smile was wide. “Again?”
"Can I ask you a question?" Draco started.
"Yes, of course I can, but -"
The back door of the pub had opened and an older guy carrying two garbage bags stopped dead in his tracks, starring at them.
And he looked – Harry had no better way to describe it – like an angel. An angel right from hell. He was dressed all in black, wearing a loose tank top with “Nirvana” writing, that was cut so low under his arms, that Harry could see his bony rib cage. And his pants! Harry had to take a shaky breath in order to keep himself from moaning. Draco was wearing tight leather pants, which were clinging so
Even in the dim light that came out of his apartment, Draco could see the dark rings under Potter's eyes.
So it didn't suit him at all to be ill today. He simply decided to ignore his body. But to be honest, he had already noticed in the last two days that he was not quite fit. At the end of the day he had felt exhausted and yesterday he had had those dull headaches which were now getting worse and worse since waking up. Harry rubbed the cold glass of water over his temples and snuffled before he got up. Maybe a good shower would help. With his eyes closed, he stood under the hot water and let it run down his body. He was still slim, but due to more sport and training not as delicate as in his school days. His cramped neck muscles relaxed a little, but those annoying headaches didn't want to go away.
A damp sparkle appeared in the large emeralds.
“Don’t you dare come.”
Draco sat on Potter's hip, one leg on each side and pinned his chest with his forearm to the stretcher. He didn't care that he was in contact with sweat and vomit. His colleagues each took one leg and both arms to keep the Auror calm. Draco himself grabbed Harry's bearded jaw with a firm hand and squeezed to open his mouth. A violent blow to the back almost knocked him forward as Potter tore one leg loose and tried to tear to his chest in his seizure.
"Fuck, Potter!
Brushing his white-blond hair out of his forehead, Draco arrived in front of the Black Lion. A group of 3 guys around 24/25 years packed with instruments, amplifiers and backpacks already waited for him. Draco tried to pull himself together and not show his obvious annoyance.
Only when the other didn’t answer, Draco realised, that he hadn’t said any of this out loud. Deeply ashamed he cleared his throat and tried again. “Deathly Hallows?” Embarrassing.
"Why don't you take a sleeping potion?"
"You're heavy," he complained mattly after a few seconds.
A wolfish grin spread in this gorgeous bearded face. “How can you be sure I’m wearing any?”, Harry said in a low growl and Draco nearly fainted.
Harry smiled broadly. I loved this wide, cheerful grin, showing his white teeth in his dark 7-day-stubble. “Perfect. So, Ron and I find Neville and ask him if he wants to join, and baby, could you find Theo and Blaise?”
"Granger?," Draco asked in surprise.
Well, Draco thought, then Potter had bad luck. He really thought something had changed between them. In the moment Draco hadn't betrayed him to the Dark Lord in the Manor. In the moment Potter had rescued him from the fiendfyre. In the moment Draco's mother lied to the Dark Lord, protecting the chosen one. In the moment Draco had no longer taken Voldemort's side.
He had to stick this Bezoar in Harry's throat! Again he leaned on the Auror' s muscular chest, which was already soaked in sweat that and forcibly opened his jaw. With lightning speed Draco stuck the knobbly stone into his mouth and pressed the lips of the other man together again. At first nothing happened. Potter was still trembling and for a moment Draco was afraid he had done something wrong and made a mistake. But then under his body he noticed that the cramps of the dark-haired man subsided. Also the hoarse screaming became less and at the end he only whimpered softly, his eyes closed, his face still pale.
The healer placed his message next to Harry on the mattress, stroked the black-haired man's head again with a feather-light touch and then hurriedly left the house.
Harry’s eyes twinkled and he bit his lower lip, as though he was trying to hold back a spontaneous remark. Instead he said: “I just wanted to ask, if I could have a bottle of water for the stage? I always get a dry throat up there.”
“Of course, it’s me, you dimwit! Draco’s gone!”
Shocked, he opened his eyes and stared into equally surprised green eyes in front of him. Wait, hadn't Harry moved first?
The four healers immediately rushed towards the young man and began their treatment. The most experienced colleague took command and gave instructions. Anthony got a stretcher and they let Harry float on it to better examine him in the treatment room.
He bit his lower lip, letting his gaze wander over the other man’s body. Harry must have taken off his leather jacket, now showing trained, tattooed arms and a broad chest in a grey-black striped T-Shirt. His tight dark jeans were loosely tucked in a pair of worn black DocMartens boots. His gaze just stopped a second on Harrys crotch, wondering if he was really not wearing any pants underneath.
“Okay, I guess”, Harry murmured.
Anthony laughed: "Oh yes, he does in fact come here more often than I fancy. He may be a brilliant auror, but somehow he still manages to end up here in the emergency room over and over again."
" First of all we gave him a sleeping potion, maybe he will recover by himself. Otherwise you'll have to see how he is tomorrow. Maybe one of the mind healers has to come."
Draco's fingers trembled slightly as he put the key into the lock and unlocked it. It was quiet. No sound was heard. He went into the living room - empty. He went into the kitchen. Only a rinsed cup on the draining board of the sink indicated that someone had been there at all. Otherwise no sign of Harry.
"Thank you for saving him! Seriously..."
, I' m sorry... I didn't know..."
time.”
Draco didn't move. He stared at the knob, which he was still holding. This guy was really an outrage, by Salazar! Just to show up at his place like that... Where did he get his address from?
Draco nodded. "Thank you, Anthony."
“Okay, okay. Let me think”, Hermione frowns.
He looked down in these big eyes, shining like a dark, icy lake.
He grimaced and raised his chin. "Charming as ever. May I come in?"
“The guy I nearly ran over?”, Harry called back. “This blonde handsome boy with ridiculously long legs and an arse to
"All right, all right. Watch out, could slightly hurt. 1, 2, 3!“
I shrugged, not even bothering to open my eyes. I just felt so warm and comfortable. How should I be in the mood to go out in the fucking snow and the freezing wind, when instead I could cuddle with Harry all day long. Well except for lessons. And meals. And studying time in the library. And when I went to the loo. But else?
Harry’s hands searched for Draco’s slender fingers, interlacing them with his. Laying back on the soft mattress, he pulled Draco on top of him. The other man’s skin was warm and shone white in the bright sunlight. Harry felt his cock twitching when their hips met, soft skin touching. Slowly he rolled his hips and Draco panted into the kiss, pressing his pelvis down, increasing the friction between them.
“Oh god, Harry!”, I breathed.
"Harry Potter? Wow!" With unconcealed curiosity, Katherine looked more closely at the man on the stretcher. "Well, that's a treat..."
And I'm dying to hear, what you guys think (Yes, I'm a whore for your appreciation)
The blonde man told him to proceed quickly with a hand gesture. "I'm all ears."
His finger disappeared and was immediately replaced with something hard and thin. Wait. Red and white. The candy canes he had bought.
"Well, until you gave me the potion to sleep. All I know is that I woke up sometime in a hospital room."
“You know”, Harry panted, forcing Draco’s fly open with one hand, while licking and biting his husband’s long neck. “I really wanted to do this back then.”
Harry laughed bitterly and shrugged his shoulders. "You said yourself, I look like shit. I haven't slept in three days. It's okay during the day, but it still comes back at night." Lost in thought he rubbed his upper arm. "But I think it’s getting better."
in his cute striped t-shirt.
(Did you know, that angst is originally a german word? Thanks to my native language for all the pain we feel and the tears we shed... Germany, huh.. A country full of optimists...)
"I know that your specialty is potions and poisonings," explained the head of the training program.
”, Pansy whines again.
? Yuck.
They don’t fuck today.
They decided that Harry should take the potion here in the E.R. and take him to the ward afterwards as it seemed impossible in his condition to move him out of this room. The two healers didn't want to risk another seizure. After endless persuasion from Draco, Harry finally swallowed the potion and one minute later he slept soundly.
Draco Malfoy. The acquitted Death Eater.
"Malfoy, come on," called Potter's dark voice. "Open the damn door."
“Harry, please.”
. His tanned skin glowed in all the stages of the rainbow; the muscles of his arms flexed around the e-guitar he was holding, and even from where Draco was standing, all the way across the pub behind the busy bar, Harry’s eyes seemed to sparkle.
“I do”, Harry stated wholeheartedly.
I feel, when you do it to me. I wouldn’t want you to miss it!”
"I'm relatively sure it was arsenic. It smells pretty characteristic and causes exactly the same symptoms as Potter had. Vomiting, cramps, cold sweats, circulatory failure... If he drank a little more, he would be dead now. I have to go to the lab and see if I'm right. Then I can brew him a matching antidote."
"Fuck, fuck, yes!" My moaning and screaming was ringing in my own ears.
– now!”, Draco moaned, and Harry hummed his consent against Draco’s swollen balls.
“You taste so good, Draco. Fuck…”
“Shh, love, shh. You can come if you want. Daddy got you.”
“Come for me, baby! I want you to come! Just from my hard cock in your perfect little ass!"
to blush over a joke
Harry could just stare at his long, elegant neck and wonder how it might feel to suck a purple mark in this silky white skin.
And with a friendly wink, he disappeared again.
to! His trembling hand reached for his cock and with only 2, 3 fast pumping movements he fell over the edge and moaned his orgasm out off his lungs. His legs trembled as hot cum shot at his pale chest and the vibrator still twitched in his ass and provoked his over-excited body even more. Draco lasted a few more seconds, then he pulled the vibrator out of his ass with a deep groan. He gasped for air, tried to calm his hammering heart and let the aftershocks of his grandiose orgasm ripple through him.
“You look gorgeous, love”, Draco murmured between two sucks. “Ready?”
Potter winked at her. "You know I don't feel well if I don't nibble on your wonderful cookies at least once a month, Gladys."
Rolling is eyes, Draco finally waved his wand, to stop the bleeding and vanish the blood from Harrys face and shirt. Carefully dabbing with his thump, he wiped at the small amount of blood that still clung to Harry’s beard.
You called for chapter 2 and your wish is my command lmao
“Shit, I’m sorry!”, the man said equally startled in a smooth low voice and Draco had to be careful not to drool.
“I know, I know”, Draco whined. "It’s just – I don’t know!”
Okay, Draco couldn't possibly tell the truth. He couldn't possibly say that he thought the sight of the defined, smooth back with an offensively attractive dragon tattoo on the right shoulder was absolutely hot.
Harry moves his way further down and Draco’s breath hitches as strong hands caress his torso, run over his chest, pinch his nipples until they’re hard. Draco arches his back, trying to press himself even closer to Harry’s teasing touch. Soft whimpers escape his lips, as Harry whispers sweet nothings against his flat stomach. His tongue trails across the fine blonde hairs, leading from his belly button into his sweatpants.
"Oh my, chills too," Draco muttered more to himself and laid his slender hand soothingly on Harry's reddened cheek.
Draco supported Harry's heavy head, felt the sweaty hair and shook his head in disbelief again. His boyfriend had been on his feet all day like that? He would really have to have a serious word with him if he was all right again.
"You are such a stubborn git, Potter," Draco grumbled lovingly and dipped the washcloth back into the cold water.
?”, Harry asked fondly.
“And weren’t you the one, who begged me on his knees to comply with this weird muggle superstition to spend the last night before the wedding apart from each other, just because you’ve seen this in a movie last month?”
The young healer bit his lower lip and finally pulled himself together. "If you have no plans, you can stay for dinner." He shrugged his shoulder towards the stove, where his culinary skills had meanwhile become cold. "I can do some more. That is, only if you like."
THE END ♥
“Don’t stop”, I whined, pushing my head back into Harry’s massaging fingers.
, I would say, you fell for one of them!”, Draco snapped sarcastically, mixing a Gin and Tonic.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Okay, then I'll make us a little something and maybe... maybe we can talk a bit?" His stomach suddenly felt very weak.
Together they step up the staircase and disappear in the bedroom.
Harry was silent at first, then something seemed to strike him. "Since when do you call Hermione by her first name?," he asked in surprise.
"Gladys, when I see you, I feel much better immediately!”
"Yes, baby?" he whispered back.
Potter tried and promptly coughed again, his face disorted in pain. He pressed his hand against the freshly repaired rib and gasped in pain. Something was stirring in Draco's stomach. A tiny twinkle only... Was that...
Draco's moaning grew louder as he pressed against this little bundle of nerves up his ass and twitched his hip forward. Quickly he increased the vibrations to a fast and violent rhythm and exhaled a deep growl as the feeling roared like electric shocks through his now sweat-covered body. He turned on his back again and pressed his butt against the mattress to drill the stick even deeper. The noises escaping his mouth increased into a hoarse scream, always to the beat of the buzzing against his already aroused prostate. His hands clawed into the sheets, he bent his back, drilled his heels into the bed and gasped and screamed loudly until he couldn't stand it any longer.
“Right”, Hermione mumbles. “Do you think he got cold feet?”
Draco finally found the right key and helped the boys carrying their equipment into the gloomy bar room.
Have fun, you naughty people!
A finger lay under his pointed chin and gently lifted his head. Draco looked into this beautiful face and tensed his shoulders, getting ready for the inevitable rejection.
[AWW, THIS IS SO CHEESY SKSKS - AND IT'S NOT. THE. END!]
“Fuck, baby! You’re so good for daddy…”
Draco laid one of his cool hands on the young man's bearded cheek. "Harry, look at me."
Well,
I nodded fervently.
Harry sighed and tried again to open his eyes, this time succeeding. Tremendously slow he sat up, wincing at the sparks of pain in his head. After a few calming breaths Harry decided, that he didn’t have to puke. Instead he reached for the bottle of water on his nightstand and drank in greedy gulps. The water refreshed his dry mouth and took the edge off his headache immediately. With a soft satisfied groan, he sank against the headboard of his bed and blinked at the clock on the wall opposite. It was 3:32 p.m. The residual alcohol pumped lazily through his veins and Harry blinked again. FUCK! It was already after 3 p.m.!
Hermine Granger was still waiting in the emergency room waiting area. She nervously kneaded her fingers and got up as soon as she saw Draco coming.
"I’m all ears?" Draco's usual snarling had become surprisingly gentle at the sight of the man in front of him.
“And just because you didn’t want to be the only one
Harry swirled his hot tongue around his sensitive glans and Draco’s eyes fluttered shut. He let his head drop heavy against the brick wall behind him, scratching his hands against the rough stone in his need for something –
“Daddy, take me home.”
“Bloody hell!”
And Harry was simply stunned. That was – by far – the most beautiful man, he has ever seen. He gulped. “Uhm, hi.”, he answered and heard Seamus giggle behind him.
Long fingers crossed in Harry’s neck, pulling his head down. Soft lips came near his ears and a gush of warm breath let Harry shiver. “I wanna try to touch your ass…”
“Just a little finger!”
Finally, his lecture was over! Draco packed up his notes and his MacBook, said goodbye to Blaise, who just woke up from his dozy mid-lecture-nap and left the building of the Architectural Association School Of Architecture on Bedford Square. He had to hurry, the band would arrive at 4 p.m. and the underground was packed with commuters and tourists.
“You can…”, Harry hummed, his eyes still closed.
"Go into the kitchen on the left," he instructed him.
"I don't think much of taking medicine all the time." Harry chuckled briefly when he saw Draco rolling his eyes.
There it was again!
Finally Draco took a heart. "I'm glad nothing worse has happened and Potter is back on track."
"You... so you can remember everything from that night?" he asked and thought with horror about how he had undressed Potter... Harry... and stroked his cheek!
instruments.” Harry rolled his eyes. “And he was actually quite talkative. Until you showed up.” Ron’s eyes were sparkling with amusement. “He just went home to take a shower and eat something before his shift tonight. So tonight, you’ll get a pretty, freshly showered, blonde…”
Draco looked down at his chest and knew what Harry meant. He had got used to it long ago and had come to terms with it in the meantime, although they were a painful memento of his past, which he wanted to leave behind forever. But Harry saw these scars for the first time. Although it had been him who had inflicted them in a flooded girls' toilet in 6th grade. Fine white lines were drawn all over Draco's upper body and shimmered slightly in the light.
The young healer let the sleeping man float on a mobile stretcher and pushed him through the many hallways and corridors to the ward for curse damage. Draco didn't know why, but somehow he felt he had to take care of Harry himself. How he had clung to him earlier... As if (of all things)
! Annoyed, he took a big sip of water from his glass of the nightstand to soothe his dry sore throat. Why today, of all days? He had so much to do! He wanted to change the beds, then turn on the washing machine, go shopping in time, hang up the laundry, replant the big flowerpot on the small balcony, clean the kitchen and bathroom and then vacuum. Then he had to start preparing for dinner.
“Hi”, he said, aiming for his usual confident and flirty voice. “What can I do for you?”
"We haven't tried it yet," Benson grumbled. "I was glad we got him here at all! Do you think he'll be all right?", he turned to the two healers with concern.
Draco felt a warm hand on his cheek and drops on his face that he couldn't possibly tell if it was tears or water from the shower.
.”, Draco came in the blink of an eye, biting his own hand to muffle his screaming. He felt Harry’s hot breath in his neck and his own hot cum shooting in thick ropes against the brick wall. After a few more thrusts, Harry’s hips came to a stuttering halt and he buried his head between Draco’s shoulder and neck, breathing heavily through his own orgasm.
And as his boss, Jake, entered the stage, announcing tonight’s live band “The Deathly Hallows” and the crowd cheered and clapped, Draco’s heart skipped a beat.
"Then do it ..."
Panting and trembling Draco wakes up. Harry. Harry. Harry. Just one word floods through his numb brain, still struggling to escape the cold of the nightmare. Harry. Draco curls his slender body like a cat, feels the cold sweat on his chest and neck. Harry. He’s not there. He’s alone. He can’t sleep, when he’s alone. He even has nightmares
“I’ll take an ale, please. Oh, and your number.”
"It was actually as I had thought. He found the bottle on the kitchen counter, I was in the toilet, he thought I brought the juice, so he drank it."
"I don't know, he caught some curse and we don't know what it was! And more importantly -"
The end is near... It's been a bumpy ride and I'm so grateful for each of you who read it and left Kudos or a Comment below :)
his best friend!
“Sure.”
“Do you think it’s broken?”, Draco asked, and bit his lower lip in concern.
"Draco, I love you."
"Welcome back," he said smugly.
“Guys, I’m so so
" Gee, Malfoy, now spit it out, will you?"
, I need you so bad.”
“Do what?” Draco asked breathlessly, digging his hands in Harry’s dark hair.
"You have to be good if you don't want to be beaten up every night," Harry returned in an undertone of bitterness.
"Aargh, fuck, yes," he screamed. Three fingers were now pushing into his wet hole and pushed deeper and deeper until they hit his prostate. Draco closed his eyes and screamed. With fast movements Harry widened Draco's tight hole, who almost lost its mind when he also noticed the black haired guy biting his butt tenderly.
"So, and now the lungs. They got quite compressed at your fall. I will relieve them again. Just imagine it, like a somewhat limp balloon that you blow up again, yeah?"
Harry willed himself to stay relaxed, knowing that it would be more comfortable that way.
"Uuuhhnnngg, daddy..." I moaned and jerked. I couldn't think anymore, I needed more and I needed it
“Should we ask the others to come too?”, Harry asked, already standing up and sauntering towards the black board to read the notice himself.
“Uhm, because it’s a bloody good feeling?”
Draco sat up, his hard dick bobbing in his lap. “Okay then.” He nodded repeatedly to assure himself. “We gonna go with green, yellow and red, is that fine for you?”
“Whoa, would you stop it?”, Harry laughed and caught Draco’s fists mid-air, so he wouldn’t punch him again. “I didn’t lie to you. You know, I’ll never do. I only told you that I hadn’t another man’s cock in my ass…”
The two men sat across from each other at the kitchen table. They could hardly have looked more different. One was long and slender with neat light blond hair and bright skin, his long fingers interlocked and his back stretched; the other smaller and more muscular with tangled black streaks and a bronze complexion, sunken on his chair, his head lowered.
Harry chuckled. “I know, love. And now you’ll get your reward.”
"It's just my job. But now you have to tell me what happened, right? Everything you know!
“Oh, daddy. What you’re going to do to me?”, I asked in fake innocence. Nothing about me is innocent.
"You learn fast, Blondie."
”, Harry playfully pouted.
“Apology accepted?”, Draco asked and cuddled closer to Harry. He leaned to his muscular boyfriend, shamelessly rubbing his enormous bulge in his jeans against Harry’s hip, clearly begging for some release himself.
"Not quite, I woke up at 10 am or so and read your message. I'm really sorry I kept you awake so long yesterday, by the way."
"I would like to make a toast," Draco said smilingly and felt slightly tipsy.
"I'm sorry that I sent you away. Especially after everything you had done for me. I know for a fact that you saved me with the bezoar and your antidote. And I also know exactly how you were there for me in my panic attacks and hallucinations."
So, Draco had had a long Sunday selling ice cream to smiling wizards and witches, strolling up and down Diagon Alley, enjoying the warm sunlight. And now his back and feet hurt from all the standing, running and carrying.
And with these words he closed his eyes and leaned forward. Immediately he felt the beard on his chin and directly after a pair of
Oh Merlin, everything hurt. All his muscles felt sore, and he had to close his eyes to limit the headaches. Relieved he sighed as he felt something cold and damp on his forehead. Draco was there again. He knelt in front of the bed and carefully washed his shiny forehead with a cold cloth.
His voice was a bit colder than his soft grey eyes and Harry chuckled, gently brushing a strand of white-blond hair behind Draco’s ears. “If you don’t sulk, I will”, he teased, sliding his finger over Draco’s pouting lips.
“Fucking you outside in the alley, pressing you against the wall and take you from behind”, Harry growled against Draco’s collarbone. “The night we met, I mean…”
any louder?”
Weasley snorted with indignation.
“So. Of course you know that I came out bi when we started 6
and I felt sticky white cum spurting inside my boxer briefs.
"The thing with the hug."
Draco’s eyes shot up to the end of the pub and he saw how Harry, Seamus, Dean and Ron took a bow, thanking the audience, and climbed down the stage. They had a short conversation, grinning at each other and patting their backs, apparently satisfied with their gig. Some people came up to them Draco saw the girl with the bushy hair; a lanky guy with hair as red as Ron; a slightly chubby blonde man, who hugged Seamus and Dean; a couple of young girls, one with fiery red hair and the other with long white-blonde curls… But Harry seemed to brush their attempts of conversation of and just walked straight to the bar – straight to Draco.
A long-drawn sigh escaped my lips, as Harry pulled out the candy cane. His other hand was firm on my butt, kneading the pale flesh.
Draco woke up way too soon when something touched his arm. He jerked up and his hand twitched to his wand on the bedside table.
But neither of the two former Hogwarts students wanted to talk about their - how could you put it nicely? - tense relationship. They looked at each other suspiciously.
Draco swirled around, his left arm still in the air, his wand in his fist held like a microphone. His jaw dropped as he saw Harry’s wide grin on his face.
“Thanks for making me try”, Harry whispered against Draco’s lips, feeling the other man smirk.
The young Auror settled down on the sofa and Draco quickly slipped into the bath and then into his bedroom. Merlin, he was tired. It was already half past one in the night and tomorrow he had to be at work again at 9 o'clock. He undressed, slightly stumbling, but stopped at his underpants. Should anything happen during the night, at least he didn't want to be naked. He got into bed yawning and let himself sink into the soft pillows. He had just pulled the blanket up to his chin, when he had already fallen asleep.
“You want me to fuck you, baby?” He moved away from me and I nearly sobbed out of frustration and the lack of touching.
“Shit, just a second, baby. Be a good boy and just wait a second.”
"Bisexual, yes." Hermione Granger gave him a long look. "I think I should check on him, don't I?"
"So I have to say, otherwise men keep me awake in my bed in other ways," Draco threw in hastily and just couldn't stop looking at Harry's manbun!
intense.
“It’s okay, baby. You will feel better now.”
“Fuck”, I groaned. He would fuck me, right here and there. In this filthy alley, with people walking by just a few metres away.
Hermione narrowed her eyes, but passed over Draco's remark.
"Oh, Mr. Malfoy! There you are! We've heard a lot about you. Just don't relax, it's about to start. We'll give you the matching robes for this station and then I'll introduce you to Anthony Young, who will take you under his wing at first, you'll also be divided into the same shifts. By the way, my name is Jones, Margret Jones."
Once again wiping the tears from his grey eyes, Draco stands up. His watch on the nightstand shows 1:00 a.m. He feels cold and numb and longing just for one thing. Slowly he gets dressed. The hoodie is way too big for him and smells like Harry. This is no help.
That's about it... I have another Drarry Fic (way more angsty) about these particular love-birds in line, but it will take a while to translate it... Would you like to read it?
"So somebody poisoned him?"
“I swear, you looked so adorable, my little dancing queen…”, Harry teased.
“Yes, Sir! Thank you”, Draco gasped.
The turntable was playing quietly from the living room and Draco was stirring in the pan when the doorbell rang. Annoyed, he rolled his eyes, he had been looking forward to a quiet evening. To be on the safe side he turned the stove down, he had to get rid of the unannounced visit quickly, but his good food shouldn't burn on him!
"I know maybe we were both a little bit drunk and you were sad and needed closeness and comfort..."
“OHGODFUCK!”, he moans. “Nghaaa, Harry!”
Gosh, why wouldn’t she just stop?!
Reluctantly she presses a last kiss against Hermione’s soft lips and rolls out of the bed.
“Oh, that’s nice! Isn’t this nice, baby?” He was so cute, when he was excited. Just like a little kid.
Harry pulls Draco’s pants down in one motion and the blonde hisses as the cool air hits his hot prick. He’s so desperate for any touch, any friction against his aching erection.
“Okay, Harry.” Draco smiled as he saw, how Harry’s eyes lit up, as he heard Draco using his first name. “If you need anything –
In a flash the collapsed body straightened up and with a gasp Harry opened his eyes at the same time and in panic he looked back and forth with wide eyes.
A smile, a real, honest smile spread over Harry's face and showed his white teeth in his dark beard. "That would be nice."
“Aren’t you supposed to sleep at Pansy’s and Hermione’s house tonight?”, Harry asks softly, his amused smile obvious in his voice.
Another hand wrapped around his member and with long, skilful movements, Draco made him hard again.
– you!”
I felt how Harry involuntarily pressed his hips forward at the word “sex”.
when he saw something, that made him stop dead in his tracks, an unbelieving grin now wide on his face.
Draco saw tears glistening in her brown eyes.
me to sleep at Ron’s apartment”, Harry chuckles.
He took his wand from his robes to send up a memo. At that moment Draco, still sitting across from Potter, noticed a strange tremor running through the other man.
“You, Harry. Always –
The blonde smiled. "And what better distraction could there be than to have dinner with your ex-enemy," he mocked in a soft voice.
"Baby, what is wrong with you?," Draco asked with a sceptical, worried voice.
"C'mere," he whispered back and opened his arms.
He could hear the soft accusation in the voice of the former Slytherin and only shrugged his shoulder tiredly.
She hears bedsheets rustling and a low grunt. “What – Pansy, is that you?”
wedding?”, Hermione teases with a loving smile.
Finally something to justify the rating... You were so patient with me, thank you guys... :D
He pressed me against the cold stone wall, making me shiver even more than before. His lips crashed on mine, seizing them in a rough kiss. He bit my lower lip and I gasped as his hard cock pressed against my groin.
“I need you inside me –
I nodded. “Sure, let’s meet in 15 minutes here, ready to leave?”
only professional curiosity, thank you very much. He would simply like to know how it all had turned out. Draco growled angrily and annoyed about himself and drew his arms to his chest, shivering in a fresh breeze. The spring sun was already shining, but the wind in April was still cold. He found shelter at his desk and tried to study the new book about antidotes, which he had bought last week, but he simply couldn't do it. He was too unfocused and felt absent-minded.
He didn't stop, he couldn't be stopped until he stood in his apartment again.
"Hold him down," he yelled at his colleagues and was on Harry's stretcher with one movement.
"Please Harry, I want to feel you."
“Sure”, Harry sighed, scratching the back of his neck. “But don’t expect too much. I guess, it’s far less exciting than you hope for.”
And that was true. Draco didn't see Potter in the E.R. next time - but standing in front of his door. Three days had passed since the night of the panic attacks and Draco was cooking his dinner. He had spent a somewhat hectic 10-hour shift in the E.R., had gone grocery shopping and now wanted to reward himself with a good meal. Fresh salmon was on a board for seasoning, vegetables roasted in a pan and in a small pot Draco had prepared the white wine dill sauce he loved so much. One might wonder why a rich boy, who always had everything precooked by house elves, was so enthusiastic and also good in the kitchen. The fact is that cooking and yoga have a lot in common. Routine, skills, movements, breathing, relaxing, pleasing the soul. And so after Azkaban Draco had discovered that he was a true natural talent in the kitchen!
Oh boy, Draco! That was a
“Fuck, fuck, fuck. I’m so sorry, love!”
“What is it?”, Harry shouted back, momentarily holding his hands still.
“Do you really think he would overhear my voice?”
Draco's heart was beating way too fast.
"Draco Malfoy! Do you actually have the self-control of a 12-year-old," he scolded himself as his hand set off on its own.
“I love you so much, babe.” Harry’s voice is low and warm. He spreads little kisses over Draco’s thighs, until he twitches impatiently.
"Well then, come with me before he throws the whole ward into turmoil," the older healer hummed in surprise.
“Sorry, what?!”
shortly after his discharge from Azkaban. At that time he was a nervous wreck, needed something that could restore his maltreated body and his depressive mind. He loved this mixture of strength, balance and body awareness. It calmed him down and was the perfect balance to the stressful work in St. Mungo. It also had the nice side effect that his agility, flexibility and body tension had improved considerably. And he loved the slim, lean body shape with the long, finely defined muscles that yoga gave him.
And the sounds he made. Oh my god. He hummed and sighed and together with the filthy slurping sounds his mouth made, it seemed like he just ate the best treacle tart in the world.
Then Harry smiled slightly. "You're pretty."
“I know, I know. And I’m really sorry. Look, it wasn’t my fault. These Germans were such good drinkers!”
“Anything for you, daddy”, Draco murmured as he moved his way down Harry’s muscular body. “Just lean back and enjoy.”
“Stop teasing!”, the blonde whines. “I need to feel you.
"Potter, you're glowing!" Draco put his cool hand on the hot, sweaty forehead of his friend. "What do you think you're doing here? Did you still do the whole household?" he asked in a stern voice.
Damn it, when did Harry get up and stand in front of his chair? Draco looked up into the amusedly smiling face, saw the light pink of his cheeks creeping out under Harry's beard, saw the man in front of him biting his full lower lip.
Carefully he stepped nearer, admiring Draco’s otherwise sharp features, now gleaming softly in the dim, orange light of the fire. Harry slightly bowed down, taking the book out of Draco’s hand and laying it on the small table nearby. His boyfriend just sighed a little in his sleep, snuggling even more into the pillows. Harry knew, that Draco always complained about the neck pain he got, when he slept on the couch and decided to wake him with a gentle kiss and carry him to the bedroom.
After the quill had written the last sentence, Draco grabbed the piece of parchment and quietly opened the bedroom door again. Gentle light came through the thick curtains and Draco saw Harry lying on his stomach, his arms wrapped around the blanket and his head buried in Draco's pillow. Draco stepped closer to the bed. The former Gryffindor looked really beautiful, as peaceful and relaxed as he hadn't seen him in a long time. The long hair fell into his forehead and Draco carefully stroked a strand behind his ear. Harry sighed briefly, but didn't move. He had to be really exhausted. And Draco was glad to see that he apparently got some sleep here.
Hermione sighed, "I think so too. Either that was a really stupid and clumsy attempt or exactly the opposite and very long and extensively planned, which makes me much more afraid!
They remained silent for a while and Draco was already thinking that Harry would never tell him, when the black-haired guy took a deep breath: "It was an absolutely disgusting feeling. I was clear on one side, I knew I was in St. Mungo and everything, but somehow the other half of my brain was gone. I had these seizures with terrible hallucinations and visions. It was almost worse than back then, you know, at the battle."
Ron had said the evening before, when he had left the apartment to go to his date.
“Amen to that!”, I grinned.
Harry pulled back, gasping for air, before sucking his balls in his mouth. Draco bit his lips to contain himself from screaming. Yet a high-pitched gasp left him, when Harrys fingers finally pressed against the plug nestling deep in Draco’s ass and pushed it against his prostate.
Draco lifts his head and smirks. “I know, I know. But I missed you so much!”
, Sir, I’ll be good!”
"You know what the best decision I've made in the last few years has been?," Harry asked. His voice was deep and a little hoarse and a warm shiver ran down Draco's spine. "To come here last night, to you..."
Draco reached out one arm and put his slender hand on Harry's forearm. The skin was still warm from sleep and somehow an electric crackling seemed to emanate from the touch.
Harry looked at him in amazement.
friend.
The former Slytherin now stood a bit perplexed in front of the white door to Potter's room.
Draco shudders.
I smirked into his scarf. That might work. “I just want to be in bed and feel your warm, strong body”, I whined.
– a plug?” he added, just as Harry’s lips wrapped around his already dripping glans.
He pressed his full lips on my skin and purred like a cat. I winced as he pulled put and slumped next to me, pulling me tight against his body.
The pleasant burn spread through Draco’s limbs, crawling up his spine and numbing his brain. Harry’s breath was hot on his neck and his hands bruising his slender waist.
Just as he was in the middle of cooking, he heard the soft swooshing in the fireplace, announcing that Draco had flooed to the living room.
Careful not to break the spell, Harry opened the glass front door. But unfortunately, he forgot about the little bells hanging from the ceiling, informing Draco, when a customer would enter.
Draco grinned and patted Harry’s cheek and Harry could throttle him for being such an arrogant git. The blonde seemed to notice the glare he was getting, and his smile turned soft. “It’s just for you to let me know, if you get uncomfortable, all right? I won’t do anything you don’t feel good with, okay?”
“Why would I?!”, Harry laughed.
“I can’t believe I let you fuck me in a dark alley!”, Draco moaned between two passionate kisses.
on me.
"And then he simply drinks something that suddenly appears in his apartment?" Draco asked mockingly. "I thought the man is an Auror. They are sceptical by nature and always on their guard!"
And again he pulled me into a small alley. But this time with no concealing charms around us. “When you behave and be quiet, I’ll fuck you into the mattress later.”
"It's okay." The black haired man sighed and turned around again. "Where are your spices?"
While Harry inspected the spice drawer and seasoned his food, Draco set the table. He couldn't believe they had dinner together only once, it felt so familiar to stand in a good smelling kitchen and talk to Harry.
“Yes, daddy.”
unusually cold in there today, wasn't it? Back outside, he inconspicuously enchanted his shopping bags, making them lighter to carry home without much effort. But either he didn't quite manage the magic today, or his sinewy arms were just too weak. Anyway, the way back to the apartment was exhausting, actually everything was exhausting. And these damn headaches were now really pounding in the back of his head.
Harry felt his orgasm coming closer, lust pooled in his lower stomach and his pulse sped up. The muscles in his thighs and back tensed, Harry’s eyes closed once again and as Draco swirled his tongue around his glans once again, Harry came hard. He groaned long and low and shot his hot cum in Draco’s still eagerly sucking mouth. After what felt like an eternity, Harry loosened his hand in the blond hair and Draco released his now flaccid cock with a wet pop. Unabashedly he wiped the back of his hand over his swollen lips and smirked at Harry, who was still panting.
”, he whispers, and it feels like a prayer. Just slowly they come down from their highs.
. And yet – Harry is not here.
The two healers were already on their feet. Anthony prepared a quick calming potion, while Draco stayed with Harry. He tried to calm him down and listen to his vital signs at the same time. Everything was routine and professional, every move was perfect and in the end Anthony and Draco had managed to sedate the black-haired man. Harry's breathing was flat, his eyes flickering back and forth. His lips moved slightly.
“There were men fucking men and
Draco sighed angrily, but Potter smiled crookedly.
“Good!” Harry sat up, clapping his hands twice enthusiastically and Draco groaned because he already missed the wet heat around his cock.
in a café?!”, Harry whispered harshly.
Again and again the black-haired man pressed his hands on his ears or eyes, as if to lock something out, but what only he could see or hear. Draco tried to calm the trembling man with a soft voice. He didn't even think of what had happened between them at the moment. About the fact that they had been enemies since day 1 and hated each other. As I said, Draco had changed and now he didn't care about all those old feuds and rivalries. He had already broken so much in his life with blind hatred for others. He was just tired of it.
"I don't know..." Harry mumbled into the pillow and allowed his boyfriend to gently pull the sweaty shirt over his head.
“Yes, oh Merlin, yesss”, I hissed, trying to press back against his tongue, hands, skin,
And then, without a warning, I felt the cane grow. Yes, grow. It fucking expanded in my hole. I moaned. I felt fuller and fuller every second.
Grinning, Draco clinked his glass against the other.
Draco was really queasy. What had happened to Harry that he was so scared? At least now he spoke English to them again, which they could probably book as progress.
“Turn it off”, I sobbed.
me!”, Draco screamed. He gently took Harry’s hand from his nose to take a look at the damage he had caused. Draco gasped as he saw the thick droplets of ruby-coloured liquid dripping out of Harry’s left nostril, running over his upper lip towards his stubbly chin.
Harry seemed to understand me, and he was too impatient himself anyway. I know he finally wanted to taste me. He penetrated me with his tongue and a long scream escaped my throat. He licked the sensitive skin faster and faster, pushed his tongue into the tight hole. I clawed my hands into the bed sheet and breathed shakily, being so heavenly fucked by Harry’s tongue.
His heart still beating fast in his chest, Harry tiptoes down the narrow staircase and opens the door. There stands a slightly shivering Draco, wearing his sweater and an expression somewhere between a worried look and a relieved smile.
Ron sighed. “That’s Draco. He works here apparently. So he let us in and refilled the bar, while
Those incredibly green eyes looked at him unfathomably.
The next week went quite well. He had settled in a little, knew where everything was by now and got to know his other colleagues slowly. When he handed Anthony the right utensils on Wednesday before he had even asked for them, he was rewarded with an appreciative look.
“If you would give me a kiss, I will”, the blonde replied slyly.
“Well, there’s not much left”, Ron answered, when he finally felt it would be safe enough to uncover his ears, so he wouldn’t have to hear anything related to our sex life. This prude.
“Stop! Stop it!
Draco was almost done with his second glass of wine by now and he felt himself calming down. Maybe it wasn't such a stupid idea after all. The blonde raised his glass and looked in Harry's sparkling eyes. How could they be so incredibly green?
nervous when it comes to men!”
“Don’t you want be a good boy, Malfoy?”
"Shit," Harry mumbled and stared at the light skin in horror. "Shit Draco, I never wanted that! I'm sorry! I never would have -" He broke off and looked at the blonde man with desperate eyes.
"Shut up, I think he's trying to say something," Draco hushed the other two.
Careful not to hurt Draco, Harry pulled out the plug. “Such a naughty boy, teasing himself without telling me. Lucky for you, that we have to be quick. Or else you wouldn’t come in
Harry’s skin felt hot and sweaty, his legs started to tremble. Lust rushed through his veins and pooled in his belly. He felt so desperate to come. His boyfriend’s mouth was warm and tight, his tongue massaging the head expertly. The finger in his ass built up a steady and fast rhythm against his prostate, making Harry gasp and moan, his face contorted with pleasure.
There lies his best friend, naked, his back facing the door. But that was not, what made him stop. Harry’s hips move rhythmically, slowly thrusting. Ron’s mouth falls open. Harry’s arm is wrapped around a slender, pale figure with white-blonde hair, pressing his bottom against Harry. And now he can even hear the low grunts and breathy moans that fill the warm air.
"What? But -," Draco started astonished.
bang. And then we couldn’t stop. Damn, my ass got sore that night. His huge cock and his natural dominance were such a turn on for me. How could I possibly live without that now? And well, yeah. He’s alright, too, I suppose. I mean, he’s kind and funny and beautiful and snarky and sexy and… Okay, okay! I might have a
“Well, maybe you can show daddy what your hands are also capable of”, Harry said lightly. “Or that pretty little mouth of yours…”, he added, feeling himself get hard thinking about Draco’s lips on his cock.
, he quickly pushed aside.
"You mean Ginny?" Hermione seemed confused. "What about her?"
Draco’s back arched, his legs trembled as hot white lust shot through his veins, pooling in his groins, orgasm building quickly. Harry groaned low and deep in his throat, clawing one big hand in Draco’s hair and pulling his blond head back to ravish his lips in a sloppy kiss.
There was an unpleasant pause in which the two former Hogwarts students looked to the floor.
The Auror gave no answer, but began to tremble more and more. His shaking hand pointed towards Anthony and he gasped heavily. Something scared him terribly. He screamed as Draco touched his knee.
The young woman twisted her mouth. "Don't you think we're beyond the whole last name thing? I mean, after all, we're on the same side now, aren't we?
A spark of anger stirred in Draco. This woman was really unbelievable. It was a miracle that she had passed her exams!
“I’ll be back in an hour!”, he shouted over his shoulder to Ron and the other guys and rushed out of the door.
He shook him slightly, but got no answer. The dark-haired head was still shifting unsteadily from right to left, uttering something like a frightened whimper.
Draco took the strong, tanned hands in his and pulled the black haired one up on his feet. Silently he pulled the smaller man towards him and put his arms around him. Just a second later he felt two muscular arms snaking around his middle and Harry laying his head on Draco's shoulder. The blonde felt the warmth and the fast heartbeat of the other. With slow movements he stroked the wide back of the former Gryffindor until his breath had calmed down again.
“I need to have you now”, Harry panted.
“I’m so cold”, I told him when we were a few feet behind our friends.
A big grin spread across the bearded face. "Well, welcome to the team, Draco."
"Yes, yes,
He now pressed hot, wet kisses on my shoulders and neck and I felt goose bumps spread over my entire back.
Harry’s green eyes are soft, as he leans forward. Draco feels the rough stubble against his chin and then sinfully soft lips on his. Harry’s kiss is sweet, warm and full of love.
“Yes, Si-iiiiiirrr uugghhn!” Draco’s whispered answer turned into a moan, as Harry found his prostate, pressing hard against this little bundle of nerves.
Draco smiles happily and presses his face in the crook of Harry’s neck, relishing the tangy, manly smell and the dark beard against his sensitive skin.
Lots of love ♥
"Okay, Harry. You're doing great," Draco continued calmly, trying to be professional. "Do you know who I am?"
He helped me pull my pants back on and kissed me once again. No need to say that I didn’t feel cold anymore. I felt pretty much on fire.
“Oh no, my little needy boy. You’ll come when I say you can, do you understand?” Harry’s voice was low and hoarse, leaving no room for protest.
“We have a problem, oh dear, Harry’s going to kill us!”, Pansy screams.
. Slow and sensual. Their moans and movements entangle in one deep, earth-shattering rhythm, which makes them both nearly blind with lust and the essential need to come.
Before Harry could answer, Weasley's annoying voice started again. Draco rolled his eyes.
Harry nodded quickly. “Yes…”
“They’re tonight’s band, you say?”, she asked, tapping beer for the first guests who arrived. “My, my, they’re some fine treats!”
Draco's mother was acquitted before the wizard gamot. Harry Potter had testified for her in this lengthy process and told how she had saved his life and lied to Lord Voldemort at the most crucial moment. Draco couldn't help but be eternally grateful to Harry Potter, Harry Potter of all people. In contrast to his father, he loved his mother, who had always been a very gentle and loving woman, who had only got into the wrong circles and the wrong family.
Draco cleared his throat. "I think you were about to explain why you were lying half-naked in my bed again."
“Can you maybe…?” Harry gestured down to his crotch, where his cock has softened a little bit at the unfamiliar intrusion.
“Daddy?”, he asked permission, tapping lightly against Harry’s bum.
“I know, I know. But I missed you so much!”, Draco whines.
Draco rubbed his chin. "I think we can send him up to the ward. I'll try to find out what happened."
"Thank you."
Florean Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlour had been closed for a long time and the magical community was in desperate need for some good, comforting food after the war. And so, they were all happy and excited when 3 years ago colourful flyers and posters announced a new shop in Diagon Alley called
“Aww, poor baby”, Draco teased, yelping when Harry poked him in the ribs. “So, you had a rather bad first experience?”
So now Draco nervously bounced on the tips of his feet and waited in the training room for his name to be called.
They continued working, tuning and testing the instruments, checking the lights, playing a few songs to check the harmony. Around 6p.m. they finished and just grabbed a few beers out of the bar, when the door opened again, and the blonde boy sauntered back in.
"Harry Potter," his colleague called out.
Potter blinked twice, then he breathed "Draco."
"I don't know either. Ron was there and he jumped at you and in front of him I just couldn't admit how much you really helped me.” He grimaced and looked Draco in the eye now. "That was childish of me. I have to apologize to you. And thank you.”
The vibration stopped immediately and the candy cane shrunk back to its normal size.
! I'm cooommmming..." Draco screamed and clung to the tabletop. He pushed his butt back, so that Harry hit his prostate even harder and after only three more deep shocks he spilled his cum on the table top with a husky scream.
"You call me Draco, too," countered the blonde.
"Can I... can I perhaps sleep here," Harry asked in a choked voice.
"I was hoping you could tell us," the blonde replied.
A throaty moan sounds loud in the small bedroom, as Harry licks a broad stripe over Draco’s puckered hole. He loves being eaten by Harry, the intimacy and filthiness makes him feel so hot and aroused. Harry’s skilled tongue now dances over his tight hole, wetting it and making it twitch with lust. Draco digs his fingers into the ruffled bedsheets and his feet into Harry’s broad shoulders.
"Oh God, fuck, yes!"
They ate together and talked, at first a little tense and awkward, but after a while (and a little more wine) more and more relaxed. Draco quickly realized that they both avoided sensitive issues. Most of all they talked about their respective work and the young healer was pleased to notice that Harry seemed really interested. And the end of dinner the entire bottle of his favorite white wine was empty.
"Oh, excuse me..."
"Harry's colleagues are investigating the case, but they don't have much hope of getting any clues about the sender. They found some feathers and see if they can get on with it."
The young healer convinced himself that his interest in the case was
, can I please come, Sir?
"You don't know what was going on in my head that night..." the young Auror muttered shamefully.
“Hello?”, a sleepy voice answers.
The warm wet heat around his dick felt so good and Draco’s hips jerked forward, pressing himself even deeper in Harry’s mouth. He was so deep in Harry’s throat and so
"Fuck, what's wrong?," he shouted in a hoarse voice and blinked into the darkness.
"What are we going to do with him now," Anthony thought. "I think I'll call down one of the colleagues from the curse damage department, maybe they've seen something like this before."
“There’s your proof!”, Pansy laughed.
If you want, you can leave a small comment! It's my first fic in english and it would mean the world to me ♥
And then I didn’t need to wait anymore. I finally felt a new gush of lube wet my loose hole and without warning, Harry shoved two fingers inside me. I screamed at the sudden burning pleasure and threw my head up again. Immediately a hand gripped my blond hair and held me in that position. My head bent back, my back arched, my ass pressed against Harry's hand. Just for a second he gave me time to accustom to his fingers, then he began to thrust relentlessly into my tight hole.
“But I just can’t believe you weren’t curious at all! You
"What did you say?" it came back from the hallway where Draco just took off his black leather shoes and put them neatly on the shelf and hung his grey cashmere coat on the wardrobe.
"Turn around," a deep lust filled voice said and Draco obeyed immediately. He leaned against the wall with his forearms and spread his legs wide apart.
ago) released in a bang. A loud bang. A fucking
“Come on, just do it! I’m gonna call Blaise and we’ll have to find this blonde idiot. Later!”
“Shut up…” The words were now much softer, and Harry felt his heart skip a beat.
Draco’s breath hitched. Did Harry really just say ‘he’? And then the chorus started, and Harry’s mischievous twinkling eyes just landed on Draco and a huge grin appeared in his bearded face as he sang:
Draco’s breath calms down as Harry entirely withdraws his skilled fingers and climbs up the bed, his body pressing hot and strong against Draco’s.
"You're still here?," asked the Auror.
“If you want to join us?”, Harry asked, trying to regain his old flirting potential.
Immediately Harry releases his throbbing cock with a wet plop and pulls his fingers a bit back.
Draco laughed quietly. Unexpected courage rushed through him.
“Please, he looks like a fucking Calvin Klein model!”, Dean snorted and yelped as Seamus smacks him on the head. “Shay, you know I love you, but you can’t deny it. He’s really good looking.”
"But he's not your patient at all!”
“Oh hell!” Harry looked around, but the other people sitting in the little, cosy café, drinking their cappuccinos and earl greys, seemingly haven’t heard his snarky boyfriend. “Could you
“Beg for it.” His voice was low and dangerous.
Harry snorted a chuckle, apparently shooting a bit more blood out of his recently punched nose, judging by Draco’s more than disgusted face. “Whoops, sorry, babe.” He waved his hand quickly to clean Draco’s fingers. “Well, I wasn’t expecting to
– in my own home – by my own boyfriend”, he added dryly.
"And you don't know what curse it was?," Anthony asked the dark-skinned auror-colleague and held the door open for the trio.
Harry chuckles and gently releases Draco’s clinging arms. “Come on.”
And Draco's heart made a little hop.
“Shit, Ron! What the fuck?!”
Draco described where he had which dishes and shortly afterwards the two school enemies sat opposite at the set kitchen table.
“Then I’ll have some fun with you.” I felt and heard that the cheeky grin was back.
Draco continued in a soft voice: "You know, if this was just a one-time thing for you, say it now. I don't feel like falling in love with you even more, just so you break my heart."
“What the hell?!”
"Ah, uhng," slipped out of his parted lips. He quickly pushed Harry a few centimeters away, otherwise he couldn't concentrate at all. "What exactly was that for you?"
"Draco, look at me..."
Harry already had his hand on the door handle to the
And then he screams. His eyes once again fly open by surprise as he feels something tight and wet around his leaking cock. Harry has now buried three fingers inside his slick hole and swallows his rock-hard cock down to the hilt.
tried to take it up your arse?”
He felt the Auror hastily rubbing his eyes. They sat there for a short while, arm in arm. When they released, both smiled slightly.
I nodded weakly. “Yes…”
He kicked against the back of his sofa and gasped as he felt the stabbing pain in his toe. Growling, he jumped around on one leg until the throbbing had subsided. Then he dropped onto the next chair and stared angrily at the ceiling. Harry,
Draco could certainly understand what it was like when the fear was eating you up, when you had pure panic and just wanted to scream. Yes, he knew that feeling, that Potter, no…
"Is everything okay with him? Did you cure him?" she asked worriedly.
The blond arched his back and shook his head.
forget that day? It spread like a wildfire when people heard it.”
“Harry…”, I gasped.
Then he cleaned up a little and did some paperwork. The house elves used to do the work in the Manor, which was very comfortable, of course, but Draco had to admit that he didn't miss it much. His apartment in the suburbs of London was small and easy to keep clean. He paid it from his salary and had paid for the furniture from his savings and a generous heir from a distant relative. He had decorated it simple and modern, with lots of dark wood and light fabrics, just the way he liked it. He was fed up with the eternal pomp and kitsch of Malfoy Manor.
– much, Harry.”
“Shh, love. I’ll make you feel so good and warm.” His voice was full of mischievous joy.
With faster movements, Draco's breath also got faster. With his left forearm he leaned against the cool tiles in front of him and allowed the water to warm his back, while he sighed and groaned slightly. Finally he felt something hot building up inside him, rushing through his veins, stunning him, and with a loud groan he came into his own hand.
Lately he hadn't been able to go out as much because of his new position. And so he had had to help himself from time to time with his own hand - and with the vibrator lying in his bedside drawer. A small stubborn voice in the back of his head kept telling him that these constant one-night stands and the occasional (or frequent) masturbation were not adequate substitutes for closeness and love and could not fill the void Draco felt from time to time. But it was fun anyway.
"Yes, so he only speaks Italian...", Potter's colleague resignedly continued.
“About 7am”, Hermione answers and kisses her shoulder. “Didn’t you hear the alarm clock?”
I stepped nearer; my knees were so weak. With shivering fingers, I reached for his jacket and clawed the material, trying to stabilize myself. He pressed my head against his chest, my cheek now lay warm against his hard muscles. He gently massaged my scalp and neck.
“Aww, my poor darling…”
THE END
“Alright”, Harry smiled, only then realising that the rest of the band already left the pub to enjoy the warm sun. “I’ll see you later, I guess?”
“Yes, Sir.”
"Well, we'll see," Anthony sighed a little helplessly.
“Even better than you?”, Dean chuckled and handed Harry his guitar.
I rolled my eyes at him. Well, it wasn’t my problem. And I would most certainly
"Well," Draco mumbled hesitantly. "I thought they were a couple? Where was she when Potter was poisoned?"
Harry felt something warm and wet on his upper lip and as he took his hand down to look at it, he saw light red blood.
When Harry announced their last song, Draco was a nervous wreck. Pansy punched him on his arm – again – as he forgot the order of the young woman standing in front of him – again. Draco glared at her, rubbing his slender arm.
Draco sighed and stretched his sore back. The last customer had just left the store and he could finally close his little ice cream parlour.
"Even better."
Harry approaches the bed, pulls Draco down with him and covers them both with the blanket. The blonde man immediately snuggles into Harry’s chest and lets out a relieved sigh.
“Okay, okay! Let’s go, now!” I darted up immediately, bumping the top of my hand painfully against Harry’s chin. “Ow, sorry, Harry! But seriously, let’s go now!”
"What happened to him?" Draco asked and had to stifle the sneering grin.
“What the hell are you doing there?”
"Harry, please..." he whimpered as the Auror stopped at the waistband of his trousers.
, that was the hottest stuff I’ve ever seen. But it was also the summer after Sirius died and – well, let’s say I really had an emotional roller coaster that summer.”
I stepped back to him and gently lay a hand on his arm. “Are you okay?”
Draco breathed a sigh of relief. "It's alright, Harry. Don't worry..."
Ron Weasley, the freckled face still as bland and banal as ever, leaned against the wall next to the window.
"You can go, Malfoy. We'll be fine," he muttered quietly, avoiding carefully raising his gaze.
And as Harry’s hands gradually moved under Draco’s shirt, the pale skin warm under his calloused fingers, he thought that kissing Draco would never stop to amaze him. He would never stop.
We both panted and gasped, completely spent and exhausted. My muscles shivered and I sank down, Harry now on top of me, breathing fast gushs of hot air against my neck.
"Anyway I only came to you because I wanted to apologize for my behavior the other day. The invitation was your idea," he added with a little grin.
Exhaustion falls over Draco and he feels a content smile spread across his lips. He closes is eyes and hums as Harry’s finger rake pleasantly through his blonde hair.
"Potter's friend brought this."
“I mean, if you never try, you’ll never know whether you like it or not”, the blonde continued. “Or
With a flick of his wand, Harry vanished all of their clothes and pressed Draco down on their bed. He lay himself on his slender boyfriend, relishing the slide of his warm, soft skin, feeling the sharp hip bones pressing against his stomach.
With the small vial he hurried back to treatment room No. 4. The other three had tidied up, removed the vomit and cleaned Potter's T-shirt. They had covered up the young man, who was now lying bent on his side and apparently unconscious.
He normally wasn’t ashamed of his sexuality or his relationship in any way. He was totally comfortable to kiss or hug Draco in public, call him sweet names, whisper dirty things in his ear, when they were at a party. He was also perfectly fine with Draco wearing sinfully transparent shirts from time to time, or his black leather pants that fit so perfectly around his bubble butt. Or when they were wearing nothing in the sauna. So why would he blush like a schoolgirl when Draco decided to discuss the integrity of his behind? How did they come up with that issue anyway?
He felt a warm hand patting his back discretely. He looked to Katherine on his left, who looked at him with her gullible doggy eyes. Draco just shrugged his shoulders and bent his back a little to escape the touch. At least in the emergency room he would escape this clingy nag.
"Well, Harry was free today and we were supposed to meet at his place for breakfast. I flooed to him and everything was normal. We went to the kitchen and he made me a tea. Then he said that a colleague had lent him a book, which I would certainly like, and he went into the living room to get it. He took forever, he's really a bit chaotic. So I quickly went to the toilet and when I came back, he was standing in the kitchen pouring himself a glass of that bottle I had given you. I'm a 100% sure the bottle wasn't on the kitchen counter before! He drank a sip and after a few seconds he collapsed screaming and cramping. He threw up and it was all red and then I grabbed him  and apparated here!"
"Hmm," Anthony hummed and scribbled in the thick file. "And how long ago was that now?"
“You’re doing so good, Draco. So perfect for me.”
Draco blushed furiously and buried his face in his hands. “Oh, shut up”, he grumbled.
“Baby”, Harry murmurs and pulls Draco’s slender body in a tight hug.
At 6 o'clock in the morning Draco left the St. Mungo and apparated home. A little weary, he unlocked the door to his small apartment. Last week had been exhausting. Every night he and Anthony had been on duty and so he was all the more looking forward to the day off tomorrow. He neatly put his shoes on the shelf and hung the grey cashmere coat on the wardrobe. He decided to take a hot shower before he went to bed. Last night had knocked him out. This strange curse that hit Potter... Hopefully he would be better tomorrow. He knew that he really shouldn't care. That it was none of his business. Normally his work was done as soon as he had transferred a patient to another ward and finished the paperwork, but somehow it was different now.
"Exuse me,
"Nothing..." Harry tried to fend him off.
Meanwhile Draco let himself sink onto the stool in front of Potter and put a hand on his shoulder.
Harry sighed, "You must really think I'm a wimp..."
"I'll be right back," he heard Draco's soft voice and felt slender fingers set his glasses down and run through his pitch-black hair.
Without waiting for the smaller boy's protest, Draco turned off all the buttons on the stove and effortlessly lifted his poor sick sweetheart into his muscular arms. Harry huddled silently against Draco's slender neck and tiredly wrapped his arms around him.
at, by the way!
"It was very good that you brought this bottle with you. Otherwise I wouldn't have figured it out to be poison so fast. So I put a bezoar in his throat. Then he stopped cramping and screaming. And then I gave him the right antidote to the arsenic and they sent him up the third floor to the poisoning ward."
"Well, do you need help?"
I heard him whisper another spell and I shouted a muffled scream into his chest. It vibrated. The candy cane fucking vibrated against my swollen prostate. I pressed my mouth into his warm chest, trying to keep quiet, but still some breathy moans escaped me. My heart pounded wildly in my chest.
“Can’t we just go back to the castle and have sex? I will freeze to death here…”
Draco waved his hand impatiently. Harry shuffled forward and lay down next to his boyfriend, his head placed on his milky white thighs. He felt gentle hands raking through his long black hair where it was not tied up in a bun.
They started working again, Harry set up his guitar, the amplifier and the mic on front of the stage. Then he thought of something.
Draco looked at Harry, and Harry grabbed his hand, pulling him out of the alley onto the dark street, their breathless laughter echoing through the night.
Now the brunette smiled and sat down. "Thank you. So I just wanted to tell you what Harry reported when he woke up."
He felt Draco’s full lips on his cheek and jawline, kissing their way down to his neck. Closing his eyes, Harry pressed Draco even closer and hummed contentedly.
Tadaaa!
Masking an innocent smile, Harry approached his friends.
Leave your [kudos] and [comments] <3
!”, Draco blurted.
"Oh Mr. Potter, it's always nice when you visit us!"
"And third, it is Potter's decision whether or not I treat him!"
"Great idea", Anthony intervened now. "Draco, you take over from here and I'll go get a nice hot cuppa coffee." With these words he rose.
“I do, fuck yes!” With a last push the candy cane was all the way inside my hole. The curved part snugged tightly around my heavy balls. “I do daddy!”
Harry rolled his eyes at the blonde young man sitting opposite of him.
"Draco?"
*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*
“And let me guess, who it is.”
Draco was still confused when he had sent Granger to the right ward and finally called it a day. So Harry Potter was bisexual. Why did that shock him so much? That he was gay himself hadn't been a big secret at Hogwarts. After all, he was able to live it out there, while at home he was beaten up by his father. He himself was least disturbed by "deviant" preferences. Then why did his cheeks turn red when he thought of Potter and another man? And why did this man have light blond hair in his fantasy? Draco shook his head angrily, said goodbye to Anthony and apparated home.
Draco shot back up, bumping his head painfully against the countertop and groaning now not only because of Pansy’s unabashed comment. Grabbing his throbbing head, he looked daggers at her. “
"Potter," Draco nodded barely through clenched teeth.
They sat next to each other on the benches in the waiting area. Draco let Potter's file fly to him and noted simultaneously everything Hermione told him.
good. The sun shone softly through the dark curtains and Draco cleaned himself and the bed quickly with a flick of his wand. After a short shower, he prepared himself a cup of coffee and some toast and tomatoes, and read a few articles in the daily prophet that the post-owl had brought to his windowsill in the morning.
"Merlin,
“Hi! You guys must be The Deathly Hallows?”, he asked a red-headed boy covered in freckles standing nearest to him. “I’m Draco.”
"How about that: to the cook of this certainly very tasty meal," the black-haired man suggested.
He let go off my hair and pulled his fingers out off my ass. But just a second later, they were replaced with the blunt head of his thick cock.
Draco quickly performed a diagnostic spell on Potter's maltreated back, indicating that something was wrong with the left ribs and both lungs.
Draco's heart stopped.
“Calm, love. Maybe he’s downstairs making tea?”
crush on him! And every time he calls me baby, my heart melts and my cock twitches.
Harry slowly sinks down, his half-hard cock still buried deep in Draco. His breath is fast as he nuzzles in the crook of Draco’s neck.
, I’m so close. God,
soft lips. Carefully he moved his mouth. A feeling of happiness flowed through him as he noticed how his kiss was reciprocated. The kiss was slow and gentle and so absolutely
“You cocky bastard”, he growled. “Making your daddy hard in public…”
The blonde felt his cheeks getting hot. Damn, had Potter just called
"And that's exactly why I visit my patient," Draco replied snappishly.
„Hey, Harry, Draco! Have you guys seen this?”
“Pans, if I didn’t know for sure, that you’re
"I don't know, the Russians we're on have some funny tricks in store. They are really dangerous to the public safety and stop at nothing. We had just arrested four of them when a fifth, whom we had not seen before, fired a curse. I couldn't stupefy him until he had hit Harry. A purple lightning hit him on the chest and he collapsed immediately. When he woke up again, he was completely confused and frightened and then the Italian was bubbling out of him. He's also shaking all the time," Potter's auror colleague reported.
”, Harry moaned deep in his throat as an all-consuming fire exploded in his body and he came into Draco’s sucking mouth. It wasn’t like any feeling he had before. Sure he had had orgasms before – even great, eye-rolling ones, coming deep in Draco’s tight ass. But that? That was new. Only when his back sank back against the mattress he realized, that he must have bent it upwards, head pressing into the pillow. He felt dizzy and shuddered as Draco gently pulled his finger out.
His face was now so close to Draco's that he could feel the other man's breath on his lips.
(See the end of the chapter for
year of Hogwarts. As McGonagall announced that they had to share a dorm in order to “reinforce inter-house unity”, Harry thought that this was the worst thing that could have happened to him. Until he realised it wasn’t. It was in fact the start of a new beginning, with gently thriving friendships at first, awkward dates after a few months and finally a big declaration of love in the Great Hall near the end of term. The results of this memorable day were a blushing Draco, cheering and whistling students, and a nearly broken ankle, as Harry fell from the table, he was standing on.
"What's in there?," he asked the blonde.
Yes. Right. The gig. Fuck. That’s why Harry felt the urgency to jump out of bed, when he looked at the clock earlier. And where was his phone again? With unsteady feet Harry headed back to his room and searched his phone in the pair of dark blue jeans, that he found on his bedroom floor.
"That sounds damn good," Draco replied quietly and kissed Harry's scar on his forehead. "And a little love I can really use right now."
“Yeah, sure. We won’t tell your boss!”, the Irish guy stated with a smirk.
The blonde healer sighed, "All right... Hermione. What can I do for you?" He pointed to the chair in front of the desk.
Harry shook his head.
“You don’t mind my loud mouth on other occasions, Potter…”, Draco smirked, showing of his perfect white teeth.
Draco could only nod weakly.
“Look at you”, Draco cooed. “Inviting me for a drink in my own bar…” He laughed softly as he saw Harry’s ears turn red. How was it possible for a man like
“You’re all set up, as I see?”, Draco asked with an appreciative look to the stage.
Harry nodded and lay back on the soft mattress. He felt warm and a bit dizzy, like he had drunken a glass of firewhiskey. But it didn’t feel uncomfortable. Draco certainly arouse his interest and ambition. His curiosity had always been there if Harry had to be honest with himself. Seeing Draco so keenly enjoying everything that had to do with his arse, was such a huge turn-on for Harry, so of course he had wondered how it might feel.
“What?! That’s – what?!”, Draco gasped in an embarrassing high-pitched tone. Great, that would already be the second time tonight.
This is just smut. Pure, shameless, hard smut.
“If I’ll find him, he could be happy to have
Draco rolled his eyes and turned to Harry at the kitchen table.
"Here, drink this up."
Draco choked and puffed into his coffee cup. That couldn't be true. He must have misheard himself. But unfortunately he knew the voice that answered far too well.
and stuff…”
Harry grinned a little and Draco's stomach jolted.
“Draco?” she shouts. Nothing.
Warm hands drove over his bottom cheeks and kneaded them tight. Growling, Draco dug his hands back into the hair, the bun half falling apart in the meantime. He felt his zipper open and groaned in relief as pants and underpants were pulled down and his hard cock finally jumped outside.
While the two men dragged Potter more than he walked himself, the black-haired Auror constantly babbled something in Italian and whimpered softly.
– that we ended up at the Black Lion?”, Draco moaned, as he felt Harry sinking to his knees in front of him, shoving his pants down under his butt. “And that I’m just randomly wearing a –
Draco sat up and switched on the lamp on the bedside table. The alcohol was still running through his veins and he rubbed his eyes. The young Auror stood in front of him like a picture of misery and trembled slightly in the coolness of the room. He looked quite unfamiliar without glasses and with the loose hair that reached over his shoulders in dark curls.
"What is it?", he asked sceptically.
But the blonde was not stupid. With two big steps of his long legs he was at the former Gryffindor, put an index finger under Harry's chin and looked him in the face.
They stood there for a while, gasping for air and trying to calm their pounding hearts. Standing there in the alley behind the pub where they first met, where Harry fell in love with Draco’s eyes and Draco fell in love with Harry’s everything. They slowly got dressed again, smiling lazily, exchanging tender kisses and loving hugs, fully captivated by the situation and the afterglows of a phenomenal orgasm.
"I'd suggest you sleep here, right? I doubt you want to go home alone now."
has to be
The tongue moves and moves till he quivers with lust and then disappears. He hears a quick whispered spell, and not even a second later Draco feels Harry’s thick, lubricated fingers against his entrance.
He held me tight. He was there and I could come down from my high.
, couldn't be serious! Such an
He finally freed my ear and I shivered as his warm breath washed over my skin. “If you come with me and behave, I might as well do something for you later…” His voice was deep and full of oh so filthy promises.
Harry grinned up to him, his teeth glowing white in the dim, filthy alley and Draco was flooded with lust and need, as Harry gripped the base of his rock-hard cock and licked over the shiny head, keeping eye contact with Draco.
Draco assisted Anthony all the time, but they didn't talk much to each other. At the end of his first shift, when the two sat in the dressing room, a little exhausted and eagerly drinking water, the blonde man felt that his counterpart was looking at him in mild disdain. That was enough for Draco. Already some time ago he had decided to no longer endure the eternal taunting and the pejorative glances.
Draco's heart made a small leap at the almost gentle "please" that came over Potter's lips.
He had patched him up three times now, but apparently Potter's gratitude wasn't long in coming. If he showed up for a fourth time in the ER, Draco decided to pass it on to a colleague. It was impossible for him to work professionally as angry as he was at the moment.
More of our horny boys.
"Top or bottom?" Harry grinned and licked away the drops of pleasure.
Draco didn't hear the rest of the conversation, so he didn't know what had happened or where Gladys sent Potter. But when Anthony shouted through the hallway only a minute later: “Hey, Blondie! Come on! There’s work to do”, the former Slytherin already had an unpleasant hunch.
Sometimes we fell behind a few steps and I gave in to the insane pleasure washing through my body. I gasped and panted, and Harry always smiled sweetly and brushed the sweaty hair out of my forehead.
Yawning and mentally cursing her best friend for his tight schedule, Pansy moves through the hall. She knocks on their guest bedroom door. “Rise and shine, blushing bride!”, she shouts through the dark wood. No answer. She knocks again, even louder this time. Still no answer.
A second and quickly a third fingers snake inside him. It’s so much and not nearly enough. Harry still moves in slow, deep thrusts. But fuck, he’s already so close. All his muscles are taut like a wire and he just
Feel free to tell me everything you think about it :D
“Harry?”, Draco asked slowly.
Pain became pleasure and Draco loved that moment when he forgot everything around him and could lose himself in the deep groan of the man behind him. It just felt incredible. Deep slow thrusts pressed Draco against the cool table top and rubbed his throbbing cock against the smooth wood again and again. Harry's hands on his back were strong and would certainly leave stains on his pale skin, but he didn't care.
"You can cook?," he asked incredulously.
, when the lyrics of the first song started and Harry’s deep voice sounded all across the pub.
“Never!” This stupid, cheeky grin. Ugh, I loved it. “Come on, let me buy you some hot cocoa!”
good for Draco. He forgot half of his guests’ orders, mixed the wrong drinks, spilled some ginger ale over a cute girl with brown bushy hair he thought he saw around Ron earlier… Jake glared at him, but he didn’t dare to scold him in front of the guests. But it didn’t matter, right? Not when Harry sang like motherfucking rock star and looked like a motherfucking model. And the way he kept looking at Draco –
– just come to me.” And with a cheeky wink and a slight touch on Harry’s forearm, Draco turned around, heart thumping like crazy.
“And do you really think it’s a coincidence –
year common room. Harry was skimming trough a quidditch magazine, lazily raking his fingers through my hair.
and just - “Please, Harry!”
"Can't remember..." His eyes were already closing again.
"You heard it, Malfoy," Weasley shouted. "Make sure you get out!"
"I can't even tell when I fell in love with you! For me it feels like my whole life. I have always fancied you. And then the war started and you saved my life - and I saved yours. I thought I would lose you after all and I really tried to forget you, but of course it didn't work with Ginny either. And then I saw you again in St. Mungo and that little flame that was still burning in me suddenly flared up like dragon fire".
are for!”
Draco panicked, trying to turn around and flee, but Pansy gripped his naked upper arm (at the same spot she had already punched four times this night) and shoved him back.
He saw Potter bite his full lower lip and wrinkle his forehead.
“Happy anniversary, love.”
The shower was incredibly good. Draco certainly stood motionless under the hot water jet for 5 minutes and washed away the day and the tension. He washed himself and ignored his somehow semi-rigid penis. In front of the mirror he shaved the fine blond stubble on his chin with a spell and creamed his sensitive skin. In the evening he liked to let his hair air dry, so he just rubbed it a little with the towel. He walked into the bedroom with the towel around his hip, but it was empty. Draco could hear quiet noises from the kitchen. He quickly put on fresh trousers and a tight black long-sleeved shirt and went barefoot into the kitchen.
