The Room must have dropped the invisible barrier it had conjured, for Draco now heard the Gryffindor pounding on the door and shouting expletives at him through the wood.
“Oh, fuuuuuckkk,” Draco moaned as Harry wrapped his hot, wet mouth around his erection. Harry groaned at the eroticism of the moment, living for the salty-sweet taste of his lover’s precum on his tongue.
“Only one way to find out, isn’t there?” Harry said and reached his hand in to retrieve the book. As soon as he pulled it out, the stones began scraping against one another again until they were back in their original positions. The cubbyhole was nowhere to be seen. Harry gently opened the book to the first page and his jaw dropped. “It

came Dragana’s heels as she strode across the bedroom and into the bathroom as Harry turned to look at her.
“Quite the contrary, Harry. I hadn’t thought it out properly, and now I’m relieved for the opportunity to take you on a second date where I get to spoil you a
(Image: Prompt 23, an outdoor ice skating rink surrounded by a string of fairy lights.  Dozens of people are dressed warmly and skating in a counterclockwise direction. There is a Christmas tree lit up in the middle and the surrounding trees around the rink are wrapped in fairy lights, up and down the trunks and branches.)
The two of them watched in astonishment as the stones next to the door scraped against each other and rearranged themselves, much like the entrance to Diagon Alley through the Leaky Cauldron. After a few seconds, the stones stopped moving. Harry quickly got up to investigate, Draco falling into step behind him.
“I was saying: I’m willing to bet you that our friends and loved ones are going to go absolutely rogue Bludger when they receive
“Agreed,” Susan said. “Coming to Hogwarts is like stepping back in time. I mean, don’t get me wrong, I do enjoy the aesthetic—but it is horribly old-fashioned and behind in so many ways.”
“Oh, yes, my sweet prince.” Harry leant down and whispered in Draco’s ear in the way he knew completely undid the former Slytherin. “How much do you want me to touch you?”
“Yes, of course,” Scorpius answered, loud enough for the adults to hear and Harry snickered while Draco bit back a smile.
“‘The war will rage between pureblood supremacists, encouraged by Salazar’s values and teachings, and the rest of the wizarding population. A dangerous man who calls himself a “lord” will collect followers and lead them in his mission to gain power.’”
Draco’s eyes darkened with lust, locking on Harry’s. He slipped his fingers out of Harry, then summoned a condom.
Harry and Malfoy were sitting across from each other at a table in the middle of the Room of Requirement. It had transformed into a comfortable meeting room of sorts. The two Eighth Years were seated at a long oak table that could easily have seated another ten people. The fire was burning and the warmth in the room stood in stark contrast to the harsh autumn wind blowing outside.
Draco’s eyes softened. He swallowed. His lips curled into the smallest of smiles and he sighed softly.
Luna continued her story where she’d left off. “So, we’re watching them scramble about the kitchen and Susan asks them ‘Why are you in such a hurry? Dinner isn’t for another five hours.’”
“Of course, Master.” The Elf grumbled a little under his breath as they made their way downstairs and to the front door, but Harry knew it was just an act.  Kreacher had perfected it over the years, and would have berated Harry strongly if he hadn’t have called on him to help check the wards.
Draco nodded. Harry sensed the love and magic reaching out from the other man, and Harry met him in the middle, mentally shifting his magic to combine with his lover’s, and the two sat on the bench, unaffected by the other wixen bustling past, in and out of the shops, all at different speeds, all with different goals for the holiday season.
Draco felt his irritation begin to mount—something that always happened around the prat. He just didn’t know how to have a civil conversation.
“I love you, Draco,” Harry whispered and inhaled deeply. Draco was wearing a new Christmas jumper from Mrs. Weasley (green and with a cauldron on the front to celebrate his new job). Harry noticed that Draco’s own scent was already emanating from the new jumper—mint, a hint of citrus, and something else—something Harry smelled nowhere else, except when he was lucky enough to be this close to his lover.
The bird didn’t respond but started singing its springtime melody once more. When it was finished, they stared at each other in silence. Finally, the bird lightly pushed off from the branch and flew away. As Draco watched, he noticed tufts and swirls of snow beginning to fall towards the Earth.
“I will.” Harry’s voice cracked and he laughed at himself before clearing his throat and repeating, “I will, Draco. Of course, I will marry you. I want to be your husband.”
Harry’s eyes widened, obviously shocked at hearing such a word come out of his mouth. He’d always used words such as “lovely” but never in his presence.
Before Harry knew it, Draco was straddling him, kissing him with great fervor, occasionally sucking or nipping at Harry’s lips.
Draco placed a hand on Harry’s knee, which was bouncing wildly, and Harry stilled. Harry brought his own hand to Draco’s and interlaced their fingers.
Her boyfriend of two years stepped out of the hearth and used his wand to magic away the leftover soot and Floo powder.
Harry rolled his eyes but scooched closer to Draco, straining his neck to get a peek at the book. Draco had turned to the same section Hermione had read aloud to them earlier that day, all about Ravenclaws architectural plans which were “too radical” or “unnecessarily problematic.”
“Tradition,” Draco said. “Especially amongst pureblood wixen. And especially due to all the witch hunts in history which forced us as all into hiding and made a Statute of Secrecy essential to our very survival.”
“Oh! Well… I suppose that’s no problem.” Instead of grabbing the book, Hermione pushed it closer to Harry so it was easier for him to take.
Draco stilled, allowing Harry to get used to the fuller feeling. Harry appreciated Draco’s patience as well as how the other man continued to stroke his cock—a familiar pleasure. After a moment, Harry was ready for more. “You can keep going,” Harry said. “I’m good now.”  Draco slid his two fingers further in, then almost out, then inside again.
All Draco could do was nod. He closed his eyes and opened his mouth obediently, but Harry had other plans. The former Gryffindor took the Room’s Christmas present and unwrapped it from his wrist. Then, very slowly, he tied it around Draco’s eyes. The blond froze for a moment, shocked at the unexpected sensation around his eyes. But the sensation building in his trousers was a lot more distracting in that moment…
“You’re right,” Dragana backpedaled, “I just meant, this is particularly splendid—you really outdid yourself this time, spoiling me. I don’t deserve this.” She tapped Harry on the shoulder so he would turn to face her. When he had, Dragana batted her eyelashes at him, and Harry couldn’t help but laugh.
Draco tamped down his nerves and excitement swirling inside him, the Snitches threatening to escape. He smiled and made to meet the former Seeker halfway.
“She didn’t really have a choice,” Draco said, glancing at Harry. “Given the rest of Ravenclaw’s prophecy.”
As they approached the door, they saw that the stones had organized themselves into a small cubbyhole—inside of which was an old-looking book with a faded leather cover.
“You’ll see soon enough,” Draco promised as he gently guided him across the Hogwarts ground towards the Great Lake. When they arrived at the water’s edge Draco stopped.
“What the bloody hell…”  Harry was sitting in the living room at Grimmauld Place, having just unwrapped the present. It was only December 6th, but Harry had snuck downstairs, leaving Draco asleep upstairs so he could sneak a peek under the tree. He was in a bit of a rush, as Draco would wake soon and come looking for him.

Harry was starting to feel more uncomfortable the more Draco explained. “I’m really sorry I opened it early. I fucked up.”
“What have you been up to?” Draco chastised, and Harry heard a hint of disappointment in his lover’s voice.
“Well, then--” Draco pulled a vial out of his trouser pocket, uncorked it, and took a quick swig. He then handed it to Harry who hesitated briefly before accepting in and taking a swig of his own, emptying the contents. He instantly felt a heat rise in his body and his clothes now seemed unbearably hot.
Harry placed his own mug back on the table. “Why are you here, Draco?” Harry asked. He made sure to sound as open and non-judgemental as possible, trying to put the other man at ease.
“Yes, Master?” He sounded exhausted and a little put out. Harry couldn’t help but smile at his curmudgeonly old house elf, who, despite everything, had really turned around and become a generous and loyal help around the house. Harry no longer viewed him as a “servant,” despite the fact that Kreacher still refused to accept a wage. He suspected that the elf deftly replaced any Galleons Harry left secretively in his room back into Harry’s own home vault.
“If I’m understanding this correctly,” Professor McGonagall said, her voice low and cautious, “what we’re seeing happening in the castle today is the activation of Ravenclaw’s enchantments? Hogwarts is determining its
about what’s impolite? After years of treating us all like second-class wixen because we aren’t pureblood like you? After years of you calling Hermione despicable slurs and making fun of me and my family for being poor? You’re a right bastard, you know that?”
“Oh!” Harry said, just remembering. “Before you took off for the dungeons, I realized the portrait of Godric Gryffindor was missing, replaced by three smaller paintings I’d never seen before.”
know you’re more than just a stubborn, ambitious little snake who will stop at nothing to get his way.”
“Oh, shove off, Draco. My Polyjuice potion is looking just fine. Believe it or not, that’s the one potion I’m actually confident in my ability to brew.”
Draco wished he could live in this moment forever. But that was what Pensieves were for—and now, it was time to go ice skating. A former Slytherin with the Golden Trio going ice-skating on Christmas Eve...and it all started with one magical moment of serendipity.
Ron’s ears went red, but he smiled back and made a gesture that Harry interpreted to mean “You’re welcome, now please can we move on?”
. His hand was already tracing its way down his body, towards his erection. When his fingers wrapped around his cock, Harry let out a low moan, biting his lip to keep himself from getting too loud. He wiped his thumb over the tip and felt the wetness of precum. Peeking out of the corner of his eye to confirm Ron was still asleep, Harry lifted his thumb to his mouth and licked off the precum, imagining it was Malfoy he was tasting.
Harry jumped and almost dropped the doll, but he quickly got a hold of himself when he realized it was just Draco who had entered the room. He turned, trying to hide the present as he did so.
“I would have never understood the epicness of this magnificent piece of architecture if you hadn’t have taken me to those places first.” Harry finally returned Draco’s grin and he felt tears form behind his eyes. “This is the most well-thought out and meaningful gift anyone could have ever given me, Draco. Thank you so much.”
In that moment, the Room conjured a book which appeared in between the two men, resting on one of the pillows.
“Oh, yeah?” Draco challenged, “Your beloved Godric had a sword that to this very day only appears to ‘true Gryffindors.’ What does that even mean? Someone who is brave? By whose standards? Not all Gryffindors are stereotypically ‘brave’ Harry, and you will find courageous people in every House.”
It was a crisp winter afternoon, and Draco was sprinting across the Hogwarts Grounds as quickly as he could manage without jostling Harry Potter’s broomstick.
Harry cleared his throat and found his voice. “No, no, it’s fine. Please, come in. We can sit in the living room and I can make us some tea.”
“She—she’s really embraced Dobby’s teachings about freedom and equality.” Hermione sniffed. “She’s actually got an old S.P.E.W. badge—Merlin knows where she found it.”
“Wait a minute, hold up!” Draco said. He’d thrown his head in his hands and was shaking it slowly, trying to digest the new information. Draco took a deep breath and exhaled, long and slow. Then he lifted his head again. “You’re telling me that Voldemort tried to cheat death by splitting his soul not once but
Harry glanced away. “I’m sorry.” He couldn’t think of another response. “Maybe I’m just really fucked up or something… but my whole life has been a prophecy so this just feels like an extension of that, I guess.”
“I didn’t quite catch that?” Harry said, biting his lip to keep from laughing and pleased Draco was blindfolded and wouldn’t catch any breaks in his façade.
Draco let out a slew of expletives as he was finally allowed to have his cock inside Harry. Harry quickly placed a hand over his mouth, firmly but tenderly encouraging his lover to stay quiet and polite if he wanted to please him.
Finally, he reached the 7th floor corridor and sprinted towards the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy. His heart practically leaped out his chest in relief when he saw the door to the Room was already there. As Draco reached out and placed his hand on the door handle, an invisible barrier popped up around him and he saw Harry rebound sharply backwards and land on his bum.
“You’re lost. Where did you go?” Draco reached out a hand and stroked his lover’s face, encouraging Harry to look him in the eyes whenever he was ready. Finally, Harry did look up and, feeling as if Draco’s eyes were holding him in a tender and safe embrace, told him all about how he'd been triggered as they’d passed the jumper kiosk, his hatred of capitalism, the pangs of grief still washing over him all these years later, the PTSD of his childhood, and the war.
“I’ll say,” Narcissa, Andromeda, and Molly said in unison, causing a burst of laughter to ripple across the table. Grimmauld Place had definitely gone through a massive transformation in the months since Dragana had moved in.
Though Harry had often thought about Draco Malfoy throughout his Hogwarts days, he’d never realized...he’d never even
“I love you, Draco,” Harry replied, and the two pulled away slightly to give each other a soft peck on the lips.
Harry joined him in fishing through the loose articles of clothing they’d strewn across the floor. When they were fully clothed once again, the two sat at the table and Harry placed the journal on the cool wooden surface.
“Tell me you don’t like kissing me, or something juvenile like that. Or—or that you…need your distance! I’ve dealt with that one before… I could do it again.”
Hearing her own laughter echo in the empty, dreary living room of Grimmauld Place caused Ginny to stop abruptly. She looked back at the tree, with its twinkling lights and magnificent ornamentation, in sudden realization.
This was from Draco after all. The prat must have had some specific reason for this gift. He remembered when they first started dating, Draco had mentioned that gift-giving at Christmas was a serious business amongst the Malfoys. Even though Harry didn’t have that same connection with the holiday, he loved Draco, and his passion and love for Christmas made him love the man even more. And Harry didn’t want to mess this up by misinterpreting and accidentally letting slip to his boyfriend that he found Nutcrackers kind of…creepy.
Harry nodded. “From what we’ve read so far, Ravenclaw had a premonition, similar to the one that led her to building Hogwarts on this very spot, which convinced her to cast her enchantments despite having been overruled by the other founders.”
“I was. During the Battle of Hogwarts, Voldemort tried to kill me in the Forest, as you know. He ended up not killing me, but that part of his soul.”
“Of course not!” said the wix with the buzz cut. “Isn’t it obvious we’re in Gryffindor?” They touched the crest on their robes and pulled it forward for Malfoy to see.
“Dragana…our song…is the sound of echoing footsteps in the deserted corridors at Hogwarts. Sneaking to the Room of Requirement all through sixth year.” Harry took a breath and continued. “When we were whispering to each other in the back of classrooms, and you spoke so slowly.” Harry moved his lips and tongue languidly around the words.

“That would be quite strange indeed,” Malfoy said, stroking his chin thoughtfully. “But then again, Slytherin went and put in the Chamber of Secrets without anyone’s knowledge.”
“This… this cannot be,” she said in astonishment. She flipped to the next pages with the detailed floor plans of Hogwarts. Finally, she glanced up at the two of them. “How—how did you find this?”
“Once again, your beautiful eye has not failed us in finding the perfect spot, love.” Draco squeezed his lover’s hand.
Draco clutched it tightly as he bolted through the snowy courtyard.  Flurries of snowflakes fluttered about him happily, enjoying the burst of energy and attention on this icy, still, and deserted day in December.
“And those neighboring columns—” Draco pointed out the columns on either side of the portico. “Their sculptures display scenes from the life of Charles Borromeo in a spiral relief. Charles, as in,
“I assure you, Professor, we are quite aware,” Harry said quickly. “However… I don’t think we really have a choice in the matter.”
He stood up, leaving Draco alone in the den with only the ticking of the grandfather clock for company. Harry sprinted up the stairs to his bedroom and retrieved a box from the floorboards under his bed.
“Hmm…neither,” Harry said, and he grabbed his wand, murmuring a banishing spell. The pants had completely vanished and Harry was staring at the magnificently erect cock of Draco Malfoy.
At the first sound of a sob, Harry turned towards her. He held out a hand and rested it on the blanket still covering Ginny’s legs. Ginny gratefully brought her own hand to rest in it as she sobbed.
“When my mother sacrificed her life for me, Voldemort’s Killing Curse rebounded. In the process, Voldemort accidentally transferred some of his powers...and part of his soul... into me.”
“And, of course, our song is the sound of the Earth’s hum. Every night, when we are preparing for bed, casting spells of protection, health, warmth, and peace around our home, hearth, and hearts. When we reconnect our magic with its source and with each other—” Dragana suddenly broke off, reaching into the Expandable Bag.
Harry reached out and retrieved the tie. He kept his eyes on Draco’s as he intently wrapped and unwrapped the tie around his own hand and wrist.
“May I help you, Mr. Potter?” A kindly elderly wix was blinking at him from behind large spectacles, bedazzled with different colored crystals: blue and silver.
Draco jumped and shivered when the light strand first touched his bare chest and arms. It was obvious he had no idea what was happening—Harry figured the texture from a strand of Christmas lights must be throwing Draco's senses through a loop.
During their free period the next afternoon, Harry, Ron, and Malfoy were sitting in the Room of Requirement, which had transformed itself back into the meeting room from last night. The three of them sat together at one end of the table, consulting
Step 1. Offer potentially messy food and drinks around precious magical garments and other items that cost hundreds, if not thousands, of Galleons.
“So… you and Luna?” Ron asked Susan as the five of them took the stairs two at a time to arrive at Slughorn’s lesson by the bell.
Harry was pulled out of the blissful memory of an hour ago by the fresh snowfall. The muggles huddling around their P
Harry flushed, but motioned towards the bed and the two of them clambered onto it. They lay down facing each other, their heads lying on the plump pillows. “Draco,” Harry said, licking his lips. “I have to tell you…” His heart was pounding in his chest. Was he really considering this?
(Image: a feminine person with long wavy brown hair and brown skin wearing white nail polish, white heels, and a blue dress. For a more detailed description of this dress, please continue reading the story!)
Harry whimpered and Dragana snickered. She bit his earlobe gently and whispered, her breath warm on Harry’s skin: “Our song is my own incoherent utterings when you take me. When you sslide your hands acrosss my body—when you sslip insside me like that ssneaky Sslytherin we both know you really are…”
There was a loud bang as one of the artisans slammed their hut shut and it startled Draco to his senses. He glared at Harry. “Come on,
Harry pondered this. “I want to be open to anything and everything,” he stated finally. “I feel as if...the world is our oyster now. You know what I mean?”
Harry was biting his lip, trying unsuccessfully to suppress his laughter as Draco stumbled over his words and rambled away, confessing much more than he’d expected.
Draco jumped over an icy patch that had almost killed him yesterday morning, and deftly maneuvered his way under the gothic clock tower, which was still ticking steadily along beneath a sheet of ice and snow. He reached the castle without drawing attention. Not that it would matter—Draco was wearing Harry’s Invisibility Cloak, having stolen it last night after their clandestine tryst in the Room of Requirement
“I apologize for the late hour. I had something…urgent to speak with you about and it couldn’t wait.”
“Oh, don’t worry, you’ll get your Crackers soon,” Harry reassured his school friends. “But first—” he flicked his wrist and summoned a beautiful Christmas cracker from the gift table. The paper was silver and glittery, small puffs of magic swirling around the ribbons tied on each end. “I have a special Christmas Cracker for you, my dear Dragana.”
After a few moments, as their heartbeats started to return to normal, Harry said, “Fuck. Draco… that was…” He trailed off, unable to come up with a suitable word.
Draco tuned out Potter’s howls, most likely aided by the Room, which no doubt had softened the volume of his knocks and bellows. He made his way to the bed where he had laid out his outfit that morning, after Harry had left. He banished the clothes he was currently wearing and reached for the first item.
Harry watched as realization dawned on Dragana’s face and tears sprang to her eyes. He used the opportunity to get down on one knee.
A shout out this time has to go out to Vukovich specifcally for finding the words and helping me describe Draco's pose for y'all ;)
Suddenly, out of the corner of his eye, Harry saw handkerchiefs appear on the table. Hermione picked one up and dabbed her eyes before retrieving another and holding it out to Harry.
“Please do.” Harry felt the wards shudder around him as they dropped briefly to let Draco step over the invisible barrier outside. A few seconds later, there was a knock on the door.
It’s been a couple weeks since Draco proposed to Harry (See: Chapter 6 "An Unexpected Christmas Gift") and they’ve been keeping it secret for a big reveal at the first ever Malfoy-Potter Christmas Party. Little does Dragana know that Harry has something up his sleeve to stir up the friendly Christmas Cracker competition they’ve got going on...
Professor McGonagall sighed. “I could have guessed. Mr. Potter, you’ve always had a knack for meddling.” Her eyes twinkled behind her spectacles, and Harry knew she wasn’t as upset as she seemed about his “meddling.”  “And now,” she continued, “you’ve drawn Mr. Malfoy into it, have you?”
Now that he was inside, he would have to be a lot more cautious. Teachers were about, as well as Mrs. Norris.  Potter had warned him that he suspected the cat could see through the Cloak.
“Why aren’t you more freaked out?” Draco asked, the words tumbling from his mouth and then gasping for breath again.
“Malfoy, anyone with eyes can see that something is going on at Hogwarts. Tell me something I don’t know. Like why you’re skulking around in the middle of the night and sneaking off to random parts of the castle. You’re acting just as suspicious as you were in Sixth Year, and we all know how
Harry and Draco were planning how best to tell everyone they were now engaged and had been constructing an elaborate reveal for their first ever Christmas Party.
Draco’s mouth dropped open. “What are you, five?” Draco glared at Harry, and though it was the same glare Harry had been seeing since Hogwarts, it still irritated him. He glared back.
Draco placed the Nutcracker gently on the table, as not to jostle the ring, and wrapped Harry in another hug.
Harry was wearing a green Christmas jumper, most likely knitted by the Weaselette’s mother. It had a fiery red phoenix on the chest, and Draco couldn’t help smiling. He sometimes wished his mother would make him stuff like that.
“I’m glad you took me shopping today,” Harry repeated. “I got to be with my favorite person. Actually be...myself. And I appreciate you so much.”
Harry felt the magical wards protecting Grimmauld Place trigger and he froze. He hadn’t been expecting anyone so late. Who did he know who would call on him so late?
Dragana (trans/gender fluid Draco) and Harry are taking a ride on the Firebolt. It’s midnight on Rosh Chodesh, and the two get talking about “their” song.
As Harry kissed his boyfriend in the Room of Requirement that Christmas, he recalled how he had stolen his first kiss from Draco just a few feet away from where they were sitting now, during Sixth Year.
Harry and Dray attempt to have a Christmas quickie before their guests arrive--but due to distractions they might very well be late for their own party…

Draco nodded quickly and the long ends of the tie swayed back and forth with the bobbling of the former Slytherin’s head.
Draco flipped past the floorplans of Hogwarts and saw Ravenclaw’s curly script again. He read aloud, “‘I am highly disappointed in my fellow founders, who are insistent that we restrict the flexibility of the floorplan of Hogwarts. I believe from the bottom of my heart that the walls and magic of Hogwarts should be malleable and adapt with the times. The world is ever-changing and, in my ideal vision, Hogwarts is too. Though I agree with the educational system we are setting up, I know that the needs and desires of young magical folk will not be the same 50 years, 100 years, and especially 1000 years from now. Unfortunately, the others do not deem this an important consideration as we finalize the plans for our school.’”
“Where are you right now?” Draco asked. He had stopped them in their tracks, tilted his head, and looked as though he were trying to read Harry’s face. Having found something obviously amiss, he gently guided him to an empty bench nearby, just outside their destination: "Ye Olde Drinking Chocolate." They had just turned the corner. The jumper kiosk, which had been the catalyst for Harry’s latest spiral was now out of sight. But not out of mind.
Draco nodded. “I know I give off that impression. But… despite what I’ve always been taught to believe, I think there are traits in all houses we should all wish to emulate in different situations. Anyways—” He turned back to Susan. “As much as I value learning more about Hogwarts founders, I assume there is a reason you are mentioning this to us. And a reason you were looking for more information about her today, just as Hermione was aiming to check out that biography about Rowena Ravenclaw.”
Draco felt tears well up in his eyes as a grin spread across his face. “Too right, Harry…” And he kissed him. Draco gently pulled the other wix closer to him by their entwined hands, and Harry happily obliged, closing the distance between them. Draco was slightly taller, and he relished the fact that he got to enjoy Harry looking up at him in adoration for a brief second before their lips touched.
Either way, Susan took a deep breath and when she spoke again, she seemed to be calmer. “I’m not sure if you know this, but Helga Hufflepuff was exceptionally talented in food-related charms and created many of the recipes that are still used to this day at Hogwarts feasts. She also set up the House Elf contingent here, giving them a safe—well, a
Hermione nodded, then looked to be considering something. Finally, she held out her hand to Malfoy. “Draco, I accept your apology.”
Draco’s eyebrows were low and pulled close together, his lips drawn in tightly with the corners of his mouth drawn slightly downwards. When he noticed Harry looking at him, he neutralized his expression and said in a low voice, leaning towards him, “You alright, Harry?”
“How—Draco, the market is closing…” Harry trailed off and gestured towards the muggles who were packing up their little wooden huts. The muggle who had sold them the nuts was struggling with the metal hinges on theirs and couldn’t lock the window. Harry couldn’t resist using a bit of wandless magic. He lightened the burden on the contraption, which then glided smoothly into place on the muggle’s next attempt.
“Fine,” Harry grumbled, and his petulance was so cute, Dragana had to bite her lip to stop herself from laughing and swooping around to kiss away his pout.
“Kreacher shall make the tea, Master.” Kreacher frowned at Harry. “You and your guest should go relax in the den.”
“I’m almost done, I promise,” Dragana kissed the nape of Harry’s neck. “Our song is the gasp that escaped my lips, the day you told me you chose me and our life together over everything you’d ever known and loved and cherished so deeply. I couldn’t believe I was worth it.”
“Of course, I knew it was you,” Malfoy said. Then he added, so softly Harry wasn’t sure if he had heard him properly, “How could I not have?”
I've been a little down about the Christmas markets being closed this year due to COVID regulations. By diving into this story I was able to capture some of the magic one feels when visiting a Viennese Christmas market, and I hope you all enjoyed this romantic advent story for Draco and Harry <3 xo
Harry wished he could stop Ron from digging this hole, but once his best mate got going it was nearly impossible to stop him without ending up in the hole with him.
“I swear to Merlin this Room is ALWAYS on your side,” Draco mumbled, but his arousal was unmistakable as he practically salivated, looking at the Room’s most recent gift—an immensely kitschy improvised toy—a green tie with golden snitches bedecked in red Father Christmas hats.
landing arse-first in my mother’s favorite rose bush, and yowling so loudly, Hildegarde, the house elf, couldn’t help but notice you. Our song is your magnificent yelp as thorns scraped your skin, and how horrified poor Hildegarde looked as Monsieur Rudolph’s nose bobbed right out and tapped her own nose as she came to your aid. Our song is my riotous laughter tumbling down from the balcony as you scowled and harrumphed away, only to return the very next night. ”
The thought startled him, and he felt his cheeks instantly burn with embarrassment, and was beyond grateful that no one seemed to notice, intent as they were on Susan.
Harry didn’t say anything. Instead, he turned his gaze to the fireplace, watching the flames lick the wooden logs and stretch up along the stone chimney.
Harry laughed lightheartedly, knowing Draco trusted him and didn’t believe Harry would actually cause a scene in front of the muggles. But what in Merlin’s name was an

missing and would discover it had been Draco. The Slytherin attempted to even out his breath, regretting not having warmed up beforehand.
“Hmm. Well, either way, it’s incredibly hot,” Draco said as his hand began to sneak its way down Harry’s abdomen.
Dragana’s face flushed but she dropped her arms and spread them in front of her as she did a slow twirl. Harry’s mouth dropped in awe as his eyes caught sight of the blue ribbons lacing up the back of the bodice.
He expected the First Years’ crests to be red, gold, and silver with a lion perched on its hind legs. However, he saw it was bright yellow, black and grey with a badger in the center.
Draco swallowed painfully over the lump in his throat and pointed his wand at the patch of snow he’d been sitting on. He said the incantation for a hot air charm, causing the snow to melt away and reveal the Earth underneath. Then, he sat down, defiantly.
“Draco? Draco’s here?” Harry asked. Though their friendship had grown immensely over the past couple months, Draco had never actually taken him up on any of his invitations to come to Grimmauld Place.
“To walk with?! Aren’t they… worried about people spilling on…I dunno, a thousand-Galleon set of robes?”
Ginny nodded slowly as the words traveled across the length of the sofa, twisted into her ears, and the meaning behind them dawned upon her.
he was sure about. Yeah, it had taken him some time to come to terms with his sexuality, with help and support from Ron and Hermione—but that he might actually be attracted to Malfoy?
Harry’s heart pounded fast and hard against his chest; he wouldn’t have been surprised if the other man could hear it. Harry looked intently at Draco, losing himself in those beautiful grey kaleidoscope eyes and catching his own reflection. Harry squeezed Draco’s hand. Draco squeezed back.

Harry looked sharply back at Malfoy. “Of course not. Do you know how hard I—” he cut himself off, his cheeks burning red. Harry willed them to not give himself away.
“Wish you could see how beautiful you--" Before Harry could finish the thought, a polaroid camera appeared where the Christmas lights had nearly half an hour ago.
“Yes! You only get one extra special wish with the extra special magic of the First Snowfall and I don’t want to waste it on the wrong thing!”
“The usual,” Harry repeated and though Draco wasn’t looking at him in that moment, he heard a smile in the former Gryffindor’s voice.
“Yes, love,” Draco said and mimicked casting a locking spell on his lips. Or at least, that’s what Harry assumed he was doing. It could have been something very sexual, and Harry had to bite his lip to keep from laughing and stay on topic.
“Where are we going?” Harry grumbled. Draco had invited him on a date—however, when he’d said Saturday morning, Harry didn’t think he'd meant at

The dining room rang out in a chorus of cheers as Dragana tugged Harry off the ground and crashed her lips to his, sealing their engagement for a second time, pouring every ounce of love and trust into Harry, and feeling her fiancé return in kind.
“I know we’re both wizards,” Draco finally began, his gaze unfaltering. “But you need to stop living in this fantasy land.”

When Draco reached a hand up to cup Harry’s balls, Harry gasped and said, “Merlin, Draco…” His legs were shaking fiercely now and he knew he was closer to coming than he’d like. I don’t know how much longer I can…”
“Take off your trousers,” Harry ordered. “Leave your pants on. For now…” The other man quickly obeyed and struggled a little in his haste to unbutton and remove his trousers, while blindfolded.
“You’re right, it was,” Hermione said. She sounded thoughtful, and she kept looking back and forth between Harry and Malfoy. Her expression was similar to the one she sported when she was stumped by a particularly difficult exam question. “You trust him,” she said finally. Her statement was aimed at Harry.
“You know, this church is considered architect J.B. Fischer’s greatest work,” Draco had explained, “And it’s not too difficult to comprehend why. As you can see—” Draco looked up at the building in awe as he held both arms open, presenting the church to Harry, who bit his lip attempting not to laugh at his lover who was taking his tour very seriously.
“It was Winky,” Hermione explained quickly and gave them both a sad smile. “I must admit I started crying as well. Those socks she was wearing? One was mustard yellow and one was violet. Your Christmas gifts to Dobby. And the tea cozy certainly looked like it was one I had knitted back in Fourth Year.”
“Look up,” Draco whispered. When Harry did, he saw the full moon right above them shining brightly over the water.
“Hi. Harry,” Draco said, voice slightly shaky and Harry could sense something was amiss as soon as Draco greeted him.
“I’m just suggesting a friendly…competition. To see whose Christmas crackers our guests like more. You don’t know—I could end up surprising you. And if I don’t, and they’re bloody awful, you win. You get to oversee the Christmas crackers every year until we die. Sound good?”
His lover lightly squeezed his hand and Harry took the opportunity to glance down at their intertwined fingers. For a brief second, he blissfully noticed he couldn’t tell which were his and which were Draco’s. And he knew. He knew he’d found his family at last.
“I want—could you please—choke me while I come? Sir?” Draco’s cheeks had flushed red as he asked the question, and Harry considered. Or at least he pretended to consider, tracing his fingers around his lover’s collarbone and neck.
Draco let out a sigh that showed his complete and utter frustration. “For fuck's sake, Potter. I said stop teasing!”
“Sorry,” he apologized, “I just…never thought I’d hear Mal—Draco thanking someone for comparing him to any founder other than Slytherin.”
Harry moaned as Draco continued, keeping a slow and steady rhythm. Then, as Harry got used to his finger, Draco pressed it down, then he pressed up, gently massaging Harry in all directions. Soon, Harry found himself moving with Draco, trying to increase the sensations he felt.
advertisement for days—the magazine would have been badly crinkled if it hadn’t been printed on smudge and wrinkle resistant paper.
Draco suddenly halted, and Harry almost lost his balance as he tried to continue walking forward without him. A hand reached out and steadied him, and Harry readjusted the Cloak.
Harry’s jaw dropped open and his head fell forward slightly. “Are you kidding me? It’s midnight! There’s… so many things that could go wrong...”
“You’ve locked yourself up in this house, haven’t been on any dates whatsoever, and it’s been nearly a year. Besides me, you hardly see anyone anymore. I know you hung out with Ron and Hermione last weekend, but...you’ve only really been spending time with them once or twice a month ever since the break-up. She’s not coming back, Harry. Ginny’s not going to make you happy.”
The two settled down on a soft blanket in front of the fireplace, Harry leaning his head on the other man's chest. Snow was falling outside the windows, and it felt like the warmest, most tender Christmas Harry had ever celebrated.
Harry led them towards the Grand Staircase, all the while trying to ignore how being so close to the other man caused Draco’s scent to overwhelm his senses. Fuck, Harry was really falling for Draco. Hard. Feet first. And gathering speed. He couldn’t help but wonder if it really was so sudden...or if it was over seven years in the making.
“I’m sorry, I was just taken aback is all. What did you say?” Harry had definitely forgotten by now.
Draco did not speak. He couldn’t. He could only attempt and fail to stifle a moan, which Harry took as confirmation.
Draco knelt on the floor near the center of the room, straddling the broom, and gently lifted off, letting his knees bend softly in mid-flight.  One hand wrapped fingers around the broom handle in front of him suggestively, and he bit his lip at the sight.  Shoulders back, other hand tipping the witch's hat, he hoped he would depict a strong “Yes, I know what I’m doing” when Harry entered the room.
“Definitely. But first I’d like to get dressed…” Draco’s arms had broken out in gooseflesh since they’d left the warmth of the blankets.
He was finally happy. He’d started smoking marijuana around 9 months ago, and since then he was able to get out of his depression slump, and tackle the things that had been terrifying him for the past two years. Things like finally following his dream of becoming a Potions Master. He was in his first year of an accelerated two-year program, thanks to the expertise lent to him in private lessons with Severus Snape.
Draco’s smile stretched from ear to ear, his own cheeks shimmering with tears as he retrieved the engagement ring from the Nutcracker.
“Not to mention,” Malfoy said, “how are the stone walls reconfiguring themselves and completely altering the basic structure of the castle? It sounds like the other founders wanted to stop precisely that from happening and that’s why only Ravenclaw’s plans for the s
“The Room has always taken good care of us,” Draco whispered and then nibbled Harry’s earlobe gently, making the former Gryffindor moan aloud.
Finally, he looked up at Harry, who was smiling. “So what do you think’s going to make me happy, Draco?” He reached out and held Draco’s arm again.
“You’re not…disappointed that I ruined the second part of our date?” Harry asked, he still looked sheepish and guilty, and Draco put his hand to Harry’s cheek in a soft caress.
Harry gestured at all of Dragana in a slightly clumsy fashion and she couldn’t help but let out a laugh and emotional sniffle.
“I love it,” Harry managed to whisper back, and snuggled into Draco’s chest. Draco placed his arms around Harry and held him close.
Draco looked at Harry’s hand, and then met his eyes. “I… felt something. Inside. Something tugging at my very core. My magical core.”
“They make several, Harry. You’re going to have to be more specific,” Draco teased, and though Harry rolled his eyes, he had to admit that Draco’s teasing was starting to stir a vastly different reaction inside him…
Neither Harry nor Malfoy said anything. Though they had discussed what they would say when they ran into Ron and Hermione, Harry hadn’t expected it would be
Ron and Hermione returned to the couch and Harry and Malfoy sat in the two armchairs on either side of it. They filled them in on what had happened the other night—the missing and frozen portraits and running into the First-Year Gryffindors with Hufflepuff badges in the dungeons. Harry admitted he’d been following Malfoy because he seemed suspicious, but he and Malfoy had agreed to move forward and put their pasts aside to work together on this mystery.
“I love you,” Harry murmured into Draco’s chest. He held his breath. There was no going back now. How would Draco react? It was fast… he could admit that. But if he was being honest with himself, he realized now his previous obsessions with Draco weren’t strictly platonic. Seconds ticked by as he waited for Draco’s response.
Draco nodded slowly. “Yeah. Why not? Actually…” Draco reached out towards the Nutcracker and then presented it to Harry. He was holding it so securely, Harry knew Draco didn’t expect him to take the Nutcracker from him, but rather watch.
Draco chuckled and curled his fingertips inside Harry, who moaned again and leaned into the fingers, encouraging Draco to go deeper. “It feels… so different,” Harry admitted. “But amazing.” He pressed his lips to Draco’s neck.
“Hmm…” Susan was squinting at the author’s photo at the back of the book. Rowan was dressed smartly in dress robes and was posing with their hands on their hips. After a couple moments, Rowan put their hand on their chin in a pensive pose. Apparently, Rowan couldn’t take themselves seriously, and almost immediately burst out in silent laughter, shaking their head and waving their hand dismissively.
“So ahead of her time,” Draco said. “I’ve never seen such progressive opinions in any wixen history book. I’m not surprised her ideas were rejected by the other founders.”
we should probably head back to the dormitory and sleeeeeep.” He drew out the last word for emphasis and Draco chuckled.
Step 3. Show off their impressive wand and spell work that (oh, imagine that!) must go into each and every one of the items they sell at "Harrodz."
Harry’s eyebrows nearly jumped off his face. “Seriously? Were you coming down here to sneak peeks too?”
When Harry didn’t immediately challenge him, Draco seemed to relax a little, and continued. “It felt like my magic had connected with Hogwarts’ magic or something. So, I’m standing there, and I just feel this inexplicable tug...or force. Like Hogwarts is trying to communicate something to me. I reach out and touch the stone wall.” Draco paused and pressed his palm to the stone floor beneath him. He was biting his lip, brow furrowed in concentration.
“It will be an adventure, Harry, come on! And Vienna is one of the safest cities in the world...” Draco trailed off and exhaled deeply as realization hit him.
“Anything about wixen shitting themselves in the stairwells?” Harry asked, returning to a more comfortable position, resting on the headboard.
Draco raised an eyebrow in a perfectly Malfoyish fashion. "Drinking chocolate and christmas tree chopping with my mother. A family tradition?"
It took Harry a minute or so to pull himself together and then he folded the handkerchief and placed it in his robes. He sensed Draco looking at him and turned towards him.
The unmistakable voice of Harry Potter rang out and echoed in the nearly empty entry hall. The Gryffindor was livid, his face red and a snarl contorting his gorgeous face.
Harry sighed in frustration. “Slytherin was a pureblood supremacist who didn’t care what the other founders thought. He didn’t care to work with the others, and single-handedly decided he would stop at nothing to ensure those he thought ‘unworthy’ wouldn’t be able to study at Hogwarts. The other founders weren’t like that. They didn’t believe in dividing people up like that.”
Harry’s left hand was casually extended forward, gripping the exquisite broom handle. The veins in his arm were accentuated by the firelight coming from the lantern they had magically affixed about a foot from the handle’s edge. Harry’s right arm reached around and gently squeezed Dragana’s thigh. Dragana felt her heart begin to hammer in her chest. This had been such a magnificent idea, except…
“Hmm,” Harry said, and turned the page for more information, but only saw the next section. “But if this is true, then how could the Gryffindor Common Room move from the seventh floor to the dungeons?”
“Oh, no?” Harry couldn’t believe that after two years, Draco had finally got him hooked on this stuff too.
, then. I got suspicious. I was immediately thrown back to Sixth Year. But that wasn’t fair to you. Especially because I... I do trust you. And I have trusted you. For a while now.”
Draco is bolting across the Hogwarts Grounds with Harry Potter’s broomstick, invisibility cloak and Marauders’ Map. When Harry catches up with him in the entry hall, he chases him all the way to the 7th Floor corridor where Draco locks himself in the Room of Requirement. But what is Draco’s plan? ;)
Draco didn’t know where those cheesy as hell words had come from. But as they fell from his lips, they knew they were true.
of nothing else other than Draco’s lips pressing against his. Slowly, they began to find a rhythm and Harry brought his free hand, shaking slightly, to rest on Draco’s cheek.
“Not only difficult, but nigh on impossible, I’d say,” Harry said. “But we should probably wait until tomorrow to talk to McGonagall. Like I mentioned,
“Don’t push yourselves,” Draco had warned them, when the boys had revealed their desire a couple weeks ago to cast the spell independently this year. A few more ground rules were discussed, but, in the end, Draco was honestly immensely proud of his children for taking a leap of faith and trusting their magic.
“Ron! It’s fine. You’re fine,” Susan reassured him. “To answer your question, Luna and I have been seeing each other since the beginning of term. We’re in the Divination Club together.”
lay, undamaged,  a few inches away from Draco, who, with seeker reflexes, reached out and grabbed it just as Potter was approaching. He hopped to his feet, groaning inwardly due to the residual pain from the fall.
“Thanks. Well, it really shouldn’t be possible for these enchantments to be breaking! In Chapter 7 of
“This is a good one!” Draco defended himself. “I was going to say that—oh, shut up, Potter,” Draco glared at Harry again, less lovingly than before, but, of course, any of the malice that he had felt for the man as a teenager was also clearly absent.
Ginny realized that, for the last couple minutes at least, she’d been able to forget. Forget that things were not as perfect as the memories of her childhood Christmases.
“No,” Harry whispered in disbelief, feeling lightheaded. “She… she isn’t predicting what we just went through, is she?”
surprise, which had given him time to mentally prepare for it before they had even left Grimmauld Place. But
Finally, Malfoy said, “Well. If you don’t regret it, then you must have trusted me. Or was everything you said during the trial just… a lie… or a.... publicity stunt?”
After several minutes, Ginny was able to breathe more freely. She grabbed her wand from the table next to the sofa and cast a gentle nasal clearing spell. She took a deep breath, filling her lungs. She expelled the breath.
Next, a sinfully short black leather skirt. He’d decided against any sort of undergarment. Draco slipped it over his skinny hips and, noticing how his cock and balls peeked out, flushed.
“Good. Just relax…” Harry slowly began to trace his fingers along his lover’s face…his jawline….his neck…his collarbone. Draco shuddered.
Dragana felt the tears forming in her eyes and was powerless to stop them from dripping down her cheeks, splashing down the front of her sapphire blue bedazzled jacket. She quickly rubbed her face on Harry’s back, and took a deep breath to steady herself, wanting to hear, and
Harry couldn’t pinpoint exactly how Hermione was feeling. She certainly had every reason to seem perplexed, concerned, and maybe even a bit put out at having waited up for him worrying. But she kept her face placid, looking up at him from the couch expectantly.
“Hmm.” Professor McGonagall looked between Harry and Draco. “You do realize that as head of this school I have everything under control regarding this ‘mystery’ as you call it? I have an investigative team working around the clock responding to incidents and keeping Hogwarts in running order.”
If possible, Harry was even more embarrassed about Dragana’s description of the song of their sex life than the humiliating rose bush story.
Draco’s moans were the loudest yet, and Harry could tell he’d pushed him so close to coming already. He quickly stopped rubbing his partner’s shaft, climbed on top of Draco, and slid himself slowly and teasingly onto Draco’s cock.
Draco rolled his eyes and smiled. “I know you do. You told me this morning after I’d prepared your morning tea.”
“And so am I. And our lives and our love are so complex and I know that…with you I’ll never be bored. You’re witty, clever, humorous, and terribly dirty-minded, I don’t think anyone here knows that, but it is
“Harry,” Draco put his hands on the former Gryffindor’s shoulders and brought his grey eyes to meet Harry's emerald green ones. “This is one of those ‘you forgot you were a wizard’ moments. Do you want to try again?”
“Potter, you haven't even taken one step inside yet. Come, let’s start with a hot chocolate to walk with.”
“Of course, my sweet prince.” Harry banished the lights and Draco stretched, testing his freedom after being restrained. Harry made sure to kiss all the spots that looked particularly red and irritated from the unorthodox binding.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow, and it was Harry’s turn to blush. “I mean—” he stumbled over his words as he tried to clarify, “I meant, the only
“Take me, then,” Harry said and crashed his lips to Draco’s. As they snogged, Draco slid a leg between Harry’s.
Draco’s tone seemed extra gentle to Harry, an observation which amused him. Had Draco noticed Susan’s awkwardness and tried to make her feel more comfortable?
Thank you so much to both my betas, crazybutgood and Vukovich for helping me create the epicness that is this one (two?!) shot (excerpt of a longer fic?!)! <3
Please keep in mind: I am personifying magic in this chapter. Magic is represented in a visual way and the two of them can perceive it. They also have a very intense magical connection. These are things I would love to explore in a longer fic, but in this one shot I figured giving you a heads up would be better than going into all of that right now. I'll expand later, I promise ;)
Suddenly, Harry felt a distinct rush of arousal flow through him and to his cock which twitched eagerly.
The amount of betrayal and anger...it affects her mental health and her control of her own magic. This story was just begging for me to tell it, so I hope people will forgive me that, athough this is for my Drarry Drabble collection, this one is all about GINNY.
“Yes,” Harry said, flipping through to the chapter on upkeep. “That, too. Alright. Here it is: ‘Waste at Hogwarts is most often collected in bins by the students and staff members and later Vanished by the team of House Elves during their clandestine nightly cleanings. The staff and older students who have mastered the Vanishing Spell (
It was, without a doubt, the strangest gift he had ever received. And he had received some very weird Christmas presents over the years—a fifty-cent piece, a toothpick, and a single tissue from the Dursleys, to name a few. Oh, and of course Dobby the House Elf had painted a portrait of Harry when he was 15. Although he’d found it weird at the time and hadn’t appreciated its uniqueness, Harry had grown immensely fond of it over the years and it was currently hanging in the upstairs bathroom. Maybe…he’d feel that way about this gift in a few years?
Still, Draco did not respond, but kept holding space for Harry, his memories, his emotions. As Harry had done for him many times before and would continue to do throughout their relationship.
“Me, too.” Draco’s hand wandered down Harry’s stomach and slid between them so as to have better access to Harry’s cock.
Harry smiled, “I mean, it’s not poisoned, obviously, but…” he took a sip of his own tea and grimaced. “It tastes like Kreacher made it. And he hates tea.”
Finally, Draco cleared his throat. “Sounds hot. My very own lumberjack. Please tell me you’ll wear flannel.”
Harry wasn’t sure what to do. The Room had obviously set themselves up for a..um..very romantic Christmas evening together. The fireplace was burning, and the magical atmosphere of the room sizzled as Harry took in all the lovely decorations.
“Oh, wow.” Harry had been standing a good two meters from the left column and he bent back to admire the magnificent piece of architecture from the bottom up.
“I already told you. It wasn’t moving.” Draco’s voice had risen slightly and Harry shushed him before pulling them both into the Trophy Room and shutting the door quietly behind them.
They were silent for a moment and Draco became highly aware that they were still holding hands — which were growing ever warmer — in front of dozens of strangers, as well as Weasley and Granger. He was also aware of how
“So you’ve mentioned, I believe. Once or twice.” Draco winked at Albus Severus, who struggled to wink back, giving an odd quick blink with both eyes. But Draco nodded and put his right thumb and forefinger together. Perfect, he mouthed, and the young Potter’s eyes lit up.
Draco narrowed his eyes, “You’re so confusing, Potter. We didn’t actually go shopping, or is your memory that short?”
“I love how I can undo you with just a simple touch.” Harry smiled, though his partner could not see him, and Draco moaned in reply.
A robin fluttered from a top branch and landed on one lower to the ground, directly in Draco’s line of sight.
Harry bit his lip, flushing. “I wouldn’t count your Snitches, my little prince…” His voice was soft and Dragana had to lean in to hear him properly.

“I want you inside me,” Harry whispered back, his voice shook a little, but he was certain in his choice.
Harry stepped away from his lover’s body, quite aware that this would disorient him and sneakily put his lips to Draco’s ears. “You’re absolutely gorgeous.”
“You’re acting mighty suspicious right now, you know that?” Harry said, his voice sharp with annoyance.
“No, Harry,” Ginny said, and she extracted her hands from his, before scooching away from him towards one end of the sofa.
“Did you open it?” Draco asked, his voice low and shaky. Harry squeezed his lover’s hand, not sure why he was so nervous about this particular gift.
” Dragana snarled. She scooped the skirt up with a flourish and inspected it for harm. Seeing nothing, she huffed and let it fall. The tulle floated back down to the floor and Dragana punched Harry in the arm.
“Wha—?” Harry began, but then Draco’s lips were on his. The way Draco kissed him made Harry go lightheaded and weak in the knees. It seemed the other man was trying to convey as much love as possible as he kissed him underneath the Invisibility Cloak, and Harry’s heart skipped a beat. Surprising himself, he felt tears welling in his eyes and returned the kiss, matching Draco’s intensity.
“Oh my God, that’s… that’s perfect,” Harry shivered and then gasped loudly as Draco hit a new spot inside him.
Luna added, “That giggling pear is just the sweetest thing I’ve seen in a Hogwarts portrait, I must admit.”
The room had fallen silent, obviously sensing the mood shift and Dragana slowly reached for the ribbons on the Cracker, untying the knot with a gentle tug. In that instant, the paper disappeared—a white Christmas rose was in its place, and at the center of the rose rested a radiant deep blue oval-cut sapphire set in a white gold band. At its appearance, gasps rang out throughout the room, but Dragana’s eyes were fixated on the ring. The jewel was held in a prong setting, encircled by fourteen white round diamonds.
Hope you enjoyed it! I drew the Ace of Pentacles from my Tarot deck, and took that as inspiration to write about their first year working at Hogwarts together <3
Harry nodded eagerly, his nerves still gnawing at him, but not in a way that made him want to change his mind.
“I’m here. You can tell me anything.” Harry squinted, “Everything is okay, isn’t it? You’re not…no one’s hurt or in—in trouble are they?”
“Yes, Draco, me.” The former Slytherin joined him in his laughter, and soon the two were gasping for air, trying to get themselves back under control.
“Good boy,” Harry said. He reached out to retrieve the Christmas lights the Room had thoughtfully provided for them.
“It’s true!” Hermione said. “Why haven’t they tried to adapt instruction given the advancements in education in the past 1000 years? Especially considering there’s so much more technology now.”
“No, it’s okay. It’s good I told you. That I... talked about it a little bit.” Harry shivered and tried to snap himself back to the present. “Anyway, the reason I brought it up was simply because—obviously, I had to destroy those objects. I wish we could find this journal, too… but actually
“I wish I could,” Malfoy said, “but I’m just a lowly detective with barely a scrap of evidence.” Malfoy turned back to Harry, gently resting his gaze upon him once again. “Perhaps if I had a partner.”
Hermione was waiting for him in the Eighth-Year common room, Ron had fallen asleep on her lap and awoke with a loud snort at his girlfriend’s words.
Harry’s irritation quickly subsided. “I’m sorry I tried to guilt-trip you. I just…was a little embarrassed, I guess. At being caught.”
He took the slightly tangled Christmas lights and found one end. Harry bit his lip, trying to determine what design would make Draco look the most radiant. Inspiration hit him and he got the rahter long, singular string of lights and prepared to bind his lover. It only took about 30 seconds, but Draco was antsy the whole time, and Harry could tell that it took all of his lover’s willpower to keep silent, stay patient.
It was the truth. He honestly couldn’t recall ever having been so taken away by Harry’s beauty before. Of course, at Hogwarts, Draco had always thought Potter was stunning, wicked hot, and breath-takingly sexy depending on the day and his level of arousal. But today…he caught Harry’s eye and the wix stopped laughing with his friends, his eyes widening and jaw dropping in utter surprise.
Draco let out a needy moan and let go of Harry’s hand to run both his hands through Harry’s hair. Without warning, Draco began to tug at Harry’s hair and move closer, causing Harry to moan in surprise.
And for some reason Malfoy growled Harry’s surname at him and narrowed his eyes in annoyance. “In case you haven’t noticed, things are not as they should be at Hogwarts.”
Harry felt his cheeks start to warm. “I am,” he confessed. Harry placed the Nutcracker on the table, facing them. Instead of looking at Draco, he looked into the Nutcracker’s eyes and explained, “I know how important Christmas is to you, and how seriously you and your family have always taken gift-giving. I just… wanted to be prepared and give you the appreciation you deserve after putting so much thought into your gifts for me.”
“I’m glad,” Draco said, and flicked his thumb over the head of Harry’s cock, wiping away some precum. Then, Draco put his thumb to his lips and licked it, eyes locked on Harry. The sight made Harry’s cock twitch.
“Yes. Yes, of course they are,” Harry reassured, and leaned in to kiss him. Of course. Of course, he knew his answer. As he pulled away from his lover and their eyes locked, he knew Draco knew, too.
“Come on, Potter,” Malfoy said, and to Harry’s utter shock he saw Malfoy holding out his hand to him.
Before Harry had time to register that Draco’s thigh was leaving, he felt a warm hand press against the tent in his trousers.
It was a totally random act of serendipity. Draco had just been wandering around the park, high as a kite (as had become tradition on his evening walks). Others might think it was a little sad that Draco was walking around high and alone in a crowded place on Christmas Eve. But honestly, Draco was feeling
“Luna and I were in the same section,” Susan explained, her voice a little shaky, “looking up some information on Helga Hufflepuff.”
“Winky told us that apparently the charms on the flatware are acting incredibly finicky. And the magical enchantment connecting the Great Hall tables and those in the kitchen is apparently weakening with every meal.”
Soon, Draco laid his head on Harry’s lap, a favorite position of his. He shivered and the Room provided a blanket, covering the both of them in the same moment as it appeared. Draco made himself comfortable, wrapping the blanket tightly and nuzzling closer to Harry, who smiled at the sight.
The crystal seller flushed pink, as did Harry. Harry hadn’t been very public about his love life, but it was public knowledge that he and Draco were in a relationship of sorts. Despite his embarrassment he couldn’t help smiling and leaning forward.  “Yes, it is indeed for a lover.”
“You alright, baby?” Harry must have noticed Dragana’s change in demeanor as the thought floated in her mind. “Something wrong?” Harry stroked Dragana’s thigh.
“Thank you, Kreacher.” Harry smiled, trying to hold back a laugh, but all Kreacher did was grumble about heading back to bed.
Harry weakly reached his arms out for Draco, who quickly climbed into them. Harry buried his head in Draco’s chest, clutching the other man tightly to him.
Harry’s felt a hot flush spring up around his chest and neck. “Yes.” Harry tried again to get closer, but to no avail. He whimpered again.
Draco pulled Harry closer to him and Harry decided to lift his legs, wrapping them around Draco’s waist. He brought his forehead to Draco’s and sighed happily, completely content in this moment.
It’s date night! In Hogsmeade? Harry muses about where Draco might be taking him and he’s stunned when they arrive…
“Actually, Professor,” Harry said, “in the interest of full disclosure, I had been following Draco because I thought he was behind it all.”
“Hmm…now I’m not sure I should. I don’t think you really want it,” Harry teased, hoping for Draco to take bait. He was not disappointed.
“Oh, baby, you know I will.” Harry winked at him. Little strands of excitement, hope, and arousal wrapped around the grief and anxiety which, momentarily felt more grounded and peaceful inside him than just five minutes ago.
When he finally calmed down a little and settled into his improvised seat in the snow, he realized how still the evening was. The silence was broken only by the melody of a single bird. He tilted his head up and noticed the glistening branches of a tree hanging above and around him. They were frozen, the frost seemingly having caught them by surprise. The deadheads were locked in icy cages. The sight was breath-taking, but Draco couldn’t help but wonder if the tree found the sensation unnerving or not.
“Our song is all of those things, yes…but it’s also your feet thumping through the Malfoy Grounds under your Invisibility Cloak, sneaking your way to my bedroom, putting on those reindeer underpants—“ Harry made an undignified squawk. “Yes, Harry…those reindeer underpants with your cock so tastefully filling in the fabric to form—”
This…was just particularly difficult for Harry. This shopping thing. This…Christmas thing. And Harry understood why Draco loved this department store. He could tell that if he were coming at this from Draco's perspective, having grown up in a traditional pureblood family, there was a lot of magic and tradition revolving around Christmas that Harry didn’t understand. Yet, Harry was working on it, because for the first time in his life, he wanted to create his own family traditions.
“And you risked your life by lying to the other Death Eaters. If it weren’t for you... everything would have been different.”
It's Christmas Eve. Harry has just returned home, and it soon becomes painfully clear that Harry's breaking up with her. And if it's for the reason she thinks it is, she doesn't want to know the truth. She'd rather he tell her a lie.
“Nah, older than that. And yet—” Draco swooped the Cloak over his shoulders and all of him but his head disappeared. “The Enchantment is flawless to this day. Hasn’t worn out in the slightest.”
Harry took a deep breath. He imagined the choices and scenarios of how he could spend the rest of the day, that hour, those 60 seconds between 11:13 and 11:14 a.m.
“First?!” Mrs. Weasley squealed, her fork clanging to the floor. Ginny and Ron who were sitting on her either side and shushed her. Mrs. Weasley turned pink, mumbled an apology and gestured for Harry to continue speaking.
“It—it certainly seems that way,” Draco said, turning to meet Harry’s eyes, his face blanched. He did not continue reading, so Harry swallowed hard and continued for him:
“Hang on,” Harry said, squinting at the page again. “'Before adopting muggle plumbing methods.’ So wixen
“Let’s take a look,” Harry said and as he did so the long oak table appeared in the middle of the room.
“But, please,” Harry said as a thought occurred to him. What if this wix blabbed to the Prophet or other paparazzi that Harry Potter had ordered something for his lover? “I need you to keep this transaction a secret,” Harry explained. “It’s a surprise.”
Thank you so much to my betas for pushing me to do more and describe more. I'm so tired hahaha, but so pleased with this chapter. I hope you enjoyed <3
It is Days 18 AND 19 of Draco and Harry as it took me so long to write it bahahahaha xD Let me know what you think! ;)
After a moment of blissful silence as they both soaked up Harry’s words, Dragana sniffed and said, “I love you so much, Harry.”
“Well, you informed us yourself, Hermione,” Harry said. “Technology doesn’t work when there’s so much magic around.”
His cheeks red with embarrassment, Harry took the handkerchief and quickly dried his own eyes and blew his nose.

His life was going brilliantly. And he was even starting that heart-wrenching, soul-twisting process of forgiving himself for the mistakes he made in his youth and healing from the trauma of his childhood and the war.
Day 9 of 25 Days of Draco and Harry! This is part 2 of the fic I started yesterday, on Day 8 of this Advent challenge. I am getting so excited for this story, and I'll let you in on a little secret--> i'm planning to make this into a 100k+ fic in 2021! Happy Holidays :D
. You made the best fucking proposal, and I really thought I had topped the charts. I thought there was nothing better than that Nutcracker. Fucking
“I know!” Draco let out a frustrated groan. “Okay. The truth is, it had nothing to do with the portrait.”

“Are you ready?” Harry whispered, kissing his way down Draco’s chest and stopping exactly where he knew Draco would let out a frustrated moan. Draco did not disappoint.
Harry stared at Malfoy’s hand for what felt like a solid minute, just an arm’s length in front of him. He raised his eyes to meet Malfoy’s, in which Harry felt a confident, open, and…playful pull—quite unlike anything he’d ever felt when looking at Draco Malfoy before.
He tore off the Invisibility Cloak and the three younger wixen shrieked again as another Eighth Year materialized directly in front of them, right at Malfoy’s shoulder.
Draco was looking at him with an expression of such confusion, and Harry realized he was going to have to tell him sooner or later. He took a deep breath and said, “Okay, long story short: Voldemort split his soul to make Horcruxes. I don’t know if you know what those are, but to defeat him, Ron, Hermione, and I had to find and destroy them. Voldemort thought he’d get all fancy and use Ravenclaw’s Diadem and Hufflepuff’s golden cup—”
Draco sped up, stroking Harry’s cock in time with his thrusts, each time hitting Harry’s prostate, causing Harry to gradually fall apart at the seams.
“I did. I just like to tease you.” Harry grinned. “If I’m being honest… I think the best thing to do is tell Professor McGonagall.”
“Unfortunate indeed,” Harry said, and turned the page. “Here’s some notes about Hufflepuff’s ideas for implementing House Elves at Hogwarts. ‘Though I agree with Helga’s initiative to give House Elves a safe work environment at Hogwarts, she will not heed my concerns about a potential uprising in the future. My prophetic dreams about conflicts between witches and wizards and other magical beings have, to my great frustration, been dismissed. I am certain one day House Elves will no longer accept their subservient role in our society. I’ve discussed some potential enchantments with her for the kitchens and the Great Hall which would make it possible for students and staff to be fed without using the Elves, but, again, I have been overruled.’”
Ginny sensed the wards around Grimmauld Place respond to Harry’s magical signature and allow him entry.
After just another moment, Dragana kissed Harry on the neck, pleasantly surprised at how warm the man’s skin was under his jacket collar.
Ever so slowly, Harry eased himself up and down Draco’s cock and was soon moaning and grunting, the intense feeling of Draco’s cock inside him had always fogged his mind and made him lose any coherent thoughts.
“I’m going back to Ginny now. Please, leave. You’re really messing with the wards, and she’s starting to get suspicious about why I’m acting so strangely. And it’s Christmas.”
Draco pulled away to inspect his work. Satisfied, he brought his lips down one last time to kiss the mark. Harry shivered.
He gestured all around him, the fairy lights still twinkling in the trees above them, and the huts wrapped nice and tight for the night. “
I love Drarry, you all know this. They're my OTP. And I know that there are a lot of people who hate Ginny. First of all, I validate those of you who have these experiences with and opinions about this character--I also occasionally enjoy a good fanfic that may be "Ginny Bashing." But I also want to think about this, as if it were a relationship outside of Fiction--what would have happened? If Draco and Harry are meant to be together (as I believe, they are, as we've established, LIFE, and my OTP heehee <3) what would have happened to Ginny who thought they were going to get together when the war was over and Voldemort was gone?
“Here—” Draco grabbed one of the pillows and repositioned it. “Set yourself on this, then lie back, facing me.”
“Oh, but of course, Harry Potter,” the wix said, nodding fiercely. “All our sales come with a privacy guarantee—we even sign a binding contract.”
Harry nodded and breathed deeply multiple times getting used to the feeling of Draco’s cock inside of him. Draco made it easier for him to relax by covering his face, neck, and chest with soft kisses.
“I had no idea,” Harry admitted. “What was wrong with the portrait of the wix scholar? At their desk?”
. The prat had woken him approximately 20 minutes ago, ordering him to put on his shoes and grab the Invisibility Cloak.
“Now, we strip,” Draco said, giving Harry a sultry look. Harry didn’t have to be told twice. As they removed their clothes, Harry felt himself growing aroused. He’d never gone skinny-dipping before, let alone with someone as beautiful as Draco.
face. Surrounded by dozens of other skaters on the ice rink—whether muggles or wixen, Draco didn’t know or care. He only had eyes for Harry. And Harry was beautiful. Absolutely
As Harry lay in bed that night, his thoughts spun in his head like a hamster wheel. Every time he closed his eyes, he was bombarded with images of Malfoy—his smirk, his smile, his hand reaching out to Harry. But also Malfoy’s eyes, his cheeks burning pink then red, his Adam’s apple bobbing up and down as he swallowed, his lips as they formed the words “my dear Potter.”
Draco was quiet for a second in which Harry held his breath. Finally, Draco said, “Harry, I feel the same way.”
As they did so, she waved her wand and the classroom door shut and locked itself. “How can I help you Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy? I must say I’m surprised but pleased to see you getting on with each other.”
Ron’s eyes went wide as dinner plates and Hermione’s eyebrows shot straight up. Susan’s mouth rounded in an “Oh!” and Luna said, “Mmm….makes sense.”
“After we ran into each other in the stacks,” Hermione explained, “I took Susan and Luna down to the kitchens.”
They’d barely been speaking for 60 seconds, and both Draco and Harry had revealed something quite personal about themselves and their mental states. Their miraculous ability to be open and raw with each other so immediately did not go unnoticed by either of them, and they both blushed.
At any other time in his life, Draco would have been uncomfortable with the reaction and the subsequent reactions of Weasley and Granger. But now, he saw the comedy in it—as much of a shock as it was for him to see Harry here, it was probably just as startling for Harry to see his former “archenemy” turned ally during the Battle of Hogwarts.
When Draco was finished, he collapsed on Harry’s chest. Their hearts pounded against each other, and they both gasped for breath, trying to recover from the intensity of their orgasms.
refused to lift. In fact, he was starting to get some strange looks from a decrepit pensioner in Number 11—they glared daggers at him through the window beneath their wide-rimmed glasses—and Number 13—a young child with a pacifier who stood just in a nappy, both hands pressed to the window. “STOP PRETENDING I’M INVISIBLE AND BRING ME SOME FIGGY PUDDING, MOTHER FUCKER!”

“Please, what?” Draco asked, and Harry, though his eyes were closed, could hear the grin in the other man’s words.
Harry’s laughter stopped suddenly, the genuine meaning of Draco’s words dawning on him for the first time. Draco’s heart seemed to stop dead in his chest at the same time, awaiting Harry’s response.
Harry heard and sensed Malfoy step out from behind him and reveal his presence to Ron and Hermione. Almost comically, their eyes widened and Ron’s mouth dropped open in shock.
Draco chuckled. “Okay, okay! I know just the place. Did I ever tell you my mother has a Christmas tree garden?”
“You really are very much a Ravenclaw in many ways,” Harry said, lacing his emerald green gloves with Draco’s silver ones.
Draco stumbled backwards at the force of the word, but managed to quickly regain his footing. He fell silent.
Draco looked like he was about to protest, then considered Harry’s point, and finally nodded in agreement. “That does sound like the best course of action. She’s the head of the school, probably our most powerful ally here,
“No need to thank me, Mr. Potter,” the wix leaned closer, their eyes enormous behind their  spectacles. “It is the law. A law I stand firmly behind.” A grin spread across their face, and Harry returned it, excited to finally look at all the beautiful jewelry around him.
“I know. I know. And I want to show them how amazing I am, I’m just…not sure…if I’ll be successful.”
The former Gryffindor took the Room’s Christmas present [a/n: a Santa-Snitch themed tie] and unwrapped it from his wrist. Then, very slowly he tied it around Draco’s eyes. The blond froze for a moment, shocked at the unexpected sensation around his eyes. But the sensation building in his trousers was a lot more distracting in that moment…
“Oh, yes,” Draco replied, his voice dripping with lust and desire. Harry felt Draco rub against him and moaned loudly.
Luckily, Draco had one more trick up his sleeve. He found a secluded corner, empty except for a single suit of armor. Draco stood behind it for cover as he clumsily drew the Marauder’s Map out of his pocket. He felt more than a little guilty, but it would all be worth it. He hoped.
“Why? Is it…?” Harry took a deep breath. “Okay, here’s the deal. I have no idea what this present means. And the last couple years, I was always so embarrassed about not understanding the meaning behind your presents.”
Day Four complete! I had a great time writing this chapter--so much fun. Probably why it took so long for me to post it hahaha, so sorry about the delay. But enjoy, and I will be writing the prompt for Day 5 today!
The Silver Stag is hosting a Yule Ball and Draco, Harry, Ron, and Hermione had all been planning to go as a group--that is, until Draco comes up with his secret plan to seduce Harry Potter...even if only for one night. In the process, he learns a lot more about himself than he thought he would.
However, Harry and Draco’s intense eye contact was more than enough to cause some shifty movements and Ron let out an awkward cough.
Draco looked at him with warm grey eyes, attempting to melt the frozen wall behind the icy façade that Harry and his magic were figuratively creating around him. Draco imagined it looked like delicate frozen snowflake crystals on a frosted windowpane.
Malfoy tore his eyes away from Harry and glanced down at the First-Year who was squinting up at them, their lips pursed in an inquisitive expression that reminded Harry of Hermione.
“I’ve listened to the WWN, British radio channels, online radio channels from around the planet—waiting for something to come along that would be good enough to be our song. And yet here you are—right all along. We already have our song.”
Harry nodded and ruffled Albus’ hair, as messy and out-of-control as his own. “I hear that you’re nervous about making the wrong choice.”
Draco nodded. “That makes sense. Having a sense of identity is crucial. But… I see a lot more in you than just stereotypical Gryffindor bravery. And… well, that’s one reason I fell in love with you.”
Day 23 of 25 Days of Draco and Harry! Love the prompt, reminded me of the movie "Serendipity." I was also listening to James Blunt's "You're Beautiful" on repeate while writing this xD <3
Harry bit the insides of his cheek, trying not to smile. And of course, Harry couldn’t help feeling excited by the thought of spending time alone with Draco. It would be close quarters under the Invisibility Cloak.
Notes: Day 7 of 25 Days of Draco and Harry is a wrap! I honestly was a bit worried going into this today, not sure how inspiration would hit me, or if my low energy and anxiety would make it difficult to create something of substance today. But I am really pleased with how it turned out! Inspired by the Day 7 prompt of the challenge, but also “Isn’t it Romantic?” with Rebel Wilson and “Sleepless in Seattle” with that famous quote spoken by Tom Hanks: “It was a million tiny little things that, when you added them all up, they meant we were supposed to be together, and I knew it. I knew it the first time I touched her. It was like coming home, only to no home I’d ever known….It was like magic.”
“You’re the one who’s like an angel, Draco,” Harry said, “And I can’t believe you’ve got me saying this. It’s so cheesy,
Coming from a…traditional family, Draco knew quite a bit of ancient magic passed down through the generations. This particular ritual the Potter-Malfoy family was going to cast today was actually the first bit of magic Draco could remember—the first spell he ever learned how to cast and control on his own. It was the only spell his parents allowed him to cast…on purpose, of course…before he went to Hogwarts.
Draco smiled at Harry then turned to Professor McGonagall. “I suppose we should start with a confession,” Draco said. Professor McGonagall raised her eyebrows as Draco continued. “Harry and I have been searching for clues and attempting to solve the mystery behind the strange things that have been happening at Hogwarts since the start of term.”
“In that instant, I knew where Hogwarts wanted me to go. I didn't know why. But that force was simply so overwhelming I knew I had to get there quickly...” Draco trailed off.
“We definitely did something right…raising those two,” Draco said as he placed his hand on his lover’s shoulder, squeezing enough to be felt gently beneath Harry’s thick winter coat.
Harry saw something flicker in Draco’s eyes. “What?” he asked, before the former Slytherin could deny the crack he’d revealed in his façade.
“No!” Ginny cut him off sharply. She realized with a start that she was looking down at Harry. When had she stood up?
“Well. It seems like fate certainly has a plan for the two of you,” Professor McGonagall said. “I will consider how to bring this up to the Board of Governors. I cannot ignore the signs. Hogwarts knows it is time for reform and I do not see any use in trying to fight it. Of course,” and she gestured at the journal, “I have no doubt that you two will be invaluable in these discussions and heavily involved in the actual reformation. However—” McGonagall adapted a very stern look, “This does not mean that I will accept you skimping on your studies.”
Harry felt his cock slip out of Draco’s mouth and he whimpered at the loss of sensation. Draco laughed. “You make the sexiest noises when you can’t get enough of me.”
… As if Harry’s wish were the Room’s command, a string of (magically lit) multicolored Christmas lights appeared on the table beside him.
Day 5 of of the 25 Days of Draco and Harry, inspired by Traditional Prompt #5 and "Tell Me a Lie" by One Direction. It is from Ginny's P.O.V.. Please read notes at the end of the story!
When Harry had licked all the precum away, he proceeded to continue decorating his Draco as a Christmas tree. Harry made sure to highlight one of his lover’s…most awe-inspiring features (that delicious cock) with delicate and precise twists and turns of the string of lights.
Harry heard Draco take a few steps closer to him and slowly lowered his hand, turning towards the other man.
As soon as they arrived in the Apparition Room of the department store, even before Harry had recovered from the trip, his nostrils were assaulted by the heavy aromas of peppermint, melted chocolate, and a burning fireplace.
Harry grabbed his wand to cast a sound reducing charm so Draco couldn’t use his other senses to deduce what Harry was about to do.
After a few seconds of silence, McGonagall said, “What did you mean, Mr. Potter, when you said you didn’t feel you had a ‘choice’ in whether you were involved with this?”
“'It is true, that if Hogwarts were to start shifting around, it would cause confusion and concern. That being said, there is an argument to be made that though change is often confusing and concerning, Ravenclaw was leaps and bounds ahead of her time in realizing that change is often necessary if we are to advance as a society and improve upon our traditions and abilities.’”
It looked as though his boyfriend had just woken up, having had a Sunday lie-in. His hair was sticking up in the back, like Harry’s often did, and he had to smile. But his smile quickly faltered when he noticed Draco looking at the wrapping paper on the couch. He raised an eyebrow in Harry’s direction.
Harry finally looked back from the ring and met Draco’s eyes, which were unmistakably starting to glisten. Seeing this, Harry felt himself choke up, and swallowed hard as his gaze fell back to the beautiful engagement ring.
When Malfoy took a step forward to look, Harry did the same, still hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak.
Dragana swatted him with her hand, but there was no snarl behind the bite as the guests shared uncomfortable groans and laughs.
Draco began to shake with laughter and Harry promptly shut his mouth and narrowed his eyes at the git.
“We couldn’t have done it without all your help,” Draco said. “If you want to be involved as this moves forward, we’ll make sure that happens.”
He had barely escaped the Gryffindor Quidditch Team’s changing rooms without being caught. But it wouldn’t be long before Potter found his
An extra big thank you to my Betas crazybutgood and vukovich--they really outdid themselves with this one <3
Harry let out little moans as he felt Draco’s tongue swirl around his shaft. Then Draco took him deeper and Harry gasped. “Fffuck, Draco…”
Now Harry stood inside the shop “Wixen Crystals,” reading a sign about their Wixmas Cracker Specials.
Dragana frowned slightly at the words; they hadn’t been the ones they’d discussed, but they sounded well enough to her and she quickly readjusted her face into a soft smile.
“Don’t patronize me. Tosser.” But Harry did think about it, and as they walked past a mall kiosk where a kindly wix with bright pink hair was selling winter jumpers. A child wearing a Ravenclaw scarf (who, from their size, was probably only a first year at Hogwarts) suddenly spilled the contents of their Christmas Snitch Mug all over a bright red jumper.
Dragana continued, “I’m sorry, but I have to admit I loathed visiting him here! He just refused to change even the dreariest old curtain.” As laughter rang out again, Teddy clapping along this time, Dragana squeezed Harry’s hand, and shared with him a memory through their bond. It was of the two of them sorting through Sirius’ possessions in his old bedroom.
Draco chuckled softly and sounding a little high he said, “This goddamn Room…Merlin…” he nodded. “Yes. Green.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “I was raised by muggles, Draco. And I highly doubt there’s a trash collector coming to Hogwarts to dispose of our used condom in a landfill.”
She and her family had always cherished Christmas. It was such a magical time—and not only just because of its sheer beauty, aesthetic, and joy. Ginny had always felt her

Harry nodded. “Take all the time you need. We’ve got all night. What else am I going to do but drink this…drink.” He really couldn’t bear to call...
Harry jumped at Draco’s sudden outburst. He noticed Draco was trembling wildly and quickly reached out to hold his hands in his.
‘I do not like to admit it, but I believe Helga, Salazar, Godric, and myself are responsible. By deciding to separate our students into different Houses, we think we are encouraging healthy competition which will allow young witches and wizards to grow and develop their magic to the best of their abilities. In reality, this rivalry will drive them apart and lead to animosity, willful ignorance, and hatred within the walls of Hogwarts and beyond. But the other three founders and I have already set the wheels in motion, and Godric and the others are determined to have his hat be imbued with our magic so that students will continue to be sorted into these Houses long after we are gone. I have tried to warn the others about my visions of the future, but they do not believe my dream to be prophetic, nor are they willing to waver on any of the agreements we’ve made thus far about the school.’”
“There’s a reason, Harry, just trust me. Please, may I continue?” Harry didn’t respond. “Please?” Dragana pressed.
“Wow. It is…exactly as you described it,” Harry said delicately. It was true. The Christmas atmosphere was most definitely prevalent from the very first second, exactly as Draco had told him over tea that morning.
“It’s you, Draco. This whole time…it’s always been you. I mean, of course, I knew I felt something for you when we were at Hogwarts, but...haven’t you wondered why ever since Ginny and I broke up, I’m always asking to hang out with you? No one else? You kept trying to encourage me to see Ron and Hermione or set up dates with other wixen or muggles…but this year…I haven’t wanted to be around anyone else as much as you. Or as often.” He paused, took a breath, and exhaled slowly. “It’s you, Draco. It’s always been you.”
Draco groaned. “You can say that again. We’re supposed to lead this...this reformation of the school? Why us?”
Draco smiled and reached for the lube again, slathering his cock with a generous amount. He leaned down to brush his lips against Harry’s, while at the same time using his hand to align the head of his cock with Harry’s entrance.
wish we could find it,” Harry said, tracing his fingers along the leather cover. “And the Room of Requirement has been used to hide important artifacts throughout history.”
Realization finally dawned on Harry. “You’re writing our song, aren’t you?” Harry shook his head, but when he spoke again, Dragana could hear the smile in his voice, “You ssentimental Sslytherin.”
“You are such a Hufflepuff, you know that?” Harry said and he pulled the blond towards him before the other man had a chance to mock-react to Harry’s audacity in comparing him to a Hufflepuff. Harry pressed his lips to Draco’s. The kiss was sweet and deep, and when the two released, they felt grounded again, with themselves, with their magic, and with the Earth.
The Room had provided three mirrors for him to admire himself in, something Draco had taken advantage of that morning when he'd been alone. He was grateful for the mirrors now—his nerves threatening to call everything off, change back into his trousers, and just give up the broomstick.
“'That being said, I cannot allow Hogwarts to stand undefended. Knowing what I know, I must do everything in my power to ensure Hogwarts will be able to adapt and heal after the devastating events that will transpire here. Therefore, I will be enchanting the castle with the spells I have crafted in this journal, but they will remain dormant until Hogwarts itself determines it is the right time. Then, Hogwarts will activate these enchantments and begin the process of adapting to the needs of the current students, as I have always said it should be doing all along. My dream has shown me that unity between the Houses and perhaps a dismantling of the Sorting System all together will be the only way to heal the school and progress into a better future.
After five minutes of shouting and stomping, Harry still hadn’t come to meet him. Draco took off his scarf and folded it so he could sit on the snowy ground with at least a little bit of comfort. He would wait for as long as it would take for Harry to come talk to him. The bloody Gryffindor would have to cave any minute. He wouldn’t be able to stand the thought of anyone freezing to death on his doorstep because of his stubbornness.
“Daddy!” Scorpius admonished him, and Draco raised his eyebrows at his son. “Papa, Harry can’t help it that his voice is so bad. But he sings from the heart— and that’s what’s important!”
Harry didn’t respond. He stood still for a couple seconds, presumably in shock at the icy water on his skin. Then, he took his hand—no gloves, as though he hadn’t been planning on staying out for long—and wiped the back of his neck, clearing the rest of the snow that clung there.
“Fuck,” Harry whispered and quickly brought his hand back to his cock, giving it a firm, long stroke. He moaned again and shut his eyes, again imagining Draco Malfoy… the Slytherin’s lips, curved in a flirtatious smirk, licking his lips tantalizingly slowly, his face flushed with arousal. Harry imagined himself staring deep into Malfoy’s eyes as the other man reached down and removed Harry’s hand, replacing it with his own. Forgetting all about Ron in the next bed, Harry began to stroke himself with vigor, lost in the imaginary touch of Draco Malfoy.
“I’m sorry to say that...” Harry cleared his throat again, “...tea is not one of Kreacher’s strong points.”
Harry was also more than ready. He pulled off his own trousers and his erect cock sprung free. Once he’d removed all his clothing, Harry touched his lover’s leg… knee…. thigh… belly… collarbone…all the while moving himself closer and closer to Draco’s cock.
Harry smiled, tears forming in the corners of his eyes as he turned to face his lover and mouthed, “Thank you.”
“I just couldn’t bear it.” This time Harry fell to the floor next to her and squeezed her hand tightly. But he also buried his face in his other arm, hiding his face from her. Ginny sensed the dark shadows of shame and disgrace radiating off Harry, mixed with his own spiraling magic, reaching into every inch of that dreary, old, decrepit room.
Draco had sat Harry down, and, in a very Hermione-ish fashion, had offered him a book that perfectly explained the ritual and how they would weave the elemental magic of the Earth with their own. The earliest memory Draco had was of himself standing with his parents in their garden, in front of a bonfire and reaching out as if to touch the strands of golden magic emanating from his mother’s hands. And then, when he was five, he was already able to control the energy of the spell with the support of his parents.
Ever so slowly, one article of clothing at a time, the two of them undressed the other. As soon as they were both completely bare, Draco stepped close enough that their legs and already half-hard cocks grazed each other. With his fingertips, he traced Harry’s collar bone, his neck, his chest. Harry brought his own hand to the small of Draco’s back and began to trace up his spine before venturing back down. Harry had never felt this intimacy with anyone before, and he felt himself melt into Draco as they caressed each other, occasionally stealing kisses.
“I’m still stuck on those floor plans,” Harry said. “The Gryffindor Common room appearing in the dungeons… It’s exactly what’s happening now.
Harry thought, and felt his trousers constrict. He tried to take some control of the kiss, bringing both of his hands to twist in Draco’s hair, making the other man gasp.
Harry’s eyes widened, as it finally dawned on him. “You’ve been planning this. Ever since we got together. It’s true!  Don’t even try to hide it anymore!”
“I’ll head to the library first thing tomorrow," Hermione said. "I don’t know nearly as much as I should about Rowena Ravenclaw, but there’s a biography I’ve been dying to read. Honestly, I almost check it out every time I go to the library, but I always talk myself out of it. I’m excited to finally have a good excuse now...”
‘As saddened as I am about this terrible future I have seen, I also have hope. Particularly because of the final bit of wisdom my dream shared with me. Shortly after the war, there will be two young wizards, a Gryffindor and a Slytherin, whose love for Hogwarts and each other will—”
Draco smiled and the tears finally flowed . With nothing left to hold him back, Draco leaned forward and pressed his lips to Harry’s. Draco felt his magic instantly burst forth towards the other man, and its sparks, along with those that must belong to Harry, flow back and forth between and within them both.
It happened instantaneously. The ribbons floated into the air and started lacing into the loops at the front of the corset. They were slightly longer and dangled delicately down the body of the corset, tickling his legs where the stockings stopped.
“Now, off to your next class.” Professor McGonagall’s voice was tight, as if she was also holding back tears. "If you hurry, you won’t be late.”
“You’re doing so well…” Draco said as he slowly released his finger to apply more lube. He pressed two fingers to Harry’s entrance, and Harry exhaled, relaxing into Draco’s fingertips.
“Look here!” Ron said, pointing at a particularly lengthy passage about the staircases. “‘At the turn of the 11
Harry took a picture and the photo printed out automatically. He took a few more pictures from different angles, admiring his beautiful work of art. His Draco.
"That's good..." Harry said, pleased the lights were tied securely but not too tightly around his lover.
At the sound of his name, Harry looked up from his mug and met Draco’s eyes. And for a moment, it really felt like Draco was trying to read into his soul. He felt exposed and anxious, but forced himself to keep eye contact. He saw Draco initiate a breath and followed suit. As they both exhaled in a deep sigh, Harry felt him relax into their mutual gaze. And, before he could help himself, he was also trying to read into the other man’s soul.
Harry glared at his best mate. “Look, I wasn’t sure how to tell you. I thought you’d react—well, just like this, actually.”
“Sleigh bells ring… are you listening? In the laaaaaaaane… snow is glistening!” Harry’s voice cracked as he sustained the notes of his favorite Christmas carol just a few seconds too long. Draco rolled his eyes, silently dying under the grating sound of his beloved’s terrible singing voice.
“I was going to say that—” He paused melodramatically to make sure his family was listening and then continued: “You have many choices when you’re sitting on your broom looking for that Snitch. Are you going to fly down to the right? Or up and towards the left? I don’t know what I’ll find once I get there. Hopefully, the Snitch. But probably not. I’ll probably find…another choice I need to make. And I’ll follow that choice to another and another, until I finally capture that Snitch. Like I did every time, mind you. Your father never won—”
Harry looked Draco, watching goosebumps spread across his skin as his lover shook slightly from the cold, as well as his overpowering arousal.
“Well,” Harry said, turning back to Susan. “Do you think there’s something fishy going on in the kitchens or something?”
“Harry,” Draco tried again. “She can’t…” Draco mindlessly extended his arms, grasping at the air as though searching for the words. “Harry, she can’t see the way your eyes light up when you smile.”
The sound of the robin’s song permeated the tranquil silence once more as Draco breathed in the piercing winter air.
Now, the two wixen’s competitive streak had only got worse since they’d gotten together. They were always trying to best each other at something—the best hot chocolate, the best date idea—and now Harry had had the brilliant idea to stir up a little competition around the Christmas crackers they would be providing for their loved ones.
“I’m terrible at this,” Ron finally said, “Hermione always says I have the emotional range of a teaspoon. I’ll just shut up now.”
“Wooooooo!” Came a shout from the center of the ice rink.  They released each other and turned briefly to look at who had shouted—and of course it was Ron. Hermione was jabbing him in the ribs. “I mean, come on Hermione, it’s
“You know it,” Dragana replied. She was already nose deep in the parchment, the quill scratching away…
Inside the mouth of the nutcracker was a beautiful silver ring. The band had a flawless brushed finish and a small round emerald twinkled up at Harry.
“Mostly, we just used tonight to get each other up to speed on what we know,” Malfoy explained. “And now, I suppose it’s time to do some research.”
Dragana shivered, a sizzle of Harry’s magic rushing down her spine, as the man’s voice swirled and danced in her head.
When they arrived in the entry hall, Kreacher stood at the window and gazed out.  His eyes searched the cold, dark winter night for the person, or people, who had triggered the wards at 10 past 10 on a Monday evening.
He scooched over to make room for his boyfriend on the couch, and Draco joined him. Harry took a deep breath and revealed the Nutcracker from under his back.
Then, Draco squeezed. A gentle, tender squeeze. Draco’s thumb caressed Harry’s thigh, and in that moment, Harry’s breath caught in his throat. He had to stop himself from looking down and exposing to the others what was transpiring right under their noses.
Harry helped his guest out of his jacket and his hands shook as they brushed against Draco’s back but the blond didn’t seem to notice a thing.
They met with Hermione, Ron, Luna, and Susan that evening in the Room of Requirement to let them know the mystery had been solved. The others listened in stunned silence as they talked about finding the book hidden in the Room of Requirement and the secret enchantments Ravenclaw cast on the castle. When they mentioned they’d brought this information to Professor McGonagall and left the journal with her, Hermione groaned.
“Happy Christmas, my love,” Harry whispered into the quiet room, holding Draco tightly as he slipped off to sleep.
“Fuck off!” Harry lovingly narrowed his eyes at the two of them and the room burst into shocked and embarrassed laughter once more.
As their group approached the Grand Staircase where the Eighth Years would separate from Luna, the Ravenclaw said goodbye to all of them. Then, she reached a hand out to Susan’s cheek and gave her a soft peck on the lips.
Christmas crackers. Whatever you have got, no matter how hard you may have tried, will ever live up to what I’ve got in store.”
“I thought it might be you.” Draco had vaguely recognized its song. “You’re a little early, aren’t you?”
Harry was trying his hardest to stay in the moment with Draco, but his head was spinning  His heart raced, and he couldn’t see, his eyes blurred by his own tears.
Dragana’s tears were flowing freely down her face and she wasn’t alone. Harry’s face was far from dry and as he glanced around his guests, everyone was crying with them except for George and Ron who were openly weeping and attempting to hold each other up in their seats.
“Um…” Harry thought about what he could say. He landed on the truth.  “Okay,” Harry sighed. “You caught me. I…was having a peek at the presents. I was going to seal them back up later.”
“Oh-merlin-Harry-will-you-please-just-put-your-hands-around-my-throat-and-choke-me?” Draco let out in a rush. He was obviously very close to coming, and Harry took pity on him—bringing his hands to the other man’s throat.
Harry unclasped his bag and pulled out Ravenclaw’s journal. He placed it on the desk and pushed it a couple inches towards Professor McGonagall. “It’s all in here,” Harry explained. “Why the Gryffindor Common Room has shown up in the Dungeons, why paintings are disappearing and freezing, why mealtimes aren’t running as smoothly as before...” he trailed off as Professor McGonagall took the journal in her hands and flipped to the first page.
“You’re nervous,” Harry said. This wasn’t a question—he felt it in the way her heart pounded in her chest against his.
Harry made to walk back along Karlsgasse towards their previous apparition point, but Draco held him back.
“Well, you and I are kind of spearheading this whole investigation of Hogwarts, and in the process, we’ve brought in others from all the different Houses.”
It's Day 15! I can't believe there's only ten days left, and it also feels like a lifetime away bahahahaha. I hope you enjoyed <3 xo

Strangely, the absence of his touch made Harry uneasy, so he turned to look at the man who had just apologized to him. Malfoy seemed to be waiting for Harry to turn around, and they instantly made eye contact. Harry found himself rooted to the spot, incapable of looking away. They were so close Harry could see his own reflection in Malfoy’s cool grey eyes.
Our song is when you’re fucking me and all you can do is whimper my name over and over as you cum inside me…Draco…Dragana…Dray…It’s so hot. The way you moan and gasp during those orgasms—”
(Picture of a book describing the "Broom Hiding" tradition: The winter in Scandinavia is marked by extremely few hours of daylight; it is a time of darkness and all that this implies, and thus traditional winter stories have abounded with mischievous spirits. Given that it was said that witches roam the land during the darkest month of December, brooms had to be hidden so as not to be stolen for a Christmas night-ride.)
The older wix reminded Harry so much of Tonks with her hair, charm and knack for entertainment. As Harry and Draco passed the kiosk, Harry squeezed the other man’s hand, lest the wave of grief crash too hard in that moment.
“You’re such a liar, Draco.” Harry scowled. “And when they get to Hogwarts, they’ll learn everything about—”

But those past decisions weren’t what terrified Dragana, 20 meters in the air, unable to shake the horrible image of falling to the cold, hard ground. Yes, there was a fresh cushion of snow, and yes, she trusted Harry, but two grown people on a broomstick? It was not an easy feat.
“Are you sure this is safe?!” Dragana held Harry tightly around the middle, face buried between his shoulder blades. The two wixen had just lifted off from Grimmauld Place for a romantic midnight ride on Harry’s
He and Dragana had agreed he’d be the one to start the speech. They were going to do it now, just before handing out the Christmas crackers. It was time to tell them all that he and Dragana were engaged. Harry stood next to his chair and looked down in adoration at their friends and loved ones: the Weasleys and Fleur, Andromeda, Teddy, Narcissa, Blaise, Luna, her father, and Neville.
. We’re supposed to be your best friends. And after all we’ve been through together, you’d rather hang out with
