Draco’s fingers still inside Harold. “I want Harold to be my first,” he says without any hesitation.
“Love you too.” Harold smiles up at Draco and pushes him closer against him. Draco slides his hands in Harold’s hair and then places a kiss on Harold’s scar.
Then Bellatrix her body convulses and Rodolph tells Harold to let go. Harold loosens the scarf and sees the colour slowly fade from his mother’s face. She smiles at Harold and thanks him. Harold smiles back and kisses his mom on her nose.
Harold pushes his finger against one of the spikes. It pinches a little and a small drop of blood falls down. Rodolph takes Harold’s hand and sucks on the blood.
The teeth bite into her shoulder. Hermione’s eyes flash open and she screams. She again tries to move forward, away from Greyback and his abusing cock and teeth. Greyback bites down deeper and then pulls away without opening his jaws. Flesh tears from Hermione’s shoulder. Hermione shudders and drops even further down to the ground. She can hear Greyback chew on her flesh behind her.
“That is right, my boy. You are mine. Now take hold of that sword with both your hands,” Voldemort says.
Rodolph’s moans get louder and more erratic by the second. And then he tenses before a wide grin spreads on his face. Bellatrix releases his cock and then lays down on his other side. Rodolph his finger slides out of Harold’s ass, which feels empty all of the sudden.
Neville screams. He swallows the flames and his throat burns closed. Neville’s scream dies abruptly. He can’t breathe. The lack of oxygen makes his mind shot down. He can’t think straight anymore.
Neville lifts his wand and walks past Ron and Hermione. He can hear Hermione scream at him, but he doesn’t care anymore. He will try to end this idiot, even if it’s the last thing he does. It will probably be the last thing he ever does. But it’s better to die a hero than a coward.
“That’s a good boy,” Bellatrix says. And then she shows Harold how to hold his lips over his teeth so he can take Rodolph’s cock in his mouth. Harold does as she tells him and lets his mouth slide over Rodolph’s cock.
Hermione wakes in a warm room. She looks around to see bookcase after bookcase. Curious she walks towards one and scans the bindings. They are all books she still wanted to read but never got around too. Hermione picks up one of the books and walks towards a comfy couch that sits next to a fireplace. A cosy fire is lit and Hermione pulls a soft blanket around her as she starts to read.
Rodolph puts his wand away and takes hold of Bellatrix’s head. He pushes her down on his cock at the same time he pushes one of his fingers into Harold’s hole. It hurts a little and Harold lets out a small cry.
“Thank you,” Bellatrix replies. “Harold,” she says as she looks his way. “Do you want to give dad your present? I believe you took quite some time to make your drawing.”
And now he was gone. Still, pale and dead. Narcissa will never hear him laugh again. She will never find him in front of the piano, playing one of the classics in the middle of the night because he can’t sleep. Her boy will never graduate, or marry, or have children of his own. He always wanted children. And now that joy was robbed away before he even had a chance to grasps it.
Neville looks at the door of the great hall. He can hear the voice clearly in his head. Just like he’d heard it twice before this day. Only this time the words seem unreal. It can’t be true. Neville had heard the prophecy. And he’s sure that if Voldemort’s words are true, all hope is lost.
Draco bites Harold’s neck and then kisses the spot before he answers. “Don’t know. There is a spell, to freeze people. They die quickly. I read it in the book I stole from my father’s library.”
Rodolph's eyes scan over Draco’s naked body and flushed cheeks. He steps up to them and slides his hand over Harold’s hand on Draco’s throat. “Let me help you,” he says.
Someone pulls Malfoy’s body of Harry and takes it in their arms. Harry opens his eyes and watches as Narcissa takes hold of her son and rocks his dead body in her arms.
“Always know that she would choose to end it if her boy would parish. I should have stayed and watched. She must have made a nice show, hanging naked from this tree. Just look how pretty she’s now,” Greyback says. He pushes against Narcissa’s body with the sword. Narcissa swings a little. Hermione tries not to look at her. It’s awful to see the woman dead and lifeless with faeces spoiling her legs.
Harold stares at him. How can it be that Draco is always afraid that Harold would hurt or leave him? Hasn’t Harold showed him time and time again that Draco is the most important person in his life. His best friend, his nephew, his family, and maybe from now on his lover. Harold wants to be Draco’s lover. Just like Barty is uncle Rabastan’s lover. Harold lifts a little so that he can lean over Draco. He looks him in the eyes and smiles at him.
“Yes, they are useless to me.” Voldemort shakes his head and then smiles at Neville. “But you are brave. I could use brave men like you in my new world. What do you think, Neville? Are you willing to follow me, now that your saviour is dead?”
Harold yawns. “Yes, daddy,” he answers. He struggles to keep his eyes open and he doesn’t mind when his dad places him on his parents' bed. Rodolph strokes his hand through Harold’s hair and then places a soft kiss on his lips.
When Harold and Rodolph are both naked, Harold takes the dildo, a strong piece of rope and one of the knives with him to the table that still holds the woman. He lays the tools down and then crawls on the table. He sits on his knees at the edge, his ass on the perfect height for Rodolph to fuck him when he wants to. Harold takes a hold of the woman’s legs and pulls her towards him. Her arms stretch over the table and when Harold leans over he can kiss the woman on her mouth. Harold massages the woman’s breast and bites on her lips. Then he sits up again and takes the rope he brought with him. He places the rope around the woman’s throat and leaves it there, ready for when he feels like choking the bitch.
“You’re beautiful,” he tells the woman. “Now scream for me,” he says as he stabs the knife through her right nipple and into her chest. The woman screams and then sputters. She coughs a little and some blood leaks out of her mouth.
Moments later, Harold wakes up when he’s lifted from the lounge chair. He blinks his eyes and then wraps his arms around Rodolph’s neck. “Love you, daddy,” Harold says.
Hermione looks at the amount of blood pooling around Dean’s body. She feels ashamed. Dean did what none of them dared. He stepped up and killed the snake.
“Yes, Harry,” Dumbledore says. “I asked Snape to inform you when the time was right. But I understand he never got the change, that he died only hours after I did.”
Harold slides down a little lower. Rodolph’s cock is large and it fills his entire mouth. It tastes nice. Harold can’t think of anything that tastes the same. A little fluid comes out of Rodolph’s cock and Harold swallows it away.
Without warning the world returns to normal. Dean screams as the pain of a sword locked in his body registers. His heartbeat speeds up and he starts to sweat. He lets go of the sword and pushes against the ground to lift his body a little. But he can’t feel his legs. He can’t stand up or even lift himself enough to get the sword out. He falls back down again and cries. The sounds of fighting are all around him. Everyone will be to busy to fight for their own lives to come and help Dean.
The man just stands behind them, the knife still in his hand. “I killed her,” he murmurs. “I’m a murderer.”
The sharp blade of the Gryffindor sword pushes softly against Hermione’s neck. Hermione whimpers as Greyback pulls harder on her hair.
“Okay,” Harold says. “Just promise me you will take a long time to get ready. I don’t want to lose you yet.”
And then the pain in Narcissa’s head explodes. The world around her turns dark and then there is just nothing.
Ginny looks towards the trees. “There is no help. Everyone is fighting,” she says. She waves her wand over Dean’s stomach and mutters some spells. The wound starts to close, only to open again moments later.
“Oh, fuck, Harold, I love you,” Rodolph tells him. His hand slides over Harold’s throat. He must be close to his climax. Harold places his free hand on Rodolph’s and squeezes, giving Rodolph permission to strangle him. Rodolph tightens his grip and Harold feels so good. He looks at the woman’s bulging eyes. Her body tremors around him and then goes rigid for a couple of seconds before the tremors start again. She must know that she will die soon. Harold feels his own hands start to tremble from his lack of oxygen. He lifts the knife one more time and stabs it into the side of the woman’s neck. He pulls it out again and smiles at the fountain of blood leaving the woman. She jerks and twitches on the table. Harold takes the knife and cuts her hands free. Her arms move around as life slowly leaves her. Harold slides the knife over his naked chest, enough to feel it, but not to cut. His heartbeat pounds and he lets his free hand rub over his hard cock. He grins as the woman spits out more blood and as her eyes roll around in her head.
“I did,” Harold says. It was strange. He thought he was going to die and he like the thought. To die pleasuring his dad would be so amazing. It will prove how much he loves his dad. But he gets to live another day, and that is even better.
“Just know, that we will always make sure you are okay. That is all that matters to us,” Bellatrix tells him.
“Hogwarts will become a place for true wizards,” Voldemort proclaims. “And everyone that doesn’t belong will suffer the same faith as our friend here.”
Then Neville is lifted from the ground, forced to stand on his legs as a body bind curse pins him in place.
Draco looks at Harold. Harold doesn’t have to ask, he can see in Draco’s eyes that it’s okay. That he wants to feel this. Draco is always jealous when Harold tells him about all the times he almost dies at the hands of his parents. And now he will get to experience the same feeling.
Rodolph undresses Harold slowly. Kissing every part of his body. He caresses him like he’s the most precious thing in the world. Harold lets Rodolph, his mind occupied with what is going to happen tonight. He moans as his father pushes a slick finger into his hole, quickly followed by a second.
“See how she molests your son, as he’s nothing but a sex toy,” Barty tells the man. “You can stop her. It’s simple. Just take this knife and cut her throat.”
Potter’s eyes widen as he looks at Draco and the Dark Lord. His eyes are focused on the Dark Lord’s hand that has pulled Draco’s cock out of his robes and is rubbing it slowly. Draco is hard and he can’t wait to fill Potter with his lid. He takes a step towards him and takes Potter’s nest of hair in his hand to pulls him on his knees, making his mouth line up with Draco’s cock. Potter firmly pushes his lips closed, unwilling to take Draco in his mouth.
“I’m going to kiss you,” Harold whispers back. And then his lips melt onto Draco’s and it’s perfect.
“It’s good to see you, Harry,” Dumbledore says. There is a twinkle in his eyes and Harry feels right at home.
With care, Narcissa lays Draco down on the ground. She stands up and takes off her robe, leaving her in only her bra and panties. She doesn’t care. Her life is worthless now. The only thing she lived for is dead and gone. Now she just wants to cover up the naked body of her baby boy.
Malfoy is naked too. The cut in his throat is gone, but his chest is filled with scars. Harry can’t help but stare at them. “I’m sorry,” he stutters as he realises how Malfoy had got them. Harry has put them there on that faithful day in sixth year. Draco had almost died that day. Would he have been okay with that? To die before he would kill Dumbledore and Snape? Before he became the monster he is now? Is it Harry’s fault that Malfoy turned to the dark side without any doubt in his minds if it was the right thing to do?
Draco takes Potter’s legs in his hand and lines his cock up with Potter’s hole. Draco pushes in with force and Potter cries out in pain. Draco fucks him and Potter whimpers. He looks so pathetic like this, snot leaking from his nose, tears straining his cheeks, his hands grabbing the forest floor, blood escaping his anus as Draco destroys it. He keeps begging for Draco to stop and Draco loves the thought that this is how Potter is going to die, as a whining little bitch. As his whining little bitch.
By the time the pain stops, Neville is out of breath. Tears streak his face and his legs feel like jelly.
The Dark Lord raises his wand and seconds later Potter’s clothes have vanished. The boy kneels naked in front of Draco, tears streaming over his cheeks. Draco laughs as he looks at him. It’s good to get back for all the times Potter has made his life miserable.
“Oh, I love it when you fight,” Greyback says when he pulls out of the kiss. He pushes Hermione back onto the ground and tears her jeans from her legs. He scrapes his claws over her back, drawing blood that he licks away. Then he grabs Hermione’s hips and pulls her on her knees. He pushes against Hermione’s ass and Hermione can feel his dick through his jeans. It’s hard and Hermione does not doubt what Greyback is planning to do next.
Dean’s blood boils in his veins. This is one of his best friends that bastard is talking about. There is nothing nice or funny about him being dead.
“Yes, that one. She made the mother touch the boy. They were both naked. And then Barty said that the man would be set free if he killed her. I think he believed him,” Harold continues.
“Oh, Lucius, don’t be a drag. It’s a silly bird, no need to get upset about that,” Bellatrix says. She moves forwards and lifts Harold in her arms.
“Okay, mom,” Harold answers. He pulls on the scarf and watches as Bellatrix’s mouth falls open. Rodolph starts to kiss her pussy again. Bellatrix smiles and then closes her eyes. It doesn’t take long before they pop open again. Bellatrix her hands shake in their ropes and her legs start to kick around Rodolph’s head. He just continues to lick and kiss her. Slowly Bellatrix her head turns red and her eyes start to roll inside their sockets. Harold looks at them with fascination. He wonders if his mother is in pain, or if it’s only joy she feels now. The young boy he saw die this way, didn’t seem to like it. But mother is different, she’s not some pathetic Muggle.
He turns Hermione’s face backwards and kisses her. He forces his tongue inside Hermione’s mouth. She tries to bite him, only to find Greyback laugh into the kiss.
“I could ask dad,” Harold says with a grin on his face. They both know it’s all a fantasy. Mr Malfoy is a pureblood, with great connections in the Ministry. There is no way mom and dad will get rid of him. Not as long as he’s still useful.
Suddenly the hat on top of Neville burst into flames. Neville screams as the flames lick around his face. They heath up and Neville closes his eyes in a strange attempt to protect them. He’s in agony, as the flames burn his hair and face. They slowly travel down his body, licking over his neck and putting his clothes on fire. His entire body turns into one big torch. The pain is unbearable and Neville wishes he would pass out so all will be over.
Only Narcissa hadn’t run. She had stayed and had tried to comfort Draco in his pain. She had watched him struggle until one day he found his voice and had done the Dark Lord’s bidding. He had killed Dumbledore and found his way into the good graces of the Dark Lord. He had found out about Snape’s betrayal and had saved them all. The Dark Lord had taken him into his bed and Draco had grown to become a man his father would have been proud of.
He only makes it four paces from the crowd before he’s hit by a Crucio and he falls to the ground. It’s like knives slice open his entire body. Neville can’t hold on to his wand and it falls away from him and rolls out of reach.
Harold lets his hand slide over his mother’s face. She’s just as beautiful as daddy when Bellatrix takes his cock in her mouth.
Draco moves away from him and hides behind Bellatrix. He takes a hold of her robes and Harold wishes his mother would set him down so he could hold Draco’s hand.
Dean looks at the sword in his right hand and smiles at it. He strokes it before he closes his other hand around the shaft and holds it firm.
When it’s just the two of them, Rodolph asks Harold to hold his cock. Harold doesn’t mind moving his hand up and down on it, but it’s kind of boring. He likes kissing better. But it makes his dad moan and fall apart in pleasure. And that is what is most important.
“Good,” Rodolph answers. He bends down and gives Harold a kiss on his lips. His mouth lingers for a second, his tongue stroking Harold’s lip. Harold opens his mouth and lets his father in. It’s strange, but nice, having Rodolph’s tongue explore his mouth.
Harry’s head snaps back to Voldemort. “You promised you wouldn’t harm them if I surrendered,” Harry shouts.
“Yes, she does. And she loves having sex with them as she tortures them. But the one thing she likes the best is when I hurt her a little during the sex. So tonight we’re going to hurt her a little.”
The world around Neville turns bright and colourful. Neville smiles as he looks around to find himself in a beautiful meadow. He lets his hands slide through the flowers as he walks towards the small home at the edge of a massive forest. Everything is bright and beautiful. The air smells fresh and animal sounds are all around him. Neville opens the door of the cabin and is greeted by a tight hug from his mother. He spots his father close by and he signs. He’s safe and at peace, in the place he always wanted to be when he was still alive, the loving home he never experienced before.
Rodolph smiles at her. “You’re the best,” he says before he kisses her. Together they leave the room, walk down the stairs, step over Potter’s body and leave the cottage. As soon as they reach the street they apparate back to their home.
And then Rodolph starts to move. He slides out a little, just to thrust back in. The pain inside Harold slowly disperses as another feeling takes over. He’s never felt this full in his life. It’s good and nice. Harold’s cock tingles and slowly hardens. Rodolph notices and starts to stroke it. Harold knows he can’t come like his dad, that he’s still too young. But that doesn’t change that it feels good. Better than Harold has ever felt in his life.
The white of King Cross Station fades away as the train leaves the station. The world around Harry turns black as pain shoot through his entire body. It’s like someone has put an eternal Cruciatus curse on him. Harry screams as he starts to fall. He burns and aches all over as he tumbles down a never-ending pit for the rest of eternity.
“It’s what you always wanted, so why wait. You’ve got me. I’m here. You can kill me. Nobody else is going to die today because of me,” Potter declares.
Dean doesn’t think. He let’s go of Luna who still cries into his shoulder. With speed, he dives for the Sorting hat and pulls out the sword. He turns and lashes at Nagini. Her head falls to the ground and her body shivers. A dark cloud explodes from her and Voldemort screams.
Narcissa lets out a howling scream when she sees the knife slice open Draco’s throat. Blood spurts out of the wound and Draco’s body convulses. The Dark Lord moves away from Draco and he falls forwards on the Potter boy. Narcissa hears the Dark Lord laugh but she doesn’t look at him, she only sees the blood spreading over the forest floor. A shiver runs over Narcissa’s back. She stares at the motionless body of her son. His hair spread around his head, slowly darkening from the blood that still leaks from his wound. Narcissa doesn’t care what will happen, she needs to keep his hairs clean. Draco always took great proud in his Malfoy locks. Narcissa can’t let them get drenched with dirt. Without thinking, or caring about the consequences, she rushes forward and pulls Draco in her arms. She lets her wand slide over his hairs, cleaning them with care, making sure they are as pristine as always.
Potter doesn’t look at anyone else except the Dark Lord. He doesn’t seem to notice all the Death Eaters around him, slowly creeping closer. Draco does and he wonders what they all think of this pathetic small boy that taunts their leader. He’s no threat and that is clear. Maybe now they will see the Dark Lord for the idiot he is.
Harry wants to say that Draco’s statement is invalid, as he is dead too, but at that moment two trains ride onto the platform, a white and a black train, parked on both sides of them. Harry looks around again and recognises King-cross station. It’s only white now, and empty and clean. So different from all the times he’s been there, but somehow still the same. It brings a smile on his face.
Harold smiles as the woman does as she’s told. The boy starts to crawl at the rope around his neck with his hands, as his legs try to kick Rodolph off of him. Rodolph just takes a firmer hold on the boy’s hips and thrusts in harder.
“I won’t,” Harold answers. He doesn’t like uncle Lucius either. Harold hasn’t missed the bruises on Draco’s arm, no matter how hard Draco tries to hide them. Harold knows it shouldn’t be hard to make them go away with some magic. He’s had brushes from time to time for the games he plays with his parents during the night. But as soon as he discovers them he shows his dad that will heal them in an instant. That uncle Lucius won’t heal Draco’s shows how mean the man is. Harold wants to grow up and then kill him for all the times he’s hurt Draco.
Harold swallows in the hope his heartbeat will leave his throat. “You want me to kill you?” he asks softly. The idea fascinates and scares Harold at the same time. To watch the light go out in Draco’s eyes, see that white sheen cover them for his eternal stare into nothing, it will be beautiful. But the idea of going through life without Draco by his side. To go to Hogwarts without the love of his life. It will be a nightmare.
“Nagini, he’s all yours,” Voldemort says. He steps away from Neville’s corps and joins his Death Eaters. His pet snake crawls towards Neville’s body. She’s going to eat him, isn’t she?
Draco pushes his cock against Potter’s lips. Potter fights against him and keeps his lips firmly closed.
“Hello Draco,” Dumbledore greets the other boy. “I didn’t expect to see you here.” A puzzled look goes over his face before it returns to a smile.
Harold slumps into his dad’s arms. He’s trembling all over from the excitement. Rodolph holds him for some time and then lifts him from the table. He caries Harold out of the dungeon, leaving the dead woman on full display. They go to one of the bathroom and Rodolph takes his time to wash all the blood from Harold. When they are both clean, Harold kneels and takes his dad’s cock in his mouth. Rodolph fucks his mouth. He takes Harold’s hair in his hand and pushes his cock into Harold’s throat. Harold’s world starts to spin now that he can’t breathe. His hands on Rodolph’s hips slip away and then his eyes roll to the back of his head. Sperm fills his throat and then the world goes dark.
Harold nods and thinks. “What if one of us runs around the bird, while the other stays in his place. That way we can get the rope around its neck without coming close.”
“Give it to me,” the Dark Lord orders. Draco wonders if the Dark Lord is planning to kill Potter with a knife instead of the killing curse. It’s not his style, it’s the way aunt Bella likes to kill people, make them bleed and suffer. She always complains the killing curse is to fast, to easy. And Draco agrees. Let this silly boy feel the pain of death before it takes him. Draco wants to see him bleed, watch the life slowly fade out of him. The killing curse would be to kind for Potter. If only it was his choice, his place to make this decision. Draco would make it perfect.
And then Rodolph pushes him further onto his cock and the scarf tightens even more. The world turns black and Harold passes out. His limp body hangs backwards as Rodolph pulls him up and down on his cock until he releases his sperm inside Harold. Then he throws Harold off him and leaves him naked and dirty on his bed. Tonight they won’t wake up with Rodolph in their bed. Not now that it’s clear that Harold has chosen his favourite.
With his hands free he takes a hold on both sides of the rope around the woman’s neck. He pulls it tight for a bit, killing the woman’s screams of pain for a couple of seconds. Then he loses it up again. The woman coughs around it and takes in deep breaths. Over and over Harold strangles her for some time. Each time a little longer.
Harold picks up the knife and lets it slide over the woman’s chest and stomach. He makes small cuts from time to time. His tongue licks over the blood that spills out of them. The woman trashes around him, unable to stop Harold’s assault on her. Harold smiles as he pushes the knife in a little deeper at her side. A muffled scream comes from her. Harold laughs and then stabs the woman again, now in her stomach. He pulls out the knife and watches the blood spill from the wounds. Then he puts the knife down and loosens the rope around the woman’s neck.
“It was my idea, will you tell uncle Lucius? I don’t want Draco to be in trouble because of me,” Harold says.
“This might hurt a little,” Rodolph says as he lifts Harold’s legs and lays them over his shoulders. His cock pushes against Harold’s hole and Harold holds his breath. This is it. He’s going to lose his virginity tonight. He bites his bottom lip when Rodolph pushes a little inside him. He goes slow and it hurts a bit. Harold tries to relax and let it happen to him. He closes his eyes and thinks of Draco. Of kissing him and taking off his clothes. Of laying naked in bed together, exploring each other's bodies with their hands and lips.
Aunt Bella circles around Potter. Her wand hand reaches out and in seconds Potter lies on the floor, screaming in agony. Draco can hear the Dark Lord in his mind. ‘Take him, degrade him to nothing, and then let me kill him.’
“Don’t make me go,” Malfoy pleads. “I’ll do anything,” he begs. “I’ll do anything you want me to. Just please don’t make me take this train.”
“Not if he gets his kicks tonight,” Draco answers. “He’ll be in a good mood when they’re done with the Muggle.”
Dobby returns with a large rope and Draco and Harold both take an end. “You can go now, Dobby,” Draco says. The elf disappears, but Harold thinks it’s still close by so he can see what they are going to do with the rope.
“No, not like that,” Rodolph says as he lays down on the bed next to Harold. “Tonight we’re going to show you something beautiful. The pleasure there is to be found in pain is amazing.”
When Harold wakes up again, he lays in his dad’s arms. Rodolph is sound asleep next to him. A blanket is pulled over them. Harold looks towards the other side of the bed. Bellatrix is staring at him and places a soft kiss on the top of his head.
“Seamus, where are you?” Dean asks the sky. “I’m thirsty,” he says. His hands tremble in the pool of blood that grows around him. His breaths become shallow and he feels tired. He should just close his eyes and rest. Maybe he will be warmer when he wakes up. Seamus will be back and the world will be warmer. Sunny and bright.
Harold stares up at the stars. His head rests on Draco’s stomach and Draco’s hand plays in Harold’s hair. Greg walks around them, around the balcony and then back into Harold’s room. Vincent is inside, probably still enjoying the food Binky brought them earlier this evening. Tomorrow is Harold’s seventh birthday and that’s why they have a little sleepover. Theo couldn’t make it. Not that Harold minds. He’s not a big fan of Theodore. The boy thinks he’s better than them. Merlin knows why. But he clearly doesn’t like the way Draco and Harold associate with each other. Greg and Vincent on the other hand don’t seem to mind. They’ve seen Harold kiss Draco. Like properly kiss him, with tongue and all. And all they did was raise their shoulders and continue with their game.
When they come up for air they are both flustered. But it’s not enough. Harold wants more. He wants to be just as close to Draco as he’s to his father. With care, he pushes Draco’s trouser down a little with his hand.
After some time Rodolph takes his wand and spells some lube on Draco’s fingers. Draco pushes them in Harold’s hole to open him up for Rodolph’s cock, which is hard and leaking in anticipation.
“She will,” Rodolph promises. He binds the woman's hand above her head and then breaks the Imperius curse.
“You bastard,” Ron shouts. It’s enough to break the silencing charm leid upon them and noise is heard all around Neville. But Neville doesn’t join in. He stares at the body underneath Voldemort’s feet. Voldemort has one foot on Harry’s head, pushing it into the ground, slowly splitting open the scalp of his dead body.
Narcissa lays the robe on the ground next to Draco. She takes her wand and lifts Draco into the air and then places him on top of the robe. She kneels next to Draco and kisses him on the forehead. “I love you,” she tells him. With shaking hands she lifts one side of the robe and folds it over Draco’s body, covering half his face. Then she takes the other side to cover him up completely. The robe isn’t long enough and Draco’s calves and feet stick out. But it’s the best that Narcissa can do. And at least his manhood isn’t on full display anymore, or the awful muggle way he found his end.
The boy’s eyes are open, but they look different as if a white sheen has covered them. His tongue hangs out of his mouth and a small trace of saliva drips from his face onto the counter. His hands lay motionless next to his face. His neck is covered with scratch marks from his fight against the rope that was killing him. The rope still in his mother’s hands.
Harold gets pushes against Rodolph’s chest and the hand on his throat squeezes. Harold can’t breathe. His body starts its fight for life as his dad fucks him hard. They move forward so that Harold’s head is next to Draco’s. Harold pushes his tongue out of his choking mouth so he can lick Draco’s cheek. The world begins to spin and Harold’s head hurts. He shudders and his arms jerk around him. Rodolph pushes him down on Draco, pushing their naked bodies against each other. It’s enough to have to feeling of perfect pleasure rip through Harold. Once it’s over the pain and terror flushes back. Harold his eyes spin to the back of his head and he wants to scream. Only he can’t. He has no air. Panic takes over and then the world just ends.
They both laugh. Harold has no idea why, but it isn’t the first time his parents act weird when it comes to him. They think he doesn’t notice, but Harold isn’t stupid. Every time he does something devious they get all giddy.
Narcissa takes her bra off and points her wand at it. The bra turns into a sturdy rope and Narcissa smiles. She ties one end of the rope around her neck and then steps on the grave she just made for Draco. She throws the other end of the rope over the branch of the tree that she can reach. She stands on the tip of her toes and then points her wand at the rope. A tight knot is formed around the branch. Narcissa tries to stand down on her feet, but she can’t. The rope is nice and tight around her neck, and if she would take her toes off the ground, she will hang.
Hermione turns her head away from the bodies and looks at the man standing next to her. Fenrir Greyback smiles at her as he places one of his hands on her back. The other hand grabs one of Hermione’s breast. Hermione shivers and it’s like her body suddenly remembers that she’s still in a war zone and that she needs to fight. She won’t let this horrible person use her. She won’t become the next Neville Longbottom. Not if she has any say in it.
“Kiss your doom,” Greyback tells her. He pushes Hermione’s face against the blade and Hermione obeys. What other choice does she have? She going to die anyway. And maybe Greyback will kill her quicker if she stops fighting against him. If she stops being fun.
“It seems that Longbottom has perished,” Voldemort says. Dean looks at the man. His red eyes twinkle and he smiles. “Nicely cooked, isn’t he?” Voldemort jokes.
Harold looks at his dad and bites his bottom lip. They’ve been talking about it, that Harold is loose enough these days that he will enjoy it. Harold has seen his father fuck other boys, seen how he enjoyed their pain. But when it comes to Harold, Rodolph never wants him to get hurt. Not if it’s not intentional anyway. He still likes it when Harold fights to get air in his longs when Rodolph’s cock is stuck in Harold’s throat. When Harold starts to slam his hands against anything he can find as his body fights to survive. It never takes long for Rodolph to empty his cock in Harold’s throat when that happens.
“Don’t you touch him,” Narcissa shouts at Bellatrix. The sisters stare at each other until Bellatrix just shakes her head and walks away from them.
Rodolph lays his arm around Bellatrix her shoulders. “Don’t worry, Bella, our Lord knows what he’s doing. Tonight is the night we win and take over this world. Trust me, it’s all going to be perfect.”
“Don’t say that. He means well,” Draco whined. He always whines when he talks about his father. Harold doesn’t understand. But his dad is never angry with him. It’s only his mom that sometimes yells at him when he does something he’s not supposed to. But Harold never has to question if she loves him. He knows she does. She loves and trusts Harold, she proves it every time she joins Harold and Rodolph in bed, or in the bathtub. Harold loves taking baths with his parents, he loves being pushed under the water. It always becomes a mess as Harold can’t stop his arms and legs from kicking around while he struggles to breathe, but it’s fun and exhilarating. Never knowing if this time might be the last.
Harold bites his bottom lip and thinks about it. “What would it be like, freezing to death? Do you think you’ll suffer, or will you be too numb to feel it?” Harold asks.
“You will never be too old to be carried,” Rodolph says. “I will carry you to bed even when your fifty-six.”
Rodolph laughs and shakes his head. “What if I say you will get something you want now that Draco has gone home,” he says.
“Why does he get to choose?” Malfoy shouts as he inches another step closer to the black train. His hand push in the air, in the hope it will make him stop moving towards the train that will only bring him pain and suffering.
Harry looks at the white train. He wants to move to the train and let it take him to whatever comes next. He knows it’s safe to take the white train. But he doesn’t feel it pull him closer like the black train is forcing Malfoy. Harry turns his head and looks at the black train. He shivers and he knows somehow that the train is evil and will only bring suffering. Draco still fights every step he takes that brings him closer to that train and Harry understands. He would fight it to if it was him.
“Stand aside, you silly girl, stand aside now,” the Dark Lord tells her. Bellatrix doesn’t understand why her Lord would want to spare the woman.
“She’s all yours,” he says. Bellatrix doesn’t hesitate. A Crucio passes her lips and Potter’s wife falls to the floor, screaming in pain. Bellatrix laughs and casts another, and another. Rodolph has his arms around Bellatrix again and he kisses her neck.
“Well, I’m here. Wherever here is.” Malfoy waves his hand around and then looks back at the crying part of Voldemort’s soul.
Greyback slices the blade against Hermione’s neck, making small incisions. Hermione lets it happen. She lets her arms hang beside her body. She stares around Narcissa at the tree in front of her. She reads the words engraved in its trunk. Draco Malfoy, the best son that ever lived. The words sound wrong. Malfoy was a bully, a killer. Why did he get a grave, while Harry, Neville and Dean’s bodies will rot in the open air once all this is over?
When her urine starts to flow and soaks her panties, Narcissa regrets her decision. She should have just used her wand to end it. But she wanted to make a statement. She wanted to show the Dark Lord what happens when you destroy a family of purebloods. It was foolish to think that others will stop following him if they hear in what kind of degrading way Narcissa died. It was all for nothing. The only problem is, that there is no way back. Her wand lays on the ground, out of reach. And even if it was in reach, Narcissa doesn’t think she could have taken hold of it, as her body moves only out of her control. It vibrates in its fight to find oxygen that will never enter Narcissa’s longs again.
They all agree and get up. They spend the rest of the night discussing what they have just seen. And Harold ends up in bed with Draco with just their pants on, their bodies entwined before they fall asleep.
Harold has no clue how long they kiss. At one hand it feels like it goes on forever and on the other end, it feels like it was only seconds before their lips part again. Draco smiles at Harold and Harold leans in again to kiss those lips once more.
Potter pales and Draco shakes his head. “You’re pathetic, Potter. You should follow through when you cast a spell like that, not whine and run away.”
“Now, let’s go find a quiet place,” Fenrir says. He starts to walk again and pulls a screaming and kicking Hermione with him. Dean can’t do a thing to help her as he’s unable to move. The only thing he can do is stare at the darkening sky above him.
Ted and Amy became close personal friends of theirs, even outside of the sex club. They would often get dinner and hang out together, sometimes it would end in sex with a partner swap (or a spanking swap), sometimes they would just go out and eat as a friendly couple - no sex involved at all. It was nice that they had another couple who practiced domestic discipline to relate to.
She and Draco returned, Draco carrying a platter full of saucy chicken breasts over sauteed asparagus, and Amy carrying bowl of salad. The two subs got busy serving their doms before adding some food to their own plates.
"I didn't have rules as a child," Draco pointed out. "And you had too many rules with no control over them. We're just fixing things now. So, what's one thing I do that really bothers you that you want to fix?"
When Amy and Draco arrived in the bedroom, their faces cleaned and looking very ashamed of themselves, they announced the kitchen was clean.
You know it's true, that if any of his semen is still in you, you both will be in for the punishment of your lives. "I'll suck you off after I come," you promise. Ronald grins and continues thrusting, and reaching his hand down to cup your ass as he's doing it. It doesn't take long before you feel that feeling deep in your abdomen as the orgasm rips through you and your thrash underneath Ronald and his massive cock. He keeps pounding through your orgasm and you feel it like you've never felt it before. At long last you lay still and Ronald pulls his cock out. It's soaked with your natural juices.
You are there for a long time. So long that you start to suspect they've forgotten you. But a long time later, they both come back into the parlor. "Put your hands on the wall," Draco orders.
"Yes sir," Draco said, watching as the Dom undid his pants and pulled them off. This Dom's cock was enormous, and it was no wonder he'd managed to get three little cocksluts to worship it. Draco's eyes went wide as the Dom jerked himself to a full erection.
Their chastity devices were removed, then Ted conjured two hard wooden chairs side by side and had each of the subs sit in them. Their legs were splayed open and ankles bound to the legs of the chairs, while their hands were bound behind their backs. Draco's cock was jutting north and Amy's pussy was shiny and wet with her own natural lubricant.
Draco was so good at this. When they had first gotten together Harry was impressed at how Draco could deep-throat like that. It was something he himself struggled with, though not for a lack of trying. Draco relaxed his jaw and went all the way down on Harry, until his nose was buried in Harry's dark pubic hair. Harry could feel the head of his cock making contact with the back of Draco's throat and when Draco moaned it sent a delicious vibration through Harry's cock and right into his balls and the rest of his body.
"Once your punishment is over," Harry said. "You need to stand there and think about what you've done."
He grabbed Draco's hair and began fucking his face, thrusting his dick in and out of that pert little mouth of Draco's with the pouty pink lips. He wanted Draco to know that he was dominating him. "Just like that, you submissive little cocksucker," he said, wondering where that voice was coming from. "Keep sucking me."
Harry, looking at Draco, said back, "Your ass is amazing, Ted. The tightest asshole I've ever had." He began thrusting.
You are so nervous the entire week leading up to your weekend with your Masters. What could they have in store for you? You know it'll be a weekend filled with punishments, and you know that you absolutely deserve it.
"We have bathroom rules this weekend," Draco said. He holds your hand and leads you to the backyard. "You'll pee outdoors," he said. "I want you to pee, then run three laps around the yard to give your legs a little exercise after kneeling so much for dinner and the dessert of our come."
"Yes Sir," Draco said. He got out of the bed and made his way to the door. He was still wearing only the chastity device and Harry could see bruising on his backside from his punishments yesterday.
They are such good Masters to recognize it right away. They stroke your hair and tell you what a good sub you are, they say you're beautiful and how proud they are that you edged four times in two hours. You calm down and get a feeling in your chest. This is a feeling that is telling you that you're happy here, that you're contented. After so long looking for a new Dom after you left your last one, you weren't sure you'd get that. Things are still new-ish here, but you just know they're going to work out.
"Yes, sir," Draco said. He turned to go into the kitchen while Harry and Blaise went to the dining room to await their food.
Harry tried to concentrate on his dinner, but seeing his husband nude and submissive while eating, knowing that he has to stand because of something Harry did to him, was making him powerfully horny. They got through dinner with some mild conversation and Draco cleared the table. "Come back in here before washing the dishes," Harry said.
Harry and Ted would stop what they were doing every now and then to look at their subs. Both Amy and Draco were straining at their restraints, so anxious were they to get their hands all over themselves. Harry could only imagine how awful it would be to be as erect as Draco now was with no way of getting your cock touched, no way of getting that release. And Amy over there, her cunt absolutely glistening and dripping. He could practically smell her sex and desire from where he was sitting. She was trying to thrust her hips, trying for any sort of friction that just wasn't there.
The Masters leave to the dining room while you get the food to serve them. You take it in and pour them wine, then retire to the kitchen to each by yourself. You don't know if you should take the dress off or not. You decide to leave it on.
Draco nodded, but he still looked anxious. Harry added, "Why don't you go whip up some breakfast, and we'll decide what to do today before we leave for Madame Kat's."
As soon as Draco's body tightened as he was coming, Harry couldn't take it anymore and his own release flooded Draco's asshole. But he didn't slow down, he kept pounding and pounding, loving the feeling of his own jizz slicking the tight asshole of his lover.
You and Ronald kneel before them and get to sucking. You are sucking Master Harry, while Ronald is sucking Master Draco. Ronald makes appreciative noises in his throat while sucking and it sounds like he really enjoys having Draco's hard cock thrust down his throat. Both the Masters pull out and come on your faces. You and Ronald stay in the kneeling position, the semen cold and starting to drip off your chin, waiting to be allowed to get up. It takes ten minutes and you knees are starting to hurt before they tell you to go wash up. You are ordered to get naked, not that the blue dress, pulled down and pushed up by now, is hiding much.
"I'm going to remove the chastity device. You'll get hard almost immediately, and since you've been such a good boy who learned his lesson. We are going to allow you to decide how you want to come."
Draco shook his head, his eyes closed in concentration. "Can you help me take care of my ass? It's really very painful."
Harry stood to the side and let his hand hit Draco's backside. "One!" Draco said. Just like last time, the spankings got progressively harder. "Two! Three! Four! Five!"
Because god did he want to come. And even though he knew he wanted to, he hadn't earned that right yet.
"Yes Master Draco." You scurry up the stairs and go to the closet. There is the tiny blue dress, the one you wore that first weekend with the Masters when they had food delivered. You remember with relish how it felt to be stared at so wantonly by the delivery driver.
"The lady who owns that, Kat Wellington, is a dominatrix. I paid a pretty penny for a whole weekend with her and she had me wearing that the entire time and it was absolute torture."
You look between them and chant, "Master Harry, Master Draco. Master Harry, Master Draco..." over and over. You lose count and your mind starts to wander and you're sure you've said it far more than twenty times, but the Masters don't stop you. Eventually you stop on your own and they look satisfied.
"I know it does, but I think it could really work!" Draco said. "I want to be a better person, but being selfish and spoiled is so ingrained in me, I don't know if I can change. And being soft and allowing people to walk all over you is so ingrained in you. It cold help us both!"
The Masters sleep in the bed and you and Ronald are in sleeping bags off to one side. Ronald is ordered to wake up early to make breakfast.
Draco came into the study a while later, wearing a frilly apron over his chastity belt, and said, "Dinner is served Harry."
They give you a quick spanking before handing you back your work clothes so you can go back to your own flat and start the rest of your week tomorrow.
"Exactly," he says. "And you proved my point by practically sucking that man's dick. You are a slut."
"It's one thing to fuck other people, but I'm not sure I like you spanking someone else. That's our thing."
Harry settled himself in the arm chair to watch as Blaise made Draco work him over with his hand before lubing up, and pushing himself balls deep into Draco's asshole. Draco had never taken two dicks in one day in his asshole, but it quivered in excitement around Blaise's cock. Blaise kept up a punishing speed and spilled his load soon enough.
You stop to think, because what was average with Sir? "Well," you say. "If it was just me there that weekend, I would awaken when he set the alarm for me. I slept in a large cage at the foot of his bed. I would shower and get myself ready for him, which meant in whatever outfit he picked out for me. Often it was leather and tight, sometimes it was nothing at all. Then when a second alarm went off, I got into bed and awoke him with my mouth on his cock. I sucked him off until he was fully awake and he would come. He sometimes had to work in his office and I would be there as decoration, sometimes I had to masturbate in front of him. He rarely allowed me to come. When work wasn't going well, he would have me do physical tasks. He liked to watch me jump rope, he would have me stand in the corner. He spanked me often. Sometimes he would just ignore me. But he also would call me names and humiliate me. If there were other subs there that weekend, he would choose one of us who would get it the worst and we would be kicked around, slapped around and told we were worthless. And always, I had to be ready to do whatever he wanted."
You arrive at your Masters' house after leaving work on Friday evening. It was a long week at work, and you are looking forward to shedding your corporate boss persona and being used and abused at your Masters' hands. Every time you thought about the weekend whilst at work, you couldn't help but feel an anxious yearning between your legs.
He stands and begins dressing. YOu don't look at him and you're sure he knows better than to look at you. You stay right where you are on the floor. You know not to move a muscle until your Masters give you permission. You are trying to control your tears, but your ass hurts so bad.
"You're breaking two rules right now. You must clean what I say, and you must serve me with a good attitude. Now drop your pants and come here." Harry sat on the couch.
"Good little subs don't have to wear diapers," Harry reminded you. You nod in understanding. "Go outside with Draco and he will hose you down."
Harry went back to his study. He left the door of the bedroom opened to listen for any sounds that might sound like Draco sneaking for a seat or shifting around too much. A few weeks earlier, Harry had caught Draco kneeling during a half-hour corner time punishment and had added fifteen minutes to the corner as well as an additional three spanks for it. He was pretty sure Draco would not try that again. After a half hour, Harry got up and quietly stuck his head in the bedroom. Draco was still standing stock still, facing the corner. Harry smiled and went back to his work.
By about day four, the newness had started to wear off and Harry started noticing Draco not being as compliant. He still woke before Harry and still had Harry's lunch ready for him, but it was without a smile. That day over breakfast, Harry said to Draco, "Your chore for today is to clean the toilets. Both bathrooms need to be washed and scrubbed. I noticed the bathtub is getting a ring."
"Of course, and it's all terrible," Draco answers. Harry laughs. You imagine this is how their morning routine always is, with Harry cooking whilst Draco reads the paper and complains about the day's news. Harry sits and you serve up the breakfast he made. Eggs with toast and fruit salad. You stand there and wait for permission to each.
He knew Draco really hated doing lines, so that was definitely on the table. As soon as they finished eating breakfast, Harry got a roll of parchment, which was four feet long, and ordered Draco to fill it with lines. He was to write out rules number five ("Draco gets a personal allowance for personal items and is not permitted to go over that monthly allowance) and number seven ("Draco is to respect Harry's ultimate authority in the household and willingly submit to any disciplinary acts that Harry deems necessary.)
Draco whined, but raised his ass a little higher in the air, as if he was anxiously awaiting a spanking. Blaise laughed, "Draco you naughty little bitch," and he brought his hand down across Draco's ass with a loud smack.
This wasn't punishment for Draco, who loved nothing more than having his mouth stuffed with cock. Harry knew what an excellent experience this Dom was going to have with Draco's pert little mouth stretched around that massive phallus. And sure enough, the Dom's eyes went wide with surprise as Draco opened wide and took him nearly to his hilt. Just watching Draco work his mouth over the massive piece of meat in front of him really did it for Harry. The cocksluts were still working Harry over with their tongues and their words. While Harry felt his own balls being licked from taint to front, he watched as Draco used his finger to press on the Dom's taint while he deep-throated his cock.
1- Every day, Harry will give at least one cleaning chore for Draco to do. It must be done by the time Harry gets home from work.
The thrusting slowed, their breathing was heavy but evening out, and Harry pulled his cock from Draco. Draco fell to the floor, his body limp.
You run upstairs and get ready in the loo before heading into the bedroom. You crawl into that huge bed that's made for more than two and feel so alone, missing your Masters. You just start to drift off when they come in. They move you to the side and ignore you as they wrap themselves in each other, making love like any married couple would. Only this married couple has a submissive slut watching them, hoping to be touched.
"Yes," he said after you apologize profusely. "We are easing into it a bit. We are trying to find our way as well. Can you be patient with us?"
Carly straddled him, position his dick above her entrance. Harry could see how slick and shiny it was. The naughty little thing was turned on by his roughness. She slid down on his cock and began thrusting. Gods, but it had been a while since Harry's cock had probed the depths of a woman's warmth. He thrust in rhythm and reached over instintively to thumb at her clit. She cried out, "I'm not allowed to come!"
"His mum is getting married again," Draco answered. "He'll be here for a few days, and wants to meet up for lunch and drinks tomorrow."
"Thank you, Draco," Harry said, carefully replacing the paperwork in the folders and getting up to follow Draco to the dining room.
Draco was hesitant and didn't move. Harry stood up and flipped Draco over on the couch so his bruised and welted ass was in the air. Harry brought his hand down as hard as he could over Draco's ass, making Draco cry out. "Stand up!" he said.
Hermione gets a slightly angry look on her face and looks you right in the eye as she lightly slaps you across the face. You realize what you've done. "Listen Girl," she says in a stern voice. "When I asked if I could touch, who do you think I was talking to?"
Harry took time to stretch and shower before heading downstairs where Draco was working on scrambling eggs. He had a platter of bacon and a bowl of fruit already situated on the dining room table. "It looks great," he said to Draco, planting a kiss on his cheek. Complimenting a submissive was so important to creating a safe environment for them.
You nodded your head, and he slapped his hand across your ass. You jump. "That's nothing to be proud of, you know," he said. "Being such a whore that even a wooden chair makes you wet." He sticks a finger roughly in your pussy and pulls it out, "Suck your juices," he demands and you suck on his finger. Your pussy felt so good with even just one thrust from his finger, but it left you craving even more.
Back at their house, Draco and Harry were talking themselves to sleep. "Are you OK I spanked someone else?" Harry asked.
You wait patiently while the Masters each sit at their own desks doing some work. You realize that you don't even know what kind of work they do! Then again, they don't know about your corporate life, except that your weekends with them are a welcome break from being in charge.
He began to stroke, and stroke, and stroke some more. Draco was whining and moaning, sounds that made Harry want to nut right there, but he'd been trained. He knew that he couldn't come until Harry gave the order and though Harry was anxious for his own release, he enjoyed the torture he knew it was putting Draco through to have to wait to come.
You start to cry, but Draco has no sympathy as he places three hard smacks on your wet and already aching butt. He forcefully leads you back into the house and marches you up the stairs where he promptly puts another diaper on you. You are so ashamed and humiliated now but not enough to use your safeword.
Ronald is ordered to make us dinner, while you are sent up to the bedroom to set up some sleeping bags on the floor of the Masters' bedroom for me and Ronald to sleep in. The four of you eat together in the dining room. Ronald seems to be a very attentive sub, always willing to jump up to fetch more wine or whatever the Masters need.
"Intense," Harry said. "Our relationship has been a little more about domestic dominance and submission. It's only gotten into the bedroom a few times."
When Harry had bought the chastity device from Madame Kat at The Cat in Heat in Diagon Alley, she mentioned that she ran a sex club every Saturday night. it was a free-for-all in terms of sexual activity, plus a separate section for those interested in BDSM. She thought Harry and Draco might be interested in that.
From the depths of his closet and into his hand, zoomed the Celebrate Celibate magical chastity belt, still in it's box.
You rush to stand next to him and he has a devilish look on his face. He pulls an ice cube out from his glass and holds it against your nipple. You gasp loudly. It's so cold and your nipple immediately turns into a hard pink pebble. Harry looks at what you're doing and he is grinning now too. "Wait," he orders. Draco removes the ice and your breast begins to warm a bit while Harry is upstairs.
“That you did,” Harry acknowledged. He marked her off on the team roster and saw to it that her equipment went into the right trunks, then exchanged a few words with her mother.
“No.” The word rolled off his tongue of its own accord, bringing with it a sense of relief, and freedom, and a kind of…exhilarating release. Even as he felt a pang of grief, for all that he’d wanted, and all that he’d hoped for…and a pinch in his chest, for the love he still carried for her. “No,” he repeated, with greater conviction. “This is it.”
Crisis averted, Harry cut the blue silk paper into three pieces of the same size and handed them out. Satisfied that they wouldn’t start fighting again, he went to see how Charlie and Betty were doing and wound up helping Betty write greetings in all seven of her cards; one for each of her siblings, one for her parents, and one for her grandmother.
“First of all, translating Ancient Runes is an art in itself and the results are often ambiguous, Harry. We might simply have misunderstood the message, Dumbledore has left us. And even if we didn’t, there could be more than one person involved. That’s why I checked all the names in the first place. If there is indeed a teacher involved, they might simply have an accomplice.”
"Perfect!” Hermione beamed. “Anyway, how did you know it was Otto you wanted to choose among the owls? I mean, he is a real sweetie, but I guess the others were cute as well?" Hermione asked while stroking the soft patch of feathers between Otto’s ears. The owl tried to return the favour by nuzzling Hermione’s hair, which made her squeak.
“Why are you suddenly interested in Magical Arts, Harry? You want to become an artist yourself?” Blaise asked, “Merlin help me, if I’ve got to deal with yet another creative nutcase – Draco’s obsession with dance and music is bad enough.”
“We have talked about it in advance, Auror Jordan, I need you – and you as well Mr Potter – to stay out of sight, when I remove the curtain, which I have been told is draped in front of the portrait of aunt Walburga. I need her to trust me,” Narcissa Malfoy whispered with a look of stern concentration on her face, “which I think she might as she happens to be my godmother.”
Head inside of a kitchen cupboard, he had turned abruptly, when something big had fluttered behind his back – thus banging his head on the shelf. Rubbing furiously at the bump-to-be, he stared at a snow owl. The bird had flown through the open window right into the kitchen of No 12 Grimmauld Place and was now sitting atop the kitchen table.
Startled by their sudden appearance Otto hooted and took refuge at the highest cupboard as Harry rose from the sofa and cleared his voice, “Thank you for coming, Ms Malfoy and Auror – ”
“Oh yes, we need to fight this! Even if you can take it, you shouldn’t have to! And what about the younger kids hearing him talk like that? What kind of message does it send, if we don’t stop him?” Harry pleaded, “And what about some kid still questioning their identity, don’t you think they would never feel safe to come out, if a teacher talks like that?”
Laddley struggled to his feet and shouted, “What the hell are you doing here, Hillborogh?” His face had turned an unpleasant shade of red.
Otto buried his head in Cassy's neck which made her giggle. "You're such a sweety! If Harry ever gets tired of you I'll adopt you - promise!"
“That night at the pub…chhh… I thought we’re both done for. If you hadn’t blasted the wall and called for help… seriously, thank you, Harry.” He coughed and shook his head. “That bastard would have rejoiced in killing us both slowly, whether you had given him what he wanted or not. I still can’t believe that he fooled me – chhh… ”
“Don’t be mean to your sister, Ron,” Hermione elbowed her boyfriend, which made Ron and Ginny laugh at her.
“When exactly did that happen?” McGonagall asked. She seemed to have recovered from the initial shock of Harry’s disclosure.
Harry hesitated a bit before he continued, ”Both Cass and you seem to get along very well with Ginny, don’t you?”
“Kreacher never saw young Master Draco Malfoy at the noble House of… House of Master Harry Potter Sir!”
Flitwick seemed undecided. “Well, Ms Silver, this is a question of respecting another artist’s work… I don’t want to be as intrusive as this one,” he pointed at Taurus’ picture, “but on the other hand, as you said, your painting has been violated before.”
His feelings for the third sister, for Narcissa Malfoy, were far more complicated than his compassion and love for Andromeda or his hatred of Bellatrix. Although Narcissa had never been a Death Eater herself, she was married to one, Lucius Malfoy, presently imprisoned at Askaban for his fierce support of Voldemort. And she had raised Draco Malfoy, the most arrogant prick Harry had ever met – who had become the youngest Death Eater ever, before he was even seventeen. But she had also saved his life, there was no denying that. And now she had invited him ‘
“No, silly. I wouldn’t ask you to read for yourself, if this were runes. It’s just ancient hand writing.” Hermione sighed. “I might as well tell you what it says. The chapter's title is ‘Paintfall’ and it describes how to hex a painting to turn it into a trap for Imagics.”
“Some months of ghastly fights later her parents left Cassiopeia with us, they moved abroad for years. Draco was very happy that they were gone and so was I. Lucius was mostly glad, that the constant fighting had stopped, but he had always blamed his niece for it and now ignored her completely. I told myself Cass just needed some time and pretended the whole issue would simply disappear. Well, it did not.”
“I’m so, so sorry,” Harry murmured against Draco’s neck. “I should not have forced you into hiding!”
After breakfast Harry went back to the common room to wait for Hermione and Ron. Last Saturday he had waited for them at his room, but he wanted to show them the Wizard’s Wood. That was the only reason he spent his morning in the common room. He was certainly not waiting for anybody else to show up, just Hermione and Ron. When they finally appeared, his friends were equally fascinated by the painting, as by Harry’s latest report of Snape’s refined Imagic. They could talk freely about the whole Imagic issue as no other eighth-year entered the common room all morning. Eventually the three of them got their usual load of home work done, thanks to Hermione’s insistence. (Still no sight of Draco.)
Harry wanted to search for the Room of Requirements as soon as everyone had retired for the night and the school was quiet. But Kingsley must have called for a massive backup – all the corridors, every door they had passed were under surveillance.
Harry wondered. Narcissa had not mentioned her son, neither in her invitation nor while walking through the grounds.
Harry was secretly astounded by her shyness towards the staff. She could be a terrible know-it-all, still in all those years at school he had never heard her boast in front of a teacher. Which she would be fully entitled to do, Harry thought. Flying towards Hogsmeade next to Ron he wondered how his best pal dealt with his girlfriend’s superior intelligence.
“And if you still want some extra lessons, I’ll be glad to be of service,” Hermione offered, “at least as long as you help me with Muggle science?”
But if he said yes… and they became more than just friends… the Prophet would have a field day. Josh Jordan dating Harry Potter, two young heroes already well known and closely watched by the public – that was first class gossip material. Harry would need to act carefully, if he wanted to explore his sexuality without having the whole wizarding world watching every move of his. And caution was certainly not his strongest asset.
“What?” Harry frowned. “I don’t understand why he hasn’t told you to practice with us in the first place – I could even learn a thing or two from you! I’ll ask him – if you want me to?”
Hermione shook her head. “Not yet. You know the hex works like a drug… in fact he seemed a bit tipsy.”
“Harry, how can I describe the Manor’s horror to you? Just remember what Walburga Black’s Imagic did to your house and multiply this effect... that’s about what it was like at the Manor when Draco and I were kids. Growing up I was mostly able to ignore those ghastly Imagics, but Draco was –he still is– very sensitive… don’t look so doubtful, Harry, you have no idea… anyway he was really frightened, didn’t want to enter some corridors by himself and had nightmares. Uncle Lucius considered this behaviour ridiculous and did nothing but tease Draco, which made matters worse. Aunt Cissy was devastated. That’s when Taurus jumped in and proclaimed he would do something to help. I think he always fancied Aunt Cissy and wanted to impress her with a gift. Poor mother.”
Cass and Ginny shook off their robes– they were now both dressed in rainbow coloured unitards, that didn’t leave much about their bodies for imagination, and started to dance. The crowd cheered as they whirled around the dance floor and the circle of first-years started a conga line. Soon enough many students joined them. Harry was squeezed into the conga line right behind Draco and with Luna at his heels. He was on cloud nine.
“So while they spruce up – will you tell me what’s going on? Why you are here? David has always been very secretive about school… I just know that you attend some posh boarding school and the two of you didn’t get along for years – which pained David more than he would ever admit, but I guessed as much. Alas, this year you became… friends? Is that right?”
“So you passed your A-Levels? And Harry said you took O.W.L.s as well? Wow, that’s brilliant. I wish I could have done that,” Hermione said with envy, “I used to read Muggle science books during the summer holidays for some years, but since Harry came of age and with being on the run, the war and everything… I’m afraid I gave it up. I’m totally in default with my Muggle education. And Muggle studies lessons at Hogwarts are no help at all. I don’t need lessons about how to use a dishwasher, I want astrophysics!”
“Don’t be daft, Ron! Why would we stay at the common room overnight when we both have our private rooms? No, in fact,” Harry coughed, “we haven’t spent a single night together yet. But we… we met for early morning tea at the common room. Regularly.”
“You wanted to see me, Professor… sorry, Headmistress, what in Merlin’s name has happened?” Harry raised his voice above the noise.
He craned his neck to see where Draco had been put and smiled, seeing him seated between Healer O’Malley and Blaise’s crush Chastity.
He pondered on further questions to ask and suddenly remembered the portrait of Walburga Black. “Did you know Ms Malfoy helped me to get rid of a nasty Imagic? She used a hexed painting to lure her aunt’s Imagic from my house… I assume what she did wasn’t totally law abiding.”
“And there’s hardly any brain in your head obviously!” Malfoy snapped in reply referring to the scarce amount of blue in Harry’s pattern.
– “, she spat that last word out, “nor myself put an end to Taurus’ abuse. We should have evicted him from the Manor! When her mother died we could have adopted Cassy… and Taurus could have been excluded from the legal order of succession.” She nodded vigorously. “That would have put an end to any of his plans to inherit the family fortune and he would not go after my son now.”
“But then my mother died, right at the end of the war. She had taken care of my brother until then, the broken man he had become. Tim needs medical care, regular magical treatments included. He wouldn’t survive at a Muggle facility for very long. So St. Mungo’s is the only option – unless I make enough money to pay for 24/7 magical nursing. Let me tell you, Mr Potter that costs a fortune! I made good money as long as I was abroad, but with my mother gone, I wanted to be closer to Tim. I’m the only one who visits – without me, he has no one.
Snape jumped in. “Filius did not dare to touch her painting without permission but he provided some clothes for Ms Silver in an extra frame. She just had to get dressed there.”
“No, she is coming to Hogwarts in person,” said Snape’s Imagic. “The Aurors want her removed from the Manor in case Taurus Malfoy makes an appearance there. And the Headmistress suggested her transfer to the castle. Maybe she can help to contact her son or even locate his present residence.”
“Well at least Draco’s mum makes good use of it,” Harry said, “She told me about other nasty Imagics she locked into the hexed painting.”
Flitwick continued with a smug smile, “As for your suggestion of a trap painting– be assured there is no such thing, Mr Potter, trust me. I dare say no living witchard knows more about Magical Arts than I do and I most certainly have never heard of any such hex. I am indeed quite sure it is even impossible to create something like that.”
Oddly reassuring as this was to hear, Harry glanced nervously at Draco, waiting for a snort, a vicious remark, any comment at all. Nothing. Draco’s cheeks seemed a bit pink and he chewed at his bottom lip – but kept quiet.
“I even tried to set him free after the war without success. I offered him a t-shirt but he ignored it. Hermione thinks, he’s been in service for so long, that he’s unable to live without a master.” He sighed. “I’ve told him to stay at Hogwarts so he has some company of his own kind at least. He’s been lonely for many years and I don’t really need him at London.”
Harry forced some food down his throat before he changed the subject, “Luna said you wanted to talk to me, Cass? Presumably about the motto for the Halloween ball?”
“As long as you replace my private parts properly, I won’t object,” Ron said with a dirty smirk, which gave Hermione the giggles in a most un-Hermionish way.
“Good to see you again, Harry!” Tavin shouted. “Everything alright with the swimming team?” He looked a bit concerned as if Tommy had not been able to dispel his lover’s worries about Laddley’s behaviour.
“Come off it! Of course not!” Ron shook his head, “it’s just… I had no idea until yesterday evening… about them.” He nodded at Ginny and Cass. “And now I feel like a total moron.”
“Well did you ever… that is extremely considerate of you, Cissy my dear… oh, isn’t that Eridanus winking at me? He is still handsome, don’t you think? I have not seen him since your wedding… and the food looks excellent too.”
Ron nodded. “Just… be careful, Harry. He’s… I know he’s not half as bad as we thought him to be but still… even if he’s no longer a Death Eater, he’s still a fucking Slytherin!”
“Let me guess – you’re plans include being tagged along by my beloved brother and his girlfriend,” Ginny snorted.
“You want a challenge, Otto?” Harry shouted, “Alright, you can have that.” He grinned and shot up in the air. Otto trailed behind him for a few seconds before the excited bird managed to catch up with Harry and immediately fell into a breathtaking dive towards the ground. And with a roar Harry dived right behind his owl. Both of them shot towards the lawn and turned upwards at the very last moment. Full of adrenalin Harry laughed wholeheartedly, this was so much better than any roller coaster ride! On and on they went – up in the air and down towards the ground – until Harry was breathless and Otto seemed satisfied as well.
Harry was immensely relieved to see that his cherished Holly wand and also the invisibility cloak lay side by side within his reach. Not that he could pick them up with these bandages, but still.
In the course of last week the weather had finally turned and heavy winds and downpour had locked them in for days. This morning’s surprisingly mild air with a bit of sun lured everybody outside again.
“Being a Professor he should be clever enough to appreciate your brains,” Ron said winking, “whereas your stupid boyfriend appreciates your other body parts just as enthusiastically.”
Suddenly the dance party seemed to be much more fun than just minutes ago. The atmosphere was jolly, smiling faces all around and Harry was determined to enjoy the evening as well. He watched the crowded dance-floor, occasionally getting a glimpse of Hermione and Draco. When the music ended, they approached Ron and Harry.
Ten minutes later while Harry got dressed, he consciously decided to forget Snape’s remark concerning his relationship with Draco Malfoy. That was just nonsense anyway. No, he simply would not think about it, he said to himself, not at all. He had far more interesting things to ponder than Draco sodding Malfoy.
“You wish,” Hermione snorted, “I’ll be a superb Healer busy growing back missing body parts of yours and your best mate, parts you will have lost by performing illegal and unsafe spells.”
“But – how exactly do you ask a library? Did you just blurt out the question to the room at large and hope for the best or what?” Harry interrupted.
“Let’s go to Gryffindor Tower – I’ve got to tell Ginny,” Ron said as soon as they were outside the Headmistress’ sitting room, “the poor thing has even one more year to endure this blow of fate!”
“Understandably enough. If criminals don’t know what they are up against, that’ll only be to the A.D.’s advantage,” said Harry.
Suddenly he could not hold back any longer, “Ok, so what do you think about the latest news on the Imagic issue? You’ve got no problem with Draco being a suspect, I guess? Come on, let me hear it!”
“Of course I won’t! I’m immensely grateful for her help, and as Josh Jordan was witness of the events, it can’t be all that bad anyway,” said Harry to reassure Cass. “I would just like to understand how this works, the hexed painting I mean.”
“May I remind you, neither of you did any homework yesterday – so you’ve enjoyed one fat break already this week-end!” she replied.
The others chuckled and Harry contemplated, since when his friends were ready to laugh about Draco bloody Malfoy’s jokes… he sighed, closed his eyes and dozed off.
“Yes, Mr Malfoy, I’m afraid I must ask you to. But be assured I would be very pleased to talk to you some other time.” The Imagic bowed slightly as Draco did the same, collected his book and opened the door. Before he left the room, he turned back to look at Harry, who had no idea how to read that final glance.
“Everything alright, Ms Granger?” asked McGonagall looking back at the three students who lingered behind.
“Yes indeed, I feel perfectly safe in his presence,” Daisy continued, “I would not be allowed to be here without him and it is so nice to meet some younger people for a change – most of the Imagics are dreadfully old and boring,” she confided.
Hermione rolled her eyes. “I’m not. I’ve never even met him. Just asking.” Narrowing her eyes sardonically she added, “Come to think of it, it’s always good to have a back-up in case something goes horribly wrong with growing back essential body-parts.”
“We’re… yes, we’re friends… and then some, I hope,” Harry admitted, “it just happened recently and then Draco… sorry, David had to leave…”
“Good morning, Ms Silver,” Hermione addressed the female Imagic. “Nice robes you are wearing! I take it both Mrs Malfoy and the Ministry gave their consent for your clothes?” Hermione asked.
“Always knew it,” he said hugging Hermione tightly, “that eventually someone else would fall for you too! You’re way too smart… and beautiful… and kind! At least this time it’s not a world famous Quidditch player!”
Harry groaned and banged his head on the desk. This was so fucked up! If two people were attracted to each other, if their feelings were mutual, that should be reason enough to feel delighted and exceedingly happy! But Harry felt nothing like that! Instead he felt deflated, confused and – frustrated, actually.
“Fine! That’s settled then! No more whining, let’s celebrate!” Harry said. “A toast to our new Defence teacher!”
That’s what surprised me the most – that he invited my brother as well. I told him my brother was a Muggle, just like our dad, but still Lucius insisted.
The pumpkin rose up high into the air right above the centre of the hall – until the Headmistress waved her wand once again making the pumpkin explod into masses of orange confetti, paper streamers and sparkles. At the same time a surprisingly sweet voice announced, “The motto of this year’s Halloween ball will be ‘
“You two, you’ve got potential! But improving your technique is not enough, you need to build some muscle too. Check out the gym and get wet as often as you can,” Laddley nodded towards the pool. “If you help me teaching the beginners, I’ll give you extra lessons in the evenings – what’ you think?”
With a single wave of her wand she cleared the original board away. Seconds later a low table appeared in front of them, laid with tea, tiny sandwiches and a variety of cakes.
“Hold on – you won’t tell me where you are hiding? But I would never ever tell anyone – not even Ron and Hermione!” Harry was affronted.
“I’ll walk with you, if you don’t mind,” Cass said, “I’m curious about that bird, Aunt Cissy says he’s a bit of a clown?”
"But that’s not exactly what’s going on at the Burrow or at your house… how's the family reconciliation coming along anyway? Are your parents still cross with you?" Ron asked.
“Interesting enough, just like Tharros he spent many years abroad. And no, Ron, I’ve told you already, I’m not getting married any time soon. At least not before I have found myself a proper job and so should you.” She gave her boyfriend a stern look.
Harry nodded in agreement, that was exactly his opinion too. Those very few times the topic of Draco’s dreadful past had come up between them, Draco had seemed painfully aware of his mistakes.
“Listen,” Harry finally interrupted both of the ongoing discussions, “fascinating as all of this might be – Ron and I wanted to tell you something as well. In fact this might be quite useful to know before you interrogate Laddley.”
“Is it true that the UN set great value on anti-discrimination of any kind?” Tavin asked innocently.
Harry groaned. Why had he seen fit to confide in Severus fucking Snapes Imagic of all people? Damn his bloody talent for spontaneous yack!
She addressed Harry again, “Professor Laddley will at least stay two more months and I will recruit someone to work with him on his recovery. At Christmas we will see, if our attempts are fruitful and whether Professor Laddley might stay permanently or not. For now I expect you to be open-minded, Mr Potter, open-minded and discreet, same as the other students who know what has happened. Can you do that and make sure Mr Hillborogh and Mr Zabini understand as well?” She looked expectantly at Harry.
“Don’t be ridiculous, Harry,” said Kingsley, “we are well aware, that you have encountered many unique and extraordinary displays of magic no other witch or wizard has seen before – you shouldn’t forget that either.”
“Ron Weasley, I never said anything like that! And I assure you, being drunk will not increase your chances of having sex – at least not with me.” Hermione said.
Harry mused while filling the kettle and watching Draco. The guy looked immaculate wearing a light blue sweater over his usual white shirt and black pants. Blonde fringe falling into his face, his pale skin glowed softly in the light of the reading lamp at his side. He looked elegant, relaxed and ever so full of himself, Harry thought, at the same time very aware of his own ruffled outfit, stubble on his chin and uncombed hair – not that any combe had ever made a difference to his hair, but still.
Harry laughed out loudly. “No, of course not! What are you insinuating for Merlin’s sake? Daisy is still a kid – and most certainly not my love but a good friend of mine!”
“I’ve walked the length of the beach as you suggested, Filius, and was rewarded with this find–“ he pulled a very crumpled piece of parchment out of his trousers’ pocket. “Obviously Headmistresses Da Ponte and Darknight did exactly what we asked them to, they left us a message!”
When she finally joined them again in front of the painting she held a large paperboard with twenty-five pictures arranged in five columns and five rows. They all showed blonde men and looked like passport photographs, except they were moving of course. Some blinked, some yawned and others looked around the room.
“Oh, Mr Potter!” The matron of Hogwarts blushed, taken by surprise. “Just doing my duty, Mr Potter, but thank you anyway. Are you sure you’ll be alright walking to the guesthouse without help? Or shall I fetch someone to accompany you?”
“Right. So he’s gone and nobody knows why or where to… but who would do such a thing? What for?” Harry felt quite confused, “Can’t the Ministry do anything about it? Surely the Auror Department must investigate, as he was last seen at the Ministry’s archives!”
As eighth-year students were not allowed to be part of Quidditch teams, Harry and Ron just watched Quidditch practice in the early afternoon instead. It was fun to observe the training from the side line and they also wanted to support Ginny, who had the honour of being Gryffindor’s captain this year. She ran the team brilliantly of course and was certainly in no need of advice, but still seemed to enjoy their presence at the stands. Eventually Cass joined them to ask lots of questions about Quidditch. (Which made Harry wonder, why Draco – who was quite a good seeker – hadn’t told her much about the game?)
As Cass had never been to the owlery before, she accompanied Harry up the high tower where his bird lived. Otto hooted excitedly at the sight of his master and another lady friend – at least Otto was not ambiguous about his preference of girls above boys. He flew immediately to greet Cass, sat on her shoulder and made the same funny cooing noise again, that had already amused Hermione. Most of the other owls ignored Harry and Cass completely. Some were fast asleep after a night of hunting, others just came back from a flight or made their leave.
Harry shook his head in disbelief. “I never expected her to have such a good opinion of me. Not with her son and I fighting each other for years.”
“Although Cassy’s damned motto tormented my preferred costume of course,” Draco said winking at Harry, “hardly gender-bending if I dressed up as superhero Potter!”
After the meeting at the Headmistress’ office he had returned to the guest house together with Ron and Hermione. They had run into Dean and Neville who were also on their way back to the eighth-years’ dromitory. The ball had been more or less over by then and Dean complained, “Aurors snooping into every corner, every box – that sure takes the fun out of a party!”
Harry gulped. The sight of this handsome young man fawning over a baby was… a very interesting sight indeed. Teddy seemed to feel exactly the same as his hair turned bright pink and Harry was very much afraid his own cheeks might be the same colour. He ruffled his hair, cleared his voice again and addressed Narcissa.
“Did you go to Hogwarts, Healer O’Malley? Yes? You might know the castle well enough but we’ve had some major changes this summer – maybe you want to have a look around before lunch? I could give you a quick tour, if you want?” Harry suggested and the Healer agreed.
Harry stared at the painting where a group of rather jolly looking wizards and witches sat around a long table obviously having a feast.
“Hah! I was pretty certain you would recognize this most precious stone. You dropped it at the Forbidden Forest, hoping it would never be found again, right?”
Harry gulped and felt a pang of jealousy. How could that even be true? Draco could hardly have fucked around at school without everybody knowing about it – he must have found lovers outside of Hogwarts... Harry stared at Draco trying to digest this information.
“Main reason? I confessed to removing Draco’s tracking spell. You know about that, I assume?” Josh frowned and Harry nodded.
Cass laughed and hugged Harry tight. “Oh Harry, I’m just so, so happy for the two of you! And of course I’ll kick your ass, if you break Draco’s heart, superhero or not.”
“Hi there, lovely readers – Otto would be ever so pleased to read about your thoughts on this story, you know… Whodunit? and what not … (and Auntie just craves comments too)…  also, if you happen to like what you’re reading we’d be delighted if you spread the link social media wise. Thank you for your attention!”
“Well that’s… brilliant indeed,” Harry was baffled by her plan. “And I assume it won’t be a problem that your aunt is much… bigger than these Imagics?”
Some of the recent changes at school Harry actually considered being improvements. Having his own room at the Guest House was awesome of course, much better than the sleeping arrangements of Gryffindor Tower. And each time he dove into that pool to swim laps, he realized just how much he loved swimming. Professor Laddley was a good instructor too, very kind with the beginners, while rather tough on the advanced swimmers. After the second lesson he asked Harry and Blaise Zabini to stay behind for a moment and surprised them by handing out training sheets.
Harry gulped. He had neither mentioned Dumbledore’s message nor the other suspects – still Draco had named two of them.
Early on Thursday morning Harry lay in bed after another restless night. He felt worn out and distressed. Was this nightmare ever going to end? He sighed deeply. Tea, he desperately needed some tea.
What was to be done now? Even if the disguise of the cloak worked perfectly, he was aware that by opening the door he would give himself away immediately. Was Taurus Malfoy lurking in some corner, ready to curse as soon as Harry entered the room? The cloak would not protect him from any spell.
Harry realized that by focusing on the latest findings about the painting he had totally forgotten about Laddley’s condition.
“That’s very considerate of you,” Harry smiled. Why had he been so reluctant to talk to that man a few months ago? O’Malley was clearly a kind and trustworthy person.
“Well then,” Flitwick said in a lower voice again, “Ms Weasley and Ms Malfoy, as you happen to have spotted the… the problem, I need you to come with me – the Headmistress will want to question you. And Mr Potter – maybe you could join us at Gryffindor Tower as soon as you have sorted out the students?” He turned towards Hermione and Ron, who had also stepped closer, “The help of Ms Granger and Mr Weasley would also be much appreciated.”
“Is it? Pity.” Josh gave him another stern look. “I’m afraid you’ll miss dinner tonight. Maybe next time you think twice before you try to expose another student. Come on, off we go!”
“That’s my name, quite right, Mr Potter,” O’Malley smiled at Harry, “I hope you thinking of our sessions is not a bad sign?”
“It is so good of you to visit, Cissy. Oh, what a shame it is, our honourable house in the hands of that dreadful Potter half-blood…,” Walburga moaned. “But tell me dearest Cissy, how come you are here? Did you break into the house?”
Harry pushed his disappointment aside and put the kettle on. Where was Draco? Harry had found their brief conversation last evening quite promising – surely it must be a good sign, if Draco talked about ‘
Harry murmured, “Yeah, thanks Professor Jordan. I… I’d better get back to my group.” He couldn’t help noticing that Draco did not look at him, but stared at Tommy. In fact, Draco seemed rather annoyed. Disturbingly handsome of course, but still annoyed
After sealing the door to the staircase most carefully he hurried downstairs to the ground floor. When he entered the gym again he was mesmerized by the beautiful sight of three Patronuses whirling in a circle – a hare, a boar and a swan.
Harry’s mind raced. The villain had been at the pub all along – so maybe this was Aberforth and not Taurus Malfoy? Could Albus Dumbledore’s brother have gone mad?
Harry glared at the man. “What do you want from me? Draco’s address, is it? Well, I don’t know where he hides and even if I did – I would never ever tell you!”
But when he entered the main corridor of the second floor, the door of the common room flew open and Luna shouted, “Quick, Harry, have a look at the painting – this squirrel behaves ever so oddly!”
With a pang Harry saw her point. In his eagerness to get going he had not considered that an early morning visit to a pub-owner was unlikely to be appreciated. “Right, I’ll better have breakfast first… that’ll give me a chance to ask Flitwick as well.”
“Alright, once a month you shall go to London and report to me afterwards, ok?” Harry smiled encouragingly at the elf. “And another thing... Kreacher, why did you call the book nasty? Did you try to open it?”
“No idea,” Ron shrugged, “hasn’t turned up all evening, same as Cass… I actually thought you might be with them but Hermione says that’s most unlikely – for whatever reason.”
trouble than you imagine! Someone has set you up! And it’s not the first time they did it! You’ve been a suspect in this matter for some time now and if Kingsley interrupts the ball, they’ll have found some serious evidence against you!”
Without further hesitation Harry flew inside. He found an empty spot to step quietly down from the broom, fully aware that somewhere close his opponent must be waiting for him. Hopefully his appearance had not yet been discovered. To keep it that way he needed to proceed in total silence, any magic he wanted to use would have to be cast without spelling out loud. He needed to focus his mind on the spells instead. It was possible to do magic like that, but only with a huge amount of concentration.
Draco let out a sob. His cock went from erect and dripping to flaccid immediately as the loincloth device was pulled up his hips. It didn't matter how flaccid he was, Harry knew he still felt like he was on the brink of coming, but nothing could get through the cloth. Amy was having a similar reaction.
"I don't know, " you answer, you're cringing now because the rice is really digging into your knees. "I will try harder in the future, Master Harry. For you too Master Draco, I promise I will never stop trying. I'm very sorry."
Draco stood up, and said "Yes sirs." Draco really didn't mind, he was a very good cook and he'd begun taking pride in what he made and served to Harry.
"I was only dripping because I was looking so hard at your cock. I was imagining your cock diving into my pussy. Imagining opening my mouth and seeing how much of this I can get down my throat."
"Yes sir," Draco said, and Harry got that same swell. Draco bent over, his elbows resting on the arm of the couch, and his ass sticking out just waiting for its punishment.
Draco's attitude had definitely taken an improvement over the next few months, and Harry found his groove in being a dominant. Harry learned that there were other ways of discipline that didn't require spanking, and he could be creative.
"Take a few deep breaths," Harry said, and he waited patiently while Draco did just that. When his breathing evened out and the tears stopped flowing, Harry asked in a gentle voice, "Can you tell me why you got punished?"
The alarm goes off early and you rise, remembering all over again the humiliation of your diaper. You tiptoe quietly out of the bedroom. It takes everything in your power to walk past the bathroom. You want to use the toilet, but you know you musn't. You look down and see the writing on your legs reminding you what a worthless cunt you are and you strengthen your resolve to be the best little submissive sex slave Harry and Draco could expect.
At home that night, Harry was rubbing salve on Draco's backside. "Can I take your chastity device off?" he asked. Draco was lying face down on the bed.
The kitchen timer went off, and each of the punished subs got one last very hard whack with the paddle.
While they ate, Blaise went into further detail about his time at the dominatrix so that when they were done, Harry was already feeling really horny.
They were greeted by Madame Kat, who took both Draco and Amy's coats. Both of them were naked but for their chastity devices under the coats. Madame Kat went over the rules for the punishment cages, which was that any Dom could do anything they wanted to the subs, as long as it was safe (no major injuries besides welts and bruises) and respected the sub's safewords. The safewords were written very clearly on each cage. Harry and Ted were to stay by the cages all evening, and had power over all the other doms to put a stop to anything they weren't comfortable with.
"It's been a lot of work," Harry admitted. "But Draco was eager to try and he's very eager to please now."
"Why are you crying you little bitch?" called out one Dom, who wasn't in the cage with him, but was enjoying the show. That only made Draco cry harder. Why, oh why, had he and Amy thought they could get away with that quickie the night before. The dom who'd said that pointed and laughed at Draco. "I heard what you did, you little slut. You deserve every bit of what you're getting tonight."
It was glorious to see the redness in Draco's ass become even deeper. He was going to have a bruise tomorrow for sure. Both Draco and Amy were sobbing, and when they could catch their voices, saying "We're sorry!"
"You aren't going to be able to come," Blaise said, laughing at Draco. "It doesn't matter how much you touch it."
"Wait," Harry said. He pointed his wand at Draco and used a sobering spell on him. "Draco can't agree to this when he's drunk." You could see the sobering effect in Draco's face. His eyes became focused and his posture straighter.
"No thank you," Draco said, trying to sound dignified. There was no dignity in his red ass, the Gryffindor colored chastity belt and his obvious need to constantly have his hands on his dick.
All of this was so erotic, that Harry said, "I'm going to come." Immediately, the cocksluts pulled off, though one kept his hands on Harry's cock and continued to jerk. As Harry came, the cocksluts had their heads together, their mouths opened to catch the semen spurting out of his dick. They lapped it up greedily, and when some of the spunk landing on one of their cheeks, another cockslut leaned over and licked it off. They were still talking, telling Harry how delicious his come was and thanking him for letting them see it and make him come.
Harry and Draco were both men with very high libidos. They could fuck two or three times a day happily, and if they only fucked once (or even not at all!) they felt unfulfilled. Bringing other people into their bed was helpful. Blaise, of course, took a tumble with them when he was in town. Before she got married, Luna Lovegood used to come around to get double penetrated by Harry and Draco.
"First things first," Harry says once Hermione is gone. "Draco and i are hard as rocks from watching this Girl act like a whore for Hermione. We need our dicks sucked now."
From their last two times having threesomes with Blaise, Harry had learned that Blaise had the biggest cock of anyone he knew. And Merlin's Balls, did he know how to use it. Blaise oozed a sexiness and confidence that Harry had never had, up until he became a dominant.
As you are leaving the Masters' house, you are feeling perfectly miserable. "Girl," Harry says, gently lifting your chin so you are looking into his kind blue eyes. "You made a mistake, but you came to us and admitted your wrong doing. We are angry with you, but once the punishment is over next weekend, that will be it. We won't continue to punsish you beyond that.
Several doms in a row lined up for blowjobs. The first Dom, the one with the three cocksluts, had heard how good Draco was with his mouth, and they all wanted a piece of it. For a full hour, Draco had his mouth stuffed with cock after cock. They all blended together, and though he was surviving, he was still in the back of his mind extremely proud of his ability to deepthroat.
Blaise set the tip of his cock at Harry's entrance that was practically dripping with lube. "Relax," Blaise said, as he pushed a little further. It took a few pushes for him to breach the entrance fully.
You are now laying your head in the crook of your elbow and begin to cry. Gods, but does this spanking hurt and it isn't letting up. You are sure your backside will be marked.
At bedtime, the Masters have you sit on a chair on the bedside with your wrists bound behind your back and watch as they make love. They kiss passionately, undressing each other slowly. There is so much love in their eyes and you feel outside of it all. You watch Harry kiss his way down Draco's smooth chest and cup his dick and balls lovingly in his hand. You watch as Draco peppers Harry with kisses all over his body, stopping to suck lightly on his nipples. And it's difficult to not groan as you watch Draco get on all fours while Harry enters him from behind. They are facing you, but not looking at you. You can see in their faces that there is no one else in the world besides the other as Harry whispers, "I love you," as he thrusts into his husbands ass.
He would constantly look over at Amy, who seemed to be getting at least as punished as he was. Her chastity device had been taken off at some point, and he could even see from his vantage point how swollen and red her pussy was. She'd probably had at least six or seven cocks in there tonight, pounding away. He wondered if she was able to come.
"Anyway," Hermione continues, "We had an attitude issue with Ronald this week and you know me, I just don't have the strength for a strong physical punishment, so I'm hoping my two favorite male Doms can punish him into shape."
When they were done with the spanking, the Dom undid Draco's handcuffs and had him kneel in front of him. "You're going to suck my cock."
"Very nervous about tonight," Draco admitted.  "Amy and I've talked about it, and she said that the punishment cages get pretty scary and intense."
Harry sighed, "Countless spankings and look at this," Harry showed Blaise the parchment hanging on the wall where Draco had written his lines.
At one point, you shift a little and Draco notices. He leans over and smacks you on your bruised backside one time. You yelp in surprise. "Footstools don't squirm," he says angrily.
"Silence, you fucking cow. I don't want to hear any of your fucking apologies right now. You acted like a dirty little slut who doesn't care about us, and that's how we're going to treat you," Harry says.
She falls to the side and lays there, legs splayed open for a few moments while she catches her breath.
After a while in the corner, Master Harry takes you outside to pee before its time for you to go to bed. They allow you to wash your face and drink some water and then show you to a pile of blankets on the floor in the corner of their bedroom. Draco is there waiting for you, holding something white in his hand.
Draco shrugged, "That'd be up to you, as the Head of Household. You'd decide what I needed, whether it's corner time or grounding or even spanking."
After Hermione is done paying attention to your breasts, she has you spread your legs as she lifts up the skirt of your dress to your midsection. She gets on her knees and looks up into your crotch, spreading your vulva and inhaling your musk.
Draco turned to go into the kitchen, and Harry felt a swelling in his groin to see how bright red Draco's ass was.
They usher you into the house, happy to see you. You can see nervousness in their faces, and you are aware it's on your face as well. After all, you had years with your prior dom, and he knew just how rough you liked him to be (VERY rough), and you didn't really know what to expect from Harry and Draco. Of course, your meetings had covered it all, from your safeword ("Lemondrop") to your absolute no-no's (visible bruising anywhere but the buttocks, nothing that will make you bleed, and a few things that you prefer to wait until later to do when you know each other better, such as anal sex and piss play), to what it is you like (being ordered to do chores, forced nakedness, displaying, humiliating language....among many MANY other things).
He hands over the food and you shut the door, taking the food into the kitchen where the Masters were watching the whole thing from just around the corner.
Harry continued, "It was extremely naughty of you to not come to me, and to ignore the chore. You must have known I'd find out, right?"
You lean back onto your heels and say, "Thank you Master." His come is dripping in front of your eyes.
Harry gave Draco an odd look, but didn't wait. Instead he opened the door and saw the exact same jumble of clothes, the same mess that had made Harry order Draco to clean out his closet just weeks ago.
Friday evening finds you outside their door, taking deep breaths to calm your nerves. You realize that you are also feeling some anticipation. It's been a while for you that you've had time where you were truly subjugated like the dirty little sub you are, and this is the time that your new Masters could give you that. Whatever they have planned, you know that you'll get through this weekend.
"Let's see," Master Draco drawls, "That's twice you've forgotten to say my name properly and once you didn't fold clothes properly. Do you think this is why we got a sub? So we could be disrespected and have our house a mess?"
For example, one of Draco's chores had been to clean the floors in Harry's study. The floor was stone with a rug in the center and the rug needed to be magically vacuumed and the stone dusted. When Harry inspected the work, he found the dust mostly shoved into the edges of the floor around the wall.It wasn't a surprise, though Draco was turning into a gifted cook, his housework was often done shoddily and required a harsh reminder or a swat to the bottom to be remedied. This time, Harry called Draco into the study and pointed out the corners.
"It's good you're sorry, but we are really trying to drive," SPANK "This point," SPANK, "Home!" SPANK SPANK SPANK! Those spanks were all from Master Draco, who has a much firmer hand.
It's a wooden contraptions designed for you to be attached to it. Your arms tied to the top and hang down just at your eye line, and your ankles are spread and attached to the bottom. Two wooden seats are there to go behind your knees so you are in a seated position, though nothing was holding your ass up and your legs are spread wide. You are completely open and exposed.
You flush, pleased, and they allow you to make a plate for yourself. After dinner you clean up, which the Masters return to the Parlor. When you get in, they are playing a card game. You stand, by them, hands clasped behind your back waiting for instruction.
Their best friends, Ron and Hermione, have a normal marriage on the weekday, but on the weekends, Hermione is a Dom to Ron. She let Harry and Draco borrow her little sub a couple of weekends while she had work trips and they found they liked Domming on the weekends very much indeed.
Each cage had a few implements in front of it for punishment. There was a paddle, a hairbrush, a whip, a cat o' nine tails, a cane, and a switch. Harry took the whip away. He didn't like the idea of Draco being whipped.
"It's OK, Babe," Harry said soothingly. "You aren't going to get punished for this." He went to Draco and hugged him, stroking his hair. "You tried your best, and this was a new chore for you."
Both Amy and Draco stood in front of their doms, arms behind their backs waiting for their punishment.
"I see you eyeing the cages," Ted said. "And those poor subs aren't taking any punishment at the moment. Do you want to go over?"
Draco quickly vested himself of the rest of his clothes, and Harry did the same. They faced each other, taking in the others' body, all lean muscle and large erections. The fell to the couch together, kissing and fondling the other. Their breath becoming harder, and turning into moans. "I want you to fuck me," Draco said.
You nod again, grateful you'll get to use a toilet in the morning. But your gratefulness is short-lived when you see Draco hold up the white thing in his hands. It's a diaper.
Harry chuckled, "That's for sure," he agreed. "Still you need your punishment for this one, OK? This is a bad rule breaking."
"Yes I do," Draco said, his tongue working his way over the Dom's hands, between the finger and everything. "I'm a dirty little slut."
"Listen, babe." Harry said gently, "Everyone will need help doing things. I'm in charge here, and you don't need to feel ashamed to come to me with questions. I want you to come to me and hopefully I can help you."
Draco went to his hands and knees. He may have been expecting another spanking, but instead Harry lubed up his cock and Draco's asshole and carefully spread Draco's tender ass cheeks and fucked him.
You help by fetching ingredients while Ronald does the work of putting the bread together. You talk about your times as subs. "I knew I was coming here this weekend," Ronald said. "I always act like a brat for Hermione when I know I'm coming here."
Harry must have realized he didn't hit hard enough to make an impression, because the second spank came just a bit harder. "Two!" Draco said.
"Please remember," Harry said, handing Draco back his trousers, "When I give you your chores, they need to be done properly the first time."
Harry and Blaise kissed again, this time facing each other, letting their hands roam across the other's body and stroking their cocks. Eventually, Harry wound up on his back, legs spread with Blaise in between them. Blaise waved his wand and a condom magically appeared in his hands. He put a lubing spell on Harry's asshole and once he got the condom on, another lubing spell on his own cock.
"Draco," Harry said sternly. "You're going to suck Blaise off now, and if you move your hips, you'll get punished."
"Yes Master Harry." You scurry off to the kitchen. It takes you a moment to locate the tea service, but you boil the water on the stove and fill up two teacups, setting them on a servette with milk and sugar. You find a pack of biscuits and add them as well.
Draco gave him a searching look, but Harry distracted him with a kiss. The last thing he wanted was an argument of any kind, so even if the pit in his stomach was gnawing at him, he forced himself to push the whole matter aside.
no, he’d just tried to avoid a potentially unpleasant situation in the least confrontational way he knew how to.
Ginny, however, seemed to have caught on, because she pulled away. “If you don’t want to have sex with me you can just say it,” she said, hard lines all over her face. “Instead of doing this avoidance ritual every time.”
“Merlin’s balls, Potter,” Malfoy said, adding another string of expletives. To his credit, the umbrella didn’t flicker. “Just dig right into it, will you?”
had come to the game today, all of Harry’s friends, and Ginny’s friends and her family—including her parents, whom Harry still hadn’t gone to see since his break up with Ginny—Harry’s own family, in the form of Teddy (who did not have a game of his own to play today, and who was there with both Andromeda and Draco’s mum), and friends of friends and family. Millicent was sitting with Pansy and Padma and some girl Harry didn’t recognise, and on the other side of Draco were Blaise and Gilliam and some girl who looked like she could’ve been Gilliam’s identical twin. Dean and Seamus were there with what looked like Dean’s siblings, Rhosyn was there with the rest of the Harpies. Everyone.
“Why outside?” Harry asked, once they’d got their soup and had made their way to the garden and one of the benches sitting under a naked cherry tree. Malfoy had drawn up a small weather bubble for both of them.
He hated that he’d had to sleep in a cupboard, that he’d had to face a basilisk alone, that he’d had to walk to his own death to save everyone else, and he hated that he hadn’t
It probably was. “Not yet.” Harry hadn’t finished his tart yet, and there was still plenty of tea in the pot. What was more important was that he didn’t want to go. Malfoy had a lovely voice, despite the posh accent, not too deep, or gravelly. Smooth. Warm.
“Merlin’s tears, Harry, I wasn’t ready! I wasn’t ready to have bloody children or, or, get married, or any of that shit!” Ginny snapped back. “I just wanted to
“I’d rather not,” Harry admitted. He closed his eyes for a moment, breathing slowly and deeply, and then turned his attention back to the pitch.
“Yeah, okay,” Harry said, though he didn’t quite understand. She was the one who’d come back after a week and told him she’d met someone. And he’d met her, he’d shaken hands with Rhosyn. It’d been fine. “Later, then.”
Harry looked around the unfinished living room, and the bookcase he’d just assembled. It was completely empty. They didn’t have any books. Maybe he could put his Quidditch books in it? He had a battered copy about the Chudley Cannons Ron had given him somewhere. Which box were they in again?
“But now you said it,” Harry said, reeling him in for a kiss. Draco squeaked, but kissed Harry back. “Is that what you told your mum?”
Armed with just the one book (the receipt now nestled in Harry’s pocket, in case Draco wanted to exchange the book for another), Harry walked down the street, keeping an eye out for a good spot to Apparate from. He hoped Draco would be home. Harry had (finally) learned that Draco lived with his mum in Wiltshire, though not in the Manor—another house on the grounds, he’d said, a dower house. Hopefully it wouldn’t be too hard to find.
Dean was the first to speak. “Of course,” he said. And then, because he was Dean and sometimes had an uncanny ability to know what Harry was thinking, added: “we can tell the straight people pub night is cancelled that day if you give us a heads up.”
“I don’t know. I’m still figuring it out.” Harry exhaled. “I have…weird hang-ups about sex. I don’t want—I don’t know. Is that okay? Is that a problem? Because I don’t want it to be—”
“Just how many of these do you go through on a monthly basis?” Malfoy asked, adding the cloud he was holding to the pile already in the basket.
Draco smiled. It was amazing, really, how Draco’s smile, when directed at him like this, all warm and soft and happy and loving, could make Harry’s insides feel.
“I’m fine.” She glanced back at Rhosyn, who was patiently waiting and still pretending she wasn’t following their conversation. “Was there anything else?”
“No—well, sort of. I’ve told him I’m asexual, and he…seemed like it wasn’t a big deal.” Harry frowned. Draco had been kind of weird about, well, sex. Everything he’d said and done had been the complete opposite of what Harry had expected.
“Maybe,” Malfoy said. He picked a book out of the shelf and handed it to Harry. “I was going to lend you this one next. When you’ve finished reading the ones you have now, I mean.”
“No. But we’re not going out until Wednesday, which is,” Harry counted on his fingers, “whole five days away, but I’m seeing him again on Monday for non-date reasons, and I just don’t know how I’m supposed to, you know, wait.”
“I didn’t make that decision,” Malfoy said, grinning. “I’m not a fan of it either, to be level with you. In the second half of the book he has several orgies, one of them including Beings. I won’t spoil you for which ones. That’s a surprise best served…as a surprise.”
And there was nothing in this moment Harry wanted to undo more than that. Go back in time and stop himself. Go further back in time and stop himself from suggesting they have sex in the first place. It hadn’t been worth it. It hadn’t been worth it at all.
When he finally emerged from the strongroom with Malfoy’s documents, he felt calmer. He’d spelled the mud off his cloak while the platform transported him back upstairs and paused to drop it off behind the desk. His hair was a lost cause, as usual.
care. But…Malfoy had been selling off a lot of Malfoy property. Was one technically still landed gentry if one no longer owned land and didn’t have any tenants? Why had he done it?
You really have to piss, but you are holding it in, hoping the Masters will wake up and take you outside. Anything to avoid going in the diaper. You hold on as long as you can, but once the dough is risen and is put into the oven, you know you can't anymore. You can't bring yourself to piss in the kitchen, where food is cooked, so you head into the living room, spread your legs a bit and release your urine. The diaper becomes full and soggy and you absolutely hate how it feels between your legs. You start to tear up, wondering how long you'll be forced to be in a diaper filled with piss this morning. You can't even let it all go, you are so afraid of it leaking, so you hold some in.
"Oh yeah?" Harry asked. Harry sometimes felt bad for Draco that most of their shared friends had been his friends at Hogwarts. The ones they hung around with regularly, like Ron and Hermione and Ginny and Luna. Blaise was the only Slytherin Draco kept in touch with, and he lived abroad and they didn't see each other often.
Even as he went limp, Carly seemed to be enjoying herself, because she kept bouncing up and down on Harry's cock, and she was starting to take quick loud breaths. Her dom leaned over and practically pulled her off Harry, slapping her hard across the ass. "You. Do. Not. Come!"
"Yes,Master Draco," you whisper, hoping  that a finger will slip inside you, just absolutely needing something in your pussy.
"That's it," Harry threw down his napkin and took Draco by the hand and led him to the living room."
The riding crops are tossed to the side and your bondages are tightened, making you sit straighter and making you more uncomfortable. Everything is just bound so tight that there is not even an inch of wiggle room anywhere. The chair is hard and it's starting to hurt.
"Perhaps we tell them together?" you ask. "When your Mistress gets here, let's tell them both at the same time."
You are permitted to eat breakfast with the Masters, which makes you happy. They aren't ignoring you like they did last night. You are included in their conversation and it's a moment where you are three equals, not a Sub with two Masters. It only lasts until eating is over when you are ordered to clean the kitchen.
"O-OK," Draco said. He took a deep breath and closed his eyes, relaxing his whole body. Harry and Blaise would never have been the wiser that Draco was currently urinating, there was no outside indication. Draco opened his eyes, "It worked!"
The three of them talked and joked and laughed while you and Ronald stood there facing each other. You are becoming more and more uncomfortable by the minute. You can still hold on, but you aren't sure how much you're going to last. You look at Ronald and see he looks as cool as a cucumber. You bite your lip. Ronald gets your attention by wiggling his fingers at you. You look at him. He glances at his Mistress and your Masters and when they all laugh at something together he mouths to you, "Let go at the same time."
"You're very welcome," Harry smiled at his submissive husband benevolently. They turned their attention to the closet, where they devised a plan for Draco to clean it out over the next two days.
“It was hard,” Draco admitted. “And it wasn’t ideal, in many ways. My therapist wasn’t happy. I ended up copying your routine, you know?” Harry nodded. “I was supposed to create my own.”
He was impeccably dressed, though he had dark circles under his eyes and a sickly tint to his complexion. He’d changed his hairstyle since Harry had last seen him, what had possibly been three or four years prior, but his white-blond hair didn’t look the way it usually did, if Harry’s memory was anything to go by; it wasn’t as shiny as he remembered it to be.
He spent the rest of the weekend packing up whatever things of Ginny’s he could find, and reading; he peeked at the poetry volume (the bookplate for that one was as lovely as the rest; Malfoy had drawn little sunflowers and mice along the bottom) and read the Muggle romance in the span of an afternoon. It was quick, easy reading, and quite possibly weirder than even the bizarre four-hundred-year-old classic—Harry suspected the writer had never met a Muggle, or set a foot in the Muggle world at all.
Relief passed over Malfoy’s face. “My first term we had a class about terminology,” he said. “As in, just words, and what they meant. We covered technology and pop culture and things like that, which was really interesting. One lecture was all about the difference between very similar sounding words and phrases. For example—wait, do you know what a mobile phone is?”
It was just as well that Harry didn’t see Draco on Tuesdays, being at the daycare all day and then at the College in the evening; his one single therapy session with Gladys Oakland had done a number on his head. It’d also left him exhausted, and it was all he could do to keep up with the kids—Betty and Hugh had got into a fight over the bats and by the time Harry had successfully managed to separate them, Hugh had angry red scratches on his face and Betty had a split lip.
Evidently the cashier hadn’t seen such a large purchase before either, judging by the way her eyes widened as Harry put the basket on the counter. “Are you running a spa?” she asked. “We do have B2B programs for that sort of thing.”
When Mr Goyle is done with the woman the other men take her again. She’s unconscious now, but not for long. Rodolph lifts her on her knees and fucks into her ass as he closes his hand around the throat. The woman opens her eyes wide and tries to scream. She slams around with her hands as she struggles to breathe.  Mr Crabbe kneels in front of her and pushes his cock into her pussy. And uncle Lucius steps closer so that Rodolphus can guide the woman’s mouth over his cock. One by one they come inside her, filling all her holes with their sperm. Then Rodolph releases his grip on her throat. The woman falls to the ground.
The adults leave the woman on the floor and go into another room. One of the house-elves will put her in the dungeons again shortly.
Harry and Hermione stared at him for a moment, before they both started to grin. It was Friday at lunch-break and – thanks to one of Hermione’s famous warming charms – they were sitting outside in the grounds although it was freezing cold. They wanted to discuss the Imagic issue in private.
Draco’s eyes were full of surprise and his face became all soft for a moment. His lips trembled – until he bit them hard, closed his eyes and drew a deep breath.
“Neither am I.” said Harry, “Hermione, believe me, I’m really grateful for you hard work! When I did not listen properly it’s only because I fully trust you! I’m a hundred percent sure you are not going to miss anything in those old volumes. And if you need someone to discuss your findings with, it has to be someone equally competent, not us Charms morons.” He pointed at Ron and himself.
“Well, if you don’t mind,” she said with an embarassed little smile, “at least I can find out all about… about you know what… and I’ll tell you everything when I’m back, promise!”
Mainly he dreaded to hear his friends’ opinion on Draco being a suspect, fearing they might find the cause plausible enough. As they could hardly bring the matter up in a place where other students might drop by anytime, he hoped to postpone that inevitable discussion for some hours at least. But that did not keep his own mind off topic and Hermione had to call for his attention more than once. She looked quite worried, Harry thought. Ron, on the other hand, seemed to be slightly embarrassed for whatever reason.
“As I said, I am very grateful for your visit, Mr Potter, Miss Weasley,” Narcissa Malfoy said, when they were seated, “I am quite sure you would have plenty of more joyful things to do on such a lovely afternoon.“
“Yeah? You think so?” the Headauror looked unconvinced. “I’m not so sure… Minerva was not totally happy with him either. Says he’s a bit of a distraction with half of the students fawning over him. He’s too young, I guess, makes it difficult to keep up proper boundaries with his students.”
Ginny sighed. “It’s pathetic – superhero Harry Potter is unable to find himself a date for the Halloween Ball!”
“Well hello everybody! Mr Dumbledore, let me help you… here you go!” said Madame Pomfrey as she guided her new patient to the bed next to Harry’s.
They had retreated to Harry’s bedroom. Hermione and Ron were sitting on the sofa and Harry stretched out on the carpet. His friends had pestered Harry during dinner about his visit to the Headmistress’ office, but Harry had kept quiet. Instead he asked Ron and Hermione to see him at his room after dinner. His reluctance to talk in front of others had intrigued his friends, but Ron and Hermione had certainly not expected, what Harry had told them now.
“My own thoughts exactly, Harry,” McGonagall answered. “Trust me, I don’t want to believe that one of my students is involved. And especially not a student, I personally vouched for to get him back to Hogwarts.” She looked at Harry with much concern in her eyes and Harry remembered McGonagall’s testimony at Draco’s trial. She had indeed spoken very much in Draco’s favour and put the full force of her own respectability in account. Harry had been quite surprised at that time.
When he spotted Ron and Hermione, Harry exhaled with relief. They were craning their necks as well, obviously searching for him in return and Ron started to gesture as soon as he laid eyes on Harry who hurried towards them.
More and more smoke filled the room and it became difficult to breathe. Harry realized with alarm that the curtains were on fire and a few floor-boards were smouldering already.
Harry cringed. “Well… of course I still hope Draco is innocent… but I’m sure the Auror department does not jump to conclusions without proof.”
Harry mused. He could not see much but he knew the area well enough to find his way. The air was freezing cold and he soon felt numb in spite of his warm clothes. Maybe Aberforth would fetch him a hot drink? Some mulled cider would actually be nice. Suddenly a hint of pleasant anticipation of Christmas seemed to linger in the cold winter air. Remembering Hermione’s words, that it was only a matter of time until Taurus Malfoy was caught, Harry felt cautiously optimistic. Draco would be back before Christmas, right?
“Never mind Tadgh, he’s helping me to dig up the last turnips,” Aberforth said, “before the freeze gets to them… so what is it you wanted to know?”
“Finally she’s talking sense!” Ron exclaimed loading his plate with food. “I’m just glad the changes don’t include putting all of us on a vegan diet or something!”
Harry insisted on the importance of Ariana’s missing cup while Hermione kept talking about C.O.M.A. – and as fascinating as both topics might be, they had not made any progress with both of them.
First the unexpected discovery of two most reliable witnesses. To Harry’s delight House-elves were not only allowed to testify in front of the Wizengamot, but their testimony was in fact very much respected as they were totally unable to lie. Millie and Floppy both stated in perfect unison that the trap painting had appeared on the very same day as the first-year students – which had been Tuesday, the first of September.
Finally it was half past four and Harry had nothing else to do than wait for his date. He stared at the hands of his watch, suspecting they were frozen in time, when a soft knock made him jump. He opened the door and –
They all watched the Gryffindors leave before Harry cleared his voice and said, “Let’s get back to business, shall we? I want Luna, Dean and the Ravenclaws to go next. Ron and Hermione, would you please accompany them to the front door and remove my locking spell? I assume Flitwick has applied it again after leaving. It’s the same one we used on our tent last year, remember? Thanks!” – and the second group of students started to exit the gym.
, Harry thought. He remembered Arthur Weasley saying, Slytherin house would be depleted of older students this year. School attendance was only compulsory until O.W.L., everyone was free to quit afterwards and quite a number of Slytherin students had done just that. Some of them simply had to earn their own living because their parents were imprisoned. Other families had fled the country altogether. And no less than four Slytherin students had died during the war, Vincent Crabbe among them.
“Thanks,” Harry murmured. The tea smelled nice enough but early morning tea without Draco, or at least his daily morning letter from Draco, was not the same. “Sleep is much overrated, I guess?” He grinned at his friends.
“Brillant idea, flying! But stay hidden for a minute,” he whispered. “They watch my door – maybe they watch the windows as well!”
Still Draco avoided his eyes like he usually did except in the early mornings. During their morning tea routine Draco seemed relaxed, he teased Harry quite a bit but in a distinctly friendly way. But in front of others Draco’s behaviour towards Harry was rather cool. Which irritated Harry more than he wanted to admit.
Meanwhile they had strolled along most of the paths the grounds offered and Harry had lost any sense of direction, when to his surprise the old play house was within sight again. Finally Ms Malfoy seemed to take aim at the little building.
“Wow, that’s fascinating,” Hermione said, “I’ve never read anything about it in ‘Hogwarts. A History.’ It really must be top secret.”
“I’ve suggested ‘Famous Quidditch Players’,” said Seamus, “I’ll come as Victor Krum and all the girls will fawn over me.”
“May the Dark Lord bless you, my dear,” Walburga said. “Come to think of it, now that He-who-must-not-be-named is gone, I am afraid no one can save me from my fate…” By the sound of it the portrait was now sobbing heavily.
“Don’t worry, Harry. Pinkie won’t burn anything, as long as he stays in paintings, his temperature keeps low. Professor Flitwick explained it all to me. My Pinkie is just not allowed to leave the canvas area and he knows it.” She nodded. “He’s a good birdie, Harry.”
“That’s exactly what Zabini suggested,” Draco said with disdain. “But I don’t want to drag you down with me, Harry! Even tonight could have hurt your reputation – what if they catch me under your famous cloak?” He shook his head. “I was right in the first place. I’ll do you no good. The best thing I can do is leave the witcharding world completely.”
Harry’s heart clenched. If Sylvia Silvers’s Imagic described Draco in a recognisable way, he would be even more incriminated than before!
The board of Hogwarts' school governors had decided that this year the first day of school ought to be postponed until the first of October for most of the students. The delay gave the members of staff more time for repairs, replacing enchantments and even some improvements to the old building. Only the actual first-year students were supposed to begin by September. One month less for the older students should not cause problems for the upcoming year, as all of them had to repeat last year’s lessons anyway. Students and teachers alike accepted this decision without complaint. During the previous year some rather unfit professors had been teaching at Hogwarts and the school year had not ended with O.W.L. and N.E.W.T. exams but with a horrible battle instead.
“It’s done!” Narcissa Malfoy shouted with some triumph in her voice as she shoved the hexed painting into her bag. “Now that she’s gone you won’t have any trouble taking down that empty frame, Mr Potter, and replace it with whatever you like… maybe a mirror would be nice? This hall has always been far too dark and gloomy.”
Hermione beamed at Harry and hugged him, “Finally you’re here! What took you so long?” She glanced at Draco and said, “We’ve missed you!”
“Boyfriend is the word you are looking for,” Harry grinned. Ron never failed to amuse him and he appreciated the relief of tension his best pal’s statement provided.
Ron cleared his voice. “I’m just… I’m ever so proud to be with Hermione, you know? When I look at her, I could just burst with pride that she’s mine…” Ron paused, “it’s still hard to believe you should feel that way about Malfoy – sorry, Draco…?”
“So I agreed to ask my parents. They gave their consent, in fact they were rather proud that I had made such an influential friend. And Timothy – my brother – he was delighted about the invitation! Tim was never envious of my magic. Probably because he was a very gifted kid himself, an excellent artist. At seventeen he was already a student at the Royal Academy of Arts – that’s how good he was. I’m only eleven months older than Tim and although we are very different, we have always been close. So I was happy to bring him along. Tim was interested in everything beautiful. When I told him about the Manor and its famous arts collection, he was simply thrilled. One Saturday afternoon in July Tim and I went to Malfoy Manor –  and I’ll regret that visit for the rest of my life, Mr Potter.”
’. If you are not familiar with the word ‘witchard’ – this is a gender neutral term for both witches and wizards. I have suggested this topic because I regret that gender issues are far too often neglected in our magical society. Let me tell you about my background.” She paused for a moment. Students and staff alike were listening closely. Cass was an excellent speaker and had her audience’s full attention.
Now most heads in the common room had turned towards them and several students pointed and whispered.
Looking out over the frozen grounds Hermione rested her hands on the windowsill. Harry stood next to her following her gaze. Although late in the morning, even close to noon, it was still gloomy outside, the sun well-hidden behind thick clouds and the sky grey like lead. All in all the weather fit Harry’s mood perfectly.
Harry was stunned. Never before had the idea crossed his mind that the real Severus Snape might have felt anything but repugnance for him. He certainly needed time to get used to that idea.
“You’ve got to be kidding me! Do you really think everything will be alright, if you just waltz up to Kingsley and tell him they’ve made a mistake? Whoever has set you up did it clever enough. The Auror Department will not give you much of a chance to prove your innocence.” Harry grabbed Draco’s shoulders and shook him lightly. “They’ll ship you off to Azkaban faster than you can say
The only other pleasant change was having Molly and Arthur at school. To Harry’s delight Molly Weasley turned out to be a natural teacher. Not that he was very surprised, he had expected as much. But after her first lesson everybody agreed, that she was at least as good as Josh Jordon. She had lots of interesting stories to tell from her time in the Order of the Phoenix and she let her students practice just like Josh had done. Plus she was even better than Josh at explaining the theory of Defence, which was really important for N.E.W.T.s.
“Let us pray it is. But don’t get your hopes up too much, Mr Potter. We will find out by the time Otto is well again. Thitherto we have to wait.”
“Cassy asked for you, by the way, Harry,” said Luna, “I believe she wants to talk to you about the motto of the Halloween ball. Have you all made suggestions? I did. My motto would be ‘Unsolved Magical Mysteries’ – I would just love to dress up as a Whiffwhirl-girl.”
Downstairs the music started to play once more and Harry peeked into box after box. Halfway around the corridor, he stopped to watch out from yet another empty box. Downstairs couples were crowding the dance floor, Hermione and Ron amongst them. He tried to get a glimpse of the other boxes’ occupants from his present lookout, searching for a certain silver-blond fringe without luck before he continued his quest along the corridor.
“You two walking into the Forbidden Forest?” Draco suddenly said and frowned, “I don’t like it, especially if you go there all alone…”
Hermione turned slightly pink and said, “Well – all is fair in love and war, right? The war is over now. But if we don’t abide by law in times of peace we are heading towards anarchy.”
Just a short while later they both stepped out of the Guest House. Harry led the way to a group of tall trees in the middle of the lawn, which seemed like an outpost of the Forbidden Forest. That’s where he stopped, pulled his wand and pointed it at the lawn in front of them.
“A role model in the family, huh? That’s good!” Odie smiled. He actually smiled a lot, but it still felt genuine. “I hope you don’t mind me saying so, but you seem tense? Nervous to see your sweet-heart again? Or is it something else?”
As always Draco was unable to ignore Cassy’s wish. “Alright, if you insist… but I’m not sitting next to that idiot one more second.” Having said that Draco squeezed in between Ginny and Cass.
“For all I care,” Harry gave in. “But... there’s a lot of other stuff I need to do – catch up on missed lessons, get back in shape. So – let’s do it right now and get it over with quickly, okay? Just give me a minute and then I’ll see you – where exactly?”
Cass on the other hand was clearly very nervous to meet the ‘in-laws’ and biting her fingernails. Hermione had tried to ease Cass’ tension by sharing her own experience with the Weasleys but eventually fell quiet as Cass hardly listened to her. All the other Gryffindor students kept their distance, as if Harry’s group was giving off negative vibes.
Harry thought and shook his head as if to get rid of an annoying fly. Draco, he was in love with Draco. Draco, who was in trouble and needed his help.
“Quick!” Harry whispered and stepped back from the open window. The familiar texture of his Invisibility Cloak whooshed by and Harry closed the window swiftly.
Without raising his eyes from the book, Draco said, his tone full of forced patience, “You might never have been told this before, Potter, but you should be careful not to upset people by excessive staring. As this behaviour is considered to be very rude indeed. A sign of bad manners, one might say.” He sighed as if Harry was causing him immense suffering.
“Thank you, Mr Hillborogh and Mr Potter for informing me of this appaling incident. I will take matters into my hands now.” She looked as composed as ever. “Be assured I do not doubt your report for a second. But I hope you understand, that I have to hear Professor Laddley’s point of view too, before appropriate action can be taken.”
“It’s possible, I’ve seen it happen,” Harry said recalling his last visit to Tonk’s cottage, where he had found the Imagic of young Bellatrix Black had been removed from her sisters’ Sorores Cup, “and Professor Flitwick confirmed that it could be done, if the miniature is really well painted. But I also wanted to check Ariana’s portrait because any painting of her might tempt your brother’s Imagic to visit… is there by any chance another portrait of your sister?”
“And he claims to have no clue about Magical Arts, says Charms were always his least favourite subject,” Ron continued, “the guy is either completely honest or a spiffing actor. Frankly I trust him and I think he also trusts me.”
“I assure you, I have no idea, what you are talking about, Luna,” Draco said with finality, but his blush told otherwise. He closed the lid on the piano and rose, “I bid you all a good night,” he nodded politely to the others, but did not even look at Harry, when he left.
McGonagall gave him an astonished look. “I must say you surprise me, Harry! You were never shy to blame Draco Malfoy for any kind of mischief or wrongdoing before!”
Harry thought, when the shadow stayed close behind him for several laps. Someone from Laddley’s class for sure – or maybe the teacher himself? Just to satisfy his curiosity, Harry skipped the next flip turn and stopped at the railing.
Harry grinned. “Anyway – I’ll save two seats for you at the train. If Malfoy– Draco is willing to sit with us, both of you are welcome. But talking him into it might be hard work.”
Harry grinned to himself while pulling out a battered volume. The odd title ‘C.O.M.A.’ was printed in silver letters on its spine. Harry opened the book – which responded by vomiting violently at him.
“That is exactly how Draco felt. He resented Dumbledore for giving up on Cassiopeia and was never willing to fully trust him.” Narcissa Malfoy’s voice was full of pain. “In the end they both paid the price for it, Dumbledore and Draco alike.” She fell silent.
“Looks good to me,” Harry said. “I’ll have a closer look at the whole thing later, want to swim some laps first…”
. In return Harry read and reread Draco’s letters, wrote his reply –always closing with ‘I love you too’– and sent Otto on his way the following evening.
Kingsley cleared his voice. “Regrettably as Auror Jordan’s misbehaviour might be, it made us question our conduct of this investigation. The Headmistress and I think that it is time to interrogate all of the remaining suspects – as far as we can get hold of them.  Professor Tharros has already agreed on being questioned later this afternoon and we will talk to Professor Laddley tomorrow as soon as he comes back from London. He is visiting his brother in St. Mungo’s again, as is his custom. Now that we have all the Imagics but Dumbledore’s back, we saw no reason to keep Laddley at Hogwarts for another weekend.”
He could live with that. Once again, following Hermione’s advice had proved to be the sensible thing to do, as the awkwardness was gone after their conversation and Ginny seemed to enjoy hanging out at No 12 even more than before.
Just like Harry had suspected, Dumbledore had been lured to visit Ariana’s hexed Filia Cup – and been trapped there. Draco’s mean uncle had gotten hold of the cup during the night of the battle of Hogwarts, picking it up from the ruins of the pub, the very same night he had also found the Resurrection Stone in the forest.
“Honestly, I have no idea, Mr Potter! I never thought Draco would seek out casual homosexual company… and surely not among Muggles! That must have been Lucius’ influence.”
“What I want?” Draco’s voice was throaty, “are you kidding me? What I want is this –“ and he leaned into Harry and kissed him hard. Harry’s heart leapt, yes – this was it. Draco’s mouth tasted, oh so very sweet, a bit like raspberries in fact.
“No, wait a second,” Harry said quickly, “I’ve… maybe you could talk to Draco? He’s still a suspect, maybe you find out something useful… for the investigation?”
Draco snorted and shook his head. “Rubbish! I didn’t leave Edinburgh for all of August! I never thought I would regret that the Ministry’s damned tracking spell doesn’t work properly.” Harry had expected nothing else but was still relieved to hear this confirmed.
Harry sighed. Whom was he trying to fool? Draco most likely had a problem with Harry being gay. Although this made no sense, considering Draco had known about it for weeks. Plus he adored his lesbian cousin.
“You know what? I’m starting to reconsider the offer – maybe it is better you do get back to school right away – all those missed lessons, remember?” said Odie.
“I’ll keep that in mind, Professor!” Harry said. During the investigation he had seen Professor Flitwick far more often out of class than in previous years.
“Actually, Nev, you can walk upstairs immediately… and please ask the girl’s Imagic in the painting to stay put, we might need her later,” Harry added.
“Brilliant!” Ron roared with laughter. “Can’t wait to see that prick again to wind him up about it! But I have to say I’m rather impressed by his mom, locking up nasty paintings… that woman certainly knows how to deal with shit. I guess being married to Lucius Malfoy gave her some practice.”
Harry stepped closer to the painting. At the moment no Imagic was to be seen in the forest, just falling leaves slowly gliding through the air. But he was well aware from now on any Imagic of the castle had access to their common room around the clock. If someone popped by in the early morning, they would find himself and Draco having their morning tea – well, together. This possibility made Harry slightly uneasy. Apart from that Harry was sure, Flitwick must have had a specific reason for putting the painting there, probably something to do with the missing Imagic.
