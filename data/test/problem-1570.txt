A boom echoed and all four champions hastened to the water’s edge and waded in. Harry paused to swallow his handful of gillyweed, then waded all the way into the water. Draco could not contain a quiet gasp as he felt his lower extremities become soaked in the chill. It was like before, like he was experiencing the cold second hand, but this water was insane. Draco felt like his legs were being stabbed by tiny needles. The transformation began and as Harry stood out of the water Draco felt the odd and incredibly uncomfortable sensation of growing gills. The skin on his neck felt as though it were tearing.
Harry glared at him. Confused and frustrated with how he was feeling. Harry was worried. Anxiety tightened at his chest as he kept reliving Malfoy being slammed against the ground over and over. He knew there were more injuries hiding beneath Malfoy's uniform.
“Leaving me with these two? What have I ever done to you?” Theo groaned, and Draco smirked at him.
“You will not sully the Malfoy name,” Father snapped. “Things are changing and we will be among those honoured for our loyalty. You will ensure our legacy continues.”
“He will be fine; I have placed him into a Dreamless Sleep to allow his body and mind to recuperate with as little stress as possible.”
“Tell me what the Manor is like,” Harry said, his quill scratching across the parchment in front of him.
“Harry pulled Ron from the Lake too, so either Dumbledore also doesn’t know or wasn’t outing them.”
“Wonderful, then you just need to learn to Apparate and then you can come kidnap me as much as possible,” Pansy interjected, and Draco looked at her in confusion. They always spent time with each other over the summer, but she had always been pretty happy at home.
“Do you think you would have married Pansy? If you never found your soul-mate, that is.” Harry asked.
Harry did the only thing he was currently capable of doing and spit as hard as he could. A wad of red tinged saliva hit the boy square in the face, dripping down and staining the light blue of his uniform. The boy angrily wiped it away, hatred and disgust filling his eyes.
So we get some more interactions between our fave duo and the much-needed handshake scene. I'm just a sucker for first names and hand shakes between these two. Next chapter is Draco's POV! He is so so fun to write so I am very excited for everyone to get to peek into our favorite Slytherin's mind.
“Yeah, I’m fine, just not very hungry,” Malfoy’s face morphed into one of annoyance and Harry resolutely stared back down at his plate.
“Draco, what is happening?” Severus demanded steering Draco into the shadows beneath the stands.
** Very very very minor, self harm trigger warning. The moment is very brief, and inadvertent, but I felt a need to warn everyone.**
“Oh, Luna, today is your birthday isn’t it? Happy Birthday!” Ginny said and Harry was quick to wish her a happy birthday as well.
“Get down!” Ron said suddenly, tackling Harry and Hermione to the ground. Harry groaned as his cheek collided with a root. A burst of red lights collided directly where they had been standing moments before, and loud voices filled the air as a large group of wizards converged on them.
He pulled out a box with gold trim on the paper and had a sneaking suspicion of who it was from.  Draco glanced around the room and confirmed that everyone was thoroughly engrossed in unwrapping their own gifts before carefully opening his. On top of a layer of tissue paper was a note.
Draco released one of his hands, and tugged Harry’s collar to the side. He planted his palm across the span of Harry’s mark. “This is mine,” Draco said fiercely.  He grabbed Harry’s hand and tugged his shirt to the side as well and pushed Harry’s hand against his moon. “This is yours.”
Draco was hopelessly endeared.
Draco looked down at him, the soft look returning. “Take your glasses off if you’re going to do that, you’ll injure your face.”
Suddenly, Harry felt an intense stabbing in his chest and he grasped at it, twin pangs of pain blossoming in his knee caps as they bit into the floor of the ward, his legs no longer able to support him. Madam Pomfrey’s eyes grew wide, “What is going on?!” Her voice was shrill, climbing several octaves.
Malfoy rolled his eyes, using a twig to poke holes into the pattern he had drawn. “I see, thank you, that completely clears everything up.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Hermione’s blush was evident, “No, no! Viktor and I didn’t bond.”
“Great, I was wondering the same thing about your dad. He ran before the Ministry captured him though, right?” Ron shot back, his ears turning red.
"Do you always perform wandless magic when you're upset? Fuck, how powerful are you?" Malfoy was staring at him, eyes wide.
“Look Malfoy –“ Ron burst, obviously embarrassed.
“So what does that mean?” Harry asked, perplexed. Draco and Hermione were staring at each other, seemingly having come to the same conclusion.
Draco tried not to think about that too much. Lucius had made his decisions and he would have to deal with the fallout.
“Hey,” He called back, setting down his quill.
“Is there a Portkey in the maze, another challenge?” He burst, uncaring. Something was terribly wrong, he knew it. Harry was too far away.
“Hey!” Harry jumped off the table, “My aunt and uncle might be awful, but not all muggles are.”
Harry nodded, “When are you free?”
Malfoy scoffed, "What makes you so sure?"
Harry shrugged, feeling awkward. “Hermione knows,” He burst, for lack of anything else to say.
“As infuriating as it is, it’s quite advanced magic,” Theo commented as he picked at some eggs. He had moulted once already.
“Parkinson …. And Nott are welcome here. If you have a problem with them, there’s plenty of table left, move away!” Weasley piped up, the tips of his ears pink. Draco was a little impressed, to say the least.
“Oh, that’s so sweet!” Hermione cooed, smiling at the couple. “I’ve never seen one happen!”
Draco was thankful for the familiar bickering. His anxiety was ranked up about 50 notches. He just couldn’t shake the feeling that something terribly wrong was going to happen. Although if he were being honest with himself, he felt that way during every task.
(See the end of the chapter for
To his surprise Harry laughed, “For someone so obsessed with soul-mates, you don’t know much about them. I have your mark and you have mine. Seamus sets everything on fire, he’s explosive, that’s why Dean has his flame. Seamus has Dean’s water, his calm. No, Draco, you’re the sun.”
Sudden inspiration struck and Draco took a deep breath before taking on an injured stride, grasping his ribs and limping his way through the doors to the Ward.
“Hermione, you’re not eating your pickle right?”
Harry smiled at him and Hermione, whom was settled on the couch next to Ron. Her hair was still smooth from the night before, and Harry could see what he had recently learned to be makeup on her neck. It was subtle and Harry suspected she had some love bites of her own. Thankfully, Ron was completely oblivious.
“Merry Christmas, Harry,” Draco smiled, crossing the room and twining his fingers into his hair and kissing him.
“It has to be more complicated than that. They aren’t just going to let him stand on the side of the lake and summon whatever he’s looking for,” Hermione sighed, pursing her face in thought.
“Then they shouldn’t waste our time.”
“Er, Father is coming to see me at the next Hogsmeade weekend.”
“I’m surprised there hasn’t been more bondings this year, with all the extra students here,” Hermione mused, stirring her eggs mindlessly around her plate.
“Ha!” Draco said, nudging Theo who shrugged.
(See the end of the chapter for
"This is too bloody weird," Ginny said as she watched Draco and Hermione interact.
Draco looked into the mirror. His face was an absolute mess. His cheekbone an angry red, a cut about two inches wide present right below his eye. Draco mopped up the stained blood until just the bruise and cut remained. He was going to have a massive black eye.
Hermione glanced around, irritated and worried by how utterly silent Draco was being, trying to think of a solution. Her eyes caught on a mound of snow outside of her melted circle and she quickly unwound her scarf. She scooped the snow into it and created a small bundle, pressing it gently to his face. He winced at the contact.
“Mad-Eye practiced the Imperius on the Gryffindors this morning.”
“I didn’t want to hear excuses,” He muttered, staring at the bed spread.
“Angry?”
Moments later he was asleep.
Finally, something was going right for them.
Harry nodded, “Thank you. I’ve never really told anyone about this stuff. Ron and Hermione mostly figured it out, or have seen it. But it doesn’t seem right to me that they know all of these parts of me, and you as my soul-mate don’t.”
“Draco?” He asked.
“I guess you’re my sun, and I’m your moon,” Harry said, his voice barely above a whisper.
Ron blushed and looked determinedly at the chess board. “Don’t know what you’re talking about.”
“Yeah my conclusion is a little shoddy, as well,” Hermione called over her shoulder, smiling at the two of them as she left the room. “See you later, Harry!”
“It’s not fair,” Harry mumbled and Draco laughed even harder.
Ha! Harry thought he was so special, being able to find Draco with that sodding Map of his. Now Draco could do the same.
“You did it, I am so proud!” Draco smirked, and found himself unbuttoning the top of Harry’s shirt without even realizing what he was doing until Harry’s eyes were on him.
“I think I may know who it is.”
“What’s that?” Draco asked as Harry held it up.
“Hey, shh, it’s okay,” Draco said hesitantly, slowly approaching Harry.
“Your father helped to create this map?”
Draco laughed out loud, his relaxed smile back on his face, “He didn’t do anything to them. There was a reason I asked you their schedule. He pissed me off. I paid them to play the prank on him.”
“I love you, Draco.”
“You are injured, we will go get her once you have been healed.”
As he stepped through, he could feel the concentration of magic around him as clearly as if there were a spiderweb of strings flowing around him. Draco focused on the feeling and suddenly he felt the residual magic of every Malfoy that had ever walked these halls. He could feel the power flowing around him from all of the witches and wizards casting around him. Draco closed his eyes, concentrating on one specific line of magic, made one thousand times easier by the fact that he was already so attuned to Harry. He placed his hand against his chest and focused as hard as he could, a thread made up of every colour of the rainbow reached out from him and away. Draco smirked, opening his eyes and followed the feeling of the magic reaching out from him. Like there were marks on the floor pointing him in the correct direction, Draco quickly and easily was able to find Harry inside the Great Hall.
“What did he do to you? I’m sorry I didn’t find you sooner. It took me a while to get back to the village,” Harry was slightly out of breath. Draco figured he must have sprinted the whole way there. Harry reached up towards Draco’s face and Draco caught his hand before he could touch him.
Harry looked at Draco, frowning, “No, of course not, she was angry at me on your behalf actually.”
The table was mostly a mix of laughter and dumb-struck looks.
This fic got a little smaller of a reaction than I was used to last chapter, I hope that had something to do with the length of the chapter and not the quality of what I wrote. Yall have spoiled me for sure. Thank you for everything. See you again on Thursday, unless tomorrow makes me so upset that I update faster...
Oh! This fic is rated Mature, it is staying that way for now, but could potentially elevate in later chapters for a variety of reasons. Now these boys are 14, but I try to keep in mind that in the Wizarding World, adulthood starts at 17. So these guys are the real-world equivalent of 15 year olds. Also, canon-typical violence (and more) is also a thing. I will endeavor to keep things M but (and I will give a warning) it may go to E. I haven't quite decided yet. Just giving you a heads up. Obviously if everyone who reads this will drop it if I go E, I will try to maintain the M level. Let me know.
Harry grinned at him, “Sap.”
Harry was absolutely miserable. He plopped down onto his four-poster, pulling off his shoes.
Draco ducked his head, he had completely forgotten about the cuts, they were so small, and they were so close to healing he hadn’t wanted to waste the potion to heal them. “I was slightly worried about you during the task.”
Draco didn’t deserve the two of them, Theo reflected.
Draco’s wand twirled in his hand viciously, sparks emitting from the tip. Draco busied himself with focusing on sending Harry soothing feelings. Harry was still overcome with despair and Draco couldn’t fathom what could be making him feel this way. He hoped Hermione or the Weasleys were with him. The pain in his leg and arm still ached.
A fate Harry could have very easily suffered himself.
Love,
“She knows best,” Harry assured. “I got you something.” He pulled the package out of his pocket and handed it to Draco. “I noticed you liked them, sorry you couldn’t come to Hogsmeade today.”
Draco chuckled, “You would have been wrong, until very very recently.” His eyes fixed onto Harry’s emerald irises.
“Theo!” Pansy called suddenly and Draco looked up to see Theo approaching, something was off about the way he was holding himself. He seemed anxious if Draco didn’t know any better.
“What?”
Alexis
“What’s that supposed to mean?!” She asked, her voice shrill.
“Sorry,” Harry mumbled, tugging harder at the root he had unearthed.
“We can continue this conversation in the morning!" Draco interrupted, "Harry you need to sleep, you’re barely keeping your eyes open!”
“Harry, are you all right?” Ginny asked, sitting down next to him at the table.
“Oi, Fred, pass the chips!”
“I can’t live without you,” Draco whispered to the dark and silent Ward.
“Thanks,” Harry said smiling softly at Draco.
“Fuck off, Granger,” Draco bit off, refusing to meet her eyes.
“That prize seems worth it enough, and it’s all so exiting, we’ll get to meet the other two wizarding schools!” Ron gushed.
Draco had never felt this nauseous in his entire life. He had only been able to force himself to choke down a single piece of toast this morning and a few sips of soup at lunch. He had of course pretended to eat, vanishing each bite before he got them past his lips. He was overcome with worry for Harry and had even been forced to use Occlumency to block his connection to Harry much like he had for part of their row. He knew his anxiety would do nothing to help Harry right now. He had caught a few glances at him throughout the morning and each time Harry looked more and more like someone marching off to the Dementor’s Kiss. Every couple minutes Draco did his best to filter good feelings though the bond, in Draco’s last ditch attempt at giving some semblance of helpful support to his soul-mate, but it was becoming harder and harder to do as the First Task loomed closer.
The "Set Lucius on Fire and Make Him Walk Across Legos" club meets on Tuesdays at seven :P That chapter was hard to write, I'm not gonna lie, I hope I did okay. Lots of character changes for Draco. We're actually getting kind of close to the end here. I don't quite know how many chapters, but she's within sight!
“Of course, I’m here, can’t let Weasley see my man naked, can I? Let’s get the rest of these clothes off and get clean.”
A small moon was printed beneath the note and Draco fought very hard to contain the smile that the letter brought out in him. Harry was confident that Draco represented the sun on Harry’s chest, and was obviously going with that logic for his signature. Draco carefully folded the note and tucked it under the box before peeling back the paper. Sitting at the bottom of the box was a dragon. It was about 15 centimetres tall and with some closer inspection Draco noticed it was a Norwegian Ridgeback. Draco chuckled at Harry’s cheek, his mind flashing back to their first year. He pulled out his wand and tapped the dragon. Instantly the dragon turned to look at him, stretching its neck and flapping its wings a couple times. Draco could barely believe what he was looking at, as the dragon crawled off the metal base and attempted to climb the side of the box.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco felt the other shoe drop, and panic filled his entire body. He was sure of two things, one Harry was incredibly hurt. He never went to the Hospital Wing unless forced to. Two, Theo one hundred percent knew about Draco and Harry’s bond. Draco forced himself to project calm, like he was attending dinner with his mother after an afternoon in Lucius’ study. Press the pain and anxiety down, and portray confidence. He could do this.
Draco didn’t hear what Theo said to him as he searched for Harry in the crowd, he finally found him, Harry looked like he wanted nothing more than to pull out his cloak and disappear. Granger was shoving him from the table, fear clear on her face. Draco’s stare shifted to Weasley’s and was shocked to see the incredible rage and jealousy open on his face. People were yelling things at Harry as he slowly and meekly made his way from the hall. Draco had to get out; he had to be anywhere but here. Panic was clawing at his chest, and he absolutely would not lose it here in the Great Hall. Once Dumbledore left the room, all hell broke loose and Draco was able to make his way out of the hall away from his housemates.
They were just cleaning up from their fifth round when the doors to the infirmary burst open.
Draco did yell out this time as he felt what must have been a Cruciatus hit Harry. So much more powerful than what the Beauxbatons boy had managed.
“Yeah, pretty much.”
“Can’t exactly blame you there, can I?” Ron sighed, collapsing down onto the bench.
Hermione smiled at him, looking like she wanted to say more, but bit her lip instead and moved to the door. Harry grabbed her hand and pulled her into a brief hug, thankful to have such an amazing and supportive friend.
“Is everything okay, Harry?” Ron asked suddenly, his hands deftly setting up chess pieces in front of the pair of them. Hermione was out with Krum and Harry has decided to actually spend time with his best mate.
“Mr. Malfoy, remain calm, I am here to help.” Pomfrey assured him, but Draco was still panicking.
“Gillyweed. It’s a plant that makes you grow gills and shit! Doesn’t quite matter about the mechanics, the important part is we figured out how to keep you alive and able to breathe underwater for an hour.”
“I can’t believe you still have it.”
“I think I see what you mean, Harry,” Hermione said in awe, pulling her hand away.
“Does Granger even like girls?” Pansy asked in a very quiet, vulnerable, voice.
“Yeah, I guess so.”
“Hey,” Draco crossed the room, abandoning his potion, he lifted Harry’s chin with a finger. “You don’t ever need to worry that I’m upset with you for being remarkable. You should be proud.”
“No, I will. Will you be all right for a minute?” Draco asked, turning to Harry.
Harry rolled his eyes, “You look fantastic, as per usual.” His eyes drifted to the pouch still perched at the foot of his bed.
“May I?” Hermione asked, reaching out towards Ron.
“Have you always been this disgustingly corny?” Harry asked, the corner of his mouth quirking up.
Harry choked on his orange juice again and resolved that he should probably just quit liquids altogether. “Er, yeah. Who would keep a soul-mark secret?”
The rest of the weekend past without incident. Draco kept an eye for Hercules, but expected it would take at least a day for his classmates to write letters and for there to be a turnaround. Instead he busied himself with another task he had left unattended. Getting revenge on Blaise for his homophobic comment. His first instinct had been to create a potion, but Blaise knew he was the best Potion-maker in their year and would immediately suspect him. There was one other place to go, and Draco hoped they’d give him the time of day.
Draco steeled himself, running his fingers through Harry’s hair, “How have you broken ribs before?”
“Draco!” Harry gasped, his eyes looking like they were on fire. His hands flew to the top of Draco’s robes and pulled them apart roughly. Draco noticed Harry’s hands were alight with the yellow fizzles, but where they touched Draco’s skin was just a gentle tingle only slightly more so than what Draco normally felt when Harry touched him. Harry’s eyes came up to focus on his before Draco felt Harry’s foot wrap behind his ankle and then Harry was tackling him backward the same way he had at the lake, what seemed like a lifetime ago. Draco braced for the impact of hitting the rough ground, but was met with a pillow-like softness.
“Er, I thought you knew… I felt everything last night. Our bond got stronger,” Draco said slowly, frowning at the sheer look of horror on Harry’s face.
“Sorry, Professor,” He grinned at Professor McGonagall, not sounding sorry at all.
“What do you want, Malfoy?” Ron groaned, tearing open a chocolate frog. “I’m not in the mood.”
The reality was Draco had no idea what he was doing. He had known Harry was in excruciating pain and had passed it off as training, despite the fact that his training had never been that painful. A random Stinging Hex here and there, but nothing to the calibre of what he experienced tonight. Draco had never felt so utterly useless. Who knows what could have happened to Harry tonight? He had gotten lucky to get away with the little injuries he had.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco returned her grin.“I believe I’m the one that’s supposed to compliment you, my lovely date. You look absolutely gorgeous.”
I had not expected the absolute explosion of reactions last chapter. Seriously so many comments! I was definitely expecting more people to not like Hermione/Pansy/Ron so I was very happy to see such a positive reaction. There will be way more of then in the next installment. That I can promise. Of course, this will stay Drarry though. They are my main focus. We do get to see a little epiphany in Ron this chapter. When Hermione leaves him to go check on Pansy it's kind of thrown in his face that he needs to get his shit together or he's going to lose both of his best mates.
“What, what do you mean? What have you done? He hasn’t even seen you since the summer.”
“It wasn’t about being a hero; I thought you knew me better than that.” Harry whispered the last words and Draco felt the hurt flow through.
“You boys better be packing!” Mrs. Weasley yelled from the ground floor.
Alexis
“Get on with it then, would  you?” One of the boys who had helped spell his limbs together sighed, gripping Harry’s bicep tightly.
Draco grabbed his stuff and grasped Pansy’s hand, leading her from the library.
Harry frowned, “Er, I guess? I never really thought about it. How can he be half-giant though? Are giants real?”
“I swear I saw them come through here,” Ron said distractedly, weaving through the trees.
“I’ve had more pressing thing to worry about, I guess,” Harry trailed off.
“So we’re best friends now?” Harry asked, throwing his hands in the air.
It was a testament to their friendship that Draco did not draw attention to Pansy’s blush.
That was how Harry found him. Draco had been repairing the dishes for the third time and figured he wouldn’t be able to repair them again; they were barely holding on as it was.
Harry simply stared at him, blinking as the water rushed over them.
Draco took a sip of his Butterbeer, as his Father took a sip of his own drink. Draco stared at the amber liquid and wondered how awful it must taste. He preferred his own whiskey chilled on the occasion he could have it, but his Father believed clinking was improper and only drank it chilled when alone in his study. Occasionally he would cast a cooling charm on his glass, but found it burdensome to have to continue to cast it.
Draco was inpatient. He had to know how Harry had done it. How had he wordlessly rebuttoned his shirt and completely disappeared with barely five seconds of time to react? He knew there were spells to become invisible, but they definitely had not been taught them yet. Harry did not strike him as the type to research spells in his downtime for fun. The Mud- Granger, Draco corrected himself, definitely seemed the type, so that was a possibility. Harry still would have done at least two spells wordlessly, which they definitely were not taught until 6th year. Draco never noticed Harry performing any other spells wordlessly; he was always very loud with the spells he cast in class.
Why was Theo’s life the way that it was? Why did he have to decide to go down to the greenhouses tonight of all nights? He should be glad he was where he was, otherwise who knows what could have happened to Scarhead and then Draco would have been a right bother. Theo quietly made his way back to the Common Room. He couldn’t afford to look or seem suspicious right now. He was sure the blame would fall on Slytherin regardless of how he got back to the Common Room, but hopefully Boy Wonder remembered his attackers. Theo knew from experience how messed up your mind got after being Cruciated. The Blue Twats would get what was coming to them though, he was sure Draco would make positive of that. Theo was just thankful that some well placed curses and a mimic spell on his footsteps had been enough to make Potter’s attackers run. He wasn’t sure he could have taken them all if they had stood their ground. Fucking cowards.
“Let’s get going, at this rate Weasley is going to be hunting the halls for you.”
He quickly made his way upstairs and into his dorm. Thankfully none of his other dormmates had turned in yet. Harry rooted in his trunk for his cloak and the map before charming his curtains shut and throwing the cloak over him.
Who's attacking Harry? This isn't the last we see of them. Big bonding up for next chapter, and the Second Task slated for the following. Who's finding their soulmate and will Draco be at the bottom of the Lake?  We shall see. Things really start to pick up from here. Like seriously, we'll be at the end of this before you know it.
“I’m perfect, he’s perfect.” Draco said fiercely.
Ron squinted at him, not at all buying Harry’s explanation, but agreed to go get breakfast.
Draco hurried away from Severus’ quarters; he noticed the pain in his leg had disappeared. Hopefully Pomfrey had done something to the injury. That had been excruciating and Draco was glad for it to be gone.
Alexis
“Which of you cast it?!” A tall, professional looking wizard yelled at them, wand pointing directly at Harry’s face. “Who did it?!”
“She would have been fine!”
Hermione sighed. ‘Later’ she sent him then went back to translating the passage. Her mind was spinning with the possibilities of what could be upsetting Draco.
Harry nodded and took the potion from Madam Pomfrey, "Promise?" He asked again and Draco had to bite his lip with how vulnerable Harry sounded.
“Ron said awhile ago that his soul-mate would have to hit him across the face!” Harry was still cackling and it was beginning to lighten the mood of the room.
Hermione nodded, they were finally past the village, and she felt the anxiety settling back in now that they were getting closer to the Castle.
Harry was still staring at the door, if he hadn’t known better; Malfoy had seemed almost concerned about him.
“Yes! Wait, yes! Charlie said something about them wanting only dragons that were mothers and even brought their nests along with them!”
“You don’t seem to enjoy unexpected loud noises,” Draco commented, lowering the shield and peeking into the cauldron.
Harry was silent for a while, the laughter gone from his face. Draco should have taken a moment to see how Harry was feeling, but all he could feel was his own anger.
Secretly Poppy had instantly thought that Albus was hoping for another double agent like Severus. She hoped that Harry would never allow such a thing to happen to his soul-mate. Poppy only had the slightest idea of what Severus had had to go through in the past and she knew it would not bode well for Draco. Poppy had had to stay in her office for a few moments longer when she overheard what had transpired between the Headmaster and Draco. She was also impressed at the level of Occlumency that Draco must have already achieved to have been able to notice Albus’s intrusion so quickly. He was frustratingly subtle when he was trying to be. Although, when taking into account who Draco’s godfather was, she wasn’t surprised he had mastered the art at such a young age. No, Albus had another think coming if he believed his carefully orchestrated way of handling Harry was going to continue. Poppy hoped Draco somehow put a stop to Harry returning to his family’s house this summer. Poppy could only imagine what he went through while with them, his low weight over the past three summers had not escaped her notice. Regardless of how many times she and Minerva implored the Headmaster to not send him back there, he always refused, stating it was of the utmost importance for him to continue returning.
Draco shrugged, “It’s not always malicious. Why should I give someone else information they could use against me in the future, for free? Everything has a give and take. If I don’t give anything, I don’t have to worry about the take later on.”
Draco blushed, “That’s not –”
“I have to thank you for everything, Parkinson. You’ve helped a bunch, it means a lot,” Harry said earnestly.
“We must let bygones be bygones, and forget childhood feuds. If there is one thing Harry and Draco have taught us it is that anyone can get past their differences. I expect the two of you to do the same,” Dumbledore said, his gaze switching between Sirius and Severus.
Next chapter we're back with Draco's perspective! I hope you all enjoyed some Draco and Hermione interaction! Thank you for the wonderful feedback as usual. We also will be getting a bunch of really exciting stuff next chapter! I promise. It's the best one yet. (In my opinion anyways) Any guesses as to what? (**Spoiler Alert**: At least one more person finds out about our fave soulmates)
“I’ll give you it back at the dorm,” He muttered. Draco could barely hear him over the explosion from the Hufflepuffs. Draco hadn’t realized how much tension he had been holding, worried that Theo had been right.
“Ron doesn’t know either, I’d wager. He kept asking Harry what was wrong and Harry just shrugged it off as a headache. It didn’t seem like he was hinting at anything else. I saw Ron with his brothers in town later on. I figured Harry was with Hermione or something.”
The door cracked open.
Draco ignored the incredulous looks McGonagall and Severus were shooting him, and tilted his head at Fudge whom had now turned a delightful shade of puce.
“Surprised they didn’t pin it on you, you said you were out on the grounds last night?” Blaise asked.
After lunch the twins materialized an Exploding Snap deck and Draco was drawn into a couple rounds.
“Lucius has always made it clear that he would join Voldemort when he returned. I have no intention of serving any master.” Or a master that murdered children, Draco thought to himself, but Draco decided he probably shouldn’t reference anything that happened tonight if he could help it. “I had hoped to see my mother again this summer, but it is evident he has made his decision clear.”
Normally Draco ate a muffin or scone with his morning tea. Draco was largely a morning person so he was often the liveliest of his group at breakfast. Hermione noticed that for three straight breakfasts, Draco ate only half of his pastry and was significantly more muted. On the fourth day Draco received post at breakfast. On this day he only tore apart his muffin, and barely actually consumed more than  a few bites.
“Yes, it is.”
“Ha! Didn’t think that through did ya?!” Harry laughed as Draco rubbed his ear. Draco was not in love with how much stronger their bond had gotten when it came to sharing each other’s pain.
“It had to be one of them!” He whirled to Ron and Hermione, his eyes wild.
Harry frowned, he hadn’t known that was even a thing either of them could do. He felt another stab of guilt for how terrible of a soul-mate he had been. “We’ll have to talk about that sometime, but first let’s focus on getting you better and fixing what suspicions might have come up from last night. I’m going to sneak out of here now, but I’ll be back.”
Without a word, Harry reached down and grabbed a pillow that had been half-shoved underneath the couch. In one fluid motion he brought it up towards Draco and by the time it had made the two-foot journey it was transfigured into an ice pack similar to the one’s she had grown up getting from her mother.
The music started and Draco’s lessons paid off apparently. Harry looked at least somewhat put together as he twirled the Gryffindor Patel around the floor. Krum and Hermione were also holding their own. Soon Dumbledore was joining the dance which signalled the rest of the couples could join. Draco waited a few moments before leading Pansy onto the floor. The two of them had been dancing together at Balls for as long as he could remember, it was almost second nature to follow their customary steps.
Father narrowed his eyes at him, “You have an image to maintain and a family legacy to live up to. You should not be wasting time and sullying your reputation with someone you do not intend to marry. What changed there? You always swore you had no feelings for the Parkinson girl.”
“Let’s see it then,” She instructed, making herself comfortable on a desk, smoothing her skirt down.
Harry blushed, “I was just trying to work on my wandless magic.”
“Should we go after her?” Hermione asked weakly.
“Is he all right? What happened to him?” Draco heard Harry ask, his voice urgent. Why was he asking about him?
“At the sound of the cannon, please enter the water and retrieve your lost person!”
“I think it is lovely of you to join us,” Luna’s soft and music-like voice floated from where she sat next to Ginny across from them.
His shoulder hadn’t hurt since the day of the task, but he could milk it for a bit, he was just thankful it had been on his right shoulder so Pomfrey could treat it without the whole tent seeing his Mark. The last thing he had needed was Skeeter catching a picture of that.
“Well that’s another thing we have to consider. Unless they plan on stealing you,” Hermione teased and Draco whipped around to stare at her, eyes wide. She looked at Draco in confusion for a moment before she realized what she said. “No! They couldn’t put children at the bottom of a lake for an hour, that’d be insane!”
“Nothing to complain about.”
Soon Mr. Weasley was yelling at them to go to bed, a relaxed smile on his face, and Harry couldn’t complain too much. They had gotten up so early, he could barely hold his eyes open as it was.
“That oaf, Hagrid, was chatting my ear off. I was worried he would report me for being out on the grounds, so I had to let him.” Theo sighed; acting like it had been an absolutely awful night. Draco’s anxiety was skyrocketing the longer this went on. Something was up, he was sure of it.
“There you are!” He complained, the sneer dropping from his face. “What was that about? You shouldn’t be out here alone.”
Draco rolled his eyes, “It’s asinine to anyone under the age of 40 probably. It’s the twenty-eight ‘most pure’ Pureblood families left. It includes those who haven’t married outside of the Pureblood lines too much and respected the ideals of Pureblood custom. Technically, Weasley’s younger sister would be a suitable match as well. They’re still considered part of the 28, despite the fact that they’re considered blood-traitors now.”
Malfoy looked down, carefully pulling Harry’s collar to the side again, looking at the sun mark.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Ron, catch!”
“I’d hope not,” Draco chuckled, sucking hard on Harry’s neck and smirking at the noise Harry made.
Harry looked up; eyes sliding past Ron’s face to Malfoy’s, who was currently staring at Harry from across the Hall, eyes squinted in similar concern.
Draco was putting on quite the show of pretending he wasn’t absolutely filled with rage, but Harry smirked at him. “You do know I can feel what you’re feeling, yeah?”
Pansy was wearing pink robes, with eye shadow and lip-gloss to match. The cut of the robes definitely flattered her figure more so than their school uniform.
“See you, Ginny. Bye, Luna.”
Draco dropped the two hairs into the goblet, “I, Draco Lucius Malfoy, have found and accepted my soul-mate, Harry James Potter. I vow to use my magic and life to protect and uphold the Malfoy magic, and the Potter magic. I now lend myself to your judgement.” Draco cast the end of the spell and opened up his mental shields, focusing on the goblet and dagger.
“It’s all rubbish as I said, but the Potters weren’t because it’s also a popular muggle surname, and they are too pro-Muggle. I also personally think it has to do with the fact that the Potters were a massive Indian line, and the wizard that created the list was racist and petty. There were all of these trade issues back then; I don’t feel like getting into it. Most of the old families still found the Potter name to be a respectable family until your father married your mother. Another huge part of the Sacred 28 is the pure magical power each of the families has. It’s part of the reason why my Father probably wouldn’t consider a serious marriage with Pansy and me. The Parkinsons have never been the most powerful of wizards and witches. The Weasleys are even known to have more power than they are, which is obvious if you look at any of them. I will give them that. But obviously, the Potters are insanely powerful, as was your mother so in terms of power you would be a ‘respectable’ match. If you weren’t male my Father would probably even consider it after some convincing.”
“Fuck, Draco,” He gasped and Draco forced himself to pull away, a smirk on his face. Harry mirrored him, a pleased look on his face. “Why haven’t we done that before?”
“Granger, I want to offer my sincerest apology. I have not treated you well in the past, and the names I have called you previously and more recently are completely unacceptable. I do not expect you to accept right now, but it is important to me that you know that I am working on myself to the best of my ability. I just hope you understand the unique pressures I am under due to my house and family, although they are not an excuse. I offer you my word that I will not utilize the slur I called you again, unless it is of the utmost importance to protect Harry or myself.” Harry noticed Draco quickly adapted an aristocratic presence whenever he was uncomfortable.
“Draco, what are you on about? Portkey?” Blaise asked. Theo and Pansy were looking at Draco, eyes wide but silent.
Harry squinted at them, “What do you want for it?”
“I have it taken care of,” Draco said flippantly. His mind on one thing and one thing only. “Can I go to him now?”
Draco narrowed his eyes at him, crossing his arms tightly across his chest. Pomfrey had given him a long-sleeved hospital gown that covered up to his neck.
Fudge whipped around, eyes bulging as they landed on Draco. “Young Malfoy, what are you doing here? Surely you were not injured during tonight’s events?”
Malfoy was standing in front of a cauldron, his uniform shirt rolled up to his elbows. At the sound of the door opening, he whipped around, wand in hand.
“You’re leaving?” Harry asked, looking resigned.
Severus appraised him a few moments before nodding his head minutely.
"You all right, Harry?" Hermione asked.
Draco smiled, crossing the room and crushing Harry to his chest. “Missed you,” Draco whispered quietly into Harry’s ear so Pansy wouldn’t hear.
"I solemnly swear that I am up to no good," Harry whispered, pressing his wand to the map.
“That’s fair,” Neville said, before his head snapped to the side as the compartment door slammed open. Harry felt his stomach somersault as Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle appeared in the doorway.
“I really don’t think Ginny still has her crush on me, but I won’t ask her. It’ll probably end up with Ron and I going alone, and me grabbing the first girl I see and opening the dance with them. Why does it have to be a girl anyways? Why shouldn’t I be allowed to bring a man?”
“Yes, so I guess they’re taking something from you. If you don’t get it back in time, you lose it,” Draco shrugged it all seemed pretty straight forward to him.
“Who’s ruffled his feathers?” Draco asked and everyone around him laughed. They were just about to get up to leave when Hercules soared down and landed neatly in front of him. Draco plucked the note from his leg. “Get going Hercules, you don’t want any of this food.”
Draco was getting really annoyed with the impressive magical feats his soul-mate could perform, one was going to get a complex if this continued.
“I’ll – fine,” Draco slurred, turning his face towards her. Hermione breathed a quiet sigh of relief, at least he wasn’t paralyzed or something like that.
Draco stifled a groan, “You’re infuriating, are you aware of that?”
“You will need to become aware of the affects of your bond, you cannot let ignorance lead to anything close to the severity of what happened tonight. I will provide the literature. Now, I have paperwork to fill out, if you could stay with him until I return.”
Harry and Malfoy sat side by side leaning against the wall, neither had said anything for a couple minutes. A loud beeping broke the silence and Harry startled violently at the noise. Malfoy shot out a hand to steady him, raising his wand to turn off the beeping.
"Merlin, Potter, what are you doing here? How did you even find me?"
“I don’t think –“ He complained before Harry cut him off.
"Good.” Malfoy stepped back, nodding at him. “Now if you're content with my healing, I have to go."
“I had wondered if you would have known.”
Laughter burst from Draco, the grey iris not covered by the ice pack briefly flitting to her.
“What do you think Charlie meant?” Ron asked as soon as they got settled in their compartment.
“He expects all of that of you?” Harry asked, his voice soft.
“That’s my son!” A desperate voice broke through the din, and Mr. Weasley appeared as he shoved through the group of wizards. “Lower your wands! That’s my son!”
“So his soul-mate was getting hurt.”
Harry laughed, “I’m just saying, just because you aren’t soul-mates, doesn’t mean you can't be with her. Who knows, maybe you are and ‘your souls aren’t ready yet’.” Harry made air-quotes and Ron cackled loudly.
Draco laughed out loud, moving one of his hands to lightly swipe Harry’s hair out of his eyes, his thumb running over the scar there. Draco felt the ragged skin and even a slight twinge of magic as his hand skimmed over it. Harry winced slightly as Draco touched it, and Draco recoiled.
That was how Hermione found them, they had, of course, sprung apart the second the door opened, but Harry could tell from her smirk that she had seen. Draco took a few steps away from Harry, and Harry could see part of the Draco he had come to see in classes and when Draco was around his housemates, fall into place like a mask. Harry hoped eventually Draco could be the person Harry knew in front of company that didn’t include just himself. His head was held high, his shoulders back, posture perfect.
“Draco, Draco, can you hear me?” Hermione’s panicked voice filtered through.
Remus gasped, “Draco Malfoy! Everyone was talking about it.”
A few moments after he heard the ward’s door swing shut after Draco, they flew open again and Hermione and Ron quickly appeared inside the curtains.
Draco’s jaw was clenched more often than not now-a-days. His patience was also abnormally thin. He was snapping at his Housemates constantly, and was mostly quiet when Harry and he were able to spend time together. Harry attributed it to the stress and the more time Draco was spending with his Housemates. Harry had been busy most nights between school work, training, and trying to spend time with Ron and his other friends.
“Hogwarts: Potion Master’s quarters,” He pronounced clearly. With a whirl he was back at the Castle. He could barely believe it had worked.
Draco stared at him in confusion before remembering that Harry probably knew next to nothing about his family, “Well invisibility fabrics were founded in India. They were the first to weave them. The Potters are a very affluent Indian family, it makes sense they would have a good one. That thing must be at least what, 20 years old, at the least? I’d wager it’s much older. Other run-of-the-mill cloaks would have faded by now.”
Draco almost cried from relief. This woman deserved all of the things. Draco would make sure she got a raise if it was the last thing he did. That or a really nice fruit basket, with elf-made mead and those really expensive chocolates too. That ought to do it.
Draco laughed despite himself, “You think he wouldn’t have come here to curse the gay out of me if he did? Lucius does not, no.”
Hermione frowned more deeply, but listened to him, casting a glance around the corner before darting out and catching up to a group of Ravenclaws.
Malfoy scrubbed a hand down his face, “You’re my fucking soul-mate.” Like that was a clear enough explanation. “Take this, the password is ‘pure’. Tap it, say the password, and then think of the Weasley pigst – the Weasley home.” He shoved a bottle cap into Harry’s hand.
Draco seized at his shirt and realized it was fully buttoned again, and Harry was nowhere to be seen. Calming feelings were flowing through the bond, with an edge of adrenaline and excitement.
“Harry you’re awake!”
Draco supposed he couldn’t blame Weasley for being protective after the night Harry had just had.
“Then I guess there will be enchantments or something to keep him from summoning it, he’ll have to go into the Lake. Merpeople can’t leave the water all the way. If they took it, it’s in the Lake.”
“Harry!” Sirius boomed, holding his arms out and Harry ran forward for a quick hug.
Draco opened his eyes, encountering an empty classroom. He knew the door had never opened, and he could feel that Harry was still close, so once again Harry had disappeared without a spell being cast. He stood there for a few moments, perplexed, before he felt Harry’s hand on his chest. He instantly reached out and felt his hand collide with a very solid object. Draco grasped what felt like silk and tugged, watching Harry materialize in front of him, a bright smile on his face.
Draco tried not to react too strongly, despite how thoroughly shocked he was that they were allowing the insane ex-Auror to perform Unforgiveables on students. “He best not think he’s doing that to us,” Draco sniffed. His body would be stiff and cold before he would allow that poor excuse for a man to gain control over him again.
“Fucking Longbottom of all people had the book I needed,” Draco groaned and looked back towards Pansy. She had kicked back in the chair she had transfigured and was smiling at the two of them.
“Great, you’ve caught up, now can you leave? One Slytherin is enough in here,” Weasley said testily. Draco looked at him eyes wide. No one spoke to Pansy like that.
Harry shrugged, “I don’t want to take this chance away from her. I wish Ron would grow a pair and ask her. I know he wants to. Maybe I’ll just take Ginny, she can’t go otherwise.”  Draco’s fingers stilled.
“Is there a reason you aren’t healing this?”
Harry laughed, amused by how put out Malfoy was, “Surprisingly, yes. Don’t look so miserable, you can’t say you didn’t have fun.”
“Malfoy, what-“
“Yes?” Harry stared at Malfoy who suddenly ran over to a tree and set a hand against it, bending over, his other hand over his mouth. “What the hell, Malfoy?” Harry ran over, unsure of what to do.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah well, I’ll make you read about Muggles! I guess I shouldn’t be surprised, everything else in the fairytales growing up are real, mermaids aren’t that far off.”
More pain flared in his leg and a feeling of extreme adrenaline and anxiety, then more pain and shock and despair, and Draco realized with intense relief that Harry was back on the grounds.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco had someone posing as his girlfriend, and he was jealous of Harry? Made perfect sense.
Harry had to agree with him there.
Draco forced himself to nod, distracting himself from what Harry was experiencing. He cast the spell and felt some slight relief as the air heated around them.
Harry was very intrigued by this girl, and couldn’t help staring at her. She smiled brightly at him and then looked over to Ginny.
(See the end of the chapter for
“We’re well,” Remus answered, cutting over Sirius. “How about yourself?”
“Thankfully, I was quite far last night,” Harry said casually and Draco looked at him in confusion.
Harry was panicking. One moment he was heading back to the Common Room with Hermione, the next he was seeing Parkinson and Nott dragging a very sick looking Draco down the hallway. Draco had been completely out of it and for the first time since their fight Harry had noticed how utterly awful Draco looked. His skin had been almost translucent with how pale he was, there were deep dark circles under his eyes, he was covered in a slight sheen, and he had been shaking like a leaf. Harry had asked what was wrong with him, but deep down he already knew. Draco had tried to move toward him, and fallen, smacking his face on the ground, not even attempting to break his fall. Draco had gasped what Harry thought had been a gross approximation of his name and had passed out after that.
Hermione was reeling. This wasn’t the first time? Draco was talking like what had happened had been almost common-place.
Next chapter is an intense one! This one was sort of set up for it. I promise to update soon!! Let me know your thoughts!!
“What standards?! You’re still doing really well in your classes, we don’t have Quidditch, what else is there?”
“They’re deplorable!”
“Do you unbutton your shirt on purpose?” Harry finally burst, breaking the silence. Draco couldn’t stop himself from laughing at how incredibly bothered he sounded, the vulnerable feeling vanished.
Sorry for the cliffhanger but it had to be done. This update was at least slightly longer than usual (I apologize for how short these updates are, but I can either update frequently with short chapters or update far less frequently with longer chapters). So we finally have some real drama up in here. I'm terrible at making characters suffer so this was a real accomplishment for me.
“Glamour?”
“I mean you did walk in here tonight; you’ve got to have some Gryffindor courage in you,” Hermione teased, which Draco rolled his eyes at.
“A Portkey? The Cup will transport the winner back to the front of the maze.”
“Excuse me, what?” Draco asked, then shook his head, “You all caught him though, right? What was just happening?”
“I think the fact that the two of you just bonded is evidence enough, but yes. She told Harry so when he was wondering if he was weird for liking more than one gender.”
Then the life he had made for himself; a world of love and those who truly cared about him for who he was. With people who would worry about him when he didn’t return, who picked up the pieces and healed him. Not to have a favour later on, but because they were worried about him. Lucius had said he had forgotten his place and had to figure out his priorities. Lucius had done nothing but absolutely cement Draco’s decision on what mattered. Who mattered.
“What did pretty-boy want?” Draco asked, tracing the lines of Harry’s mark.
“Theo!” Pansy crooned as he sat down, she was sitting in Draco’s lap as per usual.
“Sorry, mate, a man has needs,” Draco was barely able to force the lie across his tongue.
Thank you for being such an amazing part of my 2020, I hope this fic has helped you through some tough times. I hope to wrap this story up soon and then move on to Year 5. Saturday is my birthday so I hope to get another chapter out then as my gift to all of  you, but we shall see how busy I get.
The pain had vanished from the bond and Draco carefully pressed against his chest pretending to scratch his pectoral. There was no return warmth as there normally was but Draco also had a pretty thick jumper on today and wouldn’t be surprised if Harry hadn’t even felt it. Harry must still be so far away, Draco could barely feel anything except the exhaustion that was ever present nowadays.
“Love me?” Harry asked hopefully and the corner of Draco’s mouth pulled up in a smirk, his hands gripping each of Harry’s hips lightly. They were in Harry’s dorm; Draco had taken to spending as much time as physically possible with Harry. Apparently, some of the Slytherins had not taken Draco’s defection well.
“Ugh! That’s the worst, what was he prattling on about? Some terrible creature or one of his favourite Gryffindors?” Pansy gushed, leaning towards Theo.
Happy New Year everyone! If you're reading this on New Year's Eve or New Year's Day or whenever, we made it through 2020. I hope you are safe, happy, and healthy. I read this and thought it was fitting but, "I hope your thoughts stay positive and your tests stay negative".
“Excuse me-”
“Didn’t realize the Golden Boy had it in him,” Pansy giggled. “I’m going to go dance with Theo now, be nice to Millie.”
“Nope,” Draco popped the ‘p’ and finished tying his tie. He hated how tightly it cinched if he tried to tie it by magic.
Harry continued to stare at him, words failing him. Malfoy stood up, stomping to the edge of the lake and kicking some sand in. “Stop staring at me like I should be committed! I’m trying to help!”
“But Harry’s a bloke.”
“In a minute,” Harry said as he reached to touch Draco’s mark.
“On the word of who? A delusional criminal and a teenager? A teenager who, as I understand, is less than credible? Having little fits left and right!”
“I might vomit,” Malfoy gasped out. Harry’s eyes bulged and he hesitantly ran his hand lightly over Malfoy’s shoulders.
“Fred, George!” Ron called out, looking around wildly.
Severus’ lip curled and Draco was sure he had never seen his Godfather this upset. He had figured Severus knew about how Lucius parented, but perhaps he hadn’t. That or actually seeing the evidence was damning enough.
“Oh!” Pansy hastened her pace, “Hurry up then. You’ve been stashing him away for far too fucking long.”
“Not so brilliant are you, Potter?” The boy sneered at him, “Just goes to show how much you don’t deserve to be a Champion.”
Harry couldn’t believe the calibre the professional teams played at. He could barely keep track of where the Quaffle was, due to the speed the chasers threw it to one another. Harry kept his eyes peeled for the golden glint of the Snitch. Catching it in his view a couple times before it would disappear again.
Harry’s vision cleared and he realized his glasses must have cracked when his face collided with the ground minutes before. Theodore Nott stood over him, fear painting every inch of his face.
“Lucius has no control over me anymore. For once Pureblood custom has come in handy with their traditions and rituals. In the eyes of the Malfoy line, I am a fully matured adult. I have my own accounts and my own business and properties, but most importantly I have magic without restrictions. We will worry about that later. For now, let’s get you in some clothes and go back out to your family. I’m sure they are quite worried about you.”
She smiled at him kindly, and stood up, holding out her hand for him to take. “Well, Draco, I would absolutely love to be your girlfriend, thanks for asking. We should get back to the Common Room.”
Draco had the audacity to laugh at him, “Oh, be quiet, you’ll be fine.”
“We would
“You’re something all right,” Harry affirmed, bending down to bring his lips to Draco’s.
“It’s kind of hard to explain. It’s almost like the feeling when you drink Butterbeer. Warm.”
Thankfully Pomfrey was standing just outside the door and handed Draco a change of clothes for Harry. Draco didn't spare a glance past her before grabbing the clothes and going back into the room.
“You’re so pale though! Stand out in the sun every once in awhile!”
“Please, help him,” Harry choked, worried how bad things must be for Draco if they were even a shadow of what he was feeling now. Pomfrey turned towards Draco, pulling his shirt apart to bear his chest, she gasped as his mark came into view. She whirled around pointing her wand at him and Harry felt himself being hauled across the floor towards Draco, his knees dragging across the tile.
Maybe everything would be okay, Harry was only 14, and they couldn’t expect him to compete against 7th years. Students who were of legal age and able to consent to a tournament like this, Harry was too young.
“What is going on?!” McGonagall asked, her voice sharp.
“I have to agree, brother mine.”
Harry laughed at that, “Right after she did that Ron commented about how at least she knew the two of you weren’t soul-mates.”
“I’m okay, I feel completely fine. My face hurts a bit, and my body aches, but no worse than any Quidditch practice.”
“We won’t be bothered tonight,” Draco called, leaning back against the table, arms crossed against his chest.
“What is she on about? Why am I the bad guy?”
“ – is ridiculous! I told you he shouldn’t be forced to compete!”
Harry made it to right outside the door before he quickly checked the map one last time, pocketed it and his cloak, and pushed through the door.
As much as Draco did not want to go back to the Common Room right now, Draco didn’t see how he was going to get out of it. He was suspicious enough as it was; the last thing he wanted was Pansy and Theo looking into his activities more deeply.
“Morning,” Draco said offering his arm. She clung to it.
Draco took a few deep breaths, and wiped his face with Hermione’s scarf. The bleeding from his cheek had stopped, her scarf stained with his blood. Draco noted what the scarf looked like so he could purchase her a new one before hauling himself to his feet. Draco pulled his wand and cleaned his clothes. He strode down the alley before ducking back into the Three Broomsticks, heading straight to the loo. Draco spelled the door shut, finding the room blessedly empty.
“Would you like to explain what just happened?” She asked turning towards Harry, her tone still icy. She summoned a chair for him to settle on.
Weasley whipped to the side to look. “Well, there’s no one there!”
Malfoy stopped chewing on his lip, instead digging his hand slightly into his ribcage, wincing. Harry felt pain quickly shoot through his torso, and gasped, his hand flying to his side.
The moment was spoiled just seconds later.
Draco felt eyes and whispers follow him as they moved towards the Great Hall. The whispers increased tenfold as they entered. Draco strode towards their table with confidence. He had barely began steeping his tea when Severus placed a hand on his shoulder and practically drug him from the Hall.
"Oh, okay," Harry looked back down at Malfoy’s chest and noticed the dark shadows further down on his torso. "You did break a rib, goddammit Malfoy!" He cried, instantly enraged.
It didn’t take long as the twins made their way towards him, muttering quietly to each other.
“Who?”
“What do they all have in common? They’re nesting; Charlie said they had to bring their eggs.” Hermione pointed out.
“Okay then.”
Draco was briefly hurt that Harry had so little faith in him, but pushed it down, it’s not like he didn’t deserve it, “I’m not an idiot, I know you didn’t do it.”
Draco was staring at him with pride and something else in his gaze, “I guess I’m just your lucky charm.”
"The World Cup," Draco answered stiffly. Wanting nothing more than to button his shirt the rest of the way, but he had told Harry he'd leave it open and who knows when he would wake up again.
Draco did not go and sit next to Harry as he would have preferred, instead plopping down onto the bench next to Theo, barely able to keep his excitement inside himself.
“Look, I don’t know too much about relationships. I don’t know how my Aunt and Uncle are even still together. I don’t remember my parents much, but I have seen how Mr. and Mrs. Weasley love each other. I see how Dean and Seamus take care of one another. I’ve never felt this way towards anyone else before. I’m unsure about a lot of things nowadays, but I know I’m not unsure about you. I – I love you, Draco. I just needed you to know that.”
“It’s just past eleven,” She whispered, her voice barely carrying to him. Draco didn’t try to think too hard about how exactly she knew what he had wanted to ask. Hermione was curled in a ball on the bed next to them, but she was wearing a different set of robes then she had been wearing yesterday. Weasley was snoring softly from Harry’s other side. His head tipped backwards; arms crossed. The twins were sprawled spread-eagle in the aisle between the rows of cots, as if it were the most comfortable place to sleep on the planet.
Weasley looked up at him, blinking in surprise. “Er, thanks. Harry! You hungry?”
“Draco, what are you doing up here? We’ve all been searching for you,” Pansy called, running down the corridor. Draco was leaning against a wall, not quite able to support himself with how exhausted he felt. He felt like every cell in his body weighed as much as a dragon. His chest was on fire, although the rest of his body was freezing.
ANYWHO, enjoy, everyone have a wonderful weekend, see you again soon.
“Well, er, Mr. Malfoy, no need to be hasty here. I am sure you must have misheard me. As for the situation with Crouch, it was beyond my control. Obviously, I had not instructed the Dementor to Kiss Crouch.”
“Why didn’t you leave like I told you to?!” Malfoy growled, anger lighting his features.
“I’m fucking freezing, but Pepper-Up should help.”
“Well let’s try it,” Harry said getting to his feet from where he had been sprawled out on the floor of their usual classroom. He crossed the room to the window and stuck his arm out of it. Snow had been falling off and on for the past week and a cold wind pushed through the open window.
Malfoy was silent for awhile, methodically stirring the cauldron. Finally he spoke, "I was deflecting what Blaise sent at you. I shouldn't have done it, he was furious with me for it, but he hasn’t pressed the issue after what happened," he shrugged.
Love,
He had never come out to any of his friends, officially, but it was an unspoken truth he knew Pansy was aware of.
“Today we’re going to continue working on dodging, evading, and summoning or transfiguring things to block spells.”
“Ah well,” Harry shrugged and pocketed the bottle cap, allowing Draco to tug him from the dorm.
“I am deeply sorry. If you would rather have Weasley in here, I would understand.”
“Did I say something?” Harry asked, perplexed.
Harry narrowed his eyes at him and Draco heard Hermione snort.
"You were limping; don’t tell me you're fine! If you're allowed to be concerned about me, I can be concerned about you." Harry crossed the room peering into the cauldron, and peeked at Malfoy from the side of his eye.
“You’re absolutely useless, how have you survived this long?” Malfoy sighed before checking around the side of the tree and dragging Harry back onto the trail where a large mass of people were shoving their way through. Malfoy had Harry’s forearm in a death grip as he quickly cut his way through the crowd. Harry idly wondered how one fostered such a skill; Malfoy was incredibly good at getting where he wanted to quickly.
Harry made his way to their classroom, eager to get some time with Draco. He had felt an overwhelming need to be near him since the Hogsmeade trip and also hadn’t gotten a chance to tell Draco about what he and Sirius had spoken about while there. He cast the spells needed to enter the room, and entered to find Draco already seated. He was working on an essay of some sort, his hair hanging down over one of his eyes as he bent over the parchment.
“You think my parents are going to be thrilled about my bond?” She explained quietly into his ear, her voice barely able to be understood despite how close they were sitting.
Draco bit his lip,
“You- Know- Who!” Hermione said, her eyes still on the sky, her hand shaking where it clenched Harry’s elbow.
Harry felt his back hit the wall, “I love you?”
“As we have discussed, Voldemort has returned!”
Draco made it to the main foyer of the Manor without incident. He expected nothing less and hoped his luck would hold out. Draco heard piano notes drifting from the salon and ached to go see his mother. It had been so long since he saw her, but he needed to get in and out undetected. Draco bit his lip and pushed on.
Weasley narrowed his eyes, but eventually rolled them before scoffing at him, quickly disappearing back within the curtains.
“And you’re … okay with it?” Draco asked, feeling incredibly vulnerable. He hadn’t thought about how much Theo’s approval meant to him until that moment.
“What changed?” Harry asked and Draco would have thought he was fishing for compliments if it were anyone but Harry.
“I wish fifteen was more exciting. It’s like eleven you get your own wand, thirteen you may get a soul-mate, then nothing until seventeen,” Blaise pouted and Draco kept himself from disagreeing. He had some major plans for turning fifteen. He just hoped everyone forgot about this particular Pureblood tradition.
“Er, yeah, would you care for some?”
“Are you ever going to reveal how you know I’m alone?” He asked, slicing up ingredients.
“Why in Merlin’s name would I ever be mad?”
“Please give her my love.”
“So are we doing this?” Harry asked as they left the Hospital Wing. “We’re not hiding anymore?”
“That’s what that was right?” Harry asked, pulling Hermione from her mental pictures of the book she had read.
“Oh,” Harry said simply, biting his lip.
“I will not tolerate any harm coming to muggles…” Dumbledore warned, his eyes flashing.
Draco was momentarily distracted as he felt a stabbing pain in his elbow. A few moments passed where Harry seemed distracted, and then terror more so than Draco had ever felt flooded through. Draco couldn’t imagine what Harry must be experiencing.
“I mean, I guess, but it was mostly about the fact that you’re a man. The only thing worse in my Father’s eyes than being with a muggle, is being with a man. I can’t produce an heir with a man. I’m the last Malfoy. I’m of no use to him if I can’t continue the line. Father knows that if I’m hiding something from him, that it means I’ve found an ‘unsuitable bond-mate’, otherwise I wouldn’t keep it from him.”
“Whose?”
Hermione hurriedly grabbed the three butterbeers and went back to their table.
“God Ron, you’re so thick!” Hermione burst, smacking him in the shoulder.
Harry nodded, running his fingers across Draco's Mark again.
Harry’s head snapped up and Draco saw a fire in them that he hadn’t seen aimed at him in almost a year.
His eyes focused on Draco’s neck just as Hermione spoke, “Those are quite some love bites Malfoy has. Harry could you pass me the sugar?”
“You feeling better?” Harry asked, pocketing his Cloak. His own chest no longer ached at all.
“What the – “ Harry complained before a hand was clamped over his mouth. Immediately Harry went for his wand and realized it wasn’t in his waistband like it normally was.
Draco snorted, bringing her back out of her thoughts.
“Damn it!” Harry cursed as his bag broke and his belongings fell to the floor.
Harry ignored her, casting a spell at the doors to lock them and bound across the room.
Harry looked absolutely livid, “I’ll fucking kill him.”
“Ew, no! I don’t want to think about that!” Harry shuddered.
Even though Harry was out of the water and being shrouded in numerous blankets and Warming Charms, Draco was still frozen to the bone. Even his own Warming Charm did little to help. It was like when he would come in after being in the snow for hours, sometimes it felt like he’d never get warm. He hoped some Pepper-Up Potion would help once they could go inside. Draco barely heard the judges give their scores. Harry, Hermione, and Weasley were cuddling close together on the beach. Fleur was thanking Harry profusely, the small girl clinging to her, visibly shivering. Harry was nodding to her, but Draco could feel anger boiling through their bond. Draco didn’t quite understand what was bringing it on.
Thank you times a million to everyone who helped me get this far, who has read this story, who has left wonderful words or kudos or bookmarks. We still have quite a bit of excitement left. Including Draco's birthday, the Third Task, a bonding (or two), and Harry and Draco's solution for the summer hols. Buckle in everyone, this is where it gets crazy!
Harry sighed, “I was worried about that. Let’s get going, I promised Draco I would be back. He isn’t completely well yet.”
Harry stared blankly down at his food, pushing his dinner around absently on the plate.
“Here,” Draco grabbed a tissue from the table and gently dabbed.
“Interesting,” Pansy mused as Draco chugged the Pepper-Up. Almost instantly he felt better. He rubbed at his Mark idly, hoping to send some comfort Harry’s way.
“Builds character,” Harry grinned, and laughed at Ron’s mumbled curses.
“But I thought you liked Harry!” Ron said, his voice a couple octaves too high.
“Too bad, I have,” Draco spit, tugging Harry with him. They made it down the spiral staircase where the Weasleys and Hermione were waiting.
Draco really did need to figure out how to tell them apart.
“What am I going to do with you?” Draco asked, but couldn’t keep the fond look from his face.
Theo smirked back at him, “Come on, let’s go grab breakfast before they come looking for us. We’re going to need full stomachs if we’re committing some Azkaban-able offenses.”
“You said I would lose her!” Fleur screeched, this time in French. “I do not care about myself! Let me go!”
Draco stared at the packet of Sugar Quills, “How utterly thoughtful, Potter, thank you.”
“And it’s not platonic?”
"Is that you? Can I feel what you're feeling? This is insane!" Harry asked, feeling even more anxiety bloom in his chest.
Father did not slow his stride as he hauled Draco down the alleyway next to the Three Broomsticks and into the small, empty street behind it, normally only used for deliveries and to house the rubbish bins.
Draco nodded along to the words, happy that he wouldn’t be forced away. “Thank you, Madam, I cannot adequately express my gratitude.”
“How she can have top scores and not fly a broom is beyond me.”
Harry screamed the words at him, and Draco felt the pure unadulterated anger and rage flowing through the bond. This is what Harry must have been mad about the day before.
“Were the two of you aware of your bond previously?”
Harry rolled his eyes, and shoved Malfoy’s shoulder with his own. He smirked over at him in what Harry could only describe as fondness. It was an odd, but welcome look on Malfoy’s face.
“I saw so many people with them at the Cup, and Ginny was talking about it, she just turned thirteen so she’s hoping to meet her soul-mate this school year. I guess compared to everything else, it’s not that far-fetched, it’s just a little crazy to me, one person who complements you perfectly.”
Without a word Severus took a few steps towards him and clasped his shoulder tightly.
“So that’s what put Potter in the Hospital Wing,” Pansy commented, sipping her tea.
“First things first, If I were going to curse Potter, I would have waited until we’re inside, I assure you. And I wouldn’t have only cursed him; I’d have cursed all three of you. Secondly, unless you don’t understand basic physics, which come to think of it you probably don’t, the curse obviously came from over there. If any of us had cast it he would have been blasted forward not to the side. ” Draco gestured towards the forest.
"I can't believe this; I can’t believe you!" He whispered back angrily.
“I am sure I do not know what you mean, Father,” Draco drawled back at him. Draco knew this day would not be ending well for him, what use was it trying to please him anymore?
Harry nodded, still looking no happier, Draco grasped his hand and squeezed tightly.
“I would estimate about 30 seconds to a minute, possibly shorter,” Draco calculated, trying to think about the intense pain he had felt earlier. He glanced away from Harry for a second to see Madam Pomfrey pursing her lips.
“Anyways, get out of here, go back to your ginger before he gets more suspicious than he probably already is.”
“That’s a good thing, keep practicing summoning and transfiguring in your own time,” Sirius reminded him.
“How the hell am I supposed to fight the dragon then? You’re making it seem impossible.”
Draco blinked at her, but did as he was told. Blaise would pay later for what he had said that he was sure of.
“Only tea today,” He muttered and she looked at him in confusion as he pulled away. Across from him Blaise was biting into ham and cheese croissant, still half asleep.
He could definitely get used to this.
Draco was having difficulty even keeping a straight face and keeping up the charade with Weasley. Why wasn’t Harry saying anything? Why did it still feel like he wasn’t even in the same room as him? All Draco could feel was that weird cut off exhausted feeling. Even when Harry was sleeping, he normally expressed some emotions, this wasn’t that feeling. Draco was barely keeping the panic from completely taking over. He was glad he had concocted a lie having to do with his ribs, because his breathing was coming out in harsh gasps.
“At least we aren’t freezing our arses off this time,” Draco commented as Fleur disappeared into the hedges.
Draco would never admit to anyone here at Hogwarts that he had always desperately wanted a pet dragon. He had begged his father for one of course, but had obviously never been given one. He had even tried to explain to his parents that they had plenty of space at the Manor for a dragon and he would train it and take care of it.
Hermione glared at him immediately, "Yes because I knew you'd act like this! Now keep your voice down!"
It seemed Fudge was at his limit, he pulled a bag from his pocket and tossed it at the foot of Harry’s bed through the gap in the curtains Draco had left, narrowly missing Sirius. “Potter’s winnings, I have business to attend to, please excuse me.”
“Oi, Longbottom, are you done?” Malfoy asked, striding towards him.
Draco stood and up and grinned at Theo, “After what you did last night, consider us even.”
“You don’t have to be jealous of anyone, ever,” Harry assured him.
“What are you referring to as Barty Crouch being delusional?” Dumbledore countered.
Draco’s smile came back. “That’s great! I think it’s a brilliant plan! It’s about time an adult paid you some attention and worried about your well-being.”
“Get going, and stop worrying about me. I will be fine,” Draco assured her, the lie seeming to fall easily from his lips. Hermione realized she wasn’t going to get through to Draco right now, he was too distracted. She also didn’t want to risk making him late, so she frowned at him before nodding and leaving their meeting spot. She caught up to her study group and easily slipped into their conversation, forcing herself not to cast a glance backward.
“Oi, Fred, George, stop it! You’re shoving me!” Ron complained pushing back at the twins as they jostled him. This was the absolute wrong thing to do as they pushed back at Ron, harder.
Harry frowned, “Er… Yes?”
“Thanks, Weasley,” Pansy responded.
“Harry, I –“Draco broke off, he had no idea what to say. The anger that had surged through him the entire day had disappeared. He had always assumed Dumbledore had helped Harry through first and second year. He knew Harry and his friends always got into shit, but had thought it was just them being nosy and in the end, Dumbledore put a stop to it all. Harry had only been 11 and 12-years-old when he did that shit.
Harry awoke to loud crashes and assumed the fireworks had picked back up again. He carefully unstuck his shirt from his skin where his sweat had plastered it to his body. This soul-mark was already more trouble than it was worth, it was boiling and he couldn’t even go shirtless.
“Nah, green’s just my colour,” Seamus laughed and the bright colours of his soul mark glinted from his throat. Various shades of blue coalesced into a crashing wave. Opposite him, in the same exact location, Dean had swirls of flames, shades of red and orange that still stuck out in clear contrast to his dark skin. “You best be buying your souvenirs and getting back, everyone is going to start making their way to their seats soon I’d expect.”
Harry brightened, those were questions he knew the answers to, “We were only a few minutes in, but on the very far side of the grounds. I couldn’t see the castle or the lake anymore. They were all just about as tall as the trees.”
“I know it seems fucked right now, but it’ll be okay.”
“How do you know that Potter isn’t in the maze? How are you positive?”
“Draco, are you still in here brewing?” Pansy called, confusion suddenly painting her face. “Why do you look like the Dark Lord just walked in?”
It was another tense few minutes of Pomfrey moving her wand and muttering spells so quickly he couldn’t keep track, before finally she exhaled a breath and stopped casting. Harry had steadily felt the pain in his chest abating and it was at a minor throbbing now, he also noticed his hand no longer felt submerged in fire. Touching Draco’s mark had returned to how it normally felt, comforting warmth.
“Come on,” Harry scoffed. “I know I’ve got glasses, but I’m not blind.”
Draco cleared his throat, turning back towards his potion in an effort to buy some time to school his features, “You surprised me is all, I do hate it when I am interrupted.” He forced as much annoyance and indignation into his voice as he could muster. His heart rate was beginning to slow down.
He turned around at the sound of his name and smiled at Hermione as she ducked out of the tent. Her hair was pulled back into a neat plait and her dark skin almost glowed in the bright summer sun.
He made his way through the stacks, looking for a specific potions book. He turned down an aisle and saw Longbottom paging through a tome. Draco peeked at the title and figured it could be useful.
“Wait, did you call his phoenix a bird?” Draco asked and Harry burst out laughing.
“You all coming to breakfast?” He asked and they scrambled to follow him. Definitely eager to see reactions. They met Pansy in the Common Room. Her eyes bulged at the sight of him.
“Angry,” Draco commented as he rifled through his stores.
Harry irritably shook his hair out of his eyes, “I mean at the end yeah, but it was this like all over my body intense pain thing before that.”
Harry sighed deeply, but got to his feet “I’ll write you before bed.”
Harry was silent until slowly the fizzles died out in his left hand, his right hand having extinguished the second they made contact with Draco’s mark, and buried his head against Draco’s neck his glasses awkwardly digging into the skin there. Draco hesitantly reached up and buried his fingers in Harry’s hair, stroking it slightly, resolutely ignoring the wetness he felt accumulating on his shoulder.
Draco was sure there would be a lot of talk of Cedric at the Feast, and he wasn’t even allowed to sit with Harry. At least now he could check on and stare at him openly.
He couldn’t burst in, but he absolutely had to get to Harry. He couldn’t stand there or wait until morning. Madam Pomfrey knew about them and would obviously not say anything. Who else would be bedside? Dumbledore and possibly McGonagall. Dumbledore most likely already knew about them, being Harry’s magical guardian (or who Draco supposed was Harry’s magical guardian), but McGonagall might not. She hadn’t let on in class that he was bonded to Harry at all, but that didn’t necessarily mean anything.
Harry’s head snapped up and he stared incredulously at Draco. “You and Hermione, and I guess Dumbledore, might be the only ones in the school who believe me.”
“Don’t ask questions, just go! Harry, and Hermione you especially!”
“I’m going to hold you to that,” Harry smirked. Harry hated the sad look Draco had in his eyes; this was the one of the first real times that Harry had ever felt the loss of having to hide their bond from the world. All he wanted to do was march into the Yule Ball with Draco on his arm. The more he saw Draco and Parkinson together in the hallways, the more he just wanted to wrap Draco up in his arms and show off who actually leaves the love bites on Draco’s neck. Harry reached up and ran his fingers across the moon on Draco’s chest. Draco sighed at the contact before mimicking Harry’s movement.
“Are you hungry?” Draco asked, as his stomach gave a grumble. The noise was thankfully able to bring a smirk to Harry’s face.
Please accept my unending apologies for how late this update is! Life has been insane with the holidays and such. I have the next few chapters written now so updates will be much more on schedule but hang in there with me for Christmas, it's gonna be busy here. Thank you all times a million for sticking with me and supporting me. Love you tons!!
Harry sighed, “That’s like if I judged all wizards on the actions of, like, Voldemort, or something.”
Pansy laughed at the two of them, rolling her eyes, but Draco could see how pleased she was underneath it all.
“I did, I had to send about a million and a half letters out to put a stop to that awful Skeeter woman.”
“The Gryffindors are cleaning up well tonight,” Pansy commented and Draco had to agree. “Who knew Potter looked so good in green.”
Draco pulled away slightly, sighing softly, his eyes closing for a moment. Harry could feel an overwhelming swirl of emotions flowing through.
“What, what’s so funny?” Hermione asked.
Happy Thursday!!
It didn’t take long until suddenly half of the Slytherin house was exploding into various human-sized canaries. Draco watched as Blaise exploded in feathers, but instead of the customary yellow that the rest of the house were sporting, his were a wonderful rainbow of colours. Draco hadn’t said what Blaise did to piss him off, but the colours were perfectly fitting. Draco assumed the colours were simply so he stuck out the hardest.
“You’re absolutely freezing,” Hermione commented for lack of anything else to say. Already her legs were numb and she had only been next to him for a few moments. She drew her wand and melted the nearby snow, carefully drying Draco’s clothes once that was done. She needed to get his body temperature back up.  Lastly, she cast a Warming Charm and hoped it was enough. His shivers seemed to be subsiding, which was either very good or very bad. His focus seemed to be returning as well, so she was leaning towards the former. She needed to do something about the wound on his face. It was bleeding a lot, but head wounds always did. Hermione momentarily cursed herself for her lack of knowledge in healing spells. With the company she kept she really ought to look into at least some simple spells.
Harry wasn’t known as a Quidditch prodigy for nothing, he operated his broom like an extension of himself. Draco could feel nothing but elation and adrenaline flowing through the bond. Draco hadn’t realized how desperately Harry had missed being on a broom, if the fact that facing a mother dragon was barely a blip on his radar after being able to mount his broom.
Also for all you Brits out there, I truly hope I'm doing okay with my masquerade as someone who actually lives in Britain. I am regrettably, American, just trying to sound British in my writing. Feel free to let me know if I make any glaring errors. I welcome Brit-picking. Although I have definitely read some Hunger Games fics written by British people and the errors never really bother me so maybe I'm being overly self-conscious. It's been known to happen.
“Once upon a time there was a woman I loved, and I made some stupid choices. Dumbledore decided to utilize my position close to the Dark Lord for his own gain. I would not wish this position on anyone, but most specifically my godson. The Dark Lord is smart, smarter than anyone gives him credit for. He would see through your ruse in a moment. He checks for soul-mates. It would bring the Dark Lord nothing but joy to have the opportunity to use you to harm Potter. He will make it painful and he would drag it out until Potter came for you. Do you understand what I am saying?”
"Er, Harry, you're looking loads better," Weasley attempted and Draco couldn't keep a snort from escaping him.
Harry scoffed, “No, I didn’t. But I honestly don’t know how long I can not get changed in front of Ron before he starts to get suspicious.”
“Fuck, Potter, come on. Look at me,” A deep familiar voice commanded. Harry blinked trying to focus on the dark outline in front of him, his eyes ached. His whole body hurt. “Shit your glasses, hold on,
Almost immediately the floor was covered in grime, but Harry was looking remarkably better.
“Are we seriously going to be staring at the water?” The stands all faced the water but nothing would there to project what was happening like at the World Cup. “This is such a fucking joke.”
"You're barely keeping your eyes open, go on, we'll all be here when you've gotten some rest."
“No, it’s a Slytherin. Blaise Zabini, if you’re familiar.”
"That was brilliant!" Ron burst. "Malfoy the incredible bouncing ferret!"
“That oaf, Hagrid, was chatting my ear off; I was worried he would report me for being out on the grounds, so I had to let him.” Theo was glad Pansy seemed to have caught on.
Suddenly it was like Draco’s forehead was splitting in two. Draco clutched at his head, biting down hard on his lip to keep from screaming or vomiting from the pain. As suddenly as the pain started it stopped, there was a moment of relief before overwhelming disbelief and despair shot through and Draco forced himself to his feet.
Alexis
Harry drew a small angry face, and he felt joy flow through the bond and figured Draco was laughing in person.
“Don’t heal it,” Draco said. “I want everyone to see what Lucius Malfoy does to his son.”
“Luna!” Ginny gasped, staring down at their enclosed hands before looking wildly back up at her. “Did we just bond?”
“No it’s fine, it just makes me question whose idea it was to stick you with muggles. I understand family, but this is ridiculous.”
Harry stared at him, his green eyes stark against his dark skin and hair, they were both silent.
"Sure I have, what Quidditch player hasn’t? Now is the potion good enough or not?" He turned toward the cauldron, the liquid now a dark green.
Harry closed his book at the sight of Draco’s tiny heart figure. Harry quickly got dressed before making his way to the Common Room.
“I see.”
Pansy rolled her eyes fondly, “I love you too, I’m just happy to finally see you happy.”
The last thing he needed was more drama in his life, especially from his best mate.
“She’s absolutely beside herself that she can’t host one this year,” Draco’s eyes focused over Millie’s shoulder where Harry was now dancing with Hermione. She was laughing and looked like she was having the time of her life. Draco was happy Harry was stepping out of his shell and letting himself have a good time.
“Obviously I’ve known about this for what seems like forever, but it’s even more surreal to see it with my own eyes.”
“Apparently his father did that to him yesterday in Hogsmeade.”
to contain the blast.
Draco had hoped the Second Task would be simpler and less anxiety inducing, but feeling what Harry was going through but not knowing what was happening was worse.
Harry’s eyes were glued to Draco’s, “Er, I wanted you to know that?”
“How long does Potter normally make you wait before he shows up?” She asked, charming a chair to be more her style and more cushioned.
Love,
“Awh Dray,” Pansy giggled turning to wrap her arms around his neck. “Careful there or we might have to leave the Common Room.” She teased and Draco tried to look appropriately chastised. Ignoring her use of that terrible nickname.
“Perhaps Draco isn’t as far under Daddy’s thumb as Lucius thinks.”
“I hate feeling like I’m forcing you to tell me things, Harry, but you have me worried. Between this and the Tournament, I can’t take much more.”
“Moody, check the maze,” He commanded and Moody thudded away. Dumbledore crossed the space and was muttering things to the other professors. The minute stretched by and Draco grew agitated.
“I know you don’t love what you’re learning, but right now your best chance at survival is going to be running away. You’ve got fast reflexes, but you won’t be able to out duel a Dark wizard whose only intent is to harm you.”
“Draco and I can tell when the other is touching their Mark. It’s more intense when you touch the other person’s. I don’t know how it will work for the three of you though.”
I know many of you hoped Cedric would live, and I really really wish I could have kept him alive. Unfortunately, Cedric's death really signaled the beginning of the loss of innocence for these characters. The seriousness of this War. I figured yall would rather I keep Cedric's death the same, and not have to kill of someone else closer to our characters to have the same effect. Also we're beginning to stray from canon, but we arent quite far enough to have a plausible reason for Cedric not to die other than my personal preference.
“You don’t have to talk about it if you don’t want to,” Draco assured quickly.
“He tried to summon something I think,” Pansy said, staring at Harry quizzically. Finally, Draco could hear a faint whistling, and Harry’s broom soared into sight. Unfortunately the sound and movement also caught the dragon’s attention, she whipped towards Harry, but he took a running start and leaped onto his broom, zooming into the air. Draco finally sighed out quietly in relief as the crowd erupted into ear-splitting cheers, almost drowned out by the roaring of the dragon and the stream of fire she exhaled at Harry.
“This wasn’t exactly how I imagined spending the night next to you would be, but I’ll take what I can get, I suppose. Beggars can’t be choosers.” Harry felt Draco bury his face in his chest for a moment, and heard him inhale deeply a couple times.
“Are you all right?” Pansy asked as he cast the spells that would unlock the room.
“Oh, er, thanks,” Harry said, and Draco detected a blush crossing his cheeks. “What was so urgent? Are you all right?”
“I know,” Draco agreed. “If you wish I could come back with your Cloak, I’m sure Hermione would get it for me.”
Draco nodded, distractedly pulling on the clothes, too tired to even spell them on, “How long have you known?”
“Of course he is, probably to lecture me about my last potion. Someone here got me distracted,” Draco tickled Pansy in an effort to keep his hands from fidgeting. He stood up slowly, carefully sliding Pansy off of his lap. “I ought to go now so he doesn’t make a scene tomorrow.”
Draco recognized the formal wording to her acceptance and breathed a sigh of relief. She was matriarch of the Weasley family and a Pureblood herself, so her words were binding. Draco could not be held to the wrongs Lucius had committed toward Mr. Weasley or anyone else in their family.
"It needs to simmer for 15 more minutes and then it’ll be ready. You fret more than my mother."
Yall have absolutely floored me with your reactions! Thank you to the end of the universe and back for every view, kudos, subscription, bookmark, and comment! It seriously makes my entire day!
Draco pulled away, scrubbing at his face and running his fingers through his hair. “I really don’t think it would have been. They used the Cruciatus.” He took a few steps towards his bed, pulling out a fresh change of clothes. “There were three?”
“What? Why do you ask?”
“That still doesn’t solve the problem of me being able to do anything but swim the surface of the Lake. And I don’t really love the idea of losing a best mate because I failed to get them back from a tribe of merpeople!”
“Of course he is, probably to lecture me about my last potion. Someone here got me distracted,” Draco pinched Pansy’s side and carefully slid her off of his lap. “I ought to go now so he doesn’t make a scene tomorrow.”
“Ron, there isn’t just straight and gay. It’s a spectrum. There’s a whole myriad of sexualities, and you’re the bad guy because you’re ruining a very special moment with asinine questions about her sexuality! I just can’t believe Luna knew it was going to happen. Maybe Ginny was mistaken that they’ve touched skin to skin since Ginny turned 13. It’s always the first time after you turn 13.”
“Did you find them?” Luna asked.
“You watch your best mate get beaten to shit by some stone chess piece and no one comes! Or you stare at the man who murdered your parents coming out of the back of your fucking professor’s head, and then he’s trying to choke you to death and you feel like your skin is melting off as you press your hands anywhere you can to get him to stop, you feel yourself suffocating and no one comes!
Alexis
Draco set his face against Harry’s chest, carding his fingers through his soul-mate’s hair as he wept. The warmth from his Mark was comforting but Draco couldn’t get over the lack of feeling Harry’s emotions. It was like he had lost a part of himself that he hadn’t known he would miss. He had always assumed that he would know when Harry was in trouble due to their bond. That he would be able to swoop in and save the day for once. The reality was that Draco had no idea what he even would have done if he had known what Harry was going through. He had heard the tales of what Harry had down their first and second year, and he always imagined that it was so easy. That the right ideas would just line up in front of you.
So I meant to post this the other day but decided to completely rewrite the whole thing. I've felt like the last couple chapters haven't been up to my standards. They haven't felt like me. I rewrote this chapter and now I finally feel like my writing is back to normal. I sincerely hope you enjoy this one, and it's long. The original was almost 1k shorter but I'm so happy with where the words led me.
He heard Malfoy calling after him, and indignation filtering through the bond, but he threw the cloak over himself and hurried back towards Gryffindor tower. A permanent smile plastered on his face.
“You snog on the regular, I’m sure Potter wouldn’t mind.”
“Just keep an eye on my conjugations in the second paragraph, I’m not incredibly confident,” Draco warned and she nodded.
“I assure you I am, there’s no lasting damage. My fore arm has been twinging and my forehead, but you had to have known that. You’re feeling the pain currently!” Draco defended himself.
I hope you enjoyed this chapter, sorry it was kind of a filler. I wanted to devote some time to Draco learning about the map. Also I love the headcanon that Snape is Draco's godfather, so I hope you all are cool with that. A million hugs and highfives for the reaction to this. We're almost at 10k hits!! Love you guys! See you Monday, have a great weekend!
“What even are these Marks? At least yours make sense!”
Harry finally spoke, the emotions inside of him a vicious whirl, “I didn’t grow up in a home like yours. Obviously not in size or whatever, but other stuff too. I live with my aunt, uncle, and cousin, but they hate me. They think magic is unnatural, that I’m a freak. I didn’t even know I was a wizard until my 11th birthday when Hagrid broke into the shack my Uncle had dragged us to to avoid the owls with my letter, and told me so. I grew up thinking my parents died in a car crash. That my father had been drinking. They hate anything that’s out of the ordinary. We live in a two floor house with three bedrooms in it, which looks exactly like every other house on the street. I lived in the cupboard under the stairs until I got my letter. Then they gave me Dudley’s second bedroom. Mostly because I think they were worried I would blow them up if they didn’t.
Reading it was for another time, perhaps never.
"Draco your hair is leaving a puddle," Hermione commented and Draco looked down to confirm her observation.
Draco felt a warmth spread across his mark and returned the touch.
“You better be nice, I’ll be extremely cross if you make him upset,” Draco warned as they left the room.
“Something else has been bothering you. I’ve felt it the past few days and thought it was the Task, but it’s something else isn’t it?”
“Yeah, a bit. I supposed I don’t have to ask you. Come to think of it, I’m surprised Ron hasn’t woken up yet. His stomach pretty much rules his schedule.”
“I left him with Padma, it won’t last long though. I wasn’t able to hide the pain very well. I played it off as a bad headache, rubbed my scar a bit.”
Draco went straight to the Common Room from the Hospital Wing. He had a best mate to confront.
Aren't they adorable?? Next chapter contains my favorite quote from the story so far, I cannot wait for yall to read it. Also a bonding happens! Are Draco and Harry forgetting something? It feels like they're forgetting something...
The presence lingered, rooting through his memories and his magic. Finally, with a snap the study was around him once more. The wards and lines disappeared, but he felt as though he was being bathed in the same light that had spread out around him. Draco grasped his wand and golden sparks flew out of the tip at his touch. Draco smirked. He had passed.
Draco stared at him incredulously without saying anything for a few moments, “Yeah, of course. Obviously there aren’t a lot left, they’re sort of hard to hide and hard to explain away to muggles.”
“Nope, apologies, that will not work for me,” Draco said flippantly.
“Yes, and they’re supposed to be taking care of it, but...”
“The man was saying he was doing this because of You-Know-Who, Dumbledore! That doesn’t strike you as delusional? Please see some sense!”
Draco also had to respond to the letters from his parents. He hadn’t even opened them yet, and had made Hercules stay in the Owlery instead of returning to the Manor as he often did when Draco did not write back right away. Draco sure had a lot of things to figure out in a short amount of time.
“Yes, we did,” Luna said still smiling and seeming not at all surprised about what had just happened.
He finished unwrapping his gifts and made an excuse to close the hangings on his bed in order to write a letter to his parents to thank them for his presents and wish them a Merry Christmas. Draco pulled out the twin journal to Harry’s and opened it. Nothing had been written yet, but Draco normally woke up quite early on Christmas and wouldn’t be surprised if Harry was still unwrapping gifts.
Draco bid Pansy and Theo goodbye, hurrying from the Common Room. He finally had time to hole himself up in his lab, and had promises from the two of them not to bother him. He really did have a potion to brew for Severus, but he might have greatly exaggerated the difficulty of the potion in question. Draco got started, hoping to have most of the potion finished before Harry showed up.
“To be fair, Hermione is brilliant and she really struggled with that,” He grinned, and Draco shook his head in annoyance.
Ron nodded seriously, “Yeah. That’s a lot.”
Pansy gasped, staring at his chest. “Oh, Draco,” her lip jutted out in a pout. “I’m so sorry.”
“Yeah, I’m fine, felt like a Blasting Curse,” Harry said, accepting Longbottom’s hand as he helped him to his feet, rubbing his ribs as he did. Draco wished he could do the same. He was struggling to keep his composure.
Hermione’s eyes were wide as saucers, “That’s His mark, Harry!”
Even later on in Potions, normally a class where Draco flourished, he was withdrawn.
“Shut it, Potter, it’s me!” Harry stopped struggling and realized Malfoy was the one holding him behind the tree, his pale hair glinting in the moonlight. “You need to go, get the fuck out of here.”
“So Hagrid is a half-giant? How does that even work?”
"How long until it's ready?" Harry asked as Malfoy finished packing up his things.
Draco stared at him in that way that he often did, like he had extra appendages growing out of him.
“Like you care? Move!” Theo ordered and Draco felt himself being dragged away. Wait no, Harry was the other way, why were they taking Draco away from him? He moved to try and make it back towards Harry and felt a sharp pain in his cheek. His face was extra cold. Why was Harry so tall? Oh, Draco realized he was on the floor. Why was he on the floor?
“Why’s that?” Harry asked, curiosity in his voice.
Harry nodded, but couldn't get the blond out of his head; the sound of him repeatedly hitting the ground echoing in his mind.
Ron’s thoughts were the overarching sentiment of the day. Everywhere he turned were whispers about Draco. Theories as to what could have possibly caused Lucius to give his son a black eye. Some said how they saw Draco and Lucius at the Three Broomsticks and Lucius had been upset over something. Harry overheard Ernie MacMillan speaking in scathing tones as to how a respectful pureblood patriarch could stoop so low.
Draco quickly got ready for bed, excited for Harry to get his gift. Not excited for the Yule Ball the following night. He knew Harry was going to look stunning and he was happy that in the end Harry had found a date in Parvati Patil. Harry had even been able to pick up enough knowledge about formal dancing from the very few lessons Draco had been able to give him in their limited time. Harry was no longer as anxious about the Ball at any rate. Draco was incredibly curious about who Hermione was going to the Ball with, she had been incredibly tight-lipped about it whenever she had joined Draco and Harry in their late-night meet-ups, and Harry had told Draco that she refused to even give a hint of who it could be.
“Harry what are you doing, keep – “Ron cut himself short as he took in the scene between Harry and Malfoy. “What are you on about, Malfoy? Get your hands off of him!”
“What is going on? Who’s doing that?” Harry asked trying to keep up with the group of Weasley’s, who were practically sprinting towards the wooded area next to the campground.
Luna smiled at her briefly before looking back to Ginny, “I did.”
“Anyone who has a problem with our new Slytherin friends and wants to be a dick about it can come speak to us, we would love to have a discussion,” One of the twins called down the table.
“I just feel like Hermione and I are kind of growing up and leaving him behind a little, at least relationship wise. It doesn’t help that he’s gone for Hermione and won’t even say anything. At least he’s being respectful. I definitely thought he would have said some shit about Krum by now.”
Draco didn’t mind that the twins didn’t care about the fallout in the rest of his house. All the less reason for him to be suspected. Draco drew a small sun and hurried his way to breakfast. Draco figured he would rather be hungry than sorry, and only sipped at his tea. After the events over the weekend he knew his housemates wouldn’t comment on his lack of appetite. He assumed the twins were using the filling on the pastries to carry the product, but they had guaranteed Blaise would be pranked, so he was treating every piece of food as if it were contaminated.
“Yes, that bit. Once more, please?” He asked, his lips ghosting up Harry’s neck.
"Can you just…?" Harry trailed off, his voice barely above a whisper, holding his arms up slightly.
Draco started pacing, before whirling around and banishing a chair at the wall, seeming to be calmed slightly by the sound it made when it hit the wall. Harry flinched at the impact. Draco paused from banishing a second chair at Harry’s reaction, his wand still twirling rapidly in his hand.
“Can I see your Mark, please,” Harry begged and Draco tore his shirt open immediately.
“Shit,” Harry whispered to himself. His neck was littered with love bites. They weren’t as prominent as Draco’s normally looked but Harry attributed that to the fairness of Draco’s skin; bruises tended to  stick out in hard contrast. His were still very much visible, and very much apparent of what they were. Harry considered his possibilities. He could ignore Ron and not answer who gave them to him, but he was bound to be interrogated without end until he told him. He could lie and say he fell? No, Harry shook his head, that would never work. “What am I going to do?”
Until finally Draco had been able find what he had been looking for. He had had a shadow of a memory of a bedtime story Mother had told him once. She had been talking about soul-mates, a bedtime favourite for him when he was young, and had talked about how if he found his soul-mate that he would even be able to become a full wizard early and run off with his soul-mate and start his own adventures with them.  Sure enough she had been speaking of a very real, but outdated Pureblood tradition. All he had had to do was have found his soul-mate, and prove to his family’s magical artefact that he was worthy of taking on the duties being heir to the line meant for him, and he was golden. He was officially an adult in the eyes of magic. As far as Draco could tell it hadn’t been used in centuries. Mostly because not many families still had their family’s artefact, or followed the Head of House conduct like the Malfoy’s did. As it was, Lucius barely followed it.
The whole walk back to the tent Harry was in a daze. Had that actually just happened? Was Draco Malfoy his actual soul-mate? He hadn’t even known that soul-mates existed before he came to Hogwarts. He hadn’t even really believed they were real until he watched Dean and Seamus go from friends, to the closest two people could possibly be after realizing their bond late in their second year. It had been a nasty shock to them, but perfectly timed because both of the two of them had been developing a crush on the other but had been terrified to say anything.
“Sure,” Harry stood up and quickly swiped at his fringe, pressing his hair against his forehead.
“Draco we were just heading up to breakfast!” Blaise called as they passed in the hallway.
“I have to dance in front of the entire school, I cannot dance.”
She left the room before Harry could say anything else. Relief flooded his body and he set his head down onto where he had his hand plastered to Draco’s mark.
“What does that even mean? You still have two years until you’re a legal adult,” Hermione asked and Draco realized this must have been bugging her ever since Mrs. Weasley had spoken earlier.
After a few moments of silence punctured by Malfoy’s ragged breathing, he straightened up slightly, not moving away from Harry’s hand. “Is this, er, helping? It’s what Hermione likes when she’s sick...”
*********************
“You overcome these massive obstacles and act like they’re as simple as mounting a broom!”
Draco looked up at the two of them before his eyes glued to Harry, “I’m okay.” His voice barely carrying to where she stood. He had successfully cleaned most of the blood off of his face, but his cheek was an angry red. It was already swelling badly despite Hermione’s makeshift ice pack.
“Ron, do you remember? We talked about this! Do you remember what you said about your soul-mate?”
Draco woke up to the sounds of his housemates screaming ‘Merry Christmas’ at him through the curtains, and ripping paper echoing around the room. Draco rubbed the sleep from his eyes, smiling at the modest pile of gifts at the foot of his bed. Draco touched his mark to send Harry a ‘Merry Christmas’ before buttoning up his shirt and opening the hangings on his bed.
Malfoy chuckled then shrugged, “You’re right about that. Nothing to thank me for, I couldn’t go the rest of the night feeling like that, could I?”
“What?” Draco responded, doing his best not to look over at the Gryffindor table.
“Thanks,” Harry said a moment later, his throat and mouth no longer feeling like he had spent days in the desert without a drink.
He scrambled towards where he knew the Gryffindor Common Room was. He knew he couldn’t get in or wait for Harry there, but he could be close. Draco went to an empty classroom, shut the door, and promptly let himself have a tiny breakdown. Draco was almost overwhelmed by Harry’s emotions, loud and clear despite the distance between them. Draco knew without a shadow of a doubt that Harry had not done this to himself.
“Hey, stop, none of that,” Harry chastised. Draco still didn’t drop the block and Harry frowned more deeply. “Please?” He asked weakly. Harry drug his thumb across Draco’s unhurt cheek.
Poppy closed the curtains behind her, leaving the two boys some privacy. She bit the inside of her cheek. The way Draco Malfoy insisted upon such formality ensured she couldn’t take the image of his father from her brain. At times she had to remind herself who she was facing. That she was facing a 14 year old child, not the father he looked so similar to. Whom he at times acted so similar to. One thing was for certain, she had never heard Lucius Malfoy cry the way she could hear Draco weeping right now. He was being eerily quiet, something Poppy was sure he learned how to do at some point during his lifetime. Especially after hearing the almost idle comment that revealed Draco had been on the receiving end of a Cruciatus curse, probably at more than one instance. Her mind briefly flashed to the black eye she had seen Draco sporting just a few months ago.
Draco grasped the dagger and sliced the palm of his wand arm, he let blood flow from his hand and off the dagger into the goblet.
