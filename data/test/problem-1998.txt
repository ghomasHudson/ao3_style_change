"Uh uh." Ginny shook her head and pointed at Harry with her fork. "No, I know how you get on a case, and I'm aware that this case has been harder than most. This isn't that. So, instead of lying about it or being vague....why don't you just talk to me?"
Harry sighed. “I get it, I get it. Have you moved on to the next safe-house, yet?”
Harry nodded. “This is all very weird, Hermione.”
“I’ll help you, of course,” said a quiet and friendly voice. It was hard to make any determinations about age or gender.
"What are you so worried about?" Ginny asked -- her voice was kind though, her eyes searching.
“I’ll need to pick up a few crystals and a particular oil, but, yes,” Draco agreed.
“Did Charlie and his friend get back okay?”
Theodore turned to the assembled group.
Harry began to reply but, before he could, Draco disappeared.
Alice is Neville and George's daughter. (Yes, Mpreg, because MAGIC). She's Lily's same age and named after Neville's mum. They also have Fred (eldest) and Roxanne (middle).
"Who do you think will be teaching Defense?" Hermione asked. "There's no way Professor Snape will be back for it."
Sally-Anne and Ginny and Felix were also Prefects. He didn’t recognize the fifth-year Prefects. It made sense -- Harry hadn’t really gotten to know many of the younger-years in years past. Aside from Dumbledore’s Army, he wasn’t well exposed to the students not in his year.
“Oh, Harry,” Charlie said softly. “We’re sorry. Really, we are.”
Once the tea was ready, they sat at the kitchen table.
She waved that away.
He didn’t have to wait too long. Sure enough, Draco came towards him, still holding the bagged vial.
"Well of course he doesn't owe me anything!" Harry pushed away from the table and stood. "I don't....I don't know if I'm strong enough to face the part where he doesn't understand or feels threatened or something."
Draco frowned. “I’m not sure I’m following.”
The case board was already laid out and the members of their team were ready and waiting. Evidence bags, though there were few, were laid out on a table that was pushed against the wall. At the back of the room was a strip of counter with a sink, electric kettle and a coffee pot. There was a cold-cupboard at one end as well. The smell of freshly brewed coffee filled the room.
Lily is about to turn 6 (B: December 27th 2007).
“Don’t let him think that, as it isn’t the truth,” the reflection said. “You need to confess this, your biggest secret, or the price that I will demand will be higher than you want to pay. This is the thing that keeps you up at night. This is the thing that keeps you from moving on with your life. And you better say it before I do. I won’t be kind.”
"Right, ready to take over, Captains?" she asked Draco, who nodded. She left quickly after that.
Harry bounded down the stairs, anxious to get to Draco’s. As he rounded the corner into the living room he stopped to smile at the scene in front of him.
“Mistress Longbottom has the West wing of the manor and Master Neville has the East wing of the manor, from the second floor and up. You’ll find the dining room on the ground floor, when you have need of it.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Neville sighed. “There’s no real option for teams this year anyway. Everything’s different. It’d be impossible.”
“My grandson has the East wing. You’ll find him on the fourth floor, fourth door on your right. Have a care, the stairs are a mountain,” she said before she moved swiftly through an archway on the left and out of sight.
“And the Head of House?”
“So, you’ve come to explain?” Harry said as he led her into his room and shut and locked the door.
“Probably. Right? I guess my gran is going to be here too, to teach a class and provide security back-up, but she won’t live in the castle.”
was a magic-only world that was extremely difficult to access and even harder to be accepted into. As part of the astral plane, there were only two ways to get to it -- portal or astral projection. The latter was difficult for most wixen to master, the former expensive and a powerful bit of magic to maintain.
“We’ll be fine, Harry my love,” Andromeda replied.
Harry raised an eyebrow at Delphinium. “Well?”
Hermione smiled. “I know. Don’t worry. You’ll have some friends in your new house and you might even like it.”
“The ritual isn’t a common one. In fact, it’s so rare that it has to be registered with the Ministry to even be performed. It isn’t easy to do it illegally and, if you manage to carry it out illegally, it’s easy to track,” Draco explained.
"I'm not gonna move or make fun of you, so go ahead," he decided to add to his previous words.
"Or maybe he doesn't…" Draco continued. "Not that much of a surprise, I must say."
He suddenly wondered what Malfoy's parents would think if they were to find out what their son was doing with him. Though he didn't really know how to label them. While he mentioned to the both of them being friends, he knew that this was not a thing he would do with Ron - and he had been friends for a long time with that guy. Harry decided to leave that topic for now as the other boy shifted once again.
To say Hermione was just surprised was an understatement. When she returned with her book, both Ron and Harry had been gone. She had groaned in frustration, cuz why couldn't they just stay put. However, after Ron came back she started to worry. Ron, on the other hand, was quite relaxed about it, as if their friend would just appear out of nowhere. Hermione looked at the blonde, eyebrow arched up. Ron stood behind her, glaring at the Slytherin. "And why would we believe you, Malfoy?" she bitterly asked. As if Harry would let Malfoy help him, especially when there were more suitable people Harry could have asked.
"What is going on here? You? Returning my feelings?"
His mouth felt dry and his voice was hoarse, did he snore? Hmm, he never knew he did or heard Ron complain about it.
Malfoy scoffed at this. "I haven't-"
Obviously, he wanted to return here with the other.
He looked away again, thinking about something.
He wanted more of that intensity, he needed more.
With a cough, Harry held his hand out towards the other. "You hand me the list, then we'll just add them to this one on the spot." Harry wasn't sure if he didn't know how to behave because of the group and the conversation or just because of the presence of the blonde in front of him. Surely, it could be because of both of those two reasons. He had tried to keep the other off his mind after he left the hospital wing, yet that was hard to do with the real thing standing right in front of him.
The last few days he couldn't sleep all that well and he hadn't quite figured out yet why that was. Although the idea was nice enough, he was pretty sure Malfoy would be desperate to keep his reputation up and would start their usual routine back up tomorrow. With a sigh, he rubbed his eyes. He should head towards the Gryffindor dorm. He could use some more rest.
Harry didn't really appreciate the tone of how the blonde spoke to him, but he guessed it could be worse. It was quite weird how he had the blonde help him instead of Hermione, though. But, what freaked him out more was that he finally understood what this stuff was all about. Draco explained it in such a natural way that it just clicked. Oh gosh, why didn't he have a Hermione who could just repeat this the same way?
It was then that he finally realized why Potter affected him so much. Why he wouldn't leave his mind, and why he'd suddenly become so attractive. Draco felt the urge to laugh because of how ridiculous it was. How stupidly obnoxious he'd been. He was in love with Potter and there was nothing he could do about it.
Once he entered the great hall, he noticed that she was not there. Neither at the Ravenclaw table nor the Gryffindor, he even checked Hufflepuff and Slytherin. With a snort, Harry looked around. Neville wasn't here as well. Where would that girl even go to around this time? He doubted if she was in the library but decided to just take a look - where, as suspected, the blonde wasn't hanging out as well.
Harry almost dropped his cup as the other spoke. When he realized who it was, standing at the side of his bed with an angry glare his eyes widened. "You. This is not what it looks like." Well, it was. Obviously. He had gotten himself in the hospital wing after he had just left the room after promising to take better care of himself.
"Maybe we should just find some of your housemates and ask them personally instead," he grinned. In return, Luna smiled and agreed as they, once again, returned to the great hall.
"I'm sorry," he said, resting his forehead against that of the Slytherin that was obviously overwhelmed by his emotions. "I should have just kept my bloody mouth shut. Ofcourse they care, they're your parents."
"I see…" He spoke softly, not adding anything to it, but leaving space for Potter to continue if he wanted to.
"May I kiss you?" Harry mumbled, lips already inching closer to fill the last bit of space between the two of them.
The reason why Draco even acknowledged Granger to be a living being, was because she was a top student. This meant they were often competing for the highest grade, and Gryffindors were bloody competitive. Slytherins were too. A combination made in hell meant to clash from time to time. Malfoy, for the first time in forever, let Potter do his work without interrupting. This was mainly because he'd have to explain it again if the essay turned out to be crap. Besides, the silence wasn't uncomfortable.
Disclaimer:
"Could we talk to your friends now? I'd rather get it over with as soon as possible," he resumed, calmly looking at the other. Had he actually messed his hair up even more? How was that possible, and how didn't it look as hideous as it should?
"I'll read this later. For now, I expect you to hand in your next assignments at the same time the other students do mister Potter. Else you'll be writing more like these," he lifted the assignment in his hand to indicate the load of work he was referring to, "As well as that I'll put you in detention. Is that clear?"
He sighed and rolled over, staring at the ceiling while rubbing a hand over his face. It was no use continuing like this, it didn't work.
"We are leaving."
"I don't intend to be likable towards you, I thought you'd know that by now." Again, he ignored Potter's remark, but his posture had become a bit tense. Affronted, Harry stopped writing altogether and put his things down. "You know, Malfoy. There's a brief moment when you first wake up, where you have no memories. A blissful blank slate, a happy emptiness," Harry almost enunciated. "Whenever I see your face, I wish I could just stay in that moment." With that, he picked the feather back up and continued taking down his notes.
"And I suppose everyone can inform each other?" Draco looked around the group of students surrounding them. "If a Hufflepuff would be so kind to inform their house, and if a Ravenclaw would do the same, we could just make a list of who's willing to do what. Then all we need is a date and time." He wanted this settled now, not later. Otherwise, they would keep running around in circles and getting nowhere.
Harry was surprised by how determined Malfoy was to make sure he got himself checked, might as well say he felt flattered. Still dizzy, he sometimes lost footing and had to rely on the blonde catching him. It made him feel quite weird to be so vulnerable around the boy who had been so cold towards him, who he was so-called enemies with. Harry realized too late they had left the library together without any notice to his friends.
Taking a deep breath he slowly nodded. "I'm not sure if I'm entirely convinced yet, though I do believe you have spoken genuinely. I… No, both Hermione and I, will give you a chance. But, if you do anything to prove me wrong or hurt Harry, I will make sure you'll regret it."
Draco gave him a confused look, not sure what to do with his words. He knew Harry often talked without giving others the right context, he'd noticed that ages ago, but this didn't help the situation he was in now. How should he even respond to this?
The blonde came to his bed and took hold of the vial on the little table next to his bed. Harry looked at him for a moment, unsure of what to do for a solid five seconds before he accepted the help of the boy to drink the weird substance. Draco had expected him to just take it from him and drink it, but this didn't happen. It seemed like he'd have to feed it to him. He reluctantly brought the conical flask closer to the other's lips, eyeing him to get some assurance that this was the right thing to do. All he got was a glassy stare, but that would have to do for now. He tilted the flask and hoped Harry was conscious enough to know how to swallow the liquid.
Things had to go a certain way. No one could act out all of their whims and wishes, no one could satisfy all of their cravings. And oh, oh how much did Malfoy crave at that moment. Indecent things he would never say out loud, nor dare to think about for too long.
Draco stopped talking, breathing steadily and slowly to remain as calm as possible. The silence was pressing and his emotions were beginning to become a real bother. If only they knew how guilty he felt, but how hard it was to express this. How difficult it was for him to apologize and face everything he'd done. What was he thinking, trying to talk to the people he'd called a mudblood, or other filthy names? How could he possibly excuse his terrible behavior?
Harry hugged himself as puffs of warm air left his mouth. It was cold, yet he was glad it seemed to cool his cheeks and the further heat of his body down.
"You wish, but unfortunately for you, I'm not." the blonde replied, still not getting up, and actually looking pretty comfortable. Harry's eye twitched. That guy was infuriating. "Well, good luck down there." He turned around on his heel, robe flying after him, as he continued on his track.
A shrug came from the other as he grabbed the blanket to roll up. "I don't know."
"You're crushing?" He blurted out, instantly regretting it. He was acting like Potter now, impulsive and without thought. Well this time, rather because of a thought. He never acted like this, was Potter's behavior contagious? Again, he wondered why he became so uncontrolled in front of this guy. Maybe it was because he'd always been a bit of an uncontrolled prat in front of him, it could just be a habit. Maybe he was so not used to being nice to him, that he didn't know what to do. And Merlin, did it scare him. He tried several times to collect himself, to fall back into a decent posture, but got more and more furious the more he failed. Why in the world wasn't this working, it had to work, he couldn't stand this. After a while of struggling, he finally managed to get at least a bit of himself together. He didn't complain, at least it was something. He cleared his throat and cleared his face of any emotion that had been displayed on it.
"I told you to wear a scarf, Harry," Neville said while handing him a tissue. They had been totally into their snowball fight and his clothes had been drenched due to the wetness. Luna had stayed to slide on the ice and Ron and Hermione had gone off together while Neville had gone to fetch some blankets and hot chocolate for the black-haired guy after setting him off at the hospital wing - Pomfrey wasn't amused by his appearance.
"So," he tilted his head to eye the other. "I had no nightmares tonight." He didn't know why he just stated that why he had not mentioned something like 'yeah so maybe I just have to talk with someone till sleep overpowers me' or whatever.
"I never asked you to stay, Malfoy," he threw back, voice somewhat forming a hiss yet lacking real emotion. "If you didn't want to stay you could have just left, I never forced you to anything. But if this is how you really think then don't stick to me, I get attached to people."
Maybe he could. Maybe the room would keep it safe for him, and return it when he reopened this specific room.
It felt a bit weird. Potter didn't annoy him anymore if he were honest, that hadn't happened for a very long time. But Granger and Weasley on the other hand… They were just as skeptical of him as they'd always been. Potter was actually kind, but they kept provoking him. The only reason Malfoy was holding back on his remarks, was the fact that he wasn't Potter's enemy anymore. This meant he had to leave his friends be as well, and he was decent enough to do that.
It was too quiet. Too peaceful. They should be fighting, not sitting together in peace. It wasn't like them at all… But it was nice, for a change. Kind of. It certainly was a lot less exhausting. "Doesn't Granger help you out with this stuff?" Draco asked. They were chatting anyway, so he just went with it.
Draco could certainly do with a drink, even if Potter decided against it.
Malfoy looked down and let out a short, sniffy laugh. He'd almost forgotten that Pansy did care about him. She just rarely showed it. It was nice to have her tell him this, because he hadn't realized it himself. "Okay, okay fine," he said. "Glad you're happy because I'm happy then."
"Let´s get moving."
That stuck up brat. "And after how you spoke to me about my father, you actually think I would just go ahead and listen to that request?" Draco raised one eyebrow as if Harry had just said something entertaining. "I thought the Gryffindor in you would naturally do the right thing, we'll see what that is. I'm just here because asking you to forget about it is a lot easier than asking a group of people to forget about it. It's a matter of efficiency, I'm not depending on you."
This movement made the Slytherin curl up and utter a shaky moan. His hands slipped up to the other's shoulders out of reflex, making his arms move even more into the sweater and causing it to crawl up even more. How could Potter know his sweet spots without having done this before? Or was it a general thing?
Even though he said that he vaguely pondered about the relationship between the members of the Malfoy household. Maybe he shouldn't have asked, it only seemed to make it worse. Though it might be better for the guy to let it out. Piling your feelings up takes its toll on your body. He let his grip on the guy's face go, looking around for any tissues as he figured crying made people all snotty as well.
He continued talking. "But of course, those plans are off the table now. We haven't got the luxury to think about things like that. And besides, who would marry a Malfoy in this day and age? We're scum now."
"I'm afraid I am, yes," he said, gently smiling down at the other as he touched his face softly to wipe some of his tears away.
Draco let his eyes scan the crowd and soon found a few familiar faces. Pansy, Blaise, and a few others were occupying the cozy green armchairs in their usual corner of the room. They had probably attempted to study but were busy talking when Draco walked up to them.
Somehow, he was kind of glad Potter had walked in. Draco had started to enjoy his presence, and even though it had seemed scary at first, he was glad the other knew about this hobby now. It was good to finally be able to share it with someone who he knew would treat it well. It was very nice. He didn't even feel scared or nervous again, it was actually the opposite now, quite calm and relaxed.
Harry tried not to laugh. "Yes, Master Malfoy," he joked as he took the cup. Somehow he felt in the mood of teasing around the blonde more and more the past few days. before he had always been groaning about the other when he mocked or teased him in that matter of his, but he could quite enjoy their more playful banter now. It might be because he knew it was supposed to be playful or because he just wanted to see the other's behavior positively due to his feelings, yet he didn't bother to figure out which was true. With the plate and their cups placed on top, Harry made his way back to the kitchen, a grin plastered on his face.
However, Draco wasn't going to restrain himself. Looking wasn't enough.
Was that new, or had he just never noticed that before?
"It is not, Parkinson," Malfoy interrupted her, raising his voice a bit. "I've told you what I want you to know, and I'm kindly asking you to drop the matter right now." A sneer began to form on his face, a clear sign of his anger. She just shouldn't have put it like that, she should've kept her distance. He had to admit he was a bit touchy lately, but if Parkinson was so good at reading people, she should've noticed that.
"Being like this, just being nice, I think you know what I mean." Draco was talking about how stupidly difficult his emotions were making his life currently. How difficult it was to ask the other to simply cuddle. Why everything was so tense and nervous and messy. Why they couldn't just have been friends instead of arch enemies since day one. Why Draco had become the bad guy and why Harry had become the hero. And why in the bloody world they weren't supposed to get along.
Yeah. That was right. He had a lot on his mind with all the homework piling up one on another. Worrying about his relationship with Malfoy didn't help. Maybe… Maybe he should just let it rest for a while.
"Well, you see," he stated, "I don't think it's wise to just drink potions for days." Was he going to tell the other that he thought it also had to do with the fact that they'd slept together that night? Would that be okay? He started playing with the rim of his shirt, hesitating about what he should say.
When setting foot back in the hall it felt as if they were returning to the world where time returned to tick forward from a secluded place where it had been put to a stop.
"Harry," Hermione repeated. "How do you feel? Malfoy informed us that you were in the hospital wing, Madame Pomfrey told us it was indeed him who brought you here. Why didn't you tell us?" It started to dawn on him that he had felt extremely dizzy and Draco had helped him to get here. Though that the blonde had gone to fetch Ron and Hermione wasn't part of his memory. He barely knew that he had gone here at all.
"Prick…" Harry muttered under his breath.
"Oh, you are too," Draco said as he let out a short laugh, even though none of this was funny to him at all. He didn't know what would happen now. Would they continue to be friends? Would they be able to? Malfoy really needed to figure himself out, he couldn't leave Potter like this. He couldn't leave him to wonder what Draco thought about all of this, and if he felt the same way. He owed Potter an answer but simply couldn't find one just yet.
"Don't you want anything?" He asked. "You haven't had much to eat, have you?"
"What's it, Harry?" Oh man, there were so many things he wanted to say and ask. Like if he was really that mad.
"Pomfrey might have some though," he seemed to ask it rather as to propose going that way. Well, it might be tricky as he had just left the place and weird as it had been him who had been put in the hospital wing. Harry wondered what Pomfrey was thinking about the two hanging out this much all of a sudden. Then again, Pomfrey hadn't been there when they left and he didn't feel like going through all the stuff there.
The room grew darker, and the castle became quieter. Before he knew it, Draco was starting to doze off as well, due to how comfortable and warm he was. He didn't fight it, and soon enough his head dropped to the side as his breathing got into a slow and steady rhythm.
It took him a few seconds to realize that this wasn't the Malfoy Manor, and house-elves weren't supposed to be seen as 'slaves' anymore.
The Slytherin knew his eyes had started to water, since his vision was getting slightly blurry, but hoped that the other's sweater would hide his emotions once again. Potter didn't need to know about his problems, he just needed to provide comfort. Right now, he was doing this just fine.
Disclaimer:
He practically could see them connect the dots as their mouths slowly fell open and their eyes slightly widened. It was quite funny to see someone come to that 'Ooooooh' conclusion. It didn't take them long to figure out where he had actually gotten stuck and tried their best to patiently explain to him.
The fingers that caressed Malfoy's sides seemed to burn, not much different from the rest of his body.
A yawn escaped the Gryffindor and his eyes felt heavy. "I don't need an answer," he murmured. "I never planned to tell nor for you to return it. Just forget I even said anything." He couldn't go and wipe the other's memories. His one arm was tingling from when it had been wiggled between the bed and Malfoy's frame so he wouldn't have been able to even hold onto his wand normally.
"Make what difficult?" came a whisper.
"Sorry, I didn't think before I spoke," he admitted reluctantly.
"Anyway," he resumed, less confident than before. "That's all I wanted to tell you. If this made you more reluctant to go to the party, I'll take my hands off of it, I don't want it to go to waste because of me."
Draco gasped. "Savage, Potter."
"Hey guys," he said somewhat more hoarse as he wanted. Ron greeting him with his mouth stuffed while Hermione frowned.
"Ah," his eyes fell on the plate. He had simply taken a bite from his toast, that was all.
"Trying might not even be the right way to say it. No failure allowed." He spoke short and quick. He wanted to wrap this up before Pansy would notice they hadn't been swearing at each other yet. "Come on, let's go," He muttered to the girl. Draco had never felt bad after annoying Potter. Not once. But this time, he felt strangely rude to leave just like this. However, he wasn't allowed to think about this too much. It was better to pretend like nothing had happened to their usual rivalry. Surely, everything would be back to normal tomorrow, he thought as he walked down the library.
"Sorry if I made you worry, I just have a lot on my mind that is clashing with each other. Ron is avoiding me as the pest and Hermione stays out of my way as well to please Ron and get us to talk. And…" he paused to switch his gaze towards the ground. "My mood has turned grim because of that as well due my mind being fixec on... someone else. It's all just a mess. My apologies for saddling you up with my problems, I bet you might have enough problems dealing with your own thoughts and businesses."
Pulling back lightly, he brushed the wet stripes going down the other's cheeks away with the back of his hand, shaking his hand after he had done so. "Well, just knowing whether it was something I did or what else caused... this," he wiped another tear away to point out the obvious breakdown of the blond.
It felt nice and warm to stand like this, so when the other brushed his fingers through his hair, Malfoy didn't complain. It felt nice, so why should he? He merely snickered, still slightly shocked from the whole thing.
Malfoy really kept an eye out for him now and though he felt flattered, right now he really didn't want to eat all that much more than what he had already asked for.
Malfoy nodded. "You should talk with the Slytherins about the decorations, trust me they'll know what to do. Team them up with Ravenclaws and you've got quite a powerful combo. As for the food, can't we take another trip to the kitchens and see what they can do? Or maybe send some Hufflepuffs, their common room is right next to it so I'd suppose they have some connections…"
There was a silence in which Harry was processing everything the other had just said before his eyes slowly widened, even more tears falling down.
The girl returned his irritated look with a cold one as she leaned back. "As you wish, Malfoy." And with this, their conversation was over. Draco got up, gathered his stuff and decided to make his homework in the dormitories, his bed was big enough to fit some books on it. It was also able to give some privacy by closing the curtains, which was exactly what he needed.
"It's okay, I guess I would be frustrated somewhat as well if I were to be in your shoes." His eyes fell on the skates and he grinned. "I see you managed not to drown?"
That was not how he had planned that to go, not exactly. He felt his legs start to give away, energy drawn by his alarmed senses. His head whipped around as his arms couldn't find the soft mattress. 'Where had that bed gone to?' he wondered as he let himself fall on his butt. He was so damn tired.
"I know there's a spell for it though, can't remember what it was, but..."
Hermione hummed as she took a sip from her drink as Ron scratched the back of his head.
"You're not some object, Draco. Yes, you're right, I have no idea what your childhood had been like and I have not that much experience with any adults taking up my parents role, yet I'm sure your parents have their reasons. But please, don't talk about yourself like that." His chest felt full as he looked the other in the eyes and he barely dared to continue to speak. Though the other knew about his feelings already, it was quite hard to express them. Especially in a situation like this. He shouldn't let them get in the way right now. Harry couldn't help himself though. He bit his lip, brushing his thumb over the other boy's cheek. "You're extremely important..." he whispered.
Heading back to the hall, there were only a few people left. Harry quickly made his way over to the ones he had actually ever spoken to, though he shortly wondered if it was weird to suddenly ask for help like this.
He didn't usually just hug people, it mostly came to Hermione and Ron's mom occasionally, with Ron himself giving him a more brotherly hug at times. They did not last all that long. Well, aside from a few specific moments in their lives. Hugging this guy was somewhat different, more intimate. That was not just because of his crush, is what he told himself.
"Could one of you get my friend here some tea? We just came from outside," he said.
That didn't mean the idea didn't sting his heart.
Draco didn't sit down. He felt a bit empty now that he was done talking. It felt like a weight had been lifted from his shoulders, but not entirely. There was still something pressing down on him, something that would probably never be lifted. He deserved Weasley's resentment, and he deserved that weight on his shoulders.
"Please," he added quickly.
"You're comparing the sound I just made to a Christmas miracle…?" Draco raised one eyebrow. What was in that potion, had it made him high or something? It was confusing, and Draco wasn't used to Harry being like this towards him, but he didn't dislike it. It was actually a bit endearing, and the comment had maybe flattered him a bit. "You've never seen me laugh genuinely?" He asked, hesitantly.
"I fell asleep because I thought you needed some good rest, and I thought that if I'd leave, you would just continue pacing the room so I stayed, for your own health. Did it for yer own good Potter." Merlin, he was so drowsy. He could really use some coffee. There was no way he'd really wake up before drinking that.
Harry allowed the other to come closer as he simply pointed at it. "Uhm, like right here. After the part on how not to use Fairy Wing in it."
Malfoy wanted to curse at the other, he wanted to make him tell what was going on exactly. Why didn't he care, what was wrong with his mood?
He stirred and turned to find an angry nurse stomping over at him. He was dragged back to the hospital wing. Back in the bed, he glared hard at the cup with the potion. He was so not drinking that.
To thank him? Because he had been such a good… friend?
Draco never reached the dorms. Instead, he went to the library. He told himself it was because of his Arithmancy homework, but even he knew better. He'd seen Potter walk off in that direction. It wasn't like he wanted to be around him, but he did want to make sure he would keep his mouth shut about what happened.
"Quality, huh?" He chuckled, gladly accepting the other's closure. It didn't matter, the other in his arms right now was what counted. Whatever the other thought of him about now, it wasn't such a bad thing. Else they wouldn't be hugging like this, yet that didn't mean he should get his hopes up.
"Right…" Draco mumbled, letting the tips of his fingers rest on the spot between his eyebrows and the upper part of his nose. He closed his eyes for a brief moment and took a deep breath. He had completely exposed himself in front of not only Potter but Weasley too. He had sunken to his lowest standards without a single hesitation, and he saw no way to climb back up again. But it had been a good thing to do, even though it hurt his pride.
It went silent. The longer Draco didn't answer, the more insecure Harry began to look. He looked like he was about to take his words back, but before he could do this, Draco had decided he could at least show some comprehension.
Harry didn't greet the other back but merely let out a little puff of air at the casual greeting.
Draco took a deep breath and smiled faintly. "This might sound ridiculous, believe me, I'm not even sure if I should even bring this up, but I can't help myself." He paused and looked the other straight in the eyes. "I can't help but wonder… The person you fancy… That doesn't happen to be me, right?"
Against his will, he looked at the other, and when he did something inside him lit up. "Again, I'm sorry for interrupting. I'll uh, leave now I guess..." Surely, it was enough to intrude on the other, he couldn't, should not ever, ask if he was allowed to stay.
He just couldn't help the smile, it was as if his whole body was dying to express this bubbling feeling in his chest. He bit his lip in means to control himself, even though it was hard to hold back on his instincts. "Don't go too far with that now," he spoke up. "I might take you on that offer." The blond raised an eyebrow, not entirely sure what Potter meant to say with that, but not asking about it.
Blaise would have been right, Draco realized. But he'd changed, and so had his standards. "That's true," he admitted, "but I've changed. I've grown up."
"Just wait for it," he mumbled eventually. What else was there to do?
Harry"
They wouldn't let him, he guessed. With a smile, he greeted them and pointed to Malfoy.
The blonde's eyes shifted towards the other's lips for a second.
As soon as they reached the right place, Malfoy walked up to the painting and tickled the pear, which granted them access to the kitchens.
With a deep sigh, he stared at the ceiling. How long should he have to wait until classes ended and he could go back? If she would even let him with his behavior that is. Harry looked to the side. He could use his time to continue on his Potion's assignment. With a heavy sigh, he decided against that and leaned his head against the wall. Maybe he could just rest his eyes a little bit more…
Draco sniffed, not entirely uninterested. "I've seen some Ravenclaws carry those around… An enhanced quill, right?" "It actually is-nevermind. An enhanced quill alright. It takes quite some while to run out of ink. Very useful if I say so." He moved it somewhat closer to the blonde in hope of sealing the deal. He didn't really know what else to offer him.
He took a deep breath, steadied his violin back onto his shoulder, and started playing.
Outside the kitchen, he fell into a slower pace and absentmindedly wondered where he should sit as he could feel his heart hammer in his chest. Malfoy just kind of sticked to wandering around, sipping his tea as he did so. He eventually found a bench and sat down on it to finish his tea in peace. He gestured for Potter to sit down too. Malfoy would personally see to it that he finished his food if he liked it or not.
"It's surprising to see them both talk like this. I would want to know which year they are attending according to the story."
"And you?" He wasn't sure if he was asking about Potter's love life or his plans for the future, but both answers would please him.
Neville grinned down at Harry. “Luna will be over later, too. You were busy in your room, so I came out here and got roped into playing Quidditch.”
Harry took his place across from Draco, but still in the circle, and began chanting in order to keep the ritual steady. He wondered what, exactly, Draco had seen or heard -- the wind was so loud and the mirror so far away that Harry couldn’t really see it and he certainly couldn’t hear the exchange.
James, Lily, Al and Scorpius were playing on the floor while Andromeda watched over them from the big chair by the window.
Hagrid’s hut had been redesigned into a large gatehouse (one of two); which was fine because he hadn’t been back to the castle since the end of Harry’s fifth year. It was now the only entrance in or out of the Forbidden Forest from Hogwarts.
Harry walked down the hallway, carefully counting doors. He was just about to knock on what he assumed was Neville’s bedroom door when it flew open and he was yanked inside.
There was a high wall surrounding it, which stopped at the Forbidden Forest and carried all the way around the grounds, connecting to the castle at each cliff-edge. Armoured battlements were placed every three-hundred feet or so.
Draco waited for Friedrich to come back with the tea tray.
Draco was always happy to see him, though he visited rarely. He loved Friedrich’s house and grounds and he enjoyed the pocket-world that Friedrich lived in.
The polar bear patronus faded away.
“Ron is my best friend, yes. But so is Hermione. And so are you,” Harry said quietly.
“You’re all back now, right?” Harry whispered.
“‘Mione, you know they gear up for back to school in August. It’s August. We have to make do,” Harry replied.
“Okay. Tomorrow then?”
Augusta talked about all kinds of things and didn’t hold back. She asked intrusive questions, offered her opinion on each topic, and told him stories about his parents, Sirius, Neville’s parents and others. She talked about muggles in neutral tones, but didn’t wish to associate with them herself, even though she firmly believed in their right to coexist and respected them. She wasn’t afraid to talk about the war. She even, occasionally, asked him about Luna.
Harry recognized her right away -- he’d seen her at a distance before, at the train station, but he also recognized her clothing from the Defense class with Lupin and Neville’s boggart.
“Are you…” Draco trailed off. “Are you Opishanata?”
Harry felt afraid. He knew what the truth would be and he struggled, for a moment, to look upon his own reflection in the mirror.
“This is a pleasant surprise,” Friedrich said and then he stepped back and opened the door wider to allow Draco to pass by him.
"Kerr, Pye, Andrews, you'll finish working your burglary case -- when you're ready to arrest, just make sure you let one of your Captains know before you proceed. Dune, Emil, Fitzpatrick, you will all be on duty for whatever Captains Potter and Malfoy need during the entirety of their new case. They'll fill you in," Nexwell explained.
Then, he heads into work and they get assigned a new case.
Remus Lupin, Delphinium Greengrass and Alexander Quartermain came to dinner the night before Harry was to leave for the Weasleys'.
“Cody,” Draco said simply and then he followed the cat up through the woods, onto the trail and then up the hill.
“Good word usage, Potter,” Draco drawled.
“Yeah, I’d say. I think it might be that Hertha was significant. She’s the only person we’ve found dead in this manner that was moved all the way to London from somewhere else. The other bodies? They were all from London or Diagon or similar,” Harry explained.
“I just have the trunk and that bag,” Harry said.
2nd SEPTEMBER
Draco nodded. “Essentially, yes.”
"Ron," Harry said gently. "Of course it matters. But no one is going to make you do something you don't want to do. I'm sure your mother would feel relieved if either you or Ginny wanted to stay behind and not risk it."
“Our lab group couldn’t figure out what the powder is, but you have a friend who could?” Harry asked skeptically.
Ginny landed neatly on the ground. “Ron’s right, and I have some last minute homework to finish too.”
Severus nodded. “Yes. It didn’t take them long to secure the portkey. Romania isn’t strict, as you well know.”
“Harry, me, you, Gin, Neville, Viktor,” Hermione counted out. “We’ll have enough for an abbreviated version, once Luna gets here. We just have to remove a couple of players and not play against each other, but, rather, just play to make goals.”
Harry shrugged and then changed the subject. “Where did Dean end up? Parvati? Tilly? Emma? Justin?”
“No, I’m not -- as you well know. Delphi and Alexander understand what the Order is and that I am a member. They are on our side of the war and they are aware of your condition. Tell me what I want to know, please,” Augusta replied.
There was a long table at one end filled with food and beverages. At the other end, a record player played the latest, top 40 Wixen world songs. There were a handful of squishy armchairs and a couple of couches for people to lounge upon.
I'm going out of town for a few days and will be spending the time with my partner and her kid, so I won't have new chapters of anything else until sometime after April 4th.
Hermione left three days later, to go stay with the Weasleys for the rest of the summer -- she had plans with Ginny for some of it. She also knew that she was always welcome to stay in the Weasley guest room for however long she liked.
“I asked for Astoria,” came Draco’s quiet response.
“You could be. No one knows why you fled, and Nott’s back. You could be here, Draco,” Harry said, his astral-self stepping outside of his body to have the conversation.
They'd been partners for three years, but they'd managed to become friends only a few years before that. Because of their long history, and how hard they had each worked to become friends and work-partners, Draco wasn't about to let Harry put himself or others in danger because of whatever was going on.
Harry and Draco face the truth.
“So, the killer found her in Leeds and brought her here to kill her?” Draco asked as he made notes in a little notebook he kept in his jacket pocket.
“That’s great,” Draco said. “They’re the only spell that will be able to reach me while I’m gone. Otherwise, you’ll have to come through -- which you know.” He looked at his watch. “I’ve got to go.”
“We’re fine, Ronald,” said Hermione. “Your parents are just outside, we’re all seventeen, except Ginny, and nothing’s going to happen to us while we’re in Slug and Jiggers.”
“My brother is the head of the family as the only male heir and takes care of all of the business matters of Greengrass Horticultural Society. I head up the greenhouses, they’re my purview and the plants and flowers were always the thing that most interested me. My sway is light and always has been, regardless of my sorting,” she explained. “I have no desire to bow to the Dark Lord, and my friendship with Augusta goes back a long way -- before I started at Hogwarts.”
Neville nodded and then helped Ginny take the brooms and equipment to the shed.
Harry scrubbed a hand over his face. “We do have a latent print. It took over two weeks to process. I swear to you, Dray, if we don’t get this person within the next month? We’re done. They won’t resurface for another two years.”
“Hermione hasn’t,” Harry argued honestly. “She always wants me to be my best self and to do things right -- even if that’s always code for what she thinks is right. And I have, in the past, done stuff her way to avoid an argument or worse. I’m not ashamed of that. I love her, she’s my family.”
"I'll think about it," Ron said after several moments.
“Related to Daphne?” Harry asked Lady Greengrass from across the table where she sat closer to Augusta.
“I am always happy to have you here, Draco,” Friedrich said before he set aside his tea and rose. He gathered the bag and the report in his hands. “I’ll head down to my lab, now, and put this away. When I come back up, we can go see the horses, if you prefer.”
Draco nodded. “That would be nice. I have a bit of a favour to ask you.”
“Prefects, please come up here. You’ll be helping to get everyone to their rooms.”
Harry wasn’t sure what happened to them once they were there, but since the two students he’d seen escorted to a battlement had been at dinner that night, he figured it was just a lengthy interrogation.
HIKARU (1st August)
"There is very little evidence involved, just like last time," Harry added.
“Draco, I get being a shut-in...or being agoraphobic, but we might need him to testify to his discovery, so that we can prove why we need a warrant and why we have cause,” Harry said.
“Hermione, are you feeling alright?” Harry asked, absolutely gob-smacked to find her up on a broom.
Friedrich nodded. “It’s important.”
His intention to apparate to London and take a room at the Leaky was interrupted with a swift, loud knock on the front door.
“Good, good,” Harry said. “Should I go with you?”
Finally, he looked up, into his own eyes and waited.
By the gods, he’d thought this summer -- the very last he had to spend with them -- would be better. But it wasn’t. It wasn’t even close to better. In some ways, it was much, much worse.
Madam Pomfrey’s polar bear nodded her great head and then opened her mouth. “Fever Reducer for the Fever, obviously. I’ll be sending along a few nutrition potions. I’ll send them through the floo, as that’s quickest. Tell Mr. Longbottom to be expecting them tomorrow. In the meantime, the Antibiotic Agent should work as a kind of cure-all -- if you have that available. If not, you might try
Three Weeks Later
Neville, who was concentrating on landing and getting off of his broom smoothly, didn’t answer.
Ginny rushed over to where they’d been standing; off in a corner.
Really short chapter, but it was a natural place to end it. :)
Harry smiled at her and then nodded. “Any idea how I get to the fourth floor from here?”
“I will,” said Draco as he stepped through the portal.
“There’s oatmeal and toast in the kitchen. Some tea, too,” Severus said, answering her question.
Cloestra grinned and threw her arms around him. They hugged for several, long moments.
“Where are we with the mirror?” Draco asked, changing the subject.
“You coming to Diagon with us, Neville?” Ron asked.
He also really loved spending time with the older man -- their relationship was simple and mostly physical, though there was a great deal of friendship and respect on both sides. Their long and somewhat complicated history never seemed to get in the way of their bond. It always put Draco at ease, and in better sorts, to spend a few hours by Friedrich’s side.
Friedrich poured the tea and doctored it the way he remembered that Draco liked. He handed Draco his cup and then leaned back, against the seatback, with his own.
Harry glanced around too. “Let’s hurry up and get back to Molly and Arthur. Ron’s right, this feels weird.”
“Alright. Do you need to take the whole vial with you, or…?” Harry trailed off.
“I think that Severus didn’t want to unnecessarily burden you. I left you alone because I was busy and trying to fix the damage I’d done with Declan. I also had some family things this summer that I needed to take care of.”
“This is the only real birthday party I’ve ever had,” Harry said quietly to Neville. “I’m so grateful, Nev. Really. I can’t thank you enough.”
Harry turned from where he'd been standing at the sink, staring out at the falling snow. "Thanks for taking care of that, Gin."
Ru tossed the covers off her body and stood. She stretched leisurely and then looked around. The room was plain, but warm, and much more welcoming than the cell she’d occupied at Majonoie Henkan.
He looked around the well-kept space and regretted, very briefly, his inability to stay or be part of this world anymore. He was comfortable in
Rather than a restless night, Harry had slept quite well. He couldn't really place where his dream was going to though. Aside the humming and the fire there had been something white and bright. He had no idea what it was at first until he recognized it as his Patronus. It was walking towards where he was looking, towards the fire, and then came to a stop to rest. It had just been this until something else came in view as well. Though before he could figure out what it was he woke up by something brighter than any of it, something that was more of a building site lighting luminaire.
As they talked, Draco's mind started wandering off. He thought about what would happen if he and Harry kept being so friendly to each other. If it was even possible to continue like that. Their friends wouldn't like each other. Draco wouldn't be liked by Granger and Weasley, and Harry would be disliked by Draco's friends as well. Then there was the fact that everyone's hero was friends with the kid of a death eater. Surely that would cause some uproar.
I do not own the Harry Potter series. This is pure fanservice my collab partner and I made
"I don't intend to be likable towards you, I thought you'd know that by now." Again, he ignored Potter's remark, but his posture had become a bit tense. Affronted, Harry stopped writing altogether and put his things down. "You know, Malfoy. There's a brief moment when you first wake up, where you have no memories. A blissful blank slate, a happy emptiness," Harry almost enunciated. "Whenever I see your face, I wish I could just stay in that moment." With that, he picked the feather back up and continued taking down his notes.
"There you are," he spoke. Luna turned around as she noticed him. "Oh, hi Harry." Like he had predicted she was working on some flyers. Harry rose his eyebrow at her as he came closer, trying to catch a glimpse of the paper as he did.
Malfoy nodded softly. "I guess so," he replied, his voice hollow. After making so many emotions rush through his body by telling Potter so much about himself, he just felt a bit empty. He appreciated the other's attempt to lighten the mood, but couldn't really get into it. He was just glad Potter accepted him.
"I'm sure the news will spread quickly then, Hogwarts does like its gossip." Draco smiled faintly. "Though, I'm used to Slytherin parties. And I'm not sure if you've heard what they're like, but if you invite Slytherins, you invite what they bring with them. They'll come, I'm sure if the party's interesting enough."
His hands found the other's back again, one moving up a bit to his shoulder.
A plan to set up a Christmas party for all four houses is set up, plus drama
"I know," Draco muttered, surprised by the other's sudden actions. Yes, he had asked for this, he couldn't complain now. Not that he wanted to, it felt weirdly nice to feel the other's warmth again. He shifted a bit so that he wasn't sitting anymore, but wasn't sure what to do from there. Should he just… curl up? Or hug back? Or stay like this? Why was this so difficult for someone who nearly always knew what to do and how to deal with things? It wasn't like he had some kind of stupid, girlish crush… Oh but wait… No, absolutely not. He instantly threw that thought away, as if he were stung by it. What in the world was he thinking about?
In the middle of their kissing Harry bit softly on Malfoy's bottom lip, pulling it lightly before he let go and continued their previous kiss, free hand searching for skin underneath the other's shirt. All of this made the Slytherin feel quite dizzy. His brain simply didn't function anymore, it only consisted of short thoughts, impulsive ideas that were acted out immediately. Things like moving his hands, sometimes snatching a bit of air between the kisses, and other little movements that he couldn't control.
"I know what he has done, so does he, no need to remind us. I… understand it's hard to look past it, but we can't keep things like this. We need to move forward now." Maybe he should have pronounced that differently, 'cause he could see the hatred in Ron's eyes.
Harry let his hand linger somewhat longer on the other's face, smiling softly as he looked the other in the eye. "That would do," he said.
Harry raised an eyebrow. "What you were implying?" If he were to be honest, he had never heard of the contents of the parties. Surely, he knew that the houses held their own parties, but he didn't really know what to expect. Were the Slytherins wild party animals or something that he mentioned this?
"Thank you," he mumbled. He'd never been judged for his work before, this was such a new experience. It felt a bit pressured. Especially because it was Potter.
But Malfoy had heard it, loud and clear. There was no erasing it now. He simply kind of stared at the other, watching him be the most Harry Potter he'd ever seen him be. He was blushing, muttering, being a bloody mess, all due to saying something before thinking about it. This clumsiness was absolutely a Potter trait if he'd ever seen one. He suppressed a grin and kind of sniffled. "It's fine, thank you."
"Then why would you stop?" It had slipped past his lips before he could stop it and he felt weirdly stupid for asking that. Obviously the other had been taken by surprise due to his sudden presence, heck he had even barely caught the violin as it had dropped from his hold.
The Malfoy manor had become dead silent ever since the dark lord fell. Draco had never objected to that, he too preferred to not talk about the war, but it had put the house in a cold and frozen kind of state. Maybe it was for the best that he stayed at Hogwarts this Christmas, it would undoubtedly be nicer than going back to the manor.
"In such precious company, no thanks."
Draco couldn't help but chuckle.
Hermione looked at Neville strangely until it seemed to click and her head darted forward past Ron's frame. "Your nightmares haven't stopped?"
"Of course, if we invite all houses, I mean all," Harry grinned. "Anyway, Slytherins can be brave as well, so it's not like we all belong all too specific in the labels of the houses, now do we?" he casually stated in a matter-of-fact tone, directing a smile and a wink his friend's way after he had spoken.
Now letting the yawn escape though he started to talk, he forgot to watch his words.
Man, this was sad. Tracing his teeth with his tongue before scratching his head, Harry contemplated what to do or say. Should he ask him to come along with them to Hogsmeade? He was Draco Malfoy after all… Plus Hermione wouldn't let him see another day if he did.
"I see I was being overly honest," he tried to cover up his slip-up, only failing as he voiced yet again his thoughts. He groaned and let himself sink through his knees back on the bed, hands overlapping his face. "You heard nothing."
As Harry reached the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall, he caught his friends not too far away from where he stood.
Harry snorted, not sure if the other was just mocking him now.
Honestly, it was weird how much their relationship had changed in just a matter of days.
"Potter!" Someone screamed from a slight distance. Harry didn't turn, knowing who it was just by the underlying tone and he didn't plan on spending time with that person. "Ignorant twat," the voice continued to mutter, this time a lot closer to him than before.
But Malfoy was quite a clever person. It wasn't hard to put Potter's mood, behavior, and words together. He'd told him to maybe get a lover for distraction, but now he realized that love was the actual problem. Potter was crushing on someone. He instantly wondered who it could be, and to his surprise, felt a flush of jealousy wash over him. He quickly tucked that away though and focussed on the boy in front of him.
Harry groaned. "If I even make it there." He kept himself up by leaning on the table next to him. In all honesty, he was ready to leave to get himself checked upon yet he didn't want his friends to worry about him. Surely, if it were anyone else he could have asked them to tell his two buddies, but this was Draco Malfoy. They might rather believe Snape telling them as the blonde. Harry bet Hermione would try to get Malfoy to tell them what he did to their friend, while in fact, Malfoy was just being nice.
"Mal..." He hesitantly brought his hand up to wipe the warm tears that spilled out the other's eyes away. It pulled on his heartstrings to see the other like this and he sighed as he pulled the other back in. "You don't have to say anything, just let it out."
"W-what?!" His body spun around, not as fast as he had liked it too. "I-... You… I wouldn't, not yet, not like this. Wait no, I mean-"
He was a mess. Perfectly composed, proper, orderly Draco Malfoy had now been reduced to a weak pile of shivers and sounds, caused by no one other than Harry Potter.
Draco had never experienced something like this, and as much as it overwhelmed him, he couldn't help but love it.
It was true that Slytherins respected each other's boundaries. Pansy, however, didn't seem to do so. She never had, Draco reminded himself. "I can assure you, that's all there is to it," he said, his voice a tad colder than before, hoping that this would tell her that she should leave the matter be.
He'd never been a morning person, even though his parents had always wanted him to be at lunch at 8 in the morning. His brain simply hadn't woken up yet around such early times, which made him wonder how late it was right now.
"Anyway," Draco broke the silence, "I still believe it's best to get someone or something to accompany you. If that something happens to be me, all you have to do is ask." Yes, he had actually just offered to sleep with Potter. That sounded incredibly wrong. All of this felt incredibly wrong, but he couldn't help himself anymore. After all, he would gain something from it too. He'd noticed how much easier it was to sleep when he was not alone, how much better it felt. Now he couldn't ask Pansy to do this, and none of his other friends were close enough to even be considered for that task. He'd done it with Potter before, so he seemed to be the only option left.
With a huff he decided to grab his almost-done bundle of papers to combine it with the papers he had written in the library like half an hour ago.
This was why Malfoy usually took his time to think before he spoke. He already began to regret what he'd said because the longer he thought about it, the more stupid it sounded, even to him. But then why had he said it? Maybe because he hated being brushed off. Or maybe because Potter had hurt his pride. He would never admit that, but it was probably true.
"Ron," Harry brought out in a whisper, though loud enough to make his friend turn his head towards him. "Wish them a happy Christmas for me." Ron smiled at him, offering him a hug.
Draco slipped back into his usual cold posture and tidied his robes, which had been wrinkled due to his little dramatic display a few minutes ago. Maybe he shouldn't have done that after all. As he walked back towards the Slytherin dorms, it dawned on him that he'd spoken badly about his father. Not only that, but he'd also shown a very vulnerable side of himself. In front of Potter. Malfoy didn't agree with his father, but he did respect him. He was grateful for the protection he offered. Speaking ill about him in front of all those students…
Taking note there was enough snow to his left to grab, he decided to just throw the ball in hope of luck standing on his side. The other was still quite the distance away, but he didn't dare come closer without any snow to arm himself with.
"Fine. What's it?"
Or maybe he was, he wasn't sure. All he knew was that he didn't mind at the moment.
He sighed and raked a hand through his hair out of mild frustration. Why was he so afraid of telling his friends he hung out with Potter? Because it would hurt the 'high and mighty Malfoy' image that they had of him? Because it was out of his usual character? Because it confused him so much? "I mean, it's stupid, I know," he resumed eventually. "I just thought it would clash you know, I'm not sure how fond they are of you."
Harry never had to hide his feelings here at Hogwarts.
The blond let out a small chuckle, mostly out of nervosity and the other emotions that were raging through him. "I wouldn't be hugging you if you weren't Potter, I like quality," he said hoarsely.
A groan left Harry's lips as he lifted his weight to have a better view of the book the blonde was holding. Why did they have to do this right now anyway… He tried to focus yet his mind still felt a bit fuzzy and the way Malfoy explained it in his own way didn't appeal to him at the moment. As he stared at the book, trying to look as if he was actually paying attention he could feel himself nod away and sink away from time to time. He didn't want to fall asleep though. Not only would it be rude, but he also didn't wish for another nightmare if the blonde would still be there.
"Maybe I should just make this my bedroom," he spoke with a ghost of a smile on his face.
His breath hitched. Did he fuck up? Merlin's beard, he didn't show it, did he? Well, so much for keeping secrets. Harry scooted farther away from the blond, uneasiness oozing from him as he did. "I was just gonna say I would take you up on that," he murmured, trying not to let his voice waver. He tended to give in, yet he was not planning to do now.
"Well, for one, Ron's mom knits these lovely sweaters for everyone, including me," he started as he pulled on the end of the red sweater, a smile lingering on his lips. "Some might think they look ridiculous, but honestly they are the warmest jumpers I have ever had. As for the celebration itself, well, they have a long table in order that everyone can sit with each other, it makes it all quite cozy actually. Usually, they just have a nice meal and chat, that's about it, just being together. It really feels like a home when you're there because everyone shows so easily that they care about you." He paused with that.
Harry bit down on his bottom lip. His fingers buried deep in messy hair, nails lightly scraping the other's scalp.
Harry wanted to get this over with quickly and handed the papers over, luckily he had been as handy to bundle them together neatly. Professor Snape looked at him before he slowly raised his hand to grab it, yet as soon as his hand folded around the bundle he almost snapped it from the boy's hand.
Draco got the stuff he needed, made sure it was in a small bag that no one would suspect, and hurried off towards the room of requirement. Now, this room had always been some sort of safe haven to him. He'd been using it to practice since his fourth year, and the room had always taken the same shape of a certain room in the Malfoy manor that he felt very familiar with. It was like a little trip back in time, back to his childhood. The only thing it lacked was his mother to watch him.
Harry owlishly stared at him for a few seconds before he chuckled and shook his head.
It took the Slytherin a whole lot of patience to not morph his face into an annoyed sneer. Luckily, his voice stayed calm, be it a bit cold. "Read the paper, Granger." Distrustful she scanned his eyes before she let her eyes fall on the crumbled parchment. Seeing as he almost wanted to push it in her face, she decided to take it and at least take a look at it. She immediately recognized the handwriting. That was Harry's alright.
Ron wasn't really sure how he felt about it, but as he had mentioned to Harry, he was willing to give the other a change. To prove he wasn't that bad, not anymore. Although Ron had to admit that the Slytherin hadn't called him nor Hermione names anymore since he started hanging around Harry. Maybe Harry was a good influence on the blond, Ron concluded.
He didn't feel like discussing it any further. Even though Harry didn't wish to come eye to eye with his friends, Ron especially as he knew Hermione would be less of the hothead from the two. He pushed his feelings aside and entered the great hall. Maybe he should just grab some food and leave…
"I believe that's my own fault," he spoke up, this time the edge on his words sharper. "I get you might be disappointed or the sort, yet you seem quite furious. Can you stop that?"
"Hey, Neville?"
"Hungry?" He asked.
Draco saw the hesitation on the other's face. It probably sounded a bit dangerous to him, and that was understandable, but Draco tended to like dangerous sometimes. If Potter were to hang out with him, he'd have to get used to that. He shifted a bit, trying to sit in a more comfortable position, and thought about the other's words. "Look, as much as I like to plan things out in detail weeks before it actually happens, I think it might be best to form a group of planners first. Preferably at least one person from each house. And it probably can't hurt to ask some Ravenclaws to help with this too. If we start figuring stuff out in detail right now, we'll forget half of it anyway."
Call it Fanservice
"Ooooor we just head for the kitchens and I brew you some myself." That might be a better idea, he assumed. Yet he doubted the house-elves would even let him do something at all…
Now that he had already reached rock bottom, it wasn't hard to continue.
"Which is why I know that you'll be amazing-"
"It's not like I wouldn't expect that to happen to you," she started, "but I'm sure you also know how little that explains. You've been gone since yesterday's last class, from what I've heard you haven't returned to the common room since then. I'm just wondering where you've slept, that's all."
Palms reached up to get rid of the wetness that was blurring his view.
What he did care about were Potter's godly touches and the fact that their clothes were absolutely slipping out of place.
Hermione entered the common room just as the two let go of one another and they made their way outside where the two of them left Harry with wishes for the holidays and two tight hugs, which he gladly returned. Only when his friends were too far away to spot, he turned back to head inside. He should probably get back to the hospital wing first to get his stuff, but he felt like changing clothes first. He had slept in the clothes from the day before and he didn't like the feeling of it, though the smell Malfoy had left on them was rather comforting.
It probably sounded very stupid, but Draco just had to ask this.
They left Ron running after them to catch up after swiftly sneaking something in his mouth. He was chewing on it still as he fell in pace with them. Hermione sent him a disgusted look but ignored it while Harry felt the room spin. Did he eat something wrong? No, if that were the case it wouldn't take effect so quickly would it? Did someone have a cold that he was infected with then? Harry didn't know and could care less. All he wanted to do right now was to just cuddle up in some blankets. Chills had been running down his spine just now and he did not particularly like that.
The tears began to pour down his face.
Neville shook his head. “No, they’re friends. She comes to dinner a lot, actually.”
Draco nodded. "Alright. What is it, then?"
“Are you the new head of the Order, Augusta?” Remus asked. “And is this really a safe conversation to be having in front of Lady Greengrass and Mr. Quartermain?”

“The majority of the castle thought I was and most of the Slytherins. Many people think I killed Dumbledore. It isn’t safe for me to return, and you know it,” Draco admonished.
Just a note I thought was important, because it's likely it won't be explained in the fic:
Draco sat on top of the desk in the middle of the room, though there was also one at the back that he much preferred. "You've been in a funk for the last three weeks. I don't know what's going on, but you're going to tell me. This case that we're about to introduce to half of our team could prove to be very dangerous. You'll put us all in jeopardy if you keep living in your head the way you've been doing. Tell me what's wrong and how I can help."
“Not your face but your heart’s desire?” Harry asked. His voice was laced with a combination of humour and trepidation.
When Harry popped away, Augusta gave the house one last look and then apparated home.
Extremely surprised to see her, Harry stepped back quickly. “Hermione?”
“I am on break from the league and wanted to see ‘Ermione,” Viktor said as he vaulted off of his broom. “I am also a member of the Order, and so Molly and Arthur were happy to have me come by today. I will be leaving soon. I have plans in London tonight.”
Mafloy’s eyes on him and something in his belly stirred with anticipation for the other man’s first move. Would he make one? Because Harry Potter very much would like so.
“That’s the real question, isn’t it? Muses Padma, scrolling through the emails. “Draco, I think we got the response from the Icelandic IT…”
His email pings again.
It’s easy to throw everything away and pack, leaving the country for Spain or Portugal; Draco is familiar with the concepts of running from responsibilities thanks to his father. And thanks to that valuable lesson, or because of it, this year will be his fourth anniversary at Stanson.
What, if that first year, he was kinder to him and showed more understanding? What if he tried harder, fought to understand him, gave him an option to keep him and his family safe? They were both
Before all of this, he had never even thought about kissing the Slytherin, but right now, he barely couldn't think of anything else.
