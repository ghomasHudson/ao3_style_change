And behind him, he doesn’t see Draco fall to the floor, bury his face in his hands, and mutter with a sad, shaky laugh:
Potter just stood there awkwardly.
Harry was horrified.
Draco sighed, accepting that he wasn't going to get any information out of Potter after all. "Aren't you
“I wouldn’t have gotten him out of that wretched household if I didn’t plan on following through my word,” Snape growled and that had been that.
Therefore, when he and Ron met up that Friday for their obligatory lunch in the Regurgitating Rats, the first thing that he asked, with a whole lot of difficulty and speech blocks, was: “How do people… you know…
“What?”
Harry thought angrily, and the chandelier floating above them broke into pieces and rained shards on them.
Draco opened his eyes. A horrible thought flashed in his head. "What happened to the vampires?"
Not that it was important.
Narcissa chuckles. “I reckon as well.” She straightens her shoulders, and then glances at her son. “I’ll send Molly Weasley an Owl. Stay as long as you like.”
All conversation died in the hall. It was as if a gust of wind had blown through the whole room and shushed everyone one by one. Harry certainly felt that gust of wind. It froze him to the tips of his fingers and to his toes.
your life just so that we could
"The first is a locket," Harry explained, as he pushed a branch away from his face. Leaves crunched under his boot, starkly loud in contrast with the silence of the Forest of Dean. Behind him, more crunching sounds followed, and he craned his head to check on his companion, almost expecting a pointy nose scrunched up in disgust at all the moss and wet leaves.
, Pansy –“
So it was on the afternoon of the 17th that Harry Potter, covered with a Glamour charm, and his cat travelled to Diagon Alley in search for the perfect gift for Draco Malfoy.
"I'm afraid I can't tell you."
“He is. Have you got a problem with that?”
No, but he’s becoming more sure as he says it. The decision settles in his chest, comfortable and right. “I am.” Then, he hastily adds, “If it’s not too imposing.”
Still, Harry wasn't one to take his blessings for granted so he took his seat and tried to pretend that everything was still normal.
He grabs his own robes from the bed, crosses the room, pulls at Draco’s shoulder to turn him around, and can’t help the big smile that slides its way to his lips when Draco simply lets him.
But the score was 3-0, in favor of Draco, and Draco slumbered peacefully.
He wanted to curl into a ball.
Someone vomiting.

still suffering and maybe he’s not yet done losing people after all.
"It's your mother's ancestral home, after all."
"Students, stand back," Dumbledore said calmly.
Potter looked at him, palpable confusion on his face. There was something that hinted at desperation in his voice as he said, “You can’t keep on doing this until your body gives out.”
“Two to three hours.”
It was a Portkey.
“Mm-hmm,” said Draco distractedly as he took Harry’s offered wine and disappeared in the kitchen in his search for a wineglass. “You wouldn’t love me if I wasn’t.”
The first month is the hardest of all: Students have lost their reservations at ambushing them left and right to ask for pictures and autographs. He finds that he can’t even relax in the Common Room without someone sitting next to him and asking him how he
What Snape saw clearly, however, was the array of emotions that crossed Black’s face when his eyes landed on the boy. He didn’t even make notice of Snape. Black’s face transformed from disbelief, to despair, and to relief in a matter of a second and he had immediately dashed forward, on his knees, to hold the boy to his chest and sob.
“Try mine.”
Draco was rambling, in panic, in terror. "
he wrote.
As if Draco was an avoidable existence in his life.
Harry didn’t know how to comfort him. But he knew he didn’t
Narcissa whipped her head to look at him, chin rising up. "And I have not agreed."
Draco sighs, rubs his hand over his face, and then keeps it there. “How did you know I was in the Forbidden Forest?”
hope.
He doesn’t understand it. Doesn’t understand why it affected him so much.
Draco is still staring, but now it’s towards the frog. “Why?”
a vampire?” Draco asked an hour later after Harry was done with the tour of the mansion. They were in the front gardens now, where Harry was still touring him around in, but he couldn’t contain himself anymore. He had minded his manners for the past hour, listening attentively to Harry’s simple descriptions of the boy’s room and giving his own comments and comparisons with his own home, and figured that that was good enough.
Draco flinched again. He really didn't want to see the serpent again in his mind's eye.
"What about you, Potter?"
when Potter smiles back. He’s not supposed to say good morning to Potter, or Weasley, or Granger, or to anyone else for that matter.
Harry frowns at that, but doesn’t rise up to the bait. “I know. I just want to. I’m the one who offered.”
They’re on the bridge, and the cold November wind slaps at their robes and bites their cheeks. Draco doesn’t stop, but Harry hadn’t really expected him to, and so he leaps forward and grabs Draco’s wrist.
"Your friends have kindly informed me of your predicament, Mister Potter," Madame Pomfrey said, shaking him out of his stupor. She clucked her tongue in disapproval. "Lip-Lock Jinx. What you kids are coming up with these days."
“Hm?”
"I don't suppose you'll tell me who cast the spell on you, so we can give them the proper reprimands?" Madame Pomfrey asked, one eyebrow raised.
The sky is blue, the air is refreshingly cold, and in the middle of it all is soft, blonde hair swaying with the wind.
Pansy’s exaggerated huff got all their attention. “Go away, Blaise, I want to sit next to Draco,” she whined.
Harry, who had just arrived and was in the middle of sitting down, flopped ungraciously on the chair in surprise at the question.
Harry tamps down the urge to smile. After so many visits of Draco just sitting there like a vegetable, it’s refreshing to hear his usual snark. “Hermione says hi, by the way.”
At first, Severus didn't react. But Draco could tell that Severus was satisfied that he didn't say what he was originally supposed to say. Finally, Severus nodded slowly, thoughtfully. "Harry is… in detention right now, if that would make you feel better."
But he knows that’s not what she deserves.
Besides, Draco likes eating his cooking, no matter how much he gripes that there are House Elves to do the "menial stuff" or no matter how burnt Harry's waffles are.
“Stole is a very strong word.”
Ah, now it all clicked in Harry's head.
Harry opened his eyes and couldn't stop the grin forming on his face. He
Severus put his quill down with one last defeated sigh at the papers in front of him. He waved offhandedly at the teacup sitting at the edge of his desk, steam still rising from its contents. Harry reckoned Severus had put a Warming Charm on it.
. Draco actually thought they were friends. Harry didn’t know how people became friends. Dudley had
Of course. Harry's mouth opened to form an 'o' in understanding. Well, that made sense. He should have expected that, after years of forced mingling with the pureblood families in boring balls.
In response, the cat quirked an eye open at him, but Harry ignored him in favour of gazing at the picture with a grin.
Ron grinned. "Just wondering if you're already that desperate."
Draco also realized that night that Potter was horrid at Wizard's Chess.
Harry cringed. “I stopped listening when you said Golden Boy.”
And in his shock, Harry had forgotten his manners and spoke for the first time that night, “No mo’ cubburds?”
It’s slow and it’s shaky, but Draco’s
As they emerged from the entryway, Draco saw the room that they had just entered. It was square and spacious, but sparsely decorated. The walls were white, so were the messy covers on the bed in the middle of the room. There was a small bedside table where a tray of food was left untouched.
Remus grinned. “See? I told you he was Sirius.”
Draco waited.
Harry shrugged, feeling embarrassed at the realization that Severus now knows that he's the most important person to Harry. Well, it
Draco’s face lit up. “So it’s not true that vampires burn under the sun?”
At the far end of the Hospital Wing, on the right side of the wall, was a small, white door that led to Madame Pomfrey's room. Severus knocked on this thrice.
But he was biting people.
Ah. Malfoy laughed.
“Hi, I’m Astoria.”
By the end of the day, he had new school robes, a complete set of the required books for first years, new quills and inkwells, his own cauldron and his own little set of basic Potions ingredients, and – this was the best one –
Another round of laughter. “Sorry. Sorry, I’ll ask next time.”
Without looking at Draco, Harry turned away and walked out of the Hospital Wing, shameful and at the same time burning with rage.
“And Petunia, you tell that bastard out there to get his dirty shoes off my porch –“
Harry couldn't take it anymore. He made a grunting noise (Yes, way to go, Potter, very civilized.) to get Draco's attention and when Draco snapped his head up to look at him, motioned towards him with his hand.
“Cast a Protego,” Malfoy said, raising his wand towards the spot in front of the lake.
The words are out of his lips before he can stop them. “Come back.”
There was no clue anywhere that Voldemort’s magic still persisted. No rotting grass. No dry soil. The snow covered all areas, unlike the water that had aggressively avoided the remnants of Voldemort’s magic in the Chamber of Secrets.
The dragon fell to the Lake in a roar and Harry couldn't escape from the rain that her splash made. He ran a hand through his hair, pushing his wet bangs away from his face. He knew the dragon would be back though – and back she came, blowing angry streams of fire from her nostrils as she emerged from the dark waters of the Lake, dripping with water that quickly turned into steam.
Showing him the existence of magic didn’t prove as difficult as Snape had predicted it to be.
, Draco glares at the parchment. “Are you fibbing with me?”
back of his mind, there is a small voice whispering to him that it almost seems like Draco’s… jealous.
Again. Well. That’s as much of an answer that Draco’s ever going to get.
, my arse, Potter! That was a Corkscrew Dive!
And punched a tree when no sound came out.
The earth beneath him started rocking and Harry chanced a look above the boulder at the dragon. She was pacing, each step sending everyone in the stands bouncing in their seats.
Good.
But, to his surprise, Potter responded, “There was seven.”
Auror reflexes had Harry running after it before he could even think about what he was doing. He thought about calling after the cat but realized he hadn't even named it.
Harry looked at Seamus in horror. “I’m not sure I’m comfortable with you guys talking about me in an apron,” he squeaked out.
His voice, when he asked his next question, sounded foreign to him. The words sounded like they hadn't come from his mouth. "You haven't been home at all… have you?"
Draco really
A smile broke out on Harry's face at that. He glanced at the word 'git' on the table and tapped it with his finger.
It makes his
Harry was about to say that
Draco smiles slightly at the frustrated figure Potter’s back makes. “Thought it might convince me.”
They walked out of the library just in time to see Draco Malfoy in the distance halt his steps abruptly and look back.
Seamus was notorious for narrating his sexual experiences with his friends, and while Ron didn’t mind on most days, he absolutely didn’t want to hear sex stories
He looked around for any sight of that white-blond hair but could only see a mixture of brunettes and gingers. The blonds he saw weren’t the right shade.
Snape pinched his nose and bit his tongue to keep himself from saying anything that might sound like he was insulting Harry’s artistic prowess.
The words are slipping past his lips before it fully registers in his brain. “Tell me when you need to attend those parties. I can look after Draco when you’re gone.”
"Do you need help?" came the soft voice beside him that snapped him out of his stupor.
“The last horcrux wasn’t an object, Malfoy.”
"Harry James Potter, would you mind telling me just why Draco Malfoy is on the other side of the Fat Lady's Portrait asking for you?"
“No more cupboards,” the man had said firmly. Harry was amazed at that. “Now sleep. I will fetch you in the morning.”
Harry smiled sadly to himself. He was aware that Remus knew, out of anyone else, what 'a lot of people out there' were capable of when faced with something they couldn't comprehend. In this case, a werewolf or a… vampire.
Harry wanted to say, but Severus waved his response away with a hand. "I am furious at Albus and Minerva for putting me to sleep without my consent. And I
And Harry could feel the lump again in his throat now, though it wasn't because of the underuse of his voice. He had a lot of replies to that, a lot of answers, but his nose was still bleeding and he couldn't get rid of the look of betrayal on Draco's face from his mind's eye, so he opted for the safest answer.
He rolled his wrist, keeping it warmed up just in case he needed to immediately flick it with an Impediment Jinx.
Okay, so.
Draco thought about kissing Harry again and hearing Harry's confession coming from those lips.
Draco nodded obligingly. “And has he consented to that?”
Potter is in
Ron rolled his eyes. "Of course, you're you."
but he knew it was stupid.
Quidditch and Potions. That was what Harry saw Draco loved most during their school days.
But Draco accepts the tart and the salve anyway, and they sit side by side in the library again, shoulders relaxed and voices low, their arms pressed warmly against each other.
"Don't call her that," Harry said automatically.
They found themselves in the same position a few hours later, when the rest of the student population was in the Great Hall eating their well-deserved lunch after four straight, grueling hours of classes.
“Do not use that tone with me, Draco.”
However, as soon as that feeling made itself known, Harry quickly stamped it down. He was going to get through this. He was going to finish this Maze. He'd come this far. He'd practiced all the spells he could.
, wasn’t it?
It helped that the child was eager to learn the things that Snape presented him with and, as a result, was a diligent student.
“You’re… trying,” Draco echoed. Potter’s words were confusing. Granted, this was the first time Potter had been forthright about the mission’s details that Draco didn’t urgently need at the moment, but his words seemed like he was going about this… on his own. “Have you perhaps talked to Weasley and Granger about this?”
away) today, Harry immediately brightened up and he showed her the scroll of parchment he was holding in his hand with a goofy grin.
Looking at the Marauders’ Map.
The cavern echoed with their footsteps, made by boots splashing on puddles. Droplets of water fell from stalagmites and made ripples on the water flooding the cavern floor.
"How is he?" Severus asked, his voice low and quiet.
With one last nod, he took the parchment with him and left the library, feeling considerably lighter with his admission.
It was part of the terms of the assignment that he would only be told the location on the day itself.
“No, it’s fine,” Harry replies, and it is. “It’s alright. If you want to talk. I want to…” He pauses, surprised at the truth in his next words. “I want to listen.”
Draco’s laughter was cut short. “Wha – hey –
Fleur Delacour was the one overflowing with cavity-inducing sweetness. She had taken it upon herself to croon over him, saying how it must be hard on him to take part in such a dangerous tournament at his age and at how terribly unfair everyone was being, treating him like a monster. "They've made up all zorts of stories about vampires and Veelas, it's terrible! Vhy, my Auntie Fres was a Veela who married a vampire, and their romance is one of the zweetest I have ever known! Vampires are very loyal, you know, if not a wee bit uptight." She flashed him a sweet smile.
Draco nodded. He knew there were a lot more things they weren't telling him, and he really wasn't sure he wanted to know. He let himself believe in Dumbledore's words.
“You boys,” she sighed, shaking her head. “All these years. Both of you shouldn’t be doing this anymore.” She took a deep breath to compose herself. “Nevertheless, I…
"You know what Mr. Potter needs, Professor Snape."
Narcissa continues. “It is a must that I remain visible to other pureblood families. Of course, the Wizarding World knows of what part the Malfoy family has played in the war, but we cannot let that force us into hiding. There are those who are waiting for the opportunity to gain all that we have yet to lose.” She glances at Draco wistfully. “We may have done bad things, Harry, but my son doesn’t deserve to be stripped of everything he ever was and had.”
It was only during these moments that he could feel once again that he was just Draco.
By the time that he arrived back in Snape Manor, he was actually pretty excited about going to Hogwarts – a feeling that he lost ever since that encounter with Mrs. Malfoy.
And Harry still didn’t know what to do with it.
He finally reaches his destination, and the kitchen is prepared as he had instructed. Blinky is a good elf, attentive to the finest detail, though a tad bit snappy.
It’s late afternoon, and Draco hasn’t shown signs of leaving his stupor.
“Really? We would have been roommates.”
Draco shook his head, frustrated at himself. He hadn't gotten a wink of sleep last night, kept awake by thoughts of a madman in his home and a snake slithering in his room. His home. His family's home.
Malfoy has his back to them, and doesn’t show any sign that he heard them enter the room. Harry thinks that maybe he’s asleep, but Narcissa strides towards the balcony and Harry follows mutely, and then he sees–
On his hand, in messy black ink, were the wobbly and crooked letters forming the words
Aunt Petunia certainly never did.
What did he say to Potter again? Potter was mad. It’s been a long time since he last saw Potter that angry. He doesn’t like it. He never did like it. But he could stand it then, years ago, so why does it hurt so much now?
What did he say to Potter again?
Every cell in his body recoiled from what he was about to do. Every moral and virtue he carried lashed out in disgust, and Harry sobbed, wishing that Draco wouldn't do the same once he found out what Harry did.
him to live under the same roof as stupid Potter, but why were they treating him like… like he was something weak?
Surprisingly, all the hype about Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived, was gone after the end of the first week.  Everyone was all curious and inappropriate stares at first, but after they realized that Harry was just a plain, old, first year and wasn’t about to do cartwheels and magic tricks in front of them, they started minding their own business.
They were actually holding a
The edge of Draco's lips quirked up just a tiny bit. "We have the same reason then," he replied softly, and Harry had no idea what that meant but didn't ask because Draco had already turned away from him, very blatantly telling him that the conversation was over.
Stiffly, Harry began walking forward.
"Haven't you ever heard of the ancient tales of Merlin? Fighting dragons with a mighty sword! I'm almost jealous of you, squirt!"
Harry nodded, raising his wand as well, towards Malfoy.
He’s not supposed to let Potter borrow his quill, because now Potter doesn’t seem intent in returning it, and always uses it in class, and Draco doesn’t ask for it. (He likes seeing Potter use it.)
“I never said you were.”
Harry rolled his eyes and took it from him.
"Not really." Harry actually also thought that Durmstrang was going to win the Tournament. "I'm just really, really bad at gambling."
Draco tapped his foot.
Because there’s no one to stop him anymore. Crabbe’s dead. Goyle’s in Azkaban. Merlin, the only reason
Potter’s voice is sheepish. “I have this Map that tells me where everybody is in the castle.”
"Harry's body is rejecting everything. If it goes on for a long enough time, his body starts to reject
He made it. He was in front of the Triwizard Cup with Cedric Diggory, ready to hold it together for a Hogwarts win. It had been a grueling hour. Or was it two hours now? In that span of time, Harry had entered an odd mist, been hanged upside down, heard Fleur scream, shot an Impediment Jinx on a Blast-Ended Skrewt, answered a Sphinx's riddle, Stupefied Viktor Krum who had horrifyingly cast an Unforgivable on Cedric (They were going to have to talk to Professor Dumbledore about this one.), and defeated a giant spider.
Ginny sighs exasperatedly, crossing her arms like a petulant child. “Don’t you
Was Potter… alright?
As unimportant as the traitorously warm feeling at the pit of his stomach when Draco casually bumped against him during Potions class and slipped gillyweed in his pocket. Harry's eyes had immediately darted to Professor Snape because even
All jokes aside, however, Harry
he hissed out in Parseltongue, at the same time Myrtle cooed, “
Slowly, Severus made his way towards the door and knocked. "Harry."
He wouldn’t use it for bad stuff though. In fact, he wouldn’t use it at all.
Draco didn't leave his room. What was he supposed to say if he went to Potter's? Sorry you almost died because I was such an arse? No, he didn't know if he could say that. He
On the day of the First Task, Harry was sitting in the middle of his dorm room, alone, and currently at war with himself.
Laughter rang through the halls and made Harry's ears itch. It came from just around the corner and he almost didn't want to step forward in fear that what he might see will trigger his magic to run wild and uncontrollable again but
“I wanted to. Here, catch.” He throws the chocolate frog and is not surprised when Draco catches it easily. He grins. “Ron told me to give it to you.”
But it’s not any of his business.
That first night, after they had sent the child to bed, Sirius stayed up all night, unable to sleep, unable to keep the excitement, the relief, the
Kissing Malfoy is out of the option.
“Surprised I could do it without your help?”
Snape scowled at him, failing to see what he could be finding amusing in all of this. “He doesn’t know

Lucius Malfoy had already been sent to Azkaban since the Battle of Hogwarts, and it was quick and inevitable, and no one had argued the verdict of a life sentence—not his family, not even himself.
Deep inside, Draco knew that he was obsessing over this only as a way to distract himself from the bigger problems. The Dark Lord was alive, and he and his father had almost been murdered. He had almost

As soon as they passed through the library doors, Harry took out his quill, grabbed Draco's hand and started scribbling.
“Oof!”

“Huh,” Ginny said. “Harry can’t avoid him like a bludger now when the bludger’s got a grip on you.”

leaving me with a
And then Draco asked softly. "It's not a girl, is it?"
The next day, Harry excitedly told Severus about the cloak, but not about Sirius' note. He was sure that given the cloak's history, Remus had already informed Severus about them gifting it to Harry.
Draco quirked an eyebrow upwards, and Harry half-expected him to say something snarky or something, but when Draco simply scooted closer and grabbed his quill, Harry thought his heart would burst.
Draco blinked, taken aback with the earnest compliment. His cheeks flushed and he turned his head to the side. "Of course I am, Potter, have you learned nothing about me for the past four years?"
quiet.
Another murmur of agreement, although it was louder this time.
Harry glared.
Even more unfortunately, he was only riding a Cleansweep.
Cedric Diggory was dead. Murdered by the Dark Lord and his Death Eaters. The Wizarding World was in a state of confusion, with Dumbledore declaring that Voldemort was alive once again and Cornelius Fudge, Minister for Magic, vehemently denying it. The Triwizard Tournament was finished and Harry Potter was crowned the Champion. Durmstrang and Beauxbatons left Hogwarts shortly after, and the summer holidays began.
They didn't fly the next morning. They were both sound asleep in their respective rooms by the time 10 o'clock rolled in.
have real parents who loved him.
Brushing her hair away from her face, Hermione says seriously, “Their nibs are actually really comfortable to use.”
10 o'clock sharp at the Quidditch pitch, and then they'd go to the dining room together for lunch.
"However," Severus said. "She was thrilled to know of your presence here."
There were no graveyards and hooded figures in black.
Harry shrugged, then remembered that Theodore probably wouldn't have seen him through the dark. "Beats me."
him.”
A wave of guilt and regret gripped his chest. It wasn’t an unfamiliar sensation, but they were becoming more frequent the more of these missions they finished. They were becoming more frequent the less time Harry had left.
A low chuckle resounded in his ear.
he mouthed with a wink.
Sirius laughed harder.
Draco looks at the area labelled
Draco’s smirk widened. He sat up, bending his neck from side to side to get rid of the cricks there that had formed during his uncomfortable sleep on Harry’s small sofa. “Hmm?”
But they knew not to ask and continued to eat their meal in silence.
Kingsley had said. Firmly.
Sirius
Immediately, the warming charms of the Manor cool the ice on his skin, and he lets his shoulders sag in relief at the warmth and feeling of finally being
Needless to say, he spent the rest of the night glowering at his luck.
Harry nodded. It made him nervous, talking about this when the person he really was talking
The next day at breakfast, Ron took it upon himself to throw in more food than usual in his Harry-tray. When Harry looked at him in surprise, he merely shrugged, grinned and said, "No getting sappy on me now, mate."
He quickly regretted that decision, however, when a loud crash sounded from the second floor.
. They discussed, quipped at each other, and even civilly argued at times, but not…
It was dark. Draco couldn't really see Potter's face very well. He hadn't bothered to light the lamps. But Potter looked… like nothing had happened. No wounds. No bandages. He was even holding a tart in one hand.
When Harry returned, Draco was already gone but the Parchment still lay on the table with words on it that Harry didn't remember writing.
, Harry, I'm
The story of Severus Snape.
Harry couldn't help the answering smile that crept up on his face. "She wanted me to come up to you and kiss you."
He registers the stunned surprise colouring her face once she sees him, but he doesn’t know what he says to her, only remembers Malfoy’s name slipping through his lips, and Narcissa’s off, hurried footsteps, and then, down the hall, a turn of the knob and the creak of the door opening and the click as it closes.
Draco visibly relaxed. "Alright, then." He continued listing through the male population of Hogwarts. "Who else would hex your bits off though? I mean,
"I still don't get why the Weaslette jinxed you," Draco said the next day, peering curiously at his pudding.
Potter, at first, looked surprised at Draco's reaction, but then slowly allowed himself to grin back. "I was thinking if it would help if I testified what I saw there, but…"
To his surprise, Potter laughed. Actually
Harry sighed loudly. Draco hadn't been doing any work for the past five minutes he had been
He wasn't even sure how there was a Quidditch pitch in this place. He should ask Severus later. Or Kreacher. Kreacher seemed to be more indulgent in divulging important things.
When Harry reached the library, Draco was already there, as always.
you wanker. I'm starting to realize now that it's really just genetic, and not… well, something violent." Then he realized that he probably said something nice, so he added, "Thanks to your spineless way of avoiding things."
And no, they’re definitely not supposed to be doing this, this little tryst while everyone’s asleep, like a secret.
"Small detail," Draco agreed, rolling his finished parchment and settling it on Severus' desk. "But if you want me to compliment you that much, then you did a pretty good job, too. One might even think you're used to this kind of work."

Draco sniffed haughtily in the air. “I plan to be a great Potioneer like Uncle Severus one day, so I
The next day, Harry was already rethinking his decision. If he thought that his eight year subjects were hell, it was nothing compared to the experience of going through them when you couldn't
“There are potions, too,” Malfoy offered. “Potions to nullify magic in the body that isn’t yours, and antidotes for, let’s say, Furnunculus fall under this, but of course, nobody’s ever had to make one for a living horcrux. I understand why studies about horcruxes are so heavily guarded and forbidden, but if there was anyone you could trust in the Department of Mysteries, it just might be possible.”
He was surprised at Potter's reaction, and surprised at how
Blaise snorted. "That's easy." He pointed towards the window, which looked out into a vast darkness that was disturbed only by the occasional guppy and the occasional grindylow. The dungeons, along with the Slytherin Common Room and the Potions Classroom, were all submerged underneath the Black Lake and had sea creatures as neighbours.
What did Draco have to do then… to destroy that last bit of magic?
Ron made a strangled noise of confusion. "Not going to like who it is?" he said, looking at Harry funny. He rolled his eyes. "Come on, Harry, is that what you think of me? I think I'm perfectly capable of accepting my best mate's love interest." Then, a hilarious thought appeared in his mind and he cackled with glee. "Unless you're actually wanking to Malfoy."
Ginny merely looked at it before smiling at him charmingly. "I haven't seen Malfoy in the Great Hall either."
“All in the past,” Potter echoed thoughtfully. He glanced at Draco again, one more time, before he pushed open the bathroom door. “But I’m still sorry.”
Harry’s nose scrunched up at the thought. As a child, he had thought that vampires only fed on blood, but just like what Remus had told him once,
,” he says, breathless. He props himself up on one elbow, eyes wide. He looks back at Potter with his mouth open in amazement.
Harry's jaw dropped. He closed his mouth. It fell open again. "Wh… wh, why me?!"
Now it looked just like normal stairs, made of old and dark stone.
Draco's curiosity got the better of him. "Did you find anything?" he asked.
Draco realized that he wasn't the only one having nightmares.
He was itching for a fight.
At least he was going to see Severus in Hogwarts.
Potter looked up at him, a confused expression on his face.
It looks hideous, and he has to close his eyes and look away from the scene, from the image of Draco Malfoy falling into pieces.
And square one meant he had no idea what to do next.
The cat neared the drawer cautiously, eyes narrowed and claws protracted.
Draco froze. It was Potter. His heart hammered loudly in his chest.
Draco turns, one foot stepping in front of the other. “I’ll have you know –!” And then his knees crumple from underneath him, and Harry thanks whatever god is up there that he still has his reflexes from fighting in the war. He leaps in, catches Draco’s shoulders, but is knocked off balance by the sudden weight.
“What’s for breakfast today?” Harry asks as he pushes Draco’s wheelchair up the ramp that leads into the balcony.
Snape said nothing and glanced at Harry. He was surprised to feel a sense of possessiveness and jealousy at the way the boy was holding on to Black’s robes.
Really. Didn’t Potter understand this by now, after all their eventful years together? Draco noticed
"Don't call me that –"
. Severus Snape. Ex-Death Eater. Sent to retrieve the son of Lily Evans, the only person he ever truly loved, and James Potter, the person foremost in the list of those he truly hated.
Fleur Delacour's hot tears falling on his damp neck as she sobbed in his arms, thanking him for saving her sister.
Voldemort didn’t disappear. Or at least, his magic didn’t.
Harry figured that it was Ginny's that had hit him and knocked him off his broom.
"When can I go back to the Manor with you?"
Back then, the bank had been barren with snow, but now it was covered with thick and tall weeds, some as high as one’s ankle… except for one spot. There, just in front of the mouth of the lake, at the spot where Ron had driven the Godric Gryffindor’s sword through the locket, grew nothing.
made sense. "Uhm, alright."
“No. Not really.”
And then one day, Draco wakes up, and the room is empty, like how it’s been empty for the past three months, until he realizes it’s not empty after all, and there’s Potter suddenly in the middle of the room, all pink cheeks and sheepish smile and everything that Draco’s not supposed to have.
“Malfoy!”
Theodore waved a hand in greeting as Draco neared them but didn’t pause in his conversation with Harry. “—Viktor Krum probably for Durmstrang. Any bets for Hogwarts?”
Draco’s ears flushed red. He opened his mouth to speak but Blaise cut him off.
Harry couldn't resist his eyelids fluttering closed or the sound of pure contentment that rose from him as Draco pressed their lips together for the second time. He hovered there, as if hesitant, but Harry pressed back eagerly and the moment's hesitation was gone.
Accepting his tendency to spit mashed food out whilst speaking was another thing.
Severus Snape's immobile body floated just a few meters away from him.
An hour into detention, Harry had already finished cleaning six out of eight cupboards and Draco had finished the inventory of four.
"Take care of my mother,” Malfoy says, the smile not quite reaching his eyes anymore. “It seems she's taken a liking to you. See you later, Potter."
But no. That was impossible.
Harry could admit that he was more irritated with Draco than Kingsley. But he was most irritated with himself for being irritated with Draco over something so embarrassingly childish, especially since he was Head Auror and Head Aurors are supposed to be mature and serious and understanding that some missions dealing with pure blood magic needed pure blooded wizards to work on them.
Harry ate his queen, slamming his knight down a little bit louder than was necessary. "I don't know about you, but I have a low tolerance for being incapacitated."
When they pulled apart, Draco growled softly against Harry’s lips. “
Remus smiled to himself at the scene the two were making. The house was going to be a lot quieter now without Harry around. Of course Sirius would still make it a point to blow things up around Grimmauld and make a racket, just to spite his mother’s portrait, but it was still different having a child’s laughter ring around the halls.
"Fina-fucking-lly," he muttered, pulling at his broom to sweep downwards.
He suddenly felt very sad.
Narcissa nodded. "After this, I'm taking you to Paris with me."
Remus smiled wider. “Well, you can keep it.”
He looked back up at the boy’s face and saw the winning smile there.
It was Harry's turn to be gobsmacked.
"You better be grateful Dumbledore cancelled the Quidditch Cup this year!" Draco scowled, still glaring at him with a finger tapping at Harry's chest. "I'll be captain next year, and you're joining the team, got it?"
“Voldemort’s magic wasn’t in the Forbidden Forest, as I had thought. Or.” He frowned. “
Harry heard "
Draco already knew what was coming.
Explaining to him why being under the sun didn’t hurt anymore was something exponentially more difficult.
Draco continued on obliviously. "You can also use a Bubblehead Charm, but that's less efficient. Gillyweed will let you breathe underwater for an hour, swim like a fish, and even enhance your vision so you'll be able to navigate the Lake faster."
The corner of Severus' lips quirked up, but the humor did not reach his eyes.
,” he says, voice trembling. “You don’t get to say it first.”
“I’ve never had anyone worry for me like that before,” he admitted, fidgeting under Harry’s gaze even though Draco was easily the taller one. “It was…” he swallowed, feeling his cheeks slowly warm. “It was nice, okay?” he grumbled out.
Because at the end of the day, they’re
Draco fulfilled it without preamble, thinking of just how it was possible that Harry did not know that Draco did when Harry's the one that's basically occupied Draco's mind since first year.
"But you don't trust them either, do you, Potter?" he snarled, shoving Potter away. His eyes felt dangerously hot. And wet.
“Must be your imagination.”
And Ginny bursts into laughter and Harry laughs along with her as Ron’s face turns as red as his hair, and it’s definitely new, this dynamic among them.
“I’m done, by the way,” Theodore said with a sigh. “I don’t know about you.”
St. Mungo’s. Or worse.
The three men gave him everything he needed – even things he was too shy to ask for.
“Alright, so it wasn’t one of my brightest ideas ever,” Ron admitted after Dean had arrived to pick his whimpering boyfriend up with an embarrassed apology and a resigned sigh. He and Harry stood in front of the fireplace, looking at the spot where Seamus and Dean stood just a few seconds ago.
“I know, I know. Malfoy already gave me the same lecture. I was… I was going to ask for help, after I tried the Forest first.”
Harry had the gall to look surprised! As if he didn't expect Draco to come after him. Soon enough, the surprise gave way to an expression of mixed regret and embarrassment.
Harry nodded patiently, heart beating furiously in his chest. “No, it isn’t. It’s my Christmas gift to you.”
He’s seen it on himself.
Then he turned and briskly walked away.
," he rasped out, and it sounded painful to his ears. His throat hurt, after having not spoken in a long time, but Harry forced it to anyway because he needed to say this, needed to tell Draco.
. And Voldemort’s Crucios had been particularly special, as it always made the Mark hurt more than the rest of his body, as if reminding him—
Draco turns to him, glaring, but he still looks pale and tired and despite what a git Draco’s being, Harry can’t help but be worried.
Potter finally,
"What, so it's
The cat probably thought it was Ron’s fault that Harry’s mood had soured.
It was at that moment that Draco Malfoy walked in with a slight limp and a cringe marring his features. It should be embarrassing how suddenly Harry found himself very worried.
Beside him, Potter was seated on a stool at his bedside and Draco wondered if the sight would become a frequent one during the remainder of their mission.
He quite liked the feel of Draco's pulse underneath his fingers though. And how Draco's eyes, bright, widened almost imperceptibly as he stared at the messy handwriting on his pale skin.
, Harry!" from girls that made him flush to the tip of his ears.
Harry frowned.
Snape stared dumbly at the white paint of the door, mind working furiously at the implications of what Petunia had said. No papers.
Astoria nods. “How you tried to help him back in the summer.” Pink dusts her cheeks, and she shakes her head. “I’m sorry, we weren’t gossiping or anything–“
“Ah. I’m afraid painted pastries don’t quite capture the flavors I’m looking for,” Dumbledore said sadly. “It’s a curse.”
Draco clears his throat loudly. He hopes the dark is doing its job covering his burning face. “Alright, so you didn’t see me in the Map, and assumed that I was in the Forest?”
He thinks he should be embarrassed that his friends know what’s going on between him and Draco. Or that they know that
tried to kiss him.
“Malfoy, we don’t…” He paused, frowning. He waited for Malfoy to look at him, before starting again. “We don’t know exactly if it’ll work. And we don’t know what’ll happen if you…”
, Harry thought cheerily.
Draco looks at him wearily, as if he’s weighing whether he should agree to engage in civil conversation with him. In the end, he sighs and talks. “It’s… hazy. But I still know what’s happening. Sometimes. Don’t think I didn’t see you wiping my face like a child, Potter. Don’t ever do that again.”
tasting it first, not me,” said Gary Oldmoore.
And then, as always, he is the first to spot that blond hair.
Ron rolled his eyes. "I mean, the lucky girl?"
Draco took the seat across from him, in front of the desk.
Draco was convinced this man was a keeper.
“Harry’s heart’s always coming from the right place, for sure,” Rosmerta said with a laugh. “Kingsley’s as well, but well, you know how our wee little hearts go,” she hummed, returning back to her paperwork and continuing to comment, but this time, as if to herself.
Severus raised an eyebrow. "What about me?"
wanting to spill from his lips.
Draco furrows his eyebrows at him, and then at the pancakes on the table. It takes a while for him to respond, but his eyes clear and he says, “Get your filthy fingers off my pancakes.”
that Draco had to give his blood, yes, but after having gone through it twice, Draco realized that most of his worries about it had just been from preconceived notions about vampirism, mostly gotten from his mother. Madame Pomfrey was right: It didn't hurt.
“Alright, then just. Lie down. I’m sick of seeing you on a chair with that terrible posture.”
“Narcissa.” Another smile.
Through the years, it was inevitable that Harry would keep on coming back to memories of the war and Horcrux hunting, and those times were never pleasant, but more than once, yes, Harry
, and you –” he said, glancing at Harry from the corner his eye. “— are not merely
He had been allowed to sleep back in his dorm on the condition that he go straight to Madame Pomfrey in the morning for her to check on him. His parents, after having agreed that Draco was to stay with Severus for the summer holidays, left after dinner with Professor Dumbledore on some… business, they called it.
He was used to saying pretty words that he didn’t mean just to get others to like him, but this was different. Harry had told him all about his parents six hours into meeting each other, mainly due to Draco’s persuasion and curiosity, and the longing on Harry’s face when he related the story made Draco want to make him feel better.
It was a crimson tome, lined with golden text that read:
“He’s my
When the 31
"Unhappily pining over a love that may not be as unrequited as you think," Ginny added, a true smile gracing her features. "Where's that Gryffindor courage?"
startled him. Potter had repeatedly mentioned taking him off the mission in many different ways. He had said it as a light-hearted joke, as a threat, and even as a promise, so Draco didn't really take him seriously when he said it now, but the conversation had taken such an abrupt turn that he blurted out, “Why?”
The next day, Harry comes and Draco’s already in the middle of the garden, his wheelchair forgotten a distance away among a shrub of pink carnations.
Madame Pomfrey nodded in understanding. "That's expected. Tell me immediately if you feel something else." After Draco nodded, she wiped her apron down and turned to leave. "Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to tend to… ah, some other things."
Potter didn’t reply, and the lack of fight extinguished all of Draco’s willpower to continue the argument. “Sod off it, Potter. It happened. It’s done. I’m alive, and we learned something valuable that you can report to your merry team.”
On his good days, he liked to think of how good his self-control was that he hadn't done any of the two yet. On his bad days, he'd look back on his life choices and wonder what he did to deserve falling in love with possibly the most infuriating (but also undeniably the most gorgeous, most hard-working, most dedicated and most hilarious) man in the whole world.
It made Draco's lips quirk up in amusement.
"But," Draco said, incredulous as to why his father wasn't throwing a fit yet and why this all seemed fine and dandy to Severus and the Headmaster of Hogwarts. "But he's biting
Actually, no, it was Ginny's fault, but really.
And he doesn’t know if it’s because it’s the first time he’s managed to stop himself from falling in the rabbit hole his mind has made, or if it’s because of the pride in Potter’s eyes as he looks at him, or Potter wanting to stay with him, that he finds his eyes becoming warm.
It was raised in the air, and then above and inside the cauldron, and then the hooded figure was speaking, its voice trembling with what sounded like both fear and excitement.
Harry looks up from his book.
That really wasn’t Draco’s point.
Dumbledore sighed sadly. “It is only during the academic months. The boy will be with you during the Christmas holidays and during summer vacation, but when you are fulfilling your obligations and earning your keep here in Hogwarts, I found it best to request the assistance of the boy’s godfather.”
“Did you have a good sleep?”
“That’s… awfully friendly.”
For the first time since he had taken it upon himself to complete this mission, Harry found himself admitting, with his eyes wet and his voice breaking,
blood? He could…
As quickly and as quietly as he could, Draco scrambled up to his feet and followed him, making sure to stay at least ten footsteps behind him. He was right to have cast muffling charms on his shoes earlier.
"Because he will be with me."
At that, Draco leans back in his chair, studying him.
The look that Potter gave him was of pure guilt and misery when he said, “Three days.”
“No. We’re not in the Manor anymore. You don’t have to keep any more favours for my mother. You’ve done your part.”
My internship is done, so now I can focus on this ;; I am so sorry for the very late update, as I had to keep on putting it off because of life huhu crey. But I should have more time to write now, so I hope you're still with me in this! :D
"But you have nothing to worry about now that you've absolutely charmed them after the First Challenge! Take Astoria, for example. Ever since this little party began, she's been…" She glared at a spot behind Harry with a scowl. "
Draco rolls his eyes and sits down on the edge of his bed. He pulls the plate closer towards him. “Distracting me with childhood stories in a bid to make me fat, are you?”
“Great. Splendid. Now, will that be all?” Draco turns away, ready to leave.
“You asked about the last horcrux,” he said, his voice a hollow sound even to his own ears.
"Besides," Theodore continued. "If you die, you get to haunt Hogwarts forever like the Bloody Baron! Doesn't that sound like a lot of –"
Ludo Bagman had put a Sonorus Charm on himself and was announcing something about the standings and how that would decide the order the Champions would enter the Maze.
On the day that they were to go to Hogwarts, Draco entered the living room, dressed in trousers, robes, and boots, to see Potter in his pajamas. He was playing Wizard's Chess with Kreacher. Kreacher was muttering things about needing to clean and Master Potter keeping him from his job, but he was actually doing a fine job obliterating Potter's pieces.
going to buy for Draco. Quills were too impersonal, a broomstick might be too much, he didn’t know Draco’s sizes to buy him clothing, sweets wouldn’t do unless they were from Mademoiselle Coco’s in France.
Hermione's eyebrow remained lifted, a reminder that the only reason why she has stopped nagging him about forgoing his manly pride and going on his hands and knees to beg Ginny for mercy was his assurance that his grades would not suffer because of his condition.
The hat was placed over his eyes and a voice boomed in his head.
Surprise paints Draco’s face, and it makes him look innocent, eyes wide open and eyebrows raised. After a while, Draco returns to his pancakes and says, without looking up, “Yeah, whatever, Potter. Do what you want.”
“Oh.” The furrow deepens. There is a frown on his face, as he slowly looks at the marble floor, the white pillars, the white ledge of the balcony, and the garden. He looks at the table, his lap. His eyes widen, and then he takes a big, shaky breath. “
Harry’s eyes widened.
, he was about to say, but he wasn't sure whether he believed that completely.
There wasn’t anything that required Potter to stay with him now that the current mission was completed, other than perhaps a misplaced sense of obligation to his partner?
That was the first time he realized that the Wizarding World was not very accepting of vampires.
“Good morning,” Draco whispers, a small smile on his thin lips. The adoration on his face is clear as day, and Harry is grateful that it is still there even after five years.
are indebted to you.”
It’s a big garden, more spacious than Draco’s room. The flora is lush, rich, and neatly trimmed, and colour blooms in every corner. There are roses, and lilies, and forget-me-nots. Carnations and lavender. In the middle of the garden stands a fountain, water dripping down the marble eyes of the woman standing proudly at the centre of it. The snakes on her head had told Harry who she is since day one.
Maybe it was the fame from the Triwizard Tournament getting to his head and giving him an unnecessary confidence that Harry forgot himself enough to say, carefree and earnest and with a laugh, "Merlin, I missed your whining."
Thus started his Plan to Get Harry Potter for real.
Harry relaxes, now that he’s forgiven. The guilt recedes into something less piercing. “Well, to be honest,” he replies, trying to look wistful. “I kinda expected you’d be nicer after you got out.”
Before Harry could contemplate this anymore, the sound of water rushing from behind him made him turn his head right in time to see a huge shark zoom by him. This huge shark had a human body. A rather buff human body.
He picked it up, eyebrows furrowed together. “This isn’t wine.”
Draco's eyebrow quirked up in amusement.
“Nuh-uh,” he tutted when Harry flushed and tried to duck his head.
“Have the letters convinced you to leave me alone?”
From the window of his laboratory, Snape looked pretty smug with himself.
Draco almost started his 'what did I say about sparing me from your horrid handwriting?' speech when he realized that Harry wasn't taking out any parchment. Instead, Harry directed the sharp nub of his quill to the table and slowly carved out a word.
Draco stared at it too. "You really are daft," he murmured. His old wand lay beside the parchment, forgotten, and Harry gently pushed it towards him, urging him to take it and
flying. It sometimes made him fidgety that he couldn't – wouldn't allow himself to – fly while he was in Hogwarts. High up in the air, ten feet above the dragon, he took a deep, calming breath. The crisp, fresh air of the mountains surrounding Hogwarts felt like healing balm on his sore throat.
to help him.
Draco doesn’t know how to answer that, but he nods anyway. He will be.
Harry knew that he wasn't going to get any answers from Severus. The man, despite being a Slytherin, was still a very strict professor and never once showed any favouritism towards Harry in all his years as his student. Snape wouldn't give him anything that would give him an unfair advantage in the Tournament.
Harry cringed at the prospect.
He had a feeling that even if he passed an essay that was two feet shorter than the requirement, Slughorn would probably pass him or something, but Hermione probably wouldn't be too happy about that.
Potter rolls his eyes and takes his arm, pulls it over his shoulder. Once again, they’re pressed together, which is just as well, because Draco’s knees buckle.
Harry feels his own face heating up.
But by the time they’ve finished eating their breakfast, he is gone again.
Draco opened his eyes to Potter’s worried ones. Potter was sitting on a stool next to his bed, leaning over him. Belatedly, he took note of the night sky outside the window behind Potter’s head. “How long was I out?”
“He did,” Kinglsey retorted loudly from inside the office.
Draco had been under it far too many times, and he
Through the pain, Harry forced his eyes open, screamed in terror as Cedric Diggory fell to the ground, dead just like that. He tried to leap towards Cedric, but hands grabbed his shoulders and shoved him on the nearest tombstone, and then ropes were slithering and pulling across his body to keep him there.
is real, but he feels like crying.
"Teach me the Corkscrew Dive," he said, instead. Awkwardly. "And I'll let you off the gillyweed."
. He had no idea how to take care of a child.
Of course, it always needed to involve Harry Potter.
Harry grins at him. “I told him I didn’t want to be put here.”
"Still not going to tell me who did it?" she asked calmly.
, he wrote then quickly gathered the books in his arms before rushing towards the shelves, leaving Draco to stare, baffled, at the Parchment.
syrup at the corner of his mouth.
One of the hooded figures broke free of the circle that they had formed around Voldemort. He threw himself on the ground, on Voldemort's feet, sobbing, worshipping, "Forgive us, master!"
my room, Potter.”
“How am I supposed to eat them when you shove them in your mouth the first chance you get? Fucking manners, Potter.”
The guilt was still alive up to this day, sharp and raw.
Harry called for the fifth time, his voice muffled by the fact that he had his nose and lips pressed against the door to Draco’s room. He pulled back and pressed his ear next.
“Don’t call me that.” Harry glares. It’s getting harder to stay calm when Draco’s so decided to be an asshole. “Look, Malfoy, there’s no deeper, ulterior motive to this. Can’t we just. I don’t know, be friends?”
And it definitely won’t work out, this thing between them, and this Draco believes most on days that they quarrel, because Draco said something bad about Weasley, or Draco said something bad about himself, and Potter’s just in one of his usual, grumbling, withdrawn moods that usually has him snapping at everyone within three feet radius and has them saying things that they don’t mean.
"Sorry," Draco whispered, his breath ghosting against Harry's lips. He blinked his eyes rapidly to fight back the tears and swallowed to push his heart back down from his throat. "Sorry, I'll fix that," he muttered, his voice breaking off at the end once again.
Harry didn't listen to Slughorn at all during that lesson. He didn't mean to really, but he guessed it was okay, because that meant he can ask Draco about it later.
Draco sighs tiredly, one hand rubbing at his
And Draco thought that this morning
Harry looks at that small frame—those sharp elbows digging into his knees and his thin wrists hiding little of the stream of tears on his face crumpled in despair and agony. The line of his back hunched over on the wheelchair, with his shoulder blades jutting so sharply out, Harry’s almost scared that it’ll tear his skin.
Still, he found himself relaxing against the chair, the silence of the library and Malfoy's breathing lulling him into calmness. He'd start whenever another shrill scream of his name would resound from below, but otherwise kept his eyes on the text in front of him.
The boy started at the question, blinking at Snape in surprise. Then, he looked at his hands and started uncurling them one by one, hesitating when he reached the sixth. He stopped after the seventh finger and showed them off to Snape. “Seven,” he said quietly.
Ten minutes later, Lavender was finally deposited into the Girls' Dormitories by a well-said threat from Hermione. Ginny finally snapped out of her stupor and proceeded to hop around the room sideways in joy.
He found himself in the Slytherin Common Room, desperate for some familiarity and comfort. He half hoped that Potter would be there, but to his disappointment, only the empty couches greeted him when he entered.
Remus shivered from the cold both outside and within him.
Draco had started on a new book titled Potions, Jinxes and Hexes: Laws of Attraction. It was definitely not about love magic. He had been sitting there for the past half hour already and hadn't quite gotten past the third sentence of the first page yet, but he kept his eyes firmly on the paper and not on the shelves where Harry usually appeared from with a shy grin and a tray of breakfast.
As they got nearer, Blaise showed off his ring with a similar grin. "I just said it was terrible. Didn't say I disliked it."
, he wrote on the Self-Erasing Parchment.
With a strangled, choking noise, Draco nodded and curled his fingers around his wand.
The retching had stopped. A quiet lulled in the room. Now, Draco could only hear soft heaves of breath from inside the bathroom.
Maybe he'd have time to figure it out, if Potter would stop being such a wuss and face him. Maybe Draco really would feel better after a hex or two. He wouldn't do anything that would seriously
“Mm-hmm. Yes, you did,” Draco replied helpfully, looking down at Harry with amusement on his face. He raised his arms up above him to stretch them, and Harry sat still, unable to resist being awed by the grace of Draco’s movements.
Harry’s first drawing of a dog included a messily scribbled ‘SIRIUS’ on the side.
"Old habits die hard," Draco replied with a wry smile.
Draco didn't understand a damn thing that Madame Pomfrey was saying.
Draco nodded excitedly. “I’d like that, when we’re done with the tour,” he said, and, without missing a beat, followed up on his question. “What about blood?” he asked, curious eyes boring into Harry’s. “Do you feel like sucking my blood right now?”
He woke up to Severus entering the room. The smell of Potter told him that he was still lying on Potter's bed, in Potter's room. But Potter was nowhere in sight. He groaned, sitting up, and accepted the vial Severus offered him.
“It’s not
And the green fire went out, to be promptly replaced by normal fire with its orange heat and flames – which did nothing to warm the cold that started to seep in Harry's chest.
Draco's lips curled upwards. "We're not allowed to eat in the library," he said amusedly.
Grinning, Harry just rolled his eyes and took out his quill.
And Harry realizes that Draco remembers him, remembers a lot more about him, if he’s going to go back to old habits and his usual snark. He feels unbearably happy at that.
"Well, how does it work?"
Sirius actually looked disappointed.
“Good. Now, I don’t want you near that boy again, do you hear me? Merlin knows you might have gotten his
“Where are we, Potter?”
“Oof!” he exclaims, at the same time a quiet, lilting voice says, “Harry?”
Harry divided his attention between Bagman's words and his surroundings. The stands were filled with students and banners of different sizes and colors. The Hogwarts' side was divided into colors of green and yellow, with the latter occupying considerably more space. There were so many people that Harry didn't even try to look for that specific blond hair anymore.
"Why do you care?" was Draco's stiff reply, almost bitter.
“No, I mean—” Potter shook his head, closing his eyes. “I’m not sure… if we’ll be able to destroy the magic.”
When he finally mustered the courage, he looked up at Draco and he had already stepped one step forward to make sure if the other was okay – but Draco was looking at him with wide eyes and a set jaw and he looked… torn?
He knew there was no snot. It was just Theodore Nott’s kind way of telling him that he had been crying.
That was a familiar face.
That had Harry smiling in spite of himself. Always trust Sirius to cheer him up. "Yes, I'm sure, Sirius."
Harry shot her a wary look.
There, in the corner of his room near the window, was a slightly thick wooden stick that shot up straight and then curled horizontally as it neared the end.
Draco looks at him disbelievingly. “You went to the Forbidden Forest on a
“You’re coming back, aren’t you?”
Right. They were on a mission. And Malfoy would probably be the one doing most of the work in these missions.
Harry's fingers hurt from writing so fast but Ron shut up and Harry finished his breakfast in peace, with Ron only muttering about Malfoy from time to time.
She yelped and retreated, and Theodore took his rightful place with a smirk.
Narcissa gives him another smile, and it’s a little relieved, and real. “Nonsense, Harry. We’re the ones imposing.”
.” Her wide eyes stared into his wildly. “Give me a moment,” she muttered before closing the door in his face.
Draco Malfoy woke up in cold sweat inside the Hospital Wing to bright sunlight and birds chirping. As if Lord Voldemort had not risen from the dead. As if Draco hadn't been bitten by Voldemort's humongous pet snake. As if he hadn't been bitten by
Potter raised a hand to stave off his complaints. “We need time to analyze the data we collected. And
all the time.
“He was probably scared that someone else might get to you first, like, I don’t know, maybe a Weasley.” Blaise sniggered, as did Crabbe and Goyle.
He had no idea how to take care of another human being, much less a child that had no nuance of what the world had in store for him.
“Hermione’s pregnant.”
wouldn't be exempt from Professor Snape's fury when he found out that his inventory didn't match up. Fortunately, Professor Snape didn't seem to have noticed Draco's sticky fingers with all the students clamouring all over the shelves gathering ingredients for their Girding Potions.
Harry knows. He glares at the fourth year Ravenclaws on the other table whispering just a tad bit too loudly. With a sigh, he turns back to Astoria. “Hi, Astoria. You’re Daphne’s sister.”
He wrote on the Self-Erasing Parchment.
Draco shook his head. "Other than my head, no. My neck feels a bit itchy."
Ron looks away, ears red and muttering, “Give the other one to Malfoy. Merlin knows he needs more fat under those robes of his.”
Draco pushed the feelings down. His father fought for him. Lucius almost died going against the Dark Lord.
"In these dark times, Draco… You would do well not to trust anyone."
As he counted the days off the calendar, it was like
Shards of rocks exploded and fell from the sky. Harry could already hear it, through the hundreds of high-pitched screams of old souls, Malfoy’s own screams of terror, and this time he could
"Well," came Malfoy's drawl. "Seems like everyone wants to get a piece of our Savior," he said softly, but the edge of his lips twitched upwards in amusement.
Harry already knew that much before they had even started this string of missions, but each mission just had them digging up more and more memories of the past, so much memories that Harry was surprised that they hadn’t reverted back to their old, younger selves. They hadn’t even argued once. Of course, Harry knew most if not all of the ways that he had changed over the passage of time and should have expected that Malfoy went through all those changes, too.
of this was okay, but he gripped his wand steady again nonetheless.
Snape had prepared for it, cakes and gifts and balloons and all. In fact, he may have overdone it. He didn’t know how children’s birthdays went. His own last one had been filled with fake smiles and strangers who either pinched his cheeks or looked disapprovingly at him.
He’s still lying vertically on the bed, turned to his side, watching the ribbons of names glide over the Map. Potter didn’t go back to the other bed anymore and had settled for lying down horizontally, just below the pillows. His thigh is just above Draco’s head.
He would save Draco, every time, again and again if he had to.
But as the child grew older, it was getting harder and harder to cover up his many peculiarities: the prominent canines, the abnormal clearness of his vision during blackouts, the quick disappearance of wounds and bruises overnight…
Once the amazement of seeing a dragon wore off, the gravity of the situation seemed to fall on the others. They all seemed a little paler, even Viktor.
to tell them now.
Harry nods, shame making his cheeks burn at how he just simply turned tail and ran from the Manor. “Thanks, Ron.”
Draco clung hard to the memory of his time in the Manor, during the war, to the searing pain on his arm day in and day out, to the fear of failing his mission and waking up one morning to the corpses of his mother and father, to the resentment that bred in him with each passing day that monster and his serpent walked the halls of his home…
Lupin’s eyes widened once more. “You finished…?”
But true to Severus' word, there was Potter, flying like he owned the place. Like he'd been flying since he learned how to walk and just lied about not being good at it in all of their flying lessons with Madame Hooch.
The girl standing beside him made a noise of agreement. Harry noticed the same badge on her collar. She smiled sweetly and batted her eyelashes at him.
Draco was looking paler than ever, and he looked at Harry with wide eyes, shocked and a little – scared…?
It’s always because of Potter.
He relaxes, assured that Draco’s safe and that he’s coming back to Hogwarts after all. He knocks on the door, but that’s the only courtesy he’s willing to offer because he slides the door open immediately after anyway.
“I’m not,” Harry says, walking out of the balcony and into the garden. There are butterflies flying around. He doesn’t know if they’re real or magicked. “At least now I don’t have to push you around. You were getting heavy.”
Did this man want to hurt him as well?
“I did. She said it was fine, since it’s winter break, anyway. There’s not a lot of students left in the castle. Besides,” Potter said with a grin. “A room blowing up isn’t an unusual occurrence here in Hogwarts.”
Another day later, Harry wanted to scream.
It was on the night of the 15th of December that the cat appeared on Harry's window sill, meowing so shrilly and raking its nails on the glass as if it had done something to personally insult him.
Narcissa’s tone as she said her next words were sharp and final. “You will not be friends with a
For a while, Draco remained silent, frowning at the Parchment. Harry almost thought that he was mad at him or something. Finally, Draco looked away, and returned to his book. "Whatever, Potter," he muttered stiffly, but his ears were pink and Harry was smiling.
Let them argue about where Draco was going to stay this summer.
"Good on you, Harry!"
Draco stared at her. What was… What was she trying to say?
Harry doesn’t know yet if he likes that parallel.
, despite the potion that the nurse had given him, and he wasn’t sure if it was because of the Crucio-like curse or the smell of the hospital bedsheets still lingering in his nose.
That wasn’t part of Sirius’ plans or dreams for the child.
“It was probably either Sir Potter’s cat or Draco Malfoy,” Frank Hartsman supplied from his cubicle helpfully.
That was why when his father came to him and told him that his mother had finally agreed with Draco's living arrangements for the holidays, he had no more complaints to give.
Harry blinked at him.
It wasn't that Draco had
Surprise flitted over Draco's expression when he saw Harry standing just a few feet away from him, looking flustered and mussed and wind-blown. He blinked at the books in Harry's arms. "Potter," he greeted, slowly, almost cautiously.
For the first time that morning, Harry opens his eyes, lets the light fill it, lets Draco’s dazzling smile be the first thing he sees.
Harry recalls what it feels like. The sinking feeling of dread and death, all the warmth seeping out from his fingertips, as if the blood in his veins is slowly turning to ice. He holds his breath, scared to ask. “Did they…”
He'd take what he could.
And that's when the effects of time travel really hit him.
Harry motioned towards the wand and tried to smile, to show that he was giving it back with no hard feelings and no strings attached.
Fleur slipped a hand into the bag, and she let out a small sound of surprise. When she took out her hand, a small green dragon had curled its tail around her thumb. Around the dragon's neck hung a small necklace with a wooden peg, where the number 2 was written.
Potter stood up and rolled his eyes, but the smile remained on his face. "Apology accepted, Malfoy. Now get up and let's eat dinner. Kreacher's sick with worry about his beloved
Harry snapped out of his stupor. He inhaled deeply to slow down the beating of his heart. "In three weeks."
“Just one more thing. How are you, Draco?” Kingsley asked, slipping into a more casual tone. He looked genuinely concerned, which Draco honestly felt was more than he deserved. “No ill and lasting effects?”
He scans the Great Hall, but sees nothing out of the ordinary. It’s already late in the morning, and so the Great Hall is not as crowded as it usually is during meals. Students mill around and groups of friends cluster together in chitchat and laughter. He turns back to his own friends. “I don’t see it.”
“Or sad that you couldn’t show off your hero complex and tell the world how you helped an ex-Death Eater walk again?”
“I can, but you’re already here, you might as well be of
The old woman looked straight at him though and Harry almost reached up to smooth his bangs down over his scar.

." He paused, and then added, "And I'd have probably put yours in too."
He stares at her, unsure of what to make of her words and her expression.
shouldn't have counted on Dumbledore or Snape being able to save his life before it was too late.
Severus was updating Draco on what had transpired while he was asleep while Lucius and Dumbledore talked quietly a few feet away from them, when Narcissa burst into the room in a flurry of blond hair and white robes.
(but as if that's ever stopped him), Draco would never know, but when Harry opened his mouth again, Draco quickly cut him off.
It was the first time he saw the boy cry.
Malfoy grabbed his collar, and Harry let him, staring into bright, burning eyes.
Harry grinned at him. “Hasn’t skinned you yet.”
Well, okay, not really. It was really Ginny's entire fault.
They never once took him outside to meet with other people.
The only ones left to inherit the house now was his mother and… him. Unless Bellatrix Lestrange and Sirius Black miraculously escaped Azkaban.
Hagrid was probably in his hut. Filch was probably lurking somewhere. But Draco didn't really fancy seeing any of them right now, or ever.
From his position sitting on the carpet, even Ron stopped writing his Potions' essay and looked at him with expectation like a child waiting for his gifts on Christmas.
Harry is stunned at the sudden outburst, and it does a lot for him to pull the lever down on his temper.
Even his scar was starting to hurt a bit or maybe that was just his imagination.
Realization crossed Harry’s face.
“What happened to your face?”
Potter whips his head back to look at him, stunned and hurt at his admission. “Why would you–“
Draco scoffed, rolling his eyes. He had thought as much. Potter was surprisingly and stupidly hard on himself. "You're a
It was on the seventh day, a week after the Jinx first hit him, when Lavender Brown decided she couldn't take it anymore.
“You cannot possibly be thinking of submerging a
“Not good.”
in his ear, he wouldn’t have heard even if Snape spoke in his normal volume.
Ron turns his horrified expression her way. “You
And that was all Harry could take – his feet decided the rest for him. His legs took him away, and he was so intent on leaving and never looking back that he almost didn't hear Draco say his name.
Draco was quiet when they arrived back in the Black ancestral home. Severus had taken him via Side-Along Apparition once more. He felt like he was in a trance. Like he wasn't really living this reality. Dimly, Draco noticed that Potter was in the living room, sitting on the couch, in the same place he had been when they left. He was in his usual day clothes, soft trousers and a shirt, and he was reading a book.
Harry started, snapped out of his stupor. He blinked at Draco, and smiled sheepishly. "Not really."
At least it was a step up from choking on his own saliva.
Potter rolls his eyes. There’s a smile on his lips and a twinkle in his eyes, like a promise of something fun. “No, Malfoy.”
Harry wrenched his gaze away, running a hand down his face. He shot Malfoy an apologetic smile. “Sorry. I haven’t been here since, well, you know. It’s kind of a shock that it still somehow looks the same, with just a lot more weeds, I guess.”
“You’re a vampire, aren’t you?”
"Lunch shall be at noon. Dinner is at 6. If you want a snack, call for Kreacher."
Half of him hoped that Draco would be blunt and brutal.
However, with Severus' announcement, Draco's head raised a bit.
I mean, I've no problem with you liking blokes – really, I had my guesses when you dumped Gin –" Harry's glare was ignored. "But really.
To lessen their boredom and keep themselves awake during his class, they counted all of his quirks and their repetitions. The twitch in his eye, his stuttering, his speech blocks, even the times when his turban would ‘move’. Sometimes Harry thought that Pansy was just imagining the movement of the turban but wouldn’t say anything when she’d write a line on her parchment.
Sirius matched his grin. “’Atta boy.” He ruffled his hair again. “Write lots!”
“Magical reactions are usually two-way, as I’m sure you know,” he started. “I get hit with Crucio, and the location gets blown to bits.”
sound like those things.
Decisively, Harry collected both of the books under his arm with a satisfied smile and set off to finding the damned cat so that they could drop by the Quidditch supply store for one more gift and then finally go home.
"Is Severus telling you anything?"
“Please.”
Harry was startled, realizing for the first time that someone else was in the infirmary, but his surprise did not compare to the blood-chilling shockhe felt when he saw just
Harry had half a mind to give Draco the biggest hug ever, but figured that the boy wouldn't appreciate it very much, coming from him. He couldn't help smiling big and beaming though, even after they had already cleaned the table up.
Harry felt humbled, and ducked his head to hide the redness of his cheeks. He shrugged self-consciously.
Despite all the fuss he makes out of it, Harry cooks for him still anyway because he knows that Draco, privately, appreciates the thought behind doing the "menial stuff" for each other. (The sap.)
Harry grumbles, but allows her to lead him away.
Harry felt like he owed some kind of wizarding debt to him, or he just couldn't help playing the hero once more and saving the disgraced victim of the war.
And brings all remnants of Voldemort with him.
“No,” Malfoy replied immediately, scrunching his nose before trying to school his features into something more casual. “It’s just… peculiar to see it moving. I can feel it, too. A bit. It’s bizarre.”
His vision’s starting to go dim at the edges again.
The mistletoe worked! The Snitch worked! Harry’s plan worked!
In that situation, why would he…" He trailed off, frustrated. He racked his brain for everything he knew about vampires. "Was it because he couldn't help it? I mean, I was… I was bleeding a lot…" He stopped, not wanting to imagine it again.
And so became of Harry’s new life in this magical new world.
Draco swallowed. Potter was
on the Self-Erasing Parchment. Hell, he doubted
He did. He
A sharp intake of breath.
As if he doesn’t have the Mark on his arm still.
"I don't believe Voldemort wanted for you to die, I believe he wanted…" Severus trailed off, pausing. "I believe he wanted to preserve you."
He just wanted to know where Potter was. Wanted to give him a good scolding in the morning and possibly guilt-trip him into an even bigger debt, on top of that gillyweed. And he didn't like people keeping things from him, things he wanted to know.
The Head Auror in Harry had agreed then, but right now, lounging on his couch in his flat during his day off, the Head Auror in him was nowhere to be found and all that was present was moping and restless Harry who had been distracted during that meeting with the shock of Draco having another partner other than him after two years. It didn't even matter that the arrangement was just for that single mission or that the 'other partner' was his best mate, because
“Well, I don’t, now go away. Go back to your girlfriend. I’m sure she’s waiting for you.”
Harry tried to ignore the heat in his cheeks. "Sod off, Nott."
Draco's eyebrow quirked up at the rude gesture, but Harry just eased back into his chair to get more comfortable.
"He's the
Harry sighs and reaches for a napkin. “You’re the one who should wipe the syrup off your face,” he mutters and gently dabs at Draco’s cheek.
Hermione looked at him with a dry, withering expression. "Harry James Potter, if this is about your pride –"
But this is darker, pitch-black, all light blocked by the canopy of trees above. He hears the rustle of leaves more than he sees them, and he hears the incessant buzzing of insects. Something howls ahead and Draco wonders if this is real or if it’s just in his head again.
It still hurts, when Harry remembers it, but the apology soothes, even if just a bit. She also told him more about Sirius, growing up with him, family dinners with him and his brother. Harry thinks this is another way for her to apologize, and listens to her stories, enraptured, even as his heart still hurts, hurts and aches so much for Sirius and Remus, and oh, god,
That one had been Goyle’s.
Harry told himself firmly, willing to still the thunderous beating of his heart. They were still on a mission. He could have his breakdowns later. He reached out to curl his fingers around Malfoy’s wrist again, almost in apology, just to show that there was nothing on his arm to be scared of.
He couldn’t help it. The apprehension at the thought of Sirius Black and Remus Lupin appearing in his fireplace any minute now did things to his temperance.
It was on the thirteenth day that Narcissa Malfoy came to Snape Manor unannounced.
In hindsight, he really should have expected that the cat would bring him trouble when he tried to pet it and got a vehement hiss in reply.
Madame Pomfrey regarded him carefully. "Would you have wanted us to take it from you while you were asleep?"
Harry stopped his journey towards his bed and shifted his gaze towards where he knew Theodore's was. He squinted his eyes to see the other boy better through the dark.
Then, Harry turned but Draco still couldn't see his face because he had his head ducked down. His body remained stiff and Draco could see Harry's hands still shaking because Draco notices stuff like that, especially about Harry, who was walking towards him now and Draco actually held his breath in – fear? Nervousness?
Nodding mutely, Harry turned his head towards the middle of the clearing.
As if Harry was going to come up to Malfoy and suddenly snog him.
He sighed again and closed his eyes, already feeling his head start to throb. “Get some sleep, Potter,” he muttered. “We both could use it.”
Harry didn’t have time for his nerves to increase because in one fluid motion, the girl had stepped inside the compartment, shoved her face right up his, and peered into his eyes before her gaze travelled upwards to his scar. She blinked in amazement.
Then, Draco turned back and called to him, “Seven at your flat tonight, Potter. I’m expecting high-quality wine.”
"Didn't think you were the shy type."
Snape valiantly tried to keep his lip from curling in disgust lest he send the wrong message to the boy. The drawings were very nice for a seven-year-old though. They were rather realistic, only a bit rough on the edges, and one can see the parts in the drawing when Harry had pressed the pencil too deeply. However, they all looked suspiciously like…
They didn’t talk about Draco’s mission with Ron because Draco didn’t bring it up and Harry didn’t want to bring it up, because he still smarted from the fact that Draco had easily accepted another partner other than him.
"His head's as thick as James'!"
Madame Pomfrey nodded grimly.
The Gryffindor overpowered the Slytherin then, and Harry Potter finally kissed Draco Malfoy.
But he was also terrified. He wanted his parents safe, too.
Draco smirked. “I go through it every time I visit, Harry, just to ensure that you still have something exquisite to serve me with the next time I come here.” He raised the glass to his lips and looked at Harry from above its rim. “Unless you have something else other than exotic alcohol to entice me.”
He wasn't even aware that a tear had fallen down his cheek unsuspectingly until he tasted it and he summoned all his strength and frustration and punched Harry –
Harry requested Theodore to hold the Nimbus for him, since he wasn't really sure if he'd be allowed to bring it into the arena. Dumbledore was in the stands, along with the other headmasters, to formally announce the start of the Triwizard Tournament. Barty Crouch, Sr., Head of the Ministry of Magic's Department of International Magical Cooperation, and Ludo Bagman, Head of the Department of Magical Games and Sports, were in the tent that the Champions were to stay in before the actual Task, to facilitate the order when each of them would go inside the arena.
"Just a suggestion," Harry muttered, unrolling the parchment.
Maybe he’s tired.
addicted to the frogs.
And it was easy.
He also thought about kissing Draco Malfoy just to get this over with.
By the time he was done, he was exhausted enough that he simply curled up on the big, soft bed and promptly fell asleep, not even having enough time to worry about the Bogeyman that Dudley kept on telling him lived under his bed.
is it that weird of me to worry about you? Now stop trying to piss me off, I’m trying to have a civil conversation here.”
–" A choking sound. "–
Madame Pomfrey turned around, having sensed his presence, and she blinked in surprise. Though her back was still stiff, her shoulders relaxed at the sight of him. "Mister Potter," she said kindly. "Yes?"
Harry was beside him in an instant, moving him out of the rock’s way so that he was on his bum.Harry kneeled in front of him and his panicked eyes stared straight into Draco’s. “Merlin, Draco, are you okay? Uhm, I need to call Severus,
Lavender, however, was starting to look like his Aunt Marge when he accidentally spilled coffee on her dog when Harry was eight years old. Lavender straightened her back and glared, nose upturning. "Back off, Malfoy! We don't need Death Eater scum here!"
Harry’s eyes widened.
Or maybe it was because Harry was sitting too close and smelling too much of soap and Quidditch and grass and mornings, and it makes Draco think unclearly.
–" A wheeze.
And Draco, now at ease, nodded and returned to his book. Harry stayed where he was, content with the sound of Draco's soft breathing beside him, the quiet turning of pages, and the morning sun shining on the two of them.
But Draco didn't…
It sounds ridiculous, but I think worrying about you is making them closer.”
The sight of Potter looking so unguarded made Draco uncomfortable enough for him to do something unexpected as well—he scooted over to the side of the bed, slowly because every moment still made something in his head throb, and waved a hand at the empty space.
More silhouettes floated in the far distance.
“It’s just us and Malfoy then,” Ron says, frowning. “Goyle and Nott’s still in Azkaban. They’re doing six months, right?”
"How long are you going to keep doing this?" Draco asked with an expression of incredulity.
He watched as his body and Malfoy walked down the corridors and staircases of Hogwarts, out onto the snowy grounds of the clocktower courtyard, through the stone circle, and then…
That first night, after making sure that the boy had had enough of his fun exploring his new room and had finally fallen asleep on the bed, he assigned a House Elf to watch over the child, Floo-ed to Dumbledore’s Office, and promptly raised hell.
Draco scoffed, glaring at him. "Of course not. But it's how the Wizarding World works, Potter." He looked at Harry seriously. "Blood is gold."
"Alright. See you later, Potter."
Harry drew himself up so that he could peer at the top of the table and was confused to know that the man hadn’t even bothered to put food on his
They were already in their Quidditch gear: arm guards, leg guards, and lightweight robes and boots. Their Nimbus 2001s leaned idly against the wall near the door.
The boy’s green eyes widened behind his large spectacles and shifted closer to Snape, who was watching Draco with wary eyes.
At age eleven, Draco was smart enough to know that his father really was going to Romania for ‘business’ but that the ‘business’ wasn’t the financial and economical kind, and that his mother
It made sense.
horrible.
“But honestly, Harry,” Draco continued, smiling charmingly at him. “Do you have any idea how hard it is to sleep in animagi form?”
The Goblet of Fire burned brightly, the tips of its flames dancing wildly in black and blue, until – a hiss and a pop – a piece of paper flew from the goblet, into the air, and into Dumbledore's waiting hand.
“To what?”
Potter whipped his head back to glare at him.
Harry shrugged and waved a hand. "By all means, you're welcome to take my place."
–" He stopped when Harry removed something from his bag and moved to throw it over Draco's head. On impulse, Draco ducked his head and yelped. "
He rolls his sleeves up, moves towards the sink, and can’t wait for morning to come, for Draco to wake him up, kiss him, fuss over him and his scratches, and greet him good morning and a happy Christmas.
He’s figured it out, somewhat. The things that make Draco disappear. But although Draco doesn’t seem to like talking about the things that he did or the things he thinks that happened because of it, Harry thinks that maybe, Draco
A murmur of agreement passed over the Great Hall, though Harry didn't know what was there to agree about.
"Wonderful," Voldemort said, his thin, white, and bloodless lips smiling. He turned his back to Draco and addressed the others.
Harry nods patiently. “Yes.”
, Harry thought with an exhilarated deep inhale. Despite his nerves, he found his lips curling up into a wide grin.
He continued listening.
He hurried after them, sticking as close as he dared so as not to be stopped by the tapestry when it fell down again to close the entryway.
that turned their backs on him, I believe. I will be taking Draco somewhere Unplottable."
He woke to the sound of crackling cinder and the warmth of a soft, plush bed. Pain was but a distant memory on his body, probably thanks to Madame Pomfrey’s work, but he could still try to recall it if he tried.
An unusual silence filled the library, and Harry could feel it heavy on his shoulders. He couldn't look at Draco, couldn't even raise his eyes. All he could do was bow his head in apology and run his tongue once more across his bottom lip and remember how wonderful Draco felt and tasted beneath his lips. He didn't even taste the blood.
The Mark hurts the most on those days, or maybe it’s just his imagination, or maybe it’s just his nails, but Potter shows up in the library the next day, anyway, with an apology on his lips and some tart and some salve, and Draco’s
Potter winced and looked up, anywhere but Draco's eyes. "Well," he mumbled. "For starters, I sucked your blood."
Draco sighed. The meeting had just started and his head was already starting to hurt. Stupid Potter. Stupid Potter not telling his merry band of friends. Stupid Potter expecting
Harry let the momentous rush of adoration for the man in front of him encourage him to slip his hand in his pocket and take out an item. He shoved it in front of Draco before his nerves could get the better of him. “Happy Christmas.”
"What do you suppose Severus meant?" Draco asked, as they huddled together in Potter's room.
Potter’s smile gets bigger, and Draco curses his heart for feeling whatever it is that it’s feeling. Must be the nausea.
Draco felt an unfamiliar feeling creep up on him. He frowned, confused. It never mattered to him before if he’d offended any of his friends. He teased Pansy and insulted Blaise
Harry thought that he might be dreaming. After all, he hadn't been this happy since Sirius died. He had this little fear that something
“No. No, I…” Potter looked away, a far-off look on his face, before he shook his head. “I still have work to do.”
Harry stood up abruptly from his crouching position in front of an open trunk and hid the pencil behind his back. He didn’t think Remus would get it from him like Aunt Petunia always did but he wanted to be sure. He fidgeted guiltily.
He looks at Astoria, at her big, grey eyes, her long eyelashes, and the way her hair curls against her high cheekbones. Not for the first time, he thinks,
"All I'm saying, Harry, is that you deserve to be happy," Ginny said, sniffing.
He set the photo back down on the floor and waved at it, as if offering it to the cat. "And since I'm rather infuriated with him right now, you can sit on his face all you want."
It all started to catch up to him ten seconds after he realized that mermaids were chasing him. He was underwater, hauling two bodies (one was a small child,
Draco nodded quickly, uncomfortable with the praise.
Their Wizard's Chess score was 12-0. Draco thought it was admirable that Potter still tried.
Harry feels sick just thinking about it.
The first time it happened was during their first lesson. The boy had been too excited with scribbling squiggly lines on the parchment with a quill that when he reached out to dip the quill in the inkwell, he went farther than the well and nearly touched the nib to Snape’s robes. He had retracted his hand in a flash like it had been burned.
Just then, another loud hiss echoed in the Great Hall. The voices dimmed down and all heads turned towards the center where the Goblet of Fire stood, its flames as high and as wild as ever. The flames should have died down by now.
He swallowed down his fear. He trusted Severus. He trusted that they were all against the Dark Lord now, and they were going somewhere safe.
then it was obvious he was going to get someone else to do it.
Realizing that Hermione was not about to slavedrive him into studying for NEWT's (which were
He wasn't making sense of anything. There was just… so much blood and Potter was bleeding –
He had no idea who these students were. Even the ones from Hogwarts!
Ginny's lips pressed together more tightly.
He felt very depressed suddenly.
Another week later, they went to the Room of Requirement, but The Room of Hidden Things was no more. They tried, multiple times, to get it to appear. If not the room itself in its former glory, then at least its charred remains. But either the doors didn’t appear or the room itself was a totally different room from what they had asked.
The Dursleys never let him use Dudley’s pencils. He was allowed to touch them only if he was going to put them away after Dudley made a mess of them but he was never to use them. He’d seen Dudley write with it or even draw, but Dudley’s drawings were never pretty. Mostly, they were drawings of Harry getting hurt by a badly drawn fire or a knife or a rabid dog.
Ah. That would explain the over tendency to draw mutts.
The girls screamed and some ran away with their arms above their ducked heads.
Underneath the window and the sunlight that made his hair shine gold, Draco stared dumbly at the wood of the table and slowly fell apart.
Didn't talk or look at him through dinner. Didn't talk or look at him through breakfast the next day.
“I do,” Harry says, laughing at her reaction. “Just not the attention, I guess? Besides, you’re doing well. I watch all your matches and you haven’t let anyone score yet.”
On it, he had written:
And Harry isn’t prepared for the tears, the sudden, quiet tears that stream from Malfoy’s eyes.
Harry flushed at having been caught.
Draco looked affronted. "I told you, Potter, I do not
Draco would probably never forgive him for that.
Harry stared at her. Warily, he nodded.
He had no idea what Dumbledore was thinking sending him to get Potter five years before the boy was sent for Hogwarts. There were just so many things wrong with that thought.
That's what his whole life had been about, right? His father had told him countless of times that he was foolish for still wanting to befriend Harry Potter after the boy had refused his hand during first year, so Draco stopped mentioning it. His aunt Bellatrix would pull him aside, press her nails against his forearm, and whisper to him to forget all about Hogwarts and his friends and just be a
“Yeah.”
The serious look on Dumbledore’s face told him that the decision had been made.
Draco raised an eyebrow at Harry's jaw-dropped expression and merely nodded his greeting quietly, before ignoring him completely and turning to the arduous task of swallowing a glass of medicinal potion that probably included all sorts of animal tongues.
Harry joined him, stepping beside him. He tried not to comment about how tightly Malfoy was gripping his wand.
Madame Pomfrey said, and the tapestry slid upwards to reveal an arched entryway.
The shock and utter ridiculousness of it has Draco walking straight towards his bed to lie down and rest his aching head. There are a lot of gaps in his memory, and trying to make sense of everything that led them here isn’t doing him any favours.
Malfoy’s gaze is blank again, and Harry expected that, but that still doesn’t stop the well of disappointment in the pit of his stomach.
When he arrived in Snape Manor through the Floo, however, he was stupefied to see a boy – looking roughly the same age as him – waiting with Uncle Severus for him.
They've talked about this before, Harry was sure, but he just couldn't remember because the way Draco ate pudding was so distracting…
When Harry merely pursed his lips, Ron's expression looked hurt. "You know, the only reason why I haven't asked yet is because I kind of figured that you'd tell me anyway."
, not the other way around, but Harry wasn't thinking about the irony of this because all he could think about was the blood rushing in his ears and
Severus had told him to call him Professor Snape when he was in Hogwarts and no matter how many times Harry tried it in his head, it still sounded weird. What was Severus like as a professor? Harry imagined he’d probably be strict, just like he was at home.
With one last fleeting look, Harry turned and left the library.
Harry, having expected that and being used to Ron’s table manners after years of being victim to them, calmly Scourgified himself. “You know, they didn’t mean the Regurgitating part here literally.”
"No," was Ron's unapologetic reply. He peered nervously at Harry. "You're not mad at Ginny or anything, are you?"
Harry grabbed his school bag on the nearest chair and rummaged inside. "Tell that to Filch when he catches us," he muttered.
Draco closed his eyes again at the sight of the bloodied floor.
Harry shivered. He had never heard Severus speak like that. His voice was so cold that Harry could imagine the whole of Snape Manor’s garden freezing over.
Your direct superior sleeping beside you. Granted, there were situations in their line of work that required them to sleep beside each other, like when in an undercover mission or somewhere where a bed wasn’t readily accessible, but those were last resort kind of things, not like this when… If Potter wanted to, he could easily go home and sleep on his
Draco’s cheeks are pink. He stands up, takes his robes from the back of his chair, and unfolds it. “Try on my clothes.”
It took a long time for Harry's brain to catch up with everything that had just happened.
Snape cleared his throat, aware of Lupin’s too inquisitive gaze.
“Since Kingsley felt gracious enough to give me a whole week off last time, I finally got to working on my Head-Healing Draught for Victims of Crucio,” Draco said in triumph.
A horrible, piercing wail sounded through the air.
All of these memories, images and thoughts and feelings and emotions, overlapped with his old ones in a rush, binding together in criss-crossed seams that translated to Harry as pain, lances of pain that
He felt the bile crawl up his throat at the memory. He closed his eyes tightly to shut out the image, and also because his vision was starting to swim again.
“Present,” Harry repeats shakily. He looks at Draco’s form and feels the guilt once again eating at his insides.
Harry let out the breath he didn’t know he had been holding. He neared the owl, the grin on his lips getting bigger as the owl blinked at him and cocked her head to the side.
“Oh, good, you finally found him,” a girl’s exasperated voice sounded from the door.
Draco's eyes closed. "
He looked pointedly at the two short paragraphs on Harry’s parchment. Professor McGonagall had required three feet.
“Should I have just left the syrup on your face?”
He wants Potter to stop. He doesn’t deserve it.
"I didn't ask for it," Potter said, clenching his fist. He was looking away again, and just when Draco had finally got Potter to look at him.
Ron cringed from his position by the fireplace but stayed dutifully bent over his own Potions essay.
He’s not supposed to be having normal conversations with Potter like this, about favorite food, and homework, and professors, and what’s it like being the center of everyone's attention, what’s it like growing up in the wizarding world, and how Potter takes gift giving seriously, and how Draco likes snow and looks forward to the first snowfall of every year like a child.
Harry was panicking. He didn't want those memories of Draco gone, he wanted to remember each and every one of them,
He almost didn't want to look, but he
Before Kingsley could ask
Draco's, however, wasn't so candid. He had seen the camera just as Seamus pressed the button and so the picture came out with him looking surprised and then scowling. He also looked very, very sleek in his black and emerald green robes and his hair gelled back neatly.
Draco dared to step closer, just so he could hear better.
And Snape hated him for that.
Harry was confused.
A book! Draco would like that, wouldn’t he? He vaguely remembered Draco talking about the latest book on defence spells that had just been recently released.
Harry just didn't know if they would still
"I can smell him. Don't open the door."
Or maybe it’s because of the war.
He had a point. A very good and practical point. Still, it churned Harry’s stomach at the thought of Malfoy having concern over him. He pushed that thought to the side. “But what about you? What if you—”
"Why are you so happy about it, Sirius?" Harry croaked out weakly.
Perhaps Malfoy understood what exactly Crabbe had cast that spell for.
After everything.
Ginny smiles, shoulders relaxing. “Okay. Good.” Then, she looks around the courtyard, sees no one else, and then leans in to whisper. “Well, is it because of…?”
Draco winced. "Don't say that name."
"When are you going to keep this up anyway?" Ron asked, shoving half of the tart in his mouth. "Really, Harry, I'm also starting to miss having a conversation with you," he said through a mouthful of tart, which wasn't very comprehensible but being his best mate has its merits so Harry had no problems understanding him.
Ginny tightened her grip on his shoulder (
Malfoy frowned, and Harry knew why. Malfoy had gotten better at talking about taboo topics such as his time with the Dark Lord, and could now even say his name without batting an eyelash. He could talk about his Mark now as if he was talking about the weather, but to show it… To somebody else…
“Fred isn’t your fault, you know,” Harry says, an hour later, when Draco comes back.
"I can always talk to Ginny, mate," Ron said in between tearing the limbs off his chocolate frog. "Not that it'd be much help, but it might knock some sense in her."
Draco whispered, barely audible. It was almost a squeak. Harry couldn't believe his eyes.
He sounded skeptical, and looked skeptical as well with his raised eyebrow.
Draco raised an eyebrow at the hasty capitalization. "Touchy," he murmured with amusement. "I'm just trying to help here, Potter," he said casually.
Seamus opened his mouth to speak once more but that was the same time that Ron pointed a finger towards the cat and blurted out, “
Harry does as told. “No, I came for the pancakes.” He transfers two pancakes on his plate (After three weeks of eating in the Manor, he’s managed to divest himself of his bashfulness with the food.), scoops as much slices of banana as he can with his fork, and sprinkles that on top along with the crushed cashews. He unstops the bottle of maple syrup.
"Did you memorize that?" Theodore blinked at him in awe.
He whimpered pathetically.
Harry felt even more miserable, having his friends fight his battles for him just because he lacked the voice to.
Harry looked pleased and grinned. "Yes. There
"Is that true, young Malfoy?" Voldemort said, the hissing sounding almost like a satisfied purr.
?” he asked, blinking innocently.
In one fluid motion, she transformed back into a cat and quietly and swiftly sauntered in the opposite direction, towards the back of the castle.
And he saw it in his mind's eye, coupled with the words drumming painfully in his ears:
Often times, Draco would still hear loud thumps upstairs. He never did see the dog that Severus had talked about, but he hated animals anyway, so he didn't really look for it.
The way Malfoy flinched and cast his robed arm away from him reminded Harry that he forgot to ask for permission, but he also forgot to give an apology when hisses sounded from beneath the dark cloth and formed a clear message.
Potter's expression turned sheepish.
"I know. Mum couldn’t believe it at first yesterday, kept saying at the start that Mrs. Malfoy’s probably planning something, but Merlin, Harry, I think
But Astoria just laughs at his obvious horror, and though her cheeks are flushed with embarrassment, the sadness on her face is gone. “Is it that obvious?” She lets out a few more chuckles, unable to help herself. “But it’s okay. I know he already likes somebody else.”
"The Ministry can't be going around leaving Marked Death Eaters unpunished," Malfoy says in reply, his face now fashioned into a careful mask of indifference. "It simply wouldn't be appropriate."
popular, but not for the good reasons. He was also used to people talking behind his back whenever he passed by, but that was usually talk about how it was only a matter of time before he turned Dark or how scary it was to be studying in the same school as a vampire or
Harry was saved from a whole afternoon of racking his brain for where to go next because as soon as they entered the overcrowded Diagon Alley, the cat started off in a brisk walk, looking behind only once at Harry, as if making sure he was following.
Then, he smiled again, as if there was a joke in there somewhere that Draco didn't know.
The sleep is still heavy in Draco’s eyes, and he realizes just how early it is when they step into the Slytherin Common Room and there are no students yet that are awake.
The green fire went out with a pop.
However, their subjects, which were endlessly fascinating, did rather well in distracting him from morose thoughts. Harry managed to levitate a feather on the first try easily due to Remus’ teachings but struggled a bit with Transfiguration. Potions was a weird affair, with Harry trying to reconcile his image of Severus at home with the image of ‘Professor Snape’. On a few occasions, he almost called him
"Welcome all to the Second Task of the Triwizard Tournament!"
In it, he found bundles of parchment with graphs and drawings of a lot of circles with small text scribbled around them, but he didn’t understand half of the words that he read so he just put them to the side to grab another item.
“It looks… nice on you.”
He hissed right back at the cat, before abruptly about-facing and stalking towards the fireplace.
In an instant, Severus whipped around with his wand in the air and shouted, "
Feeling a little bit silly at the formality, Harry cautiously reached out a hand and shook Draco’s. “Harry Potter.” Then, he shrugged. “It’s alright.”
messed with Draco Malfoy’s things.
Draco actually wondered why he even bothered to look for Harry bloody Potter.
He’s almost worried, thinking that maybe Draco decided not to return to Hogwarts after all, but there, after five rows of empty compartments, Harry sees it.
, he mouthed with a roll of his eyes.
Harry grinned when he felt, more than saw, Draco relax. Reluctantly, he let go of Draco's wrist and also allowed himself to relax in his chair.
And all at once, Harry can see it, the weight on her shoulders: Her husband forever lost in Azkaban, leaving her with a multitude of sins, a ruined name, and a tainted home that once hosted a madman. Her son, the only remaining love of her life, lost within his own mind.
Draco just stared at him.
, he wrote, looking giddy and smug and just a little bit shy.
“Parents wouldn’t really want to bring their children back, after everything that’s happened last year with the Carrows,” Ginny says quietly, frowning at her hands on her lap as she recalls the things that happened last school year. As the train’s horn sounds and it lurches into a start, she looks at Harry with a worried expression. “And, I overheard some people talking in Diagon Alley. Word’s gotten around that Malfoy’s also coming back.”
Eyelids fluttered open.
This time, Harry didn’t even try to keep the grin back. “It was a horrible joke,” he said lightly.
Harry stared at him, disbelieving.
who absolutely had no idea. Still, he didn't want Draco to return to his book, so he urged the conversation forward.
Lavender ignored her.
“We need people with the Dark Mark,” Potter tried one more time, but it sounded like an excuse more than an argument now.
Ron stretched out a hand to clamp on his shoulder and squeeze it firmly. His eyes were grave as he looked straight into Hartsman’s eyes and imparted on his wisdom. “If you want to keep your job, Hartsman, you’ll speak none of this to anyone. Now excuse me while I go look for Malfoy…”
… to do it.” Potter put his fork down suddenly and pinched the bridge of his nose. He took a deep breath, and Draco watched as Potter visibly collected himself. When he was done, he was sitting straight once again and when he turned to Draco, he looked so serious that Draco was reminded once again that, for this mission, Harry was his superior
“Of…?”
After the war.
With another deep, shaky inhale, Harry steps forward and arranges Draco back in his chair.
of hope) that Harry held the same feelings for him.
Draco brightened up. "There's a Quidditch pitch?"
“Don’t you worry your little head over it, okay?”
Harry frowned at the parchment, and then frowned at Ron.
There was a sigh from the other side of the door. "Malfoy, I'm coming in."
In one room, he had found a tapestry of the Black family tree. He had outlined some of the names, and had been pleased to see his name and his face at the bottom. His face in the tapestry had flashed him a winning smile, the one he used to make adults like him.
“Thanks, Draco,” Harry said with a grateful smile after Seamus walked away in search for Dean.
He almost laughed, because it was like he was scheduling a date. He hoped that Malfoy didn't find it weird, but if he did, he didn't show it. Draco simply nodded, before standing up.
“Malfoy’s sitting in on these meetings now,” Potter said, seating himself down on the remaining chair beside Malfoy and Kingsley.
Draco's eyes widened at the realization. "Filch! They say he hangs students from
Severus' jaw clenched. He looked like he still wanted to argue. Draco could actually see in his expression and in the lowering of his shoulders the moment he started to back down. "He wouldn't want it… forcibly taken."
“What’s wrong, Draco?” Parkinson’s high-pitched voice echoed in the empty hall.
He had already drawn his wand, and his mouth was set in a grim line as he stopped a few feet away from it, just close enough to be able to aim his wand well. “I suppose it’s this then?”
Ginny ignored his glare, and sighed once again. "I don't see why you can't just suddenly go up and kiss him, Harry. It should be really easy."
" came Theodore's excited whisper. "Hurry up, Potter, he's gonna announce it anytime now –"
was the boy’s birthday, Dumbledore had said.
, his Death Eaters—that they had sworn allegiance to him and
Slowly, Harry sits down across from him. He stares at the bruise. “Who was it?”
“Then all the better that we wizards do the compensating for them,” Dumbledore had said calmly. “We do, after all, have the means.”
. Hermione’s taken to spending long hours in the library just to be able to study in peace, with a grumble of
Seeming to understand that he’s not going to get a straight answer, Draco looks away. “Dreadful. My back hurts.”
He grits his teeth and walks away, before he can do anything else that he might regret later. “I don’t even know why I keep trying. I’m done, Malfoy. I hope you’re happy.”
But it was when they called Madame Pomfrey that Harry had to pause and think.
thought brought with it another kind of emotion, something more powerful, more heavy.
rolled by, the boy had gotten out of bed and eaten breakfast quietly as was his wont and didn’t say anything about the day of his birth.
Draco inhaled slowly in an effort to still his traitorous heart. “…Alright.” He glanced at the pile of parchment on Potter’s desk. “How about you?”
Draco suddenly felt dizzy.
Harry stands up before the squeezing pain in his chest can settle, and he goes around the table so he can pick up the fork near Draco’s feet.
“Just swell, Potter, thanks for asking.”
Ron and Hermione.
“Malfoy’s mum sent my mum an Owl. Said she’s worried about you.”
"For the last time, Professor," Harry grumbled out. "I
“Uhm,” he says, closing his book. “Hullo, Malfoy.”
He doesn’t like the way Potter tries to make small talk during Potions, or Transfiguration, or any of their shared classes. He doesn’t like it when Potter tries to talk to him,
“It’s crazy,” Ginny says in disbelief, peeling one edge of the closed curtain away from the window to peek at the mess of people outside.
human blood, which leads them to biting their First Donor and consequently being dependent on them their whole lives. Harry didn’t want to tell this new boy that nor did he want to think about it himself.
Potter glanced down at the front of his robes. “Did it…”
The boy’s eyes grew even wider.
Draco Malfoy. Thin. Cheeks hollowed. Ghostly pale. And eyes open.
Harry refused to think why he liked that piece of information so much.
"Dreadful," Harry answered immediately. "Terrifying."
“It was a person.”
But Harry had no worries today.
Hermione pulled back, grinned at him, and then ran towards the Girls' Dormitories. "I've
The scratches of the cat from yesterday were still there, visible on the glass, just below the cracks that Errol had just created. Harry slid the window to the side and let the poor bird wobble in to land on his carpeted floor.
"I suppose. The Parkinson family is very influential, and I think my father approves."
Draco goes back to glaring at the pancakes, and Harry finishes his third pancake mechanically. Once he’s done and there’s nothing left on his plate for him to stuff his mouth with (and there’s no more excuse for him to shut up), he tries, “Do you want me to feed you?"
Others still sent him scathing looks, but most had warmed up to him enough that he would get quite a number of high-fives in a day. Astoria still hovered, but could be seen snogging with Zabini in a corner on Saturdays. Severus still gave out Dreadfuls, and Mad-Eye Moody still held creepy and disturbing lessons. Harry was pretty sure he had developed a sort of fancy with a Gryffindor in his year, Neville Longbottom.
Summoning his courage, Harry walked over and placed the wand on the table.
By the time he got there, the cat had already made a mess of Ronald Weasley’s desk. Ron was, thankfully, nowhere to be found, because his papers were strewn all over the floor and his chair was overturned.
“Eat,” the man ordered gently.
“Bollocks. Wait till he hears you said that.”
Hermione elbowed him quite harshly, which made him double over the table with a pained
Harry found it incredibly endearing how Draco swiped an apple before the tray had even landed on the table.
She was
"Still not going to budge, huh, Harry?" Hermione said accusingly with narrowed eyes.
who was the one in the predominantly-male Gryffindor Quidditch Team to always wrestle bludgers to the ground in order to shove them inside the ball box.
Harry could feel his eyes watering. Maybe it was because of the pain in his face or from somewhere in his chest, but whatever it was, it made his vision blurrier than usual.
"What magical creature is terribly beautiful and loves to sing, Harry?" Remus' green head asked.
Harry frowned. Sighing, he told himself to abandon caution and gingerly took the seat next to Draco.
The look that Draco gives him tells him that no, it is not enough. Draco still looks like he wants to ask another question, but in the end, he just takes the napkin from his plate and unfolds it on his lap.
The cat’s ear twitched but its eyes remained closed.
Harry shrugged. He looked at Hermione's worried expression and softened a bit. Reaching out, he grasped her shoulder and squeezed reassuringly. 'I'll be fine,' he mouthed. To prove his point, he shuffled through his bag to get his Transfigurations essay, finished and complete that he had finished yesterday after his and Ginny's 'talk' in an effort to get Draco Malfoy out of his mind.
That earns him a startled laugh.
But now he's tired, bone tired, and Draco's upstairs, after having gone to sleep alone while the rest of the world was celebrating, and Harry can't take it, the guilt that twists his stomach and the regret that presses on his chest.
Harry hated how that suddenly made his face feel warm.
Harry's dry look made her shoulders droop.
Harry felt his very soul being sucked out from his body, his heart
Ginny sees him staring over her shoulder, turns around, and blinks. “Oh. Malfoy.”
It’s late in the afternoon when Malfoy starts to stir.
If possible, Draco paled even more. He looked away nervously, shoved a hand in his pocket and quickly pulled out his wand.
The last one who told was called a pansy by the rest of her house.
Potter was leaning towards him again, hands poised to help. “Are you well enough to walk?”
As they appeared, they each offered words of welcome, some even going as far to kneel down and kiss Voldemort's dirty, rotten feet.
Harry rolled his eyes. For the past few days he’d known Draco, he never could get past the first syllable of the word
take care of them simultaneously?”
“Potter, I thought we’ve established that we have a Portkey, so that I wouldn’t be saying my last words anytime soon,” Draco raised an eyebrow at him, before looking at his pocket pointedly.
Hermione stared at him for a long time, with those big, brown eyes of hers, before nodding as well.
Harry chuckled despite the hollow feeling that had settled in his stomach. “My, one would think you despised your own Housemates.”
He thinks he’s crying because he didn’t expect it… like this. He expected
Severus found him before he could storm up to the Headmaster's office and demand where Potter was.
…But that's just it.
– someone wrapped its arms around his waist and tackled him back to the chair.
. Sirius wasn’t cut out for that. He didn’t know what to do.
Harry made a pleased noise of approval when Draco’s tongue swiped at his bottom lip and plunged inside his mouth without so much a request for permission.
What a preposterous thought.
wrote Harry in messy, careless handwriting.
Hermione smiles. “Next time.”
Harry's fists clenched, making more blood trickle out of his wounds. 'Bloody fucking wankers,' he spat angrily, not caring if no sound came out. He glared at the infirmary door.
Harry looks at her, too, at the dark spots under her eyes. “Are
, because Potter’s not supposed to be saying sorry.
And why was Potter the one avoiding
“Ah,” said Hartsman. “That’s good to hear.” Then, because of his concern for the well-being of their Head Auror as well as his persistence to win those two galleons, it was with a small amount of hesitation that he dived head-on. “Sir Potter saw the picture that Sir Malfoy keeps in his top drawer.”
The compartments really are free for all, but everyone knew that Slytherins usually occupied the ones at the back end of the train. Here, it’s the same: students look at him in curiosity, but there is a sense of caution in the air, as if they’re wondering what Harry Potter’s doing in the den of snakes.
It was a testament to how used all their friends were to Harry’s Floo-traveling skills that all of them spared only a single glance and a quick greeting before going back to whatever it was they were doing. Only Draco abandoned his alcohol-perusing activity, abruptly about-faced, and marched towards Harry to grab his arm with one hand and Scourgify him free of soot with the other.
It was frightening.
But seeing the boy again… It opened up that dam of guilt that he had desperately tried, for six years, to hold back.
Draco's answering smile rivaled the morning sun.
The first thing the dragon tried to do to him was turn him into a crispy fried Harry.
Ron finally raised his head, his curiosity getting the better of him.
But much is different, including the unusually quiet atmosphere of the school, made by the reduced student population and the grim, physical reminders of the war that had occurred in these very halls just months ago.
Harry, who had been in the middle of washing the dishes (because old habits die hard and Scourgifies can only do so much), popped his head out from the kitchen. He blinked at them with incredulity. “What are you guys doing here?”
He had been away for a week—too long, and while he is used to long missions, he isn’t used to leaving Draco alone on Christmas Eve. It is their fifth Christmas, but it’s the first one that he’s had to be away.
from slipping past his lips. He thinks the shock of the pain at knowing that Draco likes somebody else helped. He doesn’t even know why it still hurts, because up until a minute ago, he had thought that that somebody else was Astoria—
At the end of the courtyard, Draco is descending the steps from the clock tower. His pallor is paler than usual, like he’s still sick, but his feet doesn’t slow down. He nods at them in polite greeting, passing by them without losing stride. “Terribly sorry for the disturbance. Carry on.”
“Chris’mas?” Harry asked unsurely, shyly.
Needless to say, he had visited Dumbledore again that night spitting venom.
Hermione nods. “Malfoy’s sentence was reduced only because of Harry’s petition.”
Well,
The cloth was pushed back. Harry wasn't sure why the bile crawled up his throat. He didn't know if it was because of the pain in his head, the knowledge that Cedric's lifeless body was just a few feet away from him, or… or the sight of that creature in the cloth, like a disfigured child, curled up on itself, hairless, scaly, its skin raw and reddish and black like a festering burn wound.
And why was Potter being such a pansy about it anyway?
They needed to get out of here together.
“Thank you, Professor,” Harry said gratefully.
Harry had prepared for this day, the day when he would finally be allowed into the outside world. Remus and Sirius had told him all about Voldemort and the craze of the Wizarding World for Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, which just made his nose scrunch up at the time because the thought that he was famous was
Draco quickly learned the Corkscrew Dive and Potter did the same with the Wronski Feint. So they moved on to another maneuvers to exchange.
“The locations were too close,” Potter explained, seeing his confusion. “The magic in both areas were too close that they both reacted with your spell at the same time.”
“You are dismissed,” Kingsley said, and the doors started to quietly swing close.
"If you
It had been approximately ten minutes since he and Cedric decided to go their separate ways. Judging by Bagman's other two whistles, all of the Champions were now currently in the Maze. Harry had been turning left and right, but so far hadn't encountered any trouble… and that was what slowly made him more suspicious, more nervous.
itch.
The next few months passed by in an excruciatingly slow pace. Harry supposed it was easy to feel restless knowing the number of days left that you're scheduled to probably die.
He opens the door, lets Ron see.
That was true, but… He could accompany Draco. That was something he could do.
When Draco comes to again, the pieces of pancake on his plate have gone cold. Harry’s already on his third.
"Don't you think we've tried that?" Severus snapped, hand coming up to press hard on his temples. "He vomited it back out. A vampire's first human blood is special. It activates the dormant cells responsible for their appetite for blood, and it… changes the whole chemical balance of the body. Harry's going through the changes right now, and he needs…" He cut off, frustrated. "His body needs to calm down."
Malfoy turned to him now, and Harry was surprised at the glare directed at him.
“You’re here,” he comments, eyes wide and startled.
Did he finally go berserk at the sight of human blood? Finally realized he couldn't stop his vampiric urges, never mind that Draco had just been bitten by a huge-ass snake? And where was Potter anyway?
The edge of Snape’s lips curled up into a sneer.
As he served himself some roast pudding and mashed potatoes, he wondered if he really needed to stay here for the next three days. If so, he needed to find something to do. Go flying? Get some advanced reading done for the next school year?
“This
“That’s also a pretty name,” Harry said to return the favour.
Then, as he chanced a look at Severus’ face, the shock returned as he saw the cold fury in the man’s face.
"For now, just sit there and shut up. I like you better when you can't defend yourself from my clever wit."
stupefied when he saw the scar.
Draco found himself stepping closer in Potter's personal space. "Spill it, Potter."
And Harry really was a bad cat-owner because that voice was one that he'd know anywhere and one that could make all thoughts of anything else (for example, his cat) disappear anytime.
she said firmly, before stalking away towards the Girls' Dormitories, stomping as she went.
“Malfoy."
Oh, it was
“They’re bonkers, that’s what they are.” Ron shakes his head, a stricken look on his face. “They were selling Ginger Quills! ‘Show your love for Ron Weasley’ and all that shite!
Right now, Draco’s arms are around him, his mouth is full of Draco’s taste, and his nose is filled with Draco’s fresh scent.
But he still had the memories. He
Harry grins back at her. “Why don’t
The Marauders' Map told him that Draco was in the library.
And Draco had been
Harry smiled to himself. Theodore could be such a sap sometimes, even if he would never admit it.
“My, Potter, are you worried about me?” Draco said, flashing him a teasing smile that always did rile him up, but this time, Potter just glared at him, green eyes bright without his usual glasses covering it.
He was a good boy – until the end, when he refused to identify Harry in the Manor.
Until, finally, the hissing formed a word,
“Pushover,” Draco said affectionately. “So the mistletoe was on purpose?”
“I thought Draco was fibbing when he said that he was friends with Harry Potter,” she said in wonder.
He looks at the untouched pancakes and wonders if Draco will get angry if he cuts them up for him.
Harry collected enough of himself to close his opened mouth and to look at Draco indignantly. “Well, if you’re so happy, then I don’t think I should worry at all anymore.”
Hermione's eyes widened even more and her mouth dropped.
From behind him, Harry hears someone mutter. “Good. I don’t really want to see Death Eater scum today.”
McGonagall seemed like she understood and turned her attention back to Harry. “If you need my help…”
Whenever he and McGonagall would pass ways, he would smile at her sheepishly in greeting and she would stare at him from above her spectacles as if she wanted to say something, but she would always just shake her head and sigh and walk away with a simple "Good day to you, Harry."
With a sniff and haughtily raised eyebrow, Draco walked over to him and gracefully sat himself down on the chair beside him.
Hermione
That, and perhaps Harry was in a good mood after getting eight hours of sleep last night.
After half an hour of peering at any and all suspicious-looking cracks, Harry finally brought up his last resort. He waved a hand towards Malfoy’s arm and asked, apologetically, “Malfoy, may I…?”
Severus bypassed him completely and entered the living room.
“Mm-hmm,” Rosmerta replied, signing a parchment with her garishly-colored quill without even looking at it. “I reckon they’re having a very heated conversation. Harry dear went in earlier quite livid. You can’t hear it because of the Silencing Charms, but you can feel the vibrations on the walls from here.”
"Absolutely whipped," Ron clarified, stealing one of the tarts from the tray.
. He shifted a bit so that his shoulder bumped with Draco’s.
Hartsman nodded in approval. “Good choice. Gary’s still in the middle of looking for Sir Potter’s cat.”
Draco was sitting under that tall window again, the light from outside casting a glow around him. Harry found himself pausing just to
“Potter? Potter!” Malfoy was still holding his arm out, eyes wide, obviously shaken.
Draco Malfoy was
Harry was kissing him.
“Well, uhm.” She smiles, almost apologetically. “Malfoy?”
And he was starting to get hungry. Again. What time did he have dinner? It must have been six hours ago. Draco wasn't sure. He didn't want to cast a Tempus lest someone hear him.
he thought in a panic.
Potter’s finger dragged through the air, moving just a bit to the right, and Draco followed it with his eyes until he found another dry spot.
And Draco could only stare, and mumble dumbly in reply. "You do?"
After half an hour, he sat in the infirmary with Madame Pomfrey tending to his bloodied fist littered with splinters.
Draco ignored the glare sent his way from Potter’s direction. Potter didn’t get to glare at him. He was the one who was supposed to glare at Potter. Stupid fucking Potter. Didn’t think,
week is a bit…”
“It keeps him awake. I mean. Awake
Ginny tried to look offended. "Harry," she exclaimed, scandalized. "Do you know how hard it is for me, knowing that you're unhappy?"
When Draco came back to himself, he turned his head to look at Severus, and he realized that Severus had been looking at him this whole time. Warily.
that. It was as crazy as him being heavily comforted and relieved by Malfoy’s words, even if Malfoy didn’t know what he was talking about yet.
, he was sure and Merlin's balls, why did everyone keep on asking that same stupid question about the stupid cup – and then Sirius' head added, "Because it's absolutely something that James and I would have done and would have roped Moony into doing back in our day."
Harry released his breath.
Malfoy’s grip on his arm tightened, for just a moment, before he finally took it away. He turned his head towards the clearing, seeing only damp soil and grass.
, Potter.”
Draco's cheeks are pink as he coughs and repeats himself. "His fiancé." He looks away and waves vaguely towards Harry's hand on his chest.
When he arrived at the Hospital Wing, Draco was there, alright, even though Harry could only see his white-blond hair. Madame Pomfrey was standing beside Draco's bed, her back turned to Harry who realized that the Mediwitch's shoulders were actually… shaking.
Harry followed suit. He had a gnawing dread what those silhouettes were and what they needed to do…
He sighed loudly into the silence of his flat. The couch underneath him shook as the cat jumped off it in surprise at the sudden noise.
die –“
“He doesn’t know how to read and write,” Snape was listing off in Dumbledore’s Office on the second night. A dark look was on his face. “He knows how to wash dishes, cook a variety of English cuisine, which chemicals are best for polishing marble, and how to weed gardens. He’s
With a few swishes and flicks, Draco felt his head clear up, but the nausea was still there. He also felt himself floating in mid-air, back towards his bed. The blanket tucked itself around him. His body sagged on the bed, relaxed. Madame Pomfrey must have given him a Relaxing Charm.
Harry rubs his face with his hands, rubs the stickiness of the dried tears off and onto his fingers. His eyes
“It won’t interfere with the job, I promise,” Potter said earnestly. “I’ve got the Portkey. I’m ready to get you to Madame Pomfrey as quickly as possible.”
He made a noise of frustration, sulking at not being able to say anything.
Potter kneels down and lets go of his legs, lets him step on the ground on his own and straighten himself up. Immediately, Potter stands and looks at him over, looks at him worriedly. “Are you okay?”
in the face.
Ron, even though he looked a bit green in the face, finally allowed himself to sag against the wall and sigh heavily in relief.
Sometimes, they'd release a snitch. So far, the score was 5-7, in favor of Potter.
, Potter. It just so happens that they’re the ones of nearest vicinity at this moment, unless you’d rather that I complain about what a horrid mess you look like right now with your swollen eyes and your red nose.” He looked at Harry pointedly.
"I'll stop them. Go and get that blasted Jinx off you, Potter!" she yelled over the wind, and then she was gone and Harry flew for his life.
he needed to talk to Kingsley. The Ministry definitely needed to give more budget to St. Mungo’s, preferably for some lavender fabric soap.
He gripped Malfoy’s shoulder.
Sirius looked at him and smiled softly. He kneeled in front of Harry and pushed the boy’s chin up with a finger. “Snivellus told us everything,” he said lightly.
the Heir of Slytherin and that he did
“You should ask Seamus.”
Draco looks at him, an exasperated expression on his face. “In a threatening way?”
Potter unfolds another letter, then another, then another, until he’s gone through all of them, and he crushes the last one in his fist with his lips curled in distaste. He throws it in the garbage bin, and glares at the remaining letters on the bed. “How long has this been going on?” he demands.
Instead, they did their summer homework together. Kreacher brought them cookies every time, and they always bickered over the last one. They also spent more time flying, not just in the morning. 5-7 became 16-19. They would release bludgers as well, to provide a challenge, but it was still in favor of Potter, the annoying git.
He was greeted by Draco Malfoy’s winning smirk.
Draco smiled fondly.
Harry frowns, shaking his head in disbelief even as he moves to stand up. “Students wouldn’t…” He trails off, but there is already a gnawing dread in his stomach.
Potter was the first to be Apparated by Severus with Side-Along Apparition. Severus came back for him five minutes later.
“Hey!” Harry exclaims, glaring. He grabs the offending object and is surprised to see that it’s a chocolate frog, sitting still and pretty inside its shiny box.
,” came a venomous, panicked hiss from the far side of the room, which Harry recognized as Ron’s.
, he wrote instead.
He sounded desperate and Harry had to close his eyes to push down the anger that was bubbling inside of him towards the wizarding world for being so close-minded, towards Lucius Malfoy for being a selfish bastard and towards Voldemort for fucking everything up.
I really didn’t mean it literally,” Malfoy muttered, wiping his mouth with a napkin. He sent Harry a raised, unamused eyebrow. “Let me guess. The Room of Hidden Things?”
, he wrote, feeling rather pathetic at admitting that it was a girl who got him in this mess. Never mind that the girl was
Draco disappears in the middle of conversations, sometimes, but they pick it up as soon as he comes back. Sometimes, it takes a while for him to remember, but Harry waits patiently, every time.
Draco tried to open his mouth to answer, but realized he couldn't.
Draco returned to the Hospital Wing now, and as he expected, the Hospital Wing remained empty. Even Madame Pomfrey was nowhere to be found.
The cold returned.
“Just a few minutes ago, you were talking so big about how you could do it on your own.”
Would his mother hug him too?
This was a child.
“I’ve been receiving letters.”
That meant that it was Potter that called the shots and that he was to answer to Potter alone, circumventing even the power that the Head Auror (
"Albus has placed extra wards and Protection Charms around the castle and challenge sites," Snape had said after their Potions class, when it was only him, Harry, and Theodore in the classroom. "We've also tasked the House Ghosts and some of the House Elves to keep an eye out for all the foreign students and staff."
Severus had his eyebrow raised, as if daring him to finish his sentence.
Finally, he steps back, peruses his handiwork, and chuckles. “Red doesn’t suit you at all.”
In Harry's part, he didn't really have much choice in the matter since he was currently rendered mute.
But then Harry breathed out with a shy, tentative grin: “I think it’s cool.” Then, afraid that Remus might take it the wrong way, quickly added, “But I don’t like how you always get hurt every month.”
“They
Granted, he’s had Potter in his room before, but not… in
So he had Floo-called Seamus up immediately, ignored his quip of
"Harry James Potter," announced Lavender Brown. "It has been a week. SEVEN DAYS."
It’s… People are obviously going to talk, you know. This isn’t going to be the last time, and there’s really nothing else that they can say about me that hasn’t already been said, but you—you’re going to get the worst of it. Harry Potter being friends with an ex-Death Eater, someone who’s a little insane—“
It left a bad taste on Harry’s tongue, how Malfoy naturally expected (and accepted!) that he was like a lamb being led to slaughter.
Harry sits up straight, startled at what she’s insinuating. The defence is immediately on his lips. “I don’t… I don’t mean any harm,” he says, hurt.
The cat cocked its head to the side, wide eyes peering curiously at him instead of the picture.
Draco found himself grinning.
Harry stared at the cat bewilderedly for a few more seconds, before he shook his head in amused exasperation. He closed the window and sat next to the cat, going back to his position in front of the telly before he was rudely interrupted.
Severus Snape knew there was something not quite right with 4 Privet Drive. It was in the closed curtains, the unwelcoming atmosphere, and the dullness of the place despite having – as Dumbledore had said – two children to brighten up the place.
He paused again, still thinking hard by the time the words had already disappeared on the parchment.
"And where is this?" Narcissa demanded.
Severus had said that Potter was here somewhere, in detention. He should have asked where. He wanted to demand why Potter was so uncivilized, so neanderthal, and know if his detention was enough for the itch in his neck. Madame Pomfrey said it wouldn't scar. Potter should hope it wouldn't, for his sake.
like, and it was hard choosing a gift for someone who never had trouble getting anything he wanted.
With a start, Harry realized that he actually wanted this woman to
Harry was expecting to be back in the Quidditch Pitch, at the entrance of the Maze, with the roar of the crowd in his ears and Severus helping him stand up so that he could finally remove some pressure from his leg. He was ready to collapse and sleep, he didn't care about the Tournament anymore, it was
"My – my wand," he muttered, yanking his wrist from Harry's grip. He then took his wand and shoved it in Harry's palm. "Take it. I might… I can't – You keep it. I can't."
It hurts.
“I should go,” Potter says, sitting up with a sigh. “Ron will be worried.”
“You’re not sure?”
And that’s how they spend the rest of the morning. When Draco’s gone, Harry writes a letter for Hermione. He tells her that she’ll be proud of the fact that he’s been studying. He also tells her, for the first time, that Draco Malfoy is out of Azkaban and that Harry’s been looking after him.
“Malfoy.”
“Exactly. You’re catching on.”
When Draco comes to, Harry’s too tired from the onslaught of emotions he’s been through for the day to explain why they’re sitting on the floor of the compartment, legs folded in awkward angles to fit the tight space, and arms pressed against each other.
had started to stare at Draco so frequently. It made me wonder."
He supposed his father decided not to tell her. His mother had always been very vocal about her hatred of vampires. She had actually stopped talking to Blaise's mother because of it, after she had dated one. She might actually file a criminal case in the Wizengamot if she knew that Harry Potter had bit her son. But why… Why would his father be protecting
,” he breathed out.
Harry figured, with a long-suffering sigh of mortification, that this was going to be a long and tiring night.
Deep inside, Harry knew that everything would be okay once they returned to dry land. But seeing Severus like that… Harry felt another chill rack his body.
Severus regarded him for a few moments in silence.
He wondered if Draco will say it again.
They were all also going to end.
. “Minerva visited the child a week ago, and I… I trust Lily’s son with you, Severus.”
He sent Snape a pointed look to which the man just scoffed at. He knew what Dumbledore was getting at.
Draco kept quiet. He didn't know what to say. That's nice? Well and good? He took a deep, shuddery breath to calm his thundering heart. "I don't suppose I have a choice?"
So far, Harry has spent his day engaging in small, polite talk with Narcissa and, when she had to leave due to a Floo-call, reading up on Potions with the book that Narcissa had
Draco sighed heavily, burying his face against his knees. He was ashamed to talk to Potter. If he closed his eyes, he could almost hear the sickening sound as the bludger made contact with bone…
and magical plants and owls and House Elves and creatures big and small that Muggles believed only existed in fairytales.
he was thinking about it. Draco and snogging. Ridiculous. "I've never had reason to!"
That night in Little Hangleton… with all the Death Eaters present… He was sure that Mr. Parkinson had been there. So had the Crabbes and the Goyles. And Nott's father.
Harry dropped Malfoy’s arm as if it had burned him.
She remained smiling for the rest of the night though, much to Harry's chagrin.
Draco's amused smile did little to ease his embarrassment. He shook his head.
"To help with the dizziness," Madame Pomfrey said in explanation. "I took a good amount of blood. That was very courageous of you, Mr. Malfoy."
“Don’t you have the day off?”
Even Ron was grinning madly in a smug way.
And then, she sat down beside him on the couch, leaned on him, and muttered in a low voice, "I've seen the way Greengrass has been eyeing you and I will not stand for you to take her to the Ball instead of me. That would be disgraceful."
Severus anyway? Harry hadn't seen him all morning.
expense. Potter was the one who was supposed to owe him. Not the other fucking way around.
“Picky,” Harry muttered in amusement, standing up to search for his thick robes. He left the tuna on the floor though, just in case the cat decided to return to it later in the day.
The late night snacking works. Draco doesn’t look like an emaciated corpse now. Astoria tells him with a cheerful smile, when they pass each other by in the halls, that Draco has also been having a good appetite in the Great Hall lately. Personally, he thinks Draco’s starting to become
Ron grinned. "Thought so, mate. You haven't Trip Jinxed her once."
Draco sneers, and suddenly, Harry is hit with a sense of sadness that it’s been such a long time since he’s seen Draco’s face honest and open, mouth curved into a smile, eyes shining under the bright, morning sun. He hates that Draco’s so guarded. Again. As if summer never happened. As if those banana pancakes shared together and walks in the garden didn’t exist.
and Hermione had been nagging at them all summer to read up lest they want to go for a ninth.
The Hogwarts Express was majestic. Harry was transfixed with awe just looking at it.
A furrow forms between Malfoy’s eyebrows. “Right. Potter.”
"Yeah, and you only agree to play Quidditch with me during the summer." Theodore's voice held a bit of an accusatory tone in it, as if he still wasn't over the fact the Draco Malfoy got Harry to agree to join the Quidditch Team after years of his efforts in doing the same thing.
Harry Potter woke up from his dream with a start and a throbbing headache. He never could remember that part properly. It was still no less haunting though and he took a moment to clear all the blinding, red colour from behind his eyelids.
“Hey, it was a valiant effort.”
Harry's body moved before his mind could register what was happening.
Sighing, he burrowed deeper under the covers and succumbed to the drowsy effects of the potion, dreaming of kissing Draco Malfoy.
Potter, oblivious to Draco’s thoughts, frowned. “No repercussions. No demerits. Nobody else will know.”
At this, Harry turned a faint hue of red.
Then, still feeling like how Ron must have felt when he vomited slugs in second year, he marched towards the library.
this. This apparently newfound friendship that he had with Malfoy. Even if, he thought with grim amusement, that friendship was founded on shared trauma.
The boy was sitting in the same chair, reading something that suspiciously looked like it was about potions.
And it’s getting heavier now, as his surroundings were starting to become more and more familiar with each step he took. He hadn’t been in the Forest of Dean since they destroyed the locket, but he still knew that tree. And that clearing. That had been where they had made camp. Where the locket slowly ate at them and their fears, where Ron, with bloodshot eyes and an unfamiliar snarl on his lips, had stormed away after accusing them of things best forgotten.
"Is he…" he started, slowly getting back to his feet. "Has he been like that since…"
His chest heaved from the exertion of being in the air and at the thrill of flying, as well as the thrill of fearing for his life. He could almost drown out the deafening cheers of the students as he gazed at the egg in his hand.
"Come off it, Gin." It was Hermione who spoke, her voice quiet and soft. "You don't know either."
use.”
“There you are, Harry,” came Remus’ relieved voice from the doorway.
It was unnecessary.
Harry flushes at that. “But, I mean… Like your hand.”
It didn’t even register that the cat was currently sitting on his face, looking satisfied and pleased, because
“I have some more here,” Remus said instead, kneeling down and rummaging through the mess of his trunk in an effort to push his anger down. “I’ll give them to you and I’ll teach you how to draw a dog.”
Harry jumped as he realized for the first time that there were two more boys standing by the door. They were both big and burly, as if they could break Harry in half like a stick if he got on their bad side. But right now, they shuffled inside the compartment and took their seat across from him and Draco, nodding at him in greeting.
Lucius shook his head. "I do not know, Draco. I used the Triwizard Cup to Portkey us back to Hogwarts as soon as I had the chance to."
So with his heart beating nervously in his chest, he rounded the corner and headed straight for the Hospital Wing.
Harry shoved his three fingers closer to her face.
Not wanting to let this pass, he quickly got the Self-Erasing Parchment from his pocket and turned around in his chair, placing it on Malfoy's table to write on it.
He needs to leave. He knows he does. He always knows. But with Potter gone, it’s been getting harder and harder to get out of his head. He thought he was getting better.
Draco put both of his hands up in defence. "It's a genius money-making scheme!"
"You're still here. That means you're still in hiding from Brown and her little posse of delusional teenage girls," Draco said, shrugging. He raised his own eyebrow. "You still haven't gotten that Jinx off you."
He blinks, tries to stop himself from feeling happy about it. “Other people might call this stalking,” he says instead.
He'd probably have a bruised face and an even more bruised ego, and maybe even be rendered impotent forever, but that was inevitable from the beginning, wasn't it? At least, from the moment that Ginny had decided it was a good idea to hit him with the Lip-Lock Jinx while he was in mid-air, thus sending him to the infirmary at the same time that Draco was in there.
Harry smiled. “Professor.”
"Now we just need to tame that awful bedhead of yours, Harry," Pansy smiled sweetly, wand dangling from her hand.
Harry couldn't really blame the blush that suddenly covered Cedric's cheeks and ears. Even his own heart had skipped a beat. He blinked to himself to stay focused. Veela powers really were amazing.
Draco didn't skip a beat in his counting even as he replied, "Is this about snogging? Because I can tell you now, Potter, that you're not the first one to tell me that." He finished counting and wrote the number down on his parchment with a satisfied nod.
Her voice was quiet when she replied.
"Time for class," he muttered, looking pointedly at Harry's messy table of opened books.
If he weren't one of the champions, it would have been fine to go on his own, but as it was, the champions were to lead the dance and Harry didn't actually fancy dancing on his own with the whole school watching. And, well… there weren't actually many girls lining up to dance with Harry Potter, vampire, Slytherin, and potential Dark wizard.
"I do not
Resolutely ignoring Potter’s distance from him (or the utter
And it’s like a blow to the chest. Draco laughs, stunned and breathless, and he ducks his head, tries to stop the well of tears from falling.
The Dark Lord is in hiding. Trying to recuperate and gather back his followers. Cornelius Fudge still turned a blind, denying eye. Lucius and Narcissa were both fine, and Dumbledore had an unhealthy, disgusting obsession with lemon tarts.
He had said a small, nervous
Theodore just smirked smugly at the side every time. "If we'd have known that it would only take defeating a dragon to get these idiots to suck up to you, I'd have arranged for it a long time ago."
was the one waiting for it.
The Dark Lord was vanquished, dead, never seen again ever since he had Turned Harry Potter and got himself poisoned by Potter's blood. So he didn't really think much of it when his father told him to help Potter with the gillyweed, make sure Potter stayed in the Tournament, come with him on the evening of the Third Task,
Harry shrugged guiltlessly. His flat, his couch. He could sigh as loudly as he wanted.
He glances at Ron beside him, who just shrugs before returning to his breakfast, and then at Hermione across from him, who smiles at Astoria in greeting, before turning to Harry and nudging her chin towards the door. “Go on, then. We’ll save you a seat in Professor Slughorn’s class.”
He repeated it again when Seamus winked at Harry and practically purred, “Nice doing business with you, Harry.”
“Then what are you doing it for? Because you want to be friends with me?” Draco laughs, harsh and derisive, and Harry tries to stop the hurt from creeping in. “It’s

“Look, it’s Draco Malfoy!”
It was Harry’s turn to stare at Draco.
It was a far-flung thought, but a man could hope.
"— are looking for it?"
“It should be right around here,” he said hollowly, pointing to the spot where he had died. In Parseltongue, he asked,
he wrote, not really meaning the capital letters but it was just that his hand deemed it appropriate.
There was so much anger, so much pain and fear in the air, Harry felt like being submerged in a sea of lost souls and
Not with the expectations and repercussions of being Lucius Malfoy's son.
“I won’t do it,” Malfoy said again.
Ron stared some more.
"We already have three Champions, one from each school," Karkaroff agreed. He tapped his cane impatiently on the floor. "We have no need for a fourth one. No offense intended, my boy." He added the last part as an afterthought.
Harry is up on his feet in a heartbeat. “Malfoy.”
Draco spluttered in indignation at having his smooth skin so utterly defiled. "Potter, you ingrate –"
He focused all his attention on the feel of Draco’s hand in his instead.
With a grumble, Draco pushed his blankets off him, put on his slippers, and went downstairs to ask Kreacher for a mug of hot chocolate.
Harry grinned. "You want to stay here all day?"
he had thought in a delirious haze after the details of the mission had been explained.
Harry persisted. “
It is morning, and Draco is contemplating whether he’s dreaming or not, until Potter grabs his wrist and gently pulls him out of bed.
"He doesn't even
Harry keeps quiet. Ron knows him best. Knows his obsession with Malfoy best, because he was the one who was so against it that he had to go through the process of trying to understand it. Harry doesn’t know what Ron concluded at the end of that process, but Ron must have concluded
It didn’t pass his notice that other students thought he was actually an ally of Voldemort or the next Dark Lord or that he was a danger to them.
It was Malfoy’s.
“But if we start drinking a person’s blood, we’ll need that person’s blood our whole lives. It doesn’t sound very fun, sucking blood,” he finished with a thoughtful frown.
Twenty feet in the air, Draco let out a very frustrated growl. He let the cold wind whip at his hair, before running his hands through it and gripping it with a sigh.
He wondered what it must feel like for Potter.
Pansy interrupted him as loudly as before. "It would be an
a stray cat in the Auror Department of the Ministry of Magic and I'm looking for him. Have you seen him?"
Snape regarded him carefully, down his long, crooked nose. "The Goblet of Fire is an ancient magic made especially for the Triwizard Tournament. The Tournament itself is a ritual of sorts – its rules bound by the same ancient Charms. The Goblet ensures the following of those rules, all for the success of the Tournament. To remove you, after the Goblet has chosen you, would nullify all the magic surrounding it. It would stop the ritual. You yourself are now bound by a magical contract to see the Tournament through."
And it’s just like before. Time spent together in easy company and conversation. It becomes a nightly thing, Harry quietly slipping in after dinner and slipping out just before midnight. Draco asks him to come back, every time, which doesn’t really make a difference because Harry’s still going to come back anyway. He thinks Draco just likes the assurance.
"Sure," Harry agreed. "When they don't want to kill you."
A hopeful little thing bloomed in his chest.
But they did entertain themselves with a little bit of gossip about their co-workers, particularly Hartsman and the underground betting system that he had set up which wasn’t so underground considering every Auror in the workforce knew of it.
Ron simply rolled his eyes exasperatedly. "Well, go on then. I'll go have a romantic dinner with my girlfriend, and you go have one with yours."
– shaking, cold fingertips touching cold metal finally,
Draco's smirk widened. "You think so highly of that Hufflepuff?"
He watched as Ronald Weasley’s expression transformed from shock, distress, and then to a fearful resignation.
Draco’s eyes twinkled at the challenge. “You wish, Potter.”
Even his shame at having flown in front of so many people after so many years of telling himself that he wouldn't – for the Draco Before the Time Turner – was starting to disappear. After all, Draco After the Time Turner didn't seem to hate him for it.
much of a deterrent to stop people from enjoying his aerial battle to the death with a fire-breathing dragon. Some had actually stopped in the hallway to greet him or give him high-fives. The former Harry responded to with confused nods of greeting and the last he responded to with dumb stares, until the students would laugh, forcibly take his arm, and raise it up for a high-five.
