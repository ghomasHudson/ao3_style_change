“I’m sorry. Malfoy. You have to know the Ministry keeps a file on you. You have to know they keep tabs on everything you do, even anonymously.”
Draco drew off him, rested his damp forehead against Harry’s thigh. Harry hissed as Draco’s fingers slipped out of him. Let his head thunk back against the floor.
When he is sure that Robards has gone into his own office for the morning, he slips down the hall and into the lift to the canteen with the help of a notice-me-not charm. He’s getting quite good at skulking around the office, he muses. Of course, when he gets to the canteen (and when he remembers to lift the notice-me-not after failing to capture the attention of the severe-looking attendant), Harry finds that he has no appetite, so he orders the least offensive thing on the menu—a cheese toastie—and takes it back to his office with a cup of strong tea.
Suddenly, Harry is standing in the little cottage again, in the comforting neatness that probably few others see. Malfoy’s haven for himself, the homey comforts meant for no one else but Malfoy, which Harry barged into.
This time, unlike the last, Malfoy pushed it in. He went slowly, but even so, Harry felt like he was being dragged inside out. He couldn’t make a noise.
people. Serving with a smile—albeit, sometimes it was a smirk, and sometimes with a face that looked almost like a question mark. He was as animated as ever, but he wasn’t insulting anyone, and he was taking orders as much as giving them, by the looks of it, and he wasn’t holding court, although many of the customers came away laughing at something he said.
Hermione blew out a breath. “Well, yeah. But he asked us not to tell you.” Her face was carefully neutral.
Gently, Harry gripped Malfoy’s arm and lifted it. Malfoy watched warily, like he was waiting to see what Harry would do next. Harry had no idea, himself. But he found himself stroking the soft skin of the forearm over the tattoo, feeling the faint scar. He placed a kiss to the inside of the elbow and then traveled down towards the wrist with his mouth.
Hermione closes one book and reaches for another. Harry marvels at how completely absorbed she is despite Malfoy being in the same room. It gives him an odd feeling he can’t categorize. Something like wonder, maybe, and a bit like amusement, though the feeling comes with a hard edge that lodges inside his chest.
Harry did. A moment later, he felt the prickle of an unexpected Cleaning Charm, and squawked. Then Malfoy’s tongue was on him again, and Harry’s protest was forgotten. Malfoy traced around the base of Harry’s cock and nipped his way to the crease of Harry’s inner thigh, pausing to murmur things like, “The sounds you’re making—you’re desperate for it, aren’t you?” and “I can’t wait to taste you properly.” They sounded almost conversational, almost like Harry should reply—but Harry could only remember the words “
“The spicy dill pickle should be ready soon,” Luna said, in that wonderful way she had of suddenly changing the subject. “You’ve come back just at the right time, Pansy.”
After a while, Harry lost track of the number of beers he’d had. He ordered a porter on his next go around, which elicited an impressed expression from Malfoy. With more beer, the burn of attraction became more bearable. Almost pleasant. He forgot why he’d been trying not to watch Malfoy. He liked watching Malfoy. He’d always liked watching Malfoy, hadn’t he? He’d just never noticed before how captivating it was to see Malfoy’s lips on a drink glass, his throat bobbing as he swallowed.
Malfoy rises, more slowly. He’s still looking at Harry like Harry’s a puzzle to which he’s just found the last pieces, only he doesn’t know how they fit. “Of course. Thank you for your hospitality.”
Malfoy claimed the bed near the window without a word and set his bag down on it. Harry set his own down on the other. He didn’t know why he should feel so uncomfortable and self-conscious. He and Malfoy had clicked so well up till then, so he didn’t know… Were they just going to sleep? Separately? Not that sleep was a bad idea. Just. A
It is half past four when Harry steps through Malfoy’s floo. He’s come straight over as quickly as he could without drawing attention. He had the report done by noon and spent the rest of the day going through more files on Poesy Potions to fill in the time before delivering the report to Robards at half past three, partly to keep himself out of Robards’ sight until shortly before leaving, and partly to keep himself from contacting Malfoy or Hermione in the middle of his work day at the Ministry. He had not, however, been able to abstain from running some reconnaissance and learning that it was Malfoy’s solicitor who had managed to postpone the hearing. Harry hid in his office for the rest of the day mostly so no one would be able to read the relief on his face.
Harry set a brutal rhythm with both his hips and his hand, pulling Draco off. A frisson of alarm went up his spine as he realized he was on the brink, and this time he wouldn’t be able to hold it off. But then Draco was keening, his body tightening around Harry’s—and for a moment, Harry thought he himself had come because his hand was covered with wet warmth, but no, it wasn’t his own, it was Draco’s, and that realization undid him and then
He landed on the balcony and set the broom in its corner. Looking down at himself and the rumpled, dirt-smudged state of his clothes, he thought he could use a second shower and a change of clothes before he saw Malfoy.
The cupboard he’d come through looked like another part of the room, the coats all lined up on their bar. He hovered next to it for a moment, still half tempted to take Luna up on the offer of company. But he closed the door and sat down in one of the chairs by the stove.
Luna didn’t seem to notice Harry’s discomfort. She settled next to Harry on the grass. “Not wanting to wake that early is understandable. A baker’s schedule is not for everyone. Don’t worry, though. I’ve got something else I think you’ll enjoy.”
Harry was so accustomed to Diagon Alley. Even though it had grown over the years, there was still only one ice cream shop, one bookshop, one shop for school uniforms.
Draco slurped off of him. Harry’s vision greyed. Draco said, “I am going to undress you and take you apart.”
The scent of pine wafted out. Someone in the Black family had loved Christmas. Harry almost fell into the crate while taking an inventory of its contents: snow globes filled with real snow, an angel that sang (but unfortunately didn’t want to stop), an Everlasting Tree thirty feet tall—all jumbled in a vast space created by an Undetectable Extension Charm and lit with floating green and silver candles.
Harry came to stand next to Malfoy, not close enough to bump elbows, but close enough to reach out and touch him if he wanted. He tucked his hands into his back pockets.
“No, you don’t,” she said sharply, then added, “But that’s okay. Don’t strain yourself catching up on six years of life in the broomshed. Luna forgives you, and I really don’t give a shit. And if you’re jealous of Malfoy, you need to get over it.”
“I—” He blinked away the vivid memory of Malfoy gazing at him from his place in bed, eyes guarded as Harry grasped his forearm.
“It’s pretty simple, Malfoy. I was hit by a curse and a potion. We were on a case looking into illegal brewing. You might have heard of that sort of thing? There was a wand fight, and I was hit by a curse. The barrel of potion next to me was hit as well, and I was doused. It was one of the experimental ones we were investigating the brewer for, so we don’t know what it was. We don’t know the spell that hit me, either.
“Going to arrest me in that state, are you?” Before Potter could get a word out of his frowning mouth, Draco said, “No, I don’t sell potions to muggles. I—” He barely stopped himself from telling Potter that he sold
“Maybe. If I had no other option and I was hungry. Like I am now. Starve or don’t, but the rest of us would like lunch while they’re still serving.”
“You really are something,” Malfoy said, but Harry was pleased when Malfoy took a drink from the coffee. His eyes crinkled at Harry over the rim.
which he still hasn’t looked at yet. Wonders how many witches and wizards have read it by now, along with the article in the
Over the course of the evening—and an early morning spent watching the dawn from the balcony—Harry had come to the conclusion that Ginny and Luna
“Good job, team!” Ginny said a few minutes later, when the last of the mounds had been closed and the angry mob of fairies had disappeared over the trees.
One of Malfoy’s eyebrows—the one under the white fringe of hair—rises. Harry swallows dryly, then takes another drink of brandy to wet his mouth.
Robards grunted. “If that’s your choice, you can tell Shacklebolt yourself. He won’t hear it from me.”
Luna interrupted the conversation to let out a musical burp and a single purple bubble that floated, shining, from her mouth towards the ceiling.
Malfoy turned to lean his knees against the short wall as he looked down at the city. “The other thing I do with my time? Spy.”
All the while, he staunchly ignored the crawling sensation of being watched that itched over his shoulders. Twice, he refrained from snapping at Potter to stop staring at him. By the time he sat down with his steaming bowl of soup and cheese, Draco realized he had another problem.
Ginny slowed the car and took them onto a narrow lane that led down, down, down and around a bend, where the trees cleared and revealed swathes of rolling golden hills, meandering fences, and a house surrounded by lush gardens.
This made Draco feel self-conscious. Draco should not have felt self-conscious. Harry Potter was transparent and had shown up unannounced at Draco’s house. Draco had a
Harry knew Malfoy was being a tosser, but he couldn’t help but smile back. Malfoy was wearing one of the hats, after all—the baseball cap—which was absurd because it was a
“Though some with unrefined tastes can’t appreciate the history that went into that. They treat it like a shot of tequila,” Malfoy said.
“A full-bodied wheat beer. Technically an ale, since it’s top-fermented. Did you even notice the color? It’s cloudy because it’s unfiltered.”
“Close the door, Potter,” Robards said. Then, when Harry was seated: “Davies has retired. I’ll be stepping into her position as Head of the DMLE.”
Draco stood and deposited his bowl and dish on the counter. He cast a stasis charm over both. Glancing at the clock, he said, “I need bread, and if I’m to get any today, I need to leave before the shops close.”
Harry was nearly crying from pleasure. He couldn’t control the sounds. Malfoy moaned in wicked imitation of him and dug his nails in, bright points of pain-pleasure against Harry’s arse.
It occurred to Harry that he’d placed Malfoy into the position he was most used to having sex with women in. Not that he hadn’t had sex in other positions. He just defaulted to this one. He felt a small moment of uncertainty at this, but then, Malfoy hadn’t resisted, was staring at him with pupils blown wide.
“You are not people.” Malfoy stood and held out a hand. For one awkward moment, Harry thought Malfoy wanted to hold his hand. Then he thought Malfoy wanted to shake it. Then he thought maybe Malfoy wanted his credit card. So that’s what he gave him.
“Harry Potter and his sense of righteousness. You can’t stand to have something weighing on your conscience. Well, you’ll have to live with this one, won’t you?”
The next morning, Harry had his coffee and pastry before climbing to the attic. He spent that first day rearranging the mess into rough piles. On the second day, he chose the pile in the furthest corner to start with, picked the largest chest, and opened it.
He righted the tower, scooped the dirt back into the pots, and placed the pots with their daffodils back onto the tower, grimacing as the flowers brayed in his face. He reached for his wand, encountered sticky damp fabric, crossed his eyes in disgust, and cast a charm to secure the stand and the pots inside of it.
The floo activated again later that night. This time, Harry was passed out on the sofa with a throw pulled over him when the flames exploded nearly out of the fireplace, and Hermione stepped out, scowling and with her mouth set in a determined line.
He’s alone on the lift. He’s giddy, blood and magic thrumming. Robards’ outraged face stays in his mind, but he can’t stop smiling. He’s got the file.
He tries to draw a breath, but there is simply nothing there. The magic coils tight in his chest where his lungs should be.
Her song ended, and she and Ginny cast a spell to dig a hole into the ground. Then she led them down the hill to the sick tree. Despite her care, it looked even more poorly than it had when Harry had first seen it: its leaves a charred black, shriveled and curling. Harry had a flashback to Dumbledore’s withered hand, and he shivered despite the heat.
At the sharp tone in his voice, Ginny sat up, laughter gone. She rubbed a tear from the corner of her eye. “Why not?”
Harry looks down, breathless with adrenaline. Hermione’s face appears in the fire, shifting in the floo flames.
Inside the fridge, there was a half-filled carton of eggs. Harry pulled the little pink egg from his shirt pocket, rubbed it clean with his thumb, and tucked it inside the carton. Then, he went upstairs.
He has the biscuit with the rest of his wine. Then he helps Ron levitate all of the dishes into the sink and set the cleaning charms. It’s just a small bit of magic, though it makes Ron furrow his brow. Ron, however, doesn’t say a thing, and Harry pretends he didn’t see the disapproving expression. It’s just another thing he’s got used to over the last year. His friends care for him, that’s all.
He shakes his head. He can’t help a tight smile. It takes him a minute to find his wand on a shelf of cans. He pulls the golden tendrils from his temple and directs them into the square mirror. The words form.
Potter shrugged. “Fair treatment campaigns are more Hermione’s thing than mine. Potions ingredients have to come from somewhere, I guess.” He wrinkled his nose, though, which either indicated his thoughts on the origins of ingredients or his thoughts on the art of potions in general.
His shoulders itch with the feeling of being watched as he approaches the door. But the lacy curtains on the windows remain still. The bronze door knocker features a cat holding a violin and bow. The words
He crossed the train tracks into the more industrial-looking neighborhood with its equipment supply and repair shops. His stomach tightened. He stopped at a corner to read a metal plaque on a building’s wall, something about it being a historical landmark. (The idea of a 20th century building being historical still baffled him.)
Harry jerks the page away. “Oh fuck off, Malfoy,” he says, half laughing despite himself. He straightens the paper out, dismayed to discover his hands are suddenly moist. Ignores Malfoy’s lazy smirk as the man sits back in his chair and drapes an elbow over the top of it.
She groped in the little box between them and tossed a package onto his lap. It crinkled as it landed.
He talks with the same voice he uses on Rose, the gentle one. That’s okay with Harry. He lets his eyes drift shut.
Draco gave Potter his most pleasant smile and experienced the joy of watching the other man’s expression turn uncomfortable.
Despite the misty rain, the walk was pleasant, and he’d had a good visit with Grace at the shop, though as he approached the cottage, an inexplicable tension mounted in him. It grew more intense as he passed within the front gate and made his way up the path.
He took the next exit, which wasn’t the correct one, as they’d already passed it, (“We wouldn’t have missed it if you hadn’t wasted time complaining,” Harry pointed out) and spent the next forty minutes navigating the dense urban maze. Malfoy treated Harry to an ongoing rant about construction, street closures, and detours.
“Yeah,” Harry said, because he had, and what was the point of pretending he hadn’t? Even if it was annoying to see the smirk that appeared on Malfoy’s face. Only—it wasn’t annoying, really. Harry liked the smirk. It made Malfoy look like the boy he remembered, which was something of a relief—but also, confusing. It made Harry’s gut flip.
So, the case opened back when he was out. That makes sense. Though he’s not sure how it makes him feel. It’s like he’s lost step with the department, like he’s not quite part of the team, and he hasn’t been able to shake the feeling—especially since every time he thinks he’s caught up, that he’s regained his balance, something like
He frowned, set down the fork—with the radish still impaled on its tines—and spooned up some of the soup.
Harry grimaced. “Why a coffee shop? Why Oregon, for that matter? I find it hard to believe you followed Ginny and Luna here.”
in one hand. It slaps him in the face, but Hermione doesn’t seem to notice. She’s too busy saying, “Did you see it? Harry, it was brilliant!”
Harry shouldn’t have been telling Malfoy this, but then, he wouldn’t see him again—at least, not anytime soon—and he needed to say it out loud at least once: “I’m not capable of anything else.”
To Potter, Draco said, “Yes, I can. You’re an auror, you should know you can’t just go traipsing around the countryside like a lost spirit. But you also can’t stay in my kitchen twenty-four hours a day. So I’ll put you in the guest room.”
It could have been anyone, of course. He was across the street, and years separated Harry from the blond boy he remembered. But there was something about the way the man moved, the narrowness of his chin, that particular expression of concentration.
Malfoy’s cock stood up to greet him. He shot a smug look at Malfoy, who stared back with glazed eyes.
It wasn’t like Harry had to go, and it’d taken him forever to fall asleep, no thanks to that chai drink. He could just throw back a Sleeping Potion and sleep in tomorrow. But that was probably what Malfoy wanted.
“Yes! It’s not the right time of year now, but I think with the right spellwork we should be able to gather enough of the roots for it to settle into its new home without causing it too much shock. We’ll probably need a few people, though. These kinds of spells always work better when done together.”
The rest of it is no more than a blur to Harry. Hills and Bate visiting, Malfoy’s back turned to him in anger. Hermione’s call. Malfoy’s empty house. The alarming and embarrassing scene of Harry lying in bed surrounded in the blue glow of the breathing charm.
Robards’ face appeared in flames gone green. “Potter,” he said severely, as if reprimanding him for conveniently being there when he called. “They reversed the potion.”
Potter looked around the kitchen, gaze alighting on the hummingbird suncatcher in the window (catching no sun), the knife block, the muggle toaster.
Malfoy smirked. Then he narrowed his eyes. “It’s interesting how some things don’t change, isn’t it?”
That’s not to mention the other thing the memories revealed to him, which he needs time and space to examine—or simply bury.
“Your home is beautiful,” Hermione says in a cool tone, hands folded on her lap. Only Harry can see that her fingers are clutched tight.
Draco frowned. Along the fence-line, the skeletal tangle of his rose bushes shook. For a moment, he thought it was the work of a wind, but the plum tree nearby stood still; not a flower twitched.
As a reward, he showed Harry how to swap the hats around so they didn’t get bored on one shelf. The next half hour found Harry rearranging hats, who were never satisfied with how he placed them.
Muzzy with wine and a full stomach, Harry lets his thoughts drift to Malfoy. No matter how he looks at it, it has to be a trick.
Her eyes are sad, her mouth tight. “I mean you haven’t been happy working in the office, and field work is too dangerous for you.”
“So there you have it,” Malfoy said as they left, and locked the fridge behind them once again. “This has been my life for the last four years.”
door.” He jabs a finger at a closed door a few feet away. “That’s the only other door you are allowed through. And I mean that literally. There’s a locking charm on your own, if you can think to activate it. It’s your own problem if you can’t manage it. If you need anything else, shout.” Malfoy gives an owlish blink. “It’ll be in vain, but I’d be entertained.”
The last time he’d seen Malfoy was in line at the canteen two weeks ago. Thursday. Harry remembered because the special was meatloaf, when it was normally rosemary chicken, and Malfoy had got into a mild argument with the server over it.
“She’d love that! You know, she found a jar of blackberry preserves she’d forgotten about and wanted to send that along to you, but in my old age, I forgot to bring it.”
Harry might have made a retort to that, but he was arrested by the sound of her voice. He couldn’t put his finger on what was different about it.
“I buy my potion-making equipment here,” Malfoy said, gesturing to a shop as they passed. A display of small cauldrons had been set up outside; the words SALE spelled themselves out in yellow light above. Behind them, a Medieval-looking contraption loomed in the front window: a structure like a table surrounded by metal arms with hooks and graspers. Seeing Harry’s expression, Malfoy said, “It bottles potions for you. And I get my ingredients there,” he added as they passed the next shop. Pungent smells wafted out. “These two are owned by siblings.”
He sits in a chair and puts his head in his hands. It’s such a stupid thing to worry about, really. A spot of embarrassment, nothing earth-shattering. And really, the most embarrassing thing of all was the scene he made in Malfoy’s kitchen, the way he treated them both, especially Hermione.
He didn’t even mind Malfoy’s barbs and jabs. Why should he, as long as Malfoy murmured them so only Harry could hear? And Malfoy was full of shit, anyway. Harry remembered the way Malfoy had carefully protected his ice cream cone and taken Harry all the way to the top of Portland to eat it.
When he’d first seen the participants, he had been surprised. A part of him had forgotten that Ginny taught at the college, and he’d assumed that the training camp would be for teenagers. So, it was a bit of a shock to see people ranging from late teens to his age and older. The teens were responsive and respectful. The adults were curious and humble. He’d become so used to working with sullen Auror trainees and colleagues who were burned out and apathetic. Here, he was filled with energy.
At that, one corner of Malfoy’s mouth quirked up. Then, he launched into a story about Harry’s (mis)adventures with bread-baking and hat-selling and latte-pouring.
It was good that they could joke about it now. There had been a number of rocky years, when—after realizing that their feelings for each other went deeper than the bond forged between Auror partners—they had navigated choppy waters. The DMLE had a strict policy against amorous entanglements between law enforcement partners. So, for a time, they’d tried splitting and working with other partners, but it had been difficult—for Harry, especially—to focus on work, particularly when either of them came into the office with fresh wounds or curse damage. Eventually, after months of strained interactions, arguments, and (for Harry) disciplinary meetings, they both decided to step down from the Aurors.
It was hard to tell if Potter was blushing, though he did look distinctly put out. His eyes narrowed and his mouth tightened and he said, “I don’t use the bathroom. I don’t need sleep. No sex drive.”
, and Harry made a noise he’d never made before. Malfoy rumbled against him, pulled him closer, began to eat him out in earnest.
“Hermione told me I ought to apologize. So I called to apologize.” He says the bit about Hermione on purpose, because it’s easier if he blames it on her. And also, he’d rather be mocked for taking directions from Hermione again than for admitting he simply wanted to see Malfoy.
He has her full attention once more. He’s hot under the collar and doubting he should have said anything at all. Quickly, he says, “But I was wondering. Have you ever found yourself on the wrong side, when you thought you were on the right side?”
“That’s good to hear. Do you have plans for the day? There’s a very kind man who runs a non-magical bicycle shop in town. Do you know anything about bicycles? I thought you might be interested in learning.”
He slammed the last book closed and looked at his notes. “So what I have gleaned from all of this is the potion smelled like licorice—by which you probably mean anise or fennel, but Merlin knows which one—and it, quote, ‘Had the viscosity of custard that hasn’t set long enough.’ Do I have all of that right?”
Harry’s heart sped up. He was a little warm and loose from the beer, so had to pause a moment, holding his breath, before he said, “I’d love it, but I’m leaving back to England in a few days.”
“That’s what I’m not sure about. He could be.” But it’s clear she’s biting her lip, even through the fire. “We had plans this evening. He’s never not answered his floo before. Everything was dark, and—I’m sorry to bother you, Harry, but I’ve just got a bad feeling about this. I was calling to tell him Ron’s stuck at work and Rose is sick. I can’t get away from the house.”
bookshop. The biggest in America, even by non-magical standards. But it’s even bigger than the non-magicals know.” Malfoy shot Harry an evil grin, and Harry nearly walked into the edge of the door.
“What?” Harry pulled his attention away from the circulation desk, where a staff member went quickly through a stack of books, stamping them for a patron. The magical tattoo of a flock of birds turned and coalesced and scattered again over their arm and neck. He turned back to Malfoy, who was holding a hand out, obviously waiting for the slip of paper.
The nicest part of being taken upstairs by Malfoy was Malfoy preceding Harry up them. In fact, if Harry hung back a few steps—which he certainly did because he could not allow an opportunity like this to pass, untaken—if he hung back a few steps, his eyes were level with Malfoy’s arse.
When he settles the glasses back on his nose, he sees Hermione is watching him from the fire. “How’d you know Malfoy was angry about it?” he asks.
“Yes…” he says slowly. “You would, wouldn’t you? I enjoyed myself, reading those articles about you in the paper.”
It takes four vicious swipes of his wand to vanish all of the glitter. Then he stills, afraid he’s inhaled some of it. Then he becomes angry, frustrated that the worry has become instinctive.
Harry followed her gaze across the room, and his stomach gave a jolt when he recognized Malfoy in one of the corner booths. He was wearing the baseball cap pulled down low, nearly to his eyes. And Pansy Parkinson was sitting next to him.
roll his eyes. “I figured that much. I’m just—surprised, frankly. I thought you were too good for that.”
Harry veered just in time not to crash. He tumbled to the grass. It crackled beneath him, and smelled sweet and like baked earth. The ground was still warm from the day, and Harry might have lain there for a minute, except the broom handle pressed hard into his side.
“I used to think so, but it’s got quite a unique flavor, you know. You can tell when you compare it to other poultry, especially when it’s very fresh. Shall I make you an egg, then?”
Harry didn’t have the chance to ask Malfoy what charm he used to block the kitchen’s light from the front of the shop. He turned back to find Malfoy giving him a once-over. Malfoy waved his wand.
But as he got closer, he heard the distinct click of the lock. Harry hesitated and then opened the door. The little bell rang cheerfully into the dark.
Harry took a sheepish step inside. Andromeda’s gaze fell to the chest in Harry’s arms and then lifted again to his face, the serene mask of a good hostess. For the first time in a long while, Harry noted how much like Narcissa she looked. How she looked a little bit like Draco.
By which Harry takes it the university was disinclined to throw its support behind an ex-Death Eater, when it came down to it.
“Brulee caramel, extra whip,” said the woman with the purple streaks, and set a mug in front of Harry. The mug was roughly the size of a small soup bowl, and there were lemon zest shavings on top of the whip as well as a narrow shortbread biscuit. “And a Black Forest sandwich.”
A part of Harry felt silly, pressing kisses to the palm of Draco Malfoy’s hand. He’d never done anything like this with anyone else but Ginny. But there was something deep and raw about this moment, Malfoy watching Harry explore the tattoo that represented his remorse.
Malfoy chuckled and rubbed a hand over Harry’s arse, kneading it. His damp thumb left a trail of moistness over Harry’s skin.
Harry paid attention to more of the doors and windows that they walked by. Now that he knew what he was looking at, he noticed the symbol on more doors than he had before.
A lot of good it did Harry. Three months and almost no lead. They’d tracked dealers and found them all obliviated. Staged operations on ultimately empty warehouses. Attempted to place undercover agents; no success.
When they are all served and sipping their tea like good posh fops, Malfoy straightens and says, “So. Granger. What has Potter told you?”
“Oh. That probably was Draco, then,” Luna said. “Was he making rye sourdough? He usually makes the rye on Wednesdays.”
Of all the establishments not to make use of Wizard Space, the hat shop seemed to need it the most. It was one of the smaller shops in the alley, barely wide enough for Harry to fit his shoulders into. It reminded him vaguely of Luna’s basement library, except instead of books, Harry was pressed in on all sides by stacks and stacks of hats: hats that greeted him, that sparkled, that gave off warmth or the faint smell of sandalwood. A number of hats featured animal parts—or even whole animals, like Neville’s grandmother’s vulture hat had. To Harry’s relief, there were no actual vulture hats, although he wasn’t sure hats with squirrels or songbirds were any better. (“All creatures humanely sourced” read a sign.) There were hats with mechanical animals, too, and outlandish-looking brass spectacles.
Harry lowered the letter, heart pounding. A cold sweat had broken out on his brow. He felt a bit sick, not because he’d apparently stumbled across Sirius’s secret stash of love letters from Lupin—well, not because they were
Harry went with him. Maybe it was the lack of malice in Malfoy’s expression. Even the words “don’t be a stubborn arse” had been spoken in an exhausted tone, almost plaintive.
“For fuck’s sake, Malfoy, I’m not—” Potter lowered his voice. “I’m not dead. Please don’t make me keep saying it.”
They sat on a bench and looked down over the city. Interesting to see it from above—the neat grid pattern so different from London’s organic sprawl. A short wall separated the park’s footpath from the overlook’s drop-off. Along it grew a tangle of rose bushes, and there was also a small telescope. Harry wasn’t sure if that was for looking at stars or for looking at the streets and buildings below. It reminded him of the Astronomy Tower, though this bright and breezy afternoon was a world away from that memory.
He Apparated to a little alley close to Malfoy’s shop and walked across the street. Though it was summer, it was cool enough that Harry cast a Warming Charm.
“Exactly what it sounds like. I like your house.” At Draco’s narrowed eyes, Potter rolled his own. “It’s not the Manor, is it? This is…much more down to earth. I was at least expecting a few swans or partridges.”
Every hair follicle on his arms prickled as Potter leaned closer to see the parchment, but Draco staunchly ignored the sensation. He explained the breakdown of the costs: facility fees to cover wear and tear on equipment, the charge for Draco’s time (it felt satisfying to quantify that), and approximate supply costs—
Draco slammed the final book in place at the top of the stack and slapped his notes down on it. “I think you’re in no place to defend anyone right now, Potter. Anyway. I need lunch.”
Malfoy, an Unspeakable who’d gone undercover to help suss out the potion ring. More departments than just the DMLE were involved; this news itself shocked Harry. The Ministry’s involvement in the investigation went deeper than he’d known.
He is still standing there when the three of them return a quarter of an hour later. By then, he’s had time to process his own shock at the situation, so he’s aware enough that he can recognize the pinch of anxiety around Malfoy’s mouth when Hills announces his intention to search the rest of the ground floor.
He’d spent the morning with Luna checking in on the animals and poking around the sick tree, then looking through the stacks of books in the basement’s magical library. The magical library was another room that used Wizard Space. It was hidden through a closet door in the normal basement, which was furnished with walls of bookshelves and plush old chairs. The books in the non-magical part of the basement included a lot on gardening, Muggle medicinal herbs, and 19th-century medical texts.
Sophie invited him to sit at the desk and handed him an undecorated hat, a spool of ribbon, needles, and a feather. Then he wandered off with an inventory scroll and a quill, leaving Harry to his own devices. Within minutes, Harry had dropped the spool, chased the unraveling ribbon across the floor, jabbed himself with the huge needle, and snapped the feather. Harry also managed to crumple the brim of the hat.
The tight thread of magic is there, inside of him. It’s bound around his lungs, drawn taut by its connection with Malfoy’s wards. If he had time, Harry would separate the magic carefully from himself so that it continued to support the wards. As it is, he snaps the connection like a string, and the wards go slack.
“You are delectable. So ready for it. But you’re like that with everything, aren’t you? So ready to dive in, head first.”
Draco bit the inside of his mouth against the things he wanted to say. “I need you to tell me the details of your incident again. Now that I’m over the shock. Maybe miraculously you’ll tell me something I can use, this time.”
For an instant, fury clenched Harry’s throat. Then it was gone, and Harry covered the tattoo with his hand, lightly encircling Malfoy’s forearm.
Malfoy reminded Harry sharply of Lucius in that moment, which shouldn’t have been funny, but Harry chuckled anyway. “Yes,” he said.
Edward grinned down at him. “The clumsiness of youth,” he said, and Draco didn’t have the breath to refute him. He was miffed and half-drenched with rank-smelling muck, and could
Hermione accepts the parchment from him and gives it a critical eye. She marks a change on it with a quill. Then Harry finds himself the recipient of her full intense focus. “Have you got the files I asked for?”
“Yes, I have an idea, seeing as I’m the one who made pains to make himself untrackable. Didn’t you stop to wonder if there were a reason why? Maybe I didn’t want to be found.”
She showed him the metal mesh baskets they placed the dry additions into rather than adding them directly into the warts—“since we don’t filter our beers.” Harry vaguely recognized some of the ingredients from Potions class and from Luna’s herb room at the farm. Did Malfoy know about these beers? Of course he had to. Malfoy knew virtually everything about beer and coffee and potions and magical and non-magical life in Oregon.
It took a moment for Harry to find the trays in question. Meanwhile, Malfoy Summoned dry ingredients from their containers and cast weighing charms and set them to mix in bowls. Harry pulled out the trays and figured out the charms that let him see the amount of time that the dough had been allowed to rise until the Stasis Charm kicked in, which made him feel good.
The roses had done well, even having gone neglected for decades. At Harry’s direction, they were the only plants that had been spared the pruning charms, besides the trees. Their pink and red and spotted blooms grew all over. Harry wondered if they were magical. He’d be surprised if they weren’t. Maybe Ginny and Luna could bring a preserved cutting to the brewpub’s rose expert.
calm, maybe he holds himself too still, because she slants a sideways look at him, eyes bright with a hard amusement.
Malfoy shook his head in mock ruefulness. “I give up. He will never learn the finer appreciation for good beer.”
, Hermione’s words, the case file. Emotions roll through him like currents, dragging him in one direction and then the other: relief that he left the DMLE, incredulity that he let the Ministry go on being corrupted all around him, fierce annoyance at himself for leaving, because now he no longer has access to Ministry resources.
Harry was still waking up. He’d thought he would have another laid back morning with Luna, making breakfast and meandering around the farm. Instead, Ginny had appeared at his door while he was still on the edge of sleep and waking, too cheerful for six in the morning.
“Potter quit the Aurors,” Malfoy said. “He’s been experiencing other options.” He lifted his water glass and smiled at Harry over the rim. This was another smile Harry hadn’t seen in a while. Taunting. Though, it was tinged with a salacious edge. Between that and the slight emphasis on “experiencing other options,” Harry didn’t know what to make of it.
Malfoy, Ginny, and Luna tucked into their food. It took a few minutes for Harry to realize that Luna hadn’t said anything else since their meals had arrived. She stared at her food with an expression he hadn’t seen on her face since Hogwarts—a crease between her eyebrows, her mouth turned down.
But the bird called and called, an ear-splitting trill that came from much closer than it should have, as if it’d flown into his room.
“Draco Malfoy,” he murmurs, smiling at the little grunt of pleased surprise this elicits, and pulls the body atop his closer.
“Sir, we understand that there’s been some question about Mr. Malfoy’s testimony and the veracity of Auror Potter’s memories. We’re here to offer
He was curled on the floor, half disconnected from himself, hanging onto his body by a thread. He could sense the veil. He could let go if he wanted, could cut the last threads and float away. Only his stubbornness kept him holding on, the unwillingness to let the bastard potioneers get the better of him.
Harry was wrong. That voice isn’t pleasant. It’s honeyed poison, and he’s just noticed the warning bitter bite of it. He wishes he had a better response for the question, but he’s bad at lying in a good moment, and in this one, he’s full of caffeine and alcohol. “Things didn’t work out, and I never met anyone else I’m interested in.” Then, swinging his gaze back to Malfoy’s, he says, “And what about you? No white-haired Malfoy snakelings slithering about, I notice.”
“Yes,” Malfoy breathed, and then he was whispering filthy nothings into Harry’s ear. “You’re so tight, Harry. So tight for me. I’m gonna make you feel so good. Gonna ruin you for anyone else.”
The rectangles of dough, by themselves, seemed non-threatening enough. But within minutes, Harry was involved in the hell that was baking fresh croissants.
Malfoy is the one who opens his grip, letting Harry go. Harry brushes his palm against his trouser leg. His face flames. It has to be the blood catching up to his head.
Harry stares at Malfoy, wondering what potions byproducts have to do with Hogwarts letters. He knows he’s missing something obvious. Then: “The waste makes squibs.” Cold washes through him. “Right? Is that what you’re saying? But I don’t get it. They knew about this and so they moved their operations to a muggle community. Wizards don’t use the muggle water supply.”
A steady stream of customers flowed in and out of the shop after that. Harry slipped into the rhythm of helping people. It turned out he wasn’t particularly good at choosing the right hats for people. However, he seemed to have a knack for making people smile and for drawing in passersby who had only paused to glance at some of the gaudy hats in the doorway. Also, he apparently had a knack for selling hats, even some of the more outrageous ones.
Ginny and Luna didn’t look at each other, but there was a brief, charged moment of silence, a silent current that ran between them.
“I’m at Malfoy’s house,” Harry says in a low voice. “Malfoy’s not here, and it’s been cleaned out. Did he say he was going anywhere? Taking his research somewhere?”
He dozed, drifting in and out of wakefulness to watch the sky and the tops of trees flash by. He wondered where they were, but then, it didn’t matter because they were
Charlie laughed. “It does! Our Brewmaster’s Beer is a marvel, but also a bit like us shooting ourselves in the foot. Since guests can taste the quality in our brews, we have another incentive to do things right. So we use fresh berries for the Princess Charming and preserve them in stasis for some limited release runs when they’re out of season.”
He walked past the herb room to the closed door at the end of the short hall. He kept this one double-locked and under a disillusionment charm. With a muggle girl occasionally running amok, he didn’t take chances; he knew what kind of mischief kids got into even at a tender age. Although after today, he’d have to reconsider safeguarding his entire cottage. And what, then, was the reason for living
“Oh.” He saw them now. They were so small—no bigger than his thumb—and wiggling over each other. Every so often, they came in contact with one of the ward walls and turned sharply.
While Malfoy spoke, he led Harry to the sitting room off the entrance hall. He sat neatly on an upholstered chair and placed his hands on his knees.
“Yes,” Malfoy says, the sharp voice pulling Harry back to the present, and Harry realizes he was absorbed with taking in the entry room. He turns to see Malfoy regarding him with open wariness now. But his arms are not crossed, they are at his sides, one held slightly out to the small side table that hugs the wall. The posture strikes Harry as vulnerable. “Poesy Potions.”
“Yes, actually. It’s too cloudy to see the stars right now, but there are sounds to listen to out here, at least, and I don’t feel like I’m locked in a trunk. Far more interesting than a room, in any case. And I’ve got used to being outside.”
“Oh, do you know another Draco? I only know the one. It’s not a common name for a human, is it? He brews potions for us. We go through a lot of healing potions for the creatures and the people. And he helps with the protection charms, you know. He’s rather good at them.”
Ginny balled up the corner of her napkin, dipped it into her water glass, and tossed it at Malfoy. “I’ll harass you, instead.”
Ginny glanced over at him from where she held a broom in one hand. She lifted her wand tip from it and replaced it on its hook. “I learned from the best,” she said, and he was about ready to ask if she meant a specific Hogwarts professor when she added, “I’m surprised you didn’t go into teaching, yourself.”
Malfoy was beautiful, expression exhilarated and determined. The Snitch itself flitted into view and out of it again. They dipped and dived after it. Veered off. Pursued each other, sometimes passing close enough that Harry could see the gleam of Malfoy’s smile. At some point, Harry completely lost track of the Snitch. Forgot that it was supposed to be what he was chasing.
Abruptly: “I am going into the kitchen for a minute. If I leave you there, will you stay? Don’t run off in a fit.”
“These are very popular tourist attractions. Non-magical tourist attractions. They’re very beautiful places. There’s a reason they’re popular.”
Almost four months in total, but it was over. Much of the information Draco had collected proved useless since he’d been found out, but it had given them just enough to go off of. Harry had been the one to make the final, vital connection.
By which Harry gathers that Robards has been getting pressure from outside the department on this investigation. It’s in the sour pucker of Robards’ mouth, the weary and irritated glint in his eyes.
Malfoy stared at him another moment. Then he tapped at the till again, ran the card, and handed it back to Harry. He took a little metal stand with a number 4 attached to the top and handed it to him, as well.
He used his last piece of bread to scrape up the remaining soup in his bowl. Across from him, Malfoy rinsed his own bowl in the sink and loaded it into the dishwasher. This action struck Harry as odd—though it shouldn’t have, considering Harry had watched Malfoy using Muggle machines all afternoon.
Draco gazed back at him a moment with raised eyebrows. “Joke’s on you,” he said, and left the kitchen.
Malfoy’s shoulders move as he takes a book from the edge of his desk. There’s a click of a quill against an inkwell. His head is bowed over something he’s writing. Harry leans in the door frame. Uncertainty settles in.
He walked a bit longer, past a set of train tracks and into a more industrial-looking neighborhood with equipment supply and repair shops, plus the odd restaurant.
This couldn’t have gone better if planned. Catching wind of the Ministry’s corruption, dozens of magical folk appeared above the Ministry with perfectly muggle-looking protest signs. By the time Harry arrived with the other aurors, only one sign bore an animated doodle, which someone quickly spelled into stillness before any muggles noticed.
Somewhere after the third, Harry began to have fun. Malfoy, voice drawling, seemed to enjoy modeling and preening. He looked good in almost all of the hats, even some of the truly awful ones, although a couple made Harry burst out in gales of laughter.
“And that’s the last step to making non-magical beer,” Charlie said. “Once it’s carbonated, it’s ready for the taproom. But we only serve a couple of non-magical varieties. Most of our customers come for our
“Oops,” Williams said with faux innocence, standing over Malfoy’s body, which now lay like a dropped board at his feet. From his place on the floor, Malfoy glared and wailed, his lips locked together by the body bind but still managing to voice his indignation.
Hills wanders to Malfoy’s desk and scans over the documents. Bate, realizing he won’t get a rise out of Harry and is expected to be engaged in his own investigation, pushes off from the doorway and throws brusque charms around the study, rattling books and sending parchments spinning about in a flurry. Malfoy won’t be pleased with that. But Harry isn’t watching Bate. He’s watching Hills go through Malfoy’s manuscript, taking in the grim press of the older man’s lips and the quick sweep of his gaze over each page.
When Harry goes into the Ministry the next day, he hopes to slip into his office before Robards notices him.
It occurred to him then to wonder if she and Ron had known about Malfoy living in Oregon, too. Surely it would have come up in their visits to see Ginny and Luna? They had to have known, if even Arthur had been to Malfoy’s to visit. Was Harry the only one who hadn’t?
“You’re ridiculous.” Malfoy went back to looking at the sky. Then, a few beats later, he said, “Binns.”
, too. The little frown of concentration. The meticulousness of the piles. The unconscious refinement with which he moved.
And so, the next afternoon, Harry found himself heading to a small hat shop in one of the wizarding alleys Malfoy had told him about.
Harry was fascinated by this Malfoy: walking briskly, eyes slightly narrowed as he looked ahead, one hand slung on the bag at his hip.
The torte was very good. So was the tea. Harry ate and drank and watched people come and go. He watched the little wooden bird keep vigil over the shop. He thought that maybe he caught another man throwing it a wink, and he thought maybe the bird winked back.
He made his way back to the house, picked up his bag, and went in through the back door. On his way to the stairs, he stopped in the kitchen. The fridge hummed. The bamboo wind chime clacked outside the window.
“Really, Potter. I would say nothing in here bites, though that would be a lie. Nothing in here bites if you don’t want it to. That’s a
He spreads his arms. He’s covered in glitter, from his boots to his hair. He knows because it falls from his fringe as he looks down at himself.
Late morning found Harry back at the farm in time to help Ginny and Luna make lunch. Or, more accurately, to bring a handful of tomatoes in from the garden and then slouch into one of the chairs in the kitchen.
She tsks, and writes, and flips through pages. “Even with the information intact, this file is practically useless. I’d hate to see the version you got.” With a heavy sigh, she straightens her back and stretches her shoulders. “I guess it’s good that it’s useless. We can use it as evidence to the Wizengamot that there is no foundation for investigation in the first place.”
Malfoy brushed Harry’s sweaty fringe from his forehead. Pressed a kiss to his ear. “Harry. Love. Are you all right?”
The window was open to the cool evening breeze, which pushed warm air out of the kitchen and brought in smells from the garden outside. Some kind of stringed instrument played on the wireless, accompanied by the clack of a bamboo wind chime and the laugh of a crow from outside.
“Something” is about the right word for it. Harry’s not sure what else to call the thing that has him spending half his nights in Draco’s bed, nearly every morning in his kitchen, and all of his evenings in the sitting room with him, or in his study while Draco pores over his books and Harry tries to come up to speed on his research (but mostly succeeds in dozing).
“A quarter turn to the left,” said a particularly picky boater hat with a wide orange ribbon. “And just a tad to the right. No, no. Too far.”
Malfoy let out a great sigh and rolled his eyes heavenward. Then, very slowly, in tones used to explain something to a small child, he spoke more gibberish.
“It would have been easy,” he says. “Erase the last couple of weeks and make me think I was still investigating him. Maybe even that I’d found evidence on him.”
After a minute, though, the smell of coffee got to him, and he stepped up to the till. He might as well grab a coffee before he Apparated back to the farm.
Harry made a disbelieving snort of laughter, then gasped as Malfoy ducked down and licked a stripe next to his cock. Harry felt the rasp of five o’clock shadow against it.
After a while, the meowing got to him. Several of the cats had gathered in the painting next to him and rubbed themselves against the frame.
Harry had the feeling Malfoy would have been happy to show off his collection for the rest of the afternoon—evening? Harry glanced at the clock. Evening. But Ginny said, “Yes, please,” and they moved on down the hall to the back door, which led into the back garden.
Harry helped her reorganize the brooms so that the slower ones meant for beginners were closer to the front of the shed.
Harry stands. “This has been great and all, but I think I need some proper sleep now. In a bed, and not on my sofa.”
been there for the wrong sort of business, he could have put anything down in the registry, and his contact person in the Ministry would vouch for him.) Harry could have tracked down who in the Ministry is involved. He could have maintained access to Ministry records. Could have pulled Hills aside and learned more about the search, maybe talked him into keeping Harry abreast of other angles of investigation on Malfoy. Harry could have talked with Robards himself about his own suspicions about the activity against Malfoy.
A strange look passed over Potter’s face. Then the corner of his mouth ticked back in a not-quite-grin, and he gave a one-shoulder shrug. He looked up toward the sky, and his face lightened. He said, “It’s nice out here.”
It was a very nice arse. And Harry got an even closer view of it when Malfoy swayed precariously. Harry’s hands went up and caught Malfoy by the backs of his thighs. His very hot, firm thighs.
“So thoughtful,” Luna said. She squeezed Ginny’s hand and pressed a kiss to her cheek. Ginny smiled and squeezed back.
Malfoy’s shoulders rise and fall with a sigh. “If I acknowledge how bloody good this is, it’ll inflate your head. But if I don’t, you’ll think me a bad guest.”
But, well, they are tiring. And Harry still doesn’t like the publicity. Draco seems to understand that now. He hasn’t said as much, but the sympathy is there in the brush of his fingers over Harry’s temple.
The woman with the purple-streaked hair didn’t bat an eye. “In the back. He’s bringing some stuff out.”
This time, he reaches out for the wards with a less gentle touch. He knows a moment of fierce satisfaction as the threads of magical intent twist and
Harry should have been home already, but he was working late—again—which was why he was there, at nearly ten, when they brought Draco Malfoy in.
Though neither of them seemed to expect him to know what to do next. It was refreshing, and a relief. Harry relaxed, and took their ribbing and their suggestions, and he even enjoyed the cold soup.
“They look happy enough,” Potter said. “Hagrid would be happy with how you’re keeping them, even if— Well.”
Malfoy crouches next to him, and Harry meets his eyes. He wants to ask—something. But his mouth falls open and nothing comes out.
Malfoy frowned. He didn’t say anything, but then, he wasn’t trying to actively crush Harry’s foot anymore.
Harry looks at it from every angle. He searches for ciphers. Hunts for patterns. Attempts to suss out disillusionment charms.
Parkinson preened and held up her phone to take a picture of herself and a hatless Malfoy. When she was done, she did not give the hat back. Malfoy combed his fingers through his hair. It looked a little flatter than usual.
Malfoy took a deep, slow breath. “All right. So. There are key differences between sourdough and yeast-based bread. One is that, for sourdough, you need a starter—an awful fermented flour baby that you have to feed every day. Which would be this.” Malfoy placed his hand on a sealed jar. “We care for this horrid child with love because it gives us our delicious bread.”
The stag burst from Harry’s wand and ran ahead, lighting a safe path. From behind him, Malfoy squawked his annoyance, but an instant later, Harry heard footsteps thudding in pursuit.
attempting to keep Harry in the dark about the true nature of the case, he doesn’t want to let on he knows about Poesy—he instead scratches Draco Malfoy’s name onto a request slip and places it into his office desk’s outbox. Malfoy’s file
Even that might not have been enough. But— Green eyes. Jaw set mulishly. A heavier, darker hand curled around his own hawthorn wand. Straight broad shoulders in auror robes. A face smirking at him in the canteen queue.
Harry lets an ugly smile stretch his mouth. “How’s your grasp of the English language doing, Malfoy?”
A few minutes later, he’s got the vegetables in the simmering pot of broth and meat browning in a pan, and Hermione is making curious and incredulous grunts over the case file. While the stew cooks, he sits down to lean over the mirror and glance over her growing page of notes.
Malfoy himself sits on the little wooden bench in the entrance hall, back straight and pale hands on his knees. By the time Hills and Bate emerge from the kitchen, he’s transfigured his dressing gown into slate-grey robes and combed his hair into a semblance of neatness. His feet are still in their charcoal socks.
“I did,” she said. “For the most part. I liked my team. I liked flying. I liked playing. But I spent a lot of time away during training, which was a lot of the year. And when we weren’t training, we were traveling for games. The Portkey lag sucked balls. I missed home. I missed Luna.”
“I think Robards is just done with this case,” Harry says. They both look at him, and he adds, “It’s been going on for months. I think someone else in the Ministry is pressuring him.”
It sounds utterly mad to say it now. “I jumped in the way of the curse. It was aimed for my partner. Alex.”
Malfoy lowers their hands to waist level. If he moves his thumb a few centimeters, he’d be able to feel Harry’s pulse jumping in his wrist.
Harry took a long pull of his beer and fell into a surly silence as the conversation flowed over and around him.
A breeze carried scents of warm sweet grass to him. For a minute, he considered taking flight. He took the broom from where it leaned in the corner, but a moment later, he set it back. It would be rude to leave Luna and Ginny without telling them, although probably neither of them would be surprised.
“I take nothing for granted,” Malfoy said primly, and it was so ridiculous, Harry couldn’t be offended. Malfoy had already looked away from Harry and was playing with the car radio. Music came on. Classical. Of course.
and the peppering of stinging hexes and the transfigurations into a pig, a snake, a chair. They reduced him to splinters.
As the water poured over him, he could still feel Malfoy’s grip on his arm—and his magic. The tingle of it mingled with the spray. Even after the shower, dry and in clean clothes and having downed a glass of cold water from the ice box, Harry could still feel Malfoy lingering beneath his skin.
He steepled his thumbs. “I have questions for you, but considering our history, I’m going to give you the chance to talk first. Anything you’d like to tell me?”
People came and went. The little bell above the door jangled. Strains of guitar music filtered through the sounds of conversations and coffee grinding.
“You used your body as a shield for your auror partner.” Malfoy speaks slowly, as if trying to get all the words correct.
“No,” Potter said, shortly. Then he added, “They’d cleaned it up before they realized what had happened to me.”
He pauses at the landing to let his pulse slow, and that’s when he catches sight of a man striding towards the floo.
While Harry gasps for breath, Shacklebolt says, “Mr. Potter, if I understand correctly, you were still recovering in hospital. I understand your condition was fragile for several days. In light of this, I realize you may be confused about events, especially those surrounding your attack. I commend your commitment to attend today’s hearing, but if you can’t hold yourself in check until we’ve completed Mr. Malfoy’s interview, I must ask you to leave.”
gesture. “This. You. When it comes to thinking rather than doing, you’ve always depended on someone else.”
Malfoy sits up gracefully, unfolding himself and putting his feet to the floor. “Is everything all right?”
The Ministry. A briefing with a faceless figure in dark robes. Malfoy searching through a stack of books in a room with no windows. A file in Robard’s curt handwriting.
Sirius’s chest of letters sat inside, where Harry had left it. He hesitated a moment before pulling it out.
Harry stared up at the ceiling, at the ridiculous chandelier with its slowly rotating planets. He did not move. He felt boneless, and raw where Malfoy’s cheek had rasped against him, and his arsehole tingled. He still wasn’t
He spent another minute staring at the parchment, trying to pick up his train of thought. Then he sighed. “Here. This is what I have so far.”
“It’s a load of bollocks. I know it is. I saw his research papers, and I saw the evidence in the Ministry’s public records myself. But Harry—you and I are the only ones who have.”
“So it looks like there’s nothing we can do for the land right now,” Luna was saying. “But the good news is, once we transplant it, it should be fine.”
Parkinson gave him an expression like she recognized his tactic to change the topic, but chose to graciously go with it anyway. “How
“That’s all right. She must have just been sitting on it. But she won’t miss it for long. She’ll lay another, that’s all.”
They put Teddy to bed, using a combination of charms to ease the eight-year-old’s journey from the sofa to his bedroom upstairs. Then they set a silent alarm on the boy (in case he woke) before creeping into Draco’s lab. It was the one room in the house that Teddy knew was completely off-limits, and so it had become their base of secret Christmas operations.
as if Harry is the one in the wrong. The image tugs at the underside of his skin and gut with sharp hooks.
Harry clicked the lid of the box shut and shoved it back onto the shelf. “Well, get a good look, Malfoy. I don’t blush for just anyone.”
Where he’s standing, Harry has raised a hand to his mouth to stifle a laugh. Apparently Hills and Bate expected to show up early in the morning and catch Malfoy off guard. They hadn’t anticipated Malfoy’s joke wards. Harry feels slight sympathy for them. After all, he’d been in their place not long ago.
The house was empty and peaceful. The windows and back door were open, and a cool breeze moved through the kitchen, chased by a warmer one. Ginny was off teaching a summer day camp at the college. Luna had gone to tend animals and plants. Harry could go find her, but he had the urge to fly.
Hermione senses his attention. That, or she has a spell in place. After a few seconds, she closes her book and leans forward.
Harry shrugs. “Nothing, really.” He twines their fingers together, and Malfoy lets him. Their palms feel good, fitted like that. Harry squeezes once, gently. Malfoy stares down at them. Swallows.
Harry’s heart pounds. He is still clasping her arms. The smile on his face slips. “So you’re saying— So you’re saying you knew. That the hearing would be postponed because it’s illegal.”
“Of course I care,” Harry says, voice hotter than he intended. “This whole thing is wrong. The Ministry has been covering this up for months—years, probably.”
As they made their way to the door, Harry didn’t know if it was anticipation that he felt, or—what. Some dismay, probably. It might have been the lingering effects of the Daydream Doppelbock, or just the recent vivid memory it’d left, but he could still feel Malfoy’s fingers and tongue, his hand in Harry’s, his focused gaze. That memory mixed with the uneasy recollection of the way they’d truly parted the night before.
The good feeling didn’t last long, though. In a moment, Malfoy was directing him to cast a new set of Tempus Charms and arrange the trays into one of the ovens in a way that involved moving the ones that were already inside in a particular order. Soon, Harry was hot and sweaty, Levitating trays in small increments and wondering why Malfoy didn’t do this on his own if he was going to tell Harry how to do it. Meanwhile, Malfoy measured liquid ingredients in the air and directed the floating balls of water and oil into the set of bowls.
He’s halfway down the front path before he realizes he left via the front door rather than the floo. He would feel like an idiot if he turned back now, so he continues to a little copse of trees down the road from the cottage. From there, he apparates home.
When the waiter came with their drinks a moment later, Harry accepted his gratefully. He decided he liked the man, after all.
Harry had a flashback of what those fingers—which were wrapped around the cup—had done to him last night. How those eyes had looked, eating him up.
“Sure,” he says, trying to ignore the way the hairs on the nape of his neck stand up as Malfoy leans forward again to look at the mirror, an elegant slender form in the corner of his vision. He shakes with a sudden shiver, and grey eyes break from the surface of the mirror to appraise Harry.
Hills, the canny old man, gives Harry an assessing look from under hooded lids. Bate looks like he’s brewing up an explosion. Just when it seems like he’s about to go off, Hills says, “Putting in overtime. None of my business,” and glances at Malfoy. “We’ll start our search in the pantry, if you have one?”
Draco didn’t complain as Harry drew him close and pulled the covers up over them, so Harry smiled again and turned off the light. He pressed a kiss to the back of Draco’s neck. Distantly, he realized it was a thing he used to do with Ginny. But he didn’t have time to really consider what that meant because it was the last thought he had.
Miraculously, it worked for him. The water bubbled up like a beer that had been shaken before it was opened.
He set off across the field. A warm wind passed over him, bringing smells of dry grass and something kind of sweet, kind of bitter.
Malfoy paused to watch ten-year-old Harry flinch awake to the pounding of Uncle Vernon’s fist on the little door. He jolted upright into a spider web, yelped as the spider scuttled over his cheek. Shrunk back as the door screeched open and Uncle Vernon screamed at him for talking back. Spittle flew.
Malfoy scowled. “No, you didn’t.” He thunked his box down and leaned in to say something to the short-haired man who was slicing open a croissant roll.
“Yes,” Luna said. She wiped her hands on her billowy trousers and picked a wayward lock of hair from her face. “We have other creatures, too. It usually happens that way. You start with one kind and then the others find you.”
Malfoy smiled smugly and took his cone back. He licked the corner of his mouth and then the ice cream. Harry dragged his gaze back to the vista.
He steps back into the house, ventures briefly into the pantry as his pulse quickens and the cold dread in his gut congeals into a heavy mass. The pantry is filled with shelves of preserved food, though some of them are empty, as if they recently held something else.
Malfoy looked at the card as if he didn’t recognize the thing. Then, he accepted it, tapped at the till, and said, “That all?”
He walked around the sweetly-scented, overgrown herb garden that had Luna’s touch in its riot of barely contained growth and strange leaf shapes, and Ginny’s in the features that reminded him of the Burrow’s garden. Then he somehow ended up in the forest that neighbored the farm and walked under its cool humidity looking at ferns and trees and mushrooms, watching the flicker of birds in the canopy above, and considering the bright red berries that looked like raspberries—until his stomach began to tighten with hunger and he found his way back to the house in time for lunch, where Luna asked him how his walk had gone. He told her, and he also told her about the howling the night before. “Oh, you heard the coyotes,” she said. “They must have been welcoming you.”
Harry rises from a deep well of blackness and cracks open his eyes. He recognizes the potion-induced dullness a moment before he recognizes the spells breathing for him. There must also be a body-bind in place because he can’t move, can’t react. Thanks to the potion, he doesn’t panic. He drifts into wakefulness and knows a distant horror as his lungs fill and empty, fill and empty, and he thinks,
“Right,” he says. “You ready? I figured—” And here, Harry’s voice goes a little breathless, “—I figured we’d go together. That way, I can explain anything you need.”
“Oh. Right.” Harry takes the bag. He has the image of Hermione scuttling from the room, weighted down with an armful of books, eyes glazed and unfocused. Inexplicably, that makes him feel a little better about being left. “I’ll just. Leave by floo. If you don’t mind.”
For a moment, Harry blanked. He stared at Malfoy, who was smirking. Then he remembered why he was here. “Well. I actually told Luna I’d be helping you in the coffee shop today. So if she asks, could you tell her…? You know. I don’t want to disappoint her.”
Malfoy came over as Harry was just finishing up the scone. He carried a coffee cup in one hand. With the other, he held out Harry’s card.
Harry lets go of the plate to run both hands through his hair. He doesn’t miss the flicker of Malfoy’s eyes to it and the subtle flick of the hawthorn wand as the plate wobbles on his knees. It stabilizes. The hard grey eyes turn back to Harry.
Harry had nothing to say to that, only held Draco tighter to his side. Draco tensed at first, then relaxed.
They went down the street to an unassuming little ice cream shop with the strangest flavors Harry had heard of. Strawberry balsamic and peppercorn. Chocolate stout brownie. Maple and bacon buttermilk pancake. Lavender tangerine and rose water. Olive oil.
Glancing in through the window, Harry didn’t see Luna or Ginny, though he wasn’t surprised by that. He left his bag off the side of the path and walked around to the back of the house.
And not only fantasies, but the day-to-day thoughts. Of Malfoy, rushing about the Ministry, always busy and aloof and perfectly kempt. Of what Malfoy would have to say about Harry’s auror colleague, a social climber with the tact of a niffler. Of what he would make of the gala Harry was forced to attend; surely he’d have something to say about the hostess mixing champagne and gin in the larder.
Harry sits at the kitchen table while the kettle heats and the tea leaves levitate into the pot. Ginger biscuits plate themselves on the table in front of him. Harry lets the familiarity and comfort sink in. He has another flashback to Malfoy’s home, and he shakes his head.
His gaze met Malfoy’s only a split moment before the water splashed down on both of them. Malfoy’s arm hooked around Harry’s waist to brace him, hand still clutching the hawthorn wand. The water pummeled down and down. Then it was over and a wind whipped past them. Voices whooped. Harry looked up into Malfoy’s face, which he couldn’t quite make out through his droplet-spangled glasses.
Harry’s hand was already around the broom. He jumped onto it, kicked off from the balcony, and sped after the Patronus.
Mostly, he’d begun so she would stop bothering him about it. Then, he’d kept on out of sheer stubbornness. It took months to unlearn what he thought he knew about mind magic. More, to build up his occlumency. By the time he began to learn legilimency in earnest, his mind was a fortress. He liked it. He
He closed that chest and moved to the next. He dug through antique jewelry, notebooks filled with unintelligible scribbles, dried lizard feet, moth-eaten capes, yellowed lace bedding, half-melted silver cutlery, and a cameo locket with a tiny painting inside that screamed when he opened it. Startled, he dropped it—then snapped it shut.
“Harry likes cottage pie,” Luna put in. “That’s all right, Harry. It’s natural to get something you’re familiar with, especially when you’re in unfamiliar surroundings. And they do make a lovely cottage pie here.”
, read the words in his mentor’s curling hand. The rest of the letter turned into a blur. He skimmed the three paragraphs before returning to the top and forcing himself to focus on the words, identifying the information he needed.
Malfoy turns to him helplessly. “Standing in your kitchen—sitting in your kitchen—and eating hors d’oeuvres? Like—like civilized people?”
“I was just spending some time talking to the tree. But I think I’ll go check on the Thunderbird. I saw some unexpected lightning earlier. She might want to give us some rain.”
“It’s a possibility,” he said. “It did belong to Sirius, but he hated it. And it was the Order’s headquarters, but that’s been disbanded since the war. No reason not to look for somewhere else in London, or maybe out in the countryside. Somewhere I could go for a fly.”
Malfoy is looking away, so Harry can’t see his expression. But he can make out the bob of his Adam’s apple, the click of him swallowing.
The library was, predictably, full of books. Not like Luna’s narrow maze of a library, but more like Hermione’s: neat shining wooden bookcases from floor to ceiling, books each nestled with their spines lining up.
To Harry’s embarrassment, Malfoy continues to hold him, strong fingers gripping his shoulders. He’s giving Harry a long, piercing look. Harry flushes hard. The alcohol. It’s the alcohol.
Malfoy didn’t say anything aloud, only raised a skeptical eyebrow and waved his wand while still chewing on a mouthful of bread. The clothes immediately sagged on Harry.
Harry visited Malfoy again Sunday evening after learning Hermione still hadn’t visited Malfoy to plan for the hearing. He was incensed, though he shouldn’t have been. He
Bate is staring at Harry with wide, enraged eyes and flared nostrils. Harry never liked the man to begin with. He has a feeling the sentiment is mutual. The dark eyes flick over Harry, quickly categorizing the soft trackies and worn t-shirt, the bare feet.
Most of the customers were nice, though a few were apparently having less than ideal days, or frowned impatiently when Harry squinted at the money they handed him and had to peer at every note to count the unfamiliar change. Harry discovered that he could win most of these over with a smile and a few words in his British accent. Bafflingly, this tactic had an opposite effect on Malfoy, who scowled when Harry teased a laugh out of a dour-looking young woman.
The thing that most struck Harry about these little pieces—besides the fact that they were magical—was that they were as bland as the rest of the decor in the shop, clearly chosen for pleasantness and not to reflect Malfoy’s personality. Though, what had Harry expected from Malfoy? Marble busts? Stuffy old portraits that whispered insults about the patrons? Peacocks? Snakes and Slytherin colors?
Malfoy pushed forward. He rummaged for Harry’s dirtiest secrets, uncovered them with alarming ease. Harry pounding down an alley against orders, wand tight in his hand. Standing over a cowering wizard at the end of the alley, air reeking of burnt hair. Ron pushing him back against the wall, breathing hard. “Mate, what are you doing?” Robards in the office, slamming a file against the desk. “Screw your head on straight, Potter.”
Harry was saved by the waitress returning with a tray of drinks. The tasting flight turned out to be a long wooden block with eight glasses set inside. He had never been so happy to see so much beer, and he told the waitress so. She grinned at him and winked, and Harry felt his face grow hotter.
This one was noticeably cruder than the one for Teddy. Harry had made it earlier in the month, before they’d refined their book-making craft, and he’d made it by himself. It had been a lot more challenging to make one of these on his own, but he thought—at the time—that it was worth the effort. Now he held his breath as Draco stared down at it—simultaneously despairing and proud.
But these letters were not meant for Harry. They weren’t meant to be lost to time, either. After long thought, Harry had decided that they belonged to Teddy for when he came of age. Let Teddy decide what he wanted to do with them. Harry only wished he had something of his parents.
Three days later—after a flurry of re-carpeting and painting and varnishing—Grimmauld Place was done. Molly threw a small feast for all of them using the newly refurbished kitchen. Several bottles of Firewhiskey were passed around. Laughter and sunlight filled the dining room.
Hermione and Ginny said goodbye, leaving Ron to tell Harry a few things that had happened at the Auror office recently. Then he signed off. Harry wasn’t quite sure what to do with the computer, so he left it there. He made toast with tea, which cleared his head marginally, and went outside.
Harry kept looking at Malfoy. He felt a sensation in his chest he couldn’t remember feeling before, not quite like this. A sinking, and a ripping, and an aching. He had the overwhelming impulse to cross the courtroom and touch the side of his face. To know that he was solid and to have those grey eyes look at him. Malfoy without his self-righteousness or droll sarcasm was small, mean, and distressed-looking. He clutched his knees and blinked as if, without questions being directed his way, he kept forgetting where he was, what he was doing—vaguely reminiscent of Lockhart the last time Harry had seen him, or Hermione’s parents before their memories had been restored.
He and Malfoy walked down a long switch-back trail through trees and past scrubby dune plants, down, down to the level of the rocks. They picked their way across a landscape that looked like it had been crafted by an eccentric magical artist rather than nature. Harry could feel the craggy points of the rock through the soles of his trainers. Water had gathered in the shallow depressions in the rock. Barnacles and mussels and little green sea anemones nestled under the crystalline surface.
He feels the weight of a gaze and looks up to find Malfoy regarding him with half-hooded eyes. Something simmers beneath his relaxed pose.
Malfoy snorts and looks aside, giving Harry a perfect view of high cheekbone, narrow chin, and straight nose in profile. “Well, I had Hermione’s assurance the hearing would be canceled, didn’t I? But I couldn’t be sure until the official news of it. Which happened this morning, as it was.”
And he really doesn’t want to look at what that feeling might mean. Especially when placing it next to the evening they had, the intimate fireside chat, the hands touching over snap cards.
“It’s a bookshop?” Harry said, as they crossed the street and approached a door next to a long glass window filled with stacks and stacks of books.
The sitting room is empty, and Harry feels like he’s spying as he peers around for signs of life. The lamps are off. The fire casts green light over the empty chairs and table—cleared of all books and food, as if they weren’t all just sitting around it that afternoon.
For an established potions master, the resources required to develop new formulas were worth it. A successful new formula could sustain a potion master’s practice for several years, financing the development of yet more potions. But Draco, being a journeyman, didn’t have the license—or, frankly, the time—to develop his own line of potions. The common draughts he sold via owl order helped offset some of the costs of his studies, but not all.
“You’ve been busy,” Edward said, taking in the sight of the stacked boxes. That was the one thing that had changed since the old man’s last visit—the height of Draco’s stock.
“Semantics.” Malfoy unbuttoned one of his cuffs and began to roll the sleeve up. “Have you ever baked bread, Potter?”
There was a smile on his face, too, when Harry looked up. A rare soft smile. It was ridiculously sappy. Ginny would never let him live it down if she saw what his daydream—his daydream of
Harry rolls his eyes and steps calmly through the storm of cooking implements to collect a couple platters of hors d'oeuvres. He smiles to note that one platter is heaped with sausage rolls, Ron’s favorite. Delicate canapes with puff pastry and slivers of salmon and fresh dill and white cheese line the other.
Malfoy’s thumb swiped over the head of his cock, and Harry felt a smear of moisture spread over the skin. Malfoy pulled his hand away, and a moment later, Harry heard the wet sound of lips and tongue. Presumably Malfoy tasting his thumb. “Mmm.”
“Hey,” he said. “Could I order another coffee? For Malfoy. Also, I didn’t pay for mine.” He held up his credit card.
He passed four in the first couple of minutes. Six, if he counted the hip little cafes that advertised espresso along with their fruit smoothies and bubble tea. Which was what he got for asking Ginny where he could find some coffee. Not that he should complain. He’d probably be needing a lot of it on this trip. Only, this meant he had to choose, which meant he had to be alert, which meant he needed caffeine.
Malfoy pulled away and ducked in again to lick along the other side. His breath was warm and moist over Harry’s skin.
They turned onto a wider road and picked up speed. Golden fields and sprays of white flowers flew by. Almost like flying with Malfoy again, except they moved the same speed, and it was bright out, and Malfoy was the one steering, and Harry was okay with that.
Then, Ron wanted to see the new coffee machine in action. Harry made three pots in total while Ron poked around the device and wondered how the water heated without magic and nearly scalded himself. Harry served their cups of coffee with a slice of treacle tart each.
On the other side of the fence, the goat chewed grass and stared back at her with his strangely shaped pupils. Harry leaned heavily on the fence post to watch him.
Ginny gave him a grin and a jaunty wave, then she and Luna were gone, leaving him alone with Malfoy. Harry wasn’t sure why they had left him, considering he was going back to the same place as them. Wasn’t he?
“Thanks,” he says, when she returns with the little bucket. He slices one down the middle and lays the flat side against the cutting board. “The aurors visited this morning.”
The barista grinned, and Harry got the impression this was a running joke. “Not if you’re not around.”
Malfoy lifted the Shield Charm from the cone but left the Stasis in place. “It won’t melt on you, that way,” he explained.
Of course, Draco found the room empty the next morning. He wasn’t surprised, though he was annoyed. He didn’t find Potter in the kitchen, either.
it isn’t Hermione’s responsibility to help Malfoy, but Tuesday is fast approaching and there is nothing he can do to help Malfoy himself.
When Harry arrives, Robards is behind his desk with a newspaper open in his hands. He slaps it down on. “The hearing’s been canceled.”
“Don’t be crass, Harry.” Malfoy gave him a smile. Wan but genuine. “Besides, I understand you like a good prick.”
“All right. Let us know if you change your mind.” Hermione gave him one of her unreadable looks. He sensed something being unsaid. But maybe he was imagining it. He still felt off-kilter.
“The muggle water supply,” Hermione finishes. She is sitting forward in rapt attention by now, her eyes glassy in that far-away look she gets when thinking.
“What the actual…” He was awake but confused. Was Ginny playing some kind of prank on him? Then, he vaguely remembered Malfoy mentioning something during their conversation at the brewery about early hours.
Apparently, “taking a break” involved more baking: into each cup of a muffin tin, Malfoy placed croissant dough, a slice of bacon, and a raw egg. While that was in the oven, Harry helped him clean up the mess in the kitchen and load the cases in the shop with the cooled bread, biscuits, and croissants.
She sits for a thoughtful minute. “In this, you might actually have more experience than me. Your friend, Mrs. Granger-Weasley, certainly does.”
“Did you really bake all of this on your own?” He steps beside Malfoy and quiets his voice. Malfoy meets his gaze with guarded eyes. He gives a short nod.
Despite his racing heart and lingering panic, Harry smiles. If he didn’t know any better, he’d think Malfoy cared or something.
They finished lunch, then Luna offered to take him up to his room. As surprisingly normal as it looked on the outside, the air inside the house was charged with magic.
Harry didn’t know what else to say, so he pocketed his card and took the number to a corner table with a view of the entire shop, the street outside, and Malfoy working behind the counter.
Malfoy snapped his fingers. “I’m off my shift at two. We can become bosom buddies then. But you’ll have to order something else if you’re going to stay.”
“Kind of nice, seeing how he runs the place. Kind of like it’s nice seeing how you run the farm. I’ve only known the Aurors for years.”
“No. Merlin. Dammit.” Harry smothers his face with his hands. “I’m just— I was given an incomplete file on you, Malfoy. And don’t ask me why I’m even telling you this, except that I feel like I got landed in a tank of shit without a wand, and I hate being used, even if it
When he opened the front door, the entryway was quiet and empty. He shrugged off his coat. He padded slowly into the kitchen, practically itching with nerves.
“Good morning!” she hailed in a sing-song. She strode up with a wide-brimmed hat on her head and an Emitter dangling in one hand. “I’m so excited you’re interested in the ground fairy removal, Harry.”
Malfoy waved his spoon. “Yes. And I lived at the Manor. Now I live in a craftsman house in Portland.”
Malfoy snorts. “No bother. You’ve been a very busy man, Auror Potter. Colliding with one’s conscience takes it out of a person.” But the snort, and the words, are without their usual edge. In the shifting shadows of the room, Malfoy’s face is softer.
“There was nothing to find except kitchen knives and the record player. Plus, I was there. I don’t think they knew what to make of that.”
The redacted information. Harry’s request to enforce Section III. Malfoy’s insane house wards. (Harry swears Hermione smiles into her teacup at this part of the story.) He tells her about Malfoy’s defensiveness at receiving the FORCE form and the scores of document requests from the Ministry. The following uncomfortable conversation with Robards and the way Robards rushed a hearing with Malfoy, trying to close this case quickly. Malfoy’s piles of books. His manuscript. The byproducts that—supposedly—produce squibs. Malfoy’s squeaky clean record. Seeing the CEO of Poesy Potions in the Ministry atrium.
Malfoy cast a condescending look at Harry’s empty dish and tea cup, which had been sitting on the table for hours.
“Good.” He sat up at the side of the bed. “Do you want to lie down? But for god’s sake, pull down the duvet because they never clean those things.”
life apart a few minutes later, like his hands hadn’t just been trembling. Like he’s allowed. Like he’s entitled to it.
Harry shakes that thought off, too. He focuses on the letters. Standing over the shoulder of his memory self, he pauses the scene to examine the first missive—properly, this time. He is dismayed to note that the letter is in the same ivory parchment the Ministry uses for all of its official documents. The broken seal is in the Ministry’s purple wax. Harry knows he was being a prat. The letter
When Harry was two customers from the till, Malfoy turned away to work on a complicated drink order. In the mirror on the wall behind the counter, Harry could see Malfoy’s face—eyebrows drawn, ends of his mouth turned down in a frown. Concentrating.
what you were searching for?” he asks, raising a negligent hand. “I say, it’s a bit gauche to be calling Auror Potter a
Malfoy huffed. “Well, come in, then. An apology from Harry Potter. I should be comfortably sitting for this. If I faint, don’t bother with a
Without another word, Malfoy turns on his heel and marches from the room. Bemused, Harry trails after him and into the kitchen which, unlike the sitting room, is well-lit and in use. Trays of baking line the counters. There must be a charm in place to keep the smells from permeating the rest of the cottage because Harry is hit full force with them as soon as he walks through the threshold. Pastry dough and sugar and savory meats and the tang of cherries.
Except this time, Harry’s feet were bare and sinking into the wet sand. The wind tousled his hair. Malfoy was close enough that Harry could feel the warmth of him at his side. Their knuckles brushed, once, unintentionally. Harry made them brush again, this time deliberately. When Malfoy did not pull away, Harry slipped their hands together. Malfoy’s was warm and dry. His longer fingers parted to thread with Harry’s.
Harry paused a moment because this was the kind of thing teenaged Malfoy would have done to set up a prank. Then he removed his glasses and put his eye to the scope. He didn’t see anything at first, and that wasn’t just because everything was blurry. His attention was on Malfoy, on the fact that Malfoy’s hand was still on the telescope, steadying it. On the fact that Malfoy stood so close while Harry was unguarded.
“Harry, two months ago I would have told you it’s impossible. But clearly I haven’t been practicing long enough and still have more to learn. So: I don’t know. It’s not something I’m supposed to admit, but I’d be doing you a disservice if I told you not to try. Your recovery has been nothing short of miraculous. But please understand that you must take care. More powerful spells, more complicated magic, anything that pulls deeply on your core, may trigger your symptoms.
Steepling his fingers, Shacklebolt says, “Be that as it may, even if he were to give us his testimony under veritaserum, we are left with a conundrum. Two separate truths.”
from the Ministry. It isn’t forged. He hadn’t really believed it at the time, and he can’t deny it now.
Ginny looked between Malfoy and Parkinson and Harry. Luna smiled faintly at Harry. Parkinson glanced at Harry, as well. Malfoy busied himself taking a pull from his beer.
When Harry was done, he Scourgified his fingers and waited for Malfoy to finish his own cone. A lone cloud moved across the sky, which was so
This time, he tried to pay attention when she went through the wand movements and the incantation. It was difficult. His mind kept drifting.
“All done there? Good. The campers will be here in an hour. We’ll reinforce the Disillusionment Charms over the field. We’re in the middle of nowhere, but sometimes planes fly over.”
The motorway unrolled before them. Harry felt the same feeling he got when he was on the farm, holding a broom and hearing the countryside whisper its invitation to keep going and going.
Harry pulls in a deep, shuddering breath. His lungs feel tight—an impression that comes with a squeezing sense of claustrophobia—but at least they are his to control again.
Harry scowled. “Of course I’ve made bread.” He didn’t add that it had been literally twenty years since he had last made any. Petunia had taught him so she could use him to help her make loaves for visits from the stuffy businessmen and their wives who Vernon was trying to impress.
He turned his head on the pillow, and his nose pressed into it, giving him the concentrated scent of Malfoy: citrus and something woodsy and something indescribable that made Harry bury his nose deeper and take a deep breath.
“Oh.” Malfoy blinks. The expression of cool mocking slips. He turns toward the floo. “Okay. I’ll be going now.”
It reminded Harry of Diagon Alley only in the most oblique sense. It had some of the same off-beat energy, and was filled with the smells of herbs and woodsmoke and unidentifiable scents that reminded Harry of the Potions classroom. Owls, crows, and small hawks swooped into the courtyard, and they perched in the ceiling beams and along the handrails of the levels above. The people walking around could still have passed for Muggles on the street, albeit rather quirky ones. One woman passed wearing a green lace top in a leaf pattern that flowed like a robe; a tiny, colorful falcon sat on her shoulder.
and was waiting for him under its glow. His gaze went to Harry’s hand. Harry tossed the Snitch, caught it again. Then he lobbed it at Malfoy.
Malfoy smirked. He leaned across the short space between them on the floor, and Harry fell quiet as Malfoy slipped a hand into his pocket, drew out Harry’s wand, placed it in Harry’s hand.
The shock of seeing him as an adult continued to work through Harry. The overall subdued civility was the biggest surprise. Harry kept running their interaction through his mind, especially his unfailing politeness in front of his staff and customers. And here, now: Malfoy
Harry is on his best behavior this morning. The last five months on desk duty have been excruciating. This will be his first case since the one that landed him in St. Mungo’s, and he’ll do anything to see the outside of these walls during work hours. Even—he grimaces internally—take on the tepid leftovers of a case on Draco sodding Malfoy.
and a few other publications appear on his desk. Another half-hour search yields several articles about Malfoy, but not one mentions his justice work.
Ginny clucked her tongue, hooked an arm around Luna—kissed her—grabbed Harry, and Apparated them. They appeared in the pub’s entrance garden. Earlier, Harry had looked at it through the windows of the brew space. From where he stood on the gravel path now, he could just see the window he’d looked out of. It was half-hidden by a tall rosemary bush, and a reflection of the sky obscured a view of the inside.
“For the most part. I also got tired of competing all of the time. It’s kind of nice to lord it over a group of students. The magical community college had a position open, so I thought I’d try it. I liked it.”
He was fucking Malfoy harder now. He was inside him, and Malfoy was opening so sweetly to him. At that thought, Harry pushed deeper. They both gasped. Harry pressed his face against Malfoy’s jaw, his neck. Growled as Malfoy raked his nails over his shoulders.
He thrust into Harry hard. The wet sound of his hips slamming against Harry’s arse filled the room and he twisted his grip over Harry’s cock, squeezed his nipple, and pressed his hot tongue over the base of Harry’s spine. The combination of sensations together sent Harry over the edge—the tingling warm wave crashed over him, breaking him apart, leaving him in pieces.
, though he didn’t want to start there, so he scrounged up a mostly-empty legal pad Hermione had left on a previous visit and took it to every hall and room in the house, making an inventory of the damage, curses, infestations, and sentient mold.
Malfoy’s mouth opened and closed for a moment without sound before he gasped, “Harry Potter, you can’t be
“And pass up free food?” Harry teases, his voice shockingly quiet, shockingly fond. He injects more good-natured scorn into it. “You’ve lost the plot, Malfoy.”
letters. Not like he thought there was anything wrong with that. But they were in Lupin’s handwriting, and they talked about
“Though not much has changed in several millennia,” Charlie had said while taking him through the process, from milling the grains to mixing them in hot water to straining the liquid and adding an array of herbs, fruits, and goops. She went on a lot like Malfoy had about the origin of the grains and relations with the farmers, but Harry wasn’t too interested. His gaze drifted to the ropes hanging from the ceiling beams, the pile of mushy grains sitting in a tub, the big glass jars of herbs—and he wondered, then, where Malfoy brewed potions for Luna and Ginny. Luna had told him about Malfoy’s brewing, but Harry hadn’t seen any evidence of it. Did he have a potions lab? Ginny had said something about Wizard Space in his wardrobe. Harry had assumed it was for clothes—but was it?
It was loads of fun, but it left Harry with a hell of a headache to nurse alone the following morning. He was relieved when Hermione and Ron came over in the evening for a quieter get-together.
“I want to check on one thing,” Malfoy said, and searched the signs at the ends of the cases until he found one in particular. He led Harry halfway down the aisle and boarded one of the floating platforms. He didn’t say anything, but he glanced over as if waiting for Harry, so Harry stepped up next to him. The platform was just big enough for them to stand side by side, and it didn’t have a railing.
Slowly, he worked his way through that pile, then the next. Some of the chests were locked with wards so old and fragile that they crumbled at a touch from Harry’s wand. A few of them were secured with curses that had tangled over the years. He set them aside and planned to talk to Bill about getting a Curse-Breaker to look at them.
“It’s so nice to have someone to work with,” Bill said with a smile when he returned, brushing crumbs from his shirt and resuming his spot on the floor next to Harry.
He was infuriatingly slow as he worked his way down Harry’s body—chest, barely skirting the nipple, belly—to lick the crease of Harry’s thigh. In response, Harry’s legs fell open on their own accord. Malfoy chuckled, and his tongue traveled down. Harry hissed. Was Malfoy—? Again—? But Malfoy reversed directions just shy of Harry’s hole and he trailed his tongue up. Harry shut his eyes as Malfoy’s lips brushed the side of his balls and up Harry’s cock, and then he took Harry down in one smooth movement. Harry gasped, shocked at the sudden sensation of slick heat.
Harry felt like this should mean something. What should this mean? He stared into his bottle for a few moments, but no answer was forthcoming, so he shrugged and took another drink of cider.
Pain so keen, so deep, that he retched with it, but his stomach was already empty. The air was sour with the stench of vomit and urine. His trousers were soaked, had turned cold and itching. Through the haze, he made out a mewling sound—his own.
Which—it occurred to him he would need to hide the spells on the cages, but then, what could Potter do? Arrest him for undetectable extension charms? With his see-through hands and absent magic?
There’s got to be something else. There’s got to be something else he can do to fight back against the Ministry.
Since he’d returned home, he’d been subjected to questions from the whole family about his trip. It seemed that almost everyone else had already been to Oregon, and they’d asked after Ginny and Luna and the farm. But this was the first time he was sitting down with Hermione and Ron alone to talk about his visit.
He dropped the letter into a drawer and began setting up his tea and toast once again. Because he was a creature of habit, after all, and nothing settled the nerves like a ritual involving food and caffeine.
He left Harry alone to eat the sandwich, which was full of shaved roast beef, thinly sliced potatoes, horseradish, and tiny greens with a peppery flavor—admittedly a nice change from the ham. The coffee was delicious and chocolatey, though when he was done, he still wanted one of the brulee things.
As he changed into something more presentable in his room, it hit him how easy that had been to decline Luna’s job shadowing opportunity. Maybe that was all he’d needed to do from the beginning: tell her the truth. Huh.
After his impulsive and awkward visit to Malfoy’s on Saturday, Harry fretted the rest of the weekend. First, because Hermione hadn’t met with Malfoy on Saturday, and then because the
so he could steer him back through the house and out the front door. But he’d never had to cast on a muggle before. Surely it wouldn’t break the Statue if Draco used magic to
In the memory, the two of them drink and play exploding snap, and Harry winces. It’s so obvious now. His own movement had been thick-fingered and fumbling, and he was hardly looking at the cards. He was looking at Malfoy’s hands.
Bate looks around incredulously, as if he can’t believe his partner is just going to ignore the fact that Harry is standing against the banister in his bare feet. Then, realizing his partner is already disappearing down the hall with Malfoy, he follows after them with one last glare at Harry.
Draco retreated to his doorway and waved till the old man had backed down the long driveway and rattled out of sight, then he slumped against the door frame.
Harry watched the coffee pot fill, then he poured himself a cup and stepped into the back garden, the only place—besides his bedroom, which hadn’t changed much—that felt at all like home. The vines and bushes had been cut back severely during the Weasley clan’s occupation, though Arthur hadn’t come back yet to prune the trees, so the whole thing had a feeling of being simultaneously cultivated and feral.
The piece de resistance is when he tucks a long, fancy quill behind his ear. That is the moment before Malfoy glances up and Harry realizes he’s been staring and his face goes up in inexplicable flames.
Above, strings of lights criss-crossed between the building walls, along with bits of brightly colored cloth. Birds dashed around and bickered in the windowsills above—owls and crows and birds with blue plumage that shrieked.
“Funny Malfoy.” His expression flickered, and the look of suspicion deepened. “You aren’t selling potions there, are you?”
She takes a long, unsteady breath. “I think he’s been obliviated. Someone’s erased his records and his memory. As far as anyone is concerned, Draco’s investigation into Poesy Potions never happened. There are only two sources of evidence remaining.”
Malfoy was indeed waiting for Harry in the front. It was strange to see this side of the house; Harry hadn’t really been up here since he first arrived because he’d Apparated everywhere he’d gone. With his bag on his shoulder, he had a flashback to arriving. That brought an odd pang of emotion, and it mixed with the pang of seeing Malfoy leaning against the front of a silver car with his baseball cap on. His gaze caught Harry’s and held.
“So I left. My records were only public domain so long as they were produced while I was employed at the university. I don’t need the faculty appointment in order to conduct research, and as a private citizen, I am no longer compelled to share what’s mine with the Ministry and the public at large.”
and found two of the newer, faster brooms from the back of the shed, where Ginny kept them under extra protection. She would probably flay them both alive if they damaged the brooms. Harry gently prised them from their wards.
“You’re excused. This one is a fruit beer.” He sipped. “A sour fruit beer. Not bitter. Made with cherries.” He peered at the little label written on the block. “‘Release the Krieken.’ See?” He proffered it to Harry.
Draco Malfoy, in front of him. Draco Malfoy, in the Ministry’s holding cells, caught in a bust on the potion ring they’d been hunting for months.
For one thing, he was tired. He and Malfoy had arrived back in Portland late the night before. Harry had insisted that Malfoy drive to his own home rather than dropping him at the farm.
, that someone has been so able and inclined. There is something in the moment that echoes a memory: one grip in another, pulling, the gleam of frightened eyes in firelight.
Malfoy let out a little helpless noise. Harry smiled into his mouth and cupped his face, stroked Malfoy’s mouth with his tongue. Malfoy relaxed his jaw, drew Harry closer—which was the moment Harry straightened his tongue and began to thrust as Malfoy had done to him.
Harry pelts out of the room. Malfoy exits the neighboring room at the same moment, wild-eyed and sleep-tousled in a dressing gown he hasn’t yet tied. Harry catches a glimpse of pale chest and black pants beneath.
No one told Harry that bakers start their work at four in the morning, so when he startled awake in the middle of the night, he was confused.
him. This was a Ministry event. Malfoy was stepping outside. And so what if Harry needed some air at the same time, and Malfoy was in his line of sight, the silhouette of his shoulders against the fairy lights in the garden?
Molly and Arthur were happy to have him over for lunch one day soon after, and he enjoyed the food and company, but when they asked what he planned to do next and he said, “Not sure yet,” Molly gave him such a look of pity that it haunted him into his sleep.
Of course, he had nothing left to finish at Grimmauld. He took one step down the entrance hall and already regretted not taking Andromeda up on the offer of tea. The feeling of being squeezed came over him again, but it was different this time: not the strangling clutch of grief but a deep, constant, crushing pressure—the weight of the floors above and the dense silence, of decades past, old memories, old curses. Of loneliness and screams and haggard expressions. Layer upon layer of them, invisible, a void.
Harry sighed. Realized he was fidgeting and stilled his hands. “You’re right. And I’ve received a proper bollocking about it already, not like you’d care.”
Slowly, she returns to the chair and sits. The hardness has gone from her expression, replaced with a pensiveness.
Harry could just make out Malfoy’s form in the gloom and grinned as Malfoy brushed back his ruffled hair and straightened his shirt.
Harry chilled a glass with a charm and poured some of the doppelbock. It had a nice head, and a deep brown color. He took a cautious sip. It had a unique malty flavor due to the special variety of malt used, but more than that, it was dominated by the sweet tartness of real cherries. What would Malfoy think of that?
He looked soft and sleep-tousled in the morning light. He and Harry had moved around in the night so that he was on his back and Harry was sort of curled around him, one arm across his chest. His very bare, very warm and gently moving chest.
“Potter,” Malfoy said, and Harry turned to find himself nose-to-nose with him in the narrow space. Malfoy wasn’t quite smiling, but the corners of his eyes crinkled almost as if he were. “Pay attention.”
As they passed shops and restaurants and parks, Harry had to agree that Malfoy was right: public transportation was a good way to experience the city. He’d got so used to Apparating to get from one place to another, he tended to think of “travel” as a purely practical action.
As Harry took it, their fingers brushed. Harry’s gaze flickered over Malfoy’s face, but Malfoy’s expression didn’t change. He looked tired and pinched and amused.
“This time, stay,” Hermione says, her lips pressed together. Then her expression softens, and she squeezes Harry’s arm. “He’ll thank you.”
After the first three balls of dough, Harry’s arms were beginning to ache, but Malfoy kept going strong. Harry’s gaze strayed to Malfoy’s hands—pulling, stretching, folding.
He’s got the memory in the pensieve, he realizes. He could watch it. Not to read the letters this time, but to study the expression on Malfoy’s face, like maybe he can parse it out.
Malfoy glanced in the wall length mirror behind the counter and then back at Harry. “Hmmm. Nope. Still there.”
The sun was low on the horizon, dipping toward the water, as they made their way down to the beach. They walked past cliffs topped with hotels, and long driftwood logs, and people sitting around bonfires, and the reflection of the sun on the shining expanse of shore that went on and on.
felt better after sleeping, though he woke way too early because of the time difference. After eating something from the little icebox, he’d discovered the window on the far side of the room was actually a sliding glass door that led onto a balcony.
“A non-magical hatter would have to reshape a felt hat with steam, but we’ve got charms,” Sophie told Harry.
. We’ll be happy to pick you up. You are still coming back on Saturday, right? Let us know if you plan to reschedule. You have up to 48 hours to call without a penalty charge. Ron’s been keeping an eye on Grimmauld, so you don’t have to worry about it. Molly’s even offered to start cleaning before you get back. Just basic things.”
Harry—faced with ceding the fruit beer to Malfoy or putting down the red ale—accepted it with his free hand so he had one in each hand. Ginny snorted, and Luna laughed.
Ingredients and implements flew from their places almost as fast Malfoy asked for them, and Harry was there to catch them or direct them to set down next to Malfoy or—in a few cases—to orbit him like tiny moons until Malfoy looked up with a huff and plucked them out of the air.
Harry considers and immediately dismisses lying, a bit like the time he went fishing with Arthur and he finally caught a fish, just a little one, and he reeled it in and regarded it flopping in his hand for a moment—only briefly, remotely considering the possibility of keeping it before he tossed it back. Because really, there was never the chance that he would have kept the small fish; he only entertained the idea as a thought experiment, and only for a moment.
It’s Malfoy in his floo, looking simultaneously annoyed and sheepish in the way only Malfoy can, and he’s not insulting him or accusing him of making up stories.
It’s apparent no one’s been into the sitting room, probably since Harry was there that afternoon. The curtains are still open. The only light in the room comes from the hearth, which—now that Harry’s come through—is no more than smoldering coals.
Draco, who had been watching, dropped his head back against the pillow. “We’re going to talk about that later.”
Raising his eyebrows, Harry says, “No jokes about my inadequacy to protect anyone right now? No references to my recent hospital visit? Have I rendered you speechless?”
And why should that be the thing that most stuck out in his mind about the letters? It wasn’t like— He was perfectly okay with Ginny and Luna. He was happy for them. Thrilled. Same with Dean and Seamus. He’d never felt uncomfortable around those two, didn’t even mind when they threw ribald jokes his way. And clearly, whatever had existed between Sirius and Remus had happened a long time ago, and had happened before Tonks, so it wasn’t like it should be
It was mostly dark inside the structure. There were a few cars parked on the ground floor, though it had an abandoned feel. A chill ran up Harry’s spine.
“Ah, would you take a look at these? Crocuses. My mother sent along the bulbs. I still haven’t decided where to install them yet.”
“Where was that while I was sleeping?” he groused. The fire crackled merrily in response, and he could only sigh.
So Harry kept his memories and his knowledge, though he wasn’t allowed to share this information with the rest of his team. Which frustrated him, because it was important for the investigation; he’d be continuing with his legs hobbled. He hated the lies.
He closed the balcony door, hesitated, and went downstairs. Ginny and Luna were in the living room watching a movie on the television.
Luna reached over to pat his hand. “You’re looking a bit flushed, Harry. Let me get you some electuary. That’ll make you feel better.”
Draco waved a dismissive hand. His expression was impassive, vaguely haughty. But Harry noted how carefully dressed he was, the tension he carried in his shoulders.
Harry flattened his hand against the table. He wanted to have a retort, but the truth was, he felt quite restless, more restless than usual. He realized he was jiggling his leg again and stilled that, too.
Harry had already forgotten which flavor Malfoy had got, and was pleasantly surprised by the taste of crisp, tart apple and creamy cheese. “Oh, wow.”
“She has a point, though. You’ve only known fighting in school and since then. Hurrah, so you’ve quit the Aurors.” Malfoy paused in his scholarly pursuits to softly clap his hands. “Do you even know what you want to do with yourself?”
touches of his tongue felt the most intense against the stretched skin. The sensations traveled through Harry—to his groin, to his toes.
Malfoy led him down mostly-empty paths, past car park entrances, the occasional cafe, and office lobbies to a multistory car park. It stood next to a crumbling building marked with “Condemned” signs and colorful graffiti.
. But it was so easy, and he hadn’t had anyone to goad in…far too long. Since he last spoke with Potter, in fact. No—before that, even, because the last time he’d spoken with Potter, Draco had to be on polite terms with him because the git was testifying for him in the Wizengamot.
But before he could say it, Malfoy responded, “I had a good time, too. I’m glad I could help you figure some things out.”
Draco could use the money. He hadn’t been bluffing about the cost of supplies. Although he grew and collected many of his own ingredients, others weren’t feasible to produce himself; this tended to be true of the expensive ones.
He was looking at a field on the edge of a forest. Unicorns grazed near the treeline, the late afternoon sun gleaming over their hides.
Hermione’s eyelid gives a twitch, perhaps at his supercilious tone, and Harry feels a pang of fear—for Malfoy. The man holds himself very still and there is a
Harry released the memo. He watched it fly away, then he stood in his cubicle looking at his crumb-strewn plate, the stacks of paperwork that fluctuated in height (but never by much), and the little notepad on which he’d written “potions test kits.”
Harry takes an empty chair near the table. Malfoy glances at him. Hermione says, “Oh, hi Harry,” in a distant tone. The two of them return to their discourse. Harry, tired and hungry, wonders if he should have bothered coming right over. He has sandwich ingredients at home, and a comfortable sofa.
It’s not funny. Someone is attacking the wards with blasts of magic and absolutely no finesse—not unlike what Harry would do himself, in fact. In the past, he’s been accused of having “a lot of power and no control.” For the first time, he can appreciate what they mean.
to move that thing no matter how much the duchess wanted to have a view of the garden and the front door both—and so Draco took that moment to flick his wand at his hip, causing the cages to disappear from view. Edward tromped up behind him just as Draco slid his wand back into his pocket. There was a twinkle in the old man’s eye, which Draco found suspicious.
Luna and Ginny Apparated with him to a residential neighborhood in the city. They walked past houses brimming with flowers, vines, and vegetables. Luna named the plants as if introducing Harry to guests at a party as she strolled hand in hand with Ginny. They emerged onto a commercial street filled with pedestrians. The atmosphere was lively and casual, and cars passed up and down the street.
Harry takes in a deep, slow breath. What the hell? he thinks, and says, “Because you were all self-righteous about your cause, and I was intrigued by that.”
The short green and golden grass was dotted with little mounds of…something. He walked up to one. It looked as if a small pile of dark brown soil had been covered with stones, leaves, and sticks, forming a vaguely chaotic, vaguely aesthetic pattern.
“Aurors,” Harry said, cheerfully. Hermione had taught him the spell after Ron complained that Harry took
Distantly, he was aware of Malfoy pumping, hot, into him. Breath hitching, making a noise Harry hadn’t heard from him before. Hand squeezing Harry’s cock one last time, spasmodically, before slackening.
Really, Haystack Rock was barely visible in the gloom, but Harry liked it that way. He liked the stars above and the sounds of the surf, and Malfoy—barely visible—standing next to him.
It had been years since he’d boarded the train to Hogwarts. He remembered, quite clearly, how it felt to slam into the wall the time that the Hogwarts Express had already left.
Harry’s hands are shaking. He rubs his damp palms over his trouser legs. “You arse. You can’t help prodding a sore spot, can you?”
one kinky bastard.” He flipped a page. “Does Hermione know what you do to her collection when she’s not looking?”
crazy aunt. He loved their farm and their big, black-eyed cows and the fluffy sheep. But their goats. Their goats regularly escaped through the fence to terrorize his fruit trees and his
Harry releases a long-suffering sigh. “Yes, Malfoy. It was a close thing. The shield charm might not have gone up in time, or it might not have been strong enough. I didn’t recognize the curse, but it felt strong—and I did the only thing I knew would be 100% effective.”
“I know. I know. But, Harry, please take a moment to think about it. What was Robards’ reaction to the canceled hearing today? You’re not— Well, you’re not very good at pretending to feel something you aren’t.”
But the smell as he pushed the door open wasn’t bad. The sound of a tinkling bell, like a cat collar’s, greeted him, followed by a chorus of meows.
Occasionally, Potter interjected a question, but to Draco’s mild surprise, they were mostly reasonable.
They turned down a road Harry hadn’t been on before, past a thrift shop and a supermarket, to a bus stop. Malfoy looked for all the world like a Muggle standing there—at ease, like it was natural for him. Harry’s eye wasn’t the only one caught by him. Malfoy drew glances from passersby—women and men. Harry frowned at them, especially when Malfoy met some of their gazes and nodded in greeting.
He dabbed his fingers into it and rubbed it over his arms, which only served to remind him of Malfoy’s forearms and the tone his muscles must have had. He made a frustrated noise in his throat.
“What’s going on?” he says, moving away from the window. He gestures to the bed. (His guest chair disappeared in the night, the way furniture sometimes mysteriously appears and disappears from hospital rooms.)
Malfoy stood near Parkinson but a little off on his own. Like Parkinson, he nodded at Harry in greeting before turning his attention to Luna. He didn’t wear a hat today. His hair was soft around his face and shone in the sun. His sleeves were rolled up around his elbows, fingers tucked into his pockets, thumbs hooked through his belt loops. Harry’s heart did a funny thing every time he caught sight of the tattoo on his forearm.
Before he could give into the temptation to tip the lone brass cauldron onto the floor, he turned to his other brews. He stirred the Pepper-Up and added roses to the beautifying potion before turning down the heat on the blood-replenishing draught.
Finally, he gave up the attempt and had a shower amidst swirling currents of chill air. The water, at least, was steaming hot.
“Er, I can’t consume anything,” Potter said. When Draco turned to blink at him, he added, “I’m incorporeal.”
Harry keeps chopping. The carrot snaps under each stroke of the knife, releasing its sweet smell. He sweeps it into the waiting bowl. Reaches for the next.
From the corner of his eye, he saw Malfoy make a face and felt a surge of satisfaction from ignoring him.
Now, Harry drank his tea and helped Ginny sort through the brooms, casting renewed protection charms on them—charms to stabilize the steering and cushion the seats and to cause the brooms to follow close to their riders should someone become unseated. Harry hadn’t encountered some of the charms before, but Ginny showed him, and he picked them up quickly.
First, he takes a shower. There’s no reason, and little chance, for him to make it to the department before Hills and Bate. And even if Hills waits to report on Harry in his full write-up, there’s no chance Bate would pass up announcing it straight to Robards. So he takes his time. Not too long, but long enough to wash away the unclean feeling of having been a part of the engine that is steamrolling Malfoy and his research.
Harry hadn’t spent much time imagining what Ginny and Luna’s home would look like, really, so he shouldn’t have had any expectations—except he must have had something in mind, because the house surprised him. It wasn’t nearly as old as he’d expected. Not old at all, really—and nowhere near as patchily put-together as the Burrow. It had two stories and an attached garage, and was half-consumed by vines and flowers. A large tree leaned over the whole thing, shading it from the summer sun.
to have got her involved. It’s the least he can do after opening the whole can of flobberworms with Section III. The fact that he was the one to initiate the FORCE protocol (something he hasn’t told Malfoy or Hermione) continues to prick at him. So it serves him right that his best friend is too busy to spend time with him.
“That’s exactly my worry,” Draco muttered, so softly that Harry wouldn’t have heard it if their faces hadn’t been pressed together.
Harry was watching Malfoy at a Ministry party. Malfoy looked fey under the soft glow of the lighting charms. Pale, with eyes the grey of polished rock. A civilized predator in his sharp robes. Dangerous but contained, tamed.
He stood before the attendant could do anything as embarrassing as offer him a hand up. He collected his bag. Gave her a shaky smile. Made his way across the terminal.
Hermione was right—he and she are the only ones who know about Malfoy’s situation, and that places them both at special risk. So? Broadcast the truth.
They talked about Quidditch and George’s latest exploits in the Wheezes’ test lab and the audio drama Hermione and Molly had started listening to on the wireless, which Harry knew Ron used as an excuse to listen as well.
Anyway. He’d long given up trying to guess what significant event was going to take place when he felt this way. He used to spend half the day trying to figure it out, only to be wrong and be surprised anyway.
Harry pushed deeper and faster, till he had a rhythm going and Malfoy was whimpering and moving his hips to meet Harry’s hand, taking the finger up to the knuckle. Harry introduced a little twist to his movement, and Malfoy responded by canting his hips.
Like the last time, the lack of resistance startled him. He flowed into Malfoy, and it struck him how easy this was with Malfoy. Usually a small part of him balked at entering someone else’s mind, pulled himself back from the alien feeling of someone else’s thoughts. But he leaned into Malfoy like Malfoy was home.
There was something familiar about the combination of coffee and treacle tart. Harry frowned and considered it while Ron told him about a dragon smuggling case. He took another bite of tart, another sip of coffee. And realized that it tasted a lot like the brulee caramel coffee from Malfoy’s shop.
Ron presses his lips together. Harry feels his neck heat under his friend’s regard. Then Ron nods. “All right. But if you need me to help move the body, let me know.”
“Elizabeth will love these flowers,” he said, and Draco smiled thinly, resigned, as Edward segued into a story about his wife’s flowerbeds, their small garden as a whole, their cat, the raspberries, and the jams Elizabeth planned to make that year. Draco nodded along, staunchly ignoring the scent rising from his person.
Robards’ mouth presses into an even smaller flat line. His dark eyes continue to scan in little movements over Harry’s face. After an uncomfortable moment, he says, “It means the hearing’s been postponed. Pushed back for two weeks.”
“Ah—” A use in potions, actually, but Draco couldn’t say that. “Of course. The root. You don’t— You wouldn’t touch stinging nettles, would you?”
There is not a thing about Poesy Potions here. Every book, every paper—even his own research—is gone, and not just gone but cleaned out as neatly as if it never existed.
A number of younger twenty-somethings sat with their laptops at the wooden tables, along with a few older people reading newspapers. The art on the walls depicted coffee beans in bright colors, flowers in shades of grey, and photographs of old brown cloth sacks and antique farm equipment. At the far end of the shop, a large open threshold led into a back area littered with big steel machines that he guessed were used to prepare food.
Well, he could hardly complain about not having enough time to see them when he was standing around doing nothing at work. He sat down and pulled a pile of papers towards him, determined to finish early enough that he could swing by Ron and Hermione’s after leaving the office.
Draco dragged himself upstairs. He peeled out of his clothes, decided to vanish them, and had a second shower. The bathroom window finally deigned to be closed, and soon a luxurious steam filled the space.
He says, “Just make sure they postpone that hearing. Don’t let him say anything in front of the Wizengamot.”
.) By the time he found Luna again near the Erumpent’s field, the feeling of anxious anticipation had eased. But it settled over him again as soon as she looked up.
Draco fed the animals and then took his notes into the sitting room. Something was missing from the information Potter had given him. He’d thought that reviewing his notes again would give him an idea of
Ginny shrugged as she poured tea for both of them. “She’s my size. She’s soft. I grew up with men and dated men, and with her there’s no sense of competition and no sense of needing to boost her ego. We match.”
At first, the muggles look vaguely confused at the protest down a seemingly random street. Then—surprisingly and miraculously—they begin to join in as they catch whispers of what is going on, some with hastily-scrawled protest signs.
“What? Why? No one else is. People are here for hours with one cup of tea. I had a soup bowl of coffee and a posh sandwich.”
Draco rubbed his quill between his fingers. Of course, the true limiting factor—time—was one for which Potter could not reimburse him. Draco would be entering his busiest season, with stock to move and the garden to plant and early spring flowers to harvest and process.
“Actually, yeah. You know. Why don’t I just stick around the farm? I’m really enjoying it here. I like working with the animals and the Quidditch students.”
Ginny snickered harder. Harry ignored her. Luna slipped off to get him something and Harry continued to lounge, his eyes closed, his hands covering his face. He couldn’t get the image of Malfoy out of his head. Malfoy, smirking at him. Malfoy, laughing. Swirling things around the kitchen with a graceful wave of his wand. And his arms. His hands. The dough.
“Where is she now?” He reckoned he would have noticed the signs if Pansy were at the farm. There was a distinct lack of…shrieking.
Finished with the file, Hermione lets out a “hmph” and pushes it away. She reaches for the bowl of stew. As she does, she notices the letter open at the corner of the table, on top of some other papers. Before he can say anything, she pulls it closer. It’s a message sent by Robards. He wants Harry to come in for an exit interview. Harry hasn’t responded.
Harry’s heart pounded an uneven beat and then found its rhythm again. He had the urge to look closer, to search the names, but he resisted. He knew the names he’d find.
He liked it even less when Parkinson looked up and spotted them. Harry held back as Ginny and Luna made their way across the room. His gaze met Malfoy’s. He couldn’t quite discern the expression on Malfoy’s face in the shadow of the hat.
He still looked like Malfoy. Older, of course. Harry was still getting used to that. But there was something else about him, something different, something besides the short haircut and the Muggle clothes.
“Right,” Harry says. He finally falls silent, hands still clutched around the teacup, though it’s gone cold.
“Thanks,” Harry said, but he didn’t feel any better. He could still feel the crushing sensation under his foot, the tiny explosion.
After breakfast, she took him on the promised tour of the house, which involved looking into a lot of cupboards; Luna hadn’t been joking about the magical rooms. The non-magical rooms—which were behind normal-looking doors—held the same decorative touches as the magical ones, though they were more reasonably sized. Luna also showed him a room dedicated to knitting, a small reading room (“The libraries are in the basement”), a room with a TV, and a room filled with jars of dried herbs and blocks of beeswax, with beakers and bowls sitting about. The room smelled pungent but also a bit like honey. A little door at the end of the room led them to the shaded patio that they typically ate on. They exited through an archway dripping with green beans and wound their way through the vegetable garden.
He didn’t know what to say. A lot of things came to mind. He still hadn’t apologized for the Sectumsempra scars. He hadn’t thanked Malfoy properly for showing him how to make bread and coffee. Thoughts of sitting by the oceanside came to mind. Overlooking the frothing surf. Malfoy’s fingers tracing over his ribs.
He kicked his shoes off at the back door and went to slip on the sandals Ginny had brought for him soon after he’d first arrived. Maybe he’d take a walk through the garden before going upstairs—breathe some air and get lost on the twisted path and clear his mind.
of the magic-repressing effects of this byproduct? They’ve known for years! It’s all here—in public records, no less!”
“Most modern non-magical bakers use machines to do much of the work of baking bread, including kneading.” He sniffed. “It’s more efficient—if you don’t care for flavor. Here, we make our bread by hand.”
They finished their beers, and Harry stole two more. He was halfway through the second, watching a bright point move slowly across the sky—and wondering if he should ask Malfoy up to his room—when Malfoy said, “Would you like to see the coast?”
Except, instead of turning left down the hall towards the front door, Edward turned right, and Draco had to double-step to catch up.
“Do you really not remember?” Harry asks. His voice is hoarse, low. His face heats at the sound of it.
Harry balked; for an instant, he thought the implausible was happening, that he’d overestimated his own ability. He sensed a flash of consternation, a feeling that came with such an impression of Malfoy rolling his eyes that Harry could practically see it, and then the tight packet of memories opened like a flower, petals all coming apart and surrounding Harry.
scoop? Not that I would sell it. No. That would just cheapen it, wouldn’t it? A secret that everyone knows isn’t a secret anymore. It’s worth nothing.”
They cast Levitation Charms together and moved up the hill with it, Malfoy keeping pace with Harry. The rest was relatively simple: they lowered the tree into the hole—Luna using magic to gather the roots to fit inside—and then filled the remaining space with soil.
“Don’t worry, I won’t tarnish your sparkling image of Gryffindor morality,” Malfoy says, and Harry can’t tell if he’s being serious or sarcastic. “Bathroom is
Malfoy’s fingers were already slick, somehow, when they brushed over Harry’s hole. Daydream. This was a daydream.
It couldn’t be Malfoy. The man looked nothing like him. His hair was just long enough to fall loosely around his face, framing angular features. He wore a
“I guess I must have,” Harry concedes, with a small smile despite himself. “But I didn’t think so at the time. Prat.”
“Nothing at all, really. We thought you might be hungry, though, and Ginny wanted to take you to one more pub before you go back. I thought it would be nice for you to visit Sassy Spider, but as a guest this time. You can tell us what you learned about the beers.”
“Just drink it, Potter. There’s nothing in it but cocoa, milk, and sugar. I thought you could at least appreciate that. You look like death warmed over. Without the warmth.”
Harry’s mind went blank. When he came to awareness an instant later—pulse racing—his mouth formed the words, “You
The list of beers stretched three pages. Each bore an outrageous name, along with a startling alcohol content and a description that might have been written by a poet imbibing the goods. Harry's eyes glazed over.
Since he can’t think about Malfoy and the twist of emotions there, he plunges into his outrage at the visit from Hills and Bate.
Ginny snorted, pecked her cheek, and set the tray on the table. They served themselves quiche and salad and sliced peaches.
Hermione doesn’t look convinced by Harry’s reply, but Ron comes to his rescue by bringing up muggle football, his newest fascination. Arthur got him into watching it over Christmas on Ron and Hermione’s old muggle TV, and now Ron goes off on indecipherable tangents that Harry can’t follow, filled with teams and players and rules he doesn’t recognize. He feels about as baffled as Hermione looks when he and Ron go off about Quidditch, and she sends him a wry grin. Ron doesn’t notice. He returns Hermione’s small smile but doesn’t try to derail Ron. Truthfully, he’s glad for the reprieve.
“What do you mean?” she asked in a falsely sweet voice. “Malfoy did such a good job dispersing that swarm. He’d be understandably tired from it.”
They search Malfoy’s bedroom and then the guest room whose white sheets are still rumpled from Harry leaping out of them. It may be his imagination, but he thinks Hills pauses for a moment at the sight. But it could be that Harry is just worried and oversensitive.
He stared moodily out the kitchen window as his bread toasted, then ate it at the counter with his soup and cheese, scowling as he munched. He brushed off his hands. He looked down at the kitchen table with all of its books and notes.
“Now the best part,” he said, and—with measured movements—began to pour the steamed milk into the puddle of espresso at the bottom of the cup. The coffee billowed with pale swirls of milk until it turned a soft brown. With a flourish, Malfoy drew a white flower pattern onto the surface with the frothed milk.
Harry scanned the space. Sunlight lit the tall ceilings. The coffeehouse, though relatively small, had a vast bright feel to it. Maybe a converted warehouse.
“Right,” Malfoy murmured. “Well, I wish you all the best with it. It sounds like a large undertaking. I’m sure your godfather would have been happy to see it.”
“No? You don’t want to see the kinds of things the Ministry has been sending its citizens? I guess it is rather easier to turn away.”
Harry folded his hands on the table. His wand pressed against his thigh in its holster. Sometimes he’d leave it on the table next to him, a casual threat and a way to mock the offender; fun, to see who paled at the sight of it, who tried to leap across the table in a wild grab. But those kinds of games would be an insult to Malfoy.
. Indeed. He stared, unblinking, for a long moment at his notes before slamming the notebook shut. If he’d listened to his mentor and chosen to reformulate the Potion of All Potential for his mastery practicum, he would have possibly—probably—been done by now, and he would have had the enhancing effects of
He freezes, hearing the echo of his words with horror. He’s instantly aware of where his wand is located—wedged in the seat, under his thigh—and the tensing of his muscles as they ready to dodge. Because his hazed and spinning mind expects Malfoy to explode in anger.
When they’re out of sight, Harry sags against the railing. His mind veers off on two parallel tracks: one, that someone must have called in a report on Malfoy. And the other, that he is completely screwed.
“Ah,” Malfoy says, his eyebrows rising even higher in an expression that sparks Harry’s anger. He’s already nervous about being here and feels like he’s hanging out on a line.
necessary. And he couldn’t bring himself to truly decline the help. The blackberries had nasty thorns and were impervious to magic. He’d spent three days hacking at the things last year and still had some of the scars; despite it, they’d nearly swallowed the garden a few weeks later. Supposedly, they were muggle plants, but what muggle plants grew like that? It wasn’t right. Maybe with some assistance, he could pull the roots up and be done with the bramble.
That was when he heard the voice. So faint, he thought it was a product of his imagination. He paused, setting the butter knife down. No. In fact, it sounded like a real voice, and it came from beyond the front door. A wash of unease tickled over his arms. Something about the tenor of the voice struck him as familiar.
The fairies were getting thicker around Harry. He waved his arm and let off a couple of extra rounds to clear them so he could see, but it didn’t work—as soon as the Emitter had fired, they closed in again. Harry couldn’t see the ground.
They took a more languid drive today. Malfoy drove with his hands loose on the wheel, settled back in his seat. There was no sense of needing to get somewhere. They were simply going. Harry liked that. He watched the sea cliffs and homes and trees pass by. He and Malfoy hadn’t spoken much since waking, which was a contrast to all of the things Malfoy had said to him that morning.
