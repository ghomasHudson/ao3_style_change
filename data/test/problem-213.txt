Not wanting to let Weasley mess with his shot again, he tossed as soon as he was within range. In his rush, his grip on the ball faltered and caused his shot to lose its usual power. The ball fell short, bouncing off the rim.
The entire ship sharply lurches to the side, making Harry’s stomach turn over, and then immediately rights itself again. The manoeuvre gives Harry whiplash, but he manages to remain upright by holding onto the back of Hermione’s chair. Dean and Seamus aren’t as lucky – they have both fallen to the floor.
Potter shared with Draco what he had been up to. After the trials, he hadn’t enrolled in any universities like Draco had, choosing instead to travel the world. He had just returned to Britain when he sent Draco the first letter. He said his travels taught him things — he didn’t elaborate what — and all he wanted to do now was make amends with Draco and get to know him better.
To his surprise, Lucius and Narcissa looked at each other and smiled contentedly. Draco, however, was staring at him incredulously as though he had grown another head.
“Er, hi, um,” Harry stammered. “Yesterday Mrs Kelley of the Wizengamot was found unconscious in her office. We found this next to her.” He held up a small plastic bag containing pieces of a broken vial. “We suspect she was poisoned. We need you to figure out what it was… and make the antidote.” Harry winced at his own words. “I can bring you to see her if you want.”
“Draco,” Harry said pleadingly. “I’ve liked you ever since I bumped into you in that hallway at university at the beginning of the semester.
“You didn’t have to do that,” Draco says softly as they exit the building, snow crunching beneath their boots.
In the second quarter, Draco held back on shooting and focused on bringing the ball to the other scorers — namely Greg, Blaise and Weasley —  as quickly as possible. The strategy worked because they soon narrowed the score gap.
Harry glared at Ron with such intensity that the red-haired man fidgeted in his seat. This went on for a couple of minutes before Ron slammed his pen on the table and hissed, “What?”
fixed your robes and now you're going to go there covered in Floo powder?" he practically shrieked in alarm as he pushed Potter away from the fireplace. "Be a civilized wizard and Apparate there, you idiot."
He waved a hand at his cheek and muttered a wandless numbing spell. Back in the bedroom, Malfoy had his back turned towards him, facing the opposite wall. Harry gingerly slipped under the covers and whispered, “Good night, Malfoy.”
to me. The only reason I don't put my hands on you is because I'm sure I'll touch you at inappropriate places, which is what I'll do right now if you don't get dressed."
“Maybe we should talk with the Healers,” Potter suggested when they reached the waiting room still holding hands. “Get their advice.”
“I just finished a tournament.” Draco guided Harry’s hand higher. “You’re going to have to do all the work.”
Malfoy opened his mouth, but nothing came out, as though he had forgotten to speak. Or, Harry realised, he had yelled himself hoarse trying to wake Harry up. That explained the pain blooming on his cheek; Malfoy had literally slapped him to consciousness.
In a flash, Malfoy got up and went to grab the St Mungo’s bag from the bookshelf. Harry lifted a hand to check his face but stopped when Malfoy yelled, “Don’t touch it! It’s about an inch above your left eyebrow. I’m telling you so don’t touch it!”
"I want you," Draco murmured, breaths short and hot against Harry’s cheek, "but I don't… I don't know…"
Harry’s practice mainly involved repetition. Draco would toss a ball a certain height and Harry would hit it towards the opponent’s court. They repeated this until Harry had sent all the balls flying across the net.
They Apparated to Muggle London, where they walked around in a large park and enjoyed the autumn breeze, hands clasped between them.
When Ron slipped out of the booth to play some darts with Dean and Seamus, neither of them noticed. They kept on talking, their heads so close they were almost touching.
The largest of the men, probably the leader, advanced towards Harry with glee gleaming in his beady eyes.
Draco tore his gaze away from Potter’s muscular thighs and forced himself to look into a pair of brilliant green eyes instead. They weren’t blocked behind those ugly glasses this time; Draco was amazed he found his voice quickly enough to explain, “You were having a nightmare. You wouldn’t wake up.”
Malfoy lifts his head and listens silently for a second, as though to make sure Madam Pomfrey has indeed left. Then he goes back to leaning against Harry.
“Draco?” Harry called from the cashier counter, where a staff member of the apothecary was patiently waiting. “What’s taking you so long?”
Malfoy rolled his eyes and carried the briefcase to the writing desk. While he worked, Harry washed the dishes and cleaned the kitchen. While preparing for breakfast, Harry had discovered that the pantry had a large selection of food and baking appliances. Maybe he should experiment with more dishes. Maybe bake something? Didn't Malfoy say he wanted Harry to cook for him every day?
“You still feel cold?” Harry asks. When Malfoy nods, he slowly backs himself against a wall and leans on it for support. Malfoy follows and leans against him.
He looked around his imaginary scenario. "No. They're here but they don't look angry at me. They're with Potter."
"From Head Auror Robards," Healer Kim explained when her head returned. "I'll see you again tomorrow. Have a nice day!"
“I'm staying.” Harry summoned a stool and made himself comfortable on it. "I like watching you work.”
And God knows Harry only got to see Malfoy at work. He had invited Malfoy to pub nights with his friends many times, but he always turned him down.
Madam Pomfrey takes out her wand and casts diagnostic charms on Draco. “Your temperature and other vital signs are normal,” she reports. “How are you feeling?”
Malfoy is hugging his own body, shoulders hunched and eyes screwed shut as though in pain. "It's freezing."
predicament of mine. You're incredibly kind to everyone so perhaps I'm just another colleague to you."
Malfoy shoots Harry a disturbed look. “I’ve never tried it before. I’m not sure how I’ll react to it.”
Later that evening, Draco put aside the paperwork and rested on the couch. He dozed off at some point and woke up when Potter tapped his shoulder.
has been tasked to escort and protect her throughout her entire voyage to the Andromeda Belt, where the Starfleet Federation will be joining the other superpowers in the galaxy for the Millennial Peace Conference in the Belt’s largest star:
Harry completely fell for Draco the day their midterms results were announced. To celebrate, Harry smuggled two bottles of beer into their room. Alcohol was forbidden in the dorms, but Draco had never gotten drunk before, and he claimed he was dying to try.
Potter’s forehead furrowed in confusion, so Draco lifted up his arm and showed Potter how the mark looked as Draco viewed it, with the origin point at his wrist at the top and the branching lines going down.
Harry sees the smile again when he’s deep inside Malfoy, when fingernails are dragging down his back and long legs are around his hips and those thin pink lips are murmuring Harry’s name like a prayer. He feels undone, utterly enamoured and hopelessly in love. The only thing better than seeing his smile is kissing him, so Harry leans in and does just that. Malfoy kisses him back with new levels of passion, hunger and boldness; it brings Harry even closer to the edge.
Draco smoothly changed his course and walked toward his teammate, who waited for him beside a girl with bright eyes and large hair.
The waiting game is torture. Harry is never good at doing nothing, so he reads a random book he grabbed off of Draco’s bookshelf, an arm around Draco’s waist as the Potions Professor grades students’ essays. Harry quickly gets bored of the book, and tosses it aside in favour of leaning against Draco’s back and holding him tighter. He rests his head against Draco’s shoulder, breathing in his apple-scented soap.
“Harry, where are you going?” Hermione gasped in horror when Harry slid off his seat and stealthily moved down the bleachers.
After returning the tray to the bar, Harry ducked into the kitchen, casting a Disillusionment Charm on himself as he walked towards the back door, removing his waiter apron and uniform along the way. By the time he exited out back and into a corridor, he was Harry Potter, but a specific kind of Harry Potter. This version was dressed like a gentleman, a sophisticated tuxedo and a black bowtie, complete with his signature round-rimmed spectacles, short stubble across his chin and jaw, hair slicked back to display his lightning bolt scar.
“No,” Potter said firmly. “When I sent that letter on your birthday, I hadn't gotten my soulmark yet, and you had just gotten yours. I couldn’t have known. I’ve been obsessed with you since I was sixteen. I realised later that I have feelings for you. Travelling the world taught me that I should explore these feelings before it’s too late.”
Zabini’s dark skin takes on an odd colouring as he flushes angrily. After a long moment, he spits out, “Allow me to check with the Captain.”
But beneath the platinum gleam was a man who yearned to be loved, and Harry had lots of love to give.
The house Draco shared with Pansy Parkinson was a triple-storey terrace house, with a balcony on each floor. The facade had been refreshed with a coat of white paint. From the pavement where Harry parked his motorcycle, there was a short flight of stairs leading up to a mahogany front door.
“Of course it is. Can you imagine my father entrusting it to anybody else?” For some reason Draco finds this idea amusing and chuckles. “Whenever the Captain gives us the order to jump, we activate the Black Alert. Then my father hands over the ship to me and my crew. So during these short moments,
The next letter came in early July. This time the owl dropped the letter right onto his head in the middle of a lecture, much to the amusement of his classmates. The Potions Professor clapped his hands to get the students to focus while Draco, recognizing the handwriting, hastily tucked the letter into his robes.
The idea of the sphere falling into Draco’s hands and potentially harming him made Harry angry again.
The section Draco was in was darker than the rest of the shop and felt rather claustrophobic, with narrow walkways in between tall shelves packed with potions in various containers. Draco had his head in one of the large display glass cases. He picked up one vial, peered at it closely and then, with a sour expression, returned it back to its spot. Harry looked curiously at the assortment of products on the shelves, turning around while he walked. Until he bumped into Draco’s back.
During the first five minutes, the game moved at a very rapid pace. Every time he got the ball, he’d move inside and try for either a lay-up or a two-point shot,  but he was always blocked by Goldstein or Weasley. Each failure made him more and more frustrated, and he grew obsessed with scoring.
"I wasn't paying attention. The rules are too complicated,” Draco complained. He tried to avoid looking directly into Harry’s eyes with limited success. “Basketball is much simpler.”
After the professor finished giving instructions for their assignment, Draco and Harry compared schedules. They took different programs, and this class was the only one they shared this semester. Draco wanted to work on the assignment as soon as possible, which for some reason, made Harry laugh and comment how Draco reminded him of one of his best friends.
Suddenly a strong gust of wind blasted around them. Draco grabbed Harry’s wrist and pulled him towards the direction he came from. Harry followed Draco into the wheat field, but as soon as he stepped between the tall stalks, his surroundings changed. Gone were the yellow scenery, replaced by a vast landscape of a snowy mountain valley.
"No, we aren’t," Harry declared, Vanishing the abomination with a muttered incantation and a wave of his hand.
“Yes, we promised to grab a meal afterwards,” Hermione replied, still seated. “Aren’t you joining us?”
Draco felt his neck getting warm, but he could not look away. It felt like a challenge; breaking eye contact would mean defeat. “Surely basketball is more challenging.”
Harry sounded very serious and suddenly this conversation wasn’t amusing anymore. Draco cleared his throat. “No, I don’t.”
When the referee blew his whistle to signal the end of the game, the applause and cheers in the gym were deafening. Harry didn’t bother checking the final scores; Hogwarts had won, and only that mattered.
Draco was useless in the kitchen, of course, much to Harry’s amusement. He eventually was assigned to helping Granger set the dining table while Harry and Weasley worked in the kitchen.
Harry dashed to close his wardrobe and nudged a volleyball with his foot to send it rolling under the desk. He searched for a suitable place for Draco to sit, eyes going between the pile of clothes on his chair to the unmade bed, visibly contemplating which option was less mortifying.
Draco apologised to Potter at the Astronomy Tower, overlooking the school grounds while the cool breeze chilled him to the bones. Once the words were out, he couldn’t stop. His mind yanked at each of his mistakes, uprooting all his flaws from his first year, from the first time he spoke to Potter, from the moment he was
“Um, Draco, you said you don’t go to pubs,” said Harry. “Does that mean if I had invited you to anything else, like a dinner, you would have said yes?”
"I'm hungry," Draco said. He also wanted to see Potter earlier but he kept that bit a secret. "May I borrow Kreacher?"
“At least we’re alone,” Harry remarked, smiling as Draco traced the veins along his arm with pale fingers.
But Malfoy had laughed and given him a genuine, almost relieved, smile that had caught Harry off-guard. “I can’t believe I’m saying this Potter, but I’m glad it’s you.”
"Dentists? Muggle Healers specializing in dental pathology?" Draco remembered reading that somewhere.
He was too tired and devastated to lie to Pansy, so he spilled. He recounted from the beginning: They crossed paths at the Ministry about two months ago. Potter had asked for his address on the pretence of returning his wand, but even after doing that, they kept on exchanging letters until two weeks prior, Potter had asked him out on a date. That was when they embarked on their nightly trysts.
And even after doing all this continuously, sweating and breathing heavily, Harry never made any mistakes; his movements never lost power or speed. The
Their last interaction was two years prior, a few months after the War trials. Draco had met Harry and his friends at a Ministry event and apologised to them as best as he could.
“Potter?” Draco yelled, a hand shielding his squinted eyes from the harsh wind. His dark robes billowed out around his knees  “What are you doing here?”
“We are all both,” Draco explains when Harry points this out. Both scientists and soldiers, but Starfleet all the same. “Including myself.”
if Malfoy thought he was pathetic? The man had seen him cry in his sleep. “We’re stuck in this situation because of me. And you were angry at me.”
“Second Cockpit?” Harry repeats. It’s the first time he’s heard of such a term. Ships only have one cockpit. Only one captain.
Instead of replying, Malfoy wheels around briskly but in his haste, he accidentally sends his elbow right into Harry's ribs. Harry collapses back onto the cushion, moaning in pain while Malfoy kneels between Harry's legs and apologetically rubs the spot he hit Harry.
Slowly, like a cat, Malfoy’s arms slide around Harry’s torso. He presses his cheek to Harry’s chest, his shoulders rising when he inhales deeply, tension rolling off his body. He stretches his legs around and in between Harry’s. As if that isn’t bad enough, Malfoy lets out a pleased
Harry cast a Silencing Charm around them. Malfoy was working on their case reports on the writing desk so he didn’t want to disturb him. Harry proceeded to tell Ron everything Healer Kim had told them and happily informed his best friend how well stocked the pantry was, and how he was contemplating spending his free time cooking since he hadn’t had the time to do much lately. Maybe he could finally put the cookbook Molly had gifted to good use.
"Potter," he murmured. With how close they were, he didn't need to speak above a whisper. "I want to try something. It might help you with your nightmares."
Harry and Draco never got the chance to talk much during actual lectures; they only shared one class per week and Professor Scrimgeour was generous with his insults to students who chatted during his lectures.
“Um, my glasses, for instance.” Harry pointed at his eyewear. “Prescription glasses are expensive so I try to pay for them myself. The same goes for most of my volleyball gear.”
“If it appears again, remember not to touch it,” reminded Malfoy, putting away the potion. “It spreads easier and quicker that way. As soon as you notice one, we must apply the potion right away.”
“No, I just really need to use your bathroom,” Harry assures tightly. “I’ll come back, if you want?”
“And that thing followed you here?” Harry raised an unbelieving eyebrow, but it explained why nobody mentioned finding any cursed objects around Draco’s unconscious body.
“It’s good to see you here,” Potter said. “What are the odds of the two of us having a session at the same time? Maybe they arranged the timetable in alphabetical order."
He collapsed onto the couch, tucked his legs underneath him and picked up the cordless telephone. Despite having already memorised the number, he glanced at the small paper in his hand, just to make sure.
Draco almost added that most of his friends were in Arts School, too, but he was interrupted by Professor Scrimgeour, who declared that time was up and ordered the students to leave.
Harry needs something to do with his hands, so he pushes his own fringe up his head, feeling the start of a headache. "Yeah, I understand."
"I don't care how you know my father," he hissed through gritted teeth, "but keep him off the court."
About five metres from where Harry stood, a tall wall of wheat parted and out walked Draco Malfoy, decked in his elegant navy blue Unspeakable uniform. His skin was pale and there were dark circles below his eyes, but he appeared unharmed. His usually immaculate blonde hair was slightly tousled, thanks to the breeze.
“Never took the test. Never needed to.” He tried to recall who among his friends could drive. He knew Blaise could, and maybe Vince too. Pansy and Theo definitely couldn’t.
Harry stepped back and Draco busied himself with searching for his books of ingredients. When the Auror took a seat on a stool, Draco spun back to him.
It seemed like an eternity had passed before Draco felt a hand gently nudge his. "Can I call you Draco?" The request was anxious, shy and hopeful.
Harry had kept the end of his deal. Even though he could never reach Harry’s level, Draco’s speed and endurance had improved over the last several months, which proved to be beneficial during his basketball matches. Harry had told Draco that if his passes were like lightning, then he now moved like the wind.
They stay like that for several minutes until the thin fabric of Harry’s T-shirt becomes uncomfortably wet. “Um, Malfoy? You should get dressed.”
“That’s not what I—  I meant the least idiotic!” Draco flushed and scowled. “Let’s get back on track, shall we?”
“My goodness, Potter. Chaperoning students is a terribly dull task,” Malfoy scoffs. “Why are you so eager?”
Harry understands the value of fuel, but he sees Apparition the same way Lucius Malfoy sees it – the secret advantage that can bring their forces behind enemy lines and catch them by surprise. Harry believes that once the Federation listens to Draco’s presentation about this, they’ll wet themselves with ecstasy. Finally, the prospect of ending The War doesn’t seem so impossible.
There, Harry had said it. He could not backtrack now. “Hermione and Ron can make it work. They even have a baby together.”
But Potter only grunted and pulled his hands away. He turned his body and curled into a fetal position, sobs escaping his lips, still trapped in his nightmare.
Because every time his shot flew through the hoop, the crowd cheered; Blaise and Greg gave him high-fives and Weasley slapped him on the back; Snape nodded at him approvingly. During these short moments, Draco felt a sense of happiness and belonging that he had never experienced before.
Harry immediately grabbed his hips and pulled; Draco had to grab Harry’s shoulders to remain balanced. The tips of their noses almost collided. Draco carefully removed Harry’s round spectacles and placed them on a nearby dresser, out of the way.
“Neville’s bedroom is nearest to the phone, so he’s usually the one to pick up,” said Harry cheerfully. “The other two guys are Ron and Dean. You’ll meet Ron at your basketball club later. Dean is in Arts School.”
Draco's hand hovered hesitantly over Harry's. The Auror muttered a quick apology before grabbing Draco's elbow and yanking them both to St Mungo’s.
With a sigh, Draco went to a corner of the hut and kicked a large rock the size of Quaffle to Harry’s feet. “Do you have a wand?”
The wards around Grimmauld Place had been modified to allow certain people to Apparate in and out. Aside from Harry himself, the only two people who could do this were Ron and Hermione. So Ron only needed to walk to the edge of Burrow wards before Apparating with Harry straight to his living room.
Harry was stunned into silence, clearly not expecting Draco to respond in such a manner, which made Draco blush even more deeply. For almost a minute, neither of them spoke. Draco took this time to calm his quickening heartbeats and level his breathing.
Harry briskly sends a Patronus to the hospital wing. Then he takes Malfoy's arm and tugs it around his own shoulders, while his other hand pulls Malfoy closer by the waist. Malfoy slumps readily against his body as Harry half-carries-half-guides him back to his quarters.
When it was time for him to go, Potter headed to the fireplace, which earned him a scolding from Draco.
Harry wasn’t ready to share his thoughts with Malfoy yet. Without another word, he went to the kitchen and got to work to distract himself.
“My entire crew will be escorting you,” Harry replies, annoyance pricking under his skin at Captain Malfoy’s lack of faith, but he reminds himself to behave. He has extensive battlefield experience under his belt, making him extremely qualified for this mission; no attitude from an elderly, rude Captain can make him doubt it. “The strength of which I am happy to share with you, Captain, if you allow me onboard.”
“I don’t think that's a good idea,” Harry mutters, wheezing. He has managed to keep his hands off Malfoy by planting them flat on the wall, but he isn't sure how long he can keep at it. “You’re naked under that towel."
As soon as Draco made the toss, Weasley appeared—out of nowhere—and jumped to block. His hand touched the ball, not enough to grab it out of the air, but more than sufficient to derail its course. The ball flew cleanly over the hoop and bounced against a wall.
She tossed a pink star-shaped pillow into Harry’s lap. Harry took it into his hands right away but stilled when he turned towards Draco.
Then he slowly lowers himself to his knees until he is just below Teddy’s eye level. He looks at the stuffed dragon trapped between Teddy’s chest and elbow. “Is he your friend?” he asks softly, almost like a whisper.
“No, there isn’t,” said Blaise, baffled. “There isn’t any basketball tournament in the city at the moment.”
He shook his head. Stopping now would just be delaying the inevitable, and he wanted none of that. “I’m not telling you to stop, Harry.”
Harry didn’t need to think. “All my life, I’ve had people deciding things for me, telling me what to do. I always feel I have to be a certain way, do certain things and even like certain people.” He paused to glance at Draco, who was fidgeting in his seat. “But nobody needed to tell me to love Draco. I just do. It’s my own feelings born out of my own volition and choices and no one can tell me it’s wrong, or that I shouldn’t feel this way. I am being selfish for the first time in my life and I won't apologise for it. I promise you I will do everything in my power to keep him from harm.”
They returned home from St Mungo’s in silence. After a brief pause, Harry took out his wand and spelled any soot off Draco’s clothes, hair and the bandage around his eyes.
Harry barely noticed the Rosenberg team arriving when they took their place at the other bench. Their jerseys were black with bright red along the seams and the font.
“Very on-the-nose, isn’t it?” Potter said, smiling at Draco’s bewilderment. “I bet my magic knows I wouldn’t understand if it gave me something subtle or vague. I’ve travelled around the world. You’re still the only Draco I know.”
When he reached a meter from Harry, something white and fast darted across his neck, sending his eyes rolling to the back of his head while his body convulsed and dropped to the floor.
Fueled by anger, Draco pulled his arm back and swung the ball with all his might. The ball zipped across the court like a rocket.
"I wear my heart on my sleeve.” Harry wraps his arms tighter around Malfoy’s waist. “And guess who's in my heart."
Draco clamped his mouth shut, cheeks burning. He knew if he turned towards Potter now, he would see him staring wide-eyed at him, and he could not deal with those bright green eyes this late at night so he fixed his gaze onto the ceiling.
Narcissa heaved a great sigh of relief. “We are not harmed. Jumpy helped reinforce the wards when your father and I grew tired.”
Malfoy handed Harry one of the bags and kept one for himself. Inside were 13 vials containing deep yellow liquid and 3 vials of pink. Each vial was the size of Harry's thumb.
They didn’t get to talk much in the library. The librarian, a fussy middle-aged lady with dirty blond curls and large horn-rimmed glasses, would berate any student who even whispered in her vicinity. After obtaining the reading materials they needed, Harry suggested they study at the campus park instead.
City Stadium actually consisted of many different stadiums. After Blaise dropped him off outside the stadium compound, Draco spent a minute being lost. He was searching for a map or signage when he heard a familiar voice calling him.
Even after the motorcycle slowed and finally stopped, Draco kept himself pressed against Harry’s back for almost a minute to calm his nerves. Harry’s body was hard and steady, like a pillar, but also warm and comforting.
There was an audible gasp from the audience when Weasley successfully caught the speedy ball with both hands. He smoothly tossed the ball into the hoop before any defender could stop him.
Draco practically moved to Grimmauld Place because the house had strong wards to repel any Howlers or unfriendly letters. Before moving, he warned Blaise, Greg and Theo not to send him any letters for fear that they would be traced back either to him or to them. Pansy then quickly sold off their flat and escaped to Paris. Reporters and ‘concerned citizens’ hunted down all of Harry’s friends, demanding to know whether it was true:
The Potions Professor is unimpressed when Harry tells him about the trip, instead rolling his eyes at Harry’s enthusiasm.
He tied the letter to his owl with shaking hands and watched it fly away until it vanished from sight.
Draco grabbed Harry's hands. “I never want to hear about potted plants again in my entire life,” he declared out of the blue, before whispering, “Don’t just
Draco glanced at the empty seats around him. He wasn’t sure if the other students were averse to sitting so close to Professor Scrimgeour or simply avoided sitting near
The first time Harry and Draco kissed, they had just solved their first case together. Harry dragged Draco to a pub, and after several rounds of drinks in a booth, the alcohol loosened Draco's tongue and reduced his inhibitions. Before they knew it, they were making out right in the booth, unhidden, out in the open for anyone to see.
So that was how Draco ended up with Harry’s head in his lap, the only thing separating Harry’s black hair and his thighs was a pink pillow. Admitting defeat, Draco brushed Harry’s wild, damp hair with one hand while Harry took his other hand and clutched it to his chest. He could feel the faint rhythm of Harry’s heartbeats against his fingertips.
As Harry glared at his soggy French toasts, he felt Draco's arms wind around his waist from behind. A sharp chin rested on his shoulder. "Are we going to eat that?"
Draco still refused to learn any volleyball terms, but Harry was sure that would change soon. Peppering kisses along Draco’s jaw, he jokingly asked, “Join the volleyball club with me?”
Harry laughed. They were sitting side-by-side on Harry's bed, backs leaned against the wall. "Are you drunk already?"
Harry took a step closer, right into Draco’s personal space. “Stay still. Trust me, okay?” he whispered before gently tucking Draco’s long hair behind his ears. Draco froze, barely noticing Harry’s hand brushing the back of his head to flatten the hair there because he was too busy staring at Harry’s face.
"Madam Shaw of the Wizengamot lost her husband this morning," he explained, letting Draco brush away tiny specks of dust on his attire. "The funeral is tomorrow but she is having a small gathering at her home tonight to… pray?"
Draco groaned. The occupants of the room must have heard him because everything fell silent immediately. Slowly sitting up, Draco blinked to adjust to the bright light before surveying his surroundings. Then he shook his head and blinked again, not believing what he was seeing.
Draco’s Mother arrived in the evening, accompanied by Weasley. She sobbed while Draco held her hands reassuringly. Healer Kim had kept her updated every day, but she couldn’t visit him until he was out of isolation. It was torture for her; she had just lost her husband a few years ago and could not bear losing her only son. While his Mother pressed a handkerchief to her nose, he glanced at the other side of the room, where Harry and Weasley were whispering by the windows.
Pansy rubbed his back as he buried his wet face in his hands. She let him cry until he was spent before bringing him to his bedroom, which was so bland, he found himself wishing that he was still in Potter's bed right now.
Draco bought gifts for Harry for no apparent reason, aside from “This reminded me of you” or “I thought you might like it”. The gifts varied from a simple button badge to a 3D printer Harry had drooled over since the beginning of the semester. Harry soon stopped refusing them once he realised that it was Draco’s way of showing his feelings. His love language.
Malfoy punched his elbow, snapping him out of his reverie. With a wince, Harry cleared his throat, “Um, what do you want for lunch?”
“I know,” Harry sighed, almost dreamily. It had only been a few years since Harry accepted that he liked men. Society during this time wasn't kind towards people like him, so he shared this secret only with a selected few. Aside from Remus and Sirius, the only two other people who knew about Harry's sexuality were his two best friends since high school.
Longbottom and Thomas took care of cleaning up. Weasley sent Granger home in his car while Draco found himself on Harry’s motorcycle again.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow at him and then shrugged. “It’s a pancake, Potter. It’s just fine,” he said blandly, continuing to eat. Then he lifted his head and regarded Harry suspiciously. “Did you make these? Is that why you’re so eager for my feedback?”
Harry didn't know the way, so he panicked a bit, quickly searching for his friends. He was relieved to see Hermione and Ron a short distance in front of them, both standing still and watching him curiously, having heard the commotion. Harry signalled them to “go on” before bending down to pick up his backpack, which had been lying abandoned on the floor. It was a miracle no one had stepped on it.
The last thing Draco remembered before losing consciousness was being irritated at Potter. This was somehow all Potter’s fault. When he woke up, it was to the noise of Harry Potter shouting.
Even with Granger’s explanations, Draco struggled to grasp the perplexing rules. If someone had asked him about the match later, he wouldn’t be able to answer.
Draco shrugged. “What I like doing is none of his business,” he said, wrapping an arm around Harry. “I only won because of my teammates. And you. I couldn’t have done it without you.”
Draco closed his eyes, feeling himself fall deeper and deeper as Potter's fingers brushed against his palm. "Might as well, Harry."
Draco awoke to new surroundings. He vaguely remembered being alone in a small room surrounded by glass, with a Ventilator-Bubble Charm over his mouth and nose. Now he didn't need that charm anymore because he could breathe on his own again.
Malfoy looks so vulnerable and unsure; Harry has an intense desire to kiss him, to whisper love confessions into his ear — but Harry simply smiles and vows, “I will.”
“My mother used to give me some whenever I had trouble sleeping. It might not work for you, but it doesn’t hurt to try, does it?”
Teddy looks up at Uncle Harry, who laughs at the hope in the boy’s eyes. “Sure, anything you want, Teddy.”
Ron wrapped his arms tightly around Hermione, smiling widely for the first time that day. "Sorry we're late," he said, elbowing Harry's arm. "This guy forgot to set his alarm clock again."
“Then I’m your friend, too,” the man says cheerfully, holding out a pale hand at Teddy. “My name is Draco. It means dragon.”
Ron tapped his chin with the end of his pen pensively. “He needs some practice playing in a team, and his defence is shit. His passes and shots are decent. He is shorter than me so that limits him a bit.” He stopped his tapping and glanced at Harry. “We will have a practice match with Rosenberg in November. Why don’t you drop by?”
While they waited for the professor, Harry tried — and failed — to forget the way the blond's skinny jeans wrapped around his slender legs.
Their eye contact didn't last long because Snape chose that moment to call for a quick pre-match meeting with the players.
After the dinner feast, there was a gigantic cake that they made Harry cut and distribute to the guests. Years being in the public eye had taught him to treat everyone amiably, to put on a mask even when all he wanted was to hide. He felt he did a great job at hiding his despair.
Draco’s arm automatically swung to his left. His sharp elbow would have impaled Blaise’s face if the latter hadn’t leapt back in time. The dark-skinned man landed on his feet soundlessly, blue robes billowing around him. His Disillusionment Charm slipped off his frame like leaves falling in autumn.
"You can't see me, can you?" Harry murmured bleakly. "No, you refuse to. You always work hard for people to acknowledge your work and that's
The white peacock fan, open and large, shielded their heads from the rest of the room as they kissed.
“Harry Potter!” Professor Scrimgeour struck Draco’s table with his ruler, the loud noise making the young man wince. “Move it, lad!”
So instead they spent time outside of classes, working on assignments or homework. Sometimes they even grabbed lunch together, just the two of them.
Having secured their lead, Snape ordered the team to focus on defence, but this change in tactic didn’t alter Draco’s plans for the last few minutes. When his team next took the offence, Draco saw more gaps in Rosenberg’s defences.
Due to his sheltered upbringing, Draco was socially awkward. He acted confident and cocky in front of others, but alone with Harry, he was anxious, shy and spoke a mile a minute whenever he was excited.
As they left their jackets by the front door, walked up the stairs and into his bedroom, Draco felt Harry’s intense gaze never leaving him.
Draco’s lips are soft and sweet; they tremble slightly as Harry tenderly sucks Draco’s bottom lip between his own. They part willingly and beautifully when Harry coaxes them open, a groan escaping from deep within Draco’s throat.
Draco’s body shuddered with laughter as Potter rolled on top of him. The cloak cascaded down Potter’s head and Draco’s fingers brushed its velvety texture while they kissed under its cover.
“Would you like some tea?” he asked, placing a tray on the coffee table. On it were a teapot and two cups. He gestured for Draco to move, and as soon as Draco sat up, Potter plopped down next to him.
Draco felt a tentative hand rest on his lower back, the simple touch sending a nice tingle up his spine. “You like how I turned out?” Harry’s words were teasing but his voice quivered just slightly.
"I have faith in you, Auror Potter, Auror Malfoy." This was her last message before the Floo call ended.
“The people at MAD sent this to my department last month,” Draco explained. “My senior colleagues knew right away that this sphere was previously used by Dark Wizards in the seventh century to extract a person’s soul from their body, basically leaving behind an empty shell.”
“What kind of pub night guest would I be if I order pumpkin juice while you hooligans drink whatever mind-numbing beverage you all like to consume?”
Every Friday evening, Harry Potter gave duelling lessons to Junior Aurors in the training arena. It was one of the few times Draco still witnessed Harry using his wand to cast simple defensive spells and hexes. Harry had said that it was better to lead by example, and casting wandlessly wasn’t going to help the younger Aurors learn. Harry’s ability to channel his magic through his own body was poorly understood even by Harry himself — he mostly operated on instinct — so wandless magic wasn’t something he was confident in teaching others.
Harry returns with his own stare. “Your captain claims to be carrying the most precious cargo in the galaxy. The Federation has failed to inform me what.”
He stays like this even through lunch, not bothering to move when a Hogwarts elf appears and presents them with a tray of food. He doesn't want to let Draco go, as if he is the one with the need for Draco’s body heat instead of the other way around.
“Yes, Thankfully, the ingredients for the antidote are much easier to procure. I have them all in my shop. I’ll owl you when I’m done.”
He hadn't had to wake Potter up for two nights in a row now, but it was too early to feel complacent. Nightmares loved giving a false sense of security and appearing again when the victim least expected it.
"I, uh, I don't mind," Harry stammers. "And you are, you know. Hot. Both in the fever sense and the… other sense."
"So let's put this behind us. I forgive you. I know it's not easy, but, we can start over if you want."
"My feelings towards him are… complicated." Harry glanced behind him nervously, but Draco was reading on the couch, not hearing a word thanks to Harry's strong Silencing Charm. After Healer Kim's warning, they had agreed not to separate unless for toilet breaks and showers.
“Whenever you receive the ball, you always hold it between your hands before you do anything with it. You waste a few milliseconds, giving time for your opponent to get closer to you to block you. In volleyball, we never really hold the ball once it’s in play; we just divert it elsewhere.”
Harry felt warmth exude his entire body as he walked over and pulled Draco into a tight embrace. He pressed his nose against the side of his neck, inhaling his scent like a starving man. “Fuck, Draco. I’m so glad you’re back.”
After promising to owl some snacks and give Hermione Harry’s regards, Ron ended the Floo call. Harry spelled away the Silencing Charm but stayed by the fireplace to collect his thoughts. Against his better judgement, he quietly turned his body so that he faced Malfoy at the writing desk. The scratch of Malfoy’s quill against parchment served as background noise as Harry watched Malfoy work, something he had done many times in their own office.
Harry didn't move from his spot, shuffling his feet instead. "So, um, what do you want for dinner? I saw fresh tomatoes and, ah, I can make pasta for us, if you, er, eat pasta, or you can choose something else
Then they never spoke to each other for years. Draco had been stuck with a horrible partner for two years before Potter entered his life again. As annoying as his carelessness was, Potter was a great partner. He was a natural leader who listened to others. His magic, wild and powerful, inspired both awe and fear in those who witnessed it.
This was exactly what Draco had been afraid of. He hid in Grimmauld Place with Kreacher keeping him company. He worried about his parents. He was sure they would receive their fair share of Howlers as well. He prayed that his Father was strong enough to maintain the wards. He had no way of going to Malfoy Manor. He could not Apparate out of Grimmauld Place. He could not Floo: Minister Shacklebolt had cut off Harry’s Floo connection mere minutes after the story broke out, not wanting to risk dangerous people or cursed items intending to harm Draco sneaking through the Floo system.
"Tomorrow," Malfoy croaks hesitantly. "Come to my flat tomorrow. I'll make you dinner, and then you can stay over."
There were so many questions, but they were for another time. Tonight, they explored each other's bodies.
“Don’t do that!” Draco yelled irritably. Blaise knew perfectly well how much Draco hated being caught off-guard. They were supposed to be
Oh, right. Harry had slept through the night. He tried to remember if he had any nightmares. Perhaps he did since he could feel that familiar throb in the back of his head that he always had whenever he had a restless sleep, but he couldn’t recall exactly what it was. Which, Harry supposed, was what dreams were supposed to be like.
His anxiety skyrocketed when Harry removed his glasses, pocketed them and slid on a pair of sporty-looking sunglasses. The lenses were translucent grey, hiding his green eyes. He looked different. He looked… what? Handsome? Attractive?
At the Burrow, Arthur had set up tents outside the house. Harry had dropped by and offered to help Ron with the decorations but he kept thinking about how Draco wouldn't even be at the party, so he was distracted and wasn't very efficient. Even Ron lost patience with him and told him to leave the tasks to other people.
Draco looked over his shoulder briskly. He appeared taken aback to see Harry, but he quickly recovered and whispered to the brown-haired player beside him, "Theo, cover me." Then he swung both his legs over the bench as he spun around until his body faced away from the court, facing Harry.
By some miracle, Harry recognised Draco’s address, so he didn’t need Draco guiding him at every turn. Draco was grateful because he doubted he could speak with the helmet around his head. He prayed that Harry couldn’t hear him whimper and yelp every time the motorcycle picked up speed or turned a sharp corner. Draco kept his arms tightly wound around Harry’s torso, not daring to move lest he’d fall.
“A place where souls transit between life and death,” Draco replied, not having to shout now that they were within arm's length. “Some people call this place Bardo.”
Draco stayed awake until he felt the bed dip with Potter's weight. Draco remained on his side, facing away.
“If you want to shoot it, you have twenty seconds to do so, Captain Potter,” Draco says. “I suggest you make haste before its friends get any closer.”
"You've apologized for that already. I've forgiven you!" Draco's voice rose shakily. "That has been enough for me."
Draco was relieved to find the wards still intact. Jumpy was confused to see them but let them in, stating that his parents were asleep. Jumpy took their jackets and showed them to Draco’s old room. Upon reaching the doors, Narcissa rounded the corner and hurried towards his son.
to land so many three-pointers; they were already leading. But Draco had a feeling Davies was allowing this for his sake.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Malfoy said before biting into another scone. “They purposely forgo doors, and yet still leave windows? I bet there’s a spell on them that kills anyone that goes through.”
“And has it ever occurred to you,” Harry counters, just as icily, “that without my protection, should enemies attack your ship to get to this cargo, your defenceless ship will be flattened like a pancake sooner than it takes for you to blink?”
Harry glanced at his watch. The party was supposed to go on until midnight; it was barely ten o'clock. "I'm alright. Besides, I don't want to leave my own birthday party early."
“I was looking for ingredients to make our own lube,” Draco confessed, giggling. “It was supposed to be a surprise. That’s why I panicked.”
In the lab itself are four scientists, all donning the Starfleet Federation uniform. One is a woman with large bushy hair secured under a white surgical cap. One man has dark flowy hair pulled into a ponytail. The other two scientists are twins with pretty chocolate brown skin, a shade fairer than Harry’s. They glance up, nod at Draco and immediately go back to bending over their petri dishes and microscopes, ignoring the guests.
Paparazzi catching Harry Potter in front of Draco Malfoy's flat building is the exact kind of scandal they wanted to avoid.
Potter's smile widened as he looked at Draco and nodded. He drank the milk in one go and beamed at Draco again once he was done. "Thanks, Malfoy," he said, putting the glass and his spectacles on the bedside table.
Potter was like an addictive potion. If you’d never had it, you could live and die happily, not knowing what you had missed. But once you get a taste, you’d want more and more and yet, it’d never be enough.
With a small squeak of excitement and relief, Draco grabbed the medallion with both hands. It was still connected to a chain around Harry’s neck, so Draco stood close to the Auror as he ran his fingers over the jade stone.
“No! No,” Harry said quickly, dropping onto the stool next to the telephone. His glasses slipped down his nose so he hastily pushed them back up. “I’m glad you called. How are you?”
Like a recurring nightmare, Draco found his shots being blocked time and time again. It was as if all his training the past month had evaporated due to his internal rage. They ended the first quarter lagging behind in scores.
“You are in no state to Apparate, and neither am I,” Harry commented. “Come on, I know a great coffee place not too far from here.”
“Not in front of my parents!” he exclaimed, cheeks pink. His platinum-blond hair swayed with the wind and he looked mesmerizing.
Harry smiled. “It’s fine. You can ask me anything.” He pulled himself back into a sitting position. “My adoptive dad is a high school teacher. He makes a decent wage but I don’t want to rely on him for everything. I try to save up money to buy my own things. I’ve been taking part-time jobs since high school.”
That night, an owl swooped in through his open bedroom window, dropped an envelope onto his desk and promptly flew out before Draco could even react.
“Ouch, that hurt my feelings,” Harry remarked, grinning. He drew himself closer and asked in a low voice, “What were you expecting?”
Draco was not the only one who got scolded. Weasley was told his "footwork was sloppy" and Theo apparently played like "a constipated corpse". Several players, including Greg and Blaise, were completely ignored during this briefing; Snape must have been happy with them.
But just like Blaise had foreseen, they learned from their mistakes and adjusted their speed accordingly. Draco never held the ball for longer than a second, instead swiftly diverting and redirecting it to his teammates. There was no room for hesitation or indecision. More and more, Draco’s touch passes assisted his team to score. By the fourth quarter, they had already surpassed Rosenberg’s score and taken a twelve-point lead. Rosenberg hadn’t managed to score a single point in the second half.
Now as a man, Malfoy was nothing like when he was a teenager. In fact, ever since becoming an Auror, Malfoy kept mostly to himself. He was passive during managerial meetings but diligent and brilliant when it came to actual Auror work. He never joined social gatherings at the office. He kept quiet whenever people called him ‘
“Has it occurred to you that perhaps,” –Zabini’s expression is as icy as steel— “the Federation does not deem you trustworthy enough to be privy to this information?”
Draco watched him go, thinking how yes, he would absolutely like to meet Harry outside of class again.
"I ask that you two keep monitoring each other. If one of you loses consciousness and doesn't respond to call or pain, quickly come through this Floo like I've told you."
Malfoy’s cheeks and nose are adorably pink, his eyes half-lidded and drowsy while hot puffs of air escape his parted pale lips in short bursts. Droplets of sweat perch on his forehead and eyebrows while his platinum blond hair is more tousled than Harry has ever seen it.
he demanded, wiping his face with his sleeve, which did not help much since his T-shirt was soaked too. Draco then realised that Potter was only wearing a thin white T-shirt, which was now practically transparent and clinging to his body, and a pair of black pants.
“We were waiting for you at Grimmauld Place, mate, with ‘welcome home’ cakes and everything,” said Ron, rolling his eyes. “I should have guessed you’d be here instead.”
“There you are!” she exclaimed. “Blaise called. They’re coming over for dinner. I’m ordering steak. You eat steak, right? And who’s this?”
Ron watched his best friend stare forlornly at the table for several minutes before he threw his hands up and sighed dramatically. “Fine! I’ll keep an eye on him for you.” When Harry’s face broke into a grin, Ron pointed a warning finger at him. “But I’m not playing wingman or matchmaker. Go woo him yourself.”
They sit together in silence for a while. Harry suspects that Malfoy can hear his loud heartbeats but neither says anything. At some point, Harry stops touching Malfoy's jaw and moves on to idly play with his blond hair. To his pleasant surprise, Malfoy lets him do it without any complaints.
Hermione, an Unspeakable herself, had a theory that the problem lied in their inability to communicate effectively. Harry was notoriously bad with words while Draco became quiet and subdued after the trials and induction into the Department of Mysteries.
Draco sighed. “I don’t like the effect of alcohol on me. I lose my rationality quickly. I say stupid things. I do not remember what I do when I’m under the influence. It’s very unpleasant. I don’t know why other people do it, but hey, who am I to judge what other people do in their spare time?” he said with a big shrug.
Draco shrugged flippantly and rested his elbows on the now-empty table, purposely avoiding looking at Harry.
There was always something missing, wasn’t there? With Malfoy. As though Harry desperately wanted something - for him, from him,
After the Battle of Hogwarts, the administration wanted to ensure the returning students would continue their education feeling secure and safe in all aspects. Thus, at the beginning of term, staff noticed a new door next to the Infirmary. The door, the Headmistress explained during the welcoming feast, led to the offices of two Mind Healers, Healer Park and Healer Algot.
“I have… there’s something… someone I want,” he found himself saying. Perhaps it was the alcohol in his system loosening his tongue. He would never have admitted this to Ron otherwise. “It feels selfish… to want him so much.”
When Harry returned after using the loo, Malfoy was still removing clothes from his briefcase. He stood awkwardly for what felt like a minute as he watched Malfoy unpack.
Potter didn’t wait for any reply. He just smiled and kissed Draco's knuckles before entering his Healer's office.
When Harry sees on the staff notice board that he is scheduled to chaperone the students to Hogsmeade this weekend, he is excited. A big grin appears on his face. He goes to the Great Hall for lunch with a barely concealed spring in his step.
“You did, but you still feel guilty about it,” Ron pointed out, and the statement hit Harry like a punch to the gut. “Tell me, Harry. What was your nightmare last night about?”
“Er, I panicked,” Harry admits, searching for more appropriate places to put his hands. Eventually, he just flops one arm against the mattress while keeping the other at his side, unintentionally trapping Malfoy’s arm between Harry’s flank and elbow. He still doesn't trust himself to lay his hands on Malfoy, especially not when they are this close physically. “Are you still feeling cold?”
Then he envisioned himself snug in Harry's arms, his back against Harry’s wide chest, Harry's nose nuzzling his neck, and his own pale hands stroking Harry's chiselled, tanned forearms.
Fantasising about it was one thing; hearing Harry express it while they were both in bed and one of them shirtless was another, and Draco was not ready for the latter. He opened his mouth but failed to string any words together because,
The Aurors apprehended Mrs Kelley’s assistant, who had swapped her regular dose of Anti-Aging Potion with the poison. None the wiser, Mrs Kelley had poured the poison into her own tea. Thanks to Draco’s brewing, the antidote was ready in less than twenty-four hours and she soon regained all her magic and former strength.
The following Friday evening, after the last student has filed out, Harry hastily casts cleaning spells around the classroom, sending chairs tucked into desks and loose pieces of parchment flying into a dustbin. He then hurries to his quarters to freshen up and change.
Potter apologised again for having nightmares but was tight-lipped about discussing it further. Draco continued his work on their case report while Potter wrote letters to his godson and friends on the couch. From time to time, Draco asked Potter to confirm details about the case, but the day was as uneventful as quarantines went.
“You’re a Potions Master!” Madam Pomfrey exclaims. “You’re expected to be wary when taking medicinal potions for the first time.”
Draco smiled when he was served plain bread and sausages, thanked Harry and ate without any complaints.
Harry carefully extracted the beverage from his roommate's hand and put both bottles away. He then wrapped an arm around Draco's torso.
“Do you want dinner?” Harry asks, still touching Malfoy’s face. He notices then that Malfoy’s voice has returned to normal and he doesn’t sound like he has a blocked nose anymore.
“I’m not obsessed,” said Harry weakly, but even he knew that wasn’t the truth. Ever since he got promoted, Ron had been giving out these mature, crazily insightful pieces of advice that always drove Harry insane.
Draco stood frozen for a good five minutes before he finally went into the other office and took his usual seat on the sofa opposite Healer Park.
“I know it can be distressing to be in isolation like this, so please look out for each other. Find time to chat with your friends and families. I believe you should still be able to call your DMLE owls from there. I made sure Head Auror Robards enabled that. And oh! One last thing. Please stand back!"
“I can’t imagine being trapped in this place alone,” Harry remarked as they lounged on the couch. Glancing at the open window, a thought dawned on him. “Hey. Do you think we can climb out the window?”
Greg slapped the jump ball towards Draco. Instead of grabbing it with both hands, like what Harry said he did, he stopped the ball’s trajectory with one hand, promptly flicked his wrist and pushed the ball towards Blaise. Before Rosenberg knew what was happening, Blaise had already launched the ball through their hoop.
A moan escaped Draco’s throat; he was so embarrassed he almost broke the kiss, but the sound roused something ferocious inside Harry; he forcefully backed Draco against his bedroom door and deepened their kiss.
in love with him!” Draco denied helplessly, which earned a laugh from Blaise. Sighing, he slowly fanned himself as he continued observing Harry. “I can’t. Aurors aren’t allowed to have romantic relationships with their partners.”
Draco was a nervous wreck. He practically turned Harry’s wardrobe upside down in search of the perfect dress robe, which of course never existed, and definitely not in Harry’s closet. They went to Diagon Alley under glamour and returned home with more articles of clothing Harry could count.
“Britain didn’t join the World Cup in 1877," said Harry, who was rather proud of his knowledge on Quidditch trivia.
with four times the firepower. Harry doubts the science spaceship could haul his battleship across the galaxy, but Draco seems confident in what he’s doing, so Harry stands back and observes.
Greg got the rebound and dunked the ball through the hoop. They scored two points, but Draco tasted bitterness in his mouth.
Harry felt an invisible weight lift off his shoulders while another, newer and more hopeful, sensation settled in his stomach. "Then let's make sure we make this work," he said resolutely. "It takes effort from both of us. We have to try."
said Granger, sounding unconvinced, “but you don’t know when you might develop severe symptoms, like extreme fatigue, confusion, memory loss
At the party, Harry plastered on a smile and greeted everyone. Hermione had invited all Gryffindors in their year plus several Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaw they knew. He recognised people from other years as well, probably friends of Ginny and Luna.
But this was his first time playing in a team and with actual opponents. Much to his chagrin, his lack of experience quickly showed.
Draco ignored his friend, determined to try again. He swivelled around Theo and dribbled until he was close enough for another shot.
“You’re warm,” Malfoy whispers curtly, and that is the only answer Harry gets before Madam Pomfrey arrives.
The plan worked out rather well, if the sack around Harry’s head and the Full Body-Bind Curse he was under were any indication.
Captain Malfoy’s face appears on the screen, face lit with red light. “We are being attacked by Krurian vessels,” he says urgently. “Are we ready to jump?”
Harry felt a strong gust of wind blow against his face. When he looked back, there was a red bubble around Draco's head. The bubble looked different from the usual Bubble-Head Charm, which simply allowed a person to breathe normally. This red bubble appeared to be actively
Malfoy ignores the question. “Is that why you brought me to this place? Because the hotels we always go to don't allow smoking?”
“Yes. We managed to control the infection before it got too severe,” the Healer jumped in before Robards could answer. She stepped forward, pushing her thick-rimmed glasses up her nose and smiled at her two patients. Her long raven hair was pulled back into a ponytail. “I’m Healer Kim. As both of you know, spattergroit is very contagious. That’s why we are wearing Protective Bubble-Body Charms. These are full-body and stronger versions of the Bubble-Head Charm,” she explained, gesturing at the blue bubble-thing. “Both of you were infected by the same strain, so you don’t need the Bubble Charm around each other. Anyone else, however, is vulnerable to catch the infection from you. We were discussing with Auror Potter about your treatment options.
The room was large, capable of fitting more than a hundred students, with tiered seating structured in a semi-circle surrounding a pitched floor, where the lecturer's desk and blackboards were located. Ron and Hermione had chosen seats in the middle of the hall, leaving an empty space between them for Harry.
“Now,” Captain Malfoy begins, facing Harry completely, “tell me about your crew, your ship and how you plan on protecting my ship.”
"I don't think he likes me very much either,” Draco commented, recalling his coach’s perpetual scowl whenever he looked at him.
"See that writing desk over there? Open the drawer. There should be two green bags with St Mungo's name and logo embroidered on it. Yes, that's correct, Auror Malfoy. Please bring them back here."
In the kitchen, Harry realised that they had not cleared up where Harry would sleep. Since Malfoy had quickly claimed the bed, Harry assumed he would be taking the couch. That would probably be best. Malfoy had been Harry’s partner for only six months, but Harry knew that Malfoy could be nasty when he was angry. His silent treatments were terrible too. Harry was always left wondering what he had done wrong. He hadn’t figured out how to handle a silently seething Draco Malfoy yet. So far, the only thing that had worked for Harry was to keep being nice to Malfoy until he cooled down on his own.
"No. Don't make me leave. I do like you," Harry blurts out, tightening his grip on Malfoy's shoulders. "Regardless of whether it's convenient or not. I actually wanted to tell you this at Hogsmeade, but—”
Ron sighed, seeing right through the lie. “You still have unfinished business with him, Harry. I’ve tried suggesting to Robards to have you two be isolated separately, but he kept going on about saving resources and respecting the advice of St Mungo’s healers.” He took a deep breath before continuing. “Look, I am speaking as both a friend and your Deputy Head: take the time to get to know him. Since there is no escaping this, maybe it is finally time to confront the root cause of your nightmares. Maybe there’s a reason why you’ve always been
The devastated expression that crossed Potter’s face made him shut his mouth. Potter closed the bathroom door behind him without replying. They tacitly agreed that it was too late for this conversation.
Later, once the lights were out and they were lying side by side, Potter asked, "Did this help you with your nightmares?"
After a few more kisses, Harry decided he had held Draco hostage long enough. Harry lengthened the chain around his neck so that it could loop around Draco's neck as well as his own. With Draco's help, he rotated the jade stone a few times before pressing it firmly.
“One day, I’ll take pleasure in proving you wrong.” Harry’s gaze flickered to the side and lingered on Draco’s left ear before he sat back. “I work part-time at a grocery store after classes. I can take time-off on Thursday.”
A grimace flits across Malfoy’s pale face. “I think you should leave," he croaks weakly. He attempts to move away but is stopped by Harry's hands on his shoulders. He is still warm but not as bad as the day before.
at flirting. He had never done it before, let alone with another bloke. His attempts mostly involved him being unapologetically honest and generous with his compliments. Although Draco never verbally acknowledged his teasings, his body language — the pink tint of blush on pale skin, the twinkle in silver eyes and the tiny smile tugging his lips — always spoke volumes.
Two days later, the photograph of them kissing was featured on the Daily Prophet and it was a nightmare.
"It's faster if you come with me. There’s a special room near the Potions Damage ward I can Apparate to." Harry nodded at his outstretched hand, getting impatient. "Trust me."
"Is that what I think it is?" asked Harry when Malfoy opened the briefcase and showed him the contents. It was paperwork for the case they had just solved, the one that had started this entire fiasco. "Merlin, I was just thinking yesterday of taking a break from work."
Draco slowly slid his arms around Harry’s chest, the action bringing him close enough to brush his lips against Harry’s ear and he whispered, “Teach me how to be as fast as you, jump as high as you and last as long as you.”
Healer Kim raised an eyebrow. “We don’t usually let non-family members room in with patients, but I don’t mind. If anybody questions it, I’ll just say your name.”
Potter brought him to a fancy Muggle restaurant, which served juicy steak and excellent red wine. Afterwards, Draco tasted this wine again when they kissed in the hallway of Grimmauld Place.
“It was.” Harry grimaced. “I’m glad you weren’t there. They were awful. They didn’t listen to a word I said. Ron had to give them a stern scolding before they shut up. Even Hermione gave them a piece of her mind.”
Draco hoped he didn’t sound too eager when he agreed after rechecking his schedule. “Sure, I don’t have anything planned that weekend. What time is your game again?”
Draco couldn’t remember what classes Harry had that day, and the idea of peeking into every lecture hall in Business School in search of the bespectacled boy was too daunting for him. He didn’t even see him during lunch.
“What? Why not?” Harry demands, affronted. “You’re sick! I want to take care of you!” Because that's what friends do. To their friends. Regardless of other potentially more-than-friendly feelings one might have for the other.
Afterwards, Davies sent more opportunities for Draco to score three-pointers. Every successful shot further widened the gap between their scores. They didn’t
After experimenting at the hospital, they had discovered that if Harry phrased his sentences into questions, the potion wouldn’t kick in and he could say what he wanted. “What do you want to do now?” he asked.
Teddy watches Draco’s nimble fingers work, entranced. Uncle Harry is just as silent and probably just as mesmerized.
"I'm not angry at you anymore," Draco said, which was a half-lie. He might feel better in the morning but right now he desperately wanted to go back to sleep. "Come on, let's sleep in the bedroom. At least if you have a nightmare again, I don't have to get out of bed to kick you awake."
“Hm, no?” Draco lied, smirking as he signalled for Harry to put the plate away. Harry didn’t need to see the glint in his grey eyes to tell Draco was feeling mischievous.
Harry glanced at the red glow of the medallion around his neck and pulled his stool closer to the other man. "Draco, we need to talk."
Feeling sheepish, Harry walks to the doors. Before he steps out, he turns around. “When can I see you again?”
“Jumps?” Harry repeats bemusedly. He is saved from making a fool of himself when the door opens and in walks Draco Malfoy, now with his face clear of any dirt.
As soon as Draco flops onto the Captain's Chair, a hologram panel appears in front of him. There are no seats for Harry, so he stands next to Draco. Seamus and Dean flank the door.
Harry never figured out what Malfoy meant by that, but he became obsessed with seeing that smile again.
“Hey, I’m not saying I won’t help you,” Blaise clarified, raising both hands in surrender. “I can drop you off, but I promised my mom I’m visiting her tomorrow afternoon so you’ll have to find a ride home yourself.”
Draco embodied at least a dozen contradictions but was unaware of all of them. He was a son so lonely and severely overshadowed by his father that he struggled to see his own value.
He had taken one look at Harry — old sneakers, jeans ripped at the knees, plain T-shirt, messy black hair and round-rimmed glasses — and walked across the room (
Draco gasped when Harry’s hand ventured lower. “Really, Harry? We’re doing this in my parents’ house?”
Draco believed that in the future, people would grow tired of them and leave them alone. Everyone would have to live with the fact that the Saviour of the wizarding world was already taken and off the market. They would let them live their lives.
Potter automatically reached up to touch his own forehead, where his lightning bolt scar was partly hidden by his fringe.
“I like you, Potter,” said Draco firmly, hands trembling in his pockets. “I mean, not in a platonic way. I mean in a romantic way. I think you’re kind, humble and really nice to people, especially to me. You’re also pretty handsome and have… well-defined lower limbs.”
By Healer Kim's orders, they drank the yellow potion in front of her. It tasted sour, like freshly squeezed lemons.
“Mother,” Draco muttered, waiting for her to blow her nose and look at him. “There’s something I need to tell you, about me and Harry…”
Harry had been feeling sombre and guilty over the apothecary accident, but Draco had been nothing but gentle with him since they got back. And now, as Draco closed his mouth over a piece of chicken, pulled it off Harry’s fork and moaned in satisfaction as he chewed, Harry felt his cheeks getting warm.
Harry rolled his eyes while he pulled on a white shirt. “For God’s sake.” He pushed wet bangs up his head, shoved a pair of round-rimmed spectacles onto his face and grabbed his backpack. As he leaped down the staircase, he glanced at his wristwatch and grumbled about how they weren’t even
“Thought you’d like a change of scenery,” Harry jokes, earning himself a playful smack on the shoulder. “Seriously, the reporters have gotten wind of our usual rendezvous spots. We need to find other places.” The trouble Harry went through to cast privacy charms on the entire building and make sure they are robust and good enough deserves its own chapter in an Advanced Charms textbook.
Draco appears amused. He places both palms on the carpet and regards Teddy fondly. “What do you like about dragons?”
Healer Kim nodded grimly. "I actually considered taking you to St Mungo’s to be monitored but we are short of resources at the moment. Our other patients are critically ill. I cannot justify using up two valuable isolation rooms for something that might not even happen. Remember, this is a new discovery. The fungus has a property that can cause these symptoms. There has been no real-world evidence it can happen to anyone who inhaled the spores."
“I didn’t want to be late for our date.” Draco stands up, pulling his cloak tighter around him. It is still winter and even though the Entrance Hall is laced with a dozen Warming Charms, Harry knows it’ll be freezing once they step outside.
He casts his own Warming Charm on Draco’s cloak, making the other wizard gasp when Harry’s magic sweeps over him.
With nothing in the way, Draco drank in the deep green of Harry’s eyes and the heated desire in them. Harry’s hands were sliding up his spine and around his waist, bringing their bodies even closer still, and Draco’s brain practically melted because he had spent the entire day fantasizing about being in Harry’s arms and here he was.
They rarely talked about the war now. Draco had apologised to Potter and his friends many years ago, during their first year of Auror training. Shortly after, Potter had pulled him aside in private during one of their Auror training camps and apologised about the bathroom incident in sixth year. He had claimed it was the worst thing he had ever done.
One day, while playing with his stuffed baby dragon in the sitting room, Teddy overhears Uncle Harry talking to Grandma in the hallway.
As soon as he, Neville and the students return to Hogwarts, Harry goes straight down to the dungeons and to the Potions classroom.
“Car accident,” he answered curtly. He took a deep breath before changing the subject from his deceased parents to his existing ones. “You know, Remus and Sirius… I am their son. They are my parents, for all intents and purposes. What do you think about that?”
Harry had promised himself that this would be his last mission with Draco. Because after years of flirting and dancing around each other, Harry was going to confess following the completion of this mission. And then, regardless of Draco's response, they would have to be separated and assigned new partners because of some Auror policy Harry had never cared for until he started developing feelings for his partner.
When he reached Draco, he eyed his white-blond hair briefly before reading out from the list, “Draco Malfoy?”
“You disappoint me, Ron Weasley,” Harry hissed back. They were both sitting at the dining table, pens and open books between them. While Ron had been peeved at how they were given homework on the first
Laughing, Harry draws Draco closer. They sprawl together on the sofa, arms around each other. In his mind, Harry counts down the hours until Draco will be free of the potion side effects, and when they can start properly exploring their new relationship.
“No,” Malfoy answered. “Before you suspect me of dosing your milk with a potion or something, I assure you I did no such thing.”
Draco stumbled and caught himself on Harry’s arm. He knew that he should have stepped away immediately, but something in Harry’s gaze made him pause. The intense way he looked down at Draco was alluring —  had his eyes always been this
And if by the end of the night, they left the bar together, hands interlocked, no-one commented on it.
Draco didn’t understand why Harry found this so incredulous. “I have friends who can drive. And I can walk.”
With a big smile, Potter waved at him before Apparating. Draco swore that man had no idea how attractive he was. He should stop smiling all the time. It gave Draco funny sensations in his stomach.
Draco leant above the bubbling potion, frowning at the pink colour. It had been five hours and five minutes since he added the Moondew, and it was supposed to have turned a deep red by now… A sudden bang, followed by the shrill sound of the jangling of the doorbell, made him look up in alarm.
“No.” Harry wandlessly sends the cigar to an ashtray and casts Stasis on it. “I picked this flavour.”
Harry was not the tallest player in his team, but he was undeniably the fastest and the most mesmerizing to watch.
When Harry returns to The Second Cockpit with Draco this time around, the navigation and communication stations are manned by Draco’s officers, who turn out to be the same people who were in the laboratory, the ones Harry had mistaken for scientists.
Later that evening, after making sure Pansy had left, he Floo'ed to Grimmauld Place. The Wizarding Home recognized his blood and connection to its Master, and so allowed him in. This display of sentience and acceptance by the house always made him feel welcomed, more so than his own boring flat.
After a short pause, Draco turns to face Harry and pulls on his hand, sending Harry reeling forward.
Draco’s eyes flickered over Harry’s face for a second before he dropped his gaze. “It’s my job to figure out how it works. I managed to dismantle it. See these cracks?” He pointed at the lines over the sphere, careful not to touch it. “I was able to decode the spell inside it, layer by layer, until I reached the key inside. When I touched it with my magic, I blacked out and woke up here.”
It was bright out, but she tucked him under the covers. She lied down next to him. "Darling, we are going to fix this, okay?"
As expected, Davies was the most reluctant. “That’s an advanced technique, Malfoy. We’ve never tried it during practice. We might screw up badly.”
Harry's eyes were fixated on Draco. This was his first time seeing Draco in his official sleeveless basketball jersey and shorts, and the sight made Harry breathless. Draco's pale skin matched so well with the dark green colour. His arms and legs were wrapped with lean muscles. His blond hair was tied back neatly, away from his face, and Harry could see his black earring from afar.
Malfoy’s feverish heat blazes over Harry, who feels obligated to point out the obvious. “You’re hugging me.”
Sirius released Draco’s hand and shrugged. “Not very well. Your mother and I are distant cousins, though. How is Narcissa?”
Before they left, Narcissa wrapped a dark purple scarf around Harry’s neck. “A gift from me, Mr Potter. It used to be my honour of being the one to make my son smile, but after the war, after our mistakes, I believe that honour now has been transferred to you.”
“Hi,” the other student greeted, smiling. He placed an elbow on the table and rested his head on his palm, all the while not taking his green eyes off of Draco. “I’m Harry Potter. You?”
angry,” said Malfoy. “I hate that we’re infected with spattergroit. It’s a horrible ailment. Do you know about the Quidditch World Cup in 1877?”
As soon as Harry stood up, Draco clutched his arm and Apparated them both straight into his workroom.
That had been the correct thing to say, because Potter instantly grinned, as bright as sunshine. "Damn right you are!" He cleared his throat and tried to keep a straight face. "So is that why…you said you were glad I became your partner?"
. He bowed deeply at Draco, the tip of his nose touching his toes. "Kreacher would be honoured to be cooking for Mister Malfoy, descendant of the Noble House of Black. What would Mister Malfoy be wishing to eat?"
They had never kissed in public, not even in Muggle London. But today they did and they didn’t care.
So Draco showed him. He knew Potter learned best by doing. He even squeezed Potter's hand to show him how hard to grip his fists and how to relax them. Potter got it quickly, falling into a soothing rhythm of breathing in and out.
“Your dedication to following your father’s orders while also doing nothing is impeccable,” Draco said, smiling despite himself.
Draco, who had been awfully silent since they left the Manor, coughed. “You said… you said you love me.”
After lunch, Malfoy resumed his report-writing while Harry kept himself busy in the kitchens. Towards evening, Harry proudly presented Malfoy with a tray of English scones and more tea.
Harry reached inside his shirt and pulled out a silver medallion that fit nicely in his palm. At the centre of the medallion rested a small piece of jade stone, which now glowed red. Hermione had told him to wait until the stone turned green before attempting any more dimension-hopping.
Harry struggles to control his breathing; it is impossible to ignore the weight and feel of Malfoy’s head on his chest. “Why?”
Harry and Malfoy were paired up after Ron and Malfoy’s old partner both got promoted. Ron was promoted to Deputy Head while Malfoy’s previous partner got offered to head a new branch in Northern Ireland. On the first day of their partnership, he had jokingly said, “We’re the ones being left behind, aren’t we?”, expecting a scathing reply.
“I bet this is why you asked me to come with you,” the blond accused, sauntering over to Harry’s side and grabbing his forearm. “None of your teammates are as crazy as you.”
He quickly surveyed his surroundings. He was standing in a clearing in the middle of a vast field of yellow wheat. Earthy brown mountains lined the horizon, and a strong breeze chilled him down to his bones, despite his thick Auror uniform and robes. As he looked down to inspect his boots, he realised that his glasses had vanished, but his vision was perfectly clear.
"We’re under quarantine, not on a holiday," Malfoy reminded, closing the briefcase. "Don't worry, Potter. I'll handle this."
Draco’s joyful smile —directed solely at him— was the brightest and most beautiful sight Harry had ever seen.
“Oh,” Draco muttered, remembering that he had questions to ask Harry. “Why do you have a part-time job?”
“The old man forced me to join something.” Theo sounded bored, as though the very act of speaking about his father made him drowsy. “It was between being stuck here with you brats or with Vince in football. Basketball has fewer players on the court, so my chances of remaining on the bench are higher.”
“Although, there is one thing you can help me with,” Draco said, holding up a finger before rubbing it gently against Harry’s bottom lip.
They broke apart, gasping for air. Back still pressed against the door, Draco blinked at Harry, who appeared to be winded, eyes wide and licking his lips slowly, as though he couldn’t believe what had just happened.
Draco appeared to be taken aback to see Harry. He took a step back and would have fallen down the short flight of steps if Harry hadn’t grabbed his arm and hauled him inside.
Draco decided for him and sat on the bed, which was closer. Just being away from the living room calmed him down and this room, which smelled so much like Harry, made him comfortable. He caught sight of several photo frames on the bedside table. Between the photo of Harry with his two best friends and a photo of Harry with Remus and Sirius was a slightly discoloured photo of a man who looked like an older version of Harry and a beautiful woman with long ginger red hair.
If Auror Harry Potter had to describe his relationship with Unspeakable Draco Malfoy, seven years after the war, he would use the phrase "in limbo": neither here nor there. Frustratingly stuck somewhere between nothing and everything. Friends? Yes, but not really. Boyfriends? Maybe, but not quite. Perplexing? Absolutely.
He brought Potter to the university cafe where they sat on opposite sides of a small table. After their drinks arrived, Draco demanded to know why Potter was here.
Harry hears Draco locking the door as soon as Madam Pomfrey leaves. When he returns, he sits next to Harry on the sofa, his back rigidly straight and eyes avoiding Harry.
There, Potter did it again. Since they started regularly meeting up in private, Potter had been dropping hints that he couldn't wait to let everybody in the Wizarding World know about them. Draco, however, was still paranoid. Unlike Potter's, his reputation was far from good. His family name had been tarnished after the war and even though they managed to keep their riches, people didn't like to be associated with known Death Eaters. That was why Draco struggled to find a Wizarding job or a Potions apprenticeship until this day, and why he now mostly hid in the Muggle World.
One of the many lessons Lucius had taught Draco since a young age was the importance of making a good first impression on the people who mattered.
"Is he going to be alright?" Harry demanded, adrenaline still rushing through his veins. "He passed out right in front of me and I remember you said
“Unlike volleyball, Harry, basketball is a timed game. Each game is divided into 4 quarters; each quarter is 10 minutes. The team that scores the most points within that time limit wins the game. Any scores made from inside the three-point line,” she pointed at the wide semi-circle around each of the basket poles, “is worth two points while any shots made from outside the line are worth three.”
Harry brought his hands to his face, just to make sure. A finger graced his forehead and — his breath hitched — touched the smooth skin over the spot where his lightning bolt scar should have been.
When the dreaded day came, Draco dressed him up and managed to get them both ready and arrive at the Manor right on time. Narcissa Malfoy and a house elf named Jumpy greeted them at the front door. She hugged Draco tightly for a long time before wrapping Harry in a similar embrace, albeit more briefly.
“I thought you didn’t want to spend time with me outside of work.” Harry chuckled. “So all along, I could have just asked you out to dinner? I’m an idiot.”
but the event resulted in him receiving a letter from Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy, cordially inviting him to have lunch at their humble abode. Formal attire, please.
Draco slams into Harry’s side, snickering when Harry reels unstably and almost falls into the snow. They race to the gates, where they link their arms and Apparate together to Hogsmeade.
“I’m pleased to meet you again so soon,” Harry remarks sincerely as he and Draco walk side-by-side in the hallway. He isn’t sure where they are going but he follows his new companion readily, Dean and Seamus trailing after them several paces behind.
On the first day of the semester, Harry Potter had to be dragged out of bed by an irritated Ron Weasley. Being the last person to use the second floor bathroom, Harry bathed in cold water, teeth chattering as he quickly rubbed his body with soap. As he got dressed in his room, hair still dripping water onto his grey T-shirt and jeans, angry honks sounded from the street below his window.
It was unexpected how they both played different games and were marvellous players in their own right, but still managed to push each other up.
After a final review by Healer Kim, Draco was allowed to go home on a Friday evening. He and Harry stood outside St Mungo’s where it was drizzling. They had many things to do: work to catch up on, friends and families to update, letters to write and food to eat.
Potter’s cheeks went dark crimson in a split second, and he shyly avoided Draco’s eyes. “Hey, um, can I ask you something? How come you never join me when I invite you to pub nights?”
Just seconds before, the man was protesting like a child. Now he was looking at Draco so earnestly; it gave him whiplash. He avoided his partner’s gaze while he huffed, “I’m fine. What’s going on?”
"Draco darling," she said, rudely waving the Daily Prophet in front of his face while he ate. "You need to find something to do. Like a job. Otherwise you'd just waste away your days, pining for Potter."
Draco nodded. "I hope if I get that in my first year, my father will stop belittling my hobbies and let me do what I want. I mean,” he continued and started gesturing at the university building, “I'm already taking this programme because he wants me to. I’m getting sick of him controlling all facets of my life."
Then it was a repeat of yesterday’s questions and reminders. This time though, Potter remembered to enquire about the validity of Draco’s Quidditch World Cup story. Healer Kim confirmed that it did occur but refrained from commenting on the Ministry’s role in altering the official reports. “I’d like to keep my job, thanks!” she remarked cheerfully.
Potter was gazing at him with adoration and awe, a brilliant smile adorning his lips, not unlike how the real Potter looked at him. Then his mind moved from his imagination to memories, showing him flashes of Potter and the joy on his face whenever Draco showed up at his home, slept in his bed or woke up next to him in the morning.
“Did you notice the way her veins were turning green?” Harry asked. “It looked like, well, like the veins of a leaf.”
When they first kissed, they were completely sober. A gentle autumn breeze wafted through the open window. Harry was lying supine on Draco's bed with Draco leaning over him.
“Yes, so he doesn’t have any other options,” Madam Pomfrey declares, pointing a finger warningly at Harry. “I trust you to take care of him, Professor Potter. The potion will stay in his system for twenty-four hours at most. He will return to his normal self after that. His cold will be gone by then, too.”
Malfoy lifts his head and steps back but keeps his hands on Harry's sides. "Is this inconvenient for you, Potter?" he sobs.
“Potter." Draco unapologetically watched Harry bend over his duffle bag in search of dry clothes. "It's been seven years since the war. Are you still…”
"Clearly it's not enough for me!" Harry sat up. "It still tears me apart, how I could have… I could have killed you."
The days that followed were akin to a honeymoon. Being with Harry was exactly how one would imagine being with the Saviour of the Wizarding World would be like; he was passionate, loving and did nothing halfway. Since there was nothing much to do while trapped in a small house, most of their time was spent eating or reading. They also spent time talking either with each other or with their friends via Floo.
“You shouldn't have saved me,” Draco murmured one night, mouth pressed against Potter’s jugular as they both lay breathless, sweaty and sated. “You should have left me in the fire.”
“The public bus?” Harry’s eyes widened in disbelief as they both got to their feet. “You don’t… I mean, I expected you to have a fancy car or a chauffeur or something.”
When the door bursts open, a gust of hot steam blasts out and hits Harry in the face, fogging up his glasses. Before he regains his bearings, he feels a body slam into him and arms link around his waist. A sharp chin digs into his shoulder.
Draco cleared his throat, snapping Harry out of his reverie. “Do you want to stay here a little longer?”
A safe distance away, Draco sat on a bench with his back leaned against the wall, arms and legs crossed. His gaze was transfixed on Harry. Draco would never profess this out loud, but Harry was an excellent teacher. He had a stern, commanding presence but he was also gentle and patient.
After making sure no one was looking at them, Harry gently placed their joined hands on his right knee, keeping them clasped between them. He rubbed his thumb soothingly over Draco’s bony knuckles and fingers.
He was in the middle of another yawn when his shoulder bumped into something — someone, causing him to reel back and drop his backpack. There was a loud crashing of books on the floor, followed by a pained grunt and rustling of clothes. Startled, Harry blinked at the person he had bumped into, but could only see the top of his blond head as the other student bent down to collect his things.
"Too much all at once? I'm sorry," Harry apologised when Draco nodded. "Would you like to go up to my room? Get away from this for a bit?"
In exchange for tweaking the roster to Harry’s benefit, Luna made him perform all the heavy lifting duties for the day, while she worked on her friendship bracelets behind the till. From time to time, she would read aloud from a horoscope magazine, citing how Harry’s love life ‘is at a stalemate’ and ‘communication is key’. By the time his shift ended at 5 o’clock, Harry’s back hurt like a bitch, there was a blister forming on his left thumb and he had made a mental note to ask Draco his birthdate.
The briefing goes smoothly once the Captain gives full cooperation. Gone is the snide attitude. The Captain now regards Harry as an equal and an ally. Harry answers the Captain’s questions perfectly, with no stammer in his sentences.
Uncle Harry waits for a while before speaking. “There’s someone I want you to meet. He’s your family.”
"Malfoy, pass!" Weasley yelled from under the opponent's hoop. The defence was still running over so he was open.
There was a small gasp coming from Remus, and Sirius frowned, causing creases to appear on his forehead. “Are you related to Lucius Malfoy?”
Later that night, when they get into bed together, Malfoy tucks himself against Harry’s chest. "Goodnight, Potter," he mutters softly, bringing the blanket up to his shoulders.
He knew where Draco was. 'Iso ICU 6' meant 'intensive care unit, isolation wing, room 6', but no one could tell him what he needed to know. The Mediwitch who brought him his potions only said that Harry would be discharged on Day 14 of exposure. On the same day, Draco would be moved out of the isolation wing and to a general ward. Harry would be able to visit Draco there.
Soulmarks showed you who your magic was most compatible with. But they didn’t necessarily go both ways. The mark just implied that Draco’s magic was compatible with Potter’s, but Potter could have a different person altogether as his soulmate. Soulmates could range from romantic to platonic, strangers to enemies. This field of magic was poorly understood.
They had a belated birthday celebration for Sirius because Harry hadn’t been at their home on his real birthday. There was a vanilla sponge cake with blueberry filling and strawberry frosting which Draco and his sweet tooth loved but couldn’t eat too much of. Much to Draco’s quiet delight, Harry never left his side, always managing to place his hand either on Draco’s back, shoulder or arm.
Harry knew better than to argue. He followed Malfoy’s instructions, rested his head on the cushion on Malfoy’s lap and carefully pushed back his bangs without touching the pustule. He tried not to think of how close he was to Malfoy and was actually relieved when Malfoy took off his glasses and told him to close his eyes.
When the blond stood up, Harry clambered to his feet too. Harry’s heartbeats were still loud in his ears, so when the man spoke, he only caught the second half of his sentence, which was spoken in a posh and confident accent.
The first week of the semester had been exhausting, so when Draco suggested they order food for dinner, Harry happily dialled for pizza delivery. They sat on the floor, a large box of pepperoni pizza between them, as they talked.
Malfoy seems to enjoy Harry’s attention, often telling tall tales and giving lengthier explanations than necessary as if simply to keep Harry longer. They sit next to each other during meals, taunt each other whenever there is a quidditch match between Gryffindor and Slytherin and brag about how the students enjoy their respective classes more. Sometimes they even get so engrossed in their discussions that they don’t realise they have practically walked the other to class until they arrive in front of the DADA or Potions classroom.
They walked together, with Hermione leading the way because she was the only one out of the three who had studied the building's layout and knew where their first lecture was. Harry sleepily trailed behind his two best friends, backpack hanging from one shoulder.
They were to play three-on-three matches. “Half-court. Fifteen minutes time limit,” Snape explained. “Two points for any scores made inside the three-point line, and three points outside.”
"I didn’t want to tell you when you're sick," Harry explains. "It's not the right time, and the potion makes you do and say things you're embarrassed about. So I thought I'd wait until you get better and until the potion wears off."
Blaise, fortunately, was a more experienced player than Draco. Once Draco got over his ball-hogging, Blaise carried the team on his shoulders and dominated the game along with Greg. They had a lot of points to catch up on, thanks to Draco’s stubbornness in the first half.
Ron’s face fell. “I was worried about that. You've always wanted to get closer to Malfoy, but have you considered that spending more time with him than usual might trigger your nightmares?”
Harry pushed a large trolley filled with volleyballs to one of the courts. “I always practise whenever I can.”
“I feel fine,” Draco replies, a little surprised. His eyes dart momentarily toward Harry but then return to Madam Pomfrey.
An hour later, he jogs across the Entrance Hall, where Draco is seated on a stone bench near the large doors, arms and legs crossed.
“You’ve met my son,” he says in lieu of a greeting. He nods at Harry, a gesture Harry didn’t expect to come from the war-worn veteran. “He tells me to be kind to you.”
When Draco is done, the paper has taken the shape of a creature with wings, a long neck and a sharp beak. “This is a paper crane,” he explains, balancing the paper crane on one palm. “I can make it fly. Look.”
In his nightmares, Malfoy always looked so young, hair as pale as a fog; Harry could feel his trousers being soaked with Malfoy’s blood; He saw life vanishing from his grey eyes; He grabbed the sides of Malfoy’s head and cried and screamed and
Draco's hands fisted the edge of his jumper as he pulled himself out of the fantasy and met Harry’s gaze. “I suppose that’s wonderful for them. They look happy, after all,” he answered Harry's question, feeling disorientated. “They must have done a decent job as parents too. Look at how you turned out.”
Mrs Kelley was a stout, elderly lady with grey curls. The poison in her system had created streaks of what looked like moss and algae along her sickly grey skin. There had been a red bubble around her nose and mouth, helping her breathe. She had remained unconscious throughout their visit.
“Does this have anything to do with that Potter bloke?” Theo asked while munching. “The one who gave you advice during the Rosenberg game that basically won the match for us?”
But Harry could not have good things, apparently. Within a span of one day, he got them infected with a potentially dangerous fungus and trapped in a boring house in the middle of nowhere. It was all his fault.
Potter got into bed and wandlessly spelled the lights off, plunging the room into darkness. Usually, Malfoy would turn his body to the side, away from Potter, but this time he stayed on his back and waited until his eyes adjusted to the darkness before turning towards Potter. Potter sensed his movements and looked at him, even though Draco wasn't sure how well he could see without his spectacles.
The girl introduced herself as Hermione Granger, another one of Harry's best friends. Both of them appeared to have been expecting Draco, because as soon as he joined them, Granger ushered them into one of the large stadiums. They managed to secure front-row seats, with Granger sitting in between Weasley and Draco.
Draco couldn't count the number of times they dragged the other inside alcoves or empty classrooms for a snog. Potter’s lips were warm, delicious, sometimes even sweet. He kissed with a passion Draco envied, with his whole body leaning in and his hands all over Draco like a starving man.
This invited even more snide remarks from Smith. "Reduced to just passing now, are we? What would Mr Lucius Malfoy say?"
When it quickly becomes clear that Malfoy is too shocked to move, Harry steers him back to the sleeping area and to the wardrobe tucked in the corner.
“Yes,” Draco answered, surprised, a hand immediately going up to touch his left ear. “How’d you guess that?”
It takes them a week to finish one thousand multicoloured paper cranes. When Uncle Harry asks him for a wish, Teddy glances at both his godfather and Draco, who are sitting together with their clasped hands between them.
He hadn’t noticed that while he spoke, Potter had gently guided him inside and sat them both on the steps. Potter was silent as tears streaked down Draco’s face.
Daphne’s blue eyes brightened. “Oh yes! I do remember Dean inviting me, but I told him no, I’m not interested in sports.”
Harry looked at the bright side. At least they had two weeks of rest. As much as he loved his job, he had been pushing himself too hard lately. Ron and Hermione had been reminding him to take a break, but Harry frankly hadn’t seen the point. Why rest when he could help catch bad guys before they do bad things? Malfoy was just as much of a workaholic as him, so it felt natural. Harry loved working on cases. He loved to solve mysteries and help civilians. He loved them even more since being partnered with Malfoy. He loved watching Malfoy work.
inside. They found a utility room that had two large bags they were supposed to put their dirty laundry in. Lastly, they walked into the bedroom.
The court was surrounded by a green wire fence at least five metres high. Inside it, Draco’s blond hair appeared white under the evening sun as he bent down to pick up the basketball. His black T-shirt and tracksuit bottoms made his pale skin stand out much more prominently. His long hair had been tied back and somehow stayed against his scalp. He appeared to be alone; just him, the ball and the hoop.
Draco wheels toward Harry again. “Tell me more,” he implores, eyes curious and intrigued as he grips the front of Harry’s jumper, “about this alleged obsession you have towards me.”
He leaves Harry, Dean and Seamus in the hallway without any guards, but never lets them out of his sight even as he opens a private communication channel to – Harry hopes – Captain Malfoy.
His motorcycle glasses had rectangular frames that fit closely and snugly around his eyes and head. Harry didn’t like the way they looked on him; he had a soft spot for round-rimmed spectacles because those were the kind his father had worn in all his photographs.
Draco cast spells to lock his shop and switch the sign to Closed before lowering his wand and eyeing Harry's hand suspiciously. "I can Apparate to St Mungo’s myself."
“The pains of being a celebrity.” Malfoy sighs dramatically. “I thought by now the tabloids would find newer, fresher stories to chase instead of your sex life.”
Harry steers towards the sleeping area, pushes the peacock screen aside and heads to the unmade king-sized bed with dark emerald sheets. He tries to untangle his arms from around Malfoy’s body but the other wizard is having none of it, instead wrapping his arms around Harry’s torso and yanking him until they both fall clumsily onto the bed.
"If there's anything I can help with, let me know." Draco stopped himself from saying anything more, lest he made a fool out of himself.
Harry smiled gratefully. “Thank you.” The smile vanished as he leaned forward in his seat, sporting what Hermione liked to call his ‘Game Face’. “So, serious talk now, is he good?”
Harry’s eyes sprang open. The first thing he saw, looming directly in front of his face, was Malfoy. Older, but with the same grey eyes, same platinum hair, and alive.
“See you on Thursday, yeah?” Harry grinned as he waved. Draco waved back, which made him beam even wider before he turned around. At the entrance, he joined a tall guy with red hair and a woman with large, bushy hair.
The sack was pulled off his head. His spectacles were gone, probably having fallen off during the kidnapping process. His wand was missing too, but Harry didn’t need it. He muttered a quick Vision Correction Charm, which never lasted very long, but was good enough for the current situation. He was in a vast room that lacked any windows. It was obvious that they were still on the cruise ship. Probably in the lower decks.
Malfoy so angry with him, anyway? Sure, Harry was the one who rushed to capture the suspect without taking the necessary precautions. It was his magic that ran wild and did extensive collateral damage to the warehouse, that resulted in them being doused with infectious spores. If he hadn’t done all this, they probably wouldn’t be stuck in this situation.
"Yes. I'm a member of the Soul Squad. We study anything related to the human soul. The Soulmate Detection spell is a simple spell, created by the Unspeakables themselves.” Draco paused before adding. “Of course, I've tried it on myself."
When it was time for bed, Draco waited for Potter to exit the bathroom and pointed to a glass of cold milk on his bedside table.
Draco withdrew and wrapped his arms around himself. He was wearing a long-sleeved jersey shirt over a cotton T-shirt and a pair of black joggers. He had left his hair untied, letting the pale strands brush against his ears and face. When he moved his head, his hair swayed, and his black earring flickered in and out of sight like a tease. “What do you need me to do?”
Malfoy lifts his forearm, where the red-pink outline of the Dark Mark still mars his fair skin. “The Saviour sleeping with a Death Eater? That can’t possibly go well with public perception.”
Spending his entire summer playing basketball alone meant Draco never had any formal training in passing, but he considered it similar to shooting. He already honed his accuracy so well that he could get the ball wherever he wanted, as long as nothing got in the way. But passing meant somebody had to catch the ball he threw, and for now, the only one he could trust was Blaise.
Healer Kim quickly examined Draco while her team cast monitoring charms on them. "Get him to Iso ICU 6," she ordered, shooting another spell Harry didn't recognize at Draco. Then she turned her attention to Harry. She placed herself between the two Aurors, while the other healers levitated Draco away.
They were from two different worlds. Draco still smelled of expensive sandalwood and fresh vanilla. Harry still felt like he was corrupting Draco every time their bodies touched.
Draco despised having people ask him about his father, but his mother was fair game. He had a lot of good things to say about Narcissa, so despite the apprehension pooling in the pit of his stomach, Draco was able to carry a conversation with Sirius while they ate lamb steaks drenched in black pepper sauce at the dining table. Throughout the conversation, Harry stuck to Draco’s side, listening with rapt attention. Remus kept glancing between Harry and Draco, smiling at whatever he saw.
Harry sent them puzzled looks before glancing at the wine glass in his hand. “I’m not being a very good birthday boy, aren’t I?” he said with a sigh. As he finished his drink, he spotted Ron raising an eyebrow at Luna, who simply shrugged.
“They’re with the coach and team for a de-briefing. I asked to be excused early since my dad and godfather are coming. So, Draco,” he began with a sly smile, gently pulling Draco’s hand and backing towards the kitchen, “do you know how to grill lamb on the stove?”
“Yeah, you fixed this just in time.” Draco slowly opened the fan and drank in the intricate pattern of a white peacock’s tail on the crisp paper. “Thank you.”
"I'm not sure," Hermione admitted. "There are only two minutes left in the first half. Maybe Snape thinks Malfoy has been making too many mistakes. But that pass from Malfoy was really fast. I'm impressed Ron caught that."
“You’re welcome. So...” Blaise drew out his words, “when are you going to tell Potter you’re in love with him?”
“Bring up the tempo. Decide what you want to do with the ball before you catch it.” Harry couldn’t elaborate more than that. He knew little about basketball, after all, but he trusted Draco to figure it out. “I know you can make the ball go wherever you want it to.”
One week before the Rosenberg game, Draco was visibly nervous. His fingers kept tapping the table in a flurry of pent-up energy.
"Gentlemen," she greeted. "I'm afraid I have some grave news for you. We grew the spores you two inhaled in our lab and studied the fungus. We have identified several protein receptors that could cause worrying symptoms, namely loss of consciousness and respiratory muscles paralysis.”
True to his word, Ron would grudgingly tell Harry how Draco was doing at every practice, so Harry learned enough about the people Draco was often seen with: Blaise Zabini, Gregory Goyle and Theodore Nott.
Patients in isolation wards were not allowed visitors. The door was locked from the outside. There wasn't a fireplace to make Floo calls and the windows were simply panes of glass to let light through; they couldn’t be opened and were resistant to blasting spells. Harry probably could have blown the wall to bits if he really tried but he was too distressed; he didn't want to actually leave. He just wanted to see Draco.
Inside the box was a hand-held fan, folded and harmless-looking. But anyone who had seen Draco in action could testify that the fan was a terrifying weapon, one designed by Draco himself, with the help of Blaise’s skills and resources in the Department of Mysteries.
Zabini smiles, the line of his lips smooth and manufactured; he must have practised this smile for ages in front of a mirror. “I would be happy to provide sustenance.”
But as more days went by, Harry grew dissatisfied with the second-hand stories. He wanted to see Draco play, but his work schedule never permitted it. Ron had convinced him to wait for the actual game against Rosenberg, so Harry had the date circled on his calendar and made Luna promise to keep his name off the roster for that day.
Harry was short of breath, though now it was less due to the exercise and more because of this gorgeous being in front of him. “What is it?”
His plan to confess his feelings for Malfoy at Hogsmeade has gone down the drain. Now Malfoy is under the influence of a medicinal potion that helps him with his cold but also makes him cling to Harry more than usual. Harry would be lying if he says he doesn't enjoy it — it is flattering, after all — but he doesn't want to confess when Malfoy isn’t feeling or acting like himself.
It was late at night when Harry returned, his body fatigued but eyes bright and happy upon seeing Draco safe. He agreed immediately when Draco requested to go to Malfoy Manor. They packed some overnight clothes before Harry Side-Along Apparated him to his parents’ home.
It was like a dam broke inside Harry. Desire flooded his every cell and he found himself unable to keep his hands off Draco after that. Every kiss lit a fire within him. He could even feel his magic spark whenever their bodies connected.
“There is a fine line between blindly obeying your parents’ orders and deliberately going against them,” Blaise pointed out. “We’re all on different sides of this line.”
Harry stared at Malfoy, who acted as if this wasn’t the first time he shared something personal since they started working together. But it was, and it was amazing. It never crossed his mind, but as soon as Malfoy said it, Harry
He trails off and sends Teddy an apologetic look. “I’m sorry, Teddy. If you’re uncomfortable, I can tell him to come another day.”
Harry was already planning to go anyway, so receiving a direct invitation from Draco was a big, fat icing on the proverbial cake. He could not stop smiling; his cheeks were starting to hurt. “I’d love to.”
They fell into a pattern. They kissed, bit, and groped each other. Although inappropriate, Harry loved these private moments with Draco. He often glimpsed Draco smiling dreamily between their kisses, grey eyes gazing at him with an adoration that never failed to make  Harry's heart beat faster.
Malfoy huffs. "That can't be further from the truth. No, what I mean is I prefer to do things according to my own choices, out of my own volition, and not because certain circumstances force me to.”
After an excruciating wait, Draco turned on his stool until his body faced Harry, though his arms remained crossed. He lifted his chin and locked eyes with Harry, flinching when the Auror tenderly touched his jaw but neither broke eye contact.
Draco shrugged. His father was in Azkaban, his mother was sentenced to home arrest for 15 years, his family name tainted, his family fortune would deplete quickly if he didn’t take over the family business once he graduated.
The downside of being the one leading the way was Harry could no longer sneak glances at the blond, who followed silently behind him.
"What would that change, Potter?" Draco snapped as his hands started gesturing wildly. "I know how your childhood and teenage years were influenced by a madman's response to a prophecy that was out of your control. Isn't this similar? An ancient, poorly understood magical force dictates who is compatible with your magic and soul. It's not even comprehensive! It doesn't take into account your emotions, your minds, or your physical compatibility. Why do you think the Department of Mysteries never shared this knowledge with the public? It's useless and even harmful in some instances. It gives false hope and robs people of their agency. Not all soulmates end up getting along. They can even be enemies."
Draco couldn’t tell exactly how long they stared at each other. He was proud he managed to keep a straight face even though his heart was hammering like crazy. His palms were sweaty when he reached into his bag and grabbed a biro.
“Yes,” Harry replied before his voice became hesitant. “I mean, only if you can? I know phone bills aren’t cheap.”
Harry shook his head slightly and pulled his visor back down. “I had a great time with you, Draco. We should do this again.” He bid farewell, pushing his motorcycle back to the road.
Draco bows to Lucius Malfoy with a nonchalance that only the beloved son of a Captain can get away with. “You stole him from me too soon, Father,” he complains. “I haven’t even gotten to the good part yet.”
Harry gives Ron, his First Commander, the Captain’s Chair before heading to the Teleportation Chamber.
“Potter? The guy you’re on the phone with practically every night?” Pansy cackled. “Is he also the one who brought you home on his motorcycle at the beginning of the semester?”
Harry finishes putting the books and essays on the coffee table before looking at Malfoy incredulously. “You what?”
Draco’s mind was in shambles, so it was a miracle he managed to reply, as calmly as he could, “I expect you to.”
So when Weasley passed him the ball, Draco got into his shooting stance and sent the ball straight through the hoop.
But he could not let these nightmares control him again, Harry decided. He didn’t want to make Malfoy uncomfortable. They needed to live together for two weeks and work together for much longer. These nightmares were just inconveniences. In fact, aside from Harry’s nightmares, they had been getting along pretty well. After lunch, Malfoy had continued his work while Harry catalogued the things in the pantry. Dinner was great. Malfoy had even complimented him again, more sincerely this time.
“Sort of. He used to hate my father and despises my godfather, so he hates me too,” he remarked flippantly. “Good thing I’m not on his team.”
“Forget I said that. Please forget I said that,” Malfoy begs, panicking as he looks at Harry. “Please stay.”
Draco surveyed his opponents. The Rosenberg players were all winded. Smith, previously cocky, was now heaving under the exertion of keeping up with their accelerated gameplay. Their defence had considerably weakened. To do what Davies was asking now would be cruel, but after recalling Smith’s taunts, Draco nodded earnestly at his captain.
They talked a bit more. Eventually, Draco felt Pansy give him a hug. "Do you know what to do now, darling?"
“Hm, no idea what you just said,” Draco quipped as he brought his hands up to cup Harry’s jaw and continued kissing him.
Harry stared at his hands long after Narcissa and Ron had left, feeling the weight of trust placed upon him.
"Are you going out?" asked Draco, disapprovingly picking at several loose threads on Potter's sleeves.
It had been five years since the war but holding Harry Potter in his arms still reminded Draco of Fiendfyre. He shivered and almost ran out the door but Potter stopped him with an arm around his waist.
At the main campus, Ron dropped Dean and Neville off at their respective schools before he and Harry continued towards the Business School building. They took some time to find parking, which made Harry grudgingly admit that they should have come earlier. Eventually, they found one and hurried on foot to the spot where Hermione had been waiting for them.
“Yes, there is,” Greg chimed in, looking up from his cards. “But not basketball. It’s a volleyball tournament. Right, Daphne? Thomas told you about it in class.”
While they wait, Seamus and Dean trade theories on what the cargo could possibly be. Is it a biological or a chemical weapon? Can it destroy suns and stars? Or, if one is well-read on Captain Malfoy’s past missions, is the weapon something sneaky such as war prisoners or material for blackmail?
They entered a glass box with no furniture. As soon as their bodies passed through completely, a section of the glass wall parted and a team of wizards and witches in Protective Bubble-Body Charms hurried towards them. Healer Kim, leading the charge, fired a spell at Draco.
“You’re… satisfactory,” Draco murmured, trying to be teasing as well but instead just ended up sounding wheezy. Had Harry’s eyes always been this beautiful up close?
Draco remembered the conversation Potter was referring to perfectly. While he had been glad to be rid of his horrible ex-partner, he was also particularly relieved when he discovered Potter was the replacement. Potter wouldn't see him as just a Death Eater. Potter wouldn't throw him under the bus. Potter would give him a chance to prove himself. He felt safe with Potter, had trusted him to win a war and now trusted him with his life.
His disguise was a spoiled rich kid who’d never spent a day under the sun, and Harry admitted that the role was tailor-made for Draco.
"I see," she said dreamily, glancing at something over his shoulder. "But I do encourage you to return home soon. The Nargles around you are getting restless."
Just inside the door is a small foyer where Draco has all his shoes arranged by purpose and colour. Harry takes off his own shoes here and enters the room properly in his socks.
Getting on the motorcycle turned out to be easier than it looked. Once he got on behind Harry, however, he didn’t know where to put his hands. He waited as Harry pulled on a pair of leather gloves and fastened his own helmet.
His heart thrummed vigorously against his ribcage and he struggled to breathe for a minute. He closed his eyes and concentrated, trying to make sense of the mash-up of joy, pleasure and hope swirling in his chest.
Harry couldn't help but grin back. Their conversation moved on to other topics, including Hermione's studies and, much to his friend's amusement, whether one needed to brush one’s teeth again after drinking milk.
Draco hummed happily and pressed his body against Harry's back. "Brilliant, because I want you to come to bed with me."
Draco’s Adam’s apple bobbed as he swallowed. "I see you, but... Potter, if I do this with you but we don't work out," he whispered, "I won't be able to handle it. I'm not… strong enough."
Malfoy nods and turns towards the wardrobe. Harry manages to escape and not look when the towel drops to the floor.
Draco wondered whether Snape was going to tell his father about how abysmal he was. He imagined Lucius’s displeased expression, that twist of the corner of his mouth that signified how disappointed he was in Draco.
“This is… interesting. I can’t see you, but I can still feel you, even more so than usual.” Draco’s breaths were hot and short. “You know, we can make the best out of this situation.”
“I don’t think Rosenberg is much better than us, but why are we having so much trouble?” Snape wondered aloud, eyeing each of his players as though he expected a serious answer.
They broke up a few days before July 31st. It was after breakfast, and Draco had just refused to attend Potter's birthday party.
“I refilled the poison and reinforced the frame with Hardening Charms, so that they don’t break as easily as before,” Blaise explained, grinning proudly. “You’re leaving on a mission tomorrow, right?”
Later, Draco explained that after getting Harry’s letter, he had owled Luna and asked for her help. She had enlisted Ron’s assistance and together, they plotted to have Harry return home early so that he could spend the first moments of his birthday with Draco.
As Potter led the way, Draco observed Potter’s gait. If Potter stood straight, he would be almost as tall as Draco. But now he walked with his shoulders hunched, as though the act of saving the wizarding world had also thrust its problems onto his teenage shoulders.
Sensing positive energy from the team, Davies nodded his approval. “In that case, we better make this work.”
Draco returned with an armful of bottles and jars. “The brainchild of Master Potioneer Cornelius Yap, who gave them to his enemies, either killing them or turning them into Squibs. The only reason not many potioneers have succeeded in replicating his poison is that the list of ingredients includes—" he walked over to Harry and jabbed a finger on the open page, “saliva of a Komodo Dragon, boiled whiskers of Sumatran tigers and the faeces of bats in pitcher plants.”
Draco wondered how much Potter knew about legends of the Greek Titans, of Atlas and the globe on his back. If Draco offered to tell the story, would Potter place his head on Draco’s lap and listen attentively, like Draco had done with his mother when he was a child?
Harry laughed quietly. “You’ll have to tell me beforehand when you’re going to call. Otherwise, I’ll stay up all night waiting.”
"Now, hang on." Harry's own throat constricted. "Not useful? Your colleagues spent 48 hours going round in circles, no idea how to find you, until one of them suggested the soulmate route. They taught me a spell to make me aware of the soulmate connection, and then I could locate you easily." He gestured at the medallion around his neck, pointedly ignoring the green glow of the jade. "I only needed one jump."
Harry laughs, shaking his head. He scoots closer until they are sitting side-by-side, thighs and hips pressed together, and laces the fingers of his right hand with Draco’s left. “I promised I’d make it worth the wait.”
The scientific name of the plant is long and convoluted, so it went over Harry’s head. What he understands from Draco’s long explanation is that it’s a new biological source of energy.
“Believe it or not, Potter, those of us who use our brains actually spend some time pondering on our observations, rather than rushing to the wrong conclusions.”
Harry found Draco Malfoy lying on a lounge chair by the swimming pool at the topmost deck of the cruise ship. The blond wore a pair of large sunglasses, which Harry didn’t see the point of because the sun wasn’t too bright and he was completely shaded by a large umbrella next to him. His light blue polo shirt was open at the collar and his khaki shorts rode up his pale thighs when he crossed his legs, one calf over the other.
A mediwitch reminded them that visiting hours were over. Narcissa bid farewell to Draco, kissing him on both cheeks. Then she went to Harry, took his hands in hers and said, “Please take care of my son, Mr Potter.”
“If you want to continue this hobby of yours, then be good at it,” he had warned during their journey to Snape’s house, many months ago. “Be the
This thought made Harry's ears grow warm. "Stop it, Harry. He was joking," he scolded himself. "Just. Joking."
“A broken vial? How am I supposed to do a reliable analysis when all they give me is a few drops and no ingredients?” Draco mumbled under his breath, “I may be good but I’m not a miracle worker.”
"I'm sorry, Harry." Hermione smiled ruefully. "Are you conflicted over your feelings and your nightmares?"
The feel of Harry’s breath against his cheek was his only warning before Draco felt that first timid brush of Harry’s lips against his. His eyes instantly slid closed and he clutched the back of Harry’s neck as he pushed forward for more. Harry tilted his head and slotted their mouths together just right.
Harry gave him more details, his voice quivering a little. He then talked about how his other two housemates were also part of the volleyball team, and how his coach has been increasing the frequency and length of their practices in preparation for the winter tournament.
When put that way, it did appear really simple. “Right,” Draco replied. “Make sure you catch my passes and score.”
“Hey, hi,” Draco’s voice sounded slightly different through the telephone line, but it still sent joy through Harry’s entire body. “It’s me, Draco. Malfoy. Is this a bad time?”
Harry guffaws, dropping back against the large and plush cushions of Malfoy’s sofa. They have just finished having a late breakfast together, and would have fallen into awkward silence if it wasn't for Malfoy’s potion-induced chattiness forcing them to engage in conversations. “That doesn’t make any sense.”
“Maybe next time,” Harry said, smiling. “After watching a game like that, I’m itching to play some volleyball.”
Teddy takes a moment to study this new man. He reaches out, taps Draco’s fingers and instantly draws his hand back.
Hermione and Ginny had taken care of the invitations and arrangements, while Molly had prepared the menu; there wasn't much for Harry to do aside from showing up when the time came.
“Calm down, you beast. It’s been a long day for me.” Draco laughed for the first time since the Prophet story was published. “How was
Draco's nimble fingers tapped the surface of the stone absentmindedly. "If you say so. It's not like I can go anywhere."
He hoisted Draco onto his back and carried him to the living room. Yelling "St Mungo’s!", he threw Floo powder into the fireplace and promptly crawled through the green flames.
“I don’t remember…” Harry muttered, even as images of dirty green windows and a pool of blood on wet grey tiles flashed behind his eyes.
“You don’t have to worry about that, Greg,” assured Draco. After all, he wasn’t interested in the game or even in the sport.
“I assure you it makes perfect sense!” Malfoy says pointedly, turning around. “You have nice chocolate skin and I lo—” He slams his mouth shut and glares at Harry, who is wiping the corners of his own eyes.
"I think…" Draco closed his eyes, picturing Potter's joyful smiles and hearing his own heartbeats loud in his ears. "I think I'm in trouble."
“The Captain is unfortunately occupied at the moment,” Lieutenant Commander Blaise Zabini explains pleasantly as all of them step out into the brightly lit hallway. “He will be ready for you in about an hour.”
“I’m sorry,” Draco said, feeling something odd about Harry’s answer, but couldn’t focus enough to determine why. “I… I’m sorry I asked.”
With a silly grin still plastered onto his face, Harry dropped into the seat between Ron and Hermione, instantly feeling two pairs of eyes curiously inspecting him.
“Yesterday you said spattergroit is horrible because a virulent strain can make you lose your memories. You also don’t drink because you lose control of yourself when you’re drunk. That’s pretty consistent.”
Malfoy was at the kitchen door, a finger pointing towards the living room. "Weasley is on the Floo. He asked for you."
Draco Malfoy was forced to return to Hogwarts as part of his sentencing. He joined the other Eighth Years, though he kept mostly to himself. Draco rarely sat in the Eighth Year Common Room because it was often taken up by Gryffindors, who made up a majority of their year.
Draco lowered his legs and quickly found himself in Harry's arms again. His body relaxed in Harry's embrace as he was rocked slowly.
"Are you kidding me?" Harry demands, literally shaking Malfoy back and forth. "You're Draco Malfoy! You're never
In his mind's eye, Draco saw himself wrapped in Harry's embrace again, this time chest-to-chest, the smell of Harry's aftershave so strong he almost tasted it on his tongue. He yearned to climb into Harry's lap, to straddle his thighs and taste his lips. If Harry’s adopted dad and godfather could be together, couldn’t they, too?
“You’re not the only one who’s left a mark on me," said Draco. "These scars don’t bother me. They never do, not as much as this one has.” He nodded at his left arm. He wondered how he could make Harry understand. "Do you forgive me for being a Death Eater?"
He was in a room similar to the one he had woken up in two weeks prior, only this time Harry was not sitting on the other bed. Despite the ache in his bones when he moved, Draco sat up, folded his legs and rested his forehead against them, taking deep breaths.
Pansy said it looked like the root of a tree, or a leafless tree if you looked at it upside-down, but Draco knew better. He had seen the exact pattern across the sky during a rainstorm.
Potter fixed him with a solemn stare, his hair and clothes still dripping water. “This spending-two-weeks-alone-together thing. This situation sucks. Isn’t that why you’re angry at me today?”
At four years old, he is wary of unfamiliar faces. He is only comfortable with Grandma and Uncle Harry, because he spends the most time with the two of them. Without either of them, he doesn’t feel safe. He cries loudly whenever he finds himself around people other than his grandmother and his godfather, much to the chagrin of Uncle Harry’s friends. Initially, everyone attributed Teddy’s reactions to ‘stranger anxiety’, and accepted it. But lately, Uncle Harry has begun looking more troubled whenever Teddy acts up around his friends.
With a placating smile, Blaise reached into his robes and extracted a long black cuboid box, larger than a wand case. Draco’s eyes widened and his body straightened. Blaise moved closer and allowed the Auror to grab the box out of his hand. He sat down on the bench as his friend tore off the lid and gasped.
That night, during dinner, Ron reported the starting lineup for the Rosenberg game, which consisted of himself, Draco, Zabini, Goyle and their captain, Roger Davies. Harry, Neville and Dean congratulated him and enthusiastically sang songs that turned Ron’s ears as red as his hair.
“Okay,” Harry murmured, unsure where Draco was getting at with this, but he kept his arms around him.
As quickly as it appears, the smile vanishes from Harry’s sight when Malfoy turns away, pushes against Harry’s chest and stands up. Harry leans forwards in his seat, chasing his body heat, and almost falls clumsily to the floor but Malfoy catches his arm just in time and pulls him towards the bed.
After a while, Harry stretched his arms and laid back onto the grass while Draco remained seated, having no desire to ruin his cashmere sweater. “Draco, when is your birthday?”
under a cauldron. “These three are only found in a certain part of the world —  Learn your geography, Potter, I’m not spoon-feeding you — so if you check recent shipments from this region into the country or history of recent travels, it’ll narrow down your list of suspects. You’re welcome, oh Chosen One.”
Harry doesn’t have time to survey the equipment because at that moment, the Captain's Chair swirls around, demanding every ounce of Harry’s attention.
Malfoy doesn't respond to that. Harry is about to fall asleep drinking in the scent of Malfoy's hair when finally he hears:
Draco almost laughed at the absurdity of it. “No, she’s definitely not. That’s Pansy, my friend and housemate.”
Healer Kim laid a hand on his shoulder. "We will do our best, Auror Potter. We'll take care of him. In the meantime, you will need to finish your quarantine period in our isolation ward. Iso 22," she said that last bit at a Mediwizard, who nodded.
When Draco asked Blaise to give him a lift to the City Stadium, he hadn’t expected to be interrogated in return.
offend Draco's ego, it didn't. Draco welcomed Potter's attention, relished in it. It made Draco feel special. Safe.
Until Halloween, when Draco accidentally blurted out that he was dating Harry Potter over dinner at Malfoy Manor.
As Hermione continued explaining the rules and positions, the crowd suddenly erupted into cheers. Harry looked up to see the Hogwarts team walking in with Snape leading. They dropped their bags by the players’ bench. The five starting players started removing their jackets while the others took their seats on the bench.
Draco tilted his head, giggling as Harry pressed his mouth against the side of his neck. “Hush, Harry. I have my loyalties. Snape will kill you if you make me jump ship.”
From the other bed, Harry gave her a bashful grin. “Can I stay here longer? Keep Draco company until he can go home?”
cases," Draco huffed irritably, "the Ministry still sends its favourite lapdog to babysit me? Merlin, help me."
The more time Harry spent with Draco, the more mesmerized he was. Harry learned that he had a sweet tooth and couldn't stand spicy food. Draco’s friends were all in Arts School because unlike Draco, their parents had let them choose (or didn't care) what they studied. Draco once complained that it was getting tiresome to tie his hair during basketball practices, but never made any efforts for a haircut; instead, he liked to touch it — twirling a lock around a finger, combing or pushing his sidebangs back with a hand, basically anything that drew Harry’s attention to his white-blond hair — when he spoke with Harry. Draco liked to act cool and blasé as though nothing could bother him, when in reality he was socially awkward. And, despite Draco never outright admitting it, evident in his appearance and fashion choices was a rebellious side that festered beneath the surface.
“Thank you, Harry!” Luna smiled sweetly, handing Harry his leather jacket before he left. “Have fun on your date tomorrow.”
"I thought you liked me," Malfoy repeats, more distraught this time as he hugs himself. "But I now suspect it's just your hero complex. You would probably do this for anyone. Bet you'd do anything for your friends."
When the man’s gaze dropped to the book in Harry’s hand, he took it with a murmured “Thanks” and turned to grab his leather bag. His hair had fallen forwards so he tucked it back behind an ear, drawing Harry’s attention again to his hair, long fingers and — Harry’s breath hitched — a lone black stud on his left earlobe.
"Good morning, gentlemen! I hope you are settling in. How are you feeling today? Any nausea? Headache? Sudden loss of voice?"
Harry recalls Madam Pomfrey listing the symptoms to watch out for, including the side effects of the potion. Even though Malfoy’s body is hot and feverish, he himself feels cold, and so insists on being pressed up against Harry to take advantage of his body heat.
"Thomas, Finnegan, Longbottom. I think other Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaw too but I don't recall their names."
Because Harry has had a big crush on Malfoy for more than a year and he is finally going to confess his feelings.
“Why don’t we test that?” Harry suggested mischievously. Malfoy only managed to yelp in indignation before Harry took the last scone from the tray and hurled it towards the open window.
Later that night, Draco had his head on Harry's lap, chin tilted up as Harry carefully dropped potion on the lone purple pustule on his jaw. He kept touching Draco’s face long after the pustule was gone and the procedure was completed because he couldn’t help himself, and Draco let him.
Harry tossed a volleyball to Draco, who caught it easily. “I want to practise my spikes. I need you to throw the ball.”
It was rather unsettling how easily Weasley and Granger accepted him into their folds. Draco’s relationship with Weasley only existed in the basketball club and this was his first time interacting with Granger. What they were doing now — preparing for Harry’s adoptive dad and godfather’s visit — felt very domestic, a private event between family and close friends. He wondered what Harry had shared with them, and whether they had ever discussed Draco.
“Really? Are you acting shy now?” Harry teases, reaching out to gently run his fingers through Draco’s sleek hair.
Harry decides to wait until the potions effects are gone before he confesses or makes any moves. In the meantime, he’ll take care of his sick friend.
Healer Kim was relieved to see them. "I'm glad you two are doing so well. I was afraid about the possible symptoms I talked about yesterday. Maybe I have been too worried."
The dining room had a high ceiling, an ornate chandelier and walls adorned with landscape paintings and portraits alike. Harry wasn’t sure how to act around the man who had tried to kill him on more than one occasion, but seeing Lucius Malfoy sickly and confined to a wheelchair reminded him that the war was over, and people could change.
He held down Potter’s right hand against the table and wrote his address on Potter's forearm next to the constellation.
“Oh look, Malfoy has the same number as you,” Hermione remarked, pointing. The players wore dark green and white sleeveless jerseys. Each player’s surname was written on the back, while their number was written both on the front and the back. Draco was number 11, while Ron was number 10.
"Disappointing." If Draco felt Harry's fingers gently carding through his hair, he didn't say anything. "I don't think I like… girls."
The Auror’s report contained a lot of praise concerning one independent Potioneer — although Ron had crossed out the parts where Harry waxed poetic about Draco’s seastorm eyes.
Malfoy squirms, as if unsure what to do with this new revelation, which makes Harry anxious. This isn't how Harry wanted his confession to go. The last thing he wants is to make things awkward between them.
instance where they were in the Quidditch stands, watching a match from the teaching staff box, and the wind was blowing Harry’s black hair into his eyes; Malfoy brushed his fringe back, gloved fingers grazing Harry’s forehead and scalp before withdrawing his hand as though nothing happened.
“I hope it is up to your standards,” said Draco, removing his jacket and making his way towards the kitchen as though he owned the place. “It was the only one the shop had.”
Harry's statement made Draco’s cheeks flush pink. Their moment was once again interrupted by Snape, who suddenly appeared behind Draco and glared down his sharp nose at Harry.
The next time Draco managed to steal the ball (from Theo, who obviously wasn’t even trying), Blaise called for him again. Draco refused to pass. Instead, he kept the ball and immediately saw Weasley running over to defend.
Written for the prompt: a slow burn being like… I’m not in love with them! cut to scene of the person in question staring dreamingly at the object of their desire.
The scone passed through the window frame and only managed a short flight before being vaporised by a forcefield that turned bright purple upon impact. The barrier disappeared immediately, along with any traces of the scone.
Harry peered over his shoulder, at Neville’s closed door. When he turned back, his face was flushed pink. “I asked you simple questions. Like, is he good? What position does he play?”
As November approached, the weather got colder, and Harry stopped seeing Draco at the outdoor court on his way home from work. Instead, he found out from Ron that the basketball club was having unofficial practices almost every afternoon, in preparation for their practice match against Rosenberg University.
"Fine," Draco sighed. "If you must know, my previous partner didn't trust a Death Eater like me to write the reports. Said I would write lies and make myself look good and him bad. But that was exactly what
But his desire to scold vanished when Draco asked, “Why did the Department of Mysteries send you, an Auror? Why not another Unspeakable?”
The first space is a sitting area that doubles as a study. There is a three-seat sofa, a coffee table and a writing desk. There are also bookshelves lining the walls, each packed with so many books they couldn’t possibly fit without Extension Charms. Then there is a small kitchen with marble countertops and a tiny sink. There is a door off to the side, which Harry suspects is the bathroom. A wooden screen, its surface depicting the drawing of a large white peacock surrounded by colourful flowers, separates the living area from the sleeping area. There is no dining table or fireplace.
"Didn't we survive a war too?" Harry quipped, earning a frustrated growl from the other wizard. "Draco, please look at me."
Harry grew up in a modest suburban town, son of a pair of government employees and the elder brother of two bright ginger-haired girls. He grew up playing football in the streets with friends, surrounded by love. He inherited his dad’s mischievous ingenuity and his mom’s creativity. He chose to study Electrical Engineering because he dreamed of helping people all around the world.
“You better, Potter,” Malfoy snaps. After a pause, he withdraws his arms and yanks the blanket to cover his whole body, including his head. Harry hears a sniffle as he gets up from the bed and goes to the bathroom.
“Only Uncle Harry and Grandma are family,” Teddy protests petulantly, hugging the stuffed toy close to himself.
Draco stands up and beckons Harry closer, completely ignoring Harry’s two officers. “Blaise told me the Captain of
"Prayer for the Dead and the Living," said Draco, attempting and failing to tame Potter's hair. "Very old Wizarding custom."
They never brought each other home. They never went on dates. They never addressed what they did, but not due to any lack of effort from Harry. Whenever he tried to talk about it, Draco would stare at him in trepidation and despair, as though Harry was going to curse him or strike him with a sword. Then he would use whatever Unspeakable skills he had to escape and disappear.
“You can ask Healer Kim if you don’t believe me,” Malfoy said. “Anyway, I don’t like that. I don’t want to lose my memories. They make me who I am.”
Something dangerous flashed in Harry’s green eyes as he rolled on top of Draco. “That’s the price I’m willing to pay.”
After their visitors left, Healer Kim gave them a long explanation on what to do during isolation. They needed to monitor each other’s symptoms, make sure they drank their potions every day, put their clothes into special bags to be sanitised and much more. Draco tried to listen, but he found it hard to focus with anger boiling in his chest. Stupid Potter for brandishing his stupid powers with stupid, reckless abandon. Stupid Potter for getting them into this stupid situation. Now he had to stupidly spend two fucking weeks with stupid Potter all stupid day.
Captain Malfoy notices Harry’s hesitation and instead adds, “I see my son hasn’t informed you that your ship needs to be anchored to mine during jumps?”
He also looked like a wet dream. Gone was the malnourished teenager with knobbly knees. Now the Saviour was all muscles and sinew, broad shoulders, square jaw, with a pair of rectangular gold-framed glasses and hair that made him look like he always just got up from bed.
“I’m sorry I’m not the person you wished to spend the day with. If I don’t already know how you feel about Malfoy, I’d be offended,” the Herbology teacher remarks as they grab a quick drink in town.
Neville Longbottom, the most responsible one in the house, waited for Harry by the front door, twirling a ring of keys around an index finger. Harry zipped past him, out the door and gate and climbed into the backseat of Ron’s car. Ron was behind the wheel, nervously rubbing his palms together while Dean Thomas rode shotgun, his charcoal stained hands nonchalantly flipping through the pages of his own sketchbook. After Neville settled next to Harry, house keys jingling from his belt, the four of them made their way to campus. Ron’s radio was broken, so Dean sang off-key renditions of Spice Girls’ hit songs throughout the journey.
Draco had never ridden a motorcycle in his life, so when they reached the parking area, he stared at the two-wheeled vehicle in trepidation. “No way,” he breathed. “This is a hazard.”
They didn’t even go into warp. They have somehow materialized at a different part of the galaxy in a split second. Like teleportation but with both of their ships. Like magic.
He halted at the door when he saw Potter in the waiting room. Potter was seated in one of the two armchairs, slouched and flipping through a magazine. He hadn’t noticed Draco yet.
"I don't do everything myself," Draco pointed out. He was stretched next to Potter, his ankles resting on the coffee table and a cup of tea between his hands. "You're helping me with them now."
The potion activated as soon as it touched the pustule, burning the infected tissue and simultaneously healing the skin cells beneath. The sight was just as impressive as the first time around.
They woke up later than usual and shared a long shower. By the time they were dressed, it was already time for Healer Kim's session.
Draco opened his mouth to retort, but the front door opened and Pansy emerged from the house, wearing a short, lacy black dress and tall dark boots. She didn’t hold back on the black lipstick and black nail polish today. She crossed her arms and glared at Draco with heavily shadowed eyes.
Draco hesitated for a moment, but then he mumbled "Fuck it" and proceeded to unbutton his pyjamas. "You want to see my scars, Potter? Fine." He didn't stop with the buttons. He tore off the pyjamas completely, exposing his arms; His Dark Mark strikingly dark and obvious on his pale skin.
Today, the Prophet printed a story about Potter's contribution to an orphanage. In the photographs, his hair was as messy as ever and he still wore those iconic round spectacles. He had grown to be a handsome man, his smiles came easily as he spoke to each child.
Hearing Potter say that made something in Draco snap. The following words came out in waves; he could not stop them, no matter how embarrassing they were: "You make me feel safe. You should feel safe too. The least I can do for you, or I suppose, what I
Harry’s arms automatically grip Malfoy’s shoulders but instead of pushing Malfoy away, he simply holds on, completely flummoxed. “Um, Malfoy?”
Eventually, Harry cleared his throat. “Hey, uh, my volleyball tournament is going to start soon. The first game is next Saturday, at the City Stadium. I’ll have only one match, and then afterwards, my dad and godfather are coming to visit me. So, er, if you’re free, would you like to come to my game? And then join me at my house later?”
Draco's body relaxed against his. He soon fell asleep; Harry carried him to his bed and tucked him in. He brushed blond hair away and planted a kiss on Draco’s forehead.
Harry laughed. “You only say that because you hate cooking.” Instead of denying it, Malfoy simply shrugged and continued eating.
Draco closed his eyes, another protest ready on the tip of his tongue, but he pressed his lips shut together, visibly holding himself back. He was already making an effort.
Draco’s mouth twisted in displeasure for a split second before it opened in realisation. “I admit that took me by surprise, but it’s not terrible. I just have to think of the opposite of what you’re saying.”
“You didn’t even look at me during dinner,” Potter said, looking dejected. “I’m really sorry for getting us into this mess.”
“Don’t worry about that. My mother pays for all my bills and she always lets me do whatever I want.”
but I'm also right here. I'm right in front of you and I'm in love with you. But you don't want to see that. You don't
Draco paused to recall what he did yesterday that could be relevant. “You saw me in Financial Reporting class?”
“Potter, listen,” he began, putting both hands inside his jacket pockets to protect them from the cold.
He expects a witty reply, a biting remark or even maybe another smack, but Malfoy smiles. It’s one of those rare ones that reaches his eyes and makes his face bloom with joy and always causes Harry to forget to breathe.
“Harry?” Draco said later in bed, after a plate of roasted chicken and peas was placed on his lap. “How would I eat this?”
Inhaling sharply, Draco releases Harry’s chin and swats Harry’s hand away. “Fine. I’ve waited ages for you. I suppose I can do a couple more hours,” he declares airily, sitting back.
Weasley won the coin toss, and his team chose to be the offensive team first. When the match started, Draco was confident in his chances. He had played almost every day for the past few months and never missed a shot.
Uncle Harry heaves a heavy sigh. “We are, but you’re allowed to have a bigger family than just the three of us. Give this person a chance, please. I love him and he’s been looking forward to meeting you and he is literally your cousin.”
Harry hurries to his side, making it just in time before the cup slips from his hand and crashes onto the floor. Malfoy's body sways backwards and falls against Harry, who quickly wraps his arms around Malfoy's waist.
“Is it? I’ve never had one. Neither do my friends. Isn’t it your parents’ responsibility to pay for your expenses?”
"Why not?" Draco demanded, seeing red. "Why do you insist on this? Do you just want to show me off?"
Eventually, Zabini returns to their side, a resigned expression across his features. “The Captain has generously bestowed us his permission. I am to escort you to the Second Cockpit.”
A few minutes passed where no one spoke. The wind outside grew more violent, transforming into a full-on blizzard.
Potter sent the drenched couch a look of utter defeat before spelling it back to its original (and dry) form and following Draco to the bedroom.
"I could have killed you too!" Draco pointed out irritably. "Doesn't matter. We didn't kill each other."
“It’s not up for debate, Auror Malfoy,” said Robards firmly. “I have arranged for both of you to be quarantined together in one of DMLE’s safe houses
Since it was too cold to wait for Harry outside, Granger suggested they all sit in Weasley’s car while Harry showered and changed. Draco had deduced that Weasley and Granger were dating, judging from their body language, and so didn’t dare object when she sat in the passenger’s seat beside Weasley, leaving Draco to take the back seat.
“Excuse me, sir,” said Draco. “I’m sorry for my behaviour during the first half, but I think I know how we can catch up. I can do it, but I need everyone’s cooperation.” With Snape’s permission, Draco shared his ideas and plans.
Later, Healer Kim came to examine Draco, who almost didn’t recognise her without her Bubble Charm. She appeared surprised to find Harry. “Auror Potter, I was under the impression I approved your discharge this morning. Why are you still here? Aren’t you eager to go home after so long?”
Snape blew his whistle, signalling the time was up. Draco’s successful shot had earned his team three points, so the game had ended in a tie.
Gasps, interrupted breaths and soft moans fill the air as they continue kissing with little care for anything else.
volleyball, so she was the perfect person to play translator to Harry, who had never watched a real basketball match before.
Harry leans closer, and closer still, until he is pressing Draco into the sofa, his hand trapped between the armrest and Draco’s nape. He feels Draco give in to Harry’s weight on top of him, even bringing his legs up until he lies supine across the sofa and allows their hands easier access to roam about the other’s body. Harry trails his free hand up and down Draco’s chest while Draco has his in Harry’s hair and on his back.
Harry got up and walked to where Malfoy was. Malfoy heard him approach and looked up. He must have noticed Harry’s tense face and shoulders, because he asked, “Are you alright? What did Weasley say?”
Before he could think of a response, a fire roared to life in the living room fireplace. They went to the living room and saw Healer Kim's head in the fire. Her head was surrounded by a Bubble-Head Charm. She smiled when Harry and Malfoy knelt in front of her.
good in them. His face is pointy, sharp, and strikingly fair. He leans against one armrest, grey eyes honing in on Harry like a missile. There is a smudge of dirt on his forehead but it takes nothing away from his remarkable glamour.
“Starting countdown,” one of the twins – Parvati? – reports as she pulls up a timer onto the screen, dialling back from thirty. The lights in the cockpit change back from red to normal off-white.
Weasley parked in front of a corner-lot double-storey house. It was homey, with a modest yard in front. The compound was surrounded by white walls and a small black iron gate. After Harry woke up, he guided Draco through the gate. Draco recognised Harry’s motorcycle parked near the door and also caught a glimpse of a small garden in the yard — someone with a green thumb must be living in the house.
interesting, so now suddenly you love basketball.” Ron rolled his eyes. He looked up at the ceiling, above which was Dean’s room, listening for noise before asking in a whisper, “Listen, are you even sure he, you know,
“Perhaps,” he replied, catching Harry’s hand that had been playing with his hair. “You never asked, so I never gave it a thought.”
“Are you well, Draco?” She quickly checked his pulse and his temperature. “Has any of the cursed letters reached you?”
When Harry is getting ready for bed later that day, his personal handheld device pings with an incoming message.
Harry smiled, gingerly brushing Draco's cheek with the pad of his thumb. "I always feel like something is missing between us. Don't you feel it too? Don't you want to find out what it is?"
“We have visuals on one. Locked on target,” Ron reports over the comms. “Our radars detect more incoming ships, but they’re too far. Fire?”
Draco was immensely proud of his shots, so when Harry asked him to launch the ball at a vague spot in the air, he took it as a challenge. He only needed Harry to demonstrate his spike once and after a few practice tosses, Draco signalled he was ready.
In the end, Malfoy props a large cushion against the armrest and makes Harry lie across the sofa with his back against the cushion. Then Malfoy pulls one of Harry’s legs until it drops to the floor. This creates a space between Harry’s thighs that Malfoy settles into, his back against Harry’s chest. He bends forward to fetch a plate of dinner and a fork from the coffee table and leans back. He winds one of Harry’s arms around his own waist, leaving Harry’s other hand free to feed himself using the fork while Malfoy holds the plate.
Perhaps his error was in the timing. He had asked Blaise in the middle of Friday dinner in the presence of all his old friends, including Pansy, Theo, Greg, Daphne and Vince.
Harry forgot to breathe for a moment. He gathered his courage and leaned down to bring himself closer to Draco. “When this quarantine is over, would you go out with me?”
After Healer Kim left, Draco threw his pillow at the bespectacled idiot. It hit Potter square in the face. “Fuck you! This is all your fault!”
Draco, an athlete himself, understood perfectly. He found it refreshing to listen to someone talk passionately about something other than basketball, even if it’s a sport he knew nothing about.
Harry lifted his head and pushed up his visor. Draco could see a tiny part of his face, but his eyes were hidden behind tinted lenses, so instead of green eyes, Draco could only see his own distorted reflection. Which actually helped with his anxiety and what he was going to say next.
On the way home, Harry passed a large park that had a playground and multiple courts. He had never paid any attention to it before, but when he stopped at a red light on the road just next to a basketball court, he couldn’t help but look over at the lone tall figure throwing a basketball at the hoop. Harry pushed up his visor to get a better look.
“You’ve just experienced your first ever space jump, powered by Faith Apparatus,” Draco says happily. “I call it Apparition.”
They ascended the staircase and entered the first door on the second floor. Harry’s room was disorganised and messy. Books and folders were piled up on the study desk. The bed was unmade and the wardrobe doors were left wide open, the contents haphazardly stuffed inside.
“Wait!” From his pockets, Draco removed his wand and a small item Harry didn’t recognise. He cast a spell on the item; it took him a few tries but it eventually turned into a bouquet of red roses, which he presented to Harry.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “You mean those nights where you and your Gryffindor friends get drunk in a crowded pub and converse so loudly everyone can hear your unsolicited opinions? No thanks. I don’t go to pubs.”
The apothecary stocked an amazing array of products, with multiple sections each offering niche potions or ingredients for sale. They were here to purchase ingredients for the simple medicinal potions Draco brewed and stocked at home.
Robards cleared his throat and waited until he had obtained everyone’s attention before speaking. “As we were just explaining to Potter here, the perpetrator you caught yesterday was using the warehouse to grow various types of plants - many of which are heavily regulated by the Department of Magical British Biota - to use as ingredients. During your skirmish with him, Potter, you destroyed a few crates containing spattergroit spores. Both of you inhaled a dangerous amount of them.”
Harry had prepared him a warm bath, which Draco coaxed Harry to share with him. The water soothed his tired muscles as he leaned back against his boyfriend’s chest, sighing in contentment when Harry kissed his neck and fiddled with his golden hoop earring (a Christmas gift from Harry).
“Are you ready?” Harry asked as he zipped up his duffle bag. He was out of those ugly hospital gowns and in his regular clothes of T-shirt, jumper and jeans.
Draco had been staring into Harry’s eyes, so he immediately noticed when Harry’s gaze dropped to his lips. Draco’s mouth suddenly went dry and he subconsciously sucked in a shaky breath.
Malfoy seems torn between running away and leaning closer. Since the potion makes escaping an unpleasant option, he slumps forward and rests his head on Harry's shoulder. "I hate this, you know."
Before the semester started, Lucius had dragged Draco to meet the basketball coach, who apparently had been his father’s junior in high school. Draco had sat by awkwardly as the two adults conversed over cups of tea, Lucius telling stories about the Malfoy family while Severus Snape remained silent, seemingly unimpressed. Throughout the entire exchange, Snape never once looked at Draco. It was only after they walked out of the front door that Snape had placed a hand on Draco’s shoulder, given him an irritated scowl and pushed him unkindly towards his father’s limousine.
“You’ve been present in many of my wet dreams,” he says, reaching out to touch Draco’s hair, “which have become more and more frequent since we started working together.”
Draco lowered himself onto the armchair, back straight and hands folded in his lap. “I’m fine, thank you,” he said stiltedly.
The gym was enormous, with a high ceiling and tall tiered rows of spectator benches along the sides. In front of them were long benches for the players. The court’s floor, adorned with a large Hogwarts logo in the middle, reflected the harsh lights from above. When the students crossed the gym to reach the coach, their shoes made squeaking noises.
“I’m fine.” Malfoy struggles to speak normally with a blocked nose. “You didn’t have to come here.” He tries to close the door but Harry pushes it back.
As always, the Potions Professor is clad in Slytherin colours, his robes dark green with silver piping and a thick black cloak clasped around his shoulders. A group of Ravenclaw students on their way to the Great Hall briefly bow at him when they pass, wishing him an amiable, “Good evening, Professor Malfoy!” Draco nods back at them, smiling as they scurry along.
Before they exited the waiting room, Potter suggested they grab some snacks from the kitchens. Draco grudgingly agreed; he was feeling bleak and could use some sweets to lift his mood.
Before he could retort, Draco was called to meet Healer Park while Potter went into Healer Algot’s office. Healer Park was a middle-aged gentleman with kind brown eyes. Draco wasn’t too forthcoming, so the Healer just asked him harmless ice-breaking questions. After an hour, the Healer gave him an appointment slip for the following week.
That night, Pansy, Daphne Greengrass and Vincent Crabbe threw a private congratulatory party for the basketball club boys right in Draco’s sitting room. Draco managed to have a decent dinner and play a few rounds of games with his friends before announcing he was going to bed. He had over-exerted both his mind and body during the game, so after he changed and got under the blankets, sleep immediately overcame him until sunrise.
Any talk about souls — extracting, separating, severing — always reminded Harry of Horcruxes. Even when Hermione was explaining to him the plan to save Draco by sending Harry’s soul after him, Harry had been uneasy. Their real bodies — both his and Draco’s — were lying in a ward in St Mungo’s, lifeless and dependent on magic to keep them alive. “Sounds like something you should stay away from.”
Harry contemplated this. He would need to ask his boss for another day-off, or switch his roster around with a colleague so that he would be free that day. He nodded resolutely. “That’s a good idea.”
Harry melted when Draco's lips touched his. The tentative brush, timid and shy against his upper lip, enticed a visceral response so strong, he was almost embarrassed. His toes curled, his heart quickened and hunger roared deep in his belly, compelling him to part his own lips and coax Draco in. He gently sucked on Draco's bottom lip, eliciting a soft, tantalizing moan that struck Harry's core like nimble fingers plucking on harp strings.
The tension in Draco’s muscles evaporated. His eyes wandered over Harry’s stunning smile, light chocolate skin, the sparse stubble along his jaw, his broad shoulders and wide chest. His vocabulary had somehow shrunk over the span of ten seconds, so the only thing he managed to say next was a boring, “Nice to meet you, Potter.”
“You’re entering my private domain. Not even the Federation knows what I’m doing here. At least, not yet,” Draco declares proudly, bringing them to another large door. He presses his palm on a panel which pulls back the doors, allowing them to go through.
Harry took the helmet and slowly placed it around Draco’s head. It felt suffocating at first but got better when Harry lifted the visor, allowing cool air to brush his skin. Draco took a minute to get used to the feeling before pulling down the visor over his own eyes.
Harry wonders what conversation has transpired between the father and son during the short time it took for Harry to walk here. “That’s very generous of him.”
him - but he could never figure out what. And Malfoy was always there, because Harry actively sought him out, purposely coming to work early because he knew that was the time Malfoy arrived at work. He told Malfoy stories because he liked having Malfoy listen with that cool, blank expression of his, even if the other man rarely contributed to the stories. Malfoy still called him nicknames like ‘The Chosen One’ or ‘The Saviour’, but unlike when they were children, the names never sounded condescending. Malfoy made them sound so matter-of-fact, Harry didn’t mind them. He could listen to Malfoy say his name or monikers all day.
“It’s okay. I wasn’t asleep. Just resting,” Harry explained mildly. “Last week you called on a Monday. Today is Tuesday, so…”
Draco always paid when they ate or shopped together. He would be terribly offended if Harry offered to split the bill or worse, pay the bill himself.
His side of the bed is empty. Harry immediately sits up and Summons his glasses, hastily shoving them on. When he can’t find Malfoy in the sitting area, he goes to the bathroom. The door is closed, but there isn't any noise from behind it. Harry knocks on the door. “Malfoy? Are you in there?”
“Why not?” Potter grinned. “Although, I should tell you before we go in…" He stepped closer, and Draco couldn’t avoid gazing into his emerald eyes. “I really like you, Draco. I think I’m in love with you.”
Draco lifted the spells chaining Harry to his chair but before Harry could stand up, Draco pushed him back. He planted his butt on Harry’s thigh, forcing Harry to quickly wrap an arm around Draco’s waist and stabilize him as the latter swung his legs up. Draco wound his free arm around Harry’s shoulders and adjusted himself until his thighs were lying perpendicular on top of Harry’s. When Draco moved the fan, Harry felt the air tickle his own face.
Harry stared at the receiver in disbelief long after Draco had hung up. He had forgotten that he had given Draco his number at the beginning of the semester. He hadn’t expected Draco to actually call, but now that he had, Harry wished he would call every day.
Malfoy scoffs and, after a moment of contemplation, walks over to Harry. When he climbs onto Harry’s lap, removing his bathrobe as he does, Harry’s heart skips a beat or two. Malfoy is beautiful like this: all long legs, acres of pale skin, silky platinum-blond hair and thin pink lips.
He lowered his hands and tried to imitate Lucius, from his smile down to the way he offered a handshake. “You must be the captain, Roger Davies. I’m Draco Malfoy, first year.”
Every student was required to meet either one of the Healers at least once. The first session was marked on each student’s schedule; skipping the session would cost house points and incur detentions.
But Harry barely looked at the Dark Mark. His gaze was fixed on Draco's torso, where three parallel scars ran diagonally from his right hip up to his left shoulder. Harry reached to touch the longest one, his fingers warm.
Harry released Malfoy and pushed him back before quickly hurrying to the bathroom. There was a strong dull ache in the back of his skull. He leaned against the sink, closed his eyes and concentrated on his breathing.
Draco swapped with Goldstein and returned to the court while the other players remained the same. As soon as the second half commenced, they executed their game plan.
“There," Harry said contently, dropping back onto the stool. "I should have done that as soon as I found it.”
“She had that breathing assistance charm on.” Draco gestured to his nose, not appearing to have heard Harry. “I didn’t see any opiates on her medication chart, but there were prescriptions for Nerve Conductor Potions and inotropes. So magic depletion with parasympathetic effects, loss of consciousness and possibly nerve damage… Three millilitres or less…” he muttered as he flipped through a massive textbook. With an excited yelp, he shoved the book into Harry’s chest before disappearing into his storeroom.
to be safe. When it came clean, he studied the writing which looked familiar. It was only after he took out the letter and read the content that he realised why.
"Continue with our humble existence?" Harry quipped, earning a chuckle from Draco. Harry felt his stomach drop.
They don’t manage to make one thousand paper cranes that day, of course, but Teddy manages to fold one entirely on his own without Draco’s help after about twenty attempts. He is so happy with his achievement that he gives Draco a hug, his own hair mimicking Draco’s shade of blond. When Teddy pulls back, he catches Uncle Harry smiling happily at them.
Even though he physically towered above everybody else, Remus was probably the most non-threatening and mild person Draco had ever met. His light brown hair had flecks of grey and his eyes crinkled when he smiled.
“Are you going to tell your dad you’ve won the award?” Harry asked later when they were both in bed with a blanket pulled over both of them.
Harry,” a female voice sighed. Granger, of course. “But that’s not the point. That’s not even a real treatment!”
, dressed in his red and gold Captain uniform and flanked by his two trusted officers – Dean and Seamus – he’s miffed that it isn’t the Captain who greets him, but one of his youngest Commanders.
“For assignments, you will be required to discuss with your partners, but each submission must be made individually,” Professor Scrimgeour explained when all students were paired up. “So don’t even think of slacking off! Today, your assignment will be about The Ten Fundamental Principles of Economics.”
Draco took Harry's hand and asked him to take him home. Harry smiled as they walked towards a future they had chosen: together.
“You’ve always been my wank fantasy,” Draco blurts out before slapping a hand over his own mouth in horror. “Sorry, it’s the potion. Please forget what I said.”
His unfortunate crew had been less prepared for the sudden jump, so there were a number of accidents, albeit nothing serious.
"No, not like that!" Potter pulled at his hair in frustration. "Why is it so hard for you to understand?"
, and nobody else’s. Nobody had told him to like Harry. Everything he felt was born purely out of his own heart and soul. There was also the undeniable rebellious aspect to it, which made the whole notion so much more enticing.
As much as he hated it, Ron was right. After the war, he had a nightmare every night, about everything and anything. He dreamed of being trapped in cupboards again, of being eaten by gigantic serpents, of falling into veils, of his friends dying in his place, of himself dying and never choosing to return. Therapy had helped him, and slowly, the dreams reduced in frequency, until the only nightmares left were of almost killing another boy in a dimly lit bathroom. Those were the only ones his Mind Healer couldn’t help him with.
“Partners!” His voice boomed within the lecture hall, not needing a microphone. “When I read out your names, you must sit with your partner in the seats I designate for you. No changing partners or seats without my permission.”
Harry flopped back down on his pillow. “Full of press conferences with Ron, Hermione and Kingsley. People should
“Are you sure it’s spattergroit?” Potter asked while Draco tried hard not to hyperventilate. “Isn’t one of the common symptoms facial pustules?”
Harry turned just in time to catch Draco in his arms. His green eyes were the last thing Draco glimpsed before his mind plunged into darkness.
Sometimes their eyes would meet during classes or meals — silver with green.  Potter would stare at him, unblinking. Draco was always the first one to look away.
did. He claimed all my work and contributions as his own and painted me as a useless Auror. He wanted to discredit me, and I guess it worked. There are people in the DMLE who still consider me a criminal. And he got the promotion, while I'm still here, like you said, being left behind."
. The Krurians have strategically targeted and conquered dilithium-rich planets, conquering the supply. The Federation and her allies are running out of supply, and without the dilithium, their warp-dependent spaceships’ usefulness would be severely diminished. Having a renewable alternative source of energy would be instrumental in turning the tide around.
Draco groaned, feeling harassed by the torrent of questions. He regretted not getting a driver’s license and his own car before starting university; he could have avoided all this. “Forget it,” he snapped. “I’ll just take the bus.”
The classroom itself is empty and quiet, save for a bubbling cauldron at the corner of the room. Harry makes his way to the back of the class, down a short corridor until he reaches an ornate mahogany door, which he knocks on firmly.
Sirius was almost as fair and tall as Draco but more well-built and charismatic, carrying himself with a casual elegance that reminded Draco of his mother. His long black hair was pulled into a messy bun. When he shook Draco’s hand, his gaze lingered on the younger man’s white-blond hair. “What did you say your full name was?”
Potter,” Draco clarified, rolling his eyes as he slowly pulled his hand out of Harry’s grasp. “I suppose now that you’re involved, I can explain how I got here, while we wait for the Transporter to recharge.”
Lucius had said, when he first learned of Draco’s new interest in basketball, that sports like these were a waste of time for visionaries like the Malfoys. He had been even more annoyed that Draco had played it “just for fun” and had not intended to join any clubs.
Harry’s expression turned sombre. “My parents died when I was a baby. I grew up with my adoptive dad and my godfather.”
It was two days after Draco had walked out of Grimmauld Place; the taller man had not owled or visited since. Harry had tried writing, but words had always failed him at critical moments so all his drafts had been Vanished or angrily ripped apart. Today, he tried again. He searched within himself for values he held dear, Truth and Honesty, and hoped they were enough.
The wards buzzed, alerting him of a presence outside the door. When Harry lifted his head, the house appeared to light up, the air felt cooler. Only one person Harry knew could make the house respond so favourably like this. He leaped off the couch and ran towards the entrance, breathless with anticipation as he opened the door.
Draco was under observation in the general ward for three more days. Harry stayed with him throughout; nobody dared to kick The Chosen One out. The staff even provided him with meals and drinks even though he wasn’t a patient anymore. Refusing them quickly proved to be useless because they kept coming. Every time Harry grumbled about this, Draco just laughed and thanked him for keeping him company, and this would immediately cheer Harry up.
deserve this, to which I say, yes, darling, neither do you.” Draco smiled fondly, reaching for Harry’s arm. “It’s not your fault.”
"As for symptoms, watch out for anything abnormal in your partner and yourself. In an event of an emergency, this Floo is connected only to the decontamination chamber in St Mungo's. Just throw Floo powder and walk in. If either of you enters this chamber, the on call team and I will be immediately alerted. Any questions?"
In August, Draco was sitting under a tree in the university’s park, trying to study, when a shadow fell upon him. His throat clamped up at the sight of Potter’s grinning face.
Draco seemed to be enjoying himself more than usual, the absence of sight making his other senses sharper. His kisses were hungrier, his touches more demanding and the
Draco’s heart skipped a beat. Potter was showing his protective side again, and it flattered Draco in a way he could not explain. "It's fine. He's gone. I'm with you now."
of feelings for him. Even though the blond’s words are still sharp, rude and scathing, his body language is often the opposite. He has a certain smile that he only gives Harry, one that makes his sharp features turn soft and — Harry would never say this word out loud — pretty. His hands, when they aren’t gesticulating or working, often find themselves on Harry’s arms or shoulders. There was
The day they closed the case, they all went out to celebrate — the usual suspects, with the unsurprising addition of Draco. Harry insisted on buying Draco a drink and ignored Seamus’s loud remark —
Before walking away, Malfoy gave Harry a genuine smile, which was both beautiful and surprising, leaving Harry mesmerised and a bit dazed.
“My father is the one with a chauffeur, not me,” Draco clarified, brushing off dead leaves from his jeans. “And I don’t see the point of owning a car when I can’t drive.”
"Don't give up on what makes you happy too soon," she said gently. "I haven't seen The Chosen Git since Hogwarts but from your stories and from what the entire Wizarding World knows about him, I have an idea of how he is. He may be a bit daft, but I can tell he really likes you."
