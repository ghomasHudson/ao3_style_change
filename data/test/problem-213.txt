Carter's robes turned from white and black to red and black. He smiled as some students from the Gryffindor table clapped. Most however, just pointed and whispered.
"Why not just take that money elsewhere anyways and cripple the economy?" Carter asked. "Then we could demand equality and they wouldn't be able to refuse."
“Can I owl you guys?” He asked as he hid his wand inside of his bag.
“Ummm….” Carter said.
Harry didn't even have the strength to respond. He was so tired. His muscles hurt.
Harry nodded. He would have to read more books on the war. He needed to know what the goals of the war were, and he needed to know more about Dumbledore. He would attend Hogwarts, which was under Dumbledore’s control. If his parents thought it was necessary to warn Harry about Dumbledore, he needed to learn everything he could about the man he was dealing with.
OTHER EQUIPMENT
Carter spoke, and Harry could move again.
Amon was suspicious of Harry. He watched Harry's every move, and never let him get too close. "I'm not your enemy," Harry promised him. "Soon enough you will trust me."
"Who the hell do you think you are!!" Vernon shouted. "You're not wizards, and you sure as hell don't have any money!"
Carter allowed himself to be led away, but continued shouting. "Just wait and see Malfoy! Soon enough we'll know who is the best."

Carter looked concerned, "Are you okay?" He whispered while glancing towards the living room.
"Boys! Get out here and make breakfast!" Petunia yelled into their room a few days later after unlocking the door.
"Practicing, or writing to Neville?" Harry asked.
Carter then stuffed the extra water bottle, the two-pound coin, and the can of peas underneath a loose floorboard they had found a year ago under Harry's bed.
Vernon spoke then, "How… how much money?"
Harry collapsed onto his bed as he heard the lock click shut for the night. Carter leaned over him, looking very worried. "Harry?"
Professor Snape took a moment to glance over the first year students. Harry thought his maroon eyes lingered on him a moment longer than the rest of the students, but he couldn’t be sure.
They were the last two students to enter the potions classroom. Harry frowned when he saw Draco Malfoy standing in front of Snape's desk, whispering furiously.
"Really?" He whispered.
“All students must swear an oath to keep the societies a secret from incoming students, whether they are members or not” Alexander replied, having overheard her. Pansy blushed. “An oath that you will be required to take tonight before you return to your common rooms tonight. Now, as dark magical users, each of you will have an opportunity to join the Order of the Masked Dragons. Those who wish to join will be required to compete in several competitions throughout the first few months of the school year.”
Carter clapped loudly and gave Neville a high five as he joined him at the Gryffindor table.
“Woah,” Pansy whispered. “Why have I never heard of this before?”
They agreed and set off in different directions to explore the trunks.
"Dumbledore," Harry breathed, not meaning to say it out loud.
He wished more than anything his parents had survived whatever war they were fighting. One lone tear escaped and slid down his cheek. He quickly swiped it away. He didn't like crying.
They each threw on a black robe over their jumpers and hurried back to the front of the store with their old tattered clothing folded under their arms. Madam Malkin had already wrapped up their clothing in large bundles. She tapped each bundle with her wand and they shrunk down to the size of a match box.
He frowned when he realized it was mostly clothing. Baby clothing. He realized it must have been his clothing at some point.
“What if we don’t want to join?” She asked.
Harry smiled and introduced Carter to Neville.
Harry gently took the bone white wand from Rowan. The handle was curved slightly, which made it comfortable to hold. There were black runes carved into the side, and Harry could feel the strong magic thrumming through the wand.
"Don't get me wrong, I love Gryffindor. Not all light Gryffindors are bad. Fred and George, Ron's older brothers are pretty cool. They gave us a bunch of dung bombs last week. Hermione Granger is alright too, she's a first year like us. She's a bit annoying, but she doesn't treat us any differently than she treats the other Gryffindors."
“I got it,” Carter ran back into the room holding a book. “It’s a house elf. A lot of the ancient families have house elves. I guess they are like servants, they cook and clean for you. This elf must be bonded to the Potter family, so you are its master.”
Harry and Carter both ate the carrots, grapes, and almonds before drinking from one of the water bottles.
Neville blanched. “Our parents were close friends. They were all part of Dumbledore’s inner circle.”
on Harry when his back was turned, so I used it on him."
"What do you want?" he hissed.
The man, who Harry assumed must be Rowan, waved for them to follow him. They followed him into a grand back room with tables full of wood sticks and random objects he couldn’t identify.
He picked an apple and a granola bar, and Carter grabbed a few different pieces of fruit.
He closed his eyes as a wave of cool, calming magic washed over him. He felt the castle's welcome in his heart. It became part of him, and he knew it would never leave him no matter where he went. Hogwarts would always be part of his family.
Harry and Carter only just joined the magical world over the summer, and now that world they had fallen in love with was turning against them. It was devastating.
A nervous looking girl walked quickly forward to take a seat. McGonagall placed a ragged looking brown pointed hat on her head. The hat was silent for only a moment before it shouted, "Hufflepuff!"
Properties:
"That's fine," Harry agreed quickly. He wanted to be able to access his money anytime. Plus it was the safest way to carry his money. The Dursleys would never be able to access it.
The castle's lights glittered as they reflected on the lake. It was as if a thousand stars had stationed themselves in the water to guide them to their new home.
Carter on the other hand, loved studying history and French. He was very good at learning other languages, and he enjoyed writing too. There was a stack of mismatched papers underneath the floorboard in their room where Carter kept a journal.
"Ahh hello children!" one of the ghosts said as he approached. "Welcome! Welcome!"
Once they were gone, Harry turned to Snape to find the man already looking at him with blank, maroon eyes.
Neville looked at his ticket and guided them to the front row.
Angelina Johnson was the new queen of the Society of the Ivory Rose, appointed at the start of the year. She was a Gryffindor 4th year, and she was feared by every dark witch and wizard at Hogwarts. Except for Adrian Pucey of course. According to Pansy, Adrian and Angelina despised one another.
"Right here," Harry stopped outside of Knockturn Alley’s quidditch supply store.
SLYTHERIN!"
Carter perked up, “We have to go Harry.”
"And you were able to access your vault, correct?"
The shopkeeper glared, but didn't say another word. He wasn't about to miss out on such a big sale. Between Carter and Harry, he would probably make more money in one day than he normally would in a week.
"You elevated at a particularly young age Mr. Potter. You must be extremely cautious. There will be people who see you as a threat as you grow more powerful."
carved into the wood.
Carter sighed, "You're sweating, you have a fever."
He remembered Petunia opening his eye at one point in time, which he found quite odd.
Harry nodded, "I definitely noticed a power increase, and it's easier to cast spells, that's for sure."
Anger filled him as he considered this. He just left the muggle world, filled with hate and fear behind, just to enter another world filled with hate and fear. How was that fair?
“Well,” Neville leaned forward in his seat, and Carter and Harry followed suit. “This isn’t public knowledge, but my gran told me Lord Dumbledore trapped Lord Voldemort’s entire inner circle. The rumor is that Voldemort cared deeply for his inner circle and he tried to rescue them. But of course that’s what Lord Dumbledore was hoping for. I don’t know anything else though. I doubt anyone really knows the truth, other than the people who were there.”
Harry Potter Trust : 135,000 galleons
There were red trunks, black trunks, blue trunks, and green trunks. Trunks that looked to be made of pure gold, and some that were almost translucent. Harry had no idea why anyone would want a translucent trunk, but it wasn't his business.
“Come on Harry get up. We got our letters!”
The prefects guided them back into the Slytherin common room and pointed towards two sets of stairs,
They each pulled out their tickets and handed them to the man. He looked at them critically before handing them back and letting them through.
Potions storage compartment
Draco looked at the trunk, sneered again, and stomped across the room to the other bed without a word.
"Honestly I have been thinking the same thing. I have been trying to come up with a plan," Harry admitted.
'Arithmancy for Beginners'
“I is Poppy Master sir,” the elf nodded vigorously.
"I think I'm ready," Neville said nervously as he put down the book.
He was glad to learn his parents weren't drunks, and that they actually wanted to protect him. He was angry that they left him with people who hated his very existence. And on top of it all, he was extremely surprised to learn he was a wizard, and that there were other people like him.
The boats made their way under a large stone bride, and suddenly Hogwarts was revealed to them.
Harry wasn't nervous per se. He had never spoken to Snape directly, so he was more concerned about a bad first impression.
They also went to the nearest Tesco and bought nonperishable food and bottles of water to store in their trunks.
Neville blushed, “No. My gran said I have to wait until I’m 11 to get my wand from Ollivanders like all of the light witches and wizards.”
Carter huffed. "Yeah good luck with that. Neville said they hate us. Why would they teach us to defeat them? We are the enemy."
Neville nodded in understanding. "You guys are lucky. My grandmother never leaves me alone, and she always criticizes everything I do."
"Slytherin," Harry said without hesitating. He knew it was where he belonged. Cunning, ambition, leadership, resourcefulness… It all fit.
The crowd roared to life suddenly as the Balleycastle Bats team flew onto the pitch side by side. Bright red fireworks exploded in the sky above them, the sparks taking the shape of a bat.
Draco Malfoy, Theodore Nott, and Pansy Parkinson were all sorted into Slytherin.
Class began, and they set out to make their potions.
Harry nodded and smiled, he could read between the lines. He needed to start practicing as soon as possible. Otherwise, he would have no way to protect himself. They would have to go to Rowan's before they returned to the Dursleys tonight.
"No, when you join the order." Harry smirked. "We are all obviously going to win whatever competitions they throw at us."
As the prefect said the password, the stone wall clicked and began to slide to the left. They followed the prefect through the entrance, down a short, narrow corridor until they entered an open, cavernous room.
Harry just grabbed his shoulder and dragged him over to the book shop while hiding his smile. "I try my best."
"You guys really wanted the best trunks, didn't you?" Neville asked with a shy smile.
The last part was said out loud, and Harry looked down as his robes turned green. Cheers broke out from the Slytherin table, and Harry moved quickly to sit next to Pansy. Dumbledore's stare followed him to the Slytherin table. Harry just hoped it wouldn't follow him for his entire Hogwarts career.
Harry turned back to Carter, "Neville is going to help us buy trunks to store our books and then we are going to Florean Fortescue's for ice cream."
"Me too," Carter replied in an equally breathless voice. "I'm sorry you have to room with him."
A translucent wall of crystal formed in front of him, and Harry could immediately tell this shield was stronger than the last one. Harry also shifted into a dueling stance, “
There were also rare emblems, like spell crafting, ritual magic, strategy, necromancy, elemental magic, alchemy, and wandless magic.
"You will soon enough. Until then, don't draw too much attention to yourself. You may go. "
“Happy birthday brother,” Harry said quietly.
Neville noticed her too, and grabbed Harry and Carter's hands before pulling them away from her and out the door.
The angry shopkeeper began adding up Harry's books. "Do you even have enough money for this boy," he grumbled.
Neville was really coming out of his shell, and Ron, despite his strange tendency to avoid Slytherins, was also growing close to Carter and Neville. He never joined their study sessions in the library, but Harry hoped he would grow out of that stage soon.
"We are wizards," he told him bluntly, not knowing how else to break that news.
"I think I could end up in Slytherin too," Carter said. "But…"
Eventually the prefects led them to an empty stretch of wall in the dungeons. The prefect pointed towards the ceiling and said, “See that snake there, carved into the ceiling? That’s the indicator for the common room. The password is
"Potter, Dursley, meet me after class."
“Cool,” Carter and Harry grinned. They climbed the stairs and emerged in a curved, red carpeted room. The room was full of rows of cushioned seats, about half of which were full.
“My expectations are high,” he said in a toneless voice. “Don’t disappoint me.”
Whispering broke out, and McGonagall raised her hand to silence them, "The four houses are Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, Gryffindor, and Slytherin. Each house has its own values and notable history. While you are here, your successes will gain you house points, and any misbehavior will cause you to lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points will win the house cup. I hope each and every one of you succeed wherever you are sorted."
"Oh god," Harry whispered, feeling utterly horrified. "Petunia and Vernon?"
Harry shrugged, "I don't care about a stupid rivalry. Do you?"
Harry sat up quickly and tore open the red Hogwarts seal.
He heard a shuffling above him, and Carter appeared next to him a moment later.
on this assignment," Snape informed them before turning to the next student.
“Okay, my grandmother is here already. She didn’t want us to be here alone.” Neville shrugged. “She will be with her friends though so don’t worry about her.”
by Newt Scamander
"I'll believe it when I see it," Draco sneered.
They were on the edge of their seats the entire time, watching as both teams scored over and over. It was a very close match, with the falcons only a few points ahead of the bats.
The three boys found themselves standing outside of Florean Fortescue's a short while later.
Carter began looking through the bag of coins, while Harry sat cross-legged on his bed. He opened the envelope carefully, wanting to keep it intact. His hands shook a little as he unfolded the letter.
"Yes." Snape nodded. "He is one of them."
by Adalbert Waffling
The last person to be sorted was Blaise. It was no surprise when Blaise's robes turned green and he joined them at the Slytherin table.
"What's your name?" Harry asked.
The three of them set out again. This time Carter found his first, a white feather. Harry and Neville found their cores at the same time. Harry’s was a blood red piece of string, while Neville’s was a piece of bone.
“Are you sure you want to end up there?” Blaise asked, looking at Carter. “Gryffindor is full of light witches and wizards. You might find it… difficult there.”
He leaned over the side of his bunk, gravity making his blond hair stand up straight. "Goodnight Harry."
Malfoy's face turned an even darker shade of red. He was quiet for a long moment before he finally gave a quiet, "Yes."
“They died alongside mine,” Neville confirmed sadly. “I’m so sorry you didn’t know.”
The prefects nodded and gestured for the first years to follow. Harry looked to Blaise and Pansy with a confused expression. They just shook their heads with equally confused faces.
Vaults:
by Arsenius Jigger
When all of the students were seated, the bearded man pointed out into the lake and yelled, "Forward!"
Lola walked over to them several minutes later, "Have you guys decided?"
"Anytime," she winked. "We have to stick together."
He shook his head, "We don't have much left."
It was just before Christmas when ten year old Harry began to fall ill.
Carter and Harry looked at each other, then looked back to Neville. “We are going to Rowan’s in Knockturn. Do you want to come with us? Your gran doesn’t have to know.”
The students all turned to look at them, and Harry noticed how segregated between the houses they were. The entire Slytherin table was dark. All of the students were either Tiger Eyes, Amber's, or Carnelians. The Ravenclaw table was largely dark as well, but he did see a couple light witches and wizards mixed in. Hufflepuff and Gryffindor were almost entirely light. All of the students he saw sitting at those tables were either Emeralds, Sapphires, or Amethysts.
"No idea," Harry shrugged. "Hopefully soon."
Harry unlocked their bedroom door, which he noticed was a lot easier now. Prior to getting sick, it was very difficult for him to open the door. Now it was as simple as breathing.
(See the end of the chapter for
Carter continued on through the fake wall, with Harry and Neville following closely behind him. The darkness went on for several steps, but then they suddenly found themselves in a bustling shopping district. There were mothers holding their children's hands, men leaning against a stone wall chatting casually, friends enjoying coffee and tea in the gardens of a tea shop. It looked perfectly safe and happy.
Harry nodded, “Yeah it’s true.”
Obsidian knives left his wand at a high velocity and struck the dummy directly in the center of its chest.
Harry took it from him and read the headline,
"If the Ministry finds out we don't have guardians they will send us back here," Harry pointed out.
Harry pointed his wand at one of the black dueling dummies and said
"Harry you're awake -," he paused with wide eyes.
Carter's owl, a brown speckled Eagle-Owl was much friendlier than Amon. Her name was Lenna, and she enjoyed spending most of her time on Carter's shoulder.
Snape’s eyes left him and he continued speaking, “The third rule is simple. Work hard and do well in all of your classes. If anyone is struggling in a subject, I expect them to work with an older student. I do not accept failure in Slytherin house.”
Now Blaise was staring at them as if they were puzzles he needed to solve. “A dark Potter who has already elevated to Amber, and a dark muggleborn. Very interesting,” he mumbled to himself as if they weren’t even there.
The dizziness was still there and it was making him feel a bit nauseous, but now he felt a heavy weight in his bones. He was exhausted.
Both Carter and Harry returned his grin, “Wow we really do have a lot in common,” Harry said.
Harry felt extremely nervous as he walked to the front. He looked up as he approached the stool and found Dumbledore staring at him. Due to his strange eyes, it was hard to tell where the man was looking, but Harry just
Carter found his a few minutes later, a pale wood, but Harry was having trouble. Every wand he touched felt cold and dead. He could tell they weren’t meant for him. After about 10 minutes he felt like giving up. Maybe he wouldn’t find one today.
His books confirmed everything Neville had said in Diagon Alley about classifications. Harry memorized the different eye colors and the average age a witch or wizard ‘elevated’. He learned that ‘elevating’ was the term used for when a witch or wizard’s eye color changed, and their power level increased. He also learned that his illness several months prior was simply his magical core expanding. He found witches and wizards are usually sick for several days during the expansion process.
Their boat gently touched the shore, and their small group followed the rest of the students up the steps towards Hogwarts.
"Your eyes…"
Dumbledore sat in a high backed chair in the middle of the professors table. His eyes were completely white, and they were so bright that Harry could see them clearly from across the room. He was the only known Moonstone in the world.
Rowan shook his head, “Be patient lad. Sometimes it takes time to find the perfect match.”
'Magizoology: Animals of the Magical World'
As the first years formed a half circle around the prefects, a dark haired man Harry recognized from the professors table at dinner emerged from the shadows.
"Fine, fine. When we join the order, they will probably avoid us even more than usual."
It was Harry's first time ever really having friends. Before Hogwarts, he only ever had Carter to talk to.
Harry and Carter turned to see Draco slide off the stone ledge he had been sitting on.
Advanced wards: Prevents the trunk and its contents from being damaged by violent intent, misuse and time. If someone attempts to break into the trunk, the owner will be notified by a note written on the lid. Anyone attempting to break in will be cursed with silver hands for three days. The owner will be able to lock the trunk in place with a password. No one but the owner will be able to move the trunk once locked in place. (13 galleons)
After putting the floorboard back in place, Carter climbed into the top bunk.
Harry read the letter over and over again. He was overwhelmed by so many different emotions.
Carter and Harry both filled out Gringotts transfer slips to transfer Madam Malkin 45 galleons each. Then she measured them with a floating tape measure and asked what colored clothing they wanted.
“I know,” Harry smiled. It didn’t feel real. They were free of the Dursleys, and they would never have to see them again if Harry had his way. They could study magic freely and learn new spells, they could practice dueling, and eat whatever they wanted. The Potter flat felt like paradise.
Harry nodded, and Neville helped him carry his massive pile of books up to the counter.
Whispers broke out across the room. “What’s that?” Carter asked Neville, but Neville just shook his head in confusion.
They followed McGonagall through the grand wooden doors and into a large dining hall. There were four tables filled with students, each of them wearing four different colors, green, blue, yellow, and red. There was also another table at the front of the hall where the professors sat. However, Harry was most impressed by the ceiling of the hall, which was charmed to mimic the weather outside. He had read about it in
"Harry," he reached out his hand and Neville shook it. "Say Neville, my cousin and I just recently learned about magic, and we honestly don't know much about… well, really anything I guess. Would you mind explaining some things for us maybe?"
"You really want them to get away with our money?" Harry asked.
The boy stared right at Harry, "You're an Amber?" he said in a disbelieving tone. "How exactly did you manage that?"
He swallowed thickly and looked to Carter who appeared to have noticed the same thing. "Are you sure about Gryffindor?" he asked.
Vernon glanced at Petunia, and Harry laughed, "Oh so she didn't tell you. My parents were very influential. They had a lot of friends, so I wouldn't try anything with us."
'Communication in the Magical World'
"Here you go, " Harry whispered gently as he held out a treat. His newly adopted black Great Horned Owl, Amon, named after the Egyptian God, reached out carefully and snapped up the treat.
Harry nodded in agreement. Besides the strange speech, it was unnerving to see a man with entirely white eyes smile. It was hard to tell if the smile was genuine or fake. He assumed it was fake.
"Creepy," Blaise whispered, and Harry nodded in agreement.
interested. He wanted to stand out. Perhaps his ambition was getting the best of him. Maybe it would put a target on his back, but maybe it would help him in the end.
Lola and another wizard used (what Harry now realized were) wands, to make the alterations to their trunks.
The three boys shrugged at one another and began circling the room, trying to find their wands.
Harry and Carter were opposites in terms of appearance. Harry was shorter, with black hair while Carter was tall and blond. The only similarity between them was their eyes. They both had brown eyes with bright flecks of gold.
He read through the nights, barely sleeping over the two weeks. There was just so much to learn. He read about Hogwarts houses, and wizarding forms of communication and transportation. He read about wards, ancient runes, goblins, potions, charms, and transfiguration.
"Yeah me too."
Magic Archetype: Dark
“Hey back,” Carter nodded. “Do you know why we are here?”
Harry shook his head, “We have our trunks.”
“Okay maybe you’re right,” Carter smiled and released the shield.
Draco's face flushed with anger, "How dare you…"
They both nodded. Harry and Carter had purchased a book on flo travel earlier that summer. Thankfully, the book had moving picture diagrams.
“Are you guys ready?” Neville looked at them both with a nervous grin.
Harry mouthed silently to him. Carter shook his head, and the two of them climbed the ladder.
"No clue," Harry shrugged. Pansy tried to follow them one time but almost got caught, so she had to leave.
He opened the door and found a spacious room, decorated similarly to the Slytherin common room. Nearest to the door, there were two beds, one on each side of the room. Beside each bed was a nightstand, a desk, and a wardrobe.
"He's right Draco," Blaise chimed in. “You don’t want to become
Harry also read that Voldemort was well known for his large number of rare emblems. He was known to have spell crafting, wandless magic, necromancy, ritual magic, dueling, parseltongue, ancient runes, and strategy emblems.
Harry closed the book. "Well that's rather obvious isn't it? They want to keep an eye on us. I also read that dark witches and wizards hold quite a bit of the wizarding world’s wealth. If Dumbledore kicked us all out of Hogwarts, we would find other ways to educate ourselves. My guess is the Ministry wants that money to stay in the UK. If we all went to school elsewhere, they would lose a significant amount of wealth."
Blaise interrupted. "Harry, Carter, Neville, this is Draco Malfoy and Theodore Nott." He gestured to the brown haired boy beside Draco.
Harry looked over the tables and soaked up the information. So he was an Amber? He pointed to the table, “I’m not supposed to be an amber until I turn 14? Then how…?”
Together, the three of them made their way to the back of Diagon Alley where they found a very dark, narrow walkway. Neville looked nervous, but Carter confidently led the way through. They eventually came to a solid wall of black stone. They looked around for the entrance, but couldn’t seem to find one.
Harry didn't get the opportunity to talk to Carter after the meeting, so he vowed to find him the following day to ask his opinion about the upcoming challenges.
"I might just take your advice," he said. "Thank you."
“I think it's your wand,” Harry reassured him. “Rowan did say it would take a while for your wand to bond to you. You just need to keep practicing.”
Neville's expression was determined when it was his turn to sit on the stool. The hat was silent for a long while, much longer than any of the other students.
"Bloody tosser," Harry hissed as he stood and brushed off his robes. "He's a spoiled little brat. Thanks for the help."
He tried to move his arms and legs, but he couldn't even blink.
(See the end of the chapter for
"And with whom am I speaking?"
Most of all he was sad. There was a whole world he didn't know anything about.
He handed it to Rowan who swallowed thickly. “Alright then,” he said after clearing his throat. “Now you must pick your core. Do the same things with the other tables until you find it.”
"Boys, you will stay here and complete your list of chores," Petunia lectured them for the tenth time that morning. "They better be finished when we return."
by Miranda Goshawk
"Yes," Harry rolled his eyes. Carter could be so overprotective. "I don't give a toss about them. They're irrelevant."
He looked to Carter with a smile on his face, and noticed Carter smiling sadly. Harry realized Carter thought Harry wasn't going to need him now that he had money. Harry quickly made a decision. He turned to Leznek once again. "I would like to open an account for Carter and transfer him 40,000 galleons from my trust fund."
They finished their jobs for the evening and Petunia rewarded them with a slice of bread. Harry ate his quickly before they retreated to their room.
“My grandmother bought us all tickets to the top box as a surprise for our birthdays” Neville explained. “We are going to have the best view of the match!”
Thanks for reading!!!
"Very well, follow Leznek and he will verify your identity and get you a key."
Harry put a hand on Carter's shoulder, "Hey, we will be okay, I promise."
Harry rubbed his knees briefly, “Yeah I’m okay.”
Harry noticed an elderly woman approaching them from their left. She was wearing an absurdly large feathered hat and purple robes.
He had to figure it out.
“Great, so what was I saying before? Oh wait, I remember. You asked why you became an Amber at such a young age. It has to do with the upper and lower power levels. So for dark witches and wizards, Tiger eye, Amber, and Carnelian are the lower power levels. Jasper, Pyrope, and Obsidian are the upper power levels,” Neville explained. “So each power level is six times more powerful than the previous level. Because of this, most witches and wizard’s magical cores stop expanding when they reach Carnelian and Amethyst. Though, when a witch or wizard is going to peak in one of the upper power levels, their magical core expands quicker than normal. They say your magical core stops growing completely once you turn 20 years old, so I think that's why powerful witches and wizards grow more powerful more quickly.”
"Bloody hell Harry. Can you teach me that?" Neville looked both terrified and hopeful.
Harry definitely wouldn't want to be Carter's enemy. He was both cunning and brave. Idiots like the Dursleys didn't stand a chance against him.
“My parents too,” Harry smiled, remembering what his parents wrote in their letter. They picked a random direction and began walking, trying to find Rowan’s Wand Shop.
Carter shrugged, “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
And read.
The goblin sat behind a desk and motioned for them to sit. He then removed a small silver dagger and a piece of parchment from the desk. He passed the dagger to Harry. "In order to verify your identity, we must conduct a blood test. Pick your finger with the dagger and allow three drops of blood to fall onto the parchment."
“My mother said the last Crimson War never really stopped. After Lord Voldemort was captured and taken to Crowmark, the battles were fought in the courtroom rather than on the battlefield.”
And beside the other bed on the right side of the room was a door, which Harry quickly realized was a small bathroom when he pushed the door open.
“We can try it,” Carter shrugged.
Neville nodded, “Okay, I will just see you here for our birthday then?”
“No,” Harry shook his head. “Plus I don’t think that is a good idea. Our aunt wouldn’t like it if owls started showing up to our house.”
Rowan passed a box to each of them. They opened their boxes, and Rowan picked up Carter’s pale wand, “Aspen and thunderbird tail feather, 12 inches. A dueler's wand. You must be strong minded my boy. You will make a fine warrior someday. Keep in mind, it may take some time and practice before this wand bonds to you completely, but once bonded it will be more loyal than any friend." Carter beamed at the elderly man.
They spent the morning buying their school supplies in Knockturn Alley before settling down at the 'Carnelian Corner Café' next to Knockturn's quidditch shop.
“We will just get the wands and come right back. I promise,” Harry said as he stood with a smile. “Let’s go.”
UNIFORM
Quidditch compartment
Carter grinned, "That sounds great. Thanks Neville."
A shorter girl with dark hair approached their group, "Actually my father said there are more dark witches and wizards in our year than light witches and wizards. I'm Daphne Greengrass by the way."
It took them about 10 minutes of walking, but eventually they came across a shop with the words ‘Rowan’s Wand Shop’ written in silver.
He slowly sat up in bed, and gasped at what he saw. He realized he hadn't been dreaming, the bedside table had been destroyed. But so had the bedroom door, and their lamp in the corner.
They gave each other serious looks before nodding. Harry took a deep breath. They were doing this.
Carter and Harry paid for their trunks via Gringotts transfer. In total, both Carter and Harry paid 160 galleons for their new trunks. It was expensive. Harry felt extremely guilty about spending so much money in one day, but everything he purchased would be useful. He knew they were very behind in terms of magical knowledge. Everything they bought today would help them change that.
Harry rolled his eyes, and they quietly sat behind Pansy and Blaise.
Harry nodded, “Okay, how do we get there?”
Harry glared at him and cast a privacy spell, "Don't get caught doing something stupid. We can't become powerful wizards if they expel us."
“Yes,” Carter responded lightly.
Harry sat there with his wand pointed at the creature, waiting for Carter to come back. It was unnerving. The creature was staring at him as if it… loved him? He wasn’t sure what that meant.
Time passed quickly as the four of them read and talked about the upcoming year. Soon enough the sun had set and they were changing into their school robes.
“I didn’t have trouble with the other spells,” Carter shrugged.
Harry smirked and began unpacking his trunk.
Draco's jaw dropped, and the others snickered.
Neville found his first, a golden brown piece of wood. He handed it to Rowan who nodded, “Chestnut, yes yes.”
"I know," Harry replied. "But let's go. We have a lot of shopping to do before the Dursleys get home."
"Yes sir," Harry said as convincingly as possible. He couldn't trust Snape with the truth. He refused to go back to the Dursleys. Not now that he finally had a real home in Diagon Alley.
"I don't know enough to protect myself sir."
After leaving the quidditch supply store they returned to Diagon Alley. Harry pulled out the parchment given to him by the goblins, which explained how to access his parents flat.
"At least we don't have to cook or clean?" Carter shrugged.
Lily and James both died during the mission.
A bell rang as they stepped inside the shop, and they were greeted by a friendly elderly woman. "What can I get for you boys?"
Carter smiled. "Yes it is, and we are going to see the magical world. That sounds more fun than the zoo."

Stan didn't seem to care however. He gestured for them to sit before shouting, "Take it away Ernie!"
“So you work for me?”
"Yes it's true, it hasn't happened in almost four centuries." Daphne leaned forward and whispered, "I even heard a rumor that there is a dark Weasley in our year."
“Neville, you are a dark wizard,” Harry smiled. “You can hide it in your trunk. Then maybe we can practice together?”
"Merlin," Harry breathed.
"How much?" Carter asked.
"Well then what happened?"
Harry looked down at his own baggy clothing and nodded. "Yeah they might just kick us out if we go in there like this."
Harry sighed. “But I’m trying to help him.”
"It's not like I'm getting hurt on purpose," Harry said. His legs were wobbling uncontrollably on the bed.
Potter shrugged. “If you want, but don’t expect me to teach you.”
Harry cut him off. “You thought it would be nice?” Harry raised his eyebrow. “Malfoy, are you trying to ask me out on a date or something?”
“I’m not sure that will be enough. I’d still have to select which songs to play.”
“Did you download the function menu options from our website, by any chance?”
“How many times must I ask you to call me Minerva, Harry?” McGonagall asked as she finished off what she had been writing and looked up at him.
Draco sighed. “She still needs to learn to be more composed in public.” Hermione meant well most of the time, but she spent so much time in Muggle London these days she often forgot how famous they all were back in the Magical quarter.
“Why would Malfoy bring a date here, of all places? We are talking about the same person, aren’t we?”
“Yes.”
"You Apparated us here," Draco said. "It's not like I had a choice."
Harry narrowed his eyes at his friend. Ron hardly ever chose the tea house for his quiet time out of the office.
“Does that mean he’ll be home soon?”
Draco had to remove five clusters of Dark magic residue; three from different areas of his torso, one from his head and the other from his wand hand.
Harry was thrown into more violence than before, and it only progressed to get worse. This, of course, meant Draco's life only became more complicated form his father's side.
Then mortification settled into the deepest pits of his belly, forcing him to stand from his place on the floor.
"No- it wasn't me." He said quickly, far too quickly. He felt like a small child then as he backed up, watching as Harry followed in his stead and stood by the rails.
His heart thudded loudly in his ears.
He bit his bottom lip hard, his teeth digging into the flesh as he suppressed a broken cry.
He had always been in awe of him every before they had met, and he’d never forget the promise he’d made himself that he would have Harry Potter at his side.
He'd never  been able to watch Harry's expression when the note would come to life upon being opened, but he relished in the talk of his "messages" in the Great Hall.
Now he was starting to become horribly gaunt.
The tears seemed never-ending and only fell much faster.
"Don't pretend you don't know." Harry said bluntly, unmoving from his place by the doorway. He seemed unsure of himself though, as if he hadn't quite thought out exactly what he was doing there.
He didn't want any part of this.
Fondly, he recognized the feeling.
He swallowed hard.
He's forever remember the face of a horrified Harry covered in blood and grime. He would undoubtedly remember the way his screams had left his ears ringing for the next couple of hours. He would remember the way his shoulders wracked with sobs as he bent over Cedric's dead body, his hands clutching onto the shirt of the dead boy.
He wouldn't ever tell anyone that he didn't bat an eye when the Hufflepuff died that same year. He couldn't help but feel a small sense of relief and a bit of pity.
He blinked quickly, clearing up his vision as best as he could.
He could manage an arranged marriage.
"Stay with me for a bit."
His dimples had made an appearance.
Harry had sat next to him silently, listening to him as he spilled his troubles. A reassuring hand was at his back, rubbing circles.
He had looked so small- he hadn't ever seemed small before. He was always standing out, but Draco had never truly realized just how small he had been. He was still the thin boy from before, still short and average in stature. His hair, as messy as ever, stuck up in all directions, as if he'd rolled around in bed before leaving to explore the tower. His personality, though, made him seem smaller in moments like these. He wasn't that boy filled to the brim with fire and fight, no, he was just a quiet boy forced into the role that screamed loud.
As they climbed the stairs leading to the Great Hall, Harry said, “You know you still haven’t really told me why you kept McGonagall hiring you a secret from me.”
Harry held out his elbow for Hermione to take and they walked over to the bar. The bartender handed them each glasses of punch. Hermione turned back towards where they were dancing and seemed to be directing her gaze to someone in particular. “I’m quite sure you’ll like this admirer, Harry.”
And checking it twice;
It was past six o’clock when Draco declared he was finished for the day.
There. He'd said it.
Their drinks arrived along with some bread and butter and the waiter took their meal order. Draco pondered his next question as he buttered and ate a slice of fresh, warm sourdough.
why you brought your tea to
Kreacher appeared at Draco’s elbow carrying a tray and placed a bowl of muesli and yoghurt in front of him. He then took Harry’s empty plate and popped away again with a crack.
“Yes. He said he’d try and that he wants to spend our first Christmas together.”
Harry didn't need his glasses to know it was Draco who had come to treat him, but he tried to search for them anyway. He wanted to see what Draco was going to do to him.
With the Christmas holidays fast approaching, I’d like to extend an invitation to our celebrations to our Muggle friends at the Daily Telegraph and The British Library. I need you to organise the invitations and a strictly non-magical celebration to be held on Friday 15th December. I’ve attached the guest list for you.
“Would you look at that,” he exclaimed. “Guess we should check out what’s causing it.”
With the kids jingle belling
As it came towards Harry, it was flying a bit too low for comfort and everyone was ducking or moving out of its way. Harry stepped back and his foot landed in a puddle of punch making it slip out from under him, causing him to fall back and hit the back of his head on the bar. He blinked and felt his body hit the ground before everything went black.
“Dinner with wine and music, I heard,” Hermione said. “Sounds like a date to me. At least the way Harry told it.”
"So you ended up in St. Mungo's again, Dad?" asked Albus after they arrived at Harry’s flat for the last week of the summer.
Ron entered the elevator and turned around with his eyebrow raised. “Yeah?”
“How many people are you catering for?” Amelia asked.
at the party. Best to stick to the classics,” Harry said.
“How did you find out?”
“I know what it’s like to be on the receiving end, remember. And there has to be some positives to being famous.”
what he was writing about? Although, maybe he should he tell Draco he was planning to testify for him.
Harry seemed to read his mind because he had moved his legs so they were spread wide in the air, thighs closer to his chest, which gave the blonde the best access to his hole. Draco grinned and quickly leant over Harry’s body to capture his lips in a strong, loving kiss before pulling back again to align the head of his dick up with the prepared orifice.
It didn’t take long for Draco to feel Harry’s release over his hand along with the tightening of Harry’s hole around his own dick. After that he was on the edge himself and he only managed a few more quick, hard thrusts before he found his own release.
“If you don't mind,” Draco said with a resigned tone.
“No,” Harry said, sighing in defeat. He walked out of the office, back past the griffin and down the stairs.
Harry found himself in Hermione’s office the following afternoon at their regular monthly catch-up meetings.
“I dunno. You don’t think Malfoy might have worked it out for himself? I mean, you have seemed to get on pretty well with him at the last few functions you’ve both been at. Wasn’t it the last one where you spent half an hour discussing Quidditch and who should make England’s side for the World Cup?”
Draco was the one to slowly pull back and Harry noticed that his own arms had found their way around Draco’s waist, so the blonde couldn’t go far. Draco removed his arms from around Harry and looked down at Harry’s arms then back up at Harry. He took the hint and awkwardly dropped his hands back to his sides.
Draco looked down at his checklist. “Booking the room, the invitations, decorations for the tree and room. And music.”
“You could have warned me you were about to do that.”
“Harry,” Draco whispered.
“You didn’t have to tell those third years to stop, you know,” Draco said at the first opportunity he had when they were collecting ingredients in Potions.
“Biscuits or cake?”
It was only a minute or so before he caught Draco glancing over his company’s shoulder at him.
Draco stopped thinking and closed the gap between himself and Harry, then he smashed their lips together. The kiss was brief. Draco pulled away before Harry could fully register what he had done.
Draco snatched the form and a quill from the holder full on Avalon’s desk then began writing. “The things I do for you, Potter,” he mumbled under his breath.
Harry seemed to ignore Draco’s words as he fiddled with the MP3 device. “This is the type of music you want,” he said.
Harry gave a fake chuckle, then fixed stern eyes on Draco.
“Evening.”
“You’re not normally this happily distracted in our meetings.”
“Hey, I thought you wanted to meet at Golden Square,” Harry panted. “Why did you walk off?”
Harry looked around to see where the Professor was so he could ask him to transfigure the broom back into a robin. He spotted him with the same person he was trying to get out of his head.
“Yeah, but that was just civilised conversation, small talk. How would he have learned anything from that other than that while we both follow the leagues, we have very different opinions on who is good and who isn’t.”
“I really don’t understand what Harry sees in you,” Ron said, continuing to avoid eye contact with Draco, “but somehow you’ve made him happier than I’ve seen him in a long time.”
“What? Where...? Why…?” Harry couldn’t decide what he wanted to know first, still wanting to keep his feelings to himself.
Before he could ask what Potter had found so funny, Amelia returned to the room with a stack of white parchment in her hand. Potter quickly contained his laughter as she offered half of the parchments to him and half to Draco. Apparently, these were the menu options. Draco started to ask about decorating the Christmas tree, but Potter butted in again. He didn’t appreciate Potter’s rudeness, but he did seem to be gathering the information Draco wanted, so he reluctantly let him speak. This was why he had needed someone familiar with how the Muggle world worked, after all. He was still able to get away with not knowing much about the Muggle world for his job. At least for now.
“I think you’ve been spending too much time alone with Hermione.”
Draco’s length slid into Harry’s hole slowly but surely; each centimetre making it harder for him to resist pushing himself all in with one thrust. When he was finally fully seated, it was only a few seconds before Harry gave a small forward movement with his hips telling the blonde he was more than safe to continue, but Draco was not going to be rushed unnecessarily. “You know, if you would only tell me about your latest case, you might get more influence over pacing,” he said, smirk plastered across his face.
"No, Draco. I'm serious. I was even writing a list of things that show you aren't like your father, or at least show you've changed from what your father wanted you to be."
“True. Harry is a tricky one to buy for. I find the best presents to give him are things money can’t really buy, like something sentimental or homemade.”
Green eyes followed his movements as he relocated the tube out of sight behind them, then lowered himself to place kisses across Harry’s pecs and around each of his nipples. Relinquishing the wrist hold, Draco caressed along the strong crime fighting arms as he moved down the soon-to-be-Head-Auror’s torso, licking and sucking as he went.
“Come on.” Draco took his hand and guided him off the bed, through his flat and out to his own balcony.
“Yes, but you can’t help his parents or at least not Lucius. Anything you say about his father will just incriminate him more.”
“What? Now?” Potter asked. He eyed Draco suspiciously.
Draco could hardly believe it. “Honestly, Potter?” he asked. He refused to believe Granger had told him the truth. He needed Harry to say it.
“While the dragon’s blood laced with bloodroot caused a substantial amount of issues, it was expensive enough to not have spread very far. But with fluxweed and horklump juice being targeted, the indicients of explosions and potion related admissions to St. Mungo’s have increased dramatically. If the rumours that flobberworm mucus is the next target ingredient are true, we need to catch this witch before it gets out into the market.”
device and I have no idea how to use it, let alone have the music play aloud for everyone to hear.”
“No thank you. I’d rather stand.”
“Yeah, well… we weren’t on an important stakeout on those occasions, nor were we out in public.”
“What do I get Harry for Christmas? I know he doesn’t really value big expensive gifts and he seems to have everything he really needs or wants.”
It was little over a week after Draco had sat at his table when Ron approached his desk in the Auror Office. “Hey Harry, you’re report pile is looking pretty low. Is everything alright?”
Harry was happy to see Draco back at Hogwarts after the Christmas break. The Daily Prophet’s articles about the Malfoy trial had been relentless since the verdict. Most of it was still rubbish, but many of the wizards and witches reading it took it as fact and responded accordingly.
Where was Potter? If he didn’t hurry up they weren’t going to be able to visit all the places Draco wanted to go to today. Maybe he should have insisted Granger help him instead. She did work in the same department, after all, and likely would have been on time, or shown up at all, for that matter.
Draco lowered his wand and Harry made to get off the bed. "I'm not finished with you yet, Potter." He searched the trolley and picked up what appeared to be a small cushion and a potion vile. "Can you cough for me, please?"
“Calm down, I’ll be careful. You may still find it hard to believe, but I care about Harry just as much as you do.”
“Speaking of Hermione, neither of you have had any contact with Malfoy lately, have you?” Harry took a bite of his shortbread.
Harry look around them and, without a word spoken, Draco’s parchment turned into sheets of white Muggle paper. His quill was now a pen. “There.”
“Working.”
Feeling a hand roaming his leg and trying to find its way between their legs, Draco grabbed at the wrist and then entwined his fingers with Harry’s. He brought the hand above his partner’s head to pin it on the armrest and continued his assault as he searched out the other hand to join it. “You didn’t think I was going to give up that easily, did you?” Draco asked as he kissed along Harry’s jaw and behind his ear into the dark hair, rolling his hips to create the friction the hand had been searching for.
“I don’t think so, Hermione. I usually don’t.” The music stopped between songs. “Would you like a drink?”
you to do it.”
Less than an hour had passed since Harry left and Draco was now sitting at his desk, quill in hand, trying to write to Hermione. He’d thought about firecalling, but decided against it in case anyone was keeping tabs on the network.
It was past four o’clock before Draco and Potter finished visiting the other three pubs.
“I’ve had to repeat myself seven times already and you keep getting this goofy smile on your face. So who did you have lunch with?"
Draco looked the room over again and nodded. “It could work.”
“You sure?” Ron questioned again.
“Oh, right.” Draco languidly pulled himself up and out of Harry so he could stand. When he did, Harry turned to face Draco and pulled him into a loving kiss.
“I wasn’t planning to.” Hermione gave him a stern look. “What?”
“Of course I am, Potter. That’s why I’ll be in charge. However, we’ll need to ensure it is entirely non-magical and Muggle friendly and I can’t do
“Oh really,” Harry grinned.
Draco was fifty yards down the street when he suddenly felt something heavy land on his shoulder. And someone was panting in his ear. His hand went instinctively for his wand, hidden in his back pocket. He turned sharply, which removed the weight from his shoulder and brought a breathless Harry Potter into his field of vision.
going away on a mission.”
“A date?” Draco questioned. “No, I spent the day with Potter looking for a pub to have our Christmas celebrations at and then tested the food at the best location.”
"Did you feel any pain?"
It had been two and a half years since the Dark Lord’s defeat at Potter’s hands and nearly two years since Draco had been ordered to work at the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes on the Muggle-Worthy Excuse Committee. The idea was that by being forced to work with Muggles, Draco’s mind would be opened to the world beyond the pureblood ideology he had been surrounded with as a child. His enforced placement had only been for a year but when the time had come for Draco to move on, he hadn’t really wanted to leave. He hadn’t been ready to face the rest of the wizarding world on his own, so he had clung to job.
“Now that you mention it, I hadn't really noticed any difference in the decorations,” said Harry. “Only, there was always a lot of mistletoe at the wizarding celebrations I was invited to after leaving Hogwarts.”
“We’re expecting about fifty people.” Draco walked further into the room.
“Nothing. I just need you to examine me for Dark spell residue. It’s an annual work requirement,” Harry said.
“I’m fine, thank you,” Draco responded.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “What’s wrong with you?”
“So what if I am, Potter.” It was Draco’s turn to look away. There was no hiding it now. “Nevermind. Forget I asked.”
Harry paused his pacing for a moment after turning back to Draco again. “Are you sure your wand hasn’t given you any signs of movement or magic in the area?”
“Where are we going?” Draco asked, confused.
Harry’s whole body shook with laughter, making it difficult for Draco to hold on to his composure. Removing his trousers, he tried to step out of them a little too quickly and almost fell forward, but a strong hand grabbed his leg to steady him. He looked down into a loving green gaze and, not wasting any more time, he straddled Harry’s legs once more.
“Those are Falmouth colours,” Harry said. “Are you going to be playing for them?”
Harry was the only person Draco knew who had the skills to work a Muggle laptop, wasn't working in his department at the Ministry, and could be trusted around Muggles. “I don't suppose…”
Draco spent the first half of Sunday writing the invitations for all the Muggle guests as well as for his colleagues. The second half of the day he spent sorting through all the old Malfoy Christmas ornaments. He cleaned or transfigured them, then practiced arranging them on a Christmas tree and around one of the small lounge rooms in the Manor that was roughly the size of the pub’s function room.
“Fine, but surely it's your job to know the family members and partners of the people in the department?”
"Very well, Mr. Potter. If you insist."
Harry maneuvered so his head so it was nestled under Draco’s chin and his arm was wrapped over the blonde’s stomach. The warmth shared between the two naked bodies was comforting to say the least.
"Yeah, right. Whatever, Potter."
Outside the Leaky Cauldron? On the
“Oi,” exclaimed Ron as he slapped his hand on the table and pushed himself up from his seat. “You better not do anything stupid to jeopardise the case or Harry’s safety.”
“With that number, we can either do a sit-down dinner or cocktail style food service. Which would you prefer?”
Harry scoffed. “That’s rich, coming from you.”
“The department doesn’t exactly choose the timing of when their people need to go away for a mission, Draco. Unfortunately, crime seems to increase during the holiday periods and Harry takes his job quite seriously.”
The man shook his head in an entertained fashion, though he took a rather large gulp of wine.
"And she's the only other person in the world who knows about these nightmares? A batty Ravenclaw." Draco asks, closing his eyes.

"You're not really worried about me, Malfoy, you just owe me something: a life debt. And of course it'd look pretty bad if your own dormmate- The Boy-Who-Lived -ended up biting off his own tongue and bleeding out or blowing a bloody wall down in his sleep, would it?"
It was nearly midnight then and both Harry and Draco were happily sober and watching the drunks stumble out of the common room. Over half the party had left and only a handful of students from Gryffindor or Slytherin remained, sipping Firewhiskey and chatting on couches.
Harry enters the room and methodically makes his way to the back class, stepping over empty cases and trying not to slip on loose papers. The practice rooms line the back wall, their interiors extending outwards, only slightly bigger that a broom cupboard. The windows aren't blacked out, but the Harry can't see much inside and the rooms themselves sound-proofed.
"No! NO! Absolutely not!" Draco began to back away but was caught by Pansy.
“Yes!” Draco cried. “This is my designated parking spot which
, he can feel his heart free-falling in love with Draco Malfoy.
Harry presses into the touch, wishing for eternity here in the other boy's embrace but, deep down, he knows there will always be tomorrow and a bright ray of sun to break though their haze. Hesitantly in choked tones he breaks the silence, "We can't keep doing this."
Draco grumbled under his breath, annoyed. "Maybe I just shouldn't go then, hm? Wouldn't want to make you look bad now would we?" the boy lulled, descending the stairs to the from his dorm room.
"Really, Bulstrode, you do realize nothing could make Harry back out now, right? Have you met the stubborn git?"
Slowly the rest of the students made their decisions, many choosing to leave, and in the center of the common room in a small circle left Pansy, Blaise, Millicent, Draco, Theo, and Goyle; and, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Dean, Seamus, Neville, and Luna.
"In the dream we had just finished a Quidditch match and retreated to the locker rooms, alone. We were both sweaty and Draco smelled sweet and kind of musty, but in a really good way, like I remembered him smelling when he won our seeker's game a few months ago and Draco hugged me and left me with a boner." Harry's face was burning like a bonfire and several people were gaping at him. Sweet Merlin, Harry thought as he realized the Veritaserum wasn't going to let him leave out a single detail. Draco was going to hate him.
Harry breathed out a sigh of relief and let his shoulders. “I live in the condo just over here,” he said and began to walk away, expecting Malfoy to follow, but all he heard was a resounding, “Move your car first!”
Draco shakes his head, "That's not funny, Potter. I do care about you. What do I have to do to prove that to you?"
"Thanks for playing along" Draco whispered into Harry's ear before gently kissing his cheek.
car!” He roared.
The girl rolls her eyes, “Whatever you say, Harry. We have about an hour of time left… what do you want to do?”
"Nothing, just testing" Draco smirked as he passed to potion to Harry.
The movement of Harry’s hands halted as Draco’s brain caught up with his mouth and he gasped. “Did I just say that?”
Harry shakes his head roughly, “Oh, I'm sorry Hermione, I didn't even realize. I was actually just looking for you.”
Draco looked around the group with a loathing expression, then stood and walked towards Harry. He plopped down on his knees in front of him and placed a hand tentatively on Harry’s knee.
Draco’s body relaxes under the boy’s arm. After a long, dragged-out silence Harry is sure he hears the blond sniff loudly, a sound suspiciously similar to capitulation coming from his mouth. “Harry Potter, you are the oddest man I've ever met- but you're wrong. I despise Edgar Allen Poe, though I do agree that he was most definitely gay,” The boy untucks his hand and reaches it out to him, “Malfoy. Draco Malfoy.”
“Oh. Oh! Yeah, totally.” Harry runs a hand through his hair, feeling oddly off-balance, “Er, maybe next you'll be teaching the class!”
Harry nodded and raised his bottle, “To being hopeless.”
"I'm strai-" Draco struggled to get the rest of the word out.
The members of the group agreed and each got poured a cup of Slytherin-smuggled Whiskey. Then, the empty bottle was placed in the center of the circle
"How about, before we start,” Seamus said, “we place a little wager…? House against house? Whichever house backs out first loses, and the winning house will be declared the best."
Pansy took his arm as they descended the remaining stairs and entered the common room together. Students from every house were scattered about, talking, drinking, some even staring through the transparent glass wall out into the lake. Even the Gryffindors had made an appearance this time; Finnigan and Thomas stood side by side with their faces and hands pressed against the glass as they made faces at the giant squid. But, unfortunately, no other Gryffindors from his year.
A smile graces Harry’s face as he shakes the frail hand, long bony fingers clasping his. He nods to the boy, “So,
The blond stiffens, his chin digging into Harry's head, "No, I don't. All I know is that every night you break through your own silencing charms in the fit of a nightmare and are barely consolable. You won't talk about it, not to Weasley or Granger or anyone else besides me and you've barely done that. So no, I'm not going to let you push me away now." His arms tighten ever further, "We've moved to far for that kind of nonsense, Harry."
“You can relax, you know. I'm not going to write you up or something.” Harry laughed.
Harry was very close to puking now. He knew he couldn't lie, but he also couldn't hurt his reputation by backing out. He was stuck.
Harry wrapped his arms around the blond instinctively, then released him with a gasp. Draco bent over again, took in the head of Harry’s cock and sucked.
"I'm in." Harry stood and walked towards Pansy and Blaise. Draco smiled happily, this night was turning out much better than he'd planned.
“It's no problem. Not at all,” Harry says as he pulls himself up, the wide-eyed red-head propping a hand underneath his elbow, “I'm sure you're very busy and just- er- didn't see me.”
"I'll do your dare, Thomas." Draco growled.
Pansy laughed. "That was brave, Potter, but believe or not we've had worse. Something with Snape, you don't want to know" Harry shivered, "So the game continues, Harry you chose someone."
“Your face looked a little red. Were you crying?”
“I swear!” Harry said. “And I do feel bad for taking your spot… but this? Were you writing an essay and just happened to be out of quills and parchment?”
Every single, fucking day some ignoramus parked that hideous green truck outside of his condo, in his
"What?!" was all that could be heard.
“I'm not stupid, Potter,” Draco said. “Don't try to trick me with promises of ‘sleep’”
“I'm not ‘mione’, now get out you great buffoon!”
“Ugh, I wish,” Draco lamented. “We would have gotten us all off earlier today if that was the case. But I guess we're all hopeless.”
"Come on Harry, just get it over with. Ginny's not here so you won't risk a pummeling from Weasley. How bad could it be?"
Harry was more than nervous now, but he tried not to show it. But, one look at the smirking Slytherin next to him and Harry knew he couldn't back down.
“Potter! Now I've gotten Merlot on your sofa- Oh just look at it-”
Harry cries out a ‘Thank you!’ to the girl’s retreating figure, shaking his head when she doesn't turn back, too caught up in raptures of her own creation.
“Completely correct,” Pansy giggled, “We’re all adults, which is why we just have to make it less juvenile.”
“It'll wash out,” Harry said nonchalantly, though he giggled, and put his butterbeer down on the end table. “Now how do you get these fancy shoes off.”
Well, Harry thought, most of my secrets have already been plastered on the front page of The Daily Prophet. What else have I got to to lose?
Draco drained his drink and stood up onto the balls of his feet, trying to get sight of the door. It seemed that Gryffindor's resident Golden Boy had arrived. Draco could see him now, at the door, obviously embarrassed by the display.
He opens the first door with caution. The musical notes dull into a soft series of reverberations as the room swallows up the noise like a black hole; the inside is as dark as one too and bathed in silence. Harry hesitantly opens the door wider and, seeing as this wouldn't be the first time he's caught Hermione catching some much needed but ill-timed sleep, calls out into the space and steps in further, letting the door fall closed behind him.
Harry pulled Draco further into his lap and the man clasped a hand over his bicep. Their eyes fell closed as their noses and mouths brushed.
What other civil thing could he possibly have done? There was no rulebook for dealing with illiterate morons who stole parking spots.
Harry laughed. “That's a very different type of precision that has nothing to do with organization. Besides, you've never seen my bedroom.”
"He kept doing that for about five whole minutes and then he took off my pants and he kind of, um, slapped me? Then he lowered himself down, spread me and sort-of… licked me."
Harry scoffs, the forced sound drawing pain from his own chest.
Harry looked at Draco who had now turned completely away from him, and sighed.
“Potter, you can read can't you?”
“You're telling me you really don't have a clue as to who's been dismantling the security system?”
A shiver runs down Harry's spine chilling every part of his body but the patch of skin on the underside of his chin grasped in Draco's calloused fingers.
As he starts to trail off Draco stares up at the curly-haired boy with one raised eyebrow and delicately curved lips.
“It's my dream, of course, but violins are one in a million which just means I have to try even harder to achieve it. Don't get me wrong, I know I can do it, I know it's in me, I just can't find it; that inspiration; that ball of fire and heat and genius. Where the bloody fuck did it go?”
"Draco! Who's side are you on?!" Pansy nearly shouted at Draco, but the blond merely shrugged.
A pitiful sob escapes Harry's lips. The blond squeezes him tighter but remains pensively silent. It's an unspoken rule of theirs: they make it through the night in silence and by the morning it's all forgotten; only it's not all forgotten, not ever. The feeling of being in the thin, blond's arms is what Harry draws on in moments of darkness and in times of weakness when he needs strength and comfort. It's the only thing that keeps him sane in moments like these. He wonders if the other boy could even comprehend just how much this means to him.
Draco chuckles, a bittersweet smile playing on his lips, "Mad as hatters the both us, then."
“Oi, Harry!” he hears from behind, turning on his heel to heed the sound, “I'll see you in Stat, right? You can- erm- ask me if you need any help.”
Feeling a bit flushed himself Harry managed to stammer out a 'No problem' before gulping down his beer. The blond held out his hand, still glaring at the barista and enjoying making Harry squirm, "Let's dance"
"Fucking hell,” Draco ducked his head and let his hand rise further up Harry’s thigh. The man wore no belt, and so he easily unbuttoned his jeans and Harry’s member popped out.
The Slytherin looked over the sea of people again and, trying very hard not to scurry nervously, made his way to the bar and asked, very politely, for a martini. This student serving the drinks looked at Draco with wide eyes and licked his lips. Draco was sure he'd never seen him before.
Draco snickered and made his way over to the door where the dark-haired Gryffindor stood. Maybe he could find some fun tonight yet, even if it was in the form of teasing Harry.
“Of course I do.” Draco rolled onto Harry’s side and placed his arms around him.
Draco’s stomach churned at the phrasing and he flushed. “Don't,” he murmured to himself, “hex him. It's not worth it.”
And not just any truck, a green truck. An ancient, army green minivan with peeling decal flames on its side. How horrid.
“You- oh you- you miserably insistent git- can just live on freely not even knowing what a bloodied Violin is while I live in constant pain because of the bloody instrument! Un-fucking-believable!” With this the blond bursts into tears, his raspy breaths unintelligible to even Harry and his shudders almost nightmarish.
Draco snarled, then, suddenly optimistic, he said, "Actually, I've just come to get my boyfriend a drink. Isn't that right 'Arry?" Harry looked quite shocked when Draco wound his arm around his hips but didn't take much time to follow along, laughing under his breath and laying his head on Draco’s shoulder.
Draco wondered if Ron had gone with Harry, that would explain things. But Harry hadn’t mentioned anyone going with him. Then again it had all seemed very confidential so it was anyone’s guess. Whatever it was, Hermione obviously knew something because she wanted to meet him
Draco smirked. “Would I do something like that?”
“Well, I guess I’ll just have to learn then, won’t I?” Draco said.
“Meet me outside the Muggle entrance to the Leaky Caldron at 1pm.
And he’d been right. Harry had saved him from the fiendfyre during the Battle of Hogwarts, pulling him onto the back of his broom, seemingly every inch the hero he was lauded to be. Draco had held onto him so tightly as the emotions he had been holding on to for the past seven years began to unravel at the seams. He still had flashbacks of that day when he’d finally managed to get back on a broom again, and every time since. Even for the tryouts.
“Hmm. If you were Ron, I’d say you were ill. Is it the new case or is it just the prospect of being Head Auror?”
Draco recalled all five function rooms they had seen that afternoon. (There had been two in one of the pubs.) The first one stuck out the most in his memories. “I think I favour the first location,” he told Potter. “But I’d like to taste their food before I make a commitment. Care to join me for dinner?”
With Harry’s wrists pinned with one hand, Draco reached towards his clothing and cast a wordlessly accio charm for his wand from his trousers. With wand in hand, he summoned the tube of lube usually kept in their bedroom and let it land on Harry’s chest before he tossed his wand back towards his clothes.
After Hermione’s suggestions, Draco thought it was an entirely plausible outcome. Surely Potter could have found someone else to handle this task so he wouldn’t have to attend the party. But no, here he said that he’d see Draco at the pub a full hour before the party was about to start. Either Harry had taken Draco’s coercing far too seriously or Draco had been missing all the signs.
Once he had finished swallowing, he joined Harry who was now laying back on the bed panting. “Couldn’t help yourself, could you?” Harry said between pants. “I really need to go as soon as possible.”
Draco schooled his face and pulled out his wand. "You can hardly blame me, Potter." He gently placed the tip of his wand at the top of Harry's dislocated shoulder. "Now, there will be a sharp pain as the bone slides back into place, but it should be over in a second or two. Also, I'm going to need you to let go of your arm."
Harry glanced up at this best friend before scanning his eyes over his desk. Besides his assortment of stationary and a few photos, there were only  two small piles of paper. He couldn’t remember the last time his desk hadn’t had numerous stacks of paper everywhere. He looked back at Ron and replied, “Yeah, fine.”
Letting go of Harry’s wrist to step back, he pulled his wand from his pocket and spelled lube onto his fingers. Anticipating Draco’s next move, Harry shuffled back and bent at the hips as he leaned against the wall. Please with Harry’s eagerness, Draco didn’t hesitate to cover his hole with lube and start working his finger inside. Harry gasped at the first entry of Draco’s digit but was soon leaning further forward and moving his hips back.
