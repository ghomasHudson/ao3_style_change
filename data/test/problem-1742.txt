“Took you long enough,” said Malfoy when he opened the door, and then he pulled Harry forward by his shirtfront and proceeded to devour his mouth.
“Now, let’s try that again,” continues Draco with that unnatural smile. He’s trying very hard to make it look like they are having a lovely chat. His new first year Slytherin’s are indeed watching, as is a table full of Gryffindors who are always ready to come to Harry’s defence whether he wants it or not. “Give me my potion now before I castrate you in front of the entire school.”
Draco doesn’t blink. “Would I like to keep the racist mark branded on my arm by the genocidal arsehole who was the cause of not one but two wars during our lifetimes? No, you dickwit, I don’t want to keep it but that’s not exactly a choice I have, is it?”
“I’m not cheating on my boyfriend, Malfoy.” It sounded like he was whining, Harry hated that. He fell onto a chair rather than the couch. He didn’t want Malfoy sitting next to him. Malfoy took the hint, but remained standing, his hands tucked tightly against his chest.
Harry felt ridiculous having to explain it. “Because you’re Draco Malfoy and I’m Harry Potter.”
“Loud, boorish, always on the lash, hopelessly heterosexual, lads.” Draco settles the argument with a forkful of mash.
Neville shakes his head and starts lifting boxes. “McGonagall took the files. She said she’d meet us in the staff room.”
It was a good job. Or at least, a job he was good at. He hadn’t always been. It was difficult to play by the rules at first, to learn the handbook and quote the regulations when all he wanted to do was go off gut and instinct alone, but he’d adapted.
“Stop that,” admonishes Potter, biting the other cheek. Draco’s only too happy to obey, especially since Potter rewards him with a long lick right against his arsehole that’s still pulsing from the cleaning spell he’s just used. He alternates his movements with broad licks and little tickling probing with the tip of his tongue. It’s absolute heaven, especially after the day Draco’s had and he is only too happy to relax into the pleasure of it.
“There you go,” Potter says as Draco passes him, reaching one hand out to stroke him like he’s some sort of well-behaved crup who's just learned a new trick.
He stops for too long, Potter’s noticed and Draco’s jumping for his tweezers again as that hand squeezes his balls firmly. A whine escapes his throat. It’s not painful, but it’s not pleasant and it makes it that much harder to get his fingers working the tweezers properly.
Draco licks into the shell of his ear, and that combined with the way he’s flicking his palm over the sensitive head of Harry’s cock is a wicked combination. Harry groans and feels his abdomen clench.
“Happy?” he asks once he’s lowered himself into a tailor's seat.
Draco keens as his cock drools against his stomach, he wants Potter’s attention back on him again. Why is he digging through his drawer now? It’s hard to focus while he’s so close to the edge, but the fog clears for a moment if only because he’s so damned confused because Potter is hanging up a piece of cloth from the rod behind his desk. It unfurls like a banner directly in front of Draco, brushing against his front, and it would block him from sight from head to toe if Draco couldn’t for some reason see through the damn thing. Why is it sheer? Is it some kind of hammock or new bondage?
Harry doesn’t look over as he sits down, but his free hand is resting on his knee, under the table, out of sight of their colleagues. Draco shifts so they are sitting shoulder to shoulder and puts his things on the table to start taking his own notes.
If Matthew had been a wizard, Harry might have magiced the results away, but he did rather like the spark he saw in the other man’s eyes during moments like these.
“Another bottle?” Matthew asked. He was already gesturing for the waiter.
Office. Good. Offices are good, neutral territory.
“I didn’t want you to stop coming around to the shop. I just meant for you to leave just that one time.”
Draco shakes him until Harry’s teeth rattle. “You utter fuckface, think with something other than your fat cock for once will you?”
“You’re heavy,” complains Draco.
Matthew rested his fingertips at Harry’s collar, fingers just barely brushing bare skin. Harry shivered as the other man grazed the bruise that had been left there only last night and batted the hand away with a smile to take the sting out of the action. Matthew laughed and rolled his eyes as Harry tugged his collar more firmly against his neck.
“Who’s coming tonight?” asks Neville, still watching the students.
“Er, nothing,” explained Harry. “Just saying, hello. Y’know, hello!” He gave a little wave to illustrate his words.
“You love it,” sighs Draco, already half asleep.
It’s still Draco and Harry, but now they’re sitting together in a crowded pub, surrounded by their friends and family and Harry’s arm is wrapped firmly around his shoulders, Draco’s hand resting on his leg. No one is looking at them, no one cares, even when Harry and Draco lean into each other for a brief kiss.
As he works, Draco’s index fingers caress Harry’s palm so slightly he’s not even sure if Draco is aware of the movement at all.
The vibrations are powerful, almost too much for the sensitive skin of his rim. Potter teases entry, dipping the tapered head in, then stroking down his taint and back up again.
“You could have just said you wanted to fuck me,” he says, making conversation while he frots absently against Draco. “You know I’d be up for it anytime you ask. I’m quite looking forward to it now actually, just look at this pretty thing.” And pretty it is, Harry loves Draco’s cock, loves how it sticks out from his body all pale and thin, loves it from his swollen tip to his round tight balls. “I’m quite looking forward to having it in me. Don’t worry though. I’m okay with doing all the work. I think you’re quite busy aren’t you?”
The only thing he can think as he gasps and cums all over the tile floor of Aberforth’s toilets is, thank goodness he’d made it somewhere private in time. With the way his body is shuddering and heaving with the aftermath of his orgasm, there’s no way he would have been able to hide that from his friends.
There didn’t seem to be much sense in pointing out that up until last night Harry hadn’t slept with anyone for months, but he didn’t think it would help matters. “Is that sewn on a pillow somewhere?” he asked instead.
“Well I’m knackered,” he told the group. “And I’ve double Defense with the fifth years in ten minutes, just going to have a quick cuppa and rest if you don’t mind.”
Draco hisses at the contact because instead of a pat on the head Potter has reached one cupped palm between his legs. He pushes Potter back, but it’s a token shove at best and they both know it. He doesn’t even stumble back, just gives Draco’s cock a squeeze and starts walking him backwards into the nearest compartment without breaking contact.
Harry chokes out a gasp, because dear Merlin, he knows Felix Rosier and yeah, he’s definitely fit. “That’s Charlie Weasley’s boyfriend,” he tells Draco. “They’re both dragonologists.”
Boomslang skin, he thinks.
“That was—” says Harry.
“Why not?” asks Harry. He has the answer, he knows why, but he wants to know what Draco will say, how far he’s looked into it before.
At the time Lily had given Malfoy a confused look. Later she’d pulled Harry aside and explained that she thought Malfoy was Harry’s boyfriend.
“I didn’t want to be friends with you, Potter.”
Wednesday, September 26
Harry was very nearly catching on, but decided not to face the truth quite yet. It had been too long since he’d had an inane conversation with Malfoy. “You do realize you are a florist?”
Harry exchanged a look with Malfoy. They hadn’t delved too deeply into their recent pasts during their conversation on Montmartre. He wasn’t sure if Malfoy had been entirely honest when he’d set himself up here. Harry certainly wouldn’t blame him for pretending to be something, or someone he wasn’t.
“I said, that’s not what you called me before.”
Harry looked away. “I think you need to be alone for awhile.”
Malfoy’s tongue was poking between his lips again. Harry had missed that too. He must be thinking very hard, Harry thought.
It was the man from the first night Harry had seen Malfoy again, he was sure of it. And Malfoy was practically hanging off of him. It was disgusting. Not, Harry quickly told himself, because he minded or anything. It was mostly so terrible because he knew what a proud person Malfoy was, and to see him so debased was just wrong somehow.
Draco opens his mouth, then shuts it. “You mean a date. You’ve been asking me out on a date.”
“Fuck, Malfoy,” shouts Potter, finally as riled up as Draco. “What do you want me to say, that I haven’t already? I like you. I like fucking you. I like spending time with you. I want to spend more time with you. What’s wrong with that?”
“What were you thinking?”
Harry has to ask again when it’s clear Draco’s only going to ignore him.
Potter’s cum is leaking out of his arsehole.
There are sixty-three cards in a deck of Exploding Snap, Draco doesn’t think Harry’s going to use them all, but he loses count after counting to nineteen when the card on the small of his back explodes.
“I like you like that,” says Draco. “Now get out.”
As if sensing his discomfort Potter gives him a sidelong glance, eyes roving briefly up and down his body before winking. The prick.
They both know he does. Draco’s whining loudly enough and his balls are drawing up in warning. “Keep going, fuck, fucking love your cock, stretching me out so good, harder, harder!”
At least he was acknowledging that he understood what Harry was talking about.
Matthew was staying in New York for New Years so Harry accepted Lauren’s invitation to a New Years Eve party when it came. He had hoped to regain some of his pre-Christmas cheer, but when the first person he’d seen at the party was Malfoy pouring drinks in the kitchen, he knew it was useless. Lauren shot him a look of understanding, but also seemed determined to play matchmaker. He’d already been told no less than three times that Lucas was not attending tonight’s festivities, and he didn’t really appreciate the implication.
“If you touch anything then I’ll be forced to cut off your hands and feed them to my pet crocodile.”
They really should get up and have a proper shower, tidy up the Dueling room and get ready for lessons tomorrow, but for now Harry’s happy to lay here and let Draco hold him.
It turned out that the reason they couldn’t just speak at the café in the city was that the view was spectacular. Malfoy allowed Harry to stare out at the expanse of the city for a full two minutes before he became restless and steered them both back towards the bustle of the hilltop village. Harry was led to yet another café and pushed into one of the increasingly familiar too-tiny metal seats before Malfoy spoke again.
Potter does care about him and does see him for who he is. It’s not just about proximity or sex, although the sex is fantastic. Potter knows about all of his secrets, has been there for all of his worst moments, and still sees the good in him after all these years.
“I am going for lunch, and you are following me,” said Malfoy.
Draco doesn’t know how he does it. He’s been sucking cock since he went down on his knees for Miles Bletchley in the fifth year and he’s never been able to deepthroat, can barely manage a blowjob without gagging, but Potter… Potter is a pro.
It’s Draco’s spit that slides against Harry’s hand as he pushes his foreskin back and gives himself a pump. He holds his cock upright and tilts his pelvis forward right in front of Draco’s open mouth. He takes the hint, sucking first one ball then the other into that perfect heat.
“Two fingers below the knot, my boy, make sure it’s not too tight,” says Percy.
At least he had tried, Harry told himself in the days that followed while he tried to adjust to a Malfoy-less world. It would have been worse to string himself along just to enjoy the other man’s company when he knew he wanted more.
Harry shrugs. He does not say it’s because he likes the money nearly as much as he likes the sex. “So how much have I made this month then?”
“Morning Malfoy,” says Potter. He continues feeding the Thestrals and it’s slightly nauseating to watch them snap the hunks of red meat from the air and rip it to shreds. “Hagrid’s feeling ill so I told him I’d take his chores for the weekend.”
Hogwarts Grounds
Harry moans as that tongue delicately fondles him, and lets his cock go, lets it rest against the length of Draco’s face. It’s a good look on him, and his stubble scrapes just enough to tickle as Harry gives a small thrust.
Worse still, he felt like he’d broken it off with two people. He hadn’t seen Malfoy much through fall and winter, but now it felt like he’d lost the other man all over again. This time when Malfoy caught sight of him from across the street he didn’t wave or acknowledge Harry in any way, he just kept walking.
And really it’s his name that does it, hearing it amongst all the filth. Draco hasn’t called him by his first time since the Armortenia incident and Harry loves it. He’s gasping and coming, angling his cock to spurt as close to Draco’s face as he can. His arse clenches rhythmically against Draco’s cock which sets Draco off and Harry just cums harder from the sudden feeling of Draco filling him up. They finish together and Harry’s happy to rest his knees, catch his breath, and let his pounding heart slow but then Draco snaps; “Vibrator!”
Malfoy dug his hands into the front of Harry’s shirt and held on as if Harry might run away. “Yes, but only because I started sleeping with my French teacher. I stayed with him after that.”
“I think I’d like to know what that’s like,” Malfoy moved his head back until he was staring at Harry. His eyes were red and swollen, Harry noted.
Malfoy was slumped dramatically across the glass countertop at the till. “You know things are bad when Harry bloody Potter is getting more action than you are,” he mumbled into his arms loud enough for the words to have been intended to be overheard.
“Mr. Potter?”
“It’s your own fault,” Potter says as he fingers Draco open. “When I told you to pay me back with something good I was just thinking of tying your hands to the headboard, but then you had to go and show off your naughty toy drawer.”
“Where are we going?” he asked when he realized they were leaving the market.
There was a retort bubbling angrily in the back of Harry’s throat, but he was pretty sure if he picked an argument Malfoy would leave him up on this hill, and he wasn’t sure he could navigate the Métro on his own.
“No problem,” says Draco.
“Ah, then I’m afraid I must explain why that appendage between my legs seems so familiar to you…”
“You are such a tart,” says Harry.
“Right that,” said Harry. He was starting to feel vaguely uncomfortable, and guilty for some reason.
The black ropes stand out sharply against Draco’s white skin, and already Harry wonders what another colour might look like. Purple maybe, or green, he’d probably prefer green. He looks gorgeous like this, stretched out, on display, balanced nearly perfectly still. The longer he looks, the harder he gets, especially when he thinks of other ways he could tie Draco up. Ways that would open him up, like if his knees were splayed, or bound to his chest.
And Harry was left with the realization that he wasn’t just maybe attracted to his sort of friend Malfoy. No, he wanted Draco.
Malfoy stared at him incredulously. “Of course you do, we’ve had coffee a thousand times.”
“Merlin, Harry, your cock is so perfect in my mouth,” he gasps. “One more taste, one more.”
“Remind him to try a little harder next time,” continued Draco. “Or at least buy the man some stockings.”
Draco groans. “Yes alright, and also papadams, they look good too, I want those.”
It’s no hardship to close his eyes and submit to Draco’s ministrations, though it is difficult to remain still while doing so. For this part, at least, Draco prefers him to remain as motionless and silent as possible, and Harry is very good at his job.
“Oh,” replied Draco with mock surprise, but the anger in his eyes was very real. “Did they? I’m so sorry to argue with you Mr. Auror Potter, sir, because clearly you know everything.”
Harry did not apparently need to answer. Perhaps his response was clear from his expression. Hermione had always said that his face was an open book.
This year they’d taken up the whole of the tiny restaurant. His kids had a table to themselves where Lily was making faces to entertain Kate and Jon’s giggling daughter. Marie had brought along her new beau, an English man by the name of Gerald. She’d thanked Harry profusely for all of the English lessons since otherwise, she said, she never would have understood that Gerald was trying to ask her out. Craig and Pierre arrived accompanied by Charles the teacup poodle or as Pierre put it ‘Their darling baby boy.’ Lauren had arrived with a number of other acquaintances Harry had made at her numerous parties, and Harry’s partner Adrian had joined in and brought a majority of their department. Of course the magical folks were all dressed so ridiculously that Harry had needed to explain away their wardrobes in an attempt at fancy dress.
He hums and considers. “Yes, I’ve been thinking the same thing, but his basics are sloppy, he’s got to get his footwork practised out or—”
“I bet I can cheer you up,” she said when she failed to produce a reaction out of him.
“So,” he whispers. “What are you going to do for me?”
“Vulgar,” Draco snaps, but there’s a hint of a smile on his lips now. “Another no, no for the little woman.”
“I don’t want that either, Malfoy.”
“I hope you’re pleased with yourself,” he tells Draco as he slips into bed.
Has he had too much to drink already? Was some kind of sensitizing potion slipped into his drink? He’s usually pretty careful in public— he does have a few stalkers after all, but he’s generally safe in Hogsmeade particularly when suspicious Aberforth is pulling all of his pints.
“Not sure I want to do that again.”
“You don’t even know if I’m gay,” he said.
He gave her a level look. “Besides your husband you mean?”
Harry laughs and then reaches out to swing Draco around in a wide circle until he’s laughing. The featherlight charm is still on and Draco’s lying on his back suspended in the air at chest height in front of Harry while he works. He twirls around in a circle, spinning until the momentum gives out and Harry pulls him back in by a hanging rope.
The man’s forehead crinkled. Harry was annoyed to note that it did not make him look ugly in the least. “Anglais? Non, Français seulement.” Then he turned back around and faced the still closed toilet door.
“I did say that,” responded Harry. Malfoy’s hair was tickling his nose again, he nudged it away.
She laughed. “Not for me, for you. I met him through my book club. An English book club, obviously. He’s American too, from New York City, very cosmopolitan, very attractive.”
“He let me have the flat and gave me money for groceries and things so long as I entertained him whenever he decided to show up,” Malfoy was still whispering.
Harry’s own lips and eyes were open. One set panting, the other drinking in the sight of the slim, brown boy bouncing up and down on his cock. He reached out and pinched a pebbled nipple just to see the boy’s lips separate for a moan.
For a brief moment he thought Malfoy was leaning into him, perhaps giving in, but then Harry felt the sharp point of a wand pressed against his chest.
True. “Well, someone had to say the spell to pull the beads out at the right time, my hands were a little busy.” Also, he liked the audience.
“Lucas?”
As with every other time Lucas’ name was brought up, Harry chose not to comment, Malfoy chose not to notice and went into detail about what he expected out of his, ‘Pamper me, because it’s my birthday’ weekend.
Harry already knows what he’s going to see. He’s seen it, and ignored it, countless times before. It’s ugly, and scared over in thick red welts, representing all the horrible things that he’s had to overcome in his life. The Dark Mark on his lover's arm.
Only, the problem is, he’s already avoiding Harry, so it’s not like it could get any worse.
Harry shot him a look “You went to university?”
“How’re you doing?” asks Harry, giving his cheek a stroke.
Draco doesn’t seem to want to stop fucking around, but if that’s all they are going to do then should Harry even want to bother anymore?
“Just after I’d finished my training the Ministry sent me on this publicity tour to improve diplomatic or international relations, or some such rot. Two-dozen cities over two months. I was in Cape Town, Jerusalem, Washington D.C., Tokyo, Sydney, and then I was here, in Paris. The Ministry saved it for last. I think because it was so close to home. By the time I got here I was so tired of traveling, of being the Harry Potter the Ministry wanted me to be.
Harry huffs. He still can’t get over how dirty Draco is sometimes. He doesn’t even look up from cutting his carrots, knife and fork balanced delicately in his hands. Harry sort of loves it.
“Aren’t you tired of this?” asked Harry, gesturing to the empty shop, but meaning so much more than that.
“Harry Potter,” said Harry. Malfoy actually bit his lip to keep from saying anything. Harry understood the feeling, he was still fighting the initial burst of irritation he felt whenever he heard the other man's name.
Draco snorts. “Not too different from Potions is it? And I can do that with your cock up my arse if you’d care to remember. I’m sure I could learn.”
“Aqua Eructo!”
The thought doesn’t go any further, the squid slaps a tentacle against the bucket, knocking three fish into the dusty shore and Harry has to jump to avoid the other two tentacles that come in for the feast. The fish are quickly pulled back into the lake and in no time the tentacles are right back in line for more.
He whines low in his throat in approval, hopes he can get that cock in his mouth before he cums, though he’s not sure when Harry intends to pull the beads from his arse. He’s never been able to hold back once they’re pulled out, but Percy’s in charge of when that happens, he knows. He’d heard them talking about it as Harry had pushed them in.
Their cocks line up and Harry drinks in Draco’s little whimpers, forcing his head to angle back up for more kisses. Harry holds Draco in place, angling his chin just right and pushes his tongue back between his lips.
In April Harry decided he’d been unemployed too long. He’d left the Auror’s nearly a year and a half ago, and although he’d enjoyed being unemployed for a bit, it was time for a new challenge. He’d been unsure about working for a wizarding establishment, but his only work experience had been in law enforcement and he had enjoyed it.
“That wasn’t a compliment,” said Harry.
It all made Harry want to laugh and pull the blond against his chest and soothe him like a petulant child. “Why are you with him if he makes you so cross then?” he asked. It was the first time Harry had said as much, but he had been given strength of will by his recent number of orgasms.
“Just Hermoine and Ron,” he answers. “You and Hannah are welcome to join once you’re off duty.”
Neville just rolls his eyes and resumes marking. Everyone is used to Draco being a twitchy, moody bastard after all.
“Did I tell you about how things were when I first moved to Paris?” said Malfoy.
Since the divorce their relationship had healed somewhat, through short visits and long floo conversations. Since Harry had moved to Paris in the early spring, the floo conversations had stopped, but he’d exchanged numerous letters with his sprog and sent a mobile phone to Ginny so that he could talk to his children on the rotary in his new flat. He called everyday, but Lily was the only one who actually wanted to talk so often.
“Absolutely, under no circumstances look in the back refrigerator. There’s a poisonous snake in there and not a box of macarons.”
“It didn’t bite you did it?” asked Harry.
Draco’s staring at him. “Just in case. I’m handsy on potions. You may need to tie me up.”
To his credit, Malfoy didn’t laugh, but he did smirk and he did make Harry say it three more times before he was satisfied.
“Better?” asks Draco.
Harry glances out over the ever watching assembly of students. “You’re going to scare the first years,” he says.
Wednesday, November 14
“Draco,” the woman interrupted. “Your degree was in linguistics.”
Malfoy remained conspicuously silent.
But Malfoy’s eyes had narrowed as he took in Harry’s tighter than normal clothes. “Where’re you coming from Potter? I thought your flat was that way?” He jerked his head in the direction that Harry had been walking to and where indeed his flat was located.
They work together swiftly, Draco levitating alongside Neville until the mirror is slowly covered up once more. He doesn’t try to look at it again, almost afraid of what he’ll see next, but he catches the odd flash of bottle green.
Harry smiles. He likes it when Draco’s prickly. Always angry and then melts like a kitten once Harry’s got his hands on him. “Okay, here’s a sentence. Would you like to go to have a drink in Hogsmeade with me?”
It’s easy to ignore Potter. “Fuck me,” he begs instead. Begging usually works. “I need you.”
It was hard to believe that it had been over a year since he’d moved. This time last year he’d been sharing a cramped table with his three children and trying not to think of Draco Malfoy on his date.
Harry blinked and made a show of looking around. “I don’t see any flowers, Malfoy.”
Nearly every student from their time has a story of how they managed to get one over on Rosmerta at some point or another. It had taken Harry becoming a teacher to discover that it was a tried and true routine of Rosie’s and the students were never getting anything more than non-alcoholic Wager Lager. They still hadn’t told Ron, who regularly tells his version of the story on pub nights.
“Why didn’t you say so?” said the woman in perfectly clear English. “I’m sorry, I didn’t know that you did not understand, how rude of you, Draco!” she gave Malfoy a half-hearted push.
Malfoy scowled at her and shot something off in French.
Immediately Potter’s mouth disappears, formed over with skin until it looks like he never had one at all. Potter makes a furious sound in his throat and moves to push away from his desk so Draco says; “Petrificus Totalus,” and his whole body freezes in place.
So Harry spent several awkward moments standing at the till with Malfoy’s mother while she purchased the truffle medley and wrote out a short note to be attached after it was gift-wrapped.
Then Draco tips his head back opens his mouth and whines. “Need you so bad, Harry, Merlin you feel so good on my cock, so fucking good, cum on my face, Harry, come on!”
“You know, for fun. Drinking. You and me. Hogsmeade.” Because they always stay in the castle, because they never really do anything but fuck. Which is great, but maybe there could be more?
“Accio bag,” says Harry. His work bag sails across the room, landing beside Draco in a heap. He needs to clean the thing out, there are stacks of paper that are from the first week of school that he surely doesn’t need to be carrying around, but eventually, he finds what he wants and shoves it into Draco's hole.
“Lovely,” said Harry. “So you curse at people when they do what you want, and when they don’t?”
The other man looked drawn and tired, but had smiled when he caught sight of Harry standing at the door.
Draco seems to be having a similar effect on himself, there’s the familiar shine of precum across his stomach and he's starting to make little thrusting motions with his hips which just end up wiggling his whole body.
Another arch of the eyebrow. It was always the one above Malfoy’s right eye. For some reason Harry wondered if Malfoy had such control over the one above his left.
“It’s, uh, really nice, thank you.” He’s supposed to appreciate it right? Draco would get annoyed if he is anything, but thankful, surely.
And Harry would swear the thought of Ron in an apron is the least sexy thing he can think of, but it feels like someone has just given his cock a squeeze because suddenly it’s throbbing.
“We agreed on Christmas for giving things a proper— public go,” argues Harry. “No reason you can’t come to meet my friends just as a, you know, friend.”
“Are we back to cursing, you said something like idiot right?” Malfoy nodded and Harry repeated the phrase back.
“Want me to apologise? Get on my knees? Is that it?”
Harry shrugged and stared at a display of lilies during the resulting silence.
“I only want you touching my cock,” demands Harry, knowing it’s going to be a hard task.
He cancels the spell and then falls on top of Draco’s chest bonelessly. He did manage to cum mostly on Draco’s face, but just as much ended up on Draco’s chest and is now smeared against Harry’s chest, but he doesn’t mind. Draco is warm beneath him and he can hear his heart racing against his ear. Inside him, Draco softens and they both moan as he slips from Harry’s arse.
“Right, Draco.” Sometimes Harry still forgot and slipped. Sometimes he did it on purpose. “He wanted to come to a proper Muggle party. He’s trying.”
Tuesday, it reads.
Harry hums. “I’ll add it to the list.”
“What I’m saying,” Draco interrupts. “Is I like fucking you. For some reason, I even like working with you. I wouldn’t mind spending more time together.”
Potter squeezes his hip gently and teases at his rim until Draco hisses.
Eventually, the platform clears as the rowdy students pile into the carriages.
Harry avoided looking at Malfoy for a bit longer, but when he looked up Malfoy was staring out the balcony window. “I don’t want to leave here while I’m this angry with you.”
Malfoy, had surprisingly been on time, even though Harry had expected him to saunter up twenty minutes late if he showed up at all. Instead he’d been waiting out front with a newspaper tucked under one arm and a cream-colored messenger bag slung across his chest.
They lean against one another, panting, slowly coming back to reality.
Professor Malfoy’s Personal Rooms
“And the thing is, the thing that most people forget, or maybe don’t know,” continues Harry unhurriedly. “Is that, it was my blood he was resurrected with.” He stares hard at the lines he’s smeared across the wood and waits for Draco to catch on. He’s a clever man, it won’t take him long.
At eleven hippogriffs he feels it again and is forced to glance behind him.
The students are all popping something in their mouth now, doing a terrible job of looking casual, one grows a sudden beard, the other shoots up several inches.
“An escort,” affirmed Harry. “Not a prostitute. I agreed to escort you to your work function--not to allow you to paw at me like I’m some kind of whore.”
The little shit smirks.
Harry’s smile faded and he stared back at Malfoy, weighing the moment. Malfoy did not wave, or acknowledge Harry in any way, but simply looked away, threw some notes onto the table and left.
“Thanks for playing delivery boy, Potter,” drawled Malfoy as he turned away. He tossed the chocolates onto the counter without a second look, he was already headed for the back room again. “See you around.”
The look on Malfoy’s face was a familiar one to Harry. It was the look that Malfoy had regularly given Harry when they were at Hogwarts. Harry rather thought it meant something like, ‘What business do you have being in my esteemed company you miserable piece of filth.’ Instead Malfoy said, “Does it sound like I’m talking about a fucking geranium, Potter?”
His arms and legs are like jelly. Holding that position probably wasn’t the best of ideas, his thighs will ache tomorrow, but judging from Potter’s glassy-eyed look it was worth it. Draco rubs a strip of his cum from his stomach and brings it to Potter’s face, presses it against the skin right where his mouth should be. “Want a taste?” he asks and smirks at the challenge in Potter’s eyes.
Discouraging, but not disastrous.
A laugh bubbles up from Harry’s newly freed chest. “You know all the really dirty and kinky stuff costs extra.”
“You actually spoke French,” said Malfoy incredulously after carefully watching Harry converse with the till attendant who rang him up and helped him bag his purchases. Harry just shrugged. He was meeting with Marie twice a week now, and both her English and his French was improving little by little.
“Draco, I’m not sure we should be trying out untested spells with our dicks.”
“Bloody fuck, Potter,” breathes Draco. Now that he’s cum all he can feel are the aches and pains of the bondage and cards. He desperately wants another shower and it’s got to be past midnight, on a school night no less.
The bell above the door tinkled, and they drew apart as a customer walked in and asked Malfoy to help her pick out an orchid. Harry leaned against the counter and watched as Malfoy took on an air of kind professionalism. All traces of the sulky, drama queen were pushed aside until the woman had her new purchase in hand and was out the door again. Then with a sort of shiver that seemed to affect his full body, Malfoy slumped back into his chair. His bottom lip swelled out, his brow wrinkled, and he pulled his arms over his chest.
“Alright, alright,” he chides. “That was very well done, well met Professor Malfoy.”
“Potter,” says Harry. “That’s not what you called me before.”
“Venomous tentacula?”
Marie smiles. “Just so long as you understand that I expect you to be thinking of me when I ride you into the mattress tonight.”
“Hmm,” he hummed when James and Albus were finished. He fished a box of biscuits out from under his desk and tossed them to the boys. “Save my waistline and waste the rest of these then will you?”
Harry felt sufficiently tipsy, but smiled and shrugged. It wasn’t as if he had to get up for work in the morning.
“Undo your trousers and I’ll tell you about my night,” he says and Harry doesn’t have to be told twice.
Harry did know. Draco had complained about it all last year. That, and how fiendishly difficult it was to make and how annoyed he was that it was being put on the N.E.W.T. curriculum for this year.
“Yeah sure,” agrees Neville absently. “I’m on duty until 6, but we can go after that.”
“Well?” prompts Draco as the other man rolls down his sleeves and buttons up his cuffs.
It’s so, so good.
“You’re such a spoiled slut, Draco,” he continued. “You want my cock that bad do you?”
They’ve been teasing about it, and it has taken a long time, so they lost any sexual edge associated with the activity ages ago, but seeing Draco strung up with his cock dangling forward from between his bound legs, he’s suddenly remembering why they decided to do this.
Harry had to smile at that. “What?”
Ah, youth, Harry thought. Then he slammed back the shot of tequila he’d just been given and smiled back.
He drops to his knees and licks a broad strip up Harry’s stomach, cleaning up his own cum, moaning as if it’s the most delicious thing he’s ever tasted and looks up at Harry with wide grey eyes. “Please,” he begs.
“Malfoy,” said Harry, because he felt he should at least say something but he didn’t know what.
Harry smiles sweetly back at him and sips at his own champagne cocktail. “If all you want is someone pretty and silent, why don’t you get a real wife for yourself?”
He swirls his robes around him and stalks off. He only gets as far as the stairs before Potter grabs him by the arm.
After a month Harry realized that he apparently enjoyed living like a barnyard animal. It felt as if he was living life to his own design for once.
“He starts coming around every few months, takes Draco out for dinners and drinks, or on weekends away, and then he disappears without a word. No good.”
Malfoy gave him a look that made him think he had not been so successful in his efforts, and which somehow also said the familiar, ‘Don’t be stupid, Potter.’
His social schedule was much the same, only now Harry also had a weekly pub quiz with his colleagues, and he was regularly invited out for a pint or a glass of wine in the Wizarding quarter on Friday nights.
For one, it’s almost an exact replica of Draco’s own master suite (Harry knows; he’d snooped one afternoon after finishing his shower with precisely 3 minutes to spare). The walls are a rich cream, the furniture heavy and wooden. A sleigh bed dominates the room, covered in various shades of blue and framed on either side by his and her nightstands. A writing table rests in one corner, and a vanity beneath the window. A walk-in closet and an en suite are both attached.
There were few things that Harry missed about the Wizarding world, but one of them was most definitely Honeydukes chocolate. With his bags packed and shrunken in his magically expanding pockets (bigger on the inside thanks to Hermione), he decided to brave the Wizarding village before returning to his Muggle seclusion. There was nothing he could do about his glasses, but he tugged a knit hat (Weasley made) over his forehead, and turned his collar up around his face. He knew it was too much to hope to avoid recognition, but maybe if he was lucky…
It had been a long time since he’d had to actively try to pull. When he’d first started seeing men he’d snuck into Muggle London before he realized there were a number of discreet wizards willing to do anything for ‘the Chosen One.’
“Oh very much,” he says. Then Draco pulls back and reaches out to push Harry’s glasses back into his hair. Ready to get down to it then.
“Temporary obsession,” explains Draco. “You like how cock hungry I get once I’ve had a taste? Desperate to bend over and happy to spread myself open for you?”
“Why are you doing this?” said Harry once he felt able to control himself again. “Why now?”
Neville gives him an odd look. “It’s the Mirror of Erised, it’s supposed to show you your heart's desire or something like that. Drives people mad apparently.”
His arse is dripping already, where he’s loosened himself up with his fingers and toys, laying on his bed thinking about Potter’s thick cock. The black plug he’s used to hold himself open is a bit smaller than Potter, and it slips easily from his hole. He gives it a few more thrusts, teasing himself, and showing Potter just how wet and open he is.
“Well I refused to bring them, didn’t I? What kind of man sends another man flowers anyway?”
Harry didn’t answer that. It wasn’t a fair thing to say either and Malfoy knew it.
The beads have never done this before. It must be something new, a spell Percy’s withheld, or something that Harry knows about. It’s not a vibration, it's more of a wiggle, as the beads shift side to side, like… like a snake perhaps? It’s incessant, flicking against his sensitive walls, stretching him in a new and different way, rubbing against his prostate.
“Yeah,” says Potter.
It took Harry a moment to think. “But that’s—”
Her lips thinned. “As well as can be expected.”
Friday, September 21
“First, floristing isn’t a word. It’s floristry, and you’d be surprised.”
“You’re ridiculous,” Harry tells him. “And I’m still not sure this is the best idea.”
“So?” Harry repeated. “So, I can’t just walk up and say, ‘Hello, long time, no see, what the hell are you doing here?’”
Draco just shrugs and scoops up another forkful of mash.
And then Percy says; “I say, your cock is nearly as nice as Felix Rosier’s. Good show.”
Draco’s not even blushing. “Grow up,” he says instead. He’s going back in for more carrots. “In a consenting, controlled environment, I mean.”
Malfoy laughed. “Dear god, Potter. He wasn’t a virgin was he?”
Harry had dropped his things off at his flat, and then decided to walk down to Malfoy’s shop with his parcel under his arm. If he hurried, he could catch Malfoy before he went home for the night.
“Oh, but think of all the fun we can have!” whines Percy.
He left the two to discuss the merits of adding baby’s breath to the mixture in favor of searching out his far too quiet sons. He found them in the supply room, James having managed to entirely wrap his younger brother in bubble wrap. Harry helped cut Albus free and dragged them back into the main room to apologize to Malfoy for wasting his materials.
“Hello,” says Draco. His expression is reverent, eyes roving across Harry’s face as if taking in every little detail for the first time. He slides his fingers up Harry’s throat, touching his lips, then dancing across his cheekbones. Harry has to close his eyes briefly as he gently traces a thumb across each eyelid.
Harry’s groin clenches at the thought. Yeah, he definitely likes that, likes hearing the words out of Draco’s filthy mouth even more. “Absolutely,” he agrees.
The second time, Draco chooses anger over ignorance. “What the fuck kind of question is that?”
“As much as I am loving it, and fuck I am loving it, I think I’d prefer the excess blood in my cock instead of my head.”
Harry awoke to gentle fingertips tracing down his nose. He opened one eye, but the image of Malfoy’s face before his remained bleary. He’d lost his glasses at some point then.
The smooth skin of Harry’s shaft soothes his burnt tongue and it’s fantastic to have something to concentrate on while the cards snap and crackle. He has to try not to clench his jaw when they go off, to keep his mouth good and gentle for Harry. He keeps his lips wrapped around his teeth just in case.
Draco’s trying to follow the motion, itching frantically up his leg until his whole body goes rigid.
The boys ignored the threat and wandered off to see if there was anything interesting in the back room, like there was at the Wheezes, but Lily looked up at Harry with wide, watery eyes.
And fuck if his words don’t make Harry nearly come on their own.
“Shush darling, hold on, finite incantatem. There, silencing charm. Now let me hear those pretty sounds.”
Slowly the hand on Harry’s head slides down the side of his neck, over his shoulder, down his arm, until familiar fingers are sliding through his own and lifting his hand up for closer inspection. He knows Draco’s examining his nails to see if they need further cutting, but this time, at least, they seem to pass inspection as Draco next reaches for the buffer. Harry’s hands rest in Draco’s as each of his fingernails is brought to a fine shine.
“Not necessarily,” continues Percy. “That’s what the rope across the chest is for, weight distribution. It looks more uncomfortable than it is.”
And Harry was left with an annoying buzzing in his head, a mostly eaten chocolate torte (that was admittedly excellent), and the bill.
Draco blinks at him, trying to keep the tears in the corner of his eyes from falling. Harry reaches out to grab his wrist, even if it’s the one with the mark on it, and tugs Draco over, making him roll onto his side.
“That’s it, there you go,” says Potter as he strokes Draco’s prostate through it.
The cuffs are heavy, it’s awkward holding them, let alone wearing them. “Why would I need to do that?” Harry asks.
“I know,” says Harry. “You were so fucking incredible, I’m so proud of you.”
Malfoy glares at him all through the staff meeting. There’s a muscle twitching in his cheek, but at least the rest of his expression looks more normal now.
It’s so, so good, that first initial stretch, particularly after so long. Draco’s cockhead pushes him open and rests just inside. He takes him slowly, sinking slightly down and then back up in little motions as the feeling becomes more comfortable. It takes a long time for Harry’s arse to come to rest against Draco’s balls but when he does he throws back his head and lets out a long moan. He can feel a faint vibration through the base of Draco’s cock from the vibrator buried in his arse. Draco’s whole pelvis is trembling with the effects of it.
“Are you counting hippogryphs?” asks Harry once his hips are flush against Draco’s arse. He’s leaning over Draco’s back, resting his chin on his shoulder, watching the muddy looking potion boil at high heat.
“See you, Potter.”
Which was how Draco had found himself suspended from the ceiling above his bed with silk ropes wrapped around his body, arms pulled back, legs folded, feet resting on his arse.
Draco’s heart gives a little lurch, it doesn’t much like the idea of having its secrets stripped bare. “Can you see what I see?” he asks.
Potter points and Eddie’s eyes follow until they are both meeting Draco’s eyes and he feels his cock stiffening up again. Eddie can’t see him, but Draco’s not sure what he can hear. Draco can hear the wet, sucking sound of the vibrator sliding in and out of his hole, but can they? He’s too afraid to let loose all the little sounds he wants to so to hold them back he bites into the gag which now makes a lot more sense. He’d thought Potter had just wanted to shut him up for once.
“Wait, Malfoy, I’m just—” he doesn’t get any more words out, holds himself off long enough to pull nearly out of Draco’s mouth. Draco, who tilts his head back, looks Harry in the eye and lets his tongue cradle the tip of his cock as he starts to come.
Harry nods but still has a hard time understanding how obsession can be sexy. He has five stalkers and two restraining orders. It’s not a game.
“I’m very cross,” he said.
He moves as quickly as he can, and it’s not hard really, to attach one end of a short rope to the ones binding Draco’s wrist together, to the one on Draco’s right ankle.
Harry signed. “I’m glad for you. But I’m still with Matthew.”
Although he did not appear to want to answer, Malfoy did eventually nod.
He doesn’t know if Potter can see him, or just knows where he is, but either way, Draco decides to give him a show. He’s still ridiculously sensitive, but he knows from experience that if he just ignores his cock for now and concentrates on the toy sliding in and out of his arse he can work himself back up. Well, he’d be forced to anyway with the way the vibrator is battering his prostate, but hopefully, he can help things along.
On Wednesday morning Harry toyed with the card as he stared at the white ceiling above his bed. There’d been water damage at some point. The paint was cracked and blistered in places as if about to burst. He could stay at home and see if he could fix it. There was a DIY shop on the corner and he was sure the problem was only cosmetic. He could even look up household spells, but he vaguely thought that would be cheating.
“Well,” smirks Draco, laying back. “I might have needed to blow some steam off after detention today. Francis and Frankie did a horrendous job on the Dreamless Sleep I had them brewing, so I had to stay after and finish it myself. And they arrived after eating a whole bowl of Chuckling Cherries which was a joy, I can tell you.”
“Merlin fucking Morgana, Potter, fuck me!” snaps Draco the second he’s given the use of his voice again. His voice is strained as if he's been screaming and his eyes are wide and frantic.
Two fingers ease gently into his hole and Draco whimpers as he’s filled again. Potter licks a stripe from the base of his cock to the tip, right over Draco’s fingers where he’s holding it.
Then his nimble hands are working their way into Harry’s trousers, undoing his zip, and pulling his cock out through the opening in his boxers. Harry lets out a hiss as the cool air hits his heated skin, but stops Draco from enveloping him in his warm mouth with an outstretched hand.
“Merde,” said Malfoy, shaking his head.
“Potter!”
Jonathan Rigby, who is underage, is eyeing up The Hogs Head with a small gaggle of sixth years, but it’s not Harry’s problem because he has the day off and it’s glorious. “Heads up there, Nev,” he says while giving the other man a nod.
Harry almost asks ‘what do you want?’ but he isn’t sure he’s ready for the answer. Instead he licks Draco’s neck and makes quick work on the buttons of his finely-pressed shirt.
Once, Malfoy’s paramour was standing in line in front of him.
And… okay, yeah, that’s true. “Does the manor even have a proper kitchen? Have you ever even seen it before?”
Aurora shakes her head. “You’ll get the balance soon. It sneaks up on the best of us and you’re still figuring it out.”
And no, they didn’t, but Harry had rather hoped they were getting to the point in their relationship where he didn’t have to plan to spend the night with Draco. That he could come and knock on his boyfriend’s door at any time and expect to be welcomed inside. That he might be keyed into the wards even, or expected.
Potter sighs and fiddles absently with an uneaten piece of toast. They don't have time to sit here any longer, they both have classes to teach, but Draco doesn’t want to leave on a sour note.
“Fuck,” he told his reflection. He almost wished it were a magical one that might commiserate with him. Instead his perfectly normal reflection glared back at him. He sighed and rested his forehead against the cool glass. “You are such an idiot, Potter.”
Wherever he is, Draco has obviously cum himself, because his hole is empty and the hand on his cock is gone. Instead, there’s just the gentle caress on his hip and then another down his sternum, then nothing at all.
He sinks into the perfect wet heat, relaxes his hold on Draco’s hair and lets him go for it. Draco hums and moans around his cock as if he’s been given a real treat, sliding further and further up his shaft. Draco has a terrible gag reflex so he never tries to fully take Harry’s cock, but that’s no matter when he lavishes such delicate attention on Harry’s cock with his tongue.
“For fucks sake, Potter.”
He’s counting hippogriffs again, up to nine when his robes are pulled. Absently he slaps a hand behind him, hoping to hit Potter, but there’s nothing there.
They are sitting across from one another at La Côte d’Or. Draco has changed his plain trousers and robes for dark slacks and a fine blue shirt. The colors match Harry’s own outfit, a high boat-neck navy frock accented by pearl earrings and barrettes. There’s also a diamond engagement ring on Harry’s fourth finger and a silver clutch resting on the table. Harry’s hair has been pulled and pinned back in such a way as to make it appear that there is much more of it than there is beneath the artificial bun at the back of his head.
“And no I’m not a Legillimens, Christ. It’s written all over your face.”
In Draco’s mouth, Harry’s cock twitches again, Draco licks and Harry thinks yeah, he can probably go again.
Malfoy was rummaging in his coat pocket. “Meet me here, Wednesday, at half ten.”
“Morning, Malfoy,” he says, reaching for the teapot to cover up how giddy he is that Draco’s sitting next to him at the breakfast table.
A resulting argument between Malfoy and the attendant ensued, which resulted in Malfoy shouting something that had to be an insult and Harry holding a bag containing five large tomatoes.
When at last Harry comes back into sight he removes the silencing charm and places the last card inside his mouth.
“What?”
That didn’t make sense.
Malfoy sat on the couch heavily and placed his head in his hands. To Harry’s horror his back began heaving up and down as he sobbed quietly into his hands.
Harry takes a step back, raises Draco into the air a bit more so that Draco’s inverted face is even with his own and releases the charm.
“It was your portrait who had the idea, remember.” Harry crosses the rope and continues the pattern, ties the knot off, then takes a step back until Draco is looking at him. “Do you really not like it? We can stop, and we never have to do it again if you don’t.”
And at that Draco huffs and buries his face against the fabric of his chest, because of fucking course Potter has an invisibility cloak.
Simultaneously, Potter thrusts his fingers in hard and sucks down Draco’s cock straight into his throat. Draco practically screams at the onslaught. Potter doesn’t show him any mercy and he is a particularly brutal cocksucker. It’s one of the things Draco loves about having sex with his otherwise frustrating colleague. There’s no build-up, no strokes or kitten licks. The second his mouth is on him, Potter slides his lips from tip to root and back, taking Draco’s cock deep enough that his cock’s spongy head slips in and out of his throat.
Harry gapped like a fish, looked around for a sign of Malfoy’s partner, and scrambled for an excuse. This was why he hadn’t cut it as an undercover Auror; he had never been a convincing liar.
It was the loneliness that eventually got to him. It was the drowning silences, the loss of the general buzz of a busy household inhabited by three children and a wife with a large extended family who all had round-the-clock access to the floo. Most days he kept the telly on for company, even though he didn’t understand what the adverts were trying to sell him on. Some days he considered buying a cat so he’d have something to talk to. The dead fern on the balcony was not much for conversation.
“Well, I intend to interpret it as such,” said Malfoy.
Draco likes it best when Potter comes to him but it’s been nearly a week since their last fuck and he’s been feeling needy. It’s also been a horrendous day. The second years seem to have forgotten everything he taught them last year about cauldron properties, and Darren Spurn from Hufflepuff dropped a full bottle of the Murtlap Essence Draco’s been working on for the hospital wing.
Sometimes Malfoy complained about Lucas. Sometimes he sang his praises.
They’re both gasping by the time Draco pulls out of Potter’s head. Considering the last images, they’re both hard too.
With some difficulty, Harry balances the morning newspaper, a cup of coffee and a bag from Marks & Spencers in one hand as he unlocks the door to his flat. He wasn’t expecting to see anyone inside, but his glance to the brunette reading on his couch is unconcerned.
Eventually an older woman with blond hair piled atop her head caught Malfoy’s eye from the street and joined them at their table. She nodded at Harry and then started rattling off French at such a rapid rate that Harry felt his eyes glazing over. Malfoy kept up his side of the conversation easily enough, but eventually Harry grew bored and started playing with the sugar packets on the table.
Draco arches a brow. They’ve only done it that way a few times before and it hasn’t been Draco’s favourite. Harry’s not exactly complaining about the alternative. “Not exactly,” he says. “How do you feel about potion abuse?”
Harry laughed about his bad pronunciation and learned how to carol in French, he drank far too many of Lauren’s awful flavored martinis and stopped for street food with Marie on the way home, that he would almost certainly regret in the morning.
“I can’t go on a date with you.”
“Thanks,” says Potter. His eyes look glassy behind the dirty lenses.
But no, Eddie’s finally fucking leaving and Potter is putting a locking spell on the door and turning to face him with a smirk.
“What do you smell?” he asks.
He is. He’s smiling, the prick.
Feeling soft and pampered Harry is led to the lingerie chest inside the walk-in. The cotton robe is left discarded and forgotten by the vanity, but Harry is not uncomfortable in his nakedness.
“Yeah, so did I,” added Albus as he flicked through channels on Harry’s telly. He’d spent the whole summer determined to find an English speaking show and had yet to be successful.
The boy suckled and licked while Harry panted and pulled himself back under control. Then just as Harry was starting to feel overly sensitive the boy withdrew and settled back on his knees. His smile was positively smug. Clearly, he was aware of his own talents.
It’s fucking fantastic. Harry makes him wait, holds his cock in his hand and tugs Draco forward, traces his lips with the tip. Draco breath pants out between parted lips as Harry stroke his foreskin down.
“I just wanted to do something fun,” Harry sighs, giving up. The man is impossible.
“I’m busy,” snaps Draco.
Malfoy was shaking his head. “I didn’t think you’d be any more interested in going to the Wizarding quarter any more than I would be. Not if you’re hanging around in the 14th Adrionessment.”
“Maybe I need to be alone for awhile too.”
Then there are the newer memories, the ones that started last year when Potter joined the faculty Draco’s been a part of for the past five years. The first staff meeting when they’d stared at one another curiously, then all the petty little arguments they’d had; over the tea biscuits, the patrol schedule, the best seat at the Head Table. There are other memories too. Ones that surprise him, ones interspersed with the ones he remembers. Images of Draco resting his head in his hand, idly stroking his lip as he reads over the agenda, Draco laughing with a group of sixth years in the corridor, Draco running his hands through his hair to remove the excess water after being caught out in a storm. The emotions associated are complicated and a surprising mirror of his own; attraction, affection, lust, obsession.
“Always,” says Draco, voice scratchy with sleep, though he doesn’t argue about being woken up for once, and instead curls into Harry’s chest. He yawns, breath tickling against Harry’s skin, lips brushing him just enough to bring forth goose pimples.
“Oh dear,” he says after a moment of completely ignoring Draco’s whining. “Is that the time?”
She gave him a look that clearly stated, ‘Are you kidding me?’
“But he’s out now?”
“Potter, I send my mother flowers after I forget her birthday. I send my landlady flowers whenever I am late on my rent. I’ll send a bouquet to my accountant’s office during the holidays to thank him for taking care of my taxes. I don’t send the man I’m sleeping with flowers. That practically screams, ‘Thank you for sucking my cock when no one else will you dainty little thing.’”
Draco’s cock feels fantastic, pressed against his, leaving sticky little lines against his stomach as he ruts against him.
Draco huffs, blowing his fringe out of his face as he works. He complains profusely whenever he helps Harry, but there’s an intensity that’s almost pleasure on his face as he works. It’s a look that Harry is becoming well familiar with.
“Oh right,” says Harry. He wiggles two fingers beneath the knot, plenty of room. “How does it feel?” he asks Draco.
Thursday, October 14
“Go out on a date with me. Tomorrow,” he said.
Throughout the night Malfoy made several attempts at catching Harry’s attention, mostly through sidelong glances and plaintive stares. Harry ignored all of it, particularly the way Malfoy had looked at him during the countdown, one lip pressed between his teeth, eyes wide and somehow vulnerable and challenging at the same time. Harry escaped in the aftermath of celebrating the New Year without saying goodbye to any of his friends.
Draco glances at the clock hanging on his office wall, his schedule hand is pointing to the dinner section and his stomach is feeling empty. A trickle of cum is running down his thigh as he considers.
Draco doesn’t answer until he’s finished chewing. He never talks with his mouthful as he has pointedly explained to Harry many times. “Why?”
Saturday, September 29
“Yeah, your offer included a sexy Auror robe. They wanted me in an apron,” says Ron.
“Merlin, Draco,” he gasps. “I can feel that vibrator, your cock feels fuckin incredible.”
There are so many memories. They’ve known one another for so long. Grown up together in one another’s orbit. Draco’s foot smashing down on Potter’s face, Draco crying in the bathroom, Draco disarming Dumbledore, Draco running from the castle, Draco standing beside the Dark Lord, Draco clutching at Potter’s back as fire rages all around, Draco restrained in a courtroom, Draco crying at the verdict and shaking Potter’s hand.
“Oh,” said Lauren and for a moment she stared off into nothingness. “That is very disturbing now that you mention it.” Lauren shook her head and continued. “What I was going to say is that he is no good because he’s married.”
“Right,” Harry tells them, clapping his hand once to get their attention. “Last demonstration before we go. Footwork. I’m noticing a lot of shoddy stances out there. Remember that a strong shield takes a great deal of your energy to maintain. What we want is to conserve our energy and strike out as efficiently as possible. If you make a smaller target, you make it harder for your opponent to aim. Professor Malfoy if you’d demonstrate for us?”
Malfoy eyed the new additions to Harry’s wardrobe with distaste, but did not comment.
He can hear Draco swallowing and his tongue surrounds his head when he’s finished, dipping into the little hole there for one last taste before pulling off.
Potter just shrugs as if these are inconsequential things. “So what? I’ve got my boyfriend's butt plug on the shelf, you think I care what anyone thinks?” And there’s that word again, boyfriend. Only this time Draco rather likes it.
Draco doesn’t take offence either, gives Harry a particularly smooth suck and uses his tongue to tease at the base of his shaft. He slides down once, until his nose is against Harry’s boxers, nearly to the base and then pulls off entirely with a wet smack. Harry takes the brief reprieve as a chance to let his trousers drop and push his boxers down his thighs. Draco, cock drunk and wide-mouthed, watches him, his hand parting his robes and sneaking into his trousers.
It’s impossible to tell through the gag, but Draco’s cursing at the man to press the damn button already.
It’s too late to stop, though Draco shouts into his gag, and tries to clench around the steadily thrusting vibrator. Eddie is standing in the doorway, two cups of tea in hand and staring directly at him.
“Arms first or last do you think?” asks Harry. “They’re taking a lot of the weight.”
Harry wondered if it should feel strange being around Malfoy again. Instead it felt perfectly normal for the other man to join in on his shopping trip.
“Yeah, Hermoine helped me figure out the spells to make it work at Hogwarts. It’s very finicky so we can’t get too close, but I thought you might want to see it.”
Harry’s mouth felt very dry. He hadn’t thought Malfoy was in town this weekend so he hadn’t given a second thought to walking past the shop. It was simply the shorter route from Sergio’s to his own flat. Would Malfoy believe that he’d fancied an early morning walk? Or that he’d had some sort of business meeting earlier that morning and was just coming back from the Métro? But no, Malfoy knew the Métro confused him, he’d never buy that one. “Out,” he said, which might have been the worst thing to say based on the look Malfoy turned on him in return.
“You don’t even know if I’m interested.”
Draco can’t find relief and the tears spring to his eyes again.
“I just don’t get why you can’t choose between fanny and prick!”
They stare at one another, Draco processing, Potter watching him process.
Draco smirks and exchanges a glance with Francis who is standing with the rest of the Slytherins in a supportive sort of gaggle beside him. “Bow and begin, Professor Potter.”
“What are you—” he says, he’s losing count, which is annoying, but Potter is down on his knees behind him tugging at the end of his robes.
It’s then that Harry looks down and sees the mess between Draco’s thighs. At some point he’d cum for a second time, completely untouched, sucking on Harry’s cock.
“I want it,” says Draco, but he doesn’t mention the potion at all and reaches for Harry’s belt, knocking Harry’s hands out of the way for access. “Guess I’m going to have to give it to you then, Potter. I’m going to make it so, so good for you.”
Afterwards, Draco sets aside his wand, and gently arranges Harry’s hands in his lap before sliding down to the floor and kneeling at Harry’s feet. The slippers are removed and displaced with care, and Harry’s feet exchange their perch of soft cushioning for firm thighs.
“I will murder you,” says Draco. “No one would even be surprised, would they? Everyone knows it’s only a matter of time before one of us kills the other, don’t they? Death by Death Eater?”
“Well, I got back after detention, and there were ground beetles in my hair—”
“Bloody hell, Malfoy,” said Harry as he looked around to see if anyone had taken offense to their exchange. “I would never say that to someone!”
Harry blinks, catches up, and grins. “Just thinking about how many times you’ve had to borrow Kreacher for that to be true.” It’s a cheap shot, betraying his best friend, but Hermoine’s furious, “Ronald Weasley,” buys him a moment of precious time.
He can feel the heat rise to his face. He hadn’t had a thought of leaving behind his sex toy with his supposed fuck buddy, but he certainly hadn’t expected to discover said sex toy displayed in the school he works in!
Harry nodded and held his shot glass out for a refill.
“Levicorpus.”
It's a warning.
He stops trying to hold back his tears and lets his body relax. Merlin fuck. Potter’s arranged this on purpose. Eddie can’t see him.
“I have some ideas,” he admits. There are some rather interesting scenarios he’s been kicking about. Things he knows Draco wouldn’t be adverse to at all. He’s been dying to try those handcuffs out again, or maybe something a bit more involved.
Draco pressed up against Harry’s side and sought out his hand with one of his own. Harry slid their palms together and clutched at the other man’s fingers.
“The furniture is mine,” Draco assures him. “I had the same thought. I moved everything over from the manor.”
Malfoy didn’t acknowledge Harry’s newly aware state and simply continued his exploration. The fingertips traced along his jaw, then back up to his cheekbones, and against his forehead. Harry closed his eyes as the fingers trailed down his face and opened both again when the fingers stopped against his lips.
Malfoy rolled his eyes and said something with the words “English” and “idiot” in it.
While Harry wasn’t sure what cosmopolitan actually meant, Matthew did turn out to be very attractive. And he was a grown up, two years older than him even, which Harry liked. They had a good conversation about trying to date younger men that had ended up being far more revealing than Harry had intended, but had been taken in good spirit.
“He likes you,” this time she repeated the words in a singsong sort of voice that his daughter would use.
His Malfoy-less existence only lasted three days, before he ran into the blond while walking down the street. Malfoy grabbed his arm and pulled at Harry until he was walking the same way and led them towards the newsagents where Malfoy was apparently picking up a weeks worth of reading material.
“Your cock, my arse?” Harry asks him sarcastically.
With a loud sigh to belay what an effort on his part the action was, Malfoy pulled his body up off the counter. “I know. I’m not talking about sex, Potter,” for some reason Harry’s name came out sounding exactly like ‘idiot.’ “Lucas stood me up on Friday. And this was the second time this week. And it was my birthday. And he turned off his phone. And he hasn’t responded to any of my messages.”
He sits back to see. And strangely, very strangely, two little shimmery-white bubbles are floating beside them. “Is that—”
Harry scowled, but that too felt like the right sort of response so he didn’t fight it. But when he didn’t immediately answer Malfoy took another bite of his desert that was so enormous that they didn’t speak for a number of minutes.
“Yeah,” says Harry, absently itching his chest. “Little monsters, the lot of them.”
Malfoy sighed with exaggerated patience and motioned for him to continue. “Merde, Potter! You’re invited, obviously, or I would have told you to fuck off as well.”
Too many years had passed since Harry had had a risk-free argument. The past ten years had been filled with plenty of arguments with his children and his wife, but very little banter. With his wife he’d rarely had the option to defend his own cause and had merely shut up when he’d been told to. With the children, whenever he felt he wasn’t on solid ground anymore he simply told them a white lie, or gave them a daddy-knows-best kind of line. During desperate times he was even known to provide a distraction in the guise of a sweetie or a shiny object.
“I know you took it.” Draco’s not even pretending to settle into the meal, balanced on the edge of his seat as he is.
They’re about to shoot off in their pants like randy teenagers when cold water splashes over them.
“It makes all the difference,” hisses Draco. Why can’t he understand that? “You think we can be seen together out of these halls? You think the world would take it easy on me if they thought I was corrupting their Savior? You think we could have what— a relationship?”
It also probably hadn’t helped that the cleaning spell Draco used on his robes had left a slight film and that they had needed to practically run to make it back to the Head Table on time for the Welcome Feast so he hadn’t had time to change. And probably Harry shouldn’t have asked Draco about the stain in front of the other professors and winked at the flimsy excuse of a misbehaving potion.
“Necessarily?” he prompts.
“We aren’t friends, Potter,” hisses Draco, but since he’s depositing a small wrapped present in his hand it’s a little hard to believe him.
“I’ve bought something for you,” he says, pushing Harry against the wall of the Hog’s Head.
“Sorry,” he stammers to his friends. “Just— loo, be right back.”
“What did you have in mind?” he asks.
He’s really anything but, his legs are stiff, his hole is full and aching now the fucking is over, and his face is pressed uncomfortably against the table. Oh, and another set of his robes are ruined. It is sort of nice having Potter’s weight pressed against the length of his body though so he doesn’t say anything.
“Just a taste,” says Draco just before he flicks his tongue, the tip just barely touching Harry’s cock head, dipping into the slit there and wiggling just so.
Draco waves his wand lazily and casts a freezing charm to hold both boys in place. “Think it’s time we finished up for the evening, yes?”
“Yeah?” asks Harry, lost in the sensation. “Where do you want it? Face or chest?”
“It’d take more than some devil's snare, Malfoy.”
“Yes,” said Malfoy, still speaking into the crocks of his arms where they crossed beneath his head.
“Nothing wrong with playing the field, Hermione. Just because you didn’t need to doesn’t mean the rest of us are so lucky.”
“The entire year the real Moody was locked in a trunk in his office. He never taught a single lesson,” said Harry. His hand was tingling.
He knows what he needs. With one hand in his hair, Harry tips Draco’s head back. “Tell me,” he orders. “Tell me what you want.”
“Absolutely,” said the woman. “How do you two know each other then?”
Monday, September 10
Marie was blissfully unaware of his past attraction to Malfoy, and Kate had been the one to set him up with Matthew, so Harry sequestered himself in a corner with the girls. Kate’s husband Jon was a decent conversationalist, but he was more interested in celebrating with his wife while the baby was at home with the sitter than in talking with Harry. At around ten Craig and Pierre came through, ‘Making the rounds’ as Craig explained, they invited Harry to join them at their next party which they promised to be much more fun, but Harry declined.
“Wha—” he starts, but it’s just Draco.
“I’m not sure you want to know,” he answers since he cannot even confirm a number.
And that changes things.
The ropes pull Draco’s hands up and over his head, just how Harry likes them. He opens his mouth to talk but Harry silences him with a silencio. “No,” he says. “You don’t need to talk. Or see for that matter, obscuro.” The blindfold wraps around Draco’s head, covering his eyes, so he can’t see it coming when Harry places a hand on his chest and shoves.
“This isn’t the prettiest city I’ve been to. It isn’t the friendliest, or the most interesting, and I don’t speak the language so it’s certainly not the most inviting for a man like me. But when I got here, no one gave two shits about me at all. They had this gala in my honor, and half the invitees didn’t show. My liaison with the French Ministry hated me, and I’m pretty sure she was spitting in my coffee. And every time I showed up for work in the morning, security made me provide two forms of identification.”
Which he did after wanking himself off as fast as possible.
He was at the Sunday market and a man was heaping tomatoes into a large bag, trying to bring the total up to five kilos. Harry waved his hands at him and tried to gesture using his fingers that he meant five tomatoes not five kilos, but the man didn’t seem to understand.
Malfoy would never be the handsome sort, his face was too angular and his body was too sharp for that. But he’d grown his hair out so that it floated around his shoulders and his face, and he had gained a grace in his movements that had not been present when they were both boys. It helped to soften his still pinched expression. It also probably helped that he was clearly enjoying his conversation partner. Harry was sure he’d never seen Malfoy smile and laugh so openly back in England.
“You okay?” he asks, looking down.
By now Harry was used to Malfoy’s particular brand of bluntness. “I’ve just been thinking,” he said. “That I’m ready to be in a relationship again.”
Sometimes, they would meet for coffee before work. Not as a set thing, but more accidental run-ins before the elevators. Hermoine would be brimming with her usual excitement, ready for the challenges of the new day. Chatting away about the latest research she’d read out of Norway and how it might be implemented or the community outreach initiative she’d underwritten. Then when she’d turn and ask him about his day, he’d have nothing to say. Not one thing that filled him with that same enthusiasm, that same happiness.
As she reluctantly handed him the lovingly prepared bundle he had a moment’s commiseration for a parent separated from one’s child. “Can’t you visit him?” he asked as he wondered who Malfoy had spent Christmas with anyways.
Overall, Harry enjoyed himself. Even if the other adults were not keen on making conversation, he still had the company of his children and all of his nieces and nephews. Even Teddy and Andromeda had stopped by to spend time with him. And as he had come bearing Parisian presents, he had been as popular as Father Christmas for a few minutes.
Yeah right, thinks Draco, considering it’s his arms in question he’s about to be hung from.
It wasn’t something Harry needed to think about it at all, but he felt he owed Matthew enough to try. “I don’t think I ever asked if you liked Lucas better than me, did I?”
Maybe he should tease him about his answer a little more, but looking down at his parted lips Harry can’t resist dipping in for a taste.
“Right, with just no one, I suspect.”
“It’s blood magic,” admits Draco. “Definitely in the Dark Arts category.”
A week later when Harry was halfway through painting his bedroom a deep royal blue a thought occurred to him. A few actual living potted plants on the balcony and maybe a vase or two of colorful flowers in the kitchen would really do wonders to brighten up the place. Then realizing his train of thought, Harry scowled at the half finished wall angrily and painted a large, bold, ‘NO’ in the remaining white space. He stared at it for a while, until he felt that the intention had sunk in and then painted over it.
Malfoy hadn’t noticed Harry standing awkwardly on the sidewalk outside of the café, and likely wouldn’t, given how he was practically bent over the table towards his dining mate. No, tonight there was only one man for Malfoy’s eyes and it wasn’t Harry.
Professor Malfoy’s Personal Rooms
“Feeling needy, Malfoy?” asks Potter who then shoves Draco down onto the seat. “Missing something?”
It felt fucking amazing and all Harry wanted to do was coat the boy in come, but his orgasm still eluded him. There was something wrong with the situation. Sergio’s was young and gorgeous, and his arse was amazing, but another face kept floating through his mind.
It glistens with an unnatural looking pearlescent sheen. Harry feels wary from the first glance.
Professor Potter’s Office
This turned out to be the extent of their communication skills as Sergio only spoke a few bits and pieces of English, and Harry only knew about the same in either Spanish or French. But still, Harry left Sergio’s little flat with a bounce in his step and a smile on his face.
“Let’s go back to the part about your arse,” says Harry, giving the other man a saucy wink.
“You do realize that every little thing that happened before, after, and during the war was not entirely your fault, right? But if you do insist on blaming yourself, I have a list of things that are, in fact, related to you.”
Harry didn’t know why he kept drinking espresso. He didn’t even really like coffee that much, particularly when it was strong as hell and came in the most emasculating tiny cup. But he didn’t know any French and he at least knew how to pronounce ‘espresso’ without embarrassing himself.
“You’ll see yourself out,” Draco says as Harry pulls off his borrowed jewelry. Draco’s already seated back at his desk, his voice is disinterested once more.
After five years Harry left the Auror Corps.
Draco huffs and snaps; “Glad you’re so relaxed,” but his heart isn’t in, Harry can tell. “Shall I expect to continue to be your test dummy then?”
His need to cum is near-instantaneous, so strong are the sensations. This is why he’s particularly surprised to see Potter walk away from him to clean his hands and roll down his cuffs.
She does not take the bait. “You’ve post from three different wizards and a witch all asking for dates,” she says once she’d finished riffling through his letters. She tosses the stack back onto the table where she must have found them and gives him a disapproving look.
Harry actually felt his jaw drop. “You’ve got to be kidding. My head of house had it out for your house? Don’t you think that’s a bit, y’know, pot calling the kettle black and all that?”
He won’t let Draco thrust up, keeps one hand pressed against his hip to keep him still, but Draco only needs to lay back and take it because Potter is capable of fucking his face with Draco’s cock all on his own.
He gamely set up a Muggle bank account, located the nearest supermarket, applied for a credit card, and hooked up the old fashioned rotary phone to the network, even though he didn’t know anyone else with a Muggle phone number. He wandered the streets in his neighborhood, learned how to hail a taxi, and stayed far, far away from the Wizarding sector.
Harry sighed and shook his head. “There’s no crocodile, sweetheart.” Once she scampered off to look at the flowers Harry shot Malfoy a dirty look. “Thanks. Now she’s going to have nightmares about being eaten by an crocodile.”
“I have a favour,” Potter starts.
“Right,” he said as he hopped off what he had come to think of as his stool. “See you around, Malfoy.”
There’s a little smile on Neville’s lips and he’s gone all soft. “Not unless your greatest desire is to meet my baby daughter.” And that’s right, Neville’s wife Hannah just found out in September that she’s pregnant. “I see her and Hannah and me in our cottage in Hogsmeade.” He glances sidelong at Draco. “Feel like sharing yours?”
One of the first things Harry discovered about the grown-up Draco Malfoy was that he works very hard to make sure all of his students trust him and feel safe around him. Both the name Malfoy and the Potions Master of Hogwarts title carry too much weight to not be cautious and shouting at Harry Potter over breakfast probably won’t help his image with the newest Hogwarts students.
“I only need the one labelled 1982,” she tells them. “Although you may as well collect ‘84 while you’re at it. If the Ministry wants Coarker’s O.W.L. results it’s only a matter of time before they request his N.E.W.T.S.”
That thought sends Draco over the edge again and he’s cumming for the second time, spurting out over his stomach and Potter’s stone floor.
Surprisingly Potter shakes his head. “Oh you’ll make it up to me, but that’s not what I want.” He tosses the last steak and forces Draco to wait while he washes up.
Potter glances up briefly and his quill stops. Draco’s rather pleased by the sweeping glance that heats his skin, but is less pleased when Potter says; “I really can’t. McGonagall’s asked me to present my duelling curriculum to the board tomorrow and it’s nowhere near ready.”
Harry lifts his wand and forces Draco’s body to rotate in a slow circle. He’s like an inverted ballerina, or spiderman maybe, but that doesn’t sound as sexy and if he mentions it to Draco he’ll ask who’s been crossbreeding with acromantulas.
There’s a snort and then Draco’s swung his thigh over both of Harry’s, trapping him to the bed. “I’ll have my goblin transfer the money to that accountant of yours, but so long as I’m paying extra…”
Fortunately, the man is a pleasure to obey, far more gratifying than Calista Monroe, who seems to enjoy watching him do housework in hot pants.
Right, thought Harry. Husband in prison, son in exile, and sister still estranged.
“I love those little noises you make for me,” says Potter, thrusting again to make Draco whimper. “You’re opening up so well. Just look at you.”
“He’s not really a toy though is he?” says Harry. Draco’s fingers running through his hair aren’t doing the usual job of relaxing him. He feels all wound up, coiled like a spring. He’d been hoping to get his energy out with Draco in bed, but it seems like Draco’s already had his fun without him.
The crushed lacewing flies fall into the cauldron and the potion ripples, turning darker just like it’s supposed to. Draco has to lean over the cauldron to monitor the progress. 30 seconds now, he taps his wand to reduce the heat.
“Happy Christmas, Mr. Potter. I hope that you’ve enjoyed your holiday,” she said. She had a fancy box of truffles clutched in one hand.
He stops bouncing and grinds himself down on Draco’s cock, letting it pulse in his hole, letting those vibrations tingle faintly against his sensitive skin. He pulls up, luxuriating in the long slide, Draco’s cockhead stroking him from within until it nearly pops out of his hole, then the long slide back in as Harry sits back down. “Going to cum all over that pretty face,” he says as he jerks off. He’s so close, just needs a little more.
“Existing on your pleasure alone? On servicing your every need?” Draco pauses to suck sharply at his collarbone. “I’ll be gagging for it, you can make me beg for a single glance.”
Harry tried to think of a comeback, but really this whole experience was already too ridiculous for words, so he just reached for a menu that was thankfully in both English and French.
The front of his robes are soaked through and the touch of the rough fabric is suddenly too much, but Draco gives himself one last squeeze as the last drops spill out.
“So torso then, then legs, then arms,” says Harry.
Draco doesn’t move a muscle, even when Potter shoots him a heated look and climbs aboard the train. They’re meant to be doing the final inspection together, to collect the inevitable wayward items of teenage detritus, but Potter can damn well handle it alone. He couldn’t care less about left behind textbooks right now.
Harry’s never thought of himself as a jewellery sort of a guy. Draco’s been known to wear rings on certain occasions and has a gorgeous collection of watches, but he’s never seen a reason Draco would buy something like this pendant. It’s not flashy, or even expensive-looking, just a pretty standard dark stone on a silver chain. It falls to Harry’s breastbone and rests against his red sweater, the weight barely noticeable.
Suddenly Harry felt very awake and it felt like his heart was beating very, very fast.
“It sounds like you’ve been going from relationship to relationship for a long time. When was the last time you were alone?”
Harry’s first thought was—
Draco eyes him up for a moment but is already turning back to Percy. “Speak for yourself, Percy’s never steered me wrong before. He likes my cock too much to break it, don’t you, you old pervert?”
“Matthew Clarkson is a terribly Muggle name.”
His breathing is finally returning to normal, though his nose and throat still ache from being so abruptly filled with water. Harry sniffs and rolls over to face Draco. “You like me,” he says. Draco rolls his eyes and turns his head so Harry can see.
Harry was sitting across the room staring at his hands when Malfoy woke up. The other man’s eyes were open, staring questioningly at him, as if surprised to find him sitting so far away. Harry stared back.
“Don’t you want me?” Malfoy’s voice was so small.
“Give it back,” snaps Draco.
He was not.
He continued arguing with himself until he realized that he was peering into the bathroom mirror, actually trying to put some style into his hopeless hair. He was primping for Draco Malfoy.
Malfoy arched a finely manicured eyebrow and gave Harry a look that was so familiar it made him feel grounded instantly. A world where Draco Malfoy was doing things like smiling and moaning was ridiculous. A world where Draco Malfoy was doing his best to express, ‘How much of an idiot are you really, Potter?’ made much more sense. Instead, Malfoy said, “Hello, Potter. What the hell are you doing here?”
Draco’s cock is still resting wetly against his thigh when Harry finally detaches the scratchy lace bra. It’s ruined now; Draco’s teeth have torn a hole in one of the fine lacey cups. Harry almost feels a pang at its loss--it was brand new only hours ago--but then he reminds himself that he doesn’t exactly enjoy wearing those things.
Draco’s not looking at him anymore, but he’s doing his best not to look at anything really. Harry’s doing his best not to look at Draco’s arm, the one he knows is smeared with ink like an old bruise. The one Draco keeps covered up as much as possible though he isn’t embarrassed when Harry catches a flash.
Draco speeds up, just slightly, uses his free hand to give Harry’s balls a little squeeze, presses a finger just behind, then trails back between Harry’s thighs and teases against the tight whirl of Harry’s hole. It’s the light touch, there, between his cheeks that does it for Harry, just as Draco takes him down until his tip is pressed just shy of Draco’s throat. That, and the whine as Draco’s hand in his trousers as he takes himself over the edge.
“Not my fault you didn’t levitate the fish into the lake like a normal wizard.”
“It’s not though is it?” asked Harry. Nothing about the place was magical in a wands-and-wizards sort of a way. Maybe there was another type of magic going on, but it wasn’t one Harry had seen before.
“Whom else would they be for?”
Harry pivots as slowly as he possibly can, and yes, he’s right, the lace bra scratches against his chest, and the thong between his cheeks feels as unpleasant as he thought, but neither do anything to quell his still half-hard cock. Or Malfoy’s, it seems, who presses the heel of one hand between his legs before leading Harry back to the vanity.
Harry flicks his eyes over Draco. He’s in his pyjamas, the toff silk ones with his initials monogrammed on the chest, and his hair is wet from a recent shower, but he doesn’t look the least bit wound up. He’s relaxing casually back into the pillows, all soft and touchable.
Sometimes Potter is such a child. He shrugs one shoulder and pushes his bottom lip out. “You could come to my rooms. Tonight.”
“Sexy,” says Harry, Draco bites the lobe of his ear again.
Draco eyes him for a moment and then slides down to cuddle Harry close. This time Harry doesn’t resist, let’s Draco spider his hands in between his shirt buttons and throw a leg over his. “Make it up to you?” he whispers, pressing his face to the skin behind Harry’s ear.
Potter laughs easily, but of course, he didn’t have his orgasm interrupted by the arrival of the gamekeeper. No, he’d filled Draco’s arse with his sticky cum then fucked off. Draco had been left holding his cock and with his pants literally around his ankles in the platform waiting room while his useless fuckbuddy tried to head Hagrid off. Even then he’d only just had enough time to pull his pants and trousers up, his unhappy cock tucked into the waistband before Hagrid was welcoming him back for another year.
Malfoy rolled his eyes and reached for his coffee as if just remembering its presence. He took a sip and made a face; it must have gone cold. “One out of three is not good when the wager is your life.” There was a pause enough for Draco to order them both another espresso (Harry was starting to wonder just how much coffee one could have in one day) then, “So who turned me into a ferret?”
It’s a pretty normal pub night. Hermoine and Ron don’t have many chances to get away now that little Rosie is old enough to show off some of that Weasley mischief. It’s nice to have these chances to catch up, even though they don’t talk about much of anything at all. Harry shares stories about the students, but doesn’t feel like he has much else to talk about. There’s only one big thing going on in his life he wants to share, and he can’t. Or, he could, but until Draco says it’s okay he’s not going to risk ruining it.
He debates with himself for less than a minute and then decides, fuck it, pulls his cock out, and slips the necklace back on. Immediately his arse is filled again, only it’s not fingers now, it’s something thicker and smoother, sliding in and out with perfect, slippery ease. Harry reaches two fingers between his legs and… no, he’s not open at all, it just feels like he is. And if it’s not his arse that’s being fucked then…
Harry grins.
“Not exactly,” said Malfoy in an almost whisper. “I met a man who wanted to keep me.”
There was also an address, a shop number, a mobile number, and even an email address. Apparently Draco Malfoy, Prince of the Purebloods, had done a full Muggle.
“Now when you release the featherlight charm you must be careful to do so one limb at a time. If you release it all at once it will put too much strain on the bound muscles.”
Harry takes a long sip and lets the warm tea slide down his throat and warm him from the inside out. Draco has slid his gaze over to him and is sitting so rigidly still that Harry knows his plan is working.
“Great,” says Harry. “Aurora? You keen?”
Draco doesn’t have time to answer, he’s at seven hippogryphs and he can’t stop now. Potter rolls his hips, pressing in impossibly further and Draco gasps— “ten hippogryphs! Eleven—”
He screams into his gag and hopes the bastard can hear him. It would serve him right to be caught. Maybe he can claim that Potter’s some kind of sex fiend. Well.. he is a sex fiend, but maybe…
It feels better than Harry could have imagined, to have all that bare skin rubbing against his, feeling the strong muscles of Draco’s back under his hand.
The woman shot him a look and said something Harry didn’t understand. He gave her a sheepish smile in return.
Potter eases off and gives Draco space to breathe. “I still want to wait on telling anyone else,” Potter’s smile falters so Draco presses on. “Until Christmas,” he compromises. “Just until Christmas.” It’s only a few months away, long enough for Draco to see how this plays out, for him to be sure.
Draco becomes, if possible, even more, desperate now, and makes quick work of Harry’s belt buckle. Harry has to scramble to keep up but manages to divest Draco of his own trousers and pants by the time his own are falling around his ankles. They kick them aside, along with their socks and shoes, as Draco sucks another love bite into the skin under Harry’s chin and then they are pressing together, naked from head to toe.
“I want you to perform Legilimency on me.”
Resting his weight on his feet Draco lifts himself and angles his hole over Potter’s cock. It’s an awkward angle, but he’s slippery and open so it’s easy enough to find Potter’s cockhead by catching it on his rim. He sighs as he welcomes it into his body, loving that first initial, unyielding stretch. He can’t get as deep as he’d like, but he can angle his hips so Potter’s cock is just hitting his prostate. He needs the extra stimulation because he’s not going to be able to get his hand on himself in this position. He needs both hands gripping the desk behind him for leverage.
“Like a treat!” Percy calls. Harry’s turned him to face the wall, so his voice is a little muffled, and a little annoyed.
The little shit is hiding in the staff room.
He wants to push Potter away with his foot, but he hasn’t the energy to do it.
Draco does a little wiggle. “Feels fine to me,” he says. “Takes a bloody long time though, doesn’t it?”
She smiled sadly and Harry was struck by how lovely she must have been as a girl and how world worn she looked now. “He prefers that I stay away. Just, tell him I love him.” Then as if she thought this an imposition she added, “If you would, Mr. Potter. I do so appreciate this.”
Malfoy jumped and nearly turned the hose on Harry in his surprise. He didn’t look any more pleased with Harry than he did with the geranium.
“For fuck sakes,” snaps Draco.
There was the sharp feeling of panic, an echo from his days before the divorce when he’d used an alias, glamour, or polyjuice. But this boy was a Muggle, and even if he weren’t, no one cared about Harry Potter in Paris.
“No plans to haul me back to England, or to throw me in Azkaban?” Malfoy did not appear to be concerned by either of these prospects and was instead lounging back in his chair with an almost bored expression.
Across the room, Percy sighs heavily. “Alas, the only entertainment I was provided with was the sight of the dormice chewing their way through the door frame.” Which is oddly comforting. It would definitely be worse to find out his boyfriend and Severus Snape have both got off with the same bloke, portrait or not. “Draco is infinitely more enjoyable.”
“Twelve hippogryphs,” thrust, “Thirteen hippogryphs,” thrust, “Fourteen— ah— hipp—” thrust, “Fif—teen...” thrust.
The truth in those words hurt, but Harry forced himself to look away again. “But not really. Not truly single.”
The effects are near-instant, it’s remarkable to watch. One moment Harry is tipping the potion into Draco’s mouth, watching as Draco’s eyes slide shut. The next moment his body gives a little shake and Harry’s worried about him falling over so he grabs him around the waist to hold him up. Draco relaxes in his arms, hands coming up to grip Harry’s shoulders, head tipped back as if in ecstasy. It looks like it feels fantastic, honestly, whatever the effects of the potion are.
“Hey, arsehole!”
“I can’t believe that’s your partner.”
“Yeah,” Harry agrees. He’s not exactly immune himself. “You look hot as hell.”
“I know you aren’t upset over sex, Malfoy, or who is or isn’t having it,” snapped Harry, getting a little annoyed. He’d seen the other man parade about countless times with secret little smiles on his face in response to thoughts that Harry ‘just wouldn’t understand’ or messages sent to his mobile at inappropriate moments.
“Right,” says Harry. “That means we get to spin again, Draco, you ready?”
He squeaks indignantly as his chest is pressed into the desk. He can feel the tension building in his body, his balls tightening up, Potter’s cock is stroking over his prostate sending shivers up his spine.
“Thought you’d like that,” says Draco. “Also, the antidote,” he passes a second slim vial into Harry’s hand and wraps his fingers around it. “I’ll close my eyes, you’ll need to hide it. If I know where it is after I’ve taken the Amortenia I’ll try to get rid of it so I can keep you.”
“Alright, alright, is this what you want, you randy slut?” And then he presses the button at the bottom of the vibrator and the thing starts fucking him. Sliding in and out in a long smooth motion, battering his prostate with vibrations on every thrust.
“Of course, Draco.”
“You weren’t kidding. What’s that, 50 inches?”
The next morning the children slept in until their pre-arranged late check out while Harry packed up their luggage. Then he made it through the tearful goodbyes with his children who were heading back to the home Harry had once shared with Ginny, while Harry was left making his way to Hogsmeade alone.
“Two more minutes,” says Hagrid as he checks his pocket watch.
For some reason Harry’s heart had sunk at the first mention of ‘years,’ though he did not want to question why. “What’s so bad about him? Malfoy seems pretty happy.”
“It means ‘you are full of shit.’ Now, for the advanced learner: Ta mere suce des bites en enfer.”
“Do it,” pants Draco and that’s all the encouragement he needs to cum all over his pretty face. Harry gasps as he shoots, across Draco’s cheek, into his hair, then his chin, Draco’s tongue slipping out for a taste. When he’s finished, he looks wrecked and Harry can’t resist bending down and kissing those filthy lips. Draco tastes of cock and cum, but it’s still delicious.
L’Artisan Fleuriste
Malfoy didn’t seem to notice his unease. “Shit, Potter. It means, shit.” He stared at Harry in contemplation and took a deep sip of his espresso. “If you’re going to live here you should probably know a couple good curses. Quarreling is practically mandatory in Paris and you’re going to get yelled at sooner or later. So, repeat after me: Vouz avez plein de merde.”
There’s a smile on Draco’s face, but he still looks sad. “You think you do, but it won’t last. Not with who I am.” Draco shakes off Harry’s hand and lifts his arm, carefully unbuttoning his cuff and rolling back his sleeve.
Desperately he grabs for his wand and waves it over the cauldron hoping too much time hasn’t passed then collapses against the desk.
Harry scowled at his tiny espresso cup and waited for Malfoy to finish and somehow acknowledge him, preferably once the other man decided to remove his tongue from the roof of his mouth. Even Malfoy’s lost-in-very-important-thought look required drawing attention to an orifice Harry would rather ignore on a man he didn’t particularly like.
“I’ve told you. Hogsmeade. I want to go get a drink with you. And maybe dinner. I keep asking.”
It’s the fastest he’s ever cum in his whole life, probably faster than any of his teenage wanks even. And just as promised, the spell ends the moment he’s finished coming. He rests against Draco as his heart rate speeds down, remembering at the last moment to cancel the spell on both of Draco’s nipples. He doesn’t even have to ask if Draco has cum, there’s no way anyone could manage longer than two minutes of that.
Eddie shares a story about a biting teapot that makes Draco laugh and then invites him up to his rooms to finish the agenda during lunch. Draco agrees before Eddie excuses himself to prepare for his first class.
Harry sighed when it was clearly Malfoy had no intention of continuing without some concession on his behalf. “Right, I’ll keep my mouth shut, but I really want to know. What did they give you when you left England?”
“It’s been hard to find the time, honestly,” says Hermoine.
For a moment there’s nothing he can do but stay hunched over on his hands and knees as his hole is gently scissored and stretched. He’d be terrified, only the fingers are so, so familiar and Draco Malfoy is so, so dead.
With a sigh Harry tightened his arms around the man beside him until Malfoy’s face was pressed back against his chest. He didn’t know what to say so instead of speaking they lay together in silence for a long time until eventually he fell asleep.
At that Harry has to pause, letting the rope slip through his fingers. “Have you had curry before?” he asks and again Draco is quiet. Harry groans. “Honestly, what is wrong with purebloods? Never had sushi, never had enchiladas, and now never had curry, what else? Do you just sit around eating steak and lobsters or what? I’m putting curry on the list.”
“Someone who’s married already.”
Usually, Draco is proud of his poise and grace, but at this moment he’s happy to let Potter’s groping hand guide him to the nearest hard surface even as his prick begins to thicken in his cupped palm. They stumble in the narrow hall, and Draco bashes his shoulder against the doorway, but somehow they make it into the compartment.
Harry gets up on his knees before him, naked, holding his cock in one hand while he thumbs his foreskin down.
“I bet I could throw a smashing dinner party. I’d definitely win the thousand pounds.”
Despite the fantastic orgasm Draco had provided, at the reminder of the portrait’s presence he’d gone all huffy again.
“Might have to think of a really good way to pay me back then,” says Harry, tipping into a smile. “Something better than lesson planning I mean.”
Harry nodded in understanding and they shared a brief moment of commiseration for the standards of their education.
As with most social situations, Harry wasn’t very good at parties. He tended to gravitate towards kitchens, and usually drank too much since he always felt the need to have something to do with his hands. Malfoy and Lauren were both in attendance when Harry finally found the right address and figured out how to buzz the appropriate apartment from the street. Lauren met him at the door and guided Harry into the kitchen for a drink, but Malfoy hadn’t so much as glanced his way. He was far too preoccupied with his conversation partner.
In all the time he’d spent with Malfoy over the past few months, he’d never once seen the other man’s wand. He hadn’t been sure Malfoy even had one anymore. Harry sucked in his breath through his teeth and nodded in understanding.
Draco sets the pieces aside, pulling out the panties and kneels once more at Harry’s feet. One delicate hand grasps around Harry’s ankle and Harry lifts his feet on cue, first one, then the other. Draco rises to his knees, bringing the silky panties up Harry’s calves then his thighs. Harry’s erection has softened somewhat so that he is now only semi-hard, but Draco easily captures his cock in the soft material without ever brushing it with a bare hand. The elastic waistband feels tight against Harry’s belly and his cock feels almost too confined, but even he has to admit that the fabric does feel amazing. He’s not so sure about the way the thong splits his arse though, but since the sight of it makes even Draco forget himself and swallow heavily, Harry won’t complain.
Malfoy groaned and pushed Harry through the threshold back into his apartment. Pickles made a yowling noise at the intrusion and scampered off. Malfoy kicked the door shut behind them and reached for Harry again. This time Harry skittered away, breathing heavily.
Harry watches as Draco riffles through his desk drawer and comes up with a pair of magic limiting cuffs.
“You do realize that it’s illegal to read another wizard’s mail?” he says as he falls into an armchair. There’s no point in removing the mail in question from Hermione’s hands; she’d only accuse him of hiding something then.
“Fuck,” says Potter. He has two fingers teasing the loosened hole, stroking them through the cum there. Draco relaxes at the touch and he feels his rim flutter as more leaks out onto Potter’s fingers. Draco whimpers and squeezes his cock. The tip of one of Potter’s fingers presses in, just slightly, not nearly enough. Draco tries to push down on it, but Potter stops that with a hand pressed to his hip. “Ask me nicely, then.”
His cock throbs, he can feel it start to chub up where it’s resting against his thigh. He’s not sure if it’s Draco’s words or the way he’s pressing into his body, for once taking the initiative and bending forwards to press sucking kisses into his neck.
Draco’s wand is back in his robes before Harry has processed what’s happened, but damn does he feel the stinging hex when it hits his hip.
Lauren laughed and held the plate out of Draco’s reach. “It’s Harry’s birthday, Draco, he gets the first slice.”
Harry rubs his nipple, it’s brushing unpleasantly against his sweater, he should have worn an undershirt. “Like you weren’t offered a spread yourself, Ron.”
And that’s a thought he doesn’t need because, despite the clutter, the shelves are suspiciously dust free. At some point, some poor Hogwarts elf has had to clean the toy he’s had up his arse.
“I broke it off with Lucas,” said Malfoy. “Last month. I haven’t seen him in weeks.”
“Your perfect cock sucking mouth,” moans Harry as he thrusts his hips even though Draco can’t do much more than bob his head and work his tongue to participate. His fingers itch to reach for Harry as they normally do, but they’re tied back and out of reach, so instead he squeezes them together and focuses on sucking firmly. “Merlin,” breathes Harry as Draco creates a vacuum seal, sucking down the precum on Harry’s tip, dipping his tongue into the slit for an extra taste.
It wasn’t like being at war. It wasn’t good versus evil, light versus dark. It was just him, Harry. Doing the best he could to make a difference and hoping it was enough.
At first Harry thought through a number of answers he had given to others. When he’d quit, he’d told his boss he might like to work at the French Ministry for a bit. After the divorce hearing he’d told Ginny that he just needed to get out of England. To the few people he could call friends by the time he’d left, he’d lied that he had always been somewhat of a Francophile. All of these things could have been true, and might have been at one point in his life, but they weren’t the real reason.
Harry took a page out of his son’s book and stuck his tongue out at the other man’s back. It felt surprisingly good.
They stare at one another for a moment and Draco doesn’t know what to do. He doesn’t know if they are going to fight or fuck.
Harry can only nod dumbly and allows himself to be pushed back against Draco’s desk. Draco’s like an octopus, fingers roving through Harry’s chest hair, tickling his sides, stroking up his thighs. Honestly, the sensations are too overwhelming even before Draco brings his mouth into play.
The newspaper came out again once the train began moving, as did Malfoy’s tongue-to-teeth habit. Somehow the other man managed both feats all while standing upright on the moving train, one arm slung around a strategically placed pole to help maintain balance. Harry claimed a plastic seat as quickly as possible and instantly preferred the cramped form of travel to floo.
Harry watched the expressions play across Malfoy’s face with an interest akin to fascination. There was bliss, joy, ecstasy, and an almost sexual moan of delight. All of which were more revealing expressions than Harry had been witness to during all six years of school together.
When Harry hadn’t said anything, Draco rested his forehead against his back and sighed. “What do you want me to do, Harry? I’m sorry.”
“Yeah,” Harry had said. “But you left out the part where you got your perverted portrait out of the closet so it could tell you what to do.”
“Oh, absolutely,” says Percy.
“He is rather, isn’t he?” said Harry, enjoying both the fact that he was now involved in the conversation, and turning one of Malfoy’s own friends against him.
Malfoy batted his eyelashes and continued grinning. “You told me that I am amazing and that you are but a fool.”
Another card goes off against his chest just as Harry’scockhead pops into the beginning of his throat. He shouts around the intrusion, then immediately gags, but Harry’s cock pops right out as he swings away. It’s back a second later, and the process is repeated, pop, snap, gag, pop, snap, gag. Harry’s hands come up around his ears and hold his head in place, keeping him from rocking and he starts thrusting in and up, lets Draco start sucking again, running his tongue frantically against the vein on the underside of his cock, filling his mouth with a steady trickle of precum.
Perhaps sensing that he’s still hesitating Draco lets his expression relax again and says; “Please Harry, you know what I need.”
“You said once that you wanted a real relationship,” said Malfoy in answer.
Again Harry did his best to muddle through. “And that?” he asked once Malfoy seemed satisfied. This time it took closer to five tries.
And when he squeezes Harry’s hand, Harry squeezes his hand back.
“I’m right here,” says Percy the Pervy Portrait. Harry and Draco ignore him.
“Sexy,” laughs Harry, finishing the latest knot and testing underneath with his fingers.
“I’ve met someone.”
He and Malfoy had never spoken of Harry’s relationship with Ginny past the information that they had been married for a number of years and had decided to divorce. Malfoy had never even let on whether or not he knew why he and Ginny had divorced in the first place.
The vibrator slides in and Draco forgets all about schedules. There’s no real stretch, it’s a slim toy, but the vibrations drive him mad. He bucks as best he can while dangling from his hands, toes scraping against the floor for leverage.
“I said, you’re busy.” Draco sighs in exaggeration and grabs Potter’s shoulder. “Potter,” he whines directly into his ear.
“Right near your shop actually.” Harry had realized it only this morning when he had been contemplating Malfoy’s business card and realized that it was the address of the florist shop he regularly passed on his walks to the Eiffel Tower.
Malfoy sighed. “Can’t you call me by my name at least, please Harry?”
Angrily he tossed the card onto his bedside table and walked to the ensuite. What did he care about Draco Malfoy anyway? It wasn’t his business what the man was doing in Paris or why he was a florist of all things. He was nearly thirty-six; he should have stopped caring about schoolboys years ago.
“Now the cards,” says Percy.
“So you’ll come back?” asked Malfoy and damn him, he actually looked hopeful. Harry’s smile faded. Malfoy snorted and looked away. “Of course not.”
He loves the lavish attention, the variety, and the unexpected thrill that comes with meeting a new client. And above all, he loves the sex. The real truth of it all is that he’d probably pay for someone to do the things he’s experienced to him. It’s just good fortune that he instead gets paid for it.
“Don’t encourage him, Potter,” he was instructed in clipped tones as Malfoy accepted their menus from the bored looking waiter.
“Yeah,” he says. “I could eat.”
“Take it, Draco. Love it when you gag on my cock,” says Harry and he’s close and breathless. “Love what a cock slut you are, always so desperate to get your lips wrapped around me. Going to fill you up with my cum, spray your dirty little face.”
