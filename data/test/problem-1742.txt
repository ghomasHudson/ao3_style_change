Harry looked down at him and smirked, “I wouldn’t want anyone to be overwhelmed by my sexy body and go into labor.”
Draco gave him a soft look and leaned forward to meet Harry for a kiss. Before they could get carried away he heard someone clearing their throat outside the tent. Harry smelled his father and knew that’s who was out there.
“Sorry Mione, you know I get a little worked up seeing how beautiful you look. I want to make sure everyone knows you are mine.”
Draco and Harry headed towards the elevator. Harry put his hand on Draco’s back as they walked into the elevator. He shot Harry a look and moved away.
Harry grabbed Draco’s throat in a loose grip and ran his thumb along the side where his mark was. “Go take your bath gorgeous.”
“I don’t know how we are even going to get Draco to the Fae lands without one of us fighting to get back to the other.”
“Oh yeah. Draco loves the way I ride that tight ass of his.” Harry said as he looked Lucius in the eyes. They were only an inch or two apart in height unlike Draco who’s head barely made it to Harry’s shoulder. Lucius and Narcissa were very tall and imposing people. Harry had no clue how they had created such a delicate son.
Caleb ran off and Oliver chuckled before moving over to Draco. He braced his large, muscular arms on the counter on either side of Draco. Oliver pressed his large frame against the smaller blonde.
“Don’t you dare! Harry James Potter I swear!” Draco gasped as he felt Harry bite down with his blunt teeth and not his canines. He felt Harry’s tongue lick the spot and slick started to leak from his hole.
“I see. So Wood can give you those things Draco? Does he tenderly fuck your sweet ass at night and tell you that he’ll always take care of you? Does he whisper sweet nothings in your ear and bring you lunch?”
Draco groaned and moved his head. Harry frowned as he saw dried tears on Draco’s face. “Omega, what’s wrong?”
Narcissa planted a kiss on his head and stepped back to stand with his father. “Good luck, darling.”
*****************************************************************************************************************************
Harry smirked as he took in Draco’s flushed face and winked. Draco narrowed his eyes and began to remove his clothing. Harry watched with anticipation as Draco removed first his shirt and pants. As each new inch of creamy pale skin was revealed Harry had to work harder to control himself. Draco was perfect. The Omega was petite and slim but had strong, muscular thighs, beautiful pink nipples that Harry wanted to get his mouth on, and an adorable small cock. Draco was hairless, as are all the fey, and the tips of his cute pointed ears were red as he met Harry’s gaze.
*******************************************************************************************************************
Draco began sobbing and buried his head in his best friend’s shoulder. She rubbed his back, “there there darling. Why are you crying?”
would be opening this weekend and already they had reservations for months. The VIP area where Harry was currently. The VIP area had butter soft couches and gleaming mahogany tables. Harry had designed this whole club with Draco in mind. The club was soft and sleek like his ex- boyfriend. Cool and untouchable but wild and passionate. As always when harry thought of Draco an ache tore through his chest.
“Draco. Stop that. You are strong and brave. You and Harry have been meant to be your entire lives. Are you going to let a little thing like a few months get in the way of that?”
“Oh? So me and my baby are just supposed to be some toys you can place on the shelf and take out when you feel like it? That’s why you fucking came after me? Because you lost your toy? Well too bad! You told me to get out of your life so I did. You do not get to come back in to my life and act like I am yours to use! I am a person!”
Draco gasped as Harry stroked a finger over the stiff bud. Harry pulled back slightly to look at Draco,
Draco stared at him with his tears in his eyes. Harry watched as the blonde grew angry. “You asshole! Why would you come back into my life to do this? What the fuck is wrong with you? Just when I think things have changed you proved to me that they haven’t! Why did you even bother to look for me?!”
“It did Harry, but let’s not focus on me right now. I talked to your dad. I’m sorry, I can’t imagine being separated from my mate and unborn child.”
Harry stared into the distance. The thought of being separated from Draco for even a minute felt wrong. But his father wasn’t wrong. He hadn’t fully received all the Alpha Prime power and Harry was already on edge. He knew he would never hurt Draco but he didn’t want to scare or overwhelm the blonde.
Harry walked back to the windows. He wondered if he would survive hurting the blonde this time around. He didn’t know if he had it in him anymore to be as cruel as last time.
But he was a Potter. They didn’t do love. They did destructive things and they took what they wanted and left everyone behind. Harry was no different. Harry stared into the amber liquid in his glass. He was fooling himself if he thought he could be different.
Draco slapped at Harry playfully, “well now I don’t want to.” He stuck his tongue out.  Harry grabbed one of Draco’s hands and held it to his chest.
Draco heard Harry telepathically and smiled as he realized his mate didn’t want his friend in their heat space.
“I didn’t lie to you. When we started this I told you I don’t do relationships. You knew what you were getting into. So drop the offended virgin act Draco. We both know you wanted it.”
Harry let his thoughts drift as Neville and Ginny talked. He imagined his mate’s belly swollen with his child. His erection from early returned as he pictured taking his mate in his arms and rubbing his hand over his swollen breasts. Harry couldn’t picture his mate’s face but the smell of his jasmine/ocean scent was mouth-watering. Harry nuzzled the hair so blonde it was almost white on his mate’s head. He imagined the sound of hid mate’s breathy sigh as he kissed first his cheek and then down to his neck. “Harry” his mate moaned.
Draco moaned as Harry thrust inside his tender opening. Harry’s hands gripped his hips digging in as he moved inside Draco. Harry kept hitting that spot inside Draco until his cock was hard and leaking. He thrust his hips back at the Alpha as he felt his orgasm building again.
“Ugh!” Draco smiled as Pansy stuck her tongue out and slipped out the door. He was lucky to have people that cared about him around. Draco rubbed a tender hand over his belly, “we are going to be okay baby, I promise.”
“It’s okay Papa. Harry needs me right now and honestly I need him. Go on to the celebration dinner, we will find you all there to start planning.”
Harry stayed where he was for a few more minutes and then got up and walked to his fireplace. In there already were pictures of Draco and Harry. Mostly Draco in various stages of their time together. Harry threw the ultrasound picture on top and turned the switch to light the fireplace. He watched as what was left of his heart burned in the flames.
“Harry” he said breathily. His heat was still clinging to his body and slick was pouring from his hole. “Please Alpha.”
Anyway, I hope you enjoy the update. Harry has some things he needs to work on and will grow as a character, eventually.
Harry turned away when there was only ash left. It has to be this way, they’re better off; he thought. He hoped one day maybe Draco would understand. He regretted that he had looked for the blonde all those months ago. It should have been the clean break he originally planned and now it was so much worse. But after Draco ran out of his hotel five months ago Harry had panicked and couldn't stand the thought of not seeing the blonde again. He had only been more intense in his desire to see Draco in the months he spent trying to find him. Harry hadn't been able to keep control on the wild emotions Draco brought out in him and had said and done things he knew would give Draco the impression he could be in their lives. But he couldn't. Harry meant what he said, nothing had changed. He was as broken now as he was then. It was time for both of them to move on with their lives.
“Of course. Hello, Oliver. What brings you by?” Pansy nodded at him and left. Oliver cleared his throat and came over to bend on one knee in front of Draco.
“I need… my mama and I just can’t talk about anything else.” Harry nodded. He grabbed a shirt and shoes before moving towards the front of the tent.
“I am carrying your child Ronald, of course they know I’m yours.” Hermione looked at them and rolled her eyes, but Draco felt the glow of her happiness and had a moment of envy. He looked down at Hermione’s belly and imagined himself swollen with child, cuddled in front of a fire with his mate.
Harry had the grace to look sheepish. “I sent Mark down the street when I got here. Let me just call him back.”
Harry’s tone turned mocking and he moved closer to whisper in Draco’s ear. “We both know he can’t fuck you the way you want. He doesn’t do it for you baby and you’re lying to yourself if you think he does. I bet you’re even wet for me right now”
Hi everyone! I am so glad you are enjoying the story and thank you for all the comments and Kudos :)
Several days later Harry started to present his body shifting and changing to accommodate his new power and size. The Were healers had been shocked given Harry’s age but were helping him through it the best they could. Harry currently lay on the floor of his room as he couldn’t stand anything touching him. The window was open and a breeze brought the calming scent of jasmine and ocean in. Harry’s tired body strained towards the window.
“Harry! I’m coming.” Draco felt his eyes roll as waves of pleasure crashed over him and his cum splattered between them. His hole gushed with his slick as Harry pounded into him.
************************************************************************************************************
Draco let out a breathy sigh, “Harry” and threaded his hands through Harry’s hair. The blonde pulled Harry back to him for another kiss. Harry lavished Draco’s mouth with his tongue and finally felt the tightness in his chest ease. He had felt this weight on him ever since the night Draco left, but now the blonde was back and Harry wasn’t going to let him go again.
********************************************************************************************************************
“I don’t want you to leave me short stuff. But, I need to keep everyone safe and the only way to do that is to make sure you are somewhere protected when I accept the power transference. Our traveling party won’t even be safe to be around me because I would be on high alert the whole way to Blackwood with you there.”
“It’s okay Harry, not only is your mate nearby but your father started the transfer of the Prime to you. I’m sure you’re feeling all sorts of amped up.”
Harry never talked about it but Draco knew his mother had been sick for a while before she died. Draco felt sympathy for Harry as he realized being at the doctor probably brought all that back. Draco reached out his hand to Harry.
“Okay Harry.” Draco stood up and Harry followed him over to the large claw foot tub. It was big enough to fit several men in it. Draco waved a hand and hot water started to fill it.
“Draco, you know you can call me Hermione, I’m not your teacher anymore. I am feeling like a small house.” Draco, Pansy, and Hermione all laughed and turned as Hermione’s large mate appeared behind her.
“Gross!” Draco suddenly heard his 5-year-old say. He laughed and pulled away from his very aroused husband. Oliver stayed with his back to them while Draco ran towards his son with hands extended.
“Thank you.” Harry hung up and continued packing the bag. He called the front desk and asked for them to arrange a car to the airport, that he would be checking out.
Draco moaned against Harry’s lips. The pregnancy hormones were definitely encouraging Draco to keep kissing Harry but he knew they had things to talk about. Harry swept his tongue inside Draco’s mouth momentarily distracting him. Draco had missed Harry so much these last few months, his smell, his taste, the sound of his voice, and the feel of his hands on Draco’s body. But Draco knew nothing was going to be solved with sex.
Harry stared down at the phone. He knew he should have taken Draco’s calls and talked to the girls. But, the truth was Harry had been afraid if he talked to them he would get on a plane and go home. Draco and Harry had moved to America right after the girls were born so Harry could start his production company. Draco had dreams of going to Harvard Law and was accepted last year. Harry always felt like Draco’s dreams were bigger than Harry and the girls. Like maybe they weren’t enough?
Harry leaned forward and nipped the tip of the blonde’s nose. “Call me Alpha again my little Omega and we aren’t getting out of this bed.”
“Bye Papa!” Oliver planted a kiss on Caleb’s head and shut the door. Draco closed the trunk door before coming around to get in the driver’s side. Oliver pulled Draco into a hug.
Draco didn’t know what to say. The look on Harry’s face was unguarded and he looked lost. The elevator dinged before he could form words and they stepped out onto the 5
Harry’s eyes flashed and he moved away from Draco. “I’m not the marrying type Draco. You knew that when we started this.”
Harry wanted to put his mouth everywhere and see how far the blush reached. Harry’s cock throbbed in his pants as he thought about how soft the Omega’s skin looked and how badly he wanted to mark it up so other Alphas knew to stay away.
He heard their little feet tromp down the stairs as they headed towards the kitchen. Draco sighed again and grabbed his phone off the sink. He opened up his contacts and selected Harry’s number.
Draco stared out the window of his carriage in anticipation. This was finally it! Ever since Draco was a young child he had dreamed of the Aphro festival and finding his mate. When he had presented as an Omega at age 14, the dreams of his mate had started. Of course in his dreams he never saw the face of his mate; only the smell of his mate remained in the morning when Draco awoke. Draco knew he would recognize the smell anywhere; it smelled of rain and fire. Draco was a strong Fae and therefore had a deep connection to the earth and he suspected his mate was a were-creature. Draco had recently had a dream where his mate was naked fighting another large man, the brutality of it was exhilarating and frightening. He had not met many were creatures but they had all been omegas or betas. Draco had heard rumors of the current Alpha Prime’s son being the most dominant Alpha to be born in over 200years. Draco shivered at the thought of that.
Harry adjusted them so that they were on their sides facing each other. He moved a long piece of Draco’s hair aside as they stared into each other’s eyes.
“You look like you’re waiting for something.” Neville said looking up at Harry with his beautiful brown eyes. Harry had wished for a brief time that Neville was his mate. He was a beautiful man with soft brown hair, big brown eyes, and an incredibly fit body. Harry remembered when his friend presented as Beta and all the roundness of his face had been gone. Unfortunately, Neville preferred women and Harry, after he presented, was left aching with desire from dreams of an unknown blonde man.
“We should probably get going, we want to get a good spot at one of the tables” Neville said. Harry nodded and the three of them fell in to step as they headed towards the outdoor dining area where the first dinner was being held.
Harry and Draco followed Cho as the went to the exam room. After weighing Draco, taking his blood pressure, and asking all the routine questions Cho said the doctor would be in to do the ultrasound.
“Harry!” Harry snapped out of his thoughts and looked down at Ginny. She was smirking. “Thinking of something in particular?” She smirked and gestured to his erection. “You might not want to walk over to a bunch of Omegas with that thing pointing at them.” She said cheekily.
Harry wiped Draco’s cum off his hand and then wiped the blonde’s rounded belly. After he finished he stared at Draco as the blonde sat with his eyes closed, relaxed. Draco really was beautiful. His white-blonde hair was only slightly mused and his long blonde eyelashes lay on his cheeks. Their son would be beautiful, Harry thought.
Draco moaned as Harry inserted another finger. He moved them in and out mimicking what Harry ached to do with his cock. Draco writhed on the ground as Harry scissored his two fingers to stretch Draco’s tight hole. Finally, Harry couldn’t wait anymore and withdrew his fingers to replace them with his mouth. He moaned as the first taste of Draco’s slick hit his tongue.
Draco’s heart started racing. That sounded like Harry! He struggled to get his 7month pregnant body off the couch. The banging continued.
“You don’t have to take a tone dear. I am not going to lecture you. You’re an adult and Harry is your husband.”
The blonde opened his eyes and smiled sleepily. “Baby and I need a nap now.” Draco smiled down at his belly as he rubbed his hand over it.
Harry felt rage boil up in him. Draco was pregnant with his child and he hadn’t even thought to reach out to him? Instead he was letting some other man hold him, touch his stomach, and pretend that wasn’t Harry’s baby in there.
Draco looked up at Harry and they nodded. They both looked at the screen as Dr. Granger said “and….we have a baby boy.”
“Yes.” Harry and Ginny strode off in search of Lucius and Narcissa. Harry looked back at the tent one more time before gritting his teeth and focusing on finding his mate’s family.
Harry pulled Draco close again and leaned down to kiss him. “But I am your pervert” he said as he brought his lips down on Draco’s.
Harry picked Draco up and set him down off of his lap. Harry stood and climbed out of the tub. He paced back and forth while Draco watched him with concern.
“She’s pretty stubborn when she sets her mind to it and my brother is a sucker. Plus, you know how many babies my mom had, she could probably deliver this kid herself.” They all chuckled at the thought.
“Damn it.” He said in a low voice. Of course Pansy would use this one opportunity to twist the wrench.
Harry turned and dropped to his knees as the girls threw themselves into his arms. Narcissa followed at a sedate pace behind.
“It’s not you that wouldn’t be safe. I would be a danger to anyone that got close to you or even looked at you in a way that could set me off. I was outside for five minutes while you were in here bathing and I had the whole festival basically on its knees! You’re only a week pregnant at most Draco and I’m already out of control.”
“I don’t want a co-parent Pans. I want a husband, a partner, a friend. Harry can’t be those things so I will find them elsewhere.”
“She’ll be going with us. I’m not going to leave my best friend alone while he is separated from his mate and the father of his child.”
Harry stared out at the dance floor of his newest acquisition. He had decided to branch out and expand his business. The club was beautiful and Harry had designed every sleek line himself.
Harry nodded and looked away so Draco wouldn’t see the tears in his eyes. He saw out of the corner of his eye as Draco scooped up the divorce paper’s and made his way to the door.
“I can’t wait to start working on making a baby.” He said in a husky voice. Draco closed his eyes and leaned into his husband’s large frame. Oliver kissed Draco passionately before moving his lips down the blonde’s neck. Draco moaned and wrapped his arms around Ollie’s neck.
Harry closed his eyes for a moment and then sighed. He couldn’t avoid it any longer. Harry steeled himself and looked down, into Draco’s eyes. Except they were on a copy of Harry’s own face. Caleb was as beautiful in person as all the pictures Mark had taken. Draco thought he had just let him and their son go, but he could never fully let them go.
“Can you play with me Mr. Harry?” Caleb looked up at him with wide trusting eyes. They were such a unique color, gray but silver in certain lights. Harry wanted to scream because all he saw when he closed his eyes were those eyes. But they were attached to a certain blonde his body and soul still ached for.
“Ugh, spare me oh great Alpha-Prime!” Ginny being a vampire had some resistance to Harry’s dominance and they had been friends since they had met in training as young Alphas.
“Are you ready?” Neville asked them from the entryway. Smiling, Harry nodded and they strode to the dining area.
“Mr. Potter.” He turned as his club manager Ron Weasley approached him. Ron’s red hair gleamed in the lights as he came into sight. Ron was one of the few people in this world Harry trusted and would consider a friend. Ron had been with Harry during the whole club design process and was the perfect choice to run it.
Harry walked through the tent and opened the covering. His father was standing there and smiled when he saw Harry. His father was a tall man, not as tall as Harry but close, with black hair, tanned skin, and hazel eyes that were glinting in the sunlight. Harry mostly took after his father in appearance except for the green of his eyes which came from his mother.
“You think so?! I have never slept with any other man but you Harry James Potter. So you can just go and fuck yourself for thinking otherwise.”
Draco visibly paled and it took everything Harry had not to fall at Draco’s feet and take it all back. Beg the blonde to forgive him, but he couldn’t.
“Ginny, Neville, I hope you had a nice week at the festival.” Draco knew Neville hadn’t found his mate but the Beta seemed to be doing okay at the moment.
Harry looked back at the tent. His father had picked up what Harry had noticed this morning. Draco’s scent had changed. Harry took a deep breath and could smell his mate’s jasmine and ocean scent but underneath it was Harry’s own scent mixed in- it was earthy and distinctly wolf. Draco was pregnant.
“Draco, what happens now?” Harry stared down at his husband. He felt like his heart was cracking in half.
His best friend nodded and walked past Harry. “Potter” she said in a sassy tone. Harry arched an eyebrow. “Parkinson.”
“Now begins the Chase!” Harry looked at Minerva as she yelled and looked back to see Draco running towards the forest. The omega looked back and shot Harry a saucy grin.
Harry looked at the ceiling as if he could see through the walls to Draco’s bedroom. He had messed up. He had messed up so badly.
Draco looked up at him from his bath and gave him a sweet smile. “Come here Alpha.” Harry went willingly as Draco looked beautiful and serene sitting in the bath. His pale features were practically glowing with health. Harry approached the edge of the tub and stepped in. He kneeled before his beautiful mate.
Draco’s silver eyes looked between Harry and his father before he finally nodded and went through the door.
Draco was drawn from his thoughts by the door opening and the face of his best friend Pansy appearing. Pansy was a siren and it was very apparent in her current outfit. Pansy’s curvy body was clad in a skintight red dress to match her bright red lips. Pansy smiled at Draco and tossed her long dark hair over her shoulder.
“Darling, it’s not that I don’t love having you stay here with me and I am very excited to be an auntie but don’t you think Potter deserves the right to know?”
Harry could not believe what he was reading. He had only been gone 6 months and Draco got knocked up by someone else? All Harry could see was red. He was so angry he didn’t know what to do. He raced around his hotel room repacking his bag and he called his assistant Ron.
“I know you’re scared Dray but if anyone can do this it’s you. We are all gonna be here for you and give you and the baby as much love and connection as we can.”
Draco opened his eyes and stared at Harry. He seemed to reach some sort of decision before nodding and tipping his head back to reveal his neck as a sign of submission.
Draco stared at him incredulously and then gave a dry, pained laugh. “Right. Well, I’m glad we sorted that out. Thank you Potter for helping me make my decision. You haven’t changed at all. You’re still the selfish bastard you’ve always been and I don’t want you around me or my child.”
“Draco Malfoy, do not ignore me. I will not have my best friend in the whole world looking like some pooh-bear wannabe with a crop top barely covering what I am sorry to say darling is a very large belly.”
Draco’s silver eyes were wide and his skin felt warm to the touch. “I ‘m okay Harry. I’m honestly glad it’s you. This is definitely a lot, but I want this. I want you.”
Draco nodded and slipped off the bed. Harry watched as Draco waved and a shimmery wall of water obscured the bathing area from any eyes. Harry appreciated his Omega’s modesty and found his pants on the floor. He knew his father wanted to talk about Blackwood and Harry taking over as Alpha Prime now that he was mated. He sighed, his father at least stayed away for a week, he thought.
“No.” Draco said rapping his arms around Harry’s neck while angling his body even closer. Harry’s cock throbbed with his little Omega’s defiance and he ached to get inside him.
Pansy looked at him and essentially said without words he better play with his son or she would never sign off on his permit.
“She must be something to have your cheeks so red Sweets.” His mother said with a teasing tone. She noticed the blush as well.
His parents waved as Draco and Pansy headed for the entrance. Pansy’s parents went to stand next to his own. Families stayed in a separate section and participants could rejoin them after the first night or when the festival was over. Some people chose to participate in the first chase but not the rest. Draco didn’t understand why but some creatures chose to take their time to find a mate. Draco took a deep breath and reached out to clasp hands with Pansy. “Here we go.”
Draco had been in the throes of heat the last time he did this so he had a moment of insecurity that he wasn’t doing it right.
With that Oliver stood up, bent down to kiss Draco lightly on the forehead and turned to go. When he reached the doorway he turned back and said, “Don’t take too long okay? I love you.”
Draco placed a hand on Harry’s chest and pushed him back. “Don’t even think about it Potter, I need a bath.”
Pansy’s smile turned wicked “Imagining that big Alpha mate of yours swooping you into his arms and carrying you away to ravish you?”
“Where to sir?” Mark’s question snapped Harry back to reality. They might be having a child but things were far from right between him and Draco.
“Harry, the only man I will be moving in with is my husband or my future husband. You may be the father of my baby but that doesn’t give you the right to control my life. You hurt me Harry, and acted like an ass. I haven’t forgiven that.”
“We’ve been trying Harry and nothing has changed! You aren’t happy! I don’t…want you to be unhappy.” Draco brushed at the tears streaming down his face.
The door to the bathroom opened and Draco appeared. “Dad? Mum?” He looked between all of them in confusion. His mother swept forward.
Harry paused for a moment and then booked the ticket. He hit print and then grabbed the paper as he ran out of the room. He grabbed all his necessary travel documents and packed a bag with everything he felt like he would need. He wrote a quick note to the housekeeper that he was leaving for an undetermined amount of time and to contact him by email if needed.
Harry smirked as the blonde moaned in his arms. He had Draco pressed against the wall outside the bathroom. He had followed the blonde with the intent of a quickie to liven up this ridiculous charity event.
Everyone nodded and started to disperse. Pansy came up to him and hugged him. She whispered in his ear “already acting like Omega Prime,” before winking and walking away.
She looked at Harry and rolled her eyes. “I don’t know why we have to do all this nonsense. Just show me where all the cute Omegas are and I’ll make it happen.”
Draco was drawn back to the present as Oliver came downstairs carrying Caleb and the rescued unicorn. Sometimes it was devastating to look at his son. Caleb looked so much like Potter it was torturous. Caleb had the same black hair, with a slight curl to it, olive skin, and a lopsided smile. The only thing Caleb carried from Draco were his gray eyes.
Draco knew that Pansy had been kissed before and she told him of a few encounters with a Beta boy named Blaise in their village. Draco had never been kissed or even touched by another boy. He and Pansy had practiced kissing once but it had been a rather wet and awkward experience for the both of them. In some of Draco’s dreams about his mate the Alpha took him into his arms and would bring his lips close to Draco’s before the dream would end and he would wake up with his cock hard and slick flowing from his hole. Draco had a feeling Pansy was right.
Harry watched as she bent over to whisper in the ear of none other than Draco Malfoy. Harry watched as Draco reacted to the news and his silver eyes shot to Harry’s.
Draco watched in awe as Neville dropped to his knees with a hand over his heart. “I swear on my life you and your child will be safe.” Draco wasn’t really sure what the right thing to do was but he placed a hand on Neville’s shoulder.
Draco watched from the carriage window as his father talked with the Alpha Prime. He didn’t see Harry anywhere and desperately wanted to talk to his friend.
“Yes, mother.” He loved his mother and appreciated her support, but Draco knew she was disappointed in him for not telling Harry.
Harry grabbed him by the arm and pulled him close. “Too bad. That is my child too Draco and you’ve already kept it a secret from me for months. I am going to this appointment.”
Draco felt a flash of heat at the touch of Harry’s lips on his neck. He knew he should push the brunette away but it felt so good. Their interlude was interrupted as the car came to a stop. Draco looked up at Harry.
“You want me baby?” Harry planted kisses on Draco’s cheek as he moved his mouth towards the blonde’s neck.
“Fucking super sperm that bastard.” Draco sighed and raked his hands through his hair. He heard giggling outside the door.
Draco nodded and looked off towards the family tents, he hoped it would be enough. He brushed a hand over his stomach. Fae had longer pregnancies they were generally 11 to 12 months and required different things at different stages of the pregnancy. For the first few months Draco would need to be around the water and surrounded by familiar connections. In Omega pregnancies Fae generally can feel needier or strive for the attention of their Alpha. He also knew that their sex drive could increase exponentially. Towards the end of the pregnancy Draco would have to spend most of his time resting as his body shifted and prepared to give birth. He also would not be able to use magic the last month. There were so any things to consider in the time to come. Before he could get too lost in his thoughts he smelled his mother’s scent. She always smelled of vanilla and books, comforting.
Draco felt his heart shatter in that moment. He choked back tear and covered his mouth. Draco ran for the exit and ignored paparazzi who had been watching the whole scene. Draco didn’t look back as he ran down the street. He never wanted to see Harry Potter or his stupid hotel ever again.
James smiled at him. “I am proud of you son and I can tell it’s a strong bond. He will be a good mate and there’s no worry already about an heir.”
“Sweetheart.” He heard his mother say to his left. Draco turned and ran into his mother’s arms. Mama wrapped her arms around him and held him as he began to cry.
“We discussed a lot of things. But you know what I remember? How you moaned my name while I bent you over this table a month ago on our anniversary.” Harry stood up and moved into Draco’s space. He watched as Draco swallowed and avoided his gaze.
Harry regarded the other Alpha, she looked even more ethereal than usual. “How can I help you Minerva?”
Draco pulled up in front of Pansy’s house. He felt…. Strange after the doctor’s appointment. The device was removed and his doctor had told Draco he could start trying right away for a baby. But, after hearing that all Draco felt was dread.
Draco’s silver eyes gleamed and his mouth turned down into what Harry thought was a very cute pout. “I don’t like to see you in pain my Alpha.”
“Please don’t cry.” Harry rushed over and gathered the small Omega in his arms. “Dray, this is the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do but… I have to think like a leader. If we were to travel together it would take us twice the time to get to Blackwood and my father is struggling as it is. Then when I accept all that power, I would kill anyone around you. I just can’t trust myself. I know it hurts and I know it’s a terrible thing to ask but it’s the only way.”
He grabbed Draco by the neck and pulled him close while putting his other hand on the Omega’s supple bottom. Draco squeaked as Harry squeezed one firm cheek. Harry brought his mouth down to hover just over Draco’s lips. Draco looked up at him with silver eyes heated by desire.
“Believe me, I want that too. But it’s your first time short stuff. I have to get you nice and ready.”
Harry was in a daze as Dr. Granger and Draco finished up the appointment. Luckily, Draco was still letting him hold his hand or he didn’t know how he would have made it out of there.
“I just want you to face the facts dear. As angry at Harry as you may be you are having his son. He deserves to know.”
“Time’s up baby.” Harry said before sweeping from the room. The picture of Draco was clenched in his fist. “Time’s up.”
Harry reached out and lightly grabbed Draco’s wrist to pull him closer. He kissed Draco’s neck and murmured “you smell so good.”
Draco drew back stunned. He stared up at the green eyes he loved so much and felt like he was looking at a stranger.
Harry laughed and stroked a hand up Draco’s leg. “Oh short stuff, I think you are angling for a punishment.”
“We will get through this Alpha. I promise.” Draco looked down at his flat stomach tenderly “and you too baby.” With that Draco set off to find his mate.
“Always so demanding my bossy Omega. But I aim to please.” Harry pushed his tongue beyond the tight rim and Draco ground down against Harry’s mouth. Harry lapped at his hole a few more times before moving back up his Omega’s body. He kissed Draco deeply.
Harry helped Draco into the car and then went around to his side. He slid in the seat next to Draco and just stared at the blonde.
Harry continued to stroke Draco’s cock and moved his other hand under Draco’s shirt to one of his hard nipples.
“But, have you asked Harry about what happened that night? Why he was looking for you if he told you to get out of his life?”
Sighing he finished off his drink. It has to be this way. You’ll only destroy him and the now there is a child, Harry mused.
Harry just kept looking at Draco’s belly with a look of awe. He was lightly rubbing Draco’s stomach which he didn’t seem to notice.
Harry reached his arms out and wrapped them around Draco’s waist. He pulled the blonde in close. He reached one hand up to stroke Draco’s face, memorizing the feel of his soft skin. Harry leaned in close and rubbed his nose along Draco’s cheek. Draco closed his eyes and Harry pressed his lips to Draco’s. They both moaned at the contact and Draco opened his mouth wider for Harry to thrust his tongue inside. Harry cupped Draco’s face as he plundered the blonde’s mouth.
Harry stared down at the small blonde. “I only have so much patience Draco. Do you think I am just going to passively wait around while Wood tries to get in your pants? He is nothing baby, and we both know he will never please you the way I can.”
“I looked for you Draco. After that night…. I went to your apartment, I went to your parents’ house, and I hired a private detective. How could you hide this from me?”
“I see your festival week went well.” Harry said with a sad smile to Ginny. He was happy for his friend but things were chaotic right now.
Oliver cleared his throat. “Listen, I’m sure you guys have a lot to discuss but we have to go if we are going to get to your appointment on time Draco.”
Her words swelled over the crowd but Harry could only see Draco. As Minerva’s chants came to a close the music started. It was a sensual beat that mimicked the rhythm of mating. Their bodies began to move instinctually. Harry began to circle Draco, their bodies just barely touching as they moved to the beat.
They got to the registration table and Draco smiled at the curly-haired Nymph Hermione. She was two years older than Draco but one of the instructors at his Omega school. She was a sweet Beta and always answered Draco’s questions without judgement.
“Okay. I’ll sign.” Harry’s heart started pounding as he picked up the pen. His body was literally rebelling as he brought the pen to paper. He looked over into Draco’s tear filled gray eyes. He loved the blonde more than anything. This is what Draco wanted, so this is what Harry would do. Harry signed his name and put the pen down.
“Hello my beautiful children, welcome to the first dinner.” Draco looked up as Minerva’s voice rang out. Minerva was dressed in the ceremonial garb with a long purple robe and her silver hair unbound.
Oliver came from the kitchen and gave Draco a wry look before helping him gather up the bags. They all walked out to the car and Oliver helped Caleb get situated in his car seat while Draco put the bags in the back.
Harry and Draco had been struggling for the past year of their marriage and Harry didn’t know why. They couldn’t seem to agree on anything and spent more time elsewhere than with each other. He had done his best to assure Draco it wasn’t because he resented their life, but Draco was convinced that was the cause of Harry’s unhappiness. Harry just felt desperately disconnected from his husband. The only time they had gotten along in the last year was when they were having sex. Which, was not an area they ever had issues in.
Draco took a deep swallow of wine and stared down at the food which had been placed in front of him. Everything looked delicious but his stomach was in knots. Was Harry his mate?
“And what is that one thing Lucius hmmmm….?” Harry tapped his finger to his chin like he was really thinking on it.
“Does it feel good?” Draco nodded again. Harry moved to replace his hand with his mouth on Draco’s tight nipple.
When two creatures mate their child would only be born with the characteristics of one species or sometimes a strong hybrid of the two. Voldemort himself was the product of one such union; his mother was a shape shifter and his father was a vampire. Lore has it that Voldemort hated himself so much he vowed no creatures would mix bloodlines again. However, several prominent creature families (including his own) banded together and defeated him. A Potter was an Alpha Prime back then as well, a king in his own right of all the were-creatures. Draco wondered what Harry, the Alpha Prime-inherit looked like now. They had met as young children and Draco had been quite taken with the vivacious boy. Harry was several months older than Draco and almost double his size, even at age 8. He remembered Harry’s dark hair being a little shaggy because his mother Lily couldn’t get him to sit still. Draco smiled sadly, Lily had been killed during an attack from a rival Were family that sought to defeat the Alpha-Prime. Harry had survived and had been marked with a scar on his forehead where Lily placed a strong protection charm to save her child. Lily had been a witch and the coven had mourned her death dearly.
Harry found an envelope, a stamp, and addressed the envelope. He dropped the letter in the mailbox as he headed out to the airport. Harry was on a mission to find himself and he hoped he would be the man Draco and their daughter’s needed him to be when he came back.
Harry opened his mouth to say something and Draco interrupted him by pointing towards the living room. “Go.”
Harry moved closer to the small boy. Draco closed his eyes and puckered his lips like he had seen older girls in his village do. Harry leaned down and grabbed both Draco’s soft cheeks still round with baby fat in his hands.
Draco sat stunned as he listened to Oliver leave. Marriage… a husband. That’s all Draco had wanted for a long time. He didn’t know what to think as he stared down at the ring. He barely noticed as Pansy came back in the room and sat next to him. She gently closed the ring box and took it off his lap.
“Am I not a big strong Alpha? I can carry you there!” Draco squealed as Harry lifted him higher and tossed him over his shoulder.
“I think you know, you’re an animal.” Draco said cheekily. Harry stopped and pulled Draco into his arms. His large hands slid down to cup Draco’s bottom.
“My mate Nev. I know he’s here. I can feel it.” Almost on cue Harry caught a scent on the breeze of jasmine and the salt of the ocean. His cocked hardened and began to throb. He closed his eyes and tried to locate the direction of the scent.
“Harry, I feel…. Something is happening. Oh!” Harry felt Draco’s inner muscles begin to tighten has he climaxed. Harry moved his hips faster and with one final thrust he came. Harry roared his pleasure.
Draco glared at his mother. She looked beautiful as always sitting on the bed. Her long graying, black hair was in her signature bun and he could smell her Chanel perfume. He met her blue eyes and sighed.
Harry watched as the blonde tensed and then climaxed. Harry continued to stroke Draco’s cock until the blonde slumped back into the seat.
“Yup, the whole gang. Ron and his mate Hermione are here too, even though she’s pretty close to delivering.”
Draco felt his vision go fuzzy at the edges and then all of a sudden his knees gave out. The last thing he saw before his vision blacked out was Potter’s concerned face and arms reaching for him.
Draco rolled his eyes and they waited in silence until Harry’s driver pulled up in the black Rolls Royce. Mark opened the door for Draco.
Oliver made his shocking declaration, kissed Draco on the cheek, and walked away to his car. Draco watched as he got in and drove away.
“Draco!” Hermione smiled and stood up from the table. Draco leaned over to hug her, leaving enough room for her large belly.
“No, No, no, no. How could this happen again?!” Draco stared down at the object in his hand with wide eyes.
Harry made a frustrated noise “What do you want then Draco? Because I am having a pretty hard time figuring it out. First you hide that you’re pregnant from me and then I find out Oliver Wood has been taking you out?”
“I’m not trying to keep you from our baby Harry. But, I am not looking to be just another one of your toys. It’s time to grow up.”
“Harry!” He heard Neville say sharply. “Take some deep breaths man, you’re going all Prime on everyone.” Harry finally became aware of several Alphas in the vicinity bowing their heads in submission.
Harry grabbed a washcloth off the rack near the tub. “Let me take care of you. Just lie back and relax.”
“Thank you, we appreciate your devotion and I am thankful for the protection.” Neville’s brown eyes softened and he nodded before standing.
"Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn't realize that love as powerful as your mother's for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign... to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good."
A loud snap caused them both to still and Ben snapped his head in the direction, “Wait for me.” He said and before she could ask what he meant, he was gone.
“I… um…” Draco was distracted as Harry’s hand moved up his leg again. His finger traced the seam of his bottom. Harry traced one finger around his rim before pushing in. Draco was still a little sore from earlier but he moaned as Harry’s finger brushed his prostate.
“I don’t know that we can make each other happy anymore. All we can seem to do right is have sex and make babies.”
“Oh my god.” Draco pushed closer to Harry desperate for the contact. He tried to pull Harry’s head down to meet his for a kiss.
“I wasn’t being a baby you big dumb head!” Draco stuck his tongue out even though he knew Harry couldn’t see it.
Draco reached a hand to his cheek and turned startled eyes to Harry’s. “I think it was the dream. I felt your pain and it made me sad. I can’t believe we were so close. All I remember is this intense desire to get to you and help you.”
Draco threw his pillow at the brunette while she jokingly poked at his pregnant belly. “The doctor said it’s a perfectly normal sized belly and baby in there, thank you very much.”
Draco waved down a cab and got in. “Take me to 118 Lovett Drive, please.” The cab driver looked back at Draco’s tear stained face. “You okay kid?”
Lucius bristled and clenched his fists like he was going to swing. Harry braced himself but looked over Lucius’s shoulder as he heard heels clicking on the floor.
“Oh my darling. We can’t. Harry just lost his mother and was injured he is not in enough control of his new were-powers. He has already presented as an Alpha…. It’s rare for someone that young and I imagine it would be too overwhelming.”
Harry knew mates could communicate telepathically but he didn’t expect Draco’s mind to feel so comforting as he felt it within his own. As their bodies and minds merged Harry’s vision went red as both his and Draco’s lust combined.
“Draco, look at me.” Harry put his hand under the Omega’s chin. “Are you okay? I know this is a lot.”
Harry watched as Draco scrambled out of the tub and waved an agitated hand to dry the water. He met Draco’s stricken gaze with his own hurt one.
Caleb took Draco’s face in his little hands and gave Draco a kiss on the cheek. Draco laughed and hugged his son before putting him down.
Harry stared at the house in front of him. It was a large townhouse in a classy neighborhood:  the house was white with black trimmings and a gate to the side which led to the background and what looked like a garden. Harry could see flowers popping up and figured Draco had a hand in that. The blonde had always loved gardening even when they were teenagers. Harry knew who Pansy Parkinson was and who most of Draco’s acquaintances were. They had all gone to the prestigious Hogwarts academy as children. However, most of their families were from old money, unlike Harry whose parents had made their fortune shortly before Harry was born. Harry owned over 200 hotels internationally now and dabbled in some other ventures as well.
“Daddy!” They yelled in unison. Draco smiled at them, he loved his girls with all his heart. They were identical beauties with their honey blonde hair that fell in curls down their back, green eyes, and golden skin. He and Harry made beautiful babies that was for sure. Draco put a hand over his belly. We love you already little one.
He stared as Draco reached out for the clay. Draco looked up at Harry as he began drawing the Omega symbol on his chest. Harry fought the urge to grab the Omega as his cool hands drifted over Harry’s hard abdomen. His small hands stopped just above Harry’s hard cock. Finished with their markings they stared at each other, unaware they had drifted closer. Draco’s silver eyes were heated as he stared at Harry. Harry groaned as Draco’s small tongue peaked out to wet his lips. Just as Harry was about to swoop down and taste Draco’s glistening pink mouth, Minerva cleared her throat.
“Marry me. Be my husband, let’s raise this baby together and have 5 more. I love you Draco Malfoy and I don’t want to spend another minute without you.”
Draco nodded and caressed the back of his Alpha’s neck. “We can definitely head to our tent. However, that requires you to put me down.” He said teasingly.
“Mate…. I am going to take you right here in the open if we don’t stop.” Draco looked into Harry’s eyes and they were completely black. He could feel through the bond how close Harry’s control was to snapping and how strong his desire was.
Just then the bathroom door opened and a young woman stepped out. She sensed the tension between the three of them and walked away quickly.
Draco bit his lip and briefly popped his head up to see if the man was still there. Draco had recognized him from his dreams. The man’s size and hair had been an exact match. Draco hadn’t been focused enough to smell him but he knew it would be the earthy scent from his dreams. The man wasn’t there and Draco felt a stab of disappointment. He scanned the area looking for him when he heard someone clear their throat.
Afterward he collapsed on top of the small blonde. “Oof.” Draco squeaked as he took all of Harry’s weight.
“Draco, I want you to know that as future Omega Prime I will protect you and your child with my life. Harry has asked me to accompany to the Fae lands and protect you in his stead.”
Pansy looked at him and seemed to be thinking, “Darling, I know you would love to stay holed up at home with your books and your healing but this could be a good thing. Plus, you are equally special and strong in your own right. You are capable of great things my love.”
The week passed in a haze for Draco. Harry was the perfect Alpha the whole time. He was always there whenever Draco needed something to eat, a bath, his cock- his Alpha was there and ready.
“Alright, gentleman everything is looking good so far. Everything looks right on track for development. Are you two ready to know the sex?”
“Fight me baby. We both know you like it.” Draco couldn’t respond because Harry’s mouth crashed onto his.
Alpha pheromones were potent enough as it was and as an Omega he was overwhelmingly sensitive, more so than most. His mother said it was because of his Fae abilities which were based in the element water. Because of this Draco was more Intune with the emotions and energies of those around him. Draco had only ever been exposed to a few dominants- mostly his parents and other family. Omegas were placed with other omegas in school and training after their presentation. The separation was to protect the young omegas from becoming overwhelmed and so Alphas could learn without distraction. Betas were free to learn and train in whatever they want. Draco had chosen to train as a healer given his elemental gift. Water was naturally healing and aided him in his work.
The next day Harry stood in front of Pansy’s townhouse. He couldn’t shake the sense of foreboding he felt.
“I’m sorry…. If this is too much. I know I’ve always put a lot of pressure on you. But, I’m so proud of you and I just have always wanted the best for you.”
“My sweet child” his mother cooed and brought him in for a hug. Draco was comforted by her familiar Alpha pheromones. His father was an Alpha as well, and while they were able to have him, he was his parents only child given the rarity of an Alpha/Alpha union. Some were surprised when Draco presented as an Omega given his parentage but his parents didn’t care one bit and were insanely proud of their Omega son.
Harry pulled back and whispered against Draco’s lips “such a naughty boy for Daddy, not wearing any underwear.”  Draco thrust his hips towards Harry’s hand. Harry chuckled and pressed his lips to Draco’s for another kiss.
“I’m sorry short stuff.” He said with a chuckle and rolled onto his back. Harry pulled Draco half on top of him and cupped his bottom. He kissed the top of Draco’s head and closed his eyes in contentment. His mate. He finally found his mate and it was short stuff. Draco had been there all along.
“Can you take my knot again little Omega?” Harry’s eyes were completely black, his fangs were out, and the hands that gripped his hips were clawed.
Draco and Oliver had been taking things slow but it was nice. Draco felt comfortable and safe with Oliver. He had even come over last weekend to help Draco set up the nursery for the baby and was going with him to an appointment later today. Draco hadn’t been ready to find out the gender until now. He still ached whenever he thought of Harry. Draco was determined that he would move on and be positive, for his baby’s sake.
“Hello love” he said as he kissed her cheek and tenderly rubbed her belly. The man looked up and smiled at Draco revealing two fangs. The vampire was very handsome with his red hair styled short on the sides long on the top, his blue eyes sparkled, and the sleeves of his shirt were rolled up to reveal muscular forearms. Draco blushed and looked down.
Harry dipped his head and tenderly kissed the blonde. Draco placed his hands on Harry’s chest and pushed back after a minute.
“That’s cute Draco, really. Who knew you were such a romantic? Listen, I always thought you were a hot piece of ass when we were in school and then when we saw each other over the summer at Blaise and Neville’s wedding it seemed like the perfect opportunity to get what we both wanted. You knew the deal.”
“Come along Darlings. It’s getting late.” Narcissa ushered Draco away with Lucius trailing behind. Lucius shot Harry one more glare before following.
Harry knew it aroused the blonde when he talked dirty. They had always had an intense sexual connection. Harry was Draco’s first and he intended to be the blonde’s last.
Harry ignored the hot lance of pain he felt at the thought of Draco marrying Oliver, of never seeing his son, and Draco growing old with someone else. He wanted Draco to be happy. Harry knew he would never be the one to make Draco happy. After all, Potter's only know how to cause pain. Harry was living proof of that. He would keep his distance from now on. It was the only way Draco could be happy.
James nodded and patted him on the back. “I’m sorry son. I know this is a lot of responsibility being placed on you. But we both know you are too dominant for me to remain Alpha Prime and being newly mated? Son, you’re throwing off more pheromones than I can even explain.”
Harry watched as Draco straightened his shoulders. “Harry, you came back into my life. You claim you want me and the baby but I don’t understand. Why did you say those things all those months ago? What is different now?”
She earned a good fare for each odd job, and planned to save it all up for college, like Diana was doing. She was just very good at fixing most things—solving too. She was good at math, too—she could always solve those tricky math problems when she broke them down into steps. Sciences was also a very good subject, for the teacher favored her. She was tutored during lunches for free, just for the sake of it. She was generally good at school—her severe interest in anything but home life probably factored in greatly.
While they waited, Persephone had some fun with her appearance. She dressed in all black and straightened her hair perfectly with her brush and then putting it in a sleeked back pony tail of perfectly straight hair and then, just to be extra, she made her hair completely black. She had to admit—she looked good with dark hair. She stared at her mirror for a moment, and her skin became less rosy, less freckly and more of an olive tone. She turned in the mirror, smiling at her reflection—she had more of her father’s complexion and hair! Hmm…
“Dobby! What are you doing!?” She hissed as quietly as possibly. She pulled him away from the bench, staring down at him in shock.
“Sure, yeah,” She nodded and it was silent and she looked awkward around, still nodding her head before he said,
She returned anyway on the third night, and her mother and father smiled at her all the same, and one of her grandfather’s nodded happily. She sunk to the floor, curling up, her knees up to her chin. She wasn’t even tired anymore—she could stay here all night, with her parents.
Behind the bar was a wooden staircase, where she would have to assume lead up to the actual inn part. Somewhere upstairs, she heard a dim fire going. Whoever the owner was, he obviously was not fond of large amounts of people and obviously kept it this way for that reason.
She snapped her head to Ron’s little brother, waiting with bated breath. The other Weasleys were at the edges of their seats. After about thirty seconds, the Sorting Hat bellowed, “GRYFFINDOR!”
“It’s all right, he’s still alive,” Hermione said, prodding Errol gently with the tip of her finger.
"All right there, Lily?" Fred yelled as he chased and beat the Bludger furiously toward Marcus Flint.
“That’s not true, George,” She rolled her eyes. “Men can like other men’s work too. And besides, he doesn’t seem like just a pretty face with all that he’s done. Banshees, ghouls, hags, trolls, vampires, werewolves and yetis, by the looks of it. Can you handle all that?”
“Hello Ron, these are my former students Draco and Pansy and you can stop putting on the charm!” Hermione playfully smacked his arm.
Harry growled and returned his mouth to Draco’s. They were both naked from the earlier ceremony (praise Minerva) and Harry couldn’t wait to feel his Omega’s tight heat. Harry sank to his knees still holding Draco. Harry watched in amazement as a soft bed of grass and flowers sprung up underneath them. Draco’s Fae connection to the earth was even stronger now given their bond and he must have done it without realizing.
“I know very well what you were doing son. I am wondering why you are allowing Harry Potter to grope you outside of the restroom in the middle of a charity function for children.”
“What’s wrong Harry? I just felt you get nervous all of a sudden. Are you scared about the baby?” Draco looked at him with concern.
“I just want to talk to my parents and then I don’t know. How am I going to do this Pans? Months? Without Harry? What about our baby?”
“Sleep short stuff.” Draco huffed at being told what to do but drifted off in the embrace of his Alpha.
Harry finished rinsing Draco’s hair and gave himself a quick scrub and washed his hair while Draco lounged in the water. Finally, Harry stood and picked up the blonde. Draco waved a hand as they got out and dried them off.
Harry leaned in to kiss Draco. The blonde moaned and wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck. Harry might not do love but he could do this. He knew how to make Draco moan and beg for Harry to fuck him. They could figure out having a kid together, as long as Draco was with Harry it would be fine. He would show the blonde man that.
Harry stared down at Draco’s small hand laced in his. The door opened and a woman with very curly hair and a nice smile came in.
Harry continued his path downward and lightly bit Draco’s collarbone. The blonde squirmed in his arms grinding his cock against Harry.
“I know son. For the Alpha Prime to be traveling with his pregnant mate… your instincts are going to be almost uncontrollable. Maybe Draco should go back to the Fae lands with his parents for a few months. We can complete the Alpha Prime transference and you can get control before bringing him home.”
Harry withdrew his finger and nodded. Suddenly they were running and everything was a blur. Harry was using his werewolf speed to get to the tents. Draco blinked and they were at the edge of the field. Harry’s Alpha tent was huge. Draco didn’t have long to take in the details before Harry whisked them into the tent. Inside was a large bed covered with a black comforter. Harry threw Draco across the room onto the bed. He started to bounce off but caught himself with his equally fast Fae reflexes.
Oliver set Caleb down at the foot of the stairs and Caleb took off towards Draco. “Dad! We go to city today?” His son asked excitedly. Draco nodded and hugged his baby close. Draco ran a hand through his soft curls.
Draco nodded absentmindedly. He couldn’t imagine what Neville must be feeling. He could understand why Harry wouldn’t want to rub his friend’s face in the fact that they were happily mated. Draco had always known Harry to be compassionate to those he loved. Draco sighed and moved to get out of bed. He winced as his sore body protested and slick leaked from his hole. His heat was mostly over but he imagined he would want Harry inside him again soon.
“Oh, okay. Well, that is sooner than I expected but I knew it would happen soon. But I’m sure it’ll be fine Harry. Plus, I’ll be there to help you.”
Narcissa gave Draco a look and went past them inside. Draco moved back into the foyer as Harry came inside. Draco felt caged in by Harry’s big body.
“What about the twins?” They had 4-year-old twin daughters Riley and Dylan. Draco had taken the girls when he left to go stay with his mother.
He and Pansy turned their forms over to Hermione and picked up their identifying name badges. Draco’s was a green shaped acorn tag to symbolize he was Fae and had a red circle around his name indicating he was an Omega. The tags were only meant to be worn during the first dinner given the unlikelihood they would stay intact after the First Chase. Draco and Pansy stepped to the side of the table while they waited for their parents to make their way over from the carriage.
The car stopped and Harry looked out as they reached Parkinson’s house. He didn’t want to let Draco out of his sight.
Draco got out of the car as Mark opened the door and walked towards the doctor’s office. Draco heard the other door closed and felt Harry’s body heat as he came up to walk next to him. They walked through the sliding doors and Draco smiled at the receptionist.
Oliver cupped his cheek tenderly “it’s okay Draco. I had a feeling the baby was Harry’s and I knew he wasn’t going to stay out of your life. But I’ve loved you for a long time Draco and I’m not about to just give up. So call me later.”
“I’m sorry Dray, I have to move.” Harry began to thrust in and out and grabbed underneath Draco’s bottom to anchor him in place. The Omega wrapped his legs around Harry’s waist and kissed Harry sloppily.
Harry was eager to skip to the part of the evening when he could get the blonde alone. After the Dance of Celia, it would be time for the Chase. Harry wanted to bite Draco as soon as possible and confirm what he already suspected, that Draco was his mate. If his bite took and formed a mating bond they were mates and could spend the rest of the week in newly mated bliss. He knew a few Alphas from his tribe who had to bite several creatures before finding their mate. Luckily, it was a pleasurable experience regardless if you were mates or not. If you were mates however…. Harry reached down to adjust his hard cock, he had been in a constant state of arousal since his earlier exchange with Draco.
Harry slapped his bottom again, “Oh is that how it’s going to be short stuff? Do I need to show you who the Alpha Prime is?”
“Pans, I told you I had a doctor’s appointment.” The blonde said dryly as he got out of the car. Harry watched as they moved towards the entrance. He got out and called after “I won’t give up Draco. I’ll be back tomorrow.”
The doctor squeezed the gel onto Draco’s stomach and placed the wand over it. Harry watched in amazement as images started to show up on the screen.
Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck and Harry dropped his arms to Draco’s waist. Harry groaned as he felt Draco’s tongue brush his and gripped Draco’s thighs. He lifted the blonde in the air backed up towards the wall. Draco gasped as his back hit the wall and their cock’s came together. Harry moved his mouth downward to lick and suck at Draco’s neck.
“Daddy, Daddy. You’ve been gone so long! I lost a tooth and Riley got new dance shoes! We missed you Daddy. Why were you gone so long?”
“Knock, knock.” His mother stood in the doorway of his room. Narcissa smiled gently and came to sit next to Draco.
Lucius moved his furious silver gaze to Draco and his eyes softened. “Go on Draco, use the bathroom. Mr. Potter and I will be returning to the party.”
Harry finished pouring his drink and threw it back with one swallow. He walked over until he was right in front of the blonde.
Harry chuckled. “Alright my pampered Omega. Let’s get you some comfort.” He stood up and offered Draco his hand. Once the small Omega was standing he hooked an arm around him and pulled Draco close. They kissed for a moment before Harry pulled back and tapped a finger on the smaller man’s nose.
Pansy winked at Draco “There is plenty for my Alpha’s hands to be full with” she gestured towards her ample bosom.
“That’s for you to decide darling.” She stood and smoothed her blue skirt down. “Now, I’m off to take Riley and Dylan to dance class. Do you plan to stop moping long enough to meet us for dinner later? Hermione said the special tonight is Lobster Ravioli which you know is my favorite.”
Hermione paused only to shoot her a look of distress, “Don’t you think if I could, I would?” She glanced around the common room. Lavender had looked up at the sudden rise of her voice.
Hermione hesitated before shrugging, nodding her head, “Yes, he seems like the most likely to be up to no good, which is
father was a shitty person and my mother was a psychopath. The woman who actually raised me is dead and my family name raises the worst suspicions on me.” He told her rather forcefully. “Not everyone has the privileges you do.”
“Nice to see you too, Lils!” He said, twisting her in his arms and then finally setting her on her feet. She glared up at him and then to his twin and then to Ben, who seemed to hang around them a lot. “Always a cheer to see your pretty face!”
She couldn’t hide her smile, “I think Nico Di Angelo would suit you better--you're both pale, dark-haired introverts who pop n and out of places, controlling the shadows, princes of hell--"
They made their way across the grounds around five to three, to where Hagrid lived. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door.
Persephone waited with impatience, debating on whether or not to just take the last drop of the smallest bottle and pitch herself into the fire to prove a point.
Persephone felt herself freeze in horror—wherever he had come from, he was near. Filch, of course, knew the shortcuts in the castle and of course could appear anywhere—and very quickly too, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to add to this horrifying moment, it was Snape who replied, "The Restricted Section? Well, they can't be far, we'll catch them."
boy—she could find a different way to grow her stupid wand. Maybe she could just ask Hagrid about it—she was very sure that his umbrella is a wand rebuilt so why not?
The fire travelled up her arm as she felt it roam and she could finally feel the plant around her mouth let her breathe, “LIGHT A FIRE!” She gasped.
"McGonagall doesn’t favor us, that’s for sure," Persephone mumbled. Just as she took a bite of her eggs on toast, the mail arrived.
It was the greatest night of Persephone’s life, especially when she noticed, though how blurry it was, that Malfoy had frozen in shock and humiliation.
“That’s Draco’s mum?” Persephone gaped. This woman was…beautiful. Absolutely stunning. She had a very angular grace, almost out of a painting. She had an air of easy elegance, something that Persephone imagined had to come with an angel. It was almost unnerving.
So a trip to Italy became much more realistic when the three decided to find a theatre that played the Percy Jackson movie. The thought of having a fun summer was completely out of the norm for Persephone.
She couldn’t understand this—Voldemort had killed her parents, what could he possibly have done to shadow over this fact, what could be so great? Unable to say much but a bidding thank you, she paid seven gold Galleons for her wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his shop.
“Ron!” She stared at him, incredulous, “We cannot fly the car! Especially not in such a crowded place! Imagine the amount of trouble your dad would get in!”
When they met with Mary and Reginald again, Persephone noticed Evangeline pass Diana a note. Persephone raised a brow and Diana smiled coyly.
She’d also been able to lift things with the air, if she pretended like the air was solid and she pushed up, concentrating on that bit of air. So, air and Earth. It was thrilling to find this—she wondered if the instances of heat resistance meant that she could also do something with fire. She’d go down and stick her hand in the fireplace if that wouldn’t immediately break the façade the Dursleys were putting on. And besides, she was more interested to see whether or not she could do something with water.
Persephone could tell she was baiting her on, to tease her behind her back probably, but Persephone smiled kindly, “I know English, obviously, and Spanish, French, Latin, Greek, though more Ancient than modern and I’m learning Italian right now.”
“You must first swear in front of all those who carried the legacy of mischief that you too will honor it,” George said. “You must swear, as solemnly as you can, that you are up to no good! Swear it!”
They were held by the Astronomy Professor and were more relaxed than Quidditch practice. They started off with meditation and stretching and just a very calming atmosphere. Persephone didn’t know what she ought to wear so she went with the classic black tights and tank top.
"Every year she makes us all a sweater," said Ron, unwrapping his own, "and mine's always maroon. One of yours is at least a
Feeling oddly almost like her legs had stopped responding to her brain, Persephone stood right behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind her, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.
"You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?" said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all. "It's people they feel sorry for. See, there's Potter, who's got no parents, then there's that Weasley brother, who's got no money—you should be on the team, Longbottom, you've got no brains." Malfoy pointedly ignored the fact that George Weasley was also on his house’s team.
George nodded in approval, directing behind her, his hands looped under her arms as to make room, “I’m so glad Ron never believed girls had cooties.”
“We should be able to pull the door open,” Persephone said. She stared back to where she heard the flute playing from and cleared her throat. She started to vocalize that tune that Ariel sang from the Little Mermaid, when she traded her voice in for legs. Hermione looked surprised and Persephone shrugged, gesturing for Ron to come towards them.
Persephone hummed, seeing this as a great opportunity to leave, “Well, it’s been nice meeting you, but I should go find my friend.”
As she kept staring at herself, she saw her image zone in and out, from a ballerina outfit, holding flowers, to her being Quidditch captain of the Slytherin team, winning the house cup. It always flickered back to her showing off her house colors in pride.
The day was sunny and warm. She wore a floral, old dress and her hair was re-braided into Dutch braids. Sometimes, if she tried to push hard enough, she could even style her hair. It took a lot of concentration and a good amount of an idea of what she wanted to have her hair pushed out, straightened and twisted into certain braids. She pinned them up with bobby pins and that’s all she needed to do manually.
Maybe if she looked into it before he could, she could find where it was hidden! She could only assume Quirrell did not know how the mirror worked so she started to edge to the left, to get a clear view of the glass, but the ropes only tightened. She fell over.
“Well, I for one am jealous,” Daphne said, staring dreamily up at the ceiling. “You’ve got boys just about eating out of your hand—and older boys!” She sighed. “I’ve got to wait until I find a nice pureblooded boy…otherwise my parents will freak out.”
The creature that stood on the other side of the door offered a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, thorny feet. The smell coming from it was incredibly revolting, it wavered into the bathroom so quickly she couldn’t keep from gagging. It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long.
Later that day, Hermione hugged Persephone goodbye and waved at Ron. The minute Hermione had left, Persephone and Ron were greeted by George and Fred, who had nicked a bag of marshmallows. They got good armchairs by the fire and while Persephone kept herself with marshmallows, the three boys pierced bread, English muffins, a croissant, and anything else they could find. They plotted jokingly about ways to get Malfoy expelled—jokingly because there was no way any of those plans would work.
She was in deep thought—the sky was so blue, not a cloud in the sky. The water was reflecting the towering castle above, and it was tranquil. There nothing out of the ordinary…
She was hooked on the words, ‘I clear a mind’. She sort of understood—it cleared her thoughts for her and, takin into account how she felt at the moment, made her emotions very transparent. She was upset at Dumbledore and amazed at the magic of the diadem.
Flitwick considered her for a moment, before saying, “Ms. Potter, what are your opinions on theatre?”
Suddenly, some people yelled her name, in the midst of the panic. Without thinking, she came to her senses and screamed, “We’re here! We’re here! Help! Help us!”
She raised a brow to him, "…Er, no, you’re white…” She said, frowning in confusion. “My dad is Spanish, I think.” She felt herself building up unease. Were there prejudices against the ethnicities of the students here too?
“People who’ve seen death,” He told her casually and she dropped her hand in surprise. He looked up at her, “I’m not surprised you can see them…with your parents and all…”
. However, checking her watch, it was nearly three now. No one would be arriving for several hours. Carrying their trunks, they reached the great oak front doors and knocked. Persephone shrugged, “What else is there to do?”
. That later fact should have made the class cool but it only made it more boring. Apparently, the story goes that Professor Binns had been very old when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. His voice was dead, literally, and just so monotonous that nothing he taught them was anything interesting. The only fun thing about the class is when she let Salem wander on her desk and amuse several Gryffindors around—well, except for one.
It was a large and beautiful circular room, full of funny little noises. A number of curious silver instruments stood on spindle legged tables, whirring and emitting little puffs of smoke. The walls were covered with portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses, all of whom were snoozing gently in their frames. There was also an enormous, claw footed desk, and, sitting on a shelf behind it, a shabby, tattered wizard’s hat—the Sorting Hat.
, and Dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion underneath. Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors.
“Absolutely,” Persephone said before she could stop herself. Truth be told, her legs were itching for a swim—question was, would she have legs in the water?
“Dobby had to punish himself, miss,” The elf sad miserably and cross eyed. “Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir…”
Susan didn’t look convinced and told her so through a look on her face. Persephone sighed, “It’s nothing, I’m just waiting for a letter.”
Suddenly, a shadow appeared over her window and she jumped. And then Ron Weasley was outside her window—wait. She ran across the room, tripping over her feet, “Ron!?”
It did not turn out to be Mrs. Norris. It was the exact opposite—it was Neville. He was curled up on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer.
Hagrid helped her put a small pile into her bag. She noticed some things in the back of the vault were not money but items—some jewelry, some rolled up pieces of parchment, and even a golden-framed portrait. The portrait painted a handsome couple, a woman and a man, both well into their years, and Persephone could only make out the top of a black hair boy’s hair before something else caught her attention, “I own a house?”
She cleared her throat, nervously, “Well, I’m rather certain ghosts inhabit the castle and it isn’t a secret.”
Whatever tenseness lay on his own shoulders dropped, “I really don't think they should let the other sort in, do you? They're just not the same, they've never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What's your name, anyway?"
Ron was done his homework and cheerfully agreed to the swimming. Persephone knocked on Percy’s door on her way to Gary’s room and he denied the invitation.
She felt her heart lighten. That was good, right? That he was asking her questions rather than shutting her down immediately. “In Slytherin. I believe that I belong in Slytherin house. The sorting hat nearly put me in it—”
“Don’t tell me I deserved it,” Ron snapped, sitting up properly once more. Why were they always bickering?
It went well enough. Boring, but well. Persephone nodded along as if she were interested in any of Uncle Vernon’s stories, laughed uncomfortably at the Japanese golfer story and ate her appetizer.
“You’ve got something in your hair,” A dreamy voice said. She had just realized she was resting not on the dirt ground but on a rock and that’s what was so uncomfortable. The rock was on the edge of the shore and she was trying hard to open her eyes. They stung in the air when she did open them and when she finally registered the voice was not a voice she recognized, she had opened her eyes.
“Dang,” Maybe she was going into hysterics. That would explain a lot. It felt more like a panic attack than anything. “Too bad. I had a name picked and everything.”
She sighed. “My entire life, I’ve always been known as the pretty girl, poor orphan girl is too pretty to be an orphan,” She scolded. “Or, that girl is too much of a troublemaker, she’s the wrong type of girl, you’d never expect it out of her…I don’t want to have to only be one thing—boys can be smart and handsome, why can’t girls? Girls have to either be really pretty or really smart. There’s no in-between—I study things that are considered ‘a man’s subject’,” She made air quotations, “And yet I’m just the ‘pretty, orphan girl,’” She bit her lip, “Sometimes, I think I’ll never be good enough, for anything—and I’m so stupid and selfish for thinking this, but I sometimes think I wasn’t worth my parents dying for me.”
"Oh, Hagrid! It’s just a name! It literally could be Chuck-e-Cheese and people wouldn’t dare speak it!" Persephone snapped. “I’ve met him and I’ve lost my family because of him—I deserve the right to call him as I please!” This was so shocking that Hagrid choked on his next sob. He seemed to truly see her in that moment and she faltered in her determined expression. “Cheer up, Hagrid. I don’t blame and neither does anyone else. Want a Chocolate Frog? I’ve got too many to know what to do with.” She smiled.
She spent her days in the bedroom, shut in by her own will because now that neither her Uncle nor Aunt spoke to her, she was not forced to do anything. It was ridiculous how far they took it—whenever she came down for meals that she wasn’t even allowed to cook, they acted as though any chair with Persephone in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while.
“Be sure to speak very, very clearly, dear, else you’ll pop out the wrong grate,” Mrs. Weasley told her as she watched with fascination as George vanished too.
Ron was brilliant, of course, “Peeves,” He said in a hoarse whisper. “The Bloody Baron has his own reasons for being invisible.”
Persephone’s smile was frozen, and her eyes drifted to Hades, coming down the stairs. Suddenly, a lot became clear to her and she wished she hadn’t had Tom in her mind to make things so painfully clear. Daphne’s actions, her reactions…they had seen each other over the summer…they were purebloods, from two of the families of the stupid Sacred Twenty-Eight…
"You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-making," he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but Persephone was captivated by every word. Much like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. "As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses…I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death—if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach."
“Draco…. My dad wants to complete the full transfer of Alpha Prime to me when I get back to Blackwood.”
“Caleb what have I told you about answering the door sweetpea?” Pansy’s voice grew louder as she appeared around the corner.
Before things could go any further Harry heard a loud “Ahem.” They both turned their heads and Draco squeaked. There was Lucius Malfoy standing there with one eyebrow raised and a disdainful look on his face.
“Dray, that’s possible. But, you need to know one way or another darling. It’s the only way you can move on.”
Once mates are found it was well-known that they would move to the tents sectioned off on the other side of the festival and not return until the last day. Draco blushed. He had his first heat at 16 and was given the Omega appropriate training regarding reproduction and sexual relations but he still felt woefully shy. In his Alpha/Omega novels the lovemaking was always tender and came after the couple knew each other. Draco had heard some of the palace staff discussing Alpha ruts and it had sounded harsh and intense. Draco was nervous at the thought of some large Alpha commanding him and owning his body.
Draco was able to pick up his father’s scent as they got closer, as well as James, as well as Harry’s friends Neville, and the redhead Ginny. Draco looked around wondering where Harry was. They approached the group and Draco smiled at his father.
“Gentlemen, I will now bless all those present today with fertility and good fortune.” Minerva gestured for them to each place a hand on the other’s clay marking.
Harry sighed. He loved his father deeply but he didn’t ask to be Alpha Prime, at least not yet. James wouldn’t hear any of his objections and said it wasn’t right for a more dominant wolf to be serving as his second in command. His father had found a new mate several years back and she was pregnant. Harry suspected his father just wanted to live a quiet life given what had happened with Harry’s mother. He couldn’t fault James for that and knew it had been tough to not only raise Harry but also rule their people. When Harry presented as Alpha and his strength was shown, James was relieved. He thought things would be easier for Harry with the other were tribes given his obvious dominance. Harry had to train twice as hard as other dominant not to overwhelm Omegas and Betas, while also not killing Alphas who had challenged him.
Narcissa entwined her fingers with his and they walked swiftly back. Pansy joined on his other side and put her hand in his.
Harry laughed. “Oh, don’t worry. I’ll be eating you soon enough.” With that Harry reached out and drew the Alpha symbol on Draco’s smooth chest. His skin was soft and cool to the touch. Harry could hear Draco’s heart rate pick up and was surprised to find his was as well. Draco gasped as Harry finished the design right above his groin. Harry almost groaned as he smelled the slick which was leaking from Draco’s hole.
Harry’s eyebrow lifted. He was always doing stuff like that and making him look older than his eight years.
“So what do you need the kitchens for?” Susan asked. “It’s rather cold for a picnic out on the grounds.”
The students spilled out onto the platform. She carried her trunk like a suitcase, pushing her glasses up her nose, looking around the crowds of reuniting families hugging and kissing.
Persephone nodded, “I just hope I’m not in the class with the Slytherins.” She grimaced. “Humiliating myself, being sweaty and clumsy in one class for the next five years with either Draco or Pansy—or worse, both—would be the worst case scenario.”
“Hm,” Mindi narrowed her eyes at Persephone, who pretended to take a sip from her bottle. “What about the Weasley twins?”
She opened the door and slid inside, catching a whiff of damp earth and fertilizer mingling with the heavy perfume of some giant, umbrella-sized flowers dangling from the ceiling. She took her spot amongst her Gryffindor and Hufflepuff friends, listening to what Professor Sprout was saying. There were about twenty different colored ear muffs lying on the bench that Professor Sprout was standing behind in the center of the greenhouse.
“Which one?” She questioned, raising a brow. His friends were watching intently as she crossed her arms, trying to ignore them.
"Well hello to you too, Herman.” She waved. “And it’s really, very none of your business what I do with my free time now if you’ll excuse us.”
She returned the Remembrall to Neville, and caught McGonagall’s approving eyes. Even Percy had noticed the scene and told her if she were to keep it up, she’d be on her way to being a prefect. This made Hermione jump violently and stare up at them in shock. She’d been one of the ones who thought loudly in the girl’s dorm how ridiculous it was to edge a bully on. Yikes.
Pansy laughed a high pitch laugh. “That’s not what I see when you two are in rehearsal…” Pansy chipped in, “Always around him, hanging on his every word. I’m sure I’ve seen you blush at least ten times while around him.”
She came across as very handy. And she was—she knew how to fix things, not all things, but lots of things. She had once been told in school that she couldn’t help in something because she was a girl and couldn’t keep herself from becoming mad and fixing the thing anyway. She liked proving people wrong—she liked doing things on her own. Why should she have someone do something for her when she could do it herself? Something broken? She could fix it—or she would die trying.
Persephone slipped away, walking quietly to the bathroom. She grabbed a blanket and a pillow and a bowl of candy on the way, knowing this wouldn’t be easy. There was no lock, for safety reasons, and so she knocked gently.
It only seemed logical that someone might hear the racket they’d made. A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart.
"Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something," Ron snapped. "Any other teacher, sure, Quirrell, absolutely, poor loser, he passed out when he told everyone about the troll, maybe I would see your point of view if it was him, but Snape? No, I would not put anything past Snape. Real question is what's he after? What's that dog guarding?"
I know what this is—A complete set of the Chudley Cannons trilogy, with their books and posters and—ooooh! Signed jerseys!” He was shocked. “But…but how…But Lily I can’t….”
Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite still, facedown.
Persephone was drowsy, tired of the day already, but she didn’t miss it when she, again, saw the people in the portraits along the corridors whisper and point as they passed by. She listened to Hermione talk about everything they passed and she couldn’t blame her for that—she was sure she’d be if she wasn’t so tired. Percy and Audrey led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Persephone was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt.
He passed a cut up piece of her cake and passed it to her and she hesitantly took a bite, all the while watching the giant watch her. He didn’t seem at all like any other strange man she’d ever thought of would break into places. He was very relaxed, his eyes filled with tenderness, as if he was watching baby ducklings try to walk.
George’s voice snapped her from her daydream. “There’s the main road,” he pointed down to the ground. “Should be another ten minutes…we should hurry to get the car in the garage, it’s getting light out.”
At three-thirty that afternoon, Persephone, Ron and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson, dressed for the first time in their flying robes. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance.
“But don’t panic and get out too early; wait until you see Fred and George.” Mrs. Weasley offered and this made no sense, as she said to keep her eyes closed. Persephone, too nervous to say anything, threw the powder into the flames and stepped in as emerald flames engulfed her.
Draco had by chance run into Oliver when he was three months pregnant and not showing yet. Oliver had asked him for coffee and it had been nice. At the end of the date Draco had felt compelled to tell Oliver that he was pregnant with another man’s baby. Oliver hadn’t even blinked and had just asked Draco on another date. Even though he yelled at Pansy he had been suspicious of Oliver’s motives at first. The other man had just looked at him with his honey brown eyes and said “you’re a beautiful man Draco and clearly whoever he was is a fool. I don’t plan to make the same mistake.”
Draco paused for a moment and then nodded. “Our mating must have triggered it. It wasn’t supposed to start for another two weeks.”
Draco sighed and ran a hand through his white-blonde hair. “Well, you reap what you sow darling. I got space from you and realized that you were right. We are only making each other miserable.”
His buzzer rang. Harry walked over to the intercom on the wall and pressed the button. “Yes?” He said sharply, he wasn’t in the mood for disturbances.
Draco sat on the bed in shock. He had one hand placed on his stomach as he thought about the months ahead he and his unborn child would be facing. Draco wasn’t sure what would happen without their Alpha around to help with the early stages of pregnancy. Draco’s mind starting spinning thinking about the possible consequences and what could happen if he and Harry had to stay away longer.
Draco watched as his husband went back inside. He suddenly couldn’t shake the feeling that something was going to happen. Draco frowned before bringing his attention to the road.
Harry stroked his thumb on Draco’s throat and drifted his lips across his Omega’s soft cheek. He got to Draco’s ear and lightly bit down.
“Great.” Draco groaned again and covered his eyes with his hands as his mother chuckled and left. Draco heard the sounds of her gathering the girls and leaving the house.
Draco groaned and laid back on the bed. He rested a hand on his swollen belly and felt the baby move underneath his hand.
He and Harry slumped forward on the bed. Draco waved his hand to clean the bed with his magic. Harry moved them forward and cuddled his big body close. Draco felt his eyes start to close as he felt contentment drift across the bond.
Draco thought for a moment. The ceremony was the kick-off to the festival and included a chosen Alpha and Omega to do the dance of Celia. The leader of the festival, a witch named Minerva would pick and Alpha and Omega whom she feels a strong energy from. These two are not always mates but it happens sometimes. They then must do the dance which included disrobing and making the marks of fertility on each other’s body with a clay paint. After that Minerva would say charms of fertility and good fortune. The horn would then be sounded and the Great Chase would begin. Omegas, Alphas, and Betas would run towards the forest where they would spend the night running, playing, chasing, and so he had heard (even kissing), anyone they feel a connection with.
Harry didn’t even stop to think what that meant for a him with Draco’s desire for marriage and Harry’s aversion to it but, he wasn’t willing to examine it right this moment.
“Alpha Potter, may I speak with you?” Harry was drawn from his thoughts by the appearance of Minerva. She was a beautiful woman even in her advanced age. Long silver hair flowed down her back, while her blue eyes sparkled with mischief. Harry knew her story was a tragic one after losing her mate and child many years ago. Minerva never seemed to let the burden of her sadness stop her from living life to the fullest. He asked her once as a young child how she went on and she had simply said “for my mate darling, I live because she didn’t.”
Harry stared out the window of his penthouse apartment. He lived in one of his many hotels and the penthouse was beautiful. Beautiful and heartless, empty. It was as empty as he was, Harry thought. Harry held a glass in his hand and sipped some of his expensive scotch. His life was full of expensive, pretty, and hollow things. Harry had once thought Draco was one of those pretty, expensive things. Until, the small blonde had wormed his way so far into Harry’s life and heart he didn’t know how he would ever get the blonde out.
Harry covered Draco’s mouth with his own as he pressed the blonde harder against the wall. He swallowed Draco’s moans with his tongue and pushed his fingers in between his ass cheeks pants and all.
Draco stared across the driveway at Harry. How unfair, he thought that Harry looked even more gorgeous than the last time Draco saw him. Harry’s hair was tousled as usual and he was wearing a black Henley which was stretched tight across his muscular chest and arms, as well as dark jeans that hugged him like a second skin. Draco felt a flash of heat as he thought of how familiar he was with Harry’s body. Damn pregnancy hormones.
“Shut up!” He laughed and tried to will himself to calm down. He was getting carried away and hadn’t even seen his mate’s face.
Lucius and Narcissa made a striking sight as they approached Draco. Draco’s mother was a nymph like Hermione and was tall and lithe. Unlike Draco’s pale hair his mother had dark tresses that flowed down her back. His mother’s blue eyes shown with pride as she approached them. Lucius walked slightly behind Narcissa but looked no less proud. Draco inherited all his features from his father. Lucius had pale hair like Draco, gray eyes, and a wicked sense of fashion. Draco however, was petite in comparison to his parents and only came up to his father’s shoulder. But to onlookers, it was obvious they were a family.
Harry clenched his jaw as he stared down at the pictures. Spread out in front of him was Draco Malfoy in various places and the one on top was Draco with Oliver Wood. A very PREGNANT Draco with Oliver Wood. In the picture the small blonde man was looking up at the larger man with a smile on his face. Oliver had one hand on his pregnant belly and was gazing at Draco like he was the only man in the world.
Harry looked to the side at the street wondering why Draco was staying here at not at his parent’s estate in France. Draco’s parents adored him but they had not been fond of Harry. He remembered his first time meeting them it had been early on when Harry and Draco had first started fucking.
“I am so sorry. I did not mean to be away from my best girls for so long. I missed you both so much. Why don’t you both run inside and I’ll be right in with presents?”
Harry stood and watched as Draco did the same from his table. They walked towards the front where a space was cleared for the dance.
Draco frowned and looked up at Harry. “Why wouldn’t it be safe? You would never hurt me Harry and I’m not afraid of your dominance.”
“We weren’t able to get the information from his doctor’s office sir. However, my wife and I have three of our own and I would say he looks to be about six months give or take a month.”
Harry opened his mouth to say something but stopped and narrowed his eyes as another car pulled into the driveway. Draco turned ad watched as Oliver got out of his car and stopped short when he saw them.
She sighed. “Draco I know he hurt you and I know you still love him. Maybe you two can work things out. Or at least be civil enough to co-parent.”
“I don’t want him to look at us as an obligation Pansy. My child deserves more than that. I deserve more than that.”
Their kiss grew heated and Harry moved the hand from Draco’s neck down his chest, over his rounded belly, and felt Draco’s erection.
Just a few weeks ago a were-tiger named Oliver had challenged Harry. He had beat him to a bloody pulp before anyone could pull him off. Harry had been so consumed by his Alpha instincts all he could think was to destroy the were who challenged him. Harry had gone to the Were’s elder counsel to express his worries after. Harry had told Severus, a mentor from the counsel, that he was afraid he would never woo his mate, only frighten him. Severus had assured him that wasn’t true but Harry cast a distressed eye at the Alphas slowly moving from their submissive stance. He hoped Severus was right.
Draco sniffled and said with tears running down his face, “I wanted Harry to be the one asking me to marry him. Is that stupid?”
“So the great Harry Potter has nothing to say hmmm? Typical. Well you know what Potter? Oliver asked me to marry him and I’m going to say yes. He can give me everything you can’t and he is twice the man you are!”
*****************************************************************************************************************************
Harry wasted no more time and bit into Draco’s neck. He moaned as the sweet taste of Draco’s Fae blood began filling his mouth. He tasted glorious and Harry could get lost in the taste. He pulled back and lapped at the wound with his tongue. Harry and Draco both gasped at the same time when they felt the mating bond solidify. Harry watched in amazement as the bite marks changed and formed the shape of a small moon. The mark of a werewolf mate and the red line indicated Harry’s status as an Alpha. Harry felt Draco’s mind open to his.
“The Malfoy boy, huh? Guess I should have known given how you two used to carry on.” His dad chuckled.
Harry heard the soft voice and wanted to call out to whoever smelled like that not to go but he felt his thoughts fade as another wave hit him.
Harry felt a flash of heat through the bond and paused. He scented the air and groaned. Draco’s heat was approaching! Their mating must have triggered it. Fuck, he would go into a rut in response. Thankfully the festival provided for its guests because Harry and Draco would not be leaving this tent at all this week. Harry needed to prepare Draco.
“Do you feel it? We made a baby.” Draco then looked up from their joined hands over his stomach and gave him the brightest smile. Harry nodded and leaned forward to lightly kiss the blonde.
Harry was drawn from his memories as he heard a car approaching. A black town car pulled to stop in the driveway and Harry watched as first Pansy Parkinson got out and then he watched as hair so blonde it was almost white became visible. Harry’s jaw clenched as Draco came around the door and was in full sight. The blonde looked so beautiful it hurt Harry to look at him. His was face was slightly rounded with pregnancy and his cheeks were rosy from the warmth of the car. Draco was wearing a green sweater and black pants that fit tight to his legs. His petite frame was pretty much the same except for his large rounded belly. Harry felt a flash of rage as he watched Draco put a hand to his belly when he saw Harry. Draco had been pregnant this whole time and not a word. Harry wasn’t leaving today without settling things with Draco. Draco was his and that was his child. He didn’t need to stay with Parkinson anymore. With that Harry made eye contact with Draco and crossed his arms over his chest.
Draco almost stumbled at the wave of heat that hit his body. The Alpha was using his significant pheromones to distract him. Draco focused anew on making it to the woods. As much as he wanted Harry to catch him, he also wanted to cling to his freedom for a few remaining minutes. Draco was almost certain they were mates and thought of the life they would have together. In the romance novels he so dearly enjoyed (and Pansy teased him endlessly for) the Alpha was always calm and polite. Draco saw no resemblance to the almost punishing masculine energy Harry produced and his wry sense of humor. Harry had always been passionate, even when they were children and possessive of the things he claimed as his own.
I want you all to know I do my best to tag everything so that readers know what they are getting into. That being said if you do not like this story, please do not read or leave comments that are discouraging. I write because it's fun and I do not want anyone to be uncomfortable because of my work. I am writing these characters how I see them and if that's not for you it's okay. But leave space for the folks who are enjoying it.
Draco felt Harry move his head and then gasped as he felt Harry’s fangs pressed into his butt cheek. He was really going to bite him!
“I don’t know Pans. I don’t know what to do. I love Harry, I always have. You know I’ve loved him since we were in school and he was that unattainable, hot, older boy. But, I still don’t understand him and he has such a big chip on his shoulder. Oliver would never say the things that Harry said to me that night.”
Harry Potter stood at the edge of the tents and stared into the woods. His mate was at the festival he was sure of it. Harry heard footsteps approaching and turned to see his best friend Neville walking up to where Harry stood. Neville was a werewolf like Harry, but unlike Harry he was a Beta. Harry’s Alpha pheromones were the strongest in over 200yrs so forming friendships was not something his family thought would happen. Luckily for Harry, Neville was unbothered and the two became fast friends. Harry looked down at his friend and smirked. At well over six feet Harry looked down on pretty much everyone. He knew he appeared intimidating given his large muscular frame and often serious expression. Only those who were close to him got to see the sparkle in his green eyes and know his playful side.
Harry looked down at Draco. The small blonde looked so distraught and Harry couldn’t take it. Maybe this was for the best.
“Darling, I’m so sorry. I heard about everything. It’s going to be okay, I’ll be going home with you too.”
She smiled, “You’re my Alpha in the Dance of Celia tonight.” Before he could say anything she winked and walked over to the Omega table.
“Mates enjoy the festival as well, just horizontally!” Pansy giggled at the look on his face. “Come on Dray, it’ll be fine. Once you find your mate you’ll understand the passion I’m talking about.”
Draco sighed. Oliver looked between them and then nodded. “It’s okay Dray, we will talk later okay?”
He looked over at Pansy and sighed. “What if Harry is my mate Pans? He’s the next Alpha Prime! Our life will never be quiet.”
“What are you doing forcing all these poor alphas to their knees?” Harry laughed and pushed Ginny away after her question.
Harry crushed his lips to Draco’s and swept his tongue inside. He thrust his hips against Draco’s and moaned at the feel of Draco’s hands sliding into his hair. Harry explored Draco’s mouth with his tongue and moved his hand around to grasp Draco’s thigh. He hooked his arm under the Omega’s knee and circled his hips against him. Harry tore his mouth away and began to kiss down Draco’s throat. He felt his fangs distend and paused right over the scent gland.
Harry came awake slowly. He was somewhat groggy from the dream. He and Draco had a shared dream from their memories. This was common with newly mated couples as Harry had been told. He looked down at the blonde in his arms. Draco’s long hair was spread out and his pointed ear was all Harry could see as the Omega had his face smooshed in Harry’s chest. Harry reached out to stroke the tip of his mate’s ear. Draco reached a hand up to bat him away. Harry chuckled. His little Omega did not like to be woken up.
“Sssshhh!” Draco grabbed Pansy and pulled her down with him. “Have you lost your mind Draco? What is wrong with you?”
He sighed and got out of the car. Maybe he should talk to Oliver before they started trying for real. Draco absentmindedly walked into Pansy’s house and heard the sound of Caleb laughing. He smiled and headed towards the sound. Draco stopped short when he heard the responding masculine chuckle. He knew that sound. Draco rushed around the corner and dropped his bag when he saw who was playing with his son.
“Well, I see why you were waiting to find out the sex then. I am glad to hear you are feeling well. All your lab work and vitals look good. We will just do a quick ultrasound, print some pictures, and get you two out of here.”
Draco looked out the window again and pressed his hand to the glass, if only he could just catch a glance of his friend he would feel better knowing his friend was okay…….
Draco stared up wide-eyed at his childhood friend. He had never told Harry how pretty he thought his eyes were or that he loved the way his one lock of black hair always flopped over his forehead in a way that made his heart feel warm. Draco knew they were only 8 but he thought he loved Harry maybe. He had heard his mama talk about love before and how she and Papa had fallen in love. Draco knew his heart felt warm and went kinda fast whenever he saw Harry and he always wanted to make the other boy smile. Draco had only told the older Alpha boys he would meet them in the garden because he was mad when Harry told him he and his family would be leaving soon.
Draco flushed and pushed Harry away. “Oliver is kind to me Harry. Something you know nothing about!”
“Honestly, Draco. I don’t know. Potter is…. Potter. I think he holds in and hasn’t dealt with his emotions about, anything. I think all you can do is talk to him. If he can’t tell you he can be the man and father you need him to be, then you have his answer.”
“Are you not wearing underwear? Naughty naughty baby.” Harry slipped his hands under the waistband of Draco’s pants and gripped his ass. He leaned down closer to Draco’s ear “do you need Daddy to fill you up baby?”
Harry sighed. He and Draco had met when Draco was 19 and Harry was 22. Harry had just gotten home from a tour with his band Gryffindor’s. Draco was a bartender at a popular bar in downtown London. Their connection had been instant.
Harry wasn’t even aware he was squeezing Draco’s hand as he absorbed the news. He was going to have a son. Harry James Potter was a father. It felt surreal.
Draco hurried to the door and unlocked it. He opened the door wide and there was Harry. His ex-husband looked even more handsome than when he left. Harry’s tall frame took up the doorway, his skin was deeply tanned from his time away, and if possible he looked more muscled. Draco looked up. Harry had dark circles under his eyes and his emerald eyes looked crazed. Harry stared down at Draco’s belly in shock.
“Somehow I think the babies will manage to stay in there.” Draco said in a dry tone. Harry just continued to grin.
Draco chuckled as he heard his son’s words from upstairs. Captain Joebob was the family dog. A somewhat surly but loveable bulldog. Caleb’s “uni” was his favorite unicorn toy that JB was particularly fond of chewing.
Harry heard himself growl and when he opened his eyes the pupils had widened until his eyes looked black. “I smell him.” Harry said in a gravelly voice. Harry started to stalk in the direction of the tents when he felt Neville’s hands on his arm.
Harry just laughed and continued walking. “Draco, you were being a baby and I told you to stop so…. now you come with me.”
“Harry! Put me down! This is…. undignified!” Draco’s face was bright red as he thought of everyone seeing his bare bottom. It’s not like they had had time to get clothes.
Draco’s eyes widened at Harry’s words. He had been waiting his whole life to be mated and now he was. It was surreal to hear those words come from his childhood friend.
He heard the door close behind the love of his life. Harry let out the scream of anguish he was holding in. He fell to his knees and cried.
Harry couldn’t look away from Draco, he was stunning. The small Omega and his friend finished their performance and others began clapping for them. Harry watched transfixed as a blush spread across his pale skin.
“Oh short stuff, you can do anything you want to me. Maybe someday you’ll even stop blushing when you mention it.” Harry teased, his eyes flashed black as he pictured what Draco said.
The elevator chimed and Harry turned as Draco walked out. The blonde had on a white long sleeve tunic shirt, over brown leggings, and ankle boots on. He looked as beautiful as always. Harry’s gaze dropped to the blonde’s stomach and saw Draco carried a small bag that was strewn across his chest. Draco was clutching the strap and seemed nervous.
Draco could definitely believe that the rumors are true. Harry’s dominance and strength had poured of him in waves. Not to mention his pheromones made Draco want to bare his throat in submission. Draco couldn’t believe how much Harry had grown. His childhood friend had been replaced by an incredibly sexy man. Harry was every inch the perfect Alpha any Omega would want and Draco had humiliated himself in front of him.
“Fuck,” he closed his eyes and attempted to reign in his unruly body. “Thanks Nev,” he said tiredly.
Draco whirled around and took in his Alpha. Harry was only wearing a loose pair of black pants and nothing else. Draco could see his tanned feet as the Alpha hadn’t bothered to put on shoes. Draco blushed as he saw the marks left behind on his mate’s body. Draco had bitten the bigger man, scratched him, and sucked every inch of his hard chest while in the throes of his heat. Draco looked up to meet Harry’s gaze and saw his green eyes were fading into black. Draco felt Harry’s arousal through the bond.
Harry fell to his knees and buried his head in his hands. He let out a pained yell. Harry reached into his pocket and pulled out the ultrasound photo he had of his and Draco’s son.
“Nothing has changed baby. I am exactly who I was 5 and a half months ago when I told you I don’t do love. I don’t do relationships and I especially don’t do families. I suffered a momentary lapse in judgement when I found out you were pregnant but that’s over now. I made a mistake when I sought you out.”
Harry tried to calm down as he stared at the pictures. Draco looked beautiful and happy in all of them. Harry moved some aside and stopped short at the one at the bottom. Draco was sitting on a park bench; his silver blonde hair fell slightly over his face as he had one hand cradled on his belly. Draco was smiling down at his stomach with a serene expression on his face. He looked even more beautiful than Harry had ever seen him. His cock ached at the thought of the blonde and how long it had been since he had been inside him. Harry had been dreaming of Draco for months, missing him, and looking for him. All along the blonde had been playing house and hiding their child from Harry.
Draco rolled his eyes but laughed and Harry joined in. Draco had always loved this side of Harry, the fun, easygoing guy.
“Harry, I just. I need a few moments okay?” Draco had turned and was looking at Harry with a distraught expression on his face.
“Shhhhh Harry. Give me your hand.” Unable to deny his mate anything he placed his large hand in Draco’s smaller one. Draco pulled Harry’s hand and placed it over his belly.
“Harry!” The blonde gasped and pressed his head back against the seat while hips started to move desperately.
“I am ready! Harry please!” Draco squirmed beneath him. Harry smiled, “let’s see then?” Harry brought a finger up to tease Draco’s hole. He pushed one inside and groaned when he felt how wet the Omega was. Slick was gushing from his hole and covered Harry’s finger.
“I know Alpha.” With a worried glance at the blonde Harry left the tent. Ginny was waiting outside for him this time. The redhead had several marks on her neck and looked blissful.
“Harry, pleasure to see you home and not gallivanting off on some adventure.” His mother said in a cool tone.
“What is it Alpha?” Draco’s eyes were already glassy from the onslaught of hormones his body was starting to produce.
Draco heard Pansy greet whomever was at the door and then let out a surprised breath as he saw Oliver walk into the room.
Harry dropped down quietly behind Draco from the trees. He watched as the small blonde looked around searching for him. Harry took a moment to observe the small Fae without interruption. Draco had always been beautiful, even when they were children. He hadn’t grown much in height, Harry thought amused. Draco was what fables of old would have described a fairy as. His hair was so blonde it shined like a beacon in the moonlight and was held back in a low ponytail. Harry wanted to see his hair unbound and spread across his bed as he thrust inside the Omega. He wanted to watch those silver eyes widen with pleasure and kiss his red cupid’s bow lips. Draco was small but curved in the hip and had a perfect ass that Harry couldn’t wait to feel. Harry realized his thoughts had distracted him and Draco had turned around.
Draco swooped to pick up Caleb, “you’re getting so big! The doctor is not going to hurt me and is there to help make sure we all stay healthy.”
“I know I am darling. Now let’s go find that mate of yours. I left him with your father and I assure you he is struggling with this as much as you are.” Draco nodded and squeezed his mother tight before letting go and turning back in the direction he left Pansy.
Harry jammed his hands into his hair and hung his head. “I’m saying, you have to go with your parents to the Fae lands for a few months.”
“Lucius?” The older blonde turned to look at his wife who had appeared. Narcissa looked lovely. Her tall, thin frame was clad in a long silver ball gown and her dark hair was swept up revealing her elegant neck.
Harry grabbed Draco’s small hand and brought it to his lips for a kiss. “Don’t shed any tears for my past, love. Your parents were right to keep us apart at that time. There is a chance my presentation could have triggered yours and that would have been traumatic for you. But, I appreciate the sentiment.”
Draco still hadn’t turned around and Pansy spoke up “Oh, hi there. No see, I dropped my earring and Draco was being a dear and helping me search for it.”
“Sign them Potter.” His husband’s musical voice had a hard edge to it. But, Harry had been drinking and he didn’t care if they had another fight. He wasn’t signing those papers.
Draco watched Harry’s face as he took in the flower pictures around the room and the waiting room full of pregnant men and women. Draco stifled a giggle at how uncomfortable Harry looked. Draco spotted two empty seats and headed over there with a reluctant Harry following.
“Draco, I know this might seem crazy and rash. Which, it probably is. But, I love you and I know you have a lot on your plate right now but you don’t have to do this alone. I want to be here for you and the baby.”
Harry nodded. “How gallant of you Oliver to offer to escort Draco to that appointment. You will however, no longer be needed as I will be taking him.”
Draco gave a weak laugh but stood up from the bed. “Go outside Pans, I’ll be right there.” Draco took one last look around the tent that he and his mate had spent a blissful week in. He then headed outside with a sigh. Pansy stood outside the tent wearing a long dress in her signature red. The curvy siren had a mating bond proudly displayed. Draco could see Pansy was mated to an Alpha vampire. Before he could ask her about her new mate she rushed forward and hugged him.
Harry reached a big hand up and stroked his face. His hand slipped around the back of Draco’s head and tangled in the blonde strands.
Harry placed a hand over Draco’s stomach and pictured it round with their child. He knew the chances of pregnancy were lower because Draco wasn’t in heat and he wasn’t in a rut but it was possible. Harry made a note to ask Draco when his next heat would be. Harry felt himself getting sleepy and sighed contentedly. He drifted off while inhaling Draco’s unique scent now combined with Harry’s.
Whatever Harry had been about to say was cut off by the happy shrieks of their daughters. “DADDY!” The twins yelled and ran up the walkway.
“Professor Hermione, it’s so good to see you. How are you feeling?” Hermione rubbed a hand on her belly while looking between Pansy and Draco.
Harry chuckled and grabbed a tissue from the console. Mark had respectfully put up the divider when he saw them kissing. Harry did pay the man to be discreet.
Draco turned around and placed his forearms on the bed. His bottom was in the air for his Alpha to see.
Draco didn’t even know how to respond. “Hey Harry, glad you’re finding yourself and all but guess what you knocked me up again and I thought you would like to know? Oh and maybe see the other two children you know exist.”
Harry laughed coldly. “I’m broken baby. I can only offer you one thing and that’s fucking. So if that’s what you want, take off your clothes and lets go. If not, you know where the door is.”
Draco sat in the living room with a hand resting on his belly. It had been two weeks since he and Harry had gone to the doctor’s appointment together. Harry had been on his best behavior and his most charming. But, Draco still didn’t know what to think. He hadn’t forgotten how cruel Harry was to him all those months ago. He didn’t know what had come over the brunette and also what changed and caused him to seek out Draco.
“Scared short stuff?” He taunted Draco. The small Omega didn’t back down and instead looked up at him and said “You’re not the big bad wolf you think you are Potter.”
Harry’s expression grew cold, “I still deserved to know. That child is mine Draco, and like it or not, you are too.”
Harry sighed. Pansy had done many things in the past five years to get Harry to reach out to Draco and their son. She took great pleasure in opposing him anytime they came into contact. Luckily, his business brought him all over the world. But, he had decided to build his club close to home.
“I am aware of how babies are made. But this child is also mine and we will not be some obligation to you. Some contract you have to fulfill.” Draco fought tears as he stared up at the face he still loved so much. His heart was pounding and he couldn’t believe that Harry was actually here. But he deserved better, his baby deserved better.
“Hello, Draco. What brings you to me this evening?” Harry walked over to the bar to pour himself another drink.
Draco looked down at Oliver confused where this was coming from. He gasped as Oliver pulled a ring box out of his pocket and opened it. Inside lay a beautiful silver band. Draco looked at Oliver with wide eyes and covered his mouth with his hand.
Draco took a deep breath and composed himself. It’s going to be fine, he thought. He opened the bathroom door and headed out.
“Enjoy dinner and feel free to get to know your fellow tablemates. We will choose our participants for the Dance of Celia after dessert.” Minerva ended with a wink and disappeared with a swish of her skirts.
“I know.” Draco signed and looked down at the oversized hockey jersey he was wearing. It was one of the few things Harry had left at Draco’s old apartment. When Draco had realized he was pregnant he had packed up all his things and moved into Pansy’s townhouse. She had been supportive and agreed Draco shouldn’t be alone during his pregnancy.
*************************************************************************************************************************
His mother chuckled. “Dear, that is how a lot of marriages function. But we both know you and Harry are more than that.”
The blonde’s eyes were closed in pleasure. Harry removed his hand from Draco’s throat and reached down to join the other hand on his butt. Harry lifted up the Omega and their cocks brushed each other. Harry walked forward until Draco’s back hit a tree. The Omega wrapped his legs around Harry and pushed his hips closer.
Minerva reappeared in front of everyone again, “Children, it is now time for Dance of Celia. Will my chosen Alpha Harry Potter and chosen Omega Draco Malfoy please come forward?”
