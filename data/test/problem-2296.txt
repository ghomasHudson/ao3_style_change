He barely looked at Harry and certainly didn't smile at him like that.
Harry crouched down, resting his back on the wall. “I need about two minutes before I can try again. Got to get my energy up, you know? And assuming you only got one dose of your dreaded allergen, you
In the years since, attendance had become streamlined, with tickets sold in tiers based on access to Harry. The money went towards his charity and a fund for current and future Hogwarts students in need of support. There was a meet-and-greet in a room off the back and a photoshoot for those who purchased top-tier tickets, which ran into the hundreds of Galleons.
“Predictable, perhaps, if I were a G—Gryffindor,” he stuttered. Hypothermia meant he had to be kept awake, and Harry was good at keeping watch. Sat on the floor, ready to stay as long as it took.
"No, stay as you are." He didn't look up when he asked, "Can you see yourself?"
Harry's eyes widened.
He pulled the shirt back down to fumble with its buttons, then removed his socks, then trousers and pants in one go. He crawled to the middle of Draco's bed, a size bigger than his mattress at home, and flipped onto his back, feet hanging loosely over the long edge. Draco watched him from an armchair in the corner of the room as he propped himself up on his elbows. He was half-hard, and his right hand went to his cock for a tug. A nervous tick to cover himself when he was naked. Draco was fuzzy in the dim light as the spell to correct his vision faded, but Harry could see he was smiling. A happy ghost with a crimson smile.
"Yeah. You were."
He wished he could swallow his words, but when he stole a glance, Draco had a wry smile on his face, the one canine catching at his lower lip. There, Harry could look there. What was so dangerous about looking at the face of the person you were speaking with?
"It's stupid, but I can't help it." Harry realized that he'd been staring, fork halfway to his mouth, and he hastily ate a bite, cheeks burning.
Draco worried his bottom lip.
Instead, he rolled the wood between his fingers before unleashing a complicated-looking set of flicks in the laundry's direction, face pinched. Harry couldn't believe how much the expression he wore reminded him of Hermione when she tried to bake.
Draco turned to him, eyes wide with disbelief. "I didn't ask you to fix it, and I certainly didn't
"What an incredibly compelling offer you make. Please give me a moment to collect my thoughts so I can keep from creaming myself that the magnificent
You warn him that you're going to come and he rears back to sit up straight and puts four fingers in his own mouth to scream cry around when the angle sinks him further than you've managed. You come inside him in a series of shuddering jerks, your entire body a wire made stiff from stimulation. Your neck cracks and you forget yourself completely. The world goes white.
"I—I am not obsessed with you. Gods, you are the most annoying—"
"I haven’t done this with anyone in a long time," he said, so quietly that Harry could barely hear him. He pulled his knees up to under his chin, curling into an ever-smaller shape. "Bottomed. I usually—usually I don’t like it."
Harry's fingers wandered. They pushed up the hem of his shirt and traced the ridges of his ribs, drawing gasps, and then lower. They dared at long last to trace the scars like ribbons, crisscrossing his stomach. He traced them with his tongue, occasionally squeezing at Draco's shaft and tugging at it, mixing all the sensations together. Where he was soft, or scratchy, or hard. Harry brushed his knuckles into the hollows next to his hipbones, and when the pad of a finger hooked into his navel, Draco hissed.
“How was it though? My heart? For Valentine’s too, I don’t know how to top it. Tell me—was it slippery? I know you like it wet.” His voice hoarse, a whisper. “Did your fingers—”
. The sheer number of hours required for research, for writing towards authorship in the journals—"
"Listen, Draco, I've just remembered—," Harry shifted awkwardly, but Draco reached out and touched his wrist. It sent waves from Harry's nerve endings directly to the place where the spine met brain. He was going to do something reckless if the touching continued.
He glanced up from the dregs of his cup to Malfoy, who was squinting at him again.
, Harry reminded himself for the umpteenth time.
"I don't."
"What's brought you to me on this bright, shiny day?" Harry turned his back to empty space beyond the building, resting his weight in his bent forearms, casual as he could pretend to be. He raised an eyebrow at Ron, who refused to look directly at him. Instead, he unwrapped something from a bit of wax paper and popped it into his mouth.
, Harry?”
"Potter here returned a pair of mine this summer when I misplaced them. I'm trying an experimental potion on his to see if it solves a problem. Tired eyes. Absolutely
Draco shoved back at last, lips thick and wet and pink, lust clear in every panted breath. He didn't say anything before he reared up and grabbed Harry by his left hip, right hand lining his cock up with Harry's entrance. He rubbed the head against that soft place, entranced. He liked to watch as he entered Harry, and Harry liked that he knew this about him.
"It's not
Malfoy slanted a look at him that was pure spite. "I don't need to be saved, Potter."
“How would I know that?” he asked dumbly. Draco wished he felt like he’d won something when a tear dropped from Harry’s eyes and not his own, but all he felt was the loss of something beautiful. Something imperfect ruined. The kind of break no spell could fix up, and no amount of cleaning could make him forget.
"That's up for negotiation," Draco continued. "You can say
"No?" Draco said. "Are you sure?"
At last, he dried and dressed in modest Muggle clothing, finishing his route with a visit to the kitchen.
"Like this?" Harry pulled nearly completely out and slammed back in, and Draco shouted in a way that would wake the neighbours if the poor Muggle dears could hear anything through the wards.
"Want your cock in my mouth," Harry said, moving from sitting on his heels to standing on his knees. He gave his widest doe-eyes as he slid his hands up the outsides of Cissy's thighs, passing over the stockings to warm skin, high enough to hook thumbs into the waistband and tug the skimpy underwear down to her knees.
"Only minor?" he asked.
"Will someone
"Of course not. You do, though."
"I dare you," Ron spoke slowly, eyes sweeping from Dean over the patch of lush grass of the meadow tucked behind the Burrow, and all the lounging bodies of their assembled friends, "to find the bottom of Seamus' bellybutton with your tongue."
"We wouldn't be in this situation if you could control yourself. Weren't you in training to be an Auror? You're not twelve anymore, Potter. Don't you ever think?"
on the radio, and had Harry buy the record, and the next thing Harry knew, he'd altered a charm so he could listen to it on repeat, so loudly that there wasn't room for any other conversation. This happened daily.
"My burn."
"Fancy giving a bloke a break?" Harry said, and Draco snorted into his chest, his body hanging limp, dead weight. The gloss he'd so carefully applied earlier had melded with his sweat, and sparkles blinked from every sharp, damp point on his face when he looked down at Harry, nose to nose.
Malfoy's flat smelled of burnt toast.
"Close your eyes for me," he said, his voice low but demanding, and Harry did as he was told. He raised his hands above his head and gripped at the blanket, bunching it in his hands as Draco rose up over him on all fours, one hand snaking down his belly until it met with his shaft, rapidly stiffening under his touch.
“It’s unfair that you’re so good looking,” sighed Alex when he’d made Harry do a spin. “Now, look up. A little mascara wouldn’t hurt on those peepers.”
"Yes, well. I do try to maintain some decorum when I'm out having a night with the lads." There was a dark edge to Justin's tone, and he flicked a look over to Harry for a moment.
"I'd get into a screaming match with them most days, but right now, who has the energy?"
"My aunt and uncle saw me as both a burden and an obstacle. They didn’t want me to assimilate—they wanted me to disappear. So I prepared food that I couldn’t touch, and I was given the excess, if there was any, out of what they could pretend was overzealous penny-pinching. They hadn't planned on having a second mouth to feed, so they decided not to feed it. But they withheld meals out of cruelty on top of that. It was an acceptable way for them to show their anger with me, I think— they didn’t see it as abuse. I didn’t either—it wasn’t the kind that showed too obviously."
"What?" she said serenely. "We're cousins," she said.
"I will pay you back, Potter," he added with finality.
Ron coughed into his closed fist. It sounded wet and nasty, and Harry should ask him how he was doing, but it was like the sensitive, feeling parts inside him had shrivelled up to something too small to care. He waited in the painful sound until it stopped, and Ron could continue to speak, eyes watering dangerously.
Draco bit his lips, staring at his lap. Thinking, thinking.
“Why?”
Harry poked the parchment.
This was more like it. It was easier when it was all breath and tongue and teeth. In the dark, up close with no room for words and no space to see. Harry didn't want to have to use his words.
"You really missed me that much, pet?"
"That's good that you're aware of what they are. So many wizards—well, no need to get into that. Intracerebral haemorrhage is the technical term. A bleed in the brain. In Muggles, it would be much more serious, but as you're young and have a strong magical core, we expect to see a wonderful recovery. You'll notice its immediate effects in the loss of certain words. Healer trainee Bell was in earlier, and she noted that nouns were a trouble area."
"He seems a bit tired," Harry hedged, wondering where this tack of conversation was going.
"Friends with benefits, you mean?"
"Let's get you all cleaned up for your prince charming, then."
Though he entered the trip with the best of intentions, assuming it would be a week before he learned how to wind down and take it easy, Harry couldn't believe how easy it actually was to do so. Three days in he woke up and poked Draco in the shoulder.
"Lastly, Harry would have called me a knob for doing this if he'd known at the time, and he'd have been right to," Draco turned to look at him again and Harry grinned, heart swelling in his chest. Draco finally cracked a nervous smile before looking to the little bag in his hands and tugging it open, pulling a cylindrical bottle of brown glass from it.
"Exactly." Justin cocked his head, blue eyes glinting in the low light. "What’s the Saviour got to do with those unsavoury types?"
“Is it awful?”
"Tell him to fuck off; I’m in charge of your disaster now. Though, it is a touch too long in the back," Draco added, leaning and narrowing his eyes at the offending length curling over Harry’s collar.
Teddy's stopped at the door, hair once again glowing the pink reminiscent of Draco's earlier phase, and Harry's eyes flooded unbidden.
"Please, Daddy," Harry said, louder, though his voice shook, “fuck me.” The words made Draco's eyes flutter shut. His nostrils flared, a huff of hot breath before he thrust savagely into Harry.
"The normal amount," he says.
He dropped his chin low and looked up at Harry, his best impression of a sultry glare. He swaddled the empty bottle tightly to his chest, fingertips sweeping at a collarbone through the fabric of his shirt. "Was I good, Harry? If I never sucked your cock again, would it make you happy to know that you got me where I am?"
"Where are we?" Harry asked. He selected a sandwich and placed it on the side.
His cheeks burned as a sliver of memory bubbled up. Of noticing a mischievous smile beneath a silver mask. Of thin wrists and surprisingly strong hands; of a lithe body pressing, damp with perspiration against his own. Of a mouth grazing his neck, something so close to a kiss at his pulse point. A jolt flared in Harry's belly, sending a very confusing shot of blood directly to his cock.
And as much as a shit he'd been to Harry, he needed a steady, helpful hand at that moment. They could do the hashing out later.
I nod and sigh “its honestly hard to believe we've managed to grow this much in a year's time.” Malfoy clenches his jaw “right well I imagine this past year required a lot of growing up on both of our parts.” with this he turns to glare out the window. “we shouldn't have had to though. None of us should have had to go through that.” I say the words barely more than a whisper.
~~~~~~~
I grin back at him “well. That was quite a bit easier than I thought it would be. I’ve only ever told Zabini and Parkin. Though I think they already knew.” Harry snorts “what, did they catch you snogging a picture of professor Lockhart or something. everyone was batty over him.” My shoulders shake with laughter “more like or something. I couldn’t stand him.” Harry doesn’t question me further about it and soon dinner ends with everyone making their way stumbling sleepily to their dorms.
"I won't pull away not unless you want me too, not until you're ready." I tell him. Draco nods closes his eyes and his body relax slightly. I can feel his minty breath on my skin where his mouth sits just slightly ajar. He pants, taking uneven breaths. "Follow my breathing." I tell him making him meet my eyes again. "That's it." I tell him as he matches our rhythms. Slowly he calms down and I start to release my grip on his head when he lets go of my wrists only to lay his hands over top of my own.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Oi, Malfoy. I heard Harry whooped your arse earlier.” shocked, I lean back and shrug. “apparently, it's all about how you ride, isn't Harry.” Ron catches on to the double meaning before Hermione. Gasping and sputtering, he puts fingers in his ear, humming loudly, and says, “I didn't need to know that!” Hermione, on the other hand, raises an eyebrow as if she couldn't care less about our convo side from the fact that Ron and I spoke at all. The rest of dinner passes by in a blur and I'm stuck wondering if this would have been my days at Hogwarts had I not been such a snot our first day.
“I never knew you to be so witty.” I tell him seriously. Harry nods "I would say more sarcastic really.” With a shrug. Last night keeps playing over in my mind. I need to tell Harry that I’m gay. I know I do. I just don’t know how to broach the subject. “Harry,” I push on through my nerves. “About last night...” I drag on.
Many students gasp backing away at the first sight of the decayed creatures. I notice only two farmilar people not shying away from the beasts. The first is Luna Lovegood. She was the one who informed me I had in fact not gone insane the first time I saw them as she can see them too. One can only lay eyes on these winged creatures who have not seen death.
Blaise and Pansey would have quite literally ruined their robes had they been in that carriage with Potter and I. Hell frankly, I should have. I should have cursed and spit hateful words at him. I should have told him to find another carriage. I should have told him he could walk for all I cared, but I didn't. I couldn't say those things. Instead I actually chuckled and spoke to him without sneering. I know I just wanted to finish my schooling and not bother with petty squabbles, but this has me feeling a bit light-headed.
Granger starts and looks at me on the other side of Potter, "hey, Malfoy. I was wondering that as well." I attempt to give her a small smile though it's forced. I see Potter and Granger share a look. "I hope there are several shelves to hold my books."
over the trolley. I don't give an inch staring at him as hard as he is at me. Finally he glances down and I cannot fight my smirk of triumph.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sighing, I step back to let him leave. Quietly we make our way to the dining hall and sit quickly, shoving food in our mouths. I forgot how hungry Quidditch makes me. I see Harry talking to Weasley, and I glance at Granger. “do you have the work from arithmancy, Granger?” she beams at me and gives Harry and Weasley a pointed look before looking back to me’ “I took the liberty of getting your work for you actually. I hope you don't mind. I'll get it to you after dinner.”
"Professor Mcgonagall as Head Mistress, " the unfamiliar voice of a slytherin a few seats down meets my ears. "who would you rather have had take dumbledores position, please enlightened me?" I hiss effectively shutting down his complaint.
With almost no embarrassment this time I breath a small laugh "No, I would in fact like to stay in this bed all day." Harry's chuckle rumbles in my ear. "I would like that very much, but I am fairly certain Hermione would have my head if I miss class."  Sighing I nod my agreement. Pulling myself up I smile "I have not slept that well in a while." I tell him as I stand up and march for the bathroom. Harry smiles full and bright "I am glad." His smile falters a fraction. "I haven't been sleeping well either. Though I'm sure you already knew that from the night before.
I gently put my hand on his shoulder. "Hey, Draco, it's only a nightmare. It isn't real." I tell him and brush a hand over his head pushing his hair off of his damp forehead. His fighting only intensifies and it's clear he is doing just that. He is fighting some unseeable force. "DRACO," I yell this time to be heard over his own screams. He flips onto his back pinning himself to the bed. I take is face in my hands. Suddenly his slim fingers wrap around my wrists. He is begging me to spare his families lives.
Harry nods listening attentively unembarrassed of
I glance in Malfoy's direction before flipping it over writing in my own quick text and returning it to sender.
I glance at the clock to see there are only 2 minutes left of class. Storing my things away a make for the dining hall. Harry is already sitting with Ron and Hermione when I enter. I take my seat beside him “your mightiness?” I enquire quietly as Hermione and Ron chatter. Harry’s answering smirk sends my heart racing. Theirs a new look in his eyes. A sparkle that wasn’t there before. “What, to much, your highness?”
"I'm sorry, but Malfoy and I are needed due to Quidditch matters, professor. Do you mind letting him go a bit early? I wouldn't ask if I didn't need to." professor Vector glances a Draco, no doubt trying to see if something is a miss before hesitantly nodding, "just make sure you make up the work, Mr.Malfoy."
"where are the rest of the family?" Ron shrugs indifferent "gone to make sure Ginny gets a good spot on the train." raising an eyebrow Harry noticed the train had not actually arrived yet but didnt bother to mention this to Ron. Harry doesn't blame them for keeping their distance after his break up with Ginny.
I nod, looking at her across from Potter. "I have an extensive library myself, so I truly hope they do." Potter gives me a sideways glance as Granger looks at me wide-eyed "I'm sorry, I didn't peg you as someone who reads a lot. That's wonderful, though. I think Ron and Harry need to read more." Potter bangs his head, and his raven locks shake as he laughs. "Mione, Ron, and I read what we need to. You just read more."
Harry shakes his head. "No, it's not that. I just always stayed in Gryffindor. For most of my life, it was my truest home. It's just a little disappointing that I won't get to stay there this one last time." he answers honestly. The sincerity, in his words, leaves me slightly shaken. "I know what you mean. I may have had a large House, but the Slytherin common room was my home." Harry looks at me as if he is seeing me for the first time. He smiles and turns to me, offering his hand "I'm Harry Potter, it's nice to meet you, and you are?" He grins at me.
Harry felt the lie slip from him tongue "of course Hermione." It's not that he wouldn't want to tell them so much as he wouldn't know how to talk to another witch apart from Hermione and of course Ginny. “I was actually...” Harry hesitates “wondering if Malfoy would be returning.” he voices turn to look down walk tying to avoid the unbelieving looks coming from their direction.
Harry grabs my wrist and I feel my face warming “Draco, you had less choice than even myself. I saw that while standing in your house as you lied to save me time even though you had none yourself. I testified for you because you were lowering your wand that night on the astronomy tower.” Harry tells me, looking me in the eyes, still holding my wrist so close to the mark I hate and will never be able to take off.
Ron coughs, "what did you just say, mate, your friends with Malfoy, what do you wanna be friends with that slimy git for?" I pat Ron's shoulder, "he is different, Ron more subdued, not so easy to anger, I think you guys could even be friends with time." Ron is not okay with that as he mumbles fowl words under his breath about Malfoy and friends and walks away.
Slowly and quietly, I slip from his arms and stand up, grabbing my glasses off the nightstand. Standing now, I cannot help but look him over. When else will I have time to just look at him to take in his features. His hair has fuzzed up from sleep, and his face is so relaxed. He almost has a smile on his pink lips. I'm not mad about waking up in his arms; I'm only shocked. Grabbing my robes, I make my way to the bathroom to get ready for classes.
“Malfoy, ” Potter calls to me. “Im-Im glad you came back this year.” and with that odd comment he turn back and slides the door closed leaving me standing completely dumbstruck. did potter just say he was glad to see me?
There is a lot of murmuring from the 8th year's as questions begin to come from all sides.
Folding the parchment and shoving it in my pocket, I lean forward, so I'm just over his shoulder, and you can probably hear the grin spreading across my face as I whisper back, “i can more than back my words up Harry, you are so on.”
Draco plays his part very well. With confusion written all over his face, he stands, grabbing his things and making for the door where I wait.
"It looks as if he has done this before. Surely he can afford new robes for himself. He doesn't seem the time to reuse his old one does he?" Hermione questions. "He has the dark mark. It's likely he hasn't been able to find anyone to let him into their store much less to sell him quality robes." I surmise. Hermione nods her agreement.
The second is Draco Malfoy. He lingers near the closest animal and gently rubs it's skeletal head. With a light hand he brushes his fingers over what could have been it's jaw. I notice his shoulders tense slightly. Without turning Malfoy swiftly lifts himself into the carriage. Before I give myself the chance to better think on my decision I mumble an excuse to my friends and tell them to go on ahead in an already waiting carriage.
I'm startled from my thoughts as a small parchment plane clips the side of my head and lands beside my plate. Ron and Hermione are sitting across from each other in a heated debate about something or other. Opening the plane I read the note written in nest lines.
I see Potter read the note and look in my direction before shrugging as if to say what can you do, and mouthing what appears to be "sorry, mate." nodding my thanks Potter begins to write a reply when Mcgonagall announces the end of dinner and he never gets the chance to finish.
The plane lands nearly in my plate before I catch it and flip it to the side potter wrote his reply on.
~~~~~~~
“hold still." I grab his shoulders. “I'll go first, then you follow after.” In the dim light, nobody has to know how much room I have behind me or the fact that honestly, I could step back at any time. I just like the feel of his body pressed up against mine. I don't step back straight away, but look down at the small boy, and the blush creeping up his face again.
Laughing, I glance over my should at him from the wardrobe. That's sad, Harry, now when you lose, you won't have the Captin to blame." I tease him. Harry barks a laugh "you wish Draco, just you wait and see." The laughter that escapes me is free and full of light. "I think I'm finally done packing. I'm exhausted. I think I'm going to turn in." I mumble, yawning. Harry nods "yea, I am too. This day has been two days long."
"I don't think I've been more sure of anything in my life, Harry." and I walk ahead of him, leading the way to the great hall.
I have a secret. A secret I usually never let myself think during the day and sometimes during the night, but in a night like this it is pulled to the front of my mind unbidden. I'm hopeless in love with Harry Potter. I try to deny it I tell myself I should sneer and say hateful things. I should want to fight him and get him in trouble, but I don't want to do any of those things.
The sorting hat has just finished it's duties and is being taken back to its place in the headmistress's office when head mistress mcgonagall speaks. "I am glad to see so many of you have came, and returned this year. We have rebuilt much of the corridors that were damaged. The only wing yet to be repaired is the east wing on the 6th floor. I have for this reason blocked that particular path off and students are not to venture into the wing."
"You are safe. Nobody is going to do anything. Please wake up." I tell him. My grip on his head is firm. My fingers are in his hair and his small ears sit between my fingers. It feels to intimate to be holding him like this but in the moment I cannot spare any guilt. I pull our faces together until they're inches apart, our foreheads touching. He is breathing heavy but he is not screaming anymore. My eyes drift to his lips and I cannot help but stare at their supple red form. I lift my eyes to his face. His frightened pale blue orbs stare unflinching into my own. I release a relieved breath I hadn't realized I had been holding.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
With my hand on the bathroom door handle I turn to Harry giving him a fractured smile. "Maybe that's why are able to help each other with our nightmares. We're both a little messed up right now." Harry chuckles and runs a hand through his hair tousling his onyx strands. I step into the bathroom to reluctantly get ready for class.
"Im sure I've gone completely mental. That has to be the only explanation." Ron says mouth gapping between words. "what other reason could there be for me to have heard what I think I just heard!" Hermione sighs shaking her head. "Ronald, honestly it wasn't that horrible. Maybe he wouldn't have been so cruel had Harry not denied his offer of friendship on your behalf to begin with."
Potter thinks on this tapping his finger on a full bottom lip. I release a breath I hadn't realised I was holding. I lift my eyes from his mouth to the rest of his profile. It's not that I ever had time to openly study his features before, but I am suddenly acutely aware of his side profile from my angle beside him, from his brow, to his nose, to the point of his chin. The hair close to falling into his eyes is black as a ravens feathers. The bow of his lips, the slope of his neck are smooth and angular.
I turn off the shower reaching for the closest towel to wrap around my hips and step out. I nearly have a heart attack to find Harry also standing in bathroom lazily brushing his teeth. "I hope you don't mind I heard you turn the shower on and thought I was safe." Lifting the hand I threw to my chest I laugh "you only nearly scared me to death," I come to stand beside him to brush my own teeth. "I thought it was moaning myrtles job to haunt bathrooms." Harry barks a laugh at that and grins at me through his mirror. "Not this bathroom. At least I hope not."
I wake up from fevered dreams of Harry and I that I do not soon want to forget. I think about pulling the dream from my mind to revisit later but decide not to. Something like that can only be lived once.
"All 8th years if you would please stay behind a moment."
Without windows in our room, the complete darkness makes my eyes grow heavy now that I've calmed down, and before I know it, I've succumbed to sleep with the chosen one, Harry Potter, the love of my life in my arms, and I'm terrified I'm going to regret this in the morning.
“Im sorry. What?” I look at him wide eyed “it will take more than friendly convo’s in the great hall to be my friend potter,” I tell him simply “you will have to try harder than that.” But the smile never leaves his face “oh I know, Malfoy. I know.” Sighing I turn in my seat as McGonagall clears her throat. “If you would all follow me please I will show you to your new common room.”
Scoffing Ron shakes his head rubbing his eyes. "you told him you were glad he had come back this year, I know, you must be the mental one Harry." Ron chuckles.
"well, at least we will be able to bounce our work off one another, eh?" I smirk at her. Granger nods enthusiastically and takes Weasley's hand, telling Harry bye and Heading down to breakfast. "well, let's go get some breakfast." I look at Harry and smirk, "are you always this bossy with your friends, Harry." his answering smirk sends shock waves through my body "you have yet to see how I treat my friends, Draco, sure you can handle it?"
Hermione has already changed into her robes, so Ron and I make our way to the changing rooms to our own robes on, mine just a bit too short. Shrugging I leave my stall and reluctantly look in the mirror accessing my appearance. Dull green eyes stare back at me hooded with barely veiled exhaustion. I need to do a better job of looking okay in front of the others.
I cannot seem to fall asleep. The days events keep replaying in my mind. Instantly my heart starts to race and I glance beside me to the blonde laying in the bed beside mine fast asleep. Draco grumbles in his sleep and throws the cover off of his shoulders. I can see a thin sheen of sweat on his exposed collar bone. Draco whimpers. He tosses around in bed. He starts to yell. I quickly cast a silencing charm on our room to keep the others from hearing. I don't think this is something he would want the others to know about. Even in sleep he is doing his best to muffle his screams.
“you shouldn't have had to go through that on your own, none of us should have.” I tell the side of his head fiercely. Malfoy refuses to look me in the eye now but I see him nod almost almost to little of one to notice but I saw it. I do not push him further as we make the last leg of the ride to the castle. The silence is not a hostile one but a somber sorrowful one.
I'm pulled from my thoughts as he turns his face my way fully and I have to take a breath to keep my face from visibly reddening. Why would I be studying his face? It dosen't matter I tell myself as Potter finally speaks. "you know you may be right. mcGonagall always wondered I think why we weren't friends."  I feel my rigid posture relax slightly. How is it so easy to talk to this boy who was my sworn enemy all through school? "Ah, Potter Granger is not the only one who is top of her class, and if I am correct I offered to be your friend in first year, but you declined."
Harry comes around to the other side of the snitch facing me. He is concentrating on trying to get the snitch before I do. He is close enough that I can see him subconsciously biting his lip as he goes through his options. My blood sings at the way he looks right now with his hair windblown biting his lip with a blush still covering his cheeks from the chill in the air. He looks as if he has been thrown out into a storm. Or like maybe he was up to something a little more...intimate.
His words play through my head a second time. His voice so quiet and yet firm is the same as it always was if a bit deeper. The one noticeable difference is the lack of malice in his tone. Ron steps out of his stall mouth once again hanging to the floor. A breathy laugh escapes me before Ron can utter a single syllable. "come on Ron let's get back to Hermione."
As we leave our room, Harry is rushed by Granger and Weasley. "let me see your schedule, Ron, and I have quite a few together." but her face soon falls, "ah well, that's too bad, Harry, we only have potions together." then she turns to me "good morning Draco. What classes do you have?" suppressing a smile I hand her mine. "we have potions and arithmancy. I thought I was likely the only one taking that class in our year nobody's mentioned it." she says, chuckling.
Lovely Readers -
a member of our crazy bunch anyway, right? No, what got me thinking was the way you and Ginny behaved. You seemed such good friends but… there wasn’t much passion going on, right? Don’t get me wrong, I think it is very important to be good friends with one’s partner, but such a young couple should be more than that – and you were not, right?”
What Kreacher likes best is doing his duty! And Kreacher’s duty is to look after Master Harry Potter and Master’s house! Simple!”
Flitwick seemed undecided. “Well, Ms Silver, this is a question of respecting another artist’s work… I don’t want to be as intrusive as this one,” he pointed at Taurus’ picture, “but on the other hand, as you said, your painting has been violated before.”
After tedious repetitions Professor Flitwick finally got the class’ full attention when he said, “As I have promised you, we will also work on your Halloween costumes during the next few lessons. It will give us an excellent opportunity to explore the fine line between Charms and Transfiguration. Both subjects include spells which can change looks in a distinct way. Can anyone define the significant difference between these subjects concerning appearances?”
“For all I care,” Harry gave in. “But... there’s a lot of other stuff I need to do – catch up on missed lessons, get back in shape. So – let’s do it right now and get it over with quickly, okay? Just give me a minute and then I’ll see you – where exactly?”
Harry felt as if Ginny had dropped a bomb. His friends were staring at him. Ron looked as if hit by a truck. Hermione seemed surprised, while having a light bulb moment at the same time – in fact her expression was oddly familiar from watching her solving arithmancy problems.
, Harry thought.
Harry watched the others take their copies first. It was quite fascinating. As soon as someone’s spell hit the board, a transparent silvery surface seemed to be lifted from the board and dived into their wand. He was the last one to try it and his wand hand prickled when the copy entered his wand.
“But that’s impossible!” Harry shouted unable to hold back any longer. “My relatives didn’t want me to go to Hogwarts either, but Dumbledore simply overruled them! He sent owl after owl and finally Hagrid came to fetch me!”
(See the end of the chapter for
O’Malley leaned against the door behind him. “I don’t know much anyway … it’s just … Gregory Laddley has been terribly guilt ridden and not only about his homophobic attack on a student. In our last session he hinted at being involved in some crime without giving me any details. We talked about the burden of guilt and what a relief it is to own up to what one has done. I believed him to be on the verge of confession.” He shook his head. “Too much of a coincidence that he broke down a few hours later.”
“Speak for yourself,” said Draco between gritted teeth.
Narcissa Malfoy stopped abruptly and looked at his face with curiosity. “You are very observant indeed, Mr Potter,” she drew a deep breath and said, “This is exactly what I want to talk about. The story of Cassiopeia’s childhood is a very unpleasant one and I feel I have failed her – she is my god-child, you see. But I want to do better now.”
Hermione turned slightly pink and said, “Well – all is fair in love and war, right? The war is over now. But if we don’t abide by law in times of peace we are heading towards anarchy.”
“Harry,” she had said, “you are a good person, I would trust you with my life – come to think of it, I already did – and you’re really handsome in your ruffled sort of way, but… I think I rather prefer dating someone, who does not feel like yet another brother to me. I’m just glad you feel the same.”
“Your uncle is supposed to be out of the country and the Ministry is on his heels anyway, I think we can’t do much about this line of enquiry… but tell me about Laddley.”
“You want to tell me something? Hm… let me guess... Flitwick needs to see me?”
Harry sighed, hardly listening to Ginny’s and Hermione’s arguing any more. They had been through this discussion during every meal all week. He zoomed out. His thoughts travelled to Draco as they so often did.
“Why don’t you talk to Flitwick himself?” Harry suggested.
“I see you reserve the nappy change for pudding,” Andromeda grinned picking up her spoon as well. “But do not hope I will forget it’s your turn to do it.”
“No, Harry. No you don’t, believe me. I am your worst idea ever.” Draco got up and left without another look at Harry.
Ron seemed only a little bit embarrassed, but mostly delighted by his friend’s praise of his mother. “I have to admit the old girl is doing quite well.” He turned to Harry. “I guess, we can swap seats again next lesson.” He had asked Harry to switch places during D.A.D.A. lessons and Harry had gladly agreed. Sitting next to Hermione up front was far better than the constant reminder of Draco’s absence by staring at the empty chair next to Blaise.
“Of course I won’t! I’m immensely grateful for her help, and as Josh Jordan was witness of the events, it can’t be all that bad anyway,” said Harry to reassure Cass. “I would just like to understand how this works, the hexed painting I mean.”
“Yeah,” Harry said, “you obviously had no idea that I’m gay too. Tell you what, neither did I until recently. And it doesn’t make me another person, you know? I’m still the same.”
Harry thought,
“You’re nothing but a mediocre artist!” Harry added with a smirk. “Poor taste, not much talent.”
“Oh that’s fine – just call me Harry,” he grinned back.
McGonagall sighed, “Headmaster Black, please calm down. We need to focus and we need to keep our minds clear. Hysterics are never helpful. I promise, we will get to the bottom of this unpleasant affair. I am not even sure, Amanda and Serena are missing, they might just be a little late and return with important evidence.”
On the landing halfway up the stairs Ms Malfoy stopped and opened her bag.
“You’ve come!” Draco whispered. “It’s been nearly a month… I’ve started to fear I might never see you again, Mr Potter!”
Harry moaned. What was he supposed to do now? His stomach rumbled. It was probably dinner time already. Should he walk over to the great hall, sit at his usual place and pretend nothing unusual had happened? What would his friends have to say about it? And most importantly – would Draco show up for dinner or rather skip another meal? Harry sighed – once again he had to find out by carrying on. He got up and left the class-room.
But Harry’s mind was occupied by the Imagic issue. Of course Draco was totally clueless about the suspicions threatening him and as much as Harry longed to warn him off, naturally that was out of the question. In fact Draco seemed to have a really good time at the party, his mood had improved significantly since dinner. As Cass was the most sought-after dance partner for girls and boys alike, Draco danced with Ginny nearly all evening, at least as long as Harry stayed at the party. He retreated early and went to bed in a foul mood.
“Juice please,” Harry said taking a seat. “I admire your patience, Professor!”
Harry grinned. “Anyway – I’ll save two seats for you at the train. If Malfoy– Draco is willing to sit with us, both of you are welcome. But talking him into it might be hard work.”
“Whoa! That can’t be a coincidence! And nobody at the damn Ministry cared about that?” Harry was appalled.
Another drawn curtain. Harry hesitated for a second before he carefully moved the heavy fabric aside –
“Of course you will! I’ll wait for you in our…” Ron coughed, “in my room.”
“I’ll keep that in mind,” Harry said, “if you’ll excuse me… bathroom.” He nodded and turned to leave.
These chapters may have more Draco or more Harry depending on the the the part of the plot your in thanks for reading!
I raise a brow “ohhh, think your funny do ya?” Harry looks me in the eyes “I don’t think so I know so.” And I can’t stop the gasp of laughter “well you got me there.” Harry bows his head modestly “thank you. It is a burden I am glad to carry.” I lean back and gaze at him for a moment. His hair is all over the place but somehow in just the right places to look messy but not unkempt and his robes are in a better state. He seems like he is doing better than the first time I saw him on the train.
As the rest of the school leaves to head to their houses the rest of the 8th year's glance from their places at the new head mistress.
I know he can probably feel my whole body shaking because he holds the embrace just a little bit tighter, and then we pull away. Shortly after, we're let into class, and I find myself taking the seat just behind him. Harry has the parchment he never got to reply on flat on his desk, scribbling away. Once he has finished, he passes back quickly for me to read.
I disappearate the note to Harry and wait impatiently for his reply which comes back in only moments.
Harry looks at me, eyes red. "I'm sorry you had to go through that. Do you talk to anybody about them?" I wish I could tell him I do, but since the war, I haven't had anyone to talk to about them. "like I said, even just to say it out loud to yourself helps." shrugging, I force a smile "so. What class do you have first?"
Oddly I feel my face warm. Entertain him? How can I do that? Thinking for a moment, I come up with an idea. It takes several minutes to find the arithmancy room. Once I look through the window into the room, I see Draco bleary-eyed but trying to focus. I take a second to construct my thoughts before I politely knock and open the door.
My heart noticeably falters in my chest as McGonagall calls "Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter." I stare straight ahead for a second. My ears ringing. Gathering my thoughts I stand attempting indifference and make my way to the table. I sit in the next available seat beside Neville Longbottom. I still remember hearing about how Neville was the one who killed Voldemort's snake Nagini. I can't help but look at him in a different light. I guess that's why he was put in Gryffindor.
Unable to stand it any longer I slip from bed and come to his side.
Once we make it outside, Harry and I both sprint down to the Quidditch pitch, and the broom shed. Harry pulls his broom out, checking the quills for damage or splitting before throwing a leg over the shaft.
With a grateful look, I nod my thanks and continue eating my fill. I cannot remember the last time I ate a full dinner was. Harry gives Weasley a scolding look I've never seen before and do not want to be on the receiving end of. Weasleg groans in defeat nods at Harry and looks at me. It's quite comical seeing Harry try to get Weasley and me to talk civilly.
I am feeling considerable no good about this hair brained idea they have come up with and I am already dressing whoni will have to share a room with. The worst I can imagine is being roomed with weasel-bee. Mcgonagall stands and begins to recite the names off of the list. Granger and Pansey are to room together, Blaize and Ron, and several others are paired up in no particular order.
Draco leads the way to the great hall, and we both head in the direction of our new table. Draco stands at the end of the table like he is unsure of where to sit. Malfoys and their reputations shaking my head, I call to him, "oi, Malfoy, take a seat, would ya, ?" I pull out the chair next me and Draco does a good job of sneering before he takes the seat.
Sometime in the night I’m woken by the sound of gasping and sobbing. I’m used to the sound of nightmares. I have my own almost daily, so I know one when I hear one. Harry’s thrashing in bed. Whatever he is dreaming about has him very distraught. I jump out of bed as Harry starts to scream and run to his bed. “Harry, hey, it's only a dream.” I try to tell him. I touch his shoulder, and he swimmers, but he quiets down. I lift my hand and brush his hair away from his forehead. My hand shakes slightly. How many times have I imagined what it would be like to run my fingers through these soft strands? Harry chokes on a sob again, and I cup his cheek. “Harry, mate, it's only a nightmare,” mumbling. Harry opens his eyes, but I can tell he is mostly still asleep. He likely won't remember this tomorrow.
Harry's shoulders relax as he tells me he has Transfiguration first. I do as well, and when we compare our schedules, it would seem we have all but one class together. Harry has a free period, and I took arithmancy. I gather my books for class.
"What happened between us wasn't usual, alright?" His tone was defensive, but he couldn't mend that. "He had a bit of an—er—like a break," Harry said, and then stopped himself. What was there to say?
Harry smiled, shrugging out of his sodden wool coat to drape over the back of the visitor's chair.
"Who would have thought that I'd be in charge of Harry Potter's Big Gay Adventure," Draco quipped when they arrived at Shinjuku Ni-Chome. The rainbow flags hung from doorways and windows loudly announced that they'd found their intended destination. Harry was dizzy from choice by the time they made it past all the cramped bars and restaurants to find the specific izakaya in a sub-basement that Luna had raved about.
"I haven't a clue what you're talking about. Why were you at Mr. Sparks' office?"
"But this—us. This we keep secret, yeah?" Harry glanced up at Draco. He responded with a nod.
"Naturally."
"In this instance," Draco said, "Largely, yes. They are. I haven't denied the stories of my behaviour directly following the postwar trials in the press, and I won't here, either."
Harry hummed his agreement. "Not like bruises, and I had enough of those thanks to Dudley and the other kids. I think," he said, staring into the crackling fire, "I think that they thought they could get around me existing if they tried hard enough."
"—you'll remove my bollocks from my body should I ever break his heart?" Harry finished the sentence as Blaise turned to him, a dazzlingly white, toothy grin expanding across his face.
“You did, you did! I couldn’t ask real you, because you were at work, but I asked my book, because you’re brill at gifts, and book-you told me.”
Draco swallowed nervously. A floorboard creaked down the hall, but he didn't waver, never taking his eyes off of the pair before him.
on Nova’s broomsticks?"
His eyes flutter closed at the low whine from the other room. Nearly a growl. He presses the heel of his palm firmly into the root of his cock, thickening already, and takes a deep breath.
He dropped his head to the comforter, made himself relax into it. Shoulders first, then the tension in his hips, his thighs. Reflected above was the vision of Draco doubled over like a frog, his head a crown of white and when Harry looked closely he could align the moment he saw Draco's pointed, pink tongue reaching out to lick curiously at Harry's hole and then Harry couldn't see that detail but he could
It was strange, then, when Harry found the programme and settled into the couch cushions, that Draco's eyes didn't move from him over to the screen. He stared, openly, far too obviously. Harry met his eyes, spoon halfway to his mouth, a ball of worry starting to form inside him.
Malfoy smirked. The smirk softened, widened, until he was smiling at Harry, even. In the insanity of it all, Harry distinctly thought that there was something about Malfoy when he smiled. Something sweet.
Grimmauld, in a word, looked marvellous. More than looking it, it
They both stood staring, Mrs Weasley's hands clasped tightly together, but no warm words of welcome came from her. Harry turned to watch the couple watching Draco, and felt not unlike a tennis match was about to begin. He opened his mouth to intervene in some way, but Draco held up a hand to silence him.
"Can we continue?" Ron asked. She waved a hand, and Ron gave Harry a nod.
keeps me worrying, you prat. It’s what I do best."
"Piece of work, isn't she, your mother?" She spoke over Teddy's head to Draco. He daintily took a tiny bite of cake—he'd been eating it at half-speed, Harry watching as he chewed each mouthful until it must have totally disintegrated—and took the opportunity to put down his fork and daub at his lips with his napkin.
"How do you know it's okay
Andromeda piped up from where she leaned against the wall down the hall, wearing a smirk that Harry recognized as an inheritable Black family trait.
, huh," Harry teased, playfully pinching his side. "I may be shorter than you, but I think you'll find I have no trouble in throwing you around."
Harry couldn't dream of saying these things to Ron, so instead, he said, "He's so, like," he screwed his face up, trying not to say anything terrible that would come back to haunt him, "like—middle-manager at Gringotts."
," he said absently.
." Draco exhaled heavily, smoothing his hair back to regain some composure. "I know for a fact that your number is always two higher than your partners know about while you're dating, what with all the cheating that ensues. I bet Luna thinks she's number eleven and you'll stop there, doesn't she?"
“Ok, let’s give them a minute and then it’ll be your turn,” Harry said to Hannah and the Hufflepuff prefects. They nodded and went to collect their fellows.
Harry stretched and yawned in his bed… the idea of a nice cup of early morning tea seemed very tempting. He got up. Still in his sleeping attire of t-shirt and boxers, he just put on sweatpants and went to the common room.
he wondered
Neville gave Harry’s shoulder a quick pat and opened his mouth as if he wanted to say something – but thought better of it and shook his head. He grabbed his stuff, grunted something like, “See’ya” and left.
Harry shrugged. “I respect your remorse, Prof– … Mr Laddley, but I don’t need to know why you chose to do what you’ve done.”
Still Draco avoided his eyes like he usually did except in the early mornings. During their morning tea routine Draco seemed relaxed, he teased Harry quite a bit but in a distinctly friendly way. But in front of others Draco’s behaviour towards Harry was rather cool. Which irritated Harry more than he wanted to admit.
He stepped into the bright bird-house and was surprised to see Draco Malfoy leaning against the wall next to the door, hands stuffed in his trouser pockets and a strained expression on his face.
Harry stared at the colourful little mats in front of him. Each place mat seemed to be of a unique pattern and with a name woven into it. Luna’s mat showed a delirious floral pattern in shades of blue, with plenty of red and yellow lines drawn into it but without a trace of green. Ron’s pattern was a bright red and yellow tartan, with some finer lines of green and blue.
“Wait a minute – you’re afraid of dogs?”
Draco gave in and nodded, “Okay. But where?”
“Over here, Harry!” Ginny called at him. She was sharing one old wing chair with Cass and patted at an empty chair next to theirs. Tommy and Tavin slouched on the rug in front of them.
– and the hare vanished.
“Of course we do. We discussed every aspect of the whole matter nearly all night long,” Hermione said, “I sincerely think he would not risk his probation for such a prank… or whatever that is. He’s too clever for that.”
“I believe you do, Mr Potter. That is exactly why I trusted you of all people to be discreet.” Narcissa Malfoy said and stopped once more. “I’m afraid I have to leave you now. I think it might be better, if you talk to Cassiopeia and Draco without me. You will find them at the pavilion. I might add, it would be very reassuring for Cassy to know, that you intend to respect her need for confidentiality.” Suddenly she seemed to be worn out and exhausted.
“Most certainly, Healer! Let’s go to my office, as soon as these gentlemen have left us, shall we?” The matron nodded at Harry, Josh and Laddley.
“Quite understandably,” said McGonagall who had come to a halt in front of an artfully carved wooden door. She pressed her flat hand against an engraving of Hogwarts’ coat of arms and the door flew open. “Welcome to the Headmistress’ quarters!” she added.
“Fuck’s sake!” Harry shouted. Looks like he needed to take another shower before apparating to Tonk’s cottage for his usual Friday lunch followed by baby-sitter duties.
“What?” Ginny frowned, “I most certainly don’t have to report my feelings to you! And if you wanted to know what’s going on in my life – you could ask me once in a while how I’m doing!”
“Very well,” Flitwick sighed, “you shall have your clothes, if you wish. But only if the painting’s owner agrees with it. It is still part of the Malfoy collection so I shall have to get permission from Ms Malfoy and the Ministry first.”
“Oh, don’t look so doubtful! I’m pretty sure there are not too many copies of this old thing around considering even Flitwick didn’t know the hex. For a start someone has to ask Madam Pince, I’m sure she knows a lot about it… someone else than me, obviously, as I have… ,“ she flushed and cleared her voice, “I have obtained the book in a slightly unusual manner.”
When Cass neared their table again, Ginny beat Draco to hugging her first and Blaise boomed, “Well - hullo, future Minister for Magic!”
“Dearest Aunt Walburga, I took the liberty of bringing along one of my favourite paintings from the Manor, maybe you want to have a look?” Narcissa said.
Today’s lesson was about various ways of changing the size of stuff. Harry was reminded of little Teddy effortlessly growing and shrinking his tiny baby-nose… Teddy must have grown so much since Harry had last seen him. He sighed again and Draco snarled over his shoulder, “Stop distracting me, Potter!”
“You can keep it, if you wish! I don’t want it, and neither does Andromeda. It was her idea, that I give it to you,” Harry said.
“I wouldn’t dare to laugh at you! At least not while we’re kissing… I’m simply delighted that you enjoy –“ a quick kiss for Harry’s temple, “ – snogging.”
Just as Harry had expected him to be, Flitwick was eager to talk to Hermione about her research, when Harry asked him at breakfast.
– book many times, when Master Malfoy tried to study the book but did not know how to open it –
Harry stared at him. “What?”
(See the end of the chapter for
He wrapped his arms around Hermione and said, “We have the most amazing costumes prepared! Hell, I’ve even shaved my legs already – I sure want to go to that ball with you!”
Patience is a virtue. (We're getting there, promise #Drarry)
Next morning Harry woke up even earlier than usually. He decided to take a shower and get dressed before having early morning tea. Although he would never be as stylish as Draco Malfoy, he could at least make an effort. Wearing his best pair of jeans and the dark green sweater Andromeda had given him for a farewell present, Harry opened the door to the common room – it was vacant.
Ron took the news of his girlfriend’s new admirer well enough. Just for a minute he looked confused before he grinned ever so proudly.
“Well… I thought… I thought you might worry, that I don’t approve of your friendship?”
Harry was outraged, “What? Josh never ever favours anyone in his class – “
Harry need not have worried. The other young owls were obviously rather pleased to have their clown back. There was a lot of hooting and fluttering, but all in a distinctly friendly way, while the adult owls were just watching the spectacle from above. Harry was relieved.
“And madwomen!” chimed in two former Headmistresses who had obviously been part of the rescue mission.
At breakfast McGonagall had informed all of the students that Professor Laddley was unwell. Muggle Studies was cancelled and today’s swimming lesson was to be held by Blaise, Tommy and Harry instead. She had asked them to step in mere minutes before that announcement, which had increased the popularity of swimming apparently.
“That’s just… disgusting,” Draco said with distain. “This is an all-time low even for your standards, Zabini.”
Harry laughed. “I’ll be happy to see for myself! But Hermione – what’s the interesting stuff you’ve found?”
“Nope,” said Ron hands crossed behind his head. “I’ve learned my lesson. Never interfere with a brilliant mind, if you can help it. You read along, 'Mione, and make sense of all that, I’ll listen to your summery later.”
He turned to Harry and his friends. “I have to brief Professor Weasley now, so I must ask you to leave. Looks like we can’t do much about our… our problem anyway at the moment.“
Just for distraction he ripped the Malfoy envelope open: Yes, Narcissa Malfoy had written again. She invited him once more to the Manor because she wanted ‘
Hermione blushed, but was still eager to oblige. Soon enough she and Flitwick were engrossed in details about Magical Arts, that were far beyond Harry’s comprehension. His thoughts drifted… Should he write to Draco about Josh’s findings? Would Draco be upset to learn that someone had polyjuiced his appearance again and again for months? And where the fuck had the perpetrator gotten hold of Draco’s hair?
Harry exhaled with relief, “– and then we would be terribly late,” before he added with a wicked grin, “not that I’d complain.”
he thought, being well aware that any such hint might not have been received kindly. He laughed too and –feeling bold– reached for Draco’s hand.
“I wonder what McGonagall has to say about this,” Harry said, “but listen – as we have to wait for the Patronuses, I’d like to fetch the Hogwarts’ Cyclopedia of Mean Arts from upstairs, ok? I think it’s time Flitwick takes a proper look at this book… I’ll be right back, ok?”
Harry sighed. “Has anyone ever told you to stop stalling?” he said and went for Draco’s lips again. Their kissing became more urgent, deeper. Harry ran his fingers through Draco’s hair – and yes, it was as soft and silky as he had expected it to be. Draco’s right hand was holding Harry’s neck, thumb circling his hairline, while Draco’s left firmly pressed against the small of Harry’s back. Yes, oh yes, Harry was definitely needy. He could not help groaning again which seemed to amuse Draco enormously.
She stood up, walked towards the painting of Bellevue Beach and quietly talked to her predecessors. Soon enough the two Imagics stepped out of the frame.
“Strictly speaking, this is not a question, Mr Zabini… and none of your concern either,” said Professor Jordan.
Harry stared at the little table in front of him. Apple pie. Of course Narcissa Malfoy had been served the same dishes as the rest of the school. He heard the door clicking shut but kept staring at the cake.
Harry walked upstairs after listening to Laddley’s story. The eighth-years’ dormitory was deserted, all the other students were in class. But after Gregory Laddley’s horrible story Harry didn’t want to stay all alone in his room. His emotions were in uproar. What about Draco? Was he even safe? Draco had sought refuge amongst some Muggle friends of his – but what if they were not trustworthy? What if some greasy bastard took advantage of a handsome young man without a family? The thought alone made Harry feel sick. He had to get back in shape for flying as fast as possible!
“Because right now our rooms are being searched.”
“I see.” Harry gulped. “If that’s what you want to do…”
“Okay, never mind,” Christie chirped and ran off. She was immediately surrounded by a group of little girls who giggled animatedly.
He craned his neck to see where Draco had been put and smiled, seeing him seated between Healer O’Malley and Blaise’s crush Chastity.
“Yes, it most certainly is.” She smiled at Harry. “Anyway, let’s call it a day – I’m tired too.”
Cass had fire-called Harry the day before to confirm that she and Draco would indeed sit with them, which had surprised Harry quite a bit. But as promised he kept the remaining two seats for Cass and – reluctantly – for Malfoy. He baffled his friends by turning down Dean, Seamus and even Neville who had asked for the seats.
Narcissa Malfoy turned towards Harry and searched his face. She clearly wanted to talk to him in private, but did not know how to begin.
She regarded Laddley with much concern. “Hating any of our fellow human beings will not only eventually hurt others but the hater as well. Hate is a very heavy burden nobody needs to carry. It might be very relieving to share your burden by talking about it. I should be very glad, should you be ready to recover – but I cannot force you of course.” McGonagall paused and drew a golden watch from the pocket of her robe. “You have twenty-four hours to consider your options, Professor Laddley. I want you in my office tomorrow at six p.m. right before dinner to hear your decision. Your lessons are cancelled forthwith and you may not leave the castle until then. That is all for now, thank you.”
“Hi,” Harry replied with a grin, “glad to see you too. Actually, I have a request, Sir Cardogan. You know Daisy? Girl in a white dress, with a huge bird for a pet? I’d like to know where she is. Could you search for her?”
Harry and Draco started to talk simultaneously.
Harry teared his eyes away and forced himself to check the other first-floor windows. The one to the left had similar curtains and the same flickering light shone through them – so this must be the sitting room’s second window, which was closed as well. Carefully Harry flew to the third window on this floor. No curtains and darkness behind – this one seemed to belong to another room, maybe a chamber next to the sitting room?
“And what does she know about Draco’s whereabouts at the twenty-eighth? He was grounded at her house, right?”
Harry closed his eyes and sighed deeply. “Of course I trust you… all of you! It’s just… I don’t want to incriminate… others.” He opened his eyes again and looked at Flitwick, “I’m very sorry, Professor, but you are wrong. I know for sure, that it is possible to hex a painting in such a way. At least one trap painting exists. In fact, I have seen it with my own eyes. Any Imagic lured into that painting cannot leave.”
Harry very much doubted that Draco Malfoy would ever write, let alone say those words. Draco’s note –just a few lines scribbled in a hurry– merely confirmed that he had left the no-apparation zone without trouble and thanks for the cloak. But there were three little words at the end of the note that made all the difference:
“Harry, do you have a date for the Halloween ball?” she asked.
Walking through the village they continued to talk about the Quidditch championship. Harry had never been as engrossed by the charts as Ron was, who could ramble about the latest results for hours, but Harry enjoyed his friend’s enthusiasm.
“Laddley blames father for his brother’s mental illness, I know that much. But why would he want to punish
He improvised, “Listen, before Draco left, on our way to the ball, he finally mentioned something about Laddley. Remember, I pestered him for weeks to spill the beans about that homophobic arse? Turn’s out Laddley has a huge grudge against Draco’s father. I want to know why. Aberforth mentioned being friends with Laddley’s late mother so he might know something about that.” He paused. “And of course you can come along, I just intended to make it quick and fly–” he looked at Hermione, “knowing you are not particularly comfortable on a broom I thought I’d rather go alone and hurry back, to tell you everything.”
He bit his lips. Carefully, ever so slowly he turned the doorknob and paused. Nothing happened. With uttermost caution he opened the door, still keeping his place. Still no reaction. He could see most of the room clearly now, everything looked familiar from his last visit – with the horrible exception of Draco, gagged and bound to his chair.
She cocked her head. “I might remember some of it, if you ask me nicely.”
“I’m afraid the explanation is simple – if disappointing,” Hermione said, “it is rather difficult to transcribe names to ancient runes. Runes work like hieroglyphs, not like our letters. So if you want to write a name, you need to be very careful to get it right. I assume, Dumbledore just didn’t have the right runes available on the curtain. As he could only use what was already there, he wanted to avoid giving us a wrong lead.”
. “Well, I think, it’s time to close this lesson. Class is dismissed except for Mr Zabini who will come with me to my office to discuss detention.”
“Yeah, I might be a bit nervous and –” Harry hesitated before he blurted, “I just wonder… I had no idea… with whom Draco was staying, you know?”
“Maybe he’s just trying to impress his probation officer,” Ron said.
“That’s one way of putting it… you have to understand, Harry, the only witchards I’ve ever been close to are Cass, our Nanny and my mother. Most certainly not my father or any other man… hell, I never even had a close pal!” He ran his fingers through his hair, trying to tidy up the mess Otto had left.
Ten minutes later while Harry got dressed, he consciously decided to forget Snape’s remark concerning his relationship with Draco Malfoy. That was just nonsense anyway. No, he simply would not think about it, he said to himself, not at all. He had far more interesting things to ponder than Draco sodding Malfoy.
Otto buried his head in Cassy's neck which made her giggle. "You're such a sweety! If Harry ever gets tired of you I'll adopt you - promise!"
To the sound of trumpets all members of staff entered the hall and took seats at their table. Harry was oddly touched to see, that Josh Jordan too was wearing a kilt. Flitwick looked dashing in dress robes displaying a pattern of colourful flowers and even Hagrid had wrapped an apron over his trousers for the occasion.
The second floor was entirely given to the eighth-year students this year. Harry’s room was at the far end of one long corridor, with windows facing the forbidden forest. At the moment it was still dark outside, but he was sure to have a glorious view of the grounds behind the castle when the sun came out. The students had not only rejoiced in their rooms, but also marvelled at the lavish common room at the centre of their floor, with comfortable chairs and sofas, an upright piano and even a fully equipped tea kitchen.
“Oh,” he stared at his surrogate mother. “Hi Molly… you want to come in?”
“Anyway... I went to the library and started to browse the shelves of the arts section when suddenly it occurred to me – any book with nasty Magical Arts hexes might not be found there but in the restricted section. You remember me summoning books about Horcruxes? Yeah, exactly. So I tried several summoning charms for ‘Nasty Arts’, ‘Poison Arts’ – and look what came to me when I called for ‘Mean Arts’?”
Harry was glad to have the corridor for himself alone. Josh and Draco were nowhere to be seen. Draco… what would he have to say about Harry being gay? Just a few weeks ago, before Harry had met Cass, he would have dreaded Malfoy’s reaction expecting nothing but verbal abuse. But Cass and Draco were really close and knowing how supportive the guy had been to his cousin, Harry had no idea what to expect. He was just glad Malfoy hadn’t been present when his closest friends found out.
Harry blinked. Of course this was not Father Christmas. Just a middle aged man with a white beard and a slight belly. But his rosy cheeks and the bright red sweater he was wearing – with a snowflake print! – tricked Harry into expecting to be asked whether he had been naughty or nice. Harry blinked again and was quite lost for words.
She paused and closed her eyes for a moment, “After your fifth year at Hogwarts Draco… he had a nervous breakdown and then insisted on becoming a Death Eater! I tried to talk some sense into him and Cassiopeia argued with him all summer – but to no avail. Lucius rejoiced in Draco’s decision of course, but I could not understand why my son wanted to take that step when he wasn’t even seventeen years old!
When he, Ron and Hermione finally arrived at Gryffindor Tower late in the evening, McGonagall and Flitwick had already opened the door to the common room, checked all rooms for intruders and declared the place to be safe.The remaining students at Gryffindor Tower had not even been aware what had happened. Ginny and Cass retreated to the girls’ dormitories after reporting what they had seen – which was basically an empty frame.
I lean back pulling the covers with me draping them across our bodies. Draco wastes no time in wrapping his arms around my waist. I can feel his heart beating impossibly fast. I feel a rush of pride and joy that he would allow himself to be this vulnerable with me. I am quite certain that no matter how much he has changed he would still never let just anyone see this side of himself. With that thought I wrap my arms around him in turn, pulling him closer. Draco sighs and with his head on my chest falls asleep once again. I do not sleep the rest of the night. I don't know what I feel anymore. I don't know what I feel for Draco. But I know it isn't hate. And it feels like more than friendship. Could I be falling for Draco Malfoy?
A glance up from my table has me looking in the direction of the Gryffindor table. Staring directly at me Potters green eyes again bore into my own. Smirking I raise an eyebrow nodding my head in the direction or Granger who is still rapidly jabbering in his ear. Potter holds my gase a moment longer a slight smile forming on his own lips before he turn his focus to his friends. I feel my heart rate slow though I hadn't noticed it speeding up. Shaking my I wonder about this new lodging Mcgonagall was talking about.
Draco's eyes are shining with unshed tears. He looks at me asking a question with his eyes that I answer with a small smile. Draco and I let go of each other only long enough for him to take my wrists again. I am pulled farther onto his bed. Quietly, though my silencing charm is still holding, I lay down beside him. I reach behind him to the covers he had previously thrown off, my arm hovering over him with our faces only inches apart.
“Harry.-” I falter, but he isn't done yet. “I testified for you because I was in the same situation at my own house.” Harry surprises me with a half-hearted chuckle. “Your family might have hated all muggleborns, but...my caretakers hated all witches and wizards alike, including me. I would testify for you, again and again, Draco, because I believe had you ever had a choice, you would've chosen differently.”
What have I gotten myself into? I cannot help but ask myself this question as I sit in my dorm during my free period and wait for Draco to get out of his last class. When did he and I become so friendly? We only saw each other for the first time since summer yesterday, yet it feels as if I've known him my whole life. I guess have, though, haven't I? Who's to say our fiery rivalry couldn't just as quickly be an equally as passionate friendship?  I leave our room and sit in the common area on the love seat when a parchment plane lands in my lap.
"ready to eat your words, Harry." I chorale. Rolling his eyes, Harry suddenly grins and whips around me to the other side, "you have to catch me first." pulling out the snitch he had in his pocket, he throws it in the air where it whirs to life before zipping off.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Standing he surmised that he probably needs to eat something. "one chocolate frog please." he asks quiet and politely. The witch smiles sweetly handing him his treat. As he gives her his money smiling politely the compartment door across from him swings open. Harry potter steps out followed closely by Weasley. Grey eyes meet green
I glance at his hand and at the door where people still pile in. This is my chance at a fresh start. Smiling, I take his hand, "Draco Malfoy, it's a pleasure to meet you."
I leave Harry sitting on his bed as I go to the washroom to change and brush my teeth. He is still sitting in the same spot when I come out. I don't think he is coping with his emotions from the war. "sometimes, " I huff, "sometimes, my nightmares are so bad that when I wake up, I cannot move except to check my pulse to make sure I'm still alive. After that I just lay there. Sometimes after those nightmares, I have panic attacks. sometimes I just pass back out."
The sparkle of the snitch as it bobs shocks me back to reality. I lunge for it while Harry is still caught in his thoughts. Harry pulls himself from his ideas and dives for the metal contraption. This is something he loves. I can see it in the set of his shoulders. He keeps diving, but I pull up. It's okay to lose now and again, right? He grabs the snitch only moments before it and his crash into the ground, and he holds the shaft of his broom pulling up.
"so even though, we're still sorted into our houses, we're technically a house all our own?" Granger calls out and Mcgonagall nods smiling "yes, miss Granger. Now when I call your name please move to the available 8th year table."
I am dumbstruck. I push back memories that rise to the surface, taking a breath, eyes closed. “you think you highly of me, Harry. I should have stood up to them but didn't. Thank you again, though. I won't forget it.” and I'm so acutely aware of the fact that Harry is still holding my wrist almost subconsciously now that before I think better of it, I have pulled him into a tight embrace.
Harry glances around our new room. There are no four-poster beds, just simple framed full-sized beds. My side is all forest green with hints of silver in small places. Harry's side is mostly crimson with a little gold in a few areas. Luckily, there are bookshelves because I genuinely do like to read, and I have quite a few books. "McGonagall outdid herself this time," Harry says, glancing at my side. "hey, Potter do you plan to use your bookshelf, I just have several books, and I don't think my one will hold them all." I ask politely, "yea, no, I won't be using it your free to do with it what you please." he raises a brow "oh, and my friends call me Harry." nodding, I grab my first suitcase to start unpacking "alright...Harry, call me Draco then."
Quietly I step toward the cart Malfoy enters minutes ago. Knocking on the side of carriage I swing myself up into the compartment. It wasn't that I didn't expect any of his friends to be here but I didn't expect him to completely alone. Clearing my throat I sit my bags in the seat beside me and across from Malfoy. Look up and meet his peircing grey...no blue eyes.
The sound of the washroom door shutting throws me from sleep. Jumping up, I run to my side and grab my robes. I have possibly majorly messed up. Harry probably hates me now. He had only just yesterday decided to be my friend, and I couldn't kep my hands off of him for even a day. Sitting with my head in my hands, I hear the bathroom door open.
The first couple of classes pass by in a blur until I'm in my final class of the day and one I'm truly starting to resent, arithmancy. I've only been in class for 5 minutes and I'm already trying not to fall asleep. A piece of parchment appearates onto my desk.
Ron and Hermione glanced at each other, "Dean Thomas, Seamus..." Hermione list ticking each off of her fingers. "I'm positive there are others, but we didn't receive any lists. Those are just the mates Ron and I have takes to."
I cannot fight the grin the spreads across my face at Harry's letter.
We’re stuck standing outside of McGonagall's class for several minutes. Harry and I stand in silence for a second before I speak. “I never got to thank you for testifying on my behalf, so well, thank you. I just needed to say that.” Harry's face furrows in confusion “you thought what I would testify against you?”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Potter sits back crossing his arms a smirk forming on his lips "still upset about that are you malfoy, that was 8 years ago." I feel a smile pull at my own lips "Dont flatter yourself Potter." There's a glint in his emerald eyes that I don't entirely like "I'm done with childish fights, Malfoy. I've grown tired of them so, do you know what I plan on doing?"
"Good morning to you too." I grumble and with only a small amount of mortification I pull myself closer leaving my head in the soft spot between his neck and shoulder. "Do you want to talk about it?" Harry asks me whispering again into my fine hair and I shiver. I think my heart might very well stop when Harry pulls me closer still. One hand falls to the back of my skull. His fingers run through my hair over my scalp.
"Good morning, I trust you slept well?"  Harry says as he passes me on the way to his bed. Groaning, I stand up "good morning, " I glance his way, "do you think you slept well?" I question him, "you, ah, you had a nightmare."  Harry nods somberly. "I did yea for a bit, but it went away," he tells me, and we make eye contact for a single moment before I break it and clear my throat "do you want to talk about it? I only ask because I have them too, and sometimes it's better to get them off your chest. To just say it out loud even if it's only to yourself." Harry nods, running a hand through his hair, "maybe later, it's still pretty fresh in my mind. Too fresh right now." he says, his voice thick, and I understand that.
Potter wants to know where Blaize and Pansey are? I cannot decide if he is suspicious of if he truly is only curious. Oddly I cannot bring myself to feel any anger at his bold question.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Potter uses Ron back in the doorway. As I turn to step into my own compartment I'm frozen in place by an all too familiar voice.
Draco shakes my hand, smiling tentatively. "It looks like everyone has made it inside. Let go take a look at our room." Draco leaves me standing in the hallway. I never actually expected him to accept my friendship. I am glad he did, though. I rush inside and see Hermione glancing at me, curiously from the fireplace in the common area. I make my way over to her, "I think I just became friends with Malfoy."
"Okay, students, your password will be butterbeer. Your room is labeled with your names attached to the door." McGonagall instructs us, "I will see you all bright and early for your classes tomorrow; please rest well."
Threading my fingers in his hair, I pull him to my chest into a tight embrace. Harry sighs and relaxes in my arms before wrapping his own around my middle. My breath hitches, and I try to pull away. Harry's grip tightens around me, and suddenly, I'm pulled into his bed beside him. I'm starting to panic now, but Harry’s grip is like a vise. I close my eyes and take a deep breath. I try to calm down. I breathe in Harry's scent, where his head rests against my chest.
Of course, Potter would be returning to Hogwarts for his final year. To finish his education, to see old friends one last time. All noble reasons undoubtedly. Draco cannot help but shake his head and chuckle under his breath. Saint Potter.
Malfoy raises a single brow “Potter, are you-I’m sorry, are you quite alright,” he questions, “why are you not with Granger and the weasel?” my hackles rise at the name. Malfoy has coined for Ron but shakes my head and shrug, “carriage was full.” this time I manage to hold back my smile as I lean back and stretch my legs out. I have gotten quite a bit taller since the last time I had to ride in the carriages.
"Anythin' from the trolley dear?" the little which asked briskly.
Curious I answer "please do tell, Potter." and he laughs "I am going to be your friend."
A low rumble drew his attention it was likely the train about to barrel into his field of vision. Quickly he crosses the opening from the stairs beside the steps he just decended. If he got he might be able to pass by the golden trio unnoticed. Quickly as he could, Draco crossed reopen barrier. Just before he was out of sight he felt a pair of eyes on flash to him. With the hairs risinfon the back of his neck Draco couldn't stop himself from glaring out of the corner of his eyes. A set of impossibly green eyes watched his escape trailing him. Draco felt their presence on his skinnlong after h was out of sight.
"So Hermione, what classes are you taking this year?" Harry didn't need to mention they would also their last. That thought loomed over them all as they stood this final time waiting for the Hogwarts express. "Oh Harry, I've taken advanced arithmancy, potions obviously, and Herbology..." Hermione prattled on. Harry didn't mean to tune her out. Honestly he didn't but he saw a streak of light colored hair pass in his peripheral.
Struck by a thought I grab a small piece of parchment writing quickly before folding it into a small plane and sending it in the direction of the Gryffindor table.
Mainly he dreaded to hear his friends’ opinion on Draco being a suspect, fearing they might find the cause plausible enough. As they could hardly bring the matter up in a place where other students might drop by anytime, he hoped to postpone that inevitable discussion for some hours at least. But that did not keep his own mind off topic and Hermione had to call for his attention more than once. She looked quite worried, Harry thought. Ron, on the other hand, seemed to be slightly embarrassed for whatever reason.
“They’re really well behaved, your dogs,” said Harry.
“I’m afraid not, Minerva,” said Snape’s Imagic. He ran his fingers through the poodle’s fur and the tiny dog flopped on his back presenting his naked belly to the Imagic.
“Is he finally conscious?” someone –
trouble than you imagine! Someone has set you up! And it’s not the first time they did it! You’ve been a suspect in this matter for some time now and if Kingsley interrupts the ball, they’ll have found some serious evidence against you!”
He was terribly worried about Draco’s safety of course. Was it a good thing that Draco had gone into hiding? Maybe he was even safer in the Muggle world? But what if his malicious uncle found him at his refuge – Draco would be all alone, left to defend himself without anyone’s support! The thought alone made Harry feel sick.
“Well, that’s… a surprise,” Harry stared at the coat of arms on the envelope which was well known to him. The Malfoys’ coat of arms. Ginny glanced over his shoulder while he ripped the envelope open. There was something slightly disappointing and even more astonishing about the name at the end of the short letter: Narcissa Malfoy had sent him a letter. An invitation actually.
“I don’t know what to think anymore, Mr Potter” said McGonagall, “you just informed us, that two of our main suspects know about this hex! And you didn’t even find it necessary to tell us about the whole matter right away! One might get the impression you do not care for Hogwarts at all.”
Cass laughed. “You are quite right, he has more important duties. That’s exactly why he will stay at school – he’s the new D.A.D.A. teacher, don’t you know?”
, Harry did the same.
Then he gave Harry a meaningful look. “Hey, I won’t ask you about Draco’s whereabouts but I am pretty sure you know more than you let Kingsley know –“
After a moment of silence Aberforth addressed Hagrid, “Well, I think we better get back to the task at hand, shall we?”
“I trust you completely, all three of you, that’s why I’m telling you in advance. I know that none of you is hiding a trap painting. But… if you happen to have made some changes to your rooms, which you do not want to be known about, it might be wise to remove them for tomorrow night.”
“Ha! Mildly impressed?” Blaise laughed and slapped Draco’s back, “That’s the understatement of the year! You’re simply smitten by his authority, Malfoy – that’s what you are!”
The afternoon tea dance was a roaring success. Harry had never had so much fun at any of Hogwarts’ festivities before and not just because he was now officially dating Draco Malfoy. In fact he didn’t even spend much time with Draco, because many students –boys and girls alike– wanted to dance with Harry and he didn’t turn anyone down. The dress code seemed to make kids more daring and even the first-years were not shy to approach their hero. Draco on the other hand was also a very sought after dance-partner because of his excellent skills. That is why the two of them hardly ever danced with each other.
When Harry opened the door to his room later that evening, the unexpected sight of Hermione and Rom snogging on his sofa stopped him at the threshold. He sighed, “Seriously? Don’t you guys have your own rooms to make out?”
Silence.
“To all the newcomers – sorry you have to wait a bit, be assured you are nevertheless very welcome! For now your job is to watch the three groups and consider where you might fit in. We will have the regulars leave in about forty minutes today, than it’ll be your turn.”
decision, not
When Harry told Andromeda about his decision the next day, right after their usual Friday lunch, he was rather surprised by her response. They were sitting on a wooden bench behind Andromeda’s cottage observing Teddy and Otto, who were mutually fascinated and frightened by each other. The little boy was clutching at his grandmother and not daring to get close to the bird sitting on Harry’s arm.
Hermione smiled, “Let’s say, I wanted to have a mauve silk dress instead of my cotton blue-jeans. In that case I would first need to transfigure them into a silk dress, but the dress would still be blue. To change the colour I would need to use
Ron looked very pleased with himself and then asked. “So… what about you and Ginny? Any chance of hooking up again?”
he told himself,
“When exactly did that happen?” McGonagall asked. She seemed to have recovered from the initial shock of Harry’s disclosure.
“Yeah, maybe not. But it’ll be awkward to perform magic in front of a crowd of people watching – I’m afraid I’ll make a fool of myself.” Cass sighed.
Odie reached for the largest teapot Harry had ever seen. “Take a seat and have a cup – we could chat a bit while waiting for David and Frank, if you like?”
“Did I mention that I’m not interested?”
“That’s interesting,” said Harry, “well, Cass told me the former Ollivander collection was handed over to the Ministry… maybe their C.O.M.A. copy is at the Ministry’s library? I’ll ask McGonagall to check this. The Malfoy copy must be the one Taurus has read. I’m sure Kingsley could find out whether it’s still at the Manor.”
“How are you doing, Harry?” asked Kingsley.
“Hello Harry,“ Daisy beamed at him. “We hoped to see you anyway but didn’t want to wait here, next to that strange knight. So we lurked just a painting away, hidden behind curtains until he came to search for me.” She giggled again. “That Sir Cardogan is so, so weird! Always tells ridiculous stories about his exploits. We don’t believe half of it, do we, Ariana?” Daisy pressed her friends hand and Ariana Dumbledore nodded vigorously.
Harry could feel her fingers digging into his forearm while talking. He was deeply disturbed by Cass’ story. And although he was repelled by Narcissa Malfoy’s part in it, he had to give her credit for her honesty and the obvious remorse she was showing.
Professor Flitwick cleared his voice. “Very well, Ms Silver, let us get back to what this unknown artist did – please carry on.”
Kingsley Shacklebolt's announcement caused a lot of commotion. As soon as the Headauror’s voice had faded the students started to talk and shout - within seconds the great hall was buzzing with excitement.
Harry contemplated his career options… he had longed to become an Auror for years now… but… working with animals must have many advantages, he thought, animals did not talk back. Maybe Hagrid’s position of Hogwarts’ game-keeper was preferable over many well-paid jobs?
“United Nations? What’s that?” Ron asked.
“Flitwick hung it up yesterday evening,” Draco said.
But Harry quickly turned away.
“Fine. Truth be told, I’m worried. Draco… he’s clearly troubled over something, in fact he looks unwell. He doesn’t even pay attantion at class – which is totally out of character! And Cass… she’s so engrossed with Ginny at the moment, I don’t think she’s aware that Draco hardly ever talks to anybody…” his voice trailed off.
At Friday lunch after their first full week at school Blaise leaned over to Harry and said, “Just two more lessons and we’re done – how about a quick workout before dinner, Harry?”
Harry glanced nervously at her. “Did Draco tell you… I mean…” he broke off.
as Cass was also a Malfoy – right?
“Oh, I see,
“Sound’s like an exciting career to me,” said Harry. “So why did he accept this position at Hogwarts? Must be a huge down-grade in salary and prestige.”
“I am very glad that your recovery is making good progress, Harry,” she said looking slightly worried, “and not just because I hope that you will be able to find my son… although I have to admit, that’s part of it.”
“You were brilliant, Ms Malfoy,” Harry said feeling truly dumbfounded by what he had observed and immensely relieved as well. “Thank you so much!”
Harry frowned and paid for his order. He even tipped the guy, who took the money with one final grunt, which might have been ‘
“I’m flying out of here in the dark of the night, out of the no-apparation zone. As soon as it’s possible, I’ll risk disapparating to… to the place I’ll be staying at.”
“I had no idea,” he murmured in her hair, “no idea at all, what a dreadful, dreadful family.”
“Don’t be ridiculous, Mr Potter!” Narcissa Malfoy interrupted. “None of what has happened is your fault. It is his family that has failed Draco, not you. If anybody is to blame, it is me. I should have left Lucius years ago, put an end to that farce of a marriage and protected my son from his father’s influence.”
“So while they spruce up – will you tell me what’s going on? Why you are here? David has always been very secretive about school… I just know that you attend some posh boarding school and the two of you didn’t get along for years – which pained David more than he would ever admit, but I guessed as much. Alas, this year you became… friends? Is that right?”
“Ladies, gentlemen and everybody else! A short update from the cockpit – this is your captain / author speaking. We are approaching our final destination fast and will reach ‘The End’ in seven chapters. We expect serious turbulences for this part of the journey and therefore ask you to fasten seat belts. Be assured we’ve got everything under control. If the journey has pleased you so far, please recommend our service to other potentially interested travellers. I bid you a good day / night & enjoy the ride!”
“What? I thought they would interrogate Laddley today?” Harry interrupted.
Draco grabbed Harry’s face and kissed him hard.
“What?!” Harry shouted.
“'Course I'm alright, Mr Malfoy!” he said talking back over his shoulder.
“Luna, Hannah, Blaise and Draco – please stay at your old dormitories until the heads of houses take over and send you back, which might take a while, especially for Flitwick. Dean, I’m sure you’ll find shelter at Ravenclaw House for tonight.” Dean blushed und Luna looked delighted.
"Never mind, I can't remember clearly anyway... it's just... " Harry shrugged. He was well aware that the real reason for his lack of enthusiasm about the ball was his falling out with Draco. Since last Sunday all dancing related past-times had lost any appeal for him.
Aberforth nodded but looked reserved.
“What?” Harry shouted. Draco had only danced with girls the previous evening, he was sure about that. Was he making fun of Harry’s sexual orientation? Cass must have told him by now.
Before Harry had even a chance to respond, Draco said with a sneer, “Now that you have come to his rescue, Professor, I’m sure ‘
“Interesting enough, just like Tharros he spent many years abroad. And no, Ron, I’ve told you already, I’m not getting married any time soon. At least not before I have found myself a proper job and so should you.” She gave her boyfriend a stern look.
His eyes found Harry’s – and stayed there. They were warm and grey and – just very beautiful. Harry felt a flash of heat rising from his neck up to his cheeks and he silently cursed – these damn blushes had to stop!
“You’re truly fucked, mate,” Ron said with much compassion, “missing pudding for a meeting with your mother-in-law.”
Harry coughed and choked. He expected to hear the firewitchards’ alarm any second now.
“Don’t bother, Harry,” Hermione said. “I think we can guess what you want to know.” She passed a glance with Ron, who whispered, “Go on!”
“Draco,” Harry said quietly, “please conjure your Patronus again, will you?”
Most of his students chuckled but one look at Harry’s annoyed face made them quickly start swimming again.
“That is very observant of you, Floppy,” Harry felt the need to compliment this desperate being in front of him, when suddenly an idea hit him. “Do you like to look at pictures, Floppy?”
“But you have to admit, Malfoy doing a runner does not look good,” Ron said, “can’t blame Shacklebolt for his suspicion.”
“Thanks, I’ll take credit for that. If it were up to Frank, the girls – they’re Arwen and Eowyn by the way – would be totally spoiled. Well, what else is to be expected from a vet!” Odie snorted.
“But this is ridiculous! This is not your decision to make! You only have to ask yourself, if you want to be with me! That’s it!”
Of course Harry and Tommy wanted to talk to the Headmistress as soon as possible. But first they needed to get properly dressed and then they had to wait at the foot of the enchanted staircase for an awfully long time because McGonagall was not in her office. When she finally returned and they told her what had happened today, she was as shocked and appalled as was to be expected and wanted to hear Tommy’s full story.
“My own thoughts exactly, Harry,” McGonagall answered. “Trust me, I don’t want to believe that one of my students is involved. And especially not a student, I personally vouched for to get him back to Hogwarts.” She looked at Harry with much concern in her eyes and Harry remembered McGonagall’s testimony at Draco’s trial. She had indeed spoken very much in Draco’s favour and put the full force of her own respectability in account. Harry had been quite surprised at that time.
Ron certainly did not need to be encouraged. He grinned widely and stuffed his mouth with a chocolate treat. When he grabbed for another one before he had even gulped down the first, Hermione elbowed him in the ribs and Harry chuckled.
“We were actually quite close as kids, Narcissa and I. But as soon as I ran off to marry Ted, she broke all ties to me, as the rest of the family expected her to do. She was never very courageous and after my so called elopement, she was watched and directed even more closely by our parents,” Andromeda sighed. “You know what, I even felt guilty for a while when she got married… made me wonder whether my support might have given her the courage to refuse… I fear my marriage had put even more pressure onto her.”
Harry and Ron grinned, but Hermione rolled her eyes.
“I’m afraid the Ministry archives’ security system is rather weak, they don’t check wands,” McGonagall said. “Maybe this affair will even be the reason for some improvements long overdue – but of course that would not be helpful for our case. Presently the procedure is simple enough. One walks up to the counter at the entrance and signs the registry, the receptionist merely checks the appearance of the visitor by comparison to a picture from the Ministry’s own files. Kingsley let me have a look at Draco’s file, his picture was taken at the trial and is not very good. Any blonde young person might pass for him. One would not even have to use Polyjuice Potion.”
“You’re such a show off,” Seamus rolled his eyes.
“But you could have refused to testify, no one would have forced you,” Ginny said.
Harry stared at his friends, “Are you saying what I think you are? Josh is… gay?”
She looked stern. “The Ministry and the School Board cannot keep the whole matter secret much longer. You might have heard some of the ridiculous rumours already that spread like fiendfyre?” She snorted. “Right. We will go public with a press conference at the Ministry on Monday. Meaning this weekend gives us the last opportunity for any secret enquiries – which we intend to make good use of. Kingsley’s team will search the castle thoroughly for evidence, specifically for hidden paintings, while all the older students and staff are at the ball. They will search every private room – including yours.
“’Morning, Harry!” Ron shouted, “Guess what? All students are confined to Hogwarts’ territory! Even us eighth-years are no longer allowed to go to Hogsmeade – what do you make of that?”
“Pity, Malfoy’s in the clear, he’d make such a good suspect,” Ron grinned, “though I have to say, he’s mostly okay these days, sometimes even entertaining in his deadpan way.”
“Yes, he’s missing. And that is exactly what I wanted to talk about, Harry,” said McGonagall with much concern.
A silvery cat with dark patches sprang from her raised wand and –
Harry thought astounded.
He finally let go of Harry’s wrist, which still buzzed with the imprint of his touch. Harry rubbed at the skin where Josh’s fingers had been just seconds before and wondered why his pulse had quickened?
“… so you’ve known about Potter being gay for weeks? And didn’t find it necessary to tell me?” Blaise asked.
When they finally broke apart, Harry cleared his voice. Both of them turned around and stared at Harry. Although their expression was very different – Draco blushed violently and looked upset, while the other grinned widely – their features were very much alike, nearly same height, lean frame and white blonde fringe falling into the forehead. They were even dressed alike in black trousers and white shirts. Harry wondered for a second, if maybe Draco had a secret twin brother?
Ron protested but Harry went on, “Oh yes, we do. We’re both from fucked up families, both complicated and stubborn. You and Hermione – you come from loving homes, your parents are good, kind-hearted people –“
Late in the evening Harry opened the door for Ron and Hermione, who finally retreated to their respective rooms (or, more likely, to their cosy apartment). He heard piano music coming from the common room. Either Draco was still awake… or somebody else was playing? Harry decided to have a look. As the investigation gave him every reason to improve his relations with Draco Malfoy –Hermione had told him so, mind you– he did not intend to procrastinate. Not even late at night. When he entered the common room, he found the card players just about ready to leave and yes, Draco played the piano.
,’ Harry thought. Little Andromeda and little Narcissa seemed to be quite content without their mean elder sister.
he said,
“Well, I certainly don’t want people to know about my parents abandoning me,” Cass pulled a face, “I hate to be pitied, you know. That’s what I don’t want to be talked about, not being queer.”
When Hermione’s hand shot up, Harry feared for having hallucinations – until he realized, that she was merely holding up Ron’s arm.
?” Neville looked at Harry with raised eye-brows.
“No, she won’t because the painting Ms Malfoy brought along is a trap. She will be locked up in it,” Josh said. “You have to admit, it’s rather brilliant, Harry.”
“We have to get you out of here, and fast,” Harry murmured close to Draco’s ear, “trust me… I’ll explain everything as soon as we can’t be overheard.”
Harry’s heart skipped a beat when he saw Draco’s face among them… and yes, there were Lucius and Taurus Malfoy as well as Gregory Laddley. Some of the others looked slightly familiar too, Harry recognized at least two prominent Quidditch players and the owner from the Early Bird Café at Diagon Alley. Well, as the living breathing Sylvia Silver was long deceased, it was fairly unlikely she knew any of them.
Ron and Ginny looked mortified.
Weasley – do you understand?”
You’ve got to be kidding me! I’ve never ever enjoyed public attention! But over the years I’ve learned to bear it until it ebbs away eventually. It always does – ”
“Blood vengeance? Certainly a possibility among pure-bloods – but rather unlikely for a Muggles Studies teacher don’t you think?” Draco looked unconvinced.
“Hi,” Draco said self-consciously, “sorry, I’m a bit early…” his voice trailed off and they stared at each other incredulously.
Yes, Harry had guessed correctly, the elegant witch with the classical profile was Nektaria Tharros, new head of his house and Transfiguration teacher. While clapping their welcome, every Gryffindor around Harry agreed, she looked both beautiful and terrifying. Kingsley Shacklebolt and Josh Jordan were greeted with cheers, some girls even screeched when McGonagall addressed Josh.
“None taken,” said Snape, “in fact, you might have a point there.”
“But surely not Draco! This is ridiculous, he wasn’t even in London at that time but in Edinburgh with Cass and her Aunt Mella – isn’t she a friend of yours? Draco was grounded and under a Tracking Spell trailing his every move for the whole summer – it’s impossible.”
“Sir Lodovicus used to keep this painting,” Sylvia made a gesture around her boudoir, “at his dressing room in Malfoy Manor as long as he lived, even after my death. But when he himself died some years later my painting was put into storage and for decades, nobody ever saw me or spoke to me. I would have loved to visit other paintings at the Manor but of course I could not call on anyone without clothes on! Then one day the Imagic of Miss Lydia Malfoy, Lododvicus’ grand-niece, explored the storage and accidentally stumbled into my room – and we became friends.”
They grinned at each other.
Malfoy Manor was undeniably beautiful. Sandstone walls, huge windows, cornices and pillars made for an impressive building. But having been here under the worst of circumstances before, Harry felt nothing but repelled by the place. He was glad Ms Malfoy had offered to welcome them at the tea house instead. Still they were supposed to meet her at the front door of the Manor.
The last one made Harry stop abruptly. He turned around and glared at the girl. “Excuse me?” At least she had the decency to blush and apologize.
Whereas a slightly dishevelled Hermione removed quickly from her current position on top of her boyfriend, Ron just grinned and stayed on his back.
Josh’s letter was short and reading it felt like riding a roller coaster:
“Well, this particular crib-charmer happens to be part of the Malfoys’ family legacy. According to Ms Malfoy little Draco used to be rather fond of it,” Harry said with a wicked grin. “The image of Malfoy playing with his rainbow coloured unicorn – well, that’s something to relish, don’t you think?”
The guys at Harry’s table looked mostly as nonplussed as him, but the girls seemed to be delighted by the chosen motto.
“No need to be shy, Ms Silver,” said Flitwick in a soothing voice, “just tell us what has happened to you.” He addressed the students. “I haven’t heard her story yet, the Headmistresses just informed me that Ms Silver is finally prepared to talk to humans.”
“That, Mr Weasley, is totally beside the point,” McGonagall raised her eye-brows. “The important question is, why are Headmistresses Da Ponte and Darknight playing cards with the Fat Lady and an unknown… lady of sorts? Instead of trying to get out of this… this tawdry room?”
“Josh sometimes drops by to watch Teddy, though not as regularly as you do, Harry,” Andromeda said.
Harry stared at the Headmistress who seemed even more amused about his reaction. He could not remember seeing her in such good spirits ever before.
“In Edinburgh,” Narcissa said turning her face towards the nearest window.
Before Harry had a chance to reply, Draco hissed, “Shut up or I swear, I’ll curse you!” It did not sound like a joke at all.
“No, that won’t be necessary, thanks. I’ll be fine – it’s only climbing down the stairs that’s still a bit of a plight, but I’ll manage.”
Harry cleared his voice and said – merely to change topic, “Right. Who’s Martin McBride by the way? The previous owner?”
“Oh yes, we need to fight this! Even if you can take it, you shouldn’t have to! And what about the younger kids hearing him talk like that? What kind of message does it send, if we don’t stop him?” Harry pleaded, “And what about some kid still questioning their identity, don’t you think they would never feel safe to come out, if a teacher talks like that?”
Harry looked at his watch. Six minutes. He had already wasted six precious minutes – but he couldn’t bring himself to ring the bell. Half past seven – wasn’t that way too early to disturb someone on a Saturday morning? Draco would probably be awake but what about his host?
“Well, I can assure you it would not work,” McGonagall chuckled, “Lady Library wouldn’t even deliver to the Headmistress – if I were foolish enough to summon!”
"I am glad. And you’re not a failure because you're not going to be sick. You can do this. You’re going to be fine."
? He barely had to wait for an answer to appear, the words swimming into view all together rather than written one letter at a time.
"Don't," he warned. "I've got her. She's all bark."
“But, I—” he swallows, unsure. “I am. I’m still Draco.”
"Once upon a time, you told me that one of the greatest outcomes of spending time near me in public would be a shine to your image," Harry spoke to break the silence—he'd been mooning too long.
"I guess," he said quietly. To be honest, he wasn't really sure what he'd liked. He'd never trusted anyone enough to experiment, and he'd never, ever, wanted someone the way he wanted Draco. Like his blood was on fire, like his skin was electrified by a simple touch.
“Come here.”
"No. I'm not
They still hadn't kissed, that gesture that had always meant something to the both of them. Draco's breathing had become erratic even though his thrusts didn't follow. He'd found himself again, taken back control from the wild place that Harry had sought to bring him, and fucked him purposefully, and with great self-control. Somewhere in his rhythmic fucking, Harry's body decided to respond, his cock pulling up to full hardness from its previous flopping between his legs.
"Maybe not for you," Harry mumbled. Draco's hand didn't stop petting his hair, pushing an extra-long piece behind his ear. Harry cracked an eye and was displeased to find the look Draco was giving him was, of all things,
"What am I supposed to do with this?" Draco asked, keeping the book cracked open with his thumb.
made concrete a memory, turned it into the cannon of his life. The chunk of rot lodged inside of Harry had been shaken loose, and he could feel it turning to smoke, to nothing, as he spoke openly about all the things he loved about Draco, even while he danced around the word, that awful, cursed word he couldn't dare say aloud again. Because he did, love him, loved what he did, who he was, his character, his smile, his smell—all of it.
“Pardon me?”
A mix of slack-jawed and concerned faces looked back at Harry, Justin's included. Ron held himself low to the table, as though he could only comprehend what was happening by getting a good look at the situation from a lower angle.
"What?" Ron dropped his jaw, exasperated. "Come on, mate. He's so what? What's it hurt talking to him? He's half the arse now he was back in school."
"Ready?" Harry asked. At Dean's nod, Harry concentrated just enough to levitate the wand for Dean to flick so that it spun round and round.
"What?" he said.
"I prefer willfully ignorant, but whatever makes you feel better."
“No, sorry. When I get injured, I get sent to Mungo’s and otherwise—”
Draco's eyes flicked to the door, his look of alarm slowly fading.
"If I could, I'd ask you to marry me, you know," Harry murmured.
"I want to know what you taste like," Draco said. His voice had grown rougher as he lost composure. "Can I?"
"Oh, come on! This isn't a dream, Potter, don't be a wanker. Is it truly so ludicrous that I would—"
inches taller than me, Harry Potter. But I want it on the record, that we were dead-even when we were back at school," he said. "If you ask me, it’s completely unfair that you got to grow late. It's practically cheating."
“They’re meant to be drunk, Potter, not aspirated.”
And he looked to Ron just as he grimaced like the word was an aberration, and Harry lost it. Felt his stomach drop and his heart stutter.
"I love this place," Draco said conversationally, scrutinizing the bill, "a bit slow for a Friday though, isn't it? What's the bar normally pull at the weekend?"
Harry packed the last few things away inside the inner pocket of the travel bag. Waterlogged paperbacks and toothbrushes and back-issues of Potions Monthly. The last thing he grabbed was a pair of Draco's sunglasses, the big one's he adored. He hastily cast the charm to fix his vision and threw them on instead of his regular ones as he met Ron at the door.
“Something by the name of
"What's Kreacher been feeding you," she teased him, pinching a bit of skin on his side through his t-shirt.
There was a stillness in the room, a quiet so pervasive that all Harry could hear was the roaring of his blood in his ears, whooshing in and out with each beat of his heart.
"I didn't say fix, Draco—"
"Her assistant though, the Tom fellow? He's the nutter that set this all off."
“Hush now.” His voice carries and the shuffling stops. “Nearly supper time for my good boy, is it not?”
and almost died of boredom making his way through
"You're too good—"
"Since, since," Harry blustered, looking around for the answer to jump out at him and finding none, yelled, "since it's none of your bloody business!"
"What plan?" Harry sniffled, sitting up on the couch. Ron's baby blanket dug into his back, so he pulled it out and spread it over his lap, curling under it. It smelled faintly of green grass and spilt milk, but Harry didn't mind it.
"Is it the half you say when we're fucking or the half you say when we're not?"
had? It wouldn't hurt to have a friend that also happened to be fit. Perhaps he could be Harry's wingman—the thought was, on its face, terrifying, but it couldn't hurt to try, could it?
that was long-term relationship stuff, as far as Harry was concerned.
"Deviant," Harry said.
"Of course not. He didn't really say. I assumed. It's my mistake." Draco had taught the girls in the corner some spinning move with their feet whipping in, propelling them in endless spirals. He'd moved on to work with a group of younger students, mixed boys and girls, taking them through a simple routine. Harry tapped out the beat on the steel, eyes only for Draco. It made his heart hurt to see him, but he couldn't tear his eyes away.
"It's incredible," Harry said, looking to the glass in disbelief. He craned his head to yell at the ceiling. "Kreacher, this is the best thing you've ever made. Wherever you are, thank you!"
"Now I've got to go downstairs and act normal when all I want to do is lock the front door—"
"I'm sure they'll be fine. I'll uh, I think I'll walk a bit. Need to stretch my legs."
"Hey!"
"I don't know what's been said to you, but I know what my Father told me. That Malfoy men are men, and we can take whoever we want, but that under no circumstances were we to be the ones
"Astute," he said, "though it's times like these that I really, really hate therapy."
Malfoy huffed. "No, Potter, it's not."
"The hallway?" The back of Harry's neck prickled as a blush bloomed upwards. Draco's cheeks pinked too—it couldn't be the worst feeling in the world to discover that your lover took up outside your bedroom door while you were incapacitated.
"Don't do that," Draco whispered harshly into the phone. "They're my closest friends. They're safe. And they didn't leave me on the verge of tears with their reaction."
The comedown is quiet. Slow. The long line of spit connecting Draco’s mouth to the place he latched onto droops and snaps in two, and then the sliding door opens and the sounds of the party spill out across the lawn.
Harry had caught him just out of the shower, white hair darkened to something of a natural blond by the damp clinging to it. His eyelashes were fine as spider silk, framing eyes with irises ringed in darkness. He'd been looking out a window on a rainy day, only a towel wrapped around his hips, and when Harry called his name and he turned, he'd taken the shot.
"You yet again barely meet the requirements of a guest, Potter. Frankly, it's adorable that you think I have any." Harry kept his eyes studiously trained at Malfoy's ankles as he followed him upstairs, all in an effort not to notice his small yet very obvious-in-a-tightly-wrapped-robe arse. Which was, well, it was
Harry swipes a length of his hair over a spindly shoulder.
enough about this. But now it’s gone and happened and—" Harry growled something like a yell and stopped, pressing fingers up under his glasses into his eyes, pressure building into a blinding headache out of nowhere. "I hate it, Draco, I hate it so fucking much. I operate in a world where the rules for me are very,
Cissy smiled wickedly and rose slowly on her forearms to look Harry in the eye. The dress was a joke now, permanently slipped down to expose one pink nipple and the ghost of ribs underneath it.
"Sure. Yeah. Of course." Harry feigned composure as he dusted off the seat of his trousers to join Draco on the couch. Harry held his bent legs close to him while Draco sprawled, one foot nearly touching Harry's leg. He was doing it on purpose, of course. Keeping Harry on edge by being in his space.
The first room he came to was a study. It reminded Harry of Hermione's library with its stacks of books, mostly ancient, some new, arranged spine-to-spine on the floor to ceiling bookshelves.
Recognizing that Draco was nervous was the spark Harry needed to kindle his courage. He picked up Draco's foot and brought it into his lap, pressing his thumbs firmly into the arch.
He traced a fingertip in a circle on the bedspread, noticed as Draco’s grip on the belt softened.
“That’s the first genuine thing you’ve said all day,” Harry said. Malfoy eyes snapped up to his and Harry stared back, gaze flicking to his wanton mouth when it opened to reveal the pink of his tongue as his breath rustled the paper.
"Alright, well. I'll go then," Harry jerked a thumb over his shoulder and turned to walk away, what he should have done ages ago. His mind was already on the long route home that he'd walk, and how good the floor of the tub would feel to sit in once he got there, and how he could do it, could stay all in one piece until dinner, and then he could make it to bed and sleep, and how it was just one foot in front of the other, one second becoming a minute becoming the days until Draco was ready to give it a go again, and he was thinking these thoughts so that when the lightning-quick grip on his arm pulled him roughly back he wasn't prepared for it in the least and they collided, his body falling into Draco's. Harry looked up into his eyes, mouths so close that the kiss was right there, was inevitable. He could feel through the soft fabric of Draco's trousers that he was hard already, and he let out an undignified pant, hands reaching up to hold on to his shoulders. Draco gripped his forearm still, so tight it was like he was afraid that if he let go, Harry might slip away.
"But if you know that there was nothing between us, then why are you still so angry with me? I—I didn't
Harry sat up straighter. Something was out of place. "How do you know what I did?"
"Baby steps. Phase one is research. This month, I'm looking."
"Oh my
"This is a very thorough plan to have come up with overnight," Harry began.
The man ran a hand over his smooth scalp, and Harry could pinpoint the moment Draco realized things weren't as sunny as they seemed. He stopped the nervous tapping and sat totally still.
"I'm serious, Pans. He's more powerful than he knows." Draco grit out the words as though it cost him to say them. "It's hackneyed, but it's true. He'll
"Harry?"
Harry shrugged. "I thought you might find that gauche."
The thing that annoyed Harry the most during the hot, hazy days that followed—days spent avoiding Kreacher like the plague, reading up on the odd collection of books tucked into the shelves of Sirius' room, and wanking—the thing that really got his wand in a twist was how very little information there was on Malfoy to dig through. It just didn't make sense that there was

"Something like that," Draco said, leaning back in his chair. "My mum says to always leave the last bite behind as a show of restraint. I say it’s not a habit I want to hold on to."
had come. Because the media storm wasn't truly what Harry was afraid of.
If the hollowness and the vacancy of emotion, the sobbing, the lack of ability or striving, if that was the queen's head on the coin of depression, then this was the tails. Harry remained quiet, pulse picking up in time.
An inkwell of crystal glass and a phial of ink accompanied both a quill and a biro. The quill was crafted from a small black feather, like that of a crow, and the case of the biro was silver, just as cold as the snitch Harry had been practising with that morning. He set them aside and cracked open what he assumed to be a book, though he found it strangely empty, the creamy pages blank as he flipped through it.
Draco’s smirk was slow-growing, but Harry missed it because his gloved finger had found the firm flesh of the raised stoma he’d placed last summer. It had shrunk down to a perfect circle, the blushing pink-red of the inside of a bitten cheek.
"That's it. Keep it simple. If my Father taught me one useful thing, it's that you can pay your way out of or into anything with a little ingenuity. Do keep up."
"Why's that?"
"I'm sleeping again. I was becoming afraid after you left, that I might never sleep properly without your Dreamless Sleep again."
The owl didn't even pause for breath through its eating of the treats but let out a small hoot that Harry interpreted as acquiescence. He rummaged in his pocket for another few sickles for the by-now nearly full payment pouch.
"Herself," Harry corrected, taking Draco's scarf and throwing it over the bannister, along with their jackets. He spelled his glasses dry, impressed when the charm worked properly, for once. "She was wondering where her...friend the mouse had scurried off to."
"I need you," he let a naked want colour his words. He knew how Draco liked it. "Make it so I feel you all day."
"A little under three weeks. It's only a few days per city, I know, but I've got a formula for when to catch international portkeys and when to Floo instead, and if you time the Dreamless Sleep right you won't even notice the time changes."
"That, inside. Everything, everyone, everywhere, doing whatever. It makes me want to—" He had to stop, close his eyes, remember to breathe.
." He emphasized his newly-learned Muggle word.
"Yours," he said, and Draco took one of his hands in both of his own and pulled it up to hold it over his scars, over the pale expanse of skin and muscle and bone, and the steady thump of his heart. Spots of come dotted his stomach, and Harry realized that Draco had come, untouched, a thought that was as sweet to him as anything.
"You did well," Victoria said, and Harry felt that as her way of saying that he'd done well to make it this far, and he didn't have to go any further down the path of a star. He could rest, now, and so he left, ready to do just that.
Malfoy's grave face was the only thing that kept Harry from reaching a hand out to touch the upturned tip of his nose. It looked cute up close. It must be—
Draco smiled properly down into his lap.
Harry nodded again. He was hardly thinking of George anymore; he really, really didn't want to dwell on him at all, if he was honest with himself.
He couldn't help but think that maybe he
He could still pinpoint the last time he almost cried, the day of the final trial—that of the Death Eater who killed Colin Creevey. He was sure the last time he really, honestly cried was when Sirius died, and he didn't like to think about that either. About how maybe that was when he became someone beyond repair.
Why shouldn’t he? Why shouldn’t he try?
Draco looked wantonly down at him, lips plump and wet from his biting of them.
Harry snapped, and the din disappeared. A reverse
Draco scowled. "I am not an intern, Potter."
"Why?" Harry teased.
"Well, some of them are the size of small seas, so," Draco trailed off.
Harry stared out where the white of the sky met the vast, unyielding grey of the ocean. In the day's dying light the stip at that edge glowed violet.
Draco blinked slowly, turned to him. "No, Justin. I thought I'd politely say hello. Which is what I was doing just now. You weren't nearly so irritable last I saw you out and about."
, and it's like—Merlin, I've never been drunk like this before. Or have I? Is this what blacking out is like? Can I be blacking out if I'm thinking about it?"
"Mate, I
It being Dean's birthday, he got to pick the club they went to. And it being Dean, the club ended up being an illegal rave at a place they had to enter through the alley to get into, navigating a thick crowd of smoking revellers only to have the word
"Spit it out, you two," Harry said, and Hermione turned to him with a glint in her eye that spelt nothing good.
"Sorry, what was it? I don't think I quite got it," Harry egged him on, laughing as he had stormed from the room.
The wind stung his cheeks as it whipped tiny ice crystals into his face, and still, he ran. Where, he had no clue. He passed the Hard Rock Café avoiding creamsicle orange piles of sick from some early-morning reveller that dotted the path, crossed the street and passed Wellington Arch. He'd rarely spent any time in the area, knew that by the way it felt like knives were slashing up his insides and the wobbly feeling in his legs that he'd soon have to stop an Apparate home—he didn't stand of chance of running back.
"I don't pity you, Malfoy."
At the end of that week, Harry rose to an empty bed and dragged himself to the parlour. There was no Draco to join him for stretches, no Draco in the shower, or back in bed. Harry found him only after a search bordering on frantic, his voice faintly answering "In here," to Harry yelling his name down the stairs. He sat still in his dressing gown and pyjamas, tucked away in the sitting room he liked best.
"I don't know about all of you, but my hangover potion is doing
Draco vanished his own cup with a quick look around. "That should keep them busy for quite some time, I should think. Just imagine how thrilled Lucius will be to have reason to slander me on the record."
"I don't think you do, and I don't know that I believe you. I wrote to you so early on—you'll make me seem a fool if I believe that this all happened overnight."
Her lips twitched as she spoke. She shared a look with Harry as they took overly large sips of their drinks to keep from laughing, Ginny barely hiding her grin as she straightened up and threw her long Dutch braids over her shoulders. She was taking the piss out of Justin, and Harry appreciated every snarky moment of it.
Harry ran a hand through his hair, fingers finding the outline of the bump left behind from his earlier collision. He wiped the hand on his trouser leg, unsure if there'd be blood at his fingertips.
, and they sat like that for minutes until he had gotten the tears under control and managed a sip of tea, hiccoughs subsiding, fingers curling around the mug for warmth.
Draco snorted, raising his head from a version of the butterfly sit that made Harry's hips hurt to look at.
"Freak," Cissy said, then yawned, arms out long and spindly above her head. "Time for bed for us debauched weirdos, wouldn't you think?"
in ways Harry had never dreamt of. He sucked down halfway and back up again, bobbing his head at the tempo he'd set with his hand. The nails of the hand he used to steady himself dug deeply into Harry's thigh, but Harry could hardly feel them at all.
enshrouding them.
Not everything had to be talked to death about.
." A flash of pain jolted him, as though a hornet had crawled up and stung his face. He lost his grip, and Draco scrambled off of him to the bottom of the bed.
"I wasn't trying to avoid you. I didn't want to bother you when you’re so tired," Draco said by way of explanation. His body was a wet dream, hair glued to his skull, lips swollen from how he'd been biting them. His prick remained hard and when Harry looked it bobbed up at the attention.
"Bit of a boring one, then?" she said, and Harry laughed deeply.
"The bar must have been exceptionally low for a cocktail to have this kind of effect on you," Draco said.
"Fussy?" Malfoy asked eyes narrowed. Harry huffed and threw his hands up.
"Merlin, help me, alright! If he's the
Hermione gave him a bracing look, tempered by the droopiness to her eyelids. She'd partaken in the mead, and it made her sleepy, as the third glass of anything typically did.
bet that we wouldn't sleep together."
"Wait, excuse me,
"Why...does Malfoy...have your glasses, Harry?" Neville spoke in slow-motion, the effort of thinking through the possible answers to the question causing him pain even to contemplate.
when it came to application, so Harry turned back to his work, kept his head down. He could smile, and keep his mouth shut, hold Draco's hand, and make it through the night like he wasn't still
Draco glowered properly, then, pulling his hand free.
“Oh,” Draco thumbed through his messages until he found the offending thread. “Very. You’ve made up your mind about me, and so quickly too.”
"Malfoy, I brought you Draught of Peace. Do you normally take it?"
"We," Draco said.
As far as Harry was concerned, the only turn for the worse of late was that he had no one to talk to about how Draco had somehow supplanted everyone else as the feature of his nightmares. He endured the unappealing first of watching Draco fall through the veil, and then, once he'd gotten back to sleep, it was to Draco bleeding, bleeding, bleeding, scrabbling over white tiles gone red. On a rare night in, one where he dozed off on the couch to the mumbling voices of the BBC on the wireless, he awoke from the image of Draco's pale hand struggling and failing to keep hold of Harry's, his screams as real as any Harry had heard while awake as he fell into a towering inferno, flesh peeling red to black as he burned.
"They're true," Harry said, and then Draco bit his lip, and Harry closed the distance between them, heart thudding as it had the very first time they'd done this. Kissed.
that your left side is your good side." Draco spoke with a smile in his voice, but Harry knew him too well to be fooled by that. Under the bluster was worry; it had to be there, and it wouldn't do for Harry to let it fester under the surface.
a breath, was lightheaded as flecks of spunk hit his neck, stomach—
with his life, without explicitly doing so.
Draco waited a long moment and then nodded, taking his seat slowly, as though it were a danger to do so. Harry found himself releasing a deep breath as he summoned two plates, the silverware and napkins trailing them to the table. Draco sat at the table's head, so Harry took the seat to his right, with a full view of the fireplace behind him. Harry was grateful to have something to look at other than Draco, who, though he couldn't put his finger on what was different from any other night, looked absolutely stunning.
Harry's eyebrows catapulted to the top of his forehead at that word,
He caught sight of himself in a mirror looking moony and realized what he was doing, saying, thinking. He stopped dead in his tracks. This went a lot further than taking some advice and going shopping; what he felt had a name; and what was going on was so very, very far from
Draco swallowed hard, managed to whisper, "It's just a bruise," as Harry shook his head.
"Well. You were put through diagnostic testing earlier, Mr Malfoy, and I'm here to provide some context about the results. You had a terrible fall, but, typically, physical damage is a quick fix. We don't often see damage that a strong
Ron nodded. He was studying Harry's face, he knew. "Yep. For what it's worth, it didn't seem like a date. They left early—"
"Did that work? I never do personal charms on other people," he asked, tossing his wand aside. "Did I do it too hard?"
Teddy spared him only a second's glance over his shoulder.
"It's alright," Draco bit his lip, laughter held behind them. "I accept hugs, you know."
Draco smiled, signing with a flourish. "Not at all. Just curious." The bartender was called away by the couple a table over, so Draco left the receipt on the table.
Harry barely opened his mouth to ask her what could possibly be so salacious in an online room explicitly made for chatting before she cut him off.
"Okay, well—sure, that's kind of brilliant. But, Draco—it's going to be fucking awful. They'll go for anyone willing to talk about you. Your family, friends, especially your enemies."
"I can get in from here, thanks," Draco said, but there was no gusto to it. He frowned down at the device in his hand, and then looked to Harry, caught between answering with him there, or waiting for him to leave, and the feeling of being looked over, of being shunted aside finally set to boil Harry’s resentment.
"No wonder Kreacher's in a tiff," he muttered to himself, casting a distracted
"Simmons dropped me today." The words were spoken into the wind so that Harry wasn’t totally sure he’d heard them correctly. Draco stared out over London—at what, Harry hadn't a clue—a stark, white streak against a sea of grey. "He’s no longer advising me in my research work."
perfect, toy," Draco panted out as the muscles in his thighs tightened and stretched to raise him up and then he sunk heavily back to the bottom and rested there. One hand snaked its way up to Harry's chest, the thumbnail flicking a nipple a few times, until Harry hissed, the sudden urge to hold Draco by his hips and fuck up into his almost debilitating in its urgency. He
"I'm still sorry," Harry offered.
"It's something that couldn't be sent by owl, you twat. You know that's why I'm on the case at all, don't you?" Ron sucked at the lozenge, stepping closer and finally resting on the steel pole barrier that separated them from a three-story drop. He leaned over, observing the pedestrians strolling along, blissfully unaware of the very top-secret business taking place high above their heads. "It's not like a newly minted constable would normally be given liaison on your case. You know that there's stuff that can't be put in writing—"
"Fuck, you're perfect," Draco murmured as he started rocking back and forth, measuring each thrust. They set a rhythm, slow and smooth, and Draco pulled Harry's hips up with an arm around his lower back, his knees at Harry's waist on the mattress; Harry hadn't previously been able to fathom what it would be like to be able to feel Draco so profoundly from inside.
"Hermione," Harry growled under her breath, but she just shrugged and Apparated away as it hit him then that Justin's being there wasn't chance at all. Harry cursed her internally, wishing her bad breath and terrible hair for a year.
One particularly deep growl and then a whine, dark head hung low between his shoulders as he’s close to giving up and there is a jolt between spine and cock as Draco starts to come. He pulls and pulls, riding the high out, hot white stripes of wet on his belly and finishes with a gasp. Harry’s whining is interrupted only by his breaths in, and Draco wishes he weren’t wearing the blindfold because there’s every chance that he’s crying. He needs help sometimes at the end, with the thickest part.
Mornings were a blur of necessity; Draco squeezed Harry's fingers goodbye before daylight, bustling out in rainproof outfits that swished when he walked, and he was nearly always soaked through whether by rain or sweat by the time he made it home. Harry dragged himself to the parlour as he always had, though it wasn't a parlour anymore. He'd had it converted into a proper gym, filled with shiny equipment and, later, at Draco's request, a birchwood barre along one long wall. Draco joined him there most mornings after his run to stretch, until the eye-fucking got hot enough that they moved on to the shower, or back to bed, or on occasion tugged at the elastic bands of each other's joggers and pulled each other off inside that veritable hall of mirrors, gasping, sated and happy on a haphazard pile of foam mats.
"And?"
"Apparate us home," Draco ordered, "we're past the wards now."
Draco didn't close his eyes at Harry's touch, just stared at him, even as someone else entered the room. The dark depressions under his eyes spoke to the fatigue behind jokes, but he was awake, and alive, and still perfectly Draco. It made Harry's heart sing.
"I mean. I've been coming here for years." He swallowed hard. "When. Did. Work. Here?"
"My parents have been sending all sorts of signals that they don't want anything to do with me for a while now," Draco spoke to Harry, but his words were for everyone at the table. He turned back to Andromeda and gave a shrug, finally turning on the affect of sarcastic lack of care. This wasn't good. He was going to shut down and shut out everyone, Harry included.
"Oh, do shut up," Draco groused before his mouth was on Harry's, one long leg swept over so that he could scale him, cage him in, steal his breath, make him shiver and curse and eventually, scream.
Draco's voice, following the explosive cry of something unknown in the distance.
"He's not lying when he says you have an eye," Hermione said as she sidled up beside him. He accepted the green-glass bottle of butterbeer she offered and they clinked the bottles together in a casual cheers. Harry gave a shrug and a twist of his face but didn't go so far as to argue the point. Instead of saying some garbled version of "I'm sort of proud of them but it seems egotistical to admit it," he necked half his drink in one go. June had descended hotly on London, and despite their best efforts, not him, or Draco, or even Kreacher had found a way to get the house to generate ongoing cooling charms sufficient to cut the heat. Instead, they sweat, (Draco referred to it as "wilting,") day and night. In response to the oppressive temperatures, they settled on spending as much time on the cooler, lower floors and out in the garden as possible.
He rounded the corner and nearly smashed face directly into the chest of Gawain Robards, head of the Auror Department.
"Philistine," Draco yelled.
Hermione snorted into her glass of wine. "Cold feet," she said. She and Ron shared a knowing smile—they'd been committed to one another already for a quarter of their lives and hadn't ever faltered in their shared belief that they would continue in that vein till death did them part. Where Envy used to flare up, uninvited and bitter, Harry now had his own warm, wriggly feelings of forever to deal with. Marriage was a lost option to him—he'd known that he couldn't entrap Ginny into a false union, and it truly wasn't an option now that he was out and older, and legally couldn't.
This was the game that the two of them had been at all day, a sort of cat-and-mouse, whereby Kreacher would find something he found too ostensibly Muggle and went about hiding it, and Draco, catching the absence, would call him out on it, and they would have a perfectly civil chat that did absolutely nothing to change Kreacher's behaviour.
Dinner passed pleasantly enough, the glow of the sunset throwing shadows on the faces of those gathered around the table. It was a truly full house, with every Weasley child in attendance. In addition to Percy was his girlfriend, a mouse-haired witch of diminutive stature named Annabelle, who seemed a perfectly good match for his stuffy personality. His departure from Ministerial work had done nothing to dim his love of rules; he'd made the move into financial services and apparently found great success working for the national wizarding bank of Belgium.
"So, what now?" Harry asked the quiet room, noticing the tinge of another daybreak through Draco's kitchen windows. It was that liminal time between days, the time they used to share solely while panting, skin slipping against one another's sweat, Draco handsy and talkative and Harry sated and scared for the messy ball of emotions fast developing. And now they were here, no rules, no clear boundaries.
Malfoy rolled his eyes, looking at Harry as though he were the stupidest animal he'd ever seen.
"I could hear you," he blurted. More silence he couldn't read one way or another. "I'll be good."
"Not so long," she answered. He took a deep breath and resumed staring into the mirror hanging on the wall opposite. The jagged scar on his forehead stood out more than it usually did, dark against the pallor of his paling skin. The radiance of summer was gone, and with it, most of his tan. The effect was startling, his eyes glimmering green as fresh shoots of grass.
Draco sped up as the alley approached on their right. "What do you mean,
“I’m eager to be on your case, and we’re going to figure out the best care plan for you. If you can agree to join me in doing that, I think we’ll get along swimmingly. Shan’t we at least try?”
anything about how Draco felt, but he hoped, and right now, he wanted to believe Draco; wanted to think that the sounds he’d pulled from him were real and not Draco taking pity on him. Draco kept talking, filling in the void Harry left.
good. Diagon was wonderful. I just—I know you and Pans are planning something for my birthday. It'll be lavish, and I love that but—photos. There will be photos. I've gotten lax, I'm hardly counting anymore, and with all the sugar lately."
Suddenly someone to Harry’s left cleared his voice and addressed him, “Hi Harry!”
“That’s my name, quite right, Mr Potter,” O’Malley smiled at Harry, “I hope you thinking of our sessions is not a bad sign?”
Indeed, there was a girl with a book in her lap sitting at the foot of one huge tree. She looked about ten years old, wore a white dress with lots of lace and ribbons - and seemed very impressed by Draco’s introduction.
– what a pompous expression!” She looked positively appalled.
Kingsley Shacklebolt did not seem too eager about their coming along but at least he did not contradict McGonagall.
Harry wanted to search for the Room of Requirements as soon as everyone had retired for the night and the school was quiet. But Kingsley must have called for a massive backup – all the corridors, every door they had passed were under surveillance.
Hermione gasped and stared at Harry. She looked terrified – which didn’t ease Harry’s mind one bit.
The table was set for two and some dishes were already waiting there when Harry sat down.
Andromeda Tonks visit was a pleasant surprise, although she had to leave Teddy downstairs.
“Maybe you want to lay some extra protection on the door to the second floor, Neville, as soon as you’re all set?” suggested Hermione, “Something password protected… the password for tonight could be – ”
That is why Harry was content with looking at Draco for the time being. Every time they locked eyes, Harry’s heart jumped. Draco’s smile felt like a promise. Harry was all at once delighted, excited and occasionally a little bit embarrassed about the recurring bulge hidden behind his sporran.
Draco cringed indeed and squeezed his eyes close.
“May I introduce to you the perfect costume for every Halloween party world-wide: dress up as Superhero Harry Potter!” Draco said mock seriously. “Extra bonus in your case: minimum effort required.”
When he passed the door to the pool area, he was surprised to find it slightly ajar. The pool was not supposed to be accessible for younger students without permission to swim unsupervised. Harry stepped closer to shut the door properly. Just to make sure not to lock someone in, he opened the door some more and peeked inside. He froze and his stomach clenched.
To Harry’s utter amazement Pinkie the raptor shot out of the painting and went for the vile wizard, claws first and with an ear-piercing shriek. The bird was huge, at least as tall as Taurus Malfoy and not only armed with an enormous beak and razor-sharp claws, but he seemed to be searing hot as well. The temperature rose significantly with his appearance and soon enough all Harry could see was smoke and a blur of flickering orange feathers where Taurus Malfoy had stood next to the window.
The other Healer said, “Well, that’s settled then. Madame Pomfrey, before we head back, we need to tell you about Mr Dumbledore’s treatment so far. Maybe we could talk somewhere in private for a minute?”
“That’s… wow – thank’s Ms Malfoy, I’d love to have a look at the young owls.”
Harry laughed. “No worries, Carter, it’s alright! Christie’s brother, huh? Well you must be used to her recklessness, I guess? Quite a handful, your sister… don’t get me wrong, I think she’s brilliant, a true Gryffindor.”
Whenever one of Harry’s friends felt up to it, they joined him in his new home and helped to declutter the old house. Ron, Ginny and even George sometimes just hung around to get away from the atmosphere of grief at the Burrow. Harry did not blame them for needing a break now and then. He knew better than anyone how exhausting it was to grieve and to come to terms with losses. His pain sometimes felt unbearable, especially seeing Molly and Arthur or Andromeda Tonks.
