Harry laughed properly this time. “No,” he said slowly. “Thank you, really, but I think that would just make things worse. Ron I can talk to. Robards….” He fell quiet. He pursed his lips as he stared distantly into the fire. Draco did not like the look in Harry’s eyes. Something died in Harry’s eyes that day. It would take a long time before they came back to life again.
“Makes sense. Not that I’ve ever travelled for any reason than to try and defeat Voldemort.” Malfoy flinched at the mention of his name. Harry hesitated, then apologised. “I shouldn’t have mentioned it,” he added. “I’m sure… the name must bring up some pretty nasty memories.”
“Don’t be daft,” said Ron, leaning his chair back on two legs. “I’ve known you and Harry since you were eleven, and we’ve been mates since Harry dragged you to that pub quiz ages ago. He might be oblivious, but that smile right then told me all I need to know.” He took another bite, then said around a mouthful of bread, “You’re smitten.”
Draco hiccoughed. He wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist and pulled them both back down to the bed, nestled in each other’s arms. “You cheesy git,” he mumbled into the crook of Harry’s neck. Harry chuckled. He turned his head and kissed Draco’s temple three times in quick succession, before settling himself back onto the pillows.
“I always want to see you,” said Draco. “Besides, you’re my only contact with the outside world. It gets quite depressing when all you have to talk to are the portraits of your great-grandparents.”
“Well, Draco,” Hermione said at last, after clearing her throat. “You definitely sound remorseful. I accept your apology. Now, my second grievance – does your family still own house elves?”
Harry didn’t know what to do. Or, rather, he knew what he wanted to do, just not what he should do. But in the end, his heart won out over their horrible past. He pulled Draco into his arms and held him as he wept. Draco’s arms wound around his waist, his forehead pressed against Harry’s shoulder, his tears soaking through Harry’s woollen jumper, the damp fabric itching against his skin. Harry rubbed slow circles on his back. He could feel Draco’s ribs, the ridges of his spine. He had noticed how sunken Draco’s eyes had become, how gaunt his cheeks, but this more than anything worried him, and that’s what it was – worry, not suspicion. He realised then, holding Draco in his arms, that he genuinely cared about him. They were just boys, playing at being men.
Draco looked up, his grey eyes filling with tears. Harry held his chin gently with one hand to keep him there and gave him a small smile.
Harry, unsure of how to respond to so much new information, frowned. “Why aren’t you married? Are you even seeing anyone?”
Harry watched with trepidation as Draco pulled out the tissue paper and picked out the mug from the bag. Draco frowned as he turned the mug over in his hands, then let out a snort of laughter. On one side was written in bold font: ‘Property of Draco Malfoy, Hands Off.’
Jenkins seemed to shrink before Harry, shaking in his boots. The other officers kept their heads down, but Harry heard a few chuckle and snort at the poor Junior Auror being picked apart by the great Senior Auror Potter. Harry took a sip of his coffee, never breaking his stare.
Harry scoffed. “Fantastic,” he said. He thought he heard Malfoy chuckle. For a moment, there was silence, just the sound of Harry doing his best to breathe deeply and settle the panic tightening in his gut.
“Why are you like this?” he murmured, brushing another snowflake from Harry’s cheek. Harry raised an eyebrow.
Malfoy hummed in affirmation, half his face buried in his pillow. “Exhausting, both of them,” he said, his voice muffled against the pillow. He looked at Harry with one eye. “You don’t speak French, do you?” he asked.
as she said, “Malfoy’s been paroled,” sunlight and confused relief. Malfoy’s expression was guarded as he met Harry’s gaze.
That Saturday, Gryffindor won its highly anticipated match with Ravenclaw. As Harry celebrated with his teammates on the pitch, he searched the crowd above their heads for one face in particular – but he wasn’t there. Harry’s victorious grin faded, and he turned away from his teammates, only to run right into Ron and Hermione running on to the pitch to congratulate him. They must have seen the look on his face because almost immediately their congratulations died on their lips. Hermione grasped his arm, concern in her brown eyes.
“It’s just – you looked… wistful,” Harry said as he came over to him. He wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist. “I didn’t know you liked kids.”
Malfoy’s eyes searched his face for a moment. Then he nodded once and pulled away, retreating upstairs to his bedroom. Harry looked down at the vial in his hand. He slipped it into his pocket, then joined Kellen at the Pensieve.
Draco stood in the middle of the living room, chest heaving, as he stared at the mess of shattered ceramic. He frowned as his shoulders slumped.
Harry went back to his office after breakfast, hoping to get some work done on a new lesson plan for the fifth-year class. He had only just sat down at his desk and opened his notebook when there was a knock on his door.
He watched their magic intermingle. His human’s magic usually slid off that of the other humans he brought into his bed, like oil and water, incompatible. When this happened, he would let his human know in whatever manner suited the situation. He flicked his tail, remembering the Horrible One, the human with such black deceit in his heart that Scorpius had made sure to defend his human from him, all the while making sure the Horrible One knew he was an intruder and not wanted. Luckily, it was just the one night – perhaps his human was smarter than Scorpius gave him credit for. Either that or Scorpius had succeeded in scaring him off. Then there had been the one with the nice shoes. Colder than a night in February, that one. Scorpius almost felt bad for wasting such a good mouse on him. But it had been for the best. He knew that now, watching their intermingled magic shine like the Northern Lights above their sleeping forms. He laid down, tucking his legs under himself as he kept watch over them. Yes, he thought, this one was the Chosen One. He could stay.
“You sure? Because I swear, I refuse to be anyone’s dirty secret, especially after your little show downstairs.”
“It’s not like I’m inviting you over to Pansy’s house for New Year’s,” Draco argued, sinking lower into Harry’s chair, looking like a sulking child. Harry let out huff and stormed back towards his room. He stopped in the doorway and looked over at his shoulder at Draco. “Come on, then. Let’s call your friends. Might as well get it all over with.”
He stepped inside, closing the door quietly behind him. “Malfoy?” he called, barely raising his voice to be heard. Malfoy’s head had snapped up at the sound of the door, and at Harry’s voice he spun around, his wand raised. Tears ran down his gaunt cheeks. Even as he clenched his jaw, Harry saw his lip tremble. Harry raised his hands in surrender, showing Malfoy that he had nothing to fear. “I just want to talk,” he said for good measure. He took his wand out of his cloak pocket, all the while maintaining eye contact with Malfoy, and instead of raising it in retaliation, let it drop to the floor with a clatter. “See? I don’t want to fight you. I just want to talk.”
Harry groaned and rolled his eyes. But when he kissed him, Draco could feel him grinning against his mouth, could drown in the joy of it all, their hearts beating in time. One, two.
Draco shook his head and stood, unfolding his tall, lanky form. His feet made no sound as he crossed over to Harry, coming to a stop a few feet away from him. Harry’s heart pounded in his chest. He couldn’t say why – if this was a ghost, he couldn’t hurt Harry, and besides, Harry knew, with an unexplainable conviction, that this man, Draco, wouldn’t hurt him, even if he was flesh and bone.
They grinned at each other. Then Harry leaned forward and pressed a sweet, chaste kiss to Draco’s lips, who smiled against Harry’s mouth and tried to hold him there. But then he pulled away and rested his forehead against Harry’s, their noses brushing. “First,” he said, “maybe we should brush our teeth, because I don’t know about you but your breath stinks.”
Luna greeted him at the door with her trademark dreamy smile. She was wearing blue coveralls and a yellow cardigan, her long hair braided in an intricate plait hanging to her hips. Behind her, the party was in full swing. Ginny’s teammates towered above their old schoolmates and coworkers, making Luna seem even more petite and fragile in comparison. But then he remembered what she had been through. What they had all been through. And he corrected himself – Luna was not fragile, she was stronger than any of them.
Malfoy Manor was situated in a large plot of land bordered on all sides by tall green hedges. Perfectly manicured bushes and trees rustled their empty branches in the breeze. Although it was nearly nine in the morning, the sun was barely up in the sky, the rosy light of dawn warming the frozen landscape. As Harry and Draco approached the front door of the mansion, Harry had to admit – it was beautiful, if eerily quiet. Draco went up the stairs to the front door, but Harry stayed on the gravel path, just in case he needed to make a quick getaway. Draco, noticing, looked back at Harry with exasperation.
The first week or so passed without incident. Harry was surprised at how civil the other boy was being but refused to let his guard down. He watched Malfoy like a hawk, all while pretending to ignore him, until he had his roommate’s routine memorized. They were both early risers, Harry for football practice and Malfoy for whatever nefarious reason. He would usually be drinking a cup of coffee from the Nespresso machine he had installed on his desk by the time Harry left for practice. As far as Harry could tell, Malfoy’s diet was eighty per cent black coffee and twenty per cent salad. Not that Harry watched what Malfoy ate at the dining hall. Since they were taking different A levels, Harry only shared one class with Malfoy: English. Their teacher, Professor Lupin, was new to the school but had apparently gotten the memo about the two of them. He had pulled the two aside after the first class and asked if their rivalry was going to disrupt the rest of the class. To Harry’s continued surprise, Malfoy had shaken his head.
Later, as Draco made his way back to the Manor against an oncoming storm, he could not stop imagining Nicholas Flamel writing a Christmas card to the simple man in the stone church. The universe, he thought, had a strange sense of humour.
“Oh, no one knows,” Pansy said flippantly. Draco’s stomach sank even lower. “There’s been a lot of speculation, though. Apparently someone at the
Harry didn’t move. How could Malfoy know? He held his breath, wondering if Malfoy would change his mind and leave the compartment. But Malfoy had locked the door, and now he was turning on his heel to stare right at where Harry was curled up under the Cloak in the luggage rack. Malfoy frowned, lips twisting.
Draco bit his lip but rocked back on his heels. Harry propped himself up, watching Draco slowly pull off his jumper, then the button-down beneath it. Draco tried to keep his fingers from shaking as he fumbled with the buttons. Finally, the last button was undone, and he shrugged the shirt off, tossed it with his jumper to the floor. Only then did he look up at Harry, his heart pounding in his ribcage.
Draco shrugged and squeezed them both a little tighter when Teddy let out a hiccoughing laugh. “I can help,” he said, “and by help I mean I can take you to all the nice shops. I’d have to see if Pansy’s busy, she loves shopping and she’d know where to go.”
Draco finally smiled. They leaned their foreheads against each other, Draco’s hands coming up to tangle in Harry’s curls. They breathed shakily, holding each other like that for several long moments.
Ron and Hermione were delighted to see Harry that evening. Draco stood to the side of the fireplace, out of sight, as Harry kneeled in front of the flames and greeted his old friends. Hermione had Rose on her lap as she and Ron sat cross-legged in front of their fire. Rose kept trying to reach out and touch “Uncle Hawwy” but Hermione held her back.
Harry chuckled. “You called me Harry earlier,” he said with half a smile. Draco pursed his lips but said nothing, waiting for Harry to explain himself. Harry sighed as he braced his elbows on his knees, his hands dangling as he stared at his beat-up trainers. “There are so many moments,” he continued at last, “where things could have gone so differently. It’s hard to know when you’ve made the right decision and when you’ve made a mistake.”
Draco did not know how his life had turned into a bodice-ripping romance novel, but he was not about to object, especially not when Harry bodily picked him and carried him into the bedroom, despite Draco being significantly taller than him.
“You absolute idiot!” she raged, stomping right up to where he sat on the antique sofa. “You masochistic, dick-headed arsehole!” She picked up a beaded throw cushion and began beating him over the head with it. He threw up his arms, but she only hit harder. “You bloody piece of –”
Narcissa laughed, or scoffed, it was hard to tell. “I apologise for my intrusion, it’s been so long since Draco had any company, even in only a strictly professional manner. I had to see it for myself.” She looked him over, her appraising gaze seeming to strip Harry down to the bone. He fidgeted, blushing instinctually. “He likes you,” she said at last. Harry’s eyebrows shot up.
Scorpius’s ear twitched. Draco gave a startled chuckle. He finally managed to move, setting the tray down on the coffee table and sitting on the couch next to Harry so that he could give Scorpius a little head scritch. In the corner of his eye, he registered that Harry had taken off his leather jacket, revealing his short sleeves and golden-brown arms. Scorpius stretched and settled down to sleep. Draco shook his head in absolute astonishment.
“I could ask you the same,” he replied. He sighed and crossed his arms, stretching his legs out under the table. “I’m okay. Getting back into work. Draco’s fine too, if you were wondering.”
Draco clutched at his cup of tea in his new ‘Property of Draco Malfoy’ mug as he looked into Harry’s sincere green eyes. In those eyes, Draco could see his past, present and future with Harry, clear as the day dawning outside their window. What he saw gave him hope like nothing else could. He leaned forward and gave Harry a lingering kiss. When he pulled away, Harry tried to follow, and he smiled, filled to the brim with happiness and contentment. He set both their cups of tea on the bedside table before straddling Harry’s hips and taking his head in his hands.
“Well, he’s definitely looking out for your best interests, that’s for sure. If that means I get the Teddy stamp of approval, I’ll take it.”
“Hermione’s going to France this summer with her parents,” said Ron. Harry hummed. “And Fred and George are still setting up their shop in Bristol, Charlie’s in Romania, and Bill’s travelling for work, so it’ll just be you, me, Ginny and Percy this summer. It’ll be pretty quiet, compared to London.”
Harry raised his eyebrows. Scorpius began to make himself at home on Harry’s lap, turning around to hit him in the face with his bottlebrush tail. Harry spat out a couple of hairs. He tried to negotiate with Scorpius, but it was too late – the massive cat sprawled itself across Harry’s lap, front legs tucked under his chest as he blinked lazily over at Draco, a satisfied smirk on his face. Harry blinked, shook his head, and resumed stroking the cat, whose purr sounded like a sputtering motorbike.
“The teachers know, for the most part, but there’s nothing they can do – not when it’s Dudley and not my aunt and uncle, you know? Just kids being kids.” He flinched when Draco’s hand came up in his periphery, but by the time he had relaxed, Draco’s hand had frozen, fingertips inches from the abrasion on his cheek. He wanted Draco to touch it, if only for the cold to ease the burning pain. Not for any other reason or anything. Draco’s hand fell away.
“Alright?” he murmured as Harry went to take the seat next to him. Harry nodded and gave Draco a small smile. As they began to tuck into their breakfast, Harry felt Draco’s hand give his thigh a quick, reassuring squeeze under the table.
Draco grinned. “You and Pansy would get on famously, Aunt Andromeda,” he said. Harry, still blushing under Andromeda’s questioning eye, ducked his head and tried to squirm his away from Draco.
“I mean, things were different then,” Hermione argued weakly as she flicked her gaze between Ginny and Harry. “Most marriages were arranged, and being able to annul them in a case like this gave some people more agency than they would usually have.”
Draco rubbed his face with his hands, his mind still catching up with reality. “Snake,” he managed, his hands now running through his hair as the nightmare replayed in his head. “Nagini. Wrapped around me. Was going to kill me. Bodies, everywhere, so much blood.” He jumped when he felt Harry’s hand on his back. When his hand began to rub gentle circles between Draco’s shoulder blades, Draco slowly relaxed into the touch. He slumped wearily. “It’s been so many years, but I can still hear him,” he murmured. Harry nodded.
Harry shrugged. For a long while, they held each other, so tangled together that they were like two trees that had grown together, bodies and roots, breathing in time with the rise and fall of the other’s chest. Then,
Draco frowned. He knew, in that moment, that Harry could commit murder and he would forgive him. Hell, Harry could kill
Harry chuckled. “I’ve seen more of your emotions in the last twenty-four hours than I have in the past seven years. Well, your emotions beyond being an absolute twat, in any case,” he teased. Draco frowned at this, and Harry leaned in to kiss his cheek. “Still,” he added, his breath warm against Draco’s ear, sending a shiver down his spine, “if you’re worried about what those assholes are going to say, don’t be. You’ve got me now. And Ron. And most of the football team.”
That was, until Blaise flopped down next to him on the leather couch in a flurry of robes and long limbs. Draco scowled at his easy grin. Blaise was one of those boys who even in his teenage awkwardness managed to look roguishly handsome, and that was the last thing Draco needed right now – a reminder of fleeting thoughts and strange dreams he forced himself to forget.
He stopped, pushing up his glasses to press the heels of his palms into his eyes. He took one breath, then another. He began to list the steps for proper broom maintenance inside his head. Slowly, the pain subsided, and his breathing evened out. He lowered his hands. When he looked up, Narcissa was watching him, her expression unreadable.
Harry thanked them all and told Ron that he would see him later, giving them a wave as Draco none too subtly began to pull them back towards their now unguarded door. When they were back in their room, Draco leaned back against their closed door with a long sigh of relief.
“I can only think of two other people who light up like that when they’re with each other,” she said with a tentative smile. Draco raised his eyebrows at her. Her smile grew smaller, sadder. “I’ve seen the way you two look at each other, especially when you think the other isn’t looking,” she murmured. “When you called earlier, I can’t say I was surprised. For Ginny’s sake, I hoped it wasn’t true, but…” She let out a long sigh. She closed the book with a soft
“Yeah, yeah, apparently Teddy wouldn’t shut up about him so she’s happy,” he reassured Ron. Teddy had been particularly enamoured with the tattoo on Draco’s arm, which he’d seen when Draco had come down to breakfast in his pyjamas. Ron put his coffee down and crossed his arms and ankles as he fixed Harry with a significant look.
“Why, Draco?” he asked, his voice a hoarse echo of the imperious sneer Harry knew so well. “You knew it was Potter. Surely you must have known. Why didn’t you say so?”
Harry laughed and shook his head. “Yeah, you kind of do owe me one for that,” he admitted. “Listen, I kind of have to go. I’ll call again soon, I promise. We need to figure out Christmas Day plans and all that anyway. Give my love to Hermione.”
“Hello, Harry,” she said. She accepted his offering of red wine and led him through the crowd to the kitchen. A few people called out to him as he passed, and he raised a hand, forcing a smile, promising to say hello soon. He wondered how long he’d have to stay to be polite. Half an hour? He could lie and say he had work in the morning. Already, everything was too loud, too much, too close. He took a deep breath in through his nose, the way his mandated therapist had taught him. Out through the mouth. Luna looked over her shoulder at him and raised an eyebrow.
Later, after they cleaned themselves up and lay in bed together, Draco’s head on Harry’s broad chest, Draco tried to hold onto consciousness but found himself slipping into a blissful sleep. Harry chuckled when he tried to stifle a particularly large yawn.
Draco frowned. “Shouldn’t I? I followed in his footsteps all those years. I approved of what he did before the war.”
Harry watched her scuttle off to the dorms with her plate of biscuits and chocolates with a pitying look. He barely saw her these days, and even then only briefly. Truth be told, he spent more time with Draco than with her… He looked over at Draco, who was sipping his whiskey again. In the warm light of the fire, his usually sharp features were tempered, harsh lines becoming gentle curves. Draco noticed him watching and lowered his glass, holding it between his knees.
“This is going to take longer than seven minutes.” He gave Draco a quick, tight squeeze. “I’ll tell you later. Come by mine after?”
Ron’s jaw hit the floor as Harry blushed furiously. Hermione put her hands over Rose’s ears, scowling at them all and hissing, “There is a child present!”
“Alright then,” Harry said, his smile growing crooked as he unhooked Draco’s hand so he could wrap his arm around the other man’s waist. He heard a couple at one of the nearby high tables gasp audibly, which only made him hold Draco closer. “I promise to stay by your side the whole evening.”
“But it was also planned,” Kellen pointed out. “The perp must have known they would all be here, that they could hit all of their targets within minutes and not be detected or seen.”
Harry chuckled. But then his expression grew serious again, and Draco’s brow furrowed. “So,” said Harry slowly. “Where do we go from here?”
about how many people we’re inviting to our wedding. The whole restaurant was staring at us.” He sighed, his shoulders slumping. “Every time we talk about the wedding, I become less and less sure any of it is a good idea.”
Draco. He saw the other Harry’s Draco. He saw all that he had been and all that he was. A sneering child with so much anger in the curl of his lip, a proud teenager with a straight back and hate-filled eyes, a broken young man with hollow cheeks and a Mark burned into the vulnerable skin of his forearm. A ghost, telling stories from his youth, trapped forever in a house with a history he could not escape.
Narcissa, startled at Draco’s enthusiastic outburst, cocked her head. “I see.” She looked from Draco’s blushing face to the arm Harry lazily draped over the back of Draco’s seat. Finally, she said, “Did you two coordinate your outfits? Because as a pair you are quite festive.”
“I’m going home,” he said without looking at her. He hesitated, one hand on the window frame, and turned back to her. “I’m sorry,” he said quietly. “I can’t give you what you want.”
“Yes,” Draco admitted, his eyes already on Harry’s lips again. Harry gripped his jaw, forcing him to look at him.
Ron brightened almost immediately at the mention of food. He sat down, eagerly craning his neck to see if he could see any servers with the dinner service. Hermione chuckled to herself as she took her seat next to him. Before they sat down, Harry turned to face Draco, his arms still around Draco’s waist while Draco rested his hands on Harry’s shoulders.
Harry’s smile grew small, and he looked over towards the living room door. “Right, yeah,” he said quietly. “Tea sounds great.”
“Yeah, we got you covered,” said Angelo Johnson. Angelo was in the same year as Harry and Draco and didn’t have the same cavalier approach as Christian did to Draco. He returned Draco’s polite smile with a similarly stiff smile of his own, which immediately relaxed when he turned to Harry. “Seriously, you know what to do.”
Draco tried to bite back the whine building in his throat. “So why,” he managed to gasp, while Harry made his way down his chest, “were you so,
“Well, to be fair, I never asked for the tea,” Malfoy pointed out. Harry blushed. “Not that I would ever say no to tea. And I wouldn’t say we are rivals anymore, are we? Rivals would talk to each other more than once every ten years.”
“Draco!” He smiled at the other boy, maybe a little too cheerfully based on the way Draco raised his eyebrows. “You going to Hogsmeade tomorrow?”
Malfoy inclined his head politely, his expression wary. “I apologise for my appearance. Potter didn’t mention you would be visiting. This whole situation must be very inconvenient for you.”
Harry gasped as he slammed back into the present. Malfoy raised an eyebrow, but his hand was balled into a fist as he leaned his knuckles on the countertop. Harry closed his mouth, swallowed. He shook his head as he ran a hand through his mess of black curls, rubbed at the back of his neck.
“I can also burp the ABC’s!” Teddy added. Draco gestured at the child as if he’d just won a court case.
Draco cleared his throat. Harry heard the soft ‘thunk’ of a water glass being set back on the table.
“Know what?” A prickle of unease ran down Draco’s spine at the shadows in Harry’s eyes. He recognised the emotions that flashed there – embarrassment, shame, fear, pain. They were the same emotions he felt when he looked at his Mark, even beneath the tattoos he had gotten to cover it.
Ron nodded to himself. He tapped the steering wheel with his fingers. They turned onto the drive leading up to the farm in silence. Then, Harry turned to Ron and asked, “Midsummer’s this weekend, right?”
Draco reached up and covered Harry’s trembling hand with his own, holding it against his chest. “It’s okay,” he said. He held Harry’s face with his other hand, brushing away the tears with his thumb. “It’s over now. It’s just a memory.”
since he and Ginny had split. Thanks to Ron, however, apparently the whole department now knew he was dating Draco, who, as they all knew, was a man. Robards sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose.
“Yes, my father may have deserved to die,” Draco continued. “But that was not for your brother to decide. He had cancer, did you know that? My mother told me last November. I hadn’t talked to him in years, not after everything, and not even that would have swayed me if Pansy hadn’t convinced me that I would regret it for the rest of my life.
She crossed her arms, not entirely convinced. Nonetheless, she nodded. “I’ll be in the U-bend,” she told Malfoy haughtily. Then she swept off with a huff, proceeding to dive straight into one of the toilets with a drawn-out wail that echoed in the tiled room long after she was gone. Harry shook his head with a small smile.
Draco grinned. “I love you, too, you dick,” he said. “But of course you have to be the first one to say it.”
“What’s this?” he asked. After all that trying to get the one memory, what more did Malfoy want to show him? Malfoy chewed his lip.
Draco made a rude gesture, which she pretended not to see. “Make your own damn tea,” he mumbled. He picked up his bag and slouched off to his room, where he definitely did not write several drafts of a letter before sending a simple – ‘Next Saturday. 8pm. The Drowned Siren. Don’t be late. DM.’ He watched his grey owl fly off into the late afternoon sky with a scowl. He regretted a lot of things in his life, but this took the cake.
Draco shook his head and ran a hand through his mussed up hair. “Jesus, I had no idea,” he whispered to himself. “God, what a dick I’ve been… all that time I made fun of you for being poor, I had no idea….”
“I would not be surprised if it was the Headmaster who assigned us together,” Malfoy said with a sneer. “He is all about resolving conflicts with love and peace, is he not?”
Harry sat down next to him, a puff of dust rising from the cushions. “You don’t sound happy,” he pointed out, his voice coaxing as he turned towards Draco. “What is it? I’ll still try to visit, it’ll just have to be during the winter and summer hols, though, when I come to visit Ron and Hermione.”
“You are aware of the staff vacancy,” she said. It wasn’t a question. Harry frowned and nodded. Slughorn had finally retired this past year, leaving the Potions Master position open again for the first time in ten years. If Harry was honest, he’d been dreading this conversation, the threat of another Snape always lingering in the back of his head. McGonagall adjusted her glasses and pretended to nonchalantly pick off a piece of non-existent lint off of her immaculate robes. “I’ve asked Mr. Malfoy to fill the position.”
Harry rolled his eyes so hard he saw stars. “I had no idea you were even here, you prat,” he shot back. “How was I supposed to know the great Draco Malfoy was a bloody Muggle barista?”
Well, damn. He willed himself to stand up straighter, to school his expression into something more neutral than outright fear. He had opened his mouth to sneer something with enough conviction to persuade her that she was the one at fault, not the other way around, when Harry blurted out,
Draco considered this. “Huh. Never noticed,” he said with a small smile of his own. “So much for my poker face.”
“I did this,” he whispered, his voice thick. Draco closed his eyes. In his mind, he remembered it all – the dimly lit bathroom, Moaning Myrtle screaming; his own voice as he, in anger and fear and mortification, tried to use the Cruciatus curse, knowing even as he cast it that he didn’t mean it; Harry’s voice crying, “
Malfoy hummed. “All the time,” he said. “I just got back this morning from Stockholm. I managed to finish all my paperwork early so my boss let me have the weekend off before I go to Morocco next week.” Harry let out a low whistle. Malfoy shrugged. “It’s fine. Used to be more fun. Now I’m just… tired. The work is interesting, and I enjoy it, but it would be nice to be able to stay in the same place for more than a week or two.”
– our main newspaper – that Harry Potter had married Ginny Weasley, the sister of his best friend.” Harry’s jaw dropped. Draco shrugged and continued, “I know, but in my world, they had been dating since before the war began. It was the logical next step, I guess. It’s stupid to think now, but in that moment when I read the announcement in the paper, I truly felt that I had lost… everything.”
Death had come to him in a dream. It was not a habit of hers to do so, and so Harry was startled to find her in the midst of a rambling dreamscape. He could not see her, exactly. She stayed just in the periphery of his vision, a veiled woman in the unbleached linen of shrouds.
“No, no, I understand.” Draco waved him off, looking up finally and meeting Harry’s gaze. His grey eyes were startingly clear. “I’ll start from the beginning, shall I?
In his office, he filled the kettle with water and lit the stove fire. Going through the tea-making process helped him wake up properly, reminded him of the less unpleasant parts of his childhood, of quiet mornings at 4 Privet Drive before the Dursleys woke up. Once he had everything set up, the kettle on the stove, he sat down in his desk chair with a soft groan.
“Because you love it,” Harry teased, scrunching his nose up at Draco with a grin. “And you love me.”
“Ron. He once accidentally blew up his aunt. I’m sure if Malfoy did try to hurt him, we’d be the ones helping Harry cleaning up his remains, not the other way round.”
“I have to go,” he said. He looked back over at Draco, who seemed to be trying to keep his face a neutral mask even as something lingered in his eyes. Harry wished he could stay, wanting in a strangely desperate way to know more about what happened to this man who felt so familiar to him. “Can I come visit you again?” he asked. Draco blinked in surprise.
“I see the school still lets you in,” Harry shot back from behind his book. Crabbe made a step towards him, but Draco quickly intervened, pulling Crabbe’s attention back to him.
“He didn’t come back to the tent that night, not even for dinner. My aunt sent me to look for him. It took me ages, but I found them, deep in that old forest near the campsite. At first, I thought they were fighting. David had my cousin pinned to the ground, but when I got closer, I realized they were both half-naked – and then I heard my cousin moan. They were snogging.”
“He’s an over-protective git, but we both know that,” she replied in an undertone. “Remember what he was like when we dated?”
Draco leaned back against Harry and gestured at Teddy. “Teddy wants to talk to us about something,” he said. “Go ahead, Ted, it’s okay.”
Harry was grinning at him. He wore a leather jacket over a maroon button-down, black jeans tucked into black boots, his Auror robes draped over his arm. Standing there, looking once again into those warm summer-coloured eyes, Draco realised how young they both were, how far they had come. Harry was talking. He shook his head and tried to focus on the words over the heavy beating of his heart against his ribcage.
Draco, of course, knew exactly how much could happen over lunch. He had once almost been disowned twice over tea. But the sarcasm was lost on Potter, who looked up with his puppy-dog eyes, his chin on his crossed arms. Draco felt the bottom drop out of his stomach at the same moment his heart jumped into his throat, giving the uncomfortable sensation of being gripped in a giant’s fist.
After, they both propped themselves up on the cabinets, their legs stretched out on the floor as they caught their breath. Draco tilted his head back, exposing his long throat.
Harry couldn’t help the cheesy smile spreading across his face. He set the watch down and wrapped his arm around Draco, earning a contented little hum as the other man settled back down to sleep. He could stay like this for hours, the morning sun warm on his skin, holding this man in his arms. But he also knew that they were supposed to be at the ministry by eight thirty to check in with Kellen’s team, and Draco would need at least an hour to get ready – he had said as much last night as he paced the bedroom incessantly until Harry had physically stopped him.
They landed with a pop in Draco’s entryway, Harry swaying up against him, maybe only slightly accidentally. He put a hand on Draco’s chest to steady himself, his other hand still caught in Draco’s. Harry caught his eye and smiled. Draco pulled away.
When Draco tried to catch up with him, Potter broke into a light jog, until they were chasing each other down the path, laughing and skipping just out of each other’s grasp. Potter probably could have run faster, he hadn’t even broken a sweat, but perhaps he noticed how much it took for Draco to catch up to him and stuck to dancing just within reach. They eventually fell back in step with each other, Harry grinning and Draco flushed and panting and beaming right back.
The priest didn’t seem surprised to see Draco when he did, finally, finish and turn around. He only smiled that secret-sharing smile and came over to his pew, his hands in the pockets of his black trousers.
When Malfoy came into the kitchen that day and saw Harry and Kellen standing by the shallow silver bowl on the table, he immediately turned on his heel and walked right back out.
Draco hesitated. Then, he blurted out, “Why did you break up with Ginny?” Only then, when the words hung in the air, unretractable, did he look up.
“What was that?” she asked, shouting over the din of the pub. They sidestepped a particularly rambunctious group of Hufflepuffs, edging towards the balcony with Blaise at their heels.
“Come on, it wasn’t that bad,” Harry said. He tapped Draco’s feet to tell him to get off, and Draco stuck out his tongue but lowered his feet to the ground. Harry leaned back against the desk and crossed his arms. “Ron even said he’ll give you a chance.”
Draco’s brow furrowed. “But I want this,” he pouted. His fingers plucked at Harry’s shirt under his grip. “Don’t you?”
Draco widened his eyes at her, shook his head minutely, trying to convince her that that was a bad idea. But she was already pushing him out of the booth, and Blaise was giving him a hand to help him scoot out and stand. He brushed himself off as he stood in front of Harry.
“This is different, sir. I know the victims, I went to school with their son,” Harry argued. He didn’t take the file. Robards sighed.
“I don’t get it!” he said for the fiftieth time. He and Hermione were in a quiet corner of the library, where Hermione had built herself a nest of books and rolls of parchment. She only allowed Harry’s presence because he was meant to be proof-reading one of an endless number of essays she had to write. But this also meant she got an ear-full of Harry’s whispered tirade against Draco’s sudden cold shoulder. “I thought we were finally getting to be mates, and now he won’t even look at me! He’s so dramatic, honestly, I don’t get it.”
Draco’s jaw dropped. Blaise nodded with a conspiratorial look. Draco swallowed hard and drew both of his knees into his chest. The image of two boys, almost men, snogging in the shadowed overgrowth of the forest – he blushed and looked away, something stirring low inside him. Blaise nodded again, his lips pressed into a thin line.
“What are you doing here?” Harry asked, trying to sound curious rather than demanding. A memory from three years ago flashed through his mind so fast he barely had time to register it – the smell of magnolias in Hermione and Ron’s kitchen, Hermione not looking up from the
“You’re here,” Harry whispered, his breath against Draco’s lips, making him shiver. “You’re really here.”
Harry sat back, rubbing away the tears and sniffling as he looked her in the eye for the first time that day. He knew that expression – Hermione’s gaze was distant, flipping through book after book in her mind, searching her internal library for answers. She blinked, her brown eyes refocusing. She smiled, and took Harry’s hands in hers, uncurling his fingers from their tight fist.
“I haven’t told them,” he said slowly, his voice low so only Draco could hear, “for the same reason we haven’t told the other teachers about…us. Because I don’t know what to tell them.”
“So sorry to interrupt,” he drawled in his old Malfoy style, earning a glare from Harry. “But it’s time we headed back.”
They moved so that they lay in the middle of the bed, Draco on top of Harry who was still just wearing a towel, a fact that both of them quickly became aware of when Draco rolled his hips against Harry’s. They both moaned at the same time. Draco buried his face against Harry’s neck, his breath hot against Harry’s skin. Harry spread his legs a bit to let Draco slot in between them, and felt the towel give way a bit. Draco pressed kisses against his skin as he made his way down his chest, taking little detours to lick and suck at Harry’s nipples, making Harry gasp and squirm beneath him. Harry became increasingly incoherent, babbling words like, “Oh God, Draco, yes, fuck,” over and over again.
Harry flinched. Malfoy’s expression didn’t soften, but he looked away, turning his scowl on the wood grain he was following with his fingernail. “Draco,” Harry whispered. Malfoy froze. Harry swallowed past the lump in his throat and continued, “You should know… I don’t blame you, not for anything that happened.” Malfoy scoffed, but he ignored him, pushing on. “We were kids, Draco. And if I was really the Chosen One everyone expected me to be, I should have tried to help get you out of that mess, not hurt you.”
Draco tried to smile. “Hello, Andromeda,” he said, surprising himself with his level voice. “I’m Draco. Draco Malfoy.”
“That bad, huh?” Malfoy asked. “You look like you were given the sack rather than promoted. What’s wrong, Potter? Catching dark wizards no longer suit you?”
Halfway through his speech, the guards had moved to draw their weapons, but the king waved them away with a discreet flick of the wrist, his eyes never leaving Harry’s face. His lips thinned, and a muscle jumped in his jaw. Harry only had a moment to realise what he had done.
“Do you mean that?” he asked, his voice barely above a whisper. Harry thought about it. To his astonishment, he realised that he did.
“Thank you,” he managed to say, his voice a little huskier than he intended. Something flashed across Draco’s face, but was quickly concealed by his trademark deadpan mask. Harry looked from his grey eyes, to his pink lips, then furtively down to the package in his hands. “I didn’t get you anything,” he mumbled.
“Well, looks like we are all done here!” he announced, clapping a hand on Harry’s shoulder, as if Harry had anything to do with Ivanovich’s capture. Harry frowned as he glanced at the prisoner. The man had thick black hair and beard, his dark eyes burning with vindictive hatred even as they scanned the room, looking for any chance of escape. When his lips curled in a snarl, Harry caught the gleam of two pointed eyeteeth. Dawkins stepped in front of Harry’s line of sight and he blinked, refocusing. “We got the kingpin and his business partner,” Dawkins was saying, his jovial smile not erasing the distaste in his blue eyes as he looked at Malfoy with his hands on his hips. “I can’t wait to get this one in front of a jury again, let me tell you.” He winked at Harry, as if he was in on the joke. Harry’s brow furrowed.
Harry, who had by this point finished off three ciders and was having a hard time focusing on Luna’s words, simply shrugged. Luna blinked her owlish blue eyes at him for a moment before turning back to his palm.
“No,” Harry assured him. “No, I understand. It’s, er, part of the job. Have to protect the witness,” he explained when Malfoy raised an eyebrow. “I’ll set up a cot at the end of the bed, and I can move the dresser in front of the fireplace to make sure it’s completely blocked. How does that sound?”
Part of the roof had caved in over the year. Some of the boards over the windows had begun to rot and come away. The ivy had almost devoured the entire front of the building, covering the stone in glossy green leaves and hungry vines. Harry hesitated at the window to the drawing room, his stomach twisting itself into a knot. He bit his lip. Then he tossed his rucksack in before crawling in himself.
He took a half-step back, just outside Draco’s personal space, but close enough that Draco could smell the pepper of his sweat, feel the warmth radiating from his body. Draco let himself glance down at Potter’s lower body, but quickly forced himself to look up so as not to linger indecently. He could still feel the blush creeping up his neck now. He pulled at his collar, and Potter’s eyes caught the movement, his grin becoming a smug little smirk.
Harry let out a sigh of relief. “Good. Okay. Whew,” he said. “You are very hard to buy gifts for, I’ll have you know.”
“Blew…up?” Draco eyed the simmering vegetables with a great deal more wariness than before. Harry shrugged.
Harry nodded to himself, his lips pressed into a thin line as he mulled this over. How had he not realised it was Malfoy’s birthday? It would have been in the file, should have been obvious… “How did Mal-Draco seem? Was he happy, excited? Or was he anxious, uncomfortable?
“I can never be mad at you, dear,” she said, giving his cheek a pat. “As long as you’re happy, I’m happy. But,” she pointed a finger in his face with a stern look, “if he hurts you, I am not afraid to give him the same treatment I gave his aunt.”
Draco turned his hand over to lace his fingers with Harry’s as he thought over his words. “Your eloquence is impressive,” he said at last after several long moments of silence, “for someone who has the intelligence of a teaspoon.”
“But then you became your own man,” Harry insisted. Draco scoffed and tried to turn away, but Harry held him tight. “I’ve seen you, Draco. All of you. You are not your father. You’re you. And I love you.”
“You see, many years before, when our parents were young, a wizard came into power who his followers called the Dark Lord. He believed that the magical world should be purified, until only those from Pureblood families remained. Many fought against him, and many died. Everyone thought he was invincible, and in truth he had wrought dark magic so that he was almost immortal. But then, there was a prophecy. It spoke of another that would grow up to challenge the Dark Lord, and proclaimed that neither could live while the other survived. The Dark Lord found the child who was meant to become his enemy. He killed the boy’s parents – two prominent members of the group fighting against him – but when he tried to kill the boy, the spell rebounded. The Dark Lord was destroyed by an infant. That boy was Harry Potter.
Harry shrugged with a bitter smile as he looked back up at Hermione’s face in the flames. “Oh, I just took offence to him telling me not to flaunt my lifestyle choices at work. I guess me having a boyfriend counts as flaunting, now.”
“What time?” Draco mumbled. Harry reached for the silver pocket watch on the bedside table, his thumb grazing the engraved ouroboros dragon, and clicked it open.
Before he knew it, the weekend had rolled around, and midsummer was staring Harry in the face. He woke up that morning in the room up in the loft that he and Ron shared on the old trundle bed that was much too small for him, the sun shining on his face through the window. He sighed and pressed his hands over his eyes to block out the light. There again was the pull, the string pulled taut, the cord that, if he followed it, he knew would lead him to that crumbling building in the valley. He sat up, his hands falling into his lap. He stared at them for a moment, at the callouses on his palms, and remembered an autumn night all those years ago, Luna holding his hand and tracing his future in the lines she found there.
“What’s that, a love letter?” Ron asked. Harry shook his head, pressing his lips together to hide the grin as he put the letter in his pocket to respond to later.
“I don’t know,” he managed to whisper through the knot in his throat. “I want this, but… I can’t… I don’t… it’s not working.” He buried his face in his hands, pressing his palms against his stinging eyes, because there was no way he was going to cry in front of Harry Potter. But then he felt Harry’s warm, calloused hands on his wrists, trying to pull his hands down. Then he was looking back into those green eyes behind the wire-rimmed glasses, at the gentle face with its scar and freckles against cinnamon skin, and before he knew it the tears were rolling down his cheeks and there it was. He was crying in front of Harry Potter.
“What if I said that we would destroy the memory once we were done with it?” Harry offered. “It would just be me and Kellen who see it.”
“We have to do something,” he said to Hermione as Julia passed them, sharing a sad smile with Harry as she did. “This has to stop. Now.”
Harry laughed, and Draco’s smile widened, pleased. After that, it was the same as it always was, their kiss forgotten. When the sky had grown dark and teatime was fast approaching, Harry promised to come back for Midsummer. “I’ll never miss another one,” he assured Draco as he hitched his rucksack over his shoulder. Draco watched him from the sofa, his arm on the back and his head in his hand. His expression grew sombre, and he replied,
“You know why he stayed with Ginny? He loved her, but he was scared. Scared to come out and say he liked men and women. Scared what the world would say when they found out their saviour was queer. He had survived everything else, but he had seen what could happen to those who were different, even in your world. He had so many expectations set on him, so many people looking to him for guidance, and he was so tired, so
He blinked. He was back in the present, standing in front of the new fountain, watching the water cascade into the crystal-clear pool. The words ‘Together We Stand’ shone back at him from beneath the water where they were stamped into the floor of the pool. He turned towards the voice and froze.
Harry padded closer until he stood across the kitchen island from Draco. He leaned forward on his elbows, never taking his eyes off Draco. Merlin, why couldn’t he have put a shirt on? This would be so much easier if Harry had a shirt on.
“I really thought I’d be able to do it.” His voice was quiet, as if speaking only to himself. “I thought the Cabinet would be a last resort, that I wouldn’t need it. Do you know what happens, when you send something through the Vanishing Cabinet when it’s broken? Sometimes it doesn’t come back at all. Other times, it comes back, broken.” He took a deep, shuddering breath. Harry drew closer so that he stood next to Malfoy, looking up at the other boy’s pointed face. Only then did he see the tears slipping down Malfoy’s cheeks. “I’m not a killer, Potter,” he continued, the words choked and ragged. “I’m not. I can’t. I’m going to fail, and he’s going to kill my mother, and then he’s going to kill
“Was that what you were worried about?” he asked. He pulled Draco back down to him with a messy kiss, licking his own cum from the other boy’s mouth.
Kellen watched them like a spectator at a tennis match. She raised her quill to get their attention and they both looked at her as if they had forgotten she was there. “Can I finish going over the security measures, please?” she asked, eyeing them over her glasses. Malfoy balked.
Harry stared at him. The words echoed in the grand hall, the only other sound the distant moaning of some underwater creature in the lake beyond the window. “You’re a necromancer?” he spluttered, momentarily forgetting all sense of decorum. The king let out a sharp laugh and waved his hand.
Draco ducked his head, wrapping his arms around his waist. It was all too new, too fragile. Yes, they had kissed that first day, but it had all been too much then, insurmountable. Yes, they had admitted to being attracted to each other, and yes, Draco had hinted that Harry had essentially ruined all other men for him – but no. It was one thing to admit to lust, and quite another to admit to love.
Harry gulped as Draco began to nibble and suck a love bite at the base of his neck, trying desperately not to buck his hips up at the pleasure Draco’s mouth was giving him. He groaned. “Draco. Draco – ungh – listen, we should slow down,” he tried to argue. Why was he objecting? Draco’s hands were tugging at his shirt, and it took everything Harry had to cover his hands with his own, stilling them and holding Draco back from tearing the shirt off of him. He managed to hold both of Draco’s hands in one of his while the other pushed Draco, reluctantly, back from sucking another hickey into his collar bone so that he could look him in the eye. Draco’s lips were glossy and bruised, and Harry had to ignore the way that made the heat pool in his groin. He swallowed hard and took a deep breath.
Harry waved his wand. The takeaway put their lids back on and set themselves into their plastic bags, tying neat little bows with the handles. He got up and walked around the desk towards Draco, taking careful steps as if he was approaching an injured animal. He stopped next to Draco’s chair, pushed it out and turned Draco towards him with gentle hands.
“You gave me more than that,” Harry said softly. Draco pressed his lips together and focused on pulling the tiny fragrant thyme leaves from their thin branches. “Why?” Harry persisted.
Harry’s smile faded. As much as Ron knew about him, Harry never told him about his crushes. Ron was good at figuring them out, though, much to Harry’s chagrin. When Harry had fallen head over heels for the head boy, Cedric, a couple years ago, Ron teased him relentlessly about it even though Harry had never said a word. Harry picked at the fudge in his lap as he chewed his bottom lip. He could feel Ron’s eyes on him, heavy and knowing.
“Spit it out, Potter.” But there was no malice in it, just fond affection as Draco gave him a small half-smile.
“Ron, you can’t do that,” Harry scolded. “Don’t make me put a ward up for you and Hermione, I keep that channel open in case of emergency, not so you can interrupt dinner!”
You’re hopeless, said Logic. They were temporary coworkers, nothing more. Once the case was over, he would go back to being a consultant Potions Master, and Potter to being his heroic Auror self. They wouldn’t need to see each other again unless the Ministry called him in. It was just business.
“Draco? You okay?” he asked as he put on his glasses and stood in front of the other boy. Draco looked up with a worried frown.
Malfoy’s brow furrowed. “Is that HR approved?” he whispered. It was getting harder and harder for Harry to hold back his laughter. He clasped Malfoy on the shoulder.
“Sounds nice,” Harry murmured, smiling against Draco’s lips as he leaned forward. “Can’t imagine you keeping bees though.”
Fourteen years later, a familiar face stood in the doorway to his lab, holding a file aloft like an olive branch.
Harry collapsed onto his bed and buried his face with his hands, pushing his glasses up into his curls. “What’s wrong with me?” he whispered into his palms, hot tears pricking at his eyes. “What the fuck is wrong with me?”
“How can I believe you?” Draco hissed. Tears began to spill, hot and fast, down his cheeks. He covered Harry’s hands with his, peeling them away from the sides of Draco’s head as he stepped back. Harry’s eyes were filling with tears now, sparkled mirrors. “How?
“Well.” Harry interlaced their fingers, pushed their palms together, fidgety under Draco’s gaze. “I was thinking, you could never get an apprenticeship with anyone because Robards had basically blacklisted you.” That had come out during the indictment, but apparently still wasn’t enough to charge him, much to Harry’s frustration. “But what if you apprenticed at Hogwarts? Slughorn’s not teaching – ”
Harry rolled his eyes but didn’t answer straight away. Draco picked up on his hesitation immediately.
“What is Weasley on about, Harry?” Draco asked, bemused. Harry blushed furiously as he struggled to get up and reach for his phone. Draco’s arm around him held tight, though, as he watched the smaller boy struggle.
Harry was glad it was dark so Malfoy couldn’t see how much he was blushing. He rubbed his sweating palms on his boxers before crawling under his own bed sheets.
“Right.” Draco frowned. He crossed his arms, his fingers tapping against his elbow as he narrowed his eyes at this distant Potter. Then he ducked his head, biting his lip as he inspected a hangnail on his thumb. “You want to talk about it?” he asked in as off-handed a manner as he could. In the corner of his eye, he could have sworn he saw Harry smile, but when he turned his head, Potter was still staring blank-faced out the window.
Harry looked up at him through his thick lashes. He saw Draco’s Adam’s apple bob, one of his thin hands coming up to rub at his eyes. Harry fidgeted with his hands, pushing his thumb against all the lines of his life written in his palm. “What if I love – ”
“Because I always am,” he said. He kissed Draco on the forehead before lowering himself down to cuddle against the other boy. He hummed contentedly as Draco wrapped an arm around him, pulling him closer against his side. They stayed like that for a little while in silence. Draco ran his hand up and down Harry’s arm and pressed his face against the top of Harry’s head.
Draco glared at Harry, and nodded his head at Wilkins the house elf, as if to say, “Does this look threatening to you?” Harry ignored him, and stepped up next to Draco to shake the house elf’s hand. Wilkins looked like he could faint as Harry clasped his tiny hand.
They didn’t get much farther that night, instead spending the next hour or so lazily making out on the bed, every so often chatting about one thing or another. Eventually they both drifted off to sleep, wrapped in each other’s arms.
Malfoy nodded and disappeared into the flat. Harry let his head fall against his crossed arms with a sigh of relief. Why had he come in the first place? The answer came almost immediately – to be polite. They were his friends. That and his therapist had told him to socialise more. It wasn’t being social that was the problem, he had pointed out to her, it was the crowds. She had frowned and told him to practice his breathing and try anyway.
Harry rolled his eyes. “It’s only been, what, six months?” he said with a forced smile. “And I can’t stay here forever, you know that.”
“I had been about to give up hope when an acquaintance told me he knew of someone who might have a supply of powdered Erumpent horn, and I’ll be honest, I was pretty desperate at this point. My client had said he needed the potion by the end of the month and if I couldn’t get it, he would find someone who could, and honestly, I can’t lose another client. It’s hard enough to be a freelance Potion Master, but trying to be a freelance Potion Master as an ex-Death Eater? Doesn’t matter what I do, people still don’t trust me. Anyways, I was at this dinner party Blaise was hosting – you remember Blaise? Zabini, yeah, that one. He’s doing pretty well for himself. So he’s having this dinner party, yeah? And I’m bemoaning to Pansy – Parkinson, yeah, we’re quite close – about how hard it is to find powdered Erumpent horn and this guy – I don’t even remember his name really, I think it was Murphy Evans or something, his initials were M.E. anyway, that’s how he signed his letters – he says he might know someone who could get me powdered Erumpent horn. We exchange details, and by the end of the week, he’s set up a meeting with this Ivanovich guy.
Spring was just beginning. The daffodils had emerged but not yet bloomed, and each sunrise grew a little warmer. As much as Draco loved this time of year, he dreaded the coming of summer. Cases would increase as people flocked to London for the summer holidays, but worse than that, the heat would make wearing long sleeves unbearable.
Harry raised his head. Draco’s heart squeezed painfully at the slightly unfocused look on his face. Gods, he really was blind without his glasses.
“I’m sorry,” he whispered, his green eyes warm and earnest. “I shouldn’t have done it, should have known better than to cast a spell without knowing the damage it could do. Darling, I am so, so sorry. But these scars don’t scare me, I can promise you that.”
“What?” he spluttered. “Hermione and I haven’t even met the bloke and you’re introducing him to Teddy? Merlin’s tits, he better not be a fucking psycho killer or something!”
Harry sobered his expression and nodded solemnly. “Yes, well, we do live with each other, so we get along just fine, you could say.”
He heard Ron snort behind him and grinned. Draco pressed his lips together to resist the smirk that threatened to spread across his face. Robards, however, was not amused. But before he could get in another snide remark, Hermione had gotten up and put herself in between him and Harry. She pulled her shawl tighter around her shoulders as she looked Robards dead in the eye.
Harry shook his head. “No, no of course not,” he said quickly. “Only the kitchen and living room are connected, and only to a few places.”
They were quiet for a long while as they drank their tea. Malfoy finished the plate of biscuits, so Harry got more. When he sat back down, biting back a grin when Malfoy’s hand shot out to steal a digestive, he came back to the same question.
“– but he would not see fit to love me, because that version of me was unlovable. I would know.” Harry made a noise of protest, but Draco squeezed his hand and continued. “After the war, I hated myself for everything I did and didn’t do. It took a madman living in my home, threatening me and everyone I love, reducing me to nothing to realise how horrible I had been. It took me being off my face drunk for a year and leaving the Manor to properly start over. It’s only been two months, but I think Harry would agree that I treat him well, and I have no intention of hurting him, even if he does snore like a lion in heat.”
Harry shrugged. “Your guess is as good as mine,” he said. He ran a hand up and down Draco’s back as they both considered their new predicament. “Oliver never had a boyfriend here… He was smart about that. We have the team….”
But Death was gone. Harry sighed and tucked the stone back into the pouch as he frowned up at the canopy above him. It was more of an answer than he usually got. Most times when he called on the stone, usually to ask for clarification on someone’s death, past or future, he got one-word answers.
“Yes,” Draco said, drawing out the single syllable, “because mistakes are liable to happen if you don’t. Like spontaneously combusting curry.” Harry only shrugged again with a charming little smile, as if that wasn’t a big concern for him. “What’s smoking?” Draco asked hesitantly, worried he might not want to know the answer.
The second the bedroom door closed behind them, Harry pulled Draco back into his arms. Draco melted against him immediately, bracing his forehead against Harry’s as they swayed slightly where they stood, just holding each other. Harry ducked his head to press a kiss against Draco’s neck, nuzzled the skin behind his ear as he whispered, “We don’t have to do anything, if you’d rather just talk, or just sleep, I don’t care. I’m sorry, I should have warned you, we can’t get her portrait off the wall, we’ve tried everything, I’m so used to it I sort of forget it’s there, but God, I should have warned you, should have said something, I’m so sorry.”
They landed on Draco’s doorstep. Draco steadied Harry, who had landed somewhat evenly, as he opened the door for them. Even before the door closed behind them, Harry was pulling him in for another kiss. A laugh bubbled up out of Draco’s chest. Gods, when was the last time he laughed like that?
Draco waved him off and busied himself with sautéing the onions. “I’m Pureblood, I’m related to almost every British witch or wizard to some degree. I’m sure we’re related if you go back far enough.”
Out of the corner of his eye, he noticed Potter watching him, but more than anything, he could feel the weight of his gaze. Even when Potter glared at him, as he had done so often over the years, his gaze was warm, like summer sunshine. Especially now, when it felt like Draco would get a sun burn from the heat of his green eyes.
Hermione nodded. She narrowed her eyes, tapping a finger against her cup. “Maybe you should start from the beginning,” she said. She took a sip of her tea and waited. Harry adjusted his glasses as he shook his head with a small smile. The tables had turned.
“Narcissa’s son,” Andromeda breathed. Draco nodded. “Gods, you are the spitting image of her, except the eyes.” She frowned. “But what are you doing here?”
“Sorry about this,” he said in an undertone. “If it makes you feel any better, he didn’t tell me he hadn’t told you I was coming until this morning either.”
“That’s sweet of you, but no, you’re a guest, go enjoy yourself,” she said. She flicked her wand and one of the fires on the stove went out as the pot hoisted itself up and began pouring its contents into a serving bowl.
Draco pressed his lips together, torn between laughing at the thought of the Holy Head Harpies bumbling around like drunken bees on their brooms and concern at the bitter edge in Potter’s words. It was no secret the two were having problems, not that Potter would ever admit it. He had been just as surprised as Granger and Weasley when they announced their engagement last year, especially since he, Weasley and Longbottom had spent their share of nights talking Harry down after a fight with Ginny. Draco wondered why no one had told them to end it yet. Or maybe they had, but both of them were too bull-headed to listen.
“Well, I hope he’s hungry, we have plenty of food,” she said at last. “He’s not vegetarian or – what was that thing you were telling me about, Charlie?”
He sighed as he unhooked the last stuffed house elf head from the stairwell. She was right. He needed his exam results to start Auror training, and his return would be good for Hogwarts, even if it was as the Saviour and not as Harry. So he reluctantly agreed. He would have preferred that Ron came with them, but he was busy helping George with Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes, and Harry knew that was where he needed to be right now.
“Exactly. Give it time. Let him get settled in. Remember how nervous I was when I started?” Neville said. “I almost forgot what I was supposed to be teaching on the first day, and it was first year Herbology! Basic stuff. You’ll see, he’ll probably relax a bit once he’s settled in, and then you can talk to him properly.”
“Fine,” he said. “Nothing I haven’t heard before. She must have spoken with my father, it’s like Easter all over again.” He tried to laugh, but it came out a sob. Harry reached up, his fingers brushing Draco’s jaw as Draco twisted away, stepping back from the other man. He shook his head, his smile contorting as he said, “I should go, I’m sorry, this was a mistake.”
Harry looked up from slicing the aubergine. “He’s your cousin, you could see him at any time, you know.”
“Just a little longer, Teddy,” said Harry, raising his voice over the thunderous rain. Draco held up his wand, casting a small Impervious bubble around the four of them. “Goodbyes take time.”
“What?” he said. “It’s true. And obviously, those days are behind us, blah blah blah.” Malfoy waved a dismissive hand and took a sip of his now cold coffee. “Besides, you’re right, this is the safest place for me. Don’t,” he added, catching Harry’s eye, “push it.”
Malfoy turned. He looked just as surprised as Harry was to see him. He held a glass of whiskey close to his chest as he leaned back against the railing, but any attempt to appear nonchalant was betrayed by his white-knuckled grip on the iron behind him. He was dressed nicely, much nicer than anyone inside, but not ostentatious – simple white button down and charcoal grey trousers, black Oxfords polished so well they gleamed in the light pouring from the flat. Harry felt shabby in comparison. Black T-shirt and jeans no longer seemed so appropriate for a house-warming.
“I’m not here to attack you, Malfoy,” he said, picking his words with care. “I asked you out because anyone with eyes can see you’ve changed, and I wanted to get to know you, properly. Is that really so hard to believe?”
If breakfast at Malfoy Manor was like meeting the Minister of Magic, dinner at the Burrow was like the start of term feast. The house was packed with Weasleys and their partners and children, all clambering and chattering over each other. A brief hush fell over the room when Draco appeared next to Harry, but after a few raised eyebrows, everyone carried on as if Draco had always been there. Ron, who was sitting on the couch with Rose balanced on his knee, frowned at him but, catching Harry’s reprimanding look, simply shook his head and turned back to his conversation with George about the joke shop. Hermione immediately descended on Draco, pulling him away from Harry to interrogate him about his research. Draco glanced desperately at Harry, who grinned and waved, mouthing, “Have fun,” as Hermione sat him down next to her and began talking animatedly about the recent study she had read.
“Your mother knows?” Harry murmured, breaking the comfortable silence. Draco’s hand paused in his hair.
The perfume and earrings were greatly appreciated. Narcissa had gotten Draco a pocket watch that also told the phases of the moon, which Draco marvelled over. Harry nervously plucked the tissue paper out of the bag and reached in. He let out a bark of laughter.
Draco looked at him over his shoulder with a small smile at the corner of his lips. “I watched it from here,” he said. His smile faded as he added, “The Cabinet’s almost fixed.”
had all but blamed me for – for it, and I didn’t – didn’t know where to go. Then I remembered when Yaxley found this place during the war, where you and Weasley and Granger were hiding out, so I came here, because I know from the family records that it belongs to you, but the house wouldn’t let me in.”
“Sod it,” Harry muttered. He pushed off from the counter and strode across the kitchen to crowd up against Draco, noses inches apart, so close Draco could see the golden flecks in his green eyes, the dark stubble shadowing his jaw, the pulse hammering at his throat. He cradled Draco’s head in his hands, his fingers threading into the short, silky hair behind Draco’s ears. “I’m going to kiss you now,” he whispered, his eyes asking for permission even as his lips inched closer to Draco’s.
Then, Kellen suggested that they look at Malfoy’s memory of the event. Harry was reluctant at first, but he had to admit, it would help to see the attacker for themselves. They were able to secure a Pensieve without too much difficulty. The trouble was getting Malfoy to give them the memory.
Harry’s grin spread slowly across his face. “What makes you think I’m straight?” he asked, setting his book aside. Draco looked taken aback. He frowned, marking his place in his book and putting it on the coffee table.
“Harry? Harry, hey.” Draco came to stand in front of Harry, his hands gripping Harry’s broad shoulders as he ducked his head, trying to look Harry in the eye. “Are you okay?”
That sent Harry over the edge. As he came pulsing deep inside Draco, Draco finally reached down and stroked his own cock, coming within seconds. Draco collapsed against Harry’s chest, covered in his own sticky mess, gasping for breath. Harry let out a somewhat hysterical giggle. Draco barely had enough energy to raise his head and stare at him.
Teddy gawked at him. He flailed his hands as he spluttered, “And say what? Hey, sweetheart, I like you and everything, but I also fancy McLaggen.”
“We’ve never talked about what happened that day,” Harry said, his voice gentle and low. Malfoy scoffed as he traced the grain of the wood with a finger.
Harry turned around then, properly, his back against the counter across from Draco, his hands braced against the countertop. He bit his lip, dragging his teeth against the skin, watching Draco watch him. Draco’s stomach clenched and twisted, an electric thrill running through his veins. Draco tried to clear his throat and swallowed again. Harry’s eyes tracked his bobbing Adam’s apple, his teeth sinking down hard into his lip.
Harry watched Malfoy’s Adam apple bob as he swallowed. Instead of saying anything, Malfoy simply nodded, and sidestepped out of Harry’s reach. “I’ll owl you,” he mumbled. Then he hurried off to the back of the café, disappearing behind a swinging door leading to the tiny kitchen. Harry buried his face in his hands.
“You must promise me,” said the aged sorcerer who taught him, “that you must never use this power, for good or for evil. It has driven people mad, and worse – it has made them greedy, driven by the belief that they can conquer kingdoms or even forestall death for themselves.”
“What do you think they would tell people? That you’re gay or that we’re… together?” Harry gestured between them ineloquently. Draco dropped his head again as he gnawed at his lip, his thumb pushing and pressing against the opposite palm.
“I would advise you not to say anything more, sir, lest you further incriminate yourself,” she said icily. “There are enough witnesses here that would be more than happy to testify that you are threatening and verbally assaulting these two men, and I for one am not afraid to take you on in a court of law.”
“You know, don’t you?” Draco grumbled. “What, you want my signed confession?” He rocked back onto his heels, out of Harry’s arms even as Harry unconsciously reached for him. Realising what he was doing, Harry let his arms fall uselessly to his sides, his cheeks blazing under Draco’s curious gaze. Harry let out a small huff.
Harry gave a sharp bark of laughter, surprising himself. Malfoy’s smile broadened briefly before collapsing in on itself. He went back to staring at his hands, picking at a hangnail on his right thumb.
“She and I broke up,” Potter mumbled. “Earlier this year. And, er, she got signed to play with the Harpies, so she’s not coming.”
When he had initially gone into lockdown with Draco, he’d had Kellen send Ron and Hermione a letter briefly explaining the situation with as vague details as possible, not once mentioning Draco’s name – ‘I’m protecting a witness, we are in a safe location, no visitors, contact can only be made through Kellen or another member of the DMLE, etc.’. Hermione understood all of this, she wrote, but still wanted to call and check in with her best friend. Harry had Kellen get Robards, and the three of them agreed – he was allowed one fifteen-minute call, so long as Hermione and Ron used the DMLE Floo, just to be safe. Their security measures had grown increasingly strict with the last set of attacks, and none of them wanted to take any chances.
Harry sighed and hurried after him. He caught up to him on the first floor landing, right in front of where Walburga Black’s portrait used to hang – it had taken a team of Curse Breakers a month to remove it. He grabbed Malfoy’s arm, pulling him to stop. Malfoy exhaled sharply through his nose, a scowl already in place as he glared at Harry.
“So, when are we meeting him then?” he asked. Harry flushed bright red. Here it was, the moment he had been dreading from the start.
Harry chuckled, the laugh rumbling in his chest. “After that? Yes, we are definitely going. You owe me.”
“And what if he does find out about Draco? What then? We can’t do anything to protect him if he’s discovered! We’d be sentencing him to die!” He didn’t know when he had gotten to his feet. Swept up in his anger, he paced back and forth in front of Dumbledore’s desk. “There’s got to be another way! Some way we can keep him safe!”
He would think about what Father Flamel said about belief and faith almost every day. He thought about it as he fixed the Vanishing Cabinet in secret. He thought about it as he pointed his wand at his disarmed headmaster and tried with all his might to say the words, to carry out the task. But in the end, he had been pushed aside, and it was Snape, not him, who killed Dumbledore.
Draco sighed. He bowed his head to Harry’s chest, his warm breath stirring the hair there. Harry knew he had won when he felt Draco give him a quick little kiss to the dip of his chest before rolling out of Harry’s arms. He sat at the edge of the bed for a moment, collecting himself. The light played on his back, highlighting the sharp angles of his shoulder blades, throwing the curve of his lumbar spine into shadow, his skin like soft marble. Harry’s ribs felt too small for his heart, and he bit his lip, trying to hold it all in. He sat up and shuffled over to Draco, pressing up against his back as he rested his hands on Draco’s narrow shoulders. Draco leaned his had back and Harry bent to kiss him, small and chaste.
Draco nodded, his gaze fixed on the tea in front of him. His hand came down to cover Harry’s on his knee, their fingers interlacing. Harry and Kellen shared a look. She nodded and got to her feet.
“That is for me to know and for you to find out. Which you will only be able to do if you get drinks with Potter.”
“You get the nightmares too,” whispered Draco – not a question, an acknowledgement. Potter nodded. “What are yours like?”
Potter rolled his eyes so hard his whole head moved with it, but there was a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. “You say the nicest things, you know. I’m just surprised, is all. You keep surprising me. Keeping me on my toes. It’s been a while since someone’s done that.”
Draco’s chest rose and fell with each shallow breath as he stood toe to toe with Harry. If he just leaned forward an inch – Harry seemed to read his mind and grinned crookedly.
“We don’t use that room anymore,” she said, her voice quiet. “I know that it isn’t enough, but I am…sorry, for what happened. For everything. I wish I could say we didn’t know better, but we did.” She let out a shaky breath. “We did. And we still did nothing.”
Scorpius didn’t like anyone besides Draco, didn’t trust anyone besides Draco, didn’t let anyone pet him besides Draco. Not even Pansy could get past his cold shoulder. All of his exes would attest to Scorpius throwing up in their shoes or leaving threatening presents on their clothes – one had even woken up in the middle of the night to find Scorpius glaring at him and growling as he lay on top of Draco’s chest, his claws digging into the comforter. Draco hadn’t believed him until he got in the shower and saw tiny little claw marks on his chest.
They would sneak out under the Cloak, a novelty that still hadn’t worn off for Draco – “They really can’t see us?” he whispered after they passed a patrolling professor who, before, Draco would have had to hide from. Not that the professors were as fussy about students being out of bed these days, but old habits die hard. Harry had laughed at Draco’s child-like wonderment, all warm so close to him that Draco couldn’t hide the blush that spread across his cheeks.
“Why do you have to be right?” he asked, staring at the ceiling. Harry turned onto his side, propping himself up on one elbow as he smiled down softly at Draco. He booped Draco’s nose, earning a smile in return.
“Draco.” Harry grabbed hold of Draco’s wrist. Draco tried to pull away, but Harry was considerably stronger than him. Stupid Auror training. He reeled Draco in with ease, slipping one arm around his waist to hold him close. Draco froze for a moment. “I’m sorry,” Harry murmured. “Please don’t go.”
Draco looked down at his tea with a frown, his heart plummeting down into his stomach. Harry reached across Draco and traced his fingers down Draco’s left arm, leaving goose flesh in his wake, before gripping his forearm and turning it up to look at the Mark writhing there like a trapped serpent. They both stared at it in silence. Draco didn’t realise he was crying until he blinked and the tear slipped down his cheek onto his arm.
“Now, Mr. Malfoy,” Dumbledore began, steepling his fingers together as he levelled his gaze at the young man. Draco met his gaze as evenly as he could. “What is it you want to tell me?”
“Lord Rookwood,” Draco called, his voice cutting across the uproar that had slipped form English to Elvish, likely so Harry couldn’t overhear. Lord Rookwood, an austere elf with a crooked hook nose, raised his chin in acknowledgement. “Tell me – Kirkton is on your land,” Draco continued, enunciating every word
Harry turned to him. It was like a switch had been flipped. Gone was the anger. His magic settled, his curls flopping down into their mess of wavy ringlets once again. He stuck his wand into his back pocket. His eyes were wide with concern as he made his way to Draco.
Hermione picked up her tea, took a sip, patiently waiting for him to continue. Harry picked at a loose thread in his jeans. His teeth worried the scab on his lip from where he had bitten so hard he’d bled, the pain grounding him, sending sharp sparks through his system. Pain he could understand. Pain was manageable.
He and Harry were in the Weasley’s kitchen, Harry peeling carrots as Ron chopped parsnips for the Christmas roast. Since they had become friends, Harry spent every winter holiday with Ron and his family out on their farm in the countryside rather than with his aunt and uncle. The Dursleys didn’t want him around, anyway. He had spent most of his Christmases before meeting Ron alone in his room, aka the utility closet they had shoved a mattress into and called a bedroom. He much preferred helping Ron and his family with chores around the farm, not to mention having snowball fights with Ron and his six other red-headed siblings and eating the fudge Mrs. Weasley seemed to have in constant supply.
“Well excuse me, I do apologise your royal bloody highness, but not all of us were born with one silver spoon in our mouths and one shoved so far up our own arse that it hits the first spoon. Some of us had to put our own survival and well-being ahead of learning how to talk pretty in court, all right? If you can’t handle that, then fine – find another necromancer to clean up your problem.”
“Maybe you’re right,” he said nonchalantly, “but truth be told, I wouldn’t be so sure of yourself. You were a pretty lousy Death Eater.” Draco glared at him, and he chuckled, the sound low and deep in his chest so that Draco swore he felt the rumble of it more than heard it. “Besides,” Harry continued, drawing even closer, so close that Draco could see flecks of gold and amber in those green eyes, “I have other ways of keeping an eye on you.”
Malfoy let out a long sigh as he finishes his story, like he had just finished running a marathon. Harry didn’t think he had ever heard Malfoy talk this much before. Unlike his usual slow drawl, his voice had been animated, hurried but earnest at the same time. For some reason, Harry didn’t doubt him. He considered Malfoy for a long time. Malfoy turned his head to look at him, searching Harry’s face, as if hoping to divine Harry’s thoughts from what he found there. Malfoy’s eyes were a warmer shade of grey than the barren walls, more like heather and wool than concrete and steel. Harry pursed his lips.
“Yeah,” Draco said. He bit his lip as he watched Harry’s dark form weave its way through the people outside until it disappeared around the corner. “I’ve only seen him like that a few times, and every one of those was disastrous. You didn’t hear me say this, but I’m scared shitless. Something really awful must have happened.”
If he was lucky, maybe he would get a sentence or two. But this – it wasn’t like Death to bargain. He turned over and tried to settle into sleep. There were more important things to worry about, anyways.
“Eager, are we?” he teased, even as Harry nipped and sucked love bites down his neck, making Draco’s fingers stutter and scrabble against him. He crowded Draco against the wall of the entryway, and Draco pulled him closer with a hand to his low back, dipping beneath the leather jacket. Harry hissed at Draco’s cold fingers against the warmth of his body. Draco caught his lips again, fingers tangling in Harry’s hair, wanting to taste him again. Harry, not to be undone, rolled his hips against Draco’s, both gasping into each other’s mouths.
“Why get more ink when you can get some?” Harry asked, waggling his eyebrows cheekily. Draco blushed and tugged Harry along the path.
Hermione on his case. He got up and followed Robards into his office, the eyes of the entire department burning into his back as he passed. His magic snapped. A few people yelped as they were shocked with a small, barely noticeable really, burst of electricity. Robards shot him a look over his shoulder. Harry’s shoulders crept closer to his ears and he did his best to look apologetic.
“For you, no charge,” he rumbled with a sly smile when Draco tried to pay. Draco stammered, flushing scarlet, and quickly turned away, grabbing Pansy’s wrist and pulling her into the crowd with him. Once he was out of the bartender’s eyesight, he downed half his drink in one go. Pansy raised her eyebrows at him.
Malfoy lowered his half-eaten biscuit. His lips grew thin, his grey eyes shadowed. He drew in a deep, shuddering breath.
Hermione pulled him into a one arm hug and rested her head on his shoulder with a sigh. “I know,” she said. “You and Ron wouldn’t last a day without me.” She smiled when Harry laughed. “If they wrote a book about our adventures, it should be titled,
“Hi, Tonks,” he said. He relaxed his shoulders and smiled at the young woman in the doorway. Her usually bright pink hair was dull and mousy, and dark shadows bruised the skin beneath her eyes. His smile faded. “Everything okay?”
“Lovely fellow,” she said at last. Harry let out a mirthless laugh, then followed her down the corridor and off the train.
Draco’s heart clenched in his chest as his nails dug into his palms. He wanted to turn around, to crawl into Harry’s lap, wrap his arms around him and never let go, just get lost in the smell of him, the feel of him. Instead, he stayed rooted to the spot as he asked, “Why did you do it?”
“No, of course not,” Harry said with a laugh, just as Malfoy said, “I can’t risk another mark on my criminal record.” Harry raised an eyebrow at Malfoy, who shrugged one shoulder.
“See you,” he whispered. He unlocked the door and let them both out, giving Draco’s hand a squeeze before he made his way out of the crowded café. Draco watched him go with a worried crease between his eyebrows. One of his colleagues, a precocious eighteen year old with the aesthetic of a 1970’s movie star named Abigail, followed his gaze as she came to stand by his side, balancing a loaded tray of dishes on her hip.
“I believe it was made for my father, King Lucius, third of his name,” the king said stiffly, as if adding formal titles would remind the man exactly whose presence he was in. He needn’t have bothered.
Harry nodded sheepishly. Hermione let out a long, bereaved sigh. “Good,” she said. “Now, can we please finish our breakfast in peace?”
Harry’s breath caught in his throat. Once his shock passed, he said, “Could have fooled me. It really seemed like you hated me.”
Before Draco could say anything else, Harry was kissing him. They rutted together, gasping into each other’s mouths, Draco slipping a hand down to the cleft of Harry’s arse. Harry pulled back with a laugh.
“Why?” Harry pressed. Draco bit his lip. It was supposed to be one drink, say hello to a few school friends, and leave. He didn’t want to be having this conversation, not right now, not ever. He kicked at a rock, watched it scatter into the lapping waves.
Malfoy did not look the same as he had five years ago. Then, he had been gaunt, all angles and dark shadows under stormy eyes. He had looked Harry in the eye and lied to his deranged aunt. He had saved them, only for one of his cronies to later almost kill them all with Fiend Fire. In the space between heartbeats, Harry felt the smoke in his lungs, Malfoy’s arms around him, the fire closing in as they raced towards the door –
“Oh, so you come to town to visit your friend, but not your dear aunt who has no one else in this world? You should be glad I don’t tell my sister what an ungrateful, entitled man her boy has grown up to be, with your shiny car and fancy job – ”
Harry groaned and leaned his back against the sofa cushions. “What if I don’t want to do that, though?” he whinged. “What if I just want to have a normal life for once?”
He walked over to where Harry was standing in front of the dresser. Harry – who could have stepped back and given Malfoy his space but instead found himself rooted to the spot – watched as Malfoy reached around him to pick up the watch and put it in his pocket. Then Malfoy stepped to one side and, picking up the orchid, shoved it into Harry’s arms. “You hold onto Amelia,” he said.
Harry chewed his lip and stared at his hands in his lap. “It’s a bit of a long story, sir,” he finally managed. Robards frowned.
“I’m a teacher, I have to like kids,” Draco mumbled as he swayed forward and melted into Harry’s embrace, his head on Harry’s shoulder as if it was meant to be there. Harry chuckled.
He dressed, packed a bag with some snacks and a couple water bottles, and grabbed a piece of toast for his breakfast. He left a quick note on the old kitchen table –
“You made me laugh when no one else could. You taught me that being gay wasn’t a crime or something to be ashamed of. You were there for me, even if it was only four times out of the year. And your Harry could see it. Amidst the bullying and all the times you fought, he cared about you. You were his enemy, sure, but he did care, and he saw you, after the war. He knew you had stopped believing in everything you were taught, he knew you were trying to do better, be better.”
“And what’s that, exactly?” Draco pushed. Harry scrubbed a hand over his face, readjusted his glasses.
Draco looked over at Harry standing in the stairwell. He was barefoot, his pyjama bottoms slung low around his hips, and wearing a ratty old Chudley Cannons T-shirt he must have gotten from Weasley. Draco grumbled out a ‘nothing’, lowering his arm to hide his wand. Harry frowned and watched him throw himself down onto the over-stuffed couch, glaring at the fire crackling in the grate. Draco didn’t hear him come over. But then there he was, sitting next to Draco with one leg folded beneath him and one arm braced against the back of the couch, his head in his hand.
“A lot of Pureblood families use it,” Draco said quietly. Hermione and Harry turned to stare at him. He swallowed hard. “Before a couple got married, the family would cast the spell, to see if they were soulmates or not. It wasn’t the only spell they conducted – Hermione’s right, things were different, they had spells to check if the bride was a virgin or not, if there was a love potion or some other magical influence, that sort of thing. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, they weren’t soulmates, but the tradition sort of…stuck.”
Harry wondered if Draco could feel his racing pulse under his hand. He swallowed hard and set his jaw, raising his chin a little in challenge. “I wasn’t able to save my godfather,” he said, “but I sure as hell can try to save you.”
Malfoy blinked. In that brief moment, Harry could see him try to throw up the neutral mask to hide his shock, but it was like the Secret Keeper spell – now that he knew what to look for, he could read Malfoy like a book. He smirked.
“You want to talk about it?” Draco murmured. Harry shook his head, tickling Draco’s jaw with his hair.
“No,” he choked out, pushing the heels of his hands into his eyes to stop the tears. “No, I can’t risk it. I can’t.”
Draco nipped playfully at Harry’s ear, making him yelp. “That settles it,” Draco said, “you’re definitely not going to France.”
“I’m not saying it again,” Draco said with a smirk. Harry rolled off of him, still smiling. Draco sat up as if to leave, and Harry shot out a hand to grab his wrist, to keep him there. Draco looked at him, confused.
Draco nodded. When his eyes met Harry’s, his heart filled with the love and tenderness he saw there. “So beautiful,” Draco whispered, brushing his fingers along Harry’s cheek. Harry smiled. He had to resist the urge to tease Draco, to ask him if he thought he was a pretty boy – this was not the moment. Instead he looped his arms around Draco’s neck to pull him down into another long, slow kiss.
Harry took a deep breath. He tightened his grip on the takeaway coffee, the heat burning against his palms. Right then.
Harry couldn’t hold it back anymore. He doubled over laughing, which only served to anger the king further. His cheeks went from slightly flushed to bright red, and he clenched his fists. He looked ready to burst. But, seeing Harry bracing himself up with his hands on his knees as he shook with laughter, Draco seemed to mull over his words. He pressed his lips into a thin line, which morphed into a tight smile, and then he was grinning back at Harry, a small chuckle escaping from his chest.
“Honestly, though,” Draco added, one hand skating down Harry’s back to grip his arse, watching in awe as Harry bit back his moan. “I couldn’t stop thinking about you either. Just wanted to see you come undone again, wanted to feel your mouth on me again, all of me.” He turned his head and nipped at Harry’s ear. Harry growled, pressed himself impossibly closer as he ground against Draco, making them both gasp and curse. “Gods, I want you so bad,” Draco groaned, tracing his lips along Harry’s stubbled jaw, kneading that wonderful arse just to hear Harry moan. He ducked his head to mouth along Harry’s neck, scraping teeth just to lick away the pain.
“It’s great to see her doing something she loves, you know? A happy Pansy is a good thing for everyone, let me tell you,” said Draco, taking a bite of his pizza. “She had an existential crisis about a year ago after working I think five graveyard shifts in a row, and I thought I would have to find a new flatmate because she was going to go run off to Iceland and become a sheep herder. Thank gods she didn’t. Could you imagine her as a shepherd? The woman wears heels when she wants to relax.
“It’s weird to see you so… domestic,” Potter said at last. Something of his old self sparked at that, ready to retaliate, but Draco was so tired these days, and it took so much energy just for him to smirk and say,
Draco folded his hands in his lap. “I’m surprised you didn’t wake the whole castle,” he said, aiming for teasing but coming up short. Harry grimaced and fell back against the pillows, one hand pushing into his curls.
“The war is over, Ron!” Harry shouted. “We can’t just go around killing people in their homes. That’s murder!”
“There’s nothing you can do,” she said with a small shake of her head. “Just make sure he doesn’t kill my grandson this weekend. Then I will hear what Teddy thinks of him, and you know Teddy.”
Harry took his time considering, looking him up and down. It was a warm late summer day, but Malfoy still wore a long-sleeve cotton button down and trousers. Malfoy stared right back, one eyebrow lifted in challenge. After spending so much time with him, however, Harry could tell that Malfoy was more nervous than he let on – his pale cheeks had gone pink, and he fidgeted with a heavy silver ring on his right hand as he waited for Harry to speak. Finally, Harry gave in with a smile.
He woke up sometime just before dawn. Draco’s arms cradled Harry against him as he stared up at the ceiling, strangely restless. Harry’s face was gentler when he slept – maybe it was the lack of glasses, or the way sleep erased the tell-tale signs of age, but he looked so unbelievably young. Draco pushed a few curls off of Harry’s forehead, fingertips ghosting over the scar.
Draco pulled back an inch to look at Harry. “They know?” he asked, more curious than anything. Harry shrugged.
The king draped himself over the throne, one leg slung over the arm of the chair as he lounged in midnight black robes, a single silver pin at his throat. His long, white-blond hair was tied in a plait, loose fair strands framing high cheekbones and eyes the colour of a storm-tossed sea. He smiled, pale pink lips twisting into a devilish sneer.
Teddy remained unconvinced, not looking up from his knees. Harry got up and pulled his godson into a hug. Teddy leaned his head against Harry’s chest, his narrow shoulders shaking as he held back his sobs. Harry raised his eyebrows at Draco as if to say, ‘get over here, you git, your godson needs you.’ Draco rolled his eyes back, letting him know, ‘I’m getting there, I’m getting there, Merlin’s balls, just give me a second,’ before getting up himself and putting his arms around both Teddy and Harry. He rested his cheek against Teddy’s trembling shoulder as he murmured, “It’s okay, we love you, it’s okay.”
Harry gestured at the evidence in front of him. “Files and evidence aren’t supposed to leave the DMLE, but given our situation, Robards allowed it, so long as Humphries was here.” Humphries thumped his bottle brush tail against the table, his eyes narrowing at Harry. Harry sighed. “And,” he continued reluctantly, “he’s also here to guard….well, us. There’s been other attack. Another former Death Eater’s been killed in his home.”
“Bloody hell,” Ron whispered, his voice echoing slightly. His eyes were as wide as serving dishes. “People really live like this?”
He heard the footsteps behind him but chose to ignore them, aiming another set of well-placed kicks at the chest.
Draco’s eyes were red-rimmed but clear, tear-tracks drying on his cheeks. He raised his chin, defiant and proud, a Malfoy after all. “If you were so sure it was Potter,” he said coolly, “why didn’t you identify him yourself? You didn’t need me. You – You just needed a scapegoat.”
They stood there in silence, Draco unable to take his eyes off Harry, who kept his gaze fixed on the dense undergrowth, almost like he expected the flash of a camera to come from the shadows.
It was everything Harry could have ever dreamed and more. At Hogwarts, he was safe. He was loved by his godfather and Sirius’s partner, Remus, a werewolf with a kind smile and a penchant for sweets. He had friends, a red-headed sixth son of a hedge witch and a half-wood nymph with a mind to rival the well-read sorcerers in their towers. He had a home… for a time.
“Draco?” he called. No answer. He went to the hallway and called again. Nothing. So he made his way up the grand staircase, past the empty rooms and the faded portraits of stern-faced men and women who watched him with pale grey eyes. He walked down the corridor to Draco’s room, where the door stood ajar. He stood outside for a moment, his pulse thrumming, unsure if he should knock or not. He pushed the door open wider. It creaked loudly on rusty hinges, and Harry winced. “Draco?” he called one more time as he stepped into the room. “You here?”
By the time Christmas rolled around, they had a solid draft to present to the Wizengamot. It had meant countless hours pouring over legal literature, past court cases and Ministry statistics. Countless hours of the pair arguing over bylaws while they camped out at Draco’s café in their off days, Draco secretly bringing them free refills as they worked. On his lunch break, Draco would join them and go over their drafts, pointing out gaps in their arguments and correcting grammar. While Draco was all too happy to help, he did have to put his foot down when Harry tried to work on the draft in bed. He had snatched the document from Harry and stuffed it under the bed, saying, “You have to turn off sometimes. Besides, how can you concentrate when I’m right here?” Harry had rolled his eyes but nonetheless took off his glasses and happily concentrated on his boyfriend. When Draco woke up at around four in the morning, his body heavy and sluggish from sex and sleep, it was to Harry reading the draft over by the light of his wand, mouthing the words to himself as he did so.
Father Nicola’s eyes widened. Harry’s brow furrowed as he glanced between Draco and the priest, confused by the introduction. Father Nicola didn’t seem to mind. Of course, he immediately searched for the scar Harry had long taken to hiding beneath his curls, but only for a moment. Then he clasped Harry’s hand in his and said that “it was a pleasure to meet him, he was honoured to have him in this humble church.” Then, winking at Draco, he added, “Although, I have to say, I do feel conflicted, since you were the one who destroyed my family’s claim to fame, as it were. Not that I blame you, of course, but Nicholas was quite put out by the whole affair.”
“Fine,” he said at last. He set the tray down on the table and sat across from Potter as they waited for the kettle to boil. Potter was watching him, his green eyes owl-like in their unblinking focus. Draco looked out the window, at the daffodils blooming yellow amongst the frozen grass. Potter followed his gaze. Draco took the chance to glance over at him, to see the Boy Who Lived Twice, the Boy Who Saved His and His Mother’s Life.
Hermione stared at him, her fork halfway to her mouth, scrambled eggs dangling dangerously from the tines. Harry sank down in his chair, picking at a loose thread in his jeans. He could hear Ron mucking about in the kitchen, getting second helpings of bacon and toast. Hermione finally put her fork down. With one hand on her swollen belly, she leaned forward as best as she could, trying to look Harry in the eye.
The dishes and silverware on the table began to shake. The smell of burning plastic filled the air as it crackled with Harry’s raging magic. He was distantly aware of the scrape of a chair as Ron stood behind him, but almost immediately, Draco was at his side, his hand on Harry’s shoulder, steady and firm. Draco’s own magic encased him like a silk blanket, dampening the electrical surge radiating off of Harry. The tableware trembled, then stilled. Harry closed his eyes for a moment. When he took a deep breath, his lungs were filled with Draco’s scent, citrus and mint. He exhaled slowly and opened his eyes, still glaring at Robards. Robards looked from Draco to Harry with undisguised contempt.
“So, she sold Malfoy Manor to the Ministry, and now it’s a museum, apparently, all about both Wizarding Wars. I hear it’s quite nice. Haven’t been, obviously. I’ll probably never see it again, if I’m honest.”
“Good morning to you, too,” Potter said with a chuckle. “I got it from the café you like around the corner. I know how much you hate chain coffee shops.”
Robards’ eyes narrowed. “Be careful what you are insinuating, young man,” he said. “You’re in enough hot water as it is, just bringing him here.”
Malfoy’s face remained a polite mask, but his eyes were a maelstrom of emotions – frustration, exasperation, relief – that he shared with Harry alone. He turned, shaking off Harry’s hand as he leaned in to whisper, “God, I hate you,” in Harry’s ear. And oh, there was that fluttering in his stomach again, he really had to lay off the caffeine.
“Go on,” Draco snapped, his voice cold. “Say it. It reminds you that your boyfriend was a Death Eater.”
They stayed like that for a long while, the sound of Harry’s soothing murmurs mingling with Draco’s sobs. By the time Draco managed to catch his breath and slow his tears, the sun had begun to climb in the sky. Harry pulled away for a moment to grab his chair and pull it around to face Draco’s. He sat down and quickly took Draco’s hands in his, hoping if nothing else to convey everything he wanted to say through the circles he rubbed into the back of Draco’s hands with his thumbs. Draco closed his eyes at the touch and took several deep breaths.
“Not my type, but okay,” he grumbled. He sighed and stepped away from Draco to pinch the bridge of his nose, leaning against the island beside his husband. Teddy sat back, his expression a mix of triumph at proving his point and the embarrassment of even making the point in the first place. Harry rubbed his chin. He needed a shave. “Right, well, you don’t have to tell her like that. She’s probably going to ask, but still – you like her, don’t you?”
“Yes, but Harry obviously does,” she pointed out. “And honestly, we haven’t seem him this happy in ages. Let him have this, okay? And if Draco does try anything funny, I’ll let you hex him, okay?”
“This is nothing,” he told the owl after he fed it a couple of treats and gave it a few scritches. “They don’t even say how they want to kill me. Ruins my tally, though. I had a bet with Potter that I would be murdered by poisoning, that’s the most popular one apparently. He disagreed. But you probably don’t want to hear what he thought.” The owl didn’t seem to want to leave Draco now that it had delivered the note, so Draco brought it with him to his next case. The Healer in charge of the clinic frowned at the scruffy owl perched on his shoulder but didn’t comment. For the amount he was paying Draco, he couldn’t afford to ask questions.
But Draco was shaking his head. “You didn’t deserve everything I did to you. Said about you. To you. I’m sorry. I was a dick. I was a bully. I was cruel and mean and… and you didn’t deserve it.”
“To be fair, you didn’t miss much, it was pretty shit,” said Harry. “Anyway, they’ve had this other professor teaching Potions, an Angharad Williams? No, I haven’t heard of her either, but apparently she’s quite good. And, well, I asked if maybe you could apprentice with her, and McGonagall said she’d look into it. I should have her answer in the next couple of days.”
Bathilde’s jaw dropped. Harry, blinking furiously, had turned a dangerous shade of crimson. Draco grinned. Perfect.
“I’ve been doing alright. Term was good, the first years are settling in well this round,” he said. “Listen, I – ”
Silence fell. The officers holding Ivanovich at wand-point exchanged confused looks. Harry raised an eyebrow, waiting for Dawkins to take the lead. When the man just stood there, looking like someone had offered him an ice cream only to drop it on the floor in front of him, Harry prompted him with a quiet, “Sir? We should be getting back to the DMLE, right?”
Malfoy laughed and shook his head. “Ah, the blessing of being an only child,” he said. “I think Mother had her hands full just raising me, I can’t imagine her having more.”
They took dinner in a private dining room in the king’s quarters. “Father would be scandalised.” King Draco chuckled to himself, gesturing for Harry to take a seat opposite him. “If he was alive, he’d host a feast, or at least a proper formal dinner. As it is….” He trailed off and pressed two fingers against his lips, gaze focused on the corner of the table. Harry shifted uncomfortably in his chair. But then the servants came with the meal, and the king shook himself from whatever reverie he had lost himself in. He smirked, more to himself than anything. “This is easier, yes?”
Harry flicked his wand at the antique dresser below the window and it waddled in front of the grate, obstructing it from view. Then he went about pulling an old cot bed out from under the four poster and setting it up at the end of the bed. “I’m going to go and get a pillow and some sheets and get ready,” he said once the cot had clicked into place. “I’ll set up wards around the room when I’m back – in addition to the ones on the house,” he added when Malfoy looked like he was going to interrupt. “And in the morning, the other Auror working the case will come by to take your statement. We’ll go over your protection plan then. Alright?”
Draco bit his lip and straightened his shirt sleeves. “You need to move the candle a bit to the left,” he said instead of answering, gesturing at the off-centre candle on the mantle with his wand so that it scooted itself into the proper spot. Harry rolled his eyes and came over to sit next to Draco on the table. A couple of students were playing wizard chess at the other end of the table – one, with his bright red hair matching his Gryffindor sweater, reminded him of Ron, while the other, an Indian girl with her wild black hair tamed into a ponytail, looked more like Hermione, with the determined set to her jaw. She wasn’t very good – most of her pieces had been decapitated by the boy’s two knights and nasty looking bishop. They noticed Harry watching and both gave him a quick wave and a, “Happy Christmas, Professor!” before turning back to their game. Harry waved back and smiled. Draco, meanwhile, was still fidgeting with his wand, unintentionally making it snow. Harry sighed and brushed off the mini snow piles from his and Draco’s shoulders.
That had been almost ten years ago. Three years after, he had won the Stone of Remembrance from its previous host’s spirit in a game of chess. He had not sought it out, and in fact had no idea the spirit that had been haunting the old mountain had held the Stone in life. She had been cursed to remain in the limbo between life and Death so long as she possessed the Stone, she told Harry as she handed it to him. She placed a skeletal hand on his shoulder and looked him in the eye – white Hel-fire orbs piercing into green eyes flecked with gold.
“Robards wants you to look at the Greek file again,” said Potter. He gave Draco an apologetic look as he set the file down on a clean lab table. “Apparently he thinks your report isn’t hard enough proof, although Merlin knows why. Your work speaks for itself.”
“Fine, recovering at St. Mungo’s,” he said, a smirk slowly spreading across his face as he attempted to sidestep past Draco to get to the desk. “Seriously, were those glasses?”
“Someone’s been reading my government and law books,” Harry mumbled as he sat facing Draco, pulling his knees into his chest. “And besides, I’m not going back, I’m staying with Ron, where do you think I go during the winter hols?”
“Normal people say thank you,” Harry said with a teasing smile. Malfoy rolled his eyes, but smiled back, small and sincere, and Harry blinked in surprise.
Harry smiled fondly at him. He sat on the arm of the chair and stroked the sleeping owl with one finger. The owl opened one bleary yellow eye, let out a low hoot, then went back to sleep.
The bedroom was stuffy and warm. Harry wrinkled his nose at the smell of rotting wood and mildewing sheets that hung in the air. He’d forgotten it, forgotten about the wrought iron fireplace cover, the marble mantle, the green velvet curtains. At first, Harry thought the room was empty. But then he heard a voice from behind him, and he spun around.
He leaned down and brushed a chaste kiss across Harry’s lips. Harry let go of his hands, brought his own up around Draco’s neck, pulling him closer as he kissed him back. Never let it be said that Harry took any half-measures – when he wanted something, he took it all. His stubble was rough against Draco’s skin, and Draco gasped, wanting more. He gripped Harry’s waist, his hips, tangled his hand in the black curls that had tantalised him for so long. Harry’s hair was thick and coarse and everything Draco had dreamed. As their kiss deepened, tongues exploring the taste of each other’s mouths, Draco wondered absently if this was what he had been looking for all along, here in Harry’s arms.
“So, before I went to Hogwarts, I lived in the cupboard under the stairs,” Harry continued, his voice forced into nonchalance, as if every eleven-year-old lived in cupboards. “They moved me into the spare bedroom when all the letters started showing up, so it wasn’t like I was in the cupboard every summer, but… that cupboard was my childhood. If I wasn’t at school or doing chores around the house, I was in that cupboard.” Only then did Harry look up at Draco over the top of his glasses, as if to gauge Draco’s reaction. Something about Draco’s pale cheeks and wide eyes made him say in a rush, “I’m fine now, obviously.”
Draco set his quill down with a sigh. He leaned forward on his elbows towards Harry. “You know,” he said gently, “you don’t have to marry her if you don’t want to.”
“Oh, well, that’s a bit of a long story,” he said. Harry snuggled in, his head on Draco’s chest, tracing patterns across his abdomen while Draco’s voice rumbled beneath his ear. “You see, my father had found out about me being with other men while he was in Azkaban. Don’t know how, I reckon a new inmate must have brought some gossip in or something, not that it matters really. He confronted me about it the last time Mother and I visited him. When I wouldn’t deny it, he threatened to disown me.” Harry raised his head to look up at Draco, but Draco smiled. “Don’t worry, he didn’t. Mother stepped in then, said that if he disowned me then he would have to divorce her, too. Mind you, I hadn’t told Mother either, but I suspect she always knew. In any case, Father did meet with his lawyer before he…passed, and apparently made it so that my mother inherited everything, not me. Not exactly disowning – in the event of her death, it would pass to me, but still. One degree of separation and all that. Anyway, he died and she got the Manor. But she couldn’t stay there, too many memories. I would find her sometimes on her hands and knees, scrubbing at the floors, and when I asked her what she was doing – this woman, who never manually cleaned anything in her life – all she would say was, ‘The blood never really gets out, does it?’”
There was a pause, and Harry thought Draco might actually have been offended. Then, Draco said, his voice muffled against Harry’s shoulder, “You know, people do call each other things in bed.”
“But how do you prove that they’re soulmates?” Harry demanded, returning to his earlier point. “The way I see it, anyone could just say they’ve found their soulmate and get away with it.”
He thought of Snape, the older man’s black eyes boring into his as he pleaded with Draco to let him help. He thought of how he had pushed his professor away, fear and suspicion in the guise of pride and arrogant confidence. He thought of his friends, the concern in their eyes as they tried to get him to come to Hogsmeade with them, to talk to them, to be with them. He thought of Dumbledore, gone for long stretches of time, his piercing blue gaze seeing straight through him.
“If it makes you feel any better,” Harry said, “I haven’t told my aunt and uncle. Not that they would care much either way, they already hate me, but still. They would probably lock me back up in my cupboard if they found out.”
He heard the back door open and close. The soft shuffle of footsteps, a huff of breath as a body was lowered to sit on the step, then another long sigh. He opened his eyes, but kept his gaze up at the heavens, half willing them to open up and rain down on them to wash away their sins.
Harry fidgeted with his cup. It was bright orange and emblazoned with the Chudley Cannons logo – a gift from Ron when Harry had taken the Defence Against the Dark Arts position.
I had this idea of Draco being a total Lord of the Ring's nerd in a previous fic, but didn't have the space in that story to really explore it there. So please enjoy me using my Tolkien knowledge in a Harry Potter fic.
It was Harry’s turn to blush. He hadn’t even admitted it to himself until Ron had asked and his first thought was of white blonde hair and peppermint. He set the fudge aside for safekeeping and buried his head in his hands.
Drinks with Harry Potter. The only silver lining was that he might be banned from holidays with his parents for the rest of his life.
“They don’t like me,” Draco stated matter-of-factly. “I would just ruin the holiday spirit by being there.”
Only when they needed to breathe did they pull apart, Harry to mouth along the column of Draco’s neck, Draco to lean his head back against the door with a whispered, “Fuck.” Harry sucked a love bite into the skin just above his collar, and Draco hissed and squirmed beneath him, his hips inadvertently rolling up into Harry’s, making them both moan. Then Harry was scrambling to undo the buttons on Draco’s shirt, and Draco tried to pull Harry’s jumper off, their arms getting tangled and giggling at their own eagerness. Harry, jumper gone, held Draco’s head in his hands and pulled him in, smiling against his lips as Draco’s hands explored warm skin, the curve of his ribcage, the sharp wings of his shoulder blades. He pushed Draco’s shirt from his shoulders, tossing it to the side. Draco frowned.
Robards was not completely happy to lose Harry to bodyguard duty. He could not, however, argue that there was no safer place than 12 Grimmauld Place, nor a better bodyguard than the Boy Who Lived Twice. So they had a team come by to reinforce the wards, and while that was going on, it was time to go over to Malfoy’s flat to collect some of his things.
“Normally, yes,” said Draco with a wry smile. “But I’m a special kind of ghost, I guess. Most of the time, no one can see me. But four times a year – Midsummer, Hallowe’en, the winter solstice and Beltane, as far as I can tell – people can see me. I become sort of… real, again. I mean….” He wandered over to the fireplace. He raised an eyebrow at Harry, making sure he was watching as he put a hand on the mantle. Then, he pressed down, and his whole hand went straight through. Harry gasped.
Draco stared at him. Harry’s words hung in the air. The word came to Draco again – insurmountable. But as Harry waited for him to say something, anything, Draco began to understand. Love wasn’t something you overcame, it was something you give, something you accept with both hands. It wasn’t insurmountable, no – it was all, and it was more.
Teddy nodded. His bubble gum pink hair turned slightly neon. “I haven’t told Victoire yet,” he said.
Harry couldn’t stifle his snort in time. Not wanting to stick around to see if he was found out, he booked it down the hall and down the stairs. Only then did he let himself laugh. Wait until he told Ron…
“Are you okay?” Draco whispered back as he held Harry’s face with his hands. Harry nodded, waving off his concern.
Potter raised his eyebrows, but nodded all the same. Draco led him down though the grounds to a little-known side gate amongst the hedgerows. Only when they were on the towpath, fields rolling golden on one side, trees rustling their empty branches above them, did Draco speak.
The day of the trial dawned bright and clear. Harry looked at the pale sky outside the window as he laid sprawled on the bed, running his fingers through Draco’s hair while Draco nuzzled against his chest in his sleep. One of Draco’s legs was hooked around Harry’s, his arms wrapped around Harry’s waist, not unlike a sleeping koala. Usually, Harry would try to extricate himself and start getting ready for the day, but today, he wanted a few minutes, just here. He stretched and settled into Draco’s embrace, his hand stroking down the other man’s back, tracing the lines of his ribs.
“Alright, alright,” announced Padma, getting the group’s attention. “Now that we have a couple new members, does everyone know how to play?”
Draco opened the lid. Inside, nestled against rich black velvet, was the silver pocket watch. He picked it up, cradling it in his hand like it was a baby bird.
Draco resisted the urge to roll his eyes. He sighed and took Harry’s hands in his.  “If I quit everything because someone made a homophobic comment, I wouldn’t have a job. Or friends,” he added with a slight raise of his eyebrows.
“I’ll be right back, I promise,” Harry said, in the same tone he used to reassure Teddy that there weren’t monsters under the bed. Malfoy only nodded again. Then, he asked,
Draco’s brow furrowed as he chewed. He swallowed and dabbed at his mouth with one of the thin serviettes that had come with the pizza. “What do you mean?” he asked. “What about me?”
Draco gave him a kiss on the forehead to hide his smile, but Harry only pulled him down to kiss him properly again. After a minute, Draco pulled away again with a laugh. “We’re never going to get to Hogsmeade if we carry on like this!” Harry shrugged. Draco smacked him in the arm.
“I will ask that the witness not – ” but the judge was cut off as George, straining against his restraints, snarled,
Harry bit back a grin. His hands came up to rest on Draco’s hips, and he looked up into the other man’s beaming face. “You deserve it,” he replied. “And I don’t want to push you to do anything you don’t want to do, so if – ”
“Which means that the ones not on the map haven’t been recognised officially,” Harry mused. “Most, like Swytch and Abredeen are simply a collection of farmsteads, twenty or thirty people at the most. But ones like Meadow Port should be on here – ones that used to be seasonal markets that now have permanent townships. Sir,” he added in an undertone, “I don’t know how to run a kingdom, and I’m sure as Hel am not going to tell you how to run yours, but something is very wrong here. If there are as many reported attacks as you’ve said, I shudder to think how many have not been reported, and why.”
Malfoy considered this, his hands dropping into his lap as he leaned back against the wall. He let out a small laugh. “Maybe. I wouldn’t put it pass the old codger. More likely he wanted us to sort out our little rivalry before we graduated, I imagine. That sounds more like him.”
Days, months, years later, Harry would still call him an arse for leaving his teabags in the cups littered about the flat, for the sharp-tongued remarks he made when he was upset, for being more posh than the Queen. And days, months, years later, Draco would still call him an idiot – fondly, always fondly – when he went for weeks without doing laundry, when he forgot the little things because time sometimes became slippery and indistinct and he would get lost in memories and old horrors, when he came home with a bouquet of flowers ‘just because’. And it took time, so much time, to relearn each other, to absolve their sins, to be together and not be haunted by their ghosts.
“Precisely. So why was Auror Weasley shouting to high heaven about your dating life for everyone from my office to the Department of Mysteries to hear?”
to.” Without another word, he got up and left the office, leaving Draco to shake his head at his retreating back.
Harry let out a punched-out gasp. “Oh.” He took a long sip of his tea that they finally managed to brew. “Oh,” he said again, setting his cup down as the weight of Draco’s words fell down around them. He searched Draco’s face. “Can I – I should go over to the Burrow, explain everything, but – can I kiss you again? Or – I just need to hold you.”
“It reminds me a bit of Hogwarts,” Harry said, catching the expression on Draco’s pointed face. Draco nodded. It did look like a slightly modernised Hogwarts. “It also weirdly reminds me of my cupboard from when I lived with the Dursleys,” Harry continued. He gestured with his glass at the sloping ceilings. “I think it’s how close the ceilings are in some parts. At least there aren’t too many spiders.”
That was it for Draco. He picked up the cup of pens on his desk and threw it at the other boy, who ducked just in time. The pens scattered everywhere and the cup shattered against the opposite wall, shaking the door in its frame.
“You hate it, don’t you,” Draco mumbled. He crossed his arms over his chest to hide it. Harry sat up and tugged Draco’s arms away.
Draco, poised over a simmering cauldron, pipette in hand, only raised an eyebrow as he extracted some of the potion from the cauldron before releasing it into a test tube filled with a clear solution. The liquid in the test tube immediately began to bubble and turn a nauseous green, emitting a foul-smelling smoke. Draco frowned. “What else do you want, Potter?” he asked before making a note on the case file beside the cauldron. Potter’s brows were furrowed in confusion when he finally did look up.
Draco nodded to himself. He added sliced courgette to the pan before filling a pot with water and setting it on the back hob to boil. Harry got up, his knees a little stiff, and walked over to Draco, leaning his hip against the counter as he tried to catch the other man’s eye. Draco’s expression remained neutral as he chopped up some mushrooms before adding them to the pan as well.
“It bloody hell is with you, but it’s with that son of a bitch too!” Ron spat. Harry felt Draco try to edge out from behind him, but just as he did so Ron whipped out his wand and pointed it over Harry’s head straight at Draco. “Don’t you fucking move,” he snarled through gritted teeth.
“Of course he does,” she said under her breath. “We all do. But I will say, he seems…quiet.” She glanced over her shoulder to where Malfoy hung at the back of the group of eighth years, his hands in his pockets and his eyes focused on the ground beneath his feet. Hermione frowned and turned back. “I will say,” she murmured, “I think he has changed. Hopefully for the better. Only time will tell.”
Harry ran a hand through his curls, rubbing at the back of his neck. He knew she was right. He had always told her and Ron everything, down to every nightmare and passing thought. But something told him that this was different. This wasn’t just fancying someone. It was like pulling on the thread of his life only to find that it was intertwined with another all this time. Startingly simple but terrifying in its implication, talking about it would only make it more real. Once he told her, it would cease to be a thought he could just dismiss or smother because he alone knew it existed. It would become A Thing, A Problem.
Harry, still cradling Draco’s hand to his chest, reached his other hand to push a wave of hair off Draco’s forehead. “What about Alec? The ex that gave you Amelie.”
He looked down, his hair falling into his face. The ends of his hair curled in a little, just brushing his high cheekbones. Malfoy raised his head and Harry blinked, trying not to think about how Malfoy’s hair looked like ripples of pale gold. “I came here for a reason,” Malfoy said, choosing his words with care. “I came because you were here.”
When Malfoy heard this last bit, he turned to Harry and asked, “Should I be worried about ex-girlfriends trying to storm in here?”
Draco snorted. “Maybe,” he said, “but I distinctly remember Mr. Weasley getting into a fist fight with my father in Flourish and Blotts when we were twelve.”
A slight figure, backlit by the rising moon, leaned over the balustrade, looking out over the grounds. Draco would know those wild curls anywhere. For a moment, Draco stood in the doorway of the stairwell, heart in his throat, looking at the man. He wondered if he should leave, find somewhere else to confront his demons, leave Potter to whatever he was doing.  Instead, he cleared his throat to announce his presence.
“I see who really wears the trousers in this relationship,” he sneered at them. Draco raised an eyebrow, but Harry was faster.
“Aren’t necessary, I assure you.” King Draco pushed aside his plate and settled back in his high-backed chair, studying Harry with his icy grey eyes. “You’re lucky that I find your uncouth way of speaking amusing. Did the people at Hogwarts teach you anything about manners?”
“Love you, too,” Harry chuckled. Then they both realised what he said. Draco sat up slightly, wide-eyed.
He turned over in bed, wrapping his long arms tight around his narrow waist. He could still feel Harry’s lips against his, the way his stubble had rubbed against his skin in the most delicious way, the smell of his cologne, black pepper and cedar. A distant voice in his mind whispered that yes, that did feel good. Yes, he did want to feel Harry’s arms around him, wanted to know what it would be like to fall asleep in Harry’s embrace, wanted to fill his senses with Harry, Harry, Harry. And yet, when the time had come, it had been like his body became a stiff marionette, and every touch was felt through layers of cotton wool. Something inside him had shut off. There was no instinct, no deeper need to push further. He knew what it was supposed to feel like, or rather, what he had been told that it would feel like. He liked Harry, he knew that. So why didn’t he want more?
Teddy slid down in his chair, his wiry frame spilling down towards the floor. He seemed to have grown several inches in the past few months alone, and the poor boy still wasn’t entirely aware of his own body. “You know how I’m dating Victoire?” he said finally. Draco nodded with a frown. “Well, I’ve been realising recently that, erm, I might fancy boys as well. And I don’t know whether to tell her or not.”
Harry sighed. “Let me get this straight,” he said as he walked slowly over to Draco with a hint of his old school-boy swagger. “You think I somehow engineered it so that I would spend eight hours alone on the train with you?” Draco tried to take a step back, but ran into the luggage, the edge of which dug into the back of his thighs. “That not only did I convince McGonagall to put the seventh and eighth years in Gryffindor Tower,” Harry continued, coming closer and closer, “but that Neville would set it up so that we would both choose the short matches and get paired together?” He stopped inches away from Draco, a dangerous smile spreading across his face as he looked up at Draco with a mischievous glint in his summer-coloured eyes. Draco frowned and tried to ignore the twist of arousal that had snuck its way into his self-righteous anger, even as Harry trapped him against the luggage. “Are you really that suspicious of my intentions,
Harry and Draco go to a Ministry gala. Robards is outnumbered. The boys get some good news, and Harry has a realisation.
Several people in their vicinity turned to stare at Ron. Ron ignored them, too absorbed in glaring in shock and fury at Harry, who slipped so low in his chair that he might as well have crawled under his desk.
Draco shrugged. “Sometimes. Not often. It’s more the thoughts that come, you know? The ones you can ignore in the daytime that just won’t shut up at night?”
Harry raised his hands in surrender with a grin. “Wasn’t going to say anything,” he promised. “But I mean, a ‘thank you’ and ‘you’re right’ in twenty-four hours? I’m honoured!” He snickered when Malfoy made a rude gesture at him. Kellen watched it all with an expression of absolute befuddlement on her face.
“Sure you don’t want the day off?” a voice boomed behind them. It was Robards. He clapped a hand on Harry’s shoulder, his dark eyes twinkling. “I think you’ve earned a break. Take the weekend off. We’ll see you back in the office bright and early Monday morning, alright? Take care, Mr. Malfoy,” he added with a nod to Draco. He gave them a convivial wave before disappearing just as quickly as he appeared. Harry let out a breath he didn’t know he’d been holding.
Malfoy let out a startled laugh as his smirk spread into a grin. “Auror Potter,” he drawled, “are you asking me on a date?”
He reached the doorway to the boy’s bathroom, ready to burst in on whatever nefarious plot Malfoy was up to. But then he heard it – sobbing. Not Moaning Myrtle’s wails, but the wretched sobs of someone who had lost everything. He opened the door, trying to make as little noise as possible, and listened.
“I think we should look into that source, sir,” said Harry. A realization had begun to form in the back of his mind, the pieces coming together the longer he looked at Ivanovich’s snarling face. “I think someone was trying to kill two birds with one stone, as it were.” Dawkins’ eyes widened, his ruddy cheeks blanching.
“Good morning. I left the coffee things out for you,” he said, gesturing to the jar of coffee and the French press by the kettle. Malfoy inclined his head in acknowledgement, still frowning at the cat. Harry followed his gaze and, with a laugh, added, “Sorry, I forgot. Malfoy, this is Auror Humphries. Humphries, Draco Malfoy.”
Draco pouted and changed the subject to avoid conceding her point. The last time someone had liked Draco for who he was, they had ended up on opposite sides of a bloody, merciless war. He wasn’t about to make the same mistake again.
Draco’s eyebrows shot up into his fringe. Harry dabbed at his nose with his bundled up shirt, checked it for blood. “Oh,” Draco breathed. “Is it?”
Malfoy always took the cup with flowers, even when Harry offered him a different cup, insisting that it was ‘his cup now’. There were only a few times when they missed their tea together – once, Harry’s class ran over and he’d had to send a quick paper aeroplane message to Malfoy, which he then had to teach his now very late class. Then there was the time Malfoy had a cold and was out the entire week, forcing a very reluctant Slughorn back out of retirement to teach his classes.
Draco couldn’t believe it. Potter had not only survived the first trial, but had done so in such a spectacular fashion that the whole school wouldn’t shut up about it. Now, as the day of the Yule Ball drew closer, all his classmates wanted to gossip about was who Potter would take as his date. Draco huffed out a sigh, his chin in his hand as he stared into the flames crackling in the grate. It was getting late, and the common room was quiet except for the murmur of small conversations in tucked away corners. Here, now, Draco could think in peace.
“Like a friend?” Harry asked. Malfoy nodded once. Harry smiled, small and compassionate. “Listen,” he began, picking his words with care, “say what you will about Dumbledore, but if he taught me anything, it’s that the most important things in this world are love and forgiveness. It took me years to fully accept it, let alone understand it, but….” He trailed off, looking down at the book in his lap, a biography Hermione had lent him on a witch who tried to fly around the world on her broom. “You didn’t turn me in,” he murmured. “At the Manor. You could have, but you didn’t.”
“Ready?” Harry asked after he rolled the condom on. Draco nodded, biting his lip as he watched with bated breath as Harry pressed the head against his leaking hole. Then he was pushing in, and Draco had to close his eyes. His mouth went slack against the pillow. Harry filled him completely. Then he kept pushing in, and Draco thought he would burst. He didn’t give Draco much chance to adjust before he was pulling out again, before he was thrusting in even deeper, again and again and again. All Draco knew was pleasure. He pushed back, trying to get the angle just right. It all felt so good, and yet…
“…Sir Nott down, now can we?” Harry bit back his triumphant smirk as Draco finally broke the staring match to glower at his polished boots. “We’ll travel light, bring only the bare essentials with us, and track down whoever or whatever is attacking your people. Alright?”
King Draco cocked his head, his smile twisting into a confused frown. “Not at all,” he said, “my people have a great respect for those who walk in Hel and speak with Death. It is no mean feat. I would know.” He smirked, settling back into his throne.
Andromeda sent Harry an owl on Monday morning. Harry, running late for work, brought the letter with him so that he could read it at his desk before diving into the pile of paperwork Senior Auror Singh had left for him. When Ron came over with coffee, he found Harry grinning ear to ear as he finished reading Andromeda’s letter. He raised his eyebrows and set Harry’s mug of coffee on his paper-strewn desk – seriously, how the man ever knew where anything was, Ron had no idea.
“Of course.” Harry shoved at Draco, who groaned and shuffled over to make room for Harry to scoot back. Teddy crawled in next to Harry, his small warm body fitting snuggly into the circle of Harry’s arms. Draco, not to be ousted, snuggled up against Harry’s back and wrapped his arm around the two as he buried his nose in Harry’s curls, breathing in deeply the smell of pine soap and that slightly spicy smell so specific to Harry, like pepper and clove. They fell asleep in each other’s arms, safe and sound.
Draco let out a huff. “You’re talking to a ghost, just apply the same logic.” He sat up a bit. “What if I told you things about my – about Potter, that you haven’t told me about yourself?”
“No you won’t,” she intoned in a sing-song voice. She turned the page with a smirk as Draco got to his feet, cursing under his breath. “If you’re going into the kitchen, could you make me a cup of tea? Thanks, babe.”
He gestured for Malfoy to stay put and cast a quick revealing spell. Nothing. He did a diagnostic spell, checking for any dark magic. Nothing. He made his way further into the flat, opening the door to a small bathroom and poking his head in, repeating the spells. Still clear.
“Dork,” he muttered. Harry rubbed his hand up and down Draco’s waist. Draco closed his eyes at the touch and snuggled closer. They laid like that for a good long while. Harry felt himself slipping off to sleep when he heard Draco ask, “Do we have to go to the Weasley’s tonight? Couldn’t we just stay here?”
– they did their best to laugh it off. The next time, though, someone tried to hex Draco. So they stuck to Muggle neighbourhoods. Then Draco started getting death threats. Harry made him report them to the Ministry, but it got harder and harder for Draco to leave his flat, let along get consulting work. It got to the point where a date consisted of the two of them eating takeaway on Harry’s couch.
Malfoy was already in the room when Harry arrived. He was standing looking out the window over the grounds and hadn’t heard Harry come in. Harry sized him up – Malfoy was taller than him, thin and lean, all angles, grey eyes and white blonde hair. His clothes fit him well and his shoes were always polished. He was the picture of pristine posh. Harry bit the inside of his cheek. In another universe, he would be attracted to the bastard. He would never admit that, though, not to himself and definitely not to Malfoy. He tossed his duffel bag on the bed that hadn’t been claimed by Malfoy’s leather-bound luggage. Malfoy turned to look over his shoulder at Harry.
“I’m out of ink, Potter, I’m not getting distracted by you and missing my chance to get more.” He stepped out of Harry’s embrace, his hand finding Harry’s as they wove their fingers together with matching besotted smiles.
“Am I bad person for not wanting a big wedding?” Potter asked, his chin digging into his arm as he spoke. Draco resisted the immediate urge to swaddle him in a blanket and hold him close, instead allowing himself to reassure Potter that “of course he wasn’t a bad person, he was Harry bloody Potter, it was physically and patently impossible for him to be a bad person.”
His skin was the colour of porcelain. His white-blonde hair was swept back off his forehead. He wore a cotton button-down, tailored perfectly for his thin frame, and dark trousers. He was all sharp angles and soft shadows, grey eyes watching Harry from back-lit shadows.
“It’s none of my business, Potter, you know that,” Robards said quietly. He lowered his hand and considered his next words carefully, crossing his legs as he frowned at his folded hands on his knee. “I should let you know that, while it is perfectly legal for you to have, er, homosexual relations – again, whatever you do in your private life is your business – I would, er, rather you not flaunt it about in the workplace, if you understand what I mean.”
Harry reached over and put his hand on Draco’s crossed arms with a gentle smile. “You don’t have to come if it makes you uncomfortable,” he assured him. “But if you decide to come, so long as you let them all know how sorry you are for everything, well, Mrs. Weasley never gives up a chance to be a mother. Trust me. The woman’s practically adopted me.”
Hermione sighed and shook her head. “That’s easy for you to say,” she retorted, but there was no malice in her words, just a grateful smile. “But you’re right. I just have to finish this essay first…. I’ll try to sleep, I promise. Night Harry. Malfoy.”
Harry moved his last box into his new flat, dropping it onto his unmade bed. The building was relatively new, and the flat still had that new paint smell. Harry had been pleasantly surprised to find it in the middle of Camden, where most of the buildings that claimed to be ‘new’ were from the sixties and still smelled like it. Sure, it was a little more expensive than he would like, but he had a part-time job working at the café near his old dorm, and since his scholarship covered his tuition, all he had to worry about was the living expenses. He looked around the room, nodding to himself. He would have to find a desk, and a chair, maybe a bookcase and a nightstand, but at least there was a mattress and a functioning toilet he only had to share with three other people – two girls from his course, Pansy and Padma, and a bloke named Blaise that Pansy had assured him she was not sleeping with. The kitchen had more than two hobs, and a washing machine that wouldn’t eat all of his coins. He smiled. He felt like a real adult for the first time in his life. A real adult who was starving after moving all of his belongings across London.
“Draco, we were eleven,” Harry said with a small, disbelieving laugh. Draco smiled a bit sheepishly and shrugged.
Harry shook his head and shrugged. “They don’t really care,” he said, his voice small and quiet. Ron and Hermione knew all about Harry’s living situation, and since they befriended each other, the attacks had lessened somewhat. But the truth was, they couldn’t be with him all the time. Draco leaned forward, his elbows on his knees, as he tried to get Harry to look at him.
Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist, pulling the other man tight against him. “I’ll keep that in mind,” he murmured, tilting his chin up to meet Draco’s kiss half-way. “Happy Christmas, Draco.”
Since there had been so few students returning, Headmistress McGonagall in her infinite wisdom had decided to arrange them based on year rather than House, which was how the seventh and eighth years were relocated to Gryffindor Tower. Draco suspected favouritism. They had been left to their own devices as to how to divide the rooms amongst themselves, with Hermione in charge of organising the girls and Neville of the boys. There were seven rooms and eighteen boys – eight seventh years and ten eighth years. Draco couldn’t help but notice that he was the only Slytherin boy – Daphne and Astoria Greengrass had also returned, but they couldn’t help him in this particular situation. The seventh years had agreed to splitting the first two rooms between them, after almost an hour was spent trying to do the maths, something none of them quite understood. That just left the eighth years and five rooms.
Lucius flinched. His hands fell to his sides, clenching into fists. He opened and closed his mouth a couple times, but no sound came out. He cleared his throat. “You didn’t answer my question,” he said at last. Draco shrugged one shoulder, his eyes like ice cutting into his father, who couldn’t meet his gaze.
“Or we could split it so Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws get one room, and the Gryffindors get the other,” Zacharias interjected. He smirked as he glanced over at Malfoy, who had perched on the arm of a sofa and didn’t seem to be paying much attention to the discussion. “Which means you get to keep an eye on the Death Eater.”
A wave of white-gold hair fell into Malfoy’s surprised face. Absent-mindedly, Harry pushed it off his forehead, tucking it behind his ear. Malfoy’s blush went from peony pink to a deep scarlet. Harry chuckled again, his hand falling to his side. “You didn’t turn me in, you practically gave me the wands… If I didn’t know any better, Malfoy, I would say you switched sides that day in the Manor.”
“Why can’t you leave well enough alone?” he demanded. “Just go back to your Muggle relatives and stay out of trouble for once.”
subscription so I could keep up to date on what was happening in the magical world, so yes, I also know about your family’s… situation.”
“Turn over,” he whispered against the skin. Draco nodded quickly. Harry let go of his ankle so that Draco could roll over onto his belly, the friction of the sheets against his neglected cock pulling a moan out of his throat. Harry’s hands ran up the back of his legs. He knelt between them, gripping Draco’s arse as he kissed down the crease. When Harry’s tongue skated across his hole, Draco almost sobbed.
“Good. Now that that’s settled,” she sat back down, exhausted. “I’m going on maternity leave in a few weeks, and I would appreciate it if you two were on your best behaviours rather than going at it like a bunch of knuckle-headed teenagers. But I must warn you, Harry,” she added, pointing a warning finger at him, “if I even get the slightest hint that Malfoy is up to no good, I won’t hesitate. You understand?”
Harry sighed. “You know I do,” he said. He tried to keep his voice level as he continued, “But you also know that this isn’t going to make you less upset.”
Draco nodded, then realised the priest couldn’t see him. “Yes,” he said. “I think I do.” He hesitated, then asked, “Do you mind if I ask what your family name is?”
“Teddy has something else he wants to talk to us about,” Draco told him, leaning around Teddy to look meaningfully at Harry. Harry raised his eyebrows.
“Because I’m cute, and fit, and an absolute delight?” Harry offered. Draco scowled, his nose scrunching up adorably. Harry gave him a little squeeze, his grin softening. “And you like me because I make sure you have enough time to get ready for this hearing. And because I’ll go make breakfast.”
He had just put his hand on the drawer handle when he heard Draco’s voice down the hall, speaking in hurried French. Harry jumped and scampered over to his side of the room, trying to look like he had just been in the process of unpacking when Draco showed up. He needn’t have bothered. Draco gave him a quick nod when he came in, closing the door behind him, before continuing his conversation on the phone as he dropped his luggage on his bed. By the time he hung up, Harry had put away his clothes and toiletries and was playing on his phone as he sat on his bed. Draco set his phone down with a sigh and opened his luggage.
Harry grinned. “France sounds nice,” he said. He crawled over to Draco, straddling Draco’s lap and tilting Draco’s chin up to look him in the eye. Draco found that without even thinking about he had put his hands on Harry’s waist, as if it was the most natural thing in the world. “So we’re in agreement?” Harry asked. “We’ll write to
“Again, coolest kid ever. I couldn’t burp the ABC’s when I was that age, Father would have disowned me.”
The next morning, Malfoy stumbled into the kitchen, dressed this time in jeans and a T-shirt, and found Harry sat at the kitchen table surrounded by papers and photographs. More importantly, however, there was a large, fluffy silver cat laying at the end of the table, his feet tucked under him and his yellow eyes blinking slowly at Malfoy. Harry looked up when he came in. After his initial surprise at seeing Malfoy in anything causal, he smiled.
“Ah, well, Harry is practically my son, and my children are expected to help their mother. There’s a difference,” Molly pointed out as the now empty pot flew across the room to join the rest of the dishes in the sink. Harry nodded sagely at this. In a matter-of-fact monotone, he explained to Draco,
“I can imagine.” He trailed his fingers up and down Draco’s back as he thought. Draco shivered at the touch. Still, he did not pull away. “You want to tell me what’s been going on?” Harry asked. Draco let out a ragged sigh.
Draco turned then to peek out from behind Harry, a small click sounding from the hob as it turned off. He did not relax as Harry had. Instead, he set his jaw and lifted his chin, as if daring Ron to hit him again. Ron glowered at him over Harry’s head, before scowling at Harry.
“Promises, promises,” he murmured, before kneeling down between Harry’s legs. When Harry came, Draco swallowed it all. Harry pulled him up into another sloppy, open-mouthed kiss before breaking away.
“Justice,” Malfoy sneered, but it was half-hearted. His shoulders slumped as he wrapped his hands around his cup. “I don’t care about justice,” he mumbled, half to himself.
defence,” Draco spat, “the Dark Lord was going to kill me and my family if I didn’t.” He looked away again as if surprised by his own honesty. Harry blinked. He sat up and leaned forward, elbows braced against the tiny table. Malfoy didn’t look at him, his gaze focused on the rain that had started to fall on the pavement.
“I didn’t think you wanted the sordid details, Ron,” he said, smiling in disbelief. “But if you want to know, yes, we fucked long before I told you and Hermione we were dating.”
“We should stop,” Harry whispered, despite the heat pooling in his belly. “I don’t want you to think of our first time as the night after your father died.”
“You disapprove,” she stated. Harry opened and closed his mouth. Finally, picking his words carefully, he said,
Father Nicola looked surprised to see Draco, even more surprised to see someone with Draco, but he welcomed them with open arms nonetheless. The church was otherwise empty save an elderly woman wearing a thick quilted jacket who took shuffling steps as she made her way along a pew.
Draco frowned slightly. “Not entirely,” he said, “but I think I understand.” He looked down at their joined hands and his frown lightened into a precious smile. “You know, I think I’ve fancied you for a really long time. Years, even.”
Draco nodded. “Okay,” he whispered, his breath ghosting across Harry’s lips. “Okay.” He pulled Harry in close to him as they laid back down in the bed, limbs tangled and foreheads pressed together, noses brushing. Harry stroked Draco’s cheekbone with his thumb, and Draco threaded his fingers back into Harry’s hair to hold him there. They fell asleep like that, chests rising and falling together. It was the best night’s sleep either of them had had in years.
“Just dress shoes from fourth year,” he said with a smug smile, just to watch Draco roll his eyes in exasperation and lecture him on “proper attire.”
“I’m aware, sir,” Harry said with a sigh, his shoulders slumping. “Thank you, sir. Your generosity truly knows no bounds.”
Ron hung his head, but Harry could still feel his side-long glare boring into him. Harry inched back into his chair as they both mumbled apologies. Robards narrowed his eyes.
room. It had only been about a month, but Harry had noticed that Draco was starting to keep more and more things in his closet, that they spent almost every night together, and that one day Draco had gone down to breakfast wearing one of Harry’s jumpers. McGonagall had given Harry a look but said nothing as Neville passed her a Galleon under the table. He later got a letter, delivered by her severe-looking screech owl, saying that, while staff relationships were… acceptable, they would do best to ensure a certain amount of decorum around the students. ‘It would not do for the Head of Slytherin house to wear a Gryffindor sweater, if you know what I mean,’ the letter read. On the bottom, however, she had written, ‘I am happy for you, Potter. And Mr. Malfoy, too.’
“Is there anyone else you can go to?” Draco asked. “Teachers, anything?” He knew that Harry’s parents had died in a car accident, that he lived with his aunt and uncle precisely because he had no other family. Harry had told him as much, ages ago, and didn’t question why Draco hadn’t pushed it further.
Harry raised an eyebrow. Malfoy rolled his eyes. “I promise it’s not a weapon or anything, just… Come on, I’m trying to clear my name here.”
He turned. Tonks had stepped out of the way, and Malfoy stood in the doorway, holding out the Cloak with a guarded expression. “I wouldn’t forget this if I were you,” he said carefully, his grey eyes boring into Harry. “Could be useful, later.”
Harry involuntarily flinched away, laughing, when Draco raised his wooden spoon at him threateningly. “Fine, fine,” he conceded, hands up in surrender. “He’s actually coming over next weekend, you can meet him then if you want.”
“Is someone with you, Harry?” Hermione asked with a small frown. Ron tried to lean in and look further into Harry’s office, but Hermione pulled him back. Rose took this chance to make a bid for freedom, so Hermione had to simultaneously restrain her toddler and her husband at the same time. Harry bit his lip, and nodded.
Harry shrugged, his smile fading. “Not much of a reader, me,” he admitted. “I like films. You know they’re making films out of
Pansy looked up from the book she was reading on the sofa with a frown as Draco stormed into the living room of their shared flat. She raised an eyebrow as he threw his messenger bag into the empty armchair with a sharp flick of his arm, a rare display of force.
He didn’t usually go during the winter holidays. The towpaths tended to flood, or the mud made it difficult to make the journey. Once, he had had to climb over the baffle gate which had frozen shut. It was harder to leave the Manor during the winter, when there was mulled apple cider by the fire and mince pies to be eaten. But the year he turned sixteen, Draco found every excuse he could to escape the Manor, to be alone in the cold and empty fields, where no one could stumble on him weeping and screaming and lashing out at the undergrowth.
“Since when are you and Draco friends?” Neville asked. Harry shrugged and took another bite of toast. “And since when does he call you
Harry glared at him. “I’m observant!” he protested. Draco rolled his eyes and gave him a quick, chaste kiss.
Harry debated for a moment as he cuddled with Draco. Then, he admitted, “I heard him ask you if you were going to marry me.”
“Harry,” Draco’s eyes never left Parkinson, who was sauntering forward, the cronies following close behind. As they got closer, Harry realised some of them had cricket bats in their hands. “Run. Now.”
“As ready as I’ll ever be,” Harry grumbled, straightening his tunic to avoid the attendant’s expectant gaze. “Right, then. Let’s get this over with.”
Blaise pursed his lips. The firelight reflected in his dark eyes like flakes of gold. Then he looked away, sitting back a little as he appeared to study a bit of lint on his trousers.
“My turn,” he growled. He slid off the counter and spun Draco so that he was pinned against the cabinets. He wasted no time getting on his knees and pulling out Draco’s cock, which he proceeded to tease, holding the base as he licked and sucked the head. Draco squirmed, letting out strangled curses in between breathy moans.
“Oh. Yeah.” Potter deflated. He spun the file in question around and around on the stainless steel tabletop. “Robards said we need more evidence the potions were tampered with, and apparently based on your report it could be argued that it was just the one batch that was defective, not the whole set.”
Malfoy smirked. “One of us has to be,” he retorted. He stood up and picked up the dirty dishes from the table. “Although, I have to admit, you’ve given me two surprises already today.”
“If there is anything either of you need, let me know. Humphries, you can come back to the Ministry with me. You won’t be needing the extra security anymore.”
“Yes,” Draco forced himself to say. His fingers fiddled with the note in his pocket as the madness of his situation settled in. He looked down at his shoes. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have come, I just heard you were leaving the Ministry, leaving London, and I – I’m sorry, I was mistaken, I’ll just go – ”
Draco shook his head with a tiny, disparaging smile. He could just imagine what kind of antics a drunken Harry could get up to. Harry watched him pet Scorpius for a moment, waiting for Draco to say something. When it became apparent that Draco wasn’t going to explain himself, Harry sighed and sat up, grabbing Draco’s hand to force him to stop petting the cat. Draco’s gut clenched. Still, he didn’t dare look up, even though he could feel Harry’s heavy gaze on him.
