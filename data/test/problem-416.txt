There are a few tense moments of silence before Harry speaks again.
He’s about to say something – probably something he shouldn’t – but someone swings an arm around his shoulders.
Ron tightens his lips slightly and sighs, finally asking the question they’ve both been avoiding for the past two weeks.
“Because you hid things from him.” McGonagall nods, and Harry nods too. “So you’re hiding
Ginny glares, but it’s softer than it was before. “Yes, you should’ve.” She rounds on Harry. “And you! How could you not have told us?” then she looks hurt. “Why didn’t Draco tell me?”
Still, when Harry grips his waist, Draco finds himself relaxing into it, not a thought in the world except for how good it feels when Harry touches him.
“I – I – he
“What the bloody hell did you do that for?” Ron yells. “Have you gone completely insane?”
The magpie seems to shudder to life, too, and it flies along the walls around the room, stretching its wings wide. Draco tumbles off the crib and falls into it with a loud noise. He hits the side of his face on the edge of it, and when he opens his eyes, he’s staring right at the sun painted on the ceiling.
Despite the fact that Draco’s still shaking, he sneers. “I don’t need you to come rescue me.”
“Draco!” Harry says.
“I need your help,” He continues when she doesn’t respond.
He’ll make sure Voldemort doesn’t ever fucking touch him.
“I’ve been having dreams.”
Either he tells McGonagall and turns in the Floo address, or he calls Malfoy and pretends to join him so he can find out what they’re up to. The letters haven’t come for a few weeks now, so Draco assumes that whoever it was either got caught or was suspected, and so they stopped.
what Harry didn’t want to talk about.
Draco wants to ask more questions, but he knows better. Granger’s helped him no questions asked several times, and it’s only fair that he does the same.
He looks at him and Zabini, shocked.
Deliriously, he thinks that it’s funny that his birth mother died to protect him and that now he’s here; stranded in a house full of people who want to kill him, stalling for time and attempting to survive the next second, minute, hour, day.
“We’ll get through this.” Draco tells her. It’s the same thing he’s been repeating to himself tirelessly, every second he’s awake. “We will.”
?” Draco shrieks. “You
McGonagall opens the letter, and as she reads, her lips tighten visibly. She stands up.
“I’m sorry.” He croaks. It’s been a long, long time since the hands that touched him didn’t leave him hurting for hours afterwards. “I – I-”
Draco climbs one of the chairs – they’re considerably high off the ground – but he can’t reach it. He climbs the edge of the crib. It creaks and shudders.
Draco flushes a little. “I was careful.”
?” Ron asks, disbelieving.
“Everything’s alright, Gin.” He says, keeping his voice calm despite the way his heart is pounding. “I just need you to evacuate the entire floor, call McGonagall, and tell her to call the magical bomb disposal unit.”
“Draco mentioned horcruxes.” Harry manages to get a tighter grip on Draco’s legs so that he won’t slip now that he’s practically dead weight. “What did he mean?”
“Was it bad?” he asks.
“Don’t-” Harry groans, pained. His head is pounding and he just wants to leave, but-
,” She vows, taking a step back. “I am
He’s not sure Harry believes him. “Come on. I’ll walk you to your dorm, and you better get some sleep.”
Harry nods and closes the door after she leaves, turning to Draco.
“Of course he bloody told me!” Ron exclaims. “Why didn’t
The sheets are still warm, but the bed’s empty, and Harry sits up, halfway panicked. He scrambles to put his glasses on, and then he pulls his drapes open.
Draco feels his stomach flutter when Harry grabs his hand and leads him into the castle.
“Yeah, she hasn’t got anyone to pester now.” Blaise says empathetically.
?” Zabini asks. “How the bloody hell would he get to Spain?”
“Still, I haven’t told Ron…” Harry’s voice brings him out of his thoughts.
“I’m sorry,” he says honestly.
I haven’t even told Ron I like him yet, and I already asked him on a
Scorpius feels like he can finally be his own person.
When Luna and Hermione emerge from the dungeons, Narcissa Malfoy is standing in the doorway of the dining room of Malfoy Manor. Draco isn’t entirely awake yet; Harry’s carrying him, and his head is hanging over his shoulder, face discouragingly blank. Ron is looking towards Draco worriedly every few seconds.
Fuck, but he really shouldn’t have gotten involved.
“Sex?” Harry asks, voice higher pitched than he’d like. Merlin, but he really,
Pansy’s not helping matters; she’s acting even more weirdly than Ron and Harry are, and she’s avoiding him. Well, she’s not
Potter’s eyes widen as he reads, and when he’s done, he looks at Draco calculatingly.
Draco stops talking. He scratches harder at his hand nervously.
“The fastest way to find him is to
someone. Okay?”
“We can hide in my bed so we can sneak the wand back before they’re done.” Zabini nods.
“Really?” Blaise asks, disbelieving. “You thought you’d bake him something and he’d magically understand you like him?!”
“Better than a lovesick puppy.” She taunts.
“Ron-” Granger begins hastily.
Draco’s face is immediately burning, and he can only imagine how red he is. Ginny laughs, and he glares at her. “
“The one that was sent to Draco.”  Granger says. “We don’t know who-”
Last year, someone had told everyone Draco’d blown Theodore Nott in the showers after Quidditch, effectively outing both Draco and Theodore. Everyone’d called Draco a slag for weeks afterwards, though they stopped saying it to his face after he’d hexed a Ravenclaw boy into spending a week in the infirmary.
Everything hurts and Draco can feel blood run down his temple and from his chin. He groans and pushes himself up, stumbling out of the way as several people rush by. This isn’t like Hogsmeade, this is full of people rushing by, and as he looks around, he realizes he doesn’t recognize where he is.
“It’s not your fault.” Zabini’s voice sounds hollow.
“Risking your life?!” Harry asks.
Remus exclaims. “They died to keep you safe, to make sure you would have a long, happy life-”
Draco’s back goes rigid.
“Merlin fuck, Draco, I get you’re angry at us but stop ruining your own fucking life!”
“Obviously.” The others agree.
“He’s so into you!” Pansy says.
Molly sighs defeatedly, but nods, and they make their way out quietly.
, at everything they’ve taken from him, from all the people he loves. His parents, first, then his last year at Hogwarts, his boyfriend; all the months he and Ron fought over it, the ways he knows he was unfair to Hermione. How he knows
And Draco realizes she’s right. It doesn’t matter why they kept him. It doesn’t matter if they’re his blood, he knows them; he
Since he was the last one awake, everyone else is already ready, so he has to shower and dress quickly. He pulls on muggle denims and a worn green jumper that used to be one of his brother’s, though he doesn’t know which. It fits him four sizes too big, so he suspects it must be Bill’s, but, to be honest, everyone in his family is rather tall but him, so it could be anyone’s.
Parkinson and Zabini look at each other, and he can practically
complaining-”
“Is that all of them?” McGonagall asks.
They’re sitting on the bleachers of the Quidditch Pitch, having just finished a Gryffindor-Hufflepuff match. Since he’s the only person who isn’t acting entirely weird around him, whenever Draco’s not alone, he’s with him.
“That’s not true.” Draco whispers, heart breaking in his chest.

“Do you think – could it have to do with you-know-who?” He asks in a hushed voice.
“But we don’t know that Longbottom doesn’t.” Adam says.
“You fucking better.” Draco says. “I’ll take it as a personal offence if you doubt my ability as a researcher.”
“What about him?” Snape speaks reluctantly, and Draco frowns. This must be the same person that is Snape’s godson, because who else is Snape friends with? Though, to be honest Draco didn’t think Snape had
He catches sight of the blood running down Draco’s face, and he knows that’s it; he stomps across the crowd of students, and sends Smith flying back into a group of students while he grabs Draco’s collar tightly.
Before he knows what’s happening, Draco has his wand in his hand and is looking around warily, just in time to see dozens of death eaters beginning to shout out spells in flashes of green.
“He was missing, and you knew of someone that had reasons to take him and you didn’t think it was important to tell me?!” He asks. He’s furious, the anger coiling inside his chest like a snake, hot, and tight, and hurting.
Realization dawns.
Harry regrets introducing the Auror Department to Muggle cellphones.
Potter scrambles for his glasses, and several noises come from the other beds, apparently awoken by Draco’s screaming.
“Yes, I don’t like that.” Ron seems to think about it.
And then.
“Look, I wanted to talk to you about before-”
to be impossible-”
Draco doesn’t begin to think about Harry and Blaise in bed together until he gets out of the Slytherin dorms. There’s a tight knot forming at the back of his throat and his eyes are prickling, but it’s not sadness; He’s
“Steal.” Parkinson says, cocking an unimpressed eyebrow. “You’re his
* * *
“Something like, I think.” Granger says. “The books seem to think so.”
“He feels you’re hiding things from him.” Harry says. When the other three look at him, his face heats and he shrugs. “He mentioned. But yeah. I should’ve told you both sooner. I’m sorry.”
“Bill!” He says brightly.
“On the house,” She says with a wink. “You boys look like you need it.”
“You – you knew that was me?” he asks, disbelieving.
They head their different ways at the Welcome feast, and Draco’s eating and chatting comfortably with Susan Bones when an owl arrives.
He’s not going to ask why he loathes him, either, because any time he looks at him, Zabini seems to hate him a little more.
“You better have a good excuse for being out of bed.” Sprout says menacingly. She’s a sweetheart, but she’s scary when she’s angry.
all along?” his mind is reeling. “You were talking about Horocruxes, weren’t you?” Snape goes gray, and that’s as much confirmation as Harry needs. “You’ve lost them. You don’t know where they are, do you-”
“Well, not to worry.” He says. “You know me, and I certainly don’t know anything you don’t.”
“Hmm?” Harry asks, frowning lightly.
Draco’s heart pounds, and he swallows. “I’m not ready to have sex yet.”
Pansy kisses both of them on the cheek as Draco yelps at Blaise’s statement.
Smith holds his hands up in mock surrender.
. The Weasleys love you with every bone in their body, and no matter what they say, no matter what it sounds like, the death eaters are not looking out for you. Don’t go down the path your father did, it’s not worth it.”
“I doubt it,” Draco says, and he begins to stand up, but Smith grabs his wrist and pulls him down roughly, very nearly making Draco fall. “Merlin, what the fuck?!”
“Well, don’t. I want you to call me Harry.”
“I want you to concentrate on the happiest memory you have.” He calls out, so they can all hear him. “And you have to concentrate on it completely! No getting distracted here, alright? And then you have to say
“And I’d like for you to practice with Harry.” Lupin continues.
“And you’re just making it harder on yourself when the answer is much, much easier.” Zabini says with raised eyebrows.
“What?” Draco asks. “But-”
Harry knows he means
“I’m working as fast as I can, Harry!” She snaps, but begins muttering faster. Suddenly, the moans stop.
She doesn’t react.
That, at least, gives him a deadline and the time to figure out how he’s going to break the news.
“A prisoner, maybe?” Blaise suggests. “Or a spy? Maybe it was the only envelope lying around, and they needed to get it out.”
Pansy’s still smiling, and she shakes her head. “He so is! How can you even be this blind?”
When Draco stops looking at the door, closing behind him, he notices that Blaise and Pansy are wearing identical unbelieving looks.
“Or it’ll end with us having to destroy the part of Voldemort that’s inside of me.” Harry tells him. “You know that. You must know that.”
“I’ve been watching you.” She says. She looks at the café they’re walking past and clicks her tongue. “This café is good. I haven’t had lunch, have you?”
“He’s a Weasley.” Molly says fiercely. “He’s ours, and he’ll always be, no matter what he was born as.”
“He’s not talking to me!” He says.
When Draco walks out of the classroom, his friends are there, waiting.
“So,” Harry says as they sit. “Are you okay? Everything alright?”
Cousin Cissy,
“Are you coming with us?” Ron asks awkwardly. He doesn’t seem to be entirely comfortable with Narcissa around; his hand is around Draco’s possessively.
She shudders and makes a face. “Let’s go, come on.”
“Draco?” Harry asks. “Why would he – oh.”
“And I’ve said I’m sorry! I
Harry presses a deep kiss to his lips, and pulls away when they hear a high coo.

“How would
There’s a pause, and Draco looks around the candlelit room, Crups – he’s always wanted one, but his parents never had enough money – lying at his feet, everything he could ever want around him.

, and he thinks maybe they’re all different people than they thought they were.
Ron and Hermione are sitting by Harry’s side, looking uncomfortable, and Ginny’s sitting between Harry and the frowning Weasley’s, watching all of it with a terribly amused expression.
“Odd.” Blaise says.
“Three days.” Fred answers immediately.

“Ginny-” their father begins, but then he cuts himself off with a sigh. “Molly, we were going to have to tell them sooner or later. We knew that all along.”

Hermione scoffs. “Yes, and when have we ever listened to people when they tell us to stay out of something?”
“Yes,” Harry says, playing dumb. “Ron knows everything.”
.” He hisses.
“Kids aren’t something you compromise about, they’re people!” Draco exclaims. “Either you want them, or you don’t, there’s no halfway.”
“Yeah,” he lies. “Just a few, err, restless nights.”
Hermione’s sitting with her head between her knees, shoulders shaking with what Ron thinks are sobs, and Harry has his hands over his ears, forehead against the wall with a pained expression on his face.
“Merlin, you scared us!” Ron says when he sees his brother.
Adam rolls his eyes. “Well, yeah. But I mean, who cares about Potter that could cause the feast to be dismissed and the aurors to be worried?”
She looks surprised. They spend a few minutes in silence, and then she speaks.
“Need time?” Ron guesses, and Harry jumps. He didn’t know he was listening. “Honestly, mate, we’ve known something’s been going on with you for weeks. We’re here whenever you’re ready.”
Pansy bursts out laughing.
His heart stops.
“He can’t be.” Blaise says. “He must’ve had parents, maybe a wife, some kids?”
Zabini shakes his head. “No way. It hasn’t been anywhere near long enough. Either Theo or Draco must’ve changed their minds.”
“Attempt to block me out.” Snape says.
He takes Harry’s hand, and Harry leads him to the dance floor. Once there, he grabs Draco’s waist and pulls him closer, and Draco wraps his arms around Harry’s neck, resting his cheek against his chest, Harry’s chin on the top of his head. They sway from side to side gently, not at all to the beat of the song, but Harry’s hands are on him and Draco can hear his heartbeat and nothing else matters for a moment.
“Did you open the letter?” McGonagall asks.
“You are,” Fred and George confirm. “You were almost sorted into Ravenclaw!”
Harry groans.
“Also, from the questions he managed to answer and a few diagnostic spells I ran, there’s a strong memory charm in place.” The healer continues.
He asked Ginny about it and she sort of waved it away nervously, which makes Draco almost certain that she knows what it is, and he doesn’t understand why they’re not telling him. Ginny’s never hidden anything from him before.
“Wait!” Potter’s hand is on his shoulder. “Can you stay? Just for a bit.”
a Weasley, and you’re
“Now, Mr. Weasley.” McGonagall cocks an eyebrow in that way of hers that makes students back down as soon as she says so, but Draco frowns.
“If you come with me,” Malfoy says. “If you help us – we can give you everything. No more lies. You’re not a child, you’re not dumb. You can make your own decisions.”
“We’ve watched everything,” Harry says dramatically.
Which

, didn’t you?” Blaise points out.
. “No, of course I’m going! I just, err, forgot.”
“So?” he asks boldly. “I’m the Chosen One. This is supposed to be my job.”
“Yes,” Says Noah.
Everyone grunts or murmurs some kind of reply. Lupin smiles a bit sadly.
They’ve their own place since they opened Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes, but they always come back home for the summer. It makes Draco happier than he’d care to admit; he likes his brothers, even if they make his life impossible for sport.
Draco moves closer to Blaise to have a look at the book, and his mouth drops.
“Mr. Weasley?” Lupin’s tone implies it’s not the first time he’s said it.
“I swear, Draco, I don’t. I just meant that if everyone who loves you is hiding something from you, maybe it’s best that you don’t know.” He says.
“And we’re trying to protect him.” She says pointedly.
Harry exhales, feeling like he might be able to breathe again.
“Mr. Weasley-” The auror begins angrily, but McGonagall cuts in swiftly.
“Ow,” Draco mutters, and it’s all it takes for her to let him go.
“Good,” She brushes a bit of her hair back. Her dark skin’s glowing with the light that streams in through the kitchen window, and she’s wearing a dark yellow sundress that suits her nicely. “Are you excited for your sixth year?”
And he knows Draco has, because no matter how he tries to hide it, Harry sees it in his eyes; he sees the bleakness, the panic, the desire to flee. The fear. No one deserves to live scared, and Draco’s terrified.
“Fine,” Ron mutters.
“What’s yours?” Draco asks, suddenly curious.
“Who’s it from?” Adam asks, coming closer as Draco reads the envelope.
his family, even if Draco hates them all at the moment – so he’s left with two options.
The next four days are spent in a haze of putting out fires (most of them rhetorical except for one), helping Fleur greet family and guests coming from France, making sure everything is ready, and, at night, finally collapsing into bed with Harry.
asks.
“Did you flirt with him?” Blaise asks.
It’s the only thing that came in the mail yesterday, but it came from Malfoy Manor, so Draco assumes whoever was sending him letters isn’t dead.
McGonagall whisks the hat off his head.
“Wow,” Mrs. Thomas says nervously. “Now that you’re holding it I can see it really is a bomb.”
He doesn’t know why they’re researching this, he’s half certain the professors are hiding something from him, and he knows Ron certainly is.
He catches sight of white blonde hair once, and thinks it’s Draco, but it’s only Luna. As relieved as Harry is to see her – and surprised, considering that she’s putting death eaters on the ground like flowers.
Draco turns to look, just as Lucius Malfoy sits beside him.
“Does it matter?” He asks tiredly. “I’m done. I don’t want to do this anymore.”
And the door shuts. No one says anything.
“Wake up, you bastard,” Blaise’s wicked grin is the first thing he sees. “Nice dream, I take it?”
want to know is why you didn’t just bloody well tell me instead of making this whole – this whole shit show that ended up with me finding out from-”
“I’m not! And he’s not into me! And even if he were, I think everyone’s a bit preoccupied with bloody
“Take me with you,” he repeats. Harry opens his mouth, and Draco doesn’t let him continue. “I – I know you say you need me to be safe, but who knows how Hogwarts will be after the Holidays? Or – or who knows what’ll happen with the death eaters, and Voldemort, and whoever the fuck else. Please, just –
(See the end of the chapter for
The kiss drags on for a few more seconds before Draco feels Harry’s tongue against his, and all he can think of is ‘oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck’.
“I will.”
“I – I’m falling in love with you, too.” He says lowly, and Draco’s heart stutters, lungs momentarily useless. Harry chuckles. “I realized it when you left after seeing me and Blaise. You were gone and I didn’t know if you were alright-” he exhales harshly. “I was so fucking worried.”
You never,
They’re quiet for a few minutes before there’s a groan from the bed, and they all look down at Draco, blinking at them blearily.
His friends hum in agreement.
“Yes. I needed to speak to you.” She says. “It’s hard to do that when you’re hardly ever alone. I’m glad you have so many friends.”
“But you better pick me up at seven sharp,” she says, nose high in the air. “And you better
The streets are empty, and in hindsight, Draco really could’ve waited until tomorrow to get comfort candy.
Though he’d rather not admit it, he’s being reminded of when he was spying for the order; being locked in the manor, unable to ever leave and fighting for his life every second. He doesn’t like where his mind goes.
“You’ll have your memories when you need them, baby.” She whispers. “But I can’t let you know this. Not yet.”
“I know.” Pansy says. “Have you seen the Patil twins? Or Lovegood? Or Merlin, your

pushing their luck – and even though they’ve learned a lot about Horocruxes, Draco feels more ignorant than ever.
“Look, I – I don’t know if you aren’t interested, or-” Harry swallows. “Or if you were, but I lied to you and I messed it all up, or if you wanted – I don’t know, sex-”
Ron, Ginny, and Hermione all round on him with incredulous looks.
Ron glowers, and Draco stops grinning.
Remus shakes his head lightly. “Harry, forget about Ron for a second, okay? How do you feel about this ‘date’?”
“She payed for us to stay in a huge hotel room.” Fred says. “We spent most of the trip there, she mostly wanted to see Draco.”
“Empty your mind, Potter.” Snape drawls with a sneer. “Don’t be a Gryffindor. Feelings are useless, letting other people know about them is deadly.”
Still, Harry has never been more relieved to see someone.
“Even if you were.” Ron says, a sinking feeling to his stomach. “Even if – even if you’ve been a complete idiot and done something you can’t get out of right now – you’re
“If you don’t like it learn to be a ‘pure soul’.” Adam says with Sprout’s dreamy tone. Draco knows mainly he’s just surprised Sprout decided Thomas was one and he wasn’t.
to rare, black-market venom, but nothing’s worked. They venture into Knockturn Alley thrice a week in the hopes that something might work, but so far, it’s been useless.
“You can hate her while you practice.” Draco nearly falls on his face because of Potter’s voice behind him. His tone is kind, but Draco still feels utterly embarrassed when he continues. “It’s a very important Charm, Draco. It could save your life.”
He’d let all that go for a day, an hour, a minute, a

if it’s possible to bring back you-know-who?”
Harry looks between him and Zabini, and immediately knows what it must look like. His tie is off, and he’s unbuttoned the top three buttons of his shirt, since it was unbearably hot with four people in one bed, and Zabini’s in a similar state. It doesn’t help that Harry’s lying on top of Zabini.
“Potter,” McGongall is at the end of the hall, looking out the window at the shields she’s put up. “They’re here.”
Draco struggles while Ron drags him away from the students and the teachers beginning to arrive, and doesn’t stop until Ron shoves him down onto a chair in an empty potions classroom.
“Too soon.” Ginny mutters beside him.
Draco doesn’t sleep very well that night.
“I have to have the information from his wand.” She says. “And he’s always carrying it around with him.”
“Hi Draco,” Thankfully, Granger’s sitting in front of him – she’s spent the summer here – and unlike Potter or Ron, she seems to have a fair idea of Draco’s crush on Potter. As mortifying as that is, she’s never mentioned it, and she always pretends Draco’s not just made a fool of himself, so he likes her. “How was your summer?”
“Wake up, princess.” It’s Greyback – he’s the only one who calls Draco that; it’s – funnily enough – not the worst name the death eaters call him, even if Greyback is – in Draco’s opinion – the worst of them. “You’ve a new roommate.”
“She’s already invited!” Ron says.
“It’s not the exact same thing!” Ginny roars hotly. “I’m doing it to protect him-”
“No, Mr. Weasley.” She smiles, finally answering. “I need to take care of some things here.”
“Merlin fuck,” Ron mutters.
“Then why would he-?”
“Whore,” Smith sneers at Draco under his breath as he leaves.
“Hello, Draco.” There, sitting in something akin to a throne in the front of the room, is Voldemort.
“Why did you bring me here?” he asks.
She gives them a light smile. “I do think he remembers you. He could answer all your names, and your parents’ names. There might be a few things missing, but he knows who you are.”
She doesn’t like the sound of that, but there are too many things to do, too many worries and too much relief to really worry about it.
“Obviously, him, too.”
“Alright?” He asks.
“Draco,” Harry says.
“Everyone else has already accomplished it.” Draco says quietly.
“No,” He says, uncertainly.
“They don’t want us here anyway.” Ginny says. “We have a choice.”
“Fine.” Draco mutters, following Potter to the seventh floor.
“How’d it go?” Hermione asks anxiously.
“Seriously!” Ron complains. “What’s it going to take to-”
“McGonagall also mentioned the elder wand.” Harry tells him. "She’s taking me to a man named Dumbledore, said he might know some things that might help us.”
He eats something and gets a few hours of sleep before he’s put to search again. Greyback doesn’t watch him anymore; they’ve instead told him that if he tries to escape, Luna will pay the price for it.
“I'm not like them." He says. "And you know how dangerous the Diadem is. You want it gone just as much as I do.”
He’s not wishing for death.

“Join me for a walk?” She asks, offering him her arm.
Sprout groans. “Seriously, you five! Couldn’t we have

“That was really close!” Potter says excitedly. “What were you thinking of, just now?”

“Harry has just as much of a right to be here as anyone else.” Lupin says. Draco admires his ability to remain calm. He wants to hex Snape on the regular. “And are you sure that’s the only reason? Because I rather recall someone else that might be of interest? Like, I don’t know, your

Draco can only blink, heat spreading across his face.

“Because,” Malfoy says conversationally. “Otherwise we’ll kill him.”

“Don’t make almost dying a habit, please,” he murmurs against the top of his head. “My dear old heart can’t take it.”
“I don’t really understand what they are,” he admits. “But I need to figure out how to use them against him.”
“I don’t know!” Parkinson yells back. “Draco came looking for Smith and as soon as he saw him he hexed him! And then Smith tried to hex him back, but-”
know.” She says. “It’s the reason for all of this, the letter from Malfoy, why he disappeared, we’ve been wondering why, and you’ve known all along!”
“I’m going.” Draco says, more harshly than he means to, and sees Harry flinch back slightly. He doesn’t care. “I – I need to leave.”
“There could be, if you just-”
“What’d you want to talk to him about?” Harry asks curiously.
Greyback is standing by the windows – whether to pressure him or to watch him he doesn’t know – and there’s a house elf standing by the door nervously, ears twitching.
“They died for
“Okay.” He agrees. “Well, I’ve to go to class.”
“You’re not.” Harry dries his tears with his thumb soothingly, and he pulls Draco close and presses his lips to his hair. “Merlin, Draco, of course you’re not. I love you, alright? Remember that. I’ll do everything I can to get back to you.”
“I don’t, uh, I don’t like him… anymore… I-” Blaise gives him a deadpan look, and the color in Draco’s face deepens. “I have no idea what I’m going to do. He’s going to be staying at the burrow for the rest of the summer, Blaise! What am I going to do?”
?!” Ron asks. “You can’t go out with him!”
He doesn’t
McGonagall levels him with an unwavering glare.
“Look at this,” she tells him, hair bushier than normal because she had double-potions. She shoves a thick book towards her. “No book specifies what the monster in the chamber is, exactly, but there are a few ideas-”
So he doesn’t.
She keeps insisting on it, even though no one believed she could carry any of them anymore. It appears they were wrong.
Draco flips her off, and she smiles back.
I hope you all enjoyed taking this journey with me, and I love you all! Thank you for sticking with me through late updates, and writer's blocks, and unbeta'd chapters <3 I'm so happy we've made it to the end
this is going to be Draco’s favorite place to sit for the rest of eternity.
Draco takes a deep breath. “I wasn’t trying to hide it from you.” He pauses. In the privacy of Harry’s four-poster, he is unexpectedly soft. Nowhere near as sarcastic and witty as he is outside. “I mean, I wasn’t trying to hide it specifically from you. I promised the Grey Lady I’d destroy the diadem alone.”

“Merlin, Blaise, it’s ridiculous!” Draco complains. “It’s like he doesn’t even
“They died for what was right!”
“What does it say?” He asks.
“No, it won’t.” Ron says. “Because you’re both leaving with the rest of the students.”
Hermione closes her book nervously, and she bounces her foot.
“Yes,” Jae smirks, and Adam groans.
“What?” he asks.
“How the hell did you
“Are you okay?” He doesn’t stutter around him as often anymore.
The auror’s nostrils flare, but he stomps out of the office after his evident dismissal.
And he disappears up the stairs towards their dorm.
Ron, Potter, and Granger are going into seventh year, but since he’s a year younger, he’s going into Sixth year, along with Ginny.
“But at least they’ll be financially taken care of!” Mrs. Thomas cries. “You know how hard it is to live without money? To hope to have
“Yeah,” He mutters. “It just – it hurts.”
“Well, you
The woman’s pale blonde hair is pulled back in a low pony tail, hair long and wavy like Draco’s is, and her face is covered in freckles. Draco’s freckles only come out when he’s been in the sun for a long time, and since he lives in Britain that doesn’t happen often.
“Quit moping.” Rose nudges him when she sees him in the hall; she’s a year older, and if Scorpius isn’t at home he can always be found at the Weasleys’, in Rose’s room, probably in some sort of contest of
“Oh,” Draco frowns lightly. “Well. We’ll figure it out. With or without that loon’s help.”
. “You think I wouldn’t stop this in a second to find Draco if I could?”
to be useless.”
“Right,” Draco says, hesitating. “But - I didn’t think we’d be
“I knew they had you in strict Hospital food diet,” Blaise says, grinning. “So I thought I’d surprise you.”
It’ll be alright.
Draco shakes his head. “He’s been in Azkaban for sixteen years, Blaise, if the family avoided Azkaban they must’ve fled the country.”
friends.”
“I was
“We don’t know that he’s back.” Harry says, even if it’s a lie. He does know, he just hasn’t told them yet.
Harry doesn’t see Voldemort between his death eaters; he expected it. The bastard’s too much of a coward to show up. He’s eager to see Draco, because he hasn’t seen him since the beginning. He assumes Hermione and Ron are still struggling with the cup, and the rest of the students are blending together in his mind.
Her and Hermione Granger had arrived shortly after Draco had been laid on the couch, when everyone was still hugging and speaking quickly. Everything’s much quieter now. She can imagine it’s awkward, to have Draco’s birth mother in their living room.
things from him.”
* * *
“I won’t.” Draco whispers back. “I swear.”
Potter sighs. “I want to. I definitely should, and I know that. It’s just… if no one knows, it’s just a nightmare, yeah? But if I tell them and they’re something real, it means Voldemort’s back and I don’t-” he exhales harshly. “It was supposed to be over.”
He’s suddenly hit by just how long he’s liked Potter, and just how unlikely it is to happen. Potter’s known him since he was ten, probably still thinks of him as a child, as family. He’d never be interested in Draco.
“Potter,” Draco interrupts lightly. “Do you need to sleep?”
“I need to go back to my dorm.” He says reluctantly. “Sprout will murder me if she realizes I’m not there.”
Draco smiles at her. His siblings don’t like her much, but to be honest, he’s always been rather fond of her. She’s cultured and a rather very powerful witch. She spent the whole of the first summer they met each other teaching him various spells.
“We have the cup,” Hermione says carefully. They’d broken into Gringotts to get it, and they’ve been carrying it ever since. “We need to destroy it, and I think Draco must’ve some Basilisk Venom left at Hogwarts. It’s the last one.”
Draco shakes his head mutely, and Ron exhales.
“And do you’ve anything to do this Saturday?” Hermione asks.
“What are you doing?” Hermione asks hesitantly.
Harry’s eyes are wet, and he blinks quickly. Hermione frowns and pulls him close in a hug.
“Err.” Noah says.
“I think, Auror Whitewood, that you’ve questioned my student enough. I merely informed you so you could take the letter as evidence, not so you could question a teenager under my care. You’re free to leave now.”

“Not all kids!” Harry defends weakly. Draco gives him a look, and Harry sighs. “Alright, fine, most kids
Draco throws his hands up, but he answers with much more respect than he did to the Auror. “Why does everyone keep asking me that? I’ve already
“Draco, it’s not-” Zabini begins immediately, trying to push himself up, but Draco shakes his head quickly, interrupting.
“I-” Harry begins, but Draco shakes his head.
“Do you want to…?” Harry trails off, pulling a bit of his blanket backwards, patting the mattress next to him.
anything to stop it.
And Harry’s thrown out of Snape’s head, their matching hard breaths filling the room.
“And we don’t tell him.” Ron says.
“No!” Harry says quickly. Draco’s face lights up again, and it takes everything in him not to grab him and cuddle him against his chest and never let him go. He’s looking at Harry with his eyes all huge and Harry groans inwardly because

“You have no right to say
“This doesn’t change anything.” Ginny tells them fiercely.
“Oh, I do.” Hermione grins. “They’re so cute, and so little, and their little toes, and hands, and
“We’re going to Diagon today.” Their mother informs them. “Are Sirius and Remus joining us, Harry dear?”
“Yes,” Harry rushes out. “I’m so sorry, Ron, I should’ve told you sooner.”

He wants his friends not to be rotten liars.
Draco forces himself to relax, even as his heart races.
“As if I could ever.” Draco rolls his eyes.
Fernir Greyback.
“I’m not,” Draco says, crying out in pain when Bellatrix drags him up by the hair to look at his face. Harry’s fists tighten behind his back, and he struggles, but Lucius Malfoy tightens the spell around his wrists until the edge of his vision darkens from the pain of it. “I don’t – I haven’t seen him in so long – and – I can’t tell.”
“We can try to do handstands.”
he thinks warily.
This takes place immediately after the last chapter, harry's just finished talking to McGonagall and Draco to the grey lady :D
“Lupin wants Potter to tutor me.” He mentions, going for casual and missing it by a mile.
wanted to see how you were doing.”
Draco’s cheeks heat. “Lies. You know Hermione Granger.”
“It wouldn’t be as fun that way, professor.” Thomas grins cheekily.
“Alright,” Draco says softly. He turns on their bed, facing Harry, and presses a slow kiss to his lips. “Everything’s alright.”
He begins wondering if Dolohov is finally going to kill him. His heart begins beating faster, and his throat tightens. He stumbles over his feet, and Dolohov pulls him forward harsher, making Draco’s foot twist painfully.
“Is something wrong here, Smith?” Drawls a cool voice from the doorway, and both Draco and Zacharias turn to see Harry standing there.
“Why are we doing this, again?” he asks. It’s almost three in the morning, and he’s sprawled on his front with several books open in front of him.
Draco fights the urge to throttle him. “Fine. I’m randy. Come on, fuck me.”
“They dismissed the feast so we could be safe and you thought it smart to sneak out because you were
Fleur frowns worriedly.
to do it! I just asked about the sleeping arrangements because you’ve been sleeping with Harry at Hogwarts, and-”
“Oh.” Draco’s heart flutters. “Well, what I mean is that it’s okay if you’re not. Fine. It’d be… understandable.”
“I love you so much,” Draco says, pulling away to kiss Harry deeply. “I was terrified.”
And what about his siblings? Do they know? Bill and Charlie must know, they were old enough to remember that their mum was never pregnant after Ginny, but everyone else? Do they love him less for it, think him different?
Though Mrs. Zabini has always kept herself carefully neutral in most political situations, Draco thinks it might be different during a war, even to a woman like her, who’s always liked to keep everything very private.
sixteen years ago, after Lucius Malfoy was sentenced to Azkaban.”
Harry doesn’t pay attention.
“Will we be practicing tonight?” He asks instead, to change the subject. “I’m getting better at my Patronus.”
Bill and Fleur have just stepped out to eat something, Charlie’s on his way back from Romania, and Percy stopped by earlier, but left quickly, presumably caught up with something from the ministry.
“Thanks for meeting me.” Granger says, appearing out of nowhere.
“No,” Ron says harshly. “I already said it. Gin and Draco aren’t getting involved.”
“Or with Fred,” George grins, and Draco shoots them a grateful look, because they tease him a lot about Harry, but they’d never make him stay in a situation where he’s uncomfortable.
Potter looks surprised.
Draco rolls his eyes and gestures for them to continue. “What else?”
risk it happening to Ron?” Draco demands. “Or Hermione?”
Scorpius swallows; their story is legendary, told to children before bed, talked about in the streets. The way they hated each other, the way they fell in love.
“Harry’s waiting outside. So you can practice.” He tells him.
Harry. Everything they are, their parent teaches them. Even – even if we just tried to do our best, even if we tried not to mess them up - I'm not sure we could. I don’t think
“What the bloody hell are you talking about?” Ron demands. “Of course we are-”
Draco huffs, but topples off Harry’s lap, sitting next to him on the grass. Harry thoroughly enjoys the debouched look on him: the red cheeks, the messy, moussed hair, tie undone and a lovely bruise just in the underside of his jaw – though that was done in private – and Harry probably shouldn’t be as smug as he is that he’s the reason for the blonde’s untidy look.
Draco smiles blindingly. “Amazing.”
Draco sticks his tongue out at Ron.
“It’s just – Harry doesn’t want anyone to know about this, and Ron doesn’t want to involve you, so.” She waves a hand, blushing.
They all nod immediately.
Potter snorts quietly, Granger’s lips quirk, and Ron looks momentarily disoriented at his perfect imitation of their mother. Draco’s friends snicker quietly.
“Why would they send an Owl though, and not arrest them?” Jae asks. “No, it must be some kind of warning.”
He serves them both, and they pay and leave.
“Mrs. Thomas, could you give us a moment? I want to talk to my husband about this.”
He mumbles something unintelligible, and then shrugs it off.
Everyone murmurs in agreement, and McGonagall nods sternly. “The auror department has
him. Draco knows she’s conducting more research on the Malfoy’s, but every time he tries to talk to her about it she denies it and runs away. She’s included Blaise in her search, and Draco doesn’t know what they know but they’re both acting terribly odd.
“Maybe,” He says. “It feels like they don’t trust me, though. Or like they think I’m too – I don’t know. Young. Dumb, maybe. To know whatever it is that’s bothering them.”
“What’s wrong?” Draco asks.
“No,” Hermione calls from where she’s opened the bathroom door. “He’s here.”
“Are you alright?” Lupin asks, and Draco looks at him, surprised. That’s not what he’d expected, if he’s honest.
-----
Ron looks up tiredly from where he’s sitting. Him, Ginny, Fred, and George are all sitting in the cramped hospital room they’ve put Draco in, while their parents are pacing around.
He walks to the forest without hesitating.
Draco stops breathing, candy half way to his mouth.
The aurors know bc the weasleys told them bc of the letter
“Potter,” Harry corrects.
“Hello, Mr. Weasley.” She says gently. “You’re in St. Mungo’s. Can you tell me who’s the minister right now?”
In Scorpius’s fourth year, he almost dies twice. Once, when he’s entered in the Triwizard Tournament, the youngest competitor in the history of the game, and the second time when he tries to ask Rose to the Yule Ball.
Narcissa thinks it’s hardly appropriate to crack a joke about the evident malnourishment Draco and Luna suffered in Malfoy manor, but it certainly helps lighten the tension in the room.
“You need to remember.” She tells him. “One for sorrow, two for joy, three for a girl, four for a boy.”
“What?” Harry says. He hasn’t stopped looking at Draco since they arrived, and though Ginny can pity the anxious state he’s evidently in, she doesn’t give a fuck; this is her
“Yes,” the woman – Narcissa, she said – smiles faintly. “I needed to get you alone.”
Like?
always there, and Harry can’t imagine a time when they’re not together, but he doesn’t have a choice.
Draco goes red again and buries his face in his hands. “Merlin, this is so embarrassing. Does he hate me? Did he say he hated me? He must think I’m ridiculous-”
She presses a kiss to Draco’s hair when he finally slumps against Harry’s shoulder, passing out from exhaustion.
This’ll have to do, for now. Whatever happens, with Voldemort, with the war, with Lucius bloody Malfoy; Draco’s Harry’s, just as much as Hermione and Ron are, and Harry’s not going to let anything happen to him.
He yelps, and Ginny’s laugh echoes even as she runs out of the room. He grabs his wand from under his pillow and chases after her. They run down the stairs, past their parents’ room, then past the dining room – the table’s full, but Draco doesn’t bother to stop – and finally Draco corners her in the kitchen, pointing his wand at her menacingly.
“Alright…”
Draco doesn’t know how to apparate, but he’s two more creepy sentences away from trying.
Thank you for reading, I hope you enjoy!!
“I think – I

“What’s happening?” Ginny asks, frowning worriedly. “What’s wrong?”
“Then, you were born and you were tiny, and an hour old and already what I loved most in the world.” Her eyes are watery, and she blinks quickly. “I didn’t want to give you up. The plan was to leave you at St. Mungo’s, just leave. That was it. I wasn’t even supposed to look at you, but…” She wipes at her eyes quickly. “I couldn’t. I had to hold you. And I did, and you were perfect, you
Draco’s head is spinning, and his ears are buzzing, and it’s too much, it’s all too much. He needs Malfoy to stop talking, he needs to think about this, he needs to go back to a few hours ago when he still thought everyone he loves loved him back.
Ron shakes his head. “Something else I didn’t want to know. Thank you, Zabini.”
Ron takes a deep breath.
Harry smiles. “Good. I’ll, uh, see you.”

“Do you regret it?” he asks. “Now that you know everything.”
“Do you think he escaped?” Ron asks.
“Good,” He admits. “Better than I have in a long time.” He chews on his lower lip. “I just – I don’t know. What if I completely mess it up? Should I get him flowers? I don’t want him to think I want to marry him or anything – not that I don’t want to marry him-”

mind sharing a bed with Potter because the last thing he needs right now is Potter finding out he has a crush on him because of Draco’s stupid sleep-talking.
“Yes,” Thomas now.
Harry gives him a deadpan look. “Right.”
They haven’t, or at least Draco doesn’t think they have. Muggles seem to have an endless array of movies, so they can’t have
Harry wants to tell him that it’s bullshit, but he’s too tired to even argue.
Draco snorts. “It wouldn’t do any good. The Aurors already have a copy, and McGonagall would have my arse for keeping it. My parents before her.”
The Aurors think he’s lying, he knows, even with the Healer’s diagnostic spells of a memory charm. He wishes he were. Then, at least, he’d remember where he was.
like Lucius Malfoy did in his mugshot.”
He shrugs again, and there’s a beat of silence.
They stay still and silent while Mrs. Norris walks past, followed by Filch, muttering angrily.
to, and his attempts are clumsy and half-arsed at best. Snape flickers through his memories easily, and Harry whips back when he finds one of Draco.
needs to leave now, because otherwise he’ll cry and he doesn’t want that to happen. Not here.
He yelps, but Dolohov continues walking, so Draco does, too. Otherwise he’ll only be dragged. He’s pushed through a door, and he falls onto his knees, which makes a thrill of pain shoot up his body. He bites back a pained sound.
“What do you think Potter’s cock looks like?” Blaise asks curiously, and Draco chokes on his chocolate.
, and he needs to get out
know that?!” Blaise asks, equally hysteric.
“It is.” Malfoy says calmly.
. “I thought this was what you wanted.”
Lupin gives him a look, which only serves to make Draco tense up further.
“Any way to track him?”
When Draco sees him, his entire demeanor changes almost imperceptibly. He exhales. He looks at Ron and Hermione – held kneeling behind Harry – and Harry can see the almost frantic edge around his eyes disappear.
“Draco!” Ginny exclaims, jumping on him to hug him.
The room is big, with nice, big windows that have been obscured by a spell and shelf upon shelf full of books. It’s a library, Draco realizes with a thrill. The thought is strangely comforting.
And now they’re running, and Draco twists around to see that the Aurors are running after them, trying to get through the crowd. It slows them down, but it also slows Draco and Narcissa down, so it doesn’t help much.
Dying is easy. Too easy, almost; it’s warm, and light, and
“You know it’s true, too.” Malfoy says. “It’s why they’ve all been acting so strange around you for weeks. Since they found out, they don’t love you. They don’t want to see you.”
“They’re your family,” McGonagall tells him. “And I need you to listen to me when I say that no one regrets the death of Mr. Malfoy and Mr. Potter like I do. I watched them grow up, I watched them fall in love, and I watched them die long before it was their time to, and that is something I'd never wish upon anyone. But you are a child, Mr. Potter-Malfoy, and I will not let you fight this war.”
“Who’s fighting?” Ron asks, frowning lightly.
There’s silence for a beat.
Shit.
Lupin gives him a disapproving look. “See me after class, Mr. Weasley.”

Zabini nods. “I don’t know how
The rest of them step in after him, and Ron whistles lowly. The bedroom is absolutely trashed; there are pieces of broken glass on the floor, furniture tipped over, the window shattered.
“All of that sounds like a nightmare, Mrs. Thomas.” Draco says.
“It’s not your fault,” Zabini repeats, louder. “I saw what was going to happen - I told Draco he was going to die because of you. He ignored me.”
“Mum told us while we were in the hospital.” He says. “Apparently – his birth father is Lucius Malfoy.”
Ron scowls, and Harry grins, kissing his boyfriend’s cheek. It makes Draco turn redder, but he hums in appreciation.
Harry shows up at eleven sharp.
“Hey,” Draco comes into the room right as Harry swings his legs over the side, and he breathes out relieved. “I got you coffee.”
Rose is Scorpius’s best friend, and there’s nothing romantic between them; that doesn’t matter. He can’t imagine his life without her, his wedding, his eventual children not knowing her, her existence, deleted from the world except for the people who’d remember her, him, always mourning.

,” he mutters.
Ron sighs. “Yeah, fine. Fine. Just – next time, warn me, yeah?”
“Here you are,” Harry sighs, when he goes into Dolohov’s room; he’d stepped out and looked for Draco all over the hospital, and he’d been honestly worried that he’d left entirely.
They’re there for him.
“Hey,” He says.
And then she shoves Harry forward and drags a protesting Ron out of the room.
“Not like you’d care if I was gone, is it?” Draco asks coldly, and a hurt look crosses Ron’s and Ginny’s faces. Merlin, but Draco hates them.
“Harry, what are you doing?” Draco asks, cautiously. “It’s eleven in the morning.”
Both of their faces have hardened, but they don’t interrupt him, so he continues.
he’s in perfect view of the Potions Classroom, but what’s Snape going to do, drag him kicking and screaming? – and begins reading a book.
“Yes.” Ron says.
“No.” Adam says.
“I’d rather not,” Ron says unhappily, even as they begin walking. “Snape is a berk.”
He explains everything. About Snape talking to Lucius Malfoy, about them looking for the Horocruxes, and about them talking about Draco.
“I did it!” He says.
“What you’re saying is impossible.” He says. “It’s been like fifteen years.”
They walk to the courtyard until he can see a crowd of students, and as they get closer, the chanting grows louder and Ron’s dreadful feeling gets worse.
If u don't celebrate christmas, I also love u babes, so HAPPY HOLIDAYS all around <3333
what Draco needs like that, not when it should be Harry in his place, shagging Draco into the mattress when he needs it and curling around him and under a warm blanket when he’d rather do that.
A smile begins to spread out over Draco’s face. “Your maid of honor? Your best man?”
“It’s not your business.” Ron says defensively.

“I – that’s – you-” Blaise shakes his head. “You’re both hopeless.”
“I-” he begins.
“Merlin fuck, don’t let me fall from this.” He mutters.
Hope you enjoyed reading, and Happy new year in advance!! May everything you need be yours!

Everyone nods, and she purses her lips.

“I - I don’t know what to say,” Harry says sincerely. “I - Draco, I've always wanted kids. A lot of them.”
A few clear ups for questions that i think might be common:

And there, like that, Draco falls asleep.
“After curfew,” Hermione says, and Harry raises his eyebrows. “What? You just said it, I’m clever, and I like knowing things. When people,” she throws him an accusing look. “Don’t tell you things, you’ve to find out for yourself.”
Soooooooooo long wait I know, I know.... hopefully the wait is worth it??
His heart seems to be trying to beat out of his chest, and he looks around, trying to remember the way from wherever he’s being held to any sort of exit.
Until it does.
“I-” Merlin, but of all the ways that Draco could’ve

last long with the death eaters, he can’t do this, he can’t – and instead busies himself with tentatively getting on his knees. He feels the space around him, and carefully, slowly, he begins crawling in one direction, arms feeling the floor in front of him to make sure he’s not in danger of suddenly falling to his death.
“You need to stop what you’re doing,” Zabini tells him. “I told you about the Horcruxes to warn you, not to lead you to your death.”
Adam’s cheeks flush and he flips two fingers Thomas’s way.
“You don’t need to know that.” He says finally.
“Get off your fucking high horse, you brought this on yourself-”
“Bellatrix Lestrange. Fernir Greyback, Antonin Dolohov, Rodolphus Lestrange, Evan Rosier, Walden McNair.” He seems to hesitate. “Lucius Malfoy. These are all the escaped Death Eaters. I want you to look at them, and I want you to remember them. If you see
“Alright? Pansy repeats.
“Do you want to do this, or not?” Parkinson asks impatiently.
, not here, not in the middle of a war. Nothing short of stopping it is enough, because Draco’s seen the horrors that the death eaters do, first hand, and nothing that he’s done has stopped them; it feels like nothing he
“Mr. Weasley?” Lupin calls, just before Draco’s out the door. “Professor Snape asked me to speak with you about skipping class. He’s been reluctant to go to the Headmistress, but if this behavior continues he’ll be forced to inform her.”
“I’m staying, Potter,” McGonagall says.
Harry nods, even though he doesn’t; he didn’t really research anything, either, and is now feeling a little intimidated, looking at Draco with a full binder as though he’d prepared for this all his life.
The Grey Lady’s in front of him so quickly he nearly jumps backwards, which would’ve had him falling off the stairs of the Astronomy tower.
“My name’s Narcissa Black.” She says. “I was married to Lucius Malfoy. You’re our son.”
“Just leave me alone,” He says, incredibly exhausted and miserable all at once. “All of you.”
Mrs. Thomas shakes her head, “I don’t want to blow up either! But it’s one million galleons! Wouldn’t you do it, for your children?”
, Harry thinks.
It clicks for him at the same time it does for the Ron and George.
He pulls himself out of the passage, coughing violently, and finds Ginny already waiting there for him.
The thick crowds let them lose the aurors every few seconds, but they never stay away for long.
McGonagall sighs. “I never knew much about men. Being honest might be a start?”
“Stop, please – I – I don’t want to – I need to talk to them-”
“Pansy!” Draco hisses.
“Hold still,” Narcissa Black is performing a healing charm on Luna’s face, a finger on her chin softly.
Ron makes a face.
“You were experimenting with
They all nod in agreement, and Hermione puts up her hand hesitatingly.
“Yes!” Potter says.
“What?” he asks.
No one says anything for a moment.
She smiles lightly. “I know. It was repetitive, but it was the only think I knew about you. It was the only thing I knew you’d like.”
“We’re sorry.” Ginny blurts. Draco looks at her. “For lying to you. It was a decision that affected you, and we shouldn’t have made it for you.”
“We’ll share.” Hermione says. “If you do the same.”
Draco exhales carefully. “Yes.”
The truth is, they’ve always had a particularly active sex life, and without anything else to do, the first few weeks they’d been making love pretty often. Then they’d had a pregnancy scare, and Draco doesn’t want to have a baby yet, so they’d promised they’d slow down. They haven’t, really, but they said they would.
“I don’t know, aren’t you supposed to know everything?!”
“Oh, no.” Harry says, waving it away. “I didn’t mean right
“Follow him?” Ginny screeches in a whisper. “
It doesn’t. Draco doesn’t care if Lucius Malfoy is his father. He didn’t raise him, he didn’t feed him when he was hungry. He didn’t do a damned thing for Draco, and Draco will gladly return the favor.
Parkinson snickers. “Then why the surprise?” She takes one look at Harry and her mouth quirks mirthfully. “Oh
about that. I don’t even want that to be something

“Are you even paying attention?” Rose rolls her eyes at him, and he blinks.
Scorpius swallows, mind racing. His parents – they’d known?
He comes back, wakes up in Hagrid’s arms, and he can see Draco, standing there, and they’re in the middle of the Hogwarts grounds, and of course Draco sees him, he always does, he always has, and he does the last thing he can.
,” Ginny says, rolling her eyes. “If he hears us and escapes-”
How the hell is he supposed to find
“In the room of Hidden things.” Draco nods. “The grey lady told me.”
Draco doesn’t know how long it’s been since the wedding – and that’s his only point of reference to time passing – but he’s very slowly wasting away. The only thing he ever feels is the vicious fear whenever the door is opened and someone comes to fetch either of them from the dungeons.
He'd never get over that.
“I love you,” Draco says, burying his face in Harry’s chest.
“Unarmed?” Harry asks, as he and Ginny grab their wands and walk out of the room. “Why would he be unarmed?”
“I’m done.” Harry snaps, trying to get up.
Plus, in the past week that Draco’s been in the hospital, his siblings have visited every day, and it’s painfully obvious there’s something they’re hiding.
NO Draco does not know he's adopted.. he thinks he's a weasley by blood
They’re dragged upstairs again – Draco’s half-unconscious on the floor, but he blinks blearily when he sees them.
“And he gave me his Floo address.” Draco continues. “He told me to call him.”
The meal in the kitchens is perhaps the most awkward thing Draco’s ever had to endure. They decided not to go to the Great Hall, because even though he’s cleaned up his face so there’s no blood on it, he still has bruises and cuts, and he doesn’t want Sprout to see it. She’ll give him detention for the rest of the year.

“Oh?” Remus asks.
“Do you think he’ll see the reason in our cause?”
He meets her.
them to their beds at night if she has to – and she’s not like Sprout, Draco doesn’t believe for a second she won’t follow through – and when he steps out into the Hall, Ron is standing there, with his arms crossed.
“What’d it say?” he asks.
They walk back to the Hufflepuff dorms quietly.
not. They’ll never love you like they love each other. They’d let you die in a heartbeat.”
me! Or worse, he sees me as some sort of… I don’t know!”
Draco blushes brightly and grins. “He’s amazing, Gin. And because of the Patronus thing, we’ve been spending so much time together and he actually told me we’re friends, but I might’ve completely ruined it today—”
“Draco?” he asks gently.
“On?”
“Nonsense, Potter,” she says. “Mr. Malfoy-”
“Is that all of you?” She asks.
“A bastard is what you are,” Draco mutters darkly. He snaps his suitcase shut and pulls it off the bed. “We’re leaving.”
Before he gets to the Great Hall, he catches sight of Draco, and they look at each other and make a detour; Harry can’t quite breathe, sitting in the middle of a half-destroyed staircase in what used to be his second childhood home and now is nothing more than war ground, but it’s better with Draco sitting with him, holding onto his hand.
Draco flips his sister off easily. She snorts, and a second later, Draco’s hit by ice cold water.
It isn’t. It can’t be, because Harry wouldn’t lie to him, not after
“Oh,” Harry says, stomach sinking. Does Draco know he’s a Horocrux? “That’s less good.”
“And have him be unhappy for the rest of his life?” he asks. “That’s its own kind of death, and if Draco was going to die I was not going to be the one to do it.” Scorpius swallows. “And now I look at you, and – it's like I'm seeing a ghost, every day. And then you almost
“You didn’t?” Fred asks. “We figured it out ages ago!”
“It was,” he says. It’s not that he
Draco’s mouth falls open.
“I’ll try to stop,” Draco tells him; Harry cocks an eyebrow. “I’ll stop. It’s just - hard.”
He doesn’t respond. He doesn’t know when that is; he doesn’t think he’s ever seen her before in his life, though she does seem awfully familiar.
“We were in Malfoy Manor.” Luna says. Narcissa pulls back from her, having healed her, and sits on her heels. She moves towards the couch uncertainly, putting a hand on Draco’s calf. Molly’s eyes flash with something akin to possessiveness, but she says nothing. Narcissa doesn’t remove her hand. “They were trying to find something, and they thought Draco knew where it was.”
“Anyway,” Hermione continues. “The first night we were there, we heard Snape speaking to Malfoy-”
“We’ll see you at Hogwarts.” Blaise says. “Hopefully you’ll have gotten into Potter’s pants by then.”
“They’ve never cared about you, Draco.” Malfoy says, suddenly much closer, grip tight on Draco’s arm. “They’ve never cared about you and they never will. What do you think will happen after all this is over, even if your side wins the war? That they’ll welcome you with open arms and freshly made food? No.
“Harry,” Remus repeats. “I think he’d be able to help you.”
There’s a rather sickening crunch, and Ron sees his baby brother’s fist collide with Smith’s nose.
“Voldemort created Horcruxes,” he says.
“We’re all lying to him.” She says drily. “And if he finds out, you think it’ll matter to him if we were doing it to his face or not?”
Draco’s cheeks redden, and that’s as much confirmation as Harry needs.
children, I just want to stay with
Draco stills.
you don’t-”
“What’s happening?” Ron grumbles as he opens his drapes. He raises his eyebrows at Draco lying on the floor. He looks up at the bed, where Potter’s still staring at Draco with wide eyes, and then back at Draco. His eyes narrow. “Were you just sleeping in Harry’s bed?” he glares at Potter. “Did you just have my baby brother in your bed?!”
“Unlikely.” Ginny scoffs, hand tightening around Draco’s. Draco doesn’t say anything; he’s tense beside her, unsteady. He seems to be trembling every few minutes, and Ginny can’t see one thing about him that doesn’t scream
She gives no explanation, but the prefects do as she tells them. They respect her enough to do what she says without further question. She’s earned it.

“We’ve been
It’s almost time for dinner, and all that Draco’s managed is something like a silver mist, but even that’s not fully formed.
“Yes.” Pansy says. “Nothing they wanted to tell me, though, so I did my own research.” She takes out various books from the bag she’s carrying. They’re all about Pureblood Lineages and the Sacred Twenty-Eight. “We know about Lucius Malfoy, right?” She opens one of them to the Malfoy line, and then opens another one to the Black line. “His wife was named Narcissa.” She points at the name on the Black line. “She’s a Black, and her sisters are-”
Draco swallows. “Smith?”
“I just…” Draco sighs. “I don’t know. Have you ever felt like every single person you know knows something that you don’t?”
out of the ordinary, you should tell a teacher. The curfew will now be at eight instead of ten. All students,” it seems like she’s looking at Potter especially. “Without exception, must be at their common rooms at that time. Understood?”
“Harry,” Remus says gently. “Have you ever heard of Albus Dumbledore?”
One of the magpies’ eye is shining silver. He stares at it. Dobby shifts on his feet.
“Of course not!” Harry says. It’s so painfully obvious that it’s a lie that he cringes.
“I…” he begins. “Don’t know.”
The room’s lights immediately dim, and a bed appears a few feet to their right. It’s big and comfortable-looking, with big pillows and a warm-looking red blanket.
“You’re safe now,” Harry whispers. “It’s alright.”
Ron’s hope turns into rage.
“Draco?” A soft, airy voice asks.
“The bloody baron?” he asks.
“Minerva, Harry, I’ve been expecting you.”
He only manages to see a silhouette before he’s grabbed by the arm and dragged to his feet. He immediately begins to struggle, and the grip tightens, claws digging into the skin of his arm, drawing blood.
“And pregnancy sounds – Merlin,
he tells himself.
“I’m sure you will, love.” Harry says softly. “But
“Students,” McGonagall announces the next morning at breakfast. “There’s something you need to know.”
“That’s Malfoy!” He whispers to Ginny.
He can’t see anything because of the cloth tied around his eyes – they always blindfold him when they take him out of the dungeons – but he’s counted the steps, he has every turn and bump on the floor memorized, and he knows they’ve gone the wrong way.
“Meanwhile,” Ginny pointedly says. “I think we’ll leave you two to talk.”
They’re walking past a narrow alley when a house elf runs between them, pressing a small coin to Draco’s hand. Everything spins around him, and the next thing he knows he’s rolling down the steps of an alley, landing flat on his arse.
Draco’s taken from his arms – Harry doesn’t let go of Draco’s ankle, because he’s not quite ready to – by Molly, who Harry didn’t expect to have the strength to carry Draco.
“Think about it!” Thomas says. He swirls his cloak dramatically and imitates Snape’s voice. “
“Ron, Hermione, and I are leaving.” It’s said too quickly and too lowly for Draco to understand immediately, but when he does, he stiffens against Harry. He pulls away slightly so he can look at his face. “We need to find the rest of the Horocruxes, now that you know how to destroy them. We have some – some suspicions as to where they are, and – say something, please.”
Harry laughs, and allows him to change the subject. “Well, if this goes as well as I think it will, we could probably take a week off. Go to Brazil, sleep all day. How does that sound?”
With a wave of her wand, she Accio’s over a thick wad of parchment pieces, and she gets on her knees on the floor and spreads it out. Ginny has to stop some from flying out the room. She hands them back to Hermione and closes the door.
“What?” Ron asks.
“Are you using protective spells?” Bill asks immediately. “
“I’m fine.” Draco’s voice comes out higher-pitched than he’d like. He clears his throat. “Fine. I feel fine.”
“I have to go.”

want to blow up, which, I’m telling you Aida, is a pretty tough stance to take,” Harry says. “Okay, for my opening statement: I don’t want to blow up. I don’t want to die. I have a husband outside of this room, and he thinks I’m angry with him, and I can’t die while he thinks I’m angry with him!”
“I’ll have Mr. Black test it.” McGonagall says. Thanks to Sirius’s long time living with dark objects, he’s good at identifying and testing them, so he occasionally does McGonagall – or other people he respects – these kinds of favors.
of the rumors going around about mythical monsters and Muggleborn murders.
Mrs. Thomas shakes her head. “I do. I do! My Sophie – did I tell you about my Sophie? - she’s pregnant! The father wants nothing to do with the kid, and the man told me he’d give her a million galleons if I did this!”
Draco’s not defenseless, and he’s not weak.
“Right.” Parkinson says, but the delighted look doesn’t leave her face entirely. “Theo and Draco aren’t dating anymore, but they still have the occasional meet ups.”
“Would you rather we draw them here?” Narcissa asks.
Or simply a pain to be around. Remus would know; he spends all day around them.
“Calm down, blondie.” Blaise says. “I won’t offend your delicate Hufflepuff sensibilities.”
“I’ll try,” Draco says.

Draco looks at him flatly, and Harry sighs.

“Rubbish,” Draco says. “I know we’re not
Draco’s mouth drops.
“I don’t know what you mean,” Their mother says softly, but Ginny’s having none of it. She’s been furious ever since she lost Draco on their visit to Hogsmeade, and Ron knows she’ll relax – they all will – the moment Draco’s alright, but as of right then, they’ve been in St. Mungo’s for over four hours, and he still hasn’t woken up.
goes unsaid between them, but Harry hears it all the same. He sighs.
“What?” Ron asks. He’s jealous, Harry can tell. “In your bed?”
“What?” Ginny asks, but he’s already running back towards Dolohov’s room. He doesn’t know what he expects to find when he opens the door to Dolohov’s room, but it’s certainly not Mrs. Thomas holding a glowing blue orb; Harry knows it’s a bomb, thankfully a steady one. Mrs. Thomas would have to break it to set it off; so as long as she doesn’t, they’re safe.
“Why do you still call me Potter?” His voice has already taken to a more sleepy and far-away tone. He’s placed his glasses beside his head on the pillow, and Draco moves them so they won’t get crushed if he moves around.
They walk to Draco’s dorm silently, and when they get there, they stop by the door.
Instead, he buries his head in his knees and breathes.
Scorpius only half-listens to the rest of the explanation, wondering what he’d do without her; though everyone keeps telling him to wait, that it’ll eventually happen, it’s become pretty clear to him that he’s not interested in men, or women, or anyone, really, in a romantic or sexual manner.
that she was perfect. She’d love you, no matter who you were, no matter where you came from and I knew that was my chance. I had to do it, otherwise I’d never let you go, and I couldn’t take you away from the Wizarding World, not when I loved it so much. I couldn’t make you live a life that wasn’t yours. So – so I asked her to hold you while I went to the bathroom and I left.” She swallows thickly. “It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do. I’ve been living in different parts of the world and I always kept up with you, darling, even if it would’ve been safer not to. I needed to know what was going on with you.”
“That was – something,” he says.
It feels like one.
When the announcement happens – Voldemort, telling Harry to give himself up – it's Draco who breaks the silence.
“That’s what you
Harry looks grim when he answers. “Malfoy said you’d know a way to find the Horocruxes.”
Except he doesn’t.
he wants to ask, but he doesn’t.
He is, if he’s honest, but he doesn’t think he can go to sleep yet, not with everything that’s on his mind.
They spend a couple more minutes in silence, and then Hermione smiles triumphantly.
Draco’s cheeks heat.
Scorpius leaves the room without another word.
Potter thinks he’s
If he could guarantee his family’s safety – and Harry’s, and Hermione’s, and all of his friends’ - he’d leave in a heartbeat. He wonders if that makes him selfish, if it means something’s changed in him and he’s not a selfless Hufflepuff. That he’d leave England burning, if no one he cared about was in it.
“You told him you’re a Death Eater.” He says bluntly.
“I – it’s a-” He doesn’t know what to say. Should he tell her it’s a Horocrux? If Sprout told him to look for it, it means that Harry found the list of Horocruxes Draco left by his bed and he took it to McGonagall. He’s glad.
to focus on having a relationship with me!”
Scorpius doesn’t think knowing the answer makes him feel better.
“Of course it’s okay with us, honey!” Molly says. “You know you’re always welcome!”
Hermione looks over to the unconscious death eaters nervously.

“Don’t get yourself killed, huh, kid?” he says quietly. “Too many people have died already.”
Draco’s quicker than him, though, and he’s already across the room.

She laughs harder.

“We can share, if you want.” Potter says to Draco, because he knows he sleeps in his bed. “I don’t mind.”
The hat also considered Slytherin, but Draco’s never told anyone that. Its final decision – Hufflepuff – is the only thing that matters, after all.
“What?” Draco asks.

him and he doesn’t understand why, which makes him nervous, which makes his Potions less than stellar.
“How?” Ron asks.
Draco looks at him, eyes hard.
Draco frowns.
“Shut it.” He tells her.
“So let’s find out!” Ginny says.
Draco’s steadying himself for whatever torture they’ve come up with today, but, instead of being taken to the dining room – the only room he’s been allowed to see apart from the dungeons – he’s walked past that.
Ron sneers. “
“But I-” He starts.
“You need something warm,” Molly decides. “You all do. Come on.”
to find him-”
Aaaaaaaaaahhh okay, so after all this time, this is the end! Honestly, for the last few chapters I've had a love-hate relationship with this fic, but I'm honestly incredibly sad to see it end :(
“You could fall from there,” Says a voice, and Draco snaps around so quickly he almost does.
“Yes, he has to!” Hermione says crossly. “Schoolwork is very important, Harry!”
Ron doesn’t trust her, but he’s not about to leave his brother’s side to make sure she destroys the Horcruxes.
“Hi Ron.” Harry says a little tightly, and Hermione shoots him another one of her
“What were you thinking about?” Hermione asks.
“You’re going to do horrible thing to it, aren’t you?” she asks. “Like that other boy did.”

Hermione looks amused and nowhere near sympathetic, but she shakes her head.
could.”
Everyone stares at it, because owls aren’t supposed to arrive at the Welcome feast. They only arrive at lunch, and even then, not one of them usually arrives to the Headmistress’s table, especially not a Ministry Owl.
He searches the chapel.
They spend the whole train ride talking of various things – Blaise’s last piano recital, Pansy’s second time running away, how Draco’s doing in the muggle Ballet academy he goes to – and don’t even notice how much time goes by before they arrive at Hogwarts.
Blaise’s laugh floods the room.
“What is that?” He asks.
Harry looks at him through heavy-lidded eyes and clears his throat, letting go of Draco’s waist for a moment to push his glasses up his nose, even though they’re fogged up.
He’s not stupid enough to. It could easily be a cursed letter, and he’d rather not end up dead. He did, however, duplicate it. He gave them the copy and kept the original for himself.
“How are you taking this?” He murmurs against his husband’s wedding ring.
The next spell fired at him shatters his
“One of us has to.” Draco says, taking a bite out of the chocolate bar they’re currently sharing.
Lupin cocks his head lightly. “Does that bother you?”

“I do,” Ron says.

there,” Harry tells her. “And if you blow us up, you won’t be there!”
“Shit,” he says. “We’re late for dinner.”
“How much time do you think we have?” Blaise asks.
The door opens, and Draco immediately feels much less frustrated.
His dad puts a hand on his shoulder, and Scorpius can almost swear they are.
His parents were driven crazy by the curse.
Greyback opens a door and pulls him through it. Draco’s brain seems to stop working. The Death Eaters are all staring at him, and, with growing horror, Draco recognizes various faces; Bellatrix and Rodolphus Lestrange, Lucius Malfoy, Antonin Dolohov. Draco feels like he might vomit again; he’s never been this terrified in his life, and he doesn’t think he can – can – can –
Draco takes the vial from him, shoving it in the pocket of his robes.
“You should’ve made him.” It takes Scorpius a moment to realize it’s he who talked; if he knew something was going to lead to Rose’s death, if he couldn’t stop it – what would he do?
“When?” Draco asks.
“Shut up, I’m happy.” Draco says from somewhere in Harry’s chest.
Various days pass without anyone coming to visit him; the first few days the hunger sent pangs of pain along his whole body, but eventually the pain seemed to calm down. No one’s come to visit him, and Draco’s half-convinced that the death eaters have no intention of using him, only buried him alive, when a door opens.
“And you’re not a Weasley, you’re a Malfoy.” Malfoy says. Draco can hear his steps behind him.
“The death eaters escaped.” The witch says. “They were always loyal. And that Potter kid was a baby, we don’t know what happened.”
known.” He says accusingly. “Since the start.”
?” Draco asks incredulously. “I’m not the one in my pants in our yard at eleven in the morning!”
Rose rolls her eyes at him. “What are you doing?”
“No, you shouldn’t have.” Draco agrees. Everyone waits in silence, and he sighs. “I do forgive you. I’ll murder all of you, though, if you hide something like that from me again. I won’t stand it.”
the silent conversation, but he doesn’t understand a single thing.
today and - I hate you, Potter, but Draco’s going to have my head the moment I die if I let anything happens to you. That’s why. I know you’ve been wondering.”
“Is there a particular reason for that?” He asks.
He manages to shake his head. Her and Ron manage to get him up to the dorms to have more privacy, and Ron sits next to him.

“Now go.” She says sternly.
“That!” Fleur says triumphantly. Then her face softens, and she smiles lightly. “Will you be?”
Draco wishes the hospital bed would swallow him.

She nods tightly. “Remember, everything begins after the sun.”
Draco hums thoughtfully. “Maybe.”
Harry sighs deeply.

“Yes you are!” Ron’s never been this angry. “You’re skipping classes, you’re not eating, you’re picking bloody fights-”
“Nothing except for another wizard or witch.” The healer says, answering their mom’s question first. “A very experienced one, at that. They seem to have deleted most of his memories from the past three days except for a few ones they’ve selected. It’s complicated enough to delete determined amounts of time from people’s memories, it’s even more to delete determined memories.” She pauses. “And, frankly, I don’t know if there’s a way to get them back. With usual memory charms, sure, when they’re removed.”
“You will sit down and eat Harry Potter.” Molly says sternly. “McGonagall’s already told Remus you’re here, and he told Sirius, and you’re not getting any worse under my care.” Her face softens, and she says. “And afterwards you can see Draco.”
“Harry, what are you

in all
Always.
Draco nods.
“So, what, he doesn’t remember us?” Bill asks, and Ron stops breathing, feeling everyone tense around him.
Draco swallows and sits up. “Luna?”
“He might need time to do so.” He says. “He was raised by blood traitors.”
“None of my business?” Harry asks in return. “Are you kidding right now?”
Potter exhales and nods slowly. “Yeah. I think so.”
Draco shakes his head lightly, blinking quickly, vision blurry because of the pain or because of tears maybe, Draco can’t tell.
“Yup.” This is always Adam’s favorite part, and he takes Noah’s place, pinning a white sheet with a question mark. “Someone wants something to do with him, but we don’t know who. Or why.”
“Let go of me!” Draco snaps, heart hammering against his ribs. “Get the fuck off me you moronic fuck-”
“We caught him,” Draco says, disbelieving. He straightens and looks at Harry with a smile. “It’s our anniversary soon. What are we going to do to celebrate?”
Harry’s lying on an inflatable pool bed on the grass of their yard, only in his boxers, with sunglasses and a milkshake that smells a lot like muggle rum. Ophelia and Phillip, their adopted crups - who’re already bigger than originally thought, and easily reach Draco’s waist now - are lying on top of him and licking his face, but Harry isn’t reacting.
“I’m not going to hurt you.” She says.

Everyone tells him not to be scared – Teddy asks him if he wants to come home, half teasingly, but Scorpius knows he’d come get him in a heartbeat if he said yes – but his aunt Hermione doesn’t; she tells him to be careful, which, to him, sounds like she believes at least

“I don’t – hey!” Draco says angrily.
Ron listens to Potterwatch every day to make sure his baby brother’s name is kept on the ‘missing’ list and not on the ‘dead’ one. He knows he was the one who said not to bring Draco, but this is… not the alternative he imagined.
“Horocruxes.” She says, beginning to look through the books.

“Alright, alright,” Mrs. Thomas says, rolling her eyes. “But I expect details later!”
The next weeks pass relatively uneventfully. People are avoiding Draco and looking at him oddly since the word spread that he got a letter from an escaped death eater, but thankfully his dormmates merely rolled their eyes and kept trying to figure out who Snape’s godson was.
“Usually.” Zabini says.
“Hermione, can’t you work any faster?” He asks desperately. They’ve been in ere only for a few minutes, but he's more than ready to leave.
“Shit,” Hermione says, waving her wand faster. “How long do you think we have?”
“Listen to me you bloody brat,” He says. “I love you. I do, more than anything else in this world, and right now I bloody well hate you, but you’re my brother, and I don’t give a Merlin damned thing what anyone thinks, or says, because you are

?” Harry’s voice rises, and Ron feels thoroughly satisfied of getting a reaction out of him after two weeks of him saying
“Do you like him?” She asks without preambles, and Harry nearly drops his fork.
“Granger put a tracking spell on your wand, before you went missing.” Blaise continues. “That’s what we were doing, when you saw me and Potter in my bed together. We weren’t going to – I would never – I wouldn’t, Draco.”
“No,” Potter says. “It’s their eighteenth anniversary soon, so they left for Tahiti today.”
The Grey Lady stares at him for a moment.
“Draco won’t tell us anything.” Ron feels proud of his little brother, and he’s sure his face shows it; Malfoy scowls. “But you will.”
Draco thinks it’s total hippogriff shit. In his experience, being one foot in and one foot out in
He has to read it five whole times before he deciphers it completely – the handwriting is absolutely abysmal, the spelling even more – and even then, he has to read it again. When he finishes, he’s confused, worried, and more than a little bit scared.
The light is bright, and Draco squeezes his eyes shut with a flinch. He hears the cell door unlocking and opening, and he opens his eyes, even though they hurt, trying to get a good look at whoever it is that’s there. The relief he’d felt when seeing the light – he’s spent however long he’s been here wondering if he’d gone blind – is short-lived.
He chews on his lower lip, and his voice comes out weak when he speaks. “Would you mind if I slept with you tonight?”
“How?” Harry asks excitedly. “Because I thought we could just – wait a while, you know? Maybe you’ll feel differently, or – or maybe I will, and-”
“Aurors have been following their trail, and they expect to find them soon. However, they’ve reason to believe that they might be headed here.” A murmur runs through the great hall, and, instinctively, Draco looks over to the Gryffindor table.
“Yes, Mrs. Weasley, if that’s okay with you.” He says.
Thomas laughs, and Adam pinches his thigh lightly. “You’re a menace.”
“Harry!” His mood lightens a bit when a flash of blond hair comes in sight, a second before Draco crashes into him, making Harry stumble backwards when he catches him.
“My name’s Narcissa Black,” The woman says. “I’m Draco’s mother.”
It’s a small house they come to, and though it seems to be too full of books and cauldrons and various curious-looking objects, everything seems to have its place.
Dobby doesn’t respond.

She moves in – secretly – with Sirius and Remus not two weeks later.
Potter’s mouth tightens for a split second, and Draco thinks he’s going to tell him where to shove it.
“Wait!” Harry says before he can help himself. “Who are you going to ask, professor?”
“Draco.” Harry repeats.
“Since we’re all sharing things we should’ve told each other sooner,” She says, grinning nervously. “I’ve been doing some research.”
“No-” Draco tries, but he goes unheard.

” It’s Ginny who says it this time, kicking at a tipped over night table. The Police Department has been trailing Riddle’s criminal organization for almost three decades, and Antonin Dolohov was going to be their first major arrest; they’ve managed to catch some low ranking people who were mostly unimportant and couldn’t tell them anything even if they wanted to, since they had no clue as to what they’d really gotten themselves into, but Antonin Dolohov could’ve given them what they needed to take down Tom Riddle, the leader.

“Sit down.” It’s Hermione. “Both of you.”
And Draco’s looking back at him, earnestly, loving and sincere and
The professors nod and leave, and afterwards Harry avoids McGonagall’s eyes desperately, face still burning.
“We could find out.” He suggests. His friends look at him with the wicked look they all get when they’re about to do something they shouldn’t.
“He doesn’t know anything about his parents.” Snape says, voice dangerous.
“Just because I’ve given my blessing for this doesn’t mean I can’t take it back,” the red-head threatens.
He shouldn’t.
“Get off me!” he struggles, as Ginny does, too. “Who the fuck do you think you are-”
Your father says he knew,”
And it fucking terrifies him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Pansy’s is a Black Mamba, and though it was unexpected, it makes sense, in a way. It’s pretty but vicious, just like Pansy is.
“He’s my brother-”
“Who are you?” Harry doesn’t know when Hermione got her wand back, but she’s pointing it at the woman, and Harry’s grateful, because he couldn’t concentrate on anything but Draco even if he tried.
“It’s fine,” Ginny soothes after he fails, yet again. “It’s very complicated. There are plenty of people who haven’t been able to do it.”
He opens the door and lets Draco through first, and they walk to dinner together, Draco’s heart still beating in his throat. He wants to say something, has half a heart to tell Potter he’s in love with him, can’t hold it inside himself any longer, but abruptly he remembers the letter in his pocket.
It’s a dumb question, but he doesn’t know what else to ask.
“What?” Harry asks.
“We were planning to get the wand while he’s in the shower, after the Quidditch game.” Ginny explains. “But his teammates would be there, and-”
Draco thinks bitterly. At first he thought that was what bothered him, that they’d think differently of him, but that wasn’t it. The problem is that

“But-” Draco begins.

Draco swallows. He doesn't respond, because he doesn't know what he'd say. He's terrified that it's true; that no matter what he's done or what he will do, he'll always be just a Death Eater's son. He's terrified that no matter what he does, that's where he'll end up.
“Mum and dad are going to be here soon,” Ron tells her, oblivious to Ginny’s mental turmoil. It’s alright; he loves both Draco and Ginny – they all do – but none of them understand them like they do each other. “Fred, George, Bill, Charlie, Fleur. The Order of the Phoenix. This isn’t your responsibility.”
“I-” Harry hesitates. “I’ve been very busy with everything that’s been happening, I haven’t really thought about it. But… I think I might be. I could be.”
“They’re my family.” He says. His throat hurts, and his eyes prickle, but he won’t cry, not for this. The Weasleys; Ron, Ginny, Fred and George – they’re his
“I don’t know.” Harry says, grimacing. “I kind of… ran.”

gone well for Ron, and all he’d done was talk to Draco about it, not the person he was dating – so he merely keeps his mouth shut.

Ron can only get glimpses; he catches sight of darker blond hair, and he frowns.
No one says anything for a moment. Then,
“I’m not.” Malfoy says. “Narcissa Malfoy was your mother.”
“What the bloody hell are you doing out of bed?” Ron asks.
Draco doesn’t respond.
Draco crosses his arms sullenly.

By the time Draco and Fleur come back downstairs, something’s happened. Draco doesn’t know
“Are you bloody stupid?” is the first thing he asks.
“Yes it is!” Ron snaps. “Merlin, what do you think I would do if something happened to you? I couldn’t-”
“Good. How was your summer?”
“Do you have it?” Ginny asks anxiously.
“What do you think yours’ll be?” Pansy asks. She bats her eyelashes at him. “A doe, to match Potter’s?”

He’s eaten half a chocolate bar when the streets empty, the other half by the time he hears a noise beside him.
“A side of what?” Draco asks.
“Are you sure you can carry him, Fred?” Molly asks nervously.

Draco opens the drapes.
Draco’s cheeks heat. “Do you remember the portrait thing? Last year?”
“No!” Draco says.
Draco looks away, embarrassed, and rolls his eyes. “You’re not even into boys.”

“And did you ever think about you?!” Ginny asks. “How the hell do you think
Thankfully, the headache subsides just enough for Draco to be able to think properly, and he turns to Malfoy angrily.
Draco looks at him, hurt flashing in his eyes, and says a small, “Oh.”
He gets it later, when he and Rose overhear Headmistress McGonagall explaining that Parkinson ended up in Azkaban for betraying his parents, selling them out to Voldemort.
Harry smiles at her again, and squeezes her hand across the table. “I know. I will, I just…”

“We could find answers!” Draco says.
Draco nods, exhaling harshly, and Harry drops a kiss to his temple, followed by three more.
Harry’s cheeks heat.
“Yes, I expected so.” He says. “Okay. I need you to give me all your attention for five minutes, alright?”
“An hour, maybe. Hour and a half?” Draco guesses.

She trails off.
Harry and him aren’t anything. Harry can very well sleep with anyone he wants to. That’s the whole point of not being anything with anyone, right?

“No, that’s-” Harry freezes. “

“And I’m just your boyfriend,” Draco says. They stop swaying, and Harry runs a hand through his dreadfully messy hair.
Draco smiles reluctantly. “Thank you.”
“Really?” he asks. “Because from where I was standing, it looked like ‘rescuing’ was exactly what you needed.”
“We don’t work with half the information, not even with our actual friends.” Zabini says drily. “It’s how you get caught.”
“Hello,” Draco says cautiously. “I’m Draco.”

“That’s not your choice.” Molly snaps. “He’s
“Get up, you arse.” Someone kicks at his bed, and Draco groans and covers his face in the pillow. It’s taken away a moment later. He groans again and throws an arm across his eyes to avoid the light. He hears a groan. “Merlin, but you’re lazy.”
Draco feels half-embarrassed by the intense wave of relief that floods his body. He shrugs a shoulder tensely.
The relief in the room is palpable. After months of not seeing either of their youngest brothers, Harry, or Hermione, everyone’s attitude’s had been in a pitying state. Even Fred and George, usually always smiling, had been looking grimmer and grimmer each day.
Rose smacks the back of his head. “Don’t get too lost in your own head.”
The screams are driving him insane. He keeps trying to distract himself by hitting his head against the wall, over and over, but it’s not working, and he thinks he might be bleeding.
Thank you so much for the wait babes <3 I hope yall enjoy this chapter it wa made with all my love <3
“Coffee,” Harry repeats, brain still a bit foggy from the dream, stomach still tight in knots but less so than when he woke up, anxiety fading away gradually thanks to Draco’s hand running softly through his hair.
“Merlin,” He’s saying, while he’s pacing around in Remus’s room. “
Harry looks at him, and Draco allows himself to look at his impossibly green eyes, shining and so fucking gorgeous, staring only at him.

“Hello,” Lupin says calmly. “How are you today?”
“Shut up.” He says, cheeks warm. He grabs a Chocolate frog and pops it into his mouth, moaning at the taste.
He’d never get over her.
“I was only on season six when I had Rose,” Hermione tells him.
“No,” Draco says. “Bill managed to drag them away to breakfast. He promised he’ll stretch it out as much as he can.”
– she couldn’t. She won’t do that to them. To him.
And throughout the day.
He breathes out relieved.
“Now, which one of you would like to begin?” McGonagall asks.
Technically, Draco’s supposed to be sleeping with Ron, but Ron agreed to not tell their mum that Draco sleeps in Harry’s bed –
Draco gives half a shrug. “Out.”
He’s crying. Harry thinks he might be crying, too, but he’s not feeling anything at the moment.
Draco turns his glare on his brother.
“I want to join the Order of the Phoenix,” he tells Headmistress McGonagall. It draws her up short.
“Five for silver, six for gold,” she continues. “Seven for a secret never be told.”
Bill had taken Draco from his mother shortly because it became evident she was struggling – though it had been an impressive feat to carry him, it quickly became evident that she couldn’t do it for very long – and they’d laid him on their couch, which means that they’re all now sitting either on the dining chairs or the floor around him. Harry’s sitting on the arm of the couch, a hand tightly around Draco’s ankle. He hasn’t let go of him since they arrived.
“Alright,” he clears his throat again, leaning up on his elbows. “We don’t – we don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do. I’m not expecting anything. We can take it slow.”
“We have to go now.” Hermione says. “We’re doing some research. We’ll wait outside, Harry.”
Draco frowns lightly. “Of course, Harry. Are
“Well, even if he’s the last Malfoy, it makes no sense that this is from him.” Blaise says. “He’s one of those prissy purebloods, he’s
“I’ll tell you what you need to know,” she says.
“Let go of me!” Draco snaps angrily, not even looking at Ron, and the red-head has to tighten his grip until Draco hisses painfully and looks at him. “Let go of me you pr-”
“Mistress Narcissa loves you very much, Mr. Weasley.” Dobby says.
“Is he okay?” Harry asks. Then, “Are

“Will you be going to Fleur’s and Bill’s wedding?” He asks.
She throws a look at him and he winces.
“I-” he begins. “I-”
“You think I’m going to let you destroy the only thing that belonged to my mother?” she asks.
“Having kids won’t ruin anything, Draco,” Harry tells him. “You’re right, I do love you, and I know you love me, too, but kids have nothing to do with that! They won’t change our feelings for one another, they’ll just enrich our lives!”
“Did I do enough?” he asks them, because they’re looking at him with so much love and sorrow he can’t tell which is caused by him and which is felt for him.
He wants to sit as far from Potter as he possibly can – he always ends up making a fool out of himself in front of the stupid git – but there’re only two seats left, one in front of him and one next to him.
And Blaise is his best friend, he has to have a good reason for this. He wouldn’t just do that to Draco, would he?
Draco goes red. He hadn’t noticed she’d heard that. “What was yours?” he asks accusingly.
“You’re thinking too much.” Harry says.
“We need to plan further, but soon. Before the school year is over.”
“No!” She says. “Ron did!”
“You really are clever.” Harry says, impressed. “When’d you hear them talking?”
“Yes,” She says. “How are we going to get out of here? We can’t apparate-”
“I’m a virgin,” he blurts, panicked, face burning.
Potter frowns worriedly.
Remus smiles and hums. “More often than you’d think. Sometimes teenagers are terrifying.”

“It was Dobby,” Narcissa says. Everyone looks at her, and Dobby – at her side – waves nervously. “I told him to. I needed Draco to know what was going on.”
“It’s here!” Hermione says, lifting the phial of Basilisk Venom triumphantly. Ron rushes over and fishes the cup out of the bag he’s carrying, unwrapping it from the handkerchief they’d placed around it. He places it on the floor.
“Be still my heart,” Harry drawls dramatically, but Draco sees his lips twitch. “We said we wouldn’t do it as often anymore.”
Draco frowns. “It’s
,” he snaps. He’s not, not really, but Ron’s desperate to stop this, and if appealing to Malfoy’s compassion is the way to do it, he will. “Why are you letting this happen?”
“You’re in love with me?” Harry asks.
And he walks out of the tent.
those?” Blaise asks, awed.
“You acted like I was your family, like you loved me-”
“Whatever it is – whatever they do, you must not let them win. I’ll teach you how to – I’ll teach you everything you need, but you must promise me, Draco.”
“We don’t need your blessing,” he says petulantly. “And you can’t take it back now.”
Hermione’s muttering charms Harry doesn’t recognize and waving her wand in complicated patterns, and she throws him a glare.
“It was you!” he says. “I’ve been getting Puffskeins for my birthday every year since I was a child!”
They don’t talk; Fred is hurt – he's going to make it, he
“I don’t know.” Harry shakes his head. “It doesn’t make sense. But Malfoy seems to think so.”
They stay there, quiet, until long after curfew.
* * *
“Does he still look just like his mother?” Malfoy asks. “How is he? Is he powerful?”
“Merlin, Draco, no!” Harry says, looking horrified. “I was going to say that I know you’ve gone out with a lot of people and I don’t know if you were serious with any of them, but I wasn’t just planning to go out with you on three dates and that was it!”
He looks like he hasn’t slept very well, and Draco mentally slaps himself for not thinking that death eaters escaping might be taking a toll on Potter.
“Harry Potter, yes.” Dumbledore says. Harry doesn’t like that he interrupted McGonagall, but he tries to keep an open mind. “Sit, my boy.”
“Something like,” Harry says. “Older wand?”
“No.” Mrs. Thomas shakes her head. “No, I can’t, I need to-”
Narcissa Malfoy touches one of the magpies on the wall, and it shudders to life. It flies around the room a few times, before dropping a painted silver ring right onto Narcissa’s hand. It becomes real when it touches her hand, glinting in the setting sunlight.
“I, uh.” He hears Ginny snickering beside him, and he elbows her in the ribs, making her yelp. “What are we eating?”
?” Draco asks, high-pitched.

“It wouldn’t have changed anything!” She defends. “Your parents probably told the Aurors and if I’d told you I’d have just upset you-”
“Is it good?” the twins ask, and that’s just one step too far for Draco.
“It slipped out!” Ron defends. “It’s not like I

“Yeah,” He says, looking away. “She thinks they’re just nightmares.”

“As in
Rose, however, is his best friend; he’d spend the rest of his life with her without batting an eye, their banter or easy silence more than enough for him to be happy.
“That will draw the death eaters there,” Molly says. “There are children.”
Draco’s arse is, and he sneers condescendingly.
“Still!” Draco says. Bill knows him better than anyone – he practically raised him, all of them, since Molly was busy often – and if Draco hadn’t told him that he wants to read it, he’d know something was up.
“The vibe in here is pretty weird,” Ginny says. “Are you guys fighting or something?”
“I don’t think they’ll be interested in me.” He says. And he’d never.
“Draco, you’ve to choose a side.” Noah says, as soon as he joins them.
Draco tries to believe him.
Potter chuckles. “Well, yeah. It wasn’t the twins, and it was a lot of magic. It’d take someone very smart and very powerful.” He smiles fondly. “And well, you’re a hellion.”
“Alright,” Hermione says, dragging out the word. “Well, we’re here because word is whoever attacked Dolohov is coming here to finish the job on Riddle’s orders, so McGonagall wanted us to back you up.”
– they wouldn’t lie to him like this. Maybe about being adopted, sure, but not about being a
Lessons with Potter also continue, and though Draco can regularly produce a patronus now, it’s not a corporeal one, so they see each other every day, at least until McGonagall announces that there’s been another death eater breakout out of Azkaban, Peter Pettigrew between them.

“I thought – I thought you were just being friendly because everyone was treating me weirdly!” Draco says.
“You can try again.” Ron says. “Come on. Three more times. That’s it. After that, I’ll leave you alone.”
– they’ll try to turn it around, convince you they don’t love you, that you’re better off with them, and darling, you need to remember you’re

“Are you okay?” Potter asks, a small frown between his brows. Draco wants to soothe it away with his thumb.
“Yes,” he says.
“I’m sorry mate.” Ron looks down at his feet. He misses his brother, but he knows that of all the ways they could’ve handled it all, they chose what was possibly the worst one, so he understands the anger. “I miss him, too.”
“We’re friends!” Draco says.
“Nothing’s wrong,” Draco looks hesitantly around. He looks like he doesn’t quite know how to fit in here anymore. It’s oddly sobering. “I-” his eyes still on Narcissa. “I know you.”

“Okay.” They all chorus.

Guided mostly on instinct, Draco pulls Harry onto the bed, sits him beside him, lets their noses rub together, their lips almost touch.
“I don’t know how you missed it!” Draco says. “Even Hermione noticed! Who, by the way, you’re never going to date unless you get your head out of your arse and ask her out.”
. Please, I – take me with you, please.”
“I’m not.” Draco says quickly. “It – we – we don’t have sex. It’s a moaning tape. It was just to convince the boys in his dorm that we were having sex.”
Potter shakes his head and grins. “Unlikely. Ginny’d kill me. Plus, you really
Luna has a black eye, and her clothes are dirtied and bloody. She doesn’t look much better than Draco did, but she sounds mild. Serene, even. Ron wonders how the hell she’s keeping calm in this situation.
“Well…” She hesitates, but finally takes a deep breath and begins talking. “Muggles have done studies on genetics. It’s science, and – well, it helps when you’re going to have a baby. You can calculate odds of them having a certain eye color, or hair color, or other traits. I saw it in school, before Hogwarts, and then we met, and, uh… it’d be impossible for him to be blond if he was born from two red-headed parents who also had two red-headed parents.”
Parkinson gives him an incredulous look. “Sex, Potter, as in, when Mommy and Daddy really, really love each other-”
Jae mocks in a high-pitched voice. “
Ron grabs her waist and pulls her into a kiss.
“Seventeen years. Voldemort is dead.”
Harry can’t say he disagrees. He knows Draco and him haven't been dating for very long - really, they've gone on
“Oh, that,” Scorpius says. “It was nothing. Voldemort tried to come back with the Philosopher’s Stone, and Rose and I went through insane trials to get to the mirror of Erised, and then Voldemort tried to kill me, but Rose had gone to get Dumbledore, so-”
Harry feels a flash of guilt go through him, and he gives her a weak smile. Her expression softens.
She looks at him “You need to stay safe.”
Harry does, shakily, and it does make him feel better, if only marginally.
“Don’t they know silencing charms?” Ron hisses, looking only a little sick.
“No.” both him and Gin mutter.
“Yeah, imagine. He spends every summer at your house anyway, you wouldn’t even have to go anywhere to shag-” Jae breaks off when he catches sight of something above them. “Is that an

Or he wishes McGonagall hadn’t considered that, since it was Saturday, his friends deserved a chance to stop by the hospital.
Draco doesn’t respond, mainly because he has no idea what she’s talking about.
“What?” He asks.
Draco nods agreeably.
“He snuck out to Knockturn.” Ron says gruffly.
? Draco thinks to himself in wonder. Really, of all the ways he could’ve imagined this moment, this was not even remotely it.
Draco freezes, and Sirius’s grin widens.
“Tomorrow afternoon, against Ravenclaw.” Ginny says. “But all of his teammates would be there, someone’s bound to notice us!”
to remember them, they’re his family! Ron could never forget them, any of them, and he knows Draco couldn’t either.
“You’re lying,” he says immediately.
After
Harry grins goofily and tilts his head to the side.
“I’m glad,” Harry says sincerely. “Do you know when you’re coming back to Hogwarts?”
“My dads joined!” Scorpius snaps angrily. “They helped!”
Alsooo yes, McGonagall is headmistress bc she's fucking badass :))
He wakes sometime later and blinks blearily. There’s a small sound of surprise beside him as he begins to stretch.
After
“Then stop bloody acting like it!” Ron roars. “Sneaking into Knockturn at night, how fucking – bloody morons – don’t even tell a guy – gonna die at seventeen, this is it – have to put a bloody
And he locks the door, wards potent around the library so Draco can’t leave. Draco cautiously takes the blindfold off himself.
“What do we do now?” Hermione asks.
People move out of their way practically
“You’re so cute!” An old witch wearing a St. Mungo’s patient’s robe, is standing in the doorway, a pink ball of fur in her arms. It has bright yellow eyes, and is staring at them unblinkingly. Harry isn’t sure
Draco’s lips twist, and he scratches uncomfortably at his forearm.
The Grey Lady glares at him. “No one will ever find it. It’s safe. It can’t do any harm anymore.”
The Hat’s voice seems to be only inside his head, and he tries not to jump in surprise; despite how much he’s been looking forward to this moment, how much he wants it, he doesn’t think he could ever quite be ready.
“Oh, unclench Weasel.” Zabini says. “It’s entirely consensual, and
takes shape.
“And how much time would we have?” Hermione asks.
“Fine,” Ron rolls his eyes. “Then me and Harry are coming with.”
She nods.
Remus watches fondly – and very, very amused – as Harry runs his hands through his hair and huffs nervously. Even without knowing it, he’s exactly as James used to be. He’s doing the exact same thing James did after Lily said yes to their first date; it’s like watching it all over again, and it makes Remus’s heart ache longingly.
“I was terrified, too,” Harry says. “And - listen, about before – I don’t
“I can’t tell.” Draco says, tone resigned. Harry doesn’t know if he’s telling the truth. For a single, terrifying moment, he thinks,
Draco has half a mind to tell Ron where to shove it, but he merely clenches his jaw and grips his wand tighter.
“You’ll need to tell us everything,” Sirius tells him. Scorpius knows he wasn’t meant to hear, but the Halloween he was six – the fifth anniversary of his parents’ death – Sirius and Remus were sitting in front of the fire drinking firewhiskey, and he heard them say no one was ever meant to raise their baby’s baby. That it was a special kind of sorrow.
Ugghh sorry for taking so long... a bunch of things got deleted from my computer,, including everything i've ever written so i'm just a bit :))))))))))))))))))))
“I think you forget I shop-lift. And this hospital doesn’t have very good security, honestly, I expected more of a challenge.” Pansy says, and she sounds disappointed by it. Shoplifting’s not a very good habit of hers, even if she’s very good at it. Draco’s almost certain it’s entirely to piss off her parents. The Parkinson’s are swimming in money, they could buy her anything she wanted. For her to steal it is insulting. “Anyway, they show that she was admitted to the hospital on June Fifth 1982.” A weird look crosses her face, and she looks at Draco. “The day of your birthday, actually. They say she gave birth to a baby boy…”
“Oh no,” Ron says apprehensively. “I don’t like the Slytherins! And Parkinson and Zabini are-”
stage was supposed to be
“Of course not, ‘Mione.” Ron soothes, and Ginny and Draco smirk at each other. His crush on Hermione is painfully obvious, and for all the brains Hermione has, Draco doesn’t think she knows. “He’s my baby brother though, I’m allowed to tease him.”
Which is exactly what happens.
And he practically flies out of the room as quickly as he can.
Draco frowns. “It’s not your fault.”
“Oh, right.” Ginny says with a wicked smirk. “I was supposed to tell you Harry was here.”
“I don’t care.” Ron says, with a glare down at the paper. “I need to know they’re alright.”
Draco rolls his eyes and grabs the bag from Blaise.
Draco doesn’t really know what to say. He’d introduce himself, but the woman seems to already know his name, so he doesn’t.
“Well, what were we going to say?” Fred asks. “He’s our brother anyhow. It doesn’t change anything.”
Draco’s stomach sinks, and Luna’s hand squeezes his hard. Draco lets go of her, because they know – from experience – that if they come get one of them and they won’t let go of each other, they’ll just torture them both.
Remus hums. “Flowers are a nice gesture. Do you know what kind he likes?”
She smiles relieved.
The waitress arrives with their food – Narcissa ordered him something, apparently, because the waitress places a plate full of food in front of him – and Narcissa smiles and thanks her.
“If the aurors have reason to believe that they would try to come to Hogwarts the children have a right to know.” Professor Lupin says. Draco respects him a lot, and he’s the best defense against the dark arts teacher he’s had, so he’s glad he stayed even after Snape told everyone he was a werewolf.
“Clearly you wouldn’t,” Ron spits. “Because you’re not doing it.”
“Err, no.” He manages, sinking deeper into his chair.
The wizards – Draco suspects they’re Spanish Aurors – yell something after them, but Narcissa merely quickens her pace.
“I’m telling him, I didn’t think I wanted kids, either,” Mrs. Thomas says excitedly. “But then you have them inside you, and you love them! I mean, I cried every day of my pregnancy, and I couldn’t move and had to be on bedrest for two months, and I got a horrible infection while giving birth, but in the end I got my own little Sophie!”
“Are you okay? Should I go with you?”
“Dobby, sir.” The house elf seems nervous.
Draco huffs and rolls his eyes. They step out to the dining room, and Draco’s momentarily frozen by the sight of Harry fucking Potter – Ron’s best friend, savior of the wizarding world as a one year old, and Draco’s crush for longer than he’ll ever admit to anyone – sitting at the table.
Draco’s cheeks are burning, but he nods quickly, and really, it’s the best choice he’s made in his entire life.
“I was so worried.” She keeps murmuring, whether to herself or to Draco she’s not sure. “So worried. I thought you were dead.”
They place a mild disillusionment charm on each other, and then sneak out, making their way into Knockturn.
The next morning, the day of the wedding, Molly wakes all of them at seven a.m.
“We didn’t.”
It feels odd to talk about his birth mother like that, like someone who existed. Someone who, logically, would’ve been a huge part in Draco’s life, and now isn’t a part at all.
him?” Draco asks.
“I think you know the answer to that.” He says quietly.
in case this is a bit confusing, Draco's been avoiding Harry for about a week or two, so they haven't talked about the love confession.
“No, Draco, it’s not like that,” Harry tries, untangling himself from Zabini to get off the bed. He can’t let Draco think that he wants Zabini like that, not when Draco’s the only one Harry’s wanted for the longest time now, wrapped safely in his arms.
Half hoping he won’t.
are.”
“I know.” She says. “The teachers don’t want us to worry, but it’s everywhere. You-know-who-” she grimaces. “Voldemort seems to be planning something.”
Okay so I'm officially in f i n a l s so if someone would like to like,, m u r d e r me that'd be great thanks :))
“Prefects, take the students back to your dormitories. The Welcome feast will be continued there.”
He wonders what he’ll do if it works. For all the confidence with which he’d told Harry he’d find a way, he’s not sure. Even if Basilisk venom does work, there’s no way Harry’ll drink it and survive. Draco’s been spending more of his time on Horocrux research than on classes, and he’s getting desperate. There’s very little information on the subject, and he hasn’t found anything about a person being a Horocrux.
Potter and Granger are with him, and they usher him and his friends out of the cramped portrait hole.
A crooked grin. “I just told
The light from the spell Nott casts is blinding, but Parkinson is the most impressive dueler Scorpius has seen in his life, because she counters it wordlessly; it’s quick, it’s bright, and it’s brutal, and when it’s over, a body hits the floor.
He feels the knot of anxiety loosen in his chest.
“Merlin,” Hermione mutters anxiously. She’s more worried than he thought she’d be – Harry, too, he’s been worried and anxious since it happened – and though he knows it’s completely ridiculous, he feels a little bit jealous.
“And the good news?” Fleur asks anxiously.
It still bothers him, that Draco didn’t tell him, but he doesn’t want to get mad without speaking to him first. Of course, with McGonagall fuming at him and Ginny and then Ron getting protective, they’d had little chance last night.
Luna smiles airily.
“Shit,” Ginny says, impressed. “You’re furious.”
McGonagall shakes her head, and Bill breathes out.
is it?
“No idea.” Harry frowns, too. “Want to check?”
“You can find the ones in the manor. You need to.” She says over the nose. “You’re the only one who can figure it out, Draco.”
“Oh no.” He says. “No! Definitely not!” he throws a beseeching look at Ron. “How are you on board with this?! It would involve me seeing Draco naked! While he’s not aware I’m there! It’s all sorts of creepy!”
They all shake their heads. From what Ron knows, to be able to do it they must run in the family, and they’re abilities that the Weasleys don’t have. The Malfoy’s, on the other hand…
Draco was thinking of the same Christmas Potter just mentioned. Him and Ginny were the only ones not at Hogwarts yet, and Charlie and Bill came home for it, so that Christmas was the first time they saw their whole family together in a long time.
“It says here that the container it’s in has to be destroyed beyond Magical repair.” Draco says, rubbing at his eyes tiredly. “I don’t even know how to do that. There’re very few things beyond magical repair.”
Who else is an orphan?”
“Those are all my notes. He has more in his dorm.”
Draco doesn’t know what to say.
As the night progresses, he’s getting more and more anxious because the only places he’s finding anything about Horocruxes are in books about extremely Dark Magic and Necromancy, and he’s not sure this is something he wants to mess with.
“That’s not what this is about.” He says.
Draco glares at him and wipes his nose. The back of his hand comes down wet with blood.
And he leaves.
“McGonagall let me stay with you.” Draco says. Minerva McGonagall’s been Head Auror for over twenty five years now, longer than Harry’s been alive; appointing her was the single best decision the DMLE ever made. “Everyone else is going back to the precinct.”
Pansy nods knowingly.
“Dreams.” Potter repeats. “More like nightmares, really. About Voldemort. Kind of – kind of like I
Merlin, but this would be exactly the kind of thing he would go to Blaise to talk to about. He’s not stupid enough to go wondering around Hogsmeade in the dark, not with everything the Death Eaters have been doing, so he goes straight to the only place Draco thinks could make him feel better right now.

, Draco darling, you
work.” Blaise nods approvingly. “I mean, Potter’s bi, right? He’s got eyes, and your arse is spectacular. Flaunt it. Maybe bend over.”
“I’m… not sure.” He admits. “I thought I was, but he might’ve thought I was just being friendly? I don’t know.”
“McGonagall practically told me to stay out of it.” He says. “That they’d take care of it.”
he thinks. Certain that he’s not going to fall to his death soon, he stands, and walks around the small cell twice again, feet dragging on the stone floor.
He’s itching for it, if he’s honest. Hogwarts, even with people looking and treating him oddly – and they will – is still better than being stuck in the tiny hospital room with only his mum and Charlie for company.
that that’s the Malfoy family crest.”
“Have you heard?” The witch behind them in the line asks the wizard she’s with. “They say You-Know-Who might be back.”
“Fine,” Ron grumbles. “But I’m not inviting them up to our dorm.”
“Of course,” Luna rests her head against his shoulder.
“I’m not going to do that!” Draco says indignantly.
“What?” Draco asks. “No!”
Draco shakes his head lightly. “Someone who can do something, I mean. McGonagall, maybe. Professor Lupin.”
“Goodbye, Harry.” He says.
“You’ve got it.” Rose doesn’t even ask what he needs help with.
A beat of silence, and Draco gets the feeling Potter doesn’t want to talk about this any longer, so he changes the subject.
Draco hugs Fleur, and she immediately steals him away to her bedroom – which is Bill’s, actually.
“There’s sign of great psychological strain.” She says. “How long did you say he’s been gone?”
“He wants you.” She tells him.
kind of situation never ends well. It’s either in or out, especially with people. Anything in the middle lands him in a mess and leaves him with a bad taste of mouth.

“You’re

, he knows it’s not real. It can’t be.
“Loo?” Draco asks disbelievingly. “Don’t you think they’ll begin to wonder after you’ve been in the ‘loo’ for three hours?”
“Hermione!” Ginny and Ron say at the same time, alarmed.
They push through the crowd of students, and when he catches sight of white-blond hair, he knows his gut feeling was right.
, even if it’s not with him, even if he’ll never get to see him grow old like he wanted, if they won’t ever have kids -
Draco hesitates. “I – alright.”
“I am.”

He sees him throw concerned glances at him once in a while, but Draco resolutely ignores them and tightens his jaw every time it happens. By the time the wedding comes, Draco’s jaw is painfully tight.
“You knew that?” Ron demands. “Why wouldn’t you tell me?”
friends-”
Scorpius sits in front of the mirror of Erised for what feels like an eternity or two. There are a lot of things he doesn’t remember about his parents; their voices, for one, or the way he’s been told his father used to sing when he cooked, but he’d know their faces with his eyes closed.
“You thought I asked you out because of
“Right, yeah,” Harry says, frowning. “I wasn’t setting up cover, was I?”
“The Baron did the same thing to me.” she says softly. “When I refused him, he killed me.”
“You’re not sending that Owl.” Harry says. It’s the first thing he’s said to either of them in weeks.
“Right,” Harry says, a little overwhelmed. “Yes, we’ll begin trying soon, Mrs. Thomas, don’t worry. We actually need to be alone with Mr. Dolohov here, because he might wake up at any moment, and we need to speak to him.”
Hermione goes red. “It doesn’t matter. The point is we have a no-questions-I-won’t-tell-if-you-don’t-mutual-destruction sort of agreement, so he doesn’t ask questions, and we’ve actually found a lot of things.”
“Does that mean it’s over?” Harry asks, frowning.
She turns around and floats back to the window, and Draco takes a deep breath and walks towards her.
giving me grey hair?! Do you
It’s been a few weeks since Harry’d come running into the common room and proceeded to completely
Draco wants to stomp his foot. Of fucking course it bothers him! It makes him want to hex the professor, and the only reason Draco hasn’t done it is because he respects him a little bit too much to do that.

“They can be happy!” Ron says. “I just don’t like my best mate snogging my baby brother when I’m eating!”
“I know,” her smile is sad. “I know they are. And don’t let anyone tell you they’re not; your father, the death eaters,
“Whatever is bothering you, you can tell us.” She says gently.
“Sometimes.” He says instead. “Have you gotten another letter from the Malfoy’s?”
They walk into the café and a waitress gives them a table for two. Narcissa orders whatever the hell a Capuccino is, and Draco stays quiet. Still, the waitress brings him a few bandage-like-sticky-things. She speaks in Spanish, so Draco doesn’t understand, but she places one across his chin and another one on his temple. She must be a muggle, because she doesn’t heal him, just sticks them to his skin.
Draco’s sitting with his friends in the Hufflepuff table, and he looks distracted. Harry tears his eyes away and finds Hermione looking at him thoughtfully.
“You were moaning Potter’s name real pretty.” Pansy teases. “Breathy and whiny, sort of like
“Shut the bloody fuck up.” Ron snaps, as he begins to drag him away. He tries to calm himself, not the anger, but the vicious fear at seeing his brother’s face covered with blood and already littered with bruises that will likely just get worse in the next twelve hours.
“Little brother?” Pansy supplies helpfully.
“Thank you,” Draco says politely as Ditzy the house-elf gives him a bowl of mint-chocolate ice cream. She bows lightly and beams at him before leaving, and they move to Draco’s dorm in the Hufflepuff dorms for more privacy.
He’d talked in his sleep all the time, half delirious; muttering about magpies and various words in what Ron thinks ought to be Spanish, even mentioned Harry’s name once or twice.
Harry does a quick look around the room; there are seven death eaters in the room, Voldemort probably already on his way. They need to get out of there
Draco feels his face grow hot, and he glares at Thomas venomously. “
, how does one
Draco wakes up cold and alone. The floor he’s lying on is damp and uneven. He thinks, for a moment, that the reason he can’t see is because he’s been blindfolded, but he’s not. His next conclusion is that he’s been blinded, and the panic rises in him like a tide wave. He forces himself to breathe, forces himself to
As soon as they see them, they frown.
“Oh,” Pansy says. “I say snog him.”
?” He asks. “Harry’s God-father?”
They all sit around him – except for Ginny, who gets into the hospital bed with him and grips his hand tightly – but stay quiet.
you’ve every right to be angry-”
this might be a little shorter than the others, but I hope you enjoyed it babes <33
It’s making him increasingly frustrated.
“We don’t know, either.” Ron says. “But Malfoy seems convinced that you’ll know. He’ll try to get you.”
“It was a ministry Owl, wasn’t it?” Thomas says. “Do you think one of the professors has done something?”
“Take me with you,” he says softly.
“I baked like seven treacle tarts over the summer.” Draco says. “I think he thinks I like baking now. It was embarrassing.”
Blaise’s is a sleek black panther that prowls around proudly, knocking Draco on his arse more than once.
Even if it’s just for a little while.
Even Hermione seems to be hiding things from him – whenever he tries to ask her about why exactly they’re researching Horocruxes, she sort of clamps up and tries to change the subject. She’s an acceptable liar, but only as long as long as she has the lie planned – so he finds himself spending an increasing amount of time alone.
“Merlin, Harry, you were really scared, weren’t you?” she asks.
He doesn’t trust Draco not to follow him, of course he doesn’t. He takes him to the Great Hall with his family, where they're all kneeling over Fred, who’s still cracking jokes. No one will look at him, but Harry’s alright with that; Draco won’t look away, and that’s really all he needs.
“What did Dumbledore say?” Draco asks, and Harry’s heart sinks again.
“That’s not what I meant.”
doesn’t talk as often about it.”
They’re taking this better than he thought they would.
Harry rolls his eyes. “Not from sixteen year old wizards.”
It’s relatively quiet on Sunday, and then they all pack up and get on the Hogwarts express to the Weasley’s for Bill and Fleur’s wedding. They’re getting married Friday, and Draco can barely contain his excitement, even if he is a little nervous about seeing his mum for the first time since he found out he was adopted.
“Merlin, sorry, just trying to help.” She rolls her eyes.
“Then why hadn’t they told you this, huh?” Malfoy sneers. “Have they ever discussed the war with you? They’ve been talking about it since the beginning of the year. They haven’t told you because they don’t think you can handle it. They think you’re a child that needs protecting. Isn’t that what they’ve always told you? That you need them big, strong, Gryffindors to protect you?”
“Don’t do that again.” He whispers. “Disappear again, not letting me know if you’re alright. I can’t take it.”
He locks himself in the seventh floor bathrooms – the most discreet place he could think of – and takes Lucius Malfoy’s letter out of his pocket.
“I think it’s technically Saturday already.” Granger says. “We are doing research.”
“Harry Potter, I swear to god-”
Ron has the decency to look ashamed, but Ginny does no such thing.
while she hisses at them furiously, Professor Lupin, and Sirius Black all standing around.
Draco waves them both away impatiently, and Harry decides that they’ll definitely revisit this subject later.
“Sorry doesn’t bloody fix anything-”
“You might as well have.” Thomas snickers. “Are you going to shag him?”
“That Voldemort was back,” Harry says. Every person in the room flinches, even if it was something they already knew. “Mentioned something about an old wand-”
They stay like that for as long as they can.
McGonagall shakes her head lightly. “He always was very creative with his charm work. What did he say about the others, then?”
“Close your mouth,” Blaise reminds him, and Draco does, quickly.
“Oh yeah?” Ron asks. He stands and folds the paper. “Try and stop me.”
“There’s no choice,” He shrugs. “We stay.”
“I’m a Weasley. We eat.” He says, because it’s the only thing he can say. He stands up. “And you’re not real.”
, no. I don’t even
Mrs. Thomas looks more and more uncertain, and, when Harry puts his hand on the bomb to take it from her, she doesn’t protest.
“I miss my family.” He whispers. “I miss Harry.” The admission makes him feel like his heart has been carved out. He snorts humorlessly. “I miss my bed.”
feel free to scream at me at the comments now babes :D
“Theo’s deaf, so he never remembers, and Draco forgets we exist.” Zabini answers, looking all too used to this for Harry’s liking.
“It’s alright,” Harry cups his face, and Draco’s sob is enough to break his heart, enough to make him want to stay. He’d be selfish for this; he’d stay, he’d run away, he’d doom the rest of the world if only he and Draco could have a different fate.
“Sirius Black,” he says coolly, stretching out his hand. “I believe we haven’t met.”
“What?” she asks him.
Even the name makes his heart pound faster and his throat close up. He’s not going to be scared of Smith, no matter what he’s done to him; he refuses to be.
to know. He doesn’t know what could’ve been with his birth parents; it couldn’t have possibly been any better than what he has right now; His family loves him, and Draco loves them back, and he knows with unwavering certainty that he’ll die for them before he does a god damned thing for Lucius Malfoy.
It’s Draco who makes a small noise now, a sort of sigh of relief, and Hermione covers his mouth the way he is covering hers.
“Mr. Weasley!” There’s a sharp voice, and Draco knows
“Still, that was amazing!” Potter says. “You’ll be able to do it in no time.”
Malfoy is silent.
“I can
“Anthony asked me on a date last Saturday,” Draco waves it away.
“I’m serious!” she says. “It’s the perfect opportunity! He’s your brother’s best friend, he’s staying at your house! Just wear something slutty around the house.”
Monday is Draco’s first day back to classes, and though people
“Happens to all of us, darling.” She says empathetically.
Harry looks up at him briefly before he looks away, towards the windows. They’re walking towards Herbology, and Ron can’t help bringing it up. “Yeah.”
“Yeah.” Harry grimaces.
She signals between him and Harry, and this was
“I can’t just what?” Draco demands, before he processes completely what Harry just said. “Wait,
?” he asks. He’s fallen right on his arse and it
“Don’t.” Ron snaps. “Do you
“Basilisk venom?” he repeats.
“Time isn’t real.” Harry says, voice muffled.
Narcissa Black’s smile is terrifying. “When they do, I’ll be long gone. And they won’t be able to move.”
“Oh, how silly of me, I forgot to introduce myself.” She says. “I’m Aida Thomas. I’m in the room next door.” She looks at Draco and then at Harry. “You know, you should have kids soon. You’re both very attractive, but neither of you are getting any younger!”
A strong, white light emerges from the tip of his wand, and it almost,
And he leaves the dining room.
Draco nods. “I have to.” He stands, stumbles lightly since his legs are half-asleep. “I’ll see you at dinner, alright Harry?”
“Err,” Harry scratches at the back of his neck. “No.”
“I was trying to protect you-”
“Merlin, you can’t even be bothered to deny it, can you?” he asks. “Have you nothing to say for yourselves?”
“This nerd is,” Ron snickers, and Draco shoots him an angry glare.
It’s quick, and it’s brutal. Draco thinks Harry’s already left until he catches sight of green eyes, looking straight at him, shouting something that Draco doesn’t understand. It’s only a second of distraction, but it’s also his downfall.
before Flitwick fixed it – and raises his wand.
“’Mione, if you weren’t it wouldn’t be you,” Ron teases gently.
okay?”
“What do we do now?” Blaise asks. “We can’t tell anyone.”
, and so, so
“Your brother…” Molly sighs. “Draco’s adopted.”
He wants revenge, he wants to
“You’re not dumb.” Harry says softly. “You’re the smartest person I know.”
“It was,” Mrs. Thomas assured darkly. Abruptly, she brightens again. “But I got a baby out of it!”
“What did you do?” Blaise asks curiously.
Sirius and Remus are staring at him like they’ve seen a ghost, and Teddy is looking anywhere but at him.
Draco pulls away lightly.
“Done.” She says. “He was in Granada, Spain.”
Draco nods and moves to sit on the chair beside Harry’s. As soon as he’s within reach, Harry reaches over and links their hands together, peppering kisses on Draco’s knuckles.
Harry steps closer to his husband and grabs his chin, making him look towards him.
They always take a vote, and if the majority says yes, the person who said no accompanies them anyway. It’s teamwork.
His dads, hand in hand, standing beside him like they were always meant to, standing next to each other like a choice they made, over and over, even if it got them killed. Scorpius wonders if they’d do it differently, if they could.
The other part of him knows it’s incredibly selfish of him, especially considering just how much he’s been lying to Draco lately. It’s good that he has a friend – or whatever it is him and Nott are – that can take care of him when he needs it. And Nott apparently does that, probably better than Harry does.
Draco nods reluctantly.
“Why?” she asks.
“You are?” Draco practically beams up at him, face glowing.
“In case you’re deaf, Smith, Draco said to let go.” Harry responds coldly.
“Exactly
“I’m not willing to raise a human being on ‘trying my best’, Harry,” Draco says. “‘Trying my best’ means
“It was for a good cause,” He defends weakly.
“What?” Draco asks, frowning. He shivers involuntarily at the mention of you-know-who. “Why would you think that?”
?” Ron demands.
“You said you were in love with me.” He says, slowly, grip on Draco’s hand tightening slightly as if afraid he’ll run away.
“Oh,” Draco tucks a strand of wavy hair behind his ear. Ginny just cut it, so it’s short in the back and on the sides, but it’s longer at the top, white blond, and shiny, and so fucking
Lupin seems more relaxed. “Okay. Now come on. Since we’re going to have so many dementors flying around, you’ll need to learn the Patronus charm a bit earlier than I had planned. We’ll need more space.”
, but Harry’s sitting at one end of the table, looking supremely uncomfortable, and Bill, his mum, Charlie, Fred, and George at the other end, with crossed arms and frowns on their faces.
“What do you have for us, Fletcher?” Ginny asks impatiently. She doesn’t like being here with Draco; he’s her baby brother, and she doesn’t feel quite certain on her ability to protect him here, so she always tries to get them out as soon as possible.
“I wouldn’t.” Pansy says sharply. “I’ll run away. I’ll die before I become one of them.”
“Have you gotten into Potter’s pants yet?” Is the first thing Blaise asks when he comes into the train compartment.
“We know, mate.” He says.
department’s care. I have never spoken to him, I’ve never seen him, and if I had been in contact with him before today I wouldn’t have brought the letter to Headmistress McGonagall!”
“I never said that!” Draco says hotly, face burning.
ask you to do this.”
“Hey,” Harry nudges gently at Draco’s shoulder, slightly out of breath because he ran through the courtyard just to catch the blond on his way to class. He’s going to have to come up with a good excuse to tell Ron as to why he’s spending so much time with his little brother. As it is, Hermione’s already giving him constant knowing looks anytime he mentions or looks at Draco. “What’re you doing for Christmas?”
“Mr. Weasley, I’m going to ask you again, and I want you to be truthful.” The auror that’s questioning him has a scruffy beard and clearly thinks Draco’s lying. “Have you been in previous contact with Lucius Malfoy?”
go with them, it’s his fight, after all.
“I can give you that.” Malfoy says.
“What letters?” McGonagall asks.
“Draco!” Blaise Zabini’s a Slytherin his year, and though they’re not in the same house, him and Pansy Parkinson are Draco’s best friends.
“We have him,” Hermione’s otter Patronus says. “White man, mid-thirties, unarmed and wandless but with a picture of Dolohov.”
He writes home to Teddy, Sirius, and Remus; he knows Teddy wanted him to be sorted into Hufflepuff, and though Sirius and Remus pretend not to care, they wanted him to be in Gryffindor; after all, his father was, too.
Sooooooo I know of literally no hufflepuff boys in Ginny's year, so I had to create some..... hope you enjoyed the chapter :)))
He walks back to Hogwarts, and the second Draco steps through the door, Ron and Ginny are on him.
Draco flinches. “I – we – I didn’t know how else. We didn’t have anything to offer, and – I’m going to find a way, Harry. I have to.”
“You did it.” Harry repeats. “Did what?”
They continue practicing the Patronus charm for the next couple weeks, but even as everyone else accomplishes it, Draco can barely manage a bit of silver mist.
“And let’s not forget the Aurors know about this.” Draco says. “So it must be important, right?”
His siblings and his mother stare at them suspiciously. Fleur and Ginny seem terribly amused, though at least Fleur is trying to hide her laughter behind her hand.
Up until now, Narcissa has kept herself at a distance from Draco, uncertain of where she fits here. The Weasley’s… they’re a family. They’re her baby’s family, and even if she wanted to take him away from them – which she does want, so,
“What list?” One of the twins asks.
Thomas huffs. “Then who do
year where you’re not causing any trouble?!”
Ron, Potter, and Granger stand close together, and Draco sees Potter’s holding a piece of parchment in one hand and some sort of silver cloak on the other. Before he can ask about either, someone speaks.
Parkinson cackles delightedly.
The man has white, long hair, and a matching beard. He has twinkling eyes, and he’s sitting in a small couch with a steaming mug.
He’s never kissed anyone like this before. He’s never really kissed anyone, other than Theo, and those were chaste kisses at best.
“What are you doing here?” Harry asks, pulling on a shirt. Draco’s half sure he’s drooling.
drew his parents crazy with the curse, and they didn’t deserve it. Draco’s shaking, unable to breathe, suddenly.
?” Draco asks.
She looks at Draco and then down at the file. Then at Blaise, then at Draco again, and then at Lucius Malfoy’s mugshot. Her mouth’s half-open.
“Listen to me, Draco, please.” Harry says. Draco looks away, and his cheeks redden in anger, and his forehead tightens in a frown, but he listens. “
“He’s not into me! he’s teaching me how to do a Patronus.” Draco defends.
“You’re always eating.” Harry points out.
He misses sleeping comfortably, not having nightmares.
Hermione’s quiet.
“What?” he asks.
Ron feels sick. “Why didn’t you tell me?”
“I heard you know.” He says vaguely, and Draco’s eyes narrow.
She looks around carefully, and Draco can see two wizards whispering quickly. She purses her lips and stands up, so Draco does, too. She throws several bills on the table and walks quickly out of the café. The two wizards follow them.
“We need to get to Hogwarts.” Narcissa points out. Harry knows she’s right, even if he’s tired of this. All of this. He feels oddly jumpy without Draco in his arms or in the room, and he’s trying not to let it get to him.
I didn’t and you knew
“McGonagall’s going to be our moderator,” Draco informs him brightly; McGonagall is sitting on Dolohov’s bed, regal as ever, in black formal robes and a pointed hat.
“Precisely.” Pansy says, wicked gleam in her eyes. She loves knowing things others don’t, and she’s very good at finding out things people don’t want her knowing about. She’d be an outstanding unspeakable, if she ever starts acting out on what she wants and not only on what her parents don’t. “And that’s the only thing. I had to find newspapers from a long,
Narcissa gives him a look that he can’t quite decipher.
“Either way, someone’s read it?” Pansy asks. Draco nods. “Good. Then we’ve-”
“Did you know the Bloody Baron killed the Grey Lady?” he asks. “He wanted to date her, and when she said no he killed her.”
He’s so immersed in that thought that he completely misses the way Harry’s whole face lights up.
His words keep getting louder and louder until he’s roaring, and Draco cringes.
“I came back a few minutes after I left,” Draco tells him. “I only went to get a coffee.”
“Ron!”
There are magpies painted on the walls – thirteen of them, Draco has counted – and a sun, high on the wall, right above the nursery. He doesn’t know why, but he thinks that’s important.
“Get them out of here.” She barks.
“There’s no problem,” he lies. The problem is that he can’t stop thinking about his parents, about the fact that they were here, where he is, and if he concentrates he can almost imagine them next to him.
“Err, fine.” Harry says uncertainly. Then he addresses Draco. “I wanted to see how you were doing. We.
. Potter also thinks Draco’s a Hellion, but Draco’s going to ignore that part.
. And in the end,
!” And it’s an unforgivable, of course, what comes out of his mouth. He watches  Greyback  howl, writhe in pain, and, all of a sudden, he’s hit by the desperate
“Voldemort split his soul into Horocruxes.” Hermione explains. “Pieces of his soul. The list you left for Harry, we think it has all of them.” She doesn’t mention that Harry’s in that list, and neither does Draco. There are some things that are best kept private. “The diadem's here in the castle, we think.”
“And look where that got them!” Sirius rarely raises his voice, but he does now. “Look where that got them, Scorpius! In an early grave, leaving their one-year-old
“You’re lying!” Bellatrix screams.
Back to the story tho, it was pointed out to me by a comment that I haven't said soooo:::
“Well it’s not like we’re family or anything, is it?” Draco asks. He has his hands in his pockets and what he can imagine is an ugly sneer on his face. His muscles aren’t used to it, and it feels weird, but Draco can’t manage another expression at the moment.
“But it can’t be Potter, because he does know things about his parents.” Thomas points out.
Draco snorts from where he’s still banging his head against the wall. “As if.”
“Yeah,” Harry says, smiling down at him. “Definitely.”
“I’m sorry.” Draco says, because he feels like he has to. “That I scared you. I didn’t mean to.”
And don’t get him wrong, he loves his mum, he loves Charlie, but when they’re worried about him they’re absolutely suffocating.
Draco can’t help the smile that spreads across his face at the memory.
“Don’t think about him.” Sirius waves it away. “And I was asking about the letter we got that you had been in an accident?”
Draco wakes when there’s a sharp kick to his side. He rolls to his side and coughs, blood staining the stone of the cells beneath Malfoy manor. He’s still here.
“More than the Dark Lord?”
“We’re done.” He snaps. “I don’t want to – I don’t want to talk to you.”
“You want us to
Draco smiles, and Potter casts a Tempus charm.
He grins goofily at her. “As you should.”
In a very controlled reaction, he screams and falls off the bed.
“Now,” He says, very calmly. “You’re going to explain everything to me.”
“Hello Draco,” a voice says.
“I do
it is, if he’s honest. “Did I hear
“I,” Fleur says, sitting on the bed. “Want you to be my – my honor – my man? My best maid?”
Draco turns back, manages to catch sight of dark, long hair, a sharp jaw.
And deep, deep down, Draco knows he never could. Until a few minutes ago he
“You know,” Hermione says attentively, and Harry knows already what she’s going to suggest. It’s the same thing she’s been suggesting for weeks now. “This would be easier if we asked him. And he could help a lot – he’s really smart-”
“Who came to you?” Harry asks.
“Like you weren’t doing the same.” He mutters sullenly.
Ron huffs angrily. “If that greasy-haired bastard thinks he’s getting his hands on
Harry laughs softly. “I wouldn’t.”
“None of our business?” Ginny repeats. “
“Shower?” Ron guesses.
And he walks away before Potter can argue.
“Actually, Mrs. Weasley, I-” Potter begins, evidently reluctant to be away from Draco.
“You,” she says, finally letting go of her laughter. “Need to tell me
“Potter?” Snape asks after a beat, looking back at the mirror. “Yes. Very.”
part of this war?”
When they get off the train, his mum is there waiting for them, and there’re a few moments of tense silence before she grabs him and pulls him to her chest, hugging him tightly.
Overall, he’s feeling incredibly lonely.
He’s never had such a hard time finding something to say to Harry. So of course, he does what he does best; he makes a complete fool of himself by opening his big careless mouth.
a choice like that? Stay, fight for what’s right, lose not only yourself, but your loved ones in the process – because no one who’s faught in a war has come out the same and Draco isn’t ready to rebuild himself from nothing – or leave. Spend the rest of your life running, from one bad guy or another, from the past, from yourself. Lose yourself in the process, anyway.
Harry cups his cheek, softly presses his lips against his forehead and takes a shaky breath. “Merlin, Draco you don’t know how badly I want that.”
In Scorpius’s second year, when the Chamber of Secrets is opened and Lilianne Crabbe declares Mudbloods will die, Scorpius gets letters from Sirius and Remus, Teddy, his grandma Molly, his uncle Ron, and his aunt Hermione.
“Why do they think it’s from Lucius Malfoy?” Blaise asks abruptly. He shoots an apologetic look at Pansy, and though she glares lightly, she doesn’t continue when she was saying.
“He’s a
“Rest, my darling,” she whispers. “You’ve done so much. It’s okay now. I’ll take care of it.” Ron’s hand tightens around Draco’s. “Dobby told me you figured it out. I knew you would. You’re so smart, darling. I love you so much.”
Harry isn’t stupid enough to think he can convince him otherwise. They sit together in the stairs, hands linked together, fingers intertwined.
?” Potter asks.
“You did?” McGonagall asks, eyes widening behind her glasses.
“Well, we knew that.” Fred says.
“Horcruxes.” Narcissa clarifies.
They continue to talk in quieter voices, and Thomas nudges him forward so they can get closer and hear better, so Draco takes a step. The stone under his feet is rough and uneven, and Draco gasps as he stumbles. He nearly crashes through the portrait they’re listening through, but a hand grabs at the back of shirt, managing to stop him when his nose is half an inch from the portrait.
?” McGonagall and Harry ask at the same time.
They stay like that, in silence, until Harry lies down with Draco on top of him, legs tangled together and chests pressed against each other. It’s Saturday, so they don’t have to be up until Harry has to meet McGonagall. He keeps one hand on Draco’s hip and the other one running softly up and down his side until his boyfriend’s breathing evens out.
Her cheeks redden slightly, and he looks at the cloak in her hands.
“Make me.” Snape responds easily.
“I hate baking.”
?!” Harry asks.
I love Draco, and I’ll be damned if I let him go without a fight,
“Going home.” Draco gives him an amused look. They keep walking, though a lot slower than Draco was originally going. “It’s Bill and Fleur’s wedding, remember?” his face falls. “Are you not coming anymore?”
know, and they’ve all been lying to your face. Do you think it’s because they love you? No, Draco, it’s because they’re selfish. They don’t want you to know because they’re afraid of what you might do. They don’t trust you to make your own decisions.”
That means he doesn’t know yet. Draco snorts and rolls his eyes at his friends’ bickering.
“No.” Harry answers immediately. Draco’s heart skips a beat. “No, Draco, it’s too dangerous, please. I need – I need to know you’re safe, I need you here.”
It’s not the healthiest coping mechanism, but it’s much better than waking Harry up at night screaming and having to relive the horror of the war every waking minute.

“From Lucius Malfoy. Except they’re not from Lucius Malfoy, we think.” Harry says.
you, ‘I never want to do that’.” Draco exclaims. “You agreed, you said ‘me neither’.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry kisses him again, and Draco melts against his body. He’s pulled into Harry’s lap, and
“He’ll try to take what he wants.” She says.
He looks around to try to find the alley where he came from, and he steels, heart beating in his ears, as he sees someone staring at him from across the street. The woman is tall, and she’s looking at Draco like it hurts her to do so.
“With Draco.” She finishes.
still not enough, Draco’s going insane. He’s seen Lucius Malfoy on every single god damn trip to Hogsmeade he’s made since he got back, and he keeps on dreaming of some blonde woman teaching him Occlumency and he knows that’s insane – not to mention impossible, considering there’s
“Fine.” He grumbles.
Ron raises an eyebrow. “Were you
, sends him crashing back into one of the tables, hitting his head on the edge of it.
“Now, now, Draco, let’s not be hasty.” Smith practically purrs, taking a seat next to him. “There’s something we’ve to talk about.”
“If you see anything,” McGonagall continues. “And I mean
He presses himself against the corner furthest from the cell bars, and sinks down onto the floor, shaking like a leaf. He desperately tries to think of something to do, anything to keep the panic that’s threatening to suffocate him at bay, but he can’t think.
“Definitely.” Draco says, then curses himself for sounding so eager. “Err, yes.”
“Of course, Headmistress,” Sprout says agreeably, and turns on her heel.
“Draco needs to be taken home.” She says. “He looks hurt. Luna, too, and they need to rest. I’ll join you when I’m done here. I won’t take long.”
“I know,” Harry murmurs against his neck, pressing a soft kiss to the soft skin. “I believe you.”
The Grey Lady looks outside.
“I come in peace.” He says. The smug grin on his face tells a completely different story.
“And what about Smith?” Ron asks. “Why did you hex him?”
Harry’s demeanor softens. He takes a bite out of the chocolate and swallows before he answers.
“Well, Mr. Potter,” Sprout says, frowning. “I was going to ask Mr. Weasley the youngest and Thomas Franco. They’ve always had a particular talent – not to say willingness – at sneaking around the castle.” She pauses and gives him a chance to complain. “Unless you know any reason why I shouldn’t?”
“Loo.” She says.
Harry pulls him in for a deep kiss.
“I’m not a nerd.” He hisses, reaching across Potter to pinch Ron’s arm. He yelps, flinching, and Draco gives him a self-satisfied smile. It’s Ron who glares this time.
“He likes you, too, you know?” She says conversationally, though she does lower her voice. “Ron would understand.”
“You’ve done enough,” Ginny says, quietly, but there is no
Draco slips into Harry’s bed, as quietly as he can, and lets himself calm down with the feeling of Harry’s arms wrapped around him, his chest against Draco’s back, their legs tangled together.
bit of what he’s done to dozens of other people, to pay for the harm that he’s caused.
“Even if you’re telling the truth.” He says. “It doesn’t matter. It doesn’t mean anything.”
“What’s the point of adopting them when they’re older if that’s not what you want, Harry? I know you; I’ve seen you get all starry-eyed for babies. That’s your entire fantasy, holding your baby in your arms.”
“We’re not-” Harry begins.
“Well, we won’t speak of Potter anymore, then.” Pansy says. She pulls her feet up on Blaise’s lap, and he pulls his feet onto Draco’s lap on the seat in front, and Draco rests his feet on the seat. “Are you guys hungry? I’m famished.”
“Okay, Harry.” He says tremulously.
please
He really is. He can regularly produce a non-corporeal Patronus now, but Harry doesn’t know why he’s having so much trouble with producing a corporeal.
would you sneak into KNOCKTURN ALLEY AT NIGHT?!”
He leaves the office, closing the door behind him, and Potter’s there, leaning against the wall and fiddling with his wand.
Draco’d rather Sprout not find out, but odds are she already did, and, if he’s quite honest, he doesn’t want to walk back alone either. The talk Snape was having with Malfoy freaked him out more than he cares to admit.
“You’re supposed to
“Yeah.” Blaise says. He shakes his head and grabs his own bag. “The professors sent me your school work.”
“What’s wrong?” he asks immediately, grabbing Draco’s face to make sure everything’s alright. He’s grinning wildly though, grey eyes shining, and Harry relaxes a bit.
That’s – that’s –
Scorpius has been told he looks exactly like his dad; with the white-blonde hair and the fair skin, all he really has from his father is the green eyes, which everyone in the wizarding world recognizes as soon as they see him.
He doesn’t feel all-powerful.
“It wasn’t supposed to be like this,” Mrs. Thomas laments, looking over Dolohov’s sleeping body. “You weren’t supposed to be here. It was only supposed to be me and him.”
“That’s – that’s a lie.” Draco says,
called me and told me about the situation. I want to help.”
He passes Harry a steaming mug, and climbs onto bed beside him. Harry maneuvers his legs onto the bed again, and Draco closes the drapes with a charm.
“Ready?” He asks. Hermione nods, and uses magic to pour the venom over the cup.
“I think so.” He says. “But I don’t know who left it.”
. Harry probably won’t even notice what Draco wears.
McGonagall nods. “Whoever it is, someone must’ve noticed something. We need to ask around. In the meanwhile,” she turns to Sprout and frowns. “Your students are particularly good at finding hidden things, are they not?”
“There’s no point in the two of us dying,” Harry tells him. “We knew this could be the end, love. The horcrux-”
“We need to talk about this.” Harry says.
“From a death eater!” Bill says.
“Leave,” Snape hisses dangerously. Harry doesn’t listen.
He looks uncomfortably at Mrs. Thomas, sitting beside him drinking tea.
, he thinks, and the hat laughs quietly.
“Are we even then?” Fletcher asks nervously as they walk away. “You won’t speak to Greyback?”
And Theodore Nott.
“It’ll cause panic.” Snape is saying. Draco can’t see him, but he doesn’t really need to see much as long as he can hear them.
“No!” He says immediately. Everyone looks at him, and his face goes even redder. “I mean, no, we’re not sleeping together! We’re just sleeping together!”
“Couldn’t you just say yes?” She laughs.
“I know, love,” Harry tells him. He looks at Dolohov lying on the bed, and then back at Draco. “We caught him.”
In the train, Draco falls asleep curled up in Harry’s lap, and he doesn’t wake until they arrive.
Harry admits that he’s probably been too caught up in Draco and not focusing enough on what’s been going on around him, but he can’t help himself. Draco’s irresistible, with his soft hair, softer lips, his terribly biteable neck and his exquisite arse…
“Have you?” Harry asks.
“How dare you?” She snaps. “Not telling us about this? Not telling us about
that he’s getting so angry while Malfoy merely looks at him calmly.
“Well I didn’t,” Draco snaps.
