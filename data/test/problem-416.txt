The whole group broke into good-natured laughter at the clear embarrassment of the floundering BraveHeart.
“If you can make a fictional character appear, then maybe also a way out. Get to it!” He squeezed his eyes shut, apparently wishing hard for an avenue of escape.
Put off his stride by the discovery of his dead schoolmates, Draco had lost valuable seconds and now the vanguard had reached him.
Draco frowned. That was just plain mean. What the fudge had those men been thinking? Simply because she...? His frown deepened. What was
“Only if you're fortune,” Harry tried to joke, but his emotions were raw and his laugh half-hearted.
Within all this admittedly insane conversation, this was the part that irked Harry most and he didn't even fully realise that his free hand had fisted Malfoy's cloak as he exclaimed, voice shaking:
Ember's arms were empty. Blinking rapidly, he folded them in front of his chest and took a step back with a bleak expression.
Mabel swayed to the left and since he had been preoccupied, Draco only registered at the last instance that they were entering the light cloud.
“Perfect,” Malfoy drawled sarcastically and tried to make as little as possible of their bodies touch when he leant against the handrail, only to draw back immediately with a shriek when the wooden structure gave an alarming creak. Both boys held their breaths as they waited, but nothing happened.
Granger smiled faintly. She had understood that Draco's order was in Kreacher's best interest. After all, the elf would hardly be lonely in Hogwarts.
It was Tuesday, the fourth of May, barely five minutes after curfew, and Harry was once again in trouble.
“It's alright, Potter. You weren't wrong with what you said about me.” Seeing Potter so hurt, Draco was in a generous mood.
“The sky above The Hunt is only freely visible when neither of its leaders are present.” Seeker heard a woman dressed in a nun's habit say, addressing a mixed group to his right. “Now, who wants to learn about constellations?”
Meanwhile Harry was trying to get comfortable with the prospect of spending the night here and did his best to ignore the ever-mounting ache that the trick stair's pressure caused on his ankles. Blasted thing. If only he knew a spell to get out of this mess.
Malfoy started walking again, his pace picking up to an angry strut. “You know what, Potter, you can be a Muggle- and elf- and
“Alright then.” Harry clambered up the chess board and took the white queen's place. Once out, Madam Pomfrey would get him back to his right size.
Ever since unearthing the way to free Potter, Draco had redoubled his efforts of pinpointing the location of The Hunt. Yet while travelling around and following every tiniest hint, the days stretched into weeks and Draco found himself sans verified Hunt hideout on the last day of July.
'Although', a quiet voice in the back of Draco's mind whispered, 'there is a weirdly perfect Invisibility Cloak hanging in your wardrobe...'
“King's Cross,” Harry repeated pensively. “Is that why this Hallow looks like a blank train ticket?”
He was distracted by a renewed tapping, this time on his hand. The spectacle-wearer looked down to find a snowy owl hooting softly while sitting next to him on the equally snowy ground. Amber eyes blinked at him and he had the inexplicable feeling that he had seen this bird before.
A heart? Draco goggled the atrocity for a full thirty seconds before vanishing all of it, blushing violently.
“The thing is,” panted Wolfe, holding her stomach, “that only Sunday Children can hear the bells of Holle's Pond.”
Immediately, they were thrown into pitch-black darkness, which was even worse due to the fact that Draco was somewhat floating, in unknown water.
When they'd told him and Hermione, Ronald had slapped both hands to his cheeks, imitating Edvard Munch's
The little girl gurgled, stretched and blinked her eyes open. A silvery laugh rang from her lips when she reached with her tiny hands for her father who promptly burst into tears.
“Hands off, Potter! Think only because you're everyone's Golden Boy, you can touch me however you like now? Fat chance.” Draco forcefully pulled his arm free from the other's grip.
Malfoy crossed his arms in front of his chest and looked down his nose at Harry as if he thought him to be the world's biggest imbecile (which was probably not far off in Malfoy's opinion). “Because
Potter's gaze bore into Draco. “I was there, invisible due to Hunt magic.” The air was electric with the intensity of implication. “But I heard every word you said.”
There were a lot of 'whats' that Draco could think of in that sentence. Starting from the fact that he didn't like to be ordered around. Mostly though: “How do you know about the old  Black house at Grimmauld Place, Granger?”  And where had he recently heard this name before, Draco wondered.
Warrington made a strangled noise, but Hermione ignored him when she went for the finishing blow: “So, all that means that we can't trust you, unless we have a safeguard in place. Which brings us back to this parchment – if you want to be let in on what's going on with Malfoy, you'll have to sign; not negotiable.”
BraveHeart stared open-mouthed at Harry. “Amazing! That was like so cool! Did you just make that up on the spot, Seeker?”
and he had spend months looking for any clues, so that he could bring back the missing baby! Even though the solution had been under his nose all this time! Shit shit shit.
. Something about the wording had tucked at Harry's memories. “Hermione said a bit about this earlier, but... care to elaborate?”
Pansy grinned and strangely, so did Granger. The know-it-all winked at her. “Okay, but make it quick, Ron.”
“A place where old and/or crazy house-elves get sent. Or so the saying goes,” Pansy elaborated. “It's real then, the Mell?”
“Don't get ahead of yourself.” The former Slytherin had already started marching down to the lakeside and Harry quickly followed.
Draco would not stand here and let himself get insulted just so Potter could feel better on what was clearly an off-day for the Glasses.
“Hello, Snowdrop, you're my only real friend here,” Seeker said in a lamenting tone, purposely ignoring the still giggling other players.
“It will be quick.” Harry dismissed the yelling with a wave of his hand. “They can't hold me this time. I know it. I'll be back in half an hour – with baby Dreamer. That's what we dubbed her.” The coincidence with Dreamer was still weird to him, but then maybe not: After all, Draco had heard about her while hunting Harry... He shook the thought and made for the door.
Draco sighed inaudibly, as much as he was looking forward to most of these meetings, he rather wished that he could simply spend the holidays with Harry curled up in bed. Being social was so exhausting at times. And then there was this other thing... he shifted nervously in his seat.
Draco felt dizzy. The dark walled dungeon of a courtroom was full of chatter and movement. Members of the newly reassembled Wizengamot made their way towards the door, not paying any attention to the Malfoy family who had been up until just now accused war criminals. Yet the verdict was said, the trial was done, there was a sense of relief in the air.
“Sure.” Draco shrugged nonchalantly. Like he would tell Potter that this was the single most brilliant idea in the universe.
...after all, Draco would have to pack his things and move out of Grimmauld Place tomorrow (or today, as it was way after midnight by now).
Harry nodded faintly and saw the others do the same. His gaze stopped on Ember who was still on foot and now that Harry thought about it, he realised that there was no horse left. “What about Ember?”
All at once, Harry felt really tired. How the heck did they arrive at these kinds of topics? The stairs pressed into his back and his ankles hurt like hell and Malfoy was heavy, but also  warm and surprisingly soft for such a pointy git. He leant his cheek on top of the blond strands and closed his eyes. “Explain to me, how we ended up talking about the harsh bits?”
“Yeah, but he got it worse,” Half added solemnly. “After all, if he ever dismounted without Perchta, he would turn to dust when his feet touched the ground. He's cursed in a way, you know.”
“Oh, he sure was. Until he wasn't, that is. Actually, you two can just imagine an invisible third party following you around all last year. That would sum it up nicely,” retorted Draco with a sneer.
Seeing Potter back there, even for a second, had touched a chord inside Draco that had since not stopped singing him sweet-sad melodies. Like sirens, wonderful and deathly. Also, very confusing.
I stuck to the original for this one. If it's 'The' Battle of Hogwarts but 'the' Great Hall, don't blame me.
He paused for Colin in the second line, reaching out to trace the memento he had left here the other day: a postcard from Sweden in which Dennis had invited Harry to come and spend the holidays at the Creeveys' summer house in Scania.
Sighing long-sufferingly, Draco had accepted this. “You're planning on taking him again, isn't that right?”
Surprisingly, instead of nodding and walking away, Longbottom turned to face his grandmother with a stern expression. “Gran, please stop being rude. We've been over this. Malfoy and I are doing repairs together at Hogwarts. He's a fellow Patcher. He's a good comrade and I would appreciate it, if you would trust my judgement on this matter.”
The green-eyed boy turned to look at Draco over his shoulder, his face veiled in abysmal sadness. The breeze picked up his fringe and momentarily, a lightning-shaped scar was visible.
“The dogs are honking!” hissed Wolfe as if that was all the explanation anyone would need. Well, not Harry.
“Explain to me why you are seemingly friends with house-elves?” Pansy made a move to grab the notebook and Granger held it out of her reach, gaze on the letters.
There was no answer of course and Harry turned away with a heavy heart, bracing himself for the onslaught of memories. Yes, here he had sat for Dumbledore's funeral, thinking that his death was the worst loss. And now? Now, fifty of his schoolmates were remembered here. Fifty lives he hadn't been able to save.
Shit, shit, shit. Risking a glance over his shoulder, Harry saw that Malfoy was still in hot pursuit.
Seeker, who could hardly believe his luck, stumbled after Anguis as they made their way towards the more populated park areas.
“That's probably because we are in the cave area at the moment. Did you know? Half of Hogwarts is built on top of a huge cave, so the lake spans under big parts of the castle. We made sure no champion came close here during the task last year though. It can be a bit dangerous,” replied the merwoman in her croaky voice.
Despite having been unsure if Draco had really meant what he'd said in the park, Harry had had reason to hope: by Draco's bashful blushing and his body language overall during their talk in the living room. But only when they had kissed, had Harry known for sure: by the way Draco had devoured him. No matter what ridiculousnesses had come out of Draco's mouth later – their feelings were mutual. And once Harry had realised that, it had come easy to say the words 'I like you'.
It took the rest of the day to plant all the new trees and by the time they were done, they both felt like they could fall asleep while standing.
you know how I...” He swallowed and cleared his throat. “What I said in the park, about er, thinking of you, I didn't mean it. That is, you misunderstood.”
“Maybe not, but this was.” Potter's light tone changed to a serious note. “Can we please just talk about this?”
There had been a big official party in the Great Hall – and another unofficial one down at the Quidditch pitch in form of a Patchers match with Draco and Harry pitted against each other as Seekers of the opposing teams. It had been an epic game and even though Harry's team won by a smidge, he'd made it up to Draco during their own little, very exclusive after-party in their bedroom later.
“But life in The Hunt is fun, we like it here,” added Half. “When we first arrived we were exactly like you, lost, confused and angry, but we were told what we passed on to you just now and we settled in. This is our new home, our new family.” He tenderly looked at the others and finally at Harry. “And you are part of this now, of us.”
Teddy Lupin was standing near the edge of a wooded area and Harry noticed with a surge of fondness that the old man's hair was Draco's blond; the blond Draco's hair had been when they'd been young, so many decades ago. The rare gift of being a Metamorphmagus still worked for Teddy even at his ripe age and he'd recently passed it down to his second grand-daughter.
Queen Harry leered. “Yes, if you like. Right here on the table? But maybe we'll get rid of the audience first.” And suddenly his crown rather looked like thorns and his smile had a dangerous touch.
“Yes, that's right.” Harry corrected their course, pulling Draco with him. “I know, I was sceptical at first, too. But really, you already saw this one is different from all other cloaks: It remained. Even after The Hunt had taken me, the Invisibility Cloak stayed in the wardrobe although all my other stuff had vanished with me. Why is that, I ask you? Easy. Because the cloak has Death's magic in it.”
was cruel till the end and he wasn't all that smart and he had a horrid sense of humour... Still, I knew him since we were little kids. And I, I wasn't the good friend he should have had: If I had helped him instead of feeling superior, if I had made him understand that... that...” he choked, brushing vigorously a single tear from his cheek. “The point is: That Vincent lies here is my fault, not yours.”
” Malfoy hid his hand with Harry in it behind his back, but the suction didn't let off and Harry was outright screaming now, unable to form any other thought than 'pain'.
“I suppose we'll try to transfigure the table into a broom?” Malfoy rolled up his sleeves. “Better I do it. You're pants at Transfiguration.”
Granger took a deep breath and went on with the lecture: “However, there are several apparitions people think are, or confuse with, ghosts. The most common are
“It's not a big deal, really,” Potter grinned and gestured at the open wardrobe, “and it's nice to have a wider selection.” He tugged at the shirt he'd just put on. “Thanks for this.”
Harry thought that Wolfe could have been pretty if it hadn't been for the half-circle of angry red teeth marks covering her right cheek from brow to jaw and the thick, ropey scars covering her bare arm, collarbone to elbow.
Draco made his best effort not to look scandalised. Seriously those Weasleys were worse blood traitors than he'd ever– no, he cut himself off halfway. He mustn't think of the freckled lot as blood traitors anymore. He swore to himself to leave those bigoted ways behind him. But still, how could anyone not have a private library? Pft, heathens.
How much things had changed during this year Harry had been away... Yes, riding with The Hunt had had its perks and ultimately it had gotten him Draco, but… Just how many little moments were lost for Harry, here, with his friends in the real world. He clenched his fist, fighting down an upcoming wave of sadness. A year was so long. How much he'd missed...
“The Wild Hunt! Like, from the old nursery rhyme? We were outside fixing that southern wall and then there was a storm and, and, they were suddenly just there. Headmistress, they took him!” As windswept and out of breath as Draco was, he didn't much care about his lack of eloquence at the moment. How could McGonagall just sit there and calmly sip tea when Potter was missing?
“Do you think he'll come back with me once I find him?” Draco mused thoughtfully, voicing another thing he had never dared to face before. “What if he wants to stay with The Hunt? For all I found out they are a rather free bunch. Maybe he likes that... He... he's a good guy. That makes it hard on him sometimes. He forgives everyone eventually, even me. But not himself, I think. Even though he didn't do anything wrong, really. But sometimes I wonder if it could be that The Hunt took him because he wanted to be taken, as punishment or something.”
as they called themselves). Those were people who came to repair things that had been damaged in The Battle. But he hadn't been the only one. Lots of folk had come to help. Mostly current and former students and parents, but also others. Everyone had worked together to make Hogwarts inhabitable again so that the school could open its doors in September. And with united strength they had managed somehow — only barely though, for Hogwarts' innermost resilience against outward influences was formidable.
“Yeah, yeah.” Harry rolled his eyes and shoved at the annoyer. “But I didn't sign up for cuddling so stop leaning on me and sit on the edge of my knees.”
“Oi!” the mocked weasel bristled. “I might not be a stellar book nerd but I had enough experience with investigations of all sorts to be helpful. I have you know, Parkinson, that I can name all locations of all sections in here by heart. Can you say the same for yourself?”
Nothing happened, except for Malfoy flinching and then glaring at Harry. “What the heck are you playing at, Potter? Do you really think now's the best time to rub in the fact that you
Well... if Potter had survived it... and Draco really was so tired. With desperate courage he pushed a shred of the Heal-All Oyster in his mouth and tried hard to justify this to himself.
Coming back here, where their adventurous night had started eight hours ago, had been an unanimous decision. They both needed a moment to settle and sort through their thoughts.
“The others?” Draco asked bewildered, which earnt him furious twin stares by the girls. He ducked. What the bloody hell was happening?
“Because she did not die unborn?” duh-d Half, hair sticking up in wild angles. “Because she's still alive?”
“Speaking of telling: What was that nonsense about calling people by their surname when you're not close enough? Just between us, Crabbe and Goyle are your best friends. Would be majorly weird if that was 'not close enough'.”
Potter's face darkened. “Yeah, I mean, no, I mean, sort of. It's complicated. But I didn't know who you were then.” His gaze bore into Draco and the latter became once again acutely aware of just
So, they sat down, chatted and had biscuits. Even Myrtle joined in, after they had invited her into the conversation, when before she had been sulking in a corner for not having been asked.
Harry suddenly felt rather teary-eyed himself, but a quick scan of the group told him that he wasn't the only one.
Pressing the hot cup against his forehead, Harry let the heat distract him from the aching in his chest.
“And so are you: fourth cousins once removed! Molly told me.” She was positively squealing now, which was somehow infective and soon all three of them were out of breath from laughing. It felt nice.
Thankfully, Headmistress McGonagall had found a way to have Harry's painted self permanently under a sleeping spell after Rita Skeeter had tried to pry information from him during the re-opening celebrations. This way, the blabbermouth painting couldn't give away private details to just anyone and only a select few knew the 'password' to wake up Portrait-Harry.
He sat down at the table, Crookshanks jumping onto his lap with an often-practised routine from Wednesday dinners. Draco had somehow become a cat person. Huh.
Scoffer whimpered and squirmed, rolling into a ball and then growing bigger and bigger, until he was no longer a dog, but a young man with flaxen hair, kneeling on the frozen ground.
! Draco, don't go! My name! Say my name!” Seeker pounded the division with his fists. “Please, take me with you!”
Draco's eyes slid shut and he nudged closer, entangling their bodies fully. “I believe that's my line, Mr. Super-Famous-Chosen-One-Saviour-Hero.” He chuckled quietly. “It's sweet you would say that though. So just for the record: I'm all yours. Now, let's sleep, yeah?”
Since the chatterbox wasn't all that strong, Harry had a few moments to survey him: He had fair skin, mouse-brown hair and equally brown eyes shining from behind a hand-painted mask that covered the upper half of his face and showed a breathtaking landscape.
!” Harry laughed with surprise and squinted up at the night raven. “You knew who I was and that I was master of Death, didn't you?”
Harry hadn't lied: He really didn't care what people would say about this surprising union (especially not the press; he could handle them, maybe give them a nice headline: 'love is love' or something). The ones that actually counted already approved by having supported Draco in his endeavours. (Though it was beyond weird to see Ron and Hermione so cosy with the former Slytherin.)
He was still panting and out of breath when looking down and finding that both his feet had sunk up to the ankles into a trick stair. Typical.
Draco had reached the Entrance Hall and made a face; Patchers weren't supposed to use the official entries, especially not after curfew. Oh, well. Just this once.
The doors slid shut in Draco's face and he was left without the opportunity to answer. What was it with former Gryffindors and their spontaneous invitations? Well, if he was going to the Weasleys' anyway, he could probably stop by the castle later.
The horse showed interest in Harry's new laurels and he had to bend his neck a bit to get out of reach, but the palomino was quicker and snatched a leaf from the crown. “Hey, stop it! Geez, you're fast as lightning. Oh, that's what we're going to call you, boy – Lightning!” Lightning didn't acknowledge his new name at all and continued to try and fish leaves from Harry's head with his horse tongue.
Harry heard his heart beat, slow and steady. His panic had subsided and left him with goosebumps and a vague feeling of awe. A life had ended in these seconds. Another one had been created. How breathtaking the world was, how cruel, how wonderful.
“That won't help you!” screeched Queen Harry and made a move to climb over the table. At last the pull at Harry's middle subsided and he could breathe again. “You are mine and I am yours! That's what you wished for! I'll make you happy!”
Partying wildly with their dead friends at The Hunt had made way for partying wildly with their living friends and there had been a lot of eating, drinking, games, singing, dancing and laughing. A perfect start into a new, promising year.
The gang exploded in laughter and approving clapping, even though Harry tried half-heartedly to quiet them down and tell them that under no circumstances would he be called
thinking it felt strange that you wanted to go together to the Black library. When three people going to three different libraries at the same time is so much more efficient. And don't tell me you needed me to carry books or some-such, you're a rather capable witch after all.” He crossed his arms over his chest and glared at the bushy-haired girl in front of him who had the decency to look guilty.
Pansy Parkinson, wearing a pink neckerchief and a stormy expression on her pug face, came at Draco at top speed and slapped him hard. Her eyes emitted sparks as she drew up to her full height: “You deserved that.”
Harry smiled ruefully. “Right, you would know.” Then his expression softened. “He went to our parents' gravesite with me this Halloween.”
Seeker watched them idly. Today's team was a wild mix of humans of all shades and a handful of moss folk. Those were still odd to him.
“That's the idea,” Granger answered. “After all, it wouldn't be the first secret chamber a founder has left in the castle, right
Draco was clinging to the words barely audible over the ringing in his ears and after a while, when he came down from his tremor, he realised that words hadn't been the only thing he had clung to: His hands were grasping tightly to one arm of Granger and the Weasel each, who were awkwardly spooning him from both sides.
Both a bit breathless and a lot dishevelled, they lay there, shoulder to shoulder, facing each other.
Weasley ogled Draco and the wand with wonder. “This Poser really did all that? He sounds majorly cool, even with you describing him!”
“Oh, I'll show her all the respect in the world if she doesn't show me anything at all,” Half laughed and ducked away as his girlfriend started hitting him lightly.
“Sorry for the, er, inconvenience, mate,” Ronald grinned, nicking Draco's cup. “Just a tiny domestic.”
The redhead had produced a couple of mismatched goblets from somewhere and now filled them with water, throwing in weird looking leaves.
“Ten hours the first day.” Mabel had started swimming again and Draco followed clumsily. “Nine the next, and so on.”
“Finished off the Dark Lord?” Parrot number three. “No, that can't be right. I was a witness when that happened and it was not this... Puttel... you mentioned.”
Wolfe rolled her eyes. “Yes, that is what I meant. But call me your 'duck' again and I'll throw you into Holle's Pond.”
“Ah, that?” Mabel pointed one of her long, webbed fingers at her nape. “That's my 'heart', sort of. It's difficult to explain. Anyway, we wear it on the backlace, to be our guiding light in dark times. Until we need it for something else, that is.”
He put Harry back onto his head. “I hate you so much for getting us here,” Malfoy spat and made a dash for the trapdoor.
“I don't think so,” was the unperturbed reply. “We will find you a better name in no time. But you may call me Holle today.”
The corners of his eyes were burning. It was bad enough to be stabbed with words like that, but even worse that it was Potter. Draco had thought they would get along now. He had thought they were good. But that Potter still thought of Draco like that... Death Eater... Bloody Merlin, get a grip, Draco, crying won't bloody help.
These days, when he looked into the mirror and saw the flashy accessory, he willed himself to remember the bits he normally omitted: biting his nails during Potter's turn in the first task of the Triwizard Tournament, secretly betting on Potter during the second task and tearing up from relieved anxiety after the third task. It wasn't that Draco had wanted Diggory dead, but what if Potter had died instead...? Not that the idiot hadn't tried to get himself killed
“Malfoy!” Harry nudged the other boy which caused them both to weirdly rotate like little ships bobbing on the surface of the ocean. “Stop screaming!”
When finally all four of them sat around the table again, steaming beverages in front of each, they picked up the conversation anew.
They were not paying him any attention. Instead they did weird postures while holding an arm up high, grinning at it like lunatics.
Her friend looked up, just as bewildered. “Huh?” He gazed around. “Didn't I just go in there?” Ron nodded at the portal.
“Ahem.” Lucius cleared his throat, effectively silencing all onlookers. “Mr. Potter, I would like to offer gratitude for you graciously lending your hand to–"
tried to take him for the audacity of looking at The Hunt unabashed. We could have. It was in our right. But we knew you,” he nodded at Harry, “wouldn't approve of it and also we wanted him to eventually free you. So, essentially, Draco was always safe from us.”
“Hermio–!” The redhead's complaint was cut off when they Disapparated, leaving a roaring silence in the living room.
of your scar is my mark. It showed from the beginning that you were chosen to be master of me eventually.”
“Yes, that's right,” Ron continued gleefully and shot a proud look at Hermione. “She betrayed Dumbledore's Army and we used the same jinx on her. Not much of a beauty these days, is she? That
There were nods all around. Seeker, the newbie wearing Perchta's crown, had proven to have a knack for this sort of thing and no one questioned his leadership skills anymore.
Those they had taken during their spring walks in the countryside, when they'd picked up Draco's old hobby of hiking cross-country.
Grinning, Harry picked up a squeaking, caught off-guard Draco and pushed the bedroom door open. “Mhm, are you now? Care to elaborate?”
“She would have drowned if I hadn't secretly grown Gillyweed for her, to try breathing underwater with me. It was pure coincidence I had brought it with me that night.”
The ginger threw his head back and laughed heartily. “I knew I liked you. Hey, gang, look who I found! It's our good friend–" Here he looked at Harry expectantly.
Flying nip and tuck with Half now, Seeker goaded Lightning to be faster. Just a bit more, just a bit– YES! Seeker rushed first through the doors inside the building, uttering a whoop of joy.
Potter laughed silently and there was something unidentifiable glinting in his eyes. “It's true. You probably thought they fulfil my every wish but the sad truth is, they treat me like rubbish. Just because I am a wizard, they never even gave me a proper birthday present – even yours was better. Thanks by the way.” He waved the handkerchief. “No, before I came here I didn't have fitting clothes or a room or friends. Oh, but this has nothing to do with them being Muggles, not really. They are just bigots – a bit like you. Ha, don't you think it's ironic? I believe my cousin Dudley and you could have been best mates when we were younger; at least you shared a hobby: Harry-bashing. Well, he's nicer now... a bit like you.”
Lacie tilted her head then nodded and addressed Malfoy: “It will get its dolly back if it sings us a song. We love songs.”
“Er, so,” Harry shook his head bewildered and tried to pick up the thread of the conversation, “he's a red queen?”
Indeed had he secretly sent out small rations of self-brewed potions to his friends. He hadn't wanted to hear their pure-blood talk, but he also had known they were in need of some nightmare-less nights, same as everybody these days. Also, a few minutes of fluff were useful every now and then and Weasley had generously gifted Draco with a few Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes' products.
That's why you waited for Warrington here till he was done being healed, isn't that right? So you wouldn't have to walk on your own and risk getting caught alone after hours.” Hermione smirked triumphantly. How she loved to be the smartest person in a conversation. “And
his teapot (pot, Potter, check) from the windowsill to place it on the bedside table. See if a little piece of mind magic would defeat a Malfoy. Ha! He'd show those stupid memories.
“Okay,” Draco conceded bewildered. “So, you are saying that you like me – even though I'm a quote unquote asshole and I have
Hermione felt pity. With all her blatant faults, Parkinson was obviously worried about her (boy?)friend right now and it wasn't fair to leave her in the dark. Especially, when Ron and Hermione themselves were still mostly unsure as to what had occurred
The list went on and on before Draco's eyelids drooped and he finally fell asleep – thoughts of Potter filling his head.
With a creak, the wandmaker got up and was once again way too close for comfort. “I have to say, I don't particularly like you. I will not forget so easily what happened at your house.” His uncomfortably big eyes bore into Draco's. “But lately I've heard good things about you – turning the Manor into a library was a smart idea. So, I wish you luck in finding Presley and... Merry Christmas.”
“That is... really sad. I'm sorry for your loss, truly. But if you don't mind me asking, how do you know it was The Hunt that snatched your daughter's soul?” Draco bit his lip. He was starting to worry that this was another dead end or worse completely unrelated to Potter's case at all.
Harry was very much not pants at Transfiguration. But why should he argue with Malfoy about this when the latter was offering to do all the work?
Then he ran a shaking hand through his hair as he distractedly rummaged in his wardrobe for pyjamas. Too many thoughts at once ran through his mind and he found himself thinking in circles: He had gotten Potter back from The Hunt, which was good. He had been living in Potter's house for the last year, which was weird. Potter had heard Draco's monologue in the park, which was bad. But he had gotten Potter back from The Hunt, which was good. And he...
Seeker had long gotten used to the perennial white and also to the fact that Hunt magic kept them warm  – and that living with Half meant being hit with the icy substance every other day.
“Interesting.” Half leant onto Harry's shoulder, watching the brothers-in-law laugh and cry at the same time. “What just happened?”
“Aha!” cried Harry suddenly triumphantly and indicated ahead. Then, belatedly realising that Malfoy couldn't see him pointing, Harry added: “There's a door. To the right.”
Ice-cold fear doused Harry. 'Met before' sounded really, really bad. He stared at Draco, who in turn looked confused. “How so?”
Minutes ticked by during which only Malfoy's increasingly laboured breath and occasional whimpers were heard.
Draco gave up. “Only you have this effect on me.” He pushed himself up and caught Harry's lips for a second, before pulling away which earned him an annoyed groan from the other boy.
Therefore today, a shoutout to all beta readers out there who spend their valuable time, patience and insight to help the writers: Thank you for your hard work. You rock!
The nice weather had attracted hordes of visitors and the park was packed with people. Draco studied a map and then ambled along the Long Walk, a pedestrian road that led like an axis through the middle of the park.
Ronald turned his envelope over in his hands. “Wow, you wrote us Christmas letters. Thanks, Ferret.” He sounded less than impressed.
“That means,” Draco concluded slowly, “that Harry can't die unless he himself chooses it? Then however he has to replace you?”
With that in mind, Draco had not only eaten humble pie in front of all the wizarding families he could imagine to have a private library, to grant him entrance (not many responded, but he was still on it) but also expanded his search into the unknown –  the world of public Muggle libraries.
That was right. Crabbe's cross was the barest – no flowers, no pictures, no nothing. Except for  the small bird bath.
). In like to think those are their real names, but centuries of human mispronounciation turned them into Mabel and Ada.
Illuminated by the dim light of round, greenish lamps hanging on chains from the ceiling and a dying fire under an elaborately carved mantelpiece, Harry made out Malfoy standing at the far right side, giving off an annoyed vibe.
At some point, Peeves appeared and tried to bust the party, which was thwarted by the assembled revellers. Draco remarked that actually, it was only the collected frustration of the younger students staying at Hogwarts over Christmas. As they couldn't partake, it made the poltergeist go crazy, since Peeves was all their bad feelings combined. The group ogled Draco at that and then clinked glasses 'to fun trivia'.
To my wonderful beta umbrellaless22 who found time in their super-busy schedule to read this beast of a chapter and give me valuable advice. Your soul is pulchritudinous.
“Right, we'll figure that out later. But what about the witnesses?” Granger thumped through a thick tome until she found the right passage. “
“That's not going to be easy, finding a way back,” Half sobered after a while. “I've never heard of anyone who left The Hunt. Besides, where would you go if you don't remember where you came from?”
“That's a bit crazy.” Harry had given up on the bread. It felt like he'd sooner break off a tooth than some of the crust.
But his clever schoolmate had thought outside the box. Figures, Nott (maybe Draco should start calling him Theodore now?) had always been the smartest of their bunch.
He turned to leave the memorial site, when a sudden movement in the fifth line made him jump, wand at ready.
finish this? As clearly a morally corrupt person like me should not handle young ones; I could contaminate the saplings.” Draco was seething now. He put the tree down. Time to retreat.
Draco pressed his hands onto his ears. What was happening? He turned around just in time to see a procession of the weirdest kind, illuminated by a flash of lightning: Seemingly floating through the air, dozens and dozens of people of all ages – many on horseback, many afoot, some dressed in strange costumes, some almost naked –, accompanied by flocks of dogs, pigs, seafowl and owls, that were following in a long, winding line after a single tall rider on a white horse, were sharply contrasted against the momentarily lit night sky.
Draco sighed and looked at the ceiling. There were stars now where there hadn’t been before. “It's called hero worship or transference – or so I read recently in an article about an obsessed fan of the Minister's. You transfer romantic feelings onto a person who has saved you from great peril. I guess you are especially susceptible because normally
“Maybe,” Half said dryly, raising an eyebrow, “you would like to ask Seeker first if he would be so kind as to take us along?”
If there'd been a wall nearby, Draco would have banged his head against it. Since there wasn't, he made do with spitting as acidly as he could: “Keep your hallucinations to yourself, Potter! You're delirious if you think I'll deign that with an answer.”
Harry snorted as Death gave Draco a disbelieving stare on account of the latter's brashness. “You are very cheeky.”
Harry headbutted right back and for a few seconds they were silently grappling back and forth. Then Harry leant back and somewhat out of reach, catching his breath. It was true, they mostly just bickered. The last real conversation between them that Harry remembered had been during their detention in the Forbidden Forest in first year when Malfoy had told him all about his favourite Quidditch team.
“Oh, darling, I'm right here,” cooed Queen Harry and wasted no time putting his arms around Malfoy's neck. The nerve of him! Harry fumed. Like he'd
Draco made a funny squeaking noise. “What's with the–? Why do you always–?” He stopped and sighed, then his face turned sober. “I love you, too, you big sap. Now, can we go and get this done so we can crawl back into bed and I can show you exactly
“Oi, Half, that's not fair! You cheater!” Wolfe scrambled into an upright position, taking pursue of the hollering boys tearing through the sky.
“It's not that! They started by themselves. Someone nearby is on their deathbed. We need to get there in time.” Half leapt onto Gee's back.
Draco could feel his cheeks heat up, but he resolutely kept staring at the page in front of him. “Right. Between a whole library, The Burrow, Hogwarts and, I don't know,
. There was no better word for it. In a way comparable to Holle's presence was Berchthold's the exact opposite in feeling. While Holle was exuberantly alive, Berchthold was oppressing like ringing silence. He was thunder and lightning and yet he was the eye of the storm, most deadly, most powerful. Harry felt the hairs on his arms standing upright. This man was doom laced with an unsettling amount of peace.
Malfoy suppressed a yawn. “Because we never actually talk and now's the opportunity. Not that it had any merit for
The big boy's mouth thinned into a tight line. “Yeah, I– okay then.” He swayed, trying to hit the dotted line. Yet he paused and looked at Draco, eyes wide. “You won' leave me again though, will you? You'll come visit? In that, in de-to-c-k-tion ward?”
His disgust must have shown on his face, as the abomination narrowed his (??) yellow eyes at Draco and whacked his wand aside. “Students are not allowed down here.”
“We're more nocturnal, really. I mean, we can be up during the day, but we prefer to be awake at night.” Mabel shrugged. “Force of habit. And look, there's Méala now.”
Before the former huntsman could say anything else, Draco had bolted up the stairs and bodily thrown himself at Harry.
Potter had turned away, looking over the lake, seemingly rattled by his own honesty. He cleared his throat. “Shall we give it another try?”
Deep in thought, he jumped as something warm and wet brushed his ear. “Lightning! Stop eating my wreath!” Harry pulled away to the loud amusement of his new acquaintances. He growled. “Everyone, this is Lightning the leaf thief. And,” a quick look around, “this is Snowdrop, my owl.”
whatever you want, like maybe Kitty? Meow!” He reached his hand across the table to playfully 'claw' at Malfoy which caused the latter to flinch away and Harry to scowl.
“If I parted with my feet, would I have to write them letters?” Alice mused, completely unfazed by the escalating argument. “Wouldn't that be funny? Imagine: Alice's Right Foot, Esq., Table, Helga's Tea Room, (with Alice's love).”
Tillie pouted. She pressed Harry closer to her heart. “Dolly!” Then suddenly her huge eyes shone with an idea and she directed her gaze at Malfoy. “Song?”
“Harm... I thought The Hunt is a funny group of dead beings continuously frolicking while chasing an unreachable goal?” Harry turned to Half, who felt somehow like the resident explainer of the gang.
“Yes, and?” Seeker shot back irritably. Of course he knew that the body of water was Holle's since a) her 'house', Spillalutsche's Stone, was standing right at the bank and b)
“He means Somewhen glow; it's around things or people riders have met before their death,” Harry elucidated quietly.
he could do him a favour by partaking in this nonsensical spectacle. Just to cheer him up. After all, without Potter's good relation to the merpeople, Draco would have been a giant squid snack by now.
He sighed. “Look, Draco, I admit I heartily despised you when we were younger and I can't even pinpoint exactly when that changed, but change it did. Maybe I was a bit slow on the uptake and didn't quite realise at first that it was, you know,
“'Very Important Family Friend',” the ginger translated, looking unconvinced of the content of this assertion. He pulled himself together though and added: “Ron says you are an okay bloke and you help out with the store for free and the library...” he trailed off.
Harry squinted down at the entrance he had just come through. “How did you know it was me? I can't see a thing from up here.”
Colourful leaves were falling when the gang spent an enjoyable afternoon in September with an artwork contest, during  which everyone needed to try building something out of nuts.
Or maybe it simply was the flag, really. After all, the skull-and-bones Jolly Roger of the opponent team always made Seeker shudder with a deep-seated aversion and when he had told his friends so, all but Ember had agreed. There was just something dark about that skull...
“It's alright, Half. As long as Draco remembers, all is well. I put my trust in him. He will come for me. He will find me.”
Draco was stumbling yet again, holding tighter to Harry's side and showing extraordinary amounts of bravery for a Slytherin, because only Harry could see the faint glow leading their way. For Draco it was like walking blind and it said
“How can you even look at me?” Harry whispered faintly, trying to brush Malfoy off. “After what I did to you in her bathroom back in sixth year.” They had never talked about that incident.
Harry played with Malfoy's bangs. “But let's say we had, under some weird circumstances. Wouldn't you speak with me if I were all Muggle?”
didn’t give Malfoy the right to be cheeky though and, grinning broadly, Harry purposefully tightened his grip while nuzzling Malfoy's hair which earnt him a satisfying and indignant squeak of “Potter!”.
“Easy, the room must be unplottable. You know, like the Room of Requirement where you busted Dumbledore's Army? You would have never found that place if not for Marietta's sneaking help,” Granger explained and Pansy irritatedly felt a hand gently nudging her around a corner.
His painted self looked thoughtful. “We never do that though. We never lean on others, not wholly. Sure, we ask for help, but in the end we are used to fending for ourselves. And yet...” he left the sentence unfinished hanging between the two Harrys.
Draco wrinkled his nose. Right. He had forgotten about the last of Potter just after talking to Ollivander and hadn't had time to tell the others about the new development in the 'remembering ability' department. Maybe not the best moment to bring that up though. After all, what the old wandmaker had insinuated, was nothing short of... Draco blushed hard and hid behind his teacup.
Alright then, but still: “Er, true. Though the Heal-All Oyster helped. But yeah, no, thanks. Anyway, how do you have treacle?”
“I know you.” It wasn't a question. The owl tipped its head to the other side and kept looking at him, its gaze intense and somewhat expectant. He tentatively lifted a hand and to pet the bird. “I know you.” Just from where, he couldn't say.
Seeker looked at the mask in his hands: It showed a lush, sun-flooded forest, not unlike their current surroundings.
“They agreed when I told them I would never set foot in the house again anyway and that it was for the whole of the wizarding community and also a good way to do penance.”
He, too, had something to hold on to, even though he wasn't quite sure what it meant to him. The handkerchief with the embroidered D wandered from one hand to the other. D. D like... like what? Why was it, his heart clenched when he looked at it and why–
Picking up the discussion, the twin said doubtfully: “If this Patty,” (“Potter.”) “is our friend like you said then why was he with
Malfoy didn't reply but merely sacked into Harry, leaning all his weight into his favourite rival, the blond head rolling to the side and coming to rest at Harry's collarbone. Face dark red and sweat-streaked, the Slytherin was gasping for air and still his whole body was one big quiver.
“Kreacher doesn't have to answer the M– girl. Kreacher only has to answer to the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black. Young Master Malfoy, how can Kreacher be of service?” He bowed again.
do that to me again! Hear me? Never again!” Draco spat into Harry's neck, hugging his middle so tightly that it hurt. Quieter he continued: “When I woke up alone just now I thought... I thought you were taken again, that I only dreamt you were back.” He tucked his chin onto Harry's shoulder, looking up at him. “Don't disappear on me like that. Don't leave my side.”
Draco couldn't recall a happier Christmas, especially when he, blushing, offered the whole company his last-minute, slightly burned biscuits instead of presents. He had, under Kreacher's stern tutelage, made them himself this morning and was rather proud of the outcome, considering that he had never baked before.
“I did,” Harry confirmed. “He called me, at the cliffs earlier, and I remembered my life. Sorry I couldn't say goodbye then, it went all very fast.”
! How often do I have to tell you?” Harry's annoyance suddenly turned to mischief, when he struck on an idea. “Oh, but, you know what? How about
The spectacle was grotesque and Harry would have laughed, but his emotions were still raw from the scene he had just witnessed and somewhere inside him, he felt sorry for the bereaved.
? The lake was first mentioned in official documents in the mid-18th century. It is known for its unusual saltiness although it is a freshwater lake. Everyone knows that.” Though he had to admit, the connection of the lake to other bodies of water had been news to him.
! I'm sorry for all the petty arguments and the tricks I played on you and, no, let's be honest, I'm
Every time in the last months when Draco had worked out on the grounds, the hippogriff had followed him around, hovering and seemingly making sure that Draco did nothing illegal.
“Right, almost forgot,” nodded Half, spinning his marshmallow over the fire. Harry got the distinct impression that the jokester was the group's leader. “We still have to pick a name for you, newbie.”
“To want something to hold on to? No, not weird at all.” Seeker reached for a drying, garishly coloured mask that had 'Half' written all over it. “I have been wondering though: Why
“Now, about Berchthold's curse, I made the Deathly Hallows to break it. Quite simple, really, all you have to do is–”
“It's house-elf magic, Malfoy,” he shouted over the distance of the room, as Tillie had just climbed the highest mountain of rubbish in the well.
“Good chaps." Cassius grinned at the squabblers. "Besides,” he pointed at the two owls in question, “I think they wouldn't be disinclined to fly together.”
On the other hand, it was the Hogwarts re-opening celebration and Malfoy had put in quite the work over the last few weeks, so maybe...
“You didn't though. They fought and died for their conviction, for the hope of better days – and better days they won for all of you. Which is why I allowed them to ride with us, it's their reward to live out their best death at The Hunt. Your friends are alright and you know that now. For that purpose we came to collect you, to help you heal and save you from yourself. Also, to give you back part of your ruined childhood, I guess. It's what I owed you, as my master.” His face grew solemn. “But it was also to honour you, after all you made the biggest possible offering to Life herself: You gave yourself as human sacrifice and that deserves our highest respect and our camaraderie forevermore.” He slightly bowed towards Harry, who felt the weirdest mix of feelings swirling inside.
“Well, good. Now that we figured out your name, how about you help me find mine? I seem to have misplaced it, along with pretty much any information about myself.” He burrowed one hand in his own unruly black hair and the other in Snowdrop's feathers. “Must've hit my head quite badly.”
What a complex work of tricky magic. Hermione felt the involuntary flutter of being intrigued by a problem that needed solving.
Noise. That was the first thing the young man registered, even before opening his eyes. He listened for a moment, trying to gather his thoughts. What had happened to him? Apparently he was lying on a cold, hard surface and was surrounded by people whose loud talking and singing was somewhat topsy-turvy.
“Oh, but they are,” Weasley said matter-of-factly. “We would have lost the war if they weren't. Now, I'm not sure exactly how they were related – must have had something to do with Princess – but they are definitely real. And Luna is not weirder than
“Really? I hadn't noticed,” said Draco dryly while making a show of eyeing the humongous Christmas decorations all along the windows they were passing by.
Stepping through, they found themselves inside a broad, round well, stuffed with battered furniture, and with walls leading so high up the ceiling couldn't be made out.
He had started avoiding big crowds. Even getting together with his old school friends was tense sometimes. In that case though, there were other factors in play as well.
Draco swallowed hard. He'd been standing outside for almost two full minutes now, not daring to knock. But he had to. For Potter.
Seeker knew by now that the doors had been left ajar on purpose, so that The Hunt could easily ride through if it wanted to, instead of destroying it while trying.
Slowly, as realisation dawned on Draco, he explained: “It's a stone that can bring back dead people. Or so is the legend. I surmise you want to try this theory?” He frowned. “But Hermione said that those ghosts summoned by the stone are really just part of the summoner's memory. I don't see how that's helpful.”
,” the old woman related while giving Myrtle a stern gaze, “that you two were 'being mean to girls at the Slytherin dorms'. Now, I can see, I was woken for nothing. Thank you, Myrtle.” The ghost girl blew out her cheeks. “But it's nice to see you two have become friends. Good work on the window.”
Seemingly confused about the effect of his simple observation, Ember turned to Harry: “If you're with him then that means you left The Hunt?”
“I'm really spared nothing, am I?” The bodiless voice, emitted from the shadows, out of the stands, made Harry jump in alarm. “Can't take your eyes off me, eh, Scarhead?” Malfoy's wand lit up, revealing his pale face seemingly floating mid-air. “Well, I
Harry shuddered involuntarily and leant into Draco's touch. “Like the Tale of the Three Brothers?” Holle flapped her wings. “Just how much of it is true?”
Hogwarts. Draco had been reluctant to come back here; but after the impromptu reorganisation of the green houses with Professor Sprout last week, there had been a spark of hope.
of all places? Don't you consider that I know you all hate me? I just– he... he needs saving! That's what you do, right? So, save him!”
“Indeed,” Pansy agreed and marched on, ignoring the excited whispers of her male companions, exchanging dog stories. Boys,
People went quiet to listen, but Harry's thoughts drifted off. There had been too many speeches lately, he was tired of them.
Since the afternoons in this first week of August were of the blazing hot kind of midsummer, he usually enjoyed the cool mornings. Today though, he shivered as a balmy breeze came in from the window, drying the cold sweat on his forehead. He quickly pulled a Weasley-made cardigan out of his antique wardrobe, fingers brushing his father's Invisibility Cloak, then headed for the stairs.
She said: "I wanted to express how Draco thoughtfully/hopefully thinks about the possible rescue of Harry, while talking to Anguis."
“Oh.” was all Potter said, when he entered the living room currently littered with Christmas wrapping paper and stacked dirty dishes. Draco had been too nervous to do much but pace the floor this last week. He certainly didn't have a mind for cleaning up.
He quickly grabbed what he came for and made a narrow escape out of the heap, pressing his trove to his chest. It was only when he stood with a bit of distance to the boisterous horde that he took a closer look at what had called him: it was a small brown teddy bear, worn from years of cuddling.
excited. That had been a good move since 'baby duty' had got Draco a free pass at both helping with tasks and receiving open hostilities.
There was a moment of silence during which they both readjusted and Harry let it slide that Malfoy bodily leant into him with a huff of the greatly suffering. As if
fear us. So, basically, they see what they will themselves to see – when they have angst in their hearts they perceive demons and are afraid we bring catastrophes, droughts, wars or diseases. So they offer sacrifices to soothe our presumed rage. But when they have hope then they welcome us as an omen of good fortune. In those cases they recognise us as what we really are: happy party people,” he smirked. “Which reminds me: How do horses greet each other? Hay man!”
“Yes, but I think it would be best if I went tonight to retrieve her.” Harry nodded at his own words. “I better go now.”
At that Harry snorted and pressed a kiss to Draco's knuckles. “Are you quite done thinking up these ridiculous excuses?”
“It's a Heal-All Oyster,” Mabel provided. “Just one bite is enough. Maybe it'll even re-size Harry here.”
“What the–? Stop it!” Half tried to shield his face but he had no chance against Seeker's seething rage.
Feeling a sudden surge of warmth, Harry got almost a bad conscience for saying the next words: “That is really generous of you all. But as I'm still alive, I think, I'd rather seek a way back to the world of the living.”
“I give you 'talk', you bastard!” Every sentence was accentuated by a hex. “Let's talk about scarred Bill! Or poisoned Ron! Or tortured Hermione! Or – or F-Fred... you, you assh–”
, why didn't you say so earlier?” Pansy stopped to cross her arms. “Why did we have to walk through half the castle for you to suggest that?”
The same moment, she found herself colliding once again with Ron's lanky body, crashing them both into the grandfather clock that showed six o'clock precisely. “Ouch!”
Neither Draco nor Potter batted an eyelash at that. Rather did they both get into position to repeat the spell as many times as necessary. They were used to it by now. Since Hogwarts was an ancient building and its own magic made the repair process take longer than anticipated, spells on the castle's matter often needed several repeats to stick.
Throwing all caution to the winds, Draco pressed on: “How long will that take? The Wild Hunt only appears during Yuletide.”
Between those calm, warm shots were a few loud, garish ones of George's birthday party. They seemed so happy, but to Draco, that day was a memory of silent dread.
Fortunately (or was it, really?) not many wanted to work with a former Death Eater and so he found the peace and redemption of patching the castle a rather solitary task. Pretty much exactly what he wanted.
She looked at Ron who arched an eyebrow, cast a quick glance at the Slytherins and then shrugged miniscule. That meant that he left the decision to her, trusting her to do the right thing. In that moment, Hermione's heart swelled from pride and warmth.
“Hermione!” Weasley cut in. Thank goodness. “You can S.P.E.W. later! Dobby, did you say 'down there'? So the Mell below us?”
“As I was saying, there is more than one type of ghost-like afterimages... although my other examples are extremely rare and I must admit my musings about them are mostly based on hear-say. First there is the unlikely event that a
“...maybe not all.” Death's voice turned glum. “I did not think about the fact that putting that much weight on young shoulders might break a child's back. I don’t normally care about the plight of the living, but… Towards you as my chosen master, I'm sorry.  ”
All of them were absorbed in their own thoughts, when their host walked them back to the front door.
“Would you cut it out?” Malfoy complained, while Harry unsuccessfully tried to manoeuvre himself out of his arm-chair – only that he attempted to leave on the right side and Malfoy on the left. “Maybe you've forgotten but we're
His thoughts were aimlessly wandering, when his head suddenly snapped up, confusion written on his face. Something had occurred to him.
“So, you're saying that this cloak I'm currently wearing is a Deathly Hallow and makes one invisible even to Death himself?”
Dutifully, Potter dabbed at his face and made a move to hand the soaked handkerchief back to Draco. “Ugh, no, keep it. As an early birthday gift.”
Harry'd seen it in the scrapbook before and been so utterly proud of Draco for reaching out to his aunt.
(fair/lovely) as in The Fair *** (her name is lost actually). She seems to have been a goddess of nature (or even Mother Nature herself, I did not include that version because I only found out after I was finished) and then Christianity asked for only one God and she had to disappear, but the people still wanted to pray to her. Saying her name was forbidden though, so they just called her The Fair
“Breathtaking – just like you,” Half purred, eyes glued to Wolfe's face with a love-struck expression.
Hermione had crossed the room and stood now behind the love seat leaning onto Potter's right shoulder, while Ronald perched on Potter's left side on the armrest.
“Absolutely not,” determined Merchieftainess Murcus. “You will wait here for Ada and she will guide you to a safe passage back into the castle. She knows all the entrances and exits best.”
“Back here?” Harry was struggling with what to make of this new strangeness while simultaneously trying to keep an eye on Ember descending from Lightning's back with the baby in one arm.
That was the exact moment, Howard decided to make his royal entrance as he jumped up to lie down between Potter's crossed legs.
Malfoy flicked annoyed at Harry's head in return and nearly got him, too. “Zip it! You have no clue whatsoever. Do you want to hear about the Mell or not?”
“Except you are wrong and there is one person that remembers me,” Seeker corrected, gnashing his teeth.
While this tremendously relieved Harry, Draco looked disappointed: “But then... I mean, if you helped along, then the strongest connection...?”
Harry thought on that for a moment. “Yeah, well, but that's not okay. The whole dynamic of it, I mean. It's not the sisters' fault they are a bit off. And they are just left to die in the Mell? I can't believe people would do that. I can't believe Dumbledore would allow that.”
She was right of course. Harry had noticed it instantly, the moment he had met Half. All of them – Wolfe, BraveHeart, Half, even Ember – were not just around his age, but also glowing with that inner light. Not the horses though. Harry mused for a second if horses couldn't glow in this world.
the tiny boy squeaked and threw himself so vigorously into Seeker's arms that the latter stumbled a few steps back before he regained his footing. Only for a second though, for Wolfe barrelled into them right after, followed by Ember who enveloped all three of them in a bone-crushingly tight embrace.
They both stared at it in surprise and for a long moment that was all that happened. Then the trick stair opened up and swallowed both boys whole, plunging them into the darkness underneath.
Two weeks later, Draco scrapped up all his courage and ventured into enemy territory: He needed new dress robes for the wedding (now
Grinning a bit, she put down her own name as return address and placed the 'pass' note on the front. Yeah, she was, wasn't she? “Stuff this one into the other one. This way, your brother can use the pre-approved envelope to forgo the screening. That should work.”
He noted a sense of nostalgia, even though he had been here a lot of times after the war. But tonight was different. It felt like the start of a new era.
Death shrugged, upsetting Holle on his shoulder. It looked absurdly normal. His words however were everything but: “I appeared to him in a dream when he was but a boy. I told him rather, er, intently to look for the cloak and find it.”
Their furious faces only inches apart, Potter's breath huffed hot on Draco's cheeks. “I don't know who rained on your parade, Scarhead, but I've got enough of your little-boy-tantrum. Start again and I'll hex you.” With a final hard squeeze Draco pushed Potter's arms away and sat up on his heels.
“Alright, looks like we have a destination,” Draco announced, gesturing for father and child to come closer.
"Potter," he sighed. He had to remember the kitchenware mnemonic trick somehow... and be more careful.
“And whose fault is that, I wonder? Couldn't get me out sooner now, could you?” spat Draco. How dare Potter talk to him like that when he himself looked like a walking World Hunger Aid ad? Seriously, did that boy never eat?
“And maybe have some eggnog after, in the kitchens? It is Christmas after all.” Potter bumped his shoulder into Draco's (something Draco didn't appreciate – Potter being overly chummy) as they started towards the hidden side entrance for patch workers on the east side of the castle.
One very memorable encounter among these had been the return of Kreacher early one January morning, coming back to Grimmauld Place to greet his master(s).
Draco stared down onto the broom unfocussed, his breath suddenly too shallow to draw in enough air. Fucking get a grip, Draco!
It had been a fun afternoon, with lots of jokes and laughter. It had almost felt like they were back to being innocent children, unburdened by the weight of war.
the work had been finished. And how he liked to fall into the easy banter they were so good at and which had by now become more lighthearted and less scalding.
From the impact, Potter toppled, ending up hanging on to Draco's left ear. Grumbling, Draco held his wand into the bubble for Potter to grab hold off, which he did (he weighed almost nothing, weird) and he was placed back on top of Draco's head.
He left the bathroom and went for the bedroom, but something caught his interest: There was the door to the little library Harry had started at Hermione's request, right before being taken by The Hunt.
He smoothed down his robes and emerged from his hiding spot. “Good evening, Mrs. Weasley. I'm sorry to intrude at such a late hour but I need to discuss something with,” he gestured towards the still-staring Weasel now plastered with a quivering mess of girl, “your son.” Pause. “And Granger. If she's here,” he added in an afterthought.
Let me go! Fuck it!” Seeker struggled fruitlessly, tears of outrage over the backstabbing springing to his eyes . “You made me forget about what little I had left of my life! You made me forget about
“You have one though,” veered the bushy-headed witch round Draco, “up in the Manor.” It wasn't really a question.
Draco rolled his eyes. Yes, yes, everyone had heard about the (completely stupid and unnecessary) heroics of Saint Potter during the first task. How very Gryffindor to not make winning the priority. This goody-goody nice guy routine was so...
Death crossed his arms in front of his chest and looked a bit like a petulant little child while doing so. “You boys think you're so smart and, admittedly, comparatively you are. But do you honestly expect that we'd believe even for a second, Draco would let you come here alone? After everything? I mean, we can't see him, since you cleverly put the Invisibility Cloak on him, but I bet Sleipnir that he's standing right next to you. So, maybe it's time to drop the masquerade.”
Howard, draped on the rug, eyed the intruder with a whipping tail. The owl ignored him and dutifully delivered its mail to Draco.
“...okay, Daddy.” The boy offered his father a drooled-on hand. Neither of the two even glanced at Seeker.
“It's not made from real unicorns though, right?” Hermione asked sharply but George just laughed and led them into the Great Hall where the rest of the Weasley family had assembled at one of the long tables laden with food, Hogwarts-style.
...and landed knee-deep in powder snow, in the middle of the riders, on a flat mountain top overlooking a wide landscape down below.
Teddy blinked and felt in the pocket for more, coming up with a ticket-shaped piece of cardboard. For a moment, it was blank but then two words in cursive black inking appeared:
Harry released his grip and Malfoy scrambled off him, purposefully kneeing Harry in the stomach in the process.
All of the sudden, Draco found his toes immensely fascinating. Even after all these months together, a few well-placed words from Harry could fluster Draco to the point of blushing. Stupid thing to be so dreadfully besotted. “...I missed you,” he mumbled to the floor.
been thinking. About the Black lineage being extinct, about Kreacher the house-elf listening to Draco's orders, about the dreadful Manor and its close proximity to the gatehouse... and about Grimmauld Place' big library and the cosy bedroom next door.
had spurred Harry into action without minding anything much. Being brave in the face of danger was one thing, but being bold in romantic things was normally not his forte.
Despair reared its ugly head and made an attempt for his heart, but Draco swallowed it down bravely. They found him once, they would find him again. Together.
The merwoman was quiet. When she finally spoke, her voice was strained. “It means mourning.” She did not look at them. “Among other things. I suppose your friend used it in terms of ignominy. Ah, first marking.”
“That's not why you're out tonight though, is it?” Ron had folded his arms across his scrawny chest and tried hard to look just as intimidating as Warrington who had about an inch on him. “
Draco turned bright red. He must have got a sunburn. “Excuse me?! If anyone was watching anyone, it was
They were sitting down side by side at the bank, next to the tomb, their silhouettes reflected in the dark waters.
Nothing. She just can't remember Harry at that point and deducted that the Grim had to have been in Ron's cup.
“Great. Thanks so much,” Draco said politely and tried to free his arm. “We got it from here. Just upwards is not that difficult.”
The sooner he got away from this git, the better. Especially with those disturbing ideas circling in his head all the time now, like thinking of Malfoy as... well,
Pansy couldn't help but snort. “Oh please, Weasel, don't pretend like you can think on your own. We all know Granger does the brainwork in your trio.”
“Draco?” an unfamiliar voice was heard. Harry, confused for a second, turned his head to find Mr. Withane with Dreamer's living body in his arms, shifting uneasily from foot to foot. In the turmoil of their welcomes, the quiet farmer had been ignored by the gang.
– like Malfoy then the answer is: We don't know.” Portrait-Harry provided. “But the fact that we are even asking this question is kind of... you know, tell-tale?"
But he didn't, because Mabel had swung round so fast, she'd been a blur and now her ugly face was pressed into the Bubble-Head Charm. “Careful!” she hissed. “Be very,
Draco let out a long breath and then leant back against Harry's shoulder. “Mister Ollivander said that my wand only listens to me, that it has no connection left to you. It completely changed its loyalty back to me.”
Potter went pale, then swirled around to scoop up Ronald's hand and gaped at the identical jewellery on his best mate's finger. “You got
at the obstacle. It was some sort of stone wall. Reluctantly he let his free hand wander over the surface. It felt natural: bumpy and jagged. He pulled his hand back when it made contact with something slimy that turned out to be a sole, resting upside-down on the stone. Disgusting.
Sir Nicholas looked a bit annoyed upon being hastened, but he still replied with: “As soon as tomorrow I would think. Find me in the Great Hall after dinner.”
“Yes, Ada and Mabel, A and M, Aoife and Murcus. Ah, that's right, you wouldn't know: Our 'hearts' are not just a pledge of true love but also our way of reproducing. Both partners pour their feelings into a 'heart' and new life is created, a gift – or return gift in mother's case.” She proudly puffed her chest out. “And multiple children are a sign of overflowing love, the purest kind.”
“Worse,” nodded Nott solemnly. “Malfoy, you have to talk some sense into him. You're the only one he will listen to at this point.”
He entered Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions and was greeted by the cheerful owner, a squat witch dressed in mauve.
of our letters. The others are pissed at you, too. Just so you're aware. But that's not the important thing right now. Let's hurry.”
“Oof, don't use the big words now, Harry, you'll make Ron dizzy,” Ginny teased and shoved at her brother.
Draco squawked: “Are you crazy?! Do you know what you're doing? You're throwing away immortality! You're going to die!”
“I don't mind,” commented Potter lightly and smiled. Was the air in here getting thinner? “At least this way Kreacher wasn't alone. Where is he by the way?”
Then however: “He did not try to be your friend though, did he? More like...” hesitation, then in a slightly more high-pitched whisper, “your...
Chess pieces started darting at them, hitting Malfoy and the wall behind them. Thud, thud, clank, thud. Harry was pressed, face-first, into the soft, painted bark of the summer tree and the dim part of his brain that wasn't occupied with howling registered that this was a pretty unique way of dying: being crushed and torn apart at the same time.
As weary as Draco was of the Forest, others seemed to be even less inclined to do this work, so he had ended up marching out on his own on this crisp autumn day at the end of October (not super unusual per se).
.” Here, he shot Draco a meaningful look, which made the blond boy blush. “Anyway, she who is without name, gave great power to other people's names. Sometimes, facing final judgement, the right name at the right time can save a life – or end it. But that's another story and shall be told another time.”
“So, what happened to your daughter? Did she get kidnapped and no one remembers her but you?” Draco asked, trying to look sympathetic, but inwardly bouncing with impatience.
A young merman with sharp teeth clapped his hands twice. “Two lines! Seals to the right,” (“He means ocean-borns.”) “salmons to the left.”
Now, during setting-in dusk, Seeker was tired of the pranks. He grumbled under his breath, brushing feathers off his clothes. It had been such a nice game!
surely blamed himself; for all the wrong reasons. After all, it had been Hermione's idea and if she hadn't–
exist. So that meant there had to be more – records about the lore, maybe even precedent. He had to make a trip back to Hogwarts tomorrow, see if there was anything to be found in the library.
It had been a mix of reluctant respect for Potter's steadfastness in the face of a mostly hostile Hogwarts and the startling discovery that Potter's silhouette on a broom against a raging dragon was somewhat dashing. Most of all though, it had been during the second task that Draco had finally understood his complicated feelings with sudden, terrible certainty (ever since, he'd proceeded in locking them tightly into a box deep within himself, only to peek at them occasionally): When it had seemed as though Potter might have drowned, Draco's heart had been in severe distress.
More alarming yet were the other things, Draco was sure, he had forgotten somehow. There were loose threats in his thoughts and connections he couldn't make anymore. Bits and pieces of Potter disappeared every day from Draco's memory. The name was just the tip of the iceberg.
As the people had squeezed into every available corner, filling staircases and the entrances of hallways, the portal to the Great Hall was closed and now showed a veiled something hanging on either wing of the door.
Her gaze fell back onto the parchment and she startled. Where Harry and Malfoy had been just a second ago, their names had suddenly vanished from the map without a trace and with them the whole staircase they'd been depicted on. Poof and gone, just like that. She blinked furiously and let her eyes roam this way and that to recapture the two boys but with no avail.
“Everyone sees in The Beginning what they desire most,” explained BraveHeart in an uncharacteristically expert voice. “Unless their want aligns itself with the purpose of The Hunt, which is to catch the prey. Like us. We all see the same.”
Just as Harry opened his mouth to either protest the last bit or ask after the first bit, Draco's hand closed vice-like around Harry's wrist.
Though his wand illuminated a wider area, they were still basically hovering in a sea of murk.  He moved his arm from left to right only to reveal little floating pieces of debris, appearing and disappearing in the spotlight.
“It's their party as much as ours. After all, they did a lot of repairs around the castle,” Thomas snivelled. “They are actually rather fun to be around.”
And a never big enough thank you to my beta, umbrellaless22: You are a true oblectament in my life <3
Harry arched questioningly an eyebrow at Draco who shrugged. “Don't look at me. They decided that for themselves.”
The speaker ploughed on though: “We all know who to thank for winning the war.” Her eyes gleamed with tears of emotion and sought Harry's group in the crowd. Uh oh. “Without further ado, we would like to honour the Saviour and show our gratitude. Thank you, Mr. Potter!”
Harry was noticing Draco's presence was everywhere – ranging from the diverse array of pottery around the whole house, to the new (partly Muggle!) clothes in the wardrobe to the world map full of Hunt clues pinned to Harry's (and now Draco's) bedroom wall. It was strange yet eternally soothing to see their innate
When the noise had died down a bit, Potter's upside down head appeared before Draco's eyes, making him a bit wall-eyed. “What a story, right? Though... wait, the lake hasn't always been here? It was made from merpeople's tears?”
It was nightfall when Draco left for the Patchers' party at Hogwarts, which he would be attending alone, since neither Ronald nor Hermione had ever really gotten into patching after their return from Australia and all those in attendance that were actual Patchers preferred The Burrow over the castle tonight. Draco could understand that. He would have liked to stay longer, but he had some people to meet.
But I'll try my best to be on time next week. In any case the next chapter should be out before Christmas.
Draco nodded politely, just happy she'd treat him nicely even after the last time he'd been here, throwing a fit with his mother, back in sixth year.
“Tea!” the Weasel interrupted, making weird eye signs at Draco. “I'll make some nice calming tea. How about you all sit down in the living room and er, don't freak out meanwhile, yeah?” He rushed off.
Though it had been beyond cute to see self-confident Draco floundering. Hadn't it been so sweet, the way he had tried to protect Harry from himself? Albeit mostly baseless, the fact that Draco had come up with so many arguments made Harry wonder just how long the other boy had thought about being with him...
“Yes, Scarhead, and it's none of your business yet and no, he won't tell you either, so you don't even have to try. He promised,” blazoned Draco and linked arms with Harry, marching them both down the stairs towards their bedroom.
I did. Although really 90 percent of Hunt stuff derives from 'real' lore. All the weird little side episodes, details or titbits you find about The Hunt have some connection to lore I found while researching.
I think the male part is more for Draco and the female for Harry, contentwise? Maybe. But assign them lines however you see fit.
Pulling two Weasley jumpers from the wardrobe (an older green one of Harry's and a brand-new light grey one of Draco's), Harry mumbled under his breath: “Wear this, brought me good luck in The Hunt.”
“Of course,” Harry said valiantly and wished he hadn't the moment Ember's heavy body squished in behind him on Lightning's back. Strong arms surrounded his waist and the stench of burning was all over him.
“Oh, oh, you can share mine! Do you want some?” BraveHeart had also found them and shoved a piece of half-frozen bread in Harry's face.
The Slytherin had taken to calling Queen Harry 'Your Majesty', because the latter had kept responding whenever Malfoy had ordered Harry to "Potter, do this". That had been terribly unnerving.
He knew what the red knots meant, but truthfully, he wasn't that afraid of dying anymore. Here in The Hunt, it wouldn't change anything for him. Seeker sometimes wondered why he had ever made a fuss about this. He was happy... and yet, there was a part of him (that he deliberately ignored) that constantly whispered of other things, of something
“Can't,” Malfoy shifted a bit and Harry's stomach swooped awkwardly as the blond wizard's ass ground accidentally into Harry's nether regions, “too knobbly. Now, spread your legs, Potter.” Harry, still preoccupied with the aforementioned feeling, choked and Malfoy sniggered meanly. “Pervert. I meant: Make room, so I can sit
know where The Wild Hunt resides. However, Patrick – that is Sir Patrick Delaney-Podmore to you – has at one point in our long acquaintanceship insinuated to have crossed paths with their bunch. I deem he would know where to encounter them.”
Malfoy nodded. “Right. So, if he's not coming, there's a good reason. But I doubt it's leaving the oddballs in the Mell to themselves. Because house-elves are loyal to their death. They wouldn't simply abandon the sisters.”
The Weasel reached for a closely written page. “I'll start then, yes? Okay, so The Wild Hunt,  also abbreviated to The Hunt, is a phenomenon that is known in wide parts of Western and Middle Europe as well as Scandinavia and Canada. The stories about The Hunt vary strongly depending on the country or even region, as is seen in Germany where there can be found up to nine different versions. What most of them have in common is that The Hunt is a procession of (fabulous) animals and people said to be ghosts or the souls of the lost. They predominantly travel on horseback in the sky, although there is also a variation with them sitting in a giant canoe or fishing boat or versions with them riding pigs instead of horses. There are reports in which they wear masks or look demonic and they appear often during winter storms, which fits with the frequently mentioned appearance period of Yule- or Twelvetide. Although The Hunt is also quoted to be in action during other big religious holidays, winter seems to be the main time of activity. Its manifestations are regularly connected to pending doom or death.”
. Draco had just been too upset before to notice all the little things that had popped up where there had been nothing for a whole year: a stack of Auror books on the bedside table, pictures of the Golden Trio on the walls, two lonely holey socks on the floor. This was Potter's bedroom. Draco had been sleeping in Potter's bed...
No words were enough to articulate what was in Harry's heart and he simply put his arms around his late husband, pulling him close and resting his forehead on Draco's shoulder. “I wasn't sure I'd ever see you again,” Harry's voice broke and he felt the tears he'd held back this last week finally spill over. “I mean I thought I would, like this. But I wasn't sure, I couldn't be sure. Dammit, Draco, do you always
Not for Seeker though, he was antsy. He jumped down from Lightning's back and frustratedly watched as everyone else moved super-slow and then – were they for real? – attempted to start a camp fire.
He caught it with the instincts of a former Seeker – and dropped it instantly as if it had burnt him. Which it had, in a way.
Why was it again he felt obliged to get presents for everyone and their cat this year? Oh yeah, remorse and some such... and possibly, we wrinkled his nose,
“Ronald!” Granger hissed, slapping her boyfriend onto the upper arm. “Don't yell like that in a sleeping baby's room! You'll wake her.”
“Possibly,” Granger shrugged uncomfortably, “but we can't go in there. The books scream when you open them at night.”
That's the main reason, Berchthold's and Holle's curses are kept vague. Because both their origins lie within religious beliefs.
“Wait!” Kreacher had suddenly appeared, ears flapping with excitement. He held out what looked like an old Muggle camera. “A picture for Master Harry to remember!”
Darkness, all consuming, crashed over him, making it impossible to breath. People dying, his friends dying and it was his fault, his fault, his–
The ginger looked offended, but then he grinned. “Natural talent, Ferret. Apropos, we are thinking of opening another store and we are still searching for a manager – want to interview for the position? Of course then
Your friendship is warm like an inglenook. Take my hands across the distance and let's gambol, for Storm Chasers has come to a successful ending.
“Fuck, ah, bloody hell!” The sudden movement had caused a silver pocket watch to fall from Malfoy's cloak's inside pocket, as he had leant over the table. Now the good piece lay in the butter. “Dammit!” In his frenzy to salvage the apparently expensive watch, he yanked at its fob chain with too much strength and the timepiece sailed right out of the butter and into Malfoy's untouched, still-full cup of tea.
“Not sure. But maybe that they're subterranean somehow? Anyway, that didn't work, so we better go on to the library and find out more about that mystery place.”
“I'm trying,” came the irritated answer and he felt something move in his hair (yikes, don't think of spiders!).“It doesn't work. Maybe my magic shrank to this size, too?”
“It's not a given to put oneself in danger to save others, Master Seeker. I will compensate you with good advice: Look at the stars.”
“I know,” whined the redhead, arms over his face, “but this surface is already a chaotic heap of tangled nonsense and honestly, Hermione, one more book and I'll go crazy.”
He only stopped once, briefly, to indicate a completely empty chamber. “This room here as well... there is something about it. I can't recall why it's so bare. It feels like maybe the
Out of the pipe, they'd found themselves in a long, obviously still underground passage that stretched in both directions. Harry had used the Four-Point Spell that he'd learnt last year to guide him through the maze and they had been walking since. Well, Malfoy had been.
“No, you oaf, this is my DA Galleon. Let me just quickly...” Hermione waved her wand in an intricate pattern over the little piece of gold until it glowed. “There, now mine's a master coin, too, just like Harry's –
If I'm not replying right away it's because I have a lot on at the moment. But I read them all and they encourage me, so thank you x100!!
Draco had to smile bitterly. He himself probably didn't look much better. That's why they were here after all, out in the freezing cold, in the fast approaching dusk, on Christmas.
That was how, one sunny day in early summer, the Malfoy family had found themselves acquitted of their war crimes. And while coming home to the Manor after dwelling in holding cells for weeks should have been the best treat, they all had felt an uneasiness that wouldn't go away. Too tainted was the house, with all the shadows of the past haunting it — and them.
“Hm,” hummed Draco. Now probably wasn't the best time to point out that Potter had barely ever spent time with his girlfriend anyway and that this break-up had been inevitable. Also, Draco had seen it coming from miles away. Good riddance, if you asked him.
Percy! Patil? Peeves...? He couldn't recall. Draco started to panic. Peter? Pansy! Pans, pots - Potter! Potter!! Relief flooded him.
“That's why we constantly called you 'Seeker' in the beginning,” Wolfe added quietly, while holding Seeker's hand. “Your Hunt name erased your alive name.” She blinked tears away. “Because the only way for you to escape, back to your life, would be if someone outside of The Hunt would call you by your name. But we knew that there was no one left who remembered you, so...”
“The stars...?” Seeker tilted his head upwards, but of course, it was daytime and also the trees hindered his view. When had he last seen the stars though? Sure, during flying there had been sun and moon (and probably stars), but here inside the forest realm? At all times a big snow cloud hovered over the base camp at Holle's Pond, so... Really, it had been forever since Seeker had regarded a unveiled night sky.
Draco was close to bursting into hysterical laughter. What had he expected? He pushed his rising panic down.
“No,” Harry insisted, “I have to say this now: You and Snape always mocked me about how I thought I was better than everyone else and it used to drive me mad because I thought you were so far off, but the truth is,” he faltered, then went on, “the truth is, you were right about me. I didn't realise it until later, but being treated as if I was special in the wizarding world got to my head and subconsciously I acted as if I were. I broke the rules. I broke the law. Hell, I used Unforgivable Curses. And I... I nearly killed you, Draco. I'm so sorry!”
“I guess we can tell you. After all, it's not like you could do anything with the knowledge: So another form of ghost-like afterimage is created by the Resurrection Stone. You might have heard about it, if you are familiar with 'The Tale of the Three Brothers'.”
“I guess I was,” Seeker acknowledged quietly. Hearing their reasons had quenched most of his anger. “And I see why you thought it necessary, although you should have just told me. But why should I know what's going on? Backstabbing me like that was just...”
. He had simultaneously cried and spat out for half an hour, cursing those wicked pranksters up and down.
“You're not small, you're tiny. And may I remind you that the reason you are, is that you consumed questionable comestible? You're not eating this and neither am I.”
“So your theory is that Draco and Potter somehow got into that alleged hidden room of Helga Hufflepuff's and that for some reason they can't come out?” she picked up the conversation.
Longbottom followed his grandmother, but then he quickly turned around. “By the way, there will be a Patchers' Christmas party at Hogwarts tomorrow night. In the kitchens. You should come. Oh and: Nice work on the Slytherin common room lake window! See you tomorrow!”
Skidding on the stone tiles of the third floor Charms corridor, he dug his fingertips into a corner to use his momentum to propel himself around it. He was a fast runner, but he had only a slight lead and–
Harry tried and came up blank once again. They were still glued to the cup and Malfoy was still basically holding his hand. Which was not all that uncomfortable... which was disconcerting on a totally different level.
Draco looked away. Half-breeds. These grimy water dwellers were even worse than he had thought, not even real merpeople. And yet (and that gnawed at him quite a bit), he was somehow touched by their tragic story. Well, not
To no one's surprise, it was Hermione – she and Ron just over for tea – who had pointed out then that probably the reason Kreacher had never followed Draco's orders one hundred percent (e.g. not permanently staying in Hogwarts) was because Harry had always, even when away, been Kreacher's true master. All had nodded to that.
At that moment, a pandemonium of geese noises was heard, prompting the fugleman to give the sign for departure by playing a short tune on a harp that had been fastened on his saddle. The whole mob scrambled to get to their mounts.
“Dobby cannot feel Harry Potter's presence at all. Unless Harry Potter is in...” the tiny fellow trailed off and went pale. “Harry Potter might be in the Mell. That would be an explanation.”
Draco paused, blinked. "I... don't recall." He furrowed his brows. “Must have been a spur of the moment thing.”
You might think that this is too personal and that it doesn't belong here, but I'd like to take this opportunity to remind us all that these are our lives and they are too short to bow to social expectations.
Everyone froze in their saddles. People were supposed to avoid The Hunt. Provoking it was most unwise and all the world knew it.
“You, Draco Malfoy, are hereby allowed to see and enter number twelve, Grimmauld Place, London, the former Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix,” Granger announced in earnest tone, after she and Draco had arrived on snow-covered pavement seconds before.
Dying, someone was dying. Of course this shouldn't come as such a surprise for Harry since he was riding with a ghost army, but he still felt shell-shocked. This mustn't be happening, not again, not here, not–
The redhead ran a hand through his hair. His eyes were locked on the clock over the fireplace in the common room, where they were the last two sitting. “But it's one minute to curfew! What if Umbridge catches him and gives him more of that torturous detention! You know his luck; he always gets into trouble.”
Silence. Then: “Yeah, I... it is just hard to be at The Burrow after everything. Especially on Christmas. I mean, everyone's trying their best to act cheerful, but... there are these pauses... in between... where his laughter would have been.” Potter swallowed and Draco felt the sudden urge to reach out and touch his shoulder.
Three reasons. One, because this off-ness exists only when Life and Death are both in human form, and two because Harry is aware of him being the master now and is no longer as affected. Also, three, Death and Life toned their presence down a bit, for Draco's sake, sensing Harry's wishes.
The stairs they were trapped on were on the left side confined by a yawning chasm of darkness and even when Harry leant over the handrail as much as he could and peered down, he saw nothing but dust particles, doing a slow dance in the flickering glow of the only source of illumination in the stairwell. The light stemmed from two candles, respectively mounted on the left and right corner of an ancient-looking grandfather clock that had partly been built into the wall at around the height of the trick step.
They also had found out that The Hunt's leader had, among his many names, also the alias of Siegfried, the famous dragon slayer. A fact that had caused the Weasel to speculate about Draco's chances to best the spectre. That could have easily turned into a fight if it hadn't been that very moment that Granger, by now deaf to the boys' constant bickering, had read out loud that
Draco was a bit sad to leave already, but he had promised his parents to be there before dinner and even a Portkey to France still took some time.
“Wish I knew. Hermione got me up right before dawn and insisted we come see you and go– where again?” He turned to his girlfriend who was impatiently tapping her foot.
Both boys were neck and neck until – whomp! – Seeker ran full-speed into an invisible obstacle. Again.
“Do we have everything?” Draco asked anxiously for the seventh time and Harry gave him a patient look. So what if Draco was still very uneasy about the idea of Harry anywhere near The Hunt?  Even though there had been no incidents the whole past year
It couldn't possibly be something so frivolous as love? And even if it were, Ronald  and Hermione loved Potter before his disappearance; others too. How could
“What I don't get,” said Cassius, chewing his lower lip, “is how they could be on that amazing map of yours one moment and then not anymore. I mean, that is a real piece of complex magic.” His eyes shone with excitement. “It shows where we are
His parents greeted him at the door and he was happy to see them. But after that, Christmas dinner turned out less enjoyable than Draco had hoped.
The former Slytherin wordlessly handed the letter to Hermione and proceeded in unwrapping an old, well-thumbed book titled
Half an hour later, the window finally stayed see-through and revealed the lake: murky darkness aside from numerous glinting dots of bioluminescence and in the distance, a ghostly shine, probably stemming from the merpeople’s dwellings. It was eerily breathtaking.
All around him, hunters were getting off their horses and started gathering in small, noisy groups around quickly built camp fires that dotted the surrounding embankment. Soon the  snow-dusted conifers were casting shadows in the frosty morning.
“Yeah,” Harry acquiesced and burrowed his nose in Draco's hair. Then he pulled back a bit. “Why in school?”
“Sure thing! Wouldn't lose it, boss,” the tiny, masked boy grinned like a Cheshire cat, visibly proud to have been named flag bearer of this game. He pulled out a crumpled piece of rainbow-coloured cloth from his pocket and presented it.
...oh and, if you think I forgot something in the last scene. I didn't. Someone else did. And they will figure that out in the next chapter. So, just you know, it is deliberate.
“Here, have some steel.” Ember had appeared at his shoulder and handed Harry a piece of shiny metal.
for making room for me in their busy world <3 Go, check out their stories, if you want to have the feels ^^
So he told Mr. Ollivander the whole story about Potter and The Wild Hunt, concluding with: “... and that's why I was wondering whether or not we were right with our assessment? That Potter owning my wand for a while makes up the strong connection needed so that I didn't forget about him when everyone else did?”
were the one who drank the tea.” His eyes became dreamy again when they flicked back to Malfoy, trying a wobbly Levitation Charm on himself. “You should have listened to Draco. He's way smarter than you – a real turn-on.”
“And I just thought... neither were Aoife and Murcus. Monsters, I mean, and yet, each race considered the other so – humans towards merpeople, merpeople towards humans; those two towards each other, until they met and realised it wasn't so. Before, they thought the only right way to live was theirs, respectively, and damned all others. They could not see past their biases.” Harry waited a moment. Certainly Malfoy was smart enough to get the allusion?
Which was confirmed by a yelp from the other boy a mere second later: “Shit! No, H-4! H-4! I meant H-4! Stupid watch got me distracted! Queen to H-4!”
Muggle... Draco thoughtfully turned the page over. He wondered if Potter had ever heard that story. If maybe, secretly, as a child Harry had always hoped to go to Mother Holle's realm and be rewarded, while his stupid cousin would be punished. Draco smiled at the thought: Gold Harry and Pitch Harry.
Draco huffed. “Sure, that is a fairy tale. Three brothers get three gifts from Death:  the  Cloak of Invisibility that makes you invisible even to Death himself, the Resurrection Stone that can bring back dead people and the Elder Wand that is said to be an invincible wand. Two brothers waste their gifts and die, but one doesn't and bests Death. Correct? But no one in their right mind would believe that things like that truly exist. I mean, except for maybe weirdos like Lovegood who spout nonsense saying that owning all three of the gifts would make you master of Death. Complete cock-and-bull story, that is. As if objects like that could ever be real.”
“I don't see what that has got to do with The Hunt,” Ronald interrupted, twirling Theodore's letter between his fingers.
There was a moment of fumble and Pansy briefly wondered if Granger just insinuated for Weasley to grope her.
“I'm not sure.” Half kneaded his lower lip. “But red means dead and white means witness, so maybe one red knot means he... wanted to die?” He darted a glance at Harry who vehemently shook his head... and then hesitated. He suddenly had the oddest feeling, as if, as if maybe, deep down, he had really... but no, impossible...
Draco pressed closer into Harry's side when they heard hoofbeats approaching, but he didn't say a word.
want to help him because I... miss him. I mean, after the war... with him is the only place I feel truly safe.”
Potter, that idiot! Why didn't he ever listen? Why did he have to look? Draco huffed and shook his head. Because Potter was a bloody curious Gryffindor, that's why. And as such, he could very well save himself. Hadn't he done so numerous times in the past already? Why should Draco even bother?
Huffing, Draco turned away and crossed his arms over his chest. Now that Potter wasn't here, Weasley seemed to have taken over at keeping Draco annoyed. Great, just great.
Ember's sunken-in eyes met Harry's over the camp fire and he quickly looked away. There was something about this cinder man that was deeply disturbing.
“Anyway...” Harry started, unsure of what exactly he wanted to say but suddenly desperate to keep the conversation going.
His fingers were snatched by Teddy and Draco lowered himself next to the cradle, reaching for a storybook. It was the one that Aunt Andromeda's late husband had bought for his grandson. That was of course before Muggle-born Uncle Ted had been murdered.
“I suppose.” Draco using his poshest voice when putting his arms around his boyfriend's neck, made Harry laugh.
“That's bullshit!” Harry didn't like either Crabbe or Goyle but to basically call them useful henchmen was just too much. He whirled round at Malfoy, daring him to affirm or deny.
The truth was – and they both knew it – that even if he would spend as much time patching as Malfoy, Harry would never get the finer aspects of counter-balancing and all that since he wasn't paying enough attention. He was good while doing it, but dry theory just wasn't his cup of tea.
Maybe one last try, while they were in Q&A-mode. “Here's another thing I've been wondering about: What exactly is your curse, Ber– Death?”
“Then how about another helping of pudding? Who wants some?” Mrs. Weasley was already on her way towards the kitchen and didn't even count the unanimously up-shooting hands. She paused in the doorway. “Would you like some as well?” She smiled at Draco.
The gang dissolved into laughter, while the newly named man-dog Scoffer looked accusingly at them all in turn before putting his head back onto his paws with a huff.
for her. Ever. That's why I was thinking, maybe a new life would do her better than this half-life she sleeps away.”
tiresome. Also, it was late, Draco was exhausted. All he wanted was to crawl into his bed. Screw Potter and the merlady. Screw The Wild Hunt.
“I always had a thing for redheads,” Wolfe remarked, not taking her eyes off Half's face. “Let's go, lover, I want to dance with you!”
“Are you ever going to knock?” Weasley shifted from one foot to the other. “It's bloody cold out here.”
“Alright, look here, let's make this easy. We all agree I'm master of Death, yeah?” Astounded nods. The others were taken by surprise over Harry's sudden change of pace. “Right, so, as master of Death, I declare the following – ready?” He looked Death straight in the eye. “You don't need a master. You, Death, are no longer required to be the leader of The Wild Hunt. I set you free. ”
Well, apparently their guide, because Mabel's inner storm cloud instantly brightened. “Oh, many things: Reeling and Writhing, and then the different branches of Arithmetic (Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision). Mystery (ancient and modern), Seaography, then Drawling (with the old conger-eel),” (Potter snorted a laugh.) “Stretching and of course  Fainting in Coils.” She counted off the subject on her webbed, greyish fingers. “You can also pick extras like French, Music and Washing.”
Seeker huffed. “Gosh, Wolfe, you know how I detest well-articulated answers that make sense. Please don't bore me with needless details.”
“Yeah, I, sure, okay, you're right, yeah,” Seeker ran a hand through his unruly black hair and smiled sheepishly. Of course, going back now would mean leaving his friends behind. His heart felt torn. Yet he had made up his mind the moment his eyes had met the other boy's. Seeker simply needed to speak with Grey Eyes; even if that meant saying goodbye to his gang.
Even though Draco was sure he had never seen him before, he knew him. That boy over there on the pale palomino was... everything. Plain and simple. He was everything.
“Because,” the Chosen One sobered, “you guys weren't the only ones who forgot. I did, too. It's part of The Hunt's magic. Makes you forget your life so you don't want to go back to it.”
In The Hunt Harry had learnt to take things a bit easier, but that didn't mean he'd been as confident as he had let on. His nerves had been fluttering like crazy.
He growled as someone bumped into his shoulder. The street was way too crowded and people staring down at their present lists didn't pay attention to their surroundings much. At least no one had attacked him. Yet. Although these incidences had become less and less.
“Once upon a time there were two step-sisters both named Mary. One kind and zealous, the other mean and lazy. One after the other, they met Mother Holle, a friendly elderly woman, in her magical realm. She asked them for help with some tasks, like fluffing up the bedding until feathers came out thus making it snow in the real world. In the end the good girl who had done all tasks, got rewarded by being bathed in gold and was henceforth called Gold Mary. But the bad girl who had slept all day, got punished by being doused in pitch and was henceforth called Pitch Mary. The end.”
“I'm sure they will,” Death surmised, “but all in due time. Until then, we will continue the task. Voluntarily.” He winked. “It's something I've learned from you,
Placing the cup on the mantelpiece, Harry hummed. “Is that so.” His tone was gentle... too gentle. Draco glanced up just in time to see the attack coming, before Harry was all over him with his hot mouth and his nimble hands and his–
Draco ignored Twin Weasley and his girlfriend Johnson sucking face in a corner and opted for the couch instead, regretting it instantly. To escape the baby-conversation afoot between the Minister, Aunt Andromeda and a newly pregnant Beauxbatons, Draco scooped up Teddy and showed him the fairy lights. It was then that he found himself frowning. Last year, when he had been here during Christmas – what exactly had he come for? And after that, why had Ronald and Hermione shown up at his doorstep? Now, they’d been researching The Wild Hunt together for so long to find the Swedish baby girl... and yet he couldn’t recall why they had started in the first place. He wrecked his brain, but by the time frustration was close, a call of “Lunch is ready!” distracted him from his bad memory. He must be getting old...
The other man looked distressed, but finally nodded once. “Yeah, okay. It's just– Draco and you were my parents. I always felt that way. Harry,” a single tear slowly slid down Teddy's cheek, “you're like a father to me.”
Of course they'd attempted other things first: Calling for a house-elf again (hadn't worked) and Harry had even tried for his Patronus to lead them the right way, but alas, his majestic stag had shrunken with him and was now merely a fawn, jumping fruitlessly a few steps ahead before evaporating into glimmering silvery mist.
“Half,” he croaked. Somehow not all there, he pushed himself up, swaying dangerously as he made his way towards the people he had thought his friends. Anger burned inside him.
When his ride didn't answer, Harry took up the thread. “Still, it's cruel to have them take care of themselves. Being locked away like that. It's not right.”
“That's right, Tillie,” commented Lacie when she followed Harry's gaze. “Tillie already has Punch and Judy. No need for more. Does it want some treacle?” she added in Malfoy's direction and produced a little glass box from under a nearby table.
Harry leant back into the touch. “Back then... I was inwardly lost. It wasn't that I felt not like living anymore, not quite. But secretly I wished myself away, I think. This guilt, that I let my friends die,” tears slowly ran down his cheeks now, “it was like a knife in my heart, every day. I thought I failed them.”
team effort, really,” Draco retorted smugly and Harry had to discreetly feel whether his face had maybe caught fire. Not that he was shy about sharing their relationship with their friends, but seeing Draco so open about it, when earlier Harry had had to fight him tooth and nail... Harry had to admit that this was something unbelievably sexy about Draco: Once he'd come to terms with a situation, he was swimmingly at ease. His confidence had always gotten under Harry's skin – one way or another.
Draco had to suppress a sneer – that thing was still alive? But it was very Longbottom. Nice to know some things never changed. Although, sometimes, change was the better way... “Visiting a friend. Greg actually. You?”
Draco ran his hand through his hair, completely upset. “There was a baby girl. In Sweden. The Hunt took her soul. I promised to bring her back. I went to the cliffs to get her. Oh God, what's wrong with me? How will I find her now?”
Seeker said goodbye to the moss folk and took a last look around the clearing that had been his home for the last year. He felt somewhat nostalgic, as if he would never come here again.
He took one measured stride forward and looked down the steep precipice. The light of the full moon reflected from the Strait of Dover made the White Cliffs glow even in the middle of the night.
Harry made a mental note of that statement, while Malfoy ignored his persistent admirer and fumbled for the handle, followed by a hasty
Before he could do so however, Harry had snatched the piece of jewellery from him. “What's that? Is there an inscription?”
Now they sort of found a rhythm in rendering their notes and Draco knew his cue. “Which brings us to the most ambiguous character in The Hunt stories: the crone. Known under 21 names so far, some call her spring, guardian of the treasures of the interior of the earth, of weaving and of the doors between worlds; queen of heaven or indeed the goddess of hearth, birth and crossroads. People say she holds a golden or silver bow and arrows, a stick, dagger, whip or hunting net as a weapon, as well as a torch, spindle and keys. She is ever and anon connected to plants such as elder which is dedicated to her, wheat for spring or stinging nettles that are to ward off misfortune. The latter can come upon you if she feels you deserve punishment, yet she is also known to give out rewards such as protection from fires. Which makes sense since she can conjure snow and hail. Oh, and also her breath can blind people. In some versions, she used to be young and beautiful once, but she is more often pictured as an old woman. She can also be a man, a raven, a black kite or, as dog, leader of the pack of hellhounds that travel with The Hunt's fugleman, who is sometimes identified to be said crone herself. So basically the leader and the old woman are two sides of the same coin.”
“WITH PLEASURE,” Slytherin Harry drowned out the real one, smirking. He tipped at his chest where the tiny silver 'I' worn by Inquisitorial Squad members was displayed and then winked at Malfoy, when Harry furiously gasped for air at the audacity. “Co-captain or better yet
“Your owl's name is... Pig...” Pansy couldn't help but remark and she exchanged looks with Cassius who shrugged.
more books. They had migrated from the shelves onto the seating furniture and the floor. The fluffy rug in the middle was buried under dozens of dictionaries in different languages and a wide array of ink bottles (in various states of emptiness) as well as, surprisingly, Muggle pens.
Seeker blinked uncomprehendingly at the two sparsely clad young women standing at an arm's length in front of him in the bright sunlight.
That sounded doable. Seeker closed his eyes and tried focusing. He blocked out all distracting thoughts of Draco, Half's betrayal, his own fear and anger and finally, in the very last corner of his mind, he found a tiny glimmer of recognition. When he opened his eyes again, he knew where to go.
Then, last week, I talked to my mother about something long ago and she used a phrase she'd said often before: "That was when you were still in the big pond." O.O Mindblown.... the subconcious is a scary thing.
“Potter!” Malfoy shot a warning glower. “Remember what happened last time you ingested something questionable?”
Harry laughed carefree, then winked at the other man suggestively. “I thought you liked me wet and dirty.”
“Ohhh,” BraveHeart, who had only been listening with half an ear until then, suddenly looked up excitedly. “Maybe you've seen the missing piece?! How awesome is that?”
Instead he stepped outside into a peaceful winter wonderland. His breath puffed white clouds in front of his face. It was bitterly cold although the wind had died down completely. Now, there was only a starry sky and innocently glittering snow, as if nothing had happened at all.
The blond boy snorted condescendingly. “I'm not surprised you read that, Potter.” Ignoring Harry's indignant “Oi!”, Malfoy turned to the apparition. “Ravens are like writing-desks, because Ravenclaws are swots.” That actually made sense.
“That's it!” Warrington cut it and beamed, looking so much like a little boy Hermione had difficulties to align the image with the mean point-docker she thought he was.
.” But Lightning, the horse, gleefully ignored his master's wishes and pranced on with The Wild Hunt.
Draco found himself surprisingly unsettled. “That's very big of her.” Something worked inside his brain. “So, your mother
As he passed Potter Draco bumped hard into his shoulder. Potter in turn grabbed Draco's arm and yanked him back.
“So glad I could provide entertainment,” Draco grumbled, sitting down primly between Lovegood and Thomas.
Turning the ring in the light, Harry read loudly: “Scarhead & Treacle.” He then looked at Draco with the fondest smile and let him slip the engagement band on. “I always did love treacle...”
Just when Draco's pain receptors were reporting that there would probably be shelf-shaped bruises on his back tomorrow, Potter shifted them both and walked them the three steps to the bed while brashly grabbing Draco's ass, before dumping the blond boy onto the mattress.
,” Draco recited which earnt him several odd looks from the assembled party. And he hadn't even sung them to a tune. He blushed ever so slightly. “Ahem, so, what I think happened is that Potter didn't close his eyes and looked at The Hunt instead, which is why he got spirited away.”
“Ugh, Potter! You're all wet and dirty! Gross! Did you take a mudbath?” Draco wiped at his lips. Earth was not his favourite taste.
“Yes, everything. The pictures, the food. All there.” Harry rummaged in the gift basket the couple had assembled, holding up items as he spoke, then he stopped short. “What's this though?”
Draco stared uncomprehending, but Ron at his side dissolved into a new burst of giggles, making Draco frown. “I don't get it. What's so funny?” How he hated to be outside their little in-jokes sometimes.
Harry sobered quickly and nodded, while Draco looked as if he had half a mind to rip the Key apart. Harry shot him a warning glare and Draco, glaring back, thrust the Hallow at him with a disapproving hmpf.
Harry blinked, then blinked again. “No way...” If Malfoy hadn't clearly also been able to see her, Harry would have thought he was hallucinating. Because
. He would have simply died, just like that. Brr, scary thought. Bless Draco for having a thing for equivocal nicknames and damn good timing.
Climbing back up the stairs, Harry entertained himself briefly with the thought of telling the portrait of Walburga Black in the cellar that her great nephew Draco was currently dating a blood traitor.
The members of the gang were the only people left in the courtyard, with the majority of the procession already in flight.
“Yeah, alright,” the Weasel's hand was still firmly on Draco's shoulder, somewhat grounding him in the here and now. “I'll go in alone. No,” the redhead's grip intensified, “you shouldn't go either, Hermione. Not after everything that happened to you in there.” Draco's quivering redoubled and he felt how dangerously close he was to a full-blown panic attack. Granger on the floor, screaming; Potter, dead in Hagrid's arms and–
“I assume you'd like to try, Potter?” he asked nonchalantly. If Potter said no, Draco could still bail.
For an endless second, the impact of the sudden appearance froze Draco in place, rendering him unable to move, to talk, to blink. All he could do was stare at Harry green-eyes-black-hair-glasses bloody Potter, eye-to-eye. Eternal. Gone.
"Oh, it's a nod to the old fairy tale of Mother Holle by the Brothers Grimm. Don't you know it?” Half critically eyed the effigy. “But really, anyone who's actually met Perchta would never recognise her in that story. Aside from maybe the letting-it-snow part... and the punishment for baddies, reward for goodies bit."
After a moment though he let out a long sigh, briefly closed his eyes and offered Draco a hand to help him up. Tentatively, Draco took it and Thomas held on for a moment longer than necessary.
This one's a heavily influenced by Alice in Wonderland and Alice Through the Looking Glass, though no crossover with any certain adaptation.
He crossed the closed double doors to the Great Hall, slowed and finally stopped in front of them. He suddenly felt cold trickling into the heat that had been caused by the whole Potter business. Draco always got chills when he passed here. Carefully, with a measured gesture, he reached out to touch the left of the two copper plaques fixed to both sides of the heavy portal. His fingers traced the name,
make up was the term Sunday Children. That's a real thing – people born on Sundays are said to be magical and vice versa, magical people are assumed to have been born on a Sunday.)
Yet Potter, the eternal Gryffindor, suddenly dropped both his hands down to Draco's thighs and lifted him up, so that a surprised squeaking Draco had no choice but to instinctively wrap his legs around Potter's hips and hold on to his shoulders – and all that without breaking the kiss. The new position wasn't too bad though as the different angle enabled Draco to claim more of Potter's mouth. So, he plucked those terrible glasses off the other's nose, stored them blindly behind himself in the wardrobe and cupped Potter's face in an effort to kiss the living daylight out of him.
Despite the mediocre outcome of today's research, he was in a good mood. With no one else around, now was the time to finally give in to an urge that had been lurking at the back of his mind for a few hours. So, while straightening a family portrait showing himself and his parents, he started humming and then quietly singing:
This time he was cut short by the exultant husband: “Knock it off, Ferret. You're at our wedding. Time to grow up, don't you think,
Harry's heart raced a mile a minute. They hadn't hit the ground yet, although they surely should have had by now. What was going on? He squinted down into the dark nothing below them and then, with a bit of difficulty due to airborne manoeuvring, he pried Malfoy's fingers apart so that the other boy had to look at him. “We're not
There was a silent eye battle between the former Gryffindors then Longbottom began to speak words that made zero sense to Draco: “Er, yeah, so we were wondering if you would like to play Quidditch with us next Saturday. There's going to be a Patchers Only game at the pitch at Hogwarts.”
Hissing at times, the snake was still there, curled up at his feet, seemingly dozing off now. It was nice to have an audience that couldn't spill his secrets to others.
Potter grinned at that. “But you're giving me such good groundwork! Anyway, I think it's high time for
The reptile made an eight-figure with its body, hissing quietly. Maybe it was chasing an insect or something. “Ha, look at me, talking to a snake.”
“Yes,” Draco, who had sat down next to her in the sand, nodded, “go on.” He needed her to fill his head with cluttering information quickly to shove away the painful thoughts that had unbidden emerged at the mention of their former headmasters.
Harry sighed and made for the hallway to the dungeons, but his steps faltered before he got there and then he stopped. Damn his curiosity.
Draco suddenly felt three pairs of eyes on him. He didn’t go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks. What was that supposed to mean? Did Potter just insinuate that he had helped with the trial
Ignoring the last sentence, she narrowed her eyes at him. “So what, are you saying that you've got a bit of a
“Alright, I got it,” Harry relented. “Just one more question, yeah? If you're all dead, how come everyone's eating and drinking around here?”
It was Potter's Weasel, whose face fell. Of course, he had been expecting someone else. Anyone else. “Malfoy?!”
The only reason the Stone works differently for Harry and Draco in the Forbidden Forest is the fact that Harry is then using his right as master of Death to summon Death. He does so with the help of the Stone, as the Deathly Hallows are still linked to Death somehow.
Being in the lake, as fun as it had been (partially), had reminded him so very strongly of the occurrences from last year that his heart was heavy and aching. Something he wasn't yet ready to face and he knew it.
“No, she's...” Harry felt a bit helpless. “Malfoy, she is a book character. From a Muggle children's novel. She isn't real.”
“Really now,” drawled Harry's own voice from the other side of the table, making both him and Malfoy jump.
Draco apparently had made up his mind. Good then, because that's what Seeker wanted, too: to be freed.
“But that means Potter's out as well?!” Parkinson screeched, shaking an accusatory finger at Hermione.
“I better go, too,” decided Mabel hastily and shot off, waving at Draco and Potter as she sped away. “Take care of each other, you two!”
A bit unfocused and refusing to let go of Draco's waist, Harry managed to pull away and turn towards the pesky source of interruption. “Hm?”
It had wings alright. Many, many wings in fact. A flock of birds crossed their way, seemingly flying effortlessly through the water, their feathers glowing in all colours of the rainbow. It were lots of different species in one big flight manoeuvre: ducks, marabous, curlews, harriers, magpies, parakeets, lories, eaglets, canaries and – was that a dodo? Seeing them pass by was breathtaking and Draco distinctly heard Potter exhale in awe.
Harry whispered the words, inaudibly. He was choking on something or at least that was what it felt like. Yes, he had known tonight could be difficult but he hadn't expected to be gut-punched.
One of Malfoy's hands resolutely shoved into Harry's cheek, pushing him away and the laughing raven-haired boy faced the clock when he thought to himself: 'I wish we would though, talk it out sometime.'
“I wasn't. But that wasn't what you thought I thought you thought. Really, you have to stop trying to lie to me. I know you inside out.”
He poked the fire with the same forlorn expression he'd had when looking at Harry's jumper back at the first camp. It was almost physically painful to watch him.
He turned back the pages until he found what he'd been looking for: the first photograph of Harry in the book, taken right after his return from The Hunt. It showed Harry, Draco and the whole Weasley clan in front of The Burrow, knee-deep in New Year's snow.
“Hmhm,” Draco shifted a bit, “incredibly. If only I could have told him. That I'm sorry. That he was a good friend. That I wished things would have gone differently.”
“DON'T!” Death's voice boomed through the Forest and shook the wintry trees. “Not another word, woman! Did we not agree that Master Harry should have a good life for all his efforts? Don't put ideas into his head, you know he has a people saving thing.”
actually love...? That was absurd. Yes, there were some feelings and yes, maybe they were of the romantic kind, but love? Like, real love?
“So, you're saying,” Pansy's voice shook with anger and low fear, “that none of the Hogwarts house-elves can get to that place where our friends are most likely
Half just grinned and rubbed his big nose. “Marshmallows?” He produced a bag of colourful sweets from one of his oversized pockets. “Speaking of which: How do biscuits, chocolate and marshmallows communicate? In s'mores-code!”
At once they were enveloped in the familiar hubbub of The Hunt. Everywhere were people and animals gathered in groups around cheerful little camp fires, laughter and songs filling the air.
Between the Manor's suffocating presence and his parents' tangible absence, it made sense to come back to the one place that had been Draco's second home for years.
It became quickly apparent that no one was actually 'clear' on the rules and everyone seemed to simply do whatever the heck they wanted.
“Okay.” Thomas fidgeted. “I guess you can tell me your progress on Saturdays then. Because Patchers' Quidditch is going to be a weekly thing.”
Cassius rummaged a moment and produced the requested items. It was always interesting how many useful (and diverse) things found space in this boy's pockets.
“Don't do it, Malfoy!” Potter's voice was low and beseeching. “Mabel knows a different way back into the castle, don't you, Mabel?”
Hastily, Draco pulled his legs up and inwardly cursed this whole debacle. Why had he not just taken the route by the Great Hall tonight? Why had he have to run into Potter?
Well, there must have been something in the late supper, because people were behaving strangely all around. Still, Seeker smiled. “Bare face looks good on you, BravestHeart.”
“Ah, does it really though? Maybe it's just everything staying the same while being completely different,” Half grinned. “Don't worry, Seeker. He hasn't caught her in forever. Not since the beginning of our world. And he most likely won't for another eternity.” He winked.
His face turned sober. Even when the memories had faded after that, leaving nothing but the reassurance of his friends, Harry had clung to hope. That's why, when, on the cliffs, he had forgotten about Draco, yet remembered about the possibility of being set free by being called one's name, Harry had known instantly that that blond boy must be the right person, and that he should call Harry's name.
He snivelled and wiped at his face. “Are you an actual idiot? How can you just bare your heart like that when I already turned you down like a hundred times? What's with that foolhardy recklessness?”
A knowing grin. “It is my business to match personalities, Mr. Malfoy, so I'm very good at reading people and
? On our first Christmas as a married couple? As if I would stay at home and cook and clean and raise his twenty children! I despise cooking! It’s like he doesn't know me at all!” She looked about to start crying once more.
“Oh!” Hermione had opened hers and was now ogling at a very generous cheque made out to S.P.E.W. “Oh, Draco, that is wonderful,” she whispered and for the second time this morning she threw herself at Draco.
Since The Hunt's games of Capture The Flag were accumulating, at that moment, about two thirds of forest territory 'belonged' to Seeker's team and should they win today they would gain another body of land.
“Yep, no problem. Hey, good thing you stayed with us, eh? Your plans of leaving The Hunt were really irrational after a–oops! I-I meant,” BraveHeart suddenly stuttered, “I'll better get– yeah, hehe, er, up he goes.” With that he started climbing, abandoning his confused friend.
Wolfe, petting her horse, Binky, looked at him with furrowed brows. “Ember told you – The Hunt doesn't go backwards.”
. That could be forever. If this is meant literally and if wish magic is involved to keep them in place this is more like a curse than anything. At least for those two.”
should not like chess.” He tilted his head up to look at the version of himself. “How about a game of Exploding Snap instead?”
“Ahem.” Right, yeah, they had been in the middle of a conversation. Was that important though, when he could be kissing Draco instead?
“Yes and there are scorch marks from bonfires all over,” Granger chimed in, holding her wand higher to illuminate a wider circle. “And, are those marshmallows?”
Seeker woke with a start. For a moment he was disoriented, but then he remembered. Right, he had left The Hunt and run as deep into the woods as his feet would carry him. Then fog had come up. He hadn't been able to see his own hand before his eyes, yet he had walked on and on until exhaustion had overcome him and he had curled up underneath a tree, falling asleep on the spot.
Harry silently motioned at the table that was currently mid-way through cleaning itself: dust evaporating from the dishes, fresh food appearing and cups filling up with steaming liquids that gave a smell of just-brewed Earl Grey tea.
At that point Draco had suppressed a groan and had just nodded. If Potter had gone cray cray after saving the British wizarding world and needed an ego-boost, who was Draco to deny him a little helper-syndrome fun?
Draco however stayed motionless, his face pale in the darkness. “I did wrong,” he whispered as if to himself. “I'm a wrongdoer, am I not?”
Draco just looked at her silently. This was The Talk then. He had been avoiding too many things for too long.
before, but always with others, never as a solo. Even the odd Hogwarts school song sounded nice with Malfoy singing it.
“Seeker, guess what day it is today?” Half yelled over, wind tousling his red hair in flight. The setting sun in his back gave him a halo.
That was good. Especially after those devastating days in January, following the disastrous encounter with Potter and The Hunt. Draco had been so embarrassed and severely distraught about the fact that he had not been able to free the Chosen One during that occasion that Draco had rolled up in bed and done nothing for the next three days straight, ignoring food as well as numerous letters from the Golden Couple.
“Besides,” the redhead chimed in, “maybe for the wedding we can find you someone as well. You should get out there, start dating.” He wiggled his eyebrows suggestively.
This epilogue ties up many little storylines into a nice bow, garnished with sugar icing and fluff. I really hope you enjoy it.
“Yes. I told you all about the four Hallows and what it entails to own them all. If you're ever in need of the Elder Wand, ask Dumbledore's portrait at Hogwarts for its location and as for the Resurrection Stone...,” he hesitated and gave his godson a stern, non-nonsense look. “Promise me you won't search for it unless it's the absolute last choice. I mean it, Edward!”
“Hunt magic,” the former huntsman answered casually, yet when Draco made a move to back away, Potter grabbed his wrist, while continuing to smile at Ronald.
Remembering Potter's pained look at the unveiling made Draco crack a smile. The Saviour had looked so embarrassed. As a consequence he had proceeded in hiding out at the Quidditch pitch... with Draco as his only company. Somehow, working together during the summer had brought them a smidge closer. Even though Draco would never admit it but maybe, just maybe, he would miss Potter after all. A tiny bit. Only for the banter, of course.
He was also deeply shaken. The woman, the newborn and the man-turned-dog – it was all too much to take in. And hadn't he planned to leave The Hunt as soon as possible? How could he do that, now that he had taken on the task of looking after a bloody
“I like all sorts of mustard,” offered Alice from the head of the table. “Rumour is, the best mustard-mines are on the moon.”
Hermione's mouth snapped open, but Draco, who feared another argument, quickly intervened. “Presents!” he yelled, making the other two flinch. “Time for presents.
There was a single fireplace. It wasn't lit, but that wasn't necessary, for warmth seeped in through the walls from the fires outside and illumination was provided by a net of criss-crossing fairy lights hung up high above their heads.
He had seen their bodies lined up in the Great Hall. He had visited their memorial sites. He had read their names on the plaques many times.
and handed it to Granger. Then she flicked her wand and turned the new envelope Cassius had just given her to a bright pink colour.
Before Harry could react, Draco had shoved the cloak off his head, so that he was now standing partly visible in front of Life and Death. His brows were furrowed and his expression was sour. “If you knew I was here since the beginning, you should have said so. How do you even know my name?”
While Ron behind her strolled down the hallway to examine the many bunny paintings, Hermione's eyes roamed lower and got caught on the carvings on the clock: There was a merperson and a house-elf and then some other creatures she didn't recognise, and also letters. Letters that spelt out the same thing read sinistrograde, over and over, line after line: APPUC A EVAH APPUC A EVAH APPUC A EVAH.
As much as he wished it wasn't true, she was right: Draco had been ignoring Pansy's letters far too long. He'd even put up a complicated hex to destroy any Howlers coming his way before they started howling. Not a nice thing to do; after all, there was still unsolved business between them.
And as if they didn't just have a conversation about life and death and darkness, they returned to chanting spells. But maybe that was the beauty of their current relationship: United they could fall apart and put themselves back together again.
“You could have said so earlier,” Malfoy chided and strode off to the left to try the first door handle. “Bloody hell, it's a trick door!”
“Maybe not. But take it from an old man: Love has always been the strongest magic.” That sneaky old bastard. Like Draco needed metaphors right now. No, thank you.
kind of present.” Another round of laughter. The conversation topic changed and Draco was grateful although he could still feel Harry's scrutinising gaze.
Though I've been thinking what a body is like after a Dementor's Kiss. The body of Dreamer just keeps sleeping (swept over to the side of death by her mother's demise, she would have died if she hadn't travelled with The Hunt, so Harry saved her life), but what happened to e.g. Barty Crouch Jr.? Hmh.
“Unlikely,” Pansy glanced along the rows of grooming birds and then towards the big windows. “There's a storm out tonight, remember?”
Ronald simply furrowed his brows, barely moving out of the way. “Right, sure. Sorry, mate. But how are you not ice on a stick by now with what you're wearing?”
It was an unusually sunny day and Draco, frustrated by the daily dose of non-results, decided to take a walk.
Harry felt a pinch of nostalgia. Even though he'd been part of them mere hours ago, now he was Harry again, not Seeker and he didn't belong here anymore. He looked at Draco who stared wide-eyed at the chaos. Harry belonged with him now. Yes, this was the way it should be.
Finally focusing his attention on his opponent, Queen Harry smiled nastily. “Oh, but you are already the right size. For this.” He waved his hand and Harry had to quickly jump out of the way when a filigree chess board along with corresponding chess pieces appeared on the table between them. It looked like a really old one though, since the usually black pieces were red, something that had long gone out of fashion.
Of course then it hadn't been 'Potter' as they hadn't exchanged names that day. Rather had the scar caught Draco's eye and he had proceeded in calling the interesting stranger 'Scarhead' in his mind – and he kept on doing so to this day, under certain circumstances: It was one of his biggest secrets, but during the awful days when the Dark Lord lived in the Manor and Draco's thoughts were constantly in danger of invasion, he had turned to thinking about Potter as 'Scarhead' to muddy his sentiments.
The Burrow looked exactly like Draco always imagined it: small, crooked and currently overflowing with Christmas decorations. All windows were alight with a warm glow and even through the closed door, Draco could hear the last notes of
Under a dome of miniscule yellow-ish glowing jelly-fish that hung over the village like stars, a cluster of crude stone dwellings stained with algae came into view. There were gardens of weed around some of them, and they even saw a pet Grindylow tied to a stake outside one door. All buildings were circularly arranged around the village square, with a crude sort of statue in the middle, a gigantic merperson hewn from a boulder. Behind it, an arched gateway loomed over the main street.
That had turned out to be true. Moss folk were barely seen during daylight hours. That their team today had five of them was purely because these little guys
“Do you know what date it is? Right, how could you: It's July 31st, his birthday. He's nineteen years old today. Imagine that. Next year I'll know him almost half my life...” Draco quickly looked around and found himself alone with his snakey listener. He pulled his wand from his pocket and started burning little doodles in the sand – a lightning bolt, round glasses, a heart...
Just then, she did indeed begin, her look mild and her speech slow, her body gently rocking to and fro:
He smelled nice. Draco leant closer and nuzzled Harry's neck when they reached the second floor. “Well, here's something that's no secret: I'm rather in love with you.”
). Between the pages was a bookmark in the form of a library card to – his eyebrows shot up – Manor Library. Interesting. Draco would have to tell him about that... and also about the round reading spectacles Harry had just spotted under a little gold-adorned notebook, which he found highly amusing. Wasn't his Draco just the cutest?
Warrington and Ron looked between the two girls, brows furrowed, silently following the exchange of blows.
The castle was full to the brim with people when the four of them stepped into the Entrance Hall. Everyone had come to celebrate the grand re-opening of Hogwarts.
Over this short distance, the rider's raw existence was like a heavy blanket. Berchthold was still oppressing like ringing silence. He was thunder and lightning and yet he was the eye of the storm, most deadly, most powerful. He was doom laced with an unsettling amount of peace and apparently, he'd come alone.
Draco took a deep breath to finally end this lecture, but didn't get a word in, since Granger ploughed on: “Now, the
The newcomer sighed and sat down on the bench, right next to Seeker. “He can speak with your kind, you know? He's a Parselmouth,” said the blond boy, looking down at the serpent.
He was feeling a bit sore, since they had launched into playing the new game Draco had gotten for Greg at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes and they had made the loser of each turn do press-ups and jumping jacks.
out. Things at The Hunt were one big endlessly continuing party. All days were filled with fun and mirth.
It was true that Seeker wanted to return to his former life, whatever that entailed, but the main reason he'd continuously tried to get someone's attention was the prospect of seeing Barn Boy again.
That brought on a smile on that terribly handsome scarred face. “Ha, you wish.” He leered. “But if we're fighting about it anyway, we could just kiss some more?”
The following silence was thick with unpleasant emotions of various kinds. Granger was a bit pale as she finally turned to Draco: “Thank you. Though I don't understand why this was necessary.” Her eyes searching Kreacher's. “You haven't called me a,
Harry let himself be tugged down eventually and in the fire's light, he could finally read the writing printed across the masked boy's grey T-shirt:
This chapter has no Drarry, unfortunately. But the boys will need some back-up to get themselves out of their little mess, so I called the reinforcements.
Harry turned towards the Slytherin common room. Even without his way-too-self-confident portrait's input, he had known where to look for Malfoy. After all, the Marauder's Map had shown him earlier.
These days, the repair works were a welcome distraction for Harry whenever it just felt too much and he already knew that he would come back to finish the last bits, even after school would have started again.
Back in The Hunt, when he hadn't even known his own name, Harry had felt the need to return to Draco after they had met at the barn. Harry's heart had known even before his brain had comprehended. And when Harry, due to Half's tea, had forgotten every last thing about his life, just one look at the Draco constellation had brought back his will to fight on and find that mysterious boy again. Even with exactly zero recollection of Draco Harry had never once wanted anyone else, although there had been ample opportunity. Like when he hadn't wanted to start anything with anyone at the moss folk's masquerade ball.
Harry shook his head. “I even picked a pirate flag thinking of you – of this. You don't need to hide it. It's part of you.”
The days had passed like the landscapes. Snow, fog, hail and the storm The Hunt was constantly surrounded by never dampened the mood of the cheerful ghost party.
He heard them call after him (“You can't leave The Hunt!”), but he didn't look back. He was done with them, once and for all.
And a little trivia! All chapter headings are chapter headings and book titles from the two Alice books. (Some headings are a bit tweaked to fit.)
Eagle, Draco's owl, had not been best pleased about the new family member. Howard, however, had instantly understood that it was way more fun to be served food than to catch it. Eventually this had led to the bird and the feline taking to a tentative friendship which had now evolved into a full-blown acceptance that often found the two of them snuggling on a windowsill during midday.
“I could do with a late night snack,” announced the Weasel, putting an arm around Granger. Right, Potter had mentioned that they were going out now. Weird.
“Potter has to play. He's the one who accepted the challenge,” insisted Queen Harry petulantly and crossed his arms in front of his chest.
Harry lifted his left hand to fumble some more on his stuck fingers, when Malfoy bodily slammed his shoulder into him. “No! Do you want both hands fastened on that thing like me? Merlin, use your head sometime, will you?”
“Yeah, makes sense. That sounded bloody scary when they came down. Honestly, even if he hadn't told us to cover our eyes, I don't think I would have looked, just in case, you know. Good thing he is such a cleverclogs – staying in the middle of the road might have saved him, don't you reckon? According to the lore and all. But,
BraveHeart, mask placed tightly on his face and shoulders hunched, poked gloomily at the flames around which the gang was sitting, uncharacteristically silent. On the side, Dreamer was sleeping in the hollow between Scoffer's curled up legs.
Even more surprising however had been the lack of comment from Holle as she, shortly after departing from the farm, had pulled up next to Lightning and had eyed Harry's foundling with her glowing dog stare for a good long time, before turning her glare to Harry. He'd been sure she would scold him, bark, honk or anything. But she hadn't. She had just gone away, flying on ahead, back to the forefront of The Hunt and had left Harry with a certain feeling of unease.
Pansy waved the comment away. Cassius' sub-bar school performance was widely known in Slytherin. At least he was gifted on a broom. “Neither is Weasley, don't mind it.”
Malfoy was spared the answer as in that very moment, the entrance to the Slytherin common room was opened and revealed one tartan-clad Headmistress in a hair-net.
“Draco...” Harry said slowly into the empty room, tasting the sound with his tongue. Without a doubt, Malfoy had turned into Draco now; there was no reversing it. Still the name felt foreign and Harry's stomach fluttered at remembering how Draco in turn had called him 'Harry'.
“We all walk away on our separate ways and pretend this never happened,” Hermione decreed. “Good night.”
“There you are. Oh, Harry, you look dapper, dear!” Mrs. Weasley got up to hug Harry bone-crushingly tight.
“It's not!” Draco might not admit it point-blank, but he totally loved his new Weasley jumper. The embroidered lettering read
The pictured smiled his goofy smile that the painter had so totally mucked up. “Maybe I've been following him around a bit? I mean, looking is not a crime.” He shrugged.
Half grinned. “It's special-occasions-tea. I snuck these herbs from Berchthold's magical garden in Holle's Pond.” He wiggled his eyebrows. “Don't ask me how I did it, but it surely wasn't easy to get them.” At the others' goggling, he laughed. “Let's just say I have my sources. Cheers – or Na Zdravi as they say here in Czech! To Seeker of The Hunt!”
“Wow, that is beyond awesome, Seeker! He must be so cool! Oh wow, that's so rare! Like one in a million!” BraveHeart's eyes sparkled with excitement.
He wasn't deigned an answer as the Slytherin was delicately checking his shins. Harry watched over Malfoy's shoulder and winced slightly at the unsightly haematomata that covered both the blond's lower legs. “Know any Healing Charms?”
For almost two weeks now, he and the Golden Couple had been chasing traces of and rumours about The Hunt – from one country to the next – with varying success: Sometimes they found people who claimed to have heard this (or seen that; but those were lying time-wasters as Draco knew all too well), other times they found hints that a big group could have camped in the area, but mostly, they returned home disappointed.
Nowadays, to Draco's growing concern, it seemed that he was finding more and more things he and the Weasel had in common. Great, just great.
“Malfoy,” Harry huffed and realised that he was already relaxing. The world was weird these days when meeting Draco Malfoy alone in a dark place made Harry feel safe while being in a well-lit room surrounded by his friends flared his anxiety.
“Yes, but you said she will most probably never wake up again. Wouldn't it be better for her if she, you know, were reborn?” He indicated vaguely towards Holle's Pond.
“I mean, yeah. I was worried, alright? It was in the spur of the moment. Anyway, I guess we better take him back home, maybe to St. Mungo's?”
Fancy parties had never really been his thing and after the war, large crowds always held the potential for over-zealous, well-meaning fans to approach him.
“This is where they kept the hostages,” Potter illuminated, a puny arm gesturing at the sculpture. “They had tied Ron, Hermione, Cho and Gabrielle to the tail.”
“It's not like that or actually... Okay, I admit, I'm confused about him, like, really, really confused. You might not know this, but Ginny and I broke up.” Harry's face grew serious. “At first I was devastated but then I realised that she was right: We make better friends than lovers. We are like pieces of puzzle which, after having been burned and broken, no longer fit.” He rubbed his forehead. “Anyway, she and I are over and ever since, no, maybe even before? God, I don't even know where to start. I'm so unsure. What is it about him?” Harry looked helplessly at his own (slightly distorted) face.
Now, I'll try to upload weekly, but I already know that some of those chapters might get out of hand lenghtwise -.- So, bear with me if my schedule is maybe a bit wonky.
“Yeah, yeah,” sniffed Malfoy haughtily and made a dismissive gesture with his hand. “Everything's got a moral, if only you can find it and the moral of this is:
Malfoy sobered and looked at Harry as if he hadn't seen him all night. “So... not a dream,” he said, stony, his cheeks, pink from laughing, paled slightly.
“Let's get out of here,” whispered his father into his ear after uncharacteristically hugging both, his wife and his son, in his arms. He smelt of sweat, but Draco didn't mind.
A mix of sweet and savoury smells slowly made its way to the forefront of Draco's consciousness. He lifted his gaze and contemplated rifling through the parcel of food.
Gaze roaming on, Harry found a little white dot. As a well-timed coincidence, Hedwig was perched on top of Mug Harry's shoulder. She must have had just delivered something at the moment they'd taken the picture. Harry petted her with his pinky and the owl, as the only one awake on the mug, blinked affectionately at him. What a brave protector she had been to him, what a loyal friend.
Harry shook his head, and the thoughts away. He eyed the board with disdain. “Do you really know the way out?”
“That's... that's amazing, Malfoy! It really works! All my bruises are gone! Look!” A teensy leg with rolled up trousers came dangling in front of Draco's eyes. “Didn't make me bigger, but Merlin, I feel like I've slept for twelve hours. Try it!”
He buried his face into his palms, so he didn't have to look at the other boy. Guilt and shame and the fact that he had just called the boy he may or may not have feelings for by his given name for the first time, all while simultaneously destroying any chance of them to ever be anything at all  – it was all too much. Harry was having a nervous breakdown. Hunched over, he whimpered quietly.
“They totally are, meep! I'm so excited! Isn't this great?” BraveHeart bounced on his heels, but then his expression suddenly changed to determination. “And I'm going to do what I want, too. At least for one night.” With a flowing movement, he ripped off his mask. “This is a masquerade ball after all, where you don't show your face the way you normally do. I'm going maskless tonight.”
“Bloody hell indeed. How on earth did you get over here? I just watched you go through that opening over there.”
“Already did that. Well, sort of,” Pansy informed her friend and the other witch backed down. Pansy had always been an authority figure.
“People do believe the wildest stories, don't they? The power of imagination is so strong in some, even living humans sometimes make it to the pond,” Wolfe shrugged, cringing as her hands carefully felt for Half's masterpiece on her head.
“Oh no, we had nothing to do with that. We were just as surprised as you that you could remember him. Though, to be clear, it wouldn't have worked if you didn't love him,” Death said bluntly, making Draco sputter and Harry's heart flutter, “or vice versa.” This time, it was Harry's turn to blush.
told me to shower.” Completely unfazed, the intruder went to dig through Draco's wardrobe as if... as if it was
Harry'd been right about the raw talent of the late artist, Draco had to give him that. Too bad really that they would have to cast a Disillusionment Charm on the image so that no one but Draco and Harry could see it. After all, they could not give the gang's secret away like that; people would put two and two together eventually.
