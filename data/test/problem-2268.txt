"Blue Jay is that meant to be an insult Draco?" Harry asked making Draco raise an eyebrow at him. Harry for his part was a little shocked as he had meant to call him Malfoy like he normally did only for it to come out as Draco.
"Very well take the third door from the left, follow the corridor taking two lefts, a right, and finally enter the fifth door on the left-hand side," Grindstone said understanding the man's problem with Hogwarts's Medi-Witch as the Goblins having been consulted, as they were with each new hire at Hogwarts, had not wanted to give her the job. That did not stop Albus though as rather than using the normal Hogwarts vaults to hire the woman he had used his own vaults to hire her before he added her to the plan to be paid from the Hogwarts vaults for working at the Magical School.
"Well in here with me of course but if that is too much too soon we can set you up with your own room next door," Draco said giving the smaller boy's hand a gentle squeeze.
"I am Harridan Potter-Prince a submissive Veela and I just wish to have a quiet life," Harridan said leaning against his Mate.
"Not that I am complaining but what was that for?" Draco asked after Harry pulled away from the kiss.
"Yeah I guess it would be strange for any friends you have to accept an invitation from me, so we will just have to get my Dad to add you to the wards so you can send and receive mail through the wards," Draco said.
Harrison stayed talking with Draco and Luna in the library until lunchtime since Ron had believed him about taking a shower until then due to wearing Draco's robes to breakfast. Having gotten to know Luna he trusted her observations on Ron and Ginny but was going to pretend to still like them at least until they got off the train in London the next day. As Draco had only sent the message to his aunt and cousin that morning a plan was hatched in case they did not show up at Platform 9 3/4 where Harrison wearing the medallion from Draco would go home with Luna until it was all sorted out. Draco having mentioned that his cousin, a woman by the name Nymphadora Tonks who he said to just call Tonks, had just finished her first year as an Auror and would be able to help Harrison in matters of getting dosed by potions. While Draco and Luna were helping him out Harrison had not told them about his meeting with Sirius or the man's innocence not wanting to put them or his Godfather in any hot water.
"Does that mean that when I am free of the bed I will have to go the bathroom like Tom Hank's character does from A League of Their Own?" Harry asked.
Snape showed Harry multiple scenes of his "battles" with James and his friends which all came to a head at the end of Snape's Fifth Year, at least as far as Harry could tell due to the O.W.L.s test that Snape showed him. "This is one of my worst memories from school," Harry's Snape said as he showed an altercation with the Marauders in which Lily tried to rush to his aid. Harry could not help but gasp as he saw the young Snape call his Mother a Mudblood which caused tears to form in her eyes as she ran away leaving Snape to the mercy of James and Sirius.
Harrison moved to the properties listed as cottages and felt they were more his size. The first one he checked on was known as Evens' Haven which contained four bedrooms, a small library, two main bathrooms as well as one bathroom that was attached to one of the bedrooms, and a kitchen. The place only had two elves in residence, but it was the history that had caught his eye. According to the history of the place, it had been a gift from his dad to his mom when he started to court her so that she would not have to live at home while she worked on earning her Master's in Charms. So far this property looked the best but he wanted to make sure of something first. "Where exactly did my parents live before they died?" he asked.
"I second the motion to expel this Hermione Granger," Agustus said tapping her cane of office on the floor.
"Now see here Harry does not need to do anything from that," Molly Weasley said interposing herself between Tonks, Harrison, and the fireplaces.
"That is amazing you took down the man singled-handed, well wand, whatever," Granger said. "What spells did you use?"
"Yeah, but what new understanding did you gain mate?" Ron asked. Harry was glad he had a ready lie as he talked about Snape giving him the book that allowed him to finally learn to use Occlumency successfully.
"Agreed, we shall all check to see if our students have all the books that they need. I shall talk to the rest of the staff so they can ask about their classes for missing text that they had assigned," Minerva said. "Now is there any other new business?'
Harridan and his friends have some private celebrations over the twins' victory against the Fletchers
"Are you sure?" Harry asked making Draco give him a small glare "Alright you are. Sorry I did not mean any offense but those two were written with the help of Hermione."
"Oh Neitherworld's Great Arch," Mr. Malfoy said. "I don't know what is worst that the person who was sent to help you get your supplies was the Groundkeeper or the fact that you are missing almost half your books for your classes. Can you tell me who you had been living with Heir Potter?"
Lucius goes to see if he needs a Cleansing, though he does not think so.  While Harry's unconscious state is a mystery to Narcissa and the Healers at St. Mungos.
Not sure how much work the Goblin had left Charity began to give Harry a more full account of the Hogwarts Houses.  Thus Harry learned that while Ravenclaw was the House of the knowledge it did not just mean knowledge that came from books but from life experiences, street smart, or just a thirst for any type of knowledge one could get their hands on.  As a former Ravenclaw herself she also explained why the House had raven in its name but its animal mascot was an Eagle, though made him promise not to spread it around.  For Hufflepuff Charity let him know that the House was not just a place to make friends it was seen as a place of quiet contemplation saying that while Ravenclaw could be seen as the Mind Hufflepuff was the Heart of Hogwarts.  Charity also corrected a lot of the negative information on Slytherin House letting him know that it was not a House of evil as some like the Headmaster said it was but was actually as a place of healing that focused on both mind and body.  Continuing the analogy she called Slytherin the actual Soul of the school as Harry thinking along those lines inwardly classified Gryffindor as the muscle or strength from the year he lived in the House.  Well, it would have been if not for the actions during the last part of his First-Year and the incident with Norbert where the House turned against Neville, Hermione, and him.  At that moment the House had acted harsher towards him than even Slytherin had done at that point, though technically during that time it was the Slytherins who had not turned against him.
"My pleasure Lord Malfoy," Bonecrusher said with a look that said he guessed what Lucius had had to deal with when he had been out of the bank.
"Your right we should tell her like right now," George said standing up and making it to the door only to be joined by everyone else just a moment later.
"I understand perfectly Mister Goblin," Charity said making the Goblin give her a small nod of approval.
It was Blaise who answered it as the twins also looked confused as he poked the word Blocked behind Lupin's name. "It is due to this someone blocked Professor Lupin from the family line the only reason we can actually see it is due to it being impossible to block in this test."
"And are you two willing to take part in this Duel?" she asked turning to Ron and Ginny who were still sitting at the table.
"I guess to find out who is sending him would be the first step but I don't want to do anything else if he is just doing what he is doing under orders," Harrison said.
"Well a person with a Gray Core, is good with both Potions and Transfiguration such as Professors McGonagall and Snape," Narcissa said giving Harry a smile.
"It is not something I spread around for while my Ancestors was great my most recent family not so much," she said.
"But we also want to keep quiet about it so we thought the best way to do it was to get all the students, Muggleborn, Half-Blood, and Purebloods, tested as well," Severus said causing Bonecrusher to almost faints.
"What do I care I am happy now and those who would act differently to me are not worth my time. It might also work to get people to stop thinking I am a spoiled little Princeling from how I was raised. Though I guess with my Papa I am a Prince," he added with a small laugh.
As his mom seemed to have used her personal office fireplace to set up the Floo connection she and Draco heard a scream coming from the Ward where she worked. Mentally crossing her fingers in the hope the scream was due to what she thought it was she and Draco ran towards the Ward. With each step, he took closer to where he had last seen Harry and his mom before she had shown up at Hogwarts the unnatural feeling in his chest seemed to lessen. "Healer Malfoy thank Merlin you are back it is a miracle, Harry just sat up in bed fully awake," one of the Healers said as Draco and his mother entered the room.
Also around this time, Snape was informed that due to him in his position of Stewart for the Most Ancient and Noble House of Black was responsible for the recapture of Sirius he the reward had been added to his accounts. Severus had the money placed in his son's Vaults to add to the money that the Goblins had already returned to him that the man had stolen from him. The twins were also informed that thanks to their suggestion to go to Gringotts Arthur had found out that he had been under numerous enchantments from Molly as well as finally fully claiming both his Lordship and Consort rings for both Weasley line and Lupin line respectfully. It seems that Molly had some spell making him forget he was the Lord of the most Devious and Magical House Weasley leading her to take great sums of money from the vaults of the House. Remus and Arthur stated that they were currently working with the Lupin-Weasley Account manager, Sabersnake, into actions to take on the witch. The pair of reunited mates also congratulated the boys not only for finding someone but for bringing the truth to their attention.
"That is another thing it seems that young Miss Hermione came to Hogwarts under an assumed name for her results showed that she had a Glamour placed on her from her mother who is Dolores Umbridge," he explained. Hearing this a look of shock comes to everyone's faces as even Minerva votes to expel the girl for her actions. Having reached a unanimous decision Drake uses his position to summon Hermione Umbridge right to them as well as the girl's mother. As this was being done Severus adjust his Prince Lordship ring activating the Porktey and hopefully sending the boys to Gringotts to get a full Cleaninsing if not more.
"And then there was the last term where she entered the Champions only area multiple times which could have lead to some international problems if the other schools thought she was passing on information to either Harridan or Cedric from you. But what is even more disturbing is a report that had been buried from shortly at the end of the last school year after the Durmstrang Students returned to their school. It seems that their School Healer gave each of the returning students a check-up to make sure they had not picked up anything from their visit. The Healer found something when he examined Champion Krum," Lucius said looking right at Albus who was still shifting awkwardly in his seat.
The silence in the room lasted nearly ten minutes before Snape used his wand to summon a book. "As you complain that I am not teaching you how to perform Occlumency this book should help," Snape said passing over a book entitled: Blocking One's Mind, a Beginners Guide to Occlumency. "I want you to read the whole book before our next lesson Harry. The book has multiple ways one can block out others from looking through their mind we can only hope one of which you can use. And while it is earlier than normal we can call it quits for tonight," Snape said. Harry was shocked by the statement thinking if anything it would have been later for they had been at it for an hour before Snape had let Harry see his memories, but looking at his watch Harry was surprised to see it was only an hour and a half after the lesson had started. As Harry walked back to Gryffindor Tower he reasoned that watching the memories from Snape had gone faster than he had thought it had been for it had felt like a couple of hours not thirty minutes.
"Stop the access to the funds, get as much as you can back and can I get a new key or something? I would also like to cancel any Marriage Contracts unless it is mentioned in my parents' Wills which I check into later. Please get Shell Cottage back since there was no proper authority to pass it on in the first place," Harrison said as the Goblin Account Manager made a note of Harrison's wishes.
"That is perfectly alright as long as you are happy," Harrison said earning him a look of approval and joy from the three Elves.
"What do you want? Whatever your selling I am not buying," a large beefy man said answering the door.
"Fine since no one else has shown up and it is you we shall start at the beginning," Draco said with his normal sneer "so take out your book and turn to page five."
"That is actually quite a good question, but once again I can not answer it.  Your Account Manager just informed me that since I came to remove you from your bad situation without any thoughts of reward Batty and I would be given custody of you until we can all find a more suitable situation for you," Charity explained.
"Well that is alarming," the Goblin said looking over the note. "And you did this all by yourself?" he asked.
"That name is a lie," Lucius said in anger "spread by Albus and his gang of self-righteous fuckers." The man looked like he was working himself up for a rant before Draco's Mom placed a hand on his forearm.
"Very well, if you think of any do not hesitate to ask for Ritualsist such as myself love to explain, or as some say it hear our voices," Elmblossom said with a laugh as they pulled out a roll of parchment, a small scythe, a cutting of wood, and a pitcher of some sort of greenish-pink liquid. "The ritual is quite simple Heir Potter, I will use the scythe to make a small cut in your non-wand hand's palm to add a few drops of your blood to the Summoning Solution. You will then stir the solution and your blood with the cutting from Yggdrasil, or world tree while I speak the chant that accompanies this ritual in Old Gobbledegook. Once I am done I will give you a sign to pour the Summoning Solution onto the roll of parchment,
"That is right Blue Jay," Fred teased making Draco growl at him for using his pet name for his mate while Blaise grabbed the redhead harshly by the back of his neck until he apologized.
After his demonstration Kingsley had Harridan explain what he had been thinking about while he cast the spell. Harridan blushed a little making something up about him just spending time with Draco, rather than the truth of his first night at Malfoy Manor when he had cuddled into the Dominant Veela's strong chest wearing some of Draco's old sleepwear having no chance to get some new ones yet. Not that Harridan had got any new sleep clothes yet preferring his Mate's old ones to any they found in any of the stores they had visited over the summer. Draco gave him a knowing smile as if knowing he was not telling the full truth before trying to cast the spell again. This time just like Harridan a corporeal Patronus bust from his wand in the shape of a large falcon who flew around the room and landed on Harridan's shoulder, something that leads to the blonde gaining twenty-five points.
"I would normally say yes, it would be a student to determine if they are turning in their work using proper sources rather than trust their fellow students. But I think using the Tracking Spell will help this, but it will also show that if students work together in either homework or class projects are doing the same amount of work so that we can grade them appropriately," Severus explained.
"So not only did both of our parents come for the trip to Gringotts all our real siblings came as well, even Percy who had a large fight with Dad at the start of last summer."
At lunch, Harrison took a seat next to Hermione and spent the meal talking with her doing his best to ignore Ron sitting on his other side and Ginny sitting across from him giving him what he assumed were flirtatious looks. With classes being done, Harrison decided to ask Hermione about her self realizing he did not really know much about her apart from her love of books and near-perfect memory. She seemed pleased as she answered his questions. Thus he was able to hear about her first bit of accidental magic had come from a group of bullies playing keep-away with one of her books and one of them nearly tossing it into a giant mud puddle. Her parents working together in a dentist's office with her dad being her mother's hygienist, and both their jobs allowing the family to go on vacations out of the country each year. Harrison also learned much to his surprise that Hermione was not an only child like he had thought but had an old sister named Elizabeth age 16, and a younger brother Al age eleven. She was just the only one of them who had the talent for magic. Hearing about her siblings and thinking of Dudley, Harrison asked her if either of them bullied her for having magic when they did not. She laughed and put his mind at ease telling him that neither of her siblings had treated her any different after learning she could do magic. Not that she hung out with them, she told him, for her sister was more of a preppy girl who cared more about fashion than studying, while her brother was more focused on learning to play the trumpet with dreams of being in a jazz band. Harrison was so fascinated by the stories she told him he had not even realized that the majority of the people in the hall had left after lunch had been over.
"Well as I said earlier you should have had a form that let you know about your medical exam taking place in the first week, as well as request for medical history," Mr. Malfoy said as he pulled out Harry's Booklist. "What in Merlin and Morgan's shared hairbrush is going on. This is your full list correct Heir Potter?"
"What was that Potty?" Draco asked arching one of his eyebrows at him making the butterflies in Harry's stomach seemed to shift into a tornado.
Harry turned and pressed his left palm to the Alpha's cheek.  "Draco, I am not even fourteen yet and you can't be that much older I don't think we could do it. But thanks anyway," Harry said.
"This is a disgrace," Mr. Malfoy said, "you are rather lucky my wife did not come with you. As a fully registered Healer, she would have torn you a new one. According to this you basically gave my son only a Dreamless Sleep Potion," the man said reaching over and lifting the bedsheet on his son revealing a swollen ankle before he had Draco lift his shirt a little showing off a deep purple bruise. Mr. Malfoy then used a summoning spell to call for some potions and had his son drink them making the bruise shrink a little. A third potion was applied directly to the swollen ankle causing it to return to normal size. "Now based on what you "missed" with my son let's see if you failed to notice anything with Heir Potter," the man said turning his wand on Harry who did his best not to flinch. Harry felt nothing as the spell was cast on him, not even a slight breeze that he had come to associate magic being cast on him. Harry's breakfast arrived before the results of the spell started to print out, but as the results printed Draco, the Matron and Mr. Malfoy's faces fell as they turned pale. "Have you never scanned Heir Potter before?" Mr. Malfoy asked as the results continued to print from his wand.
"So you treat me like shit due to how my Dad acted towards you but want to apologize for sending Voldemort after my parents not due to him killing my Dad but because he killed my Mom," Harry said unable to stop a bit of scorn out of his voice and noticed Snape actually flinched.
"Well a normal tutoring session at Hogwarts is anywhere from a Knut to a Sickle and I usually go for just two Knuts for helping but with the book I can lower it to a Knut," Draco said.
"No what is best is for her to do her job correctly but as it seems she can not I will stand by Lucius's decision to have her removed from her post," Vansel said simply. "Now there is another issue that we need to discuss."
"Well that complicates things," Harry said unable to think of how he could ask any of his teachers to have him look for it in the library.
"Very good Heir Malfoy-Riddle does Heir Potter-Prince agree?" the Goblin asked in a gentle voice looking at Harridan
With the boost of his confidence from the kiss and showing off his new Patronus to Draco, Harry felt he was ready to show the D.A. how to cast a Patronus. Since he was not really talking to his former friends he had not shared with them, or anyone else his lessons plans for the meeting of the D.A. Before their meeting began Harry passed on, the message Draco had told him, about Umbridge was about to start using truth potions to try to find out about any underground groups such as theirs. Telling them to watch out if the woman offered them any form of liquid. Though telling them to fake drinking the item before getting rid of it somehow. To raise their spirits after passing on the news that the Umitch was hunting them in such a way he informed them of the spell they were going to be working on that night. Hearing it was the Patronus many people cheered having wanted to learn to cast it since it had been brought up during the meeting in the Hogs Head.
There was silence between Granger, Draco, and Longbottom as they got Potter upright and secured between Granger and Longbottom's shoulders, Draco still being too weak at the moment to do the job of carrying the unconscious boy as he limped after the group. Once they reached the Hogwarts grounds proper Draco saw Hagrid drop his crossbow and pull out a large pink umbrella, the oaf sent Draco a look before he aimed the umbrella at the castle and cast a spell that shot a white orb to one of the towers. "Well just wait here," the oaf said keeping a firm grip on Quirell.
"Not really, but it is nothing I can get into now," Harry said looking around as if to say it was the location which was the reason for his reluctance to talk about it. Both his best friends nodded in understanding making him grateful for it before Ron informed him that he had missed Snape outing Remus as a werewolf to everyone.
"When I turned back to help Heir Potter," Draco said adding the Heir since no member of staff seemed to be able to do it, "Professor Quirrell threw me into a tree hard. I did manage to get up and while he was unable to reach me again the impact was painful. Plus a little earlier I sort of scared Heir Longbottom who started and caused me to trip over a root, which I think caused the start of a sprained ankle," Draco said. Outside in the corridor, Neville blushed a little not realizing that he might have hurt Draco from the other's prank to him.
Professor Dumbledore then took out his wand and cast a Diagnostic Charm on Quirrell. "Madam Pomfrey a second opinion if you would?" Professor Dumbledore asked as he looked over Quirrell's results. The Medi-Witch did as asked as she cast a spell on her passed-out co-worker.
"Why not you are a nice person, even if you call yourself a Queen of Gossip, and loyal to your friends. Just look at how easily you accepted, Harridan, Fred, George, Neville, and myself even though we came from other Houses. Something I might add some in my own House never took the time to do," Luna said. Hearing this Pansy could not help but wrap her arms around the younger girl's waist.
"But I thought you had to get some of my blood?" Harry asked confused turning his left palm towards him and seeing it looked like it normally did.
"Thanks, Draco," Harry said tucking himself under Draco's chin as the blonde easily lift him up and carries him over to the bed.  After the events of the day, Harridan had fallen asleep before he was set onto the king-sized mattress making Draco coo a little at him as he used his wand to change Harridan into his sleep clothes before he joined his Mate in the bed giving Harridan a kiss to his scar before he joined the other in sleep.
"Don't worry my Lions I can help," Blaise said as he took out his wand and touched their House badge making it return to just the Lion before he gave both of the twins a kiss to their cheeks.
"A pleasure," she said as she let him go causing him to shake his hand for a moment to get some feeling back into it. After his hand felt back to normal again Harry reached into his robes and pulled out Draco's cloak and handed it back to the Alpha thinking it would not be a problem even if Draco left him alone with Luna if she was his cousin, which means she was most likely Sirius's as well and would not give off a bad scent. "Draco, be a dear and see if the library has a book on Harry's family history," Luna said dismissing the blonde Alpha so she could talk to Harry alone.
It was thanks to the teachers, and their notes of the Harridan and Draco actions while apart, as well as Snape and Lucius sharing their test results listing them as mates to the School Board that finally got the pair of Veelas into their shared rooms as well as changing Harridan's scheduled, as the submissive partner, to that held by Draco. Which as Draco took some classed he did not give Harridan some extra break periods since both his mates and Snape's suggestion dropped Divination. With the board deciding in their favored Harridan moved out of Ravenclaw Tower and into one of the Mated Dorms of Slytherin House. He also noticed his robes had changed as the Ravenclaw symbol had changed from just a Raven in flight to the bird in what appeared to be sitting in a nest. Only when one looked closer was it able to see the nest was actually a serpent wrapped protectively around the bird's feet.
"That did not look like you were brewing you seemed to be going over homework," Snape said with a sneer.
"Well it is usually done for students who have found that the Houses they had been put into no longer fits them and with you being Mated to young Heir Malfoy people would assume you to try to get into the same house as him," Remus said as the twins nodded.
"They would have been removed as your Guardians and other candidates would have been found," Bonecrusher said. "The Goblin Nation would never allow such artifacts to remain in the hands of thieves if either of them had not signed off of the ritual they would have faced Goblin Justice for possibly being complicit in what had been done to you." This news made Harry breathe a sigh of relief for not only had the pair of Professor pass the test but it would be the first step in setting things right.
"From what I read it is a signal of the presence of a Life Debt. You saving Harry's life from Quirrell connected you," Granger said.
," Harry said making his ring flash for a moment. "Did I do it right?" Harry asked after a moment when nothing happened apart from the flash.
"As thanks for resuing my client earlier today, the Goblin Nation has declared both you and Madam Burbage as Harrison's Magical Guardians until he either comes of age or Godparents is available to take over the role," Bonecrusher explained. Unlike Charity, Bathsheda was a Half-Blood so knew exactly what sort of responsibility was being placed on her shoulders. "And now since we are all here I need you both to perform your first official duty as his Guardians we need your permission to perform a Blood Artifact Retrieval," Bonecrusher said passing over a form to the two Hogwarts Professors. Harry for the moment was worried wondering what would happen if either or both of them refused for him to take part in the ritual thinking of everything listed that had been taken from him,
"In a way, but I also wanted to meet you after all as I said you are famous in our world, and I have heard so much about you from the Weasleys. I would beware of Ginny if I was you she fancies that she will one day be your wife. Not that that could happen now that you have presented, but as she thinks of me as an airhead she has talked about brewing some love potions to give to you," Luna said.
"Well then hello to you both and thank you for taking care of a member of my family," Tumbus said performing their earlier gesture again. "So Master Potter how may I be of service?"
"Come on for all we know the thing could belong to a Mini-Death Eater and has been used to handle tainted dark objects," Ron said.
"Too bad Lucius always had high hopes for you," the unseen speaker stated as the shadow turned from Potter and started to approached Draco.
"Well, apart from dropping Divinatons I also left Muggle Studies. Don't tell Ron but he had been right about the pointlessness of the class, but not because I was a Muggleborn, but the class itself which from what was taught had not been upgraded since somewhere around the 1940s. If you asked me one of the first lessons they should have taught was dressing," she said with a slightly mad laugh.
"Well as a Submissive Veela your Allure would only work on me to calm me down if I went into Berserk Mode if someone was to attack you," Draco said reaching over and patting Harry's hand. "It is only a Dominant Veela whose Allure can affect other people."
"Well and at the end of the last school year when I witnessed the Dark Lord rise again your father arrived to greet him," Harry said.
"Um sure. I would also check to see if Granger is doing that in any other classes you have with her," Draco suggested.
The next thing Harry knew his pain had started to vanish as Draco pulled him into a tight hug. Harry wanted to fight it not really liking the other but found his body seemed to act on its own as it curled into Draco's warm embrace. "There, there Little One everything is alright now you are safe," Draco said his voice sounding nice and warm and holding none of the scorn or uppity attitude that Harry was used to. Harry found the voice and the warmth of the other's body to be rather comforting as he soon found himself drifting off to sleep.
Draco allowed Luna and the twins to join him and Harridan in their compartment as they waited for the others. Due to arriving so early it was almost a hour before the others arrived to find Harridan leaning into Draco napping as the others played a de-powered game of Exploding Snap so as not to wake him. When Pansy and Blaise came in and they moved to make room Harridan did finally wake up giving the pair greetings which they returned. When Neville and Theo showed up the whole group was surprised to find them holding hands. Neville explained that after their first meeting the pair had gotten to get to know each other since they both came from similarly bad homes. Neville with his borderline abusive extended family and Theo's father who was the worst type of Death Eater that, until Theo had run away to his Grandparents, had been getting close to sexually abusing him. Which due to his Angle inheritance would have lead to him never finding a Mate and losing his wings or possible death. As Theo shared this Neville pulled the taller boy into his lap and cuddled up with him.
"Hello, Grindstone," Mr. Malfoy said after he flicked his eyes to the nameplate on the desk, "I have come to see about having a Hogwarts student undertaking an Inheritance Test."
"Well they would not have been able to make it through the Malfoy-Riddle Manor Wards without Dad's approval and only letters from or for the Goblins are allowed to be delivered within Gringotts so this is their first chance at delivering the letter to you," Draco explained.
"Well it does not really matter anyway," Dumbeldore said pulling out his wand and before either man or Draco could do anything hit them with a powerful stunning spell blasting all three backward over beds, chairs, or anything that was between them and a solid wall. Albus then began to whistle tunelessly to himself as he approached all three stunned males and began to manipulate their minds removing any knowledge they had of him enchanting his weapon. Seeing a perfect opportunity the old man also implanted ideas into Lucious's head to make him act more like the Death Eater most already thought he was. Albus had no fear of his spell being discovered just like the charm he had placed on former Minister Bagnold that made her start handing out harsh punishments to any suspected Death Eaters, with Dark Cores while at the same time turning a blind eye to his Order of the Pheonix. He, unfortunately, could not get them to rehire Poppy due to it being Hagrid of all people to raise the latest issue with her which had lead to their investigation.
"Well a normal tutoring session at Hogwarts is anywhere from a Knut to a Sickle and I usually go for just two Knuts for helping but with the book I can lower it to a Knut," Draco said.
"That is amazing you took down the man singled-handed, well wand, whatever," Granger said. "What spells did you use?"
Thinking he could use some fresh air Harry left the castle for the Quidditch Pitch to fly around for a bit. He was soon joined by the Weasley twins and Ron, using a school broom, and the four had a pickup game where they were soon joined by other members of the various House teams. The best part, at least in Harry's opinion, was due to them all flying around he was unable to take in anyone's scent during the game male or female. The game only broke up at lunchtime as everyone headed inside to eat and relax for a bit.
Seeing Ron was still distracted Harry went over and talked to the girls to see if either of them would go with Ron. Both girls brook out into giggles making Harry wish such a gesture was illegal for what it could do to someone making him glad Harry could not hear their response. "Why doesn't he has Hermione?" Lavender asked.
"I am through his father's side which would mean that you gain your secondary gender through the Black family," Luna said standing from her chair and moving as far away as she could while remaining in sight and speaking distance of him. "That does mean that if my father and I would move in or check up on you, you would have to be presented with a gift from Draco."
"You do realize the test was just letting you know what creature you would become not that you can transform into it at the present time right?" Draco said leaning down and giving the other a kiss to the top of their head.
Harrison had just started his second sandwich when Charity and Bathsheda returned and took a seat at the table. "It almost feels like we are on a picnic," Charity said as she took a peanut butter and banana sandwich and summoned the pitcher of lemonade. She had taken the first bite of her sandwich before she almost dropped it.
"Mind, we would love it if you came to live here Master Potter," the suited Elf said as the pair smiled up at him as Harrison took in the better grammatical usage this one used compared to Dobby.
"Hello, Lady Baddling thank you for coming," Bonecrusher said standing from his desk and shaking her hand which only made the woman look even more confused.
"Thanks, Papa," Harridan said shocking Snape as it was the first time his son had called him anything other than Professor or just plain Snape.
"But what about Professor Lupin if all this was true about Werewolves why would he support Headmaster Dumbledore?" Harry asked thinking he had found a hole in their arguments.
"I don't have my own place, having taken up residence at the castle since I started teaching," Charity said rubbing the back of her neck.
"What is it, Severus?" Minerva asked as Severus tried not to grit his teeth at the witch. For while she was a good teacher, the fact that she had basically ignored James, Sirius, Remus bullying him when he was a student, and now had no issue with him "bullying" Potter, and Longbottom just due to it being under Albus's orders.
"Harrison will need to be under Nutritional Pottions for the next month but I was only given a week's supply," Charity explained.
"Well as I said earlier you should have had a form that let you know about your medical exam taking place in the first week, as well as request for medical history," Mr. Malfoy said as he pulled out Harry's Booklist. "What in Merlin and Morgan's shared hairbrush is going on. This is your full list correct Heir Potter?"
"And you did it nicely unlike my relatives who treat me like a House Elf," Harry said shifting his body so that his legs were under him and his face was in Draco's chest.
When Harry woke up he found himself looking into an unfamiliar ceiling. Only after sitting up and putting on his glasses did he realize he was in the Hospital Wing. Having never really had a reason to come to the room yet he looked around seeing a very sterile and bland room filled with curtains, beds, and similar side tables. The room's setup reminded him a little of Privat Drive and all the cookie-cutter houses on a street for each bedded area looked exactly like the others in the room. With one exception, the bed right next to Harry was occupied by Draco Malfoy who was sitting up and eating from a tray. "What happened?" Harry asked trying not to blush as he recalled the vision he had experienced and how it had ended with him curled up in Draco's lap.
"Earlier this day said client found evidence of his money being embezzled and your account was mentioned," the man said.
"Yes he did pass, but if father and I come to see him you would need to gift him with something for he seems to have presented due to the Black family," Luna said moving closer now that Draco's scent was holding hers at bay.
"When I turned back to help Heir Potter," Draco said adding the Heir since no member of staff seemed to be able to do it, "Professor Quirrell threw me into a tree hard. I did manage to get up and while he was unable to reach me again the impact was painful. Plus a little earlier I sort of scared Heir Longbottom who started and caused me to trip over a root, which I think caused the start of a sprained ankle," Draco said. Outside in the corridor, Neville blushed a little not realizing that he might have hurt Draco from the other's prank to him.
"We know you better than that Pans," Harridan said with a chuckle. "As you said you still hold her hand and sit next to her when you can so everyone already knows you are close. After all, it is up to you who knows about your relationship."
"How long was Ronald sent away for this time?" Harry asked digging his fingers into so as to give his Mates' feet a deep tissue massage.
Vernon almost got pulled over for speeding multiple times as he drove them home due to his anger at the freak. Making a vow to beat the boy within an inch of his life the next time he saw him Vernon finally pulled into the driveway of #4. As the garage was full of some of Dudley's old possessions as well as a boat he had been working on the group left the car and made their way up to the front door wondering what a page was doing on their door. Petunia thought it was a notice for the next H.O.A. meeting since she had not been home to have it handed to her directly. Reaching the door before he unlocked it Vernon tore off the note and unfolded it his face going red as he was it was an eviction notice giving them twenty-four hours to leave the building with anything they wanted to take with them otherwise deal with the law. "Petunia?" Vernon asked through gritted teeth looking at his beloved wife.
Narcissa and the rest of her colleagues were running out of ideas. Ever since Harry had passed out nearly an hour and a half ago they had tried to find out the reason for what had happened to the young man. Their first theory was that it was a resurgence of whatever had caused Harry to slip into the Magical Coma the night before brought about by the potions he had drunk. Yet after an hour of testing, they found no evidence that was the case. The group's next theory was that one of the magical illnesses that Harry had been subjected to had actually surged while his body took in the potion to protect him from an altogether different illness. A quick Diagnostic Charm put that one to the bed as well. Their third idea was some sort of Magical Exhaustion due to Narcissa having shared he had just gone through cleansing and now with his body undergoing multiple inoculations at the same time. To find of if this was the case they had to call in a Healer from another department who had a talent in reading a person's Magical Core to see how much of a strain it was under. When the Healer arrived a special ritual had to be performed to allow her to detect Harry's core through the Wards around his bed only for them to find out that Harry's Core while recovering from being blocked for so long was perfectly fine.
"Why would the Hogwarts library have a book on my family? Does it have books on all Pureblood families?" Harry asked as Draco left them alone.
"Ah yes sorry about that," Lucius said collecting himself as he straightened his robes. "The name Lord Voldemort is a lie that Tom came up with to hid what he was really doing from the likes of Albus."
As the blonde had not made fun of him yet Harry passed over his first homework from the year which was also one of the few that he had a rough draft of. Harry could not go back to the book as he watched Draco read his two pages over. After just a minute Draco dug out his quill and began to mark on the parchment which Harry had actually handed in. "Potty, no Potter I don't know how to tell you this but Granger is sabotaging your work," Draco said and as it to prove his point pushed both parchments over to him.
Draco woke up the next morning from his sound sleep to the sound of a shout from his roommates.  As his body woke up fully he became aware of something really snuggled up to his chest.  Blinking the sleep out of his eyes Draco looked down only to see Harry Bloody Potter asleep curled up against him.  Though the scent he had been smelling was coming off his messy-haired rival Draco could not stop himself from calling out, "Bloody Hell Potter what are you doing here?  While Harry had not shown signs of being awake before that moment hearing Draco's voice caused his eyes to shot open in alarm.  Harry immediately pulled away from his face to take on a startled look as he fell off the edge of the bed.  Draco could not help but wince as he heard the other crash to the floor, but to his shock made no sound of pain from it.
"Ah you have had dreams of me before Blue Jay that makes me glad," Draco said as he steps forward and to Harry's shock pulls him into a hug tucking Harry under his chin.
"Well, we found who had been attacking the Unicorns," Hagrid said as he drops Quirrell to the ground at his feet. Draco was secretly proud at the strength of the stunner he had cast since the man was still unconscious.
"More like screamed it actually right in front of everyone in the Great Hall actually," Ginny said doing her best not to smile having found the sight somewhat funny, if only it had been someone else other than her brother.
"Well she always was a know-nothing-know-it-all," Harry said having no sympathy for his old friend for finding herself on the wrong side.
"Well for one thing if you wish you could claim an Heir room especially since you are actually in the House of your Ancestor," Minerva explained. "Other than that since you are not of age you can choose your representative to sit on the School Board to cast the vote on how the school is being run."
"I am telling the truth my Blue Jay I can not lie to you unless I am doing it to protect you my Veela will not allow it," Draco said
"Well, then the party is needed more than I thought," Draco said as in his mind began to list everything and everyone that should come. "And we can do it to celebrate our mateship my friends can meet your," Draco suddenly stopped as he realized that besides the Weasel and Mudblood Harridan had never hung out with anyone at Hogwarts.
Yet while Snape and Lily being friends despite their different Houses Harry's Father and the future Potion's Master seem to be unable to get along at all. Having heard that the pair were rivals he had expected something akin to his previous relationship with Draco but was surprised to see even in their First Year the pair would shot spells at each other when members of the staff were not around. Harry wanted to think his Father was just defending himself from young Snape but saw that James would be the instigator of the events and would sometimes bring back up in Sirius and later Remus while Snape only seemed to be friends with Lily.
"I guess from the list I was given I would want to ask what is an Inheritance Test, a Marriage Contract, and the bond attached to a contract?"  Harry asked.
"What do you mean tested? Did that spell show I was really sick?" Harry asked looking up into the blonde man's face.
Arriving at the place Harry was finally reunited not only with his friends but Sirius as well. As he was hugged in greeting from his friends he could not help but wish it was Draco's strong arms that were the ones that were wrapped around him finding himself blushing a little which made Ginny, who had been hugging him at the time give him a smile. Harry was a little annoyed to learn that it had been under Dumbledore's orders that he was not to be told about anything from anyone not even that fact that he was being tailed. This really made him made for that means more people saw how he was treated by the Dursleys and had done nothing about it until he had been forced to defend himself. Wanting to see Draco he announced he was tired and needed to sleep. Unfortunately, you did not dream of Draco that night, but at least the next day he was finally able to do research into Veela mates but his school books were sorely lacking in any information on the subject. He thought about asking Sirius knew about any books that had more information but was worried about how his Godfather would react if he had to explain exactly why he was looking or his Godfather's reaction when he told him who his mate was.
"Yes just like Professor Snape was blocked in my Inheritance test from before our first year," Draco said as Harridan look confused at him. "As I said on the day we first came together my Blue Jay every student is usually required to take a test before they start school even if they come from a Magical family."
"Wait you touched one how did you not get turned or do they not go after Veelas?" Harry asked moving closer as if to check to see if Draco had any bite marks on him.
"I would like us to start using a Tracking Spell on some of the homework. The student who brought to my attention about my coursebook also revealed they have recently found out that a student that has been "helping" them do their homework has been feeding them wrong information," he began.
"No idea," the man said aiming his crossbow at the crumpled form of the two-faced man. "See to H'rry while I handle him," Hagrid ordered easily lifting Quirrell's form onto one of his shoulders and turning around.
"I wanted to check something out," Harry said not wanting to bring up that he had gone through the change in the middle of the Great Hall, or for that matter, until he found out how it had happened to him.
A week and a half after Harry had been locked away Harry woke up to the sound of tapping at the bedroom window. Waking up a start Harry saw an owl at his window. At first, he was surprised that an owl managed to get past Dobby's protection before he remembered himself as he got up to let them in. The owl was barely able to fit through the gap between two of the bars and landed on a broken desk Dudley had once owned. Seeing the Hogwarts Crest on the letter Harry knew it had to have come from the castle. Fearing the owl might take off again as soon as he removed the letter Harry quickly scribbled on a piece of scrap paper.
"Um, a Blood Artifact Retrieval from what I know of it is a way that Magicals can get back items that either belong to their family or were created by them. From what I know of it is usually done when objects are stolen or they lend it to someone who refused to give it back," Charity said.
While Blaise, Theo, Crabbe, and Goyle could not detect the released pheromones Draco could as he quickly got off his bed and rushed to his side.  The blonde's roommates looked on in shock as Draco got down onto the floor and pulled Harry to him.  "Calm down little one," Draco said in a gentle voice halting Harry's movements which had him rocking his head hitting against the wall.  Without meaning to Harry leaned in Draco as his rival threw an arm around his shoulders.  "It will be alright Harry," Draco said gently rocking him.
"First of all, so you can have all the fact about Harry here is the test we got from Gringotts which I am sure you can see my reasoning for not wanting to involve him at the moment," Lucius said handing over the results and letting his wife skim over the document and saw her eyes widen when it listed as Draco's Godfather being one of four people listed as having money paid to them from Harry's vaults. "Secondly," Lucius said after she was done with the results, "I want us to start a case against the Headmaster in secret. Since he had been able to enchant me and Vansel, and tried to do it to Draco with only the new bond he has with Harry protecting him, I do not want to try to face him again directly yet. I am also not sure it is wise to get Vansel cleansed of whatever the bastard did to him, though I did mention it to the Goblins after I was cleansed so they could do it next time he comes to the bank, even paying for it through our vaults. I think we need to start gathering evidence against the man. Sure we have everything on Harry, but I really don't want to use it unless we have to. I had discussed with Vansel about checking to see if any other students did not receive a full booklist as Harry had. And due to the Goblins having to perform two cleansing in a day to clear up enchantments cast by the man, Prince Bonecrusher himself informed me that he was going to start a bank-wide audit to see if the man was messing with anyone else accounts. If we can find any more evidence involving spells on or messing with the vaults of current students it might be enough to get the board to vote him out of being Headmaster."
"What's that the only guardians I had were the Dursleys and they would have nothing to do with magic," Harry said his curiosity getting the better of him as he lets his wings unwind a little from around him.
After Harry had drunk all his first round of inoculation potions the person who had been treating Draco, having found out they were called Healers, not Doctors, had finished and the other boy was to be returned to Hogwarts. Harry felt a small pang at the news, he had felt it was because once Draco had gone he would be alone in the Ward, but as Draco Flooed back to the castle Harry actually passed out. Narcissa, who had been the person treating him the whole time he was there, began to worry that he was suffering an aftereffect from his earlier Magical Coma and tried everything she could to wake him back up.
"Well, then I thank you Price Bonecrusher for the use of time magic to make this all so much smoother," Lucius said not wanting to inform them about Albus's letter to him or think about the number of letters he would have got if they had waited the nine hours plus for the procedure to take place in real-time.
"Well Minerva," he grit out, "it has come to my attention that the majority of my students had one of their potions books left off of their book list. And it seems that it has been left off for at least seven years, maybe longer."
"Would they affect me?" Harry asked having not come across any mention of love potions in regards to Alpha and Omegas in the books he had looked at yesterday morning.
Not feeling like he could trust either of his friends at the moment Harry decided to sit next to Neville in their next lessons which had been Potions. Rather than start the class right away, Snape asked everyone to raise their hands if they had a copy of
"I am his family's Account Manager," the goblin explained which explained it to Charity who as a Muggleborn had never really had a large enough vault to need a Goblin Account Manager. "And since Heir Potter is the last numerous lines I had been trying to reach him to give him his Heir/Lordship rings. What is even better with your visit is that as Heir Potter was passed out from something that happened in the bank this gave our Healers reason to perform a full cleansing on him. As our Healers did so we found he had been under various potions and enchantments. For his privacy, I am afraid I can not share any more than that with you."
"So you finally dropped that Mudblood trash Severus it was about time," a man with a nose that reminded Harry of Pansy Parkinson said in the memory as he threw his arm around Snape's slimmer form. "You know the Dark Lord could use a man like you with that marvelous skill of Potions you have. You could quickly rise through the ranks and have anything you want even that Mudblood skank," Parkinson said.
"Greetings Draconis," she said making him roll his eyes at her. He had heard stories of her being flighty and scatterbrained but he had never witnessed it as all he got was the smart and formal cousin that drove him nuts. She had once told him that her persona at the castle was her own version of her Pureblood Mask which she used to find out more about people when they thought she was slightly out of her mind.
* As a couple of chapters ago someone asked about Umbitch being Dumbles Beta rather than his Submissive I shall answer it here.  Albus is gay while he bonded with Umbitch as a way to gain and keep the power.  He chose a Muggle from a Squib line and had them drink Bearer potions to have him give birth to Hermione.
During supper, that night as the Harridan leaned into Draco the doors to the Great Hall crashed open as the irate Minister of Magic stomped into the room. He marched up to the Head Table and had a quick and angry conversation with the Umbitch before she threw down her napkin and marched out the of the hall as those who neither sat close enough or had creature abilities that heighten senses looked on with faces full of both happiness and confusion. Which only deepened as a tall black man took her spot at the staff table. Sending a glare at the Headmaster before somehow finding Harridan in the sea of students and giving him another one the Minster straightened his robes and marched back out of the hall. As soon as the doors closed the conversation in the hall grew into a pitch unheard of outside of a start of term, holiday, or end of term feast.
After lunch, Harry went back to the library only to be told that the three books he had used that morning were still in use by other students. He also had the misfortune of being spotted by Hermione who had him join him in some research for a while. While it was not something he enjoyed Harry did join her not only for a change of pace from the active morning he had but also to see what she was looking into since their classes were all done. It was almost mundane for her as he saw that Hermione was researching ways to Magically repair a person's sleep cycle. Making him guess that since she no longer had the Time-Turner she was trying to fix the damage she had done to herself by using it for almost a whole school year. She had told him, as they waited for everyone to emerge from the passage under the Whomping Willow that the hardest part of using it was sleeping as she could not interact with her other selves meaning she had to find random places around the castle in which to sleep in once she had stayed up too long while using the artifact. "I am rather glad I decided to turn it in for the last week or so I have been having rather strange dreams and have even been sleepwalking when I had been forced to sleep someplace other than my bed," Hermione said without looking up.
As is my way when I write a Bashing story that does not involve the entire Weasley family only those characters that I bash are considered Blood Traitors, aka Arthur, Ron, Ginny Weasley.  While the rest of the family are not.  Also, I will be going over Hermione Granger's "Muggle Pretender" status later as well as How Draco found out about it.
"Does this already include students we have done recently such as your Son and the Sons of Lords Lupin and Weasley?" Bonecrusher asked.
"I guess that makes sense," Harry said before asking, "Is there something special about a Life Debt?"
After Draco sent the letter he went in search of his other cousin who was attending Hogwarts. Luna was not that hard to find as she tended to hang out in a set number of locations. Thankfully he found she was not spending the morning in the forest for after the detention in his First Year he avoided the place as much as he possibly could.
"If you think just cause Malfoy is helping you rather than Granger will gain you more points in class you can forget it, Potter," Snape said with a sneer.
"That is actually quite a good question, but once again I can not answer it.  Your Account Manager just informed me that since I came to remove you from your bad situation without any thoughts of reward Batty and I would be given custody of you until we can all find a more suitable situation for you," Charity explained.
"Well if the Hogwarts's records don't work we should check out the Owl Advisory Board at the Ministry, after all, they keep track of all paths the owls take in Britain they would be able to track the owl that delivered Harry's message," Bathsheda.
"Strange, they may have forced me to do it but I like cooking as well," Harry said making Pansy wonder who he was talking about but thought better than to ask.
"I don't care about that," Susan said waving the Potion Master extra warning away making her Aunt rather proud of her.
"We mostly work on brewing, but without having access to your book I still didn't prepare the ingredient correctly. I am actually surprised I have never melted a cauldron before. Also, I guess I should apologize to you," Harry said.
"Merlin you are wearing some snakeskin. That settles it right after breakfast we are going back to our rooms so you can put something that is not diseased on. Afterward, we will set that thing on fire," Ron said moving away from Harry slightly as if afraid the borrowed cloak would get him sick.
The Twins smirked as their younger brother turned as red as his hair and turned to Sirius screaming at him at the exact same time as Ginny, Hermione, and their mother. The twins wondered if this was all some big prank from Sirius but he looked shaken as well as he finished reading his own letter from Gringotts. Not a single person moves from the table to collect their belongings before the deadline rather they argued with Sirius to reverse the decision of this Steward and Heir after all he was, Lord Black. They made so much noise that they set off Walburga's portrait who called them all Blood traitors and for them to get out of her house.
Draco and Harry had not shared their real relationship with anyone, not even Draco's parents or closest friends. Harry was the happiest he had even been letting Draco take full control of his life and giving Harry the opportunity to go around next to nothing or fully nude as the mood took him fulfilling some of his kinks. This always leads to Draco wondering what he would come home to having seen Harry dressed in BDSM gear, as a French Maid, just panties, even in fetish gear as he acted like a dog.
"Easily done though I might have to do some shopping if that is alright Cub?" Tumbus said checking out his new Master using the House Elf version of Mage-Site to see how well their Master's health was.
"To tell the truth Professor I did not see it myself but young Malfoy did along with Harry," Hagrid said.
Harridan woke up in what felt like the most comfortable bed ever as he opened his eyes to find out that while he was in a bed he was mostly laying on top of Draco's larger form. "Hello, my Blue Jay are you feeling better?" Draco asked sensing he was conscious again.
Harry was not sure if due to the change the Potion was less effective or his body had built up a tolerance from the other times he had been forced to drink it while he was in recovery, but Harry woke up before either Ron and Hermione showed signs of getting up. Using his wand he cast a quick Tempus spell and saw, for him, it was late being 7:15 am. Knowing from his long association with Hermione that the Library opened around seven-thirty Harry decided to stop by Gryffindor Tower for a change of clothes before heading out to do some research on Alpha/Omegas.
During the walk back up to the tower with his broom and cage, Harrison wondered what he should do about the train ride tomorrow not sure if he could stand a full four and a half hours crammed into the same compartment with Ron. He did not think Ginny would be joining them for the girl had always made the excuse that she was going to sit with her "friends" during the trip. One of which, he had been told, was Luna; though from what Draco's cousin had told him Ginny did not seem to really like Luna's spacy personality and used it to show that Ginny was a "kind-hearted person" for being nice to such a freak. Having heard this Harrison had clenched his fist in anger wanting to punch Ginny's lights out for that sort of thing as well as referring to Luna in a way that made him recall the Dursleys. It had taken Draco almost pulling Harrison into his lap to get the newly awaken Omega to calm down lest he acted out on his desire for physical violence against someone who was supposed to be his "friend." Thinking of this Harrison thought it might be better to get some more people into the compartment as he planned to asked Neville to join them, he would have asked Luna herself to come along as well but that might force Ginny to join in as well as trying to explain how he knew Luna. Also with Neville being in the compartment, he could avoid talking about Sirius, but only for the reason that he did not want to let slip that Sirius's leaving had caused him to become an Omega.
Near the end of class Professor Snape, after making sure everyone's Cleansing Potions had been brewed correctly directed them all to drink from them at the same time to not single anyone out. After his talks with Harry during the Occlumency lessons, Severus was sure that at least two people would get scrolls to appear after they drank the potion. But he was shocked as almost half the class got them with the students looking confused at the scrolls lying before them. Clearing his throat he got their attention before he explained," Since you, all created a basic Cleansing Potion it will not have gotten rid powerful enchantments that a person could have on them as well as some potions. The scroll that appeared before some of you is a list of any and all spells and potions that you have in your systems. It will be broken down into two parts the first part being what it was able to cleanse from you while the second part is items that it was able to detect in your system but was unable to deal with."
"Well that is alarming," the Goblin said looking over the note. "And you did this all by yourself?" he asked.
"Well, then I thank you Price Bonecrusher for the use of time magic to make this all so much smoother," Lucius said not wanting to inform them about Albus's letter to him or think about the number of letters he would have got if they had waited the nine hours plus for the procedure to take place in real-time.
*2 Trap Street idea comes from an episode of Doctor Who of a special sanctuary for Aliens, or in this case people with Creature Blood.
"That is alright, young Heir if you are like some members of your family you will end up dealing with my kind on numerous occasions throughout your life," Elmblossom said giving him a small smile letting Harry see that another difference between this Goblin and the others he had met was the lack of sharpened teeth in their mouth. "So shall we begin? Or do you have any other questions about my kind?" Harry had a feeling this was a general question and not the Ritualist getting annoyed that he was wasting time.
"Yeah, that would do it," Draco said nodding his head. "So your family would really kill you?" Draco asked.
"None taken," Draco said before one of the others could speak up gently squeezing Harry's hand before letting it go.
"Nothing will happen to them as the largest part of the punishment is her use of a Time-Turner," McGonagall stated knowing just what Albus had been trying to do. As Severus, Remus, and Narcissa had not been called forth as casting the Founders' votes yet only Severus had been able to vote and with Albus unable due to his relationship to Hermione the vote had been eight to two with one parent from Light and one from the Gray voting in her favor.
"Oh no, people will find out I like to cook and still have a stuffed lion from when I was a kid on a shelf above my bed at home," Draco said rolling his eyes and catching Harry's eye making the brunette let out a soft giggle.
"Well due to the hit I sort of activated Blaise's Dominant side and well the next day he sought us out and claimed us as his Mates," George said blushing even deeper.
"Yeah but unlike everyone else, I did not swoon over every little thing you did for good or ill," Draco stated.
He could not help but wonder if someone from the castle would come to check out why he had not shown up for class. Most days lately Harry just spent the day staring into space bored out of his mind, doodling with some of Dudley's old pens, or sleeping the time away. After a week of having nothing to do Harry had ended up doing some simple exercises during his best to stay in shape. He actually took great pleasure in doing some jumping jacks and hearing his Aunt complain. He did point out to her when she screamed at him through the door that if he did not exercise he might just have to try to talk to the neighbors through the bars attached to his windows. She decided to leave him alone after that, and Harry was smart enough not to try it when Uncle Vernon was home lest he find himself back down in the cupboard and his school supplies locked up in the room. That did not mean he did not exercise when his uncle was home he just stuck to more silent activities suck as push-up and sit-up.
"I quite agree which means we need to get inside now," Bathsheda said as they both headed back to the alley and secretly unlocked the backyard fence. Casting Notice-Me-Not and Dissalustionment Charms on themselves. Bathsheda then cast a Hover Charm on Charity floating her up to the window with the bars. Charity made short work of the bars first banishing before putting up an illusion so it would not raise any eyebrows from the Muggles. Seeing Harry inside the room doing some sit-ups she gently knocked on his window making him start. Knowing that he would be able to see her due to the charms she had on her to go unnoticed she cast a spell on the window which would allow him to see her through it.
"No, it is the truth here let me show you," Harry said taking out his bag and pushed over the first draft from his Potions homework of the year and the one he had turned in with Hermione's help which had Draco's notes on it.
Draco had not been so sure of why Neville had wanted to help him at first; before the other boy explained that he and Harrison were Godbrothers with each of their mom's the other's Godmother. And with Draco having the Marriage Contract with Harrison both boys knew that they could trust each other, at least when it came to Harrison. Granted they did not always agree on their plans, Neville having wanted to be taught the cleansing spell Draco knew so he could be the one to cast it, but Draco would never be able to live with himself if he let someone else cleanse Harrison apart from a fully certified Healer or Goblin. The pair had ended up fighting about it for a bit which only ended when Draco hit him with a Leg Locker Curse. But now that part was all moot for Draco had felt Harrison having somehow gotten Cleansed so he was going to fully apologize for his overreaction to his ally.
Susan showed up a little later looking slightly confused at being summoned by Professor McGonagall and even more so when she saw her Aunty. "Aunty?" she asked coming further into the room.
"In layman terms due to what we have found out about my client couple with how you and Bathsheda helped him out of a bad situation without thought of any type of reward lets me put him in both your care. It also did not hurt that your worry and disappointment at yourself for possibly causing him to pain sealed the deal. I will mention that just because of your new duty as his guardian I still can not give you any private information about him other than to point out some general information. In the first bit of advice, you might want to talk to him when he gets up and give him information on the Hogwarts Houses and suggest he looks at some of his relationships. Also while I can not share who it is with his parents did arrange a Marriage Contract for him between a child of some of their friends from when they had gone to Hogwarts themselves. Now as a Muggleborn Magical you may not be well acquainted with Marriage Contracts. When a Contract is legal, valid, and those involved are attracted to the other's sexual identity a bond is created between them. I can inform you this at least that we had found that one of the enchantments that Heir Potter had been under was to block such a bond so he may ask you about it when the results of what we had cleansed from him. If he wishes to share his results with you or Madam Badding we do hope you keep his information a secret," the Goblin stated.
"There is more?" Harry asked confused as even the first letter that had been delivered to the Dursleys had been just as thick as the one he had handed over.
"Hey that is not my fault Mr. Potter never came in for his scheduled medical exam at the start of the year," Madam Pomfrey said.
Rather than respond to her statement he had both her and Ron join the next group to cast their Patronus. Harry paid close attention to the Patronus cast by the pair to see what he could find out about them. It did not really surprise him that Ron's Patronus resembled Crookshakes which as the animal closest related to Hermione showed the redhead had feelings for the bushy-haired witch. Hermione on the other hand had not produced either a rat or pigmy owl, the two animals that had been related to Ron, rather her Patronus had been a toad. Harry spent a moment wondering if she liked Neville but after a closer look saw that the toad she had created did not resemble Trever at all. As that group had been the last ones to try casting the spell Harry decided to call it a night and started to use the map to let everyone go. To make sure that Hermione did not continue the conversation from earlier he had her and Ron leave earlier. Which seeing the look on the redhead's face he was sure that Hermione was going to be distracted by Ron asking about her Patronus. He had explained his actions to Hermione saying it was a way to throw off Umbitch and her Squad by having them not leave with him for once. As he waited for everyone to leave before he pulled out the Invisibility Cloak he had hid in one of his inner pockets, which Draco had helped him expanded with an Undetectable Expansion Charm, and threw it over himself to make his way back to Gryffindor Tower.
Harry meets up with Draco for a second tutoring session on the night he would be going to his lessons with Snape, so he would not have to have another day to work around for D.A. meetings. Harry was actually surprised when Draco offer him congratulations on the Potion he had submitted in class. "You know now that you know that you need to pay attention to how you prepare everything you should do better in class," Draco had said.
Hermione felt no hesitation when it came to drinking her Cleansing Potion. For she knew that she was the top student in her class and even if what Snape said was true about it abolishing most spells and potions in their system once it was drunk she was sure her Mummy's magic would be alright. Sending a small glare at Potter as he sat next to Longbottom, Hermione could only wonder what was going on that caused her Mummy's plans to be derailed, something that had never happened before. She was sure it was not her fault for she was a brilliant actor and due to her only ever appearing at Diagon Alley and Platform 9 3/4 in the presence of the Squib fourth cousins everyone thought she was an innocent little Mudblood. If only they knew who she really was they would be shocked and bowing down to her, especially the likes of Malfoy who she thought would shit himself if he ever learned who her Daddy was. Hermione could not wait for this charade to finally end and she could deliver Potter to her Mummy and Daddy not to mention cut ties with the blood traitor family.
"Well I live with my Mum's sister and her family but the test from Gringotts mentioned a Lucius Malfoy is one of my Godparents so you could contact him if he is related to you," Harry said.
"I have compiled some notes on certain activities that your daughter has done during her time at Hogwarts and compared it to other students who have done the same thing. In more often than not your daughter, and the students who were with her, lost points and maybe single detention, but in similar cases, the student would get over a week's worth of detention from the act," Lucius said handing over his notes to Professor McGonagall, not trusting them to the Headmaster.
"Well done Harry not only getting your EE but also on your potion. I don't think you really need me to tutor you now that you have the book and are not trusting Granger's help on your assignments," Draco said during their next tutoring session.
"You managed to handle yourself very well Cursebreaker William, but are you sure are willing to undertake your current assignment. Many of us would perfectly understand if you choose to turn it down?" Grindstone asked.
"Thank you, Professor," Susan said as Amelia give them a slight bow. Before they left the pair alone Severus and Minerva said if she had any questions about being a Founder's Heir she could always talk to Harridan.
"I was told to come to talk to you if I had any question on being a Founder's Heir," Susan said perching on the top of one of the desks in the room.
"Alright Professor," Harry said as he and Draco followed her to the other Champions who had been seated next to the door. Harry took in Cedric Diggory with his date Cho Chang giving him and Draco matching shocked expressions on their faces. While Fleur and her date, Roger Davis, did not seem to notice mostly due to Roger seeming to be unable to look away from the part Veela girl. But Harry's eyes could only look in shock as he found Viktor Krum and his date, Hermione. Harry had to guess that he and his best female friend shared the same shocked expressions at each other's dates.
"No writ, no test," Grindstone said in a manner that Harry saw as annoyance at Mr. Malfoy for wasting his time.
"I am afraid you passed out on the trip back up so we brought you to our Halls of Healing. As standard procedure due to your passing out our Healers ran a checkup on you and found some troubling news," the goblin said passing over a roll of parchment to him. "Now I have been told that most of these had been cleansed but also your Account Manager has undertaken some measures to further protect you. I think it would be wise to look over your documents so you can ask any questions about them when Master Bonecrusher comes to see you in a bit."
"Fine then you can come with me as a friend that way you can attend," Ron said looking at his little sister.
"In my zeal, I told what I had overheard to the Dark Lord, and to my surprise, he decided to go after your parents. Having been on the edge of leaving before then his decision sent me to the Headmaster to call for him to protect Lily and your family. If only he had either picked someone else as the Secret Keeper or done it himself your parents would have been still alive and it is all basically my fault."
Having really gotten into this story but no where near an ending point when I had to call it a night.  I have decided to change  the whole book into a Draco/Harry bunny farm for any stories I can think of so I can make a part 2 to it and finish it.
"That did not look like you were brewing you seemed to be going over homework," Snape said with a sneer.
Harry received a return letter from Ron on his second full day of Quarantine as Draco had been lead out of the room by a woman in a black robe wearing a monocle.
"It was my Aunt," Harry said seeing Snape grip his wand tighter making Harry afraid he was about to be cursed by the man.
"He is here, Narcissa, due to a complaint I got about the Medi-Witch who is stationed at Hogwarts. Arriving there I found that she had not even treated him for an injury he received last night, nor had she properly done her job in collecting the medical history of another student which is why we are not alone," Lucius said before he introduced Narcissa to Harry.
Harry was shocked at the question not only for its own sake but for it was the second time Snape had stated his mother's name. "No, I would rather just be left alone yet each year something seems to happen that forces me to act."
"I am sorry Draco," Harry said as he snuggled closer to the blond boy a little surprised that he had not called Voldemort the Dark Lord.
"Oh sorry for not introducing myself I am Prince Bonecrusher and have been the Potter, Gryffindor Account Manager for 358 years now," Bonecrusher said smiling up at him. "Also if you wish to get your Properties back at once that is the easiest to perform as it does not actually require us to let the people illegally using them know about you taking back control before it is done."
Harry wisely did not share this letter with Draco when he got back, feeling a little anger at his friend who unknowingly described what had happened to him when he had faced off against Voldemort, not Draco who had shown himself to be a here. When Harry asked what had happened since the woman had not been wearing the light-colored Robes Harry now associated with the Healers and Medi-Magicals that worked for St. Mungos. Draco explained that the woman was Madam Bones who was the head of the Ministry of Magic's Law Enforcement Offices who had wanted Draco's memory of his encounter with You-Know-Who in the forest. What Draco did not share is that he also gave a memory of Dumbledore stunning the Head of Hogwarts's Board of Governors, his father, and him at Hogwarts. As well as the memory of seeing that his father had been enchanted by the Headmaster. The only reason Draco had shared these memories was due to his father being there prompting him to do so. Draco was also told that to keep up the idea that he was still enchanted he would be unable to visit Draco or Harry again during the rest of their time at the hospital. Lucius had given his son a tight hug before he left with Madam Bones to discuss the case he was making against the man for what he had done to Harry and tried to do to him and his son.
"They would have been removed as your Guardians and other candidates would have been found," Bonecrusher said. "The Goblin Nation would never allow such artifacts to remain in the hands of thieves if either of them had not signed off of the ritual they would have faced Goblin Justice for possibly being complicit in what had been done to you." This news made Harry breathe a sigh of relief for not only had the pair of Professor pass the test but it would be the first step in setting things right.
"You and everyone else," Harry said with a small huff sitting on the edge of one of the room's desks.
"Very well, I shall do as you wish, but first I will have to verify your identity just in case you are using potions or spells to look like my client," the Goblin said pulling out a small quill with a sharp point looking like a Muggle medical needle. "Heir Potter please prick the thumb of your wand hand and let it collect a few drops of blood," the Goblin said pushing the quill over to him. Getting a nod of confirmation from Draco's family Harrison pressed the point of the quill to his thumb and let it pierce his skin and held it there for a moment. "That is enough Heir Potter," the Goblin said after a bit taking the quill back as Andromeda used her wand to heal the small puncture in his thumb.
"I did not see him hurt a unicorn personality, but Potter and myself found the hurt unicorn and him coming along to start to drink its blood," Draco said causing the members of staff to gasp at what that all meant.
"Did someone repair the place after my folks died?" he asked recalling Hagrid telling him last year that he had pulled Harrison out of the ruins of the place himself.
"So, don't get me wrong I am proud of him but a Life Debt would not cause him to develop a magical bond," she shot back.
"I am afraid I must agree with the Matron stay in bed we will send an Elf," Mr. Malfoy said making Harry wonder what he meant by an Elf. What he found out was that the Magical Elf was nothing like a Muggle idea of it. For rather than the ethereal ageless being that the Muggles thought of the Elf who answered Draco's dad summoning was a small wrinkled thing wearing what looked like a towel with large bat-like ears.
"That would work," Severus said, "though as he the Submissive in your parental triad and Lucius has lost his place on the Board I think Narcissa would have to be the one to cast the vote." Both Draco and Harridan smiled at him knowing he was really doing it to keep Tom away from Dumbles.
"I would not go overboard though I think it would be best to place some mail ward on me so that only people I approve off can reach me," Harridan said as he pulls a blank bit of parchment and ripped it in half before starting his letters to his friends. Draco gave him a quick hug before he wrote a letter to his own friends deciding to limit it to three so as to not overwhelm his mate or himself for that matter.
"There is nothing wrong Amelia in fact it is sort of good news," Severus said as Minerva had Leia get a note to Susan to come to meet with them as well.
"Let's see... think of it as one of the Muggle Deities.  Lady Magic is said to be a supreme being for all things Magical and she is said to work with others representing Death, Time, Nature or the Earth itself, Destiney sometimes called Fate, and some believe there is one that stands for Life as well," Charity said and sees the Goblin Healer give a small nod.
"Well you basically confessed your feelings for me, before we sort of got sided tracked," Harry stated.
For his part in getting rid of Dumbledore before he took over Tom granted Draco Malfoy a boon as long as it was in his power to fulfill. Draco asked a heavy price wanting Tom to not only spare Harry Potter but also place the boy under his charge. The former Lord Voldemort was not sure about this boon, at least until Draco showed him a spell from the Malfoy family Grimoire. Allowed to see the spell Tom smiled as he granted the new Malfoy Lord his boon.
Harry bite his bottom lip for he was not sure as he had not even taught that spell to the D.A. yet. He was about to tell the blonde to pick another spell for them to work on when he saw Draco was giving him puppy dog eyes. That plus Snape saying that Draco's Mother and he did their best to keep Lucius' evil taint from taking hold of him finally made up Harry's mind. "Fine we can try it," Harry said and laughed a little as Draco gave a cheer as he pumped his fist up and down. "Well keep feeling that joy for that is needed for the spell. To cast a Patronus one needs to think of something happy, sometimes a memory others time just something that brings them joy like a pet of favorite book or something," Harry explained as he thought about Sirius after he was exonerated for betraying his parents letting him move in with the man before he cast his Stag Patronus.
Taking a moment to read over the two pages Snape's mouth shifted into a thoughtful look before handing them back. "And your sudden skill in Potions this afternoon?" the man asked.
"We would also like the test to note if the student is under any spells, potions, or enchantments," Minerva said thinking about what Severus said about his son being under love potions for Hermione.
Harry noticed that as Ron walked past with Lavender glaring at both him and Hermione, and he was not the only one as the Viktor's fan club glared at Hermione, while Pansy Parkinson glared at Harry as she walked past on the arm of Vincent Crabbe, who also glared at Harry on Draco's arm. Once everyone had entered the Great Hall Harry and the other Champions were made to stand up and head in as well. Once more Harry let Draco take the lead as the blonde lead him to one of the top tables which also contained Hermione, Viktor, as well as Ludo Bagman. Harry rather wished another tournament official had been at his table having found Bagman annoying as the man tried to get him to cheat. As they reached the table Draco pulled his arm away and to Harry's shock pulled Harry's chair away form the table before he took his own seat. Harry blushed a little shooting a look at Hermione and saw Viktor had done the same to her as she also blushed. Rather than catch her eye Harry looked down at the table and saw a menu lying on the table.
Finishing that note Harrison went down the document tapping each asterisk to find out what news they had. According to the document his Core was being blocked in three ways with two percent blocked by his parents as all Magical parents did to their kids under the age of five which had not been removed. Thirty-six of his Core was blocked by a spell cast by Professor Dumbledore for some reason, while the last thirty-four was being done by his own body to constantly heal itself due to the damage done to it over the year. His Eyesight Jinx prevented him from seeing the board in his classes no matter how near or far he was sitting from it. There was also an automatic counter-Jinx which would only be activated when Harrison was riding a broomstick. While Professor Dumbledore had blocked the use to learn or recall any form of Pareslemagic, according to the added text, Harrison's ability to speak and understand snakes had been left alone.
Harrison's plan for Neville to sit with them nearly worked out perfectly as the round-faced boy was ecstatic to be asked to sit with Hermione and him in their compartment, Harrison did not mention Ron though he knew the red-head would be there anyway. The only issue that had come about was about an hour and a half into their trip a small owl pecked at their window to be let in. Once it was inside the small bird dropped a letter on Harrison's lap before zooming around the compartment until Ron caught it having seen Crookshanks follow its progress from its place on Hermione's lap. Seeing the letter was from Sirius, Harrison read it quietly to himself before wondering if he should inform Ron that the owl he was holding was now his, from Sirius, as an apology for what happened with Pettigrew. "So who was the letter from Harry," Neville asked. Harrison had as of yet not told anyone besides Luna and Draco his desire to use his birthname yet waiting to bring it up at the start of next term as if he had found out about his name over the summer.
"She is my Great-Great-Aunt on my mother's side why do you ask?" Draco asked using his wand to attach the medallion he had been working on to the newly awaken Omega's right lapel.
When Draco and his roommates were finished getting dressed he gently placed a hand on Harry's shoulder letting him know it was alright to lift the hood and stopped humming.
Seeing shadow come from the underbrush and lower its head to the unicorn's neck to drink from the wound Draco could not help but let out a terrified scream. Turning on his heel Draco took off after Fang. "What the hell was that Potter?" Draco asked turning from the great boarhound retreating backside to look at Potter, only to see that the other boy was not there. "Oh hell, don't tell me," Draco said casting a look over his shoulder expecting to see the Gryffindor trying to battle against the shadow. Once more the blonde found himself to be mistaken as he sees Harry curled up before the approaching shadowy figure, his hands clutching his head as if in pain. While Draco hated that Harry had spurned his friendship in favor of the Blood Traitor Weasely, he could not let the shadow reach the B0y-Who-Lived. "Alright Draco, it is no big deal just some random dark shadow who had killed a Unicorn and is about to reach Potter," Draco said trying to psych himself up. "Probably going to die or get hurt, assuredly get dirty, but people will know I did it to save Potter after he was abandoned by that bloody groundskeeper."
As the door closed behind them Albus wanted to scream if only Pomona had not come with the girl he could have easily cast some compulsions on the girl making her choose Albus to be her Proxy for both Wizengamot and the Hogwarts School Board. He was sure that if he had access to one of the Hogwarts Founders votes the Light Party would have no choice but to accept him back as the leader of the party putting him back in the position of Chief Warlock. He had only bowed out quietly for it worked in his plans for the Potter brat, but those had all gone out the window when the boy had become a nasty creature. Albus had been waiting to reveal if things got too bad or the fools had started to change some of his laws that he was the Proxy of Gryffindor House seat but the brat had taken control of his seats and handed them over to Lucius Malfoy to act as Proxy. As of right now due to losing Harry and Severus's seats the Light Section had the same amount of seats as the Dark the moment. The only reason that it was still a Light Section party member that held the rank of Chief Warlock was due to them having had the power before the sections had reached a tie of seats, but a single seat in either direction could make a difference at the moment. So he needed the Hufflepuff seat which had been inactive for over fifty years and thus had not been part of any of the three parties' totals. If he could not get Susan to hand him her votes herself he would send his daughter and pawns after her to get her to act towards the Greater Good.
Harry began to squirm a little under her gaze before she pulled out a very thin wand making him think of the switches in the stories Dudley would tell him about teachers using to punish students. He filched back a little but she just cast a spell that summoned three volumes to her arms. "These may help," she said as to his surprise she gave him a small smile slipping the books into his arms. Harry was so shocked having never seen her smile before that he just nodded as he left to find a table. Not wanting to be found looking through the books, feeling a little embarrassed by it, Harry moved deep into the library and to a little-used table before he sat down to begin his research.
Trying to distract the shadow as it got close enough to reach Harry, Draco let out a loud war cry as he began to cast spells at the figure. For all the good he did Draco might as well have been throwing rocks at the thing. He did manage, however, to get the things attention as to his shock a wand appeared from the shadow hitting him with a spell that sent Draco flying backward into a tree and dazing him. "The pest is dealt with continue with the boy," a voice said though in Draco's current state he could not determine where it was coming from. Though Draco did not see the speaker he saw the shadow turn back to Potter. The shadow pulled the wand back into itself as it approached Potter who now appeared to be unconscious. Fearing for Potter, Draco pushed himself off the tree one hand clutching his side knowing that if he did not act Potter was going to die.
"My pleasure Lord Malfoy," Bonecrusher said with a look that said he guessed what Lucius had had to deal with when he had been out of the bank.
