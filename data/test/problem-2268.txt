Malfoy stirred on the bed below him, making a small noise in the depths of his goose down burrow, then rolling back over. Harry furrowed his brow - it didn’t sound like he was sleeping peacefully anymore? Was Malfoy having nightmares too? His thoughts were answered as he heard Malfoy gasp and flail in the bed below him, making a sound like someone was strangling him, his breathing ragged and pained.
That is, until the telltale swoosh of the floo roaring to life in the grate downstairs. Harry released Draco and gave him a reassuring smile. “Go on, then.” He encouraged, smiling at Draco’s wide eyed nervous expression.
“It’s the password. Harry Potter.” His voice faded away on Harry’s surname, turning to a whisper.
“I was never a match for you. I was always rather jealous of you and your marks in school. It drove me mad. Actually, it drove my father mad, which drove me to act like a complete prick. God, I was awful. I totally deserved you punching me in the face in third year.”
That night laying in a tangle of limbs with Harry, under his thick duvet he thought about what the future would hold for him, for them.
He thought he saw Harry’s mouth twitch in response. “You’re a right git, you know that?” He said, with only half the amount of venom.
Or, perhaps it was someone who didn’t appreciate a Death Eater opening up shop in a quiet town full of innocent people. He ran through a mental list of people that would want to snoop around his practice in the dead of night, as he heard more distinct shuffling of feet.
“We should go.” Harry urged sharply, gripping Draco’s hand. Pulling him away from the mob of thestrals crowding around his father’s body, the mass of shiny black skin stretched tight over bones, the mob of tense leathery hides shimmering in the half light of the slit windows. Their nickering and screeching, getting louder, insistent. Draco felt his own magic rise in response like a great tidal wave of power wanting to pull him back towards his father as Harry pulled him forcefully down the hall.
The sun was coming up, and Draco saw that there were two thestrals staring in through the kitchen window. He couldn’t tell if their presence soothed or worried him. Were they here to take him to Harry? Was Harry injured? Was he alive?
Harry ran from where Flea had landed, his feet quick along the half melted snow of the meadow, little patches of earth visible where the sun had managed to warm the ground enough.
“Oh, no, dear, I’ll be fine. Thanks for dinner, love.” She winked at him, and began walking down the stairs.
He had told himself he took the books out to learn more about the dark arts, but what he really wanted was to help Malfoy with his research in some way - he hadn’t let him come with to go sit with the unicorn herds, but Harry had wanted to be useful nonetheless, and they both knew it wouldn’t be with the potions side of things. His work was important. Harry believed it would help many people, and he wanted Malfoy to succeed in it.
“Just the one is following me.” He subtly corrected. It wasn’t a lie, it just wasn’t a whole truth.
The thestrals who had watched the entire exchange with somber expressions now began to amble behind them.
Wingbeats sounded from the garden as a thestral took flight into the rain.
“I did good as the Chosen One, didn’t I? That wasn’t exactly a fucking picnic.”
“How do you always know it’s me?” Draco asked with real curiosity.
Harry scribbled a little note on parchment to accompany the package:
It was incredibly nauseating and decidedly overwhelming.
Between his numerous owls with Harry, Draco had spent his time bouncing from Luna, Hermione, and Beatrice. Luna smiled slyly every time she caught Draco grinning to himself and, when asked why she was looking at him like that, she only responded with, “Your nargle infestation has diminished significantly.”
They made their way through the gates with winged boars and Draco adjusted his scarf around his neck, loosening it.
“Hestia wants us to come to the practice. To move the research materials they didn’t manage to steal, to pack up our things. She and Neville and someone named Juniper have been so kind to take care of all that cleaning for us— it sounds like they left quite a mess. Bubotubor pus and porcupine quills all over— together they let off quite an acrid steam, you know— Oh, and coupled with the quail eggs...”
He didn’t want to apparate, it felt too easy. He wanted to rid himself of the adrenaline and restlessness coursing through his veins. He wanted to push himself through thickets and thorns, shed his cumbersome cloak and run until he collapsed. Cover his skin in mud and scratches and bruises. He wanted to feel the forest around him, to be a part of it, to be something different than the buttoned up person he was raised to be in the clean halls and spotless grounds of the manor.
The the earnestly sniffing werewolf looked at him and seemed to deliberate whether it was worth arguing the point or not. Mercifully it seemed, it was not.
He whistled loudly and Little Dipper swooped in, as if waiting for the signal, from an outside tree. He was electric with excitement for a delivery. It had been ages since he’d had a job.
“And, most shockingly, they were able to keep their research in private archives. Shelves upon shelves of deep magical history and research, hidden from view!” Hermione finished, breathing hard, her hair looking electric with indignation.
Harry stared as she tapped out the contents of the plastic baggie onto her hand, her palm to her chest, loading the depression just beyond the base of her thumb. She brought it up to her nose and snorted greedily. Her smile big and bright, she tapped out a second hefty helping of the white powder and offered it to Harry.
Winston still looked wary when he nodded his head. Two more faces appeared in the doorway.
After they each respectively washed and changed into pajamas they wordlessly migrated to Draco’s bed with cocoa in hand. They sat cross legged, facing one another, a roaring fire on the other side of the cottage heating their small space. They talked about flying and quidditch, about Hogwarts and their best memories of the place.
Finally, his features settled into staunch determination.
Draco was at a loss for words. He felt inherently uncomfortable with Harry’s seemingly effortless, kind words about him. He had to work not to fidget in his seat. Eventually, he swallowed hard and looked up at Harry and nodded. What could he say to that? No one had ever said such soft words to him about his mark, of all things.
“You know how I feel about the manor.” Draco said shortly. “And I cannot begin to fathom the things my mother must be telling you.” He sighed, and began to unpack his bag.
“They were entrusted to research areas of magic that wizarding society revered, feared, and felt too taboo to discuss in polite company, or were afraid of letting out into non-magic families, to muggle-borns or half-bloods. Owing to the wizarding population’s proclivity for superstition, no one questioned how the department was run, or what they got up to for
“He’s the reason I can’t even smell firewhiskey without flashbacks anymore.” He said. “That’s how I had a panic attack in front of Neville, he was preparing a tincture in the greenhouses with it and broke a jar and off I went.” After a beat he added, “Please promise me you won’t ever drink it around me.”
.” He said sternly, with a sly grin.
What followed was a thirty minute lecture on the obligation of every Gryffindor to be a champion of the weak, to be a shining, golden light in the face of unspeakable evil in this world. That’s what the hat meant by bravery. By nerve. And daring. And that evil was not death eaters or, for fuck’s sake,
“..Me too.”
The track marks stood out, even against his dark skin, bruises, old and new, filling in the hollows between his metacarpals. How had he let himself get this bad? His skin no longer looked soft and inviting, just ashen and papery. Rough, and like it barely felt the need to wrap around the tips of his phalanges.
February 28, 2009
The article continued in this vapid vein of wild speculation about what could have possibly happened to Draco that would have driven him to testify against Lestrange, followed by even wilder speculations about Harry Potter’s sudden reappearance to public life, just in time to testify.
Harry stood, unraveling. Unwinding himself from the traces of Draco. From the feeling of him that draped across his skin, that pulled around his very bones. It was painful, touching him, eating away at him. Like an acid that had been spilled across his viscera, it gnawed. Harry wanted it gone. He wanted it numb.
“Yeah.” Felix sighed, finally breaking his intense gaze to rub his eyes with his fingers, and he started his story in a rambling burst of information. “I wasn’t born a squib— I was born with magic. Started showing signs young. I remember doing things like making flowers grow or changing the colour of things. Turn on lights. Little things. My dad was a pureblood. He got into a fight with someone— I must have six— it was with an old drinking buddy— I walked in to see what they were yelling about and the bloke shot a curse at me— I woke up in St. Mungo’s. Said it had damaged my magic somehow. Stunted it. I can still do little things— light candles. When I’m feeling a powerful emotion sometimes I have episodes of accidental magic— Exploded a few light bulbs last time I was hospitalized— started a few toilet fires— It’s why I started using. Helps kill the magic I can’t control.”
“You’ll think of something. Just honour their memory. Honour their happiness in a story that is otherwise dark and full of pain and imagined isolation. Maybe that is what your friend needs, too, a way to make their memory something outside of the war. Or, maybe just a memory that they alone don’t have to carry.”
He felt weak to let Harry know these things— these ghostly thoughts.
How was he supposed to mitigate this balance between pleasure and mistrust of his own brain? How would he walk the line between enjoyment and indulgence in something harmful? It had made sense, what Luna had described, the link between dopamine, pleasure and reward, in other words, addiction, and sex, which often accessed and stimulated the same parts of his brain that drove him to toward a sense of oblivion in the first place.
“Well done, mate.” Harry said, patting his back, sounding teary himself. Draco said nothing, not trusting his ability to speak without blubering.
His feet swiftly carried him back to his office where he changed out of his black scrubs. Once Draco had achieved his status as a specialist, he never deigned to wear the St. Mungo’s ghastly green robes again, preferring to stick to something he felt more suited too. Never mind that it made his complexion even paler and his hair more abundantly noticeable.
________
He re-read the letter once more, trying to strengthen his resolve. He could do this. It was going to be okay.
“No.” Harry said quietly.
Now, he was binding his research, making copies and preparing his samples for transport to the DoM. He had wavered for nearly three days as to whether he should include his 5th potion and theory. It wasn’t as complete as the others, and it wasn’t in his speciality of blood curses, but he had a good feeling and hoped whoever tested his samples could give him some decent feedback for improvements. He had recommended a specific case study to the DoM if the potion proved to be safe and effective.
. It was also intimidating, staring right back at him, empty, taunting, devoid of the hope that was supposed to be written there. He picked up a little book that he had discarded immediately after bringing home;
That fucking git.
_______________
“I need to go to Grimmauld Place.” Harry intoned, not yet opening his eyes, but enjoying this new sensation of connectedness to his own body - as if he felt more in control of the different pieces of him, and it was satisfying in a way that the numbness and the flaccid apathy of opiates couldn’t mimic.
They fell into silence for a few long moments, listening to the crackle of fire, processing the information. “So,” Draco broke first, “I have a few questions.”
Draco’s stomach grumbled in protest as he finished the tower paperwork piled onto his office desk. He was at the end of
Harry chewed at the edges of his fingernails and stared at the blank cubicle wall in front of him, trying to remember how he had managed to get through the most stressful, most terrifying, most difficult days of his life. How had he survived living under the humiliation, the sickening hatred of the Dursleys? How had he faced Voldemort, year after year? He was a child then. He was a child then, and he had more courage, more bravery, more stamina than the adult he had grown into. Everything was washing over him in waves. Where was the stoicism that had kept him going, the gentle guidance of Dumbledore leading him to his death, a lamb to slaughter. A martyr for wizard-kind. Where was the boy who lived.
It was Draco’s turn to sag. He took a deep breath and stared into Harry’s kind eyes, willing himself to be honest and clear with what he needed and wanted.
Buzzing with nervous anticipation, he scribbled on a small piece of parchment.
“He probably shouldn’t have, seeing as what I’ve done with it.” The words were out of his mouth and hanging in the space between them before Harry could stop himself. He turned away to look out across the little meadow, his heart suddenly heavy with reality. He didn’t deserve Sirius’s house, or his legacy. Fuck, he definitely didn’t deserve him sacrificing his life for… this.
Hermione nodded with understanding at Harry and squeezed his hand. Draco felt the tense magic soften, even if just a little. He took a deep breath and sent his own across the table to anchor Harry, who glanced at him with a ghost of a grateful smile.
__________
“Did you know,” Harry started, and Draco rolled his eyes, knowing what Harry was going to say, and smiling in spite of himself. Nine years they’d been having this argument-- nine years since Draco had planted the fig tree in the garden despite Harry’s repeated proclamations that the singular fig would take over the whole hollow-- and 9 years since he’d been tripping on the errant and destructive roots, “that figs have invasive root systems?”
Harry laughed, his heart singing, his magic turning around him, keening. He apparated from just there, without bothering to clean the bar, to check on the barman, to make sure no muggles had seen – he was beyond caring. He had his singular objective.
He tried to focus on deep, even breaths as he ran up the quiet street, one block east of St. Mungo’s, his hand dragging along the perfectly manicured boxwood bushes that lined the avenue.
“Yeah, then you can apparate me home.” It was a statement, an imperial decree, and Draco felt his alarm bells going off.
“Now, I don’t have the energy to be jealous and my father is in prison.” He said, with a small smile. “I’m just grateful you’re the one working on my research with me,” his words were nothing but the truth, and he hoped she noticed.
Over the years, when Draco had tried to experience pleasure, his body’s memories of Lestrange had spoilt it rancid. Time and time again it had expired to something putrid, curdling in his gut. But, now, in the safety of his solitude and the knowledge that Lestrange was behind bars, that once evasive sybaritic indulgence lay across his skin, unmarred and wanting. Light and free.
He had realized, with frightening, blinding clarity, that night, as he stared at the ceiling and felt Harry’s warm body, asleep against him, that he felt the same way. He had told Luna all those months ago that he loved Harry, but he didn’t think he even really knew what that meant back then. He had thought the words, sometimes, in the depths of night with Harry wrapped around him— or, in the quiet moments sharing tea on the sofa— or, in the thrill of sparring words and diatribes over what sheets to put on the bed. He had been thinking it for weeks— months, now. But, how does he tell Harry?
“… I can’t. I need it too.” The barman replied, feebly, his eyes now wide with fear. Ah, the truth, Harry realised. And his magic sent out a concussive force that knocked the barman unconscious instantly. Blood dripped from his nose and Harry let him fall, slumping down amongst the broken glass.
Sometime after lunch, Draco found himself by the fireside, sitting cross legged on the rug with a tiny set of double pointed needles and lace weight wool, knitting the most tediously small sock in the history of tedious knitting endeavours. He was determined to make a set of beautiful baby things for Luna. Committed. Maybe a little obsessed, sure. He could admit that to himself.
“It’s sweet how nervous you are.” Luna said embarrassingly. “Isn’t it lovely how similar the old fidelius ceremony is to modern nuptials? Is that why you look as though you want to run? Are you getting cold feet?”
Finally removing the parchment wrapping, the knitted items fell into Harry’s lap and he stared at them for a long while before looking up.
“What if they’re out of tea or something? You can’t not have tea, what kind of British child is born into a house without tea—”
He fell asleep that night hearing the gentle rustling of wings in the hall.
They looked nearly lethal— whatever he was using was causing a mass buildup of magnesium in his system. How did Sprigg miss this? What did the muggles call it? Opiates?
Harry had hiked all morning to find the right tree. A proper conifer. Tall enough to reach up into the rafters of their little home, thick at the base with plenty of space for tinsel and lights, and fragrant, like Christmas should be. Harry had always loved the smell of fir trees - the Dursleys had always had a fake plastic Christmas tree, that Harry of course was in charge of setting up, but never touching again. His first memory of a proper smelling Christmas had been his first winter holiday he stayed at Hogwarts, the infusion of cheer and joy and his first memories of what family felt like were all deeply soaked in the aroma of fir, and fire, and treacle tart.
“He’s not even listening, is he?”
“No.” Said Draco. “I applied for a year’s research sabbatical. I’m here to study the unicorn herds.”
“What is it?” He asked, panting slightly, pulling back, his flush face looking concernedly at Draco. Draco, who couldn’t think, stared helplessly back at Harry, mouth moving soundlessly, unable to say what it was he wanted. Needed.
Draco remembered the last time he was here, and his panicked flight, and took several soft steadying breaths, not wanting to wake Harry just yet. This was an exercise in just being. Sitting with the discomfort in favor of growing past one of his hangups.
“He came to me to help, sure that his new powers could be of use, but unsure of ways to use them. I offered him the binding ritual, offered him the opportunity to avenge his friend’s deaths. Make his wasted time in Azkaban worthwhile. I offered him the chance to destroy Voldemort in exchange for his own life. He agreed. He wanted to be of use, you know. And, he asked me to bind him to his ancestral home. Afraid that he might hurt others without magic keeping him there.” He stopped pacing, body turned towards Harry, his face imploring. Willing Harry to understand. To see why things had happened the way they had.
“That’s enough Miss Francine.” Juniper interjected from her desk as Draco rolled his eyes and motioned for Harry to follow him down the hall. Harry leapt eagerly from his seat, dropping the magazine and avoiding everyone’s eyes.
He turned his attention to Harry, who was chopping wood off to the side of his house. He was getting stronger, and, with regular meals, he wasn’t looking so wasted and pale. He was regaining the bronze glow of his dark skin and his thin body, once hardened by years of auror training, was beginning to redefine itself. Harry’s hair was also becoming long, much more wild. It was a mangled sweaty mess plastering itself to his forehead and the back of his neck and Draco was struck with a desire to push it off of his face.
Harry was lucky most of the raids he was called in for happened in the morning. He’d show up, run into the chaos, fake a few spells or feign an early injury, congratulate Ron with a slap on the back, and head back to the office by lunch time. Other times, he declined going on the raid at all. By the early afternoon, he’d be shaky and feel his magic panting in his ear for another round. It was easy enough to shrink his kit and keep it hidden, lock himself in the bathroom and give himself a taste to keep the edge off for the afternoon, at which point, he would happily do mindless paperwork until his eyes bled. Sometimes, if he loaded enough, even a dopey smile sat placidly on his face.
may be, that those born in the caul are— Special. Seers, sometimes. That they walk between worlds.” She eyed him speculatively. “Don’t think I haven’t noticed your little leathery friends outside. Did you know I could see thestrals before I ever witnessed my first death?”
“Yes, but, what does that
“It’s not good for me.” Harry said softly, looking back up to meet Draco’s gaze. “The stress, the constant fear of dark magic, always feeling like I’m on a hunt that never ends. That there’s danger everywhere. I don’t want to live like that. I want to be happy.”
“Well, you know, Unspeakables under a certain clearance rank aren’t allowed in certain areas or access to certain information, it’s something you earn over time. And, obviously, I hadn’t been promoted to that level yet— never realized how deep the secrets went. After the three of us with Kingsley carefully combed through all the bylaws pertaining to the DoM, we managed to find a few loopholes that allowed us to audit and investigate the department. We found some compelling evidence to present to the Wizengamot, and we were able to pass some bills that granted us access to, well—
Harry didn’t say anything and Draco couldn’t decide if he was relieved for the space or desperate for Harry to break the silence.
After that day, he started seeing Voileami in the strangest places. Constantly. And every time he encountered her, he was too afraid to reach out to see if she was real. Too afraid to ask others if they could see thestrals. Too afraid to tell anyone, lest it be confirm he really had lost the plot.
“Yes— when I fell pregnant with Rose, I was in the hospital weekly after 12 weeks. Midwives and Healers keeping a close eye, but I had none of the early bleeding that I had had with the previous two, and the 20 week mark came and went without anything. I gave birth in St. Mungo’s just in case. Ron wanted a home birth, but, well— I felt better there, after everything that had happened." She shrugged, trailing off.
He was a healer, and he would heal Lucius. Perhaps it would be healing for himself, as well.
He felt small in that moment, admitting how bad things were. How scared he was that the cravings, the thoughts, the urges would be more than he could handle. Especially now, without Draco. His heart stuttered in his chest at the thought of Draco. Push it down, he thought, not now. I can’t think about him. Not now.
“Luna asked me for your work schedule.”
“Why Regulus?” Draco asked, “I didn’t think you ever knew him? He died before we were born.”
Draco repressed a grin, trying to not let on how light headed and nervous this conversation was making him feel. He had the very inappropriate urge to laugh. Get it together Draco, he thought to himself. Don’t. Make. It. Weird.
“What would you like to do to celebrate?” Harry asked quietly in Draco’s ear, and he was sure Harry didn’t miss the way Draco shivered in response.
He let Harry practice a round on him, a simple smile crossing his face as Harry pushed what they had prepared. He untied the bit of rubber tubing they’d used as a tourniquet, and watched as the barman slumped back against the wall, his eyes falling half closed. Harry’s mouth was wet with envy.
January 27, 2009
“Tell me,” she said, “how was your last 24-hour call? And, did you manage to get through the ordeal without strangling Sprigg?”
Harry debated slipping the coaster and whatever was beneath it into his pocket. His experience with cocaine hadn’t been very positive. He didn’t like how his heart raced and his thoughts got even louder. He already had enough adrenaline in his day to day life, what with the flashbacks and the startling so easily, and the fact that his job as an Auror put him in constant mortal danger. However, on the plus side, he had managed to keep an erection, fuck someone and orgasm, even if it did end in confusing thoughts of Malfoy and his wallet being stolen. Harry swallowed.
The rest of the large room was filled with a wood fire stove, a plush sofa, and rustic but well-stocked kitchen, and a cabinet of assorted alcohol. It wasn’t what Draco would call messy, but it certainly wasn’t to his exacting standards of organization.
“Don’t thank me, just owl the woman your schedule so she can get on with her we-love-Draco-Malfoy campaign.” Unice laughed. Draco knew she found Luna odd, but captivatingly charming. He really loved his friends.
As his fingers moved across the forest scene, thestrals began to emerge among the trunks and lower branches, shaking their heads and beating their wings, gold filigree unfurling from their manes, down their withers, across their scalloped hip bones and into their tails. Harry could imagine their screeching nickering, so familiar to him now, and a smile ghosted across his lips.
Draco groaned aloud, a mixture of relief and exasperation rolling through him. “Not again—” He sighed into the empty room. He was thankful that he wasn’t being called in for his own mishaps, yet unsettled that he was needed to post bail for Greg, again. This was the fourth time since Christmas.
Draco walked back to his office feeling exhausted after his 24 hour shift, but pleased that he had been able to chat with Unice before leaving.
Draco, conversely, sat perched on the edge of his seat, still as can be, his stomach roiling with unsettled magic and nerves as McGonagall aggressively offered him tea and a ginger nougat. Harry was snickering and watching the exchange fondly. Relenting, Draco nibbled on his nougat, too aware of the sound of his own chewing.
Draco, he was sure, would be mortified. Harry couldn’t help the small smile that crept around the corners of his mouth as he imagined Draco’s deadpan stare as Harry recounted this to him later that evening, likely while the two of them had a quiet dinner—God, Harry hoped it was Indian food again— maybe even after dinner over their requisite tea? Or, perhaps Harry ought to save this particular story for after that still, when they were warm and safe in bed together, one of Harry’s favorite moments of the day, where he’d run his hands along Draco’s skin and distract him from his knitting.
Draco was leaning against him now, melting into his chest, worries all tumbling out around them and falling away in the warmth of the cabin and the sureness of Harry’s touch.
Draco woke with a start, the fear from the dream— the memory— gripping him. He was cold, he wasn’t wearing any clothes and the blankets had been tangled around them in a haphazard pile. He was suddenly starving. Ravenous. Remembering what it felt like to be so famished yet so incapable of eating. He crept over a softly snoring Harry, drooling peacefully on his pillow, and dressed quickly in the dark, cold cottage.
Grimmauld Place was no longer a dilapidated war-time headquarters, no longer an abandoned ancestral home, tomb of bigots and blood supremacists, prison to Sirius, shrine to Regulus. It was a clean slate, ready for new life, a new purpose. Inoculated with Harry’s magic and own story of rebirth, it was a new era for the ancient wizarding home. Draco couldn’t have felt more pride in Harry’s work.
Draco had been surprised when Greg, Neville, and Unice had all walked into Luna’s kitchen over the next hour bearing congratulations and proud smiles. Luna made veg korma and samosas, Greg brought Draco’s favourite brownies, Neville brought his homemade nettle and cranberry cordial, and Unice brought flowers for Draco.
Draco’s eyebrows raised significantly in interest.
Draco was walking down the dingy servant’s passage to the kitchens, briskly, his ears straining for the sound of anyone following him. Of Lestrange’s shuffling gait. Of Greyback’s stomping warpath. He’d barely eaten in days, too consumed with the horrors of the manor, the Dark Lord having taken to using meal time to feed his snake for all to watch.
They both paused a moment, contemplating what kind of fallout that would have caused, before they both chuckled softly, the fire burning merrily in the hearth, Harry slipping his arms around Draco’s middle, pulling him closer, breathing in the smell of cherry cordial and fir.
Hestia had picked only black dahlias that day, twisting them together into a fervent deep red ring. The crown upon her braided hair had blended beautifully with her skin, and she seemed to Harry to be made of nothing but the depths of the earth itself. Of pain, regrown and reformed into stunning, silken beauty, raw and powerful.
Smith spoke up in his place. “No, sir, we accept the sentence.”
“If anyone has a pure and undamaged soul, it’s Hagrid. The man is a saint.” Harry said fondly. “The unicorns can probably sense it.”
It was then that Harry had stood, her words still settling in the air of their meeting room, finding space amongst all the other secrets and fears of other stories shared before. He had taken the opportunity to head to the kitchen for a cup of tea. Mint. With honey. The tiny silver spoon clinked against the ceramic, so loud in the quiet of the empty kitchen, only populated by himself and his thoughts.
Harry finished laying out all the bits and pieces for the mysterious s’mores they were about to participate in, and then he began scanning the ground for something Draco couldn’t see. “What are you looking for?”
“You said there were people trapped down there.” Harry interjected, interrupting Draco’s musings. Plots. Rekindled animosity for the silver, singled horned cretins. “Who? Who did you find? Were they okay?”
Harry huffed, still looking down at his dirty hands. She was right. And, what’s worse is that she knew exactly what she was talking about. For all the differences in the lives that Harry and Sylvia had led, both of them had been seduced by the painkilling powers of heroin.
Robards wasn’t even looking at him, his eyes downcast at the pile of folders in his arms, distracted from whatever he was about to say and, apparently, oblivious to the tension he had caused.
He stretched his legs from beneath him and stood, the thestral reaching out his giant wings away and above Harry’s form, also slipping it’s forelegs out into the snow and gingerly raising it’s skeletal form, the great slopes of his hip bones and knobs of each vertebra sliding below his coal colored skin. With one last forlorn look at Harry, the glassy eyes impassive as always, the thestral snorted softly and started off to the North, picking it’s way through the unmarked snow.
Right. A hero.
As he closed the door behind him, Harry could hear Draco frantically casting cleaning and freshening charms, could feel his frenetic energy. He smiled to himself, and conjured water for the old claw-footed tub, lighting a small fire beneath it to warm it up. He knew he wouldn’t mind it scalding. Let it try to burn me, he thought. Let it try.
“Hermione! I’m here! No need to raise hell!” Harry slid in his socks across the wooden floor and into the living room, coming to a haphazard halt as he nearly knocked over a coffee table covered in books.
Harry could feel Draco smiling against his chest.
Harry had woken up as Draco was starting breakfast and offered to help. He probably expected to be shot down as he had been every time he offered to help Draco over the last week, and seemed elated when Draco accepted. Much to Draco’s dismay, and exhilaration, they ended up dancing around one another in the small kitchen the entire time.
above them. 11:30pm.
Harry’s look of pensive confusion changed into one of wide eyed bewilderment and dawning realization as they continued to stare back at Draco, and Draco tried his damnedest not to panic and run.
The pop of apparition made him nervous for the first time that day. Butterflies swarmed in his stomach and he couldn’t help the smile that spread across his face.
So, he thought of flying. Which clearly didn’t work.
The summer before his 6th year had been full of shocking revelations, one of which was that he would never be safe in his childhood home again. Another, was that he was entirely responsible for his own safety. The adults in his life could do nothing to keep him safe.
Yes, Sprigg had specialized in blood curses. yes, he was a perfectly capable healer. But, he didn’t have the double mastery in potions that Draco had earned in France. And, his dismissal knowledge of muggle haematological concepts and their uses in blood magic just made Draco want to rip the man’s larynx out. Especially, specifically, when that oversight and unearned pride put muggleborns in danger due to inept care.
Harry barked out a laugh at the memory of the note Draco had left him in his Quintessence of Debauchery, a little roughly drawn Hogwarts delivery owl hooting out an unmistakably clear announcement that Harry was, indeed, without a doubt, gay - his official notice. It had been so kind of him, thoughtful, and that just was Draco. He was like that, now.
“Come on then. Let’s break for tea.” Malfoy closed the conversation and stalked back into the cabin.
The kettle had started whistling and Draco was back by the bed, changing into something warmer than his nightshirt and pants. “There are no guarantees in life or birth.” He intoned absently, the phrase coming to him easily. It was a mantra that had been repeated to him during his training days in school, something the midwives and birth attendants always said in response to unanswerable questions and unknowable futures.
He was slumped, curled up with his face against the corner between the wall and the door for what felt like hours. The voices had faded into the background, and the dark linen cupboard, reminiscent of his own childhood cupboard, was full of the sounds of his own tremulous breaths. His hands were throbbing now, the blood having dried around the edges of his ragged fingertips, still full of chunks of wood, the splinters lodged deep against bone.
And Harry felt as though the ice that had been snaking around his insides had seized his heart. Fear trickled through him. He knew so acutely what Hestia described. The pain, the terror of forgetting - leaving behind those who no one else was carrying. Memories that could die with him. For Dennis, it was Colin, but for him, it was Sirius.
Flea leaned his face close to Harry’s chest, nickering softly, a growling rumble, full of the joy of his feast. He nudged Harry, strands of clotted blood from his forelock latching on to the soft cotton of his shirt, creating stringy threads, a bridge, between them.
“I’m working on it, Harry—” He said quietly, feebly, trying to make up for his dithering. “I’m working on my trauma. We can—” he trailed off, not knowing how to end the thought but not wanting Harry to think they could never be a normal couple because of him and his endless baggage.
“So aside from pulling carriage, and having a great sense of direction, what else do thestrals do?” He asked, looking sideways at Draco.
The man laughed, deep and hearty, throwing his head back, the bones around his neck glinting in the firelight.
, Draco was not ready for a charming Weasley.
Pulling himself from his maudlin spiralling, he began his checks with several of his
“Potter, what the fuck happened?” He asked, his eyes wide and eyebrows subsequently lost in his hairline.
“It was Sirius’s.” Harry croaked out, sounding suspiciously like he was on the verge of tears. “But I… I ruined the memory of him in it.” Harry brought his hands up to his face and pressed the heels of his hands into his eyes, breathing deeply, obviously struggling to keep himself together.
.” Draco insisted, overcome with want, with nerves, resting his forehead on Harry’s.
Harry stared as she tapped out the contents of the plastic baggie onto her hand, her palm to her chest, loading the depression just beyond the base of her thumb. She brought it up to her nose and snorted greedily. Her smile big and bright, she tapped out a second hefty helping of the white powder and offered it to Harry.
Harry didn’t respond. He didn’t seem satisfied with that answer, but he didn’t press it. He just sat there fidgeting with the twigs and wet leaves strewn around him.
“But, you worked there for years, Hermione, how did you not know any of this before?” Harry asked, looking even more boggled.
Draco just gawked at him, “What in Godrick’s name does that even mean?” Draco realised the slip too late, Potter’s use of the Gryffindor founder’s name when he swore having obviously rubbed off on him. Fuck.
“Not a word.” Harry said, looking solemn, drawing a cross over his heart with his finger like a small child solemnly swearing.
His body was thrumming with it, and it took him several more silent seconds to swallow down the pull, the hunger.
In Nigerian traditions, the born-and-die-people were often a reference to stillborn children or miscarriages, even babies who died shortly after birth or early in childhood, but Hermione had found older legends, legends from the forest tribes that spoke of mediators of death, those who had been marked for it, those who walked in and out of the dark places of the forest with death-beasts as guides. Those who had guarded against the deaths of others.
or your mother— or being seen in public with the two of you. It’s a small parlour, we’re going to a private table, it’ll be
Harry dropped his head into his hands. “I couldn’t Ron. I couldn’t.”
Draco huffed an affirmative nod and looked away. Unable to continue staring into eyes that saw right through him, right through his constructed confidence. Harry chuckled and pulled a now limp-limbed Draco into his arms and breathed him in, holding him tight. The two stood there holding on to one another, limbs woven together, half dressed, and completely rumpled.
“Did something happen? Did you dream about something?” Luna’s face was professionally impassive, but Harry’s cheeks instantly darkened and he pulled his sprawled legs back toward himself, at her completely innocuous question.
people. Couldn’t they see that? He would rather be sacrificed— throw himself head first into a pit of blast-ended skrewts and be eaten alive— rather witness the return of Voldemort. Why wouldn’t they believe him?
March 18, 2008
After a moment of collecting himself, settling the nerves that had crept up on him, he walked up the creaky porch steps and under the barren trellis. Closing the heavy door behind him he heard whispers from the kitchen, saw a faint light coming from down the hall where he knew Luna and Greg’s room sat.
“You okay, Perce?” Ron asked, reaching out and squeezing his shoulder. Percy smiled a bit sadly and shook himself, nodding.
“Both?”
“Do you need some help?” Draco offered.
Hermione gasped. “Harry that’s it! Your healing power!”
Draco didn’t know what to say. He didn’t save his father, her husband. He let him die. His thestral had dashed Lucius’s last hope.
“Is— Are they— is everything fine?” Harry asked breathlessly into Draco’s shoulder. Draco, who could do nothing else but shake his head and squeezed harder.
“That was amazing.” Harry huffed, looking thoroughly disheveled and brimming with happiness that he directed at Draco.
“No, really—“ Harry continued, reaching out and taking Draco’s hand. “I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately. There’s a lot of societal pressure— I mean— even in the literature that we read—” Harry waggled his eyebrows at Draco, clearly thinking of Herbert and Gable, and Draco snorted a reluctant laugh. “Well, I just don’t think it’s a necessary part of— of—” He was moving his hand in a circular motion by his face, casting about for the right words.
“I suppose.” He said. Feeling a bit lost, and a bit stupid for over-exaggerating.
“Luna.” He sighed, feeling relief at the sight of her, moving forward to be enveloped in her arms. Hoping that she could somehow ground him. Keep him from evaporating.
Voileami had appeared silently behind Draco, her ears pinned back staring at Harry, clearly very irritated by the display. Draco touched her neck gently for reassurance.
Harry’s eyes opened wide for a moment, before snatching the paper and saying “
He didn’t know how long he stood there, under the water, drowning out his despair. When he got out, he wrapped a towel around his waist and padded into the kitchen for coffee. Not for the first time, Harry added a healthy dash of whiskey in his mug to help him get through the day.
“Yes.” Malfoy said simply. He took a sip of the scalding tea and made a face as if he had forgotten it would be so remarkably hot. “I didn’t want to take the letters for you to read, in case you wanted… solitude. While you figure things out, anyway.”
Harry clenched his jaw. Teddy must have noticed how angry it had made Harry, to hear these stories, bullying and hurting kids just for their size. For their magical talent, or lack thereof.
He needs a place to bury it.
A sudden, loud banging jerked him from his stupor and he jolted upright. He had warded his flat to hell and back against any visitors, so, who the fuck had managed to get to his door? His first thought was of Harry, who was certainly powerful enough to get through Draco’s wards, but he didn’t think he’d know where to find Draco, as he had been nearly dead when Draco had first brought him there.
Draco was completely flabbergasted by Harry’s concern. He had never had anyone shout at him because they were worried about his well being like this before. He had no idea how to feel about it. Or even how to respond.
Harry was lucky most of the raids he was called in for happened in the morning. He’d show up, run into the chaos, fake a few spells or feign an early injury, congratulate Ron with a slap on the back, and head back to the office by lunch time. Other times, he declined going on the raid at all. By the early afternoon, he’d be shaky and feel his magic panting in his ear for another round. It was easy enough to shrink his kit and keep it hidden, lock himself in the bathroom and give himself a taste to keep the edge off for the afternoon, at which point, he would happily do mindless paperwork until his eyes bled. Sometimes, if he loaded enough, even a dopey smile sat placidly on his face.
“I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have pushed.” Neville had the decency to look sheepish.
Draco reached around to grab Harry’s cock, hanging heavy between his legs, and pressed his own between Harry’s cheeks. Harry nearly sobbing with relief, a half hysterical laugh at the new sensation, the new contact. Draco stroked Harry in time with the movements of his own hips him. Harry pushed himself up on his elbows to give Draco more room to manoeuvre his hand over his cock. Pushing himself back in time with Draco’s thrusts. Together they moved in an exceedingly frantic manner. Racing to the end.
Draco didn’t push the issue and they finished their evening in peaceable conversation while Draco’s insides did odd things that made him feel a little nauseous and excited at the same time, catching himself smiling every time Harry’s back was turned. Harry didn’t seem to have any more questions about being gay, but nothing else needed to be said.
“Great.” He said. “This way.” And, he nodded his head to another path and indicated for Draco to follow. Draco followed but had lost his ability to speak. His palms were sweaty and he was wondering if it would be rude to turn around and
“What don’t you want?”
He was proud of it, when he finished. It was a gift of love, and he knew that it would be a gift for both Ron and Hermione too, equal parts fun and safe. They’d be delighted. Harry was only a little envious he wouldn’t be there to see her putter around on it for the first time.
Thinking of Draco, though trying to school his thoughts away from all of the heretical fun he wanted to have with him, Harry flipped to the third page of the paper to find a little column on the trial, written by none other than Dennis Creevey. It was kind, supportive and very fair, roundly condemning Lestrange and uplifting those who had spoken against him, as well as those who had hissed their dissent from the spectator stands. It applauded the witnesses without throwing the details of their testimony on display for the masses to consume. Respectful and poignant.
He rolled his shoulders again, spasms of tightness and a gnawing, clawing feeling of unease, tremors of his magic made his grip tighten reflexively before he consciously demanded they open again. The ache he felt, across his back, along his spine and shoulders and wrapped around his very core, was maddening. Tremulous and insistent, it was loud, louder than his thoughts, and he was reduced to nothing but swarms of insects beneath his too tight skin, buzzing to and fro, making honeycombs out of his bones. A hive. Thriving. Dripping in the nectar of the bees.
Draco didn’t acknowledge her. He and Harry shared a look before setting off, marching down the long brick road, Narcissa trailing after them. Their collective magic buffeting them against the onslaught of cold wind and despair.
“Forced proximity?” Harry echoed. “Is this really forced?”
Draco snorted fondly as he walked towards him. So much, and yet not much, had changed in the intervening years. Their love had grown and matured, as had their wiggentree. It was stronger, solid like the bedrock on which their home sat.
Harry didn’t respond he just found Draco’s hand and squeezed it tight, pulling Draco behind him.
, of things that he had been brave enough to write down and send away at a distance but never brave enough to voice aloud or in person. Of things he had seen Harry read with lust raw on his face. Passages circled and highlighted. Underlined.
“Bunk beds? Really? What are we, twelve?” Harry was going for scathing, but not having enough energy to get there.
___________
“I didn’t raise you to turn your back on family, Draco.” She said, her words enunciated sharply to wound as well as to fight past the chablis in her system.
His one bed and one reading chair, cupboards with instant noodles, they were enough for him. Every now and then he told Hermione he had plans to renovate Grimmauld Place and move back in there, but he knew it was another lie. He wondered if they would ask him to leave ever, or if they’d just let him waste away in his single room in the shadow of their happiness.
, he thought,
“When did you receive it?”
“Oh Helena’s left tit. I’ve missed a stitch.” There was a clattering sound as Draco threw what had looked like the beginnings of a tiny sock onto the table, heaving himself to his feet. He was wearing that maroon top that Harry loved so much, and his blonde hair was sticking up at an odd angle in the back.
“Ok.” Harry said softly, and cleared his plate from the table.
“I’m not even gracing that with a response.” Draco said, rolling his eyes and taking the book from Harry. He grimaced at the explicit etching before closing it and setting it on stack for unicorn research. “Mother sent me all the books the manor has to offer on unicorns as well as thestrals.”
“He’ll be ok, Harry.” Hestia’s voice was a balm, a soft and reassuring touch, but Harry could clearly see the sadness that crossed her face. She had a heart that could hold love for everyone she’d ever met and all the living souls in between.
He reached out and unfurled the bit of parchment.
Draco was listening with such rapt attention that he almost missed the sad smile Hermione and Ron exchanged with one another. The unspoken sorrow that passed between them as they both made to touch some part of their child as she mindlessly gnawed on a mushy stalk of eggy broccoli.
So, here he was, apparating back to the stoop of Grimmauld Place, his pockets heavy and his thoughts light for the first time in what felt like forever. The berg adder on the door huffed and puffed at him, as usual, his tongue flicking as he berated Harry “
“I know some people deserve that place—” Harry said, looking troubled. “But not all crimes are created equally.”
Say that he really did love that
” Draco asked in mock horror, stifling his laughter. “Honestly, Longbottom, what do you think I’ll be doing out there?”
Malfoy looked up at him, his face impassive, expression unreadable. “Good. then I’ll need your help today with something.” He replied, simply.
“Indeed, I do.” Draco smiled, turning back to his work, enjoying the lingering feeling of Harry’s hand on his shoulder before Harry turned and walked to the kitchen to make them tea.
“Come on, I’ll make tea.” Malfoy said, stretching his arms above his head, revealing a small strip of his back to Harry as he walked back toward the house. Harry shook his head, trying not to focus too hard on the fact that Malfoy had dimples, his lower back tapering down between the muscles of his spine and his sacrum.
Blood Magic
What the fuck had he done? Why did he push himself on Harry? Harry, who was just as scared of their intimacy as Draco. Harry, who had never kissed a boy before. Draco dropped his head in his hands, gripping his hair painfully, and cried out into the empty cottage. Little dipper hooting softly at Draco in response.
He looked across the field, past the well, to the stone lauder Harry and he had built together into a small hill by the forests edge a few years back—when the kitchen just wasn’t big enough to hold all of their garden treasures and potion ingredients. Little things here and there that marked the passage of time, marked their growth, together.
______________
Draco shook his head. “They do walk between worlds— they just bring people here instead of sending them on their way. They’re the otherside of the coin.”
The nausea was building. His abdominal muscles were taught, he hunched over, pulling around himself, his vertebrae spreading, fanning wide and pointed and poignant, hidden beneath Harry’s leather jacket.
Like Hermione said, she could only locate ten other Death Herders in five other locations where Thestral herds were strong and the forests were healthy. The Great Bear Rainforest in Canada, Diepwalle in South Africa, Linzhi in Tibet, Waipoua in New Zealand, and one small herd and a single pair of herders left for the entire Amazon.
“Can I help you?” he asked, feeling bemused, reaching out to stroke her face as he had done so many times before.
After what felt like an eternity, or maybe it was only 20 minutes, Draco finally succumbed to his body’s limitation for panicked running and collapsed at the base of an impressive oak. His body was racked with shuddering breaths as he tried desperately to draw more oxygen to his lungs. What the fuck had that been about?
Harry didn’t want to judge Ginny now. She was doing her best to forget, to move on, to exchange the years of fear for years of pleasure, and who was he to say he knew any better how to heal the wounds of the past.
for just a moment. He was struggling to focus with his father’s reminiscence about the man of importance he once was.
, he loved everything about him. His darkness and sharp edges, his radiance and resilience.
“Yes, I know, but this isn’t a simple blood replenishing potion we’re talking about, this— this requires precise timing when you add the
Harry didn’t respond. He didn’t seem satisfied with that answer, but he didn’t press it. He just sat there fidgeting with the twigs and wet leaves strewn around him.
Harry stood facing Draco and withdrew from his leather jacket’s breast pocket, a bent, once ornate, silver serving spoon. The portkey Kingsley had sent yesterday afternoon. It was set to depart at 7:30am and Draco’s insides felt simultaneously hot and writhing, yet frozen solid.
He sighed and pulled the little wooden otter he had carved from his pocket, his magic coursing from his fingers to the fine grained Black Walnut and swirling around the polished lines he had so meticulously poured over. He had spent hours enchanting the little figure, focusing all of the newfound joy and peace of his new life, all of his new feelings of freedom and the weightlessness of being carefree. It was magic he had always wanted to try, but had never found the time, or the place, or the energy to pour himself into something so complex and detailed, yet beautiful. He never would have been able to, he had realised, midway through the complex enchantments. He would have had to know these feelings to replicate them.
, thought Draco, eying her. Only the thin wrinkled skin on her hands, giving away her age. She clutched to his forearm as though she feared he may disapparate at any moment. Draco certainly considered it. “It’s so lovely today I thought we could stroll through the back gardens, and you can see the work I’ve done on the flower beds.”
No, of course not. This was entirely medical and morbid curiosity. He just needs to keep an eye on Potter to ensure he’s healing. Right?
“Yeah.” Draco said. “Still can’t figure out if its a pipe dream or not, but it does sound nice.”
The coming dusk sang with the sound of buzzing insects and chirruping frogs as he walked past the wiggentree, now towering over its corner of the garden, touching its grooved bark as he went. Wondering as he did so at the wealth of memories made beneath it’s ever reaching boughs.
“If all you can do is crawl, start crawling” Luna intoned into the silent circle, Sylvia’s grief like a glass pool in their midst. She often closed the meeting, now nearly always with the same familiar nine attendees, with odd quotes or sayings for the listeners to mull over, but this one was the first to hit Harry so clearly and profoundly - for it was just like her, and it was painfully good advice. It was, in those early days, the only advice.
“That’s when I sang to him.” Luna explained, wisely. “Helped him find his way home.”
“No!”
“Of course it was.” Harry sighed. “Why does
She shrugged, smiling softly. “The colour looks off. Pearl dust seems like it would fix it.”
The embers in the grate glowed and in the distance a thestral cried out into the cold clear night.
“If his service was willing, then why use dark magic to keep him?” Harry’s voice sounded cold and bereft.
, even if there were grains of truth in it.
Harry froze, startled by the admission, before turning around to see Dumbledore walking into view from the side of the painting.
Every time he thought of reaching out to Draco, he recoiled. He had started several letters, only to crumple them up and throw them into the fire. Draco, they’d always start, I nearly relapsed from the stress. Ron had to come collect me on an abandoned hillside with a bottle of Jameson. I’m a wreck. Again. I don’t have any control over my life, and I don’t want to drag you into the nightmare I’ve been in. Plus, I’m having the weirdest dreams. Then, without fail, they’d end with something like, but I miss you and I have not been able to stop thinking how you got me off and I want that every day until I die. Please don’t abandon me.
Hermione chuckled and offered Draco a chair in front of her desk. “The darkness is a bit oppressive out there isn’t it?”
“Your skin—”
A twig snapped behind him and he jumped. Voileami ambled through the snow amidst the trees towards the valley below, following her own path a few paces besides Draco’s own. He stood and watched her walk, a flood of uncertain feelings swirling in his midsection. He wasn’t sure what to feel towards her at the moment. He loved her, yes. She had watched over him for more than a year now, yes. She allowed him to heal people in ways that others could only dream, yes.
Sitting at his desk in the ministry, Harry watched as people scurried back and forth between meetings, briefings, interrogations and extra training sessions. He rolled his quill between his fingers on his right hand and absentmindedly reached up to rub the scar on his forehead. It didn’t hurt, and it hadn’t for years, but somehow he still felt like there was a residual feeling, something… heavy. Maybe it was just his thoughts, this time.
the one who told him that one date was too soon to put any labels on anything.” He felt an intense and slightly irrational desire to defend Harry from Pansy’s vicious, though protective, nature.
Harry should explore his newfound sexuality with someone who wasn’t terrified of intimacy, he reasoned. Someone who could enjoy sex. Someone who wasn’t covered in scars. Just as he had come to the conclusion that he wouldn’t think about getting Harry off anymore, he mindlessly pressed his hand against his raging hard on again and had to stifle another moan as Harry’s brilliant green eyes flashed across his mind.
They had reached Draco’s office, and he began changing with complete disregard to his audience who kept up her reiteration of patient information.
Draco released himself from his father’s grip, leaving his mother to say her own goodbyes. He found Harry alone in the hall, save for Flea, the aurors no where to be seen.
Draco released himself from his father’s grip, leaving his mother to say her own goodbyes. He found Harry alone in the hall, save for Flea, the aurors no where to be seen.
He gingerly rotated his ankled, testing it, before carefully pulling himself up. Voileami nickered in a pleased sort of way as she moved forward to rub her face hard against the scratchy material of his cloak. “We did what we needed to.” He affirmed and she stilled, seemingly waiting for Draco to make up his mind about something.
Draco could feel the heat rising in his face again, his palms sweaty, his heart aching, and his stomach swooping pleasantly. He could feel the pull between them, holding Harry’s gaze, his lips quirking into a smile of their own accord. “No, I suppose you didn’t imagine it.” Draco said softly.
“Okay.” Harry said softly, his arms now wrapped around his knees, which were pulled to his chest. Sylvia was gently rubbing his arm, as if to tell him to hang in there.
Draco felt himself sag in relief at the thought of postponing the inevitability of the drawing room. He used to love the back tulip gardens with its pebbled pathways and delicate water features and acquiesced to her suggestion gratefully. They chatted and strolled slowly through the corridors towards the South entrance. Halfway through the expanse of corridors his mother changed direction suddenly and pulled him towards the East wing.
And Draco was kissing him, just touching his lips to Harry’s softly, sweetly, tentatively. And Harry was right there, his hands under Draco’s shirt and running up his back, tasting his lips and his mind blank with desire, his mouth falling open, inviting something more, something deeper. He wanted it so badly.
Night Magic
“It’s an unusual circumstance because there are so few people able to access the magic of unicorns and thestrals as it is, so its not like I can gather 100 of you and see
When they reached the door to Severus’ office, she turned a softened and kind look to Draco and said, “You can have as much time as you need. No one uses this office. I’m sure you’ll want to catch up with Hagrid afterwards, so don’t feel obliged to come find me if you haven’t the time.”
. YEARS.” She shouted, a manic glint in her eye.
“It was only after he came back to England in your fourth year that I had the second occasion to speak to him. By then, whispers in the darkest forests had come to him, had hunted him. Had called him grim and many other names, and thestral herders had chased him endlessly, working to trap them as their own. By then, Sirius had come to know what he was. Cursed. And bereft for it.” Harry’s magic hummed in the air around them. He sat still save for his twitching foot, a fist jammed under his chin, his eyes hard on Dumbledore, considering.
“I don’t want to hear it.” She said gently. “What you’re doing takes serious guts, and not just the trial itself. Dealing with the press is a huge added layer of stress. And we’re going to be here for you every step of the way.”
He spent the first year of his four year probation with his head down at Hogwarts, plowing through school work like his life depended on it, which it certainly felt like it had. Draco pushed himself to be constantly busy lest he let the ever pressing reality of his experiences in the war enter the forefront of his mind and swallow him whole.
, Harry had swept past him and out the door, the crack of apparition fading on the wind.
? What is that job description, even? Keep the balance between life and death? How the fuck does one do that?”
Draco sat up and regarded him, “What’s wrong Potter, think it’s hilarious the way gay men get each other off?” His eyebrow was raised and he seemed unsure about his own defensiveness. It was a hilariously odd tale, it was a bit funny, but something about Harry laughing at it seem to make Draco incredibly uncomfortable.
?” with disbelieving incredulity.
He dropped it down amongst the carpet of wildflowers, some of the tiny glowing blue beetles buzzing away from the skin as Harry shook it out and stretched it flat to lay upon. He smiled and watched the little insects zipping off into the dusky evening, finding new homes amongst the closing flower buds.
“I’ll be right behind you.” Malfoy said, his voice steady and even, washing over Harry’s building panic, soothing him. Even if he lost control, even if he fucked up, Malfoy was here. He wasn’t going to let him do something horrendously stupid. Harry let himself think of that while he climbed the stairs. For the first time, he was doing this with someone, he wasn’t alone.
Draco startled awake, covered in sweat, sticking to his bedsheets. He bolted upright and touched the slight scars on his chest. He had dreamt of the bathroom— Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom.
To his left, a dark figure emerged, hunched, with rounded ears, it scooted through the patch of starlight and back into the tall grass. Another form followed. Then, on his right, two more creatures emerged, Harry catching glances of their spotted fur, their sloping spines. The giggling laughter and howling calls were growing ever louder, drowning out any other sounds of the night. Harry could hardly breathe for the smell of blood and rotten flesh was thick and purulent in the air.
After what felt like a searing eternity in the 9th layer of hell, Draco’s bravery and resolve broke. He stood abruptly and began clearing their plates.
“He came to me to help, sure that his new powers could be of use, but unsure of ways to use them. I offered him the binding ritual, offered him the opportunity to avenge his friend’s deaths. Make his wasted time in Azkaban worthwhile. I offered him the chance to destroy Voldemort in exchange for his own life. He agreed. He wanted to be of use, you know. And, he asked me to bind him to his ancestral home. Afraid that he might hurt others without magic keeping him there.” He stopped pacing, body turned towards Harry, his face imploring. Willing Harry to understand. To see why things had happened the way they had.
He was dazed and a little confused. After months of waiting, they had approved his wildest dreams and thought it best to tell him with an unassuming letter in his in-tray. Well, he supposed, judging by his dramatic reaction he was more than a little grateful no one had come to find him to drop this bombshell in person.
He couldn’t stop the weak smile forming on his face, feeling odd and foreign, as if he had never smiled before. He picked up his bowl of soup off the coffee table and began to eat while Luna chatted about whatever seemed to float into her mind. She talked about her relationship with Greg, about work, about her proposal to St. Mungo’s for opening an addiction counseling and withdrawal service, about her new favorite ice cream shop, the latest sighting of snorkacks, and, of course, her latest spinning project.
“Fred?” It called softly, inches away. “Fred, is that you? I’ve been looking for you everywhere. I couldn’t find you.” The voice broke into little sniffling sobs. “I’ve been looking for ages. All I want is to find you. I came to look for you.”
“Can we go in?” Asked Draco, tentative but clearly overcome with curiosity.
She rolled her eyes. “Yes, they’re very nice.” Her voice was pandering. “But, I just can’t figure out why you’ve got one tailing you. How you were able to get hair, and blood, and saliva. The others weren’t able to do that, even when prompted - really, the results of that trial in Bulgaria in 1808 were simply disastrous. People lost limbs, even.”
“What?” Draco eventually asked, his smirk faltering, beginning to bristle under the gaze of scrutiny.
Draco was listening to the orchestra of bird song in the forest mingling with the sound of a gentle breeze playing in the field flowers around them. It was a perfectly gorgeous day, and he felt gloriously content, lying there having lazy conversation with Harry.
— and the pearl dust has to be stirred—”
April 30, 2009
Draco didn’t know what to say. He knew Hagrid didn’t hate him anymore, but trusting him like this felt so... good. He smiled and nodded, looking down into his own bucket of tea, trying to reign in his excitement. Nothing was set in stone, his application was still being scrutinised, and he hadn’t even spoken to the Headmistress about staying in the forest yet. As if reading his mind, Hagrid cleared his throat to say, “Jus’ write to Professor McGonagall to ask for permission and maybe she can even write to the Ministry and Mungo’s in favour of yer research. She’d right love to see you succeed in this.”
“That’s true, you didn’t. She gave birth in the smallest corner of the room, between the wall and the bedside table, where no one could comfortably help her. Your father was a wreck— I don’t think he expected labour to be so real, so raw. He was cool as a cucumber right up until your mother vomited spectacularly on the oriental rug.” She chuckled at Draco’s startled laugh. “You were born in the caul, right onto the floor on a towel. When your mum tore the bag, you opened your eyes, but didn’t cry right away. You just looked at us, calm as you please. It wasn’t until your father started howling and crying that you joined in. But for the most part, you were the quietest new baby I ever saw.”
“Anyways.” Draco looked away quickly before he did something stupid, playing with the rim of his mug, his voice croaking. “Thank you for the talisman.”
Ron sighed sadly. “We found about a dozen people down there. One young as maybe six— oldest at about, we guess, late 70’s. All of them had their memory wiped. They don’t know a thing. No idea why they were there or what happened to them.”
Draco stumbled out of the door, pulling one of his winter boots on over his mismatching wool socks. “Merlin Potter give me a minute, I only just woke up, it’s hardly past the crack of dawn. I didn’t even get to have my tea properly before you started demanding we get a move on.”
When Harry was done doing whatever it was he was doing, he came back to where Draco stood with wide worried eyes and started pulling his own clothes back on. “I don’t think we’re alone.” Harry said quietly. “But with the charms I just put up, they won’t know we’re here.”
“No darling, it’s the rose garden I meant to show you, I’ve done some lovely work to change the space, it’s really—“
“Draco.” Harry said, closing his eyes. His name in his mouth feeling so natural, so perfect. He had thought of him as Draco for months now, but the unspoken rule that they had to be Malfoy and Potter, not Draco and Harry had always kept him at bay. Had kept that distance between them. He laced his fingers together in his own hands, determined not to ruin this chance he had been given, the invitation to be so close, to share in the quiet warmth of Draco’s bed at midnight.
“Indeed we are.” Said Persephone.
They seemed to have formed an unspoken accord. There were no expectations. No demands. No facade. Draco helped Harry, and, when Harry could, he returned the favor without comment. Whether it was waking Draco up from a nightmare or ripping out a rose bush or two, without even understanding why it was important, he did it.
He was overcome with it all.
The kitchen was an absolute disaster. Flour was spilled across one countertop, pans and burnt remnants of previously attempted dishes were piled high in the sink. Curry was smeared along the bottom cabinets where it had unceremoniously splattered as Harry ladled it into serving dishes frantically. It was astounding, but it smelled delicious, and fresh, and the final result was beautifully made and lovely food. Harry was very well pleased with himself.
, with its fat trunk and roots nearly bursting from its black and golden pot, a few rogue roots sneaking its way into its neighbour’s soil.
An older boy with sandy blonde hair and muddied trainers from the quidditch pitch had been draped across the sofa before the fire, but had rocketed to his feet at the crack of thunder.
Harry sighed with relief and grabbed his jacket from where he’d dropped it on the floor. He rubbed the back of his hand absentmindedly as he ran down the stairs and out the door to apparate to St. Mungo’s. He didn’t notice the bruise that had formed.
It was an ugly thing, Lucius’s hate. Draco sat as his father screamed and railed against him, Voileami at his side. Lucius raged at his perceived injustice, shouting that it was his god given right to be allowed the chance to live out his natural life, even if in prison, and it was now Draco’s fault he was sentenced to death. Just as it was Draco’s fault he was in prison to begin with. If only he had identified Harry that day at the Manor, Lucius wouldn’t be here, dying.
He pushed his short fringe off of his forehead with the back of his hand before resuming his attack on the perceived griminess of his countertops. He knew he was being ridiculous, he really did, but he was afraid that if he put his sponge down he would have to think about how he had left his mother standing in the corridor gaping at him like an indignant trout.
“Ok,” he said, scooting over and lifting up the quilt. “Come on, then.”
He was completely overwhelmed by affection of his friends and the fact that they had come together to support him. It made him feel that maybe he really
“Now, Mr. Lupin, Mr. Rowle has been looking for you. He forgot his inhaler in the greenhouses and is too scared to go look for it on his own. Please go and accompany him, before he has another hypoxic event. Poppy still hasn’t recovered properly from the last one.”
Again, he scribbled an affirmative response and watched it disappear from his out-tray.
“It’s okay.” Draco said kindly, trying with all his might to keep his healer mask in place. “Well, let’s start from the top. Did you enjoy having sex with that prostitute?”
Draco thought about that for a moment. He knew his results would need to be investigated and that the “why” really would be another research project entirely, but he couldn’t shake the feeling that there was something here that he needed to discover before giving his precious research over to the scrutinising eyes of others.
“Shit, is that possibility?” Harry asked, real concern lacing his words.
Harry reached his hand up and rested it on the side of Draco’s neck, his thumb gently stroking his jaw line, waiting.
The waiter came over to take their order and Draco tried desperately to compose himself, grateful for the break in Harry’s intense focus.
“What was that?!” Greg yelped, still looking shocked and slightly offended, inspecting his hand for the offending wound.
This was it, he thought, dropping his shoulders down, this is what he was waiting for - somewhere buried within he had felt an old, aching longing for himself. Somewhere, there were hints of the courageous, stubborn, lion-hearted boy who defied everyone’s expectation. Harry wanted to feel that again, to feel bold and brave and firey with determination. He wanted himself back.
“I made you something a little while ago, and I haven’t found the right time to give it to you, but I think after today I have very little reason not to do it tonight.” Harry said, reaching deep within his pocket and pulling out the tiny bit of white blonde Rowan wood he had been whittling away at for the last few months.
“Blood curses are just the beginning. I feel that there is a lot we can learn about the uses of unicorn blood once the magical stipulations are properly understood. But yes, my primary focus is in blood curses.” He said, feeling a little better at the prospect of being able to talk about work.
Feeling frustrated with the unicorns and intrigued by the unusual behaviour of the thestral, Draco gathered his things and headed back towards the cottage, mentally planning a letter to his mother.
“I thought I told you no booze.” He chastised as she clipped up the steps with far more ease than seemed possible.
Malfoy didn’t answer, but leaned back on his heels, his nice trousers covered in the rich black dirt of the little hillock the cabin sat upon. Harry could see a sigh raise and lower his shoulders.
The house of Black was dead. The only ones of their name, Regulus and Sirius, both succumbed to a bitter, unjust end. An end with no rest for their souls, no plot of their own to lay buried and mourned by their loved ones, few though they may be. No place to be at peace. In its own way, Harry thought, this house had become a mausoleum to the two brothers, the only place left to remember them, the only place their magic still lingered.
“Harry Potter!” He gasped, his eyes wide, a smile forming into a huge grin upon his face, his hands wiped across his trousers quickly as he hurried forward, his hand outstretched, his face so eager. “Such a pleasu-” A murmur, a ripple of recognition, fear bubbling into excitement, into awe. The faces turned to him became beacons of fervent whispering worship.
Ministry approval to study the unicorns.
After a pause of excited anticipation, in which they grinned slyly at one another, they moved at the same time. They lunged across the cottage, scrabbling for boots, jackets, and mittens. They were laughing and shoving each other, shouting inane threats and jeers.
His mother emerged from the room, not looking at either of them. She seemed startled by the second thestral, his milky eyes watching her doefully.
“Do you see a therapist?” Greg asked with surprise and incredulity.
“I’ve seen them before, Hestia. On someone I love. Someone...” Harry didn’t realise he was crying until she reached out to rub her thumb across his cheeks, her smile sad but knowing, his voice disappearing as he realised what he had said. He loved Draco. Loved him even after a month of silence, of separation, of filling his life with all of the ways he could move on. He loved him enough to fall apart. Maybe, even, he fell apart because he loved him and he had spent all this time pretending that whole part of him did not exist, didn’t recover alongside the rest of him, didn’t need space in himself to reclaim and find power.
“Wishful thinking, my friend.” The other jeered. “You’re just hoping to catch something that’s not a deer.”
“Father.” Draco nodded, summoning his strength from some distant place, stepping closer to the bed.
It was hours later in the garden before they spoke again.
“Hello, Hagrid.” Draco called warmly.
“You don’t say.” Harry said distractedly as he studied an etching of a blood sacrifice in one of the books. “Are you planning on sacrificing unicorns on an altar in the name of medicine?”
There, before him on the bed, facing him and far too close for comfort, lay Sirius.
“Thank
“What do you need Harry?” He asked, his voice husky, his thumb pressing back into Harry in lieu of his tongue.
The wards around him wobbled slightly. They hadn’t swayed in their usual way to indicate someone’s presence in his home, but his finely attuned senses towards magic alerted him that they didn’t feel normal. They felt stilted, uncomfortable, as if they had been momentarily
“Shh, you’re okay. You were having a nightmare.” Harry said again, moving his hand away and moving back from the bedside slowly.
Harry slipped out of bed, careful not to wake Draco, who was curled around a pillow, deep within the folds of sleep. He padded to the kitchen window, peering out into the night, the snow falling heavily now, thick and chaotic in the swirling winter winds.
There was silence for a long moment while they digested the information. Harry seemed a bit stunned that Snape apparently paid him some kind of compliment on his morality.
It was days later, in the first hint of calm after a raging and vengeful storm, that Harry found himself running swiftly along the forest floor, feet landing soft amongst the new snow, the sounds of his frosted breaths muffled in the white forest. Above him, he heard Flea let out a furious, excited screech, the sound carrying across vast stretches of dense trees. Whatever it was the thestral had become so intent on the night before was drawing near.
“I quit St. Mungo’s.” Draco’s voice was unnaturally loud in the thick hush of the greenhouse.
It had certainly helped that Potter stood up for him and his mother at their trials, unexpected as it was. Potter’s stoney face and searing green eyes telling the wizengamot that under no circumstances was Draco a real Death Eater, a bully, yes, a spoilt brat, definitely, but a child nonetheless. Potter told a breathless court room how Draco had tried to help and save him on multiple occasions putting himself at risk, that Draco had been a child that that did what they could with the cards they were dealt. Told the room how Narcissa had saved him as well. Potter sat silently during Lucius’s trial.
“Not that I’ve noticed, no.” He finally picked his head up from his hands and tried to regain some dignity.
Draco just stared at him in what looked like wary confusion, then sadness, before saying, “Harry, I can’t move in with you.”
“Well, we can’t start without him, dear. Won’t you and Neville go and get him? I’m sure he’s a wreck. He doesn’t handle much stress well, you know.” Luna snuggled up in her bathrobe against Greg, who was marveling at a mince pie he’d nicked from Ron’s supply. He gave Ron a thumbs up.
, he thought, and tore the envelope open to read the damage.
“Harry— how did they get in? What are they doing?”
Because true defense against the dark arts is just that. Bonds of friendship. Love. It’s the most powerful magic in the world, and it saved Harry. It saved him time and time again, and it will save him far into his future. Because darkness isn’t defeated alone. Darkness is drowned out of the circle by the light of many faces and the warmth of many beating hearts. Together.
“What Harry and I get up to is none of your concern. You can get your gossip from the Prophet like everyone else.” He snapped angrily. “As for the thestrals, I’ve told you repeatedly that I quit my research to focus on real
Hagrid beamed and shook his head. “It’s right important what yer doin’ and I wouldn’t trust anyone else to do it. Yeh wouldn’t hurt the unicorns and ye’ll find ways to help others with yer work.”
Fuck. How do you explain to someone that you simultaneously crave the kind of interaction they had last night and find it fucking terrifying enough to run screaming into the distance? Draco thought back to what it felt like to have someone in his arms, to have that casually intimate contact. There had been no expectations, no ulterior motives, no pressure. It had felt so nice.
The tea tray lay long forgotten as Harry flipped through the pages of The Adventures of Gable and Herbert and began reading aloud, doing the voices and all .
Draco stopped in the doorway to survey the newly acquired baby gear, as Luna waddled away down the passage to the kitchen. “Are you building that crib yourself, Greg?” He asked in a slightly teasing voice.
He already wished he was back at Tenebris Hollow with Harry. They had had such a beautifully cozy morning together. After waking up next to him, and not panicking, Draco had felt more confident in himself and oddly more comfortable with his attraction to Harry. It didn’t need to be so scary, it didn’t need to feel like an out of control beast. They could coexist with their feelings and be okay.
Draco’s apprehension for the evening was reaching a crescendo when the door open and in waddled a very large Luna followed by Greg looking as though ready to catch her should she suddenly topple over.
Draco felt himself blush even more and he couldn’t stop smiling like a complete idiot. It was too much. He was filled with immense relief that Harry didn’t expect more, but the jumpy tension in his stomach wouldn’t dissipate. He was completely out of his depth.
“Okay, so now Draco can explain to you what we’re going to do.” He smiled and looked to Draco who had to take a moment to try and subtly wipe his eyes on the back of his hand before clearing his own throat and saying. “Right, well. Yes— what Harry said, thank you for being here— I don’t think I can even adequately say how grateful I am to you all—” he said with a wavering voice.
All of the lights in the house were out save for the dim glow of a few candles in his office. He thought that whoever was here must presume Draco to be asleep upstairs or out of the house. Perhaps he was being burgled? Teenagers come to steal potions or cash.
“When does she want you there?” Harry said, watching Draco readjust the maroon sweater to cover his shoulders, distracted by the skin beneath them, by the way he had become so brave. Harry wondered if the sorting hat could take a peek inside their heads now, what it would say. Where it would sort them.
Harry’s magic pulsed with alarm as Ron stood up quickly, knocking the cubicle wall as he stood and turned, likely to hand in the paperwork they had been working on. Harry shoved down the panic that had risen, ripping him from his memory of the forest to stare at the fire that had erupted in his empty coffee mug, though, to be fair, it was often more whiskey than coffee these days. He doused it with a quick
____________________
Ominous, thought Draco. Greg only ever asked him to his favourite cake place when he wanted a favour. But he didn’t like how they had left things at the Ministry after Draco had bailed him out. Greg had been embarrassed and didn’t want to hear Draco’s suggestion that he get help.
…The right person, Draco thought, as an image of their patronuses popped into his mind, and he smiled against Harry’s chest. He was such a berk. Of course Harry thought it was because they were touched by death, and maybe he was right, maybe they weren’t soulmates, maybe they weren’t in love. Maybe Draco had outed himself for no fucking reason. But, hearing the admission from Harry that he felt the same way had elated him.
“D’you think— if maybe— if I got a wand and a tutor, I could sit the OWLs eventually?” He asked meekly.
When he walked back out of the loo Harry was setting the table and serving up his homemade Indian food.
_______________
Harry’s heart pulled with the guilt. He had missed his goddaughter being born. Rose. What a beautiful name. They must be so happy.
They weren’t running, and they were going to be okay.
Harry paused for a moment, pulled in by the astounding familiarity of it. By the fond memories. The sense of belonging.
“That’s kind of what we’ve been doing for years.” He pointed out.
Harry looked expectantly at Draco with worried eyes and a creased brow.
Irritating hero-complex aside, Sprigg also looked down on Muggle science and health advancements with maddening superiority. Honestly, how did he get off treating Draco like a muggle-hating bigot when he himself was worse than half of the blood supremacists? Draco loved muggle science.
Harry awoke suddenly, the sliver of the moon high in the sky beyond the window of his work room.
. He was leaving his little desk behind for Juniper, as well as a few pads of post-it notes.
“Ah yeah.” Hagrid nodded. “Blood curse’ is a nasty business, I tell yeh.” They chatted amiably as they walked through the grounds. They rounded the walk up to the hut and Draco felt flooded with nostalgia and anxiety at being in this place again. Images of happy school days and battle flickering together in his mind’s eye. He felt for the post-it note in his pocket, the past is in the past, and stepped up into Hagrid’s hut.
He rolled onto his back and kicked the tangle of sheets from his feet, laying his right hand across his stomach, fingertips just below his navel, draped across the dark trail of hair that bisected his abdomen, feeling each deep breath, concentrating on each slow, though unsteady, inhale. His left came up to rub across his face, pushing his hair away from his dampened forehead. He was breathing heavily, despite having been asleep, and he was fighting to regain some composure.
Harry just continued to watch him speculatively, sipping his mint tea. Draco suddenly realised he must be worried. About him. The git.
Blood was starting to rush in Harry’s ears, the noise drowning out his ability to think clearly.
Harry pulled the wing back from above him slowly and the thestral stirred, skin shivering as it shook off the thin layer of snow that had collected over him through the night. The air beyond the wing crept over Harry and he was suddenly so incredibly thankful that this creature had known to come for him. Just known. As if in response, the gentle beast shook his heavy head, breaths still creating little clouds of steam on every stoic exhale, and turned to nudge Harry softly from his side.
He let Harry’s words wash over him and let his mind wander to his thestrals. To their cave. To blood curses and the healing arts. How they each were finding their place.
’ sort of way. Yeah? We’re very capable, you know.”
“Okay, okay! Yes, you’re very capable. Fine, I’m leaving!” He threw his hands in the air, defeated. Bossed out of his own office in his own practice by a 17 year old slytherpuff in ragged jeans.
“Sometimes.” He said eventually. They were quiet for a long while. Draco had laid down as well and stared up at the leaves. “You going to tell me about your panic attack now?” Harry asked.
He paused, the wind falling across the moor, long grass waving in the fading light. Rustling. His hand was still at his side, and clouds drifted along the Western horizon.
He’d gone back to the meetings, of course, and he’d been slightly less visibly disturbed, but it had exhausted him to the core. By that Friday, he had spoken for the first time to share his morning revelation. The world isn’t split between good people and drug addicts. He had sweat just a little bit less.
Hermione took a deep breath, gathering her strength. “Before Rose was born— We both want— wanted— a large family. Ron loved having so many siblings, I had none, and loved his family— We wanted to give our children the same. Ron and I started trying two years before we had Rose. I had two miscarriages. Both at 20 weeks. Both boys.”
He stared at it, feeling terrified and elated, before finally closing the cupboard and sending this piece of himself out into the world.
“Who else was on the list?” Draco asked, trying to anchor himself to the conversation. His voice coming out gruffer than he had anticipated.
She snorted indelicately. “I didn’t realize you were so funny.”
This week, when he shows up at the bar to a round of cheers and offers of shots, Harry grins and feigns his delight, like always, but as soon as they look away and he’s following Ron to their usual booth, and his grin has dropped, replaced with a grimace. He downs two tots of firewhiskey in quick succession, feeling especially raw, waiting for the stiff drink to push the weight on his shoulders aside.
He was making his way down the little aisle between cubicles and everyone had their heads down and were focused on whatever light versus dark, death versus life versus unregistered magic violation nonsense that was neatly catalogued on each incident report page. Harry tried not to let the anger rise in him as he turned the corner and headed out into the thankfully deserted main corridor and to the staff bathrooms, his feet treading a hauntingly familiar path.
“I thought you were done with your research, what’s with all the paper?” Harry asked jovially, striding over to Draco’s workbench where he sat hunched over many sheets of parchment, letters spread out in front of him from many different senders. Harry smelled like outside, and he had brought a clean chill with him when he came in the cottage.
Draco sighed. It had been too much to hope that any of them would be spared their testimony. He could sense, rather than see, Susan’s fury. He felt Hestia’s magic now, weaving with his to strengthen the blanket of magic over the five of them. Draco fiddled with the braided garlic on his wrist and wrestled with his boggart.
Huh, he thought to himself. This may not be King’s Cross, but it seemed like a much kinder, sort of motivational waiting room. He felt a bit of comfort seep through the pain. How did he get to move on, though, if not take a train? He stopped on the last note in the row toward the kitchen, a blue one.
And with that Ron dove into the interrogation, leaving Draco with no time to panic about sharing his story with two new people.
Harry was laughing and clapping loudly with the rest, his heart soaring at the look on Thor’s face, basking in the light of his wand, in the cheers of new companions.
The humming rumble of the chant echoed in Draco’s mind and he could feel the pulse of the magic vibrating in his chest. He could feel the collective magic swirling around them, gaining momentum with each word that was spoken into the glowing blue circle. Feel the distinct presence of each person there, pouring their hearts out into the spell, just for Harry and himself.
“Healer Malfoy?” she queried hesitantly, waiting for his acknowledgement. He inclined his head in response. “There’s an urgent letter from the ministry for you, sir.” She scuttled forward and handed the heavy parchment envelope to Draco, whose expression gave nothing away.
Harry made a funny movement as if to reach for him but stopped himself and looked away— suddenly awkward. There had been many moments like this since Sylvia had died, and Draco didn’t know how to reassure Harry. How to scrub away the guilt. How to bridge the gap.
“I’ve received more of them from other areas of the world, and completed translations of a few others.” She took a deep breath and drew the first tome into her lap, sky blue and covered in gold embroidered Kanji, laying her hands flat across the cover, staring down at it.
After another two hours of amiable chit chat, Draco was feeling the tension from his flight from the Manor slowly leave his body. Neville had bid him a good evening with promises for a repeat outing in a few weeks, and Draco was counting out muggle money to leave a tip on the table before exiting his now empty booth.
He strode out of the house, the wards bending smoothly beneath his request to leave, and walked up the street on his way to the ministry. If he had looked more closely, he would’ve caught the fact that his supposedly plain black t-shirt was actually emblazoned with a since faded insignia. A dragon, guarding over a royal crown, two lions, reared up on their back legs, flanking each side. Below that, QUEEN stood out in red lettering.
Harry had encouraged Draco to go back to work, knowing that he would have too many questions, too much to think on, should he have stayed. He was like Hermione in that way. He’d need to be working, what with this new batch of scrolls and a whole four bins of untranslated Nri markings that expanded on these otherwise undescribed pieces of magical lore.
“If he was bound to you and the house, then how was he able to leave the night he died?” He ran his fingers hard through his hair, his voice low.
Leaning against the wall, arms folded and legs crossed at the ankles, was the haughty face of the seeker. Regulus. The second son of the House of Black ran one hand through his shorter hair and smiled softly at Harry.
“Joyous.” Draco shifted up on the bed to allow Harry more room, his ink bottle bobbing along beside his quill as he finished a hurried notation. Harry could hear it scratching away, punctuated by small pops and crackles from the fire.
“That’s enough of that for now—” She said, fixing Draco his tea and handing it over to him, her big blue, unblinking eyes surveying him calmly. “Tell me more about unicorn blood. Your letters were informative, but lacked depth.”
, he wasn’t breathing, Draco grabbed the naloxone from his pocket, peeled the plastic backing and shoved the device up Potter’s nose before pushing the plunger. It seemed he waited for an eternity, although it must have only been 5 seconds before Potter gasped weakly. Draco could barely feel a pulse and his breathing was irregular.
Harry pulled an apple from his pocket, having saved one from the bowl on the breakfast table that morning, just after he’d wolfed down a sizeable helping of both eggs and bacon. He sunk his teeth in and savoured in the sweet taste, sitting back on the damp earth of the path, leaning against the bed behind him. It was amazing how much he had neglected food, neglected eating, and even the simplest of flavours at their fastidiously routine mealtimes was more than just physically nourishing, it made him happy.
Turns out, the DoM had an unbelievable budget and the only records of spending were for employees. Not only did they have hidden libraries and archives deep below the ministry, but they had laboratories, many of them, fantastic in their size, terrifying in their scope. They had prison cells, too. There were people down there. Lost to the bowels of the department. Never given due process. Never heard from again.
“Oh? Everything?” He asked cutting her off, voice steely and dripping with cruel sarcasm. He knew she was drunk and that he shouldn’t rise to the bait, but he was so, so very angry.
His eyes lifted to look at the row of four bottled potions. Each containing a deep velvety liquid of royal purple. Each labeled with the specific ingredient it was testing. All of them were blood cleansing potions, but he had made them with either tail hair, mane hair, saliva, or blood. He was planning to send samples with his research to the Department of Mysteries, along with a few theory papers on other potions he thought he could make.
Harry had stumbled to his feet, but before he could cross the room to see who it was, Draco’s red, sweaty and panicky face appeared in the doorway.
And on, and on it went. Dragging Draco and his hard-earned, quiet, reputation through the mud.
It was another hour before Harry canceled their protective enchantments and marched them back to the cottage in a strict and careful silence, not a single thestral to be seen along the way. Upon reaching the comfort of their forest home, Draco went straight for his bed and hid beneath his mountain of blankets and pillows for the remainder of the evening.
Harry stood facing the closed door, his hand white knuckled around the handle, his heart pounding. He forgot to keep breathing and his vision darkened before his brainstem sent a spark of desperation that prompted him to take a deep, shuddering breath. He opened the door and slipped inside, deftly popping the deadbolt lock in place, just another daily routine now soaked in his habit.
“Sit down.” And Harry’s voice cut straight across the path of the boy with sandy blonde hair, his smile faltering, his hand pulled back toward himself, his body collapsing as he seemed to be forcibly placed back down upon the sofa, fingers now neatly folded in his lap.
Harry slumped back down in his chair, taking a deep breath.
“We can’t.” Draco said quietly into the silence, in response to their magic twining around them, it was like his new mantra he was chanting inside his head to keep him on track. To keep him strong.
“Yeah, I guess we were both pretty ridiculous.” Harry admitted. “You were pretty dramatic.”
Flea bustled forward from behind them and stepped gingerly into the pool, sinking below the surface, wading towards the cascading waters. A gentle mist permeated the edge of the natural natatorium, obscuring him slightly. Draco stepped forward, right to the edge of the water, watching.
Harry’s heart contracted painfully in his chest, the air squeezed from his lungs as his breath stagnated in his throat.
Malfoy blinked up at him, his breathing still fast and ragged. It took him several seconds  to compose himself, but eventually he swallowed, and managed a scratchy “thanks.”
“We should go.” Harry urged sharply, gripping Draco’s hand. Pulling him away from the mob of thestrals crowding around his father’s body, the mass of shiny black skin stretched tight over bones, the mob of tense leathery hides shimmering in the half light of the slit windows. Their nickering and screeching, getting louder, insistent. Draco felt his own magic rise in response like a great tidal wave of power wanting to pull him back towards his father as Harry pulled him forcefully down the hall.
“Oh, it's a muggle tool belt. You know, I can’t fix everything with magic all the time because the meetings are mixed muggle and wizard and there’s usually a bunch of muggles wandering around.”
“Well, thank you for your worries, but I’m sure I’ll be fine. I managed before.” He said, pulling his trainers on, decidedly ignoring the many thoughts of all of the things they could get up to on a hike together.
“You’re telling me you didn’t just hear Severus’s voice?” he said, desperate for confirmation that he wasn’t going insane. He knew he had heard Severus’s voice from his portrait a thousand times, but this, this felt different.
“I’ve enchanted it to protect the carrier, you, from unwanted advances. The person will feel an immense burning pain if they try and touch you when you don't want them to. Anyone. Me included.” Harry said, rubbing the back of his neck nervously, watching Draco’s face for signs of approval.
Draco huffed a laugh of affectionate exasperation in his “hullo.” Neville was just as clumsy as ever, his fond adoration of Neville cutting through his haze of macabre disinterest for a shining moment. Perhaps tonight wouldn’t be so bad. Feeling less heavy than he had since coming home, he made his way over to a Neville, who was crawling around the kitchen after rolling carrot pieces, to give him a hand.
Draco slowly swam into wakefulness with the familiar brassy sounds of jays calling outside the cottage. The sun had barely begun to rise and he was feeling deliciously warm and contented in his soft bed wrapped in blankets and … oh. Wrapped in unfamiliar limbs. Harry’s limbs. Oh, shit. Right. There was a person in his bed. Oh dear. The sudden realisation that there was a body in his bed and that he had a particular morning situation in his pants crashed over him like a bucket of ice water. Now what?!
Harry sipped his tea. “Did you ever want to do deliveries? Reproductive healthcare, I mean?”
He could feel the shimmer of Hermione’s charms ripple against his skin in the cold, see his breath forming tumultuous clouds of steam with each forceful exhale, the adrenaline making him nearly pant, the cold making him shiver. On those night watches, Harry had to focus on every little snapped twig, every whisper the wind threw up between the branches of trees that would hide him just as well as hide his enemies. He could never shake the feeling of being followed, being watched, and it ate at him in the lingering dark, the cold seeping in to his bones beneath his threadbare clothes.
Draco was bright pink now, but he had finally succumbed to a bout of very undignified giggling. “Are you going to tell me why your therapist put you on an orgasm schedule? I’ve been dying to ask, but I didn’t want to pry.”
The spoon began to glow blue in their hands, illuminating Harry’s face before him, so similar to the glow of the blue bells during their ceremony. He barely had time to consider the thought before the uncomfortable sensation behind his navel jerked his midsection forward and pulled him into a cold whirlwind gale of magic. As the forest disappeared around him he saw Voileami and Flea launched themselves into the sky.
Dennis had come by to Grimmauld Place the past two nights. They had sat together in one of the old drawing rooms. One that Harry had moved all of the furniture out of to convert to a work room, just a simple table and some old chairs. His workbench was in the centre of the room, across from the old Black family tapestry. He had spent the whole afternoon after the meeting preparing it, wiping the horrid, spiteful magic away, replacing it with his own calm and soothing spellwork, magic that stemmed from his desire to help, to heal. By the time Dennis had arrived, he had polished the ancient mahogany mantle, rubbed oil into the window panes, the eaves, the floorboards. He had tended to the room, had nourished it, and he could feel the ancient beams had craved it.
Why would it be them?
“Is what worth what?” Draco asked, temper simmering just below the surface now.
“Back when Gropie firs’ came to live in the forest… Eh, he was, well— a handful.” Hagrid looked around for the milk jug and sugar before bringing the tea to the table. “He had such a temper on him, bless him. Much better now though. Gentle as a flobberworm, he is.”
“Do you want me to stop?” Draco asked evenly, hovering over him, his one knee between Harry’s legs, both his hands on either side of Harry’s head. Not touching him yet.
“Your presence is requested, you two.”
Hermione laughed and rolled her eyes. “You’re telling me. I think the same can be said for Gryffindor.” She shuffled some papers as Draco thought about her living with the two lions, herself being a third of the golden trio, and was met with a wave of surprising and novel affection for them. For Harry, specifically. Godrick, he missed him.
He opened it carefully.
“What if she gives birth while you’re out here?” He tried, brows still furrowed.
They had reached Draco’s office, and he began changing with complete disregard to his audience who kept up her reiteration of patient information.
“Percy— I don’t mean to be presumptuous, or to speak ill of another healer, but I worked with Sprigg for years, and I spent most of that time cleaning up his mess. If you’d like a second opinion on the possibility of curse damage, you’re more than welcome to bring Penelope to my practice in Hogsmeade.” Draco said, evenly, his healer mask sliding quickly into place. His mind whirring with a hundred possibilities.
Draco narrowed his eyes in response “I suppose.” He finally let out, searching Potter’s worn and angry face. “If you say so, Potter.”
“Honestly?” He was forcing himself to be honest, forcing himself not to say

Once Harry was within reach, he could only think of one way to release his pent up frustration and overwhelming feelings of intensity he had for this enigmatic person that held so much of Draco’s brokenness with acceptance and awe. He had grabbed Harry’s shirt, all thoughts of dueling and shouting gone in one moment of soft lips and hot breath, and how Harry had melted beneath him.
Draco came and sat in a rickety chair beside the bed and Lucius reached out a withered hand to clutch Draco’s. He looked down to see his father’s wrinkled, weathered fingers, the skin nearly translucent, against his own. Lucius’s knuckles joints swollen and his nails yellowed.
He was thinking too hard about the day ahead. A thrumming crescendo of panicky anticipation crashing through him in regular intervals like waves on a battered coast. Relentless. Persistent.
Did he deserve to live?
“Will you help me plant him tomorrow? I was thinking just outside in the clearing by the well - and we’ll need to make him his own protective fence so the porcupines don’t get involved.” He asked, excitement clear on his face, having obviously spent much time and consideration on where he wanted their tree to live.
“Start at the top.” Draco said firmly but gently.
“You did not, you sneaky bastard.” Harry cut him off, looking offended.
Those eyes that laughed with him and watched him so closely and with such kindness as they worked together in their cozy kitchen, making tea and sharing parts of themselves. The green that had haunted him since he was 11, that had captivated him since his early years, a green that had coerced the death of his godfather at the same time they had stared down the most dangerous wizard who had ever lived. Everything about Harry was like that, powerful and dangerous, while at the same time it was soft and safe. He was the kind of man who had collected the deathly hallows and felt no need to use them.
Harry was sitting on the ground directly in front of Draco, who was shocked when he felt a rough thumb swipe across his cheek to wipe away the last of the wetness on his face. Harry dropped his hand away quickly when Draco’s eyes met his.
Unwelcome to Draco’s eyes, however, were two bottles of what appeared to be champagne from the Zabini cellars in her right hand.
Moving aside his research notes, he pulled a piece of blank parchment towards him and began to write.
“Oh!” She laughed, reaching in to her top, slipping a little fold of plastic out of her bra. “I’ve got just the thing, babe, don’t you worry. I was hoping you’d say something; I could use some myself.”
Harry didn’t hesitate grabbing a scrap of parchment and scribbling a few words down and placing it carefully on the center shelf in the enchanted cupboard. He closed it and after waiting for what seemed like 30 seconds he opened it again. They were both surprised to see a jar of peanut butter there so quickly.
was scribbled on a pink one.
“Thank
When Harry finally came, it was with two of Draco’s fingers inside him, his cock shoved deep into his throat, Draco’s lips around his teeth and his eyes bright and clear. Harry had shuddered and the sounds poured out of him, filthy and unashamed.
“I understand your concerns. Why don’t I speak to Healer Rhoda and see if we can’t make a plan— if you’re interested, of course. There’s no pressure.” Draco assured, watching Felix fray the hole by his knee. “But, your curse has reduced significantly, and with continued treatment I feel confident it’ll be gone by next year. Your magical core should recover for the most part. There’s no reason you won’t be able to properly hone your magic.”
As the unwanted guests drew nearer, they could begin to make out their conversation.
Harry placing a gentle hand at Draco’s back when he had to scoot past with a plate. Draco gently nudging Harry with his elbow when he needed to reach over to the stove for the bacon. The dance went on and on, and each time they grazed hands or make unexpected eye contact, the bottom fell out of Draco’s stomach. He was already regretting being nice to Harry.
“You’re freezing.” Harry said, his brows furrowed with concern. Barely moving his hand he cast a powerful warming charm that settled over Draco and seeped into his bones. He sighed in thankful relief, squeezing Harry’s hand.
Life or death?
The stillness of the moment that followed seemed to crack through Harry’s rage and bring him back to himself. Before anyone could react, however, Harry’s thestral moved forward and grabbed the back of his shirt collar, deftly yanking him off balance and pulling him to the beast’s side.
“Hiss hiss.” He quirked a smile at her, and she smiled back.
He didn’t answer, and as soon as he was clear of the door he ran flat out for the forest. And wasnt that just a sight? Striped drawstring pajama bottoms and thin grey nightshirt be damned.
Glancing at his watch, he saw he had 10 minutes to get down the hall. He schooled his features, gritted his teeth, tightened his grip on his briefcase, and marched forward into the dimly lit stone passage.
He decided to go a step further for his wardrobe, in the event he was called into the ministry. He wasn’t about to be disciplined in lime green healer robes or his black scrubs. Dressing in smart grey fitted trousers, a white button down, and soft grey woollen vest, he picked out his snappiest shoes and a dark blue tie and gathered his paperwork.
“There’s just something we’re missing here, I just know it!” Granger growled to herself as she raked chewed fingernails through her increasingly frazzled looking hair.  Dropping her elbows onto the desk, she slumping over to rub tired eyes with the heels of her hands.
He knows what he’s going to tell them this first lesson. This first meeting is going to be about the importance of friendship. Of having people to lean on, to rely on, to reach out to when you’re in the dark. When you’re worried you’re alone. When you can feel the dread come rushing down upon you. When you stop feeling like you can breathe.
In the next 30 minutes, Harry learned how to mainline. The barman took him through the steps, showing him how to mix, cook and load a dose, then how to hit a vein - even so far as to show him which veins he could use. He helped him assemble his kit - he seemed happy to take Harry’s muggle money in exchange for this strange service he provided, an introduction into the world of heroin.
Instead of that red line, there should have been a network of golden threads to represent Potter’s nucleus accumbens in his mesolimbic pathways. Shocked, he stood for a moment, alarm bells ringing in the back of his memory banks-– something was telling him he should know what this means-– one of his old haem journals did an article on— what was it—
Harry- Harry Potter, he still felt a bit like he had done something wrong by saying his name out loud. “He sent me another letter.” he responded sheepishly, looking at his hands.
The sun was coming up, and Draco saw that there were two thestrals staring in through the kitchen window. He couldn’t tell if their presence soothed or worried him. Were they here to take him to Harry? Was Harry injured? Was he alive?
Greg smiled. “Your family was a bit fuckin’ weird, weren’t they?”
“Draco.” Harry said, softly at first. But there was no response, his lips kissing further down his stomach now, his hands sliding toward the flimsy waistband of his bottoms.
It was true, and it made him feel slightly less empty.
They slowed their movements, catching their breath. Draco rolled off of Harry and pulled him close. They lay there, pressing sleepy, open and uncoordinated lips together. Harry barely managing to cast a wandless, wordless, cleaning charm before they both sank into a deep sleep. Safe in the folds of the heavy duvet strewn haphazardly across their skin.
Whatever he was expecting, it was not this.
Freya snorted a little laugh at this, and Harry had to stifle his own huff of amusement. There was something so incredibly endearing about the little Slytherin, though he could easily imagine he was putting the school nurse through her paces.
Malfoy blinked up at him, his breathing still fast and ragged. It took him several seconds to compose himself, but eventually he swallowed, and managed a scratchy “thanks.”
Draco smiled to himself thinking about the ridiculous stuffed creature he had made for Luna. It was ghastly and deformed, but he knew Luna would love it anyways, the odd woman. He had been so thrilled for the bag of yarn she had sent him for Christmas. Wools, cottons, silk blends, and other soft and luxurious textures that his fingers were itching to make into more beautiful things. He scratched out a lengthy response to Luna before reaching out for the next letter.
“Mph.” Was all Harry managed.
He decided he would do something nice for himself, it was his birthday after all.
Hermione slumped in her chair and closed her eyes. “I can’t tell if I’m relieved or horrified.”
disappointed.
Panting, they had climbed into bed, and Draco had returned the favour, Harry’s eyes fluttering shut as begged and adjured and supplicated, hands curling against the sheets, his hips lifting, his desperation lending timbre and volume and such desperation to his voice, which tumbled and twisted around Draco’s name.
And through it all. Through it all, Draco keeps him afloat.
Harry sighed and smiled down at his gift. He was so pleased with how it had turned out. After one of their winter storms, Harry had gone outside to find the Wiggentree had lost one of its main branches, a nice and straight one that was too slim for carving figures, but he had held on to it anyway, storing it above the rafters to dry out a bit. One evening, he’d looked up to it, worrying over what he could possibly give to Rose for Christmas, and just knew he’d found the perfect solution.
“A few weeks ago. Asked me to put her in touch with her mother’s midwife.”
“Uhhhh… I don’t know?” Harry said, sounding bemused. “Small circular cakey things fried in a pan? Covered in syrup and jam? Not the super thin ones.”
It didn’t last long, frantic as it was. Harry came with a strangled gasp, his hands gripping Draco’s ass cheeks tightly, controlling his trusts against him. The slickness of Harry’s release tipped Draco over the edge and his hips faltered, his cock spurting between them, his teeth dragging along the tendon in Harry’s neck.
“So, I could ask for that again... if I’m struggling?” He clarified.
Internally, Harry spends the whole time chasing the relief that alcohol brings, he needs distraction from what’s happening in his mind: the shudder of panic each time the pub door opens and a stranger walks inside, the flickering images in his peripheral vision, ghosts of villains and heroes, both. Every shot he drinks is an attempt to escape, a layer of protection against his own reeling thoughts. He hates the crowds, hates the smells, the touching of strangers as they move past him, trusting nothing and no one to be benign.
Harry cleared his throat, seeming to come back to himself and making a decision. “Yeah—Yes. Me too.” He got up and hugged Luna, more soundly this time, clearly less afraid of breaking her.
