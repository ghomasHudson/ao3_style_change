Names were still being called as Harmony watched the line of first years diminish. Her eyes began to drift. To the Ravenclaw table, Cho Chang was conversing with some of her friends. She didn't look as pretty as Harmony once thought she did. To Luna Lovegood who was still reading that magazine. Harmony's eyes involuntarily drifted towards the Slytherin table, to a certain blond in particular. She noted that she was not alone in eyeing him as Draco Malfoy caught the attention of many of the new slytherin girls.
It wasn't until after she had packed her things away into Draco's mokeskin bag that Harmony began to feel nervous. She had to stop herself from laughing out loud; she had faced dementers, basilisks and dragons, she had escaped from and vanquished the darkest wizard in modern times, it was funny that she should be afraid of a trio of muggles.
"What did you expect; an umbrella?" She laughed as if it was some kind of shared joke. Harmony frowned a little which made McGonagall in turn frown. "You have heard of Mary Poppins, right?"
"Sure, if you know a good place for tea." Draco continued to hold her as they walked together into a shop she had never been in before.
"I'm not your little house elf to order around," Harmony expressed with annoyance while dropping her bag to the floor. He gave a little snort.
Ron shook his head at Hermione and muttered something that sounded suspiciously like girls, before heading back out of the room.
Malfoy eyed Harmony from across the room with a cold calculation. He just had to be careful, and not get any closer to her. But still something was not quite right. He put down his jam toast, having lost his appetite, and made his way to potions class early. There was not a soul in the room and Draco claimed his usual seat at the back. Before he could drop his bag to the floor, somebody stepped in. Draco was surprised to see Potter staring at him from across the room. He instantly stiffened. "Why are you here?" he asked turning to her, "and as a girl?"
"Quick, someone do something!" Neville nearly shouted. Fred and George ran over from wherever they had been to watch their brother duke it out with a salivated ball of food.
Hardly any students remained at Hogwarts, and those who did, avoided him. He faintly recalled being irritable for the past month, perhaps snapping at people. Casting some hexes, blasting people out of his way, that sort of thing. Draco noticed that the few stragglers he encountered stared at him wide eyed, and stepped far to the side of the hallway until he passed on his way to the West Tower.
Draco did not answer at first, but balled his fists. "Never mind. I'm not some stupid Gryffindor. I can see that you are mocking me." Draco turned to leave, but stopped when he felt something at his wrist. Snape had his own arm out, the dark mark marring white skin.
Snape watched as the students left his room, placing vials of their potions on his desk. After class, Draco sat on the hard wooden chair that was besides Snape's desk.
Draco awoke the next morning with the thought that the sun rise was hitting his eyes, but laughed when he saw the pink hues in his room reflected from the torch light. Draco stretched from where he sat and took his time as he changed.
"Padfoot!" Harmony whispered in disbelief, "what are you doing here?" Sirius gave her one last lick before dashing off, and Harmony followed the foot prints in the snow, ignoring the people staring as she skidded through the snow.
Harmony sat at the usual table on the caf√© patio where she could relax and finish her tall glass of water. It was exceedingly hot that late afternoon, and she wore a loose red tank top and white shorts. Though the material was thin she felt it stick uncomfortably to her skin. A day had passed since her birthday and Ron and Hermione still hadn't sent anything to her. The heat forced many of the wizards and witches to escape indoors and she wanted to wait till it got a bit darker before heading back.
"Care to join us for the Quidditch party, Saturday night." George added, addressing Harmony. She nodded.
"Bloody hell, Dumbledore sure knows how to pick them," Ron muttered. Hermione swished her hand to get their attention.
"Good evening, Harry," Luna called along with Ginny. "You look mildly perturbed, get a bad premonition from Divinations?" She had no idea how to answer that.
"What am I doing?" Came a voice from a four poster bed. A single candle flickered from a breeze which should have been impossible. There were no posters of favorite Quidditch teams adorning the walls, no clutter, cards, or photos heaped on wooden surfaces, there was not a single carelessly tossed sock on the black marble floor. The only indication that the inhabitant of this room was a teenage school student were the regal looking school robes and the textbooks that were kept neatly in a low bookshelf. If someone had a look inside, that blatantly uninvited stranger (since nobody had been welcomed in since the owner of the room had moved in five years back) would find nothing of interest, though the only thing worth its value was in fact a person. The same one situated on the bed.
"I fell in the pool before I almost crossed the rope." Harmony shrugged her shoulders and another stream emptied to the floor.
They had been attracting a lot of attention, or at least she had. It was a surprise what black robes could hide. The dress hugged her slim frame and the candle light reflected off the silver material so that his eyes trailed around her figure. If beauty could ever be summed up in one word, it would be harmony. He laughed at how overly sentimental he was being.
Laughter came from the rider, who was watching children as they were nearly engulfed in flames. Students cried out as they threw themselves away from the line of fire, while others stood their ground with wands drawn, squinting at the other black streaks fast approaching. "It's Voldemort," Harmony pulled Ginny and Luna with her, heading towards the castle.
"I only said that so the other boys would not bother you, no need to think that all of my motives are to spite you."
"I have to go," she said, and she broke away. With one last look she fled for the door and threw the cloak around her.
Draco awoke with upturned lips as the prior day's events played back in his mind. He was sure that he was a step closer to Harmony's heart, and as he washed his face, he touched his flawless skin. He didn't think that she could resist him much more longer. He could barely resist himself as he smirked into the mirror. He felt his sore arm muscles in satisfaction, knowing that they were more defined.
"I don't see why though," Leighton shrugged, "I am your mentor, you are my student, so naturally you would be my cub." No matter how hard she tried, she could not follow his logic. "Unless you would rather be young grasshopper instead."
"And you?" another house elf asked, till they all had a butterbeer in their hands. They soon left and felt warm from the butterbeers.
"Well that didn't work," Harmony said, when they were further down the passage way, "even though Ginny makes a more believable Harry than I do. It took ages to find that one strand of old hair as well. Want to go on a date?"
"At this rate it should be you two getting the lessons, you are grown men, be a good influence and tolerate each other." McGonagall snapped, giving them annoyed looks as if they should be sent to kindergarten to be taught to hold hands and learn basic courtesy. Asking the two to be friends was almost as possible as asking them to frolic in a meadow of daisies. Hand in hand as well with harps playing in the back. She shuddered from the bad mental images and suspected what her nightmares would bring. At least Snape wouldn't be staying the nights, then she really would have something to fear.
"waz up?" he slurred and his eyes widened. His voice sounded softer. He looked fearful at his smaller hands and then back at the two older men in front of her. He vaguely once wondered if Dumbledore was into young boys, but now he felt glad that he was a girl, though Snape was an entirely new concern. He felt a bit exposed to their eyes with the hospital gown that barely concealed his new form. He must have looked comical to them, like some hideous new female specimen. "Er. May I use the loo?"
"Hell," Harmony said, remembering what Snape had said the other night "who knows, maybe he will invite you too."
The ferret squeaked in freight as she playfully swiped it down. She could tell that Draco was a bit angry the way he hissed. But she took him in her mouth and lightly held him there. The caracal part of her purred in delight for capturing her prey, and she allowed the ferret to return to the ground before her instincts could tell her to take a bite. The wet ferret hissed at her, and Harmony gave an internal chuckle before smoothing his fur down with her tongue.
"So who do you think will be the new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor this year?" Hermione asked.
"No," Harry said, "I have an idea, do you want to see some of the secret passage ways out of Hogwarts. Then you don't have to walk in the snow."
"I have six older brothers and would prefer that my boyfriend stays alive. Besides, if they didn't kill him, my mother just might." Ginny justified, waiting to see if Harmony had anything to add. "So do you want to go?"
"You better be right," she said and stepped through the room. The smile that Draco detested was gone from Leighton, and Harmony stuffed her hands in her robe pockets.
"That doesn't make sense!" Luna shrugged her shoulders, "I still think that you should unleash the mold idea. It would spread quickly, take time to notice, and would match the decor perfectly!"
This could not be happening. What was Professor McGonagall thinking? She was not going to go tell her deepest secrets to them and expect some 'family' bonding. She had been expecting to leave that very day and had kept to her room. How was she going to hide her face for another day without looking like boy Harry? The spell would only last for a few more hours at least and she had no way to use magic to conceal her face.
"Sorry to disturb you two," said a drawling voice, a voice that she all too well knew. She wanted to punch that face; she didn't want to see his arrogant smirk or his cold gray eyes. Just perfect.
"Sorry, I guess you're just going to have to wait." Damn him, she thought and slammed her locker open. Either she was going to have to walk all the way to her room to get dressed, or wait for him there to change and leave. But Harmony wasn't just going to allow Draco get the best of her and be late. She began to unbutton the first of many layers and shoved her black school robes into her locker. She dropped her glasses on her gym clothes, and grabbed the hem of her gray vest and started to unceremoniously pull it over her head. She nearly ripped off her tie, and when she got to her white collared shirt, she paused before beginning to unbutton that as well.
"You can't get rid of me so easily," he said and leaned closer so that his legs were brushing against hers. Her body shuddered as he placed a hand on her shoulder, and through the white shirt, she felt his warmth. She couldn't understand how he could do all of this, as she looked like Harry Potter and had just rejected him. His hand went to her neck, and she was reminded of the last time they were alone in a train compartment. He was closer than before, and he brushed the inside of her shirt before pulling out the locket.
"Harmony, you almost done in there?" McGonagall called from the hall leading to her room. Harmony washed her face once more and stepped out of the bathroom.
"You all should guess, but with your knowledge about him this time," Leighton said while looking into their eyes.
With the Death Eaters gone, the three of them ran to the entrance where Ginny had seen Harmony last. Instead she saw Micheal Corner, someone who she perhaps should have been thinking of-but wasn't.
The door to the room popped open and Draco, who had been leaning against the frame, landed on the hard stone tiles. (But somehow had made it to look as graceful as anyone in such a position could.) He instantly got on up and brushed the seat of his robes.
"Harmony, Harmony, why do you struggle?" Ginny smiled cheerfully while draping an arm around her friend's trapped shoulder. "This is for your own good, and now you can't run away. But what am I going to do with your hair? A brush won't do." Ginny's fingers combed Harmony's hair. "It's really soft."
"Yes," she said, "I can see that. But why are you here now?" Harmony walked closer and dropped her book bag to the floor. She crossed her arms over her chest and glared at Draco as he began to fold his shirt. She couldn't help but look, and who wouldn't? He had a lithe and well toned body that wasn't grossly muscular. It was a stomach that she could slowly trace abs and muscles, as she followed her way down to the edge of what must have been his boxers. She trailed her eyes up, passed the snake of his locket.
The door slammed open, its frame enveloped by Snape. He stared at the two, at the broken glass bottles, at the girl looking like his hated enemy, in the arms of Draco Malfoy. "What is going on in here?" he asked in a low tone, darkness cast his eyes in black.
Immediately his arms went slack and she pushed away from him. He was still in his robes and she saw his placid expression. She could imagine the scene they were making, all glued together and she began to fight her brain for excuses. Nothing was all she could come up with. It was the new Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor.
"Yes, so pain caused by betrayal is almost always harder to get over." Draco bit his tongue, realizing just why the older man picked on him. Draco glanced at Harmony. Her eyes were downcast, staring into the jar that was so seemingly innocuous.
"Maybe someday, but that doesn't explain why he knows," Harmony hit the back of her cushioned bench chair with her head, repeatedly.
"I bet that you say that to everything with two legs and a skirt." She crossed her arms in front of her chest.
"Just be as quiet as you can." Harmony muttered to Draco as she opened her bedroom door, and slipped through. She reached back behind her and grasped his hand, as she started down the dark stairwell on her own, knowing exactly where to avoid each creak. She nearly made it, with her free hand nearing the front door-freedom within her grasp, when a large thump came from the kitchens. The two of them turned, to see a massive figure outlined by the light of the refrigerator.
Harmony waited till the common room became quiet before stepping out. She sat on the couch, waiting for Ginny, till it was almost midnight, and Harmony felt the locket hang like a hand pulling down at her neck. A door creaked open and Harmony turned her head to watch as Ginny descended the stairs. They nodded to each other when they were close enough, and went to the portrait.
Harmony sighed at his hopelessness, and then remembered that she too did not know any such spell. "Then I guess that you will just have to go as you are."
Draco ate his breakfast in mild silence as Blaise fell short on his answers. He looked up to the Gryffindor table and saw that they were very much the same. They were lucky in their own way, at least now.
She went to bed that night full with cake and took out the kitten socks. They were soft in her hands and she slipped a foot into one of them. Her toe felt something hard and she took off the sock to find a simple necklace with a wooden deer at the end and a note. The note read it was your mother's in Snape's precise hand writing. The wood felt smooth and was about the size of her thumb. She carefully tied the cord around her slender neck admiring it in the mirror. She wondered why Snape had something of her mother's. Well, they were still in the same year and she may have dropped it one day and he probably had kept it. It didn't matter now.
Hermione's hand flashed up, and Snape called on her. When the other girl faced her, Harmony felt even more awkward. She only hoped that Hermione wasn't doing it because she embarrassed her precious Ron. When Snape nodded for them to begin, Hermione waved her wand and a binding spell was sent her way. Harmony deflected it, and the spell ricocheted to the floor.
"It-" Kreacher's head turned side to side, "must be destroyed!" He made a quick swoop for it, but Harmony held it well above the both of them.
"This enchanted mirror connects to my own mirror so we can communicate. If you ever want to speak to me, no matter the time or even if it is to say goodnight, I will answer you."
"This is goodbye, Father," Draco said. The torches against the wall flickered against his father's face, and Draco took a step back.
He had been on her mind, more than she had cared to admit, and now he was here. In order to escape, quietly, she had to get Draco Malfoy out of here fast, before the muggles found him, or before he found the muggles. Neither of them felt particularly motivated to get going. At least not at first. The longer his lips were on hers, the more Harmony remembered how much she liked them there. His hands ran through her hair, as they kissed, trailing lightly down. When he held her tightly, pressing against her back, she couldn't hide a small hiss of pain.
"Never, my dearest bestest most handsomest friend of all these lands, would I ever be sarcastic to you."
"Blimey Harry, just how did you do that, these hammers weigh a ton?" Ron asked, realizing he probably didn't look too manly with his maw all hanging open.
Draco looked around once more, hoping that no one else had figured as much as Blaise. If any one who actually wanted to hurt him found out, it would mean trouble. He had been a love struck fool, but he was glad that it was Blaise who had warned him. As Draco went back to the dungeons he saw Nott looking like he had been wearing his own make-me-disgruntled-locket. Nott sneered at him, and Draco thought there was something terrible in the boy's eyes, something akin to a mad man's glare. When their eyes met, Nott winked at him before they passed, and Draco wondered if perhaps they all had finally lost it. He didn't even know if it mattered anymore.
"Well tell me," Harmony laughed. Last night was the Masquerade party. No wonder she had barely seen them.
The stone floor was cold, but soon a warmth seeped through, and touched the stiff hands and feet. The candles began to extinguish, one by one, till a hazy glow lifted the ceiling. Harmony rested her head on her pillow, unable to sleep, and tired of thinking. She sat up when a faint light glowed by her face, and a hand beckoned her close. Harmony tread softly, missing the heads around her. She followed the tall woman out of the great Hall. "What has happened?" Harmony asked.
"The Order of the Pheonix, Dumbledore's special army like he had in the old days fighting against you-know-who. They meet here and discuss strategies and plans. And mum says we're too young, but Fred and George developed these ear things to help us listen in-so we know something's up with the giants!"
"But is that even a man?" Ginny asked quickly with her wand poised in the air as the dragon swooped back their way. The figure on the dragon had blond and brown streaks in her hair, with a melange of facial features from multiple women. Harmony's stomach seized as she wondered how many hearts Voldemort had devoured to look like that.
"Don't harm him! Padfoot stop!" Harmony yelled. Draco had his wand pointed at the dog while at the same time trying not to get his foot torn off. He was thinking of a spell that wouldn't hurt the animal, and failing. It sank its teeth into the back of his ankle and he cursed aloud.
"You don't have to do this. We could escape together," Draco whispered. His mind raced to find arguments to back up his claim. The prophecy had already been fulfilled when the Dark Lord had last attacked her, the world was large enough for two people to get lost in it safely, he would take care of her.
"I have my ways," Dubledore said and took a seat at the desk, he gestured to the seat where the students sat. "Severus, please do sit, it will make the pain lessen."
"Why do you need to find Potter anyway?" Micheal asked, guessing where she was going as he looked down at his girlfriend.
"Hey, they will misunderstand if you say that!" Her fingers fidgeted with the hem of her dress, and fisted the soft material in frustration.
"Hm, in what way?" Harmony joined Draco on the banister, aware that her hand brushed against his. A small smile escaped her, and Harmony covered it with puffed cheeks.
"Ron" Ginny said, "that's even low for you. And yes we're somewhat friends," Ginny said, "and I don't care if you have a problem with it."
"Why isn't that hard to believe?" Draco looked at Harmony. Would someone else believe that she was lying? Think that she was making up stories. A twelve year old boy taking down a horcrux and a basilisk was hard to believe. Down right impossible even. But he didn't dismiss her.
Harmony shut her eyes, desperately hoping that it would cease the contact. She felt the presence closer, as if it were ripping chunks out of her mind.
"You did that on purpose. I don't know how, but you are out to get me." Draco said to her when they were far enough away from the class room.
"Er," she said, realizing that it wasn't such a good idea to talk in the middle of the hall, "are you OK?"
"Don't move," Luna said calmly, "it's the devil's snare." Draco couldn't do anything but choke, so he allowed his body to go limp. A few desperate seconds later while he was thinking that his limpness would be a permanent predicament, he felt the pressure leave his neck. His body was lowered and he dropped to the floor.
"We find Dumbledore, the students and Draco's mother, then we high tail out of here," Harmony said, not even realizing that there was no how.
"Shite," Draco whispered before silencing the door shut. It was well into three and he cursed the dungeons for the lack of proper window light. He lit his wand with a whispered Lumos. It took roughly twelve minutes to walk to the library, and another five to get in. Unfortunately, he rarely went into the library considering his private home collection far exceeded that of the school's, and he never had been in the restricted section since he probably owned those too. Well except for the one his father wanted.
"Nope, never mind," Leighton turned back, heading towards what they hoped was the castle, "I didn't ruin Dumbledore's surprise."
"Yea! And they are always charting maps and sometimes mum forgets to put them away before dinner and we saw one of cliffs near some pond or something, and it must have been pretty important judging by how hard mum smacked me away."
"But there are so many people, Harry." Then he smiled, "well I can just picture them all." He began to giggle quietly as his hammer rained down on that poor desk. It never stood a chance. The room got louder as more and more students got into the beat and energy. Even Draco Malfoy dismantled his desk without his aurora of bored indifference. Many of the girls struggled with their hammers. Hermione's frustrated whacks could only do minimal damage, and unfortunately she was paired with Neville who looked with fear at the object in his hands. But the students found the fun in the destruction of school property. Harmony would have demolished her desk to dust - loved to even- but all of the splinters progressed to travel to a corner of the room where Leighton attempted to create an upright man, which looked to be a replica of a poorly constructed fat man creature with a long snout and gaping jaw. It would have looked menacing if not for the silly grin.
"And?" Harmony leaned in towards him. His hair was a bit unkempt, and his bangs were swept to the side. She wondered if his hair was as silky as it looked, but she stopped the hand that had twitched.
"The same goes to you, and you better be the one to tell your friends properly." Draco simply stated, turning his head away from the girl.
"Much," he answered. Harmony reached into her book bag and took out her potions book. It served as a nice pillow if anything as she rested her head on it. She could feel ominous feelings make her think of the break out more, and Harmony knew that Voldemort had planned it all. She didn't want to think about him building an army.
She was close enough that she could hear the animal scurrying, and Harmony dropped to the ground. Her muscles were taught as she pin pointed the location of the creature. She shot through the underbrush and her paws were outstretched ready to take down the white haze that was only now about to run.
"Not exactly," he mumbled. He did not quite meet her eyes as he said that, and Harmony knew that he was holding something back.
After she did a few more of the other Slytherins from other grades and Pansy's room she thought her work complete. "So where's your room?" she asked.
"It's just a little water, Potter," Pansy laughed, "it suites you well." Harmony pointed her wand at the girl. "Easy Potter, it wasn't me."
Harmony ran for the door and tiptoed down the stairs with the invisibility cloak hiding her. Going through her head were the secret passage ways into Hogsmeade. She had an hour to spare, before the students would actually leave Hogwarts. Deciding to leave earlier, she strolled to the third corridor where the one-eyed witch statue stood. She glanced around before taping the witch and whispering the dissendium spell. She internally thanked George and Fred, before entering the secret passageway. Harmony kept the cloak secured over her head, ignoring the darkness that crept along the crumbling walls. A root jutted out from the dirt, which nearly tripped her. "Why do girls even wear these silly shoes," she mumbled as she checked her nails for any chips in their color.
"Well Ron, I plan to grow three inches by the end of this month, and four by the next. I am a growing boy, you know."
Hermione raised her hand high above her head. Leighton nodded at her to respond. "It's just that we never had to use physical force without magic, what is the point for this task if we are witches and wizards?"
"What do you want? I don't feel like arguing right now." He obviously didn't want a fight, cause then he would have brought Cabbe and Goyle to do it for him.
The door shot open and Ron slid on to the seat across from Harmony with Hermione. Harmony brushed her head against the glass, the room was getting much too stuffy for some reason.
"Before we go out again," Kingscross said to the students whose hands were mere inches away from the clay cup, "each of you will be given one of these." Kingscross held up raw meat. They frowned with distaste before reaching out for a slither and holding it with two fingers. "Alright! Now!" Five hands grabbed at edges of the clay cup, and Draco wondered if they were traveling to a pit vicious, ravenous crocodiles.
It took him a few moments, but he felt the success as he grasped the cotton cloth that surrounded the bed. With an anticipating smile he pushed back the curtain soundlessly. And there was Potter. He scrutinized the boy, and nearly cursed out loud when he saw nothing amiss.
Her wand alarm vibrated, announcing the stroke of twelve. Harmony clamored from her bed to leave the room.
"This time you must go!" Ron said to Harmony, "and I don't care about whatever Professor Snape says."
Draco swerved around the field, and she realized that she never actually had watched him fly before. He flew with a grace that she did not have on a broom. While she flung and hurtled across the field, he knew how to make flying look effortless, elegant like an art. "Harmony," Ginny sent her back to the bleachers, "do you have good vision?"
Harmony went to the loo to wash up a bit. She turned her back from the mirror as she changed and felt with unconcealed horror the not as flat chest she had two days ago. It was still practically nothing and she had seen some larger man boobs, courteous of Dudley, but they would grow. She turned back to the mirror and studied her face. Yep, definitely female. Even her cropped hair looked better as a girl's. Everything would betray her now, how could she hide this form during Hogwarts? No, the world was determined to make her suffer.
"Yeah, it's strange going to class with someone burning holes in your head. But otherwise, heck, we only live once, let's do what we want."
Harmony ignored Ron's glares, as she attempted to enjoy Ginny's birthday party. Inside she was all smiles; it was rather fun to torment people with minimal effort, no wonder the Slytherins did it.
They placed him on an unoccupied bed on Harry's far left. Madam Pomfrey hurried to the supine boy. Even Harry could tell that Malfoy was not feigning his pain. He watched with curiosity as Malfoy was tantalized by suffering. The nurse forced a pain alleviating potion down his throat and made to get more.
There was a distinct mumbling of upsetting words coming from Snape's mouth, words that ought not be repeated, though were creative in their dimensions of using wands in their not so conventional uses of shoving them in improbable areas.
"Call me Harmony." They nodded their heads. What was in a name any way? Regardless of whatever others labeled her, she would still be the same inside. Harry was a mask for her. She was the girl who lived; she was Harmony.
It was white, almost blinding, with columns and tracks. Harmony took a few steps, wondering how she had gotten to a cleaner kings cross station. She touched her chest, and didn't feel the pain of a torn heart. A slight cry emitted from underneath a bench, and Harmony got down to her knees. At first she thought it was a skinned baby, with limbs too long and bony, to do anything but twitch. She had to step away and close her eyes from looking into the face of Voldemort.
"The world would eat you alive if they knew you were a girl, so I can't have these three ambitious wankers swallow you up. Come on, there's no harm in a little intervention. Plus I can assist you if you need someone to practice with, or to understand the lesson."
Draco awoke as the sun slapped his eyes shut, and he jumped up. This may be the only chance for him. He tiptoed to the curtained off section where Harry Potter still slept. Behind the white sheet, Draco glimpsed a pretty face‚Ä¶ this couldn't be the right bed, before Madam Pomfrey pulled him aside and told him he was free to go.
They landed in a pile of ankle deep snow, and went straight to the door. Draco had no time to hold the door for her, seeing as Harmony had kicked it open. "What time is it?" she asked him as she shoved her broom back in her locker.
"Watched it from my window," she shrugged and didn't miss the glare that Ron shot her as he passed them.
Harmony had never seen a ferret so close before and was compelled to scoop it up. When it was close enough to sniff her, she grabbed it by the middle and whisked the animal to her chest. The ferret squeaked in fear, and nipped angrily at her fingers. She held it in a more comfortable position and the ferret stopped squirming. It was completely rigid as she held it, and Harmony thought that maybe something was wrong. It looked rather sneakily up at her, before poking into the arms of her robe and disappearing completely from view. Harmony laughed as it tickled her arms. It poked its head from the collar of her shirt before resting atop her shoulders. Good thing that she wore multiple layers to increase her mass, or else it would have been weird to feel the animal against her skin. "Well aren't you a strange ferret," she mumbled to herself. "You are quiet frisky." The ferret bristled at the word, and pawed at her neck. She brought her arms to hold it close to her face. "You also smell nice, I thought ferrets were stinky." The ferret 'ki'ed in response, and waved its paws around. She stared into its grey eyes, and it stared back at her. cute, she thought.
It took her a few seconds to catch up. She put a hand over the bandages that covered her beating heart. The pain quelled as she realized what hell Draco must have been going through. Her hand drifted to the side of his face, where she felt what hadn't been completely dried away. Her thoughts were cloudy as she looked into his gray eyes, and she didn't have to look down at her ring to know the sorrow that resided there. His head moved down to her shoulder and Harmony felt as his hair tickled her cheek. "The most beautiful sound I have ever heard is the beating of your heart," Draco said, "I found that out after the silence."
"Try relaxing, let it be natural," Leighton encouraged from somewhere in front of her. She hadn't realized that her muscles were all tense and that she had gripped her wand to fists. "Forcing nonverbal magic is exhausting, just believe and want light."
"I am afraid that there is bad news," Dumbledore stated, "Voldemort has returned." Students gasped at his name, and they reacted in a similar manner as they had when she was a first year and Professor Quirrell had come in with the knowledge that a troll had been let loose in the school. "Hogwarts will continue through this year, and will remain safe for students. Classes will be canceled for the day, in order for students to contact family, and make appropriate arrangements. That is all." Dumbledore then sat down to eat, and students began to leave in packs.
Draco smirked at the girl. "Great, I'm not either," he said, "we should celebrate it together." Harmony chuckled at him. "I'm sure that there is something fun we could do alone."
A lone whistle brook the chatter, and Lee Jordon's magnified voice greeted the school. Harmony straighted her back and leaned forward as the doors at the field opened at opposite ends. Green and purple swirls shot out and Harmony instantly became aware of who and what was on the field. The captains shook hands at the center of the field and Harmony watched as the balls were released and the whistle was blown.
"He died a fool, groveling for the lives of worthless children. Will you do the same Potter?" Voldemort laughed with her head bent back and smoke streamed from the nostrils of the dragon. "There is no one to protect you here, Potter, you will be mine to destroy."
"Wha- What are you doing?" Harmony faltered as she watched the progress of his shirt exposing more and more skin. His shirt was nearly off as he began to turn to her, so that now she could see the full expanse of his chest. She didn't know why she was staring, since she had seen many of her mates with less on, but this caught her completely off guard. With his shirt off, Harmony noticed his smirk next.
"Don't." Harmony warned, pulling her shirt back down. "The trace on me will have the whole ministry in here."
Harmony was left to tend to her burns on her own using homemade muggle remedies. She had been too distracted to notice the blisters at Hogwarts. They had grown steadily more painful on the flight over to the Dursleys as the adrenaline wore off. But by then it was too late. Harmony was terrified of doing magic and being discovered by the trace.
The room darkened. All side conversations deceased. Like tomb stones in a grave yard, Students stood straight and rigid in their seats. A door in the front creaked and Snape gave them sour looks as he emerged from the black room. His inky eyes narrowed. He had anticipated at least one parchment ball to have been thrown across the room- if not a swarm of salivated miniature paper balls to be dotted across the walls and at Gryffindor faces. He stood squarely at the foot of his desk, not particularly liking the view. His eyes lowered to that of Harmony, and gave a slight twitch. He wondered why there wasn't a commotion, this was his most troubling class. Then his vision traveled past her head to the back of the room where Malfoy sat, something dawned to him.
"Alright, I'm going to add the hornet's stinger in," Draco said, "so I'd back away from the cauldron if I were you." Harmony lifted her head and followed Draco's hands as he carefully placed in the stinger. A cloud of smoke emptied from the sides, and Harmony remembered when he had held her hands the night they went flying.
"All Blacks are Slytherins, my father was the only exception." Harmony replied and Blaise rolled his eyes.
"It's fine." Harmony replied, too preoccupied to care for the newspaper's petty bull. She ignored both the glares that were sent her way, as well as Hermione's mutterings.
"So what should we call you?" Dudley asked between mouthfuls. Harry looked a bit shocked. She had thought that they would have hit her over the head with a frying pan. But she wasn't sure if they were just acting civil, since she was only there for a day. She hadn't even been on full terms with it herself. Was she any different as Harry or Harmony? She noticed that they were waiting for her to respond.
"Whom else would it be from?" Draco Malfoy asked with a twist of his lips. "So you better be going, because I will be hunting you down if you don't. I swear I will haul your arse there if I have to."
"Ron, you wouldn't wake up if I shouted at you that there was a fire, plus you were sleeping so soundly I honestly thought I would be all right if I got some fresh air."
"There," her voice muffled out, before she reached out for the latch which connected to the Honeydukes cellar. She put her ear to the board, and cracked it an inch to see for any life. It was clear. With a swift upward motion, she pulled her body through the trap door and closed it with a jarring clasp. All she had to do was wait for the students to start steaming in.
"It doesn't matter if it's a trap, I'd still go. She is dying Draco," Harmony said. She could see the doubt in his eyes, "we could get her now, before anything happens."
"What! Do you think that I will let you throw away your life! Draco, you must understand, you will be killed for being a traitor!" Mr. Malfoy's voice grew and ricocheted off the walls.
"Yes, you will join your house shortly for dinner and resume your schedule. I have brought your uniform and supplies and I will perform the spell that will configure your face to appear like the previous Harry." Harry nodded and closed her eyes. She assumed that Dumbledore had used wandless magic and felt her old face. "It will only last for a full four days, then Minerva can assist you with this cream." Dumbledore held out a large container of yellowing ointment cream. "Made it myself," Dumbledore smiled and left the room to give Harry her privacy to change. He must have noticed the way she was accusing him in her mind.
"My class, my rules," Leigthon turned away from Draco. "The animagus transfiguration will enable each of you a higher level of magic control. We will start each lesson with animagus practice, and the rest of the time will be for other things."
"Maybe it's better if it isn't cancelled. The students need something to take the war out of their heads," Ginny said as Harmony once again lifted her head and watched the other tables with students chattering all at once.
"I thinks it's me who should be thanking you," Draco said. They stopped in front of the Great Hall, and Draco touched her jet black hair. He could almost read everything in her green eyes, and as if she noticed, she closed them. He smiled down at her, and he let his hand drop to his side and stray to her own hands. She didn't pull away as they had been practicing all night. She looked down at the hands that were holding hers. "Good night," he said, and let her go.
Draco had to stop his hand from crumpling Leighton's note. The letter was absurd, and he could not believe that Leighton was still calling her Cub. He had a mind not to go. That obnoxious bear! She was not his to call cub. Draco noticed that she watching him, and he pulled out his quill to scribble on the parchment that he would be there. After that, Harmony retreated back into herself, and Draco watched the black figure of Snape. When class ended, Draco went alone. His slytherine mates wanted nothing to do with him, and Draco muttered that he could care less. He didn't need them either.
"Shite Harmony, what the hell were you thinking?" Draco asked. "Does your life mean anything to you?"
"I have to sort some things in my head," Draco said, still turned towards the door. She dropped his hand. "Take care of yourself," Draco said, and walked through the doors out of the Great Hall. There was an ache, filled deep in his abdomen. He didn't care where he was going, just so long as it was away. He found himself in a dead end, where the silence lingered. He sat to the floor, and didn't bother about how dark or dirty it was where he rested his bum. He closed his eyes and took several deep breaths. He knew painfully well that he had only two choices that he loathed. To forget all of his ambitions and be with Harmony, or to kill his emotions and stick with his plan. He knew the stakes, His family and glory over being a traitor and possibly getting killed. Draco wasn't good, he didn't know how to be a hero, or do what was right. The feelings he felt for Harmony was a stranger, but it was something that gave him a simple happiness. It lit inside of him, and deep down he knew that he couldn't stop himself from sticking with her, even if he forced himself to be rotten. It would destroy him, it would be worse than a crucio.
The barn owl flitted through Ginny's open window discretely. Ginny barely noticed the owl herself, as it flew silently past posters of the Weird Sisters and landed softly on her bed. Ginny untied her letter to read:
The only good thing was that it was making her more aware. She'd listen to those around her, and no matter how many times they taunted her, she got right back. She didn't need friends to body guard her and shadow her each time she went alone. She acted like a caracal and slinked around the halls.
"I just couldn't do it. I was burned by a dragon, nearly murdered again, and I couldn't face everyone thanking me for it... I don't want to be famous, I don't want to be the boy who lived. Even if I have to come here and be treated like..." Harmony's voice trailed off when she saw Draco raise an eyebrow. Harmony hastily explained, "my relatives aren't exactly fond of me."
She turned to her right, careful not to stray too far from Hogwarts. Draco must have anticipated that since she saw him at the corner of her eye. She shot further, making her way to Draco. It took only a moment before they were side by side, and again she observed his face and could see the joy clearly expressed. This time he noticed and returned the gaze in a lazy manner.
"Well if he comes back, tell him thanks for me." She nodded and mysteriously smiled as she worked some more.
"I see," he said, "So this is it." He shook his head. "I guess I made a fool out of myself, but I understand well enough." His eyes never left hers. "Bye then."
"What the hell is wrong with you?" Ginny asked calmly. Malfoy smirked and took an empty seat directly across from Harmony.
The students went back four feet and watched Leighton intently. The change was almost instantaneous. Instead of a man, a grizzly bear stood in his place. A bear that was definitely smiling, but even that made it seem more malevolent. They couldn't believe it; they were going to learn animagus transfiguration. Leighton reverted to his real appearance.
"Come on, let's not stand here and freeze." When at first she didn't move he took the emerald scarf from his neck and draped it over Harmony. "We can talk on the way back." Harmony followed him, and wrapped the soft scarf around her bare neck. She allowed her Harry Potter guise to drop.
Severus looked at Dumbledore in confusion, remembering the night he had come with the poisoned hand and cursed ring. Marvolo Grant's ring, and the stone centered on the ring was cracked. "Of course," Severus muttered, how could he forget.
She stepped out of her room, which was adjacent to the main room, to see McGonagall fully clothed with wand in hand pointed at her throat. "Prefects and Head girl, check each bed for any child still sleeping." Harmony stood against the wall, as her school mates in every year stood in their pajamas and cloaks. Harmony put her hands under her arm pits to keep them warm, and many others tried to warm their hands at the burned out fire.
After he finished and flushed, he stumbled to the sinks. He nearly blacked out when he saw his reflection. It was all too much. There in place of his regular self was a girl in the mirror. It was terrible that the girl was him. No, that she was in fact a girl. Now she had to believe it.
"Ah, but he was the fortunate one, at least he got to reconstruct his features to look better for the funeral."
Their conversation cut off at the sound of heavy footsteps thundering down the stairs. Harmony looked up into Ron's freckled face, watched as his eyes flicked over the two of them sitting together. He saw Hermione's red rimmed eyes and scowled.
"Why am I not surprised that you're here?" She set her bag down. "Even after Ginny hounded you down like a bludger."
"Just ignore the oddities of the room, Leighton probably just wrestled with it and won," Harmony mumbled as she scanned around. They stood in the middle of the room and shadows fell across the floor from the setting sun.
Draco felt a shiver whisper through his spine as Harmony hissed, and the sink came apart. A great hole opened in its place, and Draco took a step forward. His voice caught as Harmony tipped forward. He heard a gasp from one of the girls behind him. Draco reached for Harmony, and her cloak brushed past his fingers. He had no time to think of anything else but of plummeting through the black hole.
"What do you want?" Harmony asked, and Draco allowed the reality of her anger to wash over him and pass. He gave her a small smile, and though it wasn't the dashing ones he had been practicing for, it had to suffice.
"Wicked!" Ginny exclaimed, "you are a bloody amazing animal!" Luna gave a small smile in response. They all stood near the key, and Leighton used magic so that the key hoovered within all of their grasps.
"Suppose that you go to Snape looking all fine," she whispered while giving a wink, "and flutter your eyes about, and don't forget to give a shy smile. He will surely say yes then." Harmony gave a slight snort. She had told Ginny during the summer break that Snape knew her secret.
"Severus Snape, potions master of Hogwarts. A fellow staff member has brought along a friend's daughter to Diagon Alley. I found her here, injured, while the incompetent Ministry of Magic asks questions since they failed to control their dementors, while she should be properly treated." He ended in a growl of annoyance. Harmony noticed Sirius slink away to retrieve her wand.
"The Ministry of Magic will be here soon," the voice streamed through. Nothing seemed right, and her brain hurt as if when she was five and Dudley had stepped on her head till she howled her throat raw. She could remember running, but not into a wall. "Damn Ministry letting dementors roam free." Oh right, the dementors. She tried to shoot her eyes open, but they lazily rose to the murky gray lights. A hand brushed away the hair from her eyes and slipped away as if caught in the act. Harmony looked into warm honey irises that shown brightly against the cold gray of the sky. His eyes flicked to where her scar had to be exposed and on reflex she brought a lethargic hand to cover it. A bandage covered her hand and red marred white.
"Bloody Malfoy that is, I heard some of the first years talking about him in the great hall during breakfast. Makes me wonder why the girls go raving mad after him. Slytherin Ponce or Prat fits him like a leather glove. Ugh. Speak of the devil." Draco strut in the classroom, the image of immaculate perfection, well externally at least. Still with her head down Harmony caught herself following him with her eyes, but not before he noticed and winked at her. She closed her eyes tightly, not wanting to think of the previous night.
"Obviously because I do not want to see the two of you at the same time," the Professor snarled. But Draco heard none of what Snape or Ron were saying, all what fell to his ears were the light rustling of clothes as Harmony picked at her shirt. He had handed her a handkerchief, which he followed with his eyes as she used it to collect vanilla. She handed it back to him, and Harmony said not a word. The last direction was for the potion to settle in the dark for a night. He collected it into a glass vessel and covered it. Draco was thankful that the students who finished could leave early. He left before her, but stood near the entrance.
"It's not me," Draco countered, "something's changed with her." Ginny looked at him closely and stepped away.
There on the windowsill pearing through were two almond brown eyes and a pale white face. She jumped in shock, and it gave a series of hoots in response. It was a barred owl with creamy white and tan mottled feathers that glowed in the earlier morning light. One of its talons was outstretched with a note tied to it. The window creaked open, allowing a waft of cool air to pass her frame, and she untied the small parchment. She was glad that this owl had not pecked at her with its small yellow beak. The note looked freshly written, with ink that had not fully dried; she looked down at the parchment.
"Damn it," she closed her eyes and leaned against the wall, "just hurry, Snape will think that I have strangled you."
"STOP!" Harmony steeled herself, staring into those red serpentine eyes. She stepped toward him. "You can kill me," she said, "but I promise you, it won't get you what you want."
"Would you?" Snape almost yelled. The Dark mark, which he had seen most of his life, now settled with revulsion. Draco grit his teeth.
"You do, Harry" Dumbledore almost pleaded. "It is in your heart; all the emotions that he cannot stand, to love someone, and to be compassionate towards one enough to sacrifice for them. Voldemort knows not of those things."
"There would be an outcry if the rest of the wizarding world knew. So much publicity is already on her, any more would make her ego explode." There was that cursed word again. What was Snape on anyway, too many fumes and no ventilation were bad for his health. He already had problems, but this just was pushing it.
"Better," Snape said and left Draco, he turned to Harmony and the girl stiffened. "ready?" It looked like he didn't give her any time to guard herself at all. Draco could tell that Harmony had everything in a nice neat package for Snape to ravage through. He almost felt sorry for her. Snape frowned at the girl. "Are you even trying?"
"Those are thestrals, and only those who have witnessed death can see them." Luna announced to the small cluster.
"No, the professor got some vision and shouted that I'd die a woman and some other crap," Harmony said as Draco laughed at her. She wondered why they were still walking together. "So I'm going to go to Professor McGonagall and ask her to switch me out of that class."
All at once the pain stopped, and Draco pulled enough strength together to raise his head. In time to see that very thing that haunted him, the only thing that could ruin everything. Harmony had launched herself at the Dark Lord as a caracal. He could see the bones snap in the Dark Lord's hand. He watched, as she stood in front of him, protectively, and reverted back into a girl.
"After you." Draco said with a hand that gestured out to the open window. He laughed that he was acting more courteously to Potter's owl than he had to any other living thing since Potter disappeared. But none of that mattered. If no one else knew where Potter was hiding, her owl would know; it was part of their own brand of magic.
The screech from the dragon could have been heard miles away, and Harmony sank into the tree trunk as it pointed its head up. A livid snarl came from Voldemort as she kicked the beast in the neck, "you will obey me!" The dragon would have none of that, it twisted its body, throwing itself at trees, trying to shake the mad women off. Harmony pulled herself shakily up and went where she had last seen her wand. With it in her hands, she faced Voldemort who had wisely dismounted the dragon and was now trying to avada kedavarait. "You worthless traitor!" Voldemort howled. With the dragon gone, she snapped her head at Harmony and breathed in short gasps. "It doesn't matter, I still am more powerful." Their wands were pointed at each other and Harmony smirked at Voldemort.
"I'll call you whatever you look like at the time then, just so long as you don't call me professor. No need for formality when the other students are not present. Oh, and remember that these lessons are basically secret."
She began to pick the stems of grass around her. Peace, she reminded her brain. Her thoughts went through the lectures that Leighton was teaching her. The meditation would calm her, and she needed to practice the nonverbal spells anyway.
Hermione's brown eyes flashed in concentration. "Incendio," she said. A gust of fire materialized and Harmony put up a hand, wordlessly, and the fire puffed out in smoke. Hermione watched the girl in disbelief, and Harmony shrugged her shoulders.
But Harmony found that she had six months of habits ingrained into her. She was embarrassed to find that she started to miss certain things, only after a day. Not having anyone to hold, or kiss, or flirt with, was strange. Even worse, Harmony had plenty of opportunities to antagonize Ron Weasley, and she had no one to share in the fun. Where could a girl get an audience, or better yet, a Slytherin audience, when she needed it?
"You'd better change back before anyone sees," Draco persisted to look anywhere but at the girl, but he was aware as she shrugged her shoulders and shifted her body. He let out a breath he had no idea he was holding and faced the now boyish looking Potter. But still his heartbeat skittered, he could see the girl in his mind's eye, and he could not turn away from Harmony. Looking at the boy now, it was easy to fool himself into thinking that Potter was disgusting.
She rolled her eyes at him before crossing her arms in front of her chest. "Cooperation? Don't make me laugh. If you work with me, we have to be partners- and not you just telling me what to do."
As the two girls returned, Blaise called out to them by a stand at the side of the room and asked, "does anyone want a drink?" As he carefully poured something bright blue into glasses with miniature umbrellas.
She unbent a paperclip, poking it through the keyhole on the door, turning it patiently until she heard the lock click.
Hermione didn't talk for a moment. just mulling over the information. She finally shook her head with a wry half smile on her face. "People I thought I knew, they just keep finding ways to surprise me."
"You look like Harry as well," Remus took a few steps closer and squinted in the dark. "Sorry, it's just that I have been searching for him for awhile now..."
"I have some grave news," Snape said, "from your family. This is a letter which your Father has written. I can only guess the contents, but here it is." Snape handed him a folded up letter that did not have the usual Malfoy seal or wax stamp. It crinkled as Draco slipped a finger and opened it.
"Nothing, I just wanted to see you." Something was wrong because no guy would say that to another guy with a serious expression. She could barely keep her eyes away from his intense stare. "You look better though without your glasses." Was he flirting with her, she would have laughed three days ago as a boy, but now she felt a bit intimidated and unsure. He continued to smirk and stare. Was she still capable of besting him in a match; was she even equal to him anymore? It was like he could see right passed her mask and see the squirming girl she had become.
Someone bumped into her, and Harmony fell against Draco. She held on to his arm as she regained her balance on her high heels. "Sorry," she mouthed, and Draco touched her bare shoulder blades. Of course Ginny would get a dress that would show a good portion of her back.
"Start over what? Over four years of absolute dislike. What do you think?" She trailed her fingers against the walls as she walked and turned her head away from him.
"True," he said, "we havn't had a match yet. I think the next Gryffindor verses Slytherine game is in spring this year."
"What nonsense is this?" But he was beginning to put it together, and he swore under his breath. His dark mark twisted at the skin, burning and commanding him to obey.
Except ask her out, nothing out of the ordinary. "I'm fine," Harmony said, and turned to the window.
The bottom level was a maze. All along the walls were doors evenly spaced apart by two feet. Some of them had little engraving that were far too cracked to read. The hall divided and when she took her wand to point her the right way, it took her further down the sloping hall. Torches with blue light lined the floor. She took another turn, and knew that if she had to run back, she would instantly be lost. The doorknobs that she tried were mostly fastened, and the ones that opened were empty save for straw on the floor and chains hung from the ceilings. A faint gray light came from the space where a door and the floor not quite touched. The air swelled with a mist that had nowhere to escape.
The next thing Draco knew was that he was on a bed and in the worst pain he had ever experienced in his life. This was a hundreds times worse than when that mad hippogryph nearly took his life. His skin felt like it was burning alive and worse was the vomit that just wouldn't stop. The fever had wrapped his mind delirious and he gladly took whatever the nurse was offering. He could just barely make out what was happening around him, and voices echoed like bugs in his ears.
"Hah, you wish," Nott said from where he leaned against the wall, he flipped his wand in the air and grinned. "You better watch yourself, Potter. There's more of this waiting for you."
Footsteps echoing through the halls, alerting Draco to regain his composure. Harmony then put on glasses that had been tucked away in the folds of her robe. When the last of the desks were filled, a dark cloak swept into the room, signaling the entrance of the professor. Snape waited on no one.
Harmony rested on her bed, and closed her eyes in peace. She did not have to worry about her Gryffindor mates seeing her as a girl anymore, since Proffesor McGonagal had gladly given her an unused room in the common rooms. Harmony had it constantly locked, and wondered why she hadn't gotten her own room earlier. Ron and the others did not protest her removal, because it had been the time during which she had the temperament of a raging Snape.
"In that case, the Ministry will get back to you by owl when we register the story. Have a nice day." The three apparated and wisely left the two homicidal men.
It was like Malfoy saw him there for the first time, like he was sizing him up and the odds were against him. He scowled and looked up at him; gray meeting honey, and overall dislike. Malfoy went into his robes and retrieved a small piece of parchment paper with tittles scribbled on them.
Severus bowed and dismissed himself. He only nodded at Lucius as he left. And he could only hope that he had done the right thing.
"Is that you, Pot‚Äî" Harmony instantly reacted, and reached up with her hand to cover his mouth. Her anger flared.
"Harry," Ron said in all serious tones, "did you just say that you are going to Magical Fitness? The class filled with raging girls?" Harmony nodded her head. "You lucky bugger," Ron grinned, "but what will I do without you in Divinations? It will be so boring."
"I am really sorry Harry." Dumbledore stopped for a moment. Harry put his hand to his chest to see if he was growing anything, and fortunately his hand felt his flat chest. Okay, so Dumbledore finally became raving bonkers.
Draco put his book bag onto the desk in his room and sat on his bed. He could see his reflection from where he sat, and knew that it was an understatement to say that he was easy on the eyes. There was nothing not to like. And his muscles were quite defined considering that the only sport at Hogwarts was sitting on a broom.
"Oh and I heard that you are a spoiled prat who thinks he's so great, but who really needs his cronies to act strong in order to hide his craven little self. I know so many people like you who enjoy belittling others and tormenting innocent people." Dud was turning an interesting violet (much like Vernon's infamous Crayola purple) and had his fist clenching and unclenching. "So, are you going to hit a girl too?"
Harmony shoved her clothes into her locker, and flattened her hair with her hands. "You look good in a tank top." Harmony turned to him and lifted an eyebrow. Thankfully he was fully clothed. He must have been referring to yesterday considering the over sized shirt covered the most of her.
"Very good then, I would still like to know what had happened from the two of you though." Harmony agreed and gave an abridged version of the story with Leighton taking over when he came in. All the while Dumbledore nodded his head without interruption.
"Are you alright Frisker?" Draco looked up at their professor, through eyes watering with pain. He could feel the blood pulsating from his wound, and he sat up extending his hands to cover the wound.
"Well I hope you both know what you're doing." Draco forced his body to relax as he heard the two moving closer to him. Unfortunately, they stopped by his bed. He was tempted to fake a snore, but he knew that no Malfoy would ever make such an obscene noise, even when in sleep; much too out of character, even if he was a brilliant actor.
"This year we have a transfer student to be sorted first." McGonagall announced, "Harmony Black." Harmony took in a heavy breath and stepped up, aware that some people were chattering while she was walking forward. But it wasn't like the time when she was Harry Potter. No one held their breath, or expected anything from her. McGonagall placed the sorting hat on her head when she sat.
"Let's just get this over with." Harmony pulled out the list of ingredients and Draco went with her to the supply room. Other students were milling around, and Harmony scrunched her nose as soon as they stepped in. "Why does it smell like earthworms and vinegar?" she muttered.
Fifteen minutes later the eleven of them were staring at two ordinary muggle houses on Grimmauld's place. Severus showed Harmony a paper with an address which Moody promptly burned, and when Harmony looked up from this display of arson there was a dark little house there that wasn't quite there before.
She didn't have her glasses on, but her Harry face was good enough as she made her way to the kitchen door. There was a stifled hiss from beyond the kitchen and Harmony knew that Kreacher must be up. "Great," Harmony muttered under her breath and turned to leave.
"I'm not sure, Harmony, but Dumbledore has a reason for everything he does." Harmony didn't say anything, but nodded her head. She slipped the ring on her other hand, and they went down the staircase.
Never tickle a sleeping dragon. Her answers had only added to his first spark of interest. She knew almost too much about dragons.
"Harry Potter!" Voldemort amplified her voice and a chorus of Death Eaters jeered, "See what I have become? Come out and play with me or Hogwarts will burn." A jet of fire snaked around the Gryffindor tower, and Harmony watched as windows shattered.
Draco looked bored in Potions as he and Harmony waited for the cauldron to heat up and turn the potion violet. He had already staged some fights between them, but it didn't seem to be working. "Watch it Potter," Draco warned.
There was an outbreak of applause as piles of food materialized on all the long tables. Children laughed in delight as their favorite foods were scrapped onto their plates. Potatoes, meat pies, vegetables, chicken legs, a whole roast pig, creamy soups, spaghetti, pumpkin juice, and an assortment of fruits weighed the table down.
"Alright," Harmony mumbled, "if you say so." Draco looked at her for a second longer and turned to leave. He gripped the locket as his thoughts turned worse. He was losing her. She didn't need him. Why would she, when she had someone like Leighton? No. He erased those thoughts. Draco would make her fall for him. Anything less was not an option.
The mystery of what happened to our beloved hero remains unsolved. Is Harry Potter alive? Did the dragon devour him in the final moments? Is he out there, wounded and tear stricken in hopes to be found, but unable to? Despite the fact that Harry's broken glasses and burned robes were discovered next to You Know Who's corpse, many out there still have hope. There is much speculation on what could have happened. Harry's best friend, Ron Weasley, remarks in tears, 'he can't be dead, he'll come back for us, like he always does.' Ron pauses, in clear and loyal friendship, as he puts a hand over his heart, 'He knows where home is'. Touching is beyond words as people celebrating the fall of the Dark Lord yearn for their hero. Harry Potter, where ever you are, our eyes will always search for you.
