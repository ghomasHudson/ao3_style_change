Oh, and any character bashing (Snape/Hagrid) is in character so minor warnings for that I guess?
‘Oh, yeah, it’s a good thing, I’m just trying to remember what I ever did to Farley in the year we were at Hogwarts together that she’s being so nice to me.’
He caught the way Pansy’s eyes snagged on his cheeks, no longer hollowed out and gaunt as they’d been when they last saw each other, and the way she noticed the healthier colour he’d managed to push into his skin with all the time spent outdoors per Pomfrey’s recommendations. Even in the abysmal British summer, he’d managed to put some life back into his skin until it was pale but not grey.
‘I’m not sure that would have helped,’ Draco admitted. ‘A focus on mind magic, might have.’
‘Never,’ Harry assured him but then he grinned, ‘You do look a bit wrecked mind.’
‘I love you,’ Harry croaked out.
Harry held Draco tighter and let himself think about how it had all begun. He might have talked it over with his mind healer and he’d talked it through with Draco (more than once) and even alluded to it with Hermione after that awkward conversation which had seen her start hugging him all the time, but he’d never properly set about acknowledging what it all meant.
‘I need to hate you both for a little while,’ she tells them, reiterates her point from earlier really.
‘Probably Madam Pomfrey, too.’
Joseph’s eyebrows rose and he turned to study the class. ‘How many of you have successfully cast this spell?’
‘Hermione was the one to ask me to bring you today,’ he informed Ron, glancing quickly over at his friend and away again. ‘I actually had plans with Pansy.’
But Hermione didn’t know his secrets. She didn’t have an openness about her that let her see what others couldn’t, like Luna did. She wasn’t like Ginny, having been on the outside for so many years, that she’d been able to see things people missed (or had Voldemort take her over and show her how powerful and influential he could be – as
Harry could appreciate that she made a point of using Draco’s name and not his surname, though he suspected she was doing it more to set him at ease before she launched into an interrogation than because she felt he was deserving of the familiarity. He might have smiled if he wasn’t so worried. He definitely wouldn’t be putting off explaining much longer, but perhaps this had given him the opening he needed?
Draco laughed. ‘Probably.’ It was nice – weird, but nice to think that the woman behind all the insightful articles in the paper was a Slytherin slowly proving that not all Slytherins were bad. Hermione definitely had a point about that.
‘How is he?’ Ron asked. It looked like the question cost him. Ron didn’t want to care; he didn’t want to feel for Draco but for the second time in less than a month he was looking at Draco in the Hospital Wing cursed and broken, and Harry could see it wasn’t sitting well with him. He could see how much Ron wanted to hate Draco, to lash out and be uncaring but he could also see that Ron believed his words from the day before, that he truly believed that what the Ministry was doing was wrong.
‘Years probably,’ Harry agreed. ‘And I’d never quite manage to admit to myself that it meant anything, and I’d have kept dating Ginny and I’d have married her too. Probably.’
‘Harry,’ Luna scolded, reaching out behind her to gently stroke the peeling atrocity of wallpaper on the internal wall. ‘He didn’t mean that,’ she crooned.
Really. He didn’t. But it was so hard to let go of all the things they’d been through together even when his heart hurt, and the sting of betrayal felt fresh with every glance.
Draco waved a dismissive hand at this, ‘Oxford and Cambridge both have Magical colleges but they’re next to useless unless you want to spend the rest of your life in academia. We persist in being an apprenticeship-based society.’
Draco disarmed Dumbledore.
‘I’ve never had much faith in your plans.’
‘No,’ Harry confirmed. ‘Someone laid it down during the rebuild.’
He’d thought about it.
‘She what?’ Draco blinked, nonplussed, at the shy first year.
‘Thank, Merlin,’ Harry agreed.
‘She asked me to go with her to Hogsmeade,’ Neville admitted with a blush when he realised both Draco and Harry were looking at him again.
‘Of course, it’s not right,’ Harry snapped, his anger flaring anew. It deflated pretty quickly when he saw Hermione’s hurt expression and Ron’s raised eyebrows. It wasn’t his friend’s fault and he shouldn’t be taking his anger out on them, but he couldn’t exactly take his anger out on the people truly responsible. He really had done everything he could to keep Draco from worse punishment. There were members of the Wizengamot who thought Draco should have been sentenced to life in Azkaban like his father. There were some who had raised the idea of the Dementor’s Kiss.
‘I’ve got you, I’m here, I’m here, you’re safe,’ the words were soft, a gentle refrain of patience and love and Harry flailed as he tried to make sense of the soft words, the gentle touch, after being trapped in an endless loop of nightmares that were still clawing at the edges of his mind trying to break free of the box he desperately shoved them into.
This time, he swore in French. Hermione’s eyebrows shot up and he thought he caught Sinistra’s lips twitching in amusement, but Harry was suddenly looking at him, eyes sharp and concerned because he was very familiar with how Draco liked to swear and more than familiar with his tendency to use French when things were bad.
He thought about the other things Ron had said then too. It hadn’t been a good conversation, marking their reunion with questions and doubts and which had made it almost too easy to steer the conversation toward them, to what they’d been doing in Australia and if they’d been successful. But Harry remembered Ron’s scoffed words, his fervent belief that Death Eaters – Draco included – deserved what they got and more because they’d hurt and killed so many people. He thought about Bill, with his scars and his taste for rare meat. He thought about Fred, killed in the final battle, and it was so easy to feel as Ron did, so easy to think that all Death Eaters deserved much worse than a life sentence in Azkaban.
I went over this one approximately 17 times in an attempt to make sure it conveyed exactly what I wanted it to so I really hope you picked up on the way this marks a change in the Ron storyline. Also, I have been waiting ages to use this chapter just for that last moment.
Draco tugged his arm free. ‘It’s fine.’ Draco started moving up the stairs toward McGonagall’s office. The Headmistress swept after him, lips pursed. Draco appreciated that this didn’t sit well with her but there wasn’t much she could do about it. There wasn’t much Harry could do about it either but that didn’t stop him from trying.
It wasn’t. She and Ron tried to talk to him, tried to get an explanation out of him but he didn’t seem to think the details were important.
Given how badly hurt Draco had been when he’d returned from that last job, Harry was surprised but he’d take it. If Winthrop was feeling guilty for standing by and not realising Draco had been hurt
What he could do was check for anymore traps and curses that might be waiting to be triggered. With his wand held firm, he cast one of the most basic detection spells his mother had taught him, one he’d learned long before he’d found he actually like the idea of becoming a curse breaker. It didn’t show him anything but that didn’t deter him. Whoever had set the trap had been good, especially if it had lain dormant for months, so many students and teachers passing over it daily.
‘It shouldn’t have,’ Hermione huffed. ‘I still can’t believe he said all those things about you.’
He wasn’t betraying Draco, telling his friends this, all this information was on record with the Wizengamot from Draco's trial. He was just saying it now because he wanted his friends to understand that what they knew about Draco was only the tip of the iceberg. He wondered if he’d ever get them to understand that what he’d thought he’d known all those years was only the beginning, that he’d seen what he expected to see, what he’d wanted to see, from an arrogant rich prat who swanned about like he owned everything and everyone was simply beneath him.
‘Think we’ll be home for dinner?’ Harry wondered.
And, oh, Harry remembers that now, remembers how upset Ginny had been remembering Fred, how he’d been thinking about being anywhere but the party and how when they’d been tangled together in the tub, Ginny riding him, he’d only been able to think about Draco. About how differently he’d have been handling the day if only he’d been able to see Draco. His drink addled mind had been drowning in the guilt of being half the reason Fred was dead and Ginny was a mess and all he’d wanted was to walk away, to wrap himself around Draco and hide from the world.
Harry grinned. ‘Yeah, alright.’
Harry laughed, a soft relaxed chuckle that likely seemed out of place to anyone watching. ‘Have I told you how much I love how uninvested you were in being a Death Eater?’
.’ Harry looked up at him helplessly and repeated, ‘I couldn’t let you go.’
‘That’s a no then.’ Longbottom looked thoughtful. ‘I’ll keep your secret.’
And it was probably a completely inappropriate reaction given the importance of the conversation, but Draco couldn’t help it, he smirked. Harry grinned sheepishly, eyes sliding sideways to look at Draco, eyes lit with mirth.
Harry gave him a sour look. Draco grinned.
Draco could talk about the way Harry hadn’t felt comfortable confiding in anyone in second year and the terror of fourth year. Most of fifth year. And the way sixth year had confirmed for him how alone he truly was when no one would take his concerns seriously. The one time he’d tried desperately to talk to an adult, and they’d all blown him off. Worse still, Snape and Dumbledore had known he was right and done nothing to put his mind at ease, they’d done nothing to reassure him that things were being taken care of.
Harry shrugged, ‘Yeah, I guess I do.’
Coming back to Hogwarts might have been part of his probation after his term in Azkaban but it was also an important step in reclaiming his life as his own. He needed to get decent NEWTs if he had even a hope of getting a decent job – something he’d never even considered before Voldemort. But more than that, this year would be a buffer of sorts, allowing him a foray into the wizarding world without actually stepping out into it. It was a year, where he could keep his head down and work on his studies, it was a year where he could show the changes he’d made to his life and his attitude, one more year to prepare himself for the harsh realities of life as an ex-Death Eater in the wizarding world.
But he wasn’t anyone else, he was a convicted Death Eater. Most of the aurors he was called to work with hated him, they didn’t care what kind of situation they dragged him into, they didn’t care if he was hurt or injured, they probably wouldn’t care if he was killed as long as he solved their problem for them first.
talked about Kingsley’s role. The front page of the paper gave over to a large picture of Kingsley standing in the Ministry Atrium holding a Ministry-wide meeting. Draco had (thankfully) not been forced to attend that (perks of technically being a tool of the Ministry and not a paid employee) but Arthur had and somehow, in the midst of their arranging the portkey to trick Harry into returning to his auror training, Draco had found himself discussing the changes at the Ministry and offering
‘Swiss?’
‘What was I supposed to say?’ Harry mused. ‘I didn’t even know I fancied him.’ He considered that. ‘I mean, I didn’t fancy him, not then, but bloody hell Hermione, he took up a lot of my time.’
Luna looked at him calmly before her eyes travelled down to rove over his chest and down his legs before coming back up to meet his eyes with a satisfied smile. ‘You’ve healed.’
After his stag had cantered away through the wall into the castle, Harry drew his leg back up and settled in once again to stare moodily out over the grounds in an attempt to figure out just how he was supposed to explain everything to his friends who simply hadn’t been around. He didn’t begrudge them their trip to Australia. He understood how desperately Hermione had wanted to find her parents and restore their memory. Even if they would never have all of their memories back now, he didn’t hold her time with them against her. He didn’t hold it against Ron that in the wake of the war and Fred’s death he’d wanted to get away and that he’d not wanted Hermione to struggle with her parents alone.
‘Well, yeah,’ Harry replied, trading a confused look with Hermione. ‘I thought you knew that’s what all these private lessons were about. Robards’ original plan was for me to be done with training and sit exams in October, but I didn’t want people to be able to say I only got the job because I’m the
There was no comfort to be taken from having to completely cleanse the castle and the house elves could still be found coaxing castle magic back into certain places within the castle now that all the unnecessary spells and enchantments had been removed. Draco had never been especially attuned to the castle before, most of his magic seemed to focus on Malfoy and Black properties but Harry and Luna sensed the difference in the castle now that the centuries of interfering magic had been removed.
‘Oh, Ron,’ she whispered softly – sadly. ‘That’s – that’s good,’ Hermione added, for wont of anything better to say. ‘That you’re acknowledging these things. But – you must know, Harry and I never thought that you were any less important than us. We never…’ she didn’t know how to continue. What else could she say? She’d always known that he was jealous of Harry, not necessarily because he wanted to be the Boy Who Lived or the Chosen One but because his friend was rich and powerful and so good that it was hard to be in his shadow sometimes.
Harry’s soft “oh” suggested he’d only just cottoned on to what they were talking about. ‘Hold on,’ he said, ‘Ron and Hermione are having sex?’
Kreacher disappeared with a soft snap – so far removed from the sharp cracks he once travelled with and a physical reminder that he was being properly cared for now. Draco looked up to see Hermione scowling at him in disapproval. Draco ignored her look and took a seat beside her on the sofa, spreading some of the papers he was carrying across his lap and onto the floor at his feet.
It didn’t start in that bathroom.
So that was the next two years sorted but both he and Harry had readily agreed they didn’t want to live in the Manor or Grimmauld Place permanently and so were still debating just where they were planning to go after all the renovations were finished.
Please heed the tags, this chapter contains references to non-con. Also fat shaming.
Harry nodded, most of his attention on his search. If he focused on that he could ignore the way his heart was racing at Ron’s tone and that he really did need to just come out and say the words. He could have said something about how Ron was getting Hermione something so why wouldn’t he get Draco a gift, but he didn’t. Months of thinking about and planning for this moment and he was still going to put it off as long as possible.
Harry, who had quite literally died and therefore been through much more problematic and certainly more dire situations, was similarly calm when he said, ‘Me either.’
While he’d been talking with Kreacher, Harry had guided Granger to the end of one of the tables and got her seated before he’d slipped around to sit across from her. Draco sat beside Harry and folded his arms on the table as Harry reached out to take both of Granger’s hands in his.
Behind him, Harry straightened and offered a single nod.
Winthrop, who had been with Harry when Draco had last performed a break on some of Voldemort’s wards, shuddered and said, ‘Let’s not do that.’
‘Can you stand?’
‘Draco?’ he croaked, squinting through tear-filled eyes into the darkness.
Draco had coughed to clear his throat and straightened up, grateful the urge to hug her had passed and now he was just left scrambling madly to pull himself back together. Correcting her was about the only thing holding him together then because he’d been rather in the mood to go and find Harry wherever he was, drag him back to his (what would absolutely become their) room and fuck him into the mattress. Or potentially up against a wall. He wasn’t too picky right in that moment. Someone he never thought in a million years would accept their relationship had literally just given her blessing and it was weird. He’d needed something to ground him and spin everything back to normal.
‘And that’s where they took him?’ Ron asked, pale beneath his freckles. ‘To do something the Ministry thought was too dark and dangerous for their trained curse breakers?’
‘Would you stop getting distracted,’ Draco grumbled, grabbing Harry’s arm to start him up the next set of stairs. ‘Mary Avery was mid-breakdown when she gave her lecture on preventative charmwork – from what I remember Albert O’Keefe had just broken her heart and NEWTs were a real struggle for her. She wasn’t in the mood to give a proper educational speech about safe sex.’ Draco considered the terrifying hour-long lesson he and his classmates had been subjected to in one of the dungeon classrooms and felt his lips twitch with amusement. ‘Looking back, the whole thing is actually quite hilarious – though not nearly as fun as the year Daphne and I had to do it.’
Harry may have visited him every day but the hour he’d stayed never seemed like enough. The warmth and peace he brought, the comfort of words and smuggled healing potions did only so much to penetrate the hours and hours Draco was alone in his cell. His mother was never allowed to visit and even if she’d been able, Draco wouldn’t have wanted her to know just how bad it was. He would never have wanted her to see her only son like that.
They’d talked marriage and kids and about how Harry could finally have pets because there’d be someone home to feed them if work kept him late and it had all been so perfect. He wants that life with Draco, the one they’ve imagined lying in Draco’s big bed in the cottage with the big window that overlooks the garden that is just the tip of a massive parcel of land that has room for children playing and friendly Quidditch matches. Where the woods overflow with magic and they can have the kind of family and the kind of life they had both been denied growing up.
And if Harry Potter could wield such darkness, then what was the point? Where was the light and the dark? Where was the line that Draco had crossed?
Hermione stopped giggling to glare at Draco. ‘That’s not what I said.’ She turned to Harry. ‘It’s just that we’ve been friends for so long, we do go out, but we’ve always gone to the Three Broomstick’s or just eaten a meal together, it’s not like that’s changed.’
Because Draco did the same. He’d drop his book onto the nightstand with a thoughtful thump and explain to him in halting words about the time he’d realised his father would rather buy him things than sit and talk to him. He could kick him under the dinner table and profess a deep loathing for lemon tarts but that he ate them anyway because they were his mother’s favourite and he wanted to share that with her.
Draco knew exactly how this was going to go. He watched as every student turned to look at him, almost each and every one with a nasty look on their faces. Granger was the only exception, she looked interested in a way that was not purely academic. Draco thought the nasty look on Girl Weasley’s face was directed somewhere else entirely.
But he’d known what would happen if he succeeded. What had already happed with Katie Bell (who he knew only as an exceptional chaser, though he’d never admit it) and with Weasley and a bottle of wine meant for someone else.
They wouldn’t realise until the next morning that they hadn’t been quite as lucky as they’d hoped in avoiding the press but by then both he and Harry had other things on their minds.
Harry didn’t open his eyes, but his lips tugged up into a smile when he replied. ‘Tiny wedding,’ he agreed, voice soft and filled with affection, ‘just family. We should have four kids.’
Half asleep, he said, ‘You know we could sign the paperwork tomorrow.’
How could Hermione hate someone who gave everything of himself to someone else? Someone she loved?
How did he tell them about his childhood and the things he’d experienced here at Hogwarts when he never told them before? For some of it they’d been right here with him, supporting him and encouraging him.
‘He slipped it on while I was asleep,’ he told his best friend’s father. He smirked at a sudden thought. ‘Jokes on him, I left him having breakfast with Ron and Hermione.’
‘Night!’ he called cheerfully after her. Once they were in their room Draco made zero moves as though he were up for sex. ‘I’m way to tired,’ he told Harry.
After witnessing the way he and Harry duelled in class she was left wondering what changes they were talking about. She’d thought they meant the way he was quiet now, the way he didn’t seek attention and spout off his horrible words and flaunt his money and his family name. Watching him duel with Harry, watching him more than hold his own with her friend, was something else altogether.
‘He is,’ Harry confirmed, turning his head to smile softly (probably looking besotted) at Draco.
Draco gave him a very dry look in response and kicked him none-to-gently in the thigh.
‘Well, you didn’t exactly make it sound that way. A “proper date”,’ Draco scoffed.
Harry smiled. ‘He’s bloody brilliant.’ Then he frowned, more amused than annoyed and added, ‘He knows it too.’
And then Ron said horrible things and Hermione was forced to choose. Oh, Harry didn’t ask her to, made quite the point of telling her he didn’t want to come between them, but how could she not choose Harry? Ron’s insecurities got the better of him and he said stupid things but days and weeks after the fact and Hermione could see that he needed to say those things and do those things because he wasn’t over the war any more than she was – or Harry was with his nightmares. If calling Harry homophobic slurs brought to light the ways in which Ron still needed to heal then that could only be for the better.
‘Explains,’ Draco paused to take a ragged breath and winced sharply, ‘explains the…feeling like a-a giant…sitting…chest.’ His words were a wheeze, each one seemed to make it harder and harder for the next to come out.
‘Sleep,’ she told him softly. ‘It’s okay, Draco.’  He heard all the things she wasn’t saying in those words. He knew she’d stay; knew she wouldn’t leave him alone and unconscious somewhere he didn’t feel truly safe. The Hospital Wing wasn’t his heavily warded room in the eighth-year dormitory, it didn’t have the protections McGonagall had placed around it, nor the additional ones he’d put up. He was at Hogwarts, he should be safe, but this attack had proved how untrue that was.
He had no qualms about telling her all of this. He still didn’t think Granger quite understood what he was saying. He couldn’t blame her, he was talking about her never being able to talk to her parents again, but he thought she was beginning to consider he might have a point. That didn’t make it easier to hear and it certainly didn’t mean she was just going to accept it, but he thought she understood where he was coming from at least.
Not Draco who had served his time. Who had gone into Azkaban already broken and found himself shattered. His very self fractured and splintered until there was nothing left but hurt and pain, and the terrifying fear that came with realising everything you’d been taught to believe was wrong. That everything you’d been raised to think and feel was something that you should be ashamed of. That in order to live and be okay with the choices he made, that he needed to change his entire understanding of the world.
‘He was human, Harry,’ Hermione defended. ‘He was allowed to make mistakes.’
Harry scowled. ‘I’m really glad you weren’t here.’ He said it sharply and wasn’t at all sorry about that. He ignored the way Ron turned to look at him, ignored the searching affronted look his best mate was likely giving him.
‘Liar,’ Draco laughed.
‘What would that have changed, Harry?’ Draco asked. ‘Voldemort would still have wanted it; he’d still have wanted you.’ He didn’t mention (again) the reasoning that with Voldemort’s focus on the Ministry it gave the Order some control over the situation.
Harry snorted. ‘It wasn’t much of a crisis to be honest. It was two solid months of thinking about you all the time, of dreaming about you. And a lot of revelations about our past.’
‘That’s rough,’ Longbottom chimed in, coming up behind them with Hannah Abbot. He clapped a hand on Draco’s back in sympathy. ‘Hannah and I are doing the greenhouses.’
‘No,’ Joseph announced, ‘I think this is exactly what we need.’
Luna waved her hand. ‘Did you know that being hungover is one of the only times you can see withering willow wasps?’
Pansy flapped her hand, as though it didn’t really matter, Draco supposed it didn’t. Daphne had done as her parents asked, like a good little pureblood witch.
It seemed Draco wasn’t going to get his wish. Although before he was forced to stand up and intervene someone else did.
At least, that’s what his mind healer said.
‘In Defence,’ Draco hastily clarified because he knew the kind of response such an open question could elicit from Luna.
(See the end of the chapter for
Of course, the fact that he even had to be the one to help Harry infuriated him but reminding Harry how much he missed out on wasn’t what he needed right then. Draco knew that Harry had never viewed Halloween as a day of mourning. Until he was eleven Harry hadn’t even known when exactly his parents died and making that day about them now was something Draco was hesitant to do. Harry had enough people he was mourning; Draco didn’t know how to make him see that mourning his parents wasn’t the same as mourning all those lost during the war.
‘He’s bisexual,’ Hermione corrected.
But thinking about surrogacy and adoption offers up an idea and he blurts it out before he can stop himself. At least his words are soft, ‘Have you thought about getting an abortion?’
‘That poor goat.’
‘Nonexistent,’ Draco answered without hesitation. They were the only two left in the classroom and the scrutiny from Harry’s friends in the doorway and Slughorn at his desk was making Draco’s skin itch. He sighed. ‘Go away, Potter, before Weasley makes a fool of himself and tries to curse me.’
‘Oh my god, he didn’t?’ Hermione laughed.
‘We’re not having a big wedding and I want at least two children.’
Touched by his words, Draco found himself smirking, offering the rejoinder, ‘You’re a sap, Potter.’
He did wish he could have seen their faces when Harry finally extricated himself from his admirers and hurried to catch up to him. He imagined they’d been anticipating a good hexing but all they got was a cheerful, ‘Scored yourself a new wand?’
Oh. He was swaying again.
Draco didn’t think pointing out that he hadn’t been truly capable of most of that before Voldemort died would be helpful. Sure, he’d known all of those spells (and quite a few more) but he’d never been able to use them so effectively before he’d started training with Harry. There were advantages to spending hours every day for a month duelling with Harry Potter. They just weren’t advantages anyone else was likely to acknowledge let alone approve of.
‘What?’
‘Maybe it’s time you asked,’ Neville suggested, speaking up from where he, was once again, sitting under the window and tending his plant in the moonlight. ‘Not just Harry, either. Maybe it’s time you asked Draco to explain why you should forgive him.’
There was a pause before the man spoke. He didn’t turn to look at her, eyes focused on watching his daughter (she looked about six) who was making her way back along the platform. ‘It does,’ he answered and there was something about his voice that seemed familiar to her.
‘I can’t exactly give you advice on making it good,’ Harry laughed uncomfortably. He could give Hermione plenty of advice, but he was not at all ready to have that conversation with Ron. Or Hermione for that matter because thinking about who she’d be using those tips on made his brain want to leak out of his ears.
‘What?’ Harry’s eyes stared beyond Kingsley, the only one to break the silence in the conference room. ‘What did you say?’
Draco snorted. He didn’t want to give Weasley any credit, but he had been friends with Harry and Hermione for years. ‘You don’t think he feels that way when you two spout off something completely muggle?’
‘I’m going,’ Harry said. ‘Lunch?’
Sirius’ smile was bright and full of laughter. The laugh lines around his eyes crinkled in joy as he bounced around the room adding more and more decorations to the room, delighted to have company for Christmas. But Harry watched the joy fade and his godfather become quiet and moody, the light and life of Christmas fading away as the holidays ended and it came time to return to Hogwarts. He took the wrapped parcel and stowed it away knowing he would never use it, that he would never endanger Sirius and he smiled one last time at his godfather never realising it was the last.
‘You still could have come and got us mate,’ Weasley pouted, this time at least his mouth was free of food.
‘I don’t like it any more than you do,’ Draco said softly. ‘But I made the wrong choices and I have to pay for those decisions. Getting pissed off and turning your back on the Ministry because of me is not something I want on my conscience. I have enough guilt weighing me down.’
This time Draco’s laugh was amused, because three days later he was starting to see that it was a little bit funny. ‘I haven’t spoken – obviously – to Hermione but if I had to guess I’d say she feels guilty about talking to Weasley. Guilty about
‘Have you just been secretly gay this whole time?’ she asks.
Draco pulled a face but given his own softening feelings toward the muggleborn he wasn’t about to argue. Especially not with Harry, in the dark, after such a long day. He’d much prefer to be sleeping than thinking about the friendship that was forming between him and Hermione and how the things they had in common could have blossomed into a friendship long ago if he hadn’t been such a git.
They waited for the final barrier ward to come down, but nothing happened. Bill and the four Ministry curse breakers stepped away from the invisible line and came over, looking disgruntled but not ready to give up.
‘That’s not the complication,’ Harry assures him before he says, ‘You need to come over.’
‘You’re a cheesy idiot,’ Draco clarified.
‘Snow,’ Harry answered. ‘Unbroken snow.’
‘There is absolutely nothing wrong with the way Hannah looks,’ Hermione informed Ron hotly, shooting Harry a look for good measure.
He hadn’t given much thought to what his friends must be thinking. Being in a terrible rage over what the Ministry was doing hadn’t exactly left him calm and level-headed enough to have the long overdue conversation he really had been meaning to have with his two best friends.
‘Your Grandfather developed Sleekeasy’s,’ Draco explained softly. He gestured around at the piles of gold. ‘He took your family’s money and tripled it. He sold it when he retired but you still retain twenty percent interest. I don’t know how much that works out to be annually but the goblins will be able to tell you how much you received last financial quarter at least.’
Harry practically skipped up the stairs leaving Longbottom sputtering with surprised laughter in the common room and Draco to trail bemusedly after him. It wasn’t like he could argue with anything Harry had said.
The potion turned out perfectly, just as Draco knew it would and he derived a delicious pleasure from watching Slughorn struggle between his desire to praise Harry for a job well done and his desire to ignore Draco completely as he’d been doing since the start of term. Slughorn settled for a cheerful grin at the potion and another slap on Harry’s back and ignored Draco completely.
‘Yeah,’ Ron smiled dopily, ‘but ‘Mione, Harry’s got muscles. And tattoos!’
‘Such a fucking git.’
‘I have done the homework,’ he offered, without looking away from the pages of his book. If he didn’t look at either of them, he might not have to get involved.
‘Who took him?’ Luna asked, easing onto the window seat beside Harry and crossing her legs until she was sitting with one knee against the glass, her back against the wall.
Draco saw no reason not to mock Harry’s horrible hand-me-downs or point out the impracticality of an Auror wearing glasses. Harry needed those things from him as much as Draco needed the warm smiles and lingering looks that reminded him Azkaban was his past, that Hogwarts was the here and now. That Harry was his future.
‘Have you actually told her this?’ Draco asked, finally giving Harry his full attention.
For a while he just held Harry, hoping that the warmth of his body and soothing touch would be enough, but his boyfriend’s heart was racing, his breathing becoming more ragged the longer he was awake and thinking about the nightmare. He started to move restlessly and Draco gave up on any lingering hopes of more sleep and slipped quietly from the bed.
Hermione’s lips pursed and she muttered something angry about the wizarding prison system that he briefly toyed with responding to, but ultimately decided that wasn’t something he wanted to be subjected to on a cool crisp morning over what could be a pleasant breakfast. Thankfully, she didn’t ask him anything about his time in Azkaban which was a relief. It wasn’t that he didn’t think he could share it with her – the bare bones of his time there in any case – but he needed to be in the right frame of mind to broach the topic and preferably, he’d have Harry there for support.
Harry pulled a face, Draco could feel it against his head, the play of muscles across Harry’s jaw as he worked out how to respond to that. Draco had almost fallen asleep when Harry finally did speak, and for a moment he thought he’d drifted into a dream, the words so surprising.
His thoughts were wandering again, and it took a moment for him to focus back on Harriet. She was the youngest of his little study group, the only one not in Slytherin and muggleborn as well. He didn’t want this to be her impression of magic. He didn’t want to be the one telling her parents that he’d messed up and gotten her killed. She had a little brother who was showing signs of magic, he remembered, a little brother who would never get to know the joy and wonder of magic and Hogwarts if his sister died and her parents found magic to be the cause.
Unconcerned by the sharpness in his tone, Harry did as he’d requested, stepping fully outside to stand in front of Mendenhall and Winthrop. He might have been happy to stand outside and wait but he still felt the need to to casually lean back in – head poking through the bloody ward – just to observe Draco work.
Luna had left the bottle of polish lying about and Harry had picked it up looking for something to do with his hands and after fiddling with the bottle for five solid minutes, Draco had gotten annoyed with his fidgeting and offered his hand declaring in an annoyed hiss that he might as well paint something if he were going to play with it.
Hermione made a noise in her throat. The Snape in the portrait was conspicuously silent.
It was the only thing he could think to say, the only way he could think to tell her he was in.
Prophet an astonishing seventeen times and been featured more than once in both
Draco tipped forward, only just managing to catch himself with a shaky step and he raised one hand to grip the back of Harry’s neck, the other to rest against his cheek. Harry’s own hands came up to grip his forearms. One warm hand closing over the Dark Mark without flinching as they pressed their foreheads together.
Harry’s expression hardened and he stepped closer forcing the fourth year boy to hastily take a couple of steps back. All the more humiliating for him, he tripped over the hem of his robes in his haste and had to be righted by one of his friends. Draco skilfully managed not to smirk, continuing to watch the whole exchange impassively as he sipped on his tea and enjoyed his toast.
Madam Pomfrey did something that had Draco shouting out in pain before he could lock his reaction down and Luna squeezed his hand in sympathy. ‘Fuck,’ he swore when he managed to unlock his jaw again.
Getting Draco to acknowledge when he was hurt was about as easy as petting a dragon. In fact, the entire reason (Harry had furiously discovered) that Draco had ended up in the Hospital Wing was because he’d leapt in front of a curse meant for Auror Winthrop and then lied about having known the counter-curse. Harry had done his fair share of hiding injuries, especially when there was still fighting to be done, but never to the extent that he’d lost an entire fucking lung.
‘There’ll be another meeting with the rest of the teachers, and I think we should include the students, but what it comes down to is that McGonagall would like to be able to offer all magical children the opportunity to learn here and that somehow we’ve got to make it a viable option.’
Harry groaned, swooped in for a quick kiss and then stepped back. ‘For that,’ Harry grouched, ‘you can come running with me tomorrow.’
‘Oh Harry,’ he breathed with such deep affection, when he finally drew his gaze away from the rings to stare at his boyfriend. ‘You great sap.’ His voice was thick with emotion that he did nothing to conceal.
She didn’t understand that while Harry was saving Malfoy, Malfoy was saving him right back.
Ginny raised a sceptical brow.
But that was later.
Harry, who couldn’t help agreeing, once again pointed out, ‘You know you’re the best choice for this.’
Once she was done coughing and spluttering, she spun the paper around and dropped it right on top of Harry’s jam toast. ‘Hey!’ he complained.
Draco considered that with a tilt of his head before he conceded with a sly grin, ‘You know, I can see Ginny teaching you the lube spell.’
But he’s not sure how to start the conversation. He’s not sure how to have all of this out there in one go, words that could make or break his future in ways more complicated than his (not so simple) request for a divorce.
Wayward as his thoughts were, they didn’t distract him from what was happening. He wasn’t going to start jinxing fourth years, they were beneath him.
Only he never actually acted like that and it was both heartening and infuriating. She wanted him to suffer for what he did, but the fact was, he wasn’t going around with his nose up hurling insults or ruling over the younger years as he’d previously done. He talked only to Luna and Ginny (on the rare occasion), although whenever she’d seen him forced to interact, he was unfailingly polite, but he wasn’t being actively punished either. It didn’t matter that he’d apparently been in Azkaban, or that returning wasn’t a choice, he should have been showing signs that he was as broken as the rest of them.
‘You were young and horny and you took sex where you could get it.’
Tonight, she was getting those answers.
She always made sure Harry was there.
First night they’d both had free of extra training and homework and he was being ditched for a bunch of firsties and the Potions classroom.
‘Almost anyone would have helped him if he’d said something,’ Draco said, with all the embarrassment that would have caused Harry, he didn’t think it was a lie. Assuming Dumbledore let them, of course, but that was something else entirely and he wasn’t about to bring that up with Hermione just yet, that was something Harry would have to bring up when he was ready to finally talk about Dumbledore grooming him to die.
Amused, Ginny took great delight in reminding him that the very nature of his bond with Harry said that was completely untrue. He ignored her and the topic of his bond with Harry was finally (temporarily) dropped, thank fucking Merlin.
Draco shrugged and went back to washing his hair. With his eyes shut and head tilted back under the spray he explained his impressions so far. ‘You’re probably better off asking Granger or Weasley,’ he finally admitted. ‘I know too much.’
Luna hadn’t bought his lies and half-truths during the trials and his stay in Azkaban, but she’d also never pushed him for more than he was willing to tell. She’d just made sure she was always there when he needed her and arranged things so that when he wanted to tell someone something, when he wanted to let himself feel, Harry had been there. She seemed to always know when he needed to talk and, somehow, she was always knew what he needed.
Draco truly was providing them with something they’d never had before.
Thankfully, no one tried to scold him for his language. He didn’t think anyone would hold it against him. With a swish of her wand, Madam Pomfrey vanished his jeans as well and the feeling of the cotton disappearing from the torn edges of his skin might not have hurt but it wasn’t a sensation he was keen to relive. Of course, lying in his pants didn’t really leave much mystery and the sharp inhale from Granger and Weasley didn’t come as a surprise.
‘No,’ Draco said, more vehemently than he likely intended. ‘Harry’s got enough on his plate.’
‘I was trying not to think about it.’
He would never force them to forgive Draco, never force them to be his friend or even tolerate him, but he wouldn’t let them make their own opinions be the only ones that mattered. He wouldn’t let them destroy seven years of friendship by dismissing his judgement and failing to trust him. Draco needed him, wanted him, loved him. And Harry needed him and wanted him. He
‘Perhaps we should start running inside the castle,’ Draco suggested, rubbing his icy nose with gloved fingers in a futile attempt to warm it up. ‘My nose is bloody freezing.’
But he didn’t and the next time he woke it was morning, he was stiff and a little achy, but everything seemed to be in working order just as Pomfrey had promised. Aside from the slight numbness where Luna had fallen asleep with her head pillowed on his good arm.
At this, Draco had to roll his eyes. ‘Unlike you, Weasley, I used to talk to people outside of my own house.’
She’d already asked him a dozen questions about magical tattoos and whether or not any of the others interacted with Harry’s (and was just fretting about not having any parchment) when the waitress returned and took their food orders.
What a pleasure that as a Malfoy he would have a front row seat – quite literally.
Of course, shopping in Diagon Alley with Harry and Luna had almost had him reconsidering. The stares and name-calling, the threats and hands reaching for wands, made collecting his school supplies somewhat daunting. He’d stuck it out, though, walked side-by-side with Harry and Luna as they went from shop to shop. He’d heard the sharp words and the hatred; he’d done his best not to let it get to him.
‘I mean, he was defending you,’ he offered in the hopes of consoling her.
McGonagall eyed Draco warily but offered a sharp nod. No one said a word until Dumbledore had walked out of his portrait, Draco breaking the heavy silence with, ‘I will not apologise for my words, Headmistress, after everything he did to Harry, he deserves it.’
‘No,’ Draco told her. ‘It wasn’t supposed to do much more than flutter its wings.’
‘Yes, I do.’
He’d thought Harry had long gotten over his hesitation to share things as he found it so easy to share them with Draco and even Luna, but clearly, he was still struggling with the idea that there were adults out there who loved and cared for him – without fattening him up to sacrifice himself
The moment Draco shut the door behind them, Kreacher appeared. ‘Master Draco is needing dinner.’
They fell into a contemplative silence that was only broken when a restless Ron suggested they kill some time playing Exploding Snap. Harry was happy for the distraction and he and Ginny joined Ron while Hermione and Luna did some homework. Harry probably should have joined them instead, working to chip away at the enormous pile of his own homework, he still had so much to catch up on and Draco and Hermione’s notes could only get him so far, but he wasn’t in any state to concentrate on his schoolwork.
‘Fuck, Harry,’ Longbottom exhaled a loud whistle. ‘You’re not even joking.’
Draco ran a hand through Harry’s hair a few times until his breathing evened out and he was asleep. The picture Harry presented gave Draco an amusing idea and he soon got lost in his work. It was a rough sketch, nothing spectacular and he thought the angle might have made it a little funny, but it was a moment Draco had seen time and again over the last few months. An image, he could recall without the aid of Harry sprawled next to him. He’d spent years memorising Harry’s features from a distance and months doing it up close, it was easy for his fingers to sketch out Harry, eyes closed and relaxed in sleep.
‘Not gay,’ Draco started off correcting, ‘bi. Let’s not get into Harry’s orientation, it starts and ends with me.’
‘Hi,’ Draco murmured before his eyes rolled back in his head and his entire weight dropped down onto Harry.
It was just – did they not understand the terrible loneliness? The anger and hurt and even betrayal he’d felt knowing that his friends were off together just
, Harry couldn’t help thinking.
Weasley pulled a face and Draco just knew he wasn’t going to like the next words out of the Gryffindor’s mouth. ‘She said we needed to spend some time getting to know each other.’
Luna said it had always been there between them, that the attention they’d had for each other had so often eclipsed everything else it was a wonder they’d not noticed sooner. Luna had painted their obsession in a way that created a whole different picture. She’d made Draco’s jealousy of Ron and Hermione apparent in so many of his past actions. She’d placed Harry’s obsessive notice of Draco into a whole other context.
‘Potter,’ Robards barked, his patience fraying, ‘the Ministry is a mess. We need you. We need Malfoy. If we train him up, keep him alive, he’ll keep being a benefit to the Ministry.’
‘She could give it to Ginny,’ Draco said with a smile. ‘Make it a matriarchal seat.’
‘Aren’t those expensive?’ Ron wondered.
She didn’t know what he’d said or done in those quiet moments in Azkaban, but he’d shared every part of himself with Harry and Harry had done the same and they’d healed their souls together, stitching themselves together with love and hope and acceptance and things she shouldn’t need to know. She shouldn’t need answers to so many of her questions. She wished, like the rest of the Weasleys, like Andromeda and Hagrid, that she could just accept it for what it was.
In that moment as he lay bleeding on the cold floor, blood mixing with the water spraying everywhere, he wasn’t Malfoy, he was just Draco and he was a mirror of Harry in all his fears and his terrors and instead of being noticed, instead of being reached in his darkness he’d been punished for it. Punished for loving his parents, punished for not understanding until it was too late that his views were wrong. He was punished for the hopelessness that Harry felt when confronted by his own reality and as he skidded to his knees on the floor, water and blood soaking his pants and his robes, he realised that it wasn’t Malfoy lying on the floor but Draco with old wounds freshly sliced open and a betrayed look on his face.
‘That’s enough, Ron,’ Neville shouted, stepping close into Ron’s personal space and shoving him back with two strong arms.
‘Hermione?’
He didn’t want Draco waking up with strangers around him. He didn’t want Draco experiencing that moment of fear and panic when he opened his eyes to find people he didn’t trust hovering around him.
He watched as Harry, without seemingly aware, started to rub the tops of his feet with his thumbs. It was weird how different it felt to him. One foot, the feeling was distant and soft, almost the ghost of a touch but the other was warm, the pressure soft but sure, sending tendrils of heat radiating warmth through his whole body.
Draco’s conversation with the stall owner wound down and soon they were on the move again, ambling down the lane and stopping here and there whenever something caught Draco’s fancy. The smell was still awful but the longer they walked the more Harry was able to block it out and when he couldn’t, well, Draco smelled really nice, and Harry liked the way he shivered when he burrowed his nose beneath Draco’s scarf to reach skin.
Pinning down an exact moment to give Pansy was difficult but he managed something he thought might have been the right answer. ‘End of fifth year,’ he went with. ‘When I got home from school and Voldemort was holding court at the dining room table.’
stood in a patch of stunning yellow flowers with the moon travelling through its cycle overheard.
‘All night,’ Harry answered.
‘I didn’t mean now,’ Neville muttered behind her, but Hermione ignored him because no, it had to be now.
Hermione seemed quite flattered once Harry had translated his words. She should be, Draco had genuinely meant that as a compliment, Harry could tell.
‘And hideously complex,’ Hermione added thoughtfully, staring off into the distance as though she were mentally going through a potions textbook, considering all the steps and ingredients involved.
His companion who was Draco Malfoy. Draco. Malfoy. Pink hair, nose piercing, dressed like a fucking muggle. Still unmistakeably Draco Malfoy.
But Harry Potter had nearly killed him in a bathroom, and he’d let Death Eaters into Hogwarts. Dumbledore had died (known he would need to die, that he was already dying, and never raised a finger to help to protect Draco, to stop it all or even give Harry the proper training and information he needed) and it had all just been…wrong. Broken. The world was broken, and everything had been upside down and things he’d taken as fact were wrong, but things he’d taken to be wrong weren’t facts because the Chosen One had cut him to ribbons, tearing flesh and muscle and nerves and bone with a single slash and a snarled word.
But not Draco. Not a kid who had chosen his family time and time again. Not a kid who had been raised on certain beliefs and never known they were wrong or that there were other views out there until he’d arrived at school and seen for himself the way the world treated blood and power and those he’d been taught to hate.
Instead, what he got, was Ron leaning against the wall across from their door studying the little bronze nameplate that now read “Draco & Harry” when before the holidays it had just had Draco’s name on it. Harry appreciated that McGonagall wasn’t even pretending anymore, honestly wasn’t sure why she hadn’t just stuck him in there in the first place. Ron’s expression was hard to get a read on and Harry honestly didn’t give a fuck what that was about – this time he didn’t even have to try and convince himself. He was covered in slime that was at least two parts pig’s blood and he had a burn across the back of his calf that stung worse than the burn he’d gotten from the fiendfyre.
He would no longer work for the Ministry. He’d drop out of training, stop taking the private lessons and going on raids to sweep up fleeing Death Eaters and the last of Voldemort’s sympathisers. He would turn his back on a Ministry making choices he didn’t like and risking the life of a teenager because they valued Draco less than they did the Mark on his arm. He didn’t know that it would make a difference to the Ministry, but it wasn’t about that. He wouldn’t be able to face Draco if he stood by and continued to work with the people who so easily put his life at risk. He couldn’t work with people who saw nothing wrong with shackling an eighteen-year-old man and dragging him off to Merlin knew where, just so they could force him to break through Death Eater wards and identify curses favoured by Voldemort and his followers.
That was all Draco had to say and so Harry, with another roll of his eyes, smiled kindly at the girl and translated for his cold boyfriend. ‘That means he’ll help you,’ he told her. ‘Just bring your friends who need help but, uh, probably don’t make it more than four of you.’
He was very good at loaded looks and this one brought up every time Weasley had been a complete berk and abandoned Harry for some slight that was hardly Harry’s fault at all. Given enough time and enough eye contact, he thought he could have Weasley regretting every wrongdoing and betrayal he’d ever committed against Harry.
‘Blood play, Potter?’ Draco quirked a brow with a grin, eyes darting away from his work to lock with Harry’s.
After they’d eaten, Hermione handed Harry her list of muggle subjects she thought wizarding children could benefit from and asked him to add any he thought she’d missed while she picked up the list of student numbers McGonagall had given them.
Draco lets his mask fall and Harry only knows Ginny sees it because he hears her sucked in gasp of surprise as Draco’s whole face softens, his expression becomes warm if not a little cautious. He hopes Ginny sees that hope is buried beneath the caution, he certainly can.
would hardly go over well when Robards received the evaluations for sign-off and saw what he’d been written up for. Robards was firmly of the opinion that Draco was very useful to the Ministry. But also very aware that Harry could and would burn the Ministry to the ground if he was mistreated.
Draco checked his own. It had stopped at 9:23, just minutes after they’d first stepped across the boundary. He cast a
‘She’s only in her early sixties, Dumbledore had more than fifty years on her,’ Draco explained to him. For a moment he wondered if anyone had ever talked to Harry about how long-lived wizards could be, but it probably wasn’t the right time for a conversation like that. Instead, he frowned and mused, ‘He really shouldn’t have been headmaster at his age, no wonder he made so many mistakes.’
‘I think we’ve gotten a little off topic,’ Granger tried to intervene.
Surprised, Draco grinned. ‘Cursing him into a coma would violate my probation.’
Neville sniggered again. ‘Night, Harry.’
‘Why are we running away?’ Luna questioned when he and Harry joined her in the Entrance Hall and Draco started hustling her out the front doors as well.
Luna giggled. ‘He’d already handed it over before you came back and he realised he didn’t have a chance.’
It started, six years from now, in the winter of ’03.
‘You’re making my head hurt,’ she grumbled. ‘Couldn’t you have saved this conversation for the next time you see Bill?’
In a way, Hermione was right, she and Ron had missed a lot, but they’d still been around for the six odd years before the summer and that was where this really started. Besides, Harry was sort of glad his friends had been away all summer. If they hadn’t, he doubted he’d have spent so much time with Draco. He doubted he’d have continued going back after that first time he’d snuck down to see Draco in the Ministry holding cells. He wouldn’t have had the chance. Both of them would likely have talked him out of it. Well, maybe. They’d never managed to talk him out of anything Draco related before.
Harry considered all the work they had cut out for them; all the changes Kingsley and his administration were making in house and all the ones that needed to be made to prevent someone like Voldemort from rising again and taking power. It sounded easy when they joked about it and talked about it in the peace of the Winter Potions Market, but it wasn’t going to be easy, and it wasn’t going to be just a matter of laying out some new laws and expecting everyone to follow. There’d be blowback, protests and a lot of anger, they could only bank on the fear of the war for so long before certain elements started to stand up and fight back, shedding the darkness of the war as though it had been generations ago rather than just last year, in the face of laws and traditions they’d lived by being overturned by a bunch of “young upstarts”.
Ron’s ears turned red and he nodded once before looking away. Harry worked in silence for a while and had made it halfway through the first cabinet when he realised he should have been doing something to catalogue everything he was finding. He made an annoyed sound that drew Ron’s attention.
Draco Malfoy loved Harry Potter, there was no question about that. As much as she wished it were otherwise, as much as she wished there was Ginny or some nice boy they’d yet to meet, Harry loved Draco with everything he had. The things he felt for Draco were all consuming, like his feelings for Draco always had been and – God, looking back it was so stupid to think that there was anything other than attraction to have first caught Harry’s attention.
‘Oh definitely.’
Draco, quite cheerfully, flipped her a couple of well-chosen fingers without looking in her direction. ‘Don’t be bitter, Turpin.’ He actually turned to look at her then, taking in her pyjamas and the blanket she had wrapped around her. ‘You know you could probably room in with Longbottom.’
Then the duel in DADA happened and while Hermione looked desperate to ask questions, he’d been able to deflect them with the honest truth that he’d been doing some auror training over the summer and it had involved a lot of duelling. Then he’d mentioned the ridiculous amount of homework he had to catch up on and Hermione had been so torn between getting answers and not wanting him to fall behind that he’d managed to slip away and hide.
Harry scrutinised the wand and then glanced over his shoulder at its owner. ‘Not very impressive.’
‘Flitwick is outside,’ Ginny told him. ‘All I need to do is get her out the window and he’ll do the rest.’
‘Magic behaves very strangely between us,’ Draco observed. ‘I think it’s time we talked to someone about it.’
‘Stop talking,’ Harry chastised. ‘Rest.’
‘Yeah,’ Harry mumbled agreement around a mouthful of bread. He swallowed and said, ‘But this isn’t even like that. Sirius shouldn’t have been able to connect to the Mark and it’s not like I have a matching snitch and they just copy each other’s movements. Any time Draco and I have skin-to-skin contact it can switch between us.’
He'd only just started to roll the sleeve of Death Eater #3’s robes up to check for the presence of a Dark Mark when the crack of apparition filled the square announcing the arrival of the Ministry team. With a sigh, Draco stowed his wand in its holster, raised his hands to show he was unarmed and took three large steps away from the chained Death Eaters.
Hermione’s eyes gleamed and he had only a moment to consider he might have just made a grave error in judgement before she grinned and said, ‘Deal.’
For those celebrating, Happy Easter!
From his place on the loveseat, Ron grimaced. ‘You’re exchanging gifts with Malfoy?’
Harry gave the question some serious thought before he answered with an honest ‘Yes.’
‘Oh.’ A beat later Weasley muttered, ‘Bloody hell. Yeah, right, okay, I can see why you’re glad it happened over the summer.’
An angry roar spilt the ear, jerking Harry out of his thoughts. Next to him, Charlie swore.
Draco followed Harry back across the common room but paused with his foot on the first step when Longbottom called out to them.
‘I did not,’ Harry informed him. ‘And I was very happy not knowing that thanks.’ He wrinkled his nose. ‘Oh Merlin, now I’m picturing it.’
When he finally had his boots and jeans off, he joined Draco in the shower, both of them scrubbing away at the slime which revealed tender pink skin as it sluiced away. Harry found two more burns he hadn’t even known he had, one on the back of his thigh and another on his hip where the slime had (seriously – how?) gotten beneath his t-shirt.
is crediting Draco with Harry’s sudden ability to dress fashionably.’
Draco was well aware he’d been left cuffed and seated on the freezing ground out of spite. He’d been left on the sidelines to remind him that he wasn’t an auror or a real member of the Ministry and the cold seeping into his arse was to serve as cruel reminder of his place in the world.
Hermione saw Malfoy roll his eyes before another male voice from somewhere deeper in the house shouted back, ‘So are you, Scorp!’
(See the end of the chapter for
Of course, there was every chance it hadn’t been quietly waiting for someone or something to trigger it. But Draco was not about to think about that possibility just now. Much better to assume it was left over from the battle and the Death Eater occupation and then build up to other more worrying possibilities.
In this case, though, first in the line of fire meant deliberately triggering whatever curse or spell had taken out Marigold before even stepping across the boundary. Harry did the honours, transfiguring a rock he’d picked up into a dog as Draco had once seen Cedric Diggory do, and sent the animated (though non-sentient) rock through the boundary to trample across whatever trigger there might be.
Draco let out a long steady breath and felt his heart slow to a normal steady beat. He had nothing to worry about. They’d talked about this before making the decision together that Harry would come back. Draco didn’t have a choice, but Harry could have gone straight into the Auror corps, he was already receiving so much of the training and had proved multiple times that he knew a lot of the material they had to teach him. In the end, though, Harry had wanted to prove that he had earned the position just like any other Auror and that meant completing his NEWTs.
‘You want to have breakfast in the Great Hall.’
‘Ron’s right,’ Hermione added. ‘This isn’t like you.’
Harry did as instructed but Draco still gave him a couple of extra seconds to focus. Harry may have received more training in occlumency when he started with the aurors, but he was still terrible at it. Draco didn’t know if it was something about having a piece of Voldemort lodged so firmly inside him or just the way Harry’s brain and magic worked but occlumency was a branch of magic Harry was never going to excel at. He had enough power and will to put behind the magic but none of the finer control needed to properly sink into himself and build up shields. The same skill was needed to locate the ties between them. Draco could find it now, easily sink into the depths of them and find the soft flow, but Harry would need more time.
Just because he could, he placed a kiss on the bare skin of Draco’s neck, just beneath his ear, and then moved so his chin rested on Draco’s shoulder, the soft wool of Draco’s scarf scratching at his cheek. He smiled briefly at the wizard behind the stall who was waving his own hands about just as enthusiastically, apparently delighted to have found someone intelligent to converse with.
‘You have tea with Narcissa Malfoy?’ Ginny didn’t seem to know whether to laugh, the concept just so absurd.
There were a couple of startled gasps and more than a few quiet sniggers at Harry’s retort. Most of the students in this classroom had fought in some way in the war. Draco was certain every one of them knew more about duelling than Joseph realised. It was a safe bet that most of the students in seventh and eighth year had been personally involved in duels with Death Eaters. Sitting around discussing duels was almost certainly a waste of their time.
Draco must read something in his expression because he sets aside the file and stands up. ‘Alright, I’m coming through.’
And he was definitely barking up the wrong tree with that one.
He caught sight of Luna then and couldn’t help grinning. She was frowning at the both of them as though trying to puzzle something out. If Pansy had been there, she’d have been fanning herself and making lewd comments. Luna probably hadn’t even noticed. It made him love her more. And so, when she stood up, he took the robe she held out to him and tugged it on over his jeans and t-shirt and placed a kiss on her cheek.
But she took him to be muggle – or at the very least muggle-born – because wizarding fashion had come a long way but there were still noticeable tells. She and Rose arrived by the train just as he was releasing two of the three children with him toward the train. Hermione only caught the back of a black head of messy hair and long red tresses as the two kids hopped up onto the train without a backward glance. She thought she heard the man mumble something about ungrateful children and homesickness, but Rose distracted her with another nervous question.
‘I had this dream about what the future would look like, me and Ginny married, with three kids and it looked like the perfect life, just what everyone expected, but there were we on the platform saying goodbye to our kids and it was awful because I don’t know if I was dreaming about me and Ginny or my parents and what could have been because one minute I was me and then I was my dad and Ginny was Mum and,’ Harry broke off with a shudder and Draco tried very hard not to snigger.
For some inexplicable reason, her words made Harry blush. ‘Er, thanks.’
But he was an adult and a professional and while he might have complained if it were just Draco and Bill, there were a lot of people standing around in the field whom Harry wanted to give the impression that he was capable and strong and not just some kid who’d got by in the war because he’d been lucky that one time and managed to kill Voldemort with his own rebounding curse.
A shiver went down Harry’s spine and he said to Charlie, ‘They’ve got one down,’ though he needn’t have bothered because as the ward came down the farmhouse became visible and so did the bloody great dragon chained beside it.
‘I’m not sure,’ Draco answered. He held out his hand for Harry and then realised they were both wearing gloves and that was going to be a problem.
For a moment, months ago, when she’d been stood up before them to address the plans to clear the castle, Draco had thought she looked tired. He’d thought she’d looked wary and done in with all the fallout from the war, but now she seemed tiny, seated behind her desk. She looked, for the first time Draco could remember, old. Which was ridiculous because she’d not even had time to embrace her sixties yet and had no reason to look twenty years older.
Draco, who had seen the Weasel eat, could believe it. ‘I’m not even dressed,’ he protested – half-heartedly as he’d already starting to scramble out of bed. He was always up for an excuse to get some nice food away from the Manor. ‘Give me ten minutes.’
The vine that snapped from within the body of the woman from the Beast division that promptly tried to eat the junior auror’s face was just a nice reiteration of Draco’s point. With no stupid junior auror to snack on, the vine slipped back inside Marigold’s body with just as much speed as it had burst forth. With a disgusted look (for the auror), Draco shoved the man back behind him and hoped that Mendenhall would deal with him and not let him anywhere near the front of their line.
Groener’s house might still have been preferable to this.
George, later that night, had cackled, ‘Well, we had been wondering – you do love those dragons an awful lot, brother.’
It probably would have, Harry could see that. Draco had been very intent on paying back what he’d seen as Harry snubbing him, but if Harry hadn’t followed Ron’s lead would Draco have felt the need to continue on for so long? If Draco hadn’t seen someone he thought so unworthy of Harry Potter’s friendship taking what should have been his place, would he have carried on the way he had?
Hermione very clearly wanted to ask what he meant by that, but she changed her mind and instead nodded. Ron seemed relieved, like he didn’t know how to deal with Harry in this situation. Harry couldn’t help wondering if it was the lingering dislike he harboured for Draco or if it was watching Harry care so much about someone who wasn’t him or Hermione. It didn’t matter, not really, Harry was just in a dark mood and he was looking too deeply into things and creating feelings that weren’t there.
Their magic, while not as firmly entwined as their souls, worked so perfectly together that it had been easy for Bill and Fleur to see why Draco had assumed that it was just as tightly woven. Their magic sought each other’s out, taking strength from what they found, flowing back and forth between them to such an extent that Fleur had wondered whether the magical flow between them would eventually bond as firmly as their souls and whether that would have them picking up magical talents from each another.
He wondered how telling it was that Portrait Dumbledore did little more than frown at the entire exchange. Only saying, ‘Perhaps I should leave until you’re done with this meeting, Minerva.’
With a soft chuckle, Harry traced kisses across one side of Draco’s face, tracing the arch of one defined cheekbone before he switched to tracing across the other one. ‘Better?’ he murmured.
This time, she nodded and left without trying again or asking any of the million questions she so clearly wanted to ask. Ginny went with them, pausing at the door to wait while Luna slipped off the bed and pulled her shoes back on. She brushed Draco’s hair off his face, placed a soft kiss to his cheek and gave Harry one final smile before she went after Ginny.
Draco had his doubts about the junior auror – he no longer felt bad for not learning his name. If he kept making such basic mistakes he wasn’t going to survive out in the field.
Something of that must have shown because Harry crossed the room in quick strides and sank to his knees between Draco’s own, practically shoving Hermione out of the way. Harry placed both hands on Draco’s thighs, warm and strong and a sharp reminder that he was there as he gazed up at Draco with a tender smile.
And the truly epic howler from Pansy.
The Draco who had fought in and survived a war hated it, hated how hard it would make it for him to just live his life. Hated how far this pushed him from changing people’s perceptions and gaining acceptance. The Draco he was now hated how hard it would make things for Harry who was determinedly sticking by his side. If people feared him now, if they saw what he was capable of and it terrified them, then what chance was there that Harry’s easy acceptance of him would go unremarked.
He remembered an arrogant boy in a robe shop and a broken boy in his childhood home taken over by Death Eaters, and he had moved without thought, simply because Draco wasn’t nice and he wasn’t good but he was someone Harry knew, someone Harry had mocked and teased as he held his own and (alright, yes) stalked for most of a year. For all that he hated what the git stood for, Draco had been an enormous part of Harry’s life and there had been nothing, no thought or action that could have stopped him charging into that cell to press fingers to the side of his neck to check for a pulse.
‘Is your hand alright?’ she asked, her voice devoid of emotion.
Harry doesn’t exactly want to comply, but he can’t see how not to. He stands slowly, walks at a snail’s pace across the room to the floo and can’t help but glance back over his shoulder at her before her glare has him tossing the powder in, calling out Draco’s address and sticking his head in the flames.
‘A primary school for magical children.’
Hermione was a little broken, but he could see the edges of her old self pulling back together. He could see her putting the war behind her as she slowly built herself back into the woman she’d been on her way to becoming before the war broke out. Just like Ron, she was older and wiser, somewhat more comfortable in her skin.
At the time, it had worked to his advantage, even with his father put away in Azkaban, he’d still believed the Dark Lord was right and the loss of such a strong member of the Order had been good for Voldemort and his followers. The feeling hadn’t lasted long of course, it had been mere weeks before Draco’s whole world came crashing down around him but for those few short weeks, he’d shared the horrible belief that Sirius’ death was a fortunate outcome of the debacle at the Ministry.
As though his thoughts had triggered them, there was a loud bang and Ginny lurched backward while Hermione lifted the book in front of her face to protect her.
He had to stifle a yelp of pain as, when he took a small step, the bones in his legs ground together. If he didn’t have other students to worry about, he might very well have collapsed back onto the debris and passed out while he waited for rescue. A couple of years ago, he’d likely have done that anyway. He was honest enough to know that about himself. He’d been an absolute twat as a kid. At least the war and its repercussions had been good for something.
‘I remember you forgetting to tell me you wanted me to live with you,’ Harry teased.
Huh. He felt that was something worth mentioning to Draco. He probably could have bought it up right there with Hermione and distracted her from being mad at Ron, but he was enjoying not having to think overly hard about anything and an in-depth conversation about what had turned him so against studying wasn’t anything close to fun. Also, it possibly had something to do with Ron?
‘Floo him.’
Harry glared but didn’t speak because Robards held up a hand stopping him before he could say something he’d likely regret later. Maybe. Probably not.
Alone in corridors was apparently the perfect spot to target him.
She wasn’t the kind of person to just let that misunderstanding, the missed observations, go.
‘Right,’ Malfoy said, sliding back into the booth, ‘what did I miss?’
‘You and Potter?’
‘I don’t understand how you weren’t even aware of it,’ Hermione muttered after Ginny took pity on her and offered up her napkin and Draco handed over his too which Hermione quickly transfigured into something a bit more workable.
Not that Hermione or Astoria needed to know any of that. It was bad enough he’d told Harry some of the stories, bad enough that Harry had witnessed some of them through his connection with Voldemort. Bad enough Draco had to remember some of those moments and couldn’t just have a Ministry Obliviator erase them.
It was honestly a wonder Granger had refrained from quenching her curiosity. Weasley seemed to be flabbergasted and unable to close his mouth, and yet neither of them had been able to voice the question. Neither of them had been able to ask him about the tattoo which could only possibly be about one person. He supposed being stabbed and shredded had its value.
So no, Draco might have thought about it, but he would never turn his back on magic and this life he was creating from the ruins of his old just because he’d done some stupid things in the past. He had way too much to live for to let Voldemort win one more time.
Sandwiched between Harry and a kneazle who took up far more space than seemed possible given her size, Draco felt content. His words to Harry were soft, not judging when he asked, ‘Is it easier to understand his behaviour because you were expecting it? We knew he’d walk, not that he’d be a homophobic prick.’
The sudden shift in his thoughts puts things a little better in perspective and he realises that, yeah, he’s being an arsehole, but he needs to say this and he needs her to understand that just because there’s a baby between them doesn’t mean that their problems are fixed.
‘I don’t suppose you have any sort of itemised contents?’ Draco asked, somewhat hopefully.
In between sobs, huddled on Hannah’s borrowed bed, he’d gotten the whole story out. How Harry had gone to tell Weasley the truth about their relationship in full, with the details he’d walked out without hearing, the ones that would hopefully have given him a chance to understand this wasn’t something they’d gone into lightly or a ploy by Draco. He’d pulled the details out of Harry bit by bit about Weasley’s words and his shameful actions.
‘He tried to say something to me yesterday after you left and all that happened,’ Hermione added quietly. She looked sad but firm, as though breaking up with Weasley had to be done and she wasn’t about to let herself feel guilty for doing it.
It was about losing everything she thought she knew all at once and being terrified of what it meant, in a post-war world, that Harry Potter could love Draco Malfoy.
He spun, snarl of rage on his face, wand ready to curse Draco for daring to slay something that belonged to him and faltered. Because Draco had a teasing smile on his lips and the Sword of Gryffindor in hand.
And a deep grief too, that he didn’t understand.
‘If so many people know, why didn’t you ever say anything to me or to Ron?’ There was hurt in her tone now and Draco wanted to roll his eyes at the constant back and forth of emotion she’d been displaying all morning.
Hermione looked at Draco blankly and turned to Harry who didn’t bother repeating everything Draco had said only adding, ‘We went to that winter fair in the village near the Manor.’ Harry told her, ‘I dragged him through a couple of muggle markets – he made me go to a Potions one in retaliation.’
‘I’m not.’
‘Yes,’ Harry agreed. ‘That was intentional.’
Fiendfyre surged around them but Harry didn’t look back, he couldn’t, he wouldn’t see what he was leaving behind even as screams filled his ears and he knew Malfoy would die. But he couldn’t look back, he wouldn’t. He –
Pomfrey, as predicted, didn’t look very happy with the news he’d put a student under emergency field stasis, but he also thought he detected a hint of approval. But that might have been the head wound talking. Or the blood loss. Or whatever the fuck he’d done this time that had him wanting to cough up more blood. He had to fight down another urge to cough, sure that doing so would only make this hurt more and he really needed Harry worrying about the cursed debris and not him.
Harry and Ron waited a moment after the door shut behind her before they burst out laughing.
As he approached the door, Draco cast a series of diagnostic charms Bill had taught him while Harry cast a few he’d been taught. There didn’t seem to be anything worrying about the house itself now that the initial wards had come down and so he simply walked in through the open door, Harry a step behind him. They both paused on a shudder inside and immediately whipped back around in alarm.
‘Sorry,’ she offered, not sounding sorry at all.
Draco smirked, Harry had been so terribly put out when he’d thought Draco was making plans for the future that didn’t involve him and then turned a delightful shade of pink when Draco called him an idiot for ever thinking he’d move anywhere without Harry. Honestly, Draco hadn’t realised Harry still had any insecurities when it came to their relationship and so he’d explained his idea offhandedly while Harry showered and he brushed his teeth. It was only when Harry got all quiet and stopped participating in the conversation that Draco had properly looked at him and worked out what the problem was.
Weasley gaped after her as the rest of the Hall turned away, disappointed by the lack of a fight. Granger also looked at McGonagall’s retreating form, but it was once again with a deeply thoughtful look. He had the uncomfortable feeling that look was going to cause him trouble.
Granger’s watery eyes darted from Harry to Draco and Draco could see it in the way she took a deep breath, as though his presence there made it necessary for her to suck in all her emotion and bury any weakness. He wanted to roll his eyes. It was a bit late for that. She could hardly pretend he hadn’t seen her breaking down. Much the way he wasn’t about to pretend she hadn’t just watched him being horribly sappy with Harry.
Of course, letting Harry field that question left him room to offer advice about other things and Draco didn’t know whether to be amused or not that Harry’s most helpful piece of advice was to simply be himself because she obviously liked that person and that made for a great start.
The footsteps belonged to Longbottom.
‘Spit it out,’ Draco snapped.
‘I’m very loveable,’ Draco replied.
‘Uh, thank you?’ He refused to let the compliment thaw him even more than he’d let the open acceptance of his relationship with Draco thaw it. He had perfectly legitimate reasons to be annoyed, damn it.
Reading his alarm, Harry squeezed his foot gently, drawing his attention. ‘They took Harriet to St Mungo’s last night,’ he explained. ‘She’s going to be fine. It was Archie’s foot you could see and Madam Pomfrey mended that easily. We found Xia Mei in the broom closet across from the muggle studies classroom. She hit her head when she fell – got knocked out – but she was fine. She didn’t even have to spend the night here. The others got thrown clear – knocked about a bit but they’re fine.’
Draco considered the question. He’d never tried to pin down an exact moment before. As strange as it might seem, Harry had been so present for so many of the important moments in Draco’s life that he hadn’t had to sit down and really hammer out an exact moment. He certainly hadn’t done so with his mind healer; she’d been much more interested in helping him through the trauma of Azkaban before diving too deep into his formative years. Really, his sessions with her had been a bit hit and miss, he didn’t think he’d gotten as much out of his sessions as Harry had.
He could tell them more; he could ask them if they understood why Harry never asked questions about his family. He could ask them if they’d never wondered why he didn’t correspond with Lupin during fourth year (or fifth or sixth) or why he’d never spoken up about the abuse he suffered – survived – at the Dursleys. He could point out Harry’s inability to recognise his own self-worth in his sacrificial tendencies and the absolute ridiculousness that was Dumbledore
Malfoy laughed. ‘Oh, this is going to be so much fun. Astara, my love, why don’t we take Hermione Granger home for tea, you think your dad would like that?’
Harry took the bark without pausing in his conversation with Granger and Weasley and began to dutifully shred it. Draco felt his lips twitch into a smile. If he’d turned around then, he might have noticed the weird look Granger was shooting him. Draco was focused on his potion though, and it was easier to follow the instructions (making his own small changes along the way just as Severus had taught him), handing Harry things to shred or dice, than it was to deal with Granger and her Weasley on a high from seeing their best friend for the first time in four months.
Kreacher nodded, glared at Hermione when he thought Draco wasn’t looking (Draco didn’t actually care whether or not Kreacher showed Hermione respect as she in turn did not respect Kreacher as far as Kreacher was concerned) and disappeared again.
‘Potter nearly killed you in sixth year,’ Pansy murmured, words hesitant. The exact details of what went down in that bathroom had stayed between he and Harry – and perhaps Snape – but that didn’t mean it hadn’t been all over Slytherin that something had happened. It didn’t mean a lot of people didn’t know something serious had happened between Draco and Harry and that Draco had nearly died.
But Harry wasn’t ready to have that conversation with Ron, he didn’t seem to be ready to have any of the important conversations with Ron. Something Hermione was well-aware of because when Ron excused himself to the bathroom half a paragraph of his potions essay later, she practically pounced on Harry, sliding from her bed to sit with him on the floor and hissing, ‘You need to tell him!’
That was an element of curse breaking Draco truly enjoyed. In the Manor he’d had access to some truly old and Dark books (protected from the curse breakers and grabby Ministry hands by familial wards) and in those books there had been plenty of spells, curses and blood rites that Bill had never even heard of. Those books Draco had safely tucked away in Harry’s Gringotts vault. One day, he’d have a proper warded study of his own where he could keep those books and learn all there was to learn from them.
She wanted to help build an inclusive and (most importantly) functional wizarding society so that what happened with Voldemort never happened again.
Luna filled breakfast with soft chatter and Draco let her voice wash over him. He had no idea what she was saying but he didn’t think she minded. In fact, he knew she appreciated the chance to just voice her thoughts and ideas aloud sometimes, she didn’t always need him to be paying attention. If she wanted more from him, she’d tell him so. Luna was blissfully straightforward in that respect. Talking to her, he’d learned over the last few months, could be as soothing as it was confounding.
Of course, it was his father, he should have known the encounter wouldn’t go as either of them expected.
‘A friend?’ Hermione asked.
If it weren’t for Luna, this first week back at Hogwarts (and the last month of the summer holidays) would have been horrifyingly lonely. He’d told her so, tried (in his own way) to express how much it meant to him that she’d been there for him, that they’d both been there for him, through his trial and his imprisonment and even during the final weeks of his punishment when he’d been trapped in the house with his mother.
The class was probably larger than any previous NEWTs class had been but remained small enough with the limited number of students returning to feel somewhat intimate. Still, everyone who came in cast surprised and suspicious looks at Draco seated beside Harry. Girl Weasley shot him a look of aggravation when she realised she wouldn’t be sitting beside Harry and dropped into a chair beside one of her friends instead. Draco remained unaffected by her look.
And Harry is forced to realise that perhaps Ginny is angrier than he’s realised, if that is even possible.
‘That time she came with me to visit you in Azkaban.’
Hermione and Ron
They were in what seemed to be an open square, the muggle version of fairy lights were hanging around the area lighting up Christmas decorations and what looked like market stalls. The smell of warm fresh food was in the air accompanied by the crisp smell of fresh cut trees and Christmas. At one end of the square a small stage had been set up, instruments now lying abandoned as their players fled into the swarming crowd. Screams and terrified cries formed the backdrop now.
There’d been a fiendfyre dragon on his leg too but that didn’t mean nearly as much as the
‘I don’t have the key,’ the junior auror explained in a nervous titter.
He could still remember the screams, the pleas and the sound of his spell hitting Goren in the back of the head. Draco could still remember the horrifying sound as the body slumped over. He frequently remembered (in his nightmares) the picture of that hulking figure tossing Luna to the cold flagstones. The way he’d tossed his head back and laughed as his clawed fingers tore at her clothes, the way his muscled thighs pinned her legs to the floor. Draco remembered the sound of Luna’s terrified breaths as she pushed and shoved the body from on top of her. He could remember her cries of relief when his spell hit its mark and the threat was gone.
Harry tilted his head and smiled softly at him, the gentle tug of movement something Draco could sort of make out only because they were so close. ‘I know. Because that’s his problem and not mine.’
Hermione’s mouth dropped open, likely to offer up a false platitude, but she couldn’t seem to think of anything to say and Ginny ended up responding. ‘Plus, you’re a bloke,’ she said grimly. ‘I never even thought that would be a problem. I thought for sure it would be just that you used to be a Death Eater and you’ve done some horrible things. I think if it were just about you – no offense – we’d all be willing to wait him out but the things he’s been saying about Harry…’
Harry reached to untie the knot, but he was too late, he had only enough time to shoot Draco a betrayed, ‘You bastard,’ before the tugging behind his navel tore him away from Hogwarts and straight to the atrium at the Ministry.
He only started to feel nervous when he took his usual seat in Potions, all the other students filing in – including Granger and Weasley – and there was still no sign of Harry. All sorts of thoughts were spinning wildly through his mind. What if when Harry returned to classes things between them changed? What if he didn’t want anyone to know they were (more than) friends? What if he heard all the horrible (and sometimes truthful) things people were saying about him and decided Draco wasn’t worth it?
‘I imagine so.’ Draco considered it, thought about the culture class that had been stopped when Grindelwald was vying for power and then he thought about all the other things he wanted to learn. ‘Hannah would have liked a pre-Healer program.’
But Draco wasn’t warm, and his skin was icy to the touch and no matter how hard Harry tried, he couldn’t wake him. He would never wake again. The stupid, too skinny, bony git who always had a snarky word and smug smile, the boy who was becoming a man that Harry loved above all others, but he’d never even gotten the chance to tell him, and now he was gone, and all Harry could do was wrap his arms around Draco and hold him close while he waited for the guard to come and take Draco away where Harry would never see him again.
Astoria gave him a frustrated look and her fingers sharply signed out an answer. Her frustration was bleeding through her signs, in the way she jerked her hands and fingers rather than the smooth fluidity she normally demonstrated.
Hermione waved off his concerns. ‘It’s fine. I got some.’
Draco could only laugh, Pansy’s tone was so resigned, so enraged by her younger self. It was strange, talking about his past with someone other than Harry or his mind healer. He’d begun to understand just how lonely his childhood was in some of those first sessions with the healer but listening to Pansy’s take on their childhood, it truly hit home how isolated he’d been.
‘I think, after the war, we needed each other, and we let that need turn into something it was never supposed to be.’
He hoped he wasn’t too late. He hoped she was one more person who would forgive him the sins of the past. Even if he didn’t deserve it.
When Draco looked at him on those first few visits, all he’d seen was that annoying git who always beat him at quidditch, who’d traded insults with him. He’d seen the boy who loved treacle tart, who excelled at Defence but was pants at Potions. He hadn’t seen the Saviour of the Wizarding World because he’d (more than) once seen Harry make a complete tit of himself, tripping over his feet to impress a girl or blowing up a cauldron with his complete lack of finesse with powdered ram’s horn.
Ron finally turned to look at him. ‘Every time I think we’re ready I start thinking “what if this changes things?” I can’t help worrying that this is something we can’t undo.’
I would love to hear thoughts on Draco and Harry's bond and Ron and Draco's exchange. In my mind while I was writing this I felt like Ron was fresh from witnessing Draco do something extraordinary again and it was warring with his hatred of the git. Also writing concussed/drugged Draco was fun.
He didn’t understand McGonagall’s fierce protection of him or Madam Pomfrey’s tireless work to help him heal when no other healer would give him the time of day. He didn’t understand Bill’s acceptance or Fleur’s compassion and he certainly didn’t understand how George could take humour and a strange comfort out of his love for Harry or Percy’s sharp and decisive words that had helped bring about his fair trial.
‘Where are we going, anyway?’ Ron thought to ask as he was checking one last time he’d gotten his wand and enough money to cover dinner.
When he woke up the next morning, he had other things to worry about and didn’t give Harry’s (or was it his?) potential marriage proposal much thought. They did have a tendency to discuss marriage in the quiet hours but neither of them was ready to make a thing of it. Their magic might have had its own ideas, but they were eighteen and there were a lot of things they wanted to do and think about before they bothered with all the dramatics of Harry Potter, Boy Who Lived, marrying Draco Malfoy, ex-Death Eater.
He opened his eyes and looked at Harry thoughtfully. ‘Is it alarming that I feel certain we’re always using each other’s magic?’
‘Can you just go?’ he asked tiredly, without managing the energy to look at any other them.
Eventually, when the tension had begun to rise and Draco felt like it might suffocate him if he didn’t say something, Pansy broke the silence. ‘I don’t want to talk about seventh year.’
‘A day school,’ Draco repeated, blankly and then comprehension dawned and he breathed a shocked, ‘
Draco did nothing to hide the snide twist of his lips at that. ‘I assure you, Professor, I take my studies very seriously.’
Draco nodded. It wasn’t something he’d ever had to think about growing up, but now, knowing Harry as well as he did – getting to know Hermione – he was beginning to see that there were some aspects of growing up a good little pureblood heir that had shaped the way he viewed the world. And that were things he didn’t have to be ashamed of, ones that he could be sad that Harry (and Hermione) hadn’t experienced.
‘I know you don’t like the tasks he’s being given. I don’t care. If you can’t set your feelings for Malfoy aside then you won’t make it as an auror. And Potter, you make a damn fine auror.’
It was Hermione’s turn to be taken aback. ‘Really?’ she asked, eyebrows shooting up as she glanced between the two of them.
He stood there as if he hadn’t stood by and watched as she was tortured by his aunt.
And he had written it that way, he’d called Harry their son, because that was what he had become.
Finding the portrait of Fleamont Potter had been so much more than Draco expected. Damaged and lifeless, he’d found the portrait fallen behind a desk in what he thought must have been James Potter’s study. It had been pure chance he found it, he’d knocked a book off the desktop and when he’d bent to fetch it, sneezing at the amount of dust he’d dislodged, his hand had brushed, not against the book, but a painting. He’d known the moment he’d pulled it free that it was exactly what he would give Harry, even if he couldn’t restore it, it would have made a perfect addition to the already full box of family history he’d compiled.
Harry frowned, not bothering to question why he was only just now hearing about this and why it was Draco knew and he didn’t when Hermione had been avoiding them both. ‘Why does she feel guilty for talking to Ron?’
Winthrop nodded. It had become standard practice in the aftermath of the war to check any potential Death Eater properties for an ever-increasing number of Dark wards. Some of them could only be crossed or dismantled by someone bearing the Dark Mark. Some of the places the Ministry had been turning up lately were left over from the first war against Voldemort.
He sighed tiredly. ‘You’ve been gone nearly twenty years, Granger. We’ve all changed. I promise you’ll be perfectly safe, for what it’s worth.’
‘What does that mean?’
‘You wouldn’t have,’ Draco told him truthfully but without the self-recrimination. ‘I wasn’t ready for the truths you’d have offered me.’
‘I’d have given you a reason back then.’
They made it look good and just like last time, Hermione hit him with a hex that warped and twisted his features. Just like last time, they were taken to Malfoy Manor. There was confusion and debate and Draco was brought out.
He lurched upright, gripping tightly to Luna when the motion made the world spin and Granger gasp.
He had to cast a lightening charm before he could ease the large chunk of floor off his legs. Thankfully, it seemed to have been balancing over his leg rather than squishing it into a paste. He was very lucky it had fallen wedged against another piece of floor and not directly on his leg. Wedged as it was it had still torn his leg up enough to have him wincing and glancing away.
Draco waved a hand dismissively. ‘Never mind that,’ he said. ‘Did you know Weasley has never taken Hermione on a date?’
‘I came to see if you’re ready for breakfast,’ Luna informed them as she turned her back on them and went back into the bedroom. They both followed her out of the bathroom and she draped herself across the bed, gaze firmly locked on the ceiling to give them an illusion of privacy while they dressed.
He hadn’t been able to deny Harry’s words any longer, especially not when his mother weighed in with her own thoughts on the matter. His father needed to hear about his relationship with Harry from him and not from some guard or auror visiting Azkaban who thought to torment him with the knowledge that his son was in a relationship with Harry Potter. Draco hadn’t been able to deny that if he wasn’t the one to tell his father then the rumours that might reach him first could turn into something much worse than learning that his only son and heir was desperately in love with Harry Potter.
Ron and every time Harry tried to find the right moment or the right words, something came up. It was a source of frustration for Harry but also relief, because as long as he didn’t have the conversation with Ron, he could tell himself that everything would be okay and that nothing had to change just because Ron knew Harry was dating Draco fucking Malfoy.
There wouldn’t be any more sleep for Draco that night.
He was older now, and he’d like to think wiser, and he could see now how much power and influence Ron had over him. It wasn’t something Ron had ever abused, probably wasn’t even something he’d even been aware of having, but Ron shaped Harry in ways that Harry no longer viewed necessarily as positive and it was only now, with the love and support of the family he’d created for himself, that he even saw it.
‘We’d have cheated on them both and it would have made the papers and been a horrible scandal and we’d have had to run away to some distant little village in Wales just to be together.’
‘You’re very warm,’ Luna murmured against his chest. She showed zero signs of protesting his manhandling, in fact she easily placed her arms around his neck to help him.
They continued up the stairs in silence, Draco not realising it was a thoughtful one until Harry spoke. ‘I know you joke about it – about my isolation – but I don’t think I ever realised how cut off I was from the rest of the school.’
Harry had never liked Draco Malfoy, never liked the attitude or the way he bullied Neville and called Hermione names. He was a selfish arrogant prat, but he’d saved Harry’s life once before, maybe even twice, and Harry had saved him. Sometimes in his dreams he smelled the smoke of the fiendfyre, felt the terrified squeeze of arms bound around him and the quick fearful breaths as Draco whimpered and pleaded with Harry to get them out.
Harry nodded and, with gentle prodding, managed to steer Granger in the direction of the dungeon kitchens. Draco led the way, trying his best to ignore the sniffles and choked back sobs Granger was still making. He paused briefly to tickle the pear before he held the painting open for Harry to steer a strangely docile and compliant Granger inside. He’d seen Granger upset before, but he’d never seen her docile. He took that to mean whatever had her so upset was worse than normal.
‘Oh, that’s just the Lestrange money,’ Draco explained carelessly. ‘Harry and I have plenty of money, but I wasn’t actually talking about us. I have very rich friends who need a bit of good publicity.’ He thought about it. ‘And one who married an old Swedish prince who could do with a project.’
Draco didn’t see how that would fix anything. And so, they were grumpy, and sleep deprived together, and showing up on Pansy’s doorstep to be grumpy and sleep deprived at her had seemed like a better solution than putting Draco’s mother through it for another day and actually what Draco had declared he would really like to do was kill Ron but that would only result in a nice new cell in Azkaban and some truly horrible conjugal visits – no thank you.
This was the first time he was really going to have to sit down and come out to someone without them first knowing – or at the very least having an inkling. He wasn’t really counting coming out to Molly and Arthur because he hadn’t thought about it beforehand, hadn’t worried about how the conversation would go and what they’d think because he – in typical Harry fashion – hadn’t been thinking, he’d just blurted it out.
Harry was sweaty, annoyed and usually a little on the daft side when it came to this sort of thing. He wasn’t like Draco who’d been raised to manipulate the people at the Ministry from a young age by his father or Hermione who was clever enough to read between the lines of the political two-step, but it finally clicked what Robards was saying.
Somehow, he doubted he’d be so lucky.
‘Right,’ Draco agreed, ‘and I know Flitwick and Sprout did the same, but can you tell me what qualifies Hagrid for his position? Or Trelawney? What about Snape? What qualified him for the position of Potions Master when he hated children and teaching – and has a criminal record.’
‘Yes, but that was the people,’ Draco pointed out. ‘Anyway, my whole point was that I thought we could use all that Lestrange money to build a primary school for children. Mother’s got it in her head now and I think once her house arrest is over, she’s going to start campaigning for education reforms. There needs to be a standard for all magical education and that has to include all the things we don’t learn because they’re considered too muggle and all those pureblood traditions that are being erased by people like Dumbledore who removed them from the curriculum.’
Merry Christmas! Hope you all have a wonderful day and that this chapter that is pure Draco and Pansy will serve as a nice bonus gift for the day.
‘You’ve changed,’ Pansy softly repeated his earlier words. She took a steadying gulp of firewhiskey, the tumbler snapping down onto the table with a distinct rap when she was done.
Harry grimaced. ‘We’re not very nice to the people around us when we’re obsessing Draco.’
There was a brief moment where they both wondered if it was absolutely necessary to bring this ward down and if they couldn’t perhaps wait until spring, before they both hastily removed a single glove. Harry clasped Draco’s hand in his and shoved them both back into his pocket. They both turned to face the ward again as Bill wandered over to see what they were up to.
‘When did you see them duel?’ Ron asked, looking a bit confused by the sudden change in conversation and not having any idea, judging by the frown, what one had to do with the other, let alone a conversation Ginny had with Molly.
‘I always thought you and Ginny would end up together.’
With a grimace of distaste, he withdrew his wand and strode into the wards.
‘He makes me crazy,’ he’d said in a soft voice and he’d been aware as he was saying it just how terribly fond he sounded. ‘He argues with me just because he can and he always has to be right and sometimes he gets this look, like I’ve said something so stupid he can’t figure out how I manage to walk, but then he’ll say something sweet or curious about Sirius or Tonks and he’ll ask about Teddy and his mother or he’ll tell me some stupid story from when we were at school that I never even realised was happening and it’s like everything else just fades away and it’s just me and him and the stupid smirk he has and I want to do everything I can to get him to keep looking at me like that.’
‘Head auror, huh?’ Harry grinned, not seeming bothered by Ron hiding behind his desk because he dropped gracefully into one of the chairs opposite and kicked his feet up on Ron’s desk in a move so casual and well-practiced that Ron could imagine he’d done it a hundred time before – and somehow made him feel even more insecure.
It had once meant the world to Harry. Maybe, deep down, it still did.
‘Volunteer?’ Harry repeated, nonplussed.
She studied him quietly for a long moment, but he didn’t speak to answer her question, she seemed to be on the brink of saying more and he was happy to wait her out.
He heard movement behind him and spun around in alarm. The alarm didn’t fade (neither did the blinding, world spinning nausea) when he realised Ginny had flown her broom up to the window outside with Demelza. He did sort of sag in relief because the classroom itself wasn’t cursed and he just stood blinking stupidly at the two of them as they carefully manoeuvred the window open and Ginny shot inside on her broom. It seemed Demelza was holding an umbrella charm over the window so as not to let the rain in.
‘You lucky bastard,’ Harry laughed fondly, perhaps a tinge jealously.
They both watched the spell do its work. ‘Do you remember how many families were camped at the quidditch world cup?’ Draco found himself asking. ‘Suit of armour has a lust spell attached to it.’
‘What time is it?’ Harry asked, sitting up and rubbing at his gritty eyes.
Ginny shrugged, a little uncomfortably Draco rather thought. ‘He’s done it before, you know he has. He’s was a right arse when he turned up last Christmas. He’ll come around eventually; he always does. Probably only after we’ve all hexed him another two or three times – Mum’s already got a head start.’
thinking about it.’
Ginny threw a bread roll at his head.
He shoved him again when Ron made to push forward and then looked over his should at Harry, his expression more furious than Harry had ever seen it, even when he’d been slaying Nagini.
There was blood everywhere, swelling between Harry’s fingers as he tried desperately to stem its flow. There were tears flowing down his cheeks just as freely as the warm thick blood flowed, and his throat ached from screaming, his ears ringing from Myrtle’s ghostly shouts as they both begged for someone, anyone, to come and help because this wasn’t how it was supposed to be. It wasn’t supposed to end like this because the colour was fading from Draco’s cheeks and he was mouthing silent words and terrified gasps and he couldn’t get any air because there was so much blood and the curse had taken root deep in Draco’s chest cutting bone and muscle until there was nothing but ribbons of flesh that Harry tried desperately – futilely – to hold together as his heart broke into a million pieces because he didn’t want this, he’d never wanted this. He just wanted it to stop, for someone to believe him and understand but he’d never considered this, he’d never thought he’d be here with Draco in the bathroom, watching his life slip away after a stupid mistake and he just wanted him to open his eyes and smirk and tell him it was okay and he was forgiven.
Draco looked at Weasley for a moment and then to Granger, brow wrinkled in a frown that was only partly genuine consternation. ‘Aren’t you and Granger together?’
Not that they’d really done much in the way of hiding their relationship, Draco could not reiterate that enough.
His voice had been muffled by Molly’s shoulder, but Harry had managed to sound deeply annoyed when he admitted, ‘I know.’
Which actually gave him a pretty good place to start.
Harry smirked. ‘I kind of like it when you’re mean.’
‘Sit down, Ron, you’re making a scene.’
‘Then no,’ Draco admitted. ‘I was broken then Harry, I’d have needed all of you.’
Hermione giggled. ‘You’re welcome.’ She nudged him with her shoulder. ‘I honestly don’t know how I didn’t notice,’ she told him. ‘You touch him all the time. You two have no concept of personal space anymore.’
But he didn’t think Ron was looking to sit back and listen to Harry repeat Draco’s pointed rant about superior broom technology, reliable coaching techniques or fair play and certainly not the reminder that Draco had never lost a match to any of the other teams he’d gone up against in his time as Slytherin seeker.
Felicia nodded and scurried away.
But the mood was far from amorous and Draco knew the touch was a source of comfort for Harry who hadn’t had a loft of soft touches and the soft pleasure of warm contact growing up.
