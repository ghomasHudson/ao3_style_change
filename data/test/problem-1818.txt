As Harry swung his legs back over the back of the armchair, he scanned the upside-down common room, noticing a pair of grey eyes looking in his direction, once again.
Taking in deep breaths through his nose and breathing them out through his mouth, his eyes wandered around the room, inspecting every little detail he could find in the dark.
Yes, he loved his friends. Though he couldn't help but feel like sometimes he was being the third wheel ever since the two of them had gotten together. Not that he was complaining. After everything they had gone through, they all deserved some happiness in their lives. It just felt like sometimes he wasn't needed anymore; like he was a superfluous piece to the puzzle. Sometimes it felt like the Golden Trio had become the Golden Duo.
As he was once again lost in his own thoughts, he hadn't noticed Malfoy trying to get his attention. Only when he felt a gentle hand on his shoulder, did he manage to snap free, flinching away from the touch. "Hm, what?"
Harry gaped openly at the girl sitting next to him, absolutely flabbergasted about the fact that she had figured something out even
Draco shivered as he walked out the common room, already dreading the winter that was just around the corner. He preferred the long, hot days of summer. Days where he could sit outside underneath one of the tall trees in the garden of the Manor, reading books or sketching his surroundings, smelling the sweet air around him filled with the scent of blooming flowers.
Harry rolled his eyes, turning around in Draco’s embrace. “You love going on midnight walks with me.” He wiggled his eyebrows as he leaned closer. “It’s romantic.”
"Well then", Ginny said, "would you mind, Harry, if I stole Luna away for a while?" She looked at him, pleading, brown eyes staring back into his own green ones.
Finally - after what felt like an eternity - Harry managed to get his brain working again. He shook his head and raised an eyebrow at the blonde next to him. "I'm not so sure I know what you're talking about", he admitted quietly, scratching the back of his neck with a sheepish smile gracing his lips.
"No, no, dear", Rowena shook her head, a loose curl falling into her face. "Don't worry about it. They have to sort things out eventually. Their rivalry has been going on for far too long now. They're grown adults, for Merlin's sake."
Sighing loudly, Harry slowly emerged from the safety of his bed, steadying himself against it when another wave of pain washed agonisingly slowly over him. Even the tiniest movements of his head made it feel like it would explode.
Without saying a word, Luna took the cup away from Harry and placed it on the ground. "I think you might have had enough to drink, don't you think?", she said, giving him a meaningful look. "Is something bothering you, Harry?"
Harry snorted loudly. “Treat-or-tricking?”, he asked, amusement visible in his green eyes. “Don’t you mean ‘trick-or-treating’?”
As the little tawny owl realised it wasn't going to get any treats for the long journey it had made all the way from Scotland, it hooted exasperatedly and ruffled its feathers before flying away through the still open window, disappearing from sight once it had crossed the wards.
. He closed his eyes, not even wincing as a throbbing pain spread through his head from where he had hit it on his desk. His glasses dug painfully into his face, though he didn't care.
with catching and throwing a Quaffle to his teammates. He had ended up missing the ball more often than not, eventually even falling off his broom when a Bludger had hit him square in the chest.
as an answer. She had told him she didn't like it when people lied to her. She had somewhat demanded him - in her own kind of way - to tell her how he really felt. She had reassured him that he didn't need to pretend in front of her and eventually he had dropped his walls around the girl, opening up a little more every time they talked.
"I'm quite well actually", he replied, taking another bite from his forgotten, green apple. "How about you?"
– honestly how Draco’s eyes hadn’t gotten lost in his head, Harry didn’t know – Draco muttered something about his idiot boyfriend under his breath before saying, “To go treat-or-tricking of course! Honestly, did you really think you would still be wearing those damn irresistible, leather trousers if I hadn’t planned to do something else tonight?”
"Hm", Malfoy hummed, still not looking away from the parchment. His eyebrows were furrowed in concentration and his tongue poked out of his mouth in what Harry thought was a rather adorable way.
Draco took a step back and eyed his work, his eyes racking appreciatively over Harry’s body. He hummed his satisfaction. “It’s a shame we still have places to be this evening.” A predatory smirk appeared on his face.
The words echoed through Harry's head as he gazed into those silver eyes again. From this close Harry could clearly see the dark grey - almost black - specks closer to the pupil, turning Draco's eyes into a reverse night sky.
“Yes, okay, I get it”, Draco said, pointedly ignoring the pleased smirk that had crossed Harry’s face. “Though we really ought to go now if we don’t want to make it too late.” He stepped towards the fireplace, taking a handful of Floopowder. “Because of Teddy, of course.”
A hand placed itself rather harshly on his shoulder, causing Harry to turn his head, his glassy, green eyes looking startled.
Rolling his eyes, Harry walked towards the Slytherin, brushing past him as he exited their room. "Why are you so happy anyways?" he asked conversationally as they started their long descend down the winding stairs.
Shaking the thoughts away from his mind, Harry walked further into the room, closing the door behind him.
"Draco, dear, you have to at least finish the food on your plate", Pansy said, her dark, pencilled eyebrows raising towards her hairline. "You know I can't allow you to leave if you haven't eaten anything more than that."
Next to her, Mr Weasely sat, his hand rubbing soothing circles on her back as he whispered sweet nothings in her ear.
"Oh Harry!" she exclaimed, squeezing him tightly as if to prevent him from leaving them again. Her shoulders shook slightly as quiet sobs escaped her mouth. "You're back."
"I don't want to hear it", she simply said. "I know you're sorry - of course you are - but do you have
Groaning loudly, Harry let his head fall onto the hard wood of his desk, closing his eyes as yet another wave of exhaustion washed over him.
But Harry didn't have the chance to tell her it was okay, that he had forgiven them both for leaving him long ago and he never would because this... this was all just a dream, a mere figment of his imagination, an image his mind loved to torture him with.
Smiling softly, Luna tilted her head slightly, her blond curls bobbing around her head as she glanced over her shoulder. "Someone gave it to me", was her simple answer, though Harry knew exactly who the
stop gloating about his first win of the season. He even declared the Eighth Years will win the Quidditch Cup this year. Ha! As if they will stand a chance against Gryffindor!"
Pressing a hand against her mouth, Hermione marked the page where she had stopped reading and pushed Ron away gently, mouthing the word '
book he had found rather interesting whilst Pansy was trying to sleep, her head resting back on her boyfriend's shoulder. Draco opted for simply staring out the window at the passing fields and woods. Watching as the fields slowly changed into higher hills and even some mountains with low current creeks lazily meandering their way through.
George held up his hand, stopping Harry from whatever he was about to say. "Save it, Harry", he mumbled. "I don't want to hear it."
She rolled her eyes, smiling brightly. "You seem to be having fun", she commented when she saw the laughter still dancing in Harry's eyes.
know was that he truly enjoyed the blond's company. Perhaps a little too much even, seeing as Harry had caught himself thinking about Draco on multiple occasions, though he would rather die than admit it out loud.
The fuzzy feeling in Harry's chest he had been feeling lately returned, his lips twitching into a small, involuntary smile. "Are you sure it was Hermione's idea and not yours, though?" he asked. "Maybe you're just concerned about me? Maybe you actually
“Shhh, it's alright, you did really well,” Draco replied equally soft. He put his empty plate onto the bedside table then whispered. “Scoot forward.” Harry did as asked and Draco climbing in behind him. He then guided Harry back so that he was resting against Draco's chest. His wings were opened and spread out either side of them.
Draco paced restlessly through the Manor. There was an itchy bubbly coming from within him and he had been feeling like his skin was too tight. He had been avoiding the guest wing ever since the Dark Lord took residence in there as per his parents' instructions but something had changed. For the first month of summer he had no desire to head in that direction but a couple of nights ago that turned on its head. Draco couldn’t describe it, but it was like something was calling out to him. It wasn’t a scent or sound or anything that he could register with his five senses but still, he knew something was calling to him even if he couldn’t say how.
“I cast Finite Incantatem and other reversal spells on Mr Potter while he was unconscious,” Dumbledore said firmly.
“Pomfrey, can you please check your stores and write a list of what you need to stock up on, for I fear we will be in desperate need of them soon.”
Voldemort stepped up to him and reached out. Harry threw himself against the bonds but they held firm and all he had managed to do was reinjure himself. Closing his eyes bracing himself for unimaginable pain Harry prepared to join his parents. His eyes popped open again when he felt cool fingers touch his hand. He looked down to see Voldemort had circled his wrist with his fingers, thumb reaching all the way to the second knuckle. Shame burst through him at the proof of how scrawny he was. Voldemort let go and stepped back regarding him with introspection.
“It's an abstract strategy game that was invented in China over 2500 years ago. The aim is to surround more territory than your opponent.”
“No offence my Lord, but as you are not my newly discovered son you do not fit the requirements for the situation at hand.”
Author sticks out hands and franticly says. "Stop! don't jostle it. I'm not convince they are stuck on, I have a feeling they are just resting on the chapter and I don't want to knock them off!!!"
He made sure that Albus heard him muttering sourly about his weekends being taken away from him. But the truth of the matter was his weekends had somehow become the hi-light, the thing he looked forward to and rewards himself with after the annoying tiring frustrations that he had to deal with while he was at Hogwarts.
“Right, now that I can fucking think properly without my stupid cock getting in the way, Mind telling me what the Hell is going on?” Sirius said.
Harry grinned weakly. Ever since he had met him, Sirius had a potty mouth. It was something other adults had tried to get him to stop. But Sirius had told Harry he had enough on his plate to worry about. He would not add watching his language just for other people with delicate sensibilities.
“I shall take Harry back to the Dursley’s today,” Dumbledore informed the Order at the breakfast table. Harry froze, surely, he had heard that wrong.
“Do you think I should leave Snape alone? Not bother him? Cause I'm a reminder of what my mum did to him.”
Dudley grabbed Harry’s hair and pulled him over to where he was waiting. His pants were already dropped, and he had been stroking himself while he watched. He forced Harry onto him. They had only just gotten started when Vernon, who had come home early, burst through the door.
“Oh sweetheart,” Narcissa crooned. And even Draco rumbled in comfort. “Of course it would be alright. I always wanted more kids. You can pretend whenever for as long as you like.”
Severus slowly meandered through the heather. It has been weeks of him coming here every day to check on Harry. He kept the sight of Draco’s tent in the corner of his eye. Harry had loved it and moved in as soon as Severus finished setting it up and backing far enough away.
“Sleep Severus, take a couple of hours to recharge. You will be no good to Harry if you are exhausted.”
Narcissa strode pinched lipped over to Lucius and grabbing his shoulders she barked out a horse word in Enochian. Lucius wrist bands flashed for a second before returning to normal. She then gave him a quick kiss before walking away with a straight back holding her pose. Draco was not even close to as graceful. He scrambled to Harry, uttered the same word, lighting up his torc before pulling Harry into a tight hug. He then shot off after his mother.
Harry stared at Tom incredulously. There was no way Severus had wild hair like this. He couldn’t even picture it, it was so impossible.
Harry was touched that Sirius was asking, but the ridicules pose he was stuck in helped Harry answer with complete truthfulness and actual light-heartedness.
“Is that what happened, lad?” Moody asked suspiciously. Harry lent into Sirius and refused to answer.
Uneasily Harry stepped onto a chair then stood on the top of the kitchen table. He always hated being the centre of attention. The crushing weight of their gazes as he was scrutinised from every angle filled his body with uncomfortable pressure. Even after years of fame, he had not adjusted to the attention piled on him.
But Harry would not hang around he bolted for the door only to have Sirius snap out a locking charm. Harry tried to open the door anyway, then smashed his fist against it in frustration when he couldn’t.
“Don’t be tiresome Severus, you know as well as I that in an ideal world all the children would be safe and healthy. But we don’t live in an ideal world. We have to make the best with what we can. Come now, it’s your analytical mind I need. What’s better for the whole takes precedence over what’s best for the individual.”
“Sleep, my beloved. I will wake you when it is time to leave.” Tom whispered, putting some of his magic behind the suggestion. Severus slowly blinked once, then closed his eyes, falling into slumber. The exhaustion catching up to him now, he wasn’t moving and crashing over him, dragging him under.
“All the teachers were spread out to thin. Trying to wear too many hats at once, there was a lot that slipped through the gaps.” Severus said
“The board of Governors are there, and a contingent of Aurors. They politely asked the three of us to vacate the premises while they check to see if we had any hand in Albus treachery.” Pomona said.
They only had to wait a few moments before the attack on the front door begun. Lucius took up his favoured duelling stance. Harry was also standing in a duelling pose, but he was off to the side and hidden from view by a pillar. The door broke, splinters flying. Lucius starting casting before he had even seen anybody. His quick thinking paid off as the first man through the door was down and out for the count. As the rest headed for him Lucius quickly lost sight of Harry, but even with the different coloured spells flying and keeping himself moving Lucius could see the effects of having Harry there. Spells went awry as Harry attacked people from the side and back as they cast. And somehow Harry had gotten them funnelled so that only one person at a time could face him and fight.
“Yes, more!” Severus demanded, pulling Tom back to him. The second kiss started where the first left off. Never in his life had Severus being more in a position where he wanted to submit to someone completely. Yet the way Tom was drugging him with kisses, the slow exploration even with Severus body screaming hurry, hurry, more we need more, filled Severus with the desire to offer every inch of himself to Tom. Certain in the knowledge that all of it, even the ugly or unsure parts would be safe in Tom’s hands as he both protected and filled Severus with pleasure.
Harry didn’t want to sit through another day of this, he planned to use the skills Tom had been teaching him. He grabbed Draco by the hand, dragged him over to where Narcissa was sitting. Pushing Draco down, he got him to sit by her feet. He then plonked himself into Draco’s lap, who automatically wrapped his hands around Harry. Harry then lay his head on Narcissa knee. His actions had been so precise and quick that it had startled both the Malfoy’s and neither had their hackles raised yet.
Severus was about to depart back to the moors when Draco ran up to him. Severus out of kindness didn’t mention the red-rimmed eyes or blotchy patches on Draco's pale cheeks.
Harry watched as the huge green snake slithered up to Voldemort. She raised herself until he could wrap a hand around her in the next instant the two of them apparated away.
He knew the order was working for the Light and therefore were the good guys. But he had just been ripped violently away from both his mate and the first home where he felt safe and care for. So, he was clingier than he would normally be, especially around this crowd. He knew he should feel safe here, but he didn’t. Besides, from Sirius, there was not a single adult here that he would trust. They had not proven themselves to him, and as far as he could see that just treated him like a normal child, patting him on the head and not believing anything he said or they saw him as a hero figurine. Made to look good, but not good for much more than that.
He wrapped his hands around his torso trying to hold himself together. It felt like he was stuffed to breaking point with surging emotions but he had to hold them in. Lock them up tight. Dumbledore explained pretty clearly that he was to grow up and stop being such a baby about things. He was fourteen years old for fucks sake, why in the hell did he want someone to stay with him during the night. They were right, that was for little kids only. Sure, he had a bit of a rough day but you don’t see other boys asking for their parents to sit with them. His dormmates would tease the shit out of him for wanting it and they would be right to. What, was he some little cry baby wanting his mummy?
They had only just started when Lucius stiffened. A moment later Harry followed him. The two of them turned their heads to look toward the front gate.
Lucius gracefully sunk to his knees. She untied the ribbon that was keeping his hair in place, then fanned the golden white locks across her lap, the ends spilling over the edge. She pulled out a brush and starting at the end of his hair began to brush it gently, working out any tangles. Her wings elegantly unfolded and spread open, stretching up as high as they could go. Providing a spectacular background.
Severus hadn’t even paused for a moment before revealing something he had never told anyone before. That his maternal grandfather had been a Cughtagh. And while he had never met him, he had performed tiny healing songs before and had them work. Narcissa and the Dark Lord had stared at him in astonishment before Narcissa leapt onto the news. She said that she knew how to weave a healing web although she didn’t have the necessary equipment on hand. Voldemort had taken over then and had gotten a list of what was needed. He then summoned an elf and had sent it off to his personal catchment to raid it for what was required.
There was dead silence in the crowd as more and more charges were read, his famous reputation was slowly and thoroughly ripped to shreds. By the time Amelia stopped reading, the crowd was sitting shellshocked. Amelia efficiently stated his punishment.
The old man wasn’t looking so good. Life on the run, with your allies, all locked up, and the populace turned against you didn’t seem to agree with him. He was thin, skin sagging, all his hair was brittle and someone had hacked his bead off to just under his chin. His once blinding bright and garish clothes were dull, faded and worn.
“Twat, it’s my fucking house,” Sirius muttered to Harry as people picked themselves up and headed towards the kitchen. “A bloke shouldn’t fucking need permission to use Merlin dam magic like he was still a weak willy school kid. Wanker.”
“Right, well...” Severus floundered. He did not have a plan in place for this and had no idea what to do. “When you do have questions, you are welcome to come and ask me.” he tried he was at a loss what to do now. Personally, he would love to flee and go brew for a couple of hours but even his antisocial head knew that running away after dropping an emotional bombshell was not done. Casting his eye around he looked for inspiration. Nothing seemed to leap out at him so he fell back on his own childhood and one of the only bright points.
Tom bit down on Severus’ shoulder as he gave a last thrust as he emptied himself inside. The sensation of both Tom’s release and the bite was enough to tip Severus over into coming for the second time.
“None of that now. You are going to stay muzzled until I say otherwise.” pulling out the sash from his dressing gown Vernon tied his hands savagely tight. Once he was done, he pushed Harry who stumbled, overbalanced and unable to throw his hands out fell onto his chest. His head hitting the floor a second later narrowly missing the edge of his bed. He broke his nose and could feel the blood gushing out of it.
“I see,” Severus could tell this was something Harry wanted but was feeling unsure about. Severus prayed to Merlin that he didn’t say the wrong thing and take this joy away from him. He could see Draco watching him from the window seat and Sirius head was peering through the glass.
“Oh, thank fucking Merlin,” Sirius gave a tremendous sigh and collapsed on the bed. Harry braced himself, trying to quickly prepare for when Sirius asked him who it belonged to. He wouldn’t give up Draco’s name. Not because he didn’t trust Sirius, but because no one could betray a secret that they didn’t know. That was another useful thing he had learnt from Tom. But to his bewilderment, Sirius neither asked him any more question nor brought up the subject again. He wasn’t ignoring the whole thing, for whenever they were alone, he would give the torc a firm tap so Harry could feel the metal vibrate around his throat. The sensation filled him with comfort and reassurance that he was wanted and mated to Draco. Harry absolutely loved that feeling, but he couldn’t get the right angle and strength to produce it himself. Sirius just never spoke about it again.
Severus looked across at Harry. This was where he would ask questions and depending on which one he asked, Severus had two pages filled with answers. He prided himself on believing that he had covered nearly every question that could conceivably be asked. And had answers ready to go including ones that would make sure the burden of Lily’s crime didn’t fall on Harry’s shoulders.
Dumbledore was tried in absence as he was still currently in the wind. His charges were many, Tom working in the shadows made sure that everything that could be thrown at him was. The main ones were Kidnapping, multiple counts of child abuse, leading a child abuse ring. Multiple counts of supplying a minor to abusers. Gaslight and grooming a minor. Multiple account of ignoring abuse in his charges. Aiding in the torture that turned a magical into an Obscurial.
Severus grew concerned when he saw the Dark Lord frown over the results and perform the ritual again. Merlin, it would just be Potter’s luck that they would end up being the only people in the whole of Wizarding Britain who are not related at all. The boy just couldn’t catch a break.
Harry shot up, smashing his head on the underside of the bed. He collapsed back down and ripped the gag off as he rolled to his side and vomited. Nothing but bile came up, and it burned Harry's throat and mouth as it left him. He could feel that his pants were soaked, having pissed himself in fear. Still gagging and crying, Harry pulled himself out from under the bed. He stood up on weak wobbly legs and slowly stripped out of his clothes. The sun was just beginning to rise, so Harry had enough light to find new clothes to change into. He cleaned himself up the best he could with the soiled one, then hid them under his bed. He would pull them out and add them to the wash when Petunia made him do the laundry.
Grimacing, Draco shook his head. “You’re an absolute sap.” He ignored Harry’s lips curling into one of those far too smug smiles. “It’s disgusting.”
Why didn't it feel like it then? Why did it feel like his world was suddenly back to slowly falling apart?
Draco raised an eyebrow in question, concern flashing through his eyes before it disappeared again, hidden behind his mask of indifference.
With an elegant eyebrow raised, Malfoy turned his head to Harry from where he had been staring at his empty piece of parchment. He glared at the now laughing boy, though a faint blush coloured his pale cheeks. "Tell me Potter," he said, "why would I do something so Hufflepuff-like as
Harry’s frown deepened as he watched Draco run a shaking hand through his hair. This wasn’t about what he thought, right? Not after the lovely evening they had had so far? Harry had cooked them a delicious meal and Draco had brought home a fine French wine. They had had a comfortable candle-lit dinner, talking about their days, making plans for the weekend.
Words would do nothing. But Harry understood the wordless gesture without further question, though he was cautious in not overstepping. Harry settled next to Draco, ghosting his reliable arm over Draco's shoulder. "Hm?" he asked wordlessly.
He rarely cried. Maybe that's what robbed the blue from his eyes. Maybe they were like a lake empty of its sparkling crystal water. Maybe they just needed to be refilled. But he couldn't cry. He wasn't supposed to, he didn't think. He was never quite familiar with the concept. When he did cry-- typically from staring at the sun for too long or from a physical pain too unbearable to hold in the single tear brave enough to escape him--, he rarely noticed. His face remained the same; indifferent, even though it was working so hard not to shatter. He barely even felt the singular droplet slipping down his pale cheek. And if he did, he brushed it away immediately. Not just because it was a tear trespassing on his supposed-to-be-unfeeling face, but because it was so fragile. It would so innocently leave his eyes. It was humanizing and he wasn't supposed to be human. He was supposed to be a monster. That's what he knew he was. That's what he was told he was supposed to be. And who was he to argue?
He didn't notice the jingling of keys in the door. Not until Harry opened the door, allowing for the light that Draco had been protecting from himself to spill without warning into the room. Harry paused with a black puppy in his arms as he noticed the light cutting into the darkness that Draco had so carefully organized.
Draco sat curled into his own chest in the apartment he shared with Harry. They'd lived together only a few months and Draco's stuff was neatly tucked away in his drawers and shelves, though a few boxes were still strewn about the apartment since Harry hadn't taken the same care in unpacking his belongings. The room was pitch black with the curtains drawn and not even the light of the router in sight. Draco was completely submerged in darkness. It was the only thing he felt he could allow to hold him. Not always. Sometimes he really did feel even the slightest bit deserving of the affection Harry offered him. But other times, the darkness was just so much less easy to hurt. Draco couldn't trust himself not to hurt Harry. He was a villain. That's what he was born to do. So sometimes the darkness was just so much easier by which to let himself be trusted.
He didn't quite mind the greying of his eyes. Whatever, he figured. Maybe one day they'd go black. Maybe one day the color would disappear completely. Maybe it would take him with it. But it never did. His hope drained along with the color. His innocence that he was never meant to have, his confidence that he never thought he'd lose, his hope that he didn't think he ever really had, or deserved, they all faded along with the color. And they faded quickly.
Harry brought back the life in Draco's eyes. And once again, their blue was one for nature to envy. Just as mesmerizing and striking as they were always meant to be, Draco's eyes were blue again. And humbled by so many years of missing the colors. Draco didn't feel as though he deserved the life back in his eyes. Not unless he was looking at Harry. God, how those green eyes could persuade him. Even of the smallest of things. If Harry was too lazy to take their dog, Padfoot, for a walk, he simply caught Draco's gaze and Draco couldn't resist. If Harry wanted a cup of tea or for them to watch his favorite show instead of Draco's, he needed to do nothing more than look into the once-again-blue eyes that he had come to love more than his own. And their eyes fit so well together. Diamonds and emeralds.
Draco sank into his embrace, more relieved than he expected to find himself in the arms of something besides darkness.
Though the beauty didn't fade. Maybe even the opposite, actually. As the years dragged on and time dragged him reluctantly through his seven years of Hogwarts, his eyes lost their vibrance. They lost their motivation to be the blue that was once so captivating that even nature herself was entranced. It was a slow fade at first, each day darkening his eyes just half a shade or so. He barely noticed it. But after a few years, the change was more sudden. They had settled to a navy blue that was too exhausted to be any brighter than the night sky when the moon is at its thinnest.
Draco was quiet again for a moment before humming weakly his approval. Harry carefully creaked open the door and crouched down to let Padfoot free from his strong arms. He shut the door again, allowing for the darkness to take full possession of the room again. Padfoot scuttled his way excitedly toward Draco, whimpering as he searched for the boy's familiar hands to run along his shedding fur. Padfoot fondly licked Draco's elbow and nestled against his leg. So sweet a gesture. Too sweet a gesture. Draco didn't deserve it, he decided. He shifted his weight reluctantly away from the dog.
Draco drifted off to sleep in Harry's arms. A sleep untainted by the monsters under his bed from which he had always hidden. A sleep that was easy with the green-eyed boy breathing steadily beside him. A sleep that Draco finally deserved.
Harry let his finger rest on Draco's arm, just over a patch of scars that weren't new, but were still a gentle pink against his light skin. He couldn't see the scars through the dark, but he knew them well. "Is this okay?" he asked. Draco said nothing, but pressed the cold tip of his nose to Harry's neck in approval. Harry traced each of the scars, gentle with his touch. And Draco didn't flinch. He didn't feel the need to recede back into the darkness that he couldn't hurt. In Harry's embrace, he could let himself be treated with kindness. He didn't need every touch to be harsh and painful. The gentle tracing along his skin, the small kisses that Harry planted along Draco's forehead, even the tender assurances Harry whispered in his ear were nothing but comforting.
Harry wasn't supposed to be in Draco's life. At least, not the way he was. That's what Draco told himself. Harry was his exception, his soft spot, his too-good-to-be-true. Monsters aren't supposed to get a happily ever after. Villains aren't supposed to survive. Only heroes deserve that. That's how every story went. Every story that his mother had read to him when she would sneak into his room so as to not alert his father. They all ended with the hero surviving and the villain, well, the villain barely ever got an ending. And Harry was a hero. He was
Draco's eyes were a piercing blue. At least, they were supposed to be. He wasn't quite sure after about fifth year. In all his old photos-- baby photos where he was giggling in the stiff arms of his father whose face was always apathetic, photos from when he was nothing but an innocent toddler tugging at the white feathers of his father's owl, photos from his first day at Hogwarts where his smile was more genuine than it would ever again be-- his eyes were blue. A blue that not even the sky could match on its sunniest days. With different shades striking through them like they were shattered diamonds, fighting helplessly to keep their millions of shards together.
and the words that Harry spoke were easy to trust. It made Draco nearly uncomfortable how easy it was to hear them. But he really did believe them. Harry wasn't going anywhere.
Not in the slightest. Harry, with the olive skin whose scars Draco could trace for hours. Harry, with the arms in which for years Draco had longed to find himself. Harry, with the eyes painted nature's favorite color. Green like her grass, like her trees, like her fields. Intricate but unproblematic. No, the sun did not ignore Harry. It richened the tone of his skin, it held his face lovingly, it loved to find its reflection in his emerald eyes. The same ones into which Draco could stare forever.
How couldn't they have turned grey? After having seen his own hands end lives, after having seen his own father do the same. How could his eyes have not turned grey? Maybe they were never truly blue. Maybe that had been a mistake. Maybe his eyes were always meant to turn grey.
Even after the battle, when he wasn't actively proving himself to be the monster he knew he was, his reflection was still unbearable. Sure, the battle was over. But he was still there. The world was still burdened with his presence. Gravity still paid enough attention to keep him pinned to the ground, oxygen still apparently cared enough to fill his lungs as much, but maybe not as easily, as anyone else's. But Draco didn't think the sun wanted him there. It didn't even bother to burn his skin. He was always pale. And no amount of sunlight ever changed that. His eyes were still grey and lacking in the sparkle they had harnessed a lifetime ago. Whether he liked it or not, he was stuck on this world and the sun was stuck with him. Though it seemed to be ignoring that fact.
Brushing off the many flashing cameras and the screams for attention with a polite - but tired - smile, Harry Potter stepped onto the scarlet train. He sighed in relief as the doors closed behind him, effectively shutting out the dozen or so reporters that had gathered on the platform.
"Okay, well. Maybe you would like some treacle tart?" she asked, already trying to get the attention of Dean who seemed too busy with staring at the Irishman next to him to notice Hermione's attempts for him to pass her the treacle tart.
"Come on, you buffoon", Draco said impatiently, wrapping his long, elegant fingers around Harry's wrist and pulling the boy with him all the way to the Great Hall, all the while mumbling about bloody Gryffindors; Harry too shocked to complain much.
So Harry had been obliged to ask Hermione - again - if he could borrow one of her precious quills, promising her it would be the last time. He had tried to ask Ron once, but Harry had received a half-broken one that had eventually broken completely in the middle of a refresher test throughout the day. He hadn't bothered asking Ron after that.
"Like what you see?" Draco asked, now turning to also look at Harry, his grey eyes twinkling in the few rays of sunshine filtering through the thick rainclouds.
Draco seemed to hesitate for a bit, but when the brunette girl whispered something in his ear he smiled slightly, nodding his head and mounting his broom. He chased after the others, readying himself for the short game to start.
Growling against Draco’s lips, Harry pushed the blond harder against the wall, their bodies completely pressed together as he rolled his hips to meet Draco’s movements, their clad groins grinding together as he did so.
He absolutely didn't feel like going to classes today. The only thing he felt like doing was sleeping, but he knew it wasn't a smart option. It would only make him feel even worse.
"The position of Seeker will go to Harry Potter -" another round of applause with a few cheers "-the Beaters are Terry Boot and Hannah Abbott -" more applause and cheers "-and lastly Blaise Zabini and Mandy Brocklehurst will be our Chasers."
was that we wouldn’t be able to go trick-or-treating this year -” Teddy’s shoulders slumped slightly at that, his head leaning back against Harry’s chest “-
She walked away, leaving the boy alone as he kept staring at the lake. He took some pebbles again and resumed his throwing them into the water.
Trying to give his friends a reassuring smile, Harry shook his head. "Go on ahead", he said, "I'll join you in a few."
Draco had come up with the idea, one day. They had been standing on their balcony back in London, quite the same way as Harry was doing now, with expensive glasses of wine in their hands and lit cigarettes between their fingers.
“Because you were sad, and I wanted to make you feel better, and Severus said... I thought Severus said that people do that to one another to make them feel good.”
Harry unable to tear himself away from the painting had tears slowly dripping down his cheeks as he listened to Lucius explain the desire, he had within him that he had never been able to describe before.
Following his Eros instincts, Draco rushed outside. And sure enough, Harry was standing on the grass lit by the pre-dawn light. As Draco hurried over to him, he could see inky blackness swirling around Harry’s leg before forming into Sirius Grimm shape.
Draco looked down at his mate who was lying so trusting against him. It filled him with happiness and pride. His empathy had been slowly opening along with his wings and Draco had been getting random moments where he could feel what Harry was feeling. But when they were touching like this he could feel Harry completely. Once Harry’s negativity faded away Draco reached out with his free hand and grabbed the spoon from Harry breakfast.
“It was wise of you to both keep it hidden and activate it when you did so. Any longer and you would have been past the point of being able to be healed.”
Harry didn’t want to be a burden, the last thing he wanted was for Draco to come to his senses and find himself a different mate. Someone who was actually worthy. So, he picked up his spoon and started to eat. Draco beamed at him happily and Harry squirmed. His insides feeling warm that he had pleased Draco.
“A faggot, you must be. You keep calling out the boy’s name waking me up every night. I reckon that makes you a faggot.”
The door opened again, Draco came in, followed by Harry who was holding his hand. Tom felt Severus stiffen slightly, he knew it stemmed from Severus’ appalling lack of self-esteem. He still struggled with the fact that Tom was not ashamed in any way to be seen with him. Tom deliberately didn’t release him and after a second Severus’ body relaxed once more.
Thankfully, the plan his Lord had put in place made sure Narcissa both got to see him earlier than advertised and that Lucius was happy to wear cravats and Victorian styled clothes as his face and hand were the only part of him that was not covered in marks from his Mate. Marks that he had been just as desperate for and had encouraged her to give him more of them.
So, no matter how hard Sirius fought, no one paid any attention to him. It was a pointless battle that he would never win. Harry’s stomach gave another unease lurch and he could feel acid burn climbing up his throat. Bursting out of his seat, he ran to the nearest bathroom and only by the skin of his teeth did he make it in time. Once his body stopped heaving Harry dropped his head on the seat and just lay there panting, weak-limbed with a cold sweat coving his body.
“Up, out, get out of this house. You're stinking up the whole place. I don’t want to see your freakish face until it's time to cook dinner!” She screeched.
Everything had been happing so fast that his head was a whir wind since he had gotten here. He still didn’t know how he felt about living in Malfoy manor or what on earth to think about Voldemort. He had only asked him the question about his mother that had been burning inside because he was confident Voldemort would care enough about him to lie or soften the blow. Harry was so used to people lying to his face that he was going to take every opportunity to find out what they really thought. He found that listening to them talk when they didn’t know you where there was one of the best ways of getting the truth.
“It’s very Gryffindor,” Severus wasn’t sure what else was safe to say about the rainbow nail polish. But it was enough. Harry grinned, pleased.
Harry felt an overwhelming sense of relief and to his embarrassment, he burst into tears. He buried his face into Sirius’s neck and sobbed. Sirius didn’t seem bothered by them, though he just rocked Harry humming quietly. Once he was done Sirius tapped him lightly on the shoulder. Harry looked up at him with watery eyes.
They had discussed what Severus wanted to do after the night he found out what Lily had done to him. Severus had been completely practical and said that he was still useful as a spy, but now he would work in reverse. Tom had assured him that if he said he wanted out, they would find him somewhere safe where he could brew in peace. There were other ways that Tom could get his information. When Severus had refused Tom had thanked him for all his hard work.
“Any time,” Draco promised. Sirius pressed up against the other side of Harry and sandwiched between them Harry felt the last of his tension drain away. Together the three of them stood in silence, letting the peace of the morning soak into their bones as they watched the sunrise.
Once Dumbledore sat down Harry shot out of his seat and fled the great Hall running from the stares coming from all three schools. Ron and Hermione found him back in the hospital wing. Sitting on a bed looking out at the sky.
“What joys? Oh!” Severus shivered as he felt Tom’s finger slide against him. Tom then showed Severus just what he meant by both joy and taking your time. He coaxed and pulled groans and whimpers from Severus’ throat until Severus was making tons of noises he had never made before. His entire body taut with delicious tension. The noises shot up a pitch when Tom added his tongue into the mix until Severus was so lost in his head all his focus drawn to where Tom was touching him. His body rocking back onto Tom’s fingers and tongue as he subconsciously asked for more.
Padfoot was curled up at the end of his bed, once Harry moved, he padded up the bed and bathed Harry face while Harry wrapped his arms around him burying his face in the beloved fur as he clung to him. The feeling of holding onto his Godfather was the last straw he burst into tears crying hysterically. Padfoot whined worried squirming even closer. Harry had no control over his body, he was trembling all over and the tears were coming so fast he was completely blind. His chest hurt from the strength of his crying; breath hitching as he struggled to inhale. The feeling of helplessness only compounding the situation making it worse increasing the cycle. It got so bad that Harry’s lips began to turn blue.
“Are you staying for dinner, Blaise?” Draco asked once he reached Harry, running his hands through Harry’s hair.
Harry found himself studying Mr Malfoy who looked different than every other time Harry had seen him. He wondered if it was the fact that he was in private now instead of public or if the fact Harry was mated to his son that changed him. Because he didn’t have the sneering face or ugly look that Harry was so used to. Harry studied his unhurried movements and facial expression and the word peaceful seemed to best suit his look. Peaceful looked kind of nice on him.
Severus nodded it would do for the moment. He had a lot of work to build up trust before Harry would be completely honest with him. Severus knew he had to start out on the right foot, which meant no more stalling.
The combination of the spells left Dumbledore writhing on the floor in agony as it afflicted his body with multiple curses. He had lost three of his limbs plus most of the fingers on his remaining hand and for some reason both his ears and nose. Tom could see the remaining flesh bubble and splitting.
A scream broke out from the crowd once they realised that something had gone wrong. The headmasters from all three schools ran towards him. Dumbledore was the first to reach them. He grabbed Harry’s arms.
“How intriguing. Do you know I came across a doctorate about the mind once? Specifically, about the minds natural abilities to repress memory. No spell is necessary, sometime the mind will take a memory and lock it up.”
“Of course Severus, I have no problems with that request. You only need to let me know when and I would be delighted to fulfil your wish.”
Harry looked down at the book he had been reading. It was a generalisation of what having a mate meant. Unfortunately, it was written centuries ago and Harry was struggling with the archaic langue. Having never been much of a reader he looked around the office instead. While his body was constantly tired currently his mind was not. And reading didn’t appeal to him at all at the moment.
“Are you under the impression that the Mate is the weaker one of the pair? That the Eros does all the thinking for both of them and the Mate is nothing more than an empty head companion?”
“I will take that under consideration,” Dumbledore said to her before turning to Harry. “Lucius Malfoy claims he kept you to himself. That his wife and son did not know of your imprisonment there. Is that true, Harry?”
“My Lord? Using Occlumency I have already searched my mind and I cannot find any memory of Lily and I together nor can I find any sight of tampering.”
“Whoa, whoa, Shite” Sirius blurted out alarmed and shot off the bed to kneel in front of Harry, grabbing his arm. “Don’t hit yourself Pup alright? We will work this out.”
Harry lay on the floor limbs splayed looking up at his white ceiling. He was doing his best to stay cool, as this summer was unnaturally hot. He was extremely glad he had the foresight to tell Hedwig to fly free for the summer. He had left her at Hogwarts knowing she could come and go as she pleased. Hagrid had promised to keep an eye on her for Harry and he knew his beloved owl was in good hands.
It helped immensely. But it was six fully trained adults against one man and a half-trained recovering teen. They were doing extremely well, but it was taking its toll on them both. Lucius was covered in minor injuries and he had heard Harry yelp twice. None the less there was a moment when Lucius believed they would win this fight. They were down to an opponent each. Lucius against Mad eyed Moody and Harry was holding his own against Kingsley.
“He's mine!” Draco snapped at Severus and then bared his teeth. His sliver iris was glowing so brightly they were making their own light.
“You’re not the only one with some creature blood in you,” Narcissa continued calmly. “The Blacks are known to produce an Eros every generation or so. I am one and it seems my son is another. Although he has come into his inheritance rather early. No doubt due the sate poor Harry is in. Mates in danger or poor health have been known to trigger an early transformation.”
“Yes, Sir. I only ever saw and spoke with Mr Malfoy.” He couldn’t help speaking Lucius name with respect but hopefully, he could blame it on Hermione’s weird syndrome thingy.
He tried to get a couple hours of sleep during the day while Vernon was at work. All he managed was a light drifting. He hoped it would be enough that he wouldn’t fall asleep tonight. By the time the house settled down to sleep Harry had a plan. He stood by his window dressed in his boxes and singlet watching the night sky. He couldn’t fall asleep if he wasn’t horizontal. As the night slowly progressed Harry became wearier and wearier. His eyes kept sliding closed until he couldn't open them anymore. His head dropped then jerked back up before dropping again. Finally, Harry lent it against the window and lethargy crept up and took him over.
“Oh dear, that’s sooner than expected. And not quite the results we were planning for. Still what is done is done.” Came Narcissa voice from behind him.
The adrenaline was fading from his system and his body started to shake teeth chattering as a cold wave swept over him.
Their favourite spot to hide was on top of the roof. No one thought to look for them here. Why would they only crazy people would hang out on a snow-covered pitched roof in all weather. But then everyone seemed to forget that both Sirius and Harry had been accused of being crazy on multiple occasions. The roof wasn’t as bad as people would think. Sirius put warming charms on their clothes and had a totally cool sticking spell that let their shoes cling to the roof, and yet they could still walk around. And neither one of them had any issues with height. Sometimes Harry would straddle the root cap and lean into the chilly wind blowing in his face. He would pretend that he was on his broom and flying through a snow stormed quidditch game. Sirius had thrown his head back laughing delighted when Harry explained what he was doing. He then copied Harry facing him, and the two of them pretended they were flying on the opposite team. They would throw their torso wildly from one side to another, trying to dodge their opponent's attack. Now and then one or the other would throw themselves too hard and they would begin to slide down the side of the roof. Thankfully Sirius’ shoe sticking spell worked great, and they never fell over three feet or so.
“It’s a muggle thing, it’s a psychological response that occurs when kidnap victims bond with their captors. It can occur in as little as a couple of days or over weeks or months. Since Harry has been with Mr Malfoy for four months, that was plenty of time for it to happen.”
“.... Left to long! The shock had him with one foot in the grave...... luck I managed to bring him back”
Suddenly he was engulfed in a soft cloak that covered him completely. Hood drawn up so he no longer had to see all those eyes staring at him.
Harry’s eye flew open with shock, He knew it; he knew it was no good trying to tell adults anything.
“Ouch” Blaise looked around then turned pale. “Fuck!” He cursed and stumbled backwards away from Draco.
“Once when I was younger. My brain lived in the two hairy ball sacks that hang between my legs. It bloody true,” Sirius said to the growing grin on Harry’s face. His own grin not helping Harry any in his efforts to be serious. “In fact, I reckon my brain misses living down there. I’m fucking sure there are times when it just wants to bloody swing free in the air and get a good fucking scratching each morning.”
Blaise did not understand why Harry needed different touches clarified for him, but in the back of his mind, a small alarm bell rang.
Tom walked over to him and gently took his hands, stopping Severus from cause himself any more harm.
Harry looked down at the food nausea threatening to erupt out of him. He knew there was no way he could say that he wasn’t hungry so to please his friends he picked up his knife and fork and began to cut the sausages. Ron happily tucked in beside him and Hermione eyed him with a frown but also began to eat. Harry watched her out of the corner of his eye. As soon as she was looking at her own plate, he would slip some of his food onto Ron’s who never noticed the difference. Then he would place the empty fork into his mouth and only remove it when she looked back at him. It had taken him a while to get this system down pat but by now he had it down to an art form. As far as Hermione was concerned Harry was eating as she saw the food disappearing and the utensils exiting his mouth.
When Dumbledore proclaimed Voldemort was alive once more, he was telling a lie. There was no Voldemort, not anymore, just Tom Riddle. Who finally become wise enough to accept his name and his heritage. Both the glorious and the mundane. He would do what he originally set out to do, change the ministry for the betterment of all magical kinds.
“That was extremely well-done Draco, I had not thought of a tent myself. I’m sure this will help Harry immensely.”
“I’m a bit cold, I think I might get out dressing gowns,” Draco summoned his, but for Harry, he summoned Severus old gown that Harry had worn while he was still wondering the moors in his madness. Draco wrapped Harry up and could feel his body relaxing as the beloved piece of clothing brought more sanity to his eyes.
“Let’s go inside,” Draco suggested quietly “and I can warm you up with a nice hot drink. Then we can look at all the different colours available and you can choose which one you would like me to paint your nails in.”
Draco lifted the cover and revealed three bowls. One had Draco’s breakfast, One was filled with mixed berries and the last was a special dish with a porridge consistency that everyone had been giving to Harry. It was filled with high energy; high nutrients and it was helping Harry recover from the lack of proper food. Harry sighed soundlessly. While it didn’t taste bad it was very bland. It barely had any taste at all. Which meant that Harry was disinclined to want to eat it. What compounded the issues was even though the amount was quite small, Harry was being fed it somewhere between six to eight times a day.
Harry sat back and tried and accumulate the new knowledge Tom had given him. He needed to twist it this way and that before he could make it fit in with the rest of his expanding world views.
Draco gave his head an extra scratch in reassurance, cooing something in Enochian, then led him to the dining room.
Harry finished looking at his arm for the moment lent back and closed his eyes letting out a sigh. Draco began to once again stroke his hair and let out a quiet croon hoping to lure his mate into taking a nap with him before they were made to get up for the day. Harry breathing slowed down and his body lost all its tension as he melted against Draco’s chest. A moment later and he was asleep.
Afterwards, He scurried to the bathroom gulped down as much water as he could then went to the toilet. Dudley locked him back in afterwards but that suited Harry just fine.
“Nobody wants me,” was said in a defeated voice from behind them. Severus blinked in shock as Draco spun back around to face Harry.
“Mate, is that? Did you piss yourself?” Ron asked horrified looking at the growing wet patch in Harry’s bed.
His answer seemed to calm the child somewhat as his breathing settle and he clumsily sat up. Severus wordless handed over his glasses and watched as Harry put them on.
Harry bit his lip and fidgeted a little trying to gather his courage and ask about the different things that were bothering him.
Voldemort flicked his wand and the ropes disappeared from around Harry. The sudden loss of restriction made Harry fall to his knees, hands automatically outstretch to stop himself from falling on his face. His arm started to bleed again and his leg shot agony up his spine as the fall reopened the wound he had gotten in the maze. Harry grunted then shot his head up convinced this was some trick, but Voldemort had backed away and was standing out of arms reach, the hand holding his wand was lowered to his side. He turned and began to walk away pausing by the slumped form of Wormtail.
Still, Severus knew better than to grab Harry, much as he wanted to wrap him up in a blanket and never let him go. It would be the worst thing he could do. Harry had been through something that most did not live to tell the tale, he had to come to Severus of his own free will or else, all would be lost.
“Harry?” Draco was puzzled when Harry handed him the oil, then walked over to Tom and handed him the comb. He then pulled the other cushion off the couch and dropped it at Tom’s feet. Harry then reached out and gently lay his fingers against Severus’ cheek.
The tears were still sliding down his face, one after another with no sign of stopping. Harry stumbled over to the window and watched the sunrise with a dazed and hopeless expression. Only seven more days. He tried to console himself, but the prospects of going back to Hogwarts did not fill him with joy for the first time. Going back would mean he was still separated from his mate and would be surrounded by the Light lackies. Harry felt his upper lip twitch in a sneer, even with the tears still falling. He hated the Light! They were a bunch of hypocrites and liars. Even the prospects of being finally able to see Severus was tainted. It was Harry's fault Severus was hurt. Harry didn’t deserve to have such a quietly noble and amazing talent person as Severus as his Father.
“Well, what else could we do? There wasn’t the budget to hire more teachers...” Pomona began only to be interrupted by a furious Minerva
“He is here. Trust me, I know these things. I am the only one standing in his way. You must join me in this fight against him.” Dumbledore said. There was more laughter at this.
He went through the dossier on all the potential candidates for the next Minister of Magic. Tom had no desire to be the figurehead for the British Wixen. He was far more interested in being the power behind the throne. After all, Kings and Queens changed all the time, the power that would stay the same for centuries if done right.
“Harry, I'm afraid we have run out of time to indulge childish whims. You are old enough now to understand that every second counts. Would you have us lose precious time because you want an adult to hold your hand treating you like you are afraid to sleep?” Dumbledore asked solemnly.
He could hear Sirius whimpering quietly next to him, rolling over he studied Sirius face. It was mostly slack with sleep, but there was still a frown line over his eyes and his mouth flickered into a grimace now and then. Harry felt sadness swirl within him. He loved his Godfather and wanted to help make him feel a little better. But he still didn’t have that good a grasp on what would work. He inched closer, thinking that maybe some sort of touch. Draco and Severus had been working on convincing him that touch from a loved one can be extremely nice. And the few hugs and the times Sirius wrapped his arm around Harry’s shoulders seemed to back this claim.
besides darkness. With a heartbeat that could synchronize with Draco's own and a breath that hummed in Draco's ear. Draco let himself be held, sinking more trustingly into Harry's shoulder each passing moment that the darkness loosened its grip on him, entrusting him into Harry's embrace.
"Good morning, love," Harry whispered from beside him, one arm still around Draco's shoulder, but the other now holding Draco's waist, too. Draco finally opened his eyes fully, allowing for the sun to greet them. The first thing he saw was Harry's eyes. The ones in which he felt at home. The ones that so elegantly embraced the light of the sun with every gaze. The ones into which Draco could stare forever.
He especially couldn't bring himself to meet his own gaze. Reflections were nothing but painful reminders that his eyes were there to take in the poor world that was forced to grant him oxygen. The world that was already so dark without the grey of his eyes to steal even more of its light. The world whose air was already so hard to breathe without him stealing it away from someone who probably deserved it more. The world that didn't deserve him. When he was a kid, he believed the same. But for completely different reasons. When he was a kid he was so much bigger than the world could hold, he was Malfoy. Draco Malfoy. The sharp-witted blonde boy who wouldn't let anything stop him. Whose walk was more confident than most people can even fake. Whose eyes were a brilliant blue. But as years passed, he came to a new realization. No, the world didn't deserve him. But it was because he was Draco Malfoy. The boy who had no choice and still managed to make all the wrong ones. The boy whose fate it was to be evil. The boy who didn't question that for a second.
Severus ducked his head, not sure what was the right response. Was Tom just saying that to be nice? And yet his instincts were telling him Tom may have regained his sanity, but he did not turn into a goody-two-shoes. If he was asking then it was because he wanted it.
Tom chuckled lowly, placing a kiss on Severus’ back. “Obviously no one has told you about the joys of taking your time and doing a thorough job.”
Tom snorted to himself. It was completely ridiculous, but the public would lap it up. And Draco would flourish under the attention, wielding the power of their reputation and putting it to good use. And making sure Harry didn’t have to worry about it. Harry would finally get the support and encouragement he needed. Not just from those who knew him personally, but from absolutely everybody he asked.
“There is, and I’ll prove it. I’ll let you go first even,” Dudley bragged back. Harry got a sinking feeling that this was going to be worse than normal. Dudley turned to him and demanded. “You’re going to suck our cocks, Potter.”
Harry still didn’t know what to think about Voldemort. He was the wizarding worlds big Evil he had been told to fight, the reason he didn’t have parents and grew up with the Dursley’s and Harry had fought off different versions of him in two of his school years.
Harry had gotten up when Narcissa had brought out her wings and he was now standing in the middle of the room swaying slowly. He was looking at Narcissa and Lucius, but when his mind was clouded no one knew just how much he was observing. Suddenly animating, he walked over to an empty couch and pulled one of the cushions off and holding either side of the big squishy square staggered over to where Draco was sitting. He dropped it at Draco’s feet.
Harry shook his head again. Making himself comfortable Severus began singing the saga that his mother had taught him about the Viking called Ragnar. It didn’t take long for colour to slowly creep back into the boy’s cheeks as he became captivated in the story. he was so enthralled that when it came time for his next meal he absentmindedly ate the whole bowl without having to be coaxed to finish it for the first time since he got here.
“Like having to let her boss you around, and do whatever she says? Does it ever annoy you that you don’t get a say?”
“I cannot stay here for another moment listing to the two of you billing and cooing” came a grumpy voice.
“This idiot decided to bring a dementor with him when he went to go see our prisoners. And in a move that shocks absolutely no one, the dementor decided to feast dealing out two kisses.” Snape sneered.
Dumbledore stood up from the head table and the whole hall fell silence far faster than it ever had before. Everyone knew something had happened at the end of the tournament and they all wanted to hear what the Headmaster was going to say. All except Harry who felt dread creep up his legs and twine around his body.
The second the door opened, Harry shot through and belted towards his room. Once inside, he slammed the door the hastily slid under his bed curling up in the furthest darkest corner. His eyes glued to his door, waiting to see if anyone would come after him. By the time the sun set, Harry’s entire body had cramped up, but thankfully no one had come through the door. Not wanting to draw any attention to himself, Harry soundlessly slid out from under the bed and opened the wardrobe. He pulled out two pairs of uncle Vernon’s old socks and the quickly slid back under the bed.
“What on earth is that?” Mrs Weasley asked. Harry could see the majority of the people looked confused.
“I warned you” He growled and grabbed Harry by the hair he yanked him up to his feet. The next thing Harry knew something leathery was placed over his mouth and chin, straps going both on top of his head and behind it. Vernon was pulling the straps so tight Harry could feel them digging into his skin. He tried to cry out but there was no way he could open his mouth. The most he could do was whine in his throat. The noise seemed to please Vernon who had a nasty grin on his face.
“Open your mouth for me, Harry.” He whispered into his mate’s ear. Harry obeyed and Draco carefully put the full spoon inside. “Can you eat this for me?” He asked. Harry closed his mouth around the spoon swallowing the food down.
Dumbledore pushed open the doors and strode to Harry’s bedside when Madam Pomfrey tried to say he wasn’t ready for visitors Dumbledore brushed her off
A stab of horror and pity hit Severus; it said a lot that this was the first question to come out of Harry’s mouth. Not, where am I? Or What happened? But am I safe?
“Back with me?” Tom asked tenderly, Severus nodded, suddenly overcome with shyness. Tom smiled and brushed tiny kisses over his face.
“Close your eyes,” Draco said. Harry did and a moment later he felt Draco running his hand through his hair. That sensation along with the warmth of Draco pressed up against his back made Harry relax completely. His brain stopped screaming at him and everything went blissfully quiet.
At that point, when Severus first saw the sharp angles, bony, muzzled foetal shape caught in the statues spell it had taken him a disturbingly long time to even recognise it as a human. His first impression was some misshapen creature. It had taken both of them to get the muzzle off the child. No magic could be used on him while he was in stasis and it had been tightened on so hard that Severus was reduced to using his thinnest potion knife and cutting the straps before peeling it from his skin. He also had to cut away at the hair where the buckles were as it was hopelessly tangled. It was at this stage that he had asked who the child was. In answer, Voldemort lent down and swept the fringe off the boy’s forehead. A red lightning bolt scar stood out vividly.
The red eyes blinked and broke Harry from the spell, he turned his head and looked around hoping to find something to help him but nothing had changed. It took him a long moment to realise that Voldemort hadn’t said anything else and wasn’t attacking him. Harry looked back to see Voldemort surveying him contemplatively.
Harry froze, the one thing Vernon hated more than Harry was homosexuals. If he ever got the idea that Harry was one then the pain that he would melt out would be beyond excruciating. He would do anything to avoid that.
“Dumbledore has finally sent for me,” Severus said. “I need to go,” handing Tom the brief letter. Tom took it but kept hold of Severus’ hand. He skimmed it, then nodded his head, not stopping Severus from doing what he must.
Severus paused and knelt, examining the ground. The reason he was out here not with Tom is the Order informed him that Black turned into his animagus form and run off, there had been paw prints and bite marks on the grisly remains of the Dursleys. Which meant that Black made it to the house. Normally Severus would assume Black died with the rest of the household, for once a child released an Obscurus there was no holding it back. Yet Severus overheard a muggle saying they had seen a big black dog wandering away from the destruction of the house. Traitors hope filled Severus’ chest and that brought him out here. If Black survived, there was the smallest of infinitesimal chances Harry did. Even if there had only been a skerrick of a chance, they would still find Severus out here, searching.
“Indeed. As it has been in the case where the future happiness and strength of the relationship depends on what I have to say. It was a complete debacle. My impuissance to be able to convey my thoughts has ever been my Achilles heel.”
“I found them, they’re alive,” was the first thing out of Severus’ mouth when three pairs of eyes swung towards him.
“Yes, Mr Potter, the truth is far more complex than that.” Mr Malfoy informed him. “In reality, it’s a much more equal partnership. The Eros will choose someone who they believe can fight and protect them to be their mate. They in return will care for and look after them.”
He had said what was needed in simple points and then even better he had promised Harry that he could ask questions whenever he wanted, not didn’t force him to respond straight away. Another point in Snape’s favour is the fact he didn’t dump this on Harry then run off to do other important adult things. He had stayed and told Harry this awesome story song thing. Something that no matter what else happened Harry wanted to complete, he wanted to know what happened next. Also, he had no idea that Snape could sing or that he would have such a great voice.
Harry feeling like he was slightly floating again began to shake his head then paused before holding out his arm where Wormtail had taken his blood. Pomfrey waved her wand and looked at the diagnostic. She then summoned a jar and gently unwrapping the bandage she rubbed it into the cut before reapplying the bandage. Everything else seemed to be ok. Since he was dressed in the hospital pyjamas Pomfrey must have dealt with all the other wounds.
Dudley smirked down at him knowing that he had won. He released his grip on Harry arm but tighten his hold in his hair
When he arrived, he was met with a semi frantic man who had snapped at him to stop grovelling and get rid of the foolish mask and to follow him at once they had a life to save. Voldemort had told him he placed a stasis spell the second he arrived but it was already crumbling at the edges. That was quite disconcerting as it meant that the person in the stasis spell was in an extremely critical condition.  the spell couldn’t stop death’s embrace. Not even one done by someone as powerful as the Dark Lord the most it could achieve was slow down the damage and increase the amount of time the healers had to work.
She had torn every bit of the prison garbs off him, then got him onto the single size bed. Laying him on his back, she had knelt above his groin, her wings flaring out to their full length as she slid down him. She then rode him through the mattress. After a couple of bouts of vigorous lovemaking, Lucius had been treated to hours of Narcissa checking every bit of him over and pampering him with a full body massage. She poured expensive oils onto his body, kneaded his sore muscle and giving him a slow and thorough hand job, the oils warming under their combined body heat giving her every touch a smooth glide. The combination of orgasms, massage and the Eros trilling turned him into a boneless lump so relaxed he couldn’t move if he tried. But Narcissa wasn’t done. Crooning almost constantly, she worked moisturisers into his skin that had become worn with the constant exposure to the sea spray and freezing air. Only once he was as pampered as he was going to get did Narcissa decide she was done.
“There is more that we need to discuss but I am going to leave it for the meantime. You need a chance to heal and recover. Speaking of it is three days since you were last awake. From what I gather you activated the portkey that the Dark Lord gave you.”
Harry watched as Draco walked quietly over to him in order to not disturb Snape. Harry’s eyes were drawn to play of morning light over Draco’s bare chest. He didn’t know why the sight was so fascinating to him. Draco had been walking around bare-chested for days to let his wings grow properly. And yet despite having seen it before Harry couldn’t stop looking. Thankfully Draco tolerated Harry gaze on him. He hadn’t mocked Harry for looking and had even once been extremely nice and let Harry examine him from all angles one day. Harry was pretty sure it was only the fact he was Draco’s mate that he had let Harry touch him. Harry knew it was weird and not cool but he had been dying of curiosity to see what real muscles felt like. With all this looking that Harry was doing, he had noticed that Draco was changing a bit every day. His shoulders were becoming broader and he was packing on muscles. Especially in the shoulder and back area. But his arms were getting extra as well. Harry observed that it was linked with how much his wings had grown that night. Wing which still were patchily covered in white fluffy down but were already the length from Draco’s shoulders to his knees. And they were still growing. The wings were going to be huge by the time they were done.
“Merlin’s saggy balls, would you stop!” Harry turned but saw Sirius wasn’t talking to him but aimed that remark to his groin. He let out another snarl then snatching up his wand he pointed it at his penis.
Harry’s skin broke out in goosebumps and he renewed his struggle.  Wormtail cringing and sobbing shakily rose to his feet and withdrew a black robe from his pocket. He clumsily draped it over the figure who shrugged off his help and he collapsed once more cradling his stump to his chest.
“A token for you. If you rip it, it will bring you to me no matter where you are and then we can have that talk.” He gently put it into Harrys trouser pocket.
“No, no apologies,” Sirius said firmly “Not until you explain what the bloody hell going through your head. Why did you think that was an ok thing to do?”
“Because the next step is entirely up to you. I have enough information that I can make an educated guess at what happened. More relevant is the fact that I personally don’t need to know any more. I’m satisfied with what we have. You on the other hand may wish to know without any doubt what occurred or you may decline to want any more than this. It's your choice.”
Tom knew he would need to give Dumbledore something to focus his attentions on freeing up Tom to move in the background. He contemplated what use his followers in Azkaban could have. Since he was planning to get Lucius out, he could tweak his plans and add a couple more people to the jailbreak. Although his original and still currently the best plan was to get Lucius out legally. He would have a easier time of it if he wasn’t on the run from the Aurors.
Author comes staggering over, bits of leaves, grass, fluff, feathers and glitter is stuck all over them. their fingers are glued closed and it looks like they have cut chunks out of their hair.
“Eighteen if it is an adult asking. If it’s another kid, then both of them have to be at least sixteen.” Sirius said firmly. Harry bit his lips, then figured Sirius would want him to ask if he wasn’t sure about something.
Harry also treated the gown to the poke test, then grabbed. What followed would have Severus laughing at the comedy of errors had it been under any other situation. Harry took a bite out of it then realised it wasn’t for eating. It took him a bit to feel just how warm it was, but once he did, he was in a mad scramble to dress himself. Sirius was attempting to help but only making things twice as hard as he stood on bits of the gown and pulled other sections with his muzzle. Eventually, the pair of them got there, the clothing making him look years younger. He tugged on Sirius trying to get him to fit under the gown but as the Grimm was the same height as him it was not a straightforward task. Not helped because Sirius didn’t want to let Severus out of his sights for a second. Eventually, the poor mutt crouched down on his belly and crawled in between Harry’s legs. The gown was big enough that it covered Sirius completely once he was curled around Harry’s feet. Still not wanting to give up on his protection, Sirius stuck his muzzle out between the buttons at Harry’s knee height and rumbled threateningly.
“That was the good news, I’m afraid. To live through becoming an Obscurial was a miracle, but it left its mark. They are both animalistic at the moment, with no higher brain thoughts happening at all. There is a chance Harry could slowly make his way back to us. The same cannot be said for Sirius. The magic around him is unusual, and I don’t fully understand it. But I can recognise enough to know that he will never reverse out of his Grimm form.” Severus sighed, such an act of unselfish sacrifice done for the betterment of Harry, wiped clean any debt and lingering animosity he held for Sirius.
The Order was still looking none more franticly than the mutt and the wolf. But they could not find Harry in the last two weeks of the summer holidays and were no closer to finding him now. Which didn’t mean that they got to stop. Dumbledore had every sorted into shifts according to their work and family commitments.
“I’m happy to show you but not here. Eros are dominate creatures and I have no desire to battle it out with my son.”
Instead, it seemed it was his other luck in play, the sort that allowed a clueless First-year walk away unharmed from an encounter with a mountain troll. Voldemort had told him to raise his occlumency shields then with a supportive hand on his shoulder had informed him that Harry was his son. They couldn’t be more closely connected if they tried.
The kind of grey that is marbled all different shades. With traces of black finding their way to streak the grey, and the occasional white speck sneaking in amongst the black. They were no longer blue, but they were no less entrancing. And even more dizzying. Looking into his eyes was like staring up at the sky during a storm. Unsafe and unpredictable, yes, but also so entrancing that the world itself seems to be wobbling in attempts to keep the sky in its place when all it wants to do is come crashing down. And his eyes did. That's all they wanted. It was nearly impossible to match eyes with anyone because he simply couldn't. He wasn't capable of lifting the weight of his eyes that had sunk them from blue to grey. And even when he did, his tired gaze was matched with a disgusted one. Or an expecting one. And on very rare occasion, a pitiful one.
