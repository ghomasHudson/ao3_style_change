I do believe I need a tutorial on that.
“He’s then next in line to take over for Professor Stiger when he retires next year. I’ve got this review of other restrictions. I think we should consult with Aunt Fleur on these Vela restrictions. Some of them actually seem somewhat reasonable? And then Merepeople. We don’t really have a connection to consult with. I’ll look into that one some more.”
“HA! Jerry and I will plan something then. . . . .We may just have to get George and Ron to help.”
You hate it? It’s platinum with a muggle carbon fibre inset. I know it’s simple and not horribly expensive or anything, but I liked it.
It’s pretty easy, just click on the link and it should start playing. It runs about 2 hours so let’s all meet up back here at midnight!
Radnor Arms. We’ll take us after? It’s NOT fancy. CUTE. Good food. Muggle.
“2nd floor lobby over the seating areas. With Teddy’s big painting on that back wall behind it.”
“Maxon? Yeah. . . . . . he nurtured one of the mimbulus mimbletonia divisions back from the brink. . . . . got extra credit for that. Nev was very impressed.”
“Really?”
The better question is can he dance?
Yes of course.
“You up now?”
“I’ll never get how they just melded into things so easily. It’s like there were no second thoughts at all.”
“First of all because you’re just a fucking painting. Maybe also because you were a dreadful pathological MONSTER who deserves much worse than what’s coming TODAY.
“I’ll have you know that my Cousin and his Husband raised four wonderful children. And you can fuck right off, Judy.”
“What book do you want? Do you have one or would you like something from the Library? I’ve got a stash of comics if we want.”
Casual. Strict no robes rule!
“Yay? Dad I think he sees like Auntie Luna.”
“You did?”
Okay I’ve texted Dad. We can tell you what we know about the vault.
An invitation from Jay and Agruella.
“He makes it different. ”
Meeting with Mr. Kreacher and his beloved in the great hall for lunch. Minerva McGonagall will be there as well, I spoke with her through the floo. She says the Elf table is quite festive and that Mr. Kreacher is quite excited to be our host. Wants to introduce us to the students?
That would be COOL! I’ll suggest it to Louis!
“So, Rosie turning purple is optional?”
If it’s Elfs they will all be paid fairly. Just like Zebb. They’ll have an employment contract. No freaking house binding or some such crap. I’m not going backwards on this.
—————————————————————
Yeah, no kidding.
It’s Saturday night Draco! They can stay up all night if they want to!
NO. I’m just thinking ahead? I don’t know? And crap I need to talk to Luna.
Everyone’s opinion is valued and everyone has a voice. Even when you don’t agree we’ll listen. People change their minds every day.
“It’s a date. Pick a film?”
“Well, now it’s just an ugly run down storefront. It’s in terrible condition.”
Alright, Mother. Have a good day.
Your hand is still intact?
Cryptic!
“What the fuck is going on?”
“What is that?”
Okay? When.
“Yes. That one is a bit larger too so it won't get lost over that huge fireplace. If you leave it vertical it will tower over the room though.”
Yes I can and I’ll throw Molly and Ginny in there too if I have to!
PS: Give Herman vanilla biscuits if you still have some available.
I know it’s a lot to take in.
Okay.
“One day we brought in empty dump trucks. Ginny met them at the top of the hill and transfigured some pebbles to look like boulders. Drove those around for a day. A lot of the exterior work on the house we ended up doing at night. Had muggle scaffolding set up and had a couple of guys hang out looking busy during the day and then brought in the night crew for the real work.”
Lils and Eric.
Jaydne. But my associates refer to me as Jay.
“It stretches. . . . . . . see? Mine fits just fine and it’s your size . . . . . . Put it on.”
Note: The Wands of James and Lilian (Lily) Potter, received from Ministry of Magic are interred in this vault.
“YES!”
Finally!
“Alright where else should we go. I’m afraid I can’t stay too much longer today. Can you come back?”
No. My work is done. Not bad for a Thursday. Love you bye!
“You do it! I’m afraid to touch it.”
I don’t have permission to bring the boys over. I’d have to ask. Probably not on the roof though either. I know it’s got the falling prevention on it, but Zebb would literally kill me if I brought Davey up there. She doesn’t even want them going out on the protected balconies.
“I’ve loved it, Draco.”
Headline 4:
“We’ll just have to take our chances. It's possible, but we’ve been trying for years now and nothing.”
“You say that, but it' not a small step. It's a huge leap. . . . and look at everything else you did today? Merlin.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Residence above - Quidditch and Things / Lupin Galleries.
“Miss Parks want’s more guests.”
and therefore the Profit(sic) is grasping at straws to yet again fabricate something, anything, out of thin air.
Oh Thank Merlin. I didn’t think you’d do it.
“I’m scared. I’m not going to lie.”
“Oh I need cake. Wait right here! You need some too.”
Mini,
_______________________________________
I’m glad you guys had a good time!
Love you!
“OH FUCK NO!”
“Draco dear, come here.”
“Get Draco one of those brooms and and you’ll really have a show.”
“I don’t get it.”
“We’re going to just ride to the end of the field and back. Really slow okay? Just lean forward and think in your mind that the front gate is where you want to go.”

“Did you hear that?”
Close.

Pedaling.
_____________
I’m going to get the conservatory all fixed up and planted for it!
“phhhhht. So many times!”
“Oh Merlin.”
Posting the weekend early.
I want you to team with me for the cannonball competition.
We should have that framed. I don’t think Dad even has one of her paintings.
“Of all nights, I think she can stay up a little late. Potter, you’ve gotten over-excited.”
MALFOY-POTTER.LUPIN-POTTER
“We must!”
Of course. You should ask Dud if he wants to come too.
“I’ll try not to do that. And no, I’m not restricting you to one floor of your own house. I hope you’ll take her down to see the fish. It’s a little overcast, but still a nice day.”
“Flattery, Malfoy?”
“Let’s start with Mr. Liogell.”
“Would you?”
I will.
Okay that’s nice. What’s the urgency?
“I’ve already shown you the pedals and how to put it into gear. You need to remember to keep your foot on the brake when you put it into the driving mode.”
Hermione will file it. . . . .Now, we move on. . . . .Do you accept the Wizengamot seats, and do you do it of your own free will?”
“Draco, look at it a little differently. The penthouse could be your base of operations. Like Harry goes to the harpies centre. Then you’re not tripping over each other all day and you have your collections.”
He said something about that.
“We haven’t decided on that yet. Oh but we are going to have a family get together in about a week or so upstairs. We can put this cloud background in the dining room and you can visit for that?”
Dear Family and Friends,
that . . . . I love you
“Probably a good idea. MOTHER WHAT THE HELL!”
That works!
Short chapter before the weekend updates that didn't fit with the other timeline.
“I can’t remember? Hugo picked this one.”
We touched on this briefly earlier but it’s become more complicated. My Muggle Cousin’s daughter, Lucy got a Hogwarts letter. Some of you remember them from before. It was a big surprise for them. Big one for me too. I’m the official designated person now to help them out.
“That damned bird.”
Thursday at around 16:00.
You’ll learn Mr. Malfoy, in time, that you are only one of many on the Wizengamot.
“About the time when Louis asked about some robes? Why didn’t you tell anyone that stuff before? That’s not what they taught in history!”
“You want to try it? We don’t know if it will work!”
“What is this wood?”
Over the years the concept of the four houses blurred. Rivalries softened and students began to not only socialize with members of other houses, but develop deep friendships. What we may remember of our own experience at Hogwarts is a far cry from where students are today. And I dare to say that change came from parents who experienced war raising their own children to value others as individuals rather than jump to conclusions based on a decision made by a hat at the age of eleven.
“Cute. I like the stripes! You’ve got paint on your nose. Hi Uncle Dean.”
“You don’t want to know.”
“Ha! You could fly a broom from here down to the front door!”
POTTER. MALFOY. PRIVATE. CHAT
——————————————————————————
. . . . . .
Al. There’s only two other teams in our league. We all know each other.”
“Shite, here comes Zebb with Davey. HIDE THE BROOMS!”
“Good evening. How is Mister Liogell treating you?”
“Good morning Jay! Lucy, Mr. Liogell is going to take us to your Vault.”
I was not.
I’d prefer your pasta but I think we need delivery.
Okay. Just let me know!
“Date night! Where are you taking him? Or is he taking you or?”
“Not too much. It looks nicer than that horrible exhibit of the trumped up “crown jewels”. Where did you get all of the descriptions? This is amazing.”
My Dad NEVER allowed anyone to see any of those things. It’s so much fun to see them.
“Okay?”
I want to make portkeys for all of the kids.
PLEASE? It’s after the actual competition. I’m going to ask Mum to host it.
“Right outside.”
I'm going to deviate from the conversation for a moment if I may? You can tell me it's none of my business.
Harry, we can stop any time you want.
“Harry if you would like to do that I can make it happen.”
Harry was kind enough to pop over and instruct me on how to do it yes. it’s much more convenient than this phone.
Dear Mr. Liogell,
“That’s it. We’re done.”
“Let’s not talk about Scorp. Let’s talk about the marks you can’t see.”
“Maybe in the main floor powder room?”
“That makes sense. Yes it’s bendy like the chairs in the ballroom. . . .and it’s locked. . . . .OH Narcissa I like that one much better!”
She want’s to WHAT????? And Twenty owls????
Mr. Malfoy will be the only attendee. I am keeping this as private as possible for the immediate future. Depending on the outcome I will decide what to do with the information as I do not want to overcomplicate the process.
We have been in contact with Sean McAlroy and have asked for a statement. The response was a curt email stating: “Confirmed.” Accompanied by the usual profanity laced admonition.
HARRY J. POTTER
I guess. I’ve just never brought anyone home with me before and it’s going to be awkward.
We thought he’d like to go?
“I certainly understand.”
Thank you.
“Hello Decram. Yes, you call out the name and tell it what you want it to do. Like “Hey Frank, play channel 4” and it changes the channel. Choose something unusual that no one else would use though. Nothing common.”
Dad said we can all do a Geminio on any of the photographs or books so that’s cool. We just need to do that soon cause he’s determined to get it done before the wedding.
If you’d like me to bring anything please let me know.
“I don’t know what to say.”
“Alright then. I have none. No intentions. Rose and I like each other and enjoy each other’s company. We will continue to go on dates and excursions together until a time comes when we decide together to announce anything different. That’s not to say we aren’t thinking of the long term, but that’s where it stands today.”
He can wear a fucking real shoe!
"Pale skin, Potter."
“I just thought the modern industrial look would be better here without trying to medieval castle it up. With all of the stone in here it needed a breather. So now you’re ready for the New Year party?”
“The ones around the bottom are taking a wee.”
. . . . . . . . . .
“That’s really everything?”
. . . . . . . . . .
“Too big.”
What? Why?
“Mr. Harry is very much like his Grandmother.”
Correct answer = 3 points
“So, what made you choose that place out of all of the others?”
“Crazy Bella just says something like: “OH. Cool it’s THE wand”, but for some reason none of them make a connection. It’s so fucking obvious that Harry is sitting in front of them. Anyone could see it, but because I said I didn’t think it was him????
C/O Hollyhead Harpies Centre, Executive Offices
“Harry likes the ribbon.”
Mr. Hawkworth was it?
I’d better go.
Sounds like a fucking museum.
“It’s a rainbow of multi-coloured braids. It’s a tapestry.”
Your attendance is required for the measuring of wedding attire one week from this coming Wednesday. Please do not be late. The schedule is as follows:
“You could frame a few and put them up.”
No reason to be nervous. It’s just Mum and Pops. I can’t wait to get you in my little MG. The drive up to the cliffs is really pretty.
You should bring Ruby, I’d like to meet her.
“HA!”
“Would you like some coffee or tea?”
“Defeat’s the purpose of cake, Scarhead.”
No, It’s not fair to Jay and Louis. What do I do?
Ron and George will be awesome especially with the broom maintenance kits. Those are going to be fucking CUTE as hell. But don’t let George have any input on the packaging design or it will end up with big flashing stars and neon pink and green something or something on it.
It wasn’t easy. But I stand by my opinion.
“Dinner time. The kids are hungry. Going to be a long day tomorrow.”
“I lived in a fucking cupboard for ten years. I didn’t have much. You kids had every advantage available to you, but I was determined not to have you grow up thinking that everything just came to you from thin air. Your Mum didn’t have a lot growing up either . . . . . One day my entire world turned upside down and I had money and magic. It was wonderful don’t get me wrong, but I was an abused child who had to learn how to navigate a whole new world. The only friend I’d had up until that point was the old lady down the street. My Uncle was an arsehole. Dud was a horrible spoiled rotten bully.”
Pantry is done. Clean as a bosuns whistle.
“Oh hell no.”
“Floating ice cream?”
“Are you going to pout?”
You know what? I actually will ask. She’s about to retire and this would be exactly the kind of challenge she’d be up for. And you KNOW she’ll put all of her energy into it.
“Merlin, Scarhead.”
“Just the one bedroom in the back off the kitchen. . . . . . When we were here I mostly crashed out on the porch. If it got too windy, that couch.”
“Would anyone care to explain?”
Next week we’re opening up #12 Grimmauld Place (If that doesn’t mean anything to you ask your Parents they know all about it) and then having a family meeting/dinner afterwards. Things will make more sense once we’ve had the meeting.
Draco!
“Answer the question, Godfather!”
AP= Albus Potter
“Ha! Okay I’ll keep that in mind. He seemed like a nice enough guy, just pretty forward. Okay I'll say he was creepy!”
Diagon Alley, London
“What am I supposed to do? Now RON wants one!”
@ Kesniton LMP
“Also, Miss Cam, Please have some light food and beverages prepared for everyone. We will all celebrate the opening of the Lodge today.”
“I think I’ll still have to pipe the edge. I want it to be deceptively simple though . . . I’d rather not have a border.”
Are you sure having “Harry Potter” and Al slinging hash at Reba’s is a good idea? That’s an open kitchen!
“I know! Looks like there were a few larger donations but a LOT of it is in small amounts. Just drop it in the box and it goes directly to the Children’s Society vault.”
I love you back and I love that you love that I love my fish.
Our next Legislation to consider is “Repealing Restrictions on Magical Children’s ability to Practice, Perform or be Educated in their abilities by a Parent, Guardian or Educator. Including, but not limited to Hogwarts Students and People under the age of 11.” Sorry about the long title, but what’s in the legislation is what’s on the tin.

Just being overprotective as usual. He was very nice. Just seemed too good to be true. I met Luna. She's pretty awesome.
Hermione was very happy to set it up for us.
“Pansy and George?”
“Many times today, Scarhead.”
“Everything okay? I’ve got you on speaker. Draco’s here.”
Mother. Harry and I were both preoccupied with other issues today. Issues concerning his inheritance acceptance at Gringotts. The fitting or whatever it really was, that was just the icing on the cake. We barely said a word to the kids while we were there. And let me say that Pansy really put on a show.
“I’ll take them off of your hands.”
Please sign the agreement, place it in the enclosed return envelope, seal and return to:
Like that!
——————————————————————————
. . . . . . . .
“No? Should I?”
“Other than that. . . .oh Hi, this is my nephew Hugo. I’m going to meet with him and Grayson for a few minutes and after that I’d like to take a few minutes with Cibly to show her the conservatory. Zebb and Mr. Trandy are going to give everyone a tour of the house? Also eat some more of this food! Take some home with you tonight please. We don’t like wasting food. Is that enough Zebb?”
“You’re not going to do that. . . . . Ugh. . . . .Okay, you want some truth?”
“I remember you having the tattoo. But barely. And, yes I know what it was and why. We’ve been all through that. You don’t need to tell me about it again.”
“And yet, we’ve never been able to figure out why you need to speak parsel to the locks to open the lab gate.”
What do you want?!?
“It looks like you before you started working out. A thin version of you without the eyewear.”
“Hey Decram! If I call you to the snowflake where do you go?”
Yeah. Okay you know I love you back too just as much.
“It is.”
“Lily is definitely not interested in the china.”
. . . . . . . . . .
Liar.
Are you available?
“I’m not even going to try to translate. But that muggle phone company is worse than a money sucking vampire. No No NO.”
“And you’re all going to stay the entire time?”
“You, Al, Aspen, Jon, Davey and even Decram. It’s starting to look like a full family tradition. And Al & Scorp will have another on the way soon enough.”
“That would be nice.”
Our informant showed up at our offices covered in boils! We sent her immediately to St. Mungo’s for treatment where she was informed that the “consequences charm” she agreed to in a confidentiality agreement meant the the condition cannot be reversed for at least 18 days!
“Let it go.”
—————————————————————————
It was quite bad. Actually.
“Yeah. Your Uncle Al came home to be with Grampa almost every Sunday.”
“How do you know all of this?”
When I’m not living here there’s not going to be a lot to do other than basic cleaning charms. No one touches the lab but me and Scorp. I’ll have Trandy come over once every couple of weeks just to check things? Sean isn’t messy.
“What now?”
“We really did. You’ll love it. Shay even fixed our storage. I’ll show you later.”
“We definitely think so too. Thank you.”
“Trandy has been teaching me down in his kitchen.”
——————————————————————————
“I gave Louis access to all of my family photos. He chose them, had them reproduced in this format and framed. . . . . . On the far back wall is some of the kids art. . . . . the centre table display is my doodles for the Harpies Centre and the architectural drawings. . . . . .
“I can’t believe you, Draco.”
“It’s my HAIR, Scarhead. It does not look good in magenta.”
Yeah. I will. You’re going to read it all right???!!!
“Your friend?”
Look at the time Potter! I’ve got some calls to make.
“We SO can. And we did.”
Okay.
“Merlin.”
Not MUCH. Don’t lie to me I’ll tell your Granddaughter.
“Lights! COOL!”
“You will want to have that looked into.”
Midweek! Hope you're having a good one.
“Still room for croquet when you want it. We’ll set it up to play around the sculpture base.”
“Here you go. . . . ”
Who’s on our final list?
“Please send for Lin and Thom to join us. Tell them I would never get upset about something as trivial as soiled clothes. I’ll probably end up all muddy myself at some point . . . . Let them know that we want them here to join us in celebration and that the uniform is not necessary.”
12 Grimmauld Place
Any more accidents?
——————————————————————————
I do not need to hear about my father and naked antics again. Ever!
Unnecessary. We take notes.
I have a better idea.
I can be at Hogwarts on Sunday and give a classroom visit if you’d like?
How did I not know this? I know she paints but MESSY? Narcissa?
Okay.
Thank You SO MUCH.
“We’re making Turkish coffee.”
. . . . . . . . .
It’s fine. Okay sweetheart, are you a little better now?
“So the bed has just been changed out with new linens and pillows. None of this furniture has ever been used. I like the dark blue comforter. There’s a closet and a dresser. The radio is another Draco addition. If you’d like something different let us know? I know I’m pretty particular when it comes to pillows.”
“I totally get it. I love you Zebb.”
Like what?
Snape didn’t want me to have it because my Father could get his hands on it. A valid reason.
“Top us all off then.”
Did I mention that Mr. Zabini is gorgeous? And that this has the added advantage of
Shite.
“I’m okay. Just enjoying the aftermath? Really just enjoying visiting with people.”
Not a good idea. Dragon snack! But I’ll bet Winnifred can hang out with Mr. Jordan and Snaab. She’s a smart owl, just tell her to go find Mr. J. She’s got Draco’s biscotti to share.
“I will follow the chart to the letter. I promise.”

“Absolutely not. Is it uncomfortable?”
Teams.
“Oh come on. It will be fun!”
This concluded our interview!
“UGH.”
Oh Good. I’m glad to hear it. Try to keep your comments to a minimum. My office Floo. Still 17:00.
And you don’t see anything unusual about this report?
“I’ll work on Decram’s room next door while you do the TV in here and then we’ll switch?”
Molly and I would like our Grandson to give us a tour?
And you’re not upset?
“Yeah. You think I’d give up the chance to light off fireworks? Who are you and what did you do with Harry Potter?”
Your Grandparent’s things would make the exhibit more relevant. The wands of your Parent’s are important because it tells a story and fills in a gap. You don’t have much where it concerns them. We will always stay away from anything to do with your Aunt and Uncle. I will promise you that.
“Mr. Trandy, I’d like some of your special cognac please.”
He definitely would love to do it. The boys will have an awesome outdoor space when he's done too. Then you can have a rooftop garden party for the birthday and watch the parade. DONE.  Just give him and his crew access. He'll make sure the building is stabilized too.
“That one says it’s supposed to be a ballroom. But that’s a joke, take a look.”
With white gloves and a preservation charm! You better bet I’m going to. You know those books are said to be legendary.
Lucy's first day has finally come.
OMFG.
“UGH! I HATE THIS! How did I not know this?”
“Antoinette Marchand. . . . . She
“HA! Draco would love to hear you play sometime. And please feel free to use the piano any time you’d like. I mean it. I love music. This is really a beautiful composition. You should name it.”
Ask the Headmistress and incoming Headmaster to come up with something? Propose something.
Why would you want to do that? Hogwarts belongs to everybody! Malkin’s already has permission from the ministry to produce those things.
Hey Sean. I need you to add three people to the event list.
“The carpet runner is different on this set and it’s no longer curved. Still pretty though. Cabbage roses and look, snakes!”
Muggle kids and their Mum. Selling biscuits for a hiking club. I’ll explain later.
“AZKABAN IS TOO GOOD FOR THE FUCK!”
We have hired a team of fact checkers to scrutinize every article written prior to publication. This policy begins immediately. Ms. Waters is dedicated to journalistic integrity and is an award winning journalist in her own right. She is bringing in many of her own staff with many years of experience. Today begins with five new journalists and three full time photographers that she has hand selected from throughout the Wizarding publishing industry. You may see a change in tone.
Heraald (Harry) James Potter (primary account) - account claimed/active with withdrawals. The profits from landlord activity are deposited into this account. Deposit is currently held at 84.7% (reviewed annually) with the remainder held for maintenance and management of the Grimmauld Complex (see below) at (15.5%). Gringotts retains 0.2%.

EWWWWWWWW! ROSE! Just NO!
OMG. That’s sweet.
Potter Cottage(Fidelius)
Would that be okay with you?
“I know, you even smiled a few times.”
“Are you mad about the plants?”
Lucy’s IN!
No that’s fine. Glad to know you two are getting along. Just text me when you get there.
“Oh Merlin. I thought I did it bad or something.”
I know this is getting old, but we promised to wait until after Al and Scorpius’ wedding. I’m reminded that we need to do that interview with Luna.
“What the hell is that?!”
These boys need consistency. This is an urgent situation and I don’t want to upset them. I do have an alternative, but it would separate them. I’m doing everything in my power to avoid that.
They really are cool. If we went to the Isle I could drive you around the cliffs. Meet me out front in what? 10 minutes or so?
I’ve heard something but can’t confirm anything.
“Where’s your wand?”
“Lead the way, Scarhead.”
Wake up sunshine!
. . . . . . . . . .
“Understand this is all a business expense. I want my new assistant looking and feeling good. And Grayson you get what you like, not what you think I’d approve of okay? Hugo will use my muggle credit card.”
“Yes. Thank you.”
Owl post to :
“We’re all good.”
“Pretty sure he wouldn’t like my radio stations so I will not be recommending.”
No, you can never just brush off your importance, or whatever we call “the history” either. And you shouldn’t. But in general the public doesn’t know YOU. They don’t know that you’re this wonderful person with a huge heart. You’re so protective of your family that you’re constantly going to extremes, and that’s justified by the way. The press has been horrible to you since you were a child. They don’t know you at all.
What do you mean?
“It’s my turn to sit with Grampa Draco! Right here.”
“That’s LaCimbali.”
“Louis didn’t ask for much help. Just some suggestions for display case vendors and how to lay it out in sections. I’ve tried to stay out of it because this was your project together but . . . . Jeezuz Harry.”
“Yes, he’s been hounding me about it for a while. I’d already made up my mind by then anyhow. What on earth did you do to your hair.”
Apparently, Kreacher has been given the opportunity to break this magical bond on multiple occasions over the years and has always refused. UGH. Why did he never say anything about the heads? Now I’m mad. Not at Kreacher, just at how awful this is.
“My speciality. Here you go Mr. Jordy.”
No don’t go Rose. SUBJECT CHANGE Rosies pick!
“You changed the door?”
“Did you tell Zebb what they’re doing?”
“All the way through. Davey almost made it.”
“Okay.”
——————————————————————————
I don’t understand. Why is he focusing on criminal defense law?
Darwood and Becky are ones to look out for. They’ve both been training with Sarah.”
“It kind of is? Imagine the two of them driving those things around.”
“Okay.”
How about just us? Draco’s concentrating on some long string of numbers. Will be nice to just do just us for a change. Will Hermione be mad? Maybe they can join us later?
UGH. I've fixed a major inconsistency in this one. Let's just pretend that didn't happen.
Really? Just like that?!
I think I’m going to have to set up a small lab at the studio. It think I’ll be using this quite a bit.
“That’s a snake!”
“Decram! You’ve left your greeting post?”
“UGH! Jamie that isn’t helping.”
“He’s a good man.”
“Put on these pants and come with me. . . . . . . . .”
“Just adequate?!”
“So we’re here to help. Rose and I are taking you to Madam Malkin’s. First stop though? Olivanders.”
“So wait. How many backgrounds can he have in one place?”
“Where did they go?!”
“Yes. I have explicit permission to take you both anywhere you want. Would you like to meet my Nephew and his fiancé? Hugo will meet us and his fiancé Grayson will drive us down there? I’ve invited them to join us.”
“Sometime? Someday?”
“Yes, certainly I have one right here.”
“The Phantom II Continental. I would be pleased to show you how to fold down and store the soft top. There is a solid top conversion that can be used for this one. More appropriate.”
“Merlin.”
Are you all unpacked and settled?”
Coffee. With steamed milk and almond syrup?
LOL! Well Hugo’s no slouch himself They’re pretty cute together?
“You can choose a theme and just have them all match. Make it simple.”
“I assume it is a family business.”
But I’m reckless and intimidating!
“I know the spell, Draco.”
Edit: I made a couple of clarifying edits right after posting. UGH.
the patent anyway. The Department of Magical Transportation did. You just signed off on their approval.
I know. And people from faraway places. The gallery is busy too.

Let’s do that. When?
“Harry Potter lives at Number Twelve Grimmauld Place.” . . . .
Should I request another binder like they did at the Lodge?
. . . . . . . . . .
Albus and Scorpius will be in attendance.
“That’s not an outfit, Potter.”
“It’s on my list!”

“You’re under the influence of Mungo’s potions. Anything you say I will mostly disregard.”
“Grayson?”
It makes you a real person and not just a mystery. It gives you the opportunity to show who you are now and where you came from. That doesn’t mean that it still can’t be a fun experience. It’s just that certain things shouldn’t be avoided because they’re uncomfortable. Again though, Aunt and Uncle: Off Limits.
“You’re sure, Scarhead?”
“There is definitely a theme. . .at least it’s not cherubs!”
D & S: Front Courtyard installation.
“Absolutely. There’s like four mowers out in the shed. I’ll even let you choose the mowing attire. I’ve not done it once since we moved here because of the baby. I like doing it too. ”

Dean and Seamus can’t do it. Mr. Liogel either. They’re heading out right after they finish for Goblin Hurling. I’ll put it on the schedule. Want me to ask anyone else?
“The team coming is from Blackpool, I think. They’re good.”
“Ugh. It’s all black.”
Definitely. What about Ginny?

“Yes, Really.”
DAD is going to ride in the fucking parade????!!! He Loathes that kind of stuff.
“How is that productive?”
You don’t have to get me anything. I’ve got rings. Or how about something from the vaults? Would you rather have that? I could do that if they’re too simple?
“We’re having a staff dinner next week. In the snowflake. Zebb and Trandy arranged that.”
When the exhibit opens it will be free to the public. Donations will be accepted and all funds collected will benefit the Diagon Children’s Society. Soon you can come on down to Knockturn Alley to see Harry’s Junk and toss a galleon or two to a good cause.
Dud has hair questions.
“Because it’s Knockturn.”
“Because he knew I’d enjoy it. You’re not blind. It’s a wonderful view, and not just the front lawns. There’s nothing wrong with the appreciation of the male form, Scorp.”
UGH. You can’t be serious!
ATTACHMENT
Alright.
“Let me see. . . .oh yes that’s very impressive. It does match your eyes.”
“No I can do it. What should I look for?”
“I know!”
“Oh fuck. . . . you’re right.”
“Coffee!”
“We’ll make a bigger splash this way too. Are you ready?”
It’s actually okay. They’re being polite for the most part. Poor Grayson and Hugo weren’t having the best time at first but that’s another story. Most of the family is down here.
Hope you have a great week!
“That’s why she’s drooling like an aged kneazle. She’s got another tooth coming in.”

People are arriving now. This is hilarious.
Well, I figured that since we’re here at the Harpies Centre I thought I’d ask what it’s like working here and what your plans are for the future?
“What the fuck? Alexandrite collection?”
“Why?”
What about the rest of her office?
Draco are you okay?”
True. Hey I need you to come to Wales. Draco too.

I know you do. Not a bad idea huh?
“So if we come out here it’s like another courtyard garden. It looks like it runs the whole length of the house and wraps around the side on the end. . . . That's pretty much it. The whole function is just for enjoyment. The ironwork railing is interesting. The slate pavers are a nice touch. The cast iron planters are very nice too.”
“And now there’s a new baby coming and I’m going to be busy. I can’t run around behind you cleaning up your messes anymore.”
“Yes, it looks like I did quite a nice job. My kisses have left a constellation on your flawless skin. It’s some of my best work!”
“It’s going to have to happen sometime. Right now it’s up against a wall in the powder room.”
“Feels like I was. . . . . .but yeah, I know . . . . . not on purpose.”
I’m worrying. A lot.
Just make sure he’ll be able to work PDF files. Get him the current photoshop too AND some games.

Train room with the boys. Jack and Bob + Parents.
I haven’t quite settled on that yet. Can they be spelled on at the last minute?
“Careful they’re HOT. Use a cooling charm on them. . . . . . “•” . . . . . pull out the skewer. . . . . . perfect teething biscuits and you can throw the crust out in the yard for the birds.”
Awesome. They gave me a WAND.

That she’s engaged or that she’s going to take the Hogwarts position?!
Absolutely not mad!!
“We could stage a game show for Trandy. For fun at one of the dinners or something. Ginny could host the questions and he goes up against . . . . . I don’t know . . . . . Zebb and Decram.”
“That thing?”

“I was feeding Charles and Frankie the new bugs.”
“UGH! Stop asking!”
Let me tell you who else comes into the equation?
“Come on in. . . . . we need Ogden’s.”

What goes into hiring a staff for Grimmauld Place?
CLEAN SWEEP EDITION!
Hex Fest is GO.
“How? She broke the statute?”
“Well this is a nice open space.”
OMG you guys we had dinner with them and they’re so nice. Lucy is a total crackup.
Good! Hey Jamie wants me to do my thing could you look around for my wand?
“EXACTLY!”
This is going to take a lot of getting used to.
“There’s a shrinking and sticking charm to transport it if you want. Teddy knows those the best. . . . . You can put it in your trunk. Have you packed yet?”
”I’ve had the cruciatus used on me, I can handle an electric shock.”
“Yes, Potter, it is. Merlin’s saggy bollocks, you’re thick.”
“I hadn’t ever thought of it that way. It’s poetic, actually.”
"Are you ready, Draco?"
"What feels wrong?"
He had a strong urge to confide in Potter, to tell him how he was feeling, but his nerves were getting the best of him.
“I’m just calling Ron and Hermione, besides your image was already ruined in the war, Malfoy.”
"Draco."
Harry hesitantly opened his eyes.
“That isn’t going to happen. I don’t think I’ve ever seen you this nervous before.”
Harry stared down at his left wrist, which was bound tightly together by magical ropes to Draco’s right wrist.
"Yes, Potter. I want you to-I want you to...I want you to fuck me. Long and hard. I want to watch your face when you come and I want to suck you off."
"Keep going, Harry, ah! Ah! Harry, ah please keep going, deeper! Deeper!"
Harry sighed, mentally doing the universal 'vegan eye roll'. Many of his co-workers had asked him this very question, but Draco never had.
“Are you just going to ignore them for three weeks, then?”
”Shut your eyes and hand me a towel,” He demanded.
"Yes, you did!” His voice was higher than normal, and his smile stretched from ear to ear.
“Go vegan. Stop eating animal products. Why did you make that decision?”
Draco huffed, looking back to Harry, “Fine. Only if you promise to get me coffee and frozen yogurt.”
“The ministry has already sent our luggage to the hotel and I’ve already spent hundreds of galleons on this trip. We kind of have to go now.”
“Since when are you a vegan?”
“Am I that insufferable?”
“We aren’t children,” Draco added.
“Fuck off, Potter! Yes, you are! We’re stuck together at the goddamn wrist if you’ve forgotten already!”
He instantly noticed Draco’s lean frame.
”Why can’t you just use a cleansing charm as I do?”
“Oh fuck off and let me speak for once. Some other suggestions for adjectives you could have used are terrifying, the worst situation possible-“
“Okay...this is going to be strange and I’m extremely embarrassed to ask this of you, but would you hold my hand as we step through? Please?”
Draco sighed, clicking his tongue once again, “How exactly are we going to sit in one chair?”
They were unlatched, they weren't hooked anymore.
“I don’t want to. I’ll try to eat vegan with you, just for these three weeks. That’s it. Only because I empathize with you, and I think that your reason for being...the way you are is a bit justified.”
Their silence returned for about a minute before Malfoy spoke.
“Thank you for being an absolute fucking bitch, Mr.Potter. How could I ever repay you? I shall worship at your goddamn feet and polish your shoes until they are essentially a mirror with how reflective they shall become.”
Harry smiled, "I know you did. I was testing you. I love you, Draco."
Harry did indeed 'get over here', and the neighbors filed several noise complaints, which lead to the two of them booking a new hotel, where they continued their little 'secret'.
Draco grumbled, moving on toward the end of the food line.
The two of them headed out of the hotel room and entered the nearest elevator, heading down to the lobby.
This was odd. It seemed to go against the laws of science. These two men had been enemies since they were first years at Hogwarts, and they still did find one another to be horrible, but over the past two and a half weeks, they had grown much closer than they had been before.
“I’m not an Azkaban cell, Malfoy. This isn’t my fault. Maybe a vacation would be nice. Nobody we know would have to see us.”
“You know what I’m talking about, Potter. Don’t play dumb.”
“Sure. Are you ready now?” He asked, and Draco nodded, the blush brighter than ever.
“Shacklebolt, we aren’t going to fuck, you don’t need to continue.”
Harry hesitated for a second as a bright red blush grew on the otherwise pale man’s face, covering his cheeks, nose, and the tips of his ears.
Draco used his left hand to snatch the towel, struggling to wrap it around his waist. Once he had gotten the towel secured around himself, Draco opened the curtain and stepped out onto the white bath mat on the floor.
”Yes, but you can’t have frozen yogurt if you are going to remain vegan for me, and you can’t have coffee unless it is black. Of course, you could add soy milk and sugar, but I’m not sure if you’d want to try that.”
Harry blinked, being pulled from his daydream, ”What?”
Five nights later, lying in bed at 8 P.M, something was pressing on Draco Malfoy's mind.
”Alright.”
"I want you so bad. I don't know why, but I do. I can't say that I hate you anymore."
“We are not going to spend the next three weeks chained together in fucking Guatemala, Kingsley. I’d rather enjoy a vacation after I’m free from this bastard.”
“You would make the best out of it, Potter. I’m only going to avoid my friends and British society, and because you promised me coffee and frozen yogurt.”
Draco turned his gaze to Kingsley, clicking his tongue, “Wonderfully.”
“I’m not nauseous, the food just smells disgusting," Harry explained.
"Potter, don't tease me! Just do it, goddamnit!"
“Any more rules, Kingsley?” Asked Harry.
“Yes, don’t make me say it again. Just stop talking and eat your fried plantain.”
“That’s why I’m giving you the next three weeks off. Take a vacation. Go to Guatemala or something.”
Harry suppressed a gag as he sat upon Draco’s knee. This wasn’t something he’d ever imagined himself doing, and he was finding it to be a bit repulsive.
Draco took a bite of his ceviche, avoiding the question. Honestly, he did feel bad for Harry, and sort of wanted to push his meal away and stop eating it for the other man’s sake. He still had a grudge toward Potter, of course, he did, but they weren’t as hostile toward each other as they had been during their school days.
"Draco...our wrists...they're not tied together anymore."
Draco continued to eat his bowl of seafood, turning to Harry, “Why did you do it?”
“Potter, is this seriously what you consider unfortunate?
He then did the same for Draco, who didn't complain.
“We’re out to dinner, Potter. I’m in Barcelona with you for three fucking weeks and you are going to have to figure out how to eat vegan cuisine throughout that entire window of time, with me, a meat-eater, connected to you.”
“I guess not. Why is this so important?”
“Yes, like any sane person with a legacy to protect would.”
Draco rolled his eyes, pulling Harry closer toward the room which held the breakfast.
"Y-yes! Yes, just-just do it, Harry, do it-ah!", Draco yelled, far too loudly for a hotel room with walls as thin as these. Harry placed the tip of his cock inside of Draco's tight entrance, and Draco moaned in sync with Harry.
“I’m not nervous! I’m...concerned,” Draco shot back, though it was quite clear that he was lying based on the fact that he was rapidly tapping his foot against the floor and that his hands were shaking. Harry felt a twang of empathy settle within him. He felt the urge to squeeze Draco’s hand but fought against it because this was Malfoy and he wasn’t supposed to do that. He wasn’t supposed to care about how the blonde felt. He was supposed to act as though he had no feelings towards him. That was all he had done throughout their lives, the war and trial being an exception.
“You’re so fucking ridiculous. My arm is literally touching the shower curtain.”
Kingsley entered the room, shutting the door behind him.
He frowned slightly, looking back up at Draco.
Harry leaned forward just a bit more and closed the distance between the two of them. Draco was shocked but fought his instinct to pull back and melted into the kiss.
Draco sniffled, swinging his legs over the side of the bed and standing up, pulling Harry’s arm with him.
"What are you thinking about?"
“Draco!”
For the past three days, Draco had decided to shower in the morning rather than using the cleansing charm that Harry had opted for, and had forced Harry to sit on the toilet with the shower curtain closed so that he couldn't see him at all.
Harry thrust himself inside fully, and Draco squealed in pure pleasure. He'd done this before, been fucked in the ass, but Harry was by far the biggest he'd ever had. It felt amazing. The feeling of being full engulfed him, it was good, and he wanted more.
“For what?” Harry inquired.
Thoughts of the man lying beside him had been consistently pressing on him for the last hour, and none of those thoughts would be considered 'holy' or 'honorable' by those muggle conservatives, or by his parents.
"He did say that would happen..."
"You really think I'd do that? I forgot that we'd be separated up until now!"
”You’re ridiculous, Malfoy.”
”You know what Kingsley said. He told us we would get shocked if we hurt each other," Harry reminded him, staring at the hotel-room carpet and not meeting his grey eyes.
”I’ve seen you do it. Back our eighth-year. Just casual things, like unlocking doors and summoning things. I was surprised you even decided to come back for a re-do year, considering how good you'd gotten.”
Their table’s waitress strutted over to the group, a wide smile on her face, “Can I get you the check, or are you looking at ordering anything else this evening?”
Suddenly Harry found himself to be very distressed. Sure, this assignment was strange and he was less than happy about it, but he hadn’t yet thought of the more intimate side of things.
“We’re not women, Draco. The patriarchy has nothing to do with this.”
“Goddamnit, Potter, did you see my fucking cock?”
”Can you cast a drying charm on me?”
Draco groaned to himself for the thousandth time as Ron began to speak again.
A bright pink blush grew on Draco’s cheeks and spread up to the points of his ears and to the sides of his pale neck.
"Yes," Harry chuckled, "Although, you really don't have anything to complain about in that department."
He grabbed a plate, as did Harry, and reached for the platter of watery eggs.
"Just spell me, just use magic."
“Did you just call me attractive, Potter?”
Harry stood up from where he was sitting on the toilet, reaching over and grabbing a blue towel from the metal rack that hung on the wall. He looked away from the shower curtain and closed his eyes, shoving the towel through a small gap in the curtain.
His breathing pattern was shaky and rough, and Draco's was coming in quick and short puffs of air.
"I always have."
He started to pick up a rhythm of thrusting in and out.
“Why?”
“You’re not an ex-death eater, you were forced into that-”
Suddenly it was their turn to step through the green flames, and when Harry stepped forward Draco did not.
“Draco quit. You’re an adult, as you seem eager to prove to me, start acting like one,” Kingsley chastised.
Draco ran a hand through his wet hair, water droplets splashing quietly onto the floor. Trails of water made their way down his slender neck, all the way down to his navel.
“Horrible, the end of the world, the patriarchy at its finest-“
”Did you just use my first name?” Draco asked with a faint smile.
Harry’s previous blush returned, though he didn't deny his ability to perform magic wandlessly.
"I want you too. I know it feels wrong, it does for me too. I just...I can't even begin to explain how I feel about you, Draco. I don't even understand how I feel."
“You could say so. Sorry for that dump of information, I don’t need to spill out my grievances onto you. Go ahead, eat your meal.”
"You didn't just have sex with me so this would happen, right, Malfoy?"
“Rules? What kind of rules?” Draco asked, raising an eyebrow in suspicion.
“You said you would try to eat fully vegan for the next three weeks with me.”
"Fuck, you're taking too long," Harry sighed out. He waved his hand in the air, muttering a spell, and his clothes were then gone and on the hotel carpet.
Harry swallowed a lump in his throat and began to cautiously intertwine his fingers with Malfoy's. Draco did not dare look at Harry, though he could feel Harry's eyes burning hot holes in the side of his head. He continued to stare at the plain white ceiling, allowing their fingers to link together.
Harry smirked, trying not to laugh, “Well, Malfoy, I did. It’s just about as thick as you say I am.”
“Potter, are you fucking stupid? Magic, we’re wizards! You seem to always fucking forget that!”
“Right, sorry,” Harry mumbled back. Bright sunlight was shining through the window on the far end of the room and giving Harry a dull headache.
“You didn’t see anything, did you?” Draco asked yet again. He had been asking this question at least once a day since it had happened.
“Well, you’re fit. Good-looking. Your smirk is really quite attractive, and you have a nice person-” Harry said in spite of himself, hardly realizing that he wasn't just thinking.
"You want me t-to...", Harry stuttered, a hot flush covering his face as he became increasingly flustered.
Harry stayed silent, taking in this bout of information. He had known about Voldemort staying in the Malfoy Manor, and he had been quite aware of the torture that his followers had suffered, but he hadn't ever considered the idea of Draco himself going through that. He gradually shook his head and ran his free hand through his messy brown curls.
”Shut up, ” Harry mumbled.
“What, really? How the fuck are you a virgin, Malfoy?”
He kissed back, pressing his lips against Harry's. This was magical. His stomach was in knots and his thoughts were scrambled. Draco brought his hand up and placed his palm on Harry's hip. Their hands, those which were linked by the wrist, intertwined more than they had been before. Harry squeezed Draco's hand and brought his free hand up to Draco's head. He ran his fingers tenderly through the soft, pale blonde hair.
Harry pulled back, and then sharply thrust back in again. He moaned as he did so, and felt Draco's inners walls tighten around him.
“Close your eyes, you idiot!” Draco yelled, scrambling to keep himself modest.
“This is your punishment, you know,” He said, his grin widening.
It had been three days since the towel incident, and neither Harry nor Draco had bothered to bring it up.
Harry sighed. He couldn't stop thinking about that morning when Draco had stepped out of the shower. His platinum skin and bright blonde hair had looked stunning as the clear drops of water streamed down and onto the floor below. The image was ingrained into Harry’s mind, and it seemed to be the only thing he could focus on.
Harry did as he was told, fighting back a wide grin. It felt good to have somebody else feel bad for him for once. He had always been the person that people used as their crutch. He was titled as being strong, brave, and fearless. Nobody had to care about his issues, no matter how small they were, because he was the Chosen One and he was able to overcome anything.
"I just can't stop thinking about you, Draco. You've been on my mind."
”I’m sorry?”
"We're done being sappy now. Get over here, I still want to suck your dick."
Harry stared at the ceiling, fighting the urge to stare.
“Rule number three, learn to tolerate each other. If you don’t, this continues for an extra week.”
“Is this seriously all I can eat? Fruit?”
Draco suppressed another groan, running his sweaty palm down his pale face and exclaiming, “I didn’t ask for your opinion, I asked if you saw it!”
“I can’t tell if you feel bad for me, or if you’re seeing this as an inconvenience.”
“You can let go now.”
The water ran for five more minutes before Draco turned it off.
going out to dinner with Weasley and Granger.”
Harry broke the sharp silence with one word.
Harry stared down at Draco's large, pleading and blue eyes.
The sharp silence returned as Draco's porcelain cheeks obtained a pink tint, as they often did these days.
“Well...this is unfortunate.”
Harry’s face lit up, hugging Draco quickly before immediately pulling away, a faint pink blush forming across his cheeks and nose. He chuckled nervously. Draco leaned back a bit, his mouth was wide open and eyes wide.
“It’s going to be fine. I promise.”
“See...what?”
”Magic isn’t the same thing as showering, Potter. I could be forcing you in the shower with me. Be grateful.”
"I'm thinking about you, too, Draco."
The line was moving steadily, and Draco’s heart was racing.
”When did I ever promise you anything?”
“Yes! You did!”
to see Malfoy stark naked but having his arm stretched out in the air, occasionally being tugged by Malfoy’s movement, for twenty minutes at a time wasn't the most comfortable thing in the world.
”You can open your eyes now if you like.”
"Shh, be patient. I have to lube you up first, Malfoy," Draco felt his stomach clench as his hard cock throbbed. He needed this. He wanted this.
Perhaps it’s time to revise the list. It has been a very long time.
“Shite.”
“See you in an hour.”
Uncle Harry, I’ve already turned them off for you. Whenever someone adds something to the room they get a noise on their phone or computer.

“A toad is a fine choice. We’ll pass through the great hall on the way to the infirmary. Shall we?”
“Of course they will!”
The one your Mum put on Ron is different. He can’t talk about it to anyone, including your Mum and Me! It’s a little harsh. But also includes a couple other things he’s promised not to tell about. But you know your dad Hugo.
Tomorrow we switch. You’re making sandwiches and help prep, I’m doing the fish and chips. Ruby and Zebb will back up with the rest?
You are going to love this job Hugo!
This is going to be a 3 part thing. I'll break it up with some other fluff between.
I mean you can ask, but I’m pretty sure they’ll do it without a request.

“I look like a ten year old with horrible fringe! I swear that barber in Maughold put an imaginary bowl on my head and just cut around it! He had a vendetta against my hair! I think that was almost the worst day of my life! My Mum thought it was cute. Ugh.”

“I’m fucking exhausted. I swear if I ever see another fish filet I’ll kill myself.”
Where are you Scarhead????
Not even you can get away with that.
UGH. JUST FUCKING STUPID.
“We’ll have to make sure the owls are off the roof of the boutique before they set those off . . . . . And you’d better talk to Jay or someone about getting help with traffic flow. There’s going to be a crowd.”
“Are you the chaperone?”
“Anytime. . . . Cib is helping with them too. Grayson brought his Mum and Pops up here earlier. They checked things out. They have a special food. At least I don’t have to feed them rats or rabbits . . . . . they will eat them if they go out hunting. They’re trained not to bring dead things back into the roost.”
“This is the only area where I’ve magicked the lawn. Just in this enclosed area, the lawn never needs cutting and won’t show any wear. It’s also permanently cushioned so kids can’t hurt themselves with a fall, but not so much that you notice it. It only really activates when a kid falls off the swing or something.”
“Ugh. You did it again.”
“Thank you again. After people have eaten the early meal, we’ll have these tables moved off to the sides.”
“Meeting in three hours. I will bring the three moving in two, and the others in three through the floo.”

If anyone even tries, we’ll sue the fuck out of them. Those jumpers are art. I’ll get the lawyers on that immediately. Molly will own her patent and trademark. We’ll patent her knitting and finishing spells.

“Sweetheart.”
I need advice.
“Did you check your phone? We’ll do lunch quick at the C&C and then head to Dad’s? They want us to meet them in the park. Lucy’s Lemonade is on the menu!”

“I know. . . . . . I asked Louis to try to concentrate most of it into this one section. I figure this is the stuff most people are originally going to come to see.”
“You’re still a Malfoy.”
I see. Where would you suggest?
“YES!”
Yeah true. So it’s cool I guess. And I wouldn’t talk. Your Dad was in maroon velvet!
The property transfer of the cottage is a simple transaction since there are no moneys exchanged. I will arrange the paperwork for the transfer and renaming. All you will need to do for this is sign.
“Only in private and don’t you dare tell anyone else.”
“WHY?”
“Done. Is there anything else you’d like to tell us about before we come?”
Go ahead. It’s not a secret.

I know! That was a lot of fun. I’m excited to be here today. I’ve got questions mister!
“Alright I’ll just test it.”
You own clothes.
Suprisingly I’m not. I’ve got Zebb helping. She’s got most of my office packed up and ready to go. I’m pretty much down to just the personal stuff I want to keep.
Very nicely executed. I score it with seven points.
Just a sec.
“Of course.”
Yes Sir.
“Of course you did. The whole seer thing?”

This is our last vote of the session. All in favour please raise your hands. . . . . . . All who oppose the Legislation, please give us your votes . . . . . . . I’m very pleased to tell Clerk Frederika that “The Muggleborn Education, Parental Consultation and Hogwarts Reformation Act.”, the final vote of our session, has passed with unanimous support.
I’ll do that.
Dad have you seen these northern lights before?
“Too flashy maybe. Look at this one though. Oh merlin. It’s the colour of ruby port.”
“I don’t understand.”
“Nonsense. I’ll keep it stocked for emergencies. You will key me into the wards.”
“This one you should like. . . . it’s more natural looking, it’s called Seagull.”
That was quick.
“What?”
“Eight by ten, INCHES. That's my husbands preferred format. . . . . with a white border. Matte finish. All of them. Even the ones that didn’t make it into the magazine.”
Scorp thinks that I need a new conditioner. Says the potions have made my hair too soft.

Harry may I ask for some assistance?
“Go Dad!”
“My parents and sister, you’ve met at the bakery.”
“Goblins. Welsh Goblin sales staff.”
“Harry, you know what this is don’t you?”
“Hey Draco!”
Owl post to :
“You need the spare bedrooms for babysitting.”
I know. Tell me about this beautiful park.
Okay. Be right up.
“So now, it’s my turn to ask you an embarrassing question while we gaze upon our hard working husbands.”
That’s not bad. I’ll finish up here and be over at around 13:00 then?
Of course.
Of course I do.
What about hardware?
With your permission, we will issue a press release as the time comes closer.
I’ll have to admit that it was a little disconcerting to have the Minister come into my study and crawl under my desk to set this up.
“Miss Parks.”
“UGH. You didn’t have my morning. Al tricked me. It was horrifying.”
“That’s an INCANTATION?!”
7. Don’t (
Okay I get it. I’m not going to be apposed to anything, I’ll just have questions. What else do you want to look at?
That's it for the weekend.
“Now what time is it?!”
Ginny was up there going barmy over Jerry’s protection spells. Up there with her broom and trying to throw herself off the roof testing them.

You do. You were playing it at the dinner in the kitchen. The Docile Gazelle or something.
Oh dear. Well it could be, but it would be quite an undertaking. You’ve seen it.
Nothing, I just want that photo!
I figure we will give the boys photo examples so they can decide if it works for them. This is so much better than just surprising them with it at the wedding. Which I know could have been fun, but this is more practical.
Dean and Seamus already have the crew at the Manor. That’s going to take a while. Have to think about it then.
Hello Grayson!

“What did you do?”
“Here’s the thing. We’re all individuals. Just embrace who you are and don’t let anyone else tell you who you should be.”
I’m really not sure what just happened.
“You ready now?”
. . . . Don’t ever waste your magic trying to fit in with some notion of what other people are comfortable with. Sets a bad example.
“Wow.”
Ouch. No. And then through the freaking library? NO. This is more complicated than I thought.
Yes it seems like we did, Sorry. Feel free to join us. You know where we are?
Narcissa’s place is the height of subtlety in comparison. Cupid tables, cupids holding up the mantles, cupid doorknobs, cupid sconces, cupid candelabras, cupid stained glass windows, grand piano with cupids all over. Cupids embedded into all of the fucking furniture and upholstery. cupid cupid cupid. Here, have a cupid chamber pot next to the urinating cupid fountain.
I’m writing today to announce changes coming to The Daily Prophet.
Okay, food then nothing too pretentious. Just decent variety. I will be disappointed if there’s not at least a roasted boar with an apple in it’s mouth.
“The whole alley. Let’s all make a go of it?”
“I could do that with a wand.”
We didn’t say anything that we didn’t mean or that didn’t need to be said. Are you mad?
“Think about it though. Both down to earth, hard workers. Good hearted people. Been through hard times. And different enough to be good company for each other.”
“I got up early to bake the bread. Why would I do that? It’s fucking lunch in the kitchen. There’s nothing wrong with peanut butter and jelly. Who raised you people?”

I’ll head down early too, check on the boutique. Just a sec. BRB
Awwwwwww.
Even I know it's seat belts.
That should be fine? Luna?
——————————————————————————
“He’s doing it!”
So here’s a story:
“Just a little?”
—————————————————————
Did you decide on the countertops yet? Or the appliances?
“Harry, It’s part of your inheritance. It’s yours.”
“Yes . . . .Harry.”
Happy Tuesday!
Again. So weird.
Hold on. Let’s take a break and come back in say 30 minutes? Leave this open.
Harry’s enthusiasm is infectious, but you’re all getting caught up in it.
Stop teasing me!
Sure!
“How so?”
How long does the charm last?
“Oh fuck no.”
“Yes. The colours change as you walk but that’s the main background for the mural.”
“With what?”
“I figure we can get the basics of the store finished and tease customers with an opening date of 3 weeks from Saturday. We’ll have it looking nice by Monday then we can light it up with a notice on the door. In the interim you can have the production up and running and get those owl orders processed right away.”
What Now?
“It’s another snowflake?”
“Why laugh? You kissing Grampa Draco all the time.”
“Come on! It’s only temporary. One Day.”
Wave to us when you get up there! We’re on Rose and Hugo’s roof. You can probably see the fairy lights Rose strung up from there.
“Strategy. . . . . Draco had me half way through and he knew it! Three quarters of the way I knew I was totally fucked but still tried to figure a way out. . .
“We’re keeping that mint in pots. It will take over.”
"You want a shortish tour?”
Account Manager
Why don’t you go harass Jamie & Teddy about babies????
“No, it’s not that. I don’t care about the robe. That’s history. . . .You do realize that every fucking Hogwarts student alive is going to be down here to see thi . . . . .oh.”
Harry would never wear socks that awful. At least not monochromatic vertical stripes.
“What is it!!”
“. . . . . .
“I’m still putting you in jeans. How about this cotton shirt instead? It’s even got a collar and you can roll up the sleeves. This belt. Magenta shoes? No socks.”
“What!?”
Blaise. If you guys TOUCH that Hotel there will be CURSES AND JINXES!
Would that be okay?
No it’s a real mix. I think that’s what makes it so different to other portraits. I’m going to do some more tests. Its a combo of a dried potion embedded into the actual paint, an incantation on the paints. Then charms, a transfig on the frame and a personal ritual on the reverse side of the actual canvas. And that's just for Dec to be able to move into it. The part of the painting that is Dec himself is the big mystery.
What!?
Is it really happening that fast?
“When Minnie and Poppy get back from vacation and before school starts?”
“Not a bad idea as long as we can find a place that’s secure like the Clove was. Let’s see how the manor goes before we head down that road. If you can do that you get the two family properties shown in one day too. Scoot over you’re getting heavy.”
“Twelve?”
Mother, the man smelled of lilacs and dust.
“That isn’t motivation enough.”
“Alright. . . . . No shirt, completely toned upper body. He’s wearing cute green shorts and a little yellow cap . . . . really nice arse. Dark hair. Tan as hell . . . . .nice arms. Come look. . . . . nice thighs too, merlin . . . . . totally fit but not overly bulked up . . . . . Trainers are a little clunky, could be. . . . . . See? Totally my type. Looks a lot like you if you remove the hat.”
“You remember my sister Astra?”
. . . . . . . . . .
“Do it again.”
Lunch with the minister? Is Grayson freaking out?
——————————————————————————
“Yes. Just don’t question me and let Jamie have his surprises.”
Oh and the bathrooms. Draco says we can do a temporary magic fix for the family meeting. But we’re talking basically no plumbing at all. They hand pump water in the kitchens. Luckily we know someone who’s good at a quick magical fix.
“Like what?”
“That woman Melody? Tells the children that we’re brothers. Wanted me to pretend to be so that her child wouldn’t be exposed to the Gay. . . . .”
“Nope.”
(plus the news sucks today, so . . . .)
Can’t we just AK that cane?
So I’ll give Mr. Maeda your list. Remember he's eight hours ahead. He say’s he will accompany them and place them in the ponds. I’m warning you, the transport is not going to be inexpensive.

“Unbelievable.”
Thank Merlin.

“So cool.”
Of course?! Is something wrong?
I’ll explain later just please come with me. It’s going to be like muggle football kinda but with youthful Goblins and drinks.
“I wouldn’t want to get on their bad side, but no. Not wild at all. Carefully bred. Narcissa say’s these are all trained to be nice. If we want a snobby owl who’s all business and no interest interacting with anything they’ve got a couple of those, but not on purpose.”
“It’s ON, Potter.”
Grayson doesn’t like a mess! He’s staying for the chat tonight. If he stays over don’t give me grief. We’ll go back to his for breakfast, I’ll leave you coffee in the morning before we go.
Dad and Jerry are the worst by far, don’t kid yourselves. They should NOT be allowed to be in the same room together. And now Dad’s going to force us ALL to sing karaoke. Every damned holiday.

I personally think it’s a fantastic idea. I was worried you’d just sell it at some point. It's so big. Especially for just you.

I miss you too. I hope to come to London to see you. Maybe sometime next autumn? I could visit your Auntie Mae. I know that’s a long time away, but we don’t really get time off here. Cel and I are working to get an addition/enclosure completed for the puffin rescue.
“And?”
HUGO.GRAYSON.PRIVATE.CHAT
If it works Draco could have one in his office at the penthouse. They could do their textbook revisions. Decent change of scenery for him too.
“There she goes. Merlin you don’t think she saw us do you?”
Zebb is coming and she’s bringing Astra. What about Mr. T?
“You know it’s better. . . . .how do we get down to the beach from here?”
Alright I’ll get Hugo to help set it up.
The door?
Okay? Colors?
“It’s very Victorian. This is the guest level. There are 12 guest suites down there. I’ve been snooping.”
“The timing wasn’t right.”
“He loves it.”
I know! Scorp really can do it without me, but I’m still paranoid about it.
Crazy good!
Owl post to :
Dumbass brother. Dad is Dad but he's not that oblivious. Do you think Draco would go along with something so dumb?
Well that sounds nice. I’ve pretty much got everything under control so no worries. I’ll just fill you in on what’s going on in here over the course of the day today? There will be questions.
“Why do I need a crystal ball?”
“So, what do you suggest?”
“I just do.”
—————————————————————————
“A few strings. You can thank Dean and Seamus. They cleared their schedule. We just juggled a couple of projects around. And a LOT of MAGIC was involved.”
“Nobody wants to see mine.”
Andromeda Black-Tonks,
“I’ll give you a very brief tour just so you can look around today. I’ll answer any questions you have.”
“It used to be a paperclip, now it’s a driving hat.”
I’ll take care of it.
“On the second level are five bedroom suites that face the front and side facades. Again as you can see the west facade is open to the view of the ocean. The sunset views must be extraordinary. Above the expansions are not what you would normally consider to be an attic. That’s what it’s referred to in the reference material and architectural drawings. . . . it’s technically dual widow’s walks overlooking all angles of the property.”
Had a chance to walk the grounds a little. Just wow.
No. The goblins will be thrilled to have you there but they’re very respectful.
Start with the last resort first?
It’s better. We can have the wings attached once it’s in place. Also have you seen this place at night?
RE: @coffeecup
“Okay, I’ll lead.”
I did not say that. At least not in my official capacity.
Bill Delacour-Weasley,
Hmmm.
Would you do that? Maybe you could tell a story about some scandalous maiden in the ladies lounge?”
“Yes, well to begin. I believe we have all staff housing arranged. Manor staff will be advised next week and we’ll tour that property and assign tasks. Mr. and Mrs. Brick and Ms. Cibly and Ms. Keeley will tour their new quarters after this meeting, but will not be moving until next week. Monday for Cibly and Keeley. Wednesday for the Bricks’. Gringotts handles your payroll and you will each be assigned both a savings and withdrawal account. If you have any questions or concerns please contact my offices. That should be all from me to start.”
I am too. What they’re expecting is stuffy with 30 times the guests. This is really just going to be a relaxing stroll through the grounds and up to the atrium with friends and family. And then the reception and dinner. I've got the orchestras hired for the atrium and the ballroom.
“The only other thing you need to do is cancel anything we have for the weekend. Draco and I are going to Wales. . . . and you need to spend the rest of your week concentrating on your Ravenclaw reunion. Is it all set?”
“Are they useful books?”
“If you do that I’ll try to explain to Dec before I do it.”
I’m not. It will sell.
——————————————————————————
“Okay everybody. Just follow up the drive past the fountain and up the steps to the main entrance, then head through the main doors into the entry hall.”
“What the hell?”
“This has never been just a job for me Harry you know this. I will always take care of you no matter what. I may be moving on to the boys and a new baby but I will never abandon you. Do you understand? This staff has been selected with both you and Draco in mind. And yes, we chose them for you, but you always have the final decision.”
Yes, I’m good with it but no more until after the meeting. Except Ron. You should alter his vow so you can talk among yourselves. Hugo’s not going to want to keep this from his Dad.
Merlin. Miss Anna has set up what looks like a whole coffee shop in the dining hall. I think Al is going to want to come back here just for Miss Anna’s hot chocolate.
“I’ll go down and wait for the food. Where should we eat?”
“Looks like back up over the trees again.”
“It’s his natural skin tone. Same as Hansen. He doesn’t even sunbathe.”
YES! I’ve got leverage now!
“Would you be willing to let Teddy inspect your portrait? This sounds really familiar with another one we have at Grimmauld.”
Hi Rosie, Will you accept three seats and do it of your own free will?
“Woah.”
is even coming in to oversee the coverage (Does that mean 1/2 days at the school?).
I like them both. The one you kept would be good in the den. Maybe the nursery? In a light wood frame to go with the pine. White matte. I like the deep blue.
Oh yes! When I was packing up I was looking at the kitchen and all my seasoned pots and pans & stuff. I know I said I was going to just start over with new everything but I couldn’t.
I’ll live.
Let’s come back to order please. . . . . Minister Granger-Weasley I believe we have additional business that needs to be addressed today.
“So your phone. It really does still work, but only if it’s an emergency. Our dads can contact us if it has something to do with Aspen. That’s not Zebb, that’s me. . . . . .okay. . . . . .through here. . . . . . . .”
“Roughly 30 percent. They’re looking to be a little more than half done by tomorrow. Sure is a lot easier without the restrictions.”
I’ll be there at 6:00!
Henri Le Sidaner? This one’s larger too.”

I think I just died a little. It was a cute attack.

They will be. Don’t worry about that.
“Typical.
“I’ll wash, you dry.”
“Draco says whatever Zebb approves is final. Do you approve?”
OMG he will NOT stop talking about the baby. I have to work with him at the lab! WILL NOT STOP!
In order to accomplish this major work we know that this will be an inconvenience. We are asking all of our Muggle tenants to temporarily vacate their basement spaces. Non-exempt Muggle tenants will not have access to their basements for the duration. We ask you to please move ALL items from the back wall facing the park at least 2.5 meters. A combination of Linder and Goblin workers will be performing a ritual to restore the basements. You will be contacted by our scheduler at least one day in advance and the first process will take approximately 2 hours.
“How?”
“DAD! Hey DAD!”
“I don’t want to take it back. I see what you mean. . . .Am I in trouble now? I swear I don’t have favourites!”

“Well, it looks like your Grandmother certainly loved this place. . . . She took the trouble to have it cleaned and preserved under stasis. . . . I wonder why she closed it up after only 11 years though.”
“How?”
“Awesome!”
What?
What about the kids?
“No. You’re not wrong.”
“What about the op-ed for the Prophet?”
“I KNOW! I’ve got just the right thing for you. What do you have for me?”
She did.

My Grandmother again Hugo? Okay. You. Idiots. TTYL BYE.

“No.”

“Okay?”
No, it’s okay . . . Gin was honest with you and we all promised.
“I know!”
If you want to keep it simple? What does Davey love the most out of everything?

No. Different one for each kid. We’d have to decide what though.
Perfect. Thank you! Love you Dad!
“I haven’t been down here in quite a while.”
“Sure!”
8. Hardware:
I get it.

“You know something?”
Would you like to join us on our patio for some drinks? Dad and I have made lemonade. I can show you the spells I’m learning at school! They say it’s okay to practice in the park.
“Such a pretty night. Look at the moon.”
How’s the sorting hat today?
“But is it glass? It looks like Dean’s glass work on the downstairs enclosure.”
When?
Okay. Take your time and give us your thoughts.
I know how excited you all are.
I don’t see why not. There’s nothing dangerous there. It’s just really pretty right now.
“Shall I do a sweep and destroy the evidence of our afternoon?”
“Ha.”
“I’m sitting with Hagrid in the great hall. I can’t have green hair!”
“Thank you.”
That would be great.
“Yes that one.”
Try that?
Not many people are lucky enough to own an original Luna Lovegood-Longbottom. I love and cherish it.
They took the old lady away in handcuffs!
“Wow, that fireplace is huge.”
“I love you too Lils. . . . .so much. . . . . Now. . . . Lily Luna Potter. . . . .
Oh come on Lily. You HAVE to come. They’re going to start the remodel immediately. You’ll never get to see it otherwise. We haven’t seen you for months. Plus there’s a family meeting afterwards. Mum and Jerry will even be there. Dad say’s it’s important.
Fountains. Large public area fountains. His are usually out of metal and quite abstract. That's one of his out in front of the Centre at the entrance.
Because it's Monday after all.
All is in order.
I eventually had the robes and ashes buried in a wizards reliquary. There’s a plot at the Godric’s Hollow cemetery. A simple headstone marker there. Same as I did for your parents. I can show you if you want.
“Okay, and thank you for your vote of confidence.”

“Here you go. . . . . . . . . ”
They’re painting the outside of the pub next door. The Cat & Crown. It’s medium green with like a bronze (?) coloured trim. Not much of a change but all nice and clean looking. Looks like they’re washing the outside of the nightclub across the street. They’re cleaning things up all over the place.
Did you feed them sugar for breakfast?!
“This place is going to be a lot of work.”
Okay. So first thing. It’s about my and Draco’s wedding gift for Al & Scorp. You know the place in Oxford is a dump.
Mr. J. Liogell
Grayson can you please get Draco to check the wards on the house and then get my muggle money from the study and bring it to the reception parlour? Just the wallet. It's in the second drawer down on the right of my desk.
“It’s just family, they don’t care.
“Is everyone on board?”
Love you all. Good Night.
Breaking in the game room.
Just a little when it’s turquoise.
Ask away. I’ve got a question related to that as well.

If YOU win the battle. Hermione and I will take you and Harry to the museum of your choice and I’ll suffer. Followed by dinner and those floating drinks at the Copper Club.
“I know.”
You can do that? Like that thing you had on the cottage that threw me backwards that time?
I don’t understand the urgency, but go ahead.
I’m sure they must really love the dragons.

“That makes me glad. I like you too.”
“I want Grayson to have a space here so he doesn’t have to keep running back to his rooms for work. I have the perfect place.”
Regards,
“What is this part?”
“I went ahead and had it cleaned up a bit, but not too much. I know you didn't want it touched, but there were a few spots that were pretty bad. Everyone helped a little. Groy came in to do the fireplace. Did you want to leave the cauldron all rusted? I kind of like it.”
All properties (with the exception of Potter Cottage (current residence) and the Grimmauld Complex townhouses*) have been placed in an architectural stasis. Said properties are protected with under Fidelius and multiple wards administered and maintained by Gringotts and its affiliate branches. The Grimmauld Complex** is not under the Fidelius and continues to lease the 130 - four level townhouses both Magical and Muggle contained within the city parcel.

I have a list of questions on a clipboard! Look. Just like a proper correspondent.
No need to bring in extra staff for the party.
Ginny. I think she’s had a hand in it from the very beginning.
“It was a dream, Draco. I don’t come up with them. They just happen!”
“The Chinese looked interesting. Mr. Cheng?”
She would never leave the sanctuary.
Grampy? This is Albus.
Better question, tell my readers about the house.
Teach me to drive!
I’ll take care of it. Give that one at least a couple of weeks.
“Maybe we should go look at one of the old family properties in India.”
“It was a little. Narcissa just treated him like an old friend and giggled. Really giggled! And the students love him. Apparently He’s their go to person for history tutoring.
“You’re ridiculous.”
I can’t wait. Aspen’s kicking me.
What’s good for you? I need your opinion. Louis should be here later this afternoon, but I want you to see it first.
“But what if you’re not here and I want coffee.”
“Possible. His regular partner will be occupied tonight I think.”
My husband is in surgery tomorrow morning, so this is what I was going to post on Wednesday. Enjoy the early bonus? I'll try to post as usual on the weekend.
“In a few. Just sit here with me for a while. Take in the waterfall.”
And I'd like to key my Son-In-Law Teddy (Edward) Lupin into the manor wards and give him a direct floo. And give him access to any and all paperwork or documentation concening the manor.

“What on earth are you talking about?”
“I like that. What are you thinking?”
“Yes. I’m going to have a fundraiser in there and the big dining a couple times per year.”
“Something like that. It’s a little scary, but he always lands on his feet like a cat!”
I’m pretty sure if I show up to the “events” the cat’s going to be out of the bag!
“Alright then, we should be ready for them.”
“Can I tell Draco?!"
“AAAK don’t squeeze so hard I can’t breathe!”
We tied with Louis in the blanket fort competition. Trying to relax today. So what have you done so far?
Have you all looked at the photos?

You just promise me you keep letting him do it. . . . .Plus, I’ve got your measurements and I can send along some things I think would be good to Harry. Turn around . . . . .see you look more comfortable and relaxed than ever. And it’s your fucking wedding. Who would have thought Draco Malfoy would be caught dead in public in something other than a shirt and tie. Let alone at his wedding in a t-shirt with a soft jumper and the sleeves scrunched up to the elbows. Plus, I think it’s very endearing that you pick each others outfits.”
“I’m going to let you keep at it unless you’d like another hand, but I want you both to stop for a minute.”
“They’ll all be in a nice peaceful place later today. That makes me feel a little better.”
Of course.
“But I do! May I?”
Send them to the basket! You have magic for that Harry!
Al sets up the kids chat room for Harry.
“Yeah. So I really don’t want to know what you did, or are doing, but it did change.”
“Hmmm. . .NO. I’ll bet it did before though. We’ll have to have it looked at.”
Oh Thank Merlin.
If we get enough people coming I will reserve the big outdoor dining spot on the Colne. We can pick up at Henley’s and everyone can just meet us on the river? It’s small park just on the other side of the rail tracks and secluded.
——————————————————————————
The exhibits will be curated by Louis Delacour-Weasley. So we know the will be executed beautifully.
I really don’t know yet.
“I’m Davey, not mister. You’re silly.”
I’ll call an emergency merchant’s meeting. Can Teddy or Jamie call over the Diagon merchants? We’ll warn them and try to coordinate. Meet at the C&C. 18:00?
“Yes. I found out by mistake that it does. . .Well the rest of the kitchen still isn’t much to look at. Last priority really. Jerry’s the one who cooks mostly and he doesn’t care about it as long as the stove and oven works, but it’s a mess.”
Answer questions? First, when we change out the exhibits at the junk shop, I think I want them left intact with their cases. Is that possible?
“Can I unplug now?”
“Awesome!”
They do?
“Is this why you wouldn’t let us see the photo proofs, Gin?”
Hannah and I went to a movie. Lucy went to hang out with Lily and now her hair is green.
“Yes . . . .
“Please tell me if you’ve got any other issues like that? The conservatory is more of a personal project. I want to be more involved.”
“Nice hair. . . . I have healthy snacks, fruit, vegetables and sandwiches.”
“Coffee.”
Absolutely not. We’re just going to talk about whatever you’d like. No list of questions. You tell me what you want my readers to know about?
Yes they are waiting their turn for deliveries. They must be pleased with the accommodations. They’re a very proud breed. How is that working out?
“Thanks.”
“Draco, have a seat. . . . .”
Someday I'll want to do Snape.
“They brought Virgilio back but the new menu is . . . let’s say . . . different."
“She seems to be enjoying herself.”
“Okay.”
—————————————————————————
“I’d like to go slowly. I figure since the plants are protected, I’ll just put in maybe one type at a time. I figure it’s going to take at least a few weeks. Going to take my time and enjoy it."
“Draco, Louis and my assistant, Grayson. We’re still waiting for Edward.”
Ginny! Help us out!
“Nothing EVER ruins that silhouette, Weasel. . . .
A bit. But she was just as bad! And you know what it’s like when the two of us get going.
We didn’t do the second ritual.
Okay so I’ll come down and see you this afternoon.
“Of course.”
. . . . . . . . . .
You didn’t already ruin the surprise did you?????
The Wizengamot session is concluded.
“Exactly. But there’s a perfectly nice cafe on the corner that’s struggling because of that past. Owned by a wonderful woman and has a lovely menu. Knockturn has turned around but not enough. The nightlife is definitely an improvement, but on a day to day basis it’s still not a place people think of coming to. The pub on the right side doesn’t have day traffic.”
“Okay don’t go overboard. What was your original query, Potter?”
So you work on that. The next step is deciding how you want to do the Wizengamot transfer of seats. The configuration changed too when you gave the Prince Lordship. Draco holds one seat on his own.
Hungry? Nappy change?
“That’s what the card is for!”
Fuck. Promise you will NOT JUDGE ME.
“You always say that at first, and then you blow shite up or something.”
I’m here.
In my office, no classes today so this is good. Paperwork can wait.
“Did you like it?”
“Did I tell you how handsome you look in that outfit?”
Expand closets by approximately 75%.
“Well like I said, we’re a little ragtag. Iris is spending the day with Jamie and the boys. They’re making up a new sunflower guest room.”
It’s very complicated. You have to turn on the water.
“Probably not.”
“AWESOME! Draco, come over here. Through these doors.”
POTTER. You are not bringing chicken feet home!
"Nice hair, Scarhead!"
Most definitely. It looks like there will be no need to remove furnishings if you want them restored in this phase. The furnishings would only need to have existed on that date and not necessarily placed in any room or position. As long as they belonged to the home at the time they will remain intact. The only setback would be that anything purchased after the alterations that you want to retain will need to be removed.
This one is the best. . . . . the Bombett Brarrage Brocade! We’ll do that one last.”
I’ll do it you know. I really will.
Love it. Especially the cork. So cool. I’m glad I said okay to running the oak through the nursery too. The top two floors are going to look really nice all the same.
You mean they have been living in tiny elf quarters for 60 years?
“Shall I broadcast to the family chat that we’re trying to get pregnant?”
She printed it out for me at the frame shop. Did you look at the door?
They’re all pretty young. And fast as hell. It’s a lot of fun. I hope you enjoy it. I’ll tell Dean to keep an eye out for you? The place is pretty big but should be pretty easy to find you.
. . . . . . . . . .
“And don’t you ever stop reminding us. It doesn’t get old, Dad. We need to hear it.”
“I get it. Thanks for sharing that.”
Sorting hat says? . . . .Hufflepuff.
Do you like it?
OUCH.
“This is so weird.”
“It’s all white marble. Scorp that’s a photo of us in the great hall. What were we 14?”
——————————————————————————
Oh alright then. Case Closed.
Is Jaydne okay or does he need a muggle glamour?
“Dud, you have to admit it was pretty awesome.”
Okay Draco, we’re back on!
THAT’S JUST FUCKING CREEPY!!!
When Hugo and Grayson showed up people were asking to SMELL THEM.
There is a closet in the manor kitchen with servers uniforms. I’m not kidding.
Draco doesn’t mince words. It was awesome.
FUCKING AWESOME!
The ingredients or the records?
“Draco! There you are!”
Harry tests Jamie's Broom.
. Your mole should consider herself fortunate that the
Please let us know what’s going on!
How so?
Okay so basically put away anything that floats or looks suspicious.
“No kidding, geeeez!”
Yeah. It’s for the kids. But he’s going to be here in less than two hours!
“I think he’s on a walk with my Ted.”
It’s cute!
Did You see the Profit?
“It’s funny, Scorp! You’re perving on my DAD.”
“Shall I?”
I did think that I should partner with the historical society to maintain this property and open it for occasional events. It really is pretty bizarre. Unfortunately that approach turns out not to be practical as we found that much of the art and architecture is too rare and priceless. The protections on the manor have to remain in place until a time when it can be secured convincingly.
Is it too weird to say that I think he’s handsome?
LOL? Okay? WTF? Yes?
I need you to take me shopping. I want to make this cake right and pick out what I want.
. . . . . . . . well that’s interesting . . . . . . . very good . . . . . . . . not an issue . . . . . . . . Minnie, do you see what I see here? . . . . . . . . oh that’s lovely . . . . . . almost done . . . . . . “•” There . . . . . . Finished. Now, did that hurt?”
Edit: I took some stuff out, it's better now.
“Help me.”
“Element of surprise! ”
LOVE YOU.
“You asked for my assistance? I’ve been up all morning. I had breakfast with Mr. and Mrs. Brick at seven freaking AM! I went to see Mr. Liogell and went over the plan with him earlier. Did you know he starts his workday at SIX? That’s insane! You told me about your dinner plans? Draco has chosen your outfit . . . . . . . . . .?”
“Oh a mystery!”
Really?
Brooms take priority!!!!! Love you Bye!
“This couch is comfortable! Come and sit!”
POTTER.MALFOY.SECURE.CHAT
Eric and I call dibs on Magical Menagerie.
“That’s my dilemma, Minnie wants me to, but I kind of want to sit with Dud too.”
“But this is more permanent.”
I’ll be right up!
“Ridiculous.”
Wait. There’s one other thing.
“78rpm. These are ancient.”
“But you can show it off tomorrow without messing it up. The next day we’re moving into the guest room. You can cook while we hook up Trandy and Decram’s TV’s. We can have our first official dinner here in the kitchen then?”
JOKE! Those are all LIES.
“And I want you to go down to the wine cellar and pick out your favorite to go with a cheese platter and fruit thing I’m going to put together.”
“I’m supposed to meet with Neville and Al in the conservatory, THEN work out at the Centre with Hugo. THEN move Hugo to the penthouse. . . . . . but right now I just want to stay in bed. You’re warm. Can we just stay here?”
We will corrupt them with Karen Carpenter Karaoke. We’ll choose teams and have a duet competition.
Fathers (and “business partners”) Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy have been spotted meeting in a (notoriously trendy/muggle/wizard) cafe in London where our intrepid reporter observed the men huddled in secrecy.
No there’s a huge food fair before the match. You guys want Yellow or Purple? Hornets are yellow bats are purple.
“We do. Be there in ten.”
YET is the question at hand. Hugo, have you decided on a topic for your dissertation?
Love you more BYE!

Hey! The Harpies just got their shipment of the new brooms. Want to go down there with ours and give them a run for their galleons?

“I’m just a little smaller than most people. I eat plenty.”
“Don’t do that. There’s more to this than what you wrote us. And a little warning would have been good.”
“It’s complex to explain but imagine if you could sculpt or paint with air. It’s all a charm that I’ve imagined since I was a kid. Rather than the image being an extension of actual paint to canvass or paper, or a sculpture or whatever, you dream it.”
Not bad for our first meeting! Let me know what else I can do before we meet later?
“SHITE.
Because Dad will never be able to use the excuse that he just forgot about something. Now he’s got BACKUP.
So Grayson can practice driving it.
Someone had the foresight to recognize its importance and preserve it. We may never know who or why. Could have been a spouse or partner after his death.
“I was expecting it to be all dark and gloomy and messy. This is so organized.”
“Well you’re the one blushing now. . . . . It is quite lovely . . . . Merlin, Draco wasn’t messing around with that was he . . . .If you like this cut we can have it done in other colours. Do you like pink?”
“You taught all of your children to ride a broom here on the front field of this cottage. It’s nice to see you continue the tradition. Harry Malfoy-Potter, this one has what you call the gift. Be careful with it.”
Maybe it’s the haircut or something.”
“The Potion Masters Society is having a conference at the end of summer when you open the Snape exhibit. I’m going down to the Creepy Cauldron to check out the banquet rooms.”
Okay who loves you the second most?
DM me.
YES! I’ve been calculating the difference between Wizard and Muggle real estate prices most of the day. My brain could use a decent shift.

“Borgin and Burkes. That property is your personal nightmare. You’ve said it yourself. It’s been sitting there boarded up and empty for years now. You’ve purchased the property and let it deteriorate out of spite and anger.”
“You didn’t really work in the potions lab did you.”
“Thank You.”
Tell me about the birds?
“Ahh. . . . . . .Yes. . . . . Of course. I remember him well. Frank Chandler year 1984 . . . . . Ravenclaw! Your children will do well at Hogwarts I’m sure. . . . . . . . . . . ”
“Islington. Yes to the mousse and I have a tart coming. . .The place has been under architectural stasis since forever. . . .heavily warded. I’ve only been there once to sign some paperwork with a Goblin. Never even went inside . . .it’s big . . .really old and bizarre. At this point it’s warded so heavily that only myself and a Gringott’s rep can access the property but they want me to accept the Potter lordship to get inside. The kids know the place exists but they’ve never seen it or Grimmauld for that matter. Nobody ever really showed any interest or asked about them much before and Grimmauld is creepy. I mean really creepy Draco. Screaming paintings and wall of severed heads creepy."
WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK.
No. Daltrey is an arse.
“Awesome enough for this driving license?”
“I’m TYPING. LOOK!”
“When are you coming to Berlin?”
“Do you think people will want to come see it?”
Okay. Any other requests?
“Okay.”

“What’s that?”
They sent me an overview. 6 pages of gobbledegook! I’m still trying to weed through that. Draco understands it better than me.
Yes. And there will be northern lights sightings.
Al and Scorp drop their own bomb on the dads.
NO I’m not going to live here. COULD YOU IMAGINE? So that’s the main Jest/Prank. The other part is just not telling you about this place in advance. Draco and I are wearing things from Decram’s actual wardrobes. I have the portrait outfit. Decram chose the “Cherub Brocade” for Draco!
“No time for modesty, Dud. Just do it.”
We do the international portkey system to Vancouver. Muggle train tour is 14 days. We’ll travel through the Canadian Rockies. Then Toronto, Niagra, Montreal, Quebec. I’ll show you the specifics. I got the idea from Harry talking about his trains with Luna.
I’ve got a special grinder you can use to pulverize the ingredients too. It’s from China. They use it in pharmaceuticals.
“I birthed him, yes. It’s 90 percent possible the baby will take after the both of us. James and our daughter Lily were birthed by my former wife. That’s where the ginger hair comes from.”
Of course. We had a main tiered cake and four massive sheet cakes.
“HA! I’ll do my best!”
“You can update it later.”
“I love the brown leather. I’d love the lights. . . . What are those?”

Hi Harry.

“Give it a try.”
Grayson made a list. I just made a template and copied the names into it. Printed them out of heavy paper.

I like it. Wouldn’t that be just as effective for the order members?
Yeah. Okay in two days then.
He says I’m free. We’ve got extra help today, school purchases are ramping up.
“Put the phone away, It won’t work here.”
Ha! Zebb is going to put Pansy in her place!
Oh! Is there a theme?
“If anyone’s interested in espresso drinks to go with their dessert come with me to my kitchen downstairs. Would Bee like to come give me some tips?”

I’ll never forgive your parents for what they did . . . . . your Mother gets a small amount of sympathy from me because I think she was misguided and manipulated, but YOU? You didn’t know any better. You were a kid who was taught that shite. You aren’t that kid. Look at Lucy. She’s that wonderful little girl because of you. Let it go.”

You are receiving this notice because you have signed and agreed to the disclosure agreement with Hermione Granger-Weasley, Minister of Magic on behalf of Gringotts and Mr. Harry J. Potter.
I'm still going to update on both weekend days, but just one chapter instead of two. I'll add another chapter midweek (probably Wednesdays).
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAK.
“That would be nice, but that’s the old Borgin and Burkes. It’s the main reason most people don’t come down here.”
YES!!!
Ask her what exactly?
Horrible things. Not just bad.
That’s not what I meant, but I get your point. . . . .
Ron, it’s a little early.
I was like 17! Fucking BT.
“I’ve never seen anything like all this before, but you’ll do okay with it. It’s pretty! Show it to people? This poor yellow butterfly pin needs to be somewhere that’s not in this dark cave.”
It’s nearly nine. I’m about to open the shop.
Where are you, Scarhead?
Okay. I’m up for it.
Everyone always said he was so horrible. I’d only seen it once or twice when I was a kid. He was perfectly nice to me in private. Called my Mum a clodhopping shapeshifter, but then went on to say how great a person she was.
“You are not a teenager.”
Goodbye.
“Judo. . . .you know how he’s always jumping around and twirling about? Those are jujitsu exercises apparently.”
Kreacher.
“Dec, How many backgrounds do you have at the Manor that you can visit?”
“So what’s our next step after meeting up with Dean and the Elf kidnapper”
“UGH.”
You of all people know for a fact that your Wife doesn’t GAF about any of that. She cherishes the bracelet of braided Wiggentree leaves that you made more than any fucking jewelry we could give her. She prefers the necklace that Gareth and Danika made out of play-dough more than anything.
Alright, moving on again, tell our readers what you’ve been up to lately?
And don’t forget, Draco is the master of resizing charms if need be. Love you bye! Have some fun.

Wizengamot meetings last on average fifteen or twenty minutes. Just long enough so they can collect their stipends.
“Yes a combination of applied and then carved and hand painted. Around the wall of the ceiling is raised plaster. Looks like irregular vines creeping up into the ceiling. Notice there’s no abrupt corners as it flows up in a curve and then accented with what look like iris blossoms. The windows are all arched and pretty graceful.”
“You can garden year round in here.”
“. . . . . . .aaaaa”
“WOAH.”
“Oh. Here we go!”
Let’s make this a quick one it’s late.
Danika’s guest will be Phil (he’ll need a separate room).
Your Dad loves a surprise, so you don’t tell him in advance. Pick a day. Draco can get him up here without too much suspicion. Keep it just to you kids. Jamie and Teddy, Al and Scorp, Lily and Eric. Bring the grandkids of course. Jerry and I will host, but I’m not cooking. Figure out food amongst yourselves. It will be an overnight. The weather is sketchy, but mostly beautiful and mild this time of year. If it rains we'll just move everything inside. We don’t like weather altering here.
Oh alright already.
“Ginny may have used some intimidation tactics with the zoning commission, but we’ve decided not to talk about the details. I really don’t want to know.”
“Not truly. The hair makes the charms and protections more specific to the individual driver. You cannot be harmed, nor harm another while driving this vehicle.”

“Alright then here we go, Weasel. . . . .
“Brother?”
“Not sure ribbons?”
“I need the skelegrow for the foot still. I should wait.”
Me too.
No I was waiting to have the patent approved before approaching them about it. And I understand the importance of it. I want Ron and George to be in on the ground floor of this one.
“Yeah.”

What’s that?
It makes sense. I’m just a little dazed. You trust us all with this?

“Harry, do I have your permission to speak about this?”
Nothing’s wrong. I just miss you guys. It’s been two weeks since we’ve gotten together. I’ve been banned from work for a month. Aspen is lovely don’t get me wrong. I know everyone is trying to give us space, but just UGH!

I can agree. Liogell know’s pretty much everything. He can answer almost any question you have or guide you in the right direction.

No problem.

“Seamus Finnigan-Thomas. . . nice to meet you.”

“I was expecting at least half of this crap to disappear! That’s so disappointing!”

“I’m used to it. It’s fine. Jackson is
“Ferret.”
“I’m sorry, you must have an escort for this ride, you are below the height limit.”
If Grandma does that I’ll help at Reba’s too.
“Next time call me earlier.”
“What’s your room like?”
I’m going to propose that we keep the kitchen layout mostly the same. Change out all of the cabinets, countertops and appliances with new. Maybe move the sink to the centre island instead of along the wall in front of the window.
Did it work? Are you busy now? Can we talk?
“Dec! Say something.”
“I have a better idea.”
“The wallpaper is different.”
Secondly, we need another scent to go with the next exhibit at the junk shop.
I really do like him, Draco.
“What the? This is all my room?”
“I am.”
. . . . . . . . . .
So there’s this guy. I asked out to dinner.
“It’s Harry.”
Of course I am. And Ron has the warehouse up and running for the deliveries. He and George are going to move some Wheezes production and stock over here later in the week.
“Your hair is getting so long I didn’t see it.”
“Hey Decram, what’s up?”
“Cookey. That must be his wife and what. . . . 5 kids? Wow.”
In the interim I’m going to do so research into finding a solution to Kreacher’s issues.
Have some quick fluff. The weekend is going to be nerd heavy.
“And my Firebolt. And our uniforms. Louis put those in this morning.”
“I won’t fault you here, Billy. You did the right thing. You’ve been treating Harry for many years. He’s not had a clumsy injury in a long time now.”
“Get those trunks.”
The Wizengamot reconvenes.
“I brought your player if you want it.”
“Memorized with perfection! Come on I’m hungry!”
Harry makes some arrangements.
“Okay.”
“Bye.”
“I said no tears Potter. Have a seat.”
“This is just not right. I hate you!”
“No. It’s just. . . . . it means that it’s only a year until I have to go away and it seems like I just got here? I don’t want to leave you.”
Well it’s about time. Especially for Skeeter articles! Skeeter Jr. probably got tired of getting trolled every time.
“Later.”
“It’s like what you made for Jon and Davey . . . . .”

Got a minute? LET’S TALK CAKE!
“UGH! Go ahead then.”

Ted Please NO.
“You know what? I think Zebb has pretty much covered most things including how I take my TEA and blew my cover as a man of mystery, dammit . . . But I would like to say welcome. Sincerely. We’re all really happy to have you here. Harry calls this dining room “the snowflake”. I think it might be his favorite room in the house next to the conservatory, so pay special attention to keeping it clean . . .Harry?”
“Let’s go!”
PHOTO
Draco and I are remodeling/cleaning up Potter Cottage for Al & Scorp’s wedding present. It was originally meant to be a surprise but things went south so they know about it now.
“Don’t say sorry, no need.”
How’s that baby, Harry?!
You’re never going to let me live this down are you?
Done.
“Draco, I’ve been doing that for a million years.”
It’s a lot. Going to be expensive.
This is starting to make sense now. This is why my Dad wanted the soaps.
“This is why Lucy and I are always trying to do something at least educational. But it’s difficult. We do the public library a lot. She loves a good museum. Natural history too. Do you know these people don’t even believe the theory of evolution?”
The park that you’ve been viewing for the term of your tenancy is an extremely complex Goblin charm. I know! That’s crazy. But it’s going to be a lot of fun watching the work being done. It’s actually really spooky down there!
“Hi Dad.”
He does?
“Draco Malfoy drinking champagne out of a juice tumbler? The horror!”
“Please accept this as a personal favour to me and the Wizarding community.”
5. Final request. If at all possible please don’t write all of that disclaimer nonsense at the beginning of my correspondence any more? I understand how it works. Just give me the charm code please? Doesn’t your hand hurt having to write the same thing over every time?
“Looks to be pointillism. Potter, these aren’t bad.”
“Can’t remember. . . . .I think it’s parker or something. Maybe supposed to be jumping around in the park instead and not off the side of the owlery?”
I thought Al wanted to get out of the house?
. . . look at the snakes! . . . . .
BIG one. Arthur can set up his projector and screen in there? Just a thought.
LOUIS!!!!
Harry will dismiss the Supreme Mugwump and assign the new one into the position. Just briefly, The Mugwump is only replaced when one retires (or dies) or a new Chief is installed. The Chief is at the sole discretion to appoint who they want. With that I give the floor to Harry to explain.
“How do you keep grounded? How did you not let us all get caught up in the crazy? Because now both Teddy and I are in a position where we have such financial stability that we’re concerned that we’ll fuck things up with the boys.”
You’re crazy.
“Yes you will. It’s not your choice to make.”
Then it goes into the public record. Which is heavily monitored by the press.
Our Son is a shrewd businessman, Draco. Who knew?
Next up: Draco Malfoy.
“You knew all along?”
Love You Bye!
Don’t be. It’s going to be fine.
We’ll allow it.
“HA! Of course. . . . . But still . . .hands off missy!”
That will be good. But he does already have the officiant responsibility?
Did you find it?
Al is correct. The perfect ending to a perfect day.
Grayson demands that permission slip. Please?

I would like you to come to Grimmauld. You have to see it!
“Potions time? Let’s make the one that makes you all yellow!”
Will he be willing to do a confidentiality agreement?
I’m Hugo and I’ll be honest. I’ve pretty much just had a conversation with my Dad about this. He said I need to take this slow. I’m a lot gobsmacked because I like you so much. And not JUST as a friend. Does that answer your question?
“Is that a matching earring?”
Did you see the looks on those Goblins faces? You have them in your back pocket. You are their largest account holder. Pretty much just tell them what you want and they’ll do it without blinking. For a fee of course, but you know, vaults and all. So that’s not an issue. There are most likely former staff that are waiting not just in Iceland but most of those other properties that WANT to return to them.
It’s Your Fault that Mr. Jordan doesn’t care much for regular owl treats, so if you have one of your home-made biscotti around she’ll be ecstatic. . .also, she obviously needs exercise since the kids and I don’t use her for messages very often. Double WIN!
Mother wants to bring something.
I love YOU.
The vow similar to your Dads. This one is actually less restrictive cause your Dad can’t keep a freaking secret! You just can’t share what we’re going to talk about with anyone other than Me and Your Uncle Harry for now. I’ll consider adding your Sister because you don’t keep things from each other, but for now it’s just the three of us okay?
How can I? I keep thinking that the Dads are going to do something stupid like give us storefronts for a wedding gift.
“Oh. Harry, check the sink.”
“Do you understand what’s going on here?”
Okay. Love you TTYL
What is it?
“Well, her Great-Grandparents were magic. You know that.”
Right. I’m not complaining! If you just happen to come up with anything else let me know.
“7456?”
“If you really have those letters you can give them to Jay and he can match them up in the binders.”
That would be no.
“When did that happen?!"
Maybe.
What in Merlins name was that article supposed to be? It certainly was NOT an interview.
“No, not at all. One or two maybe. A couple will sting or bite if you don’t treat them with respect, but nothing we can’t handle.”
I’m going to introduce legislation. The following is what Harry decided on for the first session (with my additional notes):
Yes, I’ll come back and clean up before we head out. Find me an outfit?
She can’t talk with you about that specifically, just in generalizations. Confidentiality issue.
“Hmmmmmmm. . . . . .how about Ralph?”
OK I’ll try that.
“The pears look nice. . . . .what exactly is ground tofu?”
“But another core bond did exist. When I was doing the standard tests on Draco after another injury much earlier I think.”
Those are beautiful.
. . . . . . . . . .
—————————————————————————
“It is, and that’s good. At this point she can probably hear things. Have Scorp sing to her.”
Wow again! What’s it like?
“I love the white Louise Nevelson. Dining room? It would go nicely opposite Eric’s piece.”
“You’ve got to go to the Leaky. Grayson’s behind the bar pouring drinks and taking orders. Hannah had to get him a step stool. He’s having a good time.”
“That makes sense. So what’s next . . . . Closet. . .empty. . . . bathroom, this one’s big!”
Do I have your permission to share this and the original court documents and transcripts with Uncle Harry?
Dad’s going to make us sing karaoke isn’t he?
“YES. His ears are so fucking CUTE.”
“A few hours. If we need more time we can stall by texting the kids. They’re down there today. I figured once they’re done shopping for school they can take their time browsing Knockturn if we need more time?”
“No? I think I just understand what you meant to say when you touched my face like that?”
“I’ve chosen one of my favorites. It’s a silent spell, but very effective. Watch my wand work
“Thank you Zebb.”
Again?
“So pretty.”
——————————————————————————
“MERLIN"S WHISKERS!”
“Hmmmmmm . . . . .
(See the end of the chapter for
“And with the dry sense of humor it will be perfect for the kids.”
“That’s just not the case. He now has years of experience. . . . it’s just become second nature to him. Sometimes an artist not only thrives under the pressure of a deadline, but also it can free up a person to create unexpected processes. This one rivals my Pollack’s”
We needed you to say those things so badly. It’s perfect!
That’s pretty good. Not over-roasted and bitter like Wizbucks. We can get that at Padrio’s Coffee. No tube involved. Walking distance. Easy!
“Easy. The small potions lab is in the worst shape. I don’t think anything in that is salvageable.”
“I didn’t say I needed to make the snacks right this minute! We have plenty of time now . . . . . .where are you going?”
Thank You Mother.
Morning antics.
Not just tomorrow. It’s going to take days! And then Dean and Seamus are having one of the crews install staircases for roof access. They need to spell all of the roofs with a no falling charm too.
——————————————————————————
Personally I think you should. Creates less confusion.
I’ll be there on Thursday. Would the afternoon work for you?
Can Arthur use that for his slide show?
“Gregor, it’s just a bluebell! I hardened it so he could have fun with it. He was waving it around like a wand. It was just for fun.”
Yes. You do need to tell Draco and Harry about this though. I wasn’t pleased with either of their reactions. I thought they were in on it? And I couldn’t say anything to them because all of the kids were there.
Really?
There’s an entire room locked up with memories. The whole vault is like a library. Big tables where he sets things out. I swear every single drawing, card or letter we’ve ever written him is there. Family photos in huge binders for every year. Shelves and cubbies with trinkets, snitches, that sort of thing.
“Did you bring your playlist?”
Groy.
"Stairs.”
“What is this room? It’s like a glassed in porch? I didn’t even know this was here. That’s a view of the conservatory.”
Sure? Where?
Let me know the place and time for the wedding luncheon.
I’ve got to go!
It’s fine with me. The Granger’s know Aspen really well. I’ll confirm with Scorp though.
James needs to plan.
It’s called 3-D printing. I generate the sculpture on my computer and it’s printed out using filament. Kind of like string on a spool but plastic heated up by a machine. That piece is in 8 separate pieces then fixed together like a puzzle. The format is still pretty small, at least with my equipment. I can send you a video link of how it’s done?
TICK TOCK DAD! WTF?
“Broom Shed. You’ll also clean up after yourselves.”
. . . . . . . . . .
Just chatting about that interview.
“So now when we’re done with it guests can use it as more of a sitting area. Two balconies overlooking the conservatory and park. Do you like these curtains?”
Not yet. Didn’t want to share it until I was sure it was going to work. Eric chose the swirly brushed steel.
“Possible because he knew what was coming. . . . . . . . .
“Yes.”
I might need to speak with Harry again and get an idea for what to serve for luncheon. I’ve forgotten to ask if there are things Albus doesn’t care for.
And you’ve got these cute little dimples that show up when you smile now. Those weren’t there before.
“So it’s really just like apparating the baby?”
You just look healthy. No worries.
“No. I love it. The lavender is perfect.”
“Are you excited?”
“Turn it off!”
“Is there pineapple?”
“We will never know, Scarhead. Pour me some more of that merlot so I can get this abysmal taste out of my mouth.”
“Please don’t. You’re a married man. And to make it worse you’re married to my Uncle. That’s just icky. And my boyfriend would be pretty mad about it too.”
I’m working on the letters. Okay I’ve started. . .
I’m sure it . . . .
“There’s hand holding!”
There’s a reason there’s only four of us left here today. We’re the only ones who held out some hope. Many good members gave up over the years or were forced out.
Also, you’re a painter so I can see it. Anyhow, I want you to do the background for Decram to hang in the Grimmauld entry.
“HA! COME HERE.”
I’m done for the day. That sounds fantastic.
“Give it a minute and then we’ll try the bell. This is exciting.”
——————————————————————————
“There’s my Aspen. . . . . She’s getting heavier every day!”
Good choice. Because X is one of your very close friends.
London
Right down to the ratio between Scorpstone and agave.
Please promise again that you won’t spoil the surprise. Please give us this.
We’ll send pics.
People were saying hello and shaking my hand on the street this morning.
“I’ll look into it then if you think you’d like that.”
“Wow.”
“Do you prefer darling or scarhead then?”
“Do you like it?”
“You’ve already told them that.”
Where are we going? UGH.
“Say it.”
I want to see them! Draco is going to flip out.
“Let’s go in.”
“Hello Decram. You’re looking quite handsome today. Is that a new coat?”
“Teddy, the Centre is for those who want the cure. Nobody is ever going to be forced to take it. Any person with the condition will need a counselor to guide them and family through the process . . . . .
How’s it going Dud?
I’ve told you before I’m not dating a coworker!
Made it!
——————————————————————————
“EVERYONE.”
UGH. I did it again.
All of it?
“Go Draco!”
Could be. She really is uncomfortable.
Then use a different type of label for your new potions so you can’t mix them up? Keep the vintage ones out front just for display? Or you could get them to put glass over the shelves so it’s obvious they’re just for show.
“Ugh. I hate that!”
“Thanks for having me over.”
“Do you really think that?”
“Really?”
“Do you really think this is a good idea?
And EIGHT FROGS!!!!!!!
Going to tell the others now?
That's 80 fish! Will they like the ponds?
Isle of Man
“One more on the left.”
Hermione? How do we do this part? A raise of hands or?
Harry Malfoy-Potter
“Ugh.”
Ginerva, I do believe your Mother may have softened on her opinion concerning traditional robes for the wedding. It’s also possible I may have strong armed her. Pansy Parkinson has already designed for the wedding party. She only really needs measurements.
“GRAMPA!”
Definitely going to need to contact Hermione and Jay about getting additional help down there. Logistics and security.
On my way!
Fuck.
“Harry has every intention of making this house work out. Even though it’s so much more than expected. Me personally? We haven’t seen the whole place yet. The level above us is going to take a TON of work.”
I’m updating your schedule. Everything went crazy.
Not yet.
Did you see the bonsai garden? Merlin.
“Her name is Penelope. She lives in the park. Isn’t she cool?”
“I love you. And I want those boys to have a home with us. If they’ll have us.”
“Well boys, I’m glad you chose this room first. I’m happy to inform that I believe this one to be the worst of the lot. Well, maybe the card room is worse.”
Oh. Also make sure that Kreacher and Ruby are seated with us?
“Oh this IS pretty horrible, Scarhead. We might just need to call in a specialist.”
HA! Lily
Best splash of the day. . . . . TEN.
“Merlin this is a lot of food.”
“Alright! Let’s do it!
“Get that over with too”
Victoire will be integral on environmental issues. We’ve been ignoring these things while the Muggle world is struggling with it. It’s real and the Wizarding World needs to step up and take part. Victoire can be that liaison among other issues.
Also gives Mr. Jordan a rest.
Maybe we could enclose that front courtyard with a wrought iron fence and gate? Turn the little courtyard into an apparition point for guests. That way also we don’t have people flooing directly into the first living room. They can come to the door like real guests!
They’re going to write that overview. I told them not to tell me about the fucking galleons. I’m going to have to hire a team of people to manage this shit.
“YES!”
“Magic Marmalade? We thought maybe you’re like a band or something. We saw you pull in. Where'd your cool bus go?”
“Have you been golfing with your Mum again?”
“Let’s just let the kids have their fun.”
“Two balconies in the TV room!”
“You can use the easel painting for the TV and move it around.”
—————————————————————————
“THAT WAS A CANNONBALL MUCH SUPERIOR TO YOUR LITTLE WATER SPOUT, MARTINSON!”
“Obviously.”
“Not just me and Scorp . . . . . You and Draco too. You can see it in his eyes.”
“Why did they
“Lead the way.”
You’re not asking for much here. It’s almost all just cleaning and paint charms.
. . .You belong here and you belong with Draco. You always have and it’s finally coming together.
“Oh, yeah. . . .we’re doing that next.”
Kensington
“I think you look like a fashion model, Potter.”
The pride of the collection is called the Phantom II. Rolls-Royce, 1933. Seats 4 very comfortably. Deep burgundy and black. Mr. Elliot could drive this one easily with slight drivers side alterations.
“Okay?”
“Oh this should be hilarious. Dec and Sev in the same room?”
“I’m making breakfast, Potter.”
Actually you should come over and have a chat with Scorp too.
“You know the master is through there, go ahead. Are you getting excited to move?”
“The house?”
Narcissa makes some decisions.
“Oh my GAWD. You have to see it. I have to hang up all the clothes from Pansy. And the new stairs! Hugo you need to see the stairs.”
Nerd warning.
“Harry” has
Pansy did that? Those are driving uniforms?
Jooky
Please be advised that Gringotts has been charged with the maintenance and investment in these properties, accounts and vaults. All accounts continue to profit under the guidance of Mr. Liogell, your personal account supervisor. The accounts under Mr. Liogell’s supervision have consistently averaged a profit of 14.6% year to year, with the exception of the Potter Industries vault which averages 32.85% growth year to year.
This one isn’t awful I promise. I’d like you to try it. Draco will make it. He’s going to set it up. We can decide on 10 different places for it to go. This way if you need to come to my office at the Centre or Gringotts it will take you there. The main place can be something like the back porch of #12 so you can always go back to there from wherever? You wear it like a wrist watch or he can make it into a pendant on a chain. Which would you like better?
“Are you reading my mind? . . . . . . Please say
“Sorry.
“That wasn’t subtle at all. . . .All three?”
“Potter, your alcohol rule doesn’t apply when you’re not babysitting Aspen or watching the Boys.”
“You forget, I can turn them into splinters pretty easily.”
OMG! NO!!!!!
“You’re right.”
“Hello Severus.”
——————————————————————————
“Draco? Oh crap. . .come here silly.”
“Patty did you bring the pouring cream?”
—————————————————————————
OMG Hermione it’s terrifying.
“I just really hate talking about it, but in the Wizarding world it’s a big deal and Lucy’s going to need to know about it before she starts Hogwarts. Maybe we can get one of the kids to help explain it better to her. At least from the kids perspective.”
So now Jamie needs to tell you about his new broom dilemma.
“I KNOW! How’s Scorp holding up?”
It’s PERFECT don’t touch ANYTHING! LOL
“The painting? Yes, there are several. I’ll show you. I can’t wait to show you.”
Thanks for doing this. Okay we’ll see you in a few. LOVE YOU.
I would actually do that if it’s safe. You can get me in?
“No. This one just exists.”
“That was COOL!”
If Mr. Evans would like to observe the sorting and opening feast, please know that your “viewing balcony” has been opened. No need for janitor disguises. I truly think he might enjoy it but you’ll need to accompany him. My floo is open.
“You don’t need bone repair.”
“She needs a computer. That would be good. That’s another one of the things she "wasn’t allowed" with the school. In reality she just uses mine.”
Harry wrote a no contact list.
Can’t really think of anything other than that.
“We’ll spend the night and come back in the morning.”
You didn’t tell us that! OMG.
Those go right on the wall in my kitchen! I CAN’T WAIT!
“So sweet!”
“I said no more secrets!”
Mr. Trandy has his bar set up and ready to go. He’s very proud of his offerings. Everyone should sample his cognac! He has pepperup, and complimentary sobering potions.
“I SAID ONE HUNDRED!”
I feel so dumb about the whole thing. I should have asked questions. The more I think about it we were all pretty dumb. Hermione didn’t even question it. When do you want to go see Poppy?
I don’t know where the idea could have possible come from then ;)
“Come on in. . . . . this is Grace, Allison and Tiffany . . . . . over there is Allison’s mum Janice and Tiffany’s mum Melody.”
“The Peverell books? I know that they reside here. We need to have a ritual performed to access them.”
Just us three. I have a conflict.
“You’re not joking with me?”
I’ve got a little bit of a time buffer. But not a lot. I’m just conflicted about which way to go. If I do my own production it will take not only hiring more people, but finding a place to have them made. I’m not sure I’m prepared to do it and I understand your argument about partnering with another broom maker, but I’m in a bind?
“For what?”
Scarhead, as much as you’d like it I’m not going to disrobe in my office. In any event, you’re not here to make the effort worthwhile.
now I want you to hold your hand out like before and not give it the command. . . . . . . just think what you want it to do . . . . . like this . . . . . .“•”
"At the ocean in winter. The rolling waves are mesmerizing."
“Yeah, sorry.”
“Perfect. What about our fort?”
To the Grimmauld/Meeting or the Wedding?
“Yes, of course!”
——————————————————————————
“He hit on you?”
What about the quidditch pitch?
You know she’s staying on at the cottage.
I’m going to steal your boyfriend Hugo.
“Predictable, Harry!”
“Let’s do it!”
“You know he’s a Lord?”
“Give me the card back. . . . . . pen?”
That’s so cool! Don’t make me cry.
“Malfoy-Potter.”
“So dramatic! Maybe I should take up lawn mowing again? I’ve mowed that a million times when I was younger. . . . .I’ll go out and help him.”
“And I was right . . . . . Harry, I need chalk, three candles of any kind, an apple and a hand mirror.”
RE: @RSkeeter
.and a fang. . . . . And here’s Hermione’s collection of school books. . . . . . house cup from first year. Sorry about that, I know you were robbed.”
LLL: HA! You boys both went all grabby hands whenever we tried to separate you. I remember both sets of your parents coming to me with questions. Astoria and Ginny actually became friends coordinating outings for you two outside of the school. Draco and Harry were a little skeptical but worked it out pretty fast. Look where we are now.
“Well we can make sure to ask if they’ll come over tonight.”
“Black coffee. I think I need strong black coffee.”
“YES.”
OMG THAT KID?
12 Grimmauld Place
“Draco, help me adjust the painting. How’s that?”
“The Elf Union is running concessions at a higher profit than ticket sales."
“We’re NOT!”
“That order woman is not happy.”
APOTHICAIRE DRAGONNE
“Put your damned towels in the laundry?”
“Well congratulations Potter, this prank is a rousing success.”
“That’s it?”
Wizards Daily Guardian I think.
—————————————————————————
You can just DO that? You barely moved your hand.
From:
“Yes.”
“Put this on. It’s for Wednesday.”
“Why?”
Join Us For Tea (Sybill P. Trelawney).
So let’s begin, we’ve decided to meet for our conversation at my primary school in the arts classroom.
“It seems Trandy has raided my Mother’s champagne stash. They have an agreement.”
Harry J. Potter
Usual time?
SERIOUSLY.
“Yes?”
So cool!
See now that sounds reasonable! And Jamie is on the case!
“Using magic defeats the purpose! You have to cut it properly.”
“I’m doing my best. . . . . . I really am enjoying just visiting with people, but I think I’m about to go out and get some air.”
“Did you entertain there? It’s certainly accommodating.”
“Harry . . . . . . this is fucking museum quality.”
“He made a small fortune from those sculptures.”
MAYBE. YOU HAVE TO GUESS!
“ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?????”
“They do for sure. More than a few of them are asking when the rent goes up though. Especially the Muggles.”
“I want a better shower.”
Look at it this way, he has a scary job but he raised Louis. And Victoire & Dominique for that matter. How scary is that? You’ve known these people your entire life. Bill isn’t scary. At All.
—————————————————————————
Mr. Kreacher and Ms. Ruby - Hogwarts, Eric Wilson lives with Lily.
SM: Wow, this room hasn’t changed a bit.
Maybe you should reconsider.
“Did I tell you I love you?”
“If I didn’t trust you explicitly and consent to your shenanigans I don’t think you could have done it.”
. . . . . . . . .
“Pecks at you for attention. Proud. Dignified and disapproving at the same time? Loves flying. . . . .keeps secrets. . . . .
PS: Herman needs owl treats.
“Okay, then shower and bed. Long day tomorrow.”
I can’t wait. What’s going on?
Butterbean! What are you up to?
“Lime flavoured gelatin with mandarin oranges and shredded carrots in a cup. Ministry approved.”
Harry
“He did?”
He would probably enjoy sharing his expertise. I’d like him to spend more time with the kids. Since the boys will be at the cottage it would be a good opportunity for him to visit and help out. The family can be a BIT MUCH.
Groy brought pastries.
. . . . . . . . . .
Maybe.
I hope that’s a good thing?
“And I promise the units will be ready before the meeting. Mr. Trandy will assist.”
Susan Bones, Member thirty one - two seats.
“Draco you scared the MERLIN out of me!”
“Thank Merlin! Can I have one now?”
I love you all equally. I’ll never say otherwise.
“Did I tell you I love you today?”
“Is that TREVOR?!”
I like the Hariwake and the Shiro Utsuri for sure. So one for each pond?
What? You control the Wizengamot. You’re the new Chief.
I believe you’ve made a wise decision. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
“He wanted to give him the Jinx-Off!”
That’s a dangerous proposition.
“YES.”
LOL @ Pans.
“Shite.”
BURKES
“And Mr. Mason too! How?”
. . . . . . . . . .
“How many do we need for that room?”
I’ve got someone posted on that door.
We’ll get into that later. ANYHOW. There’s a property in my inheritance:
“Cake dome.”
“Merlin!”
“HA!”
NO! Put it back. Don’t ever try to be someone you’re not for these people. And put the fucking earrings back in.
Draco would flip out.
“It’s just that. . . . .”
What is that?
“Maybe a ballroom and a conservatory?”
“We can just play yes or no with these. I’ll point you choose.”
She’s right, Dad.
OH MERLIN THANK YOU.
“It’s Jamie with yellow hair! Look at this one of Hugo with the blue. Wasn’t he fucking cute? And I LOVE this one of Al trying not to smile and Scorp with his pink!”
I’ll take care of it. That’s an easy one. But Minnie and Poppy are on vacation in Scotland. Don’t expect them.
“I would like to present a composition by Darlania Groy, titled Ode to Familia Membra, with Full orchestration and pianoforte performed by the composer. Conducted by Mr. Jaydne Liogell Junior, with a final movement performed with the Elf Union Choir for a historic first collaboration.”
“Here we go!”
What’s going on there?
Look what I found over here it’s a VAULT with another billion galleons!! How about a castle? It's a ruin, but it's all yours now! It just didn’t stop!
“I think I’m okay? Mostly just worried about the hat.”
“Are you sure?”
“No, Mother, of course not, just surprised. How did you come up with that?”
. . . . . . . . . .
“See? It’s nice up here.”
“Sorry, I couldn’t help myself.”
. . . . . . . . . .
“Woah.”
It’s Sunday. Have a diversion!
“I think I’m fine Decram. I’ll just float these up the stairs to the big kitchens?”
“As far as I can tell? This wand is much superior to anything we could provide. . . .It was made only for him.”
Draco Malfoy-Potter, Lord of Prince.
That’s my Goddaughter! You guys look AWESOME!
You really never know. I wouldn't be surprised.
Here try it. . . .
“See you’ve already got a lot in common with Uncle Harry.”
When?
Can you take the boys overnight?
“Where do we park?”
How did that happen? Cool!
——————————————————————————
Where are you?
“You did not. Liar.”
I know. Pretty fantastic isn’t it?
I’m serious.
Sooner than that I’m sure. Harry went down to WW to get copies.
“Me too.”
I don’t know how or why, but yes. I'm confused. Her Mother is very unhappy about it.
Ron! Meet me at the Leaky in 30 minutes PLEASE!
“Tablecloth?”
“And it’s in the WINE CELLAR!”
“Okay Dad. I love you. Say hi to Harry and Grandmother.”
“HA! You’re as bad as Draco.”
“Yes, nice to meet you.”
“What’s in that one?”
“But I love this place and we have to come back. A lot. This really can be our retreat.”
“That’s the photo from like three years ago!”
Of course. You know me.
“HA!”
. . . . . . . . . .
Harry and Draco spend the morning in Scotland.
Check your email.
Yes of course I will.
“Oh please no. Please tell me you didn’t have a romance with my Godfather.”
Okay that’s all have fun bye!
“Quite a big deal what you did today.”
“Grampa Harry made a cake?”
“Are you really going to ward it?”
“Ha! She sounds really nice. And Mr. Brick dotes on her I guess. Tries to come off all gruff and stuffy in a smoking jacket and ascot at the breakfast table. But look closer and it’s a romance novel he’s reading.”
——————————————————————————
——————————————————————————
. . . . . . . . . .
“I’m afraid I’m going to do something stupid.”
We knew this was coming!
“Luna cancelled school? Music?”
Well that just made my day easier!
“Blaise is going to want to have a preview for the merchants.”
“Okay?”
“So the first thing I’d like you to do is take a look at some fabrics. Just choose five that you like from this rack first. Then if you go behind that screen I’d like you to change into the outfit hanging there. I’ve sized it. Put on the shoes too.”
“He’s the angel!”
“This one.”
—————————————————————————
That’s a good way to compartmentalize it. Start with the Who.
I will follow up with a firmer schedule soon.
“Well if it isn’t Harry Fucking Potter and Draco FUCKING Malfoy.”
Yeah. They’re technically not supposed to be here and I think just maybe they’re looking forward to having the townhouse to themselves?
You’ve got a cake to get started on. I need a list of ingredients.
“Completely sober.”
Pasta salad. A ton of it.
Teddy get over here . . . . Will you accept three of my seats and do it of your own free will?
“So you are the Aunt?”
“I don’t understand this at all.”
Hugo’s boyfriend is a genius.
“Those rooms should only need cleaned twice a year unless you make an art mess. Don’t look at me like that. It’s going to happen. You also need to hire someone to come and look at those instruments. They are probably all very valuable. You and Draco decide what you want to do with them. But it’s a horrible waste that they don’t get used. You take that baby grand and put it up in the entry hall of the family level for Draco. And hire a piano tuner on contract for that and the one downstairs at least twice per year. And again, they need to be treated like you would art. Got it? Write this down.”
“What now?”
“Those chairs go outside. They’re all folded up. There is a shower, it’s outside too. Cold water but you can use a heating charm on it. I’ll show you. Bathroom through there.”
I’ll tell Liogell to contact you and that you’re going to need staff. Is the carriage all that we hoped it would be?
“All this junk. It’s not mine. It’s other peoples stuff.”
“Yes, Gracie The Great. I can confirm. That is the eight of hearts!”
Family chat room?
“I guess.”
You did a lot today!
I was going to ask if the ministry could hire you to train the portkey department in technique because your skills are so superior.
“We’ll wait for him.”
Yeah. I don’t think there’s a lot someone else would want. It’s all pretty dated so it won’t be a much.
Me too.
"Magic, as you can see has accepted Jaydne Liogell, Sr. as the new Lord Ogden. Congratulations are in order."
Okay, so you're saying the infrastructure is already available. I always avoid it because it's a regulatory nightmare putting things out to Muggle retail. And if they have magical potion ingredients we can't do it at all.
“I like that. . . . Can we do that?”
“HELLO!?”
I NEED FUCKING HELP.
“OH, the letters. I never sent them, they’re full of angst and tears of my postwar traumas.”
“With the arugula?”
“What did you do?”
