“It is a bear.” If Potter thought saying it enough then it be true, Draco was going to have to disappoint.
He’d half prepared to pretend the night hadn’t happened at all. He whispered, “Scorpius, if you write a letter, I can deliver it. But be quick, I’d prefer if I didn’t have to fly back to Britain.” Scorpius nodded, started pulling out a range of used parchments from his pockets till he found a long enough piece. And before Draco could spell over any ink or quill, Scorpius clicked the top of one of those Muggle writing instruments and started writing.
Sometime later, Harry Floo’d in, the Manor told him of his return. Draco stayed on his bed and let Decimus sleep.
“I assure you, I am more than capable.” Scorpius snorted behind him and Draco tried to move passed the young man. He just followed suit and continued to stay in the way. Who would worry if Draco left too soon?
“Then, what about another bad idea?” Draco could tell what Harry was thinking, precisely, exactly what. Harry always lacked for subtlety. His eyes forgot they were green. And also Harry’s sense of neatness for formal events. Fool came to the Opraceius Manor with a duffed collar and hair looking like he’d rolled out of bed. But don’t even think about fixing it. Definitely a bad idea. He sat the glass flute down on the railing.
Harry hadn’t been told a thing, confusion evident on his face and Draco left him in the foyer. Figures James was as spoiled as Draco was - if not more - he’d probably been left off with every little issue because of his father. Figures Albus wouldn’t say anything to implicate his big brother. Merlin knows what kind of treatment James and Albus received were night and day from Scorpius.
“Are you doing them now?” Harry kept going. They swirled inside. Two, Three… Four? Five? What? No. They might clash and merge, taint and twist together, ruining the memory itself. Draco kept an eye on them. If he were poetic he’d call them something wondrous and bright, something illuminating and eye-catching. But he just wanted them separate.
“Blaise. You.” Blaise edged away from his seat and his letter, and held his hands up. “Potter thinks little but this is a new low. And it’s your fault.”
Scorpius read the letter aloud, enthusiasm waning as he went: "The Manor isn't safe. Stay away until I find you. Take what you need. Don't trust Boris."
At his home, Draco never chased much prey or fellow wildlife. He did like to harass the peacocks. Which demanded he leave their territory with those puffed up tails and Draco would flutter up and down the field and he’d have his revenge after being bit by one, aged eight.
Nott and Pansy were together by the door, whispering away to each other and Draco said back, “Even if I wasn’t here the people I wanted to vote a certain way should still do that. Me not being here doesn’t make much sense. That’s just one vote.”
Draco twisted his head. He didn’t care what they needed. They should stay outside, where they couldn’t see Draco. How else was he supposed to go through these files? Wasting his time was what they were doing. Still, she tried to slide and shoogle it from under him and Draco wouldn’t have himself outsmarted by someone who probably hadn’t got an Average on their Potions O.W.L.S (the fact he sat no O.W.L.S was irrelevant, he’d have an Outstanding, obviously).
Nothing and Draco made a noise. Oh, he had done something awful. Really, really awful. He hadn’t thought-- he was sorry, he didn’t mean this. He didn’t want this. He had just-- He’d just assumed and-- Bugger. He was a terrible person.
They’d found him. They had him. He flapped his wings to keep Harry from passing it before he could read more. What was he charged with? What punishment faced the bastard? Too much legalise and drawn out details before it was out of Harry's hand.
“You’ll need to impress him, most likely he’ll ask you to brew potions yourself without notes. I suggest you think of something unusual rather than difficult for difficulty’s sake.” Albus hung on his words, half out his chair already. He wanted to rush off in that youthful bout of energy and do something. Draco was used to tempering energy which made some kids not able to sit still.
“I’m just supposed to follow you?” Harry nodded and Draco scrunched up his nose, “No questions asked?” Another enthusiastic nod followed.
The room was comfy, if only because Draco imagined the majority of time people spend in this place it was sitting so why wouldn’t it be? And Healer Matthews desk was off to one side by the wall, adorned with achievements and qualifications. A little unaccustomed to what he should do, Draco sat down on the first chair he came to.
The large kitchen made Draco pause in listening around at all the Muggle chatter. Larger than the Manor’s kitchen and for the first time in a long time, Draco wanted to expand its grounds and make it anew. Make it better because if the Muggles had this, then he should have better.
“I know.” Hermione cupped some water and dropped it over Draco’s head. Blinking away the stray droplets, he saw as Harry perked up.
“Are they really destroyed?” Draco whispered back not wanting anyone else to hear and Harry nodded. Good, one thing had at least went his way. Draco left, too aware of how antsy and jittery Harry was near him and Draco didn’t want to make any kind of scene.
“Harry, hurry up.” He pushed his leg higher, his inner thigh up against Harry’s hollowed cheek, he wasn’t sure how demanding and in control he was sounding while he could barely keep himself from trying to wriggle and squirm free.
“The longer these are on the less of a Will I might have but the more inclined Blaise will be to order that Will around.”
He sneered at the word as he wrote it, fun. What fun was there to be had when he’d been too anxious over the death-threats. Draco was told to shut up and he did, his mind silent, but still stewing in his own fury that flared in his chest. The Floo roared to life and out stepped Nott himself.
“I won’t.” Harry didn’t look but neither did he let go. “Keep writing.” He rested his head against his shoulder and Draco sighed in defeat. A great deal of comfort came from simply the weight of someone next to him, the occasional refocus on something solid than the phantoms in his head.
The shower did have a chair, which was a well earned rest. Perhaps whoever came up with these gowns knew the possibility of fighting with clothing – the gown was easier to remove since Draco could do so one-handed. Not so terribly designed then.
A laboratory. Draco knew that cauldron cleaner smell anywhere. The thick stacks of parchment crammed into bookcases alongside tomes thicker than the wood encasing them. A dusty hovel with three rows of benches, and using one wobbling table Albus Potter sat surrounded with a stack of yet more parchment and books. Books old, but not valuable. Fourth Editions and co-authored messes. Draco turned up his nose at the smell. Stains of all types marred the pages.
Draco was aware Siobhan had done this before. Goven was an alias but he now had to wonder as she took no issue with holding onto his arm and still walking down the stairs with large heels, that she was somehow related to a pureblood family. Unless they taught her these skills at that school of hers.
Harry read in silence and Draco fought with the parchment. What was this? He wasn’t keen on whoever this Harry was, busy or not. Wasn’t keen on whatever was going on with him - his earlier time with Harry was never this strained, never this awkward, this blank canvas of emotion. Draco didn’t like his own feelings over this situation because, simply, when was he ever bothered by someone refusing to talk to him?
The bathroom was down the hall, Draco found it fit his needs well enough. A lock, considering Draco wandless wouldn’t stop an incredibly curious Harry Potter, but it would give him some time. Potter wasn’t keen to clean his place, but putting holes and tearing doors of their hinges seemed below even his new reluctance. So, Draco was content to morph back into his human form.
‘How could you not know this?’ Was an easy accusation to make. Scorpius had flipped over the parchment, began writing smaller.
“Lotty understands.” Unlike her typical reaction of rejected praise and hating being the centre of attention, she didn’t argue.
“Look,” Draco scratched his head, not sure where to start. “I’m going to say a bunch of things and they might be accurate, they might not. But it really is impossible for a human’s magic to do this to a Casting Tree, this takes more - mythical creature means. Or near an enchanted spring, or cultivated over centuries of numerous different families. One person just doesn’t take a Casting Tree seed and make a bloody All-Mother.”
“Mr. Potter always does more work when it’s here. You think it’s like a support owl or something?” The idea revived him. “Oh! Oh! Or a spy from the Minister making sure he does everything he's supposed to!”
Blaise didn’t seem to mind the accusations after that, calling on Draco to attend his mother’s latest ball – one which Draco refused outright. The Zabini’s had a certain connotation towards their hosted balls and Draco wasn’t a youngling to run around and flirt with the debutants of high society.
“...Finding a Healer is quite personal, it might just be taking him longer than you did because he hasn’t been comfortable with the idea until very recently. I wouldn’t write someone off just yet. Some people have waiting lists of a few months. Even then, he could have met a Healer he didn't gel with well.”
Was he allowed to move on? Would he be hailed as a terrible husband to move on after her death or was he supposed to be alone now, forever until his own death because some people assumed ‘true love’ meant he couldn’t love again.
So Draco bit Potter on the ankle and Potter yelled, spilled the tea down his side and battered his head off an overhead cabinet. Draco looked up at the ceiling and hooted in triumph. The Saviour ended up with his back to the wall and hit leg twisted over another as he tried to assess the damage.
He was an owl. The magic did not respond on his third or fourth attempt. His fifth or sixth and Draco wondered how he couldn’t see how coincidentally the fools had opened fire only after Draco flung himself out of a window.
“You’ve said you’re almost too busy for one, which begs the question: why would you bother if Albus is so poor a student?”
Was it wrong to enjoy this? To have his brain scratch and pull at an answer he was sure he could grasp. Soon, Harry might turn back to an insomniac his restful nights gone and even then Draco liked the idea of the mystery, a puzzle to solve and the reward that he was the one to solve it. Not his money given for someone else to solve it, him, Draco Malfoy.
Doing the math in his head Draco scowled, at first believing himself wrong that in his age and weariness had him unable to do simple sums. “Potter, that’s--” He did it again, the weeks in a year multiplied by three, times seven. Draco knew he was right. “You bloody idiot! That’s over a thousand vials with dragonblood.” He gave a once over to Potter again. How was he still sane? Blood of any creature had enough to cause addiction — and that was the kindest results.
Scorpius was sitting on the bench, now moved over to chat with the stone. Scorpius and Draco had spent many, many hours here. Most of the time, not together. “I promised you I’d answer any question you had. So, I’ll answer the one you gave.”
“It’s about Albus, I know I shouldn’t be here because I haven’t--,” Harry said. “And what you – what Scorpius – what Albus said before.” Draco scowled. He wouldn’t sway, he wouldn’t agree to this. Just let him talk and close the door on his face. Easy. Don’t look at his mouth. “I don’t know anything about potions, or what he’s supposed to be doing, or even how I’d find out without someone lying. I don’t want Albus to be miserable. I told him to write down everything he’s been asked to do. I don’t-- I don’t think this is right. Please could you look at it?”
“I used to like my lie-ins.” Half hoping the creature would take the hint and leave proved futile. An unmoving stare followed. He didn’t move either. Then the whining started. And what a noise that was.
“You have my condolences Mr. Potter to have such a fool as your son. Perhaps you might inform him why my son and myself aren’t in that unbearable prison?”
Draco glanced over to Siobhan, then to the unconscious Harry. He could lie. It wouldn’t be found out until much later. This might backfire. A good liar wasn’t one who lied always or one who told tall tales in the illusion of covering up more. A good liar told the truth just as much. Reasoning Hermione would shut herself off and give Draco nothing at the hint of a lie was more than enough reason to stay truthful.
The voting hall was similar to the dreaded court system. Circles of chairs and tables around the centre, which in it sat a large box, bolted to the floor. Harry and Draco picked two free chairs and wondered if someone was going to attack the very hall.
“Good boy.” When he was a child he wouldn’t have given the excited crup a cuddle because it was filthy and covered in a thick cake of mud. But so was Draco after several tackles to the ground. Now, it just seemed like a wasted opportunity so he calmed the overexcited creature with pets and cuddles.
Yet Harry still went out of his way to do the memorable. Who would ever dare to take Draco to the Muggle world? Who would ever try and push their way into allowing a Malfoy to meet unimprinted crups? Or how he was unbelievably resolute the poor reputation didn’t bother him to the point of almost everyone finding out on the night of his confession because of his staring.
Draco stared at it. As much as Harry’s health was not great the last few months, Draco didn’t understand what he was seeing. This was a report from seven months ago. Unsigned by Harry and Collin’s request was stagnant now, for some permission on borrowing another Curse-Breaker to help alleviate some of his workload. And another one, seemingly a case file of some sort - again for the old fart. And still unsigned, non-certified and waiting on Harry’s signature.
“Can you stop trying to ‘free’ my house elves? She is happy here, I assure you.” Hermione tutted, while Lotty fled away from the strange woman who tried to gift her many things over the years. “And are you asking as my boss or for some bizarre sense of Gryffindor sentiment?” Draco mirrored her arms, folding them over his chest.
Whether it be the pain potions Siobhan supplied him, the extra sleep he gained here while under the illusion it helped: Potter was weird. Strange. Chirpy.
“It’s tender, new skin, like from a newborn. Be gentle, nothing too hot, nothing too cold. No scrubbing.”
It was easy to see when Harry wanted him here. He was like a squid, or octopus or – Draco lay in the darkness, thinking up animals. He didn’t know many Muggle ones. A starved merman, that fit better. He hugged into him, sometimes even lying on him – as if Draco Malfoy was a particular brand of bedding – and he’d try and smother himself with him. It was all very normal and Draco found nights where Harry did want him around more than not.
“You’ve pissed off the Minister and I’ve yet to see her. How annoying.” He clicked the roof of his mouth with his tongue. Good. Serves him right and a convenient cover story to boot. Couldn’t have him too arrogant, Potter might implode. What a day this was turning into.
Draco refused to acknowledge how drunk he’d been, how bent over and crumpled his stature. How pitiful was this? To be caught like this? He stood up, fixed his collar and robes. He didn’t know whether to curse or thank Neville for the new clarity. What a waste of FireWhiskey.
On call, Harry had him give assignments and old reports to deliver to the Aurors’ desks. Most thanked him. Being thanked for being an owl? Delivering stuff? Where was his Malfoy pride? He took to screeching at them to hurry up so he could return to Too Cheerful and Moronic Fool. This was a favour to Harry.
“Draco, do you hate this?” Harry’s kiss was chaste and nothing like the previous. Shaking his head was nearly too much – it sounded like admitting defeat – and Harry seemed to understand what he meant. He kept going, pausing and asking as he held his hand, repeated it over and over and Draco found it more calming. He could answer a yes or no question. That was easy.
“You said this happened when he was just on Charlie’s Potions.” The timeline Harry gave him only gave a hint there were problems because of the lack of sleep, because of a once off incident involving the children. Something involving an Auror case. Not this, not hurting his wife no matter how involuntary it was. Ron’s anger seemed more understandable. Draco had no siblings but he knew how protective he could be. Scorpius was going to stay away from Harry for a while longer, not until Harry got help. This wasn’t safe.
He crossed his legs, leaned back and the way Harry gulped. Not helping, Potter. Not helping. The chill seeped into his back, gave him something else to focus on. He didn’t know what to do with his hands – other than putting them back on Harry’s skin – he clasped them, sat them on his knee.
“What did you do - to me - while I was out in the dining room that would make Potter think we’re together?”
“Muggle Things? Trust me, you’ll feel better.” Harry’s faced morphed akin to a mixture of nerves and embarrassment. “If I do it right.”
He made damned sure no one but Harry would hear this. Unlike all the hushed and low voices at the table, trying to elicit any reaction Draco was going to bet Harry didn’t react. For now. He’d try in his usual way to keep his emotions under control, and he’d fail. “We could be having more fun just the two of us.” He said in Harry’s ear. It was pleasing to see how Harry’s posture straightened and froze. Pulling back and watching how Potter had to close his eyes for a second and breathe in was enough to soothe Draco’s pride completely. “Now take your drink and go sit down.” Draco said more in keeping with how he spoke to everyone else. He handed off a FireWhiskey.
Harry was an oblivious sort but sharp over certain details (the Auror training less so and more having to defeat Voldemort before he graduated Hogwarts). Right now, Harry was reading the words but Draco struggled, casting a vague hope it would keep Harry’s attention until he could sort out this, these, emotions. Biting his lip he kept quiet.
“Certainly,” Draco lied. “I’ll be in the lab till then.” Making sleeping potions for Harry soon to be departure and writing an accusing letter to Nott about his lack of opinion on the voting world.
“First things first and look, I’m sorry. But you have to--” Blaise for once seemed unwilling to say the next part of that sentence. The rings were nice enough to transmit it, Harry’s face flickered in his head.
“What year did Charlie take over the brewing?” Draco turned his nose up at the jar labelled in his handwriting, ‘Flobberworm Mucus,’ and took a large dollops on the spoons before setting them back into an overhead cabinet.
“Merlin, what am I doing?” Draco shook his head as he examined the mess of his finger. Well, he wasn’t sure why it hadn’t cut off his finger immediately; it had done more damage at the thought than the action. Well, he supposed he was either desperate enough for any sort of interaction or, possibly, the idea of Harry wanting him wasn’t so unappetising.
“We’re going. I need to see your reaction to a platypus.” Draco was rushed to dress to go to Muggle London and while Draco wasn’t too fussed on leaving his more wizarding attire behind, leaving the safe house was the issue. Would anyone really expect to see Draco in a Muggle zoo?
,” he whispered and the blood vanished. His hands didn’t stop shaking and he clenched them tight. Nerves took over, a frantic mind trying to piece together what was the best, most efficient way to use his time. He must stay here, to keep an eye on Harry and Siobhan. If Moran saw this defenceless Manor, he’d attack in an instant, wouldn’t he? Draco bit his lip as hard as he ran through every which way he could even fathom what could and would happen.
“You--” Draco turned to see if Harry was playing a joke. But all Potter did was stare back, interested in what Draco would say. No. No, surely not. He was friends with Hermione. How--  “I don’t even know how you survive knowing so little.”
“How much is this going to hurt?” Harry wiped his hands on his robes and gave the basket another glance. Despite the two experts neither made a move to answer or fill Harry in. Too painful, Draco summarised. Damn all of this. Charlie received the full force of a Malfoy glare and for once, a Weasley looked away from under its weight. Him being guilty wouldn’t help Potter any.
He picked at the corner of one of his notebooks. A binder of Muggle-Paper. “I wish sometimes he wasn’t my dad, but I don’t want him to--”
“Looks like someone’s finished.” Hermione played the distraction game again and scooted away, leaving Draco to watch Harry peer down at him, towel in hand again. It wasn’t as warm this time but Draco was happier to stop the water running down his legs or over his eyes.
"It doesn’t make sense. Make a codeword, make a sign, who has time to track down a specific owl and torture it before--” The silence made Draco pause in fixing his feathers and again that awful look crossed Potter’s face. It seemed Potter had a soft spot for owls.
“I’m so glad you agree,” Draco sneered and grabbed hold of Blaise’s collar and apparated back to Harry.
Whoever made this curse knew for certain two things: an animagus that would flee in animal form and to hinder the unregistered in staying in said form. Someone knew. Someone actually knew about him. That was -- pointless to panic over. The only thing Draco needed to concentrate on was--
The beetle jumped from Harry’s hand and morphed and twisted as it fell. Rita was older, her hair grey and her glasses thicker. Though, her lipstick still was a vibrant red and Draco spied the notepad and auto-quill. Those, he’d need to rid her of those. Thankfully, the department couldn’t be held responsible for an owl’s actions.
“Harry, if you tell anyone,” Draco took a calming sniff, “I cried at this, I will deny it and call you a liar.” Now they had to wander the Manor, the land around it and let the crup run free – and Draco wondered if the poor thing had ever been allowed to run in a field never mind several.
“Well, my father will definitely hear about this.” Harry yanked away from Draco’s hand at the scruff of his clothing, his face souring and Draco tutted, “That was joke, Harry. Keep up.” He was trying to lessen the tension. He was trying to stop the adrenaline that told him he was going to die if he didn’t do something, anything. Everything was fine, even Potter not getting his self-depreciating humour. Potter always assumed he meant the worst.
Potter could use magic, accidental or not and Draco glanced back at his face just to make sure no tantrums were on their way. Just so he knew if he had to jump under the couch again. Harry was thinking about something; Draco couldn’t be sure that was a positive on his part. Whatever stopped Harry from forcing a head scratch on Draco (annoying trait by the noisy patrons of the Emporium) was interrupted by the man jumping up to his feet, “I’ll be right back. I’m going to get someone.”
“No?” Taking a sniff, he coughed away, shoved the blasted stuff back. Who, why would anyone drink that? What was Granger made of? What was Luna thinking?
“How is it romantic to sit in a cage?” Draco continued through his box – yet another box, Muggles and their boxes! - of puffs.
Draco left to Harry’s, ignoring the bubbling excitement. Cool and calm. He pretended to be unaware of what an oven was, what the cooker was, what the knobs on the side did. Harry was going to lose. Proper. Actually lose. To him. Oh, this was going to be so good. Finally.
Draco found his body not his own, writing thoughts he’d never once considered, never about Harry being jotted down all because Blaise thought Draco breaking up with Potter would contain it.
I did keep writing over the holidays but I wasn't entirely sure I liked what I was writing (whether I was just stressing at the arbitrary time limit or what I don't know) so I held this big boy chapter back and reread it and tweaked it until I felt it wasn't so bLaH and kept writing other scenes. Then my friend blew up my phone and I oops that I forgot about actually uploading the fecker and it's already January. Time is scary.
“You looked really good at that party of yours,” Harry said and Draco thought back to the evening Harry had managed to look surprised when they’d seen each other.
Harry found him hiding in the rafters of one of the opened interrogation rooms. He relented the notepad first then stepped over to be carried back to Harry's Office. He shut the door, grumbling about Rita and how much of a pain she was. Draco could only hoot in agreement.
“Just come here.” Draco debated on whether he should hold out for begging or at least a ‘please’ come from him. A foul mood which aligned with being told off made that unlikely.
Was it difficult to be happy at the slice of privacy where no one other than Harry knew where he was? No need for pretences or to watch his words in case it ended up in the papers. Harry wasn’t the type to let him bully his way or be a doormat to whatever whims he had that day. Neither was he dull for conversation, oddly enough, Draco had only really noticed that following the War and not before.
Draco could feel that Potter Gaze from then on. No matter what noise, a fake cough, a clear of the throat, Draco didn’t raise to see what he wanted. No, he was focusing on not vomiting over the place because there it was. The patch of skin which days before had been torn and pulled, bled and made Harry howl with pain. And it was blemish free, as if the nightmare was only in a dream and had never taken place.
Nodding, Draco agreed without a word. Good. He hadn’t the foggiest what a bloody pre-made microwave was. Shifting, Draco scowled. Bloody pins-and-needles already. The pain overtook the need to be polite.
“We’re kinda in the middle of something.” For the first time, Harry’s good mood flagged and Draco’s poor mood plateaued. Now, he had thought Harry was far too happy to see this Muggle, who hung over him and chatted only to him. A lie Draco even feel for - Ginny was right, Harry could lie. Not for very long, going by how he grimaced and scowled and tried to redirect any attention towards Draco back at him.
“I don’t suppose you bought your wife flowers and chocolates at every possible chance?” Harry sounded like he was mocking him and Draco was offended. Offended and outraged because really, was this how Harry assumed he acted with his belate wife? How cold and-- twisting around Draco raged.
“Oh!” Hermione greeted them with a smile that melted more of those nerves, “You both look like you're taking this seriously, good.” Hermione was in a similar shade of blue but nothing like the design. Merlin, Draco prayed no Witch arrived wearing the same gowns, dresses or robes.
Super long chapter to tide you all over for a few days. Got another fun chapter to be uploaded anyway. It's essentially fluff. Like just... fluff. Will be a bit busy IRL and I couldn't say when I'll get the time to sit at the laptop and go through it etc. Shouldn't take too long as it's not nearly as big as this one.
“So you knew? All this time?” Harry wasn’t angry, belligerent or insulted. Embarrassed might be closer as he fidgeted with his glasses, “You don’t--”
“Mr. Potter! And…” Draco ignored the fake tone, leaned over to read the scribbled writing in the margins of inches already written out. Duh. Boring. A variety of swears and a few scratched out faces. Such excellent teaching and learning going on here.
Draco was not convinced and it might have been obvious on his face as Harry laughed, relief in his own voice before it was gone. The rush of heat and his heartbeat in his ears made Draco wish he could apparate from the Ministry. What he expected was not what he’d found.
“Won’t happen again.” Albus nodded, blinked hard and fast before excusing himself to look at the cauldron. It wouldn’t need stirred for another ten minutes but Draco left him to his thoughts.
“Good, that hovel is ghastly. Tell me you aren’t sleeping there.” Wishing to ignore the lies once told, they both moved on without another word.
“Don’t! It is! It is!” He hit his hands against him, thumped a dull ache through his back. Harry settled fast when Draco refused to let go, refused to stop talking. “He died because of what I did,” Harry argued back.
Ha, as if he would. Not as if it hurt to make Harry Potter appear wrong. He cooed at her and accepted the pat over his beak with no qualms. He couldn’t see him but Draco heard Harry tut. Good.
“Nate, Nate what’re you doing? You can’t hex owls. Mr. Potter’ll fire you on the spot.” Nathan lowered the wand only by Oliie pushing it down - despite one wrong move and he’d be dead.
“I do not have a Mundane Cold. I’m too warm for that.” Harry snorted. “Whatever you are about to say, don’t.”
“You could use a bath.” Harry rubbed his finger and thumb together and Draco didn’t need the eyesight of an owl to know how thick the soot was. He ruffled his feathers at the thought so much dirt clung to him. If a mirror were around, he would take stock of the damage. So, Draco agreed and allowed the sobering Harry to scoop him up in his arms and relocate to the bathroom.
“We came here before but James ended up showing his… abilities so we had to leave. Never came back, didn’t seem to have the time.” Wiping his hands on those blue monstrosities Draco most definietly disliked, Harry sighed. “Was worried we were too old for this.”
Harry landed, looking to his scuffed shoes, upset oddly at yet another win. What was he going to say he hadn’t put up a good enough competition?
“A little sudden. Where did you say you were?” Draco had stopped eating, Siobhan had too and Harry had slowed to watch. Something was quite wrong and Draco needed to know exactly what. She was in his house, under his care as she kept Harry alive and breathing.
“Whichever Muggle decided that is categorically wrong.” It’s kids were far too fluffy and Draco disliked the noises they made.
Draco couldn’t quite understand what the Manor’s response to his order meant. The leaves from the All-Mother were different in all aspects. The one which sat on his sleeve was translucent, purple veins giving the only clue to the size. At his feet another, a simple black spine but dulled at the edges, and layered onto it a leaf which was purple on one side and grey on the other. With the tree gone, it was likely these would fade and shrivel soon too.
Draco took to fixing his hair and collar reminding himself he could run away as an owl but not meet Hermione with such an obvious untidy appearance.
“I’ve never seen her so upset, neither of them. And, and Albus was nearby. I--” Draco was tempted to flee when Harry’s arm twitched in his hands and for a moment, he was back in that room holding a bloody one down,  “--The way everyone looked at me.”
Throwing himself down on the couch, Draco said with little dramatics, “I don’t know if that was a special type of hell or heaven.”
Moran’s file, hopefully, would be in all of this mess. And then Draco could guess what he was really up to these days. Had he tried and failed and didn't have the ambition to try again?
This time he cast inside, not near Harry so he could see his failure. He cast it again, the wisp, familiar and no longer a sign of hope but of not falling backwards, solidified. Long and wide this time, the beak was easily bigger than Draco’s hand. Maybe it really was one of those large eagles that carried folk.
Draco returned to the potion-making with the added weight of one sad man. He made slow movements, keeping from jolting Harry or undoing the comfort he found somewhere in between his neck and shoulder.
“How is this working?” Draco whispered, seeing himself with Harry on the screen was a bit unsettling. He wasn’t sure how such a little box managed to capture them. Even when he moved closer, the phone tracked him. Weird.
“Before that, you’ll have to go and see a certain apothecary to prove I didn’t kill you.” Draco killed the hope dead as he threw in a measure of rose thorns into the three cauldrons. The burning smell turned sweeter, more pungent. Draco would not remind him the trip to this apothecary was done in his pyjamas. Even if the owner allowed him back, his pride would never dare set foot in there again. How did he look that night? Not decent at any rate. Now, if only Harry could agree to
“Why Draco’s?” Hermione saying his name was always… not fine. Her saying his name after everything just kept proving how much more of a mature adult she was than him. At no times did he ever think of her as - as the - as the term - from back when. But Granger was common for him to denounce her with, especially with the marriage with Weasley.
“Really.” He might have gulped and went all tense again, but whatever noise he’d just made was more likely because of Draco’s fingers tracing over the grooves of Harry’s back. The Muggle clothing Harry wore was always so very thin. “I’m trying to cook dinner here.”
Ha! Being a judge of character, manipulating people was literally a part of his job. Fine, Draco glanced back to the wall where the desk sat and Matthew’s certificates hung on show.
Harry burst, as if the lines he rehearsed would disappear unless he got them into the air, “I’m not addicted, okay? I get it, everyone says that blah blah blah blah, I’m not. I can stop as soon as I can get some sleep that doesn’t wake me up every two minutes. I can stop and don’t need some Healer talking to me as if I’m broken--”
Draco scooped up the letter, pushing Decimus away from mouthing at it. Another time he might’ve liked to peek into what Pansy delivered so desperately on her own. Now, dread sat on his chest and made him dizzy. Pocketing it for now, he glanced to the crup, play-bowing and eager like an overgrown pup.
“Sensible if someone is after my vote or influence. Which according to this, is exactly what’s going on.” Draco tossed the letter, fell to the couch and sighed. Now things really didn’t make any sense. “Why try and kill me beforehand if my vote’s so precious?”
Potter lacked all table manners, all elbows on tables and scrapping soup spoon on the bottom of the bowl. But Lotty was transfixed and never uttered a complaint. Siobhan rarely ate with Draco and he supposed the times he did not see her, she was resting or resupplying. Galleons were paid in full and she was more pleasant for a time after payday.
Harry didn’t stop Scorpius from coming over and hovering close to the post. Draco was well accustomed to the expression of Scorpius wanting to coo and pet over an animal. The day Draco refused to buy a crup was a war in itself. Tears, snot, screaming - Draco wanted that day to end then because he had considered he was being an awful father, worse than his own. The first few months of Astoria’s death was rough on both of them.
Whatever smart words were on his tongue died and Scorpius bounded over, walking side-by-side instead of trailing behind. “Okay.”
What should they talk about? If not those two? If not themselves both, once a time, wrapped up in each other and their pains of the world. Draco kept an eye on the amount of people milling around. If he wanted to fly, there could be no one around. Too busy here. Too busy here to really talk too.
He lurched forward as Harry hugged into the crook of his neck. Woah, there, he’d almost spilled the measurement cup. A grip so tight Draco wondered what wounds the Mind-Healer dug and routed around in. Probably the main one, the one where all his guilt stemmed. There was no way to unfeel an emotion, only digest it. Harry would always feel something at the memory but it wouldn't ruin his life.
Setting down her cup of tea on the saucer, his mother snapped, “Draco, sign it or you’ll no doubt be like you were on your fifth birthday.”
“Hush, come along.” Lotty made noises on the way to the Floo as she tried to formulate she wasn’t worthy. Trying to make a point to calm her, explaining it would help with work since she would know exactly which of the Malfoys were in the house.
Sneering, Draco adored the way Harry curled more into himself at the lie as he set his plate beside him, empty. “Like you don’t burn to prove you know how to cook rice.”
Dealing with facts, knowing and expecting movements from enemies and allies alike should make Draco immune to this, this self conscious fretting. Even as Harry sat back down, no longer too deep in thought going but how Draco felt his neck prickle. Whenever he glanced up to check Harry was back to his staring, and the lurch of being caught yet again made Draco force his head down to stare at this awful parchment.
“I didn’t agree to anything, anywhere,” Draco sniffed. Out of range to fall down the stairs meant Draco didn’t need to hover near either and slowly, he returned to going towards Harry’s room.
No. Potter was wrong. (Maybe). Definitely wrong. (Not). A new subject, a new subject, think, think, think.
Now, if only he could come closer so Draco could bite that spoiled brat. Harry’s patience must have worn out too as he lowered his arm and Draco fluttered atop the wall again, hooting about how stupid Harry’s son was.
A photo attachment that made Draco’s ears burn. Neville would regret this. When even was this? He was slumped over the table, Seamus and Dean laughing behind him. Ready to sleep, more like, than outright drunk.
“I said not to drink--” Harry must have seen the non-Manor-ness of this house, of his secret hidden away house. Harry’s words had a nervous edge to them. Whether it was because they were closer again or because Draco was making it very obvious he didn’t appreciate the lie, Harry stumbled over his words. “Oh, you remembered this place? I have to see somewhere a couple of times before I can--” he didn’t, wasn’t allowed to finish such a dull anecdote.
Instead of the onslaught of teasing and questions, Harry froze mid-bite. Looked worried like the pizza was off. “Is it… bad nerves? Are you...”
Something was missing, something crucial. He pushed the niggling and nagging thought aside and went to see if Harry had dressed down from his uniform. Tonight he’d have an answer to at least one of his hypotheses. If Harry’s friends didn’t murder him first.
“You can’t stay here, you aren’t well enough. I’ll make a batch for you--” Right, Harry still required potions and going by the shelf life of some of the ingredients he might have to make them in batches of twelve. Draco was pulled, physically, out his thoughts as Harry grabbed his elbow and looked at with such a strange mixture of emotion Draco would need months to study it to figure them all out.
The sheer horror in James’ voice made it clear to Draco he hadn’t a clue. Hadn’t a clue how Malfoy’s freedom was squarely rested on his father’s ridiculous moral compass. And if he didn’t know about the trials and he didn’t think about how Scorpius was different to the rest of those who’d shared his name, and James didn’t see either Scorpius or Draco as anything but cruelty left to fester in the world then.
Of course, Draco was not impulsive as much as he’d like to be and calling on a crup and demanding its loyalty might be easy, incredibly easy all it taking a few works.
Someone might’ve built it once for peace or prosperity. Or for social gatherings and the spewing of compliments to one another. This was one of the only times a Weasley and a Malfoy would historically be in the same room and even these days it was a chore.
“Woe is me, such wily Muggles. Thank Merlin you were there, Saviour of the Wizarding World or else I'd have lost everything.” Back and forth, Draco prodded Harry as they walked around and his face seemed permanently red, not once did he scold or dismiss Draco again. If anything his amusement wasn't hidden very well.
“Lotty will curse Harry Potter if Master is ever harmed.” She would never shift from an already sworn doctrine of loyalty towards him. Harry was on his own with this one.
Blaise didn’t reach the bottom of the stairs fast enough. A series of curses flew in the air as the door was thrown from its hinges, disintegrating in the air into grey sludge. Blaise dived to the side, Draco ducking down and knowing he was--
“That’s--” More than double the price of every street-seller, apothecary and potion apprentices skimming from their master's supplies combined, “Fine. Malfoy’s aren’t a Sickle family.” As his money clattered onto the counter, rotten and eaten by woodworms, Werk grabbed at his arm. Pulled him to the side and for a second, Draco considered himself dead, caught and stupid. But the fingers, nails which needed cut and cleaned, dug into his arm in a grip that made Draco wonder if he would even be able to cast a spell in time if he were to reach for his wand.
“Are we rehashing the same conversation?” Draco called back, not bothered if Potter followed him or not. He really would like a mirror to see how he fared. Potter did follow him and sighed at the footsteps - that sounded meek and unHarry, “Fine, is it your Magic or Will that’s buggered.”
“Blaise?” He couldn’t not look at his finger, the ring glowing and swirling its black and blue stone. Standing by the Floo, Blaise stared into the blackened ash of the fireplace and Draco was dazed. The place still smelt like a bakery.
Harry didn’t understand, but he would. It was the worst of the whole thing really. Because Harry would push and push and pull Draco through those dark double doors and chatter away to everyone about buying a crup and then he would see-- see what a blacklisting really, truly meant. It was embarrassing not in the way a half-revealed secret was but a wave of shame like the scars on his arm showed everyone. Looking at him, Harry wouldn’t be deterred, he didn’t understand. When Harry realised he really couldn’t buy a crup, he hoped he wouldn’t be too disappointed. Draco wasn’t keen to share his excitement, even at the chance to see one but adoption was never a possibility. Never.
Not so happy with this one but it'll do until I'm not as distracted by the end of Lucifer season 4. I am brokzenx~.
“I’m fine.” Harry always struggled against it – always against something. The man didn’t seem capable of having an easy life, making everything a bit too complicated to only create further complexes further on for everyone else.
“Where’s your usual Potter bravado you can do no wrong? Is it the rice? Is rice your limit? Snogging me at my political bash, fine, running around saving everyone, tolerable,” Draco waved his fork around, the sarcasm nearly enough to push him over, “but undercooked rice? I can’t even look at it, how could you?”
He sat in silence, eyes closed letting Luna’s presence calm him. Don’t make him see his face right now. He couldn’t cope. He didn’t know how to fix anything. How can you fix someone who didn’t think they needed or deserved it?
If Harry could let go, let him walk away with this glass of information, that would be best. “I will later, it's not that important.”
"No." Potter looked away, frowning into the Floo and Draco wished he could apparate. "It doesn't.” The paranoia returned as Potter glared. At him. Potter couldn’t possibly know, couldn’t possibly work this out.
“Extant families and their ilk don’t interfere with each other. You’re cut off for a reason, not even if you tried to tell anyone about this, I’d be safe.” Draco paused in answering the other question, but Matthews waited too. Fine. “Not many people want to be near a Deatheater, whether I was one as a kid who didn’t know what he was getting into or not, I’m not the dateable type.”
He was overheating now, from the warmth of the Leaky Cauldron and so many people crammed into the tiny place. He’d only said it to rile Potter. But honestly, a tiny voice, a picture played in his head. What would everyone do if Harry did just snog him right here? Because that ridiculous little voice in his head was also wanting to leave and take Harry with him. Because they probably could have more fun away from this place.
“You are such a git.” Rubbing at his neck again, Harry moved back to sit on the bed this time facing the line of potions. “What potion's first?”
Harry just wiped at his face, more lines of green trailing behind his fingers. It was then, the sharp expression of Potter gearing up for revenge made Draco step away.
“Goven said I should stay put earlier,” Draco interrupted Potter’s atrocious attempt at keeping him in the room, “I’ve seen the side effects already so I know what to look for. But I can leave if it’s urgent.”
Okay, perhaps the Muggle had shaken him a little; he posed the question of what would it take for Harry to lose his interest? Another, more aggressive pursuer, someone who hoarded and demanded and huffed if Harry spent time elsewhere?  Or someone simply the opposite of Draco. They only shared a few interests such as Quidditch and really, many wizards and witches were such avid fans Draco didn’t feel that was good enough to add to the list. Even the points Draco assumed were correct, were similar, had fallen and burned to ash. To think, he’d once believed Potter spoiled for attention when in reality starved might have hit more than closer.
“I’m doing the best I can with what Albus can manage.” Before Albus spoke, Harry did. Draco was all too familiar with his tone.
“Hurry up,” said Draco, a tad too aware of his own voice. It scratched out his throat and Harry pulled him closer.
“No.” The last time he and Scorpius went to see a game of Quidditch, well, it was nothing worth repeating. Looking back, Harry was crushed - clearly, with his pout and sulk and his knitted brow and his scuff of his shoes against the floor. Another pang of guilt, another flash of tiny teeth and Draco sighed, relenting. “Nowhere too public.”
“Yeah and I don’t know. He never told me. I would ask and he would say, ‘It’s not like that,’ and nothing else.” As if she’d been slapped, she sat stunned, face reddening. “Yeah, just, could you go?” She put her hands over her eyes and Draco didn’t need to be asked twice. “I’ve had enough of this, of you.”
“That’s enough Rita. Unless you want me to hand you back to the owl, turn back,” Harry commanded and the entire department seemed to wait. Some wore confused faces, looking to their seniors to see if Harry Potter had really lost it.
When Draco kissed him, chaste – though Harry tried to change that – Draco let go, used his hand to keep Harry’s head still with his chin. And kissed at the side of his mouth and across his jaw and on his check and over his temple. And then that ridiculous scar, each side of it and Draco spied Harry wasn’t entirely out of the way and his skin was damp from the shower.
But Scorpius, not much older than the previous came running, in that waddling excited way small children do, and hugged onto his mothers dress. Draco spied the raw redness of his hands. What had he been up to?
And said brat didn’t have the lineage for complicated plans; the Quartz were low even in the terms of blood purity. Idiots. Snivelling idiots that tried every quick-rich scheme ever to be invented. Not smart, not rich with little connections and they were killing folk trying to get Draco’s vote. Well, get Draco’s will and all that entailed. Malfoy Vaults and power was no doubt tempting.
“Harry?” She cooed over him, worried beyond measure and Draco shifted at the memory his wife was dead. He wouldn’t find someone to do that to him again. He wasn’t that lucky. “Harry? What happened?” Harry didn’t say much, didn’t look at his wife in any way, but stared at the floor.
“You can’t stay here, Moran’s coming to kill you.” A hint of anger, worry, and such an anxious fidget coupled with the juxtaposed squared shoulders ready for a fight. Draco didn’t know what to make of it.
“Master of Death is the coolest thing the Wizarding World has and I’ve always assumed it was just a story to teach children a lesson.” But no, no Harry proved the items real. Did Harry manage to survive from an entire Ministry hunting him because of the Cloak? Because not even Death itself could ever find him?
“Draco’s helping me with a case.” Draco was so terribly glad Potter was focused on the wall in front and not on Zabini. He’d smell a lie fast.
“Nothing personal it’s-- It was me. I may have mentioned you a few times. And she picked up on it.” Harry did not follow up, he shifted his attention elsewhere, starting pawing at his glasses. Never seen that habit flare before.
“No.” Draco sniffed, all put on of course. He may as well play a bit, considering Potter was due some revenge on how poor a patient he was and how frayed Draco’s nerves were these days thanks to him. “If I kill you here no one will be the wiser.”
(People aren’t vases, Draco. Matthews said once, when Draco had said the War broke him. He’d found the interruption maddening and insolent. Clay, he added, people were more like clay – easy to shape and steal from, but never enough to ever take away what could be – Draco had lorded the idea as hypocrisy. If he were clay he’d easily paint over his Mark and be done with it. Matthews said painting doesn’t go on softened clay, it goes on vases and Draco had found the entire discussion far too pompous even for him).
“Hermione’ll suffer then. It’ll all come out and she’ll be the one everyone latches onto for why this and why that.”
It was too unlikely for the intruders to have slipped out of the Aurors holding cell and grab them. Looking at Harry, he seemed to think the same thing. “I’ll ask around, see if anyone was snooping about your stuff when we brought you in.” It probably hadn’t crossed Scorpius’ mind that someone might have simply seen the tattered clothing, seen the rings and then thought it was their lucky day and swiped them.
As much as Draco didn’t want to – Scorpius slipped into the Weasley’s shop. Happy to talk about a long awaited prank he would play on Albus. They spent too long in Diagon Alley and while Draco could slip into Knockturn Alley, he didn’t dare take Scorpius there even though he was no longer a child. Best those two never have a reason to need each other.
“Dragons aren’t exactly the cheeriest of mythical creatures.” Watching, Draco saw Harry wasn’t lying in his struggle to see reason.
“Are you hungry?” Decimus gave a high pitched bark that went right through Draco. Ouch. Food, that’s what Draco needed too.
Magic that was ‘Dark’ had an edge of pain towards everything, a sense of wrongness and weight that didn’t happen with most spells. Funnelling in negative emotions, worse experience and traumatic memories all culminated into a casting that would fail or turn wicked.
Returning here had terrible repercussions. Potter had wandered around the Manor, Draco had to admit he’d lost track that Harry was even there. A fact Draco blamed on his owl form, keen to seek out everything that moved and go for a single, focussed, target than multiples. Scorpius and the intruders were on his mind more than the nosey pillock but now it dawned on him Potter might believe ‘Fornax’ was not a normal owl.
Draco was going to die. Die right now and be perfectly happy. Because the amount of tail wags he received, so many curious snouts coming over to sniff at check if he was pureblooded - they didn’t seem to bother much with Harry for once in Draco’s life - and Draco took on the responsibility to give them all at least one pat on the head, a head scratch. Whatever the bloody things wanted, really, and Draco hated it.
“Looks like I’m taking your wand again.” Draco didn’t let it go easily but with his hands pushed together even his grip onto it wasn’t enough to stop Harry from pocketing it.
“You can’t stay here forever. You have my word, I’ll find discrete people. We can all help you then.” Draco had to wonder if Siobhan had asked for galleons from Harry before coming to him. She was trying to play them both - two payments for one task. He’d keep an eye on any expensive Siobhan’s suggestions.
“Harry, do - did you share everything with Ginny? You never kept secrets?” Draco wasn’t keen on asking about her but after Harry’s show with sharing food so nonchalantly Draco had to know. Astoria had some secrets, some burdens and baggage from the war and Draco never asked because that was the agreement.
Despite this, Draco returned without fail, still with the same mixed feelings. He liked talking about himself. Obviously. He liked talking about himself when someone listened without harsh judgement. He spoke about how he wasn’t Good. And Matthews claimed it wasn’t the first time he’d drawn a line between everyone else and himself. Draco did not call him a liar. But he thought it.
And then Harry flinched - Draco forced his arm as still as possible - the teeth went in - Harry cried out to stop - he was trying to move, but couldn’t, drunk, yet not numb enough - and the teeth dug in like hoes in a field, twisted and raising flesh like it was nothing - Harry was telling them to stop. And Draco wanted to stop. But he didn’t. He held onto his wrist, stronger, since Harry was now desperate - the leech purred and the teeth were nothing on the sucker that latched on and - Draco looked away. He couldn’t see this, he couldn’t hear Harry sobbing in the chair.
Draco turned up his nose at the nickname of Parkinson or Mrs Nott these days. She was as keen on him as he was her. If Blaise wanted to shag crazy that was his business but one error, one false move and Theodore might leave her.
He pushed Harry in retaliation for the pull of his hair, against something else, Draco didn’t care what, didn’t check - Harry was fine, he was still eager and pawing at the wisps of hair at the nape of his neck. As the blood thrummed in his head, the cuts on his finger bled more and Draco didn’t care.
“I’m not scared of a Mu--” Draco stopped as a family pushed by, though this time some grumbled and a few Muggles ended up too close to discuss anything but the mundane. Nervous at the wait, the sight where people would line up and submit themselves to this. Draco was eager to sit down. Even if it was some sort of torture device, the seats weren’t terribly comfy.
“If this actually helps him I’ll never hear the end of it.” Draco sighed and hated the fact Harry did have this idea before - and Draco had shot him down citing it as stupid.
“I really hate this place,” he muttered, leaning against the door frame and letting it sink in. He should care for this place a great deal, Scorpius was born upstairs and his own childhood had many pleasant memories.
Saved him from Hermione? Ha. More like been a meat shield for whatever had wound her right up today. He’d once been told off for refusing to accept another house-elf affirmation. Lotty would have sobbed herself to sleep if she thought Draco needed another elf to help out. He’d never hear the end of it. He couldn’t have known about Hermione’s warpath but it served him now.
The whispers never stopped, but they lulled quietest when Blaise was further away. Like an alarm alerting to a thief, they screamed and howled once he started to speak and Draco’s Will was taken from him again.
Draco couldn’t understand, didn’t understand. Nott knew, always had, about Blaise’s plan and now he claimed this? To be uninvolved? While he watched him be at Blaise’s beck and call.
“That’s nigh impossible. Your potions work. Your father on the other hand could destroy any mixture simply by being in close proximity.”
“Do you even know what the word restraint means?” Draco caught his arm hoping Harry wouldn’t fall back and smash his head bloody.
“Pout all you want, Potter.” Teasing Harry was all good and typical and comfortable – so familiar – but seeing Harry’s disdain over planning the day and feeling underappreciated wasn’t a win in any regards.
“I slept in a cupboard under the stairs for years before I went to Hogwarts,” Harry said and waited on an answer. Draco shifted uncomfortably at that. To have a response, Draco needed to know what Harry was even talking about. The words on their own made sense but together Draco did not understand. Muggles might have bedroom under the stairs. But a bedroom under a staircase? How grand a staircase must be to fit a whole bedroom beneath it. Was it smaller than normal - than these rooms, in Draco’ home - was that what was pitiable about it? But Harry had said cupboard, not bedroom. But where else would someone sleep? Hermione once said her own home was barely large enough to swing a cat in - a turn of phrase that had Draco concerned. This was yet another glimpse into Muggle life.
“Home, then.” He remained as passive as he could, pulling Harry’s arm over his shoulder and apparating where he crouched. The destination was the only home Draco knew Harry lived like a wizard of his accolades and prowess. Ginny lived there too and Draco wanted to see how she would react at a defenceless Harry Potter landing on her front step.
That's a lot of kudos! So, thank you all! It's kinda crazy how many people are reading this. Thank you again. Urgh. I feel like a parrot saying the same thing. But thank you!
Draco blinked. Huh. A fine answer, some people might think Harry had been an Auror at some point. He twisted back and fluttered onto Harry’s arm. Taking the note, he ignored the stroke at his beak as Harry reopened the door, magic dissipating.
“We should destroy them.” Scorpius sounded sure and it was a relief to hear but Draco didn’t expect the loud sigh, bordering on a scoff to follow it, “Why can’t we destroy them now?”
He ordered the drinks and waited. Waited and hoped the tingle on his face would leave. “You alright there?” Harry said close in his ear, the Leaky now jumping - the furniture occasionally trying to make a leg for it out the door. Too many conversations made the Leaky sound like a droning Ministry office. They could talk and Draco doubted anyone would be able to make out the conversation. No wonder they’d met so early, else they’d never have found a place big enough for all of them to sit and drink.
Hermione had said Harry had some hang ups on affection - or something like that - and Draco was sure the flush on his face attested to the truth of that statement.
“Did you send her this?” Draco twisted his head upside down and read the letter. It was his handwriting, yes, though Draco would never have sent a letter with blots of ink marring the bottom. The tone of his letter was what most considered him to be, brash and demanding with little leeway for the recipient to say no. Hiring Siobhan was under the table as was her payments. She wouldn’t have kept this letter even if Draco had sent it to her.
Draco moved around to avoid Harry. Siobhan noticed and made a comment which Draco ignored by then avoiding her for the rest of the day.
She seemed to have the wrong idea as she stayed inside. Draco wasn’t going in there. Not yet. It would take him time to brave the painful reality behind this door. He needed time to prepare for empty shelves, barren and cold. They walked back to the entrance in silence.
“Where’ve you been? I’ve been here for an age!” Blaise huffed and Draco nearly said the whole truth just to see if he would believe it.
Thank you everyone for reading and giving your kudos and bookmarks etc. I'm still shocked at how well received this is? Like I thought, KT might like it and maaaaybe a few others. But wow. Thank you again.
One solid squeeze of his hand and then Harry let go and Draco didn’t know until now what the word floundering meant as Harry crawled back under the covers. Had Harry meant to leave the door wide open?
“This is probably my fault.” What stupid spell had Harry tried to cast now? Draco didn’t believe him. Didn’t have the energy to complain. “Muggles, you know. You’ve caught a cold, I think. Maybe it takes longer for a wizard to get ill?”
Harry kept mumbling, potion not as fast acting but certainly potent enough to make Harry stay asleep - but considering the other recipes and their timings, this shouldn't be too much of a stretch.  “Don't worry,” he mumbled and Draco hushed him again and again. “Present, promise. S'fine. ” What Harry was even trying to say didn't manage to come through after that.
“Okay, he says, right. I’ll leave you two to it.” Draco was no good to anyone here. He’d wait with Lotty, watch the tree die and hope the same fate didn’t come for Potter. How long would this take? How long did Charlie think the leech had before, as he claimed, ‘got too hungry.’
What else did he need to give permission for? Albus seemed the type to toe the line so long as he had what he needed set out for him.
“Have you ever been to Muggle London at night?” Harry might like to think his face only beamed of sincerity and something close to honourable but really – mischievous was closer to what Draco was used to seeing. Hooting again Harry hummed back. “I’ll take that as a no. Unless you’re gonna say you’ve been hiding Muggle clothes.”
The younger lot were all gone by the days end and the older, doing paperwork and tying up loose ends were bent over desk and grateful at the clocks whistle. They left immediately. Harry wouldn't stay much longer and Draco flew home to wait.
“Harry didn’t hit me once.” He touched his side and his stomach gurgled and his skin flinched. “Damn it.” The Unseamed wasn’t gone, it had reopened and Draco didn’t know how long he had till it grew to the point he wouldn’t manage to walk. So, far it was a stitch, a constant but bearable pain.
“Did you know about this? This Muggle… buffoonery?” How many Muggle traditions were this weird? How, just how--How was he ever going to share anything ever again? Ron gave him the only sympathetic smile in the room. Unsettling.
Snatching out a wing which, morphing in a mixture of confused sensations as it turned into his hand, he held Harry’s, towering back over Potter. His once perching post jutted into his waist. Harry’s hand was cold and Draco scowled.
“The meeting overran and the minutes weren’t even the slightest bit accurate.” Hermione didn’t seem at all phased by his presence and took the last butterbeer from the centre of the table.  She seemed to have some power of presence as the chairs were eager to move. One tried to flee to the bar itself and was stunned by the mean looking bartender back into place.
This time, the chair was filled with a snoozing Scorpius. Wasn’t that a relief? Theo and Blaise must be long gone now. A nightmare was over and now Draco could focus on healing – and finding whatever clue he could over where the two had slipped away from. He left his son to sleep and it was only when a Healer slipped in to check on him did the boy awaken.
“Let’s fix you that potion now.” It would seal the deal, a physical reminder even Harry couldn’t ignore. But Harry not knowing anything about brewing, Draco extended some critical reminders. No potion was miraculous, no matter what it appeared to be. “Your magic isn’t going to set itself right from the instant you take one. You’ll need a while for the dragonblood to filter out.”
“You could end up dead. Or a squib.” He’d still be off from work, avoiding the press about his affliction. But it might stop his mind from breaking under the aggressive instinct of a dragon. Draco tried to show confidence, it would work. But it might kill him. But it could work. “You’ll need a Healer or someone that knows how they work. I can’t - I don’t have the skillset to deal with this. I can’t do this for you. A potion is fine but this isn't my area.” An apology almost made it into the air. Draco wished he'd learned more about mythical creatures than their innards. All he'd cared about was what use they might hold in relation to brewing. If he knew more maybe, maybe he really could've saved Potter on his own.
“I’ll wait,” Draco muttered and looked down at the dessert he’d forwent again. He was getting sick of ice-cream, honestly. It wasn’t a food he could eat quick and ignore what just slipped out of his mouth.
Lotty looked up at him, eyes popping and she squealed, “Guests? In the Manor? A party? Lotty gets to make a party again?”
“Harry and I were talking about him retiring or taking some time off and it was just a little fight. Nothing even you could call a fight, just bickering. Like a married couple.” Draco handed her a handkerchief that was in his pocket. He wasn’t very well equipped to deal with anyone tearing up but he could do this much. Ginny awkwardly left it on the counter, took to twisting a washcloth in her hands. He could understand in a way, he wouldn’t want to cry in front of her either.
“Are you finished?” Harry turned to leave, no less angrier than when he’d first spoke. Right. Not good.
“No, not really.” Draco took to sitting on one of the roots that let him sit high. He could see Harry’s face was covered in the same scratches and brick-dust. “I know what’s wrong with you.”
Draco FireCalled Luna. He paced in front of the fireplace as it flickered green hue across the floor.
Deadpan, Draco stopped walking. “Say that out loud once again and I’ll throw you to the bloody pandas.” Which resulted in Harry Potter losing his absolute mind. So much so, his laughter ended up nearly defeating him and he struggled to walk to the next enclosure. Well, at least Harry was enjoying himself.
Laughing at how worried Scorpius looked at that was too much. “No, Scorpius it is not Ron bloody Weasley.”
“Thank you,” Draco said not hiding his discomfort. Ron grimaced as if Draco had asked him to marry him.
Now, Siobhan had ran from the Manor in a way Draco wasn’t entirely unfamiliar. She was scared or disgusted. Something changed at that party. Luckily for Draco his week of studying did allow him knowledge of who was there. Now, did he know any off the top of his head which were in the healing profession? No, not unless they were trying to come across as philanthropists and no one mentioned or asked anything about Siobhan. Not to Draco at least. And there was another possibility that perhaps, maybe, Draco was right to be paranoid. Perhaps someone else was at that party, uninvited but within the bounds of believability. Should Harry have postponed that confessed and bedroom eyes, Draco might have seen who it was.
The only thing Draco could say for sure, when the picture snapped, Harry still didn’t sleep well. Six months of hounding already. Now, Albus hid away. Draco could remember Scorpius doing the same whenever the cameras and quills came round to sit in their gardens and waste time.
“You might want to start talking.” Harry had pocketed his wand and stood, arms folded and watching Draco as if he was a suspect. Well, screw Potter.
It, Draco supposed, was not too bad. He was going there today anyway. So, really, in the grand scheme of things he’d won.
Awkward wasn’t the word. Unaccustomed might fit better as Draco’s wife was content to be swept literally off her feet and into his arms, he doubted Potter would appreciate the act. Harry was trying to walk not simply move rooms - anyone who Draco held any affection for was lucky, absolutely lucky, honestly because he was Draco Malfoy and he was the head of the Malfiy name and wouldn’t do such a thing for just anyone.
“Is there really nothing I can do to help? I could stay here. While you write.” Harry sat down facing away from the table itself, the backless chair was transformed from a bench many generations ago, it wasn’t comfy by any stretch.
Had he fucked up? Really? How badly? Going by how sour his face was made Draco panic a little. This wasn’t a pet peeve, this was a curse Draco had reawakened. Harry sighed, drawn out and glaring at the pages in his hands.
“How about I buy you a drink and you don’t interrupt me?” Draco snapped and left to get himself one too. There was only so much he could handle a smirking Neville before he would veto the idea of this man helping him.
Sitting up, Harry was more than curious, eyes twinkling like it would be the answer to all his questions. “Do you still have it?”
“Yeah, okay.” He was disappointed. Which was a curious and frankly crazy reaction. Had he forgotten about keeping this as far away from the newspapers as possible? What if Rita was sniffing around? What if someone overheard? Draco would never be pleased at being a secret – he liked attention especially from those he liked. Really, was there a better feeling than walking into a place and the one person who everyone clamoured for attention only wanted to talk to him? But the idea of revealing to Harry’s friends - and Draco still wasn’t sure this was sane even going to the Leaky - and telling them all about it was madness.
Draco knew he was no good. Knew he panicked easily. But maybe, maybe it was Voldemort and the War that shifted that little part of Draco’s brain to that point. A point where Draco had, had enough and started think, think, think.
“Lotty brought some, said you hadn’t eaten breakfast.” Harry gave him such an expectant look it was difficult not to sit up and attempt to eat. The tray sat nearby, two plates – one empty, Harry having finished his own in several quick bites with such speed, it reminded him of a baby bird, swallowing up whatever food given.
Even if Harry had admitted he drank potions for sleep though they were more regimen than necessity, Draco had his own quirks after the years. He never did like his handwriting again. All throughout the weeks, checking and testing what and how Harry had changed came to the relieving fact: he couldn’t be faking this. Couldn’t be lying at all.
Theo was a maybe, Pansy was a maybe. Blaise was still an unknown. He might side with Pansy. Or he might go on his usual tirade of how his family was apathetic of all political and social views for a reason. Hanging on the fence was a sport for the Zabinis.
She must have known, had some inkling of the demons he possessed because of Voldemort. About the rumours of torture and death, and yet not once was he asked to explain because that was his - not hers, nothing for them to share. Ginny and Harry had gone through the War caring for each other, perhaps that’s why Harry considered there should be no secrets because no secret was heavier than the war they already shared.
They did as they always did. Too much egging on and riling, too much pride and ego so neither wanted to stop if a draw or loss was the last they’d played. Draco’s lungs hurt, everything hurt but still he claimed himself fine for another round. Even when both of them were red, out of breath and struggling to carry on a conversation, they kept going.
Decimus whined. Draco apparated away. The problem which Draco hadn’t considered was Britain wasn’t the warmest or driest of countries and so when Draco landed in the last field to the east he noticed how the grass underneath his feet was waterlogged.
For now, Harry and Draco be hyper aware of each other. (It just took a while to get here!) Still lots of stuff to go through, like, so much? I don't even know how anymore how long this'll be. (Smut wise I've decided I'll put that as a sort of, chapter on its own and those who don't bother can skip and not miss anything out). That'll be a while tho.
“Do you think I’m so easy to fool, Potter? Get back here.” The branches did not fade out of existence as they should. They appeared burnt and gnarled despite the rest of the tree unblemished. “You stopped it. You stopped it growing.” Harry didn’t say a thing. “Why?”
They joked, reluctant to stay on heartfelt topics for too long. Neither of them had it easy but dragging it back up wasn’t helpful. Draco went through a series of what ifs – Collins would have a heart attack clearly – and Harry giggled alongside him at the idea of the Prophet knowing. Impossible as it was – Draco wouldn’t be able to deal with people, not in the way the uniform required – it was funny to imagine.
“I understand. They’ll get jealous.” Was this longer? Or did it seem like it because he was sitting? It seemed to cover all of him, draped and perfect to keep him from harm.
“You stay away from this shop if you know what’s good for you.” He sounded harsh, harsher than what Draco had ever heard from him. Wrek made a song and dance how much he disliked Dark Magic but he sold anything to everyone and didn’t ask.
“Nott wouldn’t try to protect me even if I was the last person--” But dear Theodore Nott had tried to protect him, in some manner. He’d given him a little note, filled with terrible hints and the worst attempt at hiding his own identity ever. Siobhan, the fake one, was younger not quite a cherub’s lying face but it fit. “That’s--” And yet, Harry wasn’t in need of a Healer long term when the note was passed; he’d only started using the Casting Trees then. So, how could she possibly see Draco Malfoy would be in need of a Healer?
“Well, I’m glad to tell you your taste in men has increased exponentially and I won’t be name dropping you even if you ask me to,” Draco sniffed, a bit miffed at how this might have been what had set Harry off. Maybe he’d heard it or read it in a report? Or did he go back and double check everyone who’d ever given testimony while Draco slept?
“Doing what?” He grinned and Draco let himself be dragged into the half-hearted bickering, if only to avoid any talk over what he was fretting over. Harry tried to lull Draco away from the window, a few cheeky but chaste kisses ever the distraction.
The Manor bothered him, a pressure at the back of his head that gave him a slew of new worries: where was Scorpius, was he okay? Ignoring those thoughts, not entirely his - prompted by the Manor’s need to keep all of its residents safe and happy.
Today, he kept himself in his room. Unable to face Harry just in case he decided to pull a proper confession out of thin air. Draco couldn’t deal with that right now. Lotty had her orders, a buffet and the list of available foods had already been delivered. Hermione must have a reason to serve some old toffee as an option. All Draco could guess is it was someone’s favourite. Someone Hermione needed to be in a good mood.
“Shut up! What a load of nonsense. I don’t need to hear your ramblings of days gone.” Draco forced himself to look away despite the compulsion to stare and listen for more. What an insight to family history-- Draco shook his head. No, he was not so easily swayed and he started to shut up his mind. Focus on one task, let nothing else in.
That bloody pest Neville practically pulled him into all kinds of nonsense. Draco had a suspicion he had wanted to learn and needed an excuse to have someone go with him. Draco baked a cake.
That - that was funny. No mirror or reflective surface was in the laboratory, not including the water itself but with Cauldron One, Two and Three their surfaces were disturbed and Potter wouldn’t see a thing about his new fashion choices.
If someone tried to cast a curse, would it miss – not because they could no longer see him but because Death couldn’t? Were they truly gifts instead of inventions of geniuses long forgotten?
Harry didn’t waver, of course he bloody didn’t. Maybe it was the expression or maybe Draco was exhausted and tired like he had been before decades ago and his last hope of freedom lay at Harry’s feet. Scorpius seemed to reground himself at Harry’s calm demeanour.
And then Draco was dragged into the Muggle world by Neville bloody Longbottom and Draco wanted nothing more than his normal clothing – the lack of cloak and robes was uncomfortable – and the whole time Neville watched him. As if he was a wild dog who’d turn on the mundane as soon they wandered too close.
I really dislike the whole romantizing mental illness/trauma and stuff so, yeah, they were both gonna go their separate ways for their own health. Draco needed a proper friend, Harry needed someone who would hold him accountable. Which is one of the reasons I didn't want to end an update on them breaking up? In case it got super frustrating and someone might think I was just keeping it going etc.
Draco shook his head, he’d done this sort of thing since he was seven. Parties were easy, smile and chat. Siobhan didn’t seem used to her hair out of its confines and began to curl her hair behind her ears. “It looks good, you know. Don’t fuss over it,” Draco whispered, knowing how his wife had a problem wearing scarfs thinking they made her look ‘frumpy’ whatever in Merlin’s name that meant.
“I’m not.” Neville had to show his screen to prove it. Draco didn’t look, the screen and its words were moving too much to focus on.
Neville laughed and Draco found himself uncomfortable at the idea he too would laugh about his parents like that when the day came. “More than most gave me. Gotta admit though,” he sighed and sunk into himself. “I was a bit relieved. They weren’t good near the end.”
“I’m comfy where I am.” Blaise did look so but Draco might not know how Potter thought over and prioritised tasks. He most certainly would not allow Draco to so much as mention the magic menace if Blaise was here.
Whether Harry was trying to wrangle some details on what he and Neville were doing- nice to know he was clueless to the Muggles in this equation – or simply keep away from the previous topic of- Ah, no. He wouldn’t say a word.
With orders given and well received if the cry of anger and the booming bark said anything, Draco went to the Healer he’d decided on. Waiting rooms weren’t for Draco so he went inside, found the place ten minutes behind and left to find himself walking back towards the Floo and back to the clinic. He'd searched around, found this one and read up on him a bit. Nothing too extensive.
“Get out.” And whether it was the tone or maybe very annoyed wizards gave off a particular smell, Decimus charged out, barking and snarling, tails high, maw upturned and teeth gleaming. To those who did not know, Decimus seemed to assume every human out in the garden would apparate away for it to give chase and play.
“Didn’t you make a potion for that?” Harry’s question broke his careful concentration and he’d jumped, a pain flared down his neck.
This is first part -- wasn't going to split this up but it just kept going and going and going and yeah. Big chapter for you all. <3 Next one is similar in length too. :0
“I’m going to walk up the stairs.” Harry spoke in the manner he always did. Confident, so self-assured Draco was expecting him to march, healed and have no trouble. What he got was a shaking-limbed man, much that reminded Draco of a newborn owl which couldn’t stand, but flailed their wings and fell over unable to hold their own weight.
Boris wasn’t anyone, anymore. The man once called Boris Boon was no longer welcome in the British Wizarding World. Draco had seen his true face, one he’d tried to hide in order to befriend Scorpius. All so he could pilfer from the Manor. Well, try to, and even then Draco was being generous. Only a twenty-something idiot and the Manor had rejected him as soon as he’d neared the Dark Artefacts. Idiot didn’t realise Scorpius was a trusting soul but he wasn’t stupid. These days mentioning Boris only meant one thing.
“You really,” Harry sighed and it weighed Draco down by his feet. “I really didn’t say any of that. I’ll leave it up to you.” Harry’s smile might not be as broad but it was there, still, taunting Draco all over again. “Does this mean you’re actually, really, thinking about it?”
“Stop ignoring me.” Okay, Potter was nuts, absolutely gone off the bend. Extreme irritability coupled with, what? What even did this stem from? Being told his idea was shit? Draco kept his eyes on Potter, whose face twisted in fury.
“Only if we catch it in our hands, so don’t be coughing it up and acting like you meant it.” First game Potter ever played he caught to Snitch in his mouth. How ridiculous. The fact Wood tried to play it off as some sort of meaningful celebration was worse.
Draco couldn’t say it wasn’t. It would explain Harry's overbearing nature towards Albus as Ginny had said.
Another week passed and Draco was glad at the routine which allowed him to squirrel himself away in his lab following no interruptions. Sixty potions and counting and Draco understood Charlie Weasley’s desperation. Either the potion’s half life was too short and would be ineffective lasting a whole night or the ingredients themselves counteracted with each other and boiled over.
It would be so easy to do so. Draco sighed, losing the energy he had for this. Honestly, he just wanted to feel better. “I want to stop panicking, stop second guessing everything anyone ever says or what I think. You do what you need to do, Harry. But I can’t keep going on like this. I can’t just – just want you for the rest of my life because I trust only you and hide away whenever you aren’t there because everything else is too much.”
Groaning and grumbling, Scorpius picked himself up from the floor as if Draco had demanded him to clean the Manor on his own, the Muggleway. Whether he truly was tired or put it on, Scorpius stood on ghost-shoes and never fixed his hunched postures.
“Really? The fourth one?” He couldn’t see many of the seeds left, too much magic pulsed in the air for them to germinate completely and they’d vanished. Draco only saw a few which survived being alone with Harry. Three was an impressive feat Draco hadn’t heard of much - four was never a goal ever brought up. Back when Draco had used them, he’d been less than happy at his one tree, one-seedling and everyone else clamoured it was a strong first attempt. He’d been wowed at one of the guests - some foreigner, his mother had shooed him away at every moment when he had claimed to achieve two.
“Ignore him,” Albus said firm and much like Harry was, unyielding to hear whatever Blaise had to say.
“I wouldn’t expect anything less of you Lotty.” While Decimus tilted its head at her and her sobbing, Draco continued despite the noise of her blowing her nose on her clothing.
And then his neck prickled and he sighed through his nose and hoped no one but Luna heard it. “Harry’s looking over here isn’t he?” He sipped at his champagne and loathed the way his night was going. If Harry kept up with this then everyone was going to be asking what Draco had done wrong, which might very well translate over to Hermione couldn’t be trusted.
What exactly was he supposed to do with the information Harry might want to get off with him right there and then in a house no one knew existed. Why? How? Draco hadn’t heard Harry being interested in men. Only the names of girls back in Hogwarts made their way through the gossip mills and managed to be overheard by a Slytherin. What was more likely was Harry had mistaken Draco’s care for romantic affection.
“Fucking hell,” Harry breathed out, and now frantic he started to check them with a panicked energy, “Fuck. I’m-- the worst.” Harry started to sign them. Slow, as if deliberating and lost in thought. Draco couldn’t believe this, this laziness. Illness was a fine excuse for having shit work. Not working at all, letting the lower staff sneak and cover up for his lack of - of anything was infuriating. What the fuck was Potter’s problem? Not the Golden Boy anymore?
Where was she? He hopped over another, sat on a chair and listened. Where was she? She was panicking, it was a fast noise he was searching for, something scurrying for their lives. There. She’d made a terrible error in trying to move from one row to the next row of tables and chairs.
What he didn’t expect was the drink going over him but all it did was make him scoff. Muggles were strange. How was this anything worth doing? He could magic this away in seconds. How did Muggles typically react to this? Because a spectacle was made, that all the other Muggles hushed or whispered and watched, and two other Muggles rushed over - a manager throwing the other out, another checking on Draco’s wellbeing.
?” Blaise rubbed at his forehead, frowning. “Fuck. What’s even happening? Really? A fucking year, gone and this is so--”
Luna was one of the few who Draco held any real affection for - Hermione had his respect and impressed him nearly each week - but it was Luna’s forgiveness that had done more in helping Draco pick up the pieces of what he wanted himself to be, of the man he could be. If not for Luna’s reply, Draco wouldn’t have bothered to have sent letters to everyone who deserved an apology. Unlike Luna’s gracious response most returned unanswered and some unread. But her lacking in revenge, in hate for keeping her in the Manor’s dungeon was a kindness Draco hadn’t felt or would feel for years after.
And it was somewhere around his fifth bottle when the thought of staying here wasn’t so bad. No awful memories to conjure up, none at all. Just having to deal with Harry using the shower for hours upon end. How he hadn’t run through the world’s water supply, Draco would never know.
Upon seeing her father, she called out, eyes-wide, “Mum! Dad’s here!” And off she went further into the house, leaving the door open and Harry scowling but still to break his silence. Ginny didn’t so much as offer Draco a glance as she marched over to Harry, practically scooped him out of Draco’s hands.
Draco’s animagus form was unregistered. One: he wasn't a dragon. So, his boyhood dream was ruined. Thanks, Father for another false expectation. Two: he was an owl. A creature made to deliver correspondents and late birthday gifts. Excuse him for not wanting to register with an already judgemental group of the Ministry of Magic. If Weasley ever found out, he’d never hear the end of this. The idea he would break laws as an owl was a strange one. All he wanted to do was fly. Not steal or eavesdrop into bland conversation. Whatever Draco thought his life would hold for him, it was not being stuck in a cage in the middle of
“I’ve only thought I’m going to die twice in my life, Potter and this was one of them. It’s called a Smothering Cold for a reason.”
What a facetious prick, fine. “Like someone needs to remind you that you’re the idiot who was drinking dragonblood.” It had the opposite effect as Harry laughed again. Thankfully Hermione appeared alongside Goven and Draco didn’t have the opportunity to murder the man.
Showing a few more proved a waste. Albus had sat with the parchment to Marco Glass, glancing down at it despite other names in the air.
Scorpius attended the crup’s need for another scrap of attention before he stood. Maybe, if Scorpius wasn’t such a sensitive child used to seeing Draco’s moods and picking up on habits of his mother, he would have ignored the words and moved on. Pretended it had happened. Left it as a conversation never had but always remembered. But he gave him an answer instead of letting Draco wallow in possibilities of how to gain Scorpius’ forgiveness.
Wednesdays and Fridays were the days he bugged Luna. Keeping away from her strange contraptions. The rest were spent seeing to Decimus and ordering Lotty around to keep them both sane and settled. When he needed it, he arranged a time with Matthews, the Mind-Healer. Times were unusual. Sometimes twice in a day the other, once in a month.
The potions was finished in the early hours of the morning and Harry sent a Patronus away tagged with a message. To who, Draco never saw or heard and for the most part he didn't really care. Until Harry could turn around and say the two of them were locked up or dead he didn't want to hear about them. Not yet, not with his sense of security in shambles and his confidence shaken.
“You can leave him here in Lotty’s care, I gather you won’t be too long. You do still have a job to do.” Draco wasn’t satisfied at Siobhan’s retreating pout. He half wanted Astoria to raise from her grave and hex her into oblivion. Did he look like someone who was easily swayed by a pretty face? Don’t make him laugh. The most beautiful woman in the world was his wife - a little, pathetic and too fake a smile did nothing but sour his affections.
Now, warring against someone else was easy. everything they did was dumb, stupid, idiotic, not good enough. Draco knew, absolutely for certain Harry had no control over his magical outburst - it wasn’t his fault Charlie put dragonblood in the potions Harry asked for. It was also Harry’s fault Scorpius might’ve been hurt, dangerously so.
“I just did.” He turned on his heel and left this animal be, what a disappointment. Harry grabbed him by the arm and pulled him toward yet another, and another, and another strange creature. And Draco made more snipes at the animals than the Muggles milling around.
He shouldn’t have said a word. He shouldn’t have come here. He wasn’t writing this statement and he wasn’t going to cause more problems for Harry. Forget this.
“Just so you know, I refuse to do this sort of manual labour.” Standing by, Harry seemed far too happy over washing dishes. He didn’t understand at all. Muggles were all mad. Harry was mad. “Ever.”
“You look like shit,” Blaise whispered into his ear and Draco laughed. This was his house, this was his and if Blaise or Potter tried to make him feel unable to do whatever he wanted, he’d have the Manor remove them for him. Blaise was forgetting his place as a guest.
’ Neville invited him over, to join in and there’s no reply, no text till several days later. By then, it’s long texts of Quidditch and eventually devolves around the mention of Hannah. And then, Neville’s answer grows longer, snippy almost in a manner Draco saw as an argument they’d had before but never finished. Some more deleted messages litter their go betweens.
“Yes,” Harry said, all Gryffindor and awaiting a false step where he’d need to point out mistakes and act superior (but also act like he wasn’t acting superior because only Slytherins did that). And Draco tried to keep the smirk off his face, trap already sprung. “Neville talked people round though,” Harry added in caution.
“He can have whatever he wants; I don’t want to hear ‘boo-hoo where’s the seafoam?’ one more time.” Astoria tried her best not to laugh and Draco was well aware he wasn’t the only one who wanted to launch this book out of the window and tell Scorpius it must have disappeared because a pixie took it. Neither of them did, they kept reading the adventure of Charmy, the Changeling and hated every second of it.
“Anything not about how much money he has?” Harry huffed and Draco wasn’t sure why. Wasn’t Potter still minted? He held more fortune than Draco did and from what the Prophet and ever interview given Harry never seemed to splurge on expenses. So, why was he annoyed at Draco’s fortune?
“Ron.” Harry stood up, alarm in his voice. “What are you doing?” The stack whittled down to a dozen or so, hanging static in the air.
“Wherever you want to go.” And that was the problem. Where did Draco want to go that wasn’t filled with people? Who might ask questions, tell tales to the papers, cause more problems? When all Draco needed to do was stay inside. No one could accuse him of being too arrogant, too meddling. Quidditch results could be read in the paper, highlights bought in picture form. Would he like to go to a Quidditch match? Yes, of bloody course he would. Would he tell Harry? No. Because Harry would try and take him there and Draco couldn’t handle that level of -- of people.
“I got you, I got you--” He wasn’t making much sense until he knelt down and started trying to undo the knot himself. Draco stayed on one leg, keeping the other raised and in eyesight. Of all the things Draco missed, he missed thumbs. Potter had untied him, drunk and was faster than the beak would ever be. “--All done!” Flexing his foot it would seem Potter hadn't ripped it off or caused irreparable nerve damage. Now if only his healing spells were as kind.
