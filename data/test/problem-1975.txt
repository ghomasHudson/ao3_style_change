The man heard the loud banging coming from the small door underneath the stairs he swung the door open ignoring the protest of the disgusting woman behind telling him to get out of her house. He blasted the door open and the sight horrified him; there in the small space was a small young boy beaten and bleeding not a single spot on the young boy was free of some sort of injury. What caught his attention the most was the boy’s eyes, the same color as his Lily’s was. The man swung his venomous gaze upon the woman who now had her mouth clamp shut not a single sound leave, as she stared not in horror of the state of the boy, but in place rage.

Another wild ride and they stopped at their next stop.
“Well Severus, why don’t you go change, and we will finish our tea while waiting,” Narcissa said, looking at Severus still in his teaching robes, there was no way that she would let him go out looking like that. With the holidays right around the corner no less. Severus just smirked, nodding his head, knowing that anything he would say would either prompt her to help pick out the clothes, or even would just fall on deaf ears.
"Come here child, there is nothing to be scared of." Severus said softly to coax the small child from his hiding place underneath the bed, "There is no one here to hurt you, you do not have to be afraid."
“Of course, young Lord Potter. I would be more than happy to take you down to the lower vaults.”
“Key please,” The young goblin said, holding out his hand to both wizards. Harry handed his key to the goblin and watched the process as the goblin opened the vault.
* * * *
His Aunt thought about this for a moment, if the boy wasn’t back in time then he would be punished also if he didn’t have the chores done as well, she couldn’t help the smirk that formed upon her face at the thought.
“No Harry, we cannot do that! We came down here together so we are going through together!” Gemma snapped, glaring at the younger boy.
But yeah tell me if shorter chapters will be better then months with no chapter? <3
“I am sorry sir, I wanted to come see Levi and talk to him for a bit, I hope you do not mind that I brought Draco along.” Harry said in a tiny voice, unsure if he had done something wrong, something that Snape might not approve of.
Harry has never known such things in his life, and was overwhelmed by the kindness Draco was showing him, so he could only nod at what the boy was saying. It wasn’t long before Milly popped in the room once again to inform them that dinner was about ready, and they made their way back down to the dining area.
“Yes alpha all yours, very good alpha for giving me a pup.” The Omega babbled, Draco just hummed as he reach for Harry cock slowly stroking it to full mast. The omega gave a needy whine at the attention; Draco just smirked and slowly brought them to the edge of the bed and sat Harry’s back flushed against his check. Draco placed two fingers near Harry’s mouth how greedy start to suck with no further instruction.
“Harry!” Harry snapped his gaze back up to Draco who was just staring at him from his seat across the library table. They had come in here to find out about the three head dog that was on the 3 floor. Fred and George told them about it when they played a prank and Flinch was chasing them around the castle. They hid behind the door just to find a giant three headed dog growling and drooling in front of them. Of course they didn’t believe them, but here they are sitting at the library to find out what type of mythical creature they had made up.
Harry’s eyes widen at what Draco had said. “N-NO! Y-You don’t have to do that, they are your clothes after all.” Harry felt bad that Draco was going to give him some clothes, he had no way to pay him back for his kindness.
Much to Severus disappointment though, Lucius decided to hang around with him instead of his wife and the boys. So he was forced to listen to the blonde man, talk about almost nothing, while he shopped around for the ingredients, well until one part caught his attention.
“Please wait a few moments Sirs, the goblin in charge should be here shortly.” Ironfist said, leaving the three wizards to talk amongst themselves while they waited.
The rest of the class was peaceful, Ron was sulking through the class upset that he was picked on during the time, and knowing that he wasn’t the only one that didn’t read from the textbook just yet. Draco and Harry only snickered at the sulking Gryffindor and went about talking the notes from class to ready themselves from when brewing sections of the course. The first potion that they were tasked in making was a potion to cure boils. They had just started to separate into their different groups, the two odd ball Gryffindors sat with the first year Slytherins, with few strange looks cast, but they just shrugged it off when Draco and Harry started to talk with them. Half way through the brewing, Snape was just scowling over everyone’s shoulders, a few comments here and there about what they were doing wrong. Harry’s and Draco’s potions where looking just right, so was Hermione’s and Pansy’s, who had partner up with her. Neville was having a harder time and had a darker smoke color then what it was supposed to be, but it was still a good potion.
“Why do you think Headmaster put those other teachers down here, such as Hagrid and Quirrell, and not any other teacher? Why not just stick with the Head of Houses?” Harry pondered this thought aloud. Both Gemma and Draco froze in step, causing Harry to run into them. That was a good question; of course, the old coot would do something like that.
I didn’t know what was happening nor where I was as the contraction became worse with each passing one, I held on to Draco’s hand as a life line as I breathe through each one as I instructed by our healer. I heard a commotion of beeps and bells before I heard the scary words from our healer,
“Of course Harry, they are not mad. In fact it was them that came to us about the papers that are being put together and having a goblin to talk about the gold flow from your accounts in the other areas without consulting you first.” Severus said, explaining something that shouldn’t be talked about just yet since it was after all very close to Christmas. “But that is a talk for another time young one, for now how about we get you ready for dinner?” Severus smiled motioned to the clothes that where set out for the younger wizard, while he slumbered.
“I would like that Alec… I’m so tired,” Harry answered laying his head back down on Alec’s shoulder letting out a yawn. His body wanting to sleep, but his mind so afraid. Alec just smiled and gently rubbed Harry’s back allowing his magic to flow through his hand into Harry gently coaxing him in to a dreamless state. He gently placed Harry back into his bed and tucked him in. Levi took it upon himself to drape his massive body over the boy, gently as he didn’t want to hurt Harry. Neit hopped up from her hiding spot underneath the bed taking her place right by his head curling up purring.
With a nod from Harry, Severus apparated to King’s Cross train station. To Severus this was a normal thing, and didn’t think much about it anymore, to Harry just another wizarding away to get around he hated; to him it was like being sucked in a vacuum and everything being distorted with the world spinning around you then all of the sudden you are spit out in a random location. Harry was trying not to let his breakfast to come back up, but was having difficulty with Severus dragging him off.
“STUPID SNAPE! IF YOU DO NOT GET BACK HERE I WILL SICK MOTHER ONE YOU!” Draco yelled at the figure, very angry at Harry for going on alone, biting his lip in fear of what would happen to the boy if he wasn’t there to watch him.
1. Sick!Harry such as cancer or something like that

The two older Malfoy’s looked up at Severus begging for information on why there was this thing hanging on the boy, and the boy letting it happen instead of screaming.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry thoughts were swirling once again, thoughts of everything that his
Dinner of course was amazing shortly after I started dinner Draco showed up, and kept Luna company as I made dinner, her telling him all those adventure she went one. Draco of course asked her if when she left again if she could bring him back some Potion supplies, and he would pay her for her troubles.
“T-Thanks.” Harry said, looking from Fred to his twin, pushing his hair out of his face to get a better look at the two.
Hello lovelies~~ Yay I posted on time today maybe even earlier... Yeah I posted earlier I need to go back to bed x.x anyways enough of me complaining it's a chapter and the second week in a row! yay!! I should be getting back on schedule, kinda of, I am back at college moved in just yesterday and classes start Monday. So hopefully I can start posting again, and being able to type chapter! Thanks goes out to my beta as always, thank you hun without you my chapter will only be half of what the reader sees :)
Today was the first outing I would have since coming to Malfoy Manor.  I was both nervous and excited. Nervous because it has only been over a week since I left the Dursley’s and while I have had the best potions money could buy; courtesy of Severus Snape (our relationship is slowly on the mend, even though he still thinks that I am a dunderhead. Who knew that he had such a morbid sense of humor!) along with the best mate one could ask for, in both emotional/mental health as well as physical health, it was still a worry. Even if this was just a short trip to Gringotts bank. Even though I’m pretty sure Cissa (she corrects me every time I do not call her that) was wanting to go shopping in celebration after we figure everything out.
Draco pulled his wand and cast every spell he could think of at the wall in an attempt to escape, but it was futile, there was no sign of a door appearing and no one would look for them since everyone was asleep.
This is an extremely short chapter, I fought with this chapter and deleted it about 20 times over. This is the best I've gotten from it, but next chapter will be longer. But this chapter was needed, hope you can forgive me. Also I am sorry for the long wait again between chapters, November was a bad month for me RL was too much and I stepped back from the internet for that month. Also the poll is still going since we haven't Theo didn't find his mate this chapter! tell me in the comments
Harry froze at the sight of the large building that seemed to pop out of nowhere, he would have liked to just stand there and stare in awe, but Severus wasn’t going to have that. Instead he grabbed the young wizards arm and dragged him into the building, out of the boisterous street. When they entered the large building, Harry was shocked that the workers were short, old looking creatures with pointed ears and sharp teeth, all wearing similar grumpy expressions when dealing with wizards.
“Sorry Draco, I was thinking about Christmas.” Harry gave his friend a shy smile, “I’m just really excited about it since this will be my first Christmas.”
“W-W-Who w-was in ch-charge of my accounts?” Harry asked, his voice breathy and strained. He had to know, this was the same person that stuck him with those people as well.
Severus eyes narrowed at this,
Draco stood there glaring at the wall for a good 30 minutes hoping in vain that something would show, but it stayed the same lifeless grey stone as before, as if there was never a door there. It was then that he very reluctantly made his way over to the warm fire and smell of sweets. It would have been a lot better if he didn’t have to share this time with Potter, but it does really beat spending Christmas alone, he thinks.
“Got that right in one, I am going to miss her, it has been her and I against the world for a long while. Who will be my go to person when she isn’t there?” Harry said with a sigh, already missing her even though he knew she would always be there for him.
While he did this, his Papa and Tom ordered a light snack from the elves. along with hot drinks; tea for them and hot coco for the raven-haired boy. As soon as Harry was through they gathered him up and sat with him, much like the first time they found out, talking with the young wizard and wished him better dreams when they saw him drift off once more. Knowing no more dreams would come, since Severus took it upon himself to spike his coco with a small amount of Dreamless sleep potion.
“We missed you too, Kitten,” the twins said together, giving the raven haired boy a hug and smiling at him.
Thank you for reading all that, I know I know it was a lot, but I think you should know what is up with everything and why I haven't been answering comments or seemed distance compared to when I usually do answer I do hope you stick with me through all this and will continue to read even though there might be VERY long breaks between updates. Well know for now I will let you go read this chapter.
Now he turned to Harry, looking him up and down his brow farrowed a bit thinking of any wands that could fit this young wizard. “Let’s see.” He turned around and rummaged through his wands. “Try this one.” He said handing a wand to the boy.
Severus was out hunting down potion ingredients for Harry, after watching the boy all day he noticed that the boy had a hard time seeing things from his left side. He wanted the boy to have an easier life now that he was away from those muggles, and to do so was to erase all the damage they have done to the poor boy. So Severus thought that he would surprise the young boy with a healing potion, he wasn’t sure how bad the damage was and wouldn’t know till they were back at his manor, so Severus just bought all the ingredients he thought he would need.
Harry just nodded looking back down to the ground. Severus sighed, knowing that he wouldn’t get the boy to talk about last night at the moment. “Alright Harry, after dinner tonight I would like if you would come down to my rooms so that we can talk about it.” Harry just nodded once again, not really saying anything. Severus dismissed both boys after getting Harry to eat some breakfast and his potion. Severus was deeply concerned for him, and decided that it was time to write his friend about action that needed to be made.
* * *
* * *
“I-I-I,” I swallowed the lump forming in my throat. “Sir, I’ve never received something like that.”
“You will leave this child alone, and go about your own business.” Severus said, his voice was low, growling right into the man’s ear. “I will deal with you another date, but for now.” He shoved the muggle away from Harry, the Malfoy’s where all standing at this point glaring at the man. Vernon would not have it.
Severus sighed, “No, term ended about a day ago, but we brought you here as soon as we got you out of the chambers, claiming that you where ill. As for the rest, I guess we will start with Levi. After he left you, he went to Tom to tell him that everything was going according to plan, but when he arrived there was a slight problem. It seemed like our Headmaster noticed what was going on, and cornered Tom in his office, of course this led into a standoff between the two, some curses flew and Tom had to make a quick getaway. Since the Headmaster’s plan fell through, he had to conjure up a fake and have it take Tom’s place when you got to the mirror, hoping that you would come back to the light side if you saw the Dark Lord. So, when the fake turned to ash he set off a delay reaction to seem as if the Dark Lord left his body, and when it went through you left lots of magical residue, as well as some charms. Some included some sort of control charm, a leech charm to slowly drain your magic, and some others of that nature. This was in the hope that it would bring you to his side and under his control.” Severus finished, “We are still in the process taking the charms off of you, but it’s proving to be difficult. We were starting to get worried the longer you slept, in fear we missed something else, but it proves it was just you magic replenishing itself after the shock it received when all those spells hit you at once.”
November was an affair in itself Blaise, knowing he found the right person proposed to Hermione who of course said yes. A small party held in congratulation turned into a wedding planning for Hermione wanted to end the year on a high note, when it began on such a low one. Harry didn’t blame her and was happy that this year did a 180 on them. It was a scramble Harry was Hermione best man, because he refused to be a maid of honor.
“You protect that freak all you want, but in the end he will come back with me, since he is to live with us!”
Hello Lovelies! I hope that you had a good week :) I am posting on time once again yay! Lets hope that I can keep this up. It is a short chapter, was not able to write that much due to all the Math Homework that I was given the two days I have that class :(. I am going to try to get a longer chapter next week since I haven't had one in a long time, but we will see how the week goes for me. quick Thanks to my beta for reading over this you are the best! Now on to the chapter.
“Be still, don’t move!” the alpha ordered, his own cock twitching again within the omega, “sleep we have plenty of time little one. I will give you pups don’t worry.”
“Sev, I have a question.” Harry simply stated, Severus lifted his chin up a bit to indicate that the child should continue on, “I-I was wondering if you know anything about the Philosopher’s Stone? T-The Dark Lord has asked me to read up on it.”
Presents? What was he talking about? No one gave him presents… Harry’s eyes flew open today was Christmas, today was the start of spending holidays with his new family! Harry quickly sat up, causing Draco to roll off the bed letting out an “eep” while in the free fall.
Both Harry and Draco snorted, they both thought Ron was acting like a spoiled brat. He was flicking his wand at the feather like a windmill, his face growing as red as his hair.
His Aunt quickly slammed the phone back into the receiver and glared at the boy like it was his fault.
“Well done, Lord Potter-Black. It seems the ring of Merlin has bonded itself to you, accepting you as its new owner. Many have tried, but only you have succeeded such a feat. You are indeed destined for remarkable things.”
Severus produced a golden key from one of his many hidden pockets, handing it to the goblin, trying to snarl when he felt the tight clamp of the greedy goblins hand around the key.
10/10/20
After a couple more wands, Harry felt like giving up, there hasn’t been one that he liked. At this point Narcissa and Draco had retreated outside after paying for Draco’s wand, the kitten following them as well, as each wand produced a new catastrophic effect. Ollivander frown grew grave as he thought of a wand and went to retrieve it, of course he knew this was the one for boy, but it was curious.
* * *
“I am sorry to hear that, please take a seat Luna tell me more about your adventure to South America,” I smiled up at her waving my hand to the empty chair across from me.
“I guess, come on lets head into my room,” Draco said opening his door, to reveal a large room, too big for a single person to live in, it even had its own connecting bathroom. Harry couldn’t help but to look at everything the blonde had in his room, he had a king size bed with a large canopy over it with silver drapes hanging off of it, a moving dragon painted on his wall that was currently asleep making smoke rings with his nose.
Draco removed his fingers from Harry’s mouth and went to remove the butt plug from his omega. “such as good boy, all ready for me Draco said as he lifted Harry on to his cock. Harry was to entrap in the mirror moaning eye half lidded as he watch himself sink onto Draco’s cock the alpha big cock disappearing deep into him. His already full womb almost felt like bursting Harry gave a whine. “so full already but I know you want more, don’t you omega.”
* * *
It was an hour later before both boys closed their books, there parchment brimming with information waiting to be turned in. Levi and Neit had fallen to sleep as soon as the boys started on their work. Severus had brought out a recently published potions journal and was reading it keeping an eye on both boys to make sure that they did their work, and not goof off.
“Fred! George! I missed you!” Harry said hugging both of them, Harry hadn’t been given a chance to talk to the twins before the Christmas break, besides them telling them about the beast in the third floor. Everyone was busy with exams, or, in the twins case, they were busy pranking everybody.
Mr. Malfoy (I still could not bring myself to call him his given name just yet) said we would wait and see since we have no idea how long it would take to talk to the goblins.
“Before,”
Harry had silent tears running down his face, Levi was hissing at his hatchling encouraging him to tell his Papa, but he couldn’t. He couldn’t bear to see their disappointed faces at the adoption of a freak.
“Severus listen I am sorry we were just celebrating the new dark successes, and someone slipped him…” Barty froze eyes ranking the room first the dark lord in tears, Draco now stripping Severus with a raging hard on and last Harry’s naked form… Severus eyes swinged back to Harry when did he lose the chaps?!  Barty slowly back towards the floo, “I-I see ehhhh have a good night.”
Severus looked over at Narcissa and gave her a nod of thanks. Then he turned his attention back on Harry. “Of course Harry, where ever you want to go, I will follow.”
“36!” His uncle answered happily,” Counted them myself.”
“We have someone laying,” another one said
Next was the man, he was tall and thin, with a thick head of black hair that seem to have a mind of its own, much like Harry’s before he took the blood adoption potion. He also had glasses on that seemed to match Harry’s. He knew that the figures that stood before him was his mum and dad, his real parents. Why where they here?! His whole-body trembled as he tried to fight back tears. He could stay there forever, but at the same time, he couldn’t. “I-I-I’m sorry,” was all he said before he rushed out the door, grabbing the cloak and going back to his rooms.
“D-Draco…” I called knowing that he had left the room for something, another pain ripped through my body knocking the breath from me, “Draco!” I screamed now try to breathe through the pain like the healer said when labor started, how come I didn’t realize this sooner?
Till next week!
Severus knew this was a lot harder for him to take in, he feared for both his own safety and now the safety of his son. All he wanted was the truth of what happened that night. Everything he was told could be a lie. He was caught between his master, the one he served faithfully until he was going to target the women he loved, and the old geezer who saved him from everything, but asked too much in return. He had to put his faith in one of these two men, and with that it wasn’t even a promise that Harry would be safe in the end. That was his concern, he didn’t care about his own safety that much, but whatever side had the greatest power to protect Harry was all that mattered. Severus sighed, his mind running in circles already, for he had no proof, he only had to go with what his mind and heart believed to be the best. That, and whatever choice that Harry had as well, since this was also going to be affecting him in the long run, as well.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What a sad day, 10 points from Gryffindor for coming to class without opening your book, Mr. Weasley.” Severus said, looking around the room spying the students that knew the answers and who didn’t. He turned his eye to his young charge, “How about you, Mr. Potter do you know the answers to any of the questions I just asked?”
The words echoed in Harry’s mind as the snake left and in its place a very angry Vernon staring down at the boy in disgust.
As soon as they said that, another red head opened the car, looking at the other three redheads with displeasure.
After the meeting, both Harry and Severus escaped into their own thoughts thinking about the meeting with the Dark Lord. Harry wanted to know who the 3 strangers in his room that night could be. The first person was the Dark Lord, the second one was also obvious, the headmaster, but who was the third person?
“I-I was wondering how I was going to pay for my school supplies… I-I have no money.” The boy’s voice was barely above a whisper, but to Severus the boy was yelling. Did those muggles really never tell him about his life or his parents?
“Come in,” He heard Severus call. He pushed the door open to reveal the potions room. It was his first time in the room as he hadn’t had Potions yet. There were station like work areas that severed as the sitting for the class, each bench could have two groups of two at each, working together, and a sink in between them. There were also potion ingredients and strange looking animals in the jars on either side of the classroom to give it an ominous feeling to it.
The whole hall was quite till the end of the hats song, before applauding and cheering. It bowed to each of the tables as if it knew how great it was, before going still once again.
Harry just nodded, they weren’t there for much longer after that, leaving to go separate ways.
“A-Aunt Petunia,” Harry said making sure to keep his head down low, shuffling his feet a little against the floor, his Aunt looked up at the boy in disgust, “I-I was wondering if I could go to the park today?” He mumbled knowing that he was taking a chance, with asking about going out, but he knew that his Aunt didn’t want to be left alone with him for the day, and that she would do anything to get him out of her hair for the. Of course she would leave him with Mrs. Figg most of the time to go talk with some of the other women that lived in the neighborhood, to gossip about the things going around them.
“I-I was w-wondering, d-do you think my mum and dad would see me as weak?” Harry mumbled into Severus thick outer teaching cloak.
The owner of the establishment had enough and walked over to the two families, and spoke directly to the Durley’s. “If you would kindly leave, before we call the police. We do not take well for threats thrown at our customers, nor threats thrown at children; and you sir have done both!”
The boy quickly wraps up the conversation with Levi and picking up Neit, before she could try to attack Levi’s tail once more. He sat on the couch adjacent to Severus’ chair. Neit is more than happy to cuddle up with her favorite human and take a nap, felling his fingers comb through her fur; with the soft purrs of the kitten, and the crackling of the fire, it would make for a very nice night. Harry wished that they could just enjoy the peace for a while longer, but knew that he had to ask now, before the chance is taken away.
“Morning,” I replied fighting back a yawn, as I slowly sat up in our bed. Draco walked around to the bed leaving the room once again to get dressed. I slowly pushed myself out our bed but have difficulties now that I was in my final month. I couldn’t wait till I held my little one in my arms, and see their face. Draco came to my rescue just then helping me escape the confinements of our bed.
Last, but not least, Merlin’s ring. I felt the power of the ring from here, I was almost afraid to place it on my finger. I swallowed my fear and reached out to the ring. I shivered as I felt the powerful magic run through my body. Just from that, I was wondering how in the world Merlin’s ring would accept me, I am nowhere near as powerful nor am I deserving of this ring. I slowly slipped the ring on my finger; my vision danced as the magic invaded my body. For a moment, I thought I was sucked into the ring as I saw the starry magic invade my vision. I felt as if I was one with magic, things I should not have known were now in my head. It was like I was seeing magic herself. Then as sudden as it started, it ended, leaving my body exhausted and at the same time, empowered. I blinked a couple of times to clear my vision and I saw the Malfoys looking at me with great concern, while the Goblin was standing up at his desk observing the happenings. At first, I was disappointed, thinking the ring denied me, but as I reached for it, the room lit up from the burst of galaxy colours and the ring grew warm and tightened itself around my finger.
* * *
Severus’s arms tightened around Harry’s small waist when he heard that. He could feel Harry start to shake at the news.
The way Tom and Severus stepped up in taking care of Harry, really helped the young wizard feel love and needed, something that he never felt before. Here he felt the love of a Papa, and possible a Father it really strengthens their bond as a family. All the while taking care of the bond for the son, the hidden bond between Tom and Severus began to grow as well. The unseen forces of drawing on strength from each other has taken hold and with out them seeing it Tom and Severus where ever so slowly falling for each other.
I took it and quickly pricked my finger, letting the blood drop upon the rings. Draco took the injured finger and placed it inside his mouth. I felt his tongue flick across the pad of my finger as he sucked on my finger, and I felt my face go red, a small whine almost escaping my throat, but I was able to contain it… barely. I glared at him, but I saw a mischievous glint in his eyes. He knew what this was doing to me.
Levi had placed himself around his small hatchling hissing to the child so that he could get a rest full sleep, and get back to his classes faster. It was the hissing that pulled the Dark Lord from his slumber, and the sight he saw shocked him. There upon the small child's bed was a snake that looked much like his old friend.
Draco was wandering the halls of Hogwarts. It was tough staying in the Slytherin dorms by himself, thoughts of Crabbe who lost his life due to the war along with his Godfather plagued him. He wished - to whatever gods he could think of - not to be alone, but here he was… Alone and wandering one of the many halls within Hogwarts. That is, when he sees a warm glowing light coming from inside a room, smells of treats wafting into the hall. He thought he might as well look inside to see what was going on.
“Look before your eyes Potter,” The voice spat at the boy, “Look at what you have done to me! You have left me without a body! The great Dark Lord had to go as low as surviving off of another being, and yet you escape with just a scare!” The Dark lord yelled at the boy, his raspy voice adding more to the effect of frightening the young wizard. “But I can forgive you Potter.”
“Harry will you ever land on your feet?” Severus asked one eyebrow cocked at the young boy who was still sprawled out on the floor. He was, however, glad that everyone was so focused on Harry’s fall that they didn’t recognize him and his scar.
“Good luck.”
“Hmmm, good question, I was not much into playing games since I was an only child, and loved to read more; but I would say checkers, it was easier to play than chess.” Alec said with a chuckle. This game continued for some time them asking simple questions of each other Harry becoming more and more relaxed after each question, there hadn’t been one he skipped just yet, but a few where he skirted around the question by answering it vaguely. “Alright Harry I have time for one more question, this one I will not allow you to skip, it’s almost a two-part question.” Alec said looking at the child before him. Harry took a deep breath, this was the moment he was dreading, there where so many question this person could ask now he had no way out. “It’s a simple question Harry nothing to be afraid of, but I have to know.” Harry gave curt nod, “Alright when was the last time you had a full night’s rest?” Harry let the tension out of his body, he could answer that it was easy, “S-sometime last week, or maybe a little longer than that.” Alec just nodded at Harry’s answer, “Why haven’t you had a full night’s rest?” Harry swallowed a lump in his throat, “N-Nightmares, m-memories really.” Harry said his voice cracking a little trying to get the words out past the lump,
“Vernon!”
Young Hatching it is good to hear you again, I have been trying for many days to get into contact with you, but something seems to have stoped it
~~Edit 06/14/2017 :) my awesome sweet beta sent the edited version! so here you go!
Time seems to by flying by everyone, after meeting with the Dark Lord, they settled down into a routine; the test, homework, and classes day in and day out. Harry and Draco let the stone slide to their back of their thoughts for the time being, enjoying being first years. They spent their time either studying with Hermione and Neville in the library or underneath the tree near the lake. The twins wouldn’t be left out when their Kitten was with the other lion cubs, so they joined in, if only to come up with pranks for their brother; Ron when he was sprouting nonsense about the Slytherin house targeting Harry specifically, or Percy who just had a stick up his arse, the twins enjoyed plotting with their small Kitten. Harry was enjoying the time with his friends, even sessions with Alec where mostly about his close group of friends and what they are doing around the school. Since talking about the muggles was still hard for Harry, but he was getting there. Some sessions where better than others, sometimes they would talk about his old guardians, others were strictly about what had happened lately. Harry thought by this summer he might be able to fully open up to Alec and tell him what happened there, or at least that is what he was hoping.
“Of course Draco, I’m sorry I worried you.” Harry said apologetically, though he couldn’t stop smiling.
“Good afternoon, Master Griphook, may your enemies blood coat your blades and their bodies fall at your feet,” I greeted the young goblin with a bow. Draco better be proud, his teaching is being put to use.

I will see you guys in the next chapter <3
Harry made it to the park with no problems, there were a few kids there playing around, but not enough to be worry anything about. He took a seat at one of his favorite swings and lifted the lid on the old tin box, inside there sat the letter. He took a deep breath and turned the letter over and saw a wax seal upon it; Harry frowned never in his life has ever seen a letter with a wax seal upon it, hesitantly he popped open the wax seal and took out the heavy paper inside.
It was now 11:50pm and while Harry enjoyed the time with friends and his sister, watching them push cake into each other face and laughing and enjoying the joys of being together. He needed an escape, don’t get him wrong he was happy for her, she deserved the world after all the years of dangerous stuff he put her through, and he would give it to her if he could. But now that was Blaise’s job and he would be left behind. It was a sad thought. He sipped his campaign as the cool night air kept him cool from the alcohol.
Heyy lovelies, I hope all is well with you guys! Look a new chapter and you didn't have to wait to long! Big thanks to my lovely friend for taking time to read over. Not much to put here so I'll let you get to reading!
The red head looked dumbly on at the professor, Harry was surprised that he didn’t see any drool rolling down his chin. Hermione’s hand shot up as soon as the question left the older wizards lips.
Severus just smirked as Harry’s face turned a shade of red, “Alright you two, get your homework done and I will make everyone some tea to pass the time.” Severus said before exiting to head to the small kitchen and leaving the boys right in front of the blazing fire, opening their books and taking out some parchment.
5/16/2019
“Alright, so let’s see where to start.” Severus said with a sigh, trying to think of a good place to start, without giving Harry too much detail about the circumstances surrounding his parent’s death. “Your parents had to go into hiding for fear of a man that was, er, insane. He was trying to get rid of anything and everything that he thought might ruin our society, so when he heard of news of someone being able to take him on he got scared. He and his followers went out and killed most of these people, and your family was one of them. That night, he came to your house and killed your mum and dad, but when he turned his wand on you, for some reason the spell backfired and caused a blast, you where there unharmed. A little baby taking on the Dark Lord, and surviving… The wizarding world was ecstatic, claiming you as the Boy-Who-Lived. Sadly, this left you as an orphan to the war; so Dumbledore took you to your only living family at the time, thinking that would be the best choice for you.” Severus said, having managed to keep most of the details out of story, there were things that the boy didn’t need to know right now. He would learn them of course, but one step at a time.
“Let us take a small break and have some lunch before proceeding to the healing room, if that is alright with you, Lord Malfoy.”
“Alright professor, I will,” Was the reply that he got. With a quick goodbye to the two younger wizards, Severus started on a plan to make sure that the crazy old headmaster would not ruin the first year of school for young Harry.
“Alright, you can come, but you must stay behind me the whole time, and no arguing at commands I give you, got it?” Draco just nodded following the Potions Master out through the teacher’s door, slowly making their way to the damp dungeons, keeping an ear out for trouble. As they rounded the corner leading to the bathroom, they heard a bloody curdling scream and the sound of destruction and terror coming from just inside the bathroom. Draco’s face blanched, as both he and Snape took off in a sprint. What they saw was horrifying. In the ruble of the stalls were two prone bodies and a humongous troll standing over them, club swinging in arc motion upward, preparing for another attack. Everything seemed to go slow motion from there, the club now coming down wards to the two prone bodies, Snape’s wand being swept out of his sleeve, words flowing from his mouth as Draco watched on. Those few seconds seemed like hours, and before he knew it the troll was lying on the floor. Still, Draco was frozen just reliving the seen. One that he would never forget, one where he almost watched his best friend die.
It was going to be a very busy day for all of them, so Harry didn’t need to spend his morning in the luxurious bed. He softly padded across the white fluffy carpet to the ensuite bathroom, Draco meanwhile rolled over to the warm spot Harry left in the bed frowning at the loss. The shower was one of the many things Harry had come to love while at the Malfoy’s. It wasn’t like one you found in the muggle world, being a magical shower, it had a sensory type magic knowing how hot the person wanted their shower how soft or hard the water came down as well. Unlike having a shower head like the muggle’s would use in a shower, it rain down straight from the ceiling. The first time Harry had to take a shower in it, he freaked out unsure of how to use it or what was happening; but he had fallen in love with the shower very fast since it was one of the many things Harry didn’t get to use a lot while staying with his relatives.
“We live to annoy.”
Even after the long night Harry had, he only had one thing on his mind,
Harry felt fingers cascade through his hair, startling him from his thoughts. “I am sorry little one.” Tom said, kneeling down to look at Harry’s face. “I know this is a lot to take in, and I know it is really confusing. I know trusting me is going to take some time, but not to worry, we have this summer to get to know one another better.” Tom said with a smile. Harry gave a small nod. “Now is there any questions you have, or would you rather take your potions and go back to sleep?”
“Alright Harry I will start,” Alec said with a smile, “What is your favorite color?”
“Slytherin, I thought you would have noticed.” Harry blushed at Alec’s statement, he of course put it together, but had to make sure, Alec just chuckled at Harry’s reaction, “What is your favorite thing to eat?”
Draco’s face paled, but he nodded. Of course, he would never try to hurt Harry, that was what he was there for, as a good friend, there to protect him and make sure he stayed out of trouble. That is all he felt for Harry was friendship… Right? He was just in first year, too young to worry about anything like what the twins were insinuating! So Draco just brushed those feelings off as brotherly feelings, one that would feel like he had to protect his younger brother; especially since he was family now, thanks to Uncle Sev adopting him. The twins just smiled, of course the young heir Malfoy could not think that way just yet; he was just a child.
Harry stiffened at the loud voice, quickly grabbing ahold of Severus’s cloak wanting to hide once again from everything. “B-But sir I can. H-He speaks like you or I do, just in a different language.” The boy cowered behind Severus, while the snake started hissing at the youth, trying to calm him down.
With a sigh Severus knew right away what the Dark Lord was up to, using the boy to get the stone where he was failing.
Hello lovelies and Welcome to chapter 6, sadly this might not be the chapter you are looking for, it is not the trip to Diagon Alley. Nope this is a sneak peak into the past since Harry still doesn't know anything; next chapter will be shopping with everyone :) Thanks again to my awesome Beta for reading through the chapter! And thank you for over 100 kudos!! I am really happy that you are loving the story!! Thank you everyone :)
Severus was a little shocked at Lucius for saying something like that, but knew that it was true. He shook his head, he knew that he had done everything he could, but maybe his friend’s wife could do something about it. He knew that Narcissa had at one time trained to be a healer as well as a mind healer, before she married his friend. He knew that he was taking a risk, on letting the family know his secret, but he was at a loss of what he should do next with the young boy lying motionless in his room, who was still showing no outwardly signs of coming to.
Draco groaned, “my luck! Mistletoe right there,” he looked at Harry, who gave him a confused look, “You don’t know?!”
I will see you guys in the next chapter <3
“Draco, do you think you could help me some more before the next class?” Harry asked, turning to look at his blonde companion, before being shoved out of the way by a certain red head. The red head was storming out of the Charms classroom, unhappy because of what took place. Draco quickly caught the smaller wizard before they both could take a tumble, sending a glare the red head’s way.
The Dark Lord thought back on his younger years and what had happened, he had thought about what would happened if the outcome had been different. What if the kids would have been his friend? What if one of the ladies at the orphanage showed any type of kindness? What if his mother loved? Love? The Dark Lord smirked, who needed something such as love, all that love got you was a broken family, a broken heart. There was no place in this world for love, love is one thing people could use on others. Love is a weakness that needed to be crushed in the world. He needed no such thing, he did not care what happened to people anymore, and that was all Albus’ fault for doing nothing to help him; always turned a blind eye on everything, never intervening on anything, just like what has happened to his Potion Master, and now what had happened to his Golden Boy. Yes, the old blind man has once again messed up, leaving the boy behind with people who never loved the child, who had put the child through more pain the Tom could ever think of. But it seemed that the old coot could care less. All he had to do was make contact with the boy, and make sure that he fell into his plans perfectly; the only thing that was in the way was how much his Potion Maker relied on the old headmaster. The Dark Lord had lost him when he targeted his beloved Lily, and that was a sacrifice he had to make to ensure his own life. Maybe if the kid turned towards the Dark Lord, he would once again have his Potion Maker on his side. He just had to put his plans to the test; but when? When would be the perfect time for everything to fall into place? When could he execute the way the Boy-Who-Lived to join the darkness, and rid the world from everyone that had wronged them.
Severus quickly made his way over the bed, gently putting his fingers underneath the younger wizards chin and lifting his head up to where he could see the boy’s eyes. “There is nothing to apologize for, what happened was not your fault. Yes, you did have a reaction, but that was to disturbing news. It has now been fixed, and you no longer have to worry about it.” Harry opened his mouth to reply, but Severus cut him off. “No, there was nothing that could have been done differently, and I will have you know that charges are going to be put on Albus as soon as the goblins at Gringotts are done putting the papers together.”
The plan today was to go down to Gringotts to do all the paperwork to transfer all of the vaults left to Harry, and give Severus have power over them (as the guardian should). It was so that Severus could ensure that the money will only go towards Harry (but he wouldn’t touch it since he had his own vaults left by his Grandfather Prince and the vaults where he put the money he made from working at Hogwarts) and so that he could also start investments so that the value of Potter’s name and money would increase. As if the Potter name needed to be put out there anymore, but it will help Harry in the long run as well since everything will be set up for him just to pick up where Severus had begun. Also it wouldn’t just be Severus helping out, it would also be the Malfoy’s helping with the finances as well, since they had better understanding at how that game works. Then they would go down to the ministry to file the paper work properly and make sure that it was impossible that Harry would be taken away from them. There would be a few families that would be against Harry staying with Death Eaters, but that is nothing Severus could do about that. Yes he did make mistakes in his life that lead him down the path of darkness, but he did try to atone for his wrongs from his past. After that, Harry said he wanted to go finish his Christmas shopping and the Malfoy’s wanted to take them out to dinner so that they could celebrate the joys occasion.
The first news is after talking to my lovely beta, we are both very busy with school work and not have enough free time on our hands, we have decided to post chapters very other week instead of every week. We would have continued on, but it is unfair to you guys, when I promised every week and I am not able to do so, so from now on expect chapters every other week.
Hello Lovelies I hope you all had a good week! :D This chapter is one big fluff cute chapter! it is a shorter chapter then some, but I think we could have used a break from all the drama : and so our kitten has a moments rest. Anyways a big thanks goes to my beta as always <3 love them dearly for taking time to do this! with that we can move on too the story!
Harry frowned when he finished the article, that had been the same time Severus took him to his vaults and that giant had gotten that small brown package. To Harry it seemed like too much to be a coincidence that the same day and time, for that not to be anything. That is something he was going to ask Snape about tonight. Draco noticed Harry was lost in thought. “Harry everything okay?”
“You promise to tell me what happens?” He asked the twins. The twins nodded, and opened a car where they spied a certain blonde haired boy.
Harry paused for a moment, he would do it, but he could no longer keep this a secret from Draco. Draco was a smart kid, and was worrying about him to; of course, Harry told him not to but he did so anyways. Then there was Gemma who was also on his case, she had backed off a little after the mind healers visit, but was still very much a mother hen.
I jerked my head up in shock. We’ve already been here half the day?! It seemed Mr. Malfoy was stunned at how much time had gone by as I saw a flicker of surprise pass his mask.
“Good morning Draco, Harry. How are you this morning?” Severus asked, looking at the dark haired wizard. Harry just shrugged, not really in the talking mood anymore. Severus was very concerned, knowing this was a setback in Harry’s recovery. He just hoped that as the day progressed that he would come back out of his shell.
Gemma quickly stood up taking her wand out, “I, Gemma Lee Farley, swear on my magic that I will do everything in my power to help Harry Potter on the quest that the Dark Lord has set in front of him. I also swear that I will not give out any information regarding what was spoken or will be spoken of without permission from the Dark Lord himself or Harry. So mote it be.”
I nodded and I know everyone else did since we were all worried about Harry and the baby. We entered the room and saw Harry smiling at us sleepily.
The goblin smiled, yes from all that he has seen this would be the best for the child. “Of course, Lord Malfoy we will agree to this business, and will take care of everything and mail off the papers to both you and the ministry, once we have everything together.”
love kudos and comments on your thoughts about what you thought of the chapter so leave those below as well ~Gives best puppy dog eyes possible~ please?
Draco sighed at his new friend’s questions, of course he was more than happy to answer them, but at the same time the black haired boy could easily read everything that he wanted to know. That made Draco pause for a moment thinking; could his friend read? His mother and father told him some of why the boy was staying with his uncle, but not enough for the boy to completely understand.
“Yeah, I guess you can say that I’m used to waking up early.”
Severus was brought away from his thoughts when the very boy he was thinking about began squirming around on the bed.
“Yes Harry, we are here for you when you are in need.” Tom answered, knowing if he didn’t Harry would let his thoughts think that he was angry at the young wizard. When in reality he was concerned for his well-being. It seemed that every few days Harry’s dreams would turn into nightmares, leaving the boy in such terror he would shut himself in his room the next day; refusing anything and anyone. At first the older wizards where unsure of what was going on, as it seemed that the boys magic would create a silencing spell around his room from habit of living with his muggle relatives.
After the story was finished, the Dark Lord sat in silence thinking of what the old snake had told him, there was nothing different between them anymore. The Dark Lord could no longer hate the boy that lie in front of him. No, Harry could understand the Dark lord more than anyone else could. What does this mean? What could the future hold for all of them now? The Dark Lord was unsure of what he was supposed to do now, this changed everything, all he knew was that he need to talk to Harry or Severus soon, made all the hurt and suffering can be put into the past now that everything was in the light. He quietly thanked the snake for his time, and for telling him everything, and he promised that he would do nothing to his hatchling he just needed some time to think of everything that was told to him. Then maybe for once in his life he could save someone instead of hurting everyone, all he needed was a little but more time.
“I am sorry Levi, but it was just a long day after everything, and you know I told you that I wouldn’t be able to talk to you that often.” The boy said to the snake. The on looking man couldn’t help but smirk when he saw the young boy scolding a snake that could easily eat him.
Hello lovelies, I hope that all of you had an awesome 2 weeks :) thank you guys for waiting this long for an update. I also want to thank you guys for over 700 kudos T.T it is awesome and makes me tear up a little, also over 18,000 views its amazing thank you guys for such support.

Big shout out to my beta, they are amazing for what they do and I have no clue what I would do with out them! Alright enough of me on to the chapter!
* * * *
“Mum, can we go to the owl emporium? I would like to get my own owl.” Draco said, looking up at his mum. Narcissa thought about it for a moment, but decided that Draco was old enough now that he could get his own owl.
Severus couldn’t help the small smile that came upon his face at the youth. “Alright then, I will send for someone to open the door for your friend.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“They will not Harry, this was not your fault of what your uncle did to you, there was no way of you stopping him. You are not a freak, you are just a young boy.” Alec explain to the young wizard, “they need to know so we can all help you understand that. So, will it be okay if I tell them, or will you be able to tell them?”
I tried to give him a smile back, but I knew I failed when he just pulled me closer to his side as we walked into the grand building right behind his parents. I felt like a lot of the goblins’ eyes just swiveled in our direction along with the witches and wizards in there doing their business. We had only just stepped through the doors, when a youngish small goblin came racing up to the two older blondes.
“Alright Harry before we start I want you to clear your mind of everything. I want you to think of nothing but what is happening in this room. Can you do this for me? Mr. Malfoy asked. Harry nodded, and with that Mr. Malfoy tapped the log with the tip of his wand.
Both Harry and Hermione just continued ignore the stares and the rumors of everything they knew what was true and not true and so did their friends. The media grew tired of their silence and moved on to other news. Hermione had been finishing up her degree at University in studies of Law, when she ran into an old schoolmate. She was very secretive to Harry about it, wanting to get to know the person first, Harry of course respected her discission and gave her the time she needed. It was two months into the almost daily meet ups the Hermione introduced him to her Beau. To say that he was shock would have been an understatement, but he was just as supportive since it is her life. It was Blaise from Slytherin he was a player back in Hogwarts, so of course being the supportive Brother Harry was he gave him the shovel talk; and of course, being on to surviving the killing curse twice does have a nice effect in scaring off any others that tried to play with her heart. But Blaise was different he was smitten with her and complimented her bookworm tendency and got her out of the house when she needed to destress from University. It became quick just how much they needed each other and how sickly in love they where with one another.
Draco was confused to say in the least, it was very impolite of people to hide behind others like the dark raven haired boy was doing. Draco stopped at for a moment evaluating the younger boy, who was hiding behind his uncle Sev. The boy had longish raven hair that seemed to stick up in random spots, his eyes were a gemstone green, but other than that, Draco couldn’t tell much about the boy since his baggy clothes seemed to just hang off his person. One thing he knew for sure was the boy was very small, he didn’t really look to be about Draco’s age at all, but resembled an eight or nine year old.
“I-I-I can’t,” Harry whined softly, his nose running from crying. “P-P-Please don’t make me! I-I-I’m sorry, b-but I don’t want to remember.”
Anyways this chapter is another lengthy chapter to make up for the long wait I think it's about 3k nothing like the previous chapter but still longer then what I usually post so I do hope you enjoy it!
It was right after dinner one evening, Harry found himself in Severus quarters quietly hissing with Levi, and a little fur ball trying to attack his tail. When the dark man walked in, he just raised an eyebrow at the youth sitting on his floor talking with the snake, and seeing the troublesome kitten stalking the tail of said snake.
* * *
“No! I will not go with the other students! Harry is my friend and I will not leave him behind!” Draco said eyes on fire at the suggestion of being left behind. Severus cast a look at Draco, studying on how serious he was. Finally, he decided it would be safer to take Draco with him rather than having him sneak out alone.
As always thanks goes to my beta and all the hard work they put into the chapter! <3 you are the best hun!
Harry had gone to Severus quarters now at least three times to talk with Levi, and as well as inform his head of house of a headache that happened in DADA. Severus frowned at the news, but Harry only chalked it up to the way the man talked, and ran around in circles. Severus gave him a headache reliever for when he was having troubles in the class, and told him come to him for when he need more.
“Sev?” Harry called out, poking his head through the door way.
Draco and Harry walked into their double Potions with Gryffindor, and quickly took a seat next to Hermione and Neville, while Theo and Blaise took a seat behind them. All of them were talking about the homework that they have already been assigned that week, and how they need to get together in the library and set up a study session as not to fall behind on the work. Of course a certain red head was unhappy with the bonds that the Gryffindors where forming with the snakes, and spoke up.
I hoped you lovelies enjoyed the chapter please leave comments and Kudos below so I know what you thought of it! If you are shy and want/need to inform me of something send me an email at demondog136@yahoo.com I will try to reply as quick as possible! I hope to see you next chapter!!
Gemma and Draco made it back to the key section of the cHamber when they saw Professor Snape and his flowing robes jogging up to the chamber, with a very angry snake on his tail.
“Sir? What do you mean by Curious?”
“Harry! Where have you been?” Draco demanded when he saw his friend, slightly afraid that he missed the train when he didn’t see him in any cars. Of course, deep down he knew that there was no way his Uncle Sev would allow Harry to miss the train.
was not mad at him; it made the world a much brighter place to live in.
It wasn’t until the floo went active again and out stepped Draco, looking a little sheepish and a little jealous at the closeness I had with Nev. It was Nev who spotted him first and went rigid with fear and was ready to fight, growls of dominance filled the room between the two who both were ready to defend me.
“Griphook, is Ragnok available at the moment?” I ask. I’ve been wanting to come back to Gringotts to go down to the vaults for Merlin and Morgana. It was curious that I was heir after all the hundreds of years the lines had been dead. It makes me wonder what other dead lines may be just hiding and waiting for someone to take an inheritance test to find them.
Hello lovelies I hope you had an amazing month~ I am truly sorry for how long you wait through these the updates, but at this time I can only hope to do monthly updates; but you in for an amazing treat! Today's chapter is one of the longest I've personally written, while most of my chapters range for 1,000-2,000 words this is chapter is 4,094! So I hope you really like this chapter, it was just a treat to write and it flowed so well for me. I want to give a special thanks to amandadubose88 for being the beta for this chapter! She is so lovely to take the time to read over my work. Also thank you to you lovely readers for sticking by even when updates are slow <3
“Okay Harry, I can tell that you can’t talk about it more than that, but can you do something for me?” Harry just shrugged his shoulders at Alec, not wanting to promise something that he might not be able to do, “I want you to write your dreams, memories, down in a journal. This will be your journal you do not have to share with any one, but you can if you want to, also this journal does not strictly have to be a dream journal it can be used anytime you think you should write in it.” He pulled a black journal with a lock on it, and another dark blue journal with no lock, “Now as you can see I have another journal, I want you to try to write in this as well, but unlike the black one this one we will look at what you written in to see what is bothering you question you might have, in the next session. Now you do not have write in these at all, but I do encourage you to do so, it will help you in the long run if you do.” Alec said his blue eyes meeting his green ones.
“Well I am not entirely sure, I don’t think I am made out to be in Gryffindor, even though I have courage, I lack everything else, not enough voice to speak up against anyone. Hufflepuff is just not an option, there is no way I would ever be put in the house. Ravenclaw I can kind of see, I do value knowledge as much as them, but do not crave it to that extent. Then Slytherin I do have ambition, I do have wants and I strive to meet them, but I am not sure if I am cunning enough to be part of the house.” Harry answered in honest, he had been thinking about the houses ever since he had learned about them, trying to place of where he would be, but never fully ever to see himself in any house.
“Yes Severus, I do agree, but for now we will take young Harry home so he can rest, before the dinner. We can either owl the papers to the ministry, or we can go over there tomorrow.”
Harry stood right behind Draco, excitement thrumming through his body, his eyes taking in as much as he could when the doors open to reveal the Great Hall. Harry could never imagine a place like this, it was such a grand place to be, that he almost never wanted to leave. The doors revealed a hall with four large tables filled with excited students looking at the first years with great interest, mumbles about what student belonged to what house. Harry looked up and saw candles floating on the ceiling as well as the night sky above, a gasp escaped is lips at the sight.
The snake tasted the air around him, trying to see what the man's real plan was. He smelled the Dark Lord was he was being honest, still Levi didn't lower his guard once with the man that meant harm to his hatchling.
Thank you for reading please leave Kudos and comments down below! and I will get to them as soon as possible, if you are shy send me an email at demondog136@yahoo.com and I will answer as soon as possible. Much love!!
“So, you are telling me that you have never signed off on our paperwork we sent you, you have no idea how much money you currently have in your vaults, and nor do you have any idea where all this paperwork is heading? That your guardian has never showed nor hired a tutor in showing you how to run your accounts?” The goblin summed up what I said in a few words.
I glanced at my Dom, knowing he was uneasy with the thought of me hurting myself, but we needed to get this done. Without being prompted, I got both the dagger and goblet and took a seat on Draco’s lap knowing this is easier in dealing with the protectiveness he would have once I made the cut.
They entered the classroom, the door slamming shut behind them, making Harry flinch, his eyes darting everywhere, looking for a way out.
“SHHH!” Harry hissed, casting looks all around the doors to make sure that everyone was still asleep. “Yes of course he can, he isn’t stupid.” Gemma just nodded her head, still a little amazed by the snake.
After a minute of silence, Draco couldn’t help himself anymore. “So Harry, what is troubling you so much?” Gemma sent a glare at the blonde boy, before turning back to Harry who was giving Draco a small smile.

Levi was not happy with what his young hatchling was doing tonight, but of course he knew this had to happen if he was going to prove himself. Levi was silently making his way to the only other speaker in this school, listening all the while for anything that might make this night even worse. When Levi reached the door to the DADA office it was slightly ajar, Levi took this chance and slithered in to find something that had his scales rattle in fear for his young hatchling. His hatchling was in trouble, Levi quickly fled the office racing back down to the rooms where one dungeon bat was asleep not knowing what was going on.
“Harry!” The Dark Lord yelped, getting up from his seat to check up on the youth that had spilled out on the floor. Harry scrambled backwards and away from the man, not wanting to be too close, just in case. The Dark lord stop moving, “Oh Harry, there is nothing to be afraid of. I promise I am not going to hurt you,” the man kneeled on the floor showing his hands to the frightened youth, showing that he did not have a wand on him. As if he needed one, but the younger didn’t need to know that just yet. Harry eyed the open hands apprehensively, his body still tensed ready for anything but slowly unfolded himself. “I will explain everything, but why don’t you get back into bed? Severus would have my head if I let you stay on the floor a moment longer.”
“Severus what a surprise to see you, I was expecting to see Harry first than come talk to you afterwards.” Alec greeted the bat like man before him.
“W-Well dear we will just get you two more from the zoo! How does that sound sweetie?” The boy’s mother said out of fear of her own son.
“Harry, Draco, here are yours, please do not be late to any class or there will be consequences.” Severus said, looking between the two, “Other than that, keep your grades up, and if you ever have any trouble ask your fellow house members, or even the teacher of the subjects for pointers.”
“Gods and goddess I am your vessel, please bring a blessing upon me and my family for the next year. Allow us to prosper and live, allow our magic to grow and love.” As he spoke these words he had cut across his palm of his hand allowing blood to drip into the hissing fire below, as soon as he had finished speaking the fire glowed as brighter wisps of silver shot up to Senior Malfoy’s hand. The adults and Draco followed him then it was Harry’s turn he took the knife from Draco shifting his body towards the fire.
Here are some of my plots:
Hello lovelies sorry for taking so long with chapter 5, I was in process of moving back for college, and now I am in my first week of college yay for me~~ So either one of two things are going to happen.
Love always Demon <3
“P-P-Potter!” Quirrell stuttered out, noticing the fleeing boy. “I-I-I thought t-t-that you went h-home.” Harry silently thought of running from the Professor so that he wouldn’t have to talk to him, but forced himself to smile before turning around.
With that, the goblin turned around and started walking at a fast pace, leaving the Malfoy family and I to follow behind him. We followed the goblin through a maze of long hallways with many doors. Some areas were decorated in fine gold and precious gems, others with weapons, one area was an open mining area and you could see a few goblins extracting gems straight out of the walls.
“Alright Draco ready to go? We have to start packing if we are going to get on the train tomorrow.” With that the two boys left with more questions than answers, but it didn’t matter to them, all they thought about was the fun that they were going to have this Christmas.
“Hello,” Harry said his voice a little horse from lack of use, “You must be Severus, I must thank you for everything.” Severus swallowed a lump that was quickly forming in his throat. This boy was Lily’s, he might have James’s face but he now saw mostly Lily.
“These are our most precious vaults and very well protected. We sometimes let those gifted in curse breaking try to take on these vaults, but not once has someone broken through. They have been sealed from anyone and everyone but those from their blood or magic line,” Ragnok explained as he just smiled adoringly at the vaults. “The first 4 are those of the founders; Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, Slytherin, and Gryffindor. Then you have Pendragon’s as 5, 6 is an unknown family whose line has been forgotten, even Gringotts, as we have lost records. Then there is 7, Lord Merlin requested this vault to be saved for him and Lady Morgana, and the next mage will be allowed entry and accepted into the vault. That is you, young Lord Potter.”
“Try this one Mr. Potter, it is an eleven inch holly with a Phoenix Feather as its core.” Harry took the wand a little afraid that this would reject him as well, but felt a happy warm feeling fly across him, wind picking up around the store then quickly settled down.
“Happy new year Draco.” Harry whispered back before the shared another searing kiss… Maybe the year did end on a high note.
Draco ran into the room from wherever he was looking at me scared, “what is it love?” He asked walking over to me lower himself to knelt right in front of me.
It was near night time, and Harry was in the Library, books scattered all around him due to searching for information on the stone. Of course, nowhere he looked seemed to hold any information about the stone, all that was left was Sev’s books. Of course, he could ask the man directly, but Harry loved to read and find the information on his own.
“I-I do have one question.” Harry said softly. Tom and Severus both looked at Harry, ready for anything. “H-How is it that you have a body?” Severus and Tom blinked, Tom started to laugh, thinking out of everything this child has been through, and this was his first question. Harry blushed ducking his head; he knew that was a stupid question.
Harry smiled up at Gemma, nodding. Gemma leaned down and whispered the spell into Harry’s ear, and a second later Harry was running off back to the dorms where un-expecting victims where. Theo just watched in amusement, and a reminder that he never want to be on the receiving end of Harry’s pranks. It was only a minute later before explosion sounds where going off in the dorm and Harry running out laughing. Some of the older years looked on, laughing at the younger years as they scrambled out of the dorm screaming.
Harry wanted no more than to alert the man to where he was, but didn’t have the strength to do so.
10/7/2020 re-write
Severus looked up at Alec with his eyes glistening but no tears in sight. “When have you become the voice of reason?”
I blinked in shock, my head snapping up at Ragnok. They have been trying to get hold of me? Why haven’t I ever gotten something like that?
So before I got around to fixing it, Merlin told Harry that he was going to be the Dark Lord, but I hated it, but I just couldn't change it for the longest time. So shortly before posting I was able to make the changes to make myself a little happy with the outcome.
Like any other day, today was no different to him, as the screech of his aunt and the banging on his cupboard door awoke him for the morning, “Wake up you little freak!” The women bellowed. Of course he had been up for some time after coming to after his Uncle’s beating from the other day, trying to put the pain into the back of his mind. Of course his uncle knew better to his him where the bruises might show, his Aunt always threw a fit each time she saw the after math saying how “those” People would find out what they have done. Harry had no idea by what she meant of those people, but he hope that they would do something about it, but nothing ever happened.
have a lot written out at the moment, I've come to a slight stand still unsure if you guys are going to like the first part I have written. This stand still has been happening for about 4 months now, and I just grew tired of trying to write, so I decided to see what you guys think of it. Because of this, there isn't going to be a clear posting schedule, as there was for part one so I thought I would give you a heads up.
Inside you can hear the scrambled of people trying to find someone to count the new year in, Harry and Draco didn’t move enjoying the comfort of one another.  2 minutes until the new year.
(See the end of the chapter for
The snake reared up hissing at Harry, who tried to back away,
I was tearing up myself as her reaction, and couldn’t help the wobble in my own smile, “The same can be said about us, we are happy that you agree!” I detangled myself from Draco’s arms and pulled Luna into a tight hug, happy that she agreed to be a Godmother to our pup.
“Certainly.” He pointed to the first on the right, “This is the lordship ring to the Potter line and the one next to it is the lordship ring to the Black line.”
The moment was cut short when a throat was cleared, Harry’s head shot up to see Draco standing with his hands on his hips looking at the group. “Harry! You need to go get ready! The party is going to be starting soon!” Harry just stuck his tongue out at the blonde.
“You will be fine, little one, but this is something you need to do. I will be out here waiting for you. You have nothing to fear, no one will be coming down here and I have Ragnok to keep me company.” I looked up at his silver eyes, pleading that he would not send me in there alone. I did not want to part from my mate after all that had happened today, the last few weeks really, but I knew he was right. He gave me a smile and gave me a soft kiss on the cheek before slowly letting me go.
“Yes, Lord Potter-Black, that is understandable, and will be considered. With both the claiming of 2 lordships and 4 heirships, and the healer review ordered by Lord Malfoy,” the goblin said
It had been a week now since the first visit with Alec, Alec had been coming around daily for the most part to talk to Harry and work with the linger issues that the Dursley left the young boy. As well as taking the time with Severus and Tom in talking with them, be it the best way how to help Harry during memory lapses, to what potions they needed to help Harry sleep. Since it was apparent the nightmares where going to be stick around for awhile even with the mind healing therapy Alec was doing with Harry.
“I don’t know Harry here let me check to make sure that it is safe before we open it.” Severus said, taking the package from his son and casting spells to make sure there has been no tampering done. When it showed nothing, he handed it back to Harry. “Well since it is safe, I will let you open it.” Seeing that there was nothing to fear from it, Harry removed the card from the top of the package and read it.
Draco let out a low coo, as he tried to ease my pain the best he could. I could feel both the older Malfoys looking at us with a smug smile, but I was too busy with Draco. He released my hand and that was when I saw that the cut that had once been on my hand was now healed. I was in shock, I did not know that Veela had a healing ability for their mates, or maybe it was just a Dom thing. I will have to ask Draco about that later. Because our attention was being called back to the goblin who now had in hand a paper turned in our direction that was just filled with names and vault numbers.
“I would like to Sir,” Harry said quickly thinking up a lie, “But Professor Snape asked me to stop by his office to show that I have done my homework.” He really didn’t want to go with Professor, nor did he think his Dad would like that he would spend any extra time with him either. So with that the boy turned around and was ready to leave, when he felt a hand hold to his shoulder. Harry held back a violent flinch, when that happened, reminding himself that he was not at the Dursley’s, and that this was not his Uncle either.
Harry couldn’t help the sigh that slipped past his lips, he was already tired at the attention that he was getting, and couldn’t wait till it died down. “Yes, I am.” He said curtly, “But please do not make a big deal out of it, I am Harry, just Harry.”
The next morning, when Harry woke, the first thing he was aware of was the arms around his person and the second was that he had his head tucked underneath someone’s chin. Harry slowly shifted and pulled back, and saw that he and Draco were sharing a bed, and seemed to be somewhere that wasn’t the dorms. The shifting of the smaller boy woke Draco, his grey opening to meet his own green. Harry’s face grew hot at the sight, he was embarrassed at sharing the bed, then suddenly the memories from last night flooded back and his mind shut down. Draco noticed the sudden change in his friend mood, he looked on with a distant look and his body went ridged.
2. Updates will either stay the same and/or decrease.
Professor McGonagall turned her gaze to Hagrid, some first years releasing their breaths. “Thank you Hagrid I will take them from here.”
“I-I-I’m sorry.” Harry whimpered, he voice scratchy from the screaming he has done. He looked around the room to see the dorm had been cleared out, he felt tears cascading down his face. He didn’t mean to be a burden on everyone, now everyone was going to hate him.
“Morning Harry, give us a few moments and a cup of tea before we start opening Christmas presents.” Lucius said with a yawn, “You can go wake the bear yourself, seeing that if one of us did it we would probably be hexed for it.” Harry just giggled at the name Mr. Malfoy gave Sev, since it was true. Even though he seemed like an early riser, he wasn’t much of a morning person; always needing a cup or two of tea, even before breakfast at the great hall.
“S-Severus,” Harry said, chewing at his bottom lip, “I-I was wondering about an article in the paper… I-I was wondering if it had to do with what happened at Gringotts with Hagrid.” Harry explained softly, not looking at the professor at all when speaking. Needless to say, Severus was a little concerned, how could this boy quickly deduce that what happened at the bank had to be something the headmaster put up? A test to see what Harry would do for the “greater good”, but then again he was in his house, so all in all it wasn’t that much of a surprise.

“I did sir, but I came back early with permission, so I am here to finish the rest of the Holiday here at Hogwarts.” Harry said, thought it would be better not to mention Severus or anything of the nature to anyone just yet.
It was a great party, Harry hung out with the twins most of the night. Theo and Blaise had stopped by there table once or twice, before heading back to their parents side. Draco spent most of his time with his Father and Mother as well, since they were the host family. Harry was surprised to see Gemma there and briefly talked to her about the upcoming semester, and what he had to look forward to in classes; while the twins where asking her thoughts on how to not get caught. At one point before the clock stuck twelve, Severus came and hung out with them for a bit as well, enjoying the start of the new with his new son. All and all it was a great night for Harry, and his smile never left his face. This was the first year where he wasn’t counting down from inside his cupboard, and was celebrating it with friends and family. He was happy to celebrate with his family, and was looking forward to a relaxing year at Hogwarts.
The boys eyes creaked open as he felt his heavy be lifted from the small confined cupboard space so gently, he saw a man with long midnight black greasy hair, and enraged chocolate brown eyes that where looking right at his Aunt He couldn’t fight the smile coming to his face as he gazed at his savior, “T-Thank Y-You.” The young boy spoke through the pain of a throat raw of screams. His eyes closing now finally able to rest without fear, his wish of being rescued finally coming true.
Anyway I will let you read this chapter and leave to read!

“Mummy, can I go through his stuff to make sure he didn’t take anything else?” Harry heard Dudley ask his mum.
Harry was just putting the bacon on to a napkin to have the grease soak off when he heard the thunderous footsteps of his uncle coming down the stairs. “Boy!” He uncle yelled, “You better have the breakfast just right today!” Harry suppressed a shutter that threat to overtake his body at his uncle’s tone, trying to up the finishing touches on the eggs before planting them just as well.
“Well look who found his way out.” A voice said from the doorway. Harry was too tired for him right now.
It had been a quiet week for Harry the beatings where very few this week, he counted his blessings, and tried his best to keep out of his uncle and cousins way as much as possible doing everything he could. So when Harry was told to fetch the mail that night he did so without complaint, so when he started to riffle through the mail, as to separate of whose mail it was he was surprise to see his name upon an envelope. Of course a quick glance around the empty hall to make sure no one notice this he slipped the letter underneath his cupboard door, knowing that is his Uncle or Aunt saw this there would be a price to pay. He quickly made his way back into the kitchen handing the mail to his Aunt and Uncle, before taking his place once again in the corner, waiting for his “family” to finish their dinner so he could clean up (and possible swipe) their leftovers.

“Alright boys, one more stop, time to get your wands!” Narcissa said as she led the boys through the ally to the wand makers shop. The shop at this time was deserted and the old wand maker was nowhere to be seen until the door rang.

Leviathan said as he slithered over to the forgotten tin box and discarded letter.
Harry sighed in disbelief at his luck, stuck in the same room as Draco fucking Malfoy, his Christmas couldn’t get any worse?!
Another note: I am thinking of other stories that I can do for you guys, but I would like some help. :) I am looking for a co-author to help me out. It would the first piece I would ever write with another person, but I would really love to give it a chance! So if you want to give me an email at demondog136@yahoo.com :)
“Sir! Your appointment is here,” The young goblin announced as he pushed open a large oak door inlaid with gold and silver swirling around and had a beautiful sapphire as a doorknob. The Malfoys quickly entered, taking a seat right in front of the large desk that was filled with goblin made trinkets and stones, along with a dagger and parchments. Without needing to be told what to do, the goblin left, running off to do whatever other job was warranted for him while I was left there standing awkwardly, unsure what I was supposed to do. This was my first time being in the bank besides to get money, and I’ve never been to a muggle bank before either.
Hissing pulled Harry’s attention from Severus, as the giant snake slithered over to the young boy coiling around him. Harry just slowly ran his hand down the snake’s large body, not looking at either Draco or Severus, locking away everything. While he stared at the snake, he realized that Levi wasn’t the first snake he had ever talked to, that his regressed memory had made him forget. He was more than happy to lock away the memory and forget again.
Severus was unhappy, and worried, his charge was out past the curfew that they had set. Harry had not once missed the dead line, there had been some close calls, but he was always back into their quarters right on the dot. So, when Severus heard the door slamming closed, he stalked to the door to give the child a stern talking to, but when he stepped into the living area of the quarters, something was wrong. The raven-haired child was not right there stammering out an apology, those bright green eyes begging Severus to let him go this one time. No, instead that child was slumped on the floor in a heap, those eyes hidden behind a black curtain of hair. Severus face turned from sneer of annoyance, to an expression of worry and fear; it has been awhile since the last time he saw Harry like this, and it scared him to no end. He quickly made his way over to the boy, scooping the small child into his arms and taking him to the black leather couch that sat in front of the fire. He held the child close, pressing one of Harry’s ears to his chest.
They both tried to move away from one another, but something kept them from moving apart. In fear they looked around till they spied a mistletoe formed above their heads.
With Levi’s help he was able to write the reply, and hunt down an owl that was able to take the letter back to Hogwarts. Harry spent a couple more hours talking with Levi finding things out about the other world. Of course Harry lost track of time and was running late, he just prayed to whatever god above that his Uncle wasn’t home yet.
It was one evening after a meet up Hermione put her foot down.
Draco frowned, “Well Potter I would go back to the party, but you are out here sulking and that could get us into trouble.”
“It is fine Harry, as long as you are back to talking. It gave me a fright when you weren’t talking.” Severus said, concern written on his face.
“Tell them for me Alec… Levi says if I don’t he would tell Tom himself…” Alec looked over to the snake and mouthed a thank you. Knowing that Levi was looking out for the best for Harry.
A few moments after Harry came in, Severus followed suit picking up a mug before taking a seat, grunting a greeting to everyone in the room before taking a sip of the black mug.
“Harry, what is it?” Gemma asked, looking at the smaller first year.
Harry thought to himself.
I stood in front of Gringotts Bank, still very much in awe of the beautiful building as well as being a ball of nerves. I don’t want to get on the goblins’ bad side and get kicked out of the bank. I have no idea how to go about properly comporting myself in front of them like other pure-bloods and half-bloods that have accounts with them.
Poppy, seeing that she was not needed, took her leave to head back to her private rooms. The Dark lord was in shock, he had never once heard his potion master talk so gently, even to a child. He also knew that Severus harbored a deep hatred for the Potter family, so why was he talking to the child in such as way?
“As you know, I think this is the first time I have ever seen you awake this early,” Severus smirked when Gemma lowed her eyes and blushed.
“Too bad he isn’t here then!” Petunia hissed at the man.
He was murmuring reassurances to the child; he summoned a Calming Drought, and coaxed it down the boy’s throat. They sat there for what seemed like hours to Severus, before Harry was breathing regularly and the panic was gone. Harry still sat in his lap, his ear still pressed on Severus’s chest, listening to the strong steady heartbeat. Harry’s eyelids were growing heavy with exhaustion, growing closer together with each passing minute. His body felt like lead and sluggish from both the potion and the panic attack.
“Harry, we are running late!” Severus said, looking at the young boy who had entered the room.
“Yeah, that’s the only reason I am up so early, you git.” Mumbled Draco, before standing up, “Let’s go wake up mum, dad, and Severus so that we can go open presents!”
I could feel Draco’s veela purr, since I was acknowledging that he was the Dom in our relationship and that I have trust that he will put my finances in the right places.
Inside was a warm homey feeling that had a wonderful smell of sweets and pine mixing together, a warm fire making the room feel amazing compared to deep cold that had settled around him this year. A couch was facing the fire, and it looked like someone was sitting there, Draco took as step into the room to investigate in just who had made themselves at home in the room.
Draco gave a soft smile back, even after all Harry has gone through here he was smiling at him. “Its fine Harry, don’t worry about it. It’s just going to be us at Christmas, and then everyone will be joining us at New Years, and that is in a couple of weeks there is no fear. Now, I think I found the strange creature it is a Cerberus.” Draco said and flipped the book around for Harry to read, there in the book was a crude picture drawing in the book a description about the creature and the weaknesses that they had. The only strange thing that seemed to be common was the music made the creature sleep. It might have to do with the only Greek tales that Harry read about whenever he escaped the house or the books Dudley refuse to read.
“Harry, if you don’t want to, you don’t have to go to classes today.” Harry’s head jerked up at what Snape just said and he began shaking his head, no he would go to class! He would be a good student! Fear seeping in that he has done something wrong. “Harry it’s okay, I’m just saying this because it seemed like you didn’t get that much sleep last night. If you really feel up for going to class then I will not force you not to go.” Severus said frowning.
Alright guys pole time once again! :) Since I did not add Nev in this chapter it gives me a chance to pull a small pole, like I did at the beginning of this story. I want to know three things! 1.) do you want Nev's mate to Theo or Blaise? Or is there someone else you want? 2.) Do you want Nev to be Dom or Sub? 3.) what creature do you want Nev's mate to be? I want to hear your thoughts, and I might end up taking up your idea :) I think it's fun to have the readers create the story along with me.
I blushed, unsure of what was happening as Draco repeatedly ran his light pink tongue over the deep cut. I hissed as the stinging caught up with me.
“He is.” The other one picked up, where the other started, “Aren’t you?”
* * *
“Alright Firs’ years follow me!” The giant said, leading them up to the castle, some first years gasping at the haunting sight. Straight to the entrance of the castle, its huge wooded oak door were a sight in themselves, holding centuries of secrets waiting to be revealed. They opened to reveal a tall black-haired witch with emerald eyes that almost matched Harry’s own. Harry smiled at the familiar witch he meet a few weeks ago at Severus’s house, and watching how the other first year withered underneath her scrutinizing gaze as she passed over each and every one of them.
Draco sneered at Harry, “my make out session is cheating yet you go and get into a custom? I thought we agreed at it was supposed to be a strip tease.”
Alright I'll see you guys next chapter.
The last thing Harry remember was the giant club swinging his and Hermione's way, before he flung himself at her. He had no idea if he made in time to push her out of the way, but he does remember the pain in his leg, then a crashing sound of the stalls giving away and covering them before passing out. He awoke with a start, ready to start the fight once again, but found himself in the white, sterile room of the infirmary. If that wasn't the strange part of being teleported, it was that his DADA Professor was standing over him, his hands out stretched looking like he was ready to strangle the young boy. The boy was already under enough stress from both the accident with the troll and now being in a new place that his mind snapped back to a time before he was rescued; his uncle standing over him, just like the professor, his purple face enraged and his hands tightening grip around the thin neck of his.
Hello Lovelies and welcome back to chapter 3~ I want to first say sorry for any mistakes that are found within this chapter, I haven't had a beta in a while and I haven't had the time myself to go back through myself to fix anything. WARNINGS: Rape and Child abuse, so If you are triggered by these please read at your own risk, or skip the chapter. With all the said I hope  you enjoy the chapter!
“Of course, I understand. I am just happy that you are willing to help them out, and I thank you for that,” I replied and bowed to show my thanks. I do not want to lose the trust of the goblin nation at this time. I felt Draco’s hand slip into mine and give a squeeze before I glanced back at the twins and Theo.
Soon rough hands where spreading Harry’s arse cheeks apart allowing Draco to gaze upon the pucker hole that is just shimmering in slick as his omega gasp and press his arse back towards the alpha. Draco just chuckled and inserted two fingers into the twitching hole grinning when heard Harry moan and Harry to clench greedy around the two digits wanting the to go deeper to fill him. Draco twisted and spread his small omega open as Harry tried to rock back but his other hand pressed into his lower back preventing him to move as the Alpha prepped the Omega. At least during heat preparation wasn’t need but Draco loved to watch Harry squirm below him as he grew close to his orgasm on his fingers alone. Draco add a third finger and brush against Harry’s prostate causing a strangle moan to erupted and his hips to stutter in the little movement he had.
