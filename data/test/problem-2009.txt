“True.
Molly beams at him, clearly pleased he’s decided to play along, even in a less than enthusiastic manner.
He stands up, swoops a little to squeeze Harry’s shoulder.
You’re on, Malfoy.”
You know that.
I was privately tutored for the rest of my education and I slowly began to form my own Coven as my uncle made introductions with some of the other families.”
“That is a matter for him to address with his Alpha, love, don’t you think?”
He’ll definitely have to lay out some boundaries with both contenders.
Harry’s mouth drops in surprise and he turns to look at Malfoy but the other boy has already started to walk away.
Harry glanced at her and some of his anger cooled in the face of her obvious tiredness and smothered distress.  “So that’s where you were last night?”
“I can tell you’re un-Settled.
George’s other hand blocks it just in the nick of time and the extra limb retracts grouchily, returning to hang limply from where it dangles oddly beneath Ron’s (natural) right arm, jutting strangely out of the boy’s upper torso.
And who could I ask?”
Deciding to try to distract George from his irritation, Harry waggles his brows, “Oh? Anyone here that you most don’t want Fred to protect you from?”
Have you decided?”
Hermione shrugs.
She told me in some ways, she felt bad for them - always living right on the cusp of a great discovery and always thwarted in the end.
“I should have warned you, I know, but I assure you, she hasn’t had an episode in six months.
It’s second nature on them to draw on the resources available to them.
“And for avoiding me since we’ve returned to Hogwarts as well, I presume.”
into his scent and he thinks he may be at least marginally successful as a little of the tension eases out of Hermione’s scent.
There are risks but at least with his broom he has a better chance of getting away from any aggressors.
“Bill’s being taken to St Mungo’s,” he starts and Fleur lets out a quick, panicked sound.
“I wouldn’t dream of it.”
“You are undergoing your Presentation, Mr. Potter,” Madame Pomfrey informed the Gryffindor as he sipped on yet another Potion she had handed to him after settling him in a cot.  Hermione had settled in a chair next to his bed and did not look like she intended to leave any time soon and, strangely, Madame Pomfrey had made no protest at her presence.
No avoiding it really.
Smith sets two potions down with a clink onto the table.
“So young,” Harry murmers, even though he had lost his own much younger.
The redhead Omega is tiling the potion back and forth with the tip of his finger, clearly thoughtful.
I can help on Wednesday - it’s only Herbology and Charms for me that day and we’re not doing anything practical in Herbology this week.
Harry slows his pace and the two walk in easy familiarity up to the Tower where their class takes place.  They’re early, beating even Hermione (who, as an early riser, had usually eaten breakfast and done an hour of studying in the library prior to her friends even waking up), but much to Harry’s chagrin, Boot is shuffling his feet awkwardly in the hallway leading up to the stairs up to the Tower, clearly waiting for Harry.
Around the table, the occupants are setting down their silverware, prepping themselves for whatever is about to happen.
Harry.
If that means she would rather take the risk and deal with the consequences, I respect that choice.
“You didn’t know what you were asking,” she’s teary eyed, but she restrains herself from breaking into full tears.  Harry reaches out and holds her hand again, thinking they could both use the physical touch.
Susan keens and Smith laughs before he releases her and she crashes to sprawl on the floor.  The whole thing couldn’t have been more than a minute, and then suddenly everything crashes back to present.   Harry is back in the suite in the Omega Quarters, he can tell his Heat has broken and Susan is throwing herself away from him, flush with incoherent rage.  “What kind of game are you playing, Potter?” she snaps, making fierce eye contact with him.  Harry opens his mouth - to protest, perhaps, or to insist on his innocence in the least - but it’s too late, she’s storming out the door.  He pushes himself to his elbows, tries to get out the bed, but its no use, he’s utterly exhausted.  His body has had its say.  He succumbs to the exhaustion and passes out.
You’re Omega, we can’t change that.
“I agree with you about Boot, mate, but technically this IS actually how its done.  If Alphas want to court you they have to request your permission, get your Alpha’s permission, then prove themselves as worthy to both the Coven and to you.  It’s a fairly formal process.”
Harry returns it energetically, feeling a sense of relief at the girl’s presence.
Startled Harry’s eyes skitter up to evaluate her and her face is full of compassion while she pumps out soothing pheremones.
"We can't go in half-cocked and make decisions on the fly without knowing each other's opinions.
Slowly she nods.
Hermione had called the Coven together about a week before the Ball to discuss how she wanted it to go.
Harry’s curiosity is so piqued he almost misses the Cannon’s Keeper blocking the quaffle.
On the reverse side, the blanket is covered with fleece.
“My family needs and an heir and I like children, always have.
“She’s his Second.
Regardless of the many insane revelations he’d been forced to encounter in the last few weeks, accidentally running into Ron and Hermione snogging in the hallway was still one of the most shocking.  Sure he had known that they were feeling out a different kind of relationship, but he hadn’t known they’d progressed to physical intimacy and it was bloody awkward to see it in person.  In their defense, they were both incredibly embarrassed about the whole thing and had been rather apologetic, at least at first.
After a time, his tears quiet but the ache, pervasive, remains.
He points out the moving staircases and Travers stops to admire them.
Ron and Fleur hustle out the room, closing the door gently behind them.
“Terry and Hannah say I can stay for now.
I forgive you."
“Hm.”
“How can you possibly already have a Courting Contract pulled together?
“Once,” Travers says, “but not for very long.”
“My point is, Harry’s our family, first.  He’s also an Omega and yea, that means a lot of people are going to be paying a lot of attention to him …”
“He’s my brother too,” Ron says, losing some of his cool in the face of his mother’s interference.
“Ron helped me see the error of my ways.
“Might be helpful if you talk to your brothers, though.”
“Why should we even care?” Seamus chimes in, and Harry can’t help but think he’s right to ask.  What does it matter?  Popularity has never been a high priority for him or his friends.
Ron narrows his eyes but doesn’t question him further.
“Show me.”
This is a matter for Fred’s Coven to deal with.”
“May I have the pleasure of your company two Saturdays hence?
“Alpha Granger,” Malfoy nods, not offering the same greeting as Fred as neither of their Covens are acknowledged as the superior Coven yet.
You don’t even know me, after all.
The others had looked at him like he had grown another head when he had trotted out with it on earlier, but Harry was extremely proud of the item, and excited to have occassion to show it off.
Fred unintentionally drew on George’s magic during the Fight.
Ron shrugs.
Harry peers at the sight of his friend, passed out in the bed and sighs, “What have you got yourself in the middle of, mate?”
“We appreciate the consideration.”
Mrs. Weasley had taken one look at the arm and decided it was a matter for the Hogwarts Mediwitch to deal with; Madam Pomfrey being better equipped to handle such surprise magical mishaps.
“Can you explain more about Covens, sir?”
Malfoy’s Alpha scent colors with confusion and concern, which only ends up putting Harry more on edge.
If we can garner a little good will now, we may have more leverage when we really need it.”
Harry chuckles.
“I’m not exactly an expert,” she says, “and you’re never going to be alone with them, not truly, so there’s really only so much you can get up to…”
“Yea, like an Alpha who reports into another Alpha.  Some Covens, typically really large Covens with a lot of Betas and more than one Omega work better with more than one Alpha.  But Alphas are territorial and they also like to be in charge.  An Alpha Sub would need to get along really well with the Alpha Prime and the Alpha Prime would need to be laid back enough to spilt up some of the control of the Coven.”
“My parents are still my parents?” the Hufflepuff asked, lowering her hand slightly from her mouth and looking at Burbage so pleadingly it almost broke Harry’s heart.  “I…I kind of stopped reading the letter after they told me about Aunt Nadia…I was just so upset.”
Aghast, Harry is leaning forward to question that assertion further, but Burbage is clapping her hands and leaning back.  “I think we have time for one more question today.  Who’s up?”
The rest of the school was aflutter with talk of the upcoming Coven Ball, slated to be held on Samhain.  The existence of the Ball itself was a bit of a surprise to Harry - it would be his first time attending, of course, as only Presented students were invited to attend.  Ron and Hermione had guiltily admitted that they had ditched him to attend in the year prior.
But yes.
“However, it seems that there needed to be a balance to Coven life driven by dynamics.  Young, un-Presented Wizards had no decisive role in Covens and Covens frequently attempted to groom young Wizards into the Dynamic that their Coven most desired, in spite of no connection ever being proven between a Wizard’s presentation and the manner in which they were raised.  Coven members would try to install distinctly Alpha or Omega characteristics into un-Presented children who were destined to Present as Beta.  Slowly, overtime, something started to happen to Presented wizards - they started to find themselves unable to use Alpha voice or Coven magic on the un-Presented.  At first, it was only the Voice and the Magic, but slowly Alphas found themselves unable to discipline Omegas in front of the un-Presented or to even discuss Coven matters with their children.
“This is an Omega pendant.  They’re an old tradition - passed down from pureblood families for generations to the Omegas born to them.  Harry,” she pauses, suddenly sounding a little nervous.  “This was your mother’s.  Apparently it was passed to her by your father’s mother when she decided to Bond with your father.  It’s a part of your inheritance and I hope its okay that I brought it here with me today.”
“If only we save it for just the right moment.”
Hermione rises as well, but remains silent while Harry shifts closer to George on his other side, knocking his knee against the other Omega’s in an attempt to offer non-verbal support.
Instead he leads him to the tent that Hermione and Tonks are sharing.
“First, because of Harry,” she says and that sobers Harry instantly.  He glares at her.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Harry snapped.
“Tat was nice,” Harry slurs, blinking several times in succession to try to get the room to focus a little.
George considers.
How about a tour?”
The crowd around leaped up to cheer and Harry and Oberon with them, laughing in delight.
Your Omega is reacting, lashing out and creating physical pressure to absolve things with your Alpha.
“Harry…isn’t there a part of you that wants to submit to the Alphas?”
Suddenly, the party goes still around them, in the way everyone freezes when a glass is broken in a crowded room.  After the first silent moment, the crowd twitches in the direction of whatever is happening behind Harry and he whirls around to find Susan on her knees in the dirt in front of Zacharias Smith, quaking with fear but otherwise frozen.
As the only other non-aligned Gryffindor, Seamus seemed an obvious choice as a recruit, but Hermione had never been very fond of the Irish Beta.  Ron wasn’t exactly overflowing in affection for his dorm mate, but he was prepared to put in a half-hearted word of advocacy when Dean Presented and made the whole situation a lot easier to stomach.  Both Ron and Hermione liked Dean and Dean had a long history of keeping Seamus in check.  They both were welcomed into the Coven and when Luna presented - earlier than most of her year - she decided to join Hermione’s Coven instead of trying to join up with one of the Ravenclaw ones.  Hermione had been well-pleased.  Now with Harry, their six person Coven rivaled the size of Malfoy’s, who had seven 7th years in all, and Ernie, who also had six.
Remus, looking a tad sheepish, just shrugs, gesturing Harry inside and accepting the cocoa with a warm thanks.
Ron rolls his eyes at him and Harry just grins back, taking a giant bite of his oatmeal, suddenly feeling a little bit more in the spirit after all.
And you and I, we’re Betas, we can’t understand what Alphas and Omegas go through…”
“It’s my duty as your Alpha, Harry.  We’ll do everything we can to make you comfortable.  I promise.”
“Er…Nott.  Hi.  Um, out for a stroll?”
My season is at the end of the month.
Nott smiles at them all, seemingly not put out at the blank looks he receives in return.
“Come now, Ronnikins,” George chides, making eye contact with Fred for a second before they both, as one, set down their hands and affix their younger brother with identical stares.
“It is what it is.”
Flushing, Harry eyes it for a minute, not accustomed to anyone showing him this kind of physical interest.
Fred follows his twin out of the room.
“Me too,” Harry agrees.
“That is understandable, of course.”
“I know,” Harry acknowledges, because he does, but there’s only limited space for forgiveness when he’s still in the midst of this reaction.
But they come to us with only a single candidate? None of us should be comfortable with the assumptions they were making about you and your willingness to go along with things.
“Fred says there’s trouble afoot between Nott and Malfoy,” Hermione tells him, looping an arm with his.
They all go quiet, uneasy.
“I’m glad it was this time.
“We’d better have some ground rules,” the redhead grumbles.
Another 15 seconds of silence passes.  “How often exactly should I be expecting this nonsense?”
Thankfully it's only a moment before a large silvery ape Patronus charges into the room, blurting out its message to Fleur in rapid French.
“You threatened to belt me in front of the rest of the Coven!”
There’s a lopsided reindeer of unusual proportions gallivanting across his sweater, threads subtly restitching themselves as it makes its way up a snowy track that stretches from the lower left hand corner to the upper right of his jumper.
Hermione, reading the situation, let’s Harry move past her to stand next to Belle and he motions them all on impatiently.
“I think you’ll find that its not quite that simple, Mr. Potter,” the official responded, looking him over condescendingly.  “Omegas don’t exactly have the … defenses … to properly care for themselves if an Alpha takes it upon themselves to undermine those efforts.”
No unnecessary risks.
When he realizes Harry’s has noticed his gaze he gives a little side grin, looking a tad mischievous.
It’s not just cards either, and Harry is happy to see them back to their old antics - even if it is at the expense of his best friend.
That’s a hard sell.”
She pauses, her hand spasming slightly where it had twisted in the blanket.  Harry reaches out and places his own over it.  “What happened?” he prompts gently.
Harry paused.  It felt…wrong, suddenly.  He shifted and then, before his conscious mind had really caught up, he found himself dropping gracefully to his knees.  Neither Ron nor Hermione twitched but he heard some shifting behind him from the other three and an uncomfortable clearing of the throat behind him.  Harry had never kneeled to anyone before, but in spite of the strangeness of the situation, it felt right to him and he couldn’t find it in himself to be embarrassed.
“Aw no,” George mutters.  “I’m sorry Harry.  No Alphas for this heat.  Come on, drink some water.”
Ron casts Harry a desperate look.
“Yea, what we call wizard’s first Covens.  Covens are such an important structure to how the Wizarding World works and the Stricture is so pervasive that it really doesn’t work to just stay in the Coven you’re ‘born’ to.  By the time we present, we’ve been at school for years, made friends, and need to operate with these new dynamics right away.  So new Alphas create ‘Fledgling’ Covens or ‘Fledges’ to kind of practice being Alphas, and new Betas and Omegas join the Coven of the Alpha they are closest with.  Sometimes the Fledges become real, adult, lifetime Covens and sometimes they disperse and get brought into larger or different Covens after school.
Harry makes a small, surprised sound at the vehemence in Malfoy’s voice. The blonde steps forward, reaching to tug Harry’s fingers away from the death grip around his elbow and pulls them instead into his own, forcing Harry to keep his gaze.
"Harry Potter, nice to meet you."
It impressed me, him coming to introduce himself and not just assume you’d say ‘yes’ to his proposal without so much as a ‘how do you do?’.”
Harry realizes he is shaking.  Surprised at himself, he belatedly realizes that all of the angry Alpha pheromones have triggered his own instinctive response.  He finds he can’t answer Ron with words, and let’s out a low whimper, looking at his Coven’s Second with alarm.
“This isn’t about me,” Hermione bites out, and this time, Harry can’t help but take a small step back, though he’s only just able to keep his chin level instead of tipping it back in supplication.
For his part, George looks unrepentant, not even deigning to glance over at the brother seated next to him and instead keeping his gaze fixed shrewdly on his hand of Exploding Snap.
Harry laughs.
Just as we are often possessive over our Alphas.
Fred’s already pulled out his wand, clenching it in a tight grasp atop the table, clearly in the other Alpha’s sight.
“If you want…,” Fleur sounds tentative, “I will ask Bill to Settle you.
Oberon’s gaze softens a little and he squeezes Harry’s knee, digging his thumb in a little.
He chokes on it, eyes teary, and conscious mind floating to the edges; he’s aware but he’s
And while he enjoys watching when the opportunity presents itself, he doesn’t follow the leagues the way Ron does.
Meanwhile, Harry was also attending sessions a few times a week with Miss Burbage - sessions he was beginning to think of as a kind of gentle indoctrination.  The worst part is, he can tell his younger classmates are falling for it hook, line, and sinker.  He’s gotten to know them a little bit better in the couple of sessions that they’ve shared learning about their new dynamics.  The strawberry blonde girl who had been so distraught in the last session is Evie Selwyn and  she seems a good sort, earnest in her questions if a bit naive.  Harry has developed a strong dislike of Stebbins however, and has gotten tired of the Alpha’s constant leering.  He mentioned the problem to Hermione who asked him to let her know if he did anything overt and Ron was always there after class to walk him back to the dorm.   It was stifling but unfortunately necessary if Harry didn’t want to end up suspended for jinxing Stebbins the next time the Hufflepuff annoyed him.
“Can you just ask Draco to —“ Harry tries, but he’s wasting his breath.
If Fred pissed him off, and it combined with George getting distressed and Bill feeling really protective, I’m not surprised he dropped into it.
Bill’s hand stills from where it was running up and down and he turns to eye the younger Gryffindor contemplatively.
Harry shakes his head.
Fleur is quiet, contemplative, Harry thinks.
“We look out for each other,” George says easily and Susan smiles, a little sadly.  “We do,” she agrees and turns to head down to her classes.
When you reacted to my pheremones earlier...Merlin, I've never felt worse in my life."
Fleur speaks again, pulling her Alpha’s attention back.
“My condition is pervasive and often unpredictable.
Harry hums in agreement and Bill tugs on his arm a little to gently guide him to the side of the sofa that Fleur isn’t sitting on.
The Slytherin smiles at him, looking as abashed as Harry thinks it is probably possible for a Malfoy to look.
Harry crinkles his brow, not really sure how to translate what Fleur is saying into his experiences thus far with Alphas.
Burbage carries on, her voice gentle. “Your Aunt Nadia gave your mother a gift.  She was your mother’s surrogate, carrying you, mixing her magic with your Beta parents’ seed. Your mother is still your mother, you carry most of her and your father’s genetic material, perhaps with some small trait of your carrier, but your Aunt Nadia is your Oma and now that you are beyond Stricture you should call her such in respect.”
A few notes - this is definitely an AU.  Harry & co are in their 7th year, making them 17 and in this universe there is an 8th year that Fred & George are part of (I know they're 2 years ahead in the books, but in this case, they're only 1 year ahead).  The reason for this is that Wizarding society feels that young wizards and witches need slightly longer in school to adjust to their new dynamics in a safe environment after they are released from Stricture.  Since most present around 16, they get about 2 years in their fledges before they have to adjust to Coven structure in the real world.
And if we get some advantage against Voldemort for it, all the better.
What doesn’t impress Harry over the next few days is Malfoy.
Draco smirks at him.
She was a cheerful woman, and beautiful - I knew it even as a child.
It’s an incredibly rare Potion - requires hard-to-aquire ingredients, an unusually long brew-time, and a high-level of Potions-making proficiency - all of which drive up the cost substantially.
“Happy Christmas, Harry.”
Thinking about Malfoy had Harry battling back a blush.  As Hermione had promised, ever since his season, he had begun to find the Alphas he came across in the school more and more alluring.  Even Hermione had caught more his attention, her pheromone scent intoxicating to his newly interested Omega brain.  He had no romantic interest in her of course, but he found himself turning to face her whenever she entered a room, and listening with rapt attention when she chose to speak.  She had noticed of course, and for her part had seemed bemused if a little sad.  What she was more concerned about was how he would react to the competing Alphas in the school.
She’s pretty cool.
Fleur laughs lightly though, not seeming perturbed that he doesn’t get it.
Once Fred tipped, I think it was too much for Bill.
They’re identical in every way, every way except, apparently, the one way that mattered most.
“Yea,” Harry mumbled, Ron’s conciliatory tone taking some of the wind out of his feathers.  “Yea.  Thanks, mate.”
He can’t help but suddenly feel remorseful, then, that he couldn’t do this with Hermione, one of his best friends, and that they were still at odds with each other.
Hermione eyes him up and down and glances at Harry who just shrugs.
“Some of you may have already had some conversations about why we have these designations to begin with,” she paused but no one shifted one way or another.  Her gaze rested on Harry a second longer than the others but then moved on. “Unfortunately those of you who have Presented Beta face much larger obstacles to produce healthy magical children than will your Alpha and especially your Omega peers.”
Harry felt that jealousy rear its ugly head again, but he was distracted from his envy when Malfoy directed a pointed question to Hermione.  “Alpha Granger, might I propose we dance?  I know Padma has been itching to do so since we got here, and she could use a partner that can match her elegance.”
"Omega Potter," Travers hummed.
“Ok, well we’ve discussed it and you’re over the initial changes.  You’ll start to pick up on everyone else’s designation in the next couple of days and most of the school has heard about your presentation, so you should expect to start seeing a lot of Coven behavior.  It can be weird at first, but we’ll walk you through things.  Everyone gives the newly presented a month or so to get used to the new way of the world, so you don’t have to worry about upsetting any other Coven’s accidentally for the time being.  Ron is going to take you back to the Tower.”
"A pleasure to meet you."
“It’s his first, so I’ll stay with him this time.  We don’t have a gauge for how quick he’ll progress.  What’s your plan?”
Besides, he
Fred jerks a nod.
“I can throw the Imperius Curse.  Why should this be any different?”
“You must be so relieved.”
Travers took his hand, fluidly manipulating it to press his lips to it in greeting, rather than shake it as Harry had expected.
I had one of these written the first week after you Presented.”
Smith and Nott both double-take at the extra appendage but don’t say anything as the redhead pulls the slender vial up to eye it skeptically.
Harry trusts her so he does.  Within moments, a wave of calm washes over him.  He can still sense the prickling energy, but its muted now and he sends a half-lidded inquisitorial gaze at his Alpha friend.  “I think you’ll be wanting to head to the Omega Quarters after breakfast, Harry.  I’ll let your professors know.”
“Fred presented Alpha about a week before George presented Omega, so there was already a Weasley-sponsored Coven by the time that Hermione and I presented,” Ron told him as they made the walk from the Hospital Wing back to the Gryffindor Tower.  “I presented Beta first and I figured if Hermione presented Beta too, it would be easy to mesh into Fred’s Coven.  It’s not unusual for siblings to stay together in their Fledges, and Hermione gets along with them pretty well.”
“A Sub?”
“His Alpha voice.
“Alpha Granger, may Merlin smile on you and yours,” Fred said, smiling at her and maintaining eye contact.
Grumpily, he makes his way downstairs where he is unsurprised to find that most everyone else is up as well.
Shores?
Embarrased he tries to get control of himself, startled to find how much he’s enjoying the other man’s conversation and worried the Alpha will think his response too forward or immature.
Harry tried not to let his anxiety show too much as he waited for his second season - the one that would determine his cycle.  Every day that slipped by after his first, he breathed a sigh of relief.  Even putting aside the abiding desire to have as long of a cycle as possible, he was more than a little traumatized from his first experience with this physical requirement and wasn’t looking forward to the next.  He could tell his friends were similarly concerned, but were doing their very best to avoid the topic.  It’s not like talking about it would solve anything after all.
Hermione is routinely snappish, particularly when stressed, but she is rarely this out of control of her emotions and she’s been especially careful after Harry’s Presentation, not wanting to unduly influence him.
There’s more than one viable Alpha for you that could still help with the war effort that you might have a chance of getting along with better.
can compromise.
“To have knowledge of such things, but to never be able to engage in it the same way as everyone else.”
Harry wonders absently why it’s only now that they’ve Presented that Nott has made it onto their radar.
Harry’s feet finally start to move again and he’s already started to mull over the whole interaction when Malfoy’s voice sounds from behind him.
It was only after I had donned the robes and arrived at the ball that they began to tear.
Raphe and I woke up to shouting from the living room.
After a moment he refolds it.
Fred waves the paper imperiously, hand extended, voice dropping to Alpha timbre.
“Anything else?” Harry questions.
“I’m not ready to deal with Hermione, and I don’t want to feel like this.
“I think it depends on the secret,” Oberon says, finally answering Harry’s earlier question.
He finally looks up at Fred, eyes blazing with a barely restrained passion.
George seems to sense his thoughts.  Quietly, he tells Harry, “Omegas are great friends most of the time.  We’re natural allies and usually Covens find that allowing their Omegas to interact can smooth over a lot of hurt feelings and conflict.  But we’re edgy during season, territorial.  To our hind brains, another Omega in season is competition, even though there aren't any Alphas here to fight over us.  It’s best not to take anything anyone says personally until they’re back in their right minds.”
Fleur you probably should pack too, I think Raphe is planning on heading to the hospital and then back to your Coven.”
A gift.
It varies how quickly, depending on the item.
That’s not what I mean.
“For you,
Hermione looks confused.
He shifts Harry over to Hermione and finally starts to come back to himself as he breathes in her Alpha scent.  It feels like safety and he relaxes.  Meanwhile the rest of the Coven has found them, and Hermione nods them over to the bonfire that has started up on the other side of the Quidditch Pitch that is being used for the Samhain festivities.
I tried to get over to George, get him out of the way or something, but Raphe stopped me.
“In this case - if I were a muggle and I came across a ghoul or something and never understood that it was just one aspect of a wider world, I think I would rather not know.
“Yes.
The Captain of the Arrows knows it too because he’s calling a time out.
“Oh but whatever will you say?” Ron croons in a sing-song voice, ignoring Harry’s withering glare. “What will you say if Hermione denies you this incredible opportunity?”
He hands it to Harry.
“But I don’t understand.
I had asked her if she could make repairs the No-maj way. She agreed but told me the price would be adjusted accordingly, which I found fair given the additional investment of time.
Oberon’s expression turns a tad wistful.
He had never quite heard the older Weasley sound this way before.  “Kneel, Omega,” Fred said icily and Harry turned back around to see George smoothly sliding to his knees.  He heard the portrait slam closed behind his turned back.
They’re all having breakfast together, later in the morning, thankfully, than the day prior.
She paused and smiled at them again for a second.  “The thing you have to remember is that we all go through this.  No Wizard is immune to Stricture so we’ve all been where you’re sitting now, be it a few months or a few years after Presentation.  The good news I have for you is that this is a gift.  Your presentations, our culture, it’s a gift from Magic itself that allows us to continue Wizard kind.  It might be scary but this battle to understand this new part of yourselves is a fight you’re going to win.  Your instincts are powerful things and the Coven system grew out of this instinctual framework. It won’t be a long time before this seems completely natural to you.”
“Zacharias Smith,” she said in an aside to Harry before addressing George primly. “He’s quite well. Thank you very much.”
In spite of the conversation with Ron and the continued confidence in his choice during the Order meeting, the lingering sense of his Alpha’s anger hangs over him like a cloud.
“People have gone crazy in this place,” Harry responds.  “Fred ordered George to kneel, for Merlin’s sake.  Then Nott and Malfoy act all weird…”
You put yourself in danger and went against my express orders.
And he and Fred have been fighting about something the whole time we’ve been here.”
Fred’s eyes flit to her, but they go back to Ron almost immediately, teeth bared just slightly.
George continues, “Before we Presented, we were like one person with two bodies.
“What about those who never Present at all?” Harry couldn’t help but ask, thinking of Neville and how the boy had started to look more and more forlorn as he was obviously becoming more and more aware that he was being excluded from something.  Harry’s heart ached to reach out to his friend, and he’d tried spending more time with him, but his schedule was busy these days between the Omegas and school.
for any tales of when the Ministry had to Oblivate muggles who came across ghosts in their daily lives.
“Yeah,” Susan agrees.
Thankfully, the jumpers seem to have broken the ice a bit, and things resume a semblance of normalcy over the course of breakfast.
“Mister Travers,” McGonagall says, “while I appreciate your efforts here, I am afraid that the school cannot, in good conscience, permit Omega Potter and Alpha Granger’s Coven to leave the grounds.
Harry frowns.
I have heard stories about the giant squid.”
Harry had found meeting her earlier a little nerve-wracking, all truth be told and in meeting her again, he finds himself sort of falling away from the crowd around them and into his own head, feet still trudging in tandem with the group around him in the direction of the apparition point, but thought detaching itself and he finds himself falling out of the conversation.
I can sense the magic emanating from it right up until the moment I touch it.
The blonde smiles.
“Not always in the Weasley’s garden, of course.
Angelina shifts at his side, looking ready for a fight, dark eyes flitting around the table, rapidly, assessing.
Harry keeps his face blank, although this time it is a challenge.  He’s found, especially with Wizard-kind, its better to get information if you don’t quite let on how you’re feeling about what you’re being told.
now and Harry is already feeling less keyed up, though now he has the distinct feeling as though he is teetering on some kind of edge. There’s a risk he could fall right in or he could somehow pull back, avoiding the precipice.
George turned, uncharacteristically flashing her a sneer. “You can tell my brother Harry and I are taking a quick kip out to the Quidditch pitch.  It’s been a while since I’ve flown.”
Harry considers this.
Hermione stops and lets him sit on that for a minute.  Honestly, Harry’s mind is spinning.  He mulls it all over, while Hermione picks absently at the grass.
George points his chin at where Zacharias Smith is, indeed, brooding in a corner, with dark eyes held immobile to the demure shape of Susan, where she’s chatting with Ernie, Roger Davies, the 8th year Ravenclaw Alpha and Polly Chapman, Davies’ Omega.  Susan is obviously aware of the unwanted attention, casting worried glances at Zacharias, as is Ernie whose expression is looking increasingly thunderous even as he tries to engage in pleasant conversation with the other Alpha.
“Is this about Volde-“
Which means she misses the violence that follows, something Harry, frozen in place, very much wishes he too had missed in the minutes that follow.
Harry nods.
Harry gives her an awkward smile.
“But with the right Alpha, they can appeal to the Omega inside of you in a different way.
“I was hoping you might have some free time today and would be willing to speak with me awhile,” Travers says, eyes locked with Harry’s.
They both watch him go.
“That was…strangely thoughtful,” Hermione muses after a minute.
Once an Alpha has switched over though, any challenging Alphas almost always do as well.”
Travers and Leo stay for another hour or so.
“All types.
“Seems like you and Tonks are getting along pretty well.”
“Oi!”
If he’s honest with himself, he has ever since Malfoy stood up for him against Nott, and especially since the Dance.
“Today we’re talking more about the history of Stricture itself,” Burbage is saying at the beginning of their fourth session.  The prior two sessions had covered first the structure of most Covens and second the typical progression of Fledges into adult covens.  In spite of how dubious Harry was of the sessions with Burbage, he could admit that the information had been useful.
“That’s the favor, Alpha.
“That’s the least of what I care about,” Travers responds, frowning at him.
Harry opened his mouth eagerly but Ron rushed on, “And no, I think I’ll let OUR Alpha talk about that with you.”
The two increase their pace to catch up and the foursome makes their way up to their seats where they reconnect with the rest of their respective Covens.
“Harry,” she starts.
Taking the hint, he shifts so he stands a little behind her and tries not to reveal how relieved he is at the action.
He’s going to see what this Courting thing is all about and it can’t hurt anything to have options.
“Harry, may I touch your neck?
Harry’s mouth drops open in surprise.
“Yes.”
Very temporary.
I’ve got half a mind to go to the COA.”
Fred’s just doing the best thing for George, which is his job, by the way, as his Alpha.”
(See the end of the chapter for
They’re sitting far enough down the table from the younger Gryffindors this morning, so Harry doesn’t experience the nauseating rush he would if he had tested the boundaries of Stricture in the presence of the un-Presented when he somewhat resignedly flips out.  Ron looks somewhat sympathetic but he mostly just looks curious so after a moment of embarrassed grumbling he concedes to his friend’s expectant look and unties the letter.
“I’m his Alpha,” Fred says, voice rising as he climbs to his feet.
“Let’s do it.
“Wasn’t aware you were joining us in Transfiguration, Terry,” Ron says, easy as anything and Harry lets some of his irritation with his friend subside.  Boot looks confused for a second before he clearly remembers his mission.
Harry smiles.
What does it mean, that another Alpha would Settle me?
After a moment, Fred, following Hermione’s lead hands the vial to a surprised-looking George, raising his eyebrow at him in question.
Really.”
“Hermione’s the only female Alpha in the school right now and you and George are the only male Omegas.  Those are rare presentations, mate.  But there are about seven female omegas in total.”
Just thought it would be easier at first with my brother being the Alpha….”
Harry breathes a little easier in the absence of Molly and Fred’s anger and George’s distress.
Harry furrows his brow, not really catching his drift until… oh.
Confused, the trio finishes up - Harry feeling more awake after downing his third cup of tea, with a disapproving Hermione looking on - and heads up to the Headmaster’s office.
As one, the Betas bow to the Alpha in front of them.  All of the Alphas stand, stone-faced to accept the offering.
“Sometimes,” Remus says.
The expression is one of the most unguarded Harry’s ever seen on the older man’s face.
He accepts the parchment, lifting a hand to push up his glasses before squinting and starting to read though the text.
The look Ron shoots Fred in turn is baleful.
And of course we can change anything you don’t like.
He feels a deep seated need for forgiveness, like an ache.
“I really appreciate that, Mione,” Harry says, startled at her thoughtfulness.
There’s quiet for a moment before the strawberry blonde Hufflepuff Beta to Harry’s left leans forward to speak in a rush, “My mother just told me she didn’t give birth to me and instead my Aunt Nadia, who is the Coven’s omega, did! How could they keep that kind of secret from me?”
Remus settles back in the chair.
When I release the object, the magic regathers and the enchantment resumes.”
“And will you obey the Alpha, the leader of our Coven.”
“Hello,” Travers says, voice warm and with hallmarks of a slight American Southern accent.
“You grew up with Muggles, didn’t you?” Oberon asked.
Susan flushes, glancing around quickly to see if George’s exuberance had attracted any of the other Omega’s attention.
I look forward to our next meeting.”
The official turned to look Harry square in the eyes.  Abruptly his demeanor shifted.  “Mr. Potter, might I speak to you privately?”
I just asked around and found another tailor, Muggle this time, and very fine worksmanship.
Groaning he buries his head in his hands and fights back tears, caught somewhere between acute contrition and slow-burning rage.
Arthur smiles, a little sadly.
“George, what do you want me to do?”
“What do you mean,” Hermione breaks in quickly, ignoring Harry’s irritation at being interrupted.  “About Nott and Malfoy?  What did they say?  Did they touch you?”
“Yea, I’m sure it was.  But my question is more about you.  Did you … feel … anything strange.”
Smith has no reaction but Nott’s lips tilt a little, clearly pleased.
“I know, I know,” he mutters softly and cups a gentle hand around Harry’s cheek.  Harry leans into the touch, cool against his heated flesh and lets out a sound somewhere between a sob and a moan and George leads him to the four poster bed with its thin, cool sheets and settles him atop them.
Harry thinks again.
Harry doesn’t need to unroll it to know it’s the contract.
Harry felt a little wrong-footed at the non-sequitur but he took a second, gave it some thought.  “I guess…I haven’t really thought about it, but yea, Wizards definitely have way less kids than Muggles.  When we were younger, I kind of thought that there just a bunch of other schools where the rest of the magical kids were but….I guess the Triwizard Tournament kind of opened my eyes.  There aren’t many more schools, are there?”
Ron shifted, a little bit uncomfortable.  “It’s kind of hard to explain.  I guess there are two things really — one is that inter-Coven relationships are led by Alphas and with the exception of emergencies, a Beta really can’t stand in an Alpha’s place when dealing with other Covens.  There’s a lot of structure around that actually.  The second is that if the Coven has any Omegas, they can’t take care of them without an Alpha.  Omegas really rely on Alphas.”
As the final red recedes from his face, Harry re-directs the conversation, tugging his hand away.
The purpose of the Ball was to allow Covens to interact with each other in the way they would when they were fully-fledged.  It was a practice opportunity, essentially, to successfully navigate Coven expectations and politics in the way they would need to once they graduated and officially joined Wizarding Society.
“Betas serve the Alpha,” Fred says, “They are the force that keeps our Society going.  As in days in yore, as now, Beta’s obey the Alpha to honor their Covens and protect our way of life.  As the Alphas honor tradition, so Betas honor Alphas.”
Keeping him safe, keeping them all safe.
to her hips.
“Here,” Smith says, cutting in abruptly and shouldering his Alpha out of the way.
“So we figured there was a not insignificant chance you’d present Omega.  Which brought up a few concerns.  The first was your inheritance…”
He had rather expected to just receive a courting proposal and this - for all that it was a surprise - also impressed him.
“What did you do about the tailor?” he asks,
She subsides.
“Thank you.”
Susan pats his leg atop the blanket then retracts and goes quiet.  They sit for a long time in a companionable silence.
“We’ve a game we’d like to get back to.”
I had an excellent time today and enjoyed both you and your Covens’ company. As far as I’m concerned, it’s Belle’s decision what she tells people about her condition.
Suddenly struck by unexpected emotion, Harry flinches back, drops his eyes, knows his scent is edging toward distress.
“What your Headmaster has not yet mentioned is that Covens can be rampant with Omega abuse,” the cranky looking Ministry official spoke up suddenly.  The man had been sitting in a chair across the room from the rest of them, dressed in drab brown robe and looking entirely uninterested in the proceedings. He had a large black portfolio in his hands that he had previously been engrossed in when Harry had woken up to find his hospital room quite filled with people.  At the official’s words, the rest of the room swiveled to appraise him and he continued without much ado.  “Which is why the COA registers every new Omega and ensures that they are being properly cared for.”
Harry frowns at Travers in response.
Clearly, I miscalculated and hurt your feelings.
She wants us to be involved upfront, to have a voice in the decision-making process.
Told me it would only make things worse to get in the middle of it.
Needed to be humiliated in front of all my friends as well?”
The horn sounds, calling the spectators to the stands and Harry and Oberon find Ron and Leo a few feet behind them.
Hermione half turned to look at Ron. “Ron, go gather the Coven.  It’s time.  Meet Harry and me in the Room of Requirement in about an hour.   Have Dean run to the Owlery first and send Malfoy some of the chocolate stock and a note of thanks from me.”
It’s a confusing medley of contrary emotions and his whole body trembles in physical response.
“I guess I hadn’t realized that your immunity extended to such things.
“And I agree, I’m less opposed to this whole idea now too.
“Keyed directly to a flat in Hogsmeade owned by a member of my Coven,” Travers adds.
“C’mon Fred, let’s talk.”
Harry blushes.
We can remember the people we’ve met not just by their faces or their voices but also by their scents.
Malfoy
“I’ve heard of Fight before - we talked about it in Burbage’s seminar.
I’m sure he wouldn’t have asked to Court you if he wasn’t serious about it.”
I promise you she will apologize.
“What the bloody hell do you think, Potter?  Making sure we don’t wander off begging any old alpha for a good knot.”
Call me Leo."
“But this does make me happier about the whole thing.
It’s run through the line for more than seven generations and my ancestors have had the gamut of various enchantments fail on them.”
When all the Omega’s are kneeling, heads bent demurely, Fred continues; now standing at the front of his own Coven to face off across from his kneeling brother.
“Do you…live…here Remus?” Harry asks, voice hesitating.
“Bill came as a surprise,” Fleur said.
This ends up being correct and after George has experienced it for the first time, he whimpers out pleas for Harry to cast it again and again.  Harry does so, but more sparingly than George would like as he doesn’t want it to become too much of a crutch.  He teaches the spell to Polly, who quirks an eyebrow up in impressed surprise.
As soon as they take notice of the Omegas, they both fall immediately silently and the four stare awkwardly at each other for a moment before Fleur takes charge of the situation.
Everyone relaxes at this and pockets their wands, though the tension doesn’t dissipate entirely.
She too pulls it up for a kiss, but her greeting is perfunctory, barely a brush of her lips to his knuckles before she's released him and said, "Nice to meet you.
considered polite to warn those who will be in the company of an Empath of their condition so they can guard themselves against unwanted emotional energies.
She always left a scent-object behind to help me tolerate it.
“Thank Merlin,” Harry groaned.  “That was the most awkward conversation of my life.”
“If you’re lucky, you might even get the chance to tickle its tentacles,” he informs Travers and the man smiles in delight.
Thanks Fleur.”
Harry’s always loved Molly’s craft, and he can’t help but feel a little bit prideful that his is the only one with such intricate embellishment.
She looks at him, eyes shining and Harry realizes she is
“Watch it Potter,” Malfoy said, even as he released Harry’s arm after steadying him.  Harry opened his mouth to apologize but a wave of dizziness passed over him again and he swayed.  Malfoy’s eyes narrowed at this, and a keen gaze swept over Harry, taking in the swaying, the sheen of sweat, and the tremors that seemed to pass through him every few seconds.
“What does this have to do with Omegas?”
“Do you like it?”
Not able to effectively fight his blush, Harry turned to the woman, offering his hand to her as well.
In less dramatic circumstances…well things in the Astronomy Tower would have turned out very different that day, at least, had Harry or George had access to this Potion.
“In a way at least.
“I want you to treat me like your brother, not just your Omega,” George finally answers, voice soft.
He turns to Travers.
“And the thing you did with my neck?”
“Oh, Harry,” Ron looks surprised, but he pulls Harry closer to him, giving him a tight hug.  It should be awkward - they aren’t physically affectionate like that usually - but instead Harry feels instantly comforted nosing into where the crook of Ron’s neck meets his shoulder to soak in his calming Beta pheromones.
Hermione, sitting to Ron’s left, fingers her wand.
You no longer scent un-Settled.”
The slight tension is interrupted when Ron comes into view, waving at Harry pointedly.
He shifts his weight a little and then, making up his mind impulsively he reaches up to peck Oberon on the lips.
“I better have a voice in that!” Harry replied, appalled.
“But I understand why you didn’t,” this he says, looking directly at Belle, who meets his eyes only to look down at her feet, clearly not prepared for the kindness she sees there.
Do you remember?”
“Well then, see you back at the school.”
“I’m afraid that it is old tradition to have the Alpha of your Coven explain the state of the world to newly presented Omegas.  It’s an important rite of passage for Alphas and Omegas alike, and I will not interfere with it.  However, although I cannot proffer any specifics, I do want you to know that you have a voice.  You have the right to have a say in any mating agreements, first of all…”
Feeling sullen, Harry leans back himself, crossing his arms and fighting to keep his face expressionless while Stebbins natters something he doesn’t pay attention to, lost in thought as to what she had just told him.  Whatever the Alpha asked, the answer was brief because it wasn’t much longer before Burbage was standing up and ushering them out of the room.
Fred’s not demanding that George bond this Alpha, he’s just asking for a thoughtful response!
“So you’re in control of everything my parents, everything Sirius left me?” Harry asked quietly.  He had never been particularly attached to the gold in his vaults at Gringotts, but it had been a comfort to know that it was there.  The fact that it could be stripped away from him just like that didn’t feel real.
Harry shrugs.
“Thank you for the honor, Omega Potter.  It is my fervent hope you will allow another opportunity sometime soon.”
Didn’t learn too much about the others in the Coven yet, but Leo says she’s dating one of the Betas. What does Oberon do, Harry?”
I think he was worried that I would form Coven bonds that were too strong in the American school.
I’m not so proud to insist I must be right when three brothers claim I’m wrong.”
He was using Ron as his example - the boy had impressed him recently with his even-keeled response to things.
Fleur smiles slightly but she’s quiet for a long moment, contemplative.
“You basically just told me I’m going to go into heat,” Harry says shortly, not in the mood to be entertained.
‘Mione,” Ron says, looking directly at her.
The Empath’s presence escalates emotions by many magnitudes but it is possibly to magically protect oneself against an Empath’s effects if one is given the warning that such protections are necesssary.”
“She’s a curse breaker, but not for Gringotts, like Bill.
But it can be lonely too - I don’t see the Coven as often as I’d like.
Oberon smiles, the blue of his eyes glinting as he gazes at Harry with sparkling intensity.
“He said ‘no’, Fred,” Ron cuts in, Fred glowers but pauses, weighing.
Hermione looks like she has pieced something together though, and accustomed as he is to her explaining most things about the Wizarding World to him, he simply turns a patient expression to her.
“I’m glad they let you come back to school,” Padma says softly.
“Um….ok?” Harry says, flummoxed.  What exactly is he supposed to do with that?
George is quiet for a few moments, but his scent shifts again, moving away from distressed to a more general note of stress with a touch of anger.
“There’s a spell.
“The Headmaster has been informed of your plans?”
“Tell me about her,” Harry prompts, casting his eyes up to catch Oberon’s who smiles back before looking up in thought as they continue their meandering walk around the pitch.
Hermione navigates them to where Malfoy is standing with an arm slung around Padma.  Harry fights back the irrational wave of jealousy that springs up in him at the sight but Malfoy smiles at them both, friendly enough, and drops his arm from around Padma after a quick squeeze to her shoulder.
“Come now Granger, Weasley, we come in peace.
Harry blinked, surprised at the request.  Almost against his will he shot a look to Hermione who tipped her head to the side - a shrug, if he was reading her body language correctly.  His decision.  He looked up at the Headmaster who twinkled down at him.
“Actually, I didn’t ask.”
Malfoy straight out laughs, not looking at all perturbed at being interrupted.
“I’m sure she’s beating herself up for letting her emotions get the better of her.
Oberon looks thoughtful.
“For your sake, she’d better.”
Harry thinks for a moment.
The school has been transitioning young Wizards into this strange new dynamic for years and for the most part, they have it down pat.  There’s a basic education class that Harry, like all of the newly Presented, will have to attend for the first 6 months of presentation.  Apparently they start the class anew for a fresh cadre of students every 6 weeks for anyone who presented in the prior cycle.  Harry is fortunate enough to have presented right at the tail end of the cycle, so there’s a new class starting about a week after he Presents.
Though he has always appreciated gifts more because of it, in a way.
The four engage in pleasant conversation.  Harry ribs Malfoy for the recent Slytherin Quidditch loss. “Marcus really needed to re-consider his strategy during the last half of that game,” Malfoy says irritably.  “He thought having the Beaters focus on distracting Chang would be a  good enough distraction for me to find the Snitch and win quickly, but instead it ruined our Defense and their Chasers made a record number of goals.  He should have trusted me more.  Chang’s a good seeker but  I’m at least as good as her.  It might have been a more viable strategy if we were playing against Gryffindor, but it was an unnecessary sacrifice against Ravenclaw.”
Dumbledore’s speech had the tone of something that had been said more than a few times, and Harry was starting to believe that this really was a situation that had not been conspired against him.  And it was true that his friends had been a bit standoffish this year.  They hadn’t been…ignoring him… per se, but they had been spending a lot more time together without him.  He had thought at first it was just Hermione and Ron’s budding romantic relationship and had worked hard not to feel like a third wheel.  It was almost a relief to find out that there was this additional factor at play.
“Me first, it’s only fair.”
Harry nods but responds, “As much as I appreciate that, I have a feeling the last thing I’m going to want during season is you anywhere near me.”
Behind her, Arthur stands demurely, taller frame visible over her shoulder.
“Their hold?” Harry asks, barely sure where to start unpacking everything she had just said.
“As do I.”
They hold things together well enough for Christmas itself, but the morning after, reality reasserts itself with a ferocity for which they are all revealed to be woefully unprepared.
Susan groans, shifting in discomfort on the couch, “Can’t get any worse for me.”
She’s carrying a bundle of knitted goods and it’s only when she is handing out a Weasley sweater to each person sitting around the table, that Harry realizes what day it is.
I want to see that you’re what I am looking for as much as the other way around.”
Ron isn’t often serious in this way, but when he is, it was always about something important and often something neither of the others had considered.
They both turn their gaze to him.
“Went to the American Institute for Magical Arts.
“I’ve never really given that any thought.
“I grew up in Texas,” Travers volunteers, as they walk through the halls, Harry occassionally pointing out a piece of interest.
Fleur, quiet, slips over as well, sitting on the edge of the other side of the bed, and trailing a hand to settle on the boy’s upper arm.
“I love Quidditch, but it’s flying itself that brings me the greatest joy,” Harry tells the older man after a moment.
“Keep seeing that stupid reindeer move out of the corner of my eye.”
Harry looks at him questioningly and he answers the unasked question.
He pulls his wand out from his robe, and reaching beneath his robe he fingers the stopper of the vial of
She was being avoided by both of her twin sons and Harry could tell it was taking a toll on her.
“Do you have a proposal?” Hermione asks Ron.
Soothed the beast, too.
“A … comedian…?”
“He’ll be just fine, Harry.
Raphe is probably ready by now too.
“Where. Have. You. Been.”  He seethes, interrupting her before she can try to placate him. True to form, Hermione’s eyes harden at his tone, a mulish expression crossing her face.
“I know that Harry. You know I hate this too.”
Harry raises a brow at that phrasing.
Let the two of them duke it out.
“Sounds a tad…boring.”
He hadn’t realized until now how anxious he had been throughout the whole holiday regarding her.
Harry runs a thumb over the top of Susan’s hand, hoping he can give her some small degree of comfort.  If nothing else, he can empathize with the loss of family by violent means.  After a moment, Susan continues.
I think we should get ahead of it.”
“You heard George,” Ron says to his brother, shrugging.
“Remus. Thank you.
Harry hasn’t spent the last 3 years becoming intimately familiar with his friends’ quirks for nothing.  It’s reciprocal.  He can see the recognition of his rage in Hermione’s expression immediately.  What he doesn’t see is any contrition, and that just spikes his ire further.
They both nod and Padma manages a smile.
“Ah yes, I saw your Alpha conferring with her Second not long ago outside the library.  A favorite haunt of hers, no?  Perhaps you should go there.  Directly.”
“A question for a question then,” Harry determines, giving Draco a challenging look.
Ron groans.
As such, almost all of the other Omegas have returned and congregated down in the Quarters.
She goes quiet and then Harry realizes the ramifications.  “Oh Susan, I’m so sorry.”
“I don’t disagree with you, Harry,” Ron said somberly.  “It must be bloody frustrating to have to deal with all this nonsense.  I’m sorry.”
And that’s the point.
“Just give me a moment, Hermione.”
Harry swallowed down his initial reaction.
After a moment, it proffers the vial to Hermione instead who accepts it graciously with a quick little smile at her boyfriend.
“No,” Travers replies, tone easy.
Harry stifled a noise of discomfort as he shifted on the bench he was sharing with his Potions partner.  Hermione cast him a quick glance as she processed the not quite successfully muffled sound, then focused again on the rather complicated brew in front of them.  Harry tried to powder the horn in front of him as finely as required by the recipe, but his hands were trembling and he knew he was fighting a losing battle.  With a sigh he nudged his work over to Hermione who gave him a somewhat aggrieved look but took over the task without complaint.  Trying to make himself useful, he ignored his sudden chills and the way that his body had suddenly started to produce an unusual amount of sweat, and stood up to go gather the next batch of ingredients.
“Lily was an incredibly kind soul.
I’m so happy to hear that.”
There are at least three rooms in addition to a bathroom - a bedroom, a small kitchen, and a living area where a small couch and sofa chair, desk, and bookshelf have all been fitted.
Ron’s third arm, clearly acting out on the boy’s curiosity, reaches out to snatch up one of the Potions.
Hermione smiled slightly but she looked distracted.  “Thanks, Harry.  Go with Ron, now.”
“Sorry, love,” George responds, patting her foot softly from where its lain under the blanket.  “At least it won’t last too long.”
“Yes.
“The idea is that a trusted Alpha can stand in between the Omega’s inheritance and any Alpha that might seek to take advantage.”
“I am very sorry Omega Potter.
“The Order isn’t our enemy,” Harry reminds them both, “and I’m not naive, I know that my best interest isn’t their top priority, but I’m pretty confident I know what it is - ending a war.
She doesn't ask him how he got himself back to normal, even though she must have some inkling that he went to another Alpha for help and he doesn't offer up the information either.
Bill won’t make you do anything you don’t want to do and it isn’t what you fear, I promise.”
“Dad, I might not have the same pheromone sensitivity as Alphas and Omegas, but I still have eyes that see and ears that hear.”
"We can't go out there Harry, we don't know what's happening.
Did you and Hermione argue?”
McGonagall asks.
“If your mum has the ingredients, Harry and I can teach you.”
Someone must have made a run to the kitchens because there are numerous treats nestled on the table in the center of the couches.
"What is it?" Harry demands and Fleur turns to him, her face a confusing mixture of relief and anxiety.
“There are other things we can do,” Hermione says calmly.  “There are things that help with the pre-season symptoms.  Sugary foods, heating pads, some potions.  I’ve asked Snape for some time in the lab to brew some of those and he agreed with only a minimal amount of belligerence.”
Fleur makes a little growl but Bill tisks at her.
“I’m not some damsel in distress, Hermione.  In case you’ve forgotten I’ve taken care of myself my whole life and saved you and Ron more than once at that.”
Susan shakes her head.  “No.  Well, at least not exactly.  It was more of an insight into a potential future.  Something that could happen.  When my great-Oma was in his first season following my grandmother’s birth, at its height, my great-grandfather saw a premonition of his mate having loving sex with his Second.  It was not the first premonition he had experienced with my great-Oma, so he knew the vision could become true.  He flew into a jealous rage.  My great-Oma didn’t make it out of season alive.”
Harry goes willingly enough and waves his hand at Oberon, eyes bright.
Harry slumps a little more against Bill and he thinks he loses a little bit of time, because while he doesn’t process much, it seems like much later when Bill removes his hand and Harry slowly starts to come back into himself.
“Yea, you’re pretty lucky,” Hermione agreed, smiling at him.
“I would like my Sponsor to be present as well, then.”
~Late October~
“Hermione,” Mrs Granger said gently.
Malfoy paused and cast a quick glance at Padma, “We’ll see.  I may have other priorities.”
“My family made me have one during the summer and it was awful.”
What do you think? Do you think Belvina will be able to get past what happened?
“Oh please, George, as if you haven’t had to deal with me in season a dozen times already.”
“We need to adjust for the consumer’s personal characteristics,” George agrees, looking thoughtful.
“That’s the thing about this sport,” Oberon yells at him, voice just barely above the crowd’s.
She departs with a wave right before the entrance and the two Omegas walk into a somewhat raucous celebration.
Ron rolls his eyes.
“I can’t tell you about Coven dynamics without your Alpha’s permission Harry,” George continued, voice soft, eyes flashing when Harry was about to interject, “BUT, nothing is stopping you from keeping your eyes open; what with you being newly presented and all.”
“Great, now that that awkwardness is behind us, might we visit the lake?
“An alliance with the Order,” Harry murmurs, not wanting to hide that they’d already been discussing it.
“Me? Why?”
Remus gives him a sharp look then looks down into the cup in his hands.
They’d yet to receive a signed copy from the Alpha and the few times that Harry had seen him in the days since they had returned to Hogwarts, the Alpha had dodged him.
“Oh,” he says, feeling strangely numb.
But that was the wrong thing to say, because now Harry is thinking of Alphas.  Unbidden the memory of that fraught interaction between himself, Nott, and Malfoy rises to the forefront of his mind and Harry whimpers as he recalls the scent of the two Alphas, caught in a battle of wills over him.  He remember Nott’s low growl and Malfoy’s scent rising in challenge.  Almost beyond his notice, he comes.
“Harry…”
“That’s all I ask.”
“How’s Zachy-bear?” George asked, and Harry raised his eyebrows in question.  Distraction accomplished as Susan blushed at the question.
He finds the boy intriguing, and he’s flattered at the proposal.
“And no, George, I’m not going to give you all the details.
An Alpha’s primal state, driven by instinct.
Hermione nods, looking sad.  “It’s true.  It seems to be a side effect of magic.  Betas alone aren’t strong enough to pass it down.  Usually a Beta pair is completely infertile but, rarely, they produce Squibs.  Only Alphas and Omegas, who are significantly stronger magically seem to be able to pass down the full magical gene expression.  It seems like that’s why these dynamics popped up in the first place - evolutionary markers to identify who could successfully reproduce.
You didn’t think I was humiliated enough?
Harry furrowed his brows.  “I thought that all of the Wizarding World is based around Covens.  If he’s unpresented, then the Stricture means we can’t even tell him anything about this…”
The three of them stand there for what feels like forever, tension racketing up until suddenly, Nott seems to break.  He turns on his heel, and without a word, walks away.  Harry turns his body a little to watch him walk away, feeling a larger sense of relief than he would have thought the situation really warranted.  After Nott’s turned the corner, Harry turns to appraise Malfoy, raising an eyebrow in question.
“Zacharias Smith isn’t taking Susan’s rejection well,” Harry tells his Alpha.  “George thinks there will be trouble.”
“It’s not always a logical progression.
At first…at first we weren’t even sure…but Bill was just unconscious and that seemed to calm Fred down.
“This is about setting a precedent with the Order.
“Thanks Dean. I’ll make a run next time I’m in Hogsmeade.  Now, this is Harry’s first Coven meeting and he’ll be our first order of business.”
He turns to Ron, who peeks up at him over the cover of the magazine.
But the Cannon’s Seeker had been at a far lower height and closer to the Snitch when it all began and he comes out of the dive easily ahead, golden snitch gleaming from between his fingers where he held it aloft in a victorious grip.
He advised me on what precautions might be best suited to this excursion.
I don’t have anything else for you on this, but I do think we should have a conversation about another topic.”
Harry’s not entirely sure when he went from irritated and vaguely uncomfortable to outright scorching, but the tears are as much of a surprise to him.  George casts a Tempus and whistles low when he sees the time. “Man Harry that’s a quick progression.  I guess we don’t know what time you went into pre-Heat but if we assume it was right before breakfast, you’ve slipped into full season in only four hours.  Padma’s not even back yet.”  He looks a little worried, actually, not that Harry has the energy to spend on that.  He’s too busy pulling at his clothes, which are stifling him.
“No lies, right?” Harry questions and Travers nods, somberly.
Never much of a narcissist, Harry considers that perhaps Malfoy’s behavior isn’t about him afterall.
“But what happened, Ron?
“Granger,” Malfoy raised his voice abruptly, reaching out again to clasp under Harry’s elbow, holding him upright even as he continued to sway.  “Potter needs the Hospital Wing.”
Finally, he shrugs.
Can’t expect perfection right off the bat.”
He's never been good with other people's tears, especially her's.
While Ron and Hermione head off to the Hospital Wing to set Ron’s body to rights, Harry and George wander down to the Omega Quarters to check in with their compatriots. Ginny accompanies them down, a discrete enough escort that even George doesn’t chafe at her presence.
a few steps out of the room before Hermione blows past him, stomping away back in the direction of the frog pond.
By this point he’s rather used to the “bigger on the inside” aspect of Wizarding tents, but given that Hermione’s had been pretty modest overall - just a room for the beds with an ensuite bathroom - the scale of Remus’ takes him by surprise.
Ron has found Harry by now and he and Dean had crowded to either side to watch the spectacle.  “The professors couldn’t interfere,” Ron told Harry quietly, obviously sensing his question.  “This is an official Coven event and it is agreed that Coven dynamics rule.  Ernie has the absolute right to punish his Second and to defend any attack against his Omega.  Are you okay, mate?”
The giant squid fails to make an appearance, but Harry and Travers have a good enough time regardless, just chatting casually.
“I’d like that.”
Fleur clears her throat.
George chuckled.  “Yea, mate, it’s like that for all of us for the first few weeks. Stricture is a real doozy, doesn’t let you prepare at all.  Would be nice to have some warning, y’know? ‘Specially for people like us.”
The smile she sends back to him is decidedly watery and Harry purposefully lets himself get distracted by the fire while she composes herself.
He makes for the door but Fleur throws out an arm to stop him, looking worried.
“What about Neville?”
Oberon holds out both palms in a placating manner.
You could release the spell at any time, and you’d have a good remembrance of your mother’s scent for the rest of your days.
First that proximity spell, then the Fight and now what? You’re going to force him to consider a proposal he has no interest in?
Anything else you can think of Ron? You obviously know more about this than either of us.
He’s very evidently waiting for them, standing directly outside and looking patently impatient.
“I grew up with my aunt and uncle too, you know.
“It’s power,” Harry finishes.
“I am sorry for my rudeness in making you wait—,” Malfoy starts.
Harry squints dubiously at his companion.
Harry retract his hand and Fleur stands up, moves to her own bed and trunk, gathering the few belongings she has laying about, still listening as Ron and Harry continue speaking in low tones.
“How is that okay?” Harry snapped, completely appalled.
“It doesn’t do a single thing I want it to do, not to mention it doesn’t even look like my other arms!”
He doesn’t owe her anything necessarily, but he does want to trust her.
Harry eyes the girl, prior frustration evaporated.
“It’s a muggle term,” Hermione informed him.  “Public display of affection.  And we’ll do our best, Harry.”
It’s just a bump to the head.”
The man nips gently at Harry’s lower lip before he pulls back with a sigh.
At the removal of her hand, Harry feels his mind start to clear, but his body is behind the curve.  It’s several minutes before he feels normal again.  He can’t bare to look at his friend.  He’s surprised to find himself shaking.
They all sit their contentedly for a moment and if Harry had been in his right mind he would probably feel embarrassed at the intimacy of it all, but instead he just feels a bone deep relaxation as he soaks in the Alpha’s calming pheremones.
If Harry had to place money at this point he’d bet the Cannons will win.
Hermione looks like she wants to be amused at this but her scent is still potent with anger so she’s frowning when she tells him, “Empaths are born with a genetic magical condition in which they pick up upon, process, and recalibrate emotional energy.
I’ve seen you cast a few spells tonight.”
Ginny rolls her eyes while Hermione twitches from what Harry can only assume is stifled laugher from behind her book and Harry himself is unable to suppress an amused snort.
“It’s called slick,” George tells him gently, kindly offering him an arm to pull him off the bed enough to place a thick pad beneath him to catch  the fluid before it soaks the mattress.  “And I know it doesn’t feel this way now, but you’re lucky it is coming so easily and so early in your cycle Harry.  You’ll be happy for it when you have an Alpha.”
Instead of answering, he asks instead, “Why’d you do it? Give in, I mean?”
“Are you sure….I mean…,” Harry struggles to find the right words.
“We don’t want anything from you,” George says, voice as solemn and serious as anything.
“My name is Vincent and although you cannot yet scent it, I am a Beta.  I apologize for being so abrupt with your Alpha, but I find it better for Coven leaders to consider the COA as a less than friendly institution, the more they should fear breaking the law as it regards the abuse of Omegas.”
Ron’s keeping his peace but a frown mars his features.
At around mid-day he snags two cups of cocoa and carries them down to where Remus’ tent is settled adjacent to Hermione’s.
As one, the Alphas use levitation to send their loaves of bread into the fire.  They hover there, in the flames for a moment, before disintegrating into ash.  In some sense, it may seem silly, but Harry was attuned with the magic around them and right now it was thrumming.  This was important, it meant something.
“It can be,” Bill agrees.
“Wait,” Harry interrupted, “That makes so much sense.  Of course your mum is an Alpha.”
He is not disappointed.
I don’t doubt that mum is trying to protect me.
“An emissary?
“Yes,” Harry agrees, catching Traver’s gaze, who keeps it with a warm smile.
She may have been amplifying the emotion earlier, but he can see she inherently tends toward the ill-natured and perhaps the sadness he was picking up for her was real.
“I don’t even know how I’m supposed to look at you, mate,” Ron mutters.
“You first,” he challenges.
If we court, this isn’t a done deal.
“Are you going to be okay? My sense for this stuff isn’t as good as an Alpha’s but I can tell you’re still a little shaky.”
Harry raises a brow, “Oh?”
about this whole thing.
“I won’t lie and say I’m not a little confused,” Harry admitted, flopping into the chair opposite and moving a hand up to rub against his temple.  He’s started to be able to pick up traces of people’s designation now, but the new information is making him a little dizzy.  It’s almost like a smell, but not really.  He could tell that Ron was a Beta earlier, just by being in the same room with him, it was intuitive, and now he can tell that George is an omega.  It’s frankly weird.
George was in his usual spot in the Common Room when Harry approaches him, poring over a Charms textbook in an armchair near the fireplace.  Harry would’ve previously thought him to be alone, but more attuned now to the hidden dynamics of his peers, he noted Angelina’s attentiveness from across the room.
“Not a problem, dear.”  Then the Ravenclaw is gone. Susan stands and stretches then looks at George questioningly.
“Looks a little tricky,” he comments and Harry laughs.
Both Fred and Harry immediately blush red at the intimate action.
The redhead steps back toward the plant he’d been pretending to examine, this time dropping the pretense to instead openly watch the pair with a protective gleam to his eyes.
Maybe his decision would be different if he wasn’t already committed to courting Travers, but Harry doesn’t have the patience to double guess his decisions and if you’re in for a penny, in for a pound.
Harry processes that for a second, turns his head to catch Ron’s gaze.
he wears now around his neck.
I was making it clear that the Order doesn’t get to dictate our Coven’s choices.”
My date for the evening had reached out to grab my arm and inadvertantly tore the whole sleeve off.
“I do appreciate it, you guys.”
I was thrilled to get your response, but I didn’t feel, in good conscience, that we could begin courting in earnest until the issue was resolved.”
Harry shrugs.  “I did sit through a year of Divination.  Sight is the full expression of future magic.  It’s the highest form of Divination.”
Hermione had risen and walked over to where Harry and Malfoy were standing, significantly apart from the rest of the class working on their Potions, who had also paused to observe the small drama, but had mostly re-focused on their bubbling cauldrons.  “My thanks, Malfoy.”
“We’re a family,” Hermione said firmly and Harry smiled and nodded, reaching out to clap a hand to Ron’s shoulder.
Fred groans, “Not immediately.
And why won’t he talk to me?” Harry presses but Padma just shrugs him off.
My friend, Nymphadora Tonks, said you would be open to meeting with us."
“That was remarkably non-specific, Malfoy,” Harry sighs, tucking the contract into his robes and reaching up to briefly touch his temples with the fingers of his right hand before dropping them to view the Slytherin squarely.
“Give him a little time.
“Ron, Hermione, why don’t you take Harry and go outside.
“Harry needs to know what’s what.”
I still think it was a little hasty to agree to the Order’s proposal so easily, BUT,” she rushes on, clearly sensing Harry has an opinion about that, “I stand by what I said originally.
It’s Malfoy who has cleared his throat - of course it is - and the platinum haired wizard is leaned against the wall up ahead of them, arms crossed casually, but Harry spots the other Slytherin’s wand jutting out beyond his robe from where its clutched in his left hand.  Malfoy hasn’t deigned to address either of them any further and hasn’t glanced at Harry once, but his eyes are fiercely meeting Nott’s and Harry can almost taste the bitterness of a potential challenge in the air.  He fidgets uncomfortably and starts to skirt out from behind Nott - intent on getting away from the whole situation.  But Nott has other ideas and, although he doesn’t tear his eyes away from Nott, he emits that low growling sound again and Harry can’t seem to stop himself from freezing yet again.
Susan lets her hand drop and nods, thoughtful.  She purses her lips and then seems to decide how to proceed.  “The last Omega in my line was my great-grandfather, my grandmother’s Oma.  My other great-grandfather was Alpha, a dangerous man by all accounts.  My grandmother’s Oma was the Bones.  We carry his name because my Alpha grandfather was sent to Azkaban fairly soon after my grandmother was born.  My grandmother didn’t want the reminder of his name ”
But Bill is actively pumping out calming pheremones and Fleur’s warm hand squeezes his and he feels suddenly more relaxed than he’s ever felt before.
“I think you undercut yourself, Omega,” Malfoy demurs, “You’re quite lovely when you dance.”
Harry stares.  “There’s so much that scares me about what you just said, I don’t even know where to start,” he tells her earnestly.  He can see that she’s offended, but honestly, what is he supposed to do with that?
Harry’s quiet.
So it goes.
Was there any good news about Presenting Omega? Merlin.  Harry internally rolled his eyes before casting around for something else to talk about to get them off this dreary topic when Susan was already clearly suffering.
His friends stop a bit back, continuing their conversation without a care.
Instead of worrying himself to the point of frustration, Harry instead tried to focus on his schoolwork, an area that he had sadly let slip given all of the recent events.  Hermione helped him and she spent long hours in the library with him.  She was, of course, ahead in terms of schoolwork, but she spent the extra library time researching what she could about what Susan had told him regarding his ‘gift’ of Premonition.  So far, most of what she had found was rumor and speculation - but she said her research into other branches of the ‘Sight’, which were much more easily found may provide some insight.
What seems like different worlds I get to see, at times.
Potions like this, bought from these high-priced, well-regarded shops, come with a tamper-proof charmed seal; the Potion within becomes useless if not consumed within 10 seconds after breaking the seal.
Hermione nods, clearly having expected the question.  She appraises them all with a slightly raised eyebrow before continuing her slow pacing.  Harry smothers a snort when the ball of light dashes up Luna’s back.
“Look, Potter,
He can see that this is not the easiest conversation for Fleur and he doesn’t want to add to her embarrassment.
“This isn’t any of your business and you’ll do better to stay out of it.”
He has a chiseled clean-shaven face with a strong jaw and sun-kissed skin, entirely unblemished with the exception of a faded scar, perhaps an inch long, cutting down across the left-most part of his right eyebrow.
“Grass is always greener,” George says.  “On the last day of mine, I’d do anything to have it come once a month if only it wouldn’t go on so long.”
“Alpha Voice gives them such an advantage,” he comments, shaking his head.
“How do they rate?” Harry asks Leo as the clamor dies down and the crowd starts the slow trickle out from the Quidditch grounds and back to the appartion site.
You want to sit here and wait to be attacked?"
Hermione makes an apologetic sound as she disentangles herself from Harry and approaches the fire with the other Hogwarts Alphas.  From somewhere inside her robes, she pulls out a long loaf of bread, as do the other Alphas.
“Stop it. Now.”
Hermione blinks, clearly surprised.
There’s a collective pause in the hum of conversation when the two Gryffindor Omegas walk in, with the other Omegas calling out welcomes, before they all continue their small group discussions.
“Mum, please. I know you only want what’s best for George.
Last time I checked, we were pretty interested in the same thing.”
It’s a standoff on the front of intelligence vs cruelty.
“Of course.”
“I had a feeling we’d be doing this in the next couple of days,” George tells him about 15 minutes later as they head over to the Omega Quarters, each of them pulling out one of the requisite books and whispering the password to the bored looking King.  He’s slightly discomfited to find they aren’t alone when they enter.  Susan Bones is there, as is Padma and a sixth year by the name of Olive Hornby who, in spite of being younger than Harry, had presented almost a year before him.  Olive is a brunette with eyes that match her name.  She’s short but slim and her face is all sharp angles with a startling scar across her right cheek, in the shape of a burst star.  She’s a Ravenclaw and he doesn’t know which Coven she’s a part of, but then he’s not as clear on the Covens that have started to develop in the younger year.
George curses under his breath and Fred smirks, the two completely ensconced in their own world.
Seamus sneers back at her but casts his eyes down and away in what appears to be unwilling deference.  Dean just looks thoughtful but he nods at Hermione when she looks at him inquisitively.  “What’s the plan Alpha?” Harry prompts quietly, cutting through the tension.
Rather more reluctantly the other recipients follow his lead.
“I’m afraid I can’t relate.
Can you?”
This Potion…it’s,” George pauses, searching for the right word.
“I’m so sorry Susan,” Harry said, squeezing her hand.  The Hufflepuff shrugged.
At some point, Raphe passes by with Tonks in tow, and Harry makes good on his promise to send in the chaperone to the couple in the living room as requested.
He shoots a look at Harry for help, the only other one who can understand what this kind of Potion means to someone like them.
Harry’s not sure how he can tell, but Bill is clearly the dominant Alpha between the two of them, and Fred is deferring to his judgment.
The magic palpates around them.
Fred’s nose is bandaged up and Harry wonders if it’s lack of knowledge of the appropriate spell to heal it or if Fred fails to heal it out of guilt.
“There are those who believe my strength and your ‘gift’ would make a good match.
He looks at Angelina, rearing for a fight, wand clasped in her hand and eyes glittering with rage as she gazes at Ron.
"You didn't intend to do that to me.
I’m sure that if I had presented Alpha and you Omega, I would have acted just like you.
“So what I want us to pledge today is that Harry has our protection,” she pauses, reaching into her robes and fumbles about in there for a second before pulling out a thing silver pendant in the shape of what Harry recognizes as the Greek letter for ‘omega’.
The Alpha sounds distraught and it immediately tugs at Harry’s heart strings.
After you Presented, I’m sure you’ve noticed that your sense of smell has improved?
“The vast majority of presented witches and wizards are Betas, about six out of every ten wizards.  Out of that remaining four, three usually present Alpha, and form their own covens, while the remaining wizard will present Omega.  Because Omegas are so few in number, they are precious in our world and the main reason the Coven system began in the first place was to ensure the protection of their Omegas.  While our modern society has Covens of all types and dynamics, the original Coven was formed around Alpha and Omega pairs.”
“Olive’s about half-way through pre-season,” Padma informs them and George nods knowingly - the older Gryffindor is very in the loop when it comes to the other Omega’s cycles.  “Harry’s is just starting,” he tells the room and shuffles Harry over to settle in place in front of the fire.
“Doesn’t work like that for Omegas.  If you had two already presented Alphas in different Covens that you were equally as close to, sure, maybe you get a choice; more likely they just fight it out and you end up with the winner.  But it’s a matter of survival for us mate and no one in any Coven is going to believe you don’t belong to Hermione unless you publicly declare for another Alpha and Hermione backs your claim.”
Seamus and Dean snicker next to him and Luna just shoots him that indecipherable smile of hers.  Harry shrugs and plops down on the sofa next to Luna.  “So what do we do here, Alpha?” He can’t help but exaggerate the title just a little bit in teasing and Hermione’s lips twitch before she visibly attempts to recover some solemnity.
Whole Coven would have noticed Fred pulling on the Coven’s magic reserves.
Looking sad, her follows her out.
“She liked Herbology.
“Omega,” she said, “will you do us the honor of joining our Coven?”
The Omegas cast a charm over their attire to appear more casual and swaggered down to the Halloween Ball.  Harry had attended this every year of Hogwarts so far, and knew what to expect, so he distracted himself listening to the band they had brought in and spending time with Neville bobbing for apples, while fighting back his nerves regarding what was to come later that night.
He frowns.
“Bullocks,” Harry muttered, the ramifications only now occurring to him.  Susan is now the one sending him a sympathetic look.
Harry nods and Oberon buys them both hot butter beers, smoothly pulling out the requisite galleon before Harry can even think to offer.
He had even returned to the room he shared with Harry very late last night, long after it would have been appropriate for Harry to try to strike up a conversation.
We’re on the cusp of a war, which I’m sure you’re aware.
Harry finds himself glad for the honsety - he hadn’t been enthused to be courting someone under false pretense, or even pretenses that were obvious enough to both parties but neither wanted to openly admit.
Later, George will tell him that his behavior is entirely normal for an unbound Omega who has not been exposed to Alpha pheromones during a season.  Later, he will witness other Omegas in this dire heat and see his own torturous experience reflected like a mirror.  But for now he feels isolated, alone, even in the presence of the other Omegas, and desolate, assured of the futility of the fight and yet unable to give it up.
“So what happened at the height of my season,” Harry says slowly, turning the thought over in his mind, not liking the bad taste it leaves, “that was, what? A vision? Of the future?”
“Betas can usually have magical children if they pair with an Alpha or Omega, but when Alphas and Omegas reproduce, they always have strong and healthy magical children. Betas who partner with Omegas are the second most successful pairing, but also the rarest.  Alphas and Betas can be hit or miss.
Vincent stood abruptly.  “Well that’s that then.  Best of luck with your new Alpha, Mr Potter.  Call if you need.”
They waited in a brief crowd before Travers proffered tickets and loosed the group on the fields around the Pitch, where vendors had set up shop with their wares prior to the start of the game.
Her garden was magnificent.
“Oh? Did he say what about?” Harry questions.  “Nobody’s quite sure, but Zabini is trying to smooth things over,” she said, nodding her head slightly in the direction of where the two Slytherin’s were engaged in a hushed conversation.
Hermione looks up at him, meets his eyes squarely.  Then something shifts.  The sense he has of her as an Alpha suddenly increases, and the feeling hits him hot and heavy.  Her eyes, usually a pleasant hazel change colors dramatically, first listening to pink before darkening to a deep crimson hue.  He stares at her in shock for a second before the weight of her stare feels like a physical pressure.  He scrabbles backwards from her but her voice, deeper than usual, throaty, stops him in his tracks.  “Stay Omega.”  Harry freezes, panting slightly.  He can’t meet her eyes anymore.
There is a comedian I like who is doing a show at the Three Broomsticks and I’m eager to get your measure of the man.”
“I sure am sorry about your mum’s family, Ron.”  Harry said, gazing at his friend kindly.
“I thought you and Hannah kind of had like…a thing,” Ron said after a moment.  “Can’t imagine she’s going to be very happy with you suddenly all interested in Harry like this?”
“That’s…” Harry goes quiet for a minute, taking it in.
The Cannon’s Seeker is displaying nearly technical perfection in his surveillance, and he’s been able to misdirect two of her Beaters in the course of the game so far.
How is this not Omega abuse?
Letting out a little sigh of relief, Harry tucks the proposal into his robes.
“So do I.”
“What do you care about then?” Harry asks, voice abrupt.
He should drink the Muzzle now, to be safe and ensure that if there is a confrontation he won’t be a liability, but its also such a precious advantage that he doesn’t want to waste it if this is not going to escalate into an attack.
If Travers should decide to use Alpha voice on him, he may not have much of a warning before it happened.
Abruptly, the contentedness exuding from Nott cuts off and turns sour as the Slytherin spins around to face the newcomer, and Harry is shocked to find himself humming low in his throat with a sound he doesn’t think he’s ever made before.  The tense lines in Nott’s back smooth out slightly at the sound and Harry feels a sense of pleasure at having placated the Alpha, in spite of the discomfort he’s so far felt throughout their interaction.
He pointedly turns his gaze to look at the field, trying to catch on to the action which he had only been barely processing during their conversation. He thinks the Seeker on the offending team’s side may have been in pursuit of the Seeker at once point but now she’s back to circling, flying in tight, frustrated z patterns that Harry thinks she’ll regret when she looks back on the day after the match.
“Only because it’s better to be prepared! Not because I wanted you to jump into Courting right away.
“Harry! George!” she exclaims, pouncing up to give them both robust hugs.
Sits himself.
Seamus is the wildcard here.  Hermione had told him when he was learning about how the Coven had come together before Harry had presented that she struggled to agree to let Seamus join to begin with.  At the time, only she, Ron, and Seamus had presented amongst the Gryffindor 6th years.
He likes the energy of it - this is not the teeming masses and chaos of the World Cup, but there’s a healthy number of attendees and there’s an energetic hum in the air.
Harry considers.
Fleur adores him and anyway, Harry is basically a surrogate Weasley.
“You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do,” Hermione promised fiercely.  “But you might find that your tune changes a bit after Heat.  Omega instincts are apparently very powerful things.  I know from the Alpha side that my own can be fairly difficult to resist at times.”
Harry hums.
Sometimes she finds it difficult to be social but as her Coven, we all encourage her to try.
Why should they be the funnel for that process?”
“Me too,” she says.
“It was uncontrolled, but it was powerful.
Remus waits for Harry’s nod, continues, “what you might not realize is that you now have something called scent-memory.
I hope you get the chance to spend more time with her.”
“I’m afraid I have two left feet,” Harry says, embarrassed by the grace that Malfoy shows as he twirls him about.
“I don’t mind, it’s better you know anyway since we all keep track of each other.  My cycle is extremely fast.  I enter season for approximately 12 hours every 10 days.  Pre-season symptoms typically last about 24 hours.”
“But you would consider it?”
I’ve gotten quite good at tailoring charms, as you can imagine.
“For me too!” Harry replied hotly, face flushed a hot red from the embarrassment.  “What the bloody hell was that?  Who asks their brother to kneel?  And why did George just do it?  Like it was nothing? Merlin, Fred.”
Harry feels another rush of Magic go through him, and then sighs in contentment at the loopy, peaceful feeling that goes through him.  Lazily, he smiles up at Hermione who has now gotten much closer to him.  Gently she runs her fingers through his hair before reaching down to guide him up by his elbow and letting him lean on her.
“When I first moved back from America, I was invited to the Courting Ball of the daughter of a family friend.
“It went well enough, I suppose,” she says.
“But we consider them an investment.
He shot a glance at Hermione who met his gaze evenly, clearly conveying to him that she would follow his lead.
Oh. He flushes, beet red down to his neck and Oberon grins, more salaciously this time, the hand on his knee squeezing tightly.
Harry is incoherent already but his body is in pain.  He hadn’t realized that season would hurt like this.  Realized belatedly, he had only thought of it in an abstract, embarrassed sort of way.  But now he realizes he'd do anything to make it stop.  And just as much as he’s in pain, he realizes that he’s also, horribly, unaccountably turned on, and that without his conscious consent, he’s pulled a pillow down to grind against.
“Hey there Alpha,” Dean says, smiling at her from across the room.  “Sent over that chocolate and thank you note as requested.  May need to refill our stocks at this rate.”
“Let’s play that part by ear.’
“How’d he even hear about those?” he wonders.
I’ve never been on a broom.”
There’s a set of constrains that being Omega imposes on us, but you have to remember that Alphas are constrained too.
“Did you notice anything strange when you were with Nott and Malfoy earlier?”
“How generous,” George sneers but Susan just shrugs.
She blows on the ink to dry then rolls it up and pockets it, presumably to give to Hedwig when next they see her.
When I heard about it, I thought it just meant that people couldn’t curse you.”
“Yea, yea,” Ron said, waving if off.  “After Hermione presented, we discussed whether or not she should try to come in as a Sub under Fred…”
“I’m afraid brooms are one of the enchanted objects who’s magic fails in my presence.”
Maybe gain some leverage by getting them to show us the other contenders."
“I take it you want to speak with me,” he says to the blonde, crossing his arms and glowering.
“When you say he appeals to you as an Omega, what do you mean, exactly?
“Nothing a little nap shouldn’t fix.
The boy looks harried in general, dark lines under his eyes, and a strange, frenzied energy about him - at least that’s what Harry thinks from a distance.
Fred is standing in front of the large fire and looks at them all appraisingly as they approach.  The crowd quiets and he begins.
It’s…pleasant, and mildly arousing to dance with Malfoy so close.  They dance one song and then another, Malfoy occasionally seeking out Hermione and Padma, to check in.  Padma’s melodious laughter floats out of the crowd every once in a  while and Malfoy smiles when he hears it.  In their third song, Harry finds he has been more overcome by Malfoy’s proximity than he thought.  Without conscious thought, he finds himself pressing closer to the Slytherin boy, letting slip, a low, keening sound.  Malfoy’s eyes sharpen and he lets out a subvocal rumble which Harry feels reverberate though every part where they are touching.  The sound is both soothing and arousing and he feels his cock take notice as a low shiver rushes through him.
“You have to Bond,” Fred almost whispers.
My Beta, as well as Auror Tonks are waiting on site in case the Portkey should be activated, to escort the students directly back to Hogwarts.
Harry accepts the present, feeling a little shell-shocked.
I’m Omega.
“This is why Covens came about.  Betas aid the Alpha and work in tandem to grow the Coven’s power and prosperity - hoping to attract other strong Omegas or Alphas.  Its the only way they can have families.  And over the course of generations, the Coven system has become particularly robust.”
"Hey, 'Mione," he scoots closer to her, until they're side by side, close enough that they're touching.
But I kind of knew what I was getting myself into when I joined an 8th year-led Coven as a 6th year.
Harry can’t help but think of Neville when he asks, “What about Stricture?
He reaches into his robes with a flourish and proffers a roll of parchment.
Harry attends Susan when she slips into full Season, and the empathy he feels as he watches her pain and desperation as she struggles her way through twelve hours is overwhelming.  He spends the hours alternating between coaxing her into drinking water to offset the massive amount she’s lost through sweat, petting gently up her arms to give her some feeling of solidarity and talking to her softly, even as she keens and moans.  He can tell she loses herself to it at times, and finds himself relieved when she does.  When Olive comes in to help him change the sheets about mid-way through Susan’s cycle, she informs him that while they are all much the same, Susan’s rips through her fast and furious, given the limited time she’s in full season, and that the intensity an Omega feels at any one time can vary based on the length between cycles that Omega’s have and the duration of their full Seasons.
She let go of his hand and fished around in her robes before pulling out a small velvet pouch and handing it to him.
Harry looks up at Remus inquisitively.
George edges around a few of the Other Omegas, Harry trailing him absently and his grin broadens when he lays eyes on Susan Bones, looking healthier than he’s seen her since Presenting.
“This was long before my time.  The point is, when the Aurors questioned the Second, he confirmed that while he and my great-Oma had not yet had sex, they had been discussing a strategy to escape my great-grandfather’s Coven and start a new life.  Together.  My grandmother wanted me to know of this gift, because, while rare, these things do tend to run in families.  She was concerned that I might discover it in myself.  Thankfully, I haven’t.  But she told me something that bares repeating.  She told me that the premonitions always surround an inflection point - a moment of change.  The future they show is a potential, but it could easily become real.”
“Omega’s seasons are different before and after they permanently bond to an Alpha,” George explained at Harry’s confused expression. “The introduction of the bonding hormones to an Omega’s body alters our cycles.  No one really knows why.  Unfortunately, also no patterns to how it will affect any one Omega.”
“You’ll like her, Harry.
“We just need to get through the ceremony and then we can go back to the Tower,” Hermione tells Harry, still clasping him tightly to her side as they move towards the bonfire.
Harry thought she was as relieved as the rest of them to see the two getting along after the chaos of the prior days.
It starts on the 24th.”
How DO you know all this by the way?”
Three days after Harry completes his first Season, Susan enters pre-Season and falls into a full cycle by the following morning, by which time George has fallen into pre-Season himself.  Harry volunteers himself to support Susan during the height when all the Omega’s meet to discuss schedules and they all negotiate times to cover George during his full 3 day cycle.  Olive takes several shifts as well, and while she’s much more polite to Harry than she was at their first meeting, he still can’t say he’s incredibly fond of the 6th year.  She’s got a sharp tongue and a strong opinion on how to do things, while Harry’s always been pretty laid-back.
But Fleur lets go of Bill’s hand to reach across and grab Harry’s instead and the French girl’s eyes are kind when they meet his.
“Will you protect the Coven in turn?”
The gaze is making him uncomfortable.  Unconsciously he shifts his weight from foot to foot,  eyes ripping away from Nott’s face to try and look beyond him.
“But,” she continues, “there are ways to sidestep that.
As soon as she had shared the news that Fred and Bill were both in Fight, he had jolted towards the door, but the French Omega fluidly intercepted him, reaching out a hand to grasp his shoulder and look him in the eyes.
“Do they have big sporting events like this?”
“I dare you to ask her,” Harry responds, edge in his tone.  “I think we’re done here.  Ron?”
And please, Harry, Draco from now on, yeah?”
Voldemort is still alive and kicking in this AU and I've taken a number of liberties with canon events.  Dumbledore is still alive - obviously, as he appeared in chapter 1  - and Draco didn't try to kill him.  Sirius, however, is still dead.  There's a lot of plot around this in the story, so more details will arise. But figured I should at least give you some context for what you're reading.
He looks up at Hermione with wide eyes.  “I didn’t think about it at the time, but that’s really not like me, is it?  Merlin, Malfoy had his wand out, Nott was acting like a jerk, and I didn’t even reach for my own wand.  What was I thinking?”
“Oh,” Harry startles.
The Headmaster has agreed that so long as I cycle outside of Hogwarts and I don’t become pregnant that I can be allowed to finish school.”
One of them is Gareth Greengrass III, as he had embarrasedly introduced himself, looking awkward as he told them to just call him Gaz.
Tries to compose his thoughts cleanly while his body is still trembling in its physiological response.
Fred and George make it out of their respective rooms by late morning, both looking worse for wear and both avoiding the other and the eyes of most of the people in the room.
I’ve been holding on to it for you until after you Presented.”
Harry manages a wavering smile at her.  He nods.  There’s a lot of things he’s not sure about right now, but one thing he is sure of is that he couldn’t have better friends.
He’s just in time to see Remus and Tonk’s sharing a kiss and he slows his approach and looks pointedly away from the two to try to give them as much privacy as possible.
He looks heartbroken by Ron’s words, and now his eyes have locked on to George who has maintained his arms-crossed defensive posture and emitting a non-stop wave of distress pheromones.
Something I know you understand more than most.”
Malfoy smiles.
“Within a few years,” Travers agrees.
None of the three are quite sure what is going on, but they know enough to be weary of any unknown magic.
He’s an Alpha, there’s no denying it, and at first I thought that alone would make me hate him in time…but Bill and I connect on a level that is not just Alpha and Omega and also not just two ordinary people who get along.
, Travers? Explicitly.”
He dropped back out of Fight, passed out, magical exhaustion and that’s when we realized George was passed out too.
“You know why, Harry.  You’re the most famous wizard of our age.  Added to that, your father was a powerful pure-blooded Alpha and your mother was a new-blood Omega who successfully produced a strong magical child and would undoubtedly have produced more if not for her untimely death….”
My ability to perform magic is not affected and anything that I, personally, enchant will stay enchanted.
Fleur and Raphe stayed with him last night and returned to France this morning.
Feeling consternated, he does.
think it’s just magical exhaustion,” Ron explains, face scrunched in concern.
I don’t imagine she was pleased to be at the center of all this tension.”
trying to redirect Oberon’s attention to the story.
“My cousin and uncle were certainly into it.
I had a difficult morning, and I was in a bad mood.
“That’s not for me to say.”
Please, just consider a courtship.
Molly maintains her stern disposition but doesn’t say anything.
Harry swallowed, then nodded determinedly.  “Yes, Alpha.”
“This is linked directly to your trust.  I have the ability to give you an allowance and each month that allowance will deposit directly into this pouch.  I’ll never ask you what you do with that money.  It’s yours, Harry.  I promise. And if you need more, come to me.  I am afraid I have to join you on any trips to the bank, but I won’t ever say no.”
That’s not the problem.
Harry shrugged uncomfortable.  Truth be told, he didn’t really, and he was starting to worry there might be something wrong with him.  He’d had his crushes in his younger years, but he'd grown out of them for the most part, and currently no one was really triggering his interest.
“I’m Oberon Travers and this is my Second Zhang Liqiu.
“Lead on.”
“Why one would think you would be —
Wasn’t worth risking the permanent ire of one of my neighbors.
If anything, it was the opposite.
Harry stiffens reflexively.
Then it is as though I become a sieve - the magic passes straight through me.
You needed a reminder about why it is important to listen to me.”
Arthur gets up quietly, retreating up the stairs, Harry presumes to track down his wife.
“It’s chocolate, graham crackers, and marshmallow,” she informs him.
“Hermione doesn’t want me to suffer, even if she’s angry with me,” Harry says, shrugging.
She had a plan to protect you and to her, it looked like you were just leaping into the fire anyway.”
“Yeah, okay.
I agree with all of that.
The spell I just gave you will break it.
He moodily accepts the cup of tea that Hermione nudges across the table towards him.
Everyone except for the Ministry official stood up and shuffled out of the room.  The man smiled at him, taking a seat where Mrs Weasley had sat.
“Don’t let it happen again,” Harry finally responds, but there’s laughter in his voice and Malfoy smiles.
“I could tell they were both Alpha,” Harry says, picking over his words slowly.  “It made me … nervous and excited at the same time?  When Nott growled at me, it was like I couldn’t move…I didn’t want him to be angry.  I wanted him to be calm.  When Malfoy showed up, I could sense their reactions to each other, and…and I just let Malfoy take the lead.”
Nott ignores her.
Abruptly, Oberon is pulling the group to the side, out of the path of the rest of the crowd and turns sharp eyes on Belle.
I won’t start a relationship with one.
“We’re all making sacrifices,” Harry snaps.
And if either of them piss me off, I can call it off sooner?”
But there do seem to be some things that make it more likely that an Alpha will go into Fight.
I only received a proposal last night.”
“It’s called the Stricture.  It’s ancient magic, passed down from our earliest ancestors.  There’s no Wizard on Earth who can break it and many who have tried.  It basically creates an information barrier between those who have presented, as you just have, and the un-presented, what we refer to as neutrals, mostly children below the age of presentation, muggles, and the rare magical person who lacks a biological secondary gender.  The information barrier does not allow us to even use the terms Alpha, Beta, and Omega in the hearing of a neutral, and it prohibits us from showcasing Coven relationships in their line of sight.  I am sure you have noticed that your friends have been a bit more closed-off to you this year, my boy.  That wasn’t to be cruel, but it is because you are one of the youngest of your year, which means that while everyone else has been negotiating the terms of their Covens, you have been…enjoying the last taste of your childhood.”
“It was magical intention that created secondary genders in Wizards.  Wizards are the only race of being that are consistently capable of channeling and guiding magic, and it is a trait clearly and almost exclusively passed down by blood.  Muggle borns are the obvious exception, of course, but even their existence seems to be guided by Magic’s hand. However, as we all know, magical folk are faced with difficulties reproducing the same way as their non-magical human counterparts and magic reacted to allow a method to continue our survival.
Padma has already rushed out.
“Mrs Weasley has been a great mentor for me,” Hermione continues, “but we don’t agree on everything.  Harry, I made a commitment to you, that I’d give you as much freedom as I possibly could.  I’m your friend first, and I’m not going to control you.  We have to trust each other to keep you safe.”
If we bow down to the first thing they ask of us, especially something this big, they’ll think they have the right to do it every time.”
“Err,” Harry says, “What’s this?”
Ron wavers a second, then nods and heads back up to the house.
Oberon shrugs, “What would be my reward?
The one Chaser - Ditwick, I think? - anyway, he’s got the talent for a trio of Chasers, so the Arrows have the advantage for that position, no question.
“Erm, yes, ok,” Harry looked down and swiftly memorized the address.
Think about it - as soon as they heard you Presented Omega, I guarantee they started weighing candidates to Bond you.
“Maybe? Probably?
“That whole interaction was bonkers, ‘Mione.”
It’s grounding, as are Ron’s slow release of Beta pheromones and with Hermione’s distance, the Alpha scent slowly dissipates and Harry finds himself slowly climbing back into his own mind.
Olive is looking a little guilty.  Harry’s not really interacted with her in the past and he gets the feeling that she’s not normally so sharp.  He thinks he probably would be in a similar mood if not for the potion Hermione had so thoughtful provided during breakfast.  He decides to give her another chance at a first impression after this whole ordeal is over.
Bill let’s out a low noise and squeezes Harry’s shoulder.
“I hate this,” Harry mutters, not able to meet either of their eyes.
Harry shakes his head to try to clear it, sniffling and simultaneously irate at his body for betraying him like this.
A wash of unadulterated Alpha fury washes over him and it’s somehow worse than what he had experienced in the Astronomy Tower.
“Thank you for that, my mother will be well pleased to learn her years of dance lessons have paid dividends.”
You’re too much of a pivotal figure for them to have ignored the opportunity.
“You all know Harry.  He’s been a part of our family for years, even if this is his initiation into the Coven as such.  He’s led us, protected us, fought with us, and yea, sometimes annoyed the bloody hell out of us.”
Looks at Remus seriously, “My mother isn’t the only one who was kind.
No harm came of it in the end, and now we will be better prepared.
Ron whistles low, “Damn mate, that’s bloody awkward isn’t it?”
Harry flushes.
“Happy Christmas.”
okay rather.
Seeing a butter beer vendor coming up he points it out to Harry and gives him a questioning glance.
Fred, looking surprised, grabs up the other vial to examine it.
Ron frowns at him and makes a pointed head gesture, indicating in no uncertain terms that Harry should follow.
Harry crosses his arms.
Hermione frowned.  “I don’t like how worried you are about that,” she said.  “I wish there was something I could do to make you feel better.”
The redhead looked like he was about to break into laughter again but he bravely held them back and nodded at his friend.  They turned back to the entrance to the Tower and headed up to class, a befuddled and embarrassed Ravenclaw left in their wake.
“Sat all four of us down to go over this stuff last summer.
“Protect us how?” Harry said warily, pressing a hand to the side of his head which had started to thrum painfully.
“You need not wait any longer,” Malfoy says.
“Football?”
Ron grinned.  “Yea - that’s easy.  Fred’s got the biggest Coven in the school, as I said.  It’s got a good reputation and an Omega, so it’s on pretty solid ground but Fred’s never been very competitive so it’s a pretty laid back Coven and doesn’t really throw its weight around.  The rest of the 7th year Alphas have pretty small Covens.  Hermione’s got a Coven of six now, including you.  All Betas except for you and her - me, Luna, Dean, and Seamus.  Malfoy has seven - Zabini is a Beta and his Second, Parkinson is a Beta, Crabbe and Goyle, both Betas.  Padma presented Omega and joined Malofy’s Coven and Parvati presented Beta and joined to be with her sister.  Ernie Macmillan has a Coven - his Second is Zacharias Smith, an Alpha Sub, and he’s got Hannah, Susan, Lavendar, and Justin as well.  Hannah, Lavendar, and Justin are Betas, Susan is an Omega.  Terry Boot is an Alpha, Anthony Goldstein is a Beta, his Second.  It’s just the two of them right now, which is unusual.  And Nott is an Alpha but hasn’t joined or started a Coven, which is making everyone very nervous. Bulstrode is a Beta but joined Flint’s Coven. Everyone is a little bit nervous that Malfoy will try to recruit either Terry or Nott as a Sub, which would give him a lot of power, but he doesn’t seem to have made any moves yet, and no one is sure how Zabini would take it.
Susan’s smile dims a little.
Some enchantments drop straight away, others erode over time.
“It lasts about 36 hours, so he’ll be in Season by Sunday evening and then out of it Wednesday night.
Whatever that conversation had been like, it must have included some much needed heart-to-heart.
“—But I wanted to ensure our atonement was worthy of our transgression.”
“Thank you for your honesty, Harry,” Travers says, holding the letter out to him.
“Don’t sell yourself short, mate,” Ron added in quietly.  “You’re a very powerful Wizard. Most Alphas will see you as a catch.”
Harry bristled, “I’m not a child.  I’ll care for myself.”
I wrote down the incantation and wand movement -“ He pauses, pulls out a piece of parchment from the pocket of his robe to hand to Harry.
Harry shivers in the cold and Oberon absently pulls him closer, tucks him into his side, warming him with his body heat.
Unease twists in Harry’s belly even though he can see the rest of his classmates leaning in the longer Miss Burbage speaks.  It was hard to conceive of this sudden vulnerability he had to a fairly large percentage of the Wizarding population as anything resembling a ‘gift’.  He  can’t help but wonder if this would be the same speech if it were given by an Omega.  Something tells him the answer is a rather resounding ‘no’.
Harry recognizes one, however, as Oberon Travers, from the shadowy likeness Shaklebolt had produced at the Order meeting.
“It’s certainly important to get the timing right.”
I’m all packed up.
Harry frowned, suddenly understanding where this is going.
“And what of the personal?” Travers pushes, not looking put off by what Harry has said so far.
“Let me think about that.
“I don’t know.”
“Why not?”
Hermione and Harry laugh.
Fleur comes up the path to the frog pond and pauses when she sees Harry, eyes raking his seated form before she slowly, almost cautiously begins to approach him.
I’m a decade older than you with an established Coven.
Bill instantly relaxes, clearly relieved there is not some other threat making Harry so distressed.
“It was fun spending the day with you.
Harry must look confused because Ron rolls his eyes.
“No,” George is unequivocal.
Here you go!  Thanks everyone for your response on this.  Let's get into a little bit of world-building....
Harry trails fingers reverently over the blanket.
No surprise - Bill is bigger, stronger.
Oberon smiles in response, eyes flitting back to candidly assesss him.
Hermione rushed on. “It’s okay Harry, really.   Omega’s aren’t allowed to directly inherit, instead everything goes into a trust.  Whoever the Omega pledges to as Alpha has access to the inheritance, but the intention is that it be held as a dowry for whoever you eventually decide to bond with.”
Harry smiled at them.  “I’m happy for you, really.  Just do me a favor and keep your PDA to a minimum, yeah?”
It’s not a tone Harry is accustomed to hearing from his former foe and it draws him up short, washing away at least a portion of his irritation.
Remus grins.
We’re all allies in this war.
Harry reaches out, squeezes her hand.
Ron shudders.
But Bill’s got the edge on Fred, physically and once Fred processed that, he shifted to magic.
Harry casts a glance at Hermione who nods encouragingly and turns to lead them out of the Headmaster’s office.
Susan darted her head back around to look at him with a startled gaze.  “Oh Harry, no, of course not.  And I never will.  Zacharias is my Coven’s Second, and he hasn’t actually done anything yet for which I can accuse or confront him.  It wouldn’t be fair.  And I swear to you, I will never tell anyone of your gift of my own free will.  You must keep it secret.  If any Alphas find out….it’s a very valuable gift, Harry.  It will make you an even more desirable prospect than you already are.  Imagine, that any one with you during a season could see a glimpse of the future…well.”
- the street name of this Potion - it’s a good gift, actually.
He had thought it would be many years in the future, but with the right partner….well, he wasn’t completely opposed to the idea.
He stepped forward proffering his hand.
Ron shakes his head, sighs.
He remembers suddenly how much he’s always liked the French girl, how her kindness had shown through even when they were competitors.
But when we got down there, Bill was already in Fight.
Harry laughs and the tension dissipates.
Leo shrugs.
Belle looks at him with her serious dark eyes.
She worried for me with the transformation.
Not sure whether to scowl or laugh, Harry decides his best bet is to just ignore the whole thing altogether and he turns his attention to the game.
The Beta girl had knocked on the door early the following morning and Harry, who had had very little sleep, allowed himself to be cajoled into going down for breakfast and leaving the Omega-sitting to her.
Ron shrugs, “I don’t know all of it. I wasn’t there.
“If we have to,” Padma agrees, voice sullen.
“What? Why?”  Harry asked, scrunching his eyes in concern.
“Fred is right,” Molly’s voice comes from the entrance to the kitchen.
“Then why hasn’t he responded to the Contract?
To his credit, Malfoy drops the veneer of irritation and has the decency to at least look uncomfortable.
“It doesn’t matter,” George responds just as tersely.
“Pretty sure that’s up to Harry,” Ron says, raising a brow at Harry in question.
It had missed, but Hermione’s startled and impulsive smack to Ron’s face had left Harry wincing in sympathy and Ron stumbling over his own apology.
Harry’s face goes bright red at his friend’s expression and he holds up his hands in a classic expression of faux innocence.
Harry crosses his arms and glares but Ron just smirks at him.
His other hand goes back to tangle with Fleur’s.
“What’s that muggle dessert they do?
I learned a lot from her out there, but I mostly liked to lay out in the sun while she would prune or shear and listen to her stories.”
At least Harry’s not alone.
He takes a few moments to think as they keep up their walk.
George, well my sense for this stuff isn’t as good as yours is mate, but I could tell he was
“I’ll start researching,” Hermione agrees.
At first, he won’t use it, wouldn’t be acceptable in a new courtship.
“I was lucky,” Oberon says wistfully, words running counter to Harry’s musings.
Some of this story is going to be a bit dark...
How are you feeling?
It’s when the owl post comes in that everything takes a downward spiral.
George, looking unbearably grateful at his younger brother’s intervention, subsides, crossing his arms again, this time in a defensive posture.
As he re-acquainted himself with the magical world in this new context, he played it smart.  He didn’t go places alone.  It wasn’t hard to avoid solitariness - there always seemed to be a member of the Coven nearby.  Harry wasn’t sure if Hermione had ordered it or if they were just organically looking out for him, but either way he appreciated it.  It meant he didn’t have to feel like a child asking for an escort every time he left the Common Room.
A soft gasp from the questioning Hufflepuff girl whose hand stutters to her mouth.  Harry feels a wave of sympathy wash over him in response.  She clearly hadn’t heard anything about this.  He’s grateful again for Hermione, for that academic brain and the way she had detailed out the most important facts that he needed to know so that he didn’t have to find out that kind of secret so unexpectedly.
“Passcode activated, of course.
Blushing, Harry reaches out to accept it, fingers brushing against Travers’ in the handoff.
Ron returns after a bit of time - longer than it would take for a round-trip to the pantry - but neither of his friends questions him.
Hermione’s hand stills from her plucking.  Everything in the Alpha seems to go taut.  “Harry,” she says, her voice a soft warning.
We're in agreement there.
Neither could I for that matter - she was my whole world.”
It’s so much more than I could have hoped for when I first Presented.”
Hmmm…she was fascinated by muggles.
Travers seems…real, now.”
Like the time that Hermione had gripped it to explain what it was, Harry feels his body sink into a bit of a haze, his limbs no longer obeying his direction.
“Excuse me?”
“You know Hermione,” Fleur shrugs.
They’re all quiet after that, for a while.  Harry tries to do some work but his brain won’t focus and the potion wears off after a while, so much he can’t really stand still.  He takes to pacing and that irritates Olive, who eventually loses patience entirely and absconds to one of the adjoining suites.  George sighs at that but lets her be, occasionally knocking gently on the door and stepping in to check on her, but otherwise distracting Harry with small stores and one unfocused game of Exploding Snap before Harry is suddenly sobbing and George quirks an eyebrow up in surprise.
“Quick tempered, overprotective Alpha? Remind you of anyone?”
Whoever kicks the most balls in, wins.”
“First, everyone is on their best behavior.  The last thing we need is to be squabbling amongst ourselves or getting into it with any other Coven in such a public setting.  If anyone says anything to offend you, bring it to me before you react and we’ll decide what to do together.   We’ll pair up.  Harry, you’re with me for the night.  As Alpha and Omega we’ll have some additional responsibilities the night of the Ball in meeting with the other Alphas of the Hogwarts Covens and no one will be impressed if I’m perceived to let you wander around without my protection with so many Alphas in attendance.”
“Was everything okay, Harry,” Hermione asked briskly, eyeing him up and down as though Vincent might have touched him.  It felt strangely possessive.
“At his Alpha’s own pace, brother.  You know that.”  Fred let a hand trail down to his brother’s head and ran it gently through his hair.  “You’ve irritated Angelina.  Apologize to her and return to your essay. We will discuss this further later, at the Coven meeting.”
Harry was focused on something else at this point though.  “Is that common?” he asked, and spared a moment to think he probably could have asked that a little less gruffly in the wake of such a revelation.  Burbage turned her attention to him without looking too ruffled by his tone though and shrugged in response.
Hermione nods and Harry grins.
“Tha’ wa’ nice,” Harry slurs, drunk on the power that had run through him momentarily.  Hermione nods kindly, and gestures Ron to gather the rest of the Coven before she leads him, swaying unsteadily, back inside.
“Good, that’s good Omega.
George puts his head in to the room Olive disappeared into earlier and has a short conversation with her before he comes out and scoops up Harry’s discarded robe and tie and hustles him into one of the other suites.  Patiently he helps Harry undress further, not even blushing when the younger boy goes full nude, moaning in discomfort.
Hermione pauses, considering.  She glances at Harry and must note his excitement because she smiles slightly and nods to Malfoy.  “Please, Alpha Malfoy, lead the way.”
“It’s an inborn instinct, Harry.  Omegas are coveted in the Wizarding World.  Because they can bare magical children, Covens lure them for bonding and sometimes surrogacy.  But Omegas are also magically strong, at least as strong as Alphas.  They have other gifts that they give Covens - many have unique Omegan gifts, such as prophecy or are irregularly attuned to the natural world. And they are fierce protectors - particularly of their offspring. No one is entirely sure why such a strong dynamic also grew to develop such weakness to Alphas, but here we are.  Some suppose it was a biological response to force Omegas to stay within the Coven and adhere to the Alpha so they don’t tear families apart after birthing offspring. Others tell a story of an infertile but magically gifted Beta who was so jealous of Omegas that they cursed them to eternal obedience to the Coven.  But no one really knows for sure and Stricture makes it even harder to research.”
Ron pointedly takes a few steps back towards the Greenhouse, examining some of the curious plants on display, conspicuously present, but just out of earshot as Harry makes the reluctant approach to where Malfoy is waiting.
“It is the purview of each Coven to decide.  Some Covens have strict pair bonding arrangements even for the purpose of reproduction, even if there are better alternatives.  But many Covens have agreements between members that allow for such surrogacy or even multiple Bondings, though such an act does tend to mitigate each Alpha’s hold on the Omega.”
I can’t tell you more about it right now, but during our courtship, I promise, I will give you the full story.
A year is plenty of time to get the measure of someone.”
I would have Bonded with Bill for that alone, but he surprised me.
“Why piss off the Ministry and the Order all in one fell swoop?” Harry says.
Hermione looks frustrated.
“Well, the castle is pretty interesting,” Harry says.
Still, for now, Harry chose to be hopeful and enjoy the tentative peace.
Harry wasn’t sure exactly what ‘compromise’ the two had come to that day after Christmas.
He takes it from the blonde, holding it loosely in his fingers and keeps a steady gaze on the Slytherin.
Harry smiles up at him.
“Yes, my dear,” Burbage responded softly, smiling gently.
Biologically, they will release pheromones that will make you feel more stable.”
I’m ready to consider starting my family.
What do you think is better - to always suspect that there’s something more out there or to find out the truth but never understand the whole picture?”
grants an Omega temporary immunity from the effects of Alpha voice and scent.
The Deputy Headmistress turns on her heel to do so, ignoring the incredulous looks of her students.
Ginny pushes the door closed and they all let out a sigh of relief.
“Everyone’s a little different.  Padma only has 3 a year but I don’t envy her because they last almost 9 days.  Mine comes about once every other month and I’m done in 3 days.”
“You’re both still complete arses and I don’t want to be around either of you.
Fred even reaches out to pat the third hand in a conciliatory manner.
That’s when an Omega’s senses are at their strongest.
Forced himself to take a few breaths to think out how he should respond, what kind of response a mature friend should make to an earnest apology like that.
“The most important thing for you all to know is perhaps what could be the hardest for you to digest.  It concerns the nature of magic itself.”
“Speaking from personal experience, then?” He asks and bites off a grin when Oberon ducks his head abashedly.
Far beyond what you’d ever experienced before?”
Cards on the table if you please, Omega Potter.”
“I have layers.”
Instead she just watches the French man quickly veer towards her brother and his fiance and continues on with the point she was making.
“Why don’t you just get on with it,” Fred cuts in.
Mum rushed over to Bill, Dad too, he came down sometime when they were fighting and Dad Flooed them both to Mungo’s.
The woman has always been an open book with her emotions so its strange to see her putting on an affected mood of forced cheer.
I’ve got a year right?
“They didn’t manage to infect you with their interest?”
“Harry!” Hermione exclaims.
Fleur shoots him a look, eyebrow raised, but nods once and continues.
“I’m pretty sure you know my background.”
Hermione calls the Coven together at least twice a week to hang out or discuss things that affected the group, so there was no great mystery when she asked them all together the Saturday morning the week before he was to go out with Malfoy.
The tears are back.
Harry, Hermione, and Ron are summoned to the Headmaster’s office immediately after breakfast - the request delivered by an overly energetic Dobby, who pops up to pour tea for a bleary Harry, still half-asleep and to announce the request.
“Harry needs to finish his Potions essay,” he tells Travers curtly, reaching out to physically pull Harry away from the Alpha.
A little shell-shocked, Harry glanced around at the rest of the awkwardly standing group before turning abruptly on his heel and walking briskly to meet Ron who was loitering at the corner of the hall, waiting to escort him to dinner.
But there’s the personal reason too.
It’s phrased as a suggestion, but there’s an edge to Malfoy’s voice so Harry nods.  “Yea, I think I will.  See you.”
The Coven discarded the charms over their clothing and Hermione smiled approvingly.  “You all look great.  Let’s do as discussed.  Mingle with the other Covens for now, we’ll meet up again before the Ceremony.”
Harry left flank is brushed right up against Bill’s right and he sighs contentedly at the warmth that is emmanating from the larger man.
“Harry,” Hermione says softly.  “You should know that Mrs. Weasley had a similar conversation with me about you.”
Ron’s looking a little embarrassed at the topic, but he gives his friend a half smile.  “Well whatever it ends up being, you know me and ‘Mione are here for you.”
You can say no, of course, but it might make you feel better.”
“She won’t mind.
One of the most appealing things about Presenting Omega, once he had gotten over the general weirdness of the notion, was the idea that he could carry his own children.
For his part, Draco appears amused.
“Betas can’t reliably reproduce magical offspring with each other.”
“My parents are pretty liberal for a Wizarding family,” Ron tacks on, “but in spite of, or rather because of, how much they love you and George, they’ll want us to play a more traditional role than we would have otherwise.”
“I will.”
How was the Bonding?”
He hands Harry his drink and Harry grips it with both hands, savoring the warmth.
Ron just nods and fighting back a yawn, says, “I’ll walk you down.
She looks at him apologetically at that but he just shrugs.  He’s not keen on the idea of being publicly babysat in such a way, but he’s not oblivious to the ways of the Wizarding World and his lessons with Burbage are giving him more and more insight every day into the limitations imposed by his Presentation.
Hermione shrugged, looking sad.  “I agree its awful Harry.  In the views of the lawmakers, these restrictions are actually in place to protect Omegas.”
"I'm glad you don't scent un-Settled anymore.
Opposite him, Fred looks just as intent, racing to tap a pair just ahead of his twin.

The sudden thought disrupts the pleasantness of his current interaction and he lets out a low, aggrieved whine.
“Ever since my first moment on a broom….there’s such an intense feeling of freedom.”
“Fledges?” Harry asked.
Hope y'all enjoyed.  See you next time!
“Ah,” Harry says, belatedly understanding what Hermione has already figured out.  Ron’s face twists a little bit but he nods next to Hermione.  “I’ll ask George to escort you.”
She stands much shorter than her Alpha compatriot, perhaps 5 foot 3.
“Leo’s great,” Ron enthuses.
“I shouldn’t have threatened you with that.
“And this….this empty, hollowed out feeling?

Harry and Hermione meandered into the crowd and it quickly became apparent Hermione had a specific goal, as she expertly navigated them to where Fred and George were standing, speaking with some of the other 8th years.  Fred held up a hand when he saw her approach and George immediately fell silent.
“Nott’s up to something,” Ron says, voice sure.
“I’m not going to court an Alpha.
“Unfortunately so.”

Fleur has settled next to him on the couch and while they no longer hold hands, she has left a proprietary hand gripping his thigh.
There was a ripple in the room - everyone felt it - the effects of old magic and then there was calm.  Silence for a moment, then Hermione’s hand dropped to the top of Harry’s head, stroking his hair for a moment.  He felt himself make a low sound - a noise of approval and theres was an answering rumble from the Alpha before him before Ron was reaching a hand down, Harry was using it to pull himself up and the Golden Trio were all staring at each other with varying degrees of red cheeks and grinning faces.
“What about you then, Harry?  Got anyone in your sights?”  It was a Saturday and they all had free time until the evening when Ron and Harry had Quidditch practice, so the trio had wandered down to hang out by the lake after running into each other in the hallway.
