«Too late,» said Draco. He started walking towards the door with a smirk on his face but he stopped when he remembered something.
«You are not! We're not stupid, mate. It looked like you saw a ghost! It wasn't even close to us that bloody Dementor!» Blaise had both hands on the blond's shoulders and was looking at him straight in the eyes.
He usually felt the cold air on his skin, even during the summer, and he woke up shivering. During his third year, when he spent the nights with Remus, he often woke up with a cloak on top of him and his teacher’s soft smile looking at him. Despite that, he was still cold to the bone.
«You were so cute!» added a high pitched voice from behind Draco. Sirius was back in human form and he was holding his cheeks, making his face all the more annoying.
«Now, what do you want? I’m busy» by “busy” he meant he had to sleep until it was time for him to head to the Shrieking Shack.
The day he woke up with a bandaged leg and his mother crying beside him, he noticed his father had changed.
Halfway through Remus' transition, he felt it; the sound of a bone crashing. That time, though, it didn't come from the other man.
«That's not the only reason he hates me, but yes, he doesn't like werewolves» laughed awkwardly Remus.
He didn't dare move, only showing his back to his worried friends. He was trembling and his face lost all its original colour - not that it was much, he was pale to begin with.
«Nothing happened» lied Draco. He had clear orders from his father that nobody must know what happened. Not even a single professor.
Draco crawled to the man and started to shake him, hoping he would open his eyes and tell him it was going to be ok.
When she opened the door all people inside the office turned their heads towards the Slytherin trio.
Emerald eyes were staring right into his and near them, another pair of chocolate brown eyes were looking in his direction.
«I slept in…?» he whispered to himself, incredulous. He heard some shuffling behind him and turned to see Ron belly down sprawled on his bed, legs and arms spread apart and dandling out. He was clearly too tall to sleep there.
«Every book I read describes the transformation as the worst kind of pain in the world,» said Draco, sobbing. «And the first full moon is the worst of them all! I won't survive!»
In the mid-afternoon, the Slytherin was in the library doing his Transfiguration homework when a first-year Hufflepuff came up to him.
«Malfoy, you can't drop out just like that! Where should we find a Seeker now? What would your father say?» asked Marcus Flint while following Draco. They were walking in a corridor that conduced to Classroom 1B, on the ground floor.
What he expected less, was staring at grey eyes - at first sight, they could be mistaken for light blue, but he's been staring at them too long to not see they were the same colour of a storm -, full of so much bloodlust that he couldn't stop shaking.
After the tests - Potter and Granger wouldn't stop staring at him with wide eyes, it was unnerving - Madam Pomfrey told him to eat some chocolate and left him free to go.
«It’s from a certain Dominique Duval,» said Tonks, reading from the back of a letter sealed with blue wax.
That was when Draco understood. They thought he was weak, that he couldn’t survive a full moon without their help. They wanted to be the
«I have to say, Harry, green suits you well,» said Hermione Granger, her silver hair reflecting the light in the room.
“But seriously, if Malfoy ever did anything to you, let me know, all right? He's not exactly one to play fair.”
“The prick is probably unnerved that another Potter's going to start working at the Ministry. If he makes any threats to you, tell me immediately, you understand?”
Thus, it was the understatement of the century to say that Harry was only surprised, when one day after lunch he and Ron opened their joined office to find himself staring in the face of Draco Malfoy of all people. Even if said Draco Malfoy was accompanied by one Head of Auror Kingsley Shacklebolt, who seemed to be all too nonchalant about the presence of an ex-Death Eater in their mix. Kingsley, once spotted the men, went out to introduce the newest face of the Forensic Department, resolutely ignoring the deadly glares the ex-Gryffindors were aiming at the blond. All the while, Malfoy kept quiet and stood partially hidden behind Kingsley, flipping through a stack of paper like he was bored. As if it was no big deal.
They all walked into the kitchen and noticed everyone was awake and having breakfast. At the end of the table, a light brown owl was sitting next to some letters.
«Is that what the scent does? It tells you if a werewolf is near?» asked Draco, sitting on the front desk.
Reluctantly, he opened his eyes, but his view was clouded by black fur. From it came a familiar smell, like cigarettes and sugar, and luckily for Draco, he didn’t feel the wet dog scent that usually clouded the original smell.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore tried to suppress his laugher. He was happy someone made the students laugh even with Dementors around the school.
The other wolf had brown fur and milk chocolate eyes. He looked sleepy but was observing the smaller one.
«Aww, you still write to each other!» exclaimed Granger. She was feeding Regulus, who sat in a crib next to her, with one hand and holding the Daily Prophet with the other. Draco didn’t know how she could manage that.
I'm sorry for the long waiting! At first, I was just busy with school, but then I found out I couldn't write a single word because of my damn writer's block. I'll try to write more often.
He locked the door behind him and sat on his bed, holding the letter on his lap. He carefully opened it without destroying the seal and freed the actual letter.
«You’re a wizard, use your brain,» he said while looking through their wardrobe. The clothes in there either were too small, Potter’s, or too big, Weasley’s. He took out a bricky sweatshirt that almost reached his knee.
He had felt it every time he entered the Great Hall to eat. It wasn't unpleasant, but it was unnerving how he couldn't find anything about it.
Remus tried to get the younger's mind off the pain of the transformation, so he talked about his Hogwarts days as a student.
With Remus on his back, Draco walked to Madam Pomfrey. He knew his body wasn't strong enough, and he was about to pass out, but he couldn't leave Remus.
«Yeah, and that’s why all your clothes are so small. They’re goblin sized» he said in fake annoyance. Draco loved getting Potter all riled up.
«If you don't mind» started the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher «I would like you to go against the boggart we just saw. Just for a curiosity of mine, don't worry»
«No no no please...» muttered the boy, looking at the injury. He went to where they usually put their clothes and took Remus' robes, using them to dab the injury.
«You can go to the Great Hall,» said Pansy, referring to Vincent and Gregory. «Blaise and I will take this bloody git to Madam Pomfrey» she took Draco's arm and started walking towards the direction she heard was the school healer, followed closely behind by the dark-skinned boy.
Draco widened his eyes. He always woke up just after his transformation and there was no way the sun rose that late.
I'm sorry for the long waiting! School is really getting stressful right now so I don't know how much I'll write. As soon as school ends I'll start writing like before!
«I felt bad waking you up. You looked so comfortable, all snuggled up on Padfoot» said Remus, chuckling.
«Your Gryffindor friends found out about your secret in second year? Great, mine will know by next month»
«Don't lie to me, Malfoy. We all know well what a Dementor does to its victim. They force them to relive their worst memories over and over again» her stern look made it known that she would accept only the truth.
«Letting you two shag in peace, what else? I need another shirt anyway» the blond said smirking. Remus went beat red while Sirius grinned wide. Moony rolled his eyes, probably to distract himself from the embarrassment, and threw at him the destroyed shirt. It was a bad throw, but Draco caught it easily thanks to his seeker reflexes that didn’t leave him after he left Quidditch, even if his bones still hurt.
Before he knew it time passed and it was June. Nobody smiled on the train, everyone still had imprinted in mind what happened not too long before. Cedric Diggory died.
«Do you mean, by chance, ‘Let's visit Pottah?’» said Pansy, mimicking Draco's voice at the end. He hated to admit it, but her imitation sounded just like his voice.
Obviously, the Slytherin boy avoided them as much as he could, not interested in even looking at them after the events of the year before. One time, to Draco’s immense surprise, Weasley even tried to apologize to him for what he said in the Shrieking Shack. The blond almost forgave him, but he didn’t. The redhead thought people like him were monsters, and a simple sorry wouldn’t change that.
Looking at the mirror, he noticed his hair were worse than Potter's and his face looked like he hasn't slept in a month - strange, considering he slept better now than before the potion.
«What will you do after every full moon? You'll need medical attention! And Professor Snape could make you Wolfsbane potion, so you can keep your right mind during the night» how could Lucius let his son live like that?
Draco wasn't gonna lie, he was hoping for it to happen. He knew the smell was a werewolf thing, and if he didn't find out what it meant he would've gone mad.
That was a small room, so it shouldn't take long to arrive to safety, but Greyback jumped on the wall to reach him faster.
«As if,» the blond said, before walking out the door. Just to embarrass Remus’ poor heart further, he decided to yell behind him «Use protection!»
«What do you want to be called then, Potter? Shorty? Ant? Little one? Pipsqueak? I can make a whole list» Draco leaned forward with his arms crossed, but not enough to go into Potter’s personal space. The dark-haired boy rolled his eyes.
When students and teachers started to get ready to go to their respective classes, something nobody expected happened.
«Draco? What's happening?» asked Blaise. He had never seen his friend like this. Sure, they weren't Gryffindors, but they didn't get scared so easily. It was out of character of the Malfoy.
Draco tried to be mentally ready for what he would see, but when grey orbs stared at him with the same bloodlust he saw every time he closed his eyes, he realized he could never be prepared for that.
«Oh, right,» he said. The night before he forgot to take off his clothes before transforming and he did it last minute. Luckily he was smart enough to take his pants off first.
Draco shoved Blaise off him and ran towards the Great Hall, leaving his friends in the empty - or so they thought - corridor, looking at each other worryingly.
Walking down the stairs, he managed to examine the shirt farther. It had a strong scent, probably because he still had the remains of his monthly advanced senses.
«Something good happened?» asked Draco with a smirk. Sirius barked out a laugh and warped one arm around Draco’s shoulders.
«What are you doing awake this early?» asked Draco. Potter didn’t reply right away and it took a while for Draco to understand the reason. The Golden Boy was looking at his bare, scarred chest with a look Draco couldn’t make out.
There was another problem, too. Draco was skinny, too skinny. He missed the times when he was the perfect weight and he didn’t have to worry about gaining too much, since he had Quidditch training two times a week. Now, he hated how much his ribs were sticking out or how slim his arms were. He did gain some weight since he arrived at Grimmauld Place, but it wasn’t enough.
«Let me finish before you insult me with your lack of taste,» said Sirius, lightly hitting Draco’s cheek. Draco rolled his eyes. «I’ve just been told that you already know about it and that you even pranked people with it»
Of course, nobody saw what actually happened, so everyone thought that the Slytherin insulted the beast and deserved the long gash he now had on his right arm.
On the day of the full moon, after herbology; a class he didn’t have with his friends Blaise and Pansy; he had been surrounded by the Golden Trio. He would have gladly walked away if it wasn’t for Potter and Weasley, who grabbed his arm and dragged him away from the greenhouse. He tried to struggle away but his whole body ached and he was tired.
«Where did you find this, a dumpster?» said Draco once Potter handed it to him. Harry rolled his eyes.
«My father knows perfectly well my reasons. Now, if you'll excuse me, I don't want to be late for Transfiguration. If you talk about this one more time I'll make sure you won't see a Nimbus 2001 or a better broom in your whole life» replied Draco with venom.
Remus was really happy when he told him. They have been writing letters to each other since they parted ways the year before and Remus knew everything that happened to Draco.
Time passed and Christmas break finally arrived. Everyone was nervous about asking someone out for the Yule Ball, but not Draco.
On the first day of September Draco Malfoy was in a compartment on the Hogwarts Express with his friends Pansy Parkinson, Blaise Zabini, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle.
She couldn't. Gryffindors went around all day with the colours of the Slytherin house on their head.
«My mom's new boyfriend seems cool. He treats her right and he's good at Quidditch. I hope this one will last more than six months» said Blaise the moment Draco started to listen again to the conversation going on around him.
Looking at the ceiling he realized he was in the Shrieking Shack and he remembered that the night before was the full moon.
«I hate you» then he walked as fast as he could - without making it look like he was running away from them - towards the Great Hall.
«Come on, Minnie, why should I prank my own house?» she gazed suspiciously at him, then rose from her seat and walked towards her classroom.
«Well, I’m not the one famous because of it» he poked him hard in the middle of his forehead, careful to avoid the scar. Potter instantly went to rub the spot.
Granger and Potter looked at them surprised, Professor McGonagall had her usual stern look and Madam Pomfrey looked like she already knew the reason they were there.
Tonks, Mr and Mrs Weasley greeted him and asked him questions about the full moon, wanting to know if everything was okay. He answered all the questions he could before inhaling his breakfast. Mrs Wealsey, seeing his hunger, happily made him more food. He didn’t know how much time passed, but when he walked into the corridor to reach the living room he met a rather happy looking Sirius.
He scanned all the heads in the room until he saw platinum blond hair. He stared at those grey eyes a moment too long, before looking away. He expected a haunted look, but only found weariness.
Draco gave his parents a confused and scared look but they didn’t even glance his way. The corridors were darker than he remembered them and the house was noisier.
The toothbrush was on arm’s length so he gave a strong kick - for what he could do in that predicament - in the wolf's face, which was still attached to his leg.
«You should get some sleep before dinner, you'll need as much energy as you can» Draco nodded and rose from his seat.
«How did you lose the other one?» asked Blaise, his eyes showing that he was finding it funny. How can someone lose a
During the summer, the sunrise arrived around six a.m., it was unlikely that everyone else was awake.
The best part, in Draco's opinion, was when Remus told him about the different pranks they did. They were simply amazing.
«I'm afraid I can't tell you that yet» replied the man, smiling. After a groan in annoyance from Draco, he continued.
«Oh no, Madam. I'm fine, I don't need anything. It's just my friend over here, she worries over nothing» said Draco, forcing a smile and slapping Pansy on the arm, making her hiss at him.
Draco tried to keep his mind off the topic, thinking of when Dominique promised to write to him. Maybe he could be happy with the French boy, even if he was a werewolf. Maybe, if they could stay together for years, he could even reveal about his lycanthropy. When he started to think way too ahead of time, he tried to focus on something else.
The blonde was reading a potion book - or what seemed a potion book, while in reality the boy disguised the cover and was reading a book about werewolves - while the others were talking about their summers.
What his parents would not be aware of for sometime was that the ritual had been altered with them being none the wiser. The stipulation that limited the degree of exchange was purposely left out, thus the link between Draco and Harry Potter was a full-forced soul bond. By the time they knew of the Prophecy, the purpose for this presumed mishap had become clear. Harry Potter, destined to fight the Dark Lord to his death, would have his life saved in exchange for their own son.
The only consoling thought was that Harry was still allowed to see his grandsons. Harry felt like someone had stabbed him when he finally knew of the baby boy's birth and rushed to the hospital just to find out that Diane was about to be checked out. But still, James had allowed him to hold the new baby, albeit grudgingly. They saw each other at Christmas brunch every year at The Burrow. Each time Albus complained loudly that he no longer saw his granddad around any more, James would turn away, face hardened, and Harry would feel like dying a little more.
, and with Draco’s mind fixated on Greg and Vincent and not on keeping up his Slytherin reputation, he was no longer in the midst of interhouse conflicts and thus had barely been in close proximity to Potter. If his mind was not so occupied, he might have seen the suspicion in Potter’s eyes and taken some sort of precaution. In his defence though, he was not prepared to be cornered in Myrtle’s bathroom and cursed within an inch of his life. He was only trying to coax Myrtle into spying on Greg and Vincent for him with a bit of crocodile’s tears that had always worked so well on Pansy. Potter, who barged in midway through his dramatic sobbing, must have thought that it was Draco who was plotting the demise of Hogwarts and started to throw accusations and curses at him.
But of course, Father’s voice was a one-way affair and his was a one-man’s secret, and so sometimes when he spotted Potter and co sneering at him from the other side of the Hall, he could not help but feel inexplicably lonely.
Not answering, the Auror paused in front of a room, opened the room and gestured inside. All the three adults gasped at a lone naked figure lying on a metal table, covered from the chest down with a white sheet. The bony shoulders and thin neck, as well as the sides of a pale face were soiled with blood clots and bruise. The blond hair was matted with blood and the room was utterly quiet.
“Regardless of what you claim to believe, it does not mean any of us should forgive him for all his wrongdoing, you know that.”
Somehow it slipped both of their minds to inform their families about the inheritance. Unsurprisingly, both were subjected to Howlers first thing in the morning from their respective families on the day the announcement was made on the
“Right, and where in the world would we find a man who is willing to have a baby with me yet will never talk about it?”
“Because you were dead set on not conceiving a child through sex. Male pregnancy cannot be brought about by artificial insemination, Harry.”
Malfoys have always been patrons of the arts. Father was partial to the intricacies of porcelains and enamel of both Eastern and European origins, having recently added the Royal Danish Faberge to the family private collection, while mother adored paintings of Greek and Arthurian myths, like those of Rubens and Waterhouse. Losing themselves in the sophisticated details of a miniaturised sculpture, or elaborate engravings, or precise paint strokes was their way of escaping reality. From a young age, Draco had been encouraged to appreciate the classic arts.
But then, he worked his way through the five stages of self-grief and mellowed out. In the end, after years of Anger and Denial, Acceptance stayed. What was the point of being mad, really? It was actually quite reassuring, in a rather macabre way, knowing the expiry date of your life, while others traversed the Earth not knowing when or why their life would perish, Draco knew exactly how his would. Might as well live it how he would like to. Why wallow in self-pity when you could be enjoying whatever time you had left? Life was short enough as it was, he thought.
Later, when Ron and Hermione had come by and listened to the entire story, Ron patted on Harry's shoulder sympathetically. “Such an irony, mate, after all that hatred between the two of you over the years, it was Malfoy that ended up saving your grandson's life. Guess the ferret did have a heart too.”
When the healer came into the room with the test result in his hand, his face unreadable, they could not help but hold their breath.
, Harry agreed with a smile. His fingers traced the hawthorn wand hidden in the crevice of the couch.
“I caught him staring at me no less than five times today. Rather unsubtle, too. Like he wants something from me.”
Then she told him all she knew about Malfoy's secret-crush-since-something-like-5th-year. How she had caught Malfoy staring at him at too many an occasion to be accidental. How she had it almost confirmed when she accidentally overheard a chat between Parkinson and Bulstrode at Madame Malkin's. How she had casually and nonchalantly pulled it out from tea with her new friend Greengrass that Malfoy's surprisingly restricted sex life seemed to only involved one-night stands whose appearance was suspiciously like Harry, not that Daphne had any comment on that. How she saw it for herself at their latest lunch when Malfoy practically slaughtered her as she intentionally flirted with Harry, if only looks could kill or he had been more gifted in wordless magic.
Taking it as permission, Harry bolted out of the room, barely looking back at the blond. The baby stopped crying almost immediately and he resumed staring at his father in quiet amazement. The man looked down at him, still smiling while lovingly tracing the soft frame of his round face with a thumb. The child's tiny fingers wriggled out from under their cover and took hold at his father's ring finger, gripping at the warm metal ring coiling around it. Both of them could hear the muffled voice of the brunette on the other side of the door, the words unclear, though Malfoy suspected he already knew who called. Suddenly, he gripped the boy in his arms tightly, making the child frowned, yet he remained quiet. Green eyes still stared at silver ones, the silver eyes that were filled with indescribable grief and fear. The boy felt his father lifting him up to his chest and his cheek crushed at a bony shoulder, his tiny body shaking with trembles from the body underneath him and his fingers never letting go of his father's ring.
"...Fine. I'd better make an appointment with the Healer now, before I regret agreeing to this clusterfuck."
“Were you ever going to let me know that I had another parent? Or that Albus had another grandfather?”
A week later, Harry was unsurprised, but still disturbed, when he saw that the blond hair had remained. No matter what kind of spells he used, James said, he could not get back his original brown colour, unless he considered dyeing. Somewhere in the background Diane chirped in, saying she loved the new blond head, thus James was content with keeping it this way. When Albus pointed out that his daddy looked like the man that saved him, everyone was even a bit mournful.
as she poured herself coffee. Ginny seemed to have forgotten about her demise altogether. Harry did not, but he himself was at a loss as to what to say and tried to push the depressing thoughts to the back of his skull, following Ginny's cues instead. It was fine until one night when he woke up to Ginny silently crying in an empty room, originally intended to be a nursery when they first renovated Godric's Hollow. The moment he saw her rolling tears as she sat motionlessly on the floor, it hit him again that nothing was all right, that nothing could change the fact that Ginny was sick and dying and condemned to childlessness. Again, as he drew his wife to his chest and rocked her slowly to slumber, he felt hopelessness washed over him, pulling the two of them down a bottomless dark sea.
Despite all the hoohas about their soul bond, in reality it was much less dramatic than it sounded. The bond did not really affect his life in general, if one just ignored the Sword of Damocles hanging over his head.
In the end, before Ginny could coach him on how to react in such cases, Harry was the one who accidentally blurted out the question one day post-coital. For one long moment, Malfoy did not say anything and Harry convinced himself that Malfoy had already fallen asleep. At midnight when Harry stepped out of the shower, ready to go back to Ginny, he found Malfoy sitting upright on the bed, twisting a handful of quilt in his hands and staring straight into Harry's eyes.
All of the sudden the excited voice was replaced by pondering, which jolted Harry out of his secret musings.
Harry's next words hanged in his mouth unvoiced. He stared at the black-haired woman in shock; she had never once been so rude to him. Cheeky, cunning, Slytherin-like, that was Diane, but never rude. His daughter-in-law looked at him as if he was a strange man, and when she turned away he could swear there was a flash of disgust on her face. Before Harry could speak another word, however, she had quietly walked out to the hallway.
Edward did not tell the sobbing crowd that he had caught the man whispering a name on the other side of the closed door, a name belonging to someone long dead, nor did he tell them of the trace of green on the tip of the man’s wand.
Harry came over to James' London house one day to the sound of chatter in his grandson's nursery. Upon looking inside he found James and his wife playfully argued over Albus' cot, James having a mock hurt face and Diane rolling her eyes while lightly punching his arm.
One night, a couple months into the start of the year, Harry found himself restlessly pacing on top of the Astronomy Tower sometime just past midnight. He was tired yet his mind would not stop turning, the hum and thrum of battle would not quiet in his ears and his legs would not stop twitching, as if begging him to run. There, as he paced the floor like a caged tiger, the door creaked open and Pansy Parkinson came into view. Parkinson had largely slipped from his mind even though he knew that she was back at Hogwarts. Now, properly seeing her for the first time after many months, she looked as different as could be to the girl who used to antagonise them. In a way she was like many other Hogwarts students, older, weary and drained. But, when her eyes met his, he could see a familiar rage, as if the end of the War had done nothing to sweeten his image in her eyes. The old hostility felt oddly comforting and he waited for a familiar insult to come. Yet that never came.
Harry laughed out loud and strolled towards the cot, bending down to pick up the awake boy and presented him to the couple. “What, what could be wrong with this sweet child, who is the perfect proof of the harmonious love between you two? See how his wild black hair and little mouth belongs to a Potter, his sharp nose is definitely of a Warrington, not to mention his blue eye-”
“Was he? Me and Scorp were out there this morning. There were lots of fancy gravestones out there, with lots of words on them. But there was this one with just a flower, and another simple one that said, uh, Dra... Dragon... Lucy... Malfoy... Potter?”
Sometimes, he wondered whether his not-relationship with Potter was a by-product of the bond. A Stockholm’s Syndrome sort of situation, in which the life of one party was under the (subconscious) control to another without said party’s consent. Why else would Draco agree to this pointless secret affair with him? Potter was an idiot who took unnecessary risks, a hot-headed fool that got provoked into the dumbest things, not to mention the whole nemesis-of-the-Dark-Lord thing. But, he was also unbearably kind, and his jokes were surprisingly witty, and he always brought Draco those Blood Quills that he liked so much. "You’re like a vampire", he would say with his nose wrinkled up as he watched Draco enthusiastically demolish the Quills with gusto, yet at their next rendezvous he would still find a Quill hidden in one of Potter’s pockets.
On his sixteenth birthday, Pansy sent him a painting that depicted a viewpoint from a window with brick-walled buildings and an expansive sky in blue. In the accompanying card she wrote,
But then, Harry asked himself one night as he stared listlessly at the canopy of his bed, a week after he was discharged with sleep eluding him for just as long, why must he torment himself this way. Their relationship had never made sense. Well, Harry knew that he loved Draco, had been for a long time, had picked fights with him and antagonised him and pulled pigtails for years, anything to get Draco’s attention. But he never knew whether Draco also felt the same. Perhaps Draco was just going along for the ride, flattered by being chosen. Perhaps it was simply Draco’s self-preservation, making full use of Harry’s weak spot, using it to keep his family safe from Voldermort. Perhaps listening to Harry’s feeling out loud was too much on Draco’s conscience, that was why he stopped Harry from confessing. And now that the imminent threat to his family was gone, there was no more reason to stick around. What else could explain the total silence?
So that was what James was so upset about all dinner? Honestly, James could be disapproval at the tiniest thing, a trait not inherited from Harry at all. He chuckled. “They are just silly children's tales, James, nothing for you to be alarmed about-”
“I'm fully aware that she was my mother, but that was no excuse for leaving my father out of my life like this!”
So he started to follow them around. The two of them tried to be subtle, they really did, but Draco was good at keeping to the shadows. He knew that they were visiting the Room of Requirement an awful lot, but he did not know why. During his spare time, he took to wandering around on the Seventh Floor, conjuring up different versions of the Room and checking for clues as to whether they were the right ones, but not never pinpoint the correct room. He knew that the two of them were receiving a lot of curse-guarded letters that they said were from family (which might as well be true), but Draco could not really find a way to sneak a peek without tripping on the curses. He thought he could try to divide and conquer, knowing that Greg was more of a follower than Vincent, yet his threats and begging remained unsuccessful. Only once did he confront them outright when he caught them stumbling into bed sometime near dawn, their eyes bloodshot from lack of sleep and their faces stormy with frustration.
James did not tell him when he found out that his wedding day was his grandmother's death anniversary. He did not tell him that instead of going to Italy as they had planned, that year he took Albus and his newborn son to their great-grandmother's grave and cried into Diane's soft hair as they listened to the old house elves' stories of the last Lady Malfoy.
“… Yes, he is. But Albus, you've already met him once when he was still alive. Remember that time when you fell into a river and almost drowned?”
Many years from now, Harry would often find himself in that room, lounging on the couch and tucked among cushions and blankets as his god-children and nieces and nephews fussed over him, nagging that he should have stayed in bed and kept his feet up. On one such days, as Teddy closed the door behind him, the conversation with Hugo and his cousins muffled by the heavy wooden door, Harry sat alone in the quiet room, surrounded by the looming frames of paintings. Once upon a time, when he sought refuge in this very room, wishing for a moment free from the ever-present threats of war, he was not alone. Back then, there was someone by his side, pointy elbows and knees poking into his side as the two of them were entwined on the ratty couch. Someone would have cursed at him, calling him names as if from habit, yet their voice would have been fond.
His eyes landed on the painting above the mantelpiece, the one that got Narcissa so shaken. He got it on a trip to Paris, one of those spontaneous weekend trips when he pretended to be a Muggle and blended in a foreign crowd where no one knew his name. He had never been big on arts of any kind, yet at some point had found himself at a museum, peering at framed paintings and marble sculptures like the other hundred or so tourists like himself. Then, in the corner of his eyes, a lone painting called out like a beacon. He did not pretend to know how to appreciate the art style, but for some reason this one caught his attention. The picture was calming, yet also melancholy, and he could not tear his eyes away from it. As he gazed at the painting, heedless of the buzzing white noise of the shoving crowd around him, in his mind flashed a picture-perfect frame of a sky, the tickling breeze on his face and the warmth on his palms as if touched. It reminded him of a girl that he had not seen in years and a boy he had not stopped thinking about for just as long. Maybe that was why he got himself a copy of the painting, one of those mass-produced replicas that were sold to tourists who fancied having a part of the artist for themselves.
In the end, neither Muggle nor magical means could forever prolong Ginny's life. Her weak body finally gave up half a decade later, just a few days after James' 5
“I asked our Healers about it and they agreed on the same thing. They seem to think that the embryos are incompatible to the female surrogates and fail to attach to the uterus. So, either there is something wrong about the embryos or the women and the healers seemed to lean on the latter.”
Harry supposed he should have been more wary of their motives, showing up at his door all out of the blue. Yet, as he saw the desperation in Narcissa’s eyes, he was reminded of a kinder woman, who kissed and looked at her son like he was the brightest star in her world, who rolled up her sleeves and baked cookies with her sister for children she did not know, who kept them well-fed and watered when they were buried in Horcrux research. There came a compulsion to show said woman kindness, and so he stepped aside and let them in. He showed them into the small living room with his cluttered things and mismatched furniture, as if daring them to make a comment. Surprisingly, none came. He watched with apprehension as the Malfoys seated themselves on his creaking sofa and swept their eyes all over the room in fascination. He watched as their eyes lingered on the jar of Blood Quills on the coffee table, on the stack of books for his Potions course at the Auror Academy, on various knick-knacks scattered here and there. Then Narcissa’s eyes fell upon the painting hanging over the mantelpiece. Without looking away, she blindly grasped for her husband’s hand.
And then it began, Ginny's so-called Plan to Woo Malfoy into having Their Baby. It began with Ginny sending little inconspicuous gifts discreetly to Malfoy at his office under Harry's name, because after all Harry had a marital status to maintain. Fluttering owls with charmed notes tracked down Malfoy Manor where the man now stayed .Then it was Harry giving Malfoy long meaningful looks every time they met and accidental brushes of skin whenever Harry could find a chance.
They started to visit a counsellor and put their names down on the surrogate waiting list. Despite the anonymity of the procedure, somehow the couple found themselves with a surrogate after just a few weeks. Maybe their Healer had pulled some strings, or maybe it was Harry, anxious to please Ginny, was actually the one pulling strings, by then it no longer mattered. The insemination was done soon after, then came the two weeks waiting for the pregnancy to be confirmed. Two weeks of both of them nervously on the edge of their seats and a great air of excitement in the house, Ginny even forgetting a Healer's monthly appointment. The day of their appointment found the couple waiting in the Healer's office looking as if their hearts would jump out of their throats at any moment.
It was during this time that Potter became Harry, and between their mingled breaths, even though he should have known better, Draco began to hope.
At first, there was worry and fear. What if Draco was hurt during the Battle? But Harry was sure that he was not among the other wounded that were in the Infirmary, and Draco’s name was not on the casualty list printed in the Prophet. He asked Mrs Weasley who was volunteering at St Mungo’s where an injured George was staying, but was reassured that no Hogwarts students was hospitalised there.
On the night after Malfoy's first Healer's appointment, Harry called Ginny right away after he was sure Malfoy was asleep. Ginny had sounded so full of life when she lapped up details of the baby, how long ago it was conceived, how big it was then, the estimated due date, if it was all healthy, if Harry brought back a scan photo for her. For a moment, Harry forgot that he was standing in the hallway of the Malfoy Manor and was instead cuddling up to his wife on their bed, discussing happily after
The first few days following the diagnosis, Ginny acted as if nothing had happened. She woke up with a bright smile and hummed to herself as she made scrambled eggs in the kitchen, she kissed Harry good morning with a twinkle in her eyes, she joked over an article in
It had been years since he last physically heard of the name. The same could not be said about his dreams, which frequently featured a familiar blond boy, looking the same year after year as he did not age, his maddening smirk, his piercing eyes, the hitch in his breath when they held hands, the oddly metallic taste on the tip of his tongue, the scent of bergamot in his dampened hair. Ten years had not blurred any of his features and also had not erased the bitterness that his departure had left.
Annoyed and furious, Harry considered ignoring the woman. Still, when she continued on her way down the hall and bore no interest in whether he followed her or not, he grumbled to himself in irritation, then followed her through the hallway, catching her before she made a turn at the end of a staircase. They walked quietly up the marble steps, neither making an effort to break the uncomfortable silence. Once they were on the second floor, Diane turned into a corridor and finally stopped in front of one of the doors. She abruptly turned around to look at Harry, as if telling him 'this was it'. He gave her a questioning look that went unanswered, but approached the door anyway. Once he was sure that the woman did not intend to follow him, he opened the door and entered the room.
“Ow! Bloody bird! What the-“ he looked closely at the frantic owl, and realized he recognized it. The second thing he realized, was the fact that there was blood covering her feet and feathers. She pecked at his wrist to grab his attention, and thrust out her ankle to get him to take the letter tied to it.
Harry jolted upright in his bed, cringing at his uncle’s deafening yell. He didn’t have to move very far though, because about five seconds later, he heard giant booming footsteps stalking towards his bedroom door, and stopping just outside.
Mr. Dursley swung his arm forward and let his fist connect with his nephew’s face. Harry’s glasses flew across the room and shattered upon impact with the dresser. For a very short moment, there was complete silence as Mr. Dursley stared in shock at what he had just done, and as Harry brought a hand slowly to his face, in shock at what his uncle had just done.
Vernon took a few steadying breaths and let the poor owl drop to the floor, flopping around awkwardly and trying to get itself back to its feet. “Do you know what Miss Stiggs said when she saw that bloody bird, boy?”
Draco furrowed his brows and read through the letter twice more, while the owl continued to frantically peck at his wrists, urging him to hurry.
Draco looked around at the room they were standing in. The Malfoy Manor was a very large, and very spacious house, and if his father didn’t want to deal with Harry Potter, he probably wouldn’t have to. He could just stay on the other side of the manor, and keep clear of the room where they kept Harry.
But that moment ended quickly, and Mr. Dursley lunged again, bringing his anger out on poor Harry Potter.
The locks clicked, one by one, as Vernon Dursley opened Harry Potter’s door, his face nearly purple from rage. “I’VE HAD IT!! YOUR BLOODY FRIENDS SENDING YOU THINGS BY BIRD! DO YOU KNOW WHAT JUST HAPPENED, BOY?”
“Help me. Please just get me out. Number Four (4), Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey. Please hurry, mate. -Harry”
Draco Malfoy was sitting on a comfortable chair in the back yard of his family manor, reading a book with an interesting passage on the effects of the Draught of Living Death. The sun was shinning brightly overhead, and the wind was wildly rustling the leaves of the nearby trees. That is likely the reason that Draco didn’t hear the owl flying towards him until she was on top of him.
A flare of irritation grew hot at the pit of Harry’s stomach as Draco gave him one of his famous “Thank me for saving the day” expressions. Before Draco could get another word in through that pompous mouth of his, Harry bellowed
The stubbornness had brought Harry to their current case. Someone was targeting gay wizards in a seedy tavern, reports stating that the assailant had thoroughly seduced the wizard to the general public, and in the morning the subject of that seduction was found naked and brutally beat up. The case had drawn the Ministry’s attention, and a skittish public had questioned the rampant homophobia that seemed to be associated with the attacks. So Kingsley had assigned Draco and Harry to the case, citing that they were his best and that the matter needed to be shut down quickly. Draco had immediately offered to be bait, citing that he had seen this type of thing in France. Harry had questioned if Draco was the right fit for the job, to which the blonde had spun on his heel and heatedly reminded Harry that he was best qualified for the job.
Harry pulled his wand out, every Auror instinct screaming at him that this was it. Sure enough as he rounded the corner he spotted two heads, one bearing the trademark whitish blonde hair. Harry picked up his pace, sprinting at a speed that would have made the Auror Academy fitness coach proud.
Unfortunately, that meant that while the rest of the Aurors were paired off and out in the field, due to a lack of applicants Harry was stuck inside the Ministry dealing with an Auror’s least favorite part of the job. For weeks, he pored over badly spelled reports, catching errors that veteran Aurors had made, grinding his teeth when he found pieces of tainted evidence, or unwarranted surveillance that tossed out cases.
And then a slight pinch from Malfoy, probably frustrated that Harry was just letting him grope him on the dance floor without putting in any effort. Grey eyes met green eyes, and Harry was absolutely positive that Malfoy was just as effected as him. The blonde’s eyes were almost dark, the pupils so dilated it didn’t seem like an act. Malfoy tilted his head to the side casually as if he was requesting Harry to step off the dance floor, when Harry didn’t respond, he retracted his hands from Harry, the contact dropping Harry’s heart. He followed Malfoy’s gaze, in the direction where a male wizard stood back.
Hesitant, Draco placed the folded letter in her palm, and watched her unfold and read it through once more. Without a backwards glance at her husband, Narcissa apparated with a loud popping noise, disappearing from the house. Lucius turned his fury to his son.
Harry glanced down to Mr. Dursley’s rather large hand and saw that he was indeed holding a very frightened owl, with a letter still tied to its ankle. He met his uncle’s eyes once more, and was vaguely frightened of the pure unbridled rage he saw there. It was anger like he had never seen from Vernon Dursley. He slowly shrank back onto his bed.
“When she gets back here, just know, Draco, if she has the boy with her... You and I will be having some words.” With that, he turned on his heal and strode  out of the room, leaving Draco alone and slightly nervous about what was to come.
Mrs. Dursley and Dudley Dursley stood in the doorway, not speaking, not moving, but simply staring at their husband and father, speechless. Thoughtless. Emotionless. He had never done anything like this before, and this sudden burst was quite a shock for them.
Harry sat on his bed, with a strange, twisted sort of expression on his face. “I suppose you’ll tell me,” he replied, nonplussed.
Hedwig flew fast, knowing Harry was close to death, knowing that she had to find someone who could help him. After flying hard and fast for the next hours, she landed at the kitchen window of the Burrow. She pecked at the glass, looking inside to find any of the Weasleys. But the house was dark, and there was no one in sight. She flew around back to see if they were outside playing Quidditch, but there was no one there. The Burrow was empty, and the Weasley’s were nowhere to be found.
After silently watching for a few minutes, Mrs. Dursley began to yell at her husband, begging him to stop, telling him he would kill the boy. Harry was already much to small and thin for his age, not quite fourteen (14), and if he had to endure any more of this abuse, he might not live to see another year at Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry.
“Get to the Burrow, Hedwig. Get it to Ron, or Mrs. Weasley, or anyone. If you can’t find them, then.... Just get it to someone I can trust. Please hurry Hedwig,” and with that, Harry passed out on his bedroom floor, covered in blood, and much too close to death than he should have been.
When Vernon had finally listened to Petunia and stopped, Harry was lying bloody on his bedroom floor, Hedwig, having just got back from a hunt, was screeching and pecking at Harry gently to try to help him, the messenger owl was also screeching in its place on the floor next to Harry, and the Dursley’s were sitting in the living room downstairs, silently debating how to handle this without bringing unwanted attention to their house and lives.
Hedwig, being quite the intelligent bird, knew she did not have time to try to hunt down the Weasley family, so she began to fly straight for the next person she knew could help Harry.
“That is enough Lucius! The boy needs help, and I don’t care what you say. We will help him!” Narcissa turned and stalked towards her son, holding out her hand. “Give me the letter, Draco.”
But, it appeared that the future always had different plans for Harry. Within a week of graduating from the Auror program, Harry had been presented with his first piece of bad news. He and Ron couldn’t work together as partners on the force. The way Kingsley had explained it to an indignant Ron and Harry, was that it wasn’t that they weren’t a good fit, it just wasn’t fair to the rest of the batch who would be paired off randomly. Not that Harry really complained, he had always determined that wherever he would achieve in his now adult life would not be based on the fact that he was known as “The Saviour”, if he was going to achieve anything, he was going to do on his own terms with his own merit.
Just as he reached Draco, the blonde bellowed “STUPEFY!!”, a red light emitting from Draco’s wand causing the other man who had been advancing menacingly towards Draco to fly towards the wall, his back making a sickening crack as he crashed to the ground, a motionless heap. Harry caught the pleased expression on Draco’s face as he nudged the man on the ground making sure he was truly out cold.
Harry’s mind also flashed to Narcissa Malfoy. Kingsley he could somewhat handle, but Draco’s more scary than any other women Harry had known, was someone he couldn’t come across.
He didn’t think it could’ve gotten any worse but then once crisp December morning Kingsley had called Harry into his office looking grim. At first Harry thought someone had died, but the news Kingsley had given him was in Harry’s somewhat selfish opinion worse than death. They had found a partner; it was just someone Harry had ever expected to be paired with.
Him? Staring at Draco’s ass? “I’m not staring at your ass.” he bit back indignantly, mindful that no one else’s attention was drawn to him. He looked up to make eye contact with Draco, the blonde was smirking in a way Harry hadn’t seen him display since their Hogwarts days. There seemed to be something primal in the smile as Draco lazily tilted his head to give Harry a “come hither” glance through hooded grey eyes that seemed to lock Harry in his place.
“Oh please Potter” stated Draco as he extended his hand towards Harry, “My stubbornness gets the job done.”
Draco’s voice crackled over the wire in Harry’s ear and he drew himself back into the present. “What is it Malfoy?” he said sitting up alert, wondering if somehow their suspect had slipped through the crowd. “It would be beneficial if you stopped staring at my ass” Draco’s voice seemed clipped but there also seemed to be a tone of something underlying it, a tone of frustration or something Harry couldn’t quite place. He choked on the drink in his mouth spraying out droplets as he indignantly tried to form words.
. Even after almost a year of being paired with Draco, Harry still found it ludicrous that some high ranking Ministry official had pored over their files and decided that “Yes Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy should be paired together during high risk missions, that would be spectacular” and he had been so appalled that he had asked Kingsley if he was loopy, which in hindsight was not the best thing to ask one’s boss. After that, Harry debated quitting. No job was worth it entrusting his life to a pompous git that had tried to end his life multiple times.
Harry would've disagreed. The regular Harry would've laughed in Draco's face, and then reprimanded him, threaten to report him to his superiors. But he restrained from that, owing it to the big victory that they had just secured, definitely not the waves of relief that had crashed over him, seeing that Draco was okay. Nope, Harry definitely did not have any of those feelings.
Kingsley had firmly decreed that despite the two hating each other they would have to reach a consensus, and be on their best behavior, especially on times they were representing the Ministry. Any type of indiscretion based on it’s severity would lead to effective termination, with limited chance of gaining reentry in the Ministry. So as much as Harry and Draco wanted to punch the living daylights out of each other, they were bound to be on their best behavior.
He watched as multiple emotions flitted through Draco’s face. Consternation, followed by anger, followed by defeat, again anger, and then some undecipherable emotion Harry couldn’t label. “Fine” Draco stated petulantly, sulking like they were back in Hogwarts and he had just been reprimanded from committing a much wanted action. Releasing his grip from Harry’s hand, he spun around on his toes with an elegance that would have made the students of Beauxbaton envious, and turned to head off the dance floor.
The two had argued some more once they were back in the office, with Harry pointing out that Draco’s permanent stubbornness and his not so subtle upper class upbringing would immediately set off bells for the assailant. Draco had argued that he was going to handle it perfectly, his eyes flashing as he lashed out at Harry and stating that if Harry didn’t trust him he would just go by himself.
When Harry Potter signed an oath to become an Auror he had imagined a ton of things, pursuits on brooms with the wind blowing in his face, chasing dangerous suspects down dimly light alleys, apprehending dark and dangerous artifacts, and at the end of the day cracking a pint with his fellow Aurors, relaxing in the comfort that they had put away yet another individual and protected the Wizarding World for another night.
Harry watched with narrowed eyes as Draco danced gracefully around the floor, he wasn’t the typical drunk dancer with his limbs thrashing all over the place, he seemed to swoop and glide over the floor, an enigma to the point all other couples occasionally paused to watch him. The dark fitted shirt that Draco had gone for rode up exposing one small sliver of pale, toned skin. Harry’s mouth went dry for a second as he focused on it (but it was the foul drink he had, drying his tongue ok?).
Ron had backed him, vehemently saying that they could appeal it and Harry could join the foreign law enforcement services, or go to other countries and apply for MDLE positions. Hermione had been more thoughtful going as far as to admonish Harry and Ron that it had been years since they had last seen Draco, and for all they knew he could’ve changed from the sour faced, blood and status obsessed boy to an actual human being who was well suited for that position. And when Harry still refused to come to terms with it completely she had sent him a Howler that had singed his office and cracked his eardrum, reprimanding him for being so shallow minded laying emphasis that she couldn’t believe that someone like him was so stubborn.
The general consensus to obtaining those results was that Harry tried to keep Draco’s presence in his life limited to just their work. It wasn’t difficult considering Draco chose to spend as little time with the rest of the Aurors as possible. While the rest of them went out for drinks or dinner, Draco politely turned down each invitation citing paperwork or other reasons. When that reason stopped working Draco bribed other Aurors into doing their share of work in order to exclude himself from the group. Even those who came from the same House as him were turned away with polite aloofness. In fact as Harry noted, it seemed that Draco was on edge. When it came to work he was sharp, catching onto things that only Harry and veteran Aurors saw, sometimes even seeing things they didn’t. He executed every mission, putting in more effort than the rest of them. Every piece of his paperwork was perfected with no room for error, the penmanship looking like it was printed on the parchment and the report so tight that most if not all cases were pulled in the Auror’s favor.
Fuck. This was not good at all. Harry tried to limit his breathing from the panicky gasps, to more controlled intakes of air. Where could’ve Draco gone? Better yet, who could he ask without tipping off an entire tavern full of people, half- who he was sure were doing something illicit that there were two Auror\s in the midst of them. As he pushed past through a thoroughly immersed couple, inciting shouts of indignation from both of them, he could hear an incensed shouting down the corner of a darkened hallway.
Harry wasn’t having that so he had reluctantly, with a bad feeling trickling in his stomach, followed Draco to the site of the crime. Now as he sat in the seedy tavern nursing a rather bitter whiskey, he was absolutely certain this was going to backfire. His eyes sought Draco in the dimly lit dance floor, where the blonde was currently dancing. The latter had dressed down, a far cry from his expensive dress robes to a more appropriate going out attire, his platinum blonde hair that was always brushed to the point not one strand escaped was now mussed with sweat dripping down his face. To the casual passerby, Draco seemed just like a regular boy out for a night of fun and drinks. But to the more trained eye, one would note a silver wire that was fitted into his ear. Hermione had charmed the earpieces stating that it would help Harry and Draco stay in constant contact throughout the night.
Harry was panicking. Well panicking was an understatement, he was past the panicking stage and now in the stage where he felt that his heart would practically rip out of his chest and land on the floor. At first, as he stood back on the dance floor keeping an eye on the couples and also their potential suspect, Harry hadn’t really paid attention to the time Draco had been absent. He had chalked it off to Draco probably blowing off steam in the bathroom, ranting to some drunken stranger about Harry and his difficulties. But as time moved on, and the dance floor thinned out, and a grumpy looking witch had made her way three times to Harry asking to refill his drink, he realized something was horribly amiss. And as he turned around to the corner where their suspect had been huddled, he definitely felt his heart drop. Oh Fuck.
Seriously. What was happening? And then Malfoy leaned in, and Harry should’ve honestly been leaning away, but once again it seemed his body couldn’t move. His blood was on fire, dear god, and there was something tightening in his lower region. As Malfoy leaned closer, Harry really saw his face. Malfoy must have been part Veela, he thought, whereas most Aurors including Harry bore the trauma of their work on their face through creases from frowning or lines from long nights, Malfoys face looked like he was still at Hogwarts. His skin almost glowed with a youthful exuberance that would have made any criminal think two times about believing he was an Auror.
If one asked Harry about one negative thing he had gathered about Draco, it would’ve been the younger Malfoy’s deep seated stubbornness. That hadn’t changed from their Hogwarts days, Draco still exhibited the “If I’m right, I’m right” mentality. Which in most cases he was, but sometimes Harry had the strong indication that Draco also deserved his fist connecting with that smug face.
