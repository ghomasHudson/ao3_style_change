“A little cold is swimming in October, not freaking February, I’ll be surprised if it isn’t frozen! Do you want an icicle for a soul-mate, because that’s what you’re going to get!”
A small moon was printed beneath the note and Draco fought very hard to contain the smile that the letter brought out in him. Harry was confident that Draco represented the sun on Harry’s chest, and was obviously going with that logic for his signature. Draco carefully folded the note and tucked it under the box before peeling back the paper. Sitting at the bottom of the box was a dragon. It was about 15 centimetres tall and with some closer inspection Draco noticed it was a Norwegian Ridgeback. Draco chuckled at Harry’s cheek, his mind flashing back to their first year. He pulled out his wand and tapped the dragon. Instantly the dragon turned to look at him, stretching its neck and flapping its wings a couple times. Draco could barely believe what he was looking at, as the dragon crawled off the metal base and attempted to climb the side of the box.
If you want to get an update on when I'll be posting again, my (largely unused ngl seriously tiktok has ruled my life [I promise I'm an actual adult]) tumblr is: silverlynings (yep same as my username) I'll post an update there. Feel free to rant at me there too if you'd like.
“Oh,” Harry genuinely smirked, for the first time since before the 3rd Task it seemed. “Yeah, I can do that.”
“Obviously I’ve known about this for what seems like forever, but it’s even more surreal to see it with my own eyes.”
“I doubt they can actually keep anyone if you should fail, but we still don’t know if it’s a person you need to retrieve,” Hermione tried to calm Harry down, and Draco shook out his hands. He needed to pull his head from his arse and stop being a shitty soul-mate.
Draco cut him off, "I couldn’t handle the thought of going to back to living under the same roof as Lucius. I doubt I could go the whole summer without seeing you anyways. I have come to terms with it. It'll be fine. The only thing I'm worried about right now is you. Let me see if I can get you some clothes. Unless you'd rather go out like that," Draco teased gesturing at Harry's completely nude body. He was gratified to see a light blush on Harry's cheeks. "I thought so. Just a moment."
“Sirius offered me to let him live with him once I found out the true story of what happened the night my parents died, but then Wormtail got away and Sirius is on the run. I don’t know why it still matters I go back there. But I’m rambling; I don’t want to rant about my terrible home life. That’s not why I asked you about yours.”
Who's attacking Harry? This isn't the last we see of them. Big bonding up for next chapter, and the Second Task slated for the following. Who's finding their soulmate and will Draco be at the bottom of the Lake?  We shall see. Things really start to pick up from here. Like seriously, we'll be at the end of this before you know it.
Thank you again for the amazing reaction so far! Look for another update most likely on Thursday, which has a scene most of you might be looking forward to! Feel free to post your guesses as to what that is! Have a wonderful rest of the week!
“Professor Snape, will we be missing our double with you because of the task?” Draco asked loudly, distracting Snape from his belittlement of Ron and Harry.
Draco looked into the mirror. His face was an absolute mess. His cheekbone an angry red, a cut about two inches wide present right below his eye. Draco mopped up the stained blood until just the bruise and cut remained. He was going to have a massive black eye.
Dumbledore returned the stare for a few moments before glancing at the curtains and sighing slightly, “A worthy endeavour indeed. Now you must excuse me, I have matters to attend to. I dearly hope your injury is easily mendable.
Harry tuned out the two of them now that their voices had lowered, his eyes drifting to the group of Slytherins entering the Hall. Pansy was clinging to Draco’s arm as per usual, but the lovebites Harry had left on Draco were still on proud display. Pansy actually had the audacity to look over at Harry and wink subtly. Harry choked on his orange juice and went back to staring at his plate.
Draco pulled away slightly, sighing softly, his eyes closing for a moment. Harry could feel an overwhelming swirl of emotions flowing through.
Malfoy was standing in front of a cauldron, his uniform shirt rolled up to his elbows. At the sound of the door opening, he whipped around, wand in hand.
“Yeah, sorry,” He apologized and Draco's smile widened, little crinkles forming next to his eyes. Harry felt the butterflies that normally came with Draco smiling at him, spring to life.
“She’s quite good at a lot of things, you just have to give her a chance. A lot of the Slytherins come off as terrible but it’s just how they protect themselves. They’re used to people hating them on principle. Most of their home lives are as great as mine and Draco’s.”
“What did Wormtail do to piss you off that badly?” Draco asked. He had very sparse knowledge on his soul-mate’s father’s friends. He knew Black had gone to Azkaban for allegedly blowing up Peter Pettigrew, but his mother had never believed he had done it. Where had his body gone? The pieces still have to go somewhere; they don’t just disappear once someone has been blown up.
Hermione grabbed the back of Draco’s robes, pulling him into the shadows next to the entrance to the Castle.
“It’s fine,” He said bitterly. “I didn’t expect her to come running to comfort me or anything. It just sucks.” He shook his head and looked up at Harry. “Did you enjoy the show this morning?”
“Excuse me, what?” Draco asked, then shook his head, “You all caught him though, right? What was just happening?”
Hermione scrawled ‘What is wrong?’ in runes across the parchment for their next translation. She handed the note over, quickly translating the passage they were supposed to be scribing and watched Draco’s face as he puzzled out her words. His eyes narrowed at the message. He scrawled back a few runes and they swapped again.
"Who are you and what have you done with Draco Malfoy?" Weasley asked, his face painted in confusion and shock.
“Just checking to see if the Boy Wonder, Granger, and Thomas had made it home safe, we were hoping that half of Gryffindor house would be gone.”
“I guess a month isn’t too bad to be apart, earlier if you can Apparate,” Harry said quietly and Draco looked at him in surprise.
“What?” Harry asked, head whipping towards him. The potion exploded loudly, contained within Draco’s shield.
Coming up next chapter is the Third Task!!! The next couple chapters are my favorite in the entire fic, so I truly hope you all enjoy them as much as I did writing them. Thank you for tuning in!
“They can’t touch me now, it’s fine,” Harry shrugged. “It wasn’t always like that. He normally just yells a lot, but you asked. Has your father ever done something like that? Or your mother?”
Draco didn’t look away. “I’ll fix it,” He said absently. “It’s important to me that you realize it’s not a bad thing to be brilliant. You don’t have to downplay your accomplishments, especially not to me. Why do you insist upon it?”
Draco hoped Harry liked his gift, he knew he was treading a very fine line in getting it for him. Draco had left a very detailed note in hopes that it would help Harry feel better about it. He also had enlisted Hermione’s help in assuaging Harry’s anxiety.
“I’m still all for you telling them to shove it. Why don’t you just sit on the beach and build a sandcastle?” Draco suggested.
“I liked dragons growing up...” He trailed off, refusing to look over at Hermione. He seemed to shake himself, “That doesn’t make sense though, they’re all so different. It would be like having one person fighting a hippogriff and the other one fighting a flobberworm. Welsh Greens are barely considered dangerous next to a Hungarian Horntail, they feed on sheep!”
Cedric was dead. A boy just a few years older than himself. A boy that had been smiling and walking around with his family just hours before. Gone.
“You- Know- Who!” Hermione said, her eyes still on the sky, her hand shaking where it clenched Harry’s elbow.
“No one often does, and yet,” He countered as he settled further onto the hospital cot. Dumbledore’s bushy brows lifted minutely and Draco kept himself from smirking in triumph. Dumbledore may be one of Harry’s favourite people, but Draco didn’t trust him as far as he could
Harry made it to right outside the door before he quickly checked the map one last time, pocketed it and his cloak, and pushed through the door.
Harry spent the next hour dodging spells and trying to transfigure objects on the fly to block the curses he couldn’t dodge. He winced as a Stinging Hex collided with his leg and he tumbled to the floor, rolling to keep his momentum despite the pain and diving beneath a table he had conjured earlier.
It didn’t take long until suddenly half of the Slytherin house was exploding into various human-sized canaries. Draco watched as Blaise exploded in feathers, but instead of the customary yellow that the rest of the house were sporting, his were a wonderful rainbow of colours. Draco hadn’t said what Blaise did to piss him off, but the colours were perfectly fitting. Draco assumed the colours were simply so he stuck out the hardest.
Pomfrey sighed before nodding once, “You have a point. I will leave it out, but I’ll be having a conversation with Mr. Malfoy once he is feeling better.”
“Oi, Weasleys,” Draco called and their gazes whipped upward, faces darkening when they realized who called for them.
None other than Pansy marched through the ward, and Draco stared at her in shock. The rest of their company also stared at Pansy in silence.
Draco sighed deeply, extremely put out, but did as he was instructed. Every part of his body yearning to rebel and peek his eyes open.
She scowled, rolling her eyes. “Let’s see your Mark, you wouldn’t be thick enough to let just anyone do that to you. And don’t test me; you’re going to need me.”
“If this turns me into an animal of some sort...” He hedged and the two of them rolled their eyes again.
“I think I can last a few minutes without you,” Harry teased and Draco nodded before following Severus from the room.
Pansy smiled at him, quickly kissing his forehead before heading back to the Common Room. He assumed she was abstaining from the trip simply to avoid his Father. Draco sighed and turned to exit the Castle. He had just made it outside when he felt himself being hauled backward into the shadows next to the front doors. Everyone outside was too excited at the aspect of going into Hogsmeade to notice.
Harry’s forehead was still enflamed, but his arm was healed besides a thin scar Pomfrey hadn’t been able to heal. Draco suspected it was because of the nature of the injury. Dark rituals involved a lot of give and take and sacrifice. He would have been surprised if she had been able to heal it. It hadn’t stopped her from fruitlessly trying multiple times.
“If I remember correctly, he did insult your mother at the beginning of the year. Two birds, one stone, as they say.”
Draco’s heart fell into the pit of his stomach. Dread filling him for what Harry was going to no doubt experience, he hoped his meeting with Sirius had ended up being far, far away.
It's final's week everyone! Sorry for the lateness, but I've been hella busy. Also ran into some writer's block, but I worked through it. Draco finally got his revenge! I don't really think the Weasleys would love working with Draco, but they're also desperate for gold at this point and see it as a fun way to prank the entire Slytherin house, while doing a small favor for Draco. (I totally see the Twins secondary house as Slytherin, through and through).
“Nope,” Draco popped the ‘p’ and finished tying his tie. He hated how tightly it cinched if he tried to tie it by magic.
“The elf won’t try to take you against your will?” Harry asked, his mind zipping through every worst-case scenario possible.
“Hey, none of that, I’ve gotten over it. I’m so lucky to have you as my soul-mate. I wouldn’t have it any other way.”
“Oi, Fred, George, stop it! You’re shoving me!” Ron complained pushing back at the twins as they jostled him. This was the absolute wrong thing to do as they pushed back at Ron, harder.
So yes, a moment we've all been waiting for is just next chapter. Thank you all for your kind words, how do you think the next chapter is going to play out??
Harry’s mind wasn’t quite working the way it should, he felt ... sluggish. Slugs... Wait, Hagrid. Hagrid could help them. Harry didn’t know what had happened to the Beauxbatons students who had hurt him, but he knew they wouldn’t mess with Hagrid.
Draco shut the hangings on his bed and curled up under the covers, he could hear Theo a bed over lightly snoring. Draco ran his fingers across his mark, gratified to feel a return warmth in his mark from Harry, before drifting off to sleep.
“I thought marks were supposed to be complementary,” Harry found himself asking. The only marks he had known about were like his and Draco’s, opposites.
“No, you’re the one person I do want to talk to about it.” Harry bit his lip, and instantly regretted it as pain blossomed.
“I was almost sorted into Slytherin, you know,” He called casually before slipping quickly out the door.
Draco turned to him with a smile, keeping his eyes glued to Harry’s and not the enflamed and swollen scar on his forehead, barely covered by his fringe.
“He said to bring it into the bath and ‘mull things over in the hot water’,” Harry made air-quotes with his fingers.
“So can we,” Ginny supplied, glancing quickly at Luna who nodded in agreement. Harry noticed Luna was quite happy with just quietly observing things most of the time.
Draco bid goodnight to his friends, thankful that overt public displays of affection this early in the relationship would be considered completely uncouth so that he could get away with not kissing Pansy in public. Technically leaving love bites on display was considered over the line, but as long as Pansy didn’t show up with any his housemates wouldn’t be writing home to their parents about their indiscretions.
Draco bit his lip, he supposed Harry was right. They had gotten so swept up with the tournament and understanding the bond better that they forgot about getting to know each other outside of their bond. “Er, I would say it’s a normal Pureblood estate, but that doesn’t say much for you. The Manor is three floors tall, but then there are the dungeons and cellars below. We each have our own wing, and then there’s the area for entertaining and casual time. The grounds were always my favourite part. We have miles of land around the Manor, with my mother’s gardens, the forest, and the Quidditch Pitch. I used to spend all day out on the grounds and my mother would have to send the house elves to come retrieve me.”
“It is,” Draco muttered. Pansy stared for another moment before she abruptly turned and fled into the hall.
Draco smiled, crossing the room and crushing Harry to his chest. “Missed you,” Draco whispered quietly into Harry’s ear so Pansy wouldn’t hear.
“You watch your best mate get beaten to shit by some stone chess piece and no one comes! Or you stare at the man who murdered your parents coming out of the back of your fucking professor’s head, and then he’s trying to choke you to death and you feel like your skin is melting off as you press your hands anywhere you can to get him to stop, you feel yourself suffocating and no one comes!
“You’d be thrilled if he died, wouldn’t you! You hate him! Release me at once!” Draco reached for his wand but felt it pulled from his sleeve and held away from him. Severus had managed to manhandle him into the Castle where the corridor was eerily silent with everyone out at the Task.
Snape bullied Harry and Ron for their blunder and Hermione watched Draco’s knuckles turn white around the handle of his knife as he chopped Gurdyroot into equal pieces.
Draco should have been more afraid with how angry he was making Father, but he had become so disenchanted. Father was a bully, nothing more, nothing less.
“How are you?” Harry asked. When he had met Sirius in the cave over a month ago, he had been almost skin and bone. Now after a month of steady meals and being back around people. He was practically a brand-new man. He looked much more like the pictures from Harry’s parent’s wedding.
“You said it makes this awful screeching sound when you open it, right?” Draco asked and Harry nodded.
The three of them finished at the sweets shop and bundled up again before bracing themselves for the cold outside. They hustled down the street and into the Three Broomsticks, hurrying into the warmth of the pub.
“Highly doubt that would ever be possible, besides you’re mostly pink now.” Harry held up his arm next to Ron’s, his brown skin throwing a deep contrast to Ron’s sun-burned forearms.
“Get on with it then, would  you?” One of the boys who had helped spell his limbs together sighed, gripping Harry’s bicep tightly.
“Harry, I –“Draco broke off, he had no idea what to say. The anger that had surged through him the entire day had disappeared. He had always assumed Dumbledore had helped Harry through first and second year. He knew Harry and his friends always got into shit, but had thought it was just them being nosy and in the end, Dumbledore put a stop to it all. Harry had only been 11 and 12-years-old when he did that shit.
Malfoy was lying in a pile on the ground, his hair was in complete disarray, and he was trembling. He quickly got to his feet, glared at Moody, met eyes with Harry briefly before striding from the hall, limping slightly.
“I love you too,” He whispered finally. Draco busied himself with massaging shampoo through Harry’s messy locks, keeping himself from cringing at the blood, dirt, twigs, and other debris that were washing out of his hair.
“Draco, before we go back out there. Draco, he summoned his followers there,” Harry said urgently, his gaze meeting Draco’s.
“He’s also furious I haven’t bonded. He organized for me to touch hands with every suitable Pureblooded girl the moment we were all the correct age. It’s a massive thorn in his side than ‘I’m being stubborn’.”
“Oh, Luna, today is your birthday isn’t it? Happy Birthday!” Ginny said and Harry was quick to wish her a happy birthday as well.
Ha! Harry thought he was so special, being able to find Draco with that sodding Map of his. Now Draco could do the same.
A week later, Draco was at the end of his rope. His whole body ached and he felt worse than when he had Dragon Pox as a child, a condition that had almost killed him. Harry had ignored every attempt for him to explain himself and apologize. To make matters worse, Draco could feel how utterly miserable his soul-mate was. The whole school seemed to be against him, except for a couple of Gryffindors. Weasley was still not speaking to Harry, and Draco was about to be driven to murder if Weasley didn’t pull his head from his arse. Couldn’t he see that Harry needed him?
Harry carefully turned his palm over, looking at the moon shaped cuts on his palm. Harry grabbed his other hand, and looked at the identical cuts on the palm.
The rest of the meal went largely without incident. Draco fended off some passive insults, but thankfully no one brought up Cedric or the Third Task. One thing was glued to Draco’s mind and that was what the summer hols would look like. Draco was decidedly
“There’s nothing quite like it,” Draco said his voice lower than a whisper. Harry squeezed his hand as hard as he could. He hated the idea of Draco having felt the pain before, especially now that he knew what it felt like.
These poor babies. I absolutely loved writing this very very soft and tender chapter. Just Draco bursting out of his comfort zone to be there for Harry. The books always bothered me with how little attention is paid to the incredibly traumatic experience Harry just went through. Not only did Harry witness someone just years older than him die and carry his body back to Hogwarts, but he is tortured and more by the man who literally murdered his parents. Like that's massive. So this was a lot of Harry just retreating into his mind a bit to try to protect himself, and Draco taking care of everything else.
Draco batted her hand away; he was barely comfortable with wearing it down, and the last thing he wanted was Pansy playing with it. “Too much work to style it every day, also stop calling me that, you know I loathe it."
"I know you all are bursting with questions but right now Mr. Potter needs rest. If you don't mind Harry, I have a Dreamless Sleep potion for you. Just strong enough to keep the dreams away, you shouldn't be groggy," Madam Pomfrey said holding out a potion bottle. Harry looked to Draco, who forced yet another smile. His cheeks were beginning to hurt.
“Oh call me Pansy, you may as well, we do share a boyfriend. And it’s barely different than before, I’ve been covering Draco’s arse since we were babies.”
“That’s what that was right?” Harry asked, pulling Hermione from her mental pictures of the book she had read.
*Draco clenches his fists too tightly during the task and his nails cut his palms, just as a head's up*
“What did he do to you? I’m sorry I didn’t find you sooner. It took me a while to get back to the village,” Harry was slightly out of breath. Draco figured he must have sprinted the whole way there. Harry reached up towards Draco’s face and Draco caught his hand before he could touch him.
“Well Mr. Malfoy, I have a salve for your ribs, but they’re a tough mend. You’ll have to stay the night I’m afraid. I will get you a change of clothes in just a moment, I just have to ask our guests to leave. It is quite after visiting hours.”
“What is going on here?” McGonagall yelled as she burst through the crowd watching the ferret fly into the air over and over.
Please let me know what you think, I feel like I haven't been able to interact with yall for too long. Coming up we have some Draco and Theo moments, and the beginning of a wild rollercoaster ride. I cannot wait for us all to dive in!
"So, you're the one young Harry has been sneaking around with," one of the twins interrupted, grinning. Draco couldn't keep himself from chuckling.
“Oh, thanks for the warning,” Harry said, running his fingers through his hair before patting his fringe down repeatedly.
“Now they realize you’re gone…” Malfoy complained under his breath, pulling his arm harder. “Thank Merlin their hair is so damn bright. Remember what I said, now go!” He pushed Harry forward and Harry stumbled a few steps before familiar-freckled arms wrapped around him.
“I didn’t know about Sirius and Lupin until just this summer,” Harry complained, a distinct whinge in his voice. He reached over and pinched Draco hard in the ribs when he wouldn’t stop laughing at him. “Keep it up and I won’t help you.”
Draco also took out another piece of paper and did start to pen a note to his parents so he would have proof of him actually doing what he said he was. He had almost finished his letter when he felt his journal warm slightly, signalling there was an unread message.
The parchment was a map of Hogwarts, with what looked like every student and professor labelled by name with their location signified by footprints on the parchment. “This is what you’ve been using to get around? No wonder you never get caught! You know what, I am cross! You have definitely been holding out on me!”
Draco couldn’t help but notice the frequent jealousy that filtered through whenever Draco got too chummy with any of the Durmstrang students, especially Krum. Draco did his best not to look too pleased.
“No sir, I am thankful to find myself in perfect health. I cannot, unfortunately, say the same for my soul-mate. I couldn’t help but overhear you insinuating that Harry was not of sound mind? I hope I am mistaken.”
“Anyone who has a problem with our new Slytherin friends and wants to be a dick about it can come speak to us, we would love to have a discussion,” One of the twins called down the table.
Draco bid Pansy and Theo goodbye, hurrying from the Common Room. He finally had time to hole himself up in his lab, and had promises from the two of them not to bother him. He really did have a potion to brew for Severus, but he might have greatly exaggerated the difficulty of the potion in question. Draco got started, hoping to have most of the potion finished before Harry showed up.
“Yeah, I’m fine, just not very hungry,” Malfoy’s face morphed into one of annoyance and Harry resolutely stared back down at his plate.
“Mr. Potter, it is me,” Madam Pomfrey assured him as she ducked through the curtain. “I was waiting for you to wake up before rousing him. He will be very disoriented. I need you to help calm him.”
“I am absolutely doomed,” Harry complained, his head in Draco’s lap, finding comfort from Draco’s fingers carding through his hair.
“What does that even mean? You still have two years until you’re a legal adult,” Hermione asked and Draco realized this must have been bugging her ever since Mrs. Weasley had spoken earlier.
“Sorry, Hermione,” Ginny frowned. Harry thought Ron looked pleased, but was trying to transform his expression into something more neutral.
Draco made it to the main foyer of the Manor without incident. He expected nothing less and hoped his luck would hold out. Draco heard piano notes drifting from the salon and ached to go see his mother. It had been so long since he saw her, but he needed to get in and out undetected. Draco bit his lip and pushed on.
Draco seized at his shirt and realized it was fully buttoned again, and Harry was nowhere to be seen. Calming feelings were flowing through the bond, with an edge of adrenaline and excitement.
Draco wasn’t sure he wanted his roommates to know about his dragon yet, so he quickly tapped the dragon which returned to its base and then rendered it invisible. He tucked the note back into the box and set the box up by his pillow, before quickly grabbing another gift.
Draco trekked across the grounds, questioning who the fuck thought a task in February should include the Lake. Whoever they were, they were getting paid far too much in his opinion.
We get a little taste of Sirius and Remus! I am very excited to have these two characters introduced!
Harry squinted at him, "Wandless magic? I don’t know. Sometimes I guess." His eyes caught the corner of blue peeking out of Malfoy’s shirt where he had unbuttoned it slightly. "Can I see it, like, properly?"
“I’ll join you in just a second. Is Theo in the room?” Draco asked glad none of his peers were questioning him on where he was the whole night.
Thank you so much for the fantastic reception! Here's chapter 2 as a treat! We get some drama at the Cup, and some interaction between Draco and Harry. Hope you like it, I think the writing gets less choppy from here. I do have an issue with passive voice. It's a work in progress.
That night Draco did not sleep well. He woke up frequently to the feeling of suffocating. Over and over he was forced to relive the terrible moments when Harry couldn’t get to the surface fast enough. By the morning Draco was exhausted and incredibly short-tempered. The letter he received at breakfast only served to worsen his foul mood.
“And you’re … okay with it?” Draco asked, feeling incredibly vulnerable. He hadn’t thought about how much Theo’s approval meant to him until that moment.
“Checking in on the both of you, of course! You storm out of the Task screeching in pain and about Portkeys, then Harry turns up covered in blood. You’ve been in here almost a whole day and we’ve gotten no word about the two of you at all. The other cowards didn’t have the balls to march in here, so here I am.” Pansy’s hands were on her hips as she chastised them.
“Mum would have liked you a lot. She would be proud of what you’re doing,” Luna said quietly and Draco busied himself with taking a bite of his food and not thinking too hard about her words. The last thing he wanted to do was get emotional in front of the entire Gryffindor house.
Draco shrugged, “It’s not always malicious. Why should I give someone else information they could use against me in the future, for free? Everything has a give and take. If I don’t give anything, I don’t have to worry about the take later on.”
A group of students about their age came into view, conversing quickly in what Harry figured was French.
Harry.” Draco’s voice broke slightly at that admission and he quickly cleared it and plowed on. He would not get emotional right now. “I'm not hiding from it all anymore. You have always been incredibly important to Harry, please don't make him choose between you or me. It'll only cause him pain. I swear here and now to do my best to keep things amiable between us if you will as well."
With that, Draco shoved past Weasel, casting a glance at Harry as he did. Harry seemed fine and the pain in Draco’s ribs was already starting to taper off. Draco was more worried about the unknown person who had cursed Harry in the middle of the class day.
Draco sighed, “Yeah, well there are a lot of things I wasn’t a fan of before and now I am. I’m relearning a lot, aren’t I?”
Draco packed everything away and pulled on his robe, slinging his bag over his shoulder. “Let’s go,” He said making his way towards the door.
I had not expected the absolute explosion of reactions last chapter. Seriously so many comments! I was definitely expecting more people to not like Hermione/Pansy/Ron so I was very happy to see such a positive reaction. There will be way more of then in the next installment. That I can promise. Of course, this will stay Drarry though. They are my main focus. We do get to see a little epiphany in Ron this chapter. When Hermione leaves him to go check on Pansy it's kind of thrown in his face that he needs to get his shit together or he's going to lose both of his best mates.
The parchment flooded with black lines and Harry flipped through the pages searching for Malfoy's name. Relief flooded his body when he noticed Malfoy wasn’t in the Slytherin Common Room. He continued searching and found his name in one of the dungeons close to Snape's classroom. He was alone.
The Weasley siblings were quite loud and boisterous as they ate. Draco could safely say he had never seen such a scene outside of a few glimpses at the Gryffindor table at Feasts.
I hope everyone is doing well, after this chapter posts I'll also be posting the Hermione POV of Hogsmeade because WE HIT 1K KUDOS AND THAT'S INSANE!!!! Thank you to everyone who reads this story, comments, kudos, subscribes, bookmarks. Yall make my days! Also fun personal fact, I got engaged this past weekend! My fiance does read this story, so a little shout out to him as well. He frequently sacrifices tv show watching time so that I can write this fic and reminds me what day of the week is so that I update on time (and makes fun of me when I'm late). Love you babe!
“Have fun with that,” Harry smiled softly at him, bending to kiss him briefly before making his way to the door.
Draco was at a loss of where to even begin. The top Harry was wearing was caked to his body, pressing into a cut on his arm that had bled all over him. He had dirt and grime covering everything else. Draco bent down and touched the side of Harry face and he visibly flinched away, Draco noticed tears tracking down his face.
“Of course, Potter saved the girl too. And fucking Weasley was the most important person to him? What a fucking poofter,” Blaise spit.
Hermione had gone running for Madam Pomfrey, she had quickly found them and levitated Draco off to the Hospital Wing. Which now left Harry trying to figure out how to break in without drawing attention to himself. Pomfrey had sent Parkinson and Nott back to their Common Room before they could even make it the entire way into the ward. Harry was terrified about what was going on with Draco and also worried that Pomfrey would contact Draco’s parents. Finally, throwing all caution to the wind, Harry pushed into the Hospital Wing.
“You should let us take you to the Hospital Wing,” Hermione moved closer to the couch, trying to get her thoughts back to the task at hand and not another one of the indescribable mysteries that popped up around Harry constantly.
“Thanks,” he said once he had finished the glass. His thigh still ached from the Stinging Hex, but his shoulder, back and forearm were beginning to stop twinging from the other times he had failed to dodge in time. Harry hoped they hadn’t hurt Draco too badly.
Draco leaned against a wall a corridor over from the Gryffindor Common Room and waited. He had written to Harry and he had let him know that the Weasley twins normally went down to the kitchens at about this time on Sundays, they would have to pass him to get there.
“I mean, I guess, but it was mostly about the fact that you’re a man. The only thing worse in my Father’s eyes than being with a muggle, is being with a man. I can’t produce an heir with a man. I’m the last Malfoy. I’m of no use to him if I can’t continue the line. Father knows that if I’m hiding something from him, that it means I’ve found an ‘unsuitable bond-mate’, otherwise I wouldn’t keep it from him.”
Draco stared at his Father, turning over the words inside his head. He was interrupted from responding as Hermione, Ginny Weasley, and Luna Lovegood entered the pub. His eyes narrowed; Hermione had known he was meeting his Father here. What was she doing?
Find out on Thursday (or whenever you happen to read the next chapter once it's updated) Thank you once again for the amazing feedback. Yall are the bright spots of my days!
Draco opened his mouth to reply, but was at a loss for words. Harry was staring at him like no one else ever had, eyes drifting from his eyes down towards his mouth. Draco slowly reached his hand up, fingers brushing across the top corner of Harry’s mark.
Draco finished rinsing the soap from Harry’s body and looked up at Harry, forcing a smile. “I owe you another apology, I’ve been keeping something from you. I was never quite sure how to bring it up after hiding it for so long. Then too much time had passed and I was afraid of how you would react. At fifteen I am old enough to take on the family name officially, which I did the moment I could. I’m sorry I kept it from you, it just never seemed like the right time.
“You’re still Harry,” Draco said and decided, fuck it. He grasped the collar of Harry’s shirt and tore it in two, pulling the two scraps of fabric off his chest. Draco had considered just vanishing the whole kit, but worried how Harry might react to anything but non-magical means right now. “See look,” Draco brushed his hand over Harry’s mark and felt comfort flow through the bond.
Severus pulled away and fixed him with a hard stare. “You acted like a true Malfoy man tonight, not like the man Lucius has become, things are only going to get harder from here. I cannot tell you what to do or how to handle yourself, but I implore you to do one thing.”
“I don’t know what would have happened if you weren’t there. I owe you an unending amount of gratitude.”
The knowledge didn’t help to make Draco feel any better. He just needed to see Harry for himself. What Weasley had said earlier was bothering him. Torture him? That better not mean what he thought it did. Draco noticed that Muggleborns and even some Halfbloods liked to exaggerate the use of the term ‘torture’. They’d describe something as mundane as a boring class, or extensive essay as ‘torture’. Like sitting in Binns’ class was anything close to having every single nerve ending in your body set alight in agony. Like writing three feet on Werewolves was anything close to feeling as though you were being stabbed by a million knives. But Weasley was a Pureblood, despite his Bloodtraitor status, Draco doubted he would use the word incorrectly. Draco sincerely hoped he was just spending too much time around Hermione and Thomas and used the term incorrectly. Draco thought back and couldn’t determine if the pain he had felt was anything similar to his experience with the Cruciatus.
Who guessed that Pansy would figure it out? I love everyone's guesses about Luna. We have a little bit of time until she enters our story, but rest assured it will be before Harry meets her in canon.
Draco took a deep breath, knowing what he was about to do would change everything. Although, after his behaviour during the Third Task he wouldn’t be surprised if everyone guessed anyways.
Draco found himself having a good time, but was happy to sneak looks at Harry whenever he could. At one point Parvati was trying to teach Harry how to dance what Draco guessed was a traditional Indian dance and Draco could feel nothing but unrelenting happiness and joy filtering through the bond. Draco had had to reel in his jealousy when he later caught Harry and the girl Weasley dancing, but he tried to have fun with his friends and not be preoccupied by Harry’s dance partners. At one point Harry had even grabbed Finnigan and spun him around the room a couple times (in what Draco suspected was a ‘fuck you’ to anyone that thought that Harry only wanted to dance with girls) and Draco had done the same to Blaise, insisting they could not let the Gryffindors think they were better than them.
“Like you care? Move!” Theo ordered and Draco felt himself being dragged away. Wait no, Harry was the other way, why were they taking Draco away from him? He moved to try and make it back towards Harry and felt a sharp pain in his cheek. His face was extra cold. Why was Harry so tall? Oh, Draco realized he was on the floor. Why was he on the floor?
Draco was gratified to see a small smile on Harry’s face at the little exchange. If that’s all it took to bring Harry out of his dark thoughts, it looked like Draco was going to be going out of his way to be nice to Weasley. Anything to stop the heavy swirl of despair that had been leaking through the bond.
“Take your glasses off if you’re going to do that, you’ll injure your face,” Draco chastised and Harry chuckled wetly. “Oh don’t cry over me, you sap, I’m fine. Don’t get your knickers in a twist.”
“Hi, guys,” Harry smiled at his two best mates, but ached for the warmth slowly fading with distance.
Also for all you Brits out there, I truly hope I'm doing okay with my masquerade as someone who actually lives in Britain. I am regrettably, American, just trying to sound British in my writing. Feel free to let me know if I make any glaring errors. I welcome Brit-picking. Although I have definitely read some Hunger Games fics written by British people and the errors never really bother me so maybe I'm being overly self-conscious. It's been known to happen.
Deep down Draco knew that would never be the case. Maybe if Harry had someone advocating for him. Maybe if his parents were still alive.
Draco signed off with a small sun drawing and was gratified to see a small moon pop up before he closed his journal.
Draco had never been one to manually change in front of his roommates, normally preferring to spell his clothes on, for proprietary’s sake, but he didn’t imagine Harry would change with magic. He absolutely could not allow for Weasley to see the mark. Draco knew Weasley would not rest before finding out who Harry’s soul-mate was, and he was sure to know the significance of how large their marks were. It would only be a matter of time before Weasley would figure out that Draco was Harry’s soul-mate.
“What? Am I the only one that finds the image of Malfoy giving the Dursleys hell hilarious? They’re fucking awful! Imagine the Ton-Tongue Toffee, but better!”
Harry laughed again and swatted at him lightly, “I’ll cry if I want to. Hermione says it’s important to release your feelings when you have them.”
“You’re right. I just wasn’t sure if you really wanted to. If we really wanted to keep hiding it, I’m sure we could figure out a way.”
“Yes, that will have to do,” Draco shot them an appreciative smile. He had not expected the twins to warm up to him so quickly, but Draco was noticing they seemed very black and white on their ideals.
He had called Granger a Mudblood in Potions class. He knew how much it bothered her and Harry, but his friends had began harassing him out about it. They had been teasing him that he had an infatuation with muggles now, since he had cleaned up his vocabulary. As much as he knew Harry would be upset, he needed to do what had been done. There was no way it could get back to his Father that there was anything suspicious going on. His Father asked him every letter if he had found his soul-mate, reiterating how important it was to find a suitable bond-mate, like Draco could fucking control it.
“Name your price. Free-reign on the prank, just nothing permanently damaging, and if you could avoid fallout to the rest of my house, I’ll pay higher. I also require your discretion. The whole point is that this does not lead back to me in any way.”
“Surprised they didn’t pin it on you, you said you were out on the grounds last night?” Blaise asked.
“You’re saying you fought the massive snake that had been petrifying people and it bit you when you did? How the fuck didn’t you die?” Draco asked.
Harry still had the bottle-cap Portkey. He hadn’t needed to use it once he got his wand back and was with Mr. Weasley. He figured it’s always useful to have a Portkey, although he wasn’t sure how long the charm would last on the bottle cap. He tucked it safely inside a pair of socks and pushed it into a corner of his trunk. They were packing; tomorrow they would get back onto the Hogwarts Express. Thankfully, Ron had yet to ask why Harry was suddenly particular about getting changed in the loo. Harry figured that wouldn’t last for forever, but he would take whatever he could get right now. The last thing he needed was the entire Weasley family interrogating him about his soul-mark. At least at school he only had to deal with four Weasleys and Hermione.
Harry sighed, “I was worried about that. Let’s get going, I promised Draco I would be back. He isn’t completely well yet.”
“No peeking,” Harry reminded him and Draco heard him hop down from the table. There was a quiet rustling and then silence. “Okay, you can open them,” Harry whispered.
That was painful to write. Poor Harry. We also get a look into Theo's mind which was actually super fun to write. Next chapter is one of my favorites so far. We get to see Draco again, it has been far too long for my tastes since we've been in Draco's head. We're skipping time a little, which means we're getting quite close to the end *gasp*
Draco looked hard into the Headmaster’s eyes, briefly glancing at the curtain before bringing his eyes back to Dumbledore’s icy blue ones. “Yes, I determined protecting myself and those I care about as a top priority.”
“Sure, sure,” Draco waved his hand placatingly. Thankfully Madam Pomfrey was ready with more potion and before long Harry had drifted off again.
He was more excited about the unveiling of the Goblet of Fire; his Father had said you could feel the magic coming off of it when you got close enough. Draco had to respect any artefact that powerful.
Draco could not find himself to be all that excited about the other schools coming to Hogwarts. His parents had made him visit both schools before he started at Hogwarts. Durmstrang was full of a bunch of surly, fur-covered Northern Europeans, and Beauxbatons was a bunch of stuck up Frenchmen. At least Beauxbatons had decent weather, but his Mother had thrown a fit about Draco going anywhere but Hogwarts, in the end. Draco did wonder what theatrics both schools would put on for their arrivals, they were sure to show off a bit.
Draco did his best to not let the pain get to him, perhaps Harry’s training had just gone a little more intense than expected. That happened from time to time. Draco tried to drift back into the conversation around him, feeling only the muted feeling coming through the bond.
Harry was silent, not sure of what to say. He was still trying to come to terms with what had happened. That he had almost lost Draco just because they had a fight.
“I’ve said before that I’ve known so I was about 9 or 10, but I suspected before that. I just sort of realized that I was around all of these girls at the balls my mother would throw, and on the beaches in France, and I never felt the feelings Blaise and Theo were feeling. Even Vince and Greg would go on and on about girls, and I just never saw it. Instead I was looking at the men in their dress robes, or tanning on the beach. Father took me to a Harpies match and even got us into the locker room and it was just eh. I basically succumbed myself to marrying for duty until I felt your mark sear my chest. I didn’t think I would ever bond with someone romantically.”
Draco noticed Harry had been becoming more and more jaded towards the Headmaster. No doubt aided by Draco’s open distrust towards the man, and surprisingly, Harry had told Draco how often Sirius ranted about the Headmaster. Draco had even read a few letters where Sirius was none too kind towards the old man. Draco felt sort of bad, but at the same time, Harry was right to be wary. The shady things Dumbledore did were just beginning to add up more and more.
Thanks for tuning in and reading the first chapter of my first Drarry fic. I have a lot written so I promise to update frequently. This is like, the opposite of slowburn, just FYI. As I said before, this loosely follows the books with tons of divergence after the fourth book. I unfortunately lost my copies so dialogue will not be identical, hopefully that's a positive thing. Very little angst, if you're looking for that, sorry. A bunch of boys trying to figure out their feelings. Also, Draco curses a lot (I kinda see it as his way of rebelling and seeming 'adult'). I'm eager to hear what you think!
Harry smirked, thoughts of DADA completely washed from his brain, he reached up knocking Malfoy’s hands from his chest and flipped them around so Malfoy was pinned against the tree. “Maybe.”
Hermione seemed to realize that Draco wasn’t currently able to form words and shifted her focus to Harry, “Now to the more pressing things. What did Charlie say, exactly? I need every detail if we’re going to figure this out.”
“We can be grosser,” He informed her smacking loud kisses all over Harry’s face. Harry swatted at him, laughing.
Harry’s vision cleared and he realized his glasses must have cracked when his face collided with the ground minutes before. Theodore Nott stood over him, fear painting every inch of his face.
"My apologies, could you dry me?" Draco asked, Hermione nodded, pulling out her wand and pointing it at his head. A warm blast of air fired out and he felt his hair dry. Draco ran a hand through it, trying to smush it down, "My hair must be an awful sight."
“Yes, well maybe he should be a little more worried about you, and less worried about the shitty muggles. Also, I’d like to make it clear not all muggles are shitty, just Harry’s extended family.”
Harry blushed, breaking eye contact. He wasn’t about to tell Malfoy how he had previously broken ribs, his mind flashing briefly to Uncle Vernon.
“Why can’t I ever have anything fucking nice? The second Sirius steps into my life, he has to live on the run! My first mostly relaxing year, and I get signed into a death tournament! I find my goddamned soul-mate, and of course I can’t have him. I’m so fucking done.”
“Yes, but our souls weren’t quite ready yet. I had hoped they would be by my birthday and sure enough they were! I’m so glad,” Luna gripped her hand tightly and turned towards the table, fixing herself breakfast.
Harry whipped around; he had taken to facing away from the Slytherin table, temptation and all that. Parkinson was practically in Draco’s lap, giggling loudly, and his arm was around her as they ate their breakfast. Harry immediately felt a stab of pain in his chest, had Draco been that ashamed about what they did? Draco’s eyes cut across the Hall to focus on him, narrowing slightly; his hand drifted slowly up to press against the junction between his shoulder and neck, and then brushed his chest. Even through the fabric, Harry could feel the warmth as it blossomed on his chest; he had also felt the ache in his shoulder as Draco had pressed on the bruises.  Their bond was getting much stronger.
Draco rolled his eyes, “Not much. She apologized on Lucius’ behalf, saying ‘his frustration got away from him’. He hadn’t meant to hurt me the way he did. She can’t accept that her perfect husband isn’t so perfect. I’m going to ask her if he also hadn’t meant to cast the Cruciatus on me from the time I could ride a broom. I’m debating whether I should attach the memories with my letter so she can watch them in our Pensieve, or if she’ll just explain away those as well.”
Hermione bit her lip, but got to her feet. “If you aren’t back in an hour, I’ll come find you. Loudly,” She warned and he almost smiled. Damn Gryffindors.
Draco smirked, falling back onto the couch, letting Harry gently press the ice to his face. “I’m a betting man, but I’m not sure I would have taken the odds.”
Harry stepped into the loo, carefully closing the door and immediately felt a hand over his mouth again. Harry rolled his eyes as he was pinned against the wall.
“It’s just the timing, it makes sense. The first time I met with Harry when I came back he was in this massive hurry to get back to the village. He was acting oddly too, agitated and anxious.”
“I can’t forget what has been drilled into me for 14 years, overnight. I’m trying, okay? I’m deeply sorry. Would it make a difference to you if I apologized to her? I will, if that’s what it takes to show you I’m seriously trying.” Draco stared at Harry as his eyes bulged.
Lucius should not be in his study; Mother’s letter had specifically said he had a meeting at the Nott’s and Theo had confirmed.
“You’re not mad at me, right?” Harry finally asked, his voice hesitant. Draco whipped around to face him fully, brow furrowed.
“I did, I had to send about a million and a half letters out to put a stop to that awful Skeeter woman.”
Harry startled awake, the sudden brightness disorienting him. He sat up, panic and confusion filling his body. Harry quickly realized he was in the Hospital Wing, the memories of the night before flooding his mind. He had apparently fallen asleep with his hand plastered to Draco’s chest. Draco was still asleep, although he looked loads better than last night. They were surrounded by the curtain Madam Pomfrey had put up. Harry listened carefully and could hear nothing but Draco’s steady breathing coming from the Wing. Harry stood up but the moment he did he heard a door open and the sound of footsteps approaching.
“Never,” Draco said his eyes landing on Weasley as he helped Harry to the washroom. Draco half supported and half carried him out of the room and heard Weasley’s voice carry to him as he shut the door.
Draco laughed despite himself, “You think he wouldn’t have come here to curse the gay out of me if he did? Lucius does not, no.”
“What do you need?” Draco asked, looking up, his eyes locked with Harry’s green ones. Harry didn’t say anything at first, and Draco grasped one of his hands, the one not completely covered in blood, in his. “Do you want to get washed up?” Draco had caught onto an underlying feeling of revulsion running through the bond. Harry nodded his head mechanically and Draco looked to Madam Pomfrey. He realized that every pair of eyes including those of a black dog that could only be Sirius were still fixed upon him. Belatedly, he also realized Weasley had his wand pointed at him, although Hermione was doing a good job of forcing his arm towards the floor. Now Weasley just seemed confused more than anything else.
“Yeah, well, I’m sure you have a bunch more,” Harry shrugged, grinning down at him. It took him a moment for him to fully realize their positions before he quickly scrambled off, standing up and shaking his hair out. Sand flew in every direction and Malfoy made a noise of complaint, getting to his feet as well.
“We’ve got to get out of here,” Harry said as he struggled to get his feet under him, it didn’t seem that Ron noticed how quickly he was pulling the two of them behind him.
Harry made it halfway around the lake when he finally sat down. The sky was clear for once and the cool breeze was a nice refresher. Harry watched as a tentacle shot out of the water and snatched a bird that had been flying overhead. He was distracted from that completely bizarre display by a mix of anxiety and annoyance becoming apparent inside him. Harry smirked, realizing how frustrating it must be to try and track someone down without a magical map to do so.
“Yes, and thankfully I have found my soul-mate and was able to be approved by my family’s artifact. I head the Malfoy family. I doubt Lucius has realized what I have done, but that’s his problem not mine. I am technically a legal adult. I no longer have the Trace on me. I do not make idle threats, now if we have quite finished with interrogating my personal life; I’d like to see how Harry is doing. How are you feeling?” Draco asked turning around and smiling at Harry. Harry had woken up almost immediately upon the Minister entering the room, Draco had felt the abrupt shift but had figured putting the Minister in his place was more important at the present moment.
Pansy was wearing pink robes, with eye shadow and lip-gloss to match. The cut of the robes definitely flattered her figure more so than their school uniform.
“Yeah well, I’ll make you read about Muggles! I guess I shouldn’t be surprised, everything else in the fairytales growing up are real, mermaids aren’t that far off.”
“Welsh Green, Chinese Fireball, Swedish Short-Snout, and a Hungarian Horntail,” Draco said immediately, ignoring Harry’s jab.
Draco reached up and slowly unbuttoned the top of Harry’s shirt, “No one should be outted, regardless of what they’d be outted for.”
Draco was briefly hurt that Harry had so little faith in him, but pushed it down, it’s not like he didn’t deserve it, “I’m not an idiot, I know you didn’t do it.”
“Morsmordre!”A deep voice echoed loudly from their right and then a bright green light lit up the sky above them, similarly to a firework. Harry had been trying to get the group away from the campground, while simultaneously trying to find the twins and Ginny for a few minutes now. He didn’t know how to introduce the fact that he had a Portkey in his hand, without everyone being incredibly suspicious.
“Lucius has always made it clear that he would join Voldemort when he returned. I have no intention of serving any master.” Or a master that murdered children, Draco thought to himself, but Draco decided he probably shouldn’t reference anything that happened tonight if he could help it. “I had hoped to see my mother again this summer, but it is evident he has made his decision clear.”
,” Draco said simply and Harry stared at him. Draco rubbed his face with his hands, “You’ve never done that.”
“Hogwarts: Potion Master’s quarters,” He pronounced clearly. With a whirl he was back at the Castle. He could barely believe it had worked.
“Ow, fuck.” Draco cursed, collapsing down onto the bench beneath him. The pain intensified before he felt a different pain in his ankle.
Draco dimly noticed loud whistles, and cat-calls. Then a few moments later there was a loud throat clearing and Harry pulled away.
“You’ll have to get an egg; it’s the only thing that makes sense. They’ll all be equally vicious about their eggs; their temperament will have nothing to do with it.” Hermione said and Harry felt his heart sink even further. This was going to be impossible, despite his feelings, both Draco and Hermione looked almost relieved.
Draco felt a stab of anger pulse through and realized Harry had arrived to breakfast. Draco steadfastly kept himself from shooting a glance his way. He knew seeing the injury would upset his soul-mate, but it was a necessary evil.
“That’s a good thing, keep practicing summoning and transfiguring in your own time,” Sirius reminded him.
Ron frowned, “Unless he tortured and murdered a cat or something, I don’t quite think his dad should have done that.”
Harry laughed, pulling his face from Draco’s shoulder, where his face was indeed wet. “I’ll cry if I want to. Hermione says it’s important to release your feelings when you have them.”
Pansy glanced around once more and began to spell cosier decorations. “How have you not transfigured a fucking couch? Do you enjoy rolling around on the floor?”
“You’re practically tan compared to last night,” Harry remarked, poking Draco’s arm. He pulled it away, pure indignation on his face.
Harry stuck his tongue out at him, and suddenly Draco was gripped with a feeling of pure terror. “Where did you get this?! Who else has this kind of information? We are utterly fucked!”
Harry rolled his eyes, and shoved Malfoy’s shoulder with his own. He smirked over at him in what Harry could only describe as fondness. It was an odd, but welcome look on Malfoy’s face.
“I felt it, you got to the Merpeople way before you came up. Why did you stay behind? You could have fucking drowned!  And don’t you dare say that you were fine. I felt when you stopped being able to breathe. Felt it again and again in my nightmares last night. Do you have any idea what it was like to be standing there, seeing all the other champions and literally feeling you suffocating? Feeling you fucking drown.”
“We are!” Ron and Harry called back, hastily throwing more things into their respective trunks. They might have already told Mrs. Weasley that most of their packing was done, when it definitely just started ten minutes prior.
“See, it’s still there. You’re safe. You’re here. We’ll get through this,” Draco did his best to quickly clean Harry off as well as he could. He was soaked from head to toe where he stood under the spray trying to get Harry clean.
Then they had dueled and Draco had tried to hit Weasley for how much of a prat he was being towards Harry, but their spells had ricocheted and Granger had been hit instead. Draco had wished Harry’s spell had hit him instead of Goyle, but that was beside the point. Draco was sending every type of apologetic and regret-like feeling he could through the bond.
"We will not hold Draco's family's feud with us against him. He has apparently somehow taken on the Head of his family and apologized to us. From now on the Weasleys are not feuding with Draco. You may hold Draco's actions solely against him, but not his father's. I accepted his apology and made it binding. You felt the magical agreement settle. I have not taught you the Pureblood customs, and I do not regret doing so, but Draco has been trained.
Draco nodded along to the words, happy that he wouldn’t be forced away. “Thank you, Madam, I cannot adequately express my gratitude.”
“So the two of you share pain and emotions? Blimey…” Weasley trailed off, a new kind of respect in his eyes as he glanced at Draco.
Draco’s interest was piqued when none other than Viktor Krum came lumbering up behind Karkaroff. Draco looked at the Durmstrang headmaster with disdain, Karkaroff was not a name his Father said with fondness. Draco hadn’t realized how young the Bulgarian seeker was, but it made sense that he would come to compete. Draco would bet his broomstick that he would be the champion for Durmstrang. One did not become an international Quidditch seeker being a couple cards short of an Exploding Snap deck.
Hermione strode out of the pub again and looked both ways down the street. She made her way towards the far end of the street. Harry had said he was supposed to meet Sirius past the end of the village. Hermione worked to control her pace; she couldn’t be sprinting up to Harry like there were something wrong. How was she going to be able to get Ron away from Harry? She had just passed the Post Office when she saw Harry duck past Dervish and Bangs.
Harry let out a breath, “It’s fine. It’s just a rough subject. Anyways, we have to get you back to your Common Room. We’ll both fit under the cloak, but you’ll have to stick close to me. And be silent, the cloak doesn’t cover any noise.”
“Yeah my conclusion is a little shoddy, as well,” Hermione called over her shoulder, smiling at the two of them as she left the room. “See you later, Harry!”
Harry laughed, amused by how put out Malfoy was, “Surprisingly, yes. Don’t look so miserable, you can’t say you didn’t have fun.”
Poor Harry doesn't even know what bisexual is. Don't worry Hermione will enlighten him. We're getting super close to the Yule Ball, either next chapter or the following! Thank you so much for everything, life has been getting crazier and crazier and yall definitely help break the stress up. Hope you like this, have a great week!
“Do you have any idea how you make me feel?” Draco breathed, moving upwards to kiss and nip at Harry’s neck. “How much I want to mark your skin here so that everyone can see that you’re mine? How I wish our marks were somewhere harder to hide so that everyone would know that I am yours, and you are mine? How I want to shoot curses from across the Hall when I see Ginny Weasley touching your arm, entertaining the thought that you could be hers? Every day since we’ve kissed I’ve almost written a letter to my Father telling him to fuck right off. It physically pains me to not be able to proudly escort you to the Ball, even the thought of seeing you there with someone else makes me want to skip the thing entirely. You drive me absolutely insane.” He moved his lips to Harry’s, kissing him until he was gasping again.
“Oh no! Those are really nice ones too; do you want us to come with you?” Ginny asked and Hermione shook her head.
He finished unwrapping his gifts and made an excuse to close the hangings on his bed in order to write a letter to his parents to thank them for his presents and wish them a Merry Christmas. Draco pulled out the twin journal to Harry’s and opened it. Nothing had been written yet, but Draco normally woke up quite early on Christmas and wouldn’t be surprised if Harry was still unwrapping gifts.
The world spun until Draco carefully stepped out of the fireplace and into his childhood bedroom. The room was exactly as he had left it nine months ago. Draco felt like the person that had left this room was a completely different one that stepped into it today. He felt like he barely recognized the room now. Draco sighed; this was not the time to be sentimental. He tossed Harry’s Cloak over his head and carefully left the room. He doubted he’d run into anyone in his Wing of the Manor, but better safe than sorry.
“First things first, If I were going to curse Potter, I would have waited until we’re inside, I assure you. And I wouldn’t have only cursed him; I’d have cursed all three of you. Secondly, unless you don’t understand basic physics, which come to think of it you probably don’t, the curse obviously came from over there. If any of us had cast it he would have been blasted forward not to the side. ” Draco gestured towards the forest.
It was another tense few minutes of Pomfrey moving her wand and muttering spells so quickly he couldn’t keep track, before finally she exhaled a breath and stopped casting. Harry had steadily felt the pain in his chest abating and it was at a minor throbbing now, he also noticed his hand no longer felt submerged in fire. Touching Draco’s mark had returned to how it normally felt, comforting warmth.
“Yes! That’s what Charlie said! How did you know that?” Harry asked and was gratified to see Draco blush.
So I meant to post this the other day but decided to completely rewrite the whole thing. I've felt like the last couple chapters haven't been up to my standards. They haven't felt like me. I rewrote this chapter and now I finally feel like my writing is back to normal. I sincerely hope you enjoy this one, and it's long. The original was almost 1k shorter but I'm so happy with where the words led me.
Draco woke up to the sounds of his housemates screaming ‘Merry Christmas’ at him through the curtains, and ripping paper echoing around the room. Draco rubbed the sleep from his eyes, smiling at the modest pile of gifts at the foot of his bed. Draco touched his mark to send Harry a ‘Merry Christmas’ before buttoning up his shirt and opening the hangings on his bed.
Theo reached his arms to the sky in an exaggerated stretch, “Gryffindor of course, fucking Scarhead got himself into the Hospital Wing just now. He wouldn’t stop crying about it. The only thing that saved me was Snape, he was looking for you, Draco.”
“Something else has been bothering you. I’ve felt it the past few days and thought it was the Task, but it’s something else isn’t it?”
“I’ve got 10 galleons on Krum being the Durmstrang champion,” Draco says to Blaise, who rolls his eyes.
“Awh Dray,” Pansy giggled turning to wrap her arms around his neck. “Careful there or we might have to leave the Common Room.” She teased and Draco tried to look appropriately chastised. Ignoring her use of that terrible nickname.
“Is it always like this?” Draco whispered to Harry who was now sitting all of the way up, propped up by a mountain of pillows. Harry smiled for real this time and nodded.
“Moody demonstrated the Unforgiveables,” Harry threw another flurry of stones into the lake, before ripping at some roots that were buried next to him. He heard Malfoy inhale quickly.
“What did your Mum say?” Harry asked, peeking over Draco’s shoulder as he crumpled up the letter he had been reading.
Today he had seen both sides of his life collide in stark contrast. The life he grew up with, pomp and circumstance and duty. Never being good enough for his father. The pain he was forced to endure to remind him of who was in charge. Hatred and anger and the thirst for power.
“What were you even doing last night, Harry, you didn’t get back until so late,” Ron asked and Harry made a point of taking a massive bite of his breakfast sandwich, chewing meticulously.
“Not at all,” Draco plopped back down onto the chair he had taken residence in. “I’m just happy to see you awake again.”
“He does that,” He cackled and Hermione looked between the two of them rapidly. This had happened more than once?
“Well let’s try it,” Harry said getting to his feet from where he had been sprawled out on the floor of their usual classroom. He crossed the room to the window and stuck his arm out of it. Snow had been falling off and on for the past week and a cold wind pushed through the open window.
“Is that a student!?” McGonagall gasped before pointing her wand at the ferret. “We do not use Transfiguration as a form of punishment! Mr. Malfoy are you all right?”
Ginny and Luna were already staring at each other again, “Yeah, no problem, Hermione. Catch up with you later!”
"No, it isn’t. But this is much worse than a stupid bruise. I bet you broke a couple ribs. Those are absolutely awful to heal. This potion better be good."
The halls were relatively empty with it being so close to curfew, Harry made his way from Gryffindor Tower to the dungeons, checking the map along the way to make sure he didn’t run into anyone and that Malfoy hadn’t returned to his Common Room.
“We’re here to make your day, young Harry,” Fred nodded at George who held out a small, round, red-coloured candy.
“Most of them, before Hogwarts we were to study the family histories, languages, and beginner magical theory. I would sometimes borrow my mother’s wand to practice, but I wasn’t allowed to do that too often. Severus would also teach me potions and herbology, but he wouldn’t do that for anyone else.”
“What do you want, Malfoy?” The one on the right said. Draco noticed both of their glances kept straying to his eye. Draco squinted his eye slightly, playing up the pain there. If he could use this for pity from the bleeding-heart Gryffindors, he would.
Malfoy stared at him, eyes wild, “You solved the Dementor issue?” He asked like Harry had said something completely insane.
After a few moments of silence punctured by Malfoy’s ragged breathing, he straightened up slightly, not moving away from Harry’s hand. “Is this, er, helping? It’s what Hermione likes when she’s sick...”
“No offense to her, but the surplus of people our age is kind of a huge positive. I don’t really miss the plethora of men the same age as my grandfather staring at my arse.”
Harry couldn’t think of a single thing to say, and winced as he was shoved forward again by the Weasley siblings.
A few strands of Malfoy’s hair felt into his eyes, he impatiently shook them out of his face. Harry felt Malfoy’s leg hook behind his and suddenly they were falling backward, with a soft ‘oomph’ Harry’s back collided with the sand. Malfoy loomed over him pinning his wrists on either side of Harry’s head. Now that wouldn’t do, Harry rolled and he and Malfoy wrestled in the sand for a few minutes, neither letting the other one win.
“I did have a good time, thank you for asking Ron. It was really nice for all of the schools to get together like that. If I’m being honest, I didn’t think anyone would believe me if I did say.”
“So, you’re saying there are Dementors that work for the ministry and do not listen to the word of the Minister? How very disheartening,” Draco sneered.
Dumbledore inclined his head and then left the Ward without a second glance. Draco set his head back against the pillow, grasping harder at his Mark, desperate to feel anything at this point. Harry was only a pace or two away, but Draco had never felt further. Draco was shocked to feel tears pricking at the corners of his eyes. He quickly blinked them away, he could not afford to break down right now. Harry was okay. Pomfrey had been in her office for quite a bit of time, she wouldn’t have left him alone if he weren’t stable. Dumbledore wouldn’t have left.
Draco demolished another desk and took a deep breath. Now was not the time for that. He had to steady himself. His soul-mate needed him. Draco repaired the two desks and sat down on top of one; he took deep breaths and cleared his mind like Severus had taught him. He tried to send soothing and calming feelings through the bond, and then he waited. He distracted himself by banishing the dust from the room and practiced summoning pillows for lack of anything else productive to do.
Harry laughed, “I’ve never really had a favourite to be completely honest. I like a lot of colours. I like red because it means Gryffindor or the Weasleys. I like blue because it’s usually the colour of the sky when the weather is perfect. Green is the colour of the Quidditch pitch, or a certain someone’s tie. Gold is the snitch. Silver is my Patronus, or your eyes when you look at me when we’re alone.”
“Yeah, so Draco and I are soul-mates. Since the World Cup. Be nice to him,” Harry stated casually as he began loading up his plate.
Next chapter is the Triwizard champion announcement! Prepare yourselves!  Things pick up a tad more here going out so buckle on in! Have a great weekend!
“Nah, green’s just my colour,” Seamus laughed and the bright colours of his soul mark glinted from his throat. Various shades of blue coalesced into a crashing wave. Opposite him, in the same exact location, Dean had swirls of flames, shades of red and orange that still stuck out in clear contrast to his dark skin. “You best be buying your souvenirs and getting back, everyone is going to start making their way to their seats soon I’d expect.”
Draco had never felt the immeasurable feelings bubbling in side of him, like the minutes before a Quidditch match but multiplied by fifty, he felt his tongue dart out to moisten his lips before he pulled his hands from Harry’s and settled them on his hips instead. He walked Harry backward until Harry’s back thudded against the wall, his eyes darted from Harry’s green ones, down to his lips, and then Draco was on him.
Harry sighed; he hadn’t thought of how much harder this would all be for Draco. No one really truly questioned Harry, they might be curious or suspicious he was up to something, but in the end Harry knew everything would be fine if his friends found out about Draco. Draco did not have that same luxury. That didn’t mean he could just forgive Draco for calling Hermione that awful slur. He had been called enough slurs growing up in his Aunt and Uncle’s house for something he couldn’t control; he couldn’t just let Draco get away with it just because things were tough.
Draco pulled his cloak tighter around his shoulders, ducking his chin against the cold wind. They were making their way inside after finishing Care of Magical Creatures class. Not for the first time Draco wished he was walking next to Harry who was a couple paces ahead of him, leaning into Hermione. This time it was solely for the reason that Hermione had conjured some of her trademark blue flames and was holding it in a jar, keeping the trio warm. Draco wished he could do the same, but Hermione was known for the flames. Maybe if he could manage to make them green...
“Wormtail is Pettigrew. He betrayed my parents to Voldemort. He’s the reason they’re dead. He pinned it on Sirius and made him rot in Azkaban for 12 years. Sirius was angry, but Wormtail is the one that blew up the street.”
Draco couldn’t have that; he grasped either side of the open collar of Harry’s shirt and hauled him in closer. “You’re cute too,” Draco whispered into Harry’s ear before pulling away.
“Sorry your chest is a little moist, here,” Draco whispered a soft incantation and Harry felt a rush of hot air hit his chest. “I got a little weepy last night, no worries, all is well.” Draco was silent for a moment and the hand in his hair disappeared and grasped his hand tightly. “I love you, Harry,” His lips moved against the back of his hand as they formed the words, then they pressed against it in a brief kiss. Harry found himself able to squeeze Draco’s fingers back, a few moments later he blinked his eyes open, squinting into the light. Draco’s blurry blond head loomed over him.
Draco froze, his mind now flashing through a number of afternoons in Father’s study. His normal lie sprung to his tongue, but he swallowed it down. He had promised candour, and he couldn’t just lie after Harry had been honest with him.
“It wasn’t about being a fucking hero! It was the fact that a little girl was tied to that goddamn statue and no one was coming to get her! No one was coming to save her! I wasn’t leaving her there!”
Draco hurried back to the Hospital Wing and walked in on Mrs. Weasley tightly holding Harry in a hug. They were interrupted by a loud bang as Hermione slammed something over near the window.
“So you saw it too?” Remus asked after they finished putting the Shack back together and Sirius nodded.
“It seems that Mr. Potter was accosted by some older students from another school, they seemed to not believe he deserved to be a Champion and intended on incapacitating him. One of them successfully performed the Cruciatus Curse on Mr. Potter for an undetermined amount of time. I do not believe he was placed under the curse for long.”
“Yeah, sure mate, I’ll have everything set up.” Ron was exchanging worried glances with Hermione, Harry ignored them and grabbed his things, quickly leaving the Hall.
Harry shrugged, “I don’t want to take this chance away from her. I wish Ron would grow a pair and ask her. I know he wants to. Maybe I’ll just take Ginny, she can’t go otherwise.”  Draco’s fingers stilled.
“Do you need anything?  We could stop by the Hospital Wing before class,” Ron questioned, instantly concerned. Harry could feel jealousy flowing through the bond, he assumed due to the fact that Ginny’s hand was still on his arm. He made a point of reaching for his cup with that hand and Ginny pulled away and began fixing her meal.
Draco suspected he was commenting on the overwhelming urge to grab onto Harry and never let go. It was like every fibre of his being was screaming at him to never ever get further than three inches from the wizard. Draco couldn’t wrap his mind around the fact that he had gone from absolutely loathing the sight of Potter to being wrapped up in his arms and loving every second; although if Draco was truthful with himself he had never truly loathed Harry, not really.
Draco obeyed without a sound; he stared at Harry, eyebrows furrowed. Harry carefully unbuttoned the rest of Draco’s shirt and let it fall open, putting Draco’s entire mark on display. Harry bent down and brought his lips to Draco’s mark, kissing it a few times before lightly sucking on it. Immediately, Draco gasped, arching against Harry and squirming uncontrollably. Harry pulled away, smirking. Draco was still trying to catch his breath; he stared up at Harry, pupils blown wide. He narrowed his eyes at Harry before surging upwards and reversing their positions. Draco tore his shirt apart, revealing his mark, and brought his mouth to Harry’s chest.
“Lovely!” Luna said, a bright smile crossing her face, almost seeming like it twinkled to Harry. Luna reached forward and gently took Ginny’s hand, looking straight into Ginny’s eyes as she did. Ginny gasped loudly and Harry watched as colour blossomed across the back of Ginny’s hand and presumably continued up her arm which was covered in her sweater.
His shoulder hadn’t hurt since the day of the task, but he could milk it for a bit, he was just thankful it had been on his right shoulder so Pomfrey could treat it without the whole tent seeing his Mark. The last thing he had needed was Skeeter catching a picture of that.
Draco threw open the doors to the Hospital Wing feeling everyone’s eyes slide to him, but his eyes were only for one person. Harry was sitting on the edge of a bed, completely covered head to toe in blood and muck. His gaze locked on the floor. He looked utterly exhausted and all Draco could feel besides that was pain and overwhelming sadness leaking through their bond.
“And casting foolish curses and belittling Muggleborns accomplishes that? Pansy isn’t my soul-mate, she’s just someone to pass the time,” Draco said flippantly, slightly pleased by the shade of red Father turned at his use of the word Muggleborn and his tone. He had entertained the thought of taking Hermione’s wishes to heart, but had decided against it. He was leaving it all on the table today. He was over being constantly anxious.
Draco sighed, “I know, I know. I haven’t cursed him in, like, weeks. That should count for something.”
He got a few paces away without saying anything and then turned to look Harry in the eyes. Nott raised his eyebrows and looked at him meaningfully before biting his lip, “You know why.”
“I will not! The boy is 14 – ” Madam Pomfrey cut herself off at the sight of Draco limping towards them. Her eyes quickly slid to the curtains then back to Draco, “What can I help you with, Mr. Malfoy?”
“Thank you, Draco, you look fantastic as always. This Ball reminds me of the Balls your mother would host.”
So I'm freaking out a bit because I finally linked some scenes that I had written way back in the summer for the end of this story, with what I have currently. Outside of a few scenes here and there I have officially finished writing this story! I'm going to estimate that we have maybe five to ten chapters left, leaning closer to five (not including this one). It's insane! I cannot believe how far we've come.
“Isn’t her sister, like, not even school aged? I saw her arrive yesterday,” Pansy asked, her face pinched.
The bond also seemed to happen after both parties turned thirteen, and it happened the first time the bond mates touched skin to skin. It would make sense that it took almost a full year after Harry turned thirteen for his bond to realize, since he wasn’t exactly going out of his way to hold hands with Malfoy. Looking back he almost laughed thinking of a comment Ron had made the previous school year. After Hermione had slugged Malfoy in the face, Ron had said that thankfully she knew they weren’t soul-mates.
“Harry did you just perform wandless magic?” Hermione couldn’t keep herself from practically shouting. He hadn’t been holding a wand, he hadn’t even said a spell!
Draco had expected as much, but hadn’t prepared himself for how upset Harry’s word would make him. How could anyone lay their hands on a child and believe it to be okay? Draco carefully returned to carding his fingers through Harry’s hair again.
Harry sighed, that was a worry for another time. His first order of business was to get some privacy to look at his bond mark in the first place. Maybe he was imagining this whole thing. Malfoy probably wasn’t even his soul-mate.
Draco internally winced when the words came out of his mouth. Why had he thought that was such a brilliant lie moments before? They weren’t even playing Quidditch right now. Thankfully no one called him out on his lie.
Draco straightened, feeling decidedly lightheaded, and retraced his steps to his bedroom. His mother’s music reached him as he climbed the steps, and Draco couldn’t suppress a smile. For the second time, Draco wished he could go see her. Now that his mission was fulfilled, he could, but he worried what might happen to her if Lucius found out she had known about what Draco had done.
Draco didn’t know what to do to make Harry let him explain himself. He had gone to the classroom as often as he could get away with, he had sent feelings, he had even owled him a note but watched Harry set it on fire without opening it. Nothing was working. Draco felt like he was slowly dying, Pansy was beside herself with worry for him, and had even announced the night before that he was running a fever. His chest had begun to ache and it beginning to get hard to breathe. Draco didn’t know what could happen if your soul-mate rejected you, but if what he was feeling was any indication, it was nothing good.
Draco stared at him in awe, he blinked rapidly, “Could you repeat that last bit again?” He said as he got to his feet, hands coming to Harry’s hips.
“Severus!” Draco yelled as he got close to where the professors congregated. Severus’ head whipped upward; his expression confused. Draco did not call him by his first name in professional settings.
“You’re absolutely freezing,” Hermione commented for lack of anything else to say. Already her legs were numb and she had only been next to him for a few moments. She drew her wand and melted the nearby snow, carefully drying Draco’s clothes once that was done. She needed to get his body temperature back up.  Lastly, she cast a Warming Charm and hoped it was enough. His shivers seemed to be subsiding, which was either very good or very bad. His focus seemed to be returning as well, so she was leaning towards the former. She needed to do something about the wound on his face. It was bleeding a lot, but head wounds always did. Hermione momentarily cursed herself for her lack of knowledge in healing spells. With the company she kept she really ought to look into at least some simple spells.
Harry set the paper down, “Shh, we’re okay. Just me. There’s no other map. It’s one of a kind.” He pulled Draco against his chest and rubbed his back comfortingly.
Harry squinted at him, “What the Canary Creams? Yeah it was hilarious, glad you and Pansy were able to avoid it. I’m still wondering what Zabini did to Fred and George.”
“I asked if you’re all right, you looked weird,” Her hand rested softly on his arm and he smiled at her.
The pair of them crept through the halls, holding in their laughter as they caught a plethora of other students trying to sneak back to their houses. As they got close to the Slytherin Common Room, Severus was patrolling but thankfully caught a 7th year the hallway away from the entrance and was too busy taking points and assigning detention to hear Draco muttering the password.
“That’s my son!” A desperate voice broke through the din, and Mr. Weasley appeared as he shoved through the group of wizards. “Lower your wands! That’s my son!”
“Harry, Harry look at me,” Draco whispered, his hands coming up to cradle either side of Harry’s face, the stream of the shower running over the two of them. “Harry, you’re my soul-mate, you are the love of my life. No one, not even Voldemort, is going to do a thing about that. I love you,” Draco assured and pressed his lips to Harry’s forehead right on top of his scar which was enflamed and bleeding. “I definitely didn’t open myself up to Weasley’s rage for shits and giggles, I’m very surprised he hasn’t burst in here yet, thinking I’m taking away your virtue.”
Malfoy froze and stared up at the ceiling, then sighed looking back down. “Yes, Potter, there are spells that can conceal your features. I know it’s harder to hide soul-marks, but I’m sure there’s something out there. You really don’t know much about magic do you?”
Harry blushed and looked down at his plate but heard Ginny groan again. “Yeah two years ago! Merlin Ron!”
Harry hesitantly reached forward, looking up into Malfoy’s eyes as he moved his hand closer. Malfoy didn’t move to step away or stop him and Harry carefully trailed his fingers across the mark. Harry noticed it felt a lot like when he touched a blanket fresh out of Aunt Petunia’s dryer, which she had insisted on getting to show the neighbours she was better than them. Harry secretly thought she just didn’t like having her under things drying in the backyard on the line.
Malfoy snorted, and Harry was worried he really was going to puke, when Malfoy brushed his hair out of his face Harry saw he had been laughing. “How can you even look at me? Comfort me? You should curse me, I fucking deserve it,” Malfoy spit venomously.
Draco willed himself to calm down. Harry was obviously okay; he did phenomenally, and had obviously finished with one of the fastest times, although it had felt like much longer to Draco. Draco was calmed minutely when Harry was brought back out for the scores and Draco could see that his shoulder had been mostly mended. He was not thrilled about the way Weasley had his arm around him. Harry had obviously forgiven him, but Draco assuredly had not. Weasley did not get to just come crawling back after how he had treated Harry the past month.
“I’m going to turn the water on, okay? I’m right here,” Draco said and watched Harry slowly nod his head. Draco got the water temperature to an acceptable level and then looked back to Harry. He looked dead. All of the light that had been present just hours before was gone from his eyes and he was barely keeping himself upright.
“Sorry, merpeople,” Harry corrected himself. He looked up at his wand, pressing one of his hands to Draco’s mark and reached his other out towards his wand, trying to summon it again. His wand obediently soared across the room and into his hand. “Are you kidding me?!”
She needn’t have tried, as she finished ordering Mr. Malfoy was on his feet, basically dragging Draco from the pub. The look on Draco’s face could only be described as resigned, whereas Mr. Malfoy looked enraged.
"Surely Dumbledore told you!" McGonagall yelled at Moody, who was already stalking away, his foot making a loud bang every other step.
More pain flared in his leg and a feeling of extreme adrenaline and anxiety, then more pain and shock and despair, and Draco realized with intense relief that Harry was back on the grounds.
“I might vomit,” Malfoy gasped out. Harry’s eyes bulged and he hesitantly ran his hand lightly over Malfoy’s shoulders.
“Let’s see it then,” She instructed, making herself comfortable on a desk, smoothing her skirt down.
Why is this always his life? Harry questioned himself, hastily pulling his shirt back down. Thankfully everything was covered by his t-shirt, but he would have to kiss any vests or unbuttoning past the 2nd or 3rd button of his school uniform, goodbye. Once it got cold enough to wear the school sweater, that’d cover it well enough too. He wondered what Malfoy’s mark looked like. Normally the marks were opposites of each other, Seamus and Dean’s being fire and water. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were soul-mates, but their tattoos were more subtle. Mrs. Weasley had roots, and Mr. Weasley had a blossoming tree. Harry had never seen a mark take up as much space as his was. And he worried how much it would grow; he had barely had a growth spurt yet, unlike Ron who was already taller than Percy and quickly gaining on the twins.
“Ha! Didn’t think that through did ya?!” Harry laughed as Draco rubbed his ear. Draco was not in love with how much stronger their bond had gotten when it came to sharing each other’s pain.
“I think it is lovely of you to join us,” Luna’s soft and music-like voice floated from where she sat next to Ginny across from them.
“Shh, it’s okay, I’m right here. You’re waking up from an extra strength Dreamless Sleep. It’s going to take a few minutes. You are safe. Take your time, I’m not going anywhere,” Draco’s voice was so soothing and Harry instantly relaxed. He had taken Dreamless Sleep before, it usually made him extra groggy but this was on another level. He trusted Draco though, so he would let himself slowly wake up.
“Fine,” Draco muttered, eyes now glued to the ground, but Hermione thought she might have seen the corner of his lips almost perk upwards. Hermione gave him one last look before hurrying away from him back towards the main street.
“Now I am sorry to separate the two of you so quickly, but Sirius, I need you to alert the old crowd and then stay with Remus for a while.”
“Potter is with the Headmaster. Barty Crouch Jr. was polyjuicing as Moody the entire year! I knew my stores had been pilfered!” Severus spit, looking incredibly put out.
“Are you hungry?” Draco asked, as his stomach gave a grumble. The noise was thankfully able to bring a smirk to Harry’s face.
“You don’t seem to enjoy unexpected loud noises,” Draco commented, lowering the shield and peeking into the cauldron.
“Pans,” Theo commented, pursing his lips ever so slightly, hoping she took a hint. Her eyes narrowed infinitesimally and she grinned at him.
Draco scowled right back, she was right and he knew it. Draco carefully unbuttoned his shirt, feeling very naked and very vulnerable despite the fact that he hadn’t even unbuttoned his shirt the entire way.
Draco was thankful for the familiar bickering. His anxiety was ranked up about 50 notches. He just couldn’t shake the feeling that something terribly wrong was going to happen. Although if he were being honest with himself, he felt that way during every task.
“You better be nice, I’ll be extremely cross if you make him upset,” Draco warned as they left the room.
To LadaHathaway that guessed that he was emancipating himself, you basically got it right! This chapter was very difficult. I am not used to writing lore or descriptive scenes. I feel as though I flourish more with dialogue. I hope I did okay. So Draco is essentially 17 in the eyes of magic. We'll see more of what that entails in the following chapters. We really start to deviate from the canon here.
Harry grinned, quickly buttoning his shirt again and picking his tie up of the floor, slinging it around his shoulders.
“My potion is going to explode in a few seconds, just forewarning you,” Draco said dropping in the last few ingredients in and casting a quick
“I’ll – fine,” Draco slurred, turning his face towards her. Hermione breathed a quiet sigh of relief, at least he wasn’t paralyzed or something like that.
What the hell were Fred and George doing here? Harry opened the door a few inches and the twins slid into the bathroom.
“Fuck,” He sighed. “Are they trying to get you all killed? There’s a wizarding saying ‘never cross a mother dragon’.  Dragons are incredibly protective of their young; the fact that they have mother dragons means they are going to be that much more vicious. I can only imagine how they will be when their nests are involved.”
“Of course, I’m here, can’t let Weasley see my man naked, can I? Let’s get the rest of these clothes off and get clean.”
“The man was saying he was doing this because of You-Know-Who, Dumbledore! That doesn’t strike you as delusional? Please see some sense!”
“I think I could get used to this sharing thing,” Draco muttered, shifting and throwing a leg over Harry’s lap, straddling his hips similarly to how Harry had done to him down by the Lake what seemed like a lifetime ago.
Draco was shocked to hear what Mrs. Weasley had to say. He had not expected her to be accepting of him so quickly.
Draco raised an eyebrow, “Going to let me steal your precious cloak? Or am I finally going to learn about your secret weapon.”
Draco stared at him incredulously without saying anything for a few moments, “Yeah, of course. Obviously there aren’t a lot left, they’re sort of hard to hide and hard to explain away to muggles.”
With everything going on, Draco tried not to feel too badly. With Crouch Sr showing up raving mad on the grounds last week, and then the dream that Harry had had in Divination earlier this week, Draco was ready for this school year to be over now. Especially with his plan having worked.
Draco left the loo and made his way back to the Castle. His friends would not be expecting him any time soon knowing he had a meeting with Lucius. Draco went straight to the classroom. It was empty when he arrived and Draco collapsed down onto the couch after renewing its transfiguration. Last thing he needed was it changing back to a desk while he laid on it. His face and body ached. Draco lay there with his eyes shut, feeling Harry’s emotions get closer and closer. He could only really detect anxiety and worry with an edge of anger. The door flew open with a crack and Harry charged through it, followed closely by Hermione. Draco passively wondered how they got rid of Weasley.
Draco realized his earlier hypothesis that Harry would have company was most likely correct. He was cut off from saying a word when Weasley’s head poked out from inside the curtains, all of the skin visible already multiple shades darker than his hair.
The next chapter is a longer one and is completely Harry/Draco! I'm super excited for it! Thank you for the continually awesome response to this! It makes my day to see more subscriptions, bookmarks, kudos, and especially comments! I hope you enjoy our introduction to Hogwarts! Some explanations about things to come in the next chapter as well! Let me know what ya think!
Pansy laughed at the two of them, rolling her eyes, but Draco could see how pleased she was underneath it all.
“Ron said awhile ago that his soul-mate would have to hit him across the face!” Harry was still cackling and it was beginning to lighten the mood of the room.
“I have been told you have cleaned up your vocabulary. You have not been joining in on putting Mudbloods in their place. If I did not know better, I would say you were growing soft. Becoming a Muggle-lover. What has gotten into you? Or should I say whom?” Father spit.
“Why would you even want to? It seems like an injury or worse waiting to happen!” Neville said as he got changed into his pyjamas.
Harry gazed at Draco, absently carding his fingers through his hair, “You stopped her? How? Why? You hate Hagrid. And what about him being a giant?”
Harry stared at his hands, willing them to do magic. He had stubbornly placed his wand across the room and was trying to summon it back to him using his hand. So far it had barely twitched. Harry sighed, falling back onto the pillows he had transfigured before ridding himself of his wand. He didn’t understand how he could do wandless magic without trying with Draco around, but couldn’t any other time. Harry let out a loud groan and sat up at the sound of laughter.
“Yeah well all you do is hole up in here by yourself, come back to the Common Room with us. I’m sure Snape will not begrudge you taking some time away from here,” Pansy complained.
Draco was inpatient. He had to know how Harry had done it. How had he wordlessly rebuttoned his shirt and completely disappeared with barely five seconds of time to react? He knew there were spells to become invisible, but they definitely had not been taught them yet. Harry did not strike him as the type to research spells in his downtime for fun. The Mud- Granger, Draco corrected himself, definitely seemed the type, so that was a possibility. Harry still would have done at least two spells wordlessly, which they definitely were not taught until 6th year. Draco never noticed Harry performing any other spells wordlessly; he was always very loud with the spells he cast in class.
"When did this even happen?" She burst, her eyes on Draco's chest. Draco could see her rubbing her thumb over the pattern of her Mark as she looked at him.
Draco bit his lip before his head whipped to the side as the sound of voices and footsteps filtered past the closed door. “I need to get back; Pansy is going to notice I’ve been gone. I’m sure your friends will as well. I will contact you when I get a chance.”
Harry continued to stare at him, words failing him. Malfoy stood up, stomping to the edge of the lake and kicking some sand in. “Stop staring at me like I should be committed! I’m trying to help!”
Draco set his face against Harry’s chest, carding his fingers through his soul-mate’s hair as he wept. The warmth from his Mark was comforting but Draco couldn’t get over the lack of feeling Harry’s emotions. It was like he had lost a part of himself that he hadn’t known he would miss. He had always assumed that he would know when Harry was in trouble due to their bond. That he would be able to swoop in and save the day for once. The reality was that Draco had no idea what he even would have done if he had known what Harry was going through. He had heard the tales of what Harry had down their first and second year, and he always imagined that it was so easy. That the right ideas would just line up in front of you.
Ron blushed scarlet, “It was nice, er, a good night. How about you Hermione, did you and Krum have a fun time? I can’t believe you kept that a secret from us!”
“We can continue this conversation in the morning!" Draco interrupted, "Harry you need to sleep, you’re barely keeping your eyes open!”
“I’m trying not to laugh, but I’m imagining what you probably said,” Harry said staring up at him, his eyes soft.
“We’ve touched loads of times though,” Ginny said her eyes still fixed to their marks. Harry noticed that Ginny’s mark was on her left arm and hand, whereas Luna’s was on her right arm and hand so where their fingers interlocked their marks overlapped. Harry was momentarily jealous that they would be able to make contact with each other’s marks while simply holding hands.
Woo, that was a long one, and sooooo much fun to write. It took me a bit to get it out because I just wasn't happy with the flow. I figured I just had to stop nit-picking and post it, so here you go! Getting closer to the end here! Also, I hope it's clear, but Draco refers to Bill as William because he would only ever know the proper names of the Pureblood families, not their nicknames (unless they attend Hogwarts at the same time). I hope that clarifies it for those of you who may have been confused!
"Thank you," Harry muttered as Draco helped him get settled, he grabbed tightly onto Draco's hand as he pulled away.
“Only tea today,” He muttered and she looked at him in confusion as he pulled away. Across from him Blaise was biting into ham and cheese croissant, still half asleep.
“Harry, are you all right?” Ron asked, putting his utensils down in a sure display that he was paying soul attention to Harry at the moment.
“I left him with Padma, it won’t last long though. I wasn’t able to hide the pain very well. I played it off as a bad headache, rubbed my scar a bit.”
Draco stared at him in confusion before remembering that Harry probably knew next to nothing about his family, “Well invisibility fabrics were founded in India. They were the first to weave them. The Potters are a very affluent Indian family, it makes sense they would have a good one. That thing must be at least what, 20 years old, at the least? I’d wager it’s much older. Other run-of-the-mill cloaks would have faded by now.”
Draco cast the spell on their feet and they made their way out of their classroom and down to the dungeons. Draco was completely awe-struck by this map. It was no wonder Harry had no problem always knowing where he was.
“Is everything okay, Harry?” Ron asked suddenly, his hands deftly setting up chess pieces in front of the pair of them. Hermione was out with Krum and Harry has decided to actually spend time with his best mate.
“She’s actually really brilliant when you get to know her,” Harry defended. “She sacrificed a lot to cover for Draco and I this year.”
Draco spun the two of them around and pressed Harry against the wall, still holding steady to his tie. “This is the first time I haven’t wanted to rip your clothes off,” Draco commented before bringing his lips to Harry’s in a bruising kiss. Draco slotted his leg in between Harry’s and pressed his hips against him as he kissed down his neck, sucking hard on the skin as he went. Draco never left love bites where anyone could see them on Harry, but he found himself unable to care at this point. He had a night’s worth of pent-up frustration to let out. Harry was making absolutely delicious noises beneath him and Draco finally found the will power to undo the top of Harry’s robes to unveil his soul-mark. Draco lightly ran his nails down Harry’s chest before nipping at Harry’s bottom lip.
She left the room before Harry could say anything else. Relief flooded his body and he set his head down onto where he had his hand plastered to Draco’s mark.
The crowd was finally dismissed after Harry tied for first place with Cedric for ‘outstanding moral fibre’.
“You’re cute when you’re embarrassed,” Harry commented, before his eyes grew wide and he himself began blushing.
“I’m not a big fan of people healing me after Lockhart, it won’t kill me to have a bruise,” Harry shrugged.
“I would estimate about 30 seconds to a minute, possibly shorter,” Draco calculated, trying to think about the intense pain he had felt earlier. He glanced away from Harry for a second to see Madam Pomfrey pursing her lips.
The presence lingered, rooting through his memories and his magic. Finally, with a snap the study was around him once more. The wards and lines disappeared, but he felt as though he was being bathed in the same light that had spread out around him. Draco grasped his wand and golden sparks flew out of the tip at his touch. Draco smirked. He had passed.
Harry looked back at his torso, prodding slightly where the broken rib had been, watching for any reaction or to feel any pain.
“I’m just glad Harry figured out the egg as quickly as he did,” Hermione mused. “Imagine if he had waited until the week before or something.”
"Who cares? You heard what Moody said, he was trying to curse one of us. Better him than us," Ron shrugged and made his way into the Great Hall.
Nott pointed his wand at him and for a brief moment Harry thought he was going to curse him before he realized the wand was actually pointed at Hagrid’s door. Nott cast a stunning curse at the door, resulting in a loud bang that set Fang howling and loud footsteps pounded toward the door. When Harry looked back Nott was gone.
“I can’t say I have ever had a conversation with Ron or Hermione end like this,” Harry gasped in between Draco pressing his lips to Harry’s throat.
“I want to try something,” Harry whispered, sitting up and pushing Draco back onto the ground next to him. They had cleaned up the classroom a bit, and Draco would transfigure blankets and pillows for them often. Draco had a particular skill in Transfiguration and was slowly bringing Harry up to speed. Harry realized that a lot of the reason it always seemed like the Slytherins were ahead of them in classes was due to the sheer amount of magic they practiced outside of school and before Hogwarts even started. Draco had explained how most traditional pureblood households had wards on them that blocked the Ministry from being aware of the underage magic going on. Hermione had been incensed to find out that part of their class didn’t have to go the whole summer without performing magic.
Almost instantly, Harry wandlessly transfigured a pillow on the ground into what looked like a blue cushion the size of Draco’s hand. It had a weird lid on it but was cold as Harry gently settled it against Draco’s cheek.
“I’m telling you he’s gone! Far away –” He burst before he was cut off as the worst pain yet bloomed in his forehead. Draco was sure it was going to split in two, he grasped at his head again and fell to his knees.
Hermione worried her lip again with her teeth, he was seeming back to himself. Harry was burying his face in Draco’s shoulder.
“I bet you could get your father to agree to a betrothal with the youngest Weasley,” Pansy teased and he glared at her.
“You’ve just seemed off. We used to spend every night together, now it’s like I never see you. And I know I was a right prat this year, and it’s going to take time to get back to where we were. I just wondered if there was anything else going on.”
“Er, yes I did! Look I forgot about an essay I haven’t polished yet. Do you two mind terribly if I head back to the Castle?”
Harry sighed, “Yeah, Ron is definitely going to think we’re secretly dating,” he said looking over at Hermione.
“I’m going to hold you to that,” Harry smirked. Harry hated the sad look Draco had in his eyes; this was the one of the first real times that Harry had ever felt the loss of having to hide their bond from the world. All he wanted to do was march into the Yule Ball with Draco on his arm. The more he saw Draco and Parkinson together in the hallways, the more he just wanted to wrap Draco up in his arms and show off who actually leaves the love bites on Draco’s neck. Harry reached up and ran his fingers across the moon on Draco’s chest. Draco sighed at the contact before mimicking Harry’s movement.
"Let's see this miracle potion then," he nodded towards the now light green liquid, the same colour as the Quidditch Pitch after it had rained.
Harry’s blush was clear across his cheeks, “Fuck off, I wasn’t sure if you felt that way about guys.”
“We must let bygones be bygones, and forget childhood feuds. If there is one thing Harry and Draco have taught us it is that anyone can get past their differences. I expect the two of you to do the same,” Dumbledore said, his gaze switching between Sirius and Severus.
Weasley narrowed his eyes, but eventually rolled them before scoffing at him, quickly disappearing back within the curtains.
Harry shook his head, as if to clear it, “Anyway! Thank you for helping him. That means a lot to me that you’d do that.”
“It’s one of our latest inventions. We’ve been saving them for the right time. They survived the Great Cleanse of 1994 orchestrated by Mother Dearest.”
“So he knows he’s with Harry. If Harry was feeling his pain from that distance, they’ve accepted the bond. Neither of them is dead or seriously ill from rejection. Draco has chosen his side. So why hasn’t Harry said anything?”
Not even Malfoy and his family sitting behind them could sour his mood at this game. Throughout the whole game, Harry couldn’t stop thinking about how excited he was to get back on a broom. Just a few short days and he would be back on Hogwarts grounds and able to fly again.
Why was Theo’s life the way that it was? Why did he have to decide to go down to the greenhouses tonight of all nights? He should be glad he was where he was, otherwise who knows what could have happened to Scarhead and then Draco would have been a right bother. Theo quietly made his way back to the Common Room. He couldn’t afford to look or seem suspicious right now. He was sure the blame would fall on Slytherin regardless of how he got back to the Common Room, but hopefully Boy Wonder remembered his attackers. Theo knew from experience how messed up your mind got after being Cruciated. The Blue Twats would get what was coming to them though, he was sure Draco would make positive of that. Theo was just thankful that some well placed curses and a mimic spell on his footsteps had been enough to make Potter’s attackers run. He wasn’t sure he could have taken them all if they had stood their ground. Fucking cowards.
“I gathered that, I didn’t know that could happen,” Harry stared at Draco. He was asleep, having barely gained complete consciousness throughout the whole ordeal, which Harry was thankful for. It had been bad enough on his end.
Suddenly there was an ear shattering scream as Fleur was pulled onto the shore. Draco hadn’t been paying attention to know how she got there.
“Leave your hand on his chest,” Pomfrey warned before pointing her wand at Draco. Moments later, Draco gasped, eyes flying open. He made to sit up and was stopped by Harry, his eyes flew down to his bare chest, and then to Pomfrey.
She smiled at him kindly, and stood up, holding out her hand for him to take. “Well, Draco, I would absolutely love to be your girlfriend, thanks for asking. We should get back to the Common Room.”
Draco ignored the incredulous looks McGonagall and Severus were shooting him, and tilted his head at Fudge whom had now turned a delightful shade of puce.
“Did that little tussle snap you out of things?” He asked finally, rolling up the sleeves of his shirt.
Draco would neither confirm nor deny the absolutely amazing feelings hearing his given name come from Harry’s mouth caused him.
Harry climbed the steps to the room they had been training in, grinning at the sight of Sirius and Remus.
“I’m sorry, but it is clear you are being more than taken care of here,” Sirius stated before bending down and pulling Harry into a fierce hug. “I am never more than an owl away.”
Hermione did a quick check over of her clothes and made sure none of Draco’s blood had gotten on her, then ducked back into the Three Broomsticks. Ginny and Luna were right where she left them.
“I love you too, Harry,” Draco whispered before bringing his lips against Harry’s in a bruising kiss. Harry gasped against his lips.
Harry laughed at that, “Right after she did that Ron commented about how at least she knew the two of you weren’t soul-mates.”
Harry’s whole body ached. It was like the soreness after a particular long and cold Quidditch practice, multiplied by a million. His face ached even worse than his body did, like a Bludger had smacked him straight on. There was an odd weight on his chest as well. What had happened to him?
"Do you always perform wandless magic when you're upset? Fuck, how powerful are you?" Malfoy was staring at him, eyes wide.
Draco was lined up with the rest of the Slytherins and watched the comings of the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang contingency with vague interest. Harry was obviously enjoying the show, excitement boiling through the bond. Weasley kept tugging on Harry’s arm, and slinging his arm over his shoulder. Draco heard Harry laugh at something he said and failed to stifle his jealousy. Harry whipped around and found his eyes in the crowd, confusion evident, Draco resolutely looked away. Sure, Harry could get jealous if Draco was within a stone’s throw of Pansy, but he couldn’t when Weasley had his hands all over him. Sure, okay, seemed perfectly fair.
Even though Harry was out of the water and being shrouded in numerous blankets and Warming Charms, Draco was still frozen to the bone. Even his own Warming Charm did little to help. It was like when he would come in after being in the snow for hours, sometimes it felt like he’d never get warm. He hoped some Pepper-Up Potion would help once they could go inside. Draco barely heard the judges give their scores. Harry, Hermione, and Weasley were cuddling close together on the beach. Fleur was thanking Harry profusely, the small girl clinging to her, visibly shivering. Harry was nodding to her, but Draco could feel anger boiling through their bond. Draco didn’t quite understand what was bringing it on.
“It was fine, it’s good that everyone saw what they can do, I’m going for a walk,” Harry said quickly.
“I’m sorry if it was excruciating for you,” Draco murmured. “Yes, Lucius cast it a few times. I’ll be fine. This is not the first time he has done it. I think he might have put a little extra into it though. Although it might just be the amount of time since I was subjected to it. I didn’t go home for Christmas as I normally do.”
“What are you thinking, Draco?” Hermione asked, causing a few people to do a double take at the use of his first name.
“You all right, Harry?” Hermione asked and Harry nodded, trying to force down his blush of embarrassment.
“Let me go!” She screamed; her voice heavily accented. “You took my sister; I must get her! Let me go!” She fought against where Madame Maxime was clutching her. The exposed skin of Fleur’s forearms and calves were covered in red welts and the wet suit they had all been wearing was torn in places.
“I have no idea what you’re talking about, Weasel. Potter who gave you the bruise? I plan to send them flowers as a thank you.”
Draco worked through his stack, calling out thanks whenever he unwrapped a present from one of his housemates.
The Ball started to wind down and Pansy loudly called for Draco to escort her back to the Common Room, Draco was thankful for the out and bid his goodbyes to everyone before escorting Pansy from the Hall.
Dumbledore was wrapping up the ceremony and Draco was fixing to get up when the flame changed and Draco felt his heart drop into the pit of his stomach. He knew before Dumbledore read the paper, there was only one explanation.
“You sure you’re going to be able to not hide any details?” Harry teased turning fully towards him, Draco bit his lip.
“Not so brilliant are you, Potter?” The boy sneered at him, “Just goes to show how much you don’t deserve to be a Champion.”
“We’ll get to the bottom of this; I’m definitely forgetting something big. Has Krum said anything about his strategy?” Draco asked and Hermione immediately blushed.
Aren't they adorable?? Next chapter contains my favorite quote from the story so far, I cannot wait for yall to read it. Also a bonding happens! Are Draco and Harry forgetting something? It feels like they're forgetting something...
Draco was sure there would be a lot of talk of Cedric at the Feast, and he wasn’t even allowed to sit with Harry. At least now he could check on and stare at him openly.
“I’d lose them all for him! My real friends already know, and for those that don’t – if they turn against me for this, then I cannot trust them! As for my family, I hope Mother will at the very least understand my choice. I do not care what Lucius thinks. I am tired of being told to lead by a man who grovels at a Master’s boots. Harry is one of the first people to show me a life without pain or constant performance. I can be myself with him. That is worth it. Voldemort will lose and I do not pick losing sides,” Draco declared fiercely.
Harry peered at him, completely confused, Malfoy continued to look at him expectantly before sighing deeply and taking a deep breath.
“How can there not be Quidditch?” Harry complained. The one bright thing that had gotten him through this soul-mate drama was the idea that he would be able to fly again. Now this Triwizard Tournament business had to go and screw that up. He was thankful he couldn’t compete, the last thing he needed was more fame and glory.
Malfoy grabbed the jar and quickly chugged the contents, grimacing slightly as it went down. Almost instantaneously the red mark on his face faded, as did the marks on his arms.
“Get it together! The last thing he needs right now is your weakness,” Severus spit, pulling Draco towards his personal quarters. Draco realized in shock that Severus was right.
Draco had gotten him a journal, one of which he had a matching twin for. They would be able to write to each other through the journals, and there were charms on them so that no one would be able to read the contents except himself and Harry. After what had happened in second year, Draco knew Harry was most likely going to have a little trouble writing in a journal that wrote back to him. When he had pitched the idea to Hermione she had given him the full history of what had happened previously, but he was hopeful his note and Hermione would be more than enough. Draco was also quite excited at the aspect of being able to communicate to Harry outside of their sparse meetings.
Harry had been wearing a faded Chudley Cannons shirt to training but with how much of a sweat they had worked up, it had become a little see-through. An obvious soul-mark leaking through.
“You said I would lose her!” Fleur screeched, this time in French. “I do not care about myself! Let me go!”
He had never come out to any of his friends, officially, but it was an unspoken truth he knew Pansy was aware of.
Draco nodded before sprinting from the ward. He didn’t have to go far. Pansy was sitting against the wall a corridor over, face in her hands.
Harry couldn’t believe his luck, now all he had to do was sneak his way out of the Common Room. He carefully left his room and crept back down the steps. He tiptoed past Ron and Hermione, who were arguing about something or other, and made his way to the portrait hole. It only took a few minutes before a 5th year pushed their way through and Harry was able to sneak out.
We're so close to 1k kudos! Once we hit that I'm going to post the trip to Hogsmeade from Hermione's perspective as a little outtake! It will be posted separately though, and not as a part of this story. Thank you all so much, you're honestly the best!!
“It’s not a secret. You Gryffindors just don’t bother to learn anything outside your precious house do you?”
“We simply vanished our shit for hundreds of years before adopting indoor plumbing. Wizards aren’t prone to change,” Theo snorted and Pansy rolled her eyes.
“Not fire, a spark. It’s the things needed for fire,” Hermione said distractedly. “I think I’m going to go find Pansy. It doesn’t feel right without her. Ron why don’t you stay with Harry for now?”
Around him, he felt the shadows of the magic used within the Manor as well as from Lucius’ wand flare up. He witnessed shadows of the Cruciatus used over and over just a few feet from where he stood within the web. Years of Lucius casting it on him. He watched as a small book, ensconced in Darkness, was taken from the study, Lucius’ magic lingering around it. Countless other spells lit up around him all tinged with Darkness.
What do yall think Draco's solution was going to be to get Harry back? What do you think is happening to Draco? How will they fix it? Will anyone figure out about Harry and Draco? (Spoiler Alert: at least one person does!!!)
“You all need to go, get into the woods, and do not return until I come for you! Go, hurry! Keep track of each other! Fred, George, Ginny is your responsibility!” Mr. Weasley ordered, his wand out.
"Of course," Draco smiled, pulling Harry against him, wrapping his arms around him ducking his head into the crook of his neck. They stayed like that for a few minutes, Draco feeling some of the unsavory feelings coming through the bond beginning to melt away.
“Want to skip the train?” Harry asked passing the cold metal from hand to hand, pressing his thumb into the ridges.
Draco was sure he was going to vibrate out of his body with anticipation as he waited for Harry. Finally after he almost finished the potion altogether, he felt Harry’s emotions getting closer. Draco wrapped up the step he was on, setting a timer for the potion to brew, before turning towards the door and waiting. With a quiet click the door cracked open and Harry’s familiar mop of dark hair became visible. He closed the door behind him, pointing his wand at it and muttering a spell.
“That’s fair,” Neville said, before his head snapped to the side as the compartment door slammed open. Harry felt his stomach somersault as Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle appeared in the doorway.
During the few classes Hermione had with Draco, he was also acting significantly out of character. On the same day he received the letter Draco fudged three translations in Ancient Runes.
“Don’t worry about me!” Draco complained. “Find him! Voldemort is back isn’t he? He has Harry. He’ll fucking kill him!” Draco had realized that the pain in Severus’ mark could only mean one thing.
“Not all of us are born with melanin, it’s rude to comment on my lack-thereof!” He huffed and Harry stuck his tongue out at him.
After one more night in the Hospital Wing, Madam Pomfrey released Harry with some pamphlets detailing information on something called ‘Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder’. Harry didn’t really want to look at them, but Draco took them and pocketed them for later reading. Pomfrey also instructed Harry not to hesitate to Owl her if he needed any help or wanted to talk.
It took longer than Draco wanted, but finally Harry made it to the classroom. He came through the door, locking it behind him and whirling to see Draco, a bright smile on his face.
“Shut up, arsehole,” Ron stuck his tongue out at him before planting his feet and shoving backwards again to slam into the twins. Harry rolled his eyes as the shoving started back up again, before Mr. Weasley yelled at the boys to cut it out once Ginny had been set flying into his side for the second time.
Draco nodded, distractedly pulling on the clothes, too tired to even spell them on, “How long have you known?”
“Of course,” Theo mumbled back, he was clearly uncomfortable with Draco’s display of affection. Draco could not care less at this moment.
“At what point in the summer do you normally go to stay with the Weasleys?” Draco asked. He would have liked to let Harry enjoy the meal, but he really didn’t have much time to figure things out.
“We’ve got another lesson at the Ministry before our test. You could come to that and then set up more practice or your exam,” One of the twins said and Draco nodded in agreement.
“I was pretty sure Weasley was going to try and duel me for a minute there last night. Don’t worry our secret is still safe, I was on my best behaviour. I’ll have you know that I took a Bludger to the ribs and had to stay here the night to heal. No one bothered to check that we aren’t even playing Quidditch right now. Not my brightest lie, I’ll admit, but I was under a lot of pressure. I’m sure Hermione will take the piss later.”
Harry couldn’t stop staring at Malfoy. He was already in his school robes; his uniform perfectly put together, not a button undone or tie askew. Harry figured he must have come to the station like that, to get away with not changing on the train. Harry had considered it, but figured it would have been more out of character than if he ducked out to get changed in the loo. Malfoy stared back, his eyes fixed on the bruise on his cheek.
“Well, I’m not kissing him, if that’s what you’re asking,” Sirius commented, but reached out a hand towards Severus. Severus grasped it before recoiling quickly. Draco thought he was acting rather childish.
Ron’s thoughts were the overarching sentiment of the day. Everywhere he turned were whispers about Draco. Theories as to what could have possibly caused Lucius to give his son a black eye. Some said how they saw Draco and Lucius at the Three Broomsticks and Lucius had been upset over something. Harry overheard Ernie MacMillan speaking in scathing tones as to how a respectful pureblood patriarch could stoop so low.
Draco had heard enough, he pushed his way out from behind the curtain, “Good evening, Minister, how lovely to run into you.”
Ginny and Luna bonded! Congrats to those of you who guessed correctly!! I hope everyone likes their mark, I put a lot of thought into it. So Luna is officially introduced to our story and we got a taste of what Hermione is thinking. Draco and Harry are still 100% our most likely POVs but I will sprinkle in some others occasionally.
“You’re not allowed to talk right now. You got one of them. I’m the permanent third wheel to the Golden Couple.”
Some thoughts on whether or not Draco will be at the bottom of the lake. Are they correct in their logic? Only time will tell. We get some more Draco and Hermione friendship because I love them. Poor Hermione finally gets a friend who is as passionate about their studies as she is (so does Draco if we're being honest). Then some fun banter, because I needed some light-hearted Drarry this week.
Then again Harry also seemed to perform wandless magic without even realizing, so what was really out of the realm for him to accomplish?
“They can’t, it’s being dramatic.” He assured Harry, “We just need to do research on spells or potions. I don’t know any potions off the top of my head, but I have this feeling I’m forgetting something. We still have plenty of time though,” Draco added, reaching up and dragging his thumb across Harry’s mark.
“You haven’t said what was wrong with him?” He said through clenched teeth, already quite sure he knew what was about to be said. Panic was clawing at his chest again, barely held at bay by the rage flooding his body.
“It’s just us, Pomfrey promised privacy until morning,” Draco supplied, understanding the reason for Harry’s paranoia.
“I wanted to know if you did spells nonverbally,” Draco admitted quietly, blushing further still when Harry laughed again. “Stop laughing at me,” He whinged.
Harry awoke to loud crashes and assumed the fireworks had picked back up again. He carefully unstuck his shirt from his skin where his sweat had plastered it to his body. This soul-mark was already more trouble than it was worth, it was boiling and he couldn’t even go shirtless.
By the end of the day Draco had cast more curses than he had since September, most of his housemates were avoiding him at all costs due to his foul mood. He stomped up to their classroom and summoned several plates and goblets to break against the chalk board at the front of the room.
“What do they all have in common? They’re nesting; Charlie said they had to bring their eggs.” Hermione pointed out.
“I’m sorry, the last thing I want to do is keep secrets from you,” Harry sighed. “I’ll tell you what’s going on, but you have to swear to keep it secret. Like Padfoot level secret.”
“Oi! You finished up here?” Ron called as he threw the door open. Harry and Draco sighed in identical annoyance.
Harry did as he was told; forcing himself not to blush at Hermione’s pointed comment, and turned away from the Slytherin table. Draco’s message was clear, and Harry knew there would have been suspicion about the marks. He hadn’t exactly been thinking about that when he had given them. He guessed that Parkinson knew about them now, he hoped so at least, otherwise it would be a very cruel thing for Draco to do. Harry shook his head, he knew Draco better than that, Parkinson definitely knew.
She had gestured to the bed directly next to Harry’s curtained off one, and Draco gratefully collapsed onto it. He used the hand he had been holding his ribs with to press against his Mark hoping to feel even a shred of return warmth. Pomfrey disappeared back into her office and Draco figured Harry couldn’t be too badly off if she and Weasley were stepping away from him. He hadn’t been transferring to St. Mungos so it couldn’t be anything Pomfrey couldn’t handle.
Draco smiled at Harry, his face soft and unguarded. Again, Hermione was struck with the realization that his was not the same boy she had shared classes with for three years.
“I’m okay,” Draco whispered, staring into Harry’s eyes. Momentarily lost in the deep green of the irises. Draco should probably be worried about how easily he lost his train of thought, but at the moment it wasn’t at the top of his list. He noticed his cheek must be swelling because it was getting harder to see out of his left eye.
