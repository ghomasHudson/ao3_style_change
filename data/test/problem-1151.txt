“We go this way, first,” Critter takes them to the right. “These doors only be having a few rooms off them.”
They chat for a little while about the best ways to get Blaise and Daphne away from the other girls without raising suspicion, then, when their hour is almost up, move on to chatting about other things. Just before Pansy and Hermione arrive, Draco drags Hari to his feet and leads him from the room.
Draco snaps his fingers and Dobby appears.
“Oh, Merlin,” Hermione pales, “that won’t end well.”
“All day,” Hari grumbles, “Governors starting at ten, staff starting at two.”
Hermione sits next to Hari on the little couch, across from where Luna is curled in an arm chair. Hermione snaps twice and requests that Critter bring them some tea and light snacks. The selection arrives in moments.
“This is so stupid!” Hari cries, “why do they need to know this stuff? I mean, ‘the color of the walls (if indoors).’ Really?”
“Well? Are you getting up? We’ve got a busy day,” Draco waves his hand in a ‘get moving’ gesture. Hari stares at him for a moment, a little bewildered, then shakes his head and forces himself up. The day he understands Draco is the day pigs fly.
“I cut off our make out session to do homework, where do you think he is?”
“It did,” Daphne cheers happily, “we got her everything she needs.”
“Heir Nott,” Hermione bows.
Ooookay so I posted the wrong chapter. I'm leaving that one up as chapter 5 and just adding this one in. Sorry for the mix up.
“I definitely do!” Hermione squeals, “I can’t wait! When’s the next one?”
“Lord Potter, Miss Granger, welcome to my home,” Theo’s smile is honest as he bows.
“Do you, Miss Johnson?”
“So… what’s the whole story?” Pansy asks, tapping her toe impatiently. “And what are we telling the masses?” Hari lets Draco take the question.
“She has a small house?”
Hermione’s jaw drops at that, “you did that? Before school?”
“Tomorrow?” Hari suggests.
“You look stunning,” he finally murmurs. His fingers trace over the collar of Hari’s shirt.
“And that,” Draco chuckles, not-so-secretly pleased.
Pansy laughs, “oh, I love that name. Let’s go there.”
“I want to learn to make this,” Hari whispers and snaps for Critter. “Would you be offended if I asked you to teach me to cook this?” Critter shifts uncomfortably. “I enjoy cooking when I’m stressed and this recipe is incredible,” Hari placates, assuring Critter he doesn’t want to take over his duties. Critter perks right back up.
Hari nods to the adults around them, “If you’ll excuse me a moment, I see some other guests I must greet.”
“Is there a specific pattern for you, Critter?” Draco asks.
“I wanted to come and meet you,” Hari says, “and to also let you know that I have taken Hermione into my House and under my protection. I apologize for not asking your permission beforehand, but I thought it the best course of action for her safety at school.”
Rage peaks within Hari and he lets out a rolling snarl. The others stare at him in shock as he struggles to get himself back under control. It’s not working nearly as well as he’d hoped. But the compartment suddenly chills even further and something approaches the door. The door clangs a few times before the Dementor seems to get angry and starts fighting to open it. The door holds fast. The spell Hari had used was designed for this, he knows that, but actually putting it to the test is terrifying. It needs to hold, he can tell that much. With it still this far away, he can hear screaming distantly. A woman’s voice. And his name being cried.
“Oh, look,” Daphne points. There’s only one door on the left side of the hall.
Draco looks down at the mess of curls spread across his chest and can’t help but grin, his chest filled to bursting.
“About getting the older years into the class,” Hari sighs, leaning back, “I had a harder time planning for that. We essentially have two options: we tier the learning or we bring students in over the summer.”
I want to thank deeparah for providing the name I'm using here. I love it so much more than the one I'd initially picked.
“I think I’m hitting a growth spurt,” Hari admits. His bones have been aching slightly the last few days.
“That’s… a really good point,” Hari smiles at Draco, then turns back to scrutinizing the town, “I always just assumed Diagon was the most easily accessible for us.”
“I was. I need to pick up Galeru and I want to spend some time with my parents’ kneazle before going back.”
“Only if you’ll call me Blaise.” They grin at each other and Blaise leans in to whisper conspiratorially in Hari’s ear, “If you don’t want to be mobbed, stay out here. Also, my mother would like to meet you.”
“We’ll add you to the Manor wards, too,” Draco says.
“Good,” Professor Flitwick grins, teeth slightly sharp. “It was creating a rift with the ranked students to lose their titles.”
Alright, so I have definitely decided that Dumbledore's trial will take place in book four. It just doesn't fit in book three, which has officially broke 70k. I don't want book three to be massively larger than all the other books, so I'll just tweak the general plan slightly. It'll work out.
Draco’s lips are on his.
“Making you a spoiled brat.”
“So, basically,” Hermione leans forward, “you’ve got a pool of extremists who are alienating their own supporters by being
“Oh,” Hari perks up, “you want them to get stuck wandering Hogsmeade alone!” Hari looks up at Draco, who shoots a glance at the two in the room and then winks at Hari. Hari stifles a giggle—Draco’s not working one couple at a time, he’s going for two-in-one!
“Welcome to 12 Grimmauld Place,” Hermione smiles at them. The world becomes clear again.
“You bow first to Hari,” Pansy jumps in, “then more shallowly to the rest of us. We’ll stand close enough together that you won’t need to remember the order.” Hari finds the appropriate page and marks it with his finger.
“I did,” he giggles, “and a bunch of others that are definitely necessary.”
“I’m proud of you,” he says, “and Draco seems to really care about you. Are you happy with him?”
The morning of the next Wizengamot session, Hari is watching Draco rip through his closet, complaining that Hari has a ‘severe lack of clothes’. Hari has pointed out on several occasions that everything is new and they just went shopping, but Draco is having none of it. Apparently, the outfit needs to be ‘perfect’.
“Yes, Critter, could we get tea?”
“But at least then, I’ll know which I prefer,” she points out.
“Mum, this is Sirius Black. He’s Hari’s godfather and the only other member of Hari’s House,” Hermione introduces. “Padfoot, this is my Mum, Jean Granger.”
P.S. I'm posting this update to each fic, identically.
“Okay, now we can go.”
There’s silence in the room until Lord Nott says, “he has a point.”
“They’re going together,” Hari assures him, “they understand that Hogsmeade weekends are our only chances for dates.”
Hermione arrives first and they’re assaulted under a barrage of questions. Hari manages to halt those questions for a few minutes, however, when he stands and takes a small owl out of its cage.
Hari’s lips were just slightly chapped, but still so soft. And he tasted like the hot chocolate and that ice cream Critter likes to make him. Something sweet with an underlying flavor you can’t put a name to, but would know immediately upon tasting. Sweet like the sugar and cinnamon Hari always smells like. Sweet like Draco’s favorite flavors.
“I know.”
Blaise drags him off until they’re standing in front of a tall, imposing woman who radiates inner strength. “Mother, this is Lord Potter. I’d list his Houses but we don’t have time. And you definitely already know them. Hari, my mother, Lady Zabini of the House Zabini.”
“She also mentioned wanting to find a crumple-horned snorkack,” Hari says, “she thinks she’ll get along with them better than the nargles.”
From Blaise, he gets toys to play with in both his animagus forms and (jokingly) catnip. The whole group laughs at that and he and Blaise hug until Draco coughs pointedly.
“Minister Fudge,” Hari addresses the man, who turns to him with shock on his face. “It is in accordance with our laws that a Lord may claim his title and seat at the age of thirteen. These same laws declare that I have the right to make use of my seat beginning at the age of thirteen. I am thirteen years old. The magic has accepted me. I have my title and my seat. Are you denying me the right to make use of it as the law permits?”
“That’s positively devious,” Draco praises and Hari’s heart swells. Maybe it’s not the best situation, but he’ll handle it, and by the time he’s done, Fudge’ll wish he hadn’t ever had the idea of sending Dementors to Hogwarts.
“You know Longbottom, right?” he whispers to her. Longbottom should be safe—he’s a Gryffindor.
Professor Snape taps his wand against the massive stack of letters. All the muggleborn letters have separated out.
“Understandable,” Draco nods. “You were still planning on staying at your Manor for the night, though?”
“The children’s rooms be having a bedroom, bathroom, sitting area, and play room. The extra family rooms be having a bedroom, bathroom, sitting area, and study.”
“Yes, it is,” Hari agrees. “Wait—what if the name is Mango?”
“I want to make some changes to how things work around here, but I wanted your input first,” Hari says. “The first is that I’d like to remove Argus Filch from the grounds.” He’s not surprised by it, but the elves perk up. “Is that something you would be alright with me doing?”
” Hari’s brain goes fuzzy for a moment. Sirius speaks, “Hermione, you need to tell us where we are or we’ll be bounced out.”
Their tongues meet and dance playfully around each other. Hari lets Draco explore his mouth before pushing lightly to be allowed to do the same. He runs his tongue against Draco’s and across the ridges of his teeth.
“What’d you say to him?” Daphne asks.
“Let’s go see Professor Snape,” Blaise decides, “then bed.”
Hari thinks about it for a moment, “my primary ones, yes.”
“Hari!” Draco yanks him down the hall, “we’ve got to go!”
They talk over his possible transportation options for a little while longer and as they walk to class. But then they arrive and end up either diligently taking notes (Hari) or falling asleep where they sit (everyone else).
“Pettigrew got out?” Hari cries, horrified. After the hunt to find the monster the first time… Hari hadn’t exactly been up-to-date on that, since it happened the summer of first year, but he knew they’d caught him. That he’d been in Azkaban.
“Let’s go inside and get a drink so Hari can explain,” Hermione suggests.
Pansy starts, “Due tomorrow: an eight inch essay for Professor McGonagall on the transformative properties of wood, chapter six of Beasts, translating that paragraph on page 127 for Latin, and reading chapter four for Herbology. For electives, it’s the work problems at the end of chapter three in Runes and reviewing chapter eight for Muggle Studies. No homework for Dueling and Spells.”
“That sounds perfect, Miss Lovegood,” Hari assures her. She smiles at him.
“As is first on our agenda,” Dumbledore begins and Hari opens the file on his desk. He’d reviewed the papers within before coming, studying Lucius’ copy.
“Alright, Narcissa should be here in just a minute,” Hari slips out his pocket watch and checks the time, “but I need to be going. Will you be okay on your own until she gets here?”
“Lord Potter is a terribly strong soul,” she tells the Wizengamot, “When I heard what had happened, I expected a broken little thing to show up at our Manor. Someone who needed constant care and supervision and to be treated like glass.
Hari snaps twice as soon as they arrive, calling Critter to his side.
Mango meows and gives him a look to say he already knew that.
Well, you guys almost didn't get a chapter today. Purely because I wasn't paying attention to the time and forgot to post. *facepalm*
“I guess I understand,” Pansy starts, “but she’s part of your House now.”
“I’m not sure if I’m happy or sad about that, but I can use it to my advantage, so I won’t complain,” Hari says.
“But I wasn’t.”
“One for each Hogwarts House,” Professor Snape murmurs, smirking slightly. Hari giggles.
“Let’s do Slytherin,” he agrees excitedly, “there’s one called Viper’s Nest and I’m really curious about it.”
“Will you give it back when you’re done?” Hari asks, slowly relaxing from his defensive position.
“We learned it in primary, in history,” Hari chirps. “When we were studying some of the wars.”
Hari turns to look at Trelawney, “I apologize, Professor Trelawney, but you will not be receiving new students in the Divination course. Any students who took your class last year will be able to continue until they graduate, which is four more years. We have several more classes we are looking to add to the curriculum in the coming years. Should you fit the qualifications for any of them, you will be the first considered for the position.” He offers her a shallow bow and has to look away when she starts to sniffle.
He wished he could talk to Harry alone. He wished they could put their heads together and figure out the best solution to stop whatever Drys’s plans were. Draco was not cut out to make such a huge decision by himself, and even though Harry was currently resting in his arms, he didn’t feel comfortable asking Harry what he should do right in front of the Kaspians. He didn’t want the Kaspians to see how weak he was; not even able to make his own decisions.
Draco was about to tell Potter they should head straight to their usual spot in the library when he grabbed Draco’s elbow, stopping him in his tracks. The contact sent a chill throughout Draco, and he was startled at Potter’s nearness.
Draco whirled around in his spot by the fire to face Potter, shocked at all the talking and apologizing Potter had done in the last twenty four hours. “Why do you keep saying sorry? Why do you care about me after all the horrible things I’ve done to you?”
laying in front of them, her eyes doubling in size as she skimmed whatever was written.
Harry’s frown deepened, and he took his spot across from Draco again on the blanket. “What’s wrong, then?”
“The journey back is so long. We won’t ever make it to the castle on empty stomachs.”
Hogwarts, probably around the same time when he had stopped thinking about what would come after the Dark Lord’s downfall. Both had seemed like such far-fetched fantasies, he thought it was silly to dwell on them. But in reality, one had already surpassed, and the other was coming up in June.
They sat in silence for a good five minutes, only the noise of wind and their breathing to be heard.
Draco wasn’t sure what dictated love, since he’d never seen true love up close, but he hoped that when two people destined to clash, destined to rip each other apart, destined to be on opposite sides of a war, started truly caring for each other, and acknowledged it fully; that it meant they had overcome every obstacle destiny had thrown at them, and had found love in each other, instead of destruction.
The new photo appeared in Harry’s hand, and the picture turned out as perfect as the last. Both of their smiles shown so bright, they could’ve been mistaken as the stars above their heads.
Draco fought back the urge to strangle Potter. He was not having this conversation. Sure, Potter had testified on Draco’s behalf at his trial. Potter was the one who had gotten Draco out of a five year sentence to Azkaban. Potter had practically saved his life. Not for the first time. But Draco hated being reminded of the terrible things he had done and their consequences. Especially when they were brought up by Potter. The very definition of all things good and light in the world.
“That’s not important,” Drys nearly yelled. “What’s. Your. Choice.
a nerd. I honestly think you’d get along really well with Hermione.”
Small groups of people were swarming his table now--mostly Slytherins--and no one was clapping or screaming, thank Merlin, but the chatter that filled the Great Hall was incredibly loud, and Draco found himself face to face with multiple people who, only a day ago, had glared at him and tried to throw a discreet jinx at his feet.
“I’ve already defeated one dark wizard, how hard can defeating another one be?”
“Alright, enough about me. Now it’s your turn,” Potter said. Draco noticed Potter was gradually regaining his usual posture and attitude, which he was glad about.
“Yes, indeed. However there is a limit to how many questions you may ask it.”
“One minute.”
The mention of Alec woke Drys up once again. “But he isn’t purely Muggle-born!” Drys spoke quickly, hoping to get his point across before they decided to use the killing curse again. “
When Draco got dressed, he was feeling extra bold and decided to wear a Muggle themed outfit: jeans and a jumper. He contemplated changing a dozen times while admiring his outfit in the mirror, and after a lot of self pep-talks, he walked out of the bathroom sort of confidently in his Muggle attire.
him to get what he wanted.
“How are you just realizing this now?”
Harry placed a hand on Draco’s arm, squeezing it a bit. “I’ll put it on for you, if you’d like.”
Draco wasn’t put off by this, only more motivated. More motivated to love Harry and to work for an even brighter future. After all, Draco couldn’t imagine his life without Harry in it. Harry was the death of him, and Draco the death of Harry.
“I love you more.”
The door slammed open, which stopped all of the yelling; Draco was grateful. He was suspecting Harry to come bursting in, saving the day. Harry had specifically told him that he wouldn’t let Draco be arrested. The day that they had tested out the Restorative potion on Theo.
Everything was new and changing around him, and the prospect of leaving the one place that had kept him (relatively) safe since he was eleven years old was terrifying.
The rock immediately disintegrated.
The real reason, as written by a complete wanker at the prophet, was that Harry cheated on Ginny Weasley, and the girl Weasley found out, promptly breaking up with him.
“Yeah.” He attempted to look over her shoulder at the entrance, but she was standing directly in the way of the door. “What happened? Why am I in the Hospital Wing?”
leaving outweighed my denial of returning, in the end.”
“Or, you can

He finally found his green scarf, hat, and gloves and put them on. He already had changed out of his robes and dress shirt and had switched to a black jumper with his winter coat on top.
gave me, and witnessing countless murders, I actually ended up killing someone myself. Including my own father.”
The door was a deep forest green, embedded with designs of fairies and magic sparks, and what Draco was sure was some sort of waterfall. It was definitely a special door that led to a special room of some sort. Draco itched to turn the handle and waltz inside, but he knew it wouldn’t be safe to do so. It could be a trap.
“Look, I won’t be long, I just want to see how Draco’s doing,” Pansy said impatiently. From behind her, Draco could see Granger nod her head in agreement, while Weasley was staring at his feet, and Potter seemed to have no clue where to look.
That would never happen to Draco.
Weasley and Granger, oddly enough, shared an appearance of content, and what could only be summed up in two words as:
“Well you don’t get to say that when you constantly get up from your seat.” Harry crossed his arms, falling into a prideful stance that clearly said he wasn’t backing down from this argument. “What are you reading now, anyway?” He pointed at the book laid out in front of Draco with his wand.
He was lucky, though, that they were only accessing his memories starting from the point of Drys and him beginning to duel, and ending with Draco completely blacking out. They said they had no need to watch any of his other memories from the two weeks, to which he sighed thankfully at. They’d be missing plenty of information without accessing his memories from the rest of the two weeks, but Draco wasn’t planning on mentioning that.
“Oh, um, Alec taught me them. He also introduced me to rock music and pop music, and well, lots of genres of music,” Harry answered, now pointing his wand at the radio and muttering some charm.
even when on the outside, he’d been trying to tell himself it was right- that he was
All too quickly, Harry pulled back and smiled with both his mouth and eyes. “Does that answer your question?”
you need to know how to defend yourself. This whole thing could turn ugly. What if the figure who’s in my visions, cast the sleeping curse, and put up a ward around us, comes to Hogwarts? You need to know more spells than
on you. Got it?”
“‘The Hearts’ Deepest Secret Will Uncover More Than What You Seek,’” Snape recited the words on the cover. “Isn’t it obvious what it means?”
In the end, he recollected a majority of that whole situation.
Draco groaned and let his head fall into his hands, his fingers clutching at his hair. He did not deserve Harry and his almost poetic-like words.
Draco, on the other hand, was extremely embarrassed to dance in front of Harry. But, after a lot of prompting from Harry, Draco finally copied what Harry was doing, even if it was toned down by a great amount.
“What did it say?” Pansy asked.
mixed with his own grief for his mother is why I think he acts so… mean.” Harry finished, and was shifting uncomfortably.
currently sticking an Anemonlea in his hair, tucking the stem behind his ear, and fixing the flower petals intently.
“Let me stop you right there. You can’t even use any type of magic that can harm people,” Drys scoffed.
Once he made sure he wasn’t leaving behind his wand, he eyed the set of cufflinks on the table miserably. He didn’t need them. He didn’t. He was wearing a heavy coat, and it would look silly with his jumper. And yet…
Potter looked startled at the question. “Uh, no. It has never hurt in any way ever since Voldemort died. Why?”
They left the room, and once they were outside the entrance, the wooden door carved with designs completely disappeared, going back to the original, plain stone wall.
Lastly, the thing he hated
challenging, since my leg was broken and my arm had lost practically all function.
Draco glanced at Alec, his face stuck in a tight scowl. He then moved his gaze to Drys, who was so tall and scary, yet nothing even comparable to the Dark Lord. He wished he could look at Harry. He wanted to know what Harry was thinking about all of this, and how he was dealing with the knowledge that Draco had the power to either mar Harry, or let him die.
Of course he would be the one to save the day. Draco should have known that Potter would be the one to eventually free him. It only made sense.
Draco was abruptly awoken by someone shaking his shoulders violently. Someone who smelled like fire whiskey and strong perfume.
I do hope though that you all enjoyed this chapter and weren't totally confused while reading, and that it lived up to your expectations <3 And I have to admit, I cried for Draco while writing this, like idk why I make him suffer so much, it breaks my own heart.
If the place Harry suggested turned out to be Hell itself, Draco knew he would gladly follow him there.
Draco found a spare sheet of parchment laying on one of the empty tables, along with a quill nearby, and got to work writing his letter.
In some way, shape or form, Draco had found Harry, and along the way he’d found himself, too.
Draco sighed, taking in all the things they’d said, and flopped back onto the bed. He was tired and content, and right then it was the most relaxing combination ever. He wished he could close his eyes and forever be caught in the moment of Harry and him easily chatting; Harry truly confirming they were friends, even after everything.
“You wanted to talk to me, mother?” Draco said as he exited the entrance to the Headmistress’s office. He went to stand next to Narcissa who had been patiently waiting next to the gargoyle.
Potter’s hands went up in mock surrender. “I won’t, I won’t. You’re talking about Theodore Nott, right?”
“You know this sort of reminds me of sixth year, on the Hogwarts Express. Except the other way around.”
“Just beware of Theo and the lot. They came back from dinner not too long ago and went to the dorm.”
“I guess so. Definitely not fast though.” Draco said as he pulled himself up off the ground, snatching his wand out of the snow and shoving it into his trouser pocket.
Harry turned around to face Draco. “What song?”
Draco felt like giving a quick little laugh and saying “All right, enough on that topic, let’s go back to talking about how you’re a stalker!” Instead, he turned slightly away from Harry, not wanting him to see the shame in his eyes.
“Really? I mean, it seemed like you guys were close. He stood up for you to Professor Wynn. He spoke for you at your trial this summer. He got you out of Azkaban. You know who’s in Azkaban right now? My father. You should be there right along with-”
Draco wiped at his tears with his free hand. “I don’t know.” He cried some more.
He was dancing in the Garden with Harry. Although, Draco left that part out when relaying it back to the real Harry, who was still sitting intently in front of him, his eyes glossy.
“Draco?” Harry’s voice was raspy, heavy with sleep.
“Are you really asking me this right now?” Draco was absolutely incredulous. “I’m trying to sleep, for your information.”
“Yes, of course. Anything, my dear.” Her smile was beautiful. He hoped she kept her smile in a minute.
Drys nodded. “Alright.”
Mad at
“Wait!” Draco exclaimed, but it was too late.
“No?” Harry said questioningly, quirking an eyebrow. His eyes were still squinty due to his lack of glasses.
Draco just
“No, no, no. I asked you first.” Harry smirked. Draco wished he wouldn’t, though. First off, it was
It seemed like such a long time ago; his mother spontaneously writing to him about the consideration of selling the Manor.
But she didn’t get to finish what she was going to say. Once again, the door to the Infirmary slammed open, and Pansy strode in, flanked by Granger, Weasley, and Potter. He was almost relieved to see Pansy, to talk to a friend, but he didn’t know what the fuck the other three were doing, and he had no intention of talking to any of them.
dark. Plus, Draco had his
He could have sent a letter for help, since the owl had successfully breached the ward without disintegrating, and yet he chose to send a letter to his father. Sure, he didn’t know the letter would be successfully received by anyone, but he could have at least tried. He thought briefly of sending another letter when he heard Potter cry out, “Draco, Draco! Come here!”
Maybe he was still overwhelmed by the confrontation that had just happened in the library.
Potter stopped walking, and stood facing the side of the path they were walking on. Draco automatically saw why he had stopped and what he was looking at. There was a patch of bright yellow flowers, sparkling in Potter’s wand light. Draco recognized them as Anemonlea, a rare type of flower that only blossomed in the winter. He knew it was quite difficult to actually spot them, for they usually bloomed far away from the human population.
"don't you even finish that sentence," harry interrupted her, setting his mug down carefully and turning, "you are not watching it without me,"
"nothing," he settled for an appropriate answer to save face. it was better he held some ground, kept his space. He wouldn't check up on Harry's health. asking if harry was alright was what he had granger and the weasleys for. Draco was just helping him with his homework, and he  feared the word just in that thought the same way he felt saved by it.
Harry was sitting at his kitchen bench, which doubled as Draco's dining table and desk, looking about uncertainty. draco felt self conscious, like he himself was under scrutiny.
and Luna spied draco watching them from across the glass room. Luna had excused herself, allowing pots to continue his lecture, and wandered over to the shy blond kid.
and very much liked it. He wanted to do more things together with people, with Harry. He had done enough healing on his own and felt ready for the stuff he had to do
"yes please, can you put some roses in it this morning too? i need something clean.." she trailed off, sniffing a pair of underwear. harry nodded and left her to it, and threw the shirt into the laundry room. he had to heat up the coffee again and poured out two mugs, filling one with milk and honey and the other with rose petals they had drying in a mesh bag that hung from the curtain rod. he watched them suck up moisture and expand in the coffee as he stirred it, pulling one out to nibble on.
His first conversation with jordan in sixth grade, out in the forest for a herbology lesson looking for bracken ferns, slipped through his memory. Jordan had approached him openly and unafraid, introducing himself and holding out a dirty hand for draco to shake. It had been on a day when his usual possy, crabbe and goyal, were in detention for something Draco hadn't bothered to commit to memory, and he had been feeling relaxed without peer pressure to be a twat. Draco had even shaken Jordan's hand, maybe he had even smiled.
, Harry thought.
“Thank you harry.” Luna gave him a grin, she was sitting next to the stovetop cradling a mug of brew in her lap, the ends of her hair trailing in it.
The class was instructed to split up into pairs to complete the next assignment and as they were dismissed to rummage the storage cupboard mis v dodged through the students over to harry. she stared at him for a moment and signed heavily. draco was still sitting next to him furiously scribbling down the notes off the board, anticipating the scolding he was going to get after potter.
"You missed the hand in date of the last potion," she told Harry, Draco felt a little bad for listening in, '' I'll be needing it by the start of next week. I have to grade all the potions before I can give out scores and feedback. can you get it into me by then?" mis v leaned a chubby fist on his desk, her knuckles cracking under her weight loudly. Harry stifled a yawn that he felt trying to bubble out of him at an inappropriate moment and nodded his head, lifting his thumbs into the air.
"where's your bathroom?" Harry asked, after passing Draco a stirring stick without even being asked, he had just instinctively known what draco meant when he twitched a finger in its direction. it wouldnt do to be this comfortable with this man, who had killed others and enabled murder in a school. Harry needed air. his lungs were tight and he felt his heart in his chest.
of them growing to the east of the clearing, wildly swinging in the breese on delicate stems that spread upwards like a searching octopus. Draco recognised wormwood and absinthe and lavender and thick grasses and spindly shrubs of this and thick creches of that. He saw a number of the late blooming roses he had been seeking growing a few metres outside of the clearing, the old flower heads still spread open while the newer ones started to close up for the night.
“I don't think that's a real word,” ginny scoffed. She was in her chair playing with a hot bean bag, the grains inside it made pleasant grinding sounds. The chamomile was hanging in the kitchen by the window, they had washed it and every now and then draco heard a drop of water hit the bench. It was irritating, so different to his unit which was almost dead silent. Their house was far closer to the forest than his, the trees nearest rubbed against the roof and crickets chirped merrily and the whistling of air moving through the branches of the forest could be heard. The walls were very thin, draco supposed. Harry had done another warming charm on the house and Draco smiled pleasantly, he looked like a man who would produce a good amount of warmth. Ginny explained that he had burnt the quibbler and draco called it a nonsensical problem.
“Sands almost out,'' Harry muttered and scooped the cat into his arms gently as he stood, “we should finish brewing.” Draco darted to the door and opened it, letting Harry and the cat inside.
meant anyone any harm, that his hand had been forced for the most part. And Harry thought he too had moved on, that he could maybe.. not forgive, but accept and understand better what draco had been going through back then. He resented Draco for that in a way, that he had been allowed to move on and pass off everything he had done as childhood mistakes. If he had been four or five  years older draco would be in for a prison sentence next to his father, but he had gotten lucky. Harry knew those were cruel and unfair thoughts, but old habits die hard as it turned out, and Harry was back to resenting and watching draco.
Harry sat under the spray of the shower, he dug his thumbs into his eyelids and hugged his knees to his chest. What had he been thinking? He shouldn't have let Malfoy do that, he should have turned away sooner, he should have left when he first said he would. He should never have sought out to inflict karma, he shouldnt have done his potions assignment with a fucking death eater, he should have just ignored malfoy from the start. Maybe then everything would be alright.
"Yes, actually, that would be nice," Harry mumbled as draco got up, already heading inside.
"Are you particularly hungry?" He asked, looking over his shoulder to find Harry openly staring at him. His face heated, the intimacy of the situation he found himself in was overwhelming. Cooking, in his house, for an attractive man who was sitting in his kitchen watching him. God he was so stupid. He had let his guard down too often around too many people as of late, and although it was nice and it was relaxing, it also left him so vulnerable. He hated that aspect of relationships.
“you can aparate here,” harry said, snapping draco back to reality. They were under the streetlamp, draco could see vines snaking around its cold metal surface, little buds of sleeping blooms decorating the leathery stalk. He looked at harry, his hair wild and jacket zipped up to his throat, stubble on his chin, skin golden under the lamplight. God he was beautiful draco thought. He apparated away with a sharp crack and not another dangerous word.
“You prepared for the history exam tomorrow?” Harry asked, nudging luna who looked like she might fall asleep. She blinked up at him and pulled her scarf up around her throat, snuggling her face into Brenton's dirty furr. Draco was going to have to bathe the cat when he got home, he wasn't exactly looking forward to that task.
And Jordan had seen right through him there in the forest, Draco could remember the look in his eyes. Jordan had noted the change in dracos posture, how content he seemed in solitude, and draco had felt fear and relief  swamp him. Fear that he was so revealing, that he had let his guard down, that someone may have been able to slip between the plates of armour Draco wore round the clock. And relief that he might have found someone to shed it with.
He made his way over to the roses, careful not to stand on anything that might be a herb, he didn't want to disturb their secret little sanctuary. He stopped to inspect some mushrooms, their little pink caps stood out, almost glowing in the dim lighting immediately outside the clearing. It was strange the sudden difference in temperature as well, there were more bugs too hidden away in the shade of the forest.
Harry shaved quickly and put on Ginny's deodorant because he was out, slipping on black jeans a size too big and a grey button down he had been wearing all week, hitting it with a quick cleaning spell. to overcome his hair he had grown it out and it tied up easily and cleanly now, short hairstyles just didn't suit him as well. On his way back to the kitchen he knocked on Luna's door before pushing into her room, a mess of painted walls and pot plants and things suspended from the ceiling. she was good to live with, maintaining the little wizarding garden outside joyfully and providing some tranquility and bizarre relief from Ginny's overwhelming moods. she wasn't the cleanest house mate, nor did she make for the best conversation or cook very well, but she was a lovely soul. Harry often thought of her as a mermaid, lost from her ocean home but curious and knowledgeable about the world in ways no one else was.
Ginny groaned and rolled around on the grass to wake herself up. Luna joined her, together they flattened the greenery and fussed around more than was necessary.
Then Harry did the unthinkable, probably because he was a little content and tired and high, and held the cigaroll out to draco. who , to his credit, did very well at hiding his shock. He inspected the best approach to the situation quickly;
to be in his life anymore.
"honestly i don't understand why you get so worked up about it," sean was saying, scratching down the notes their potions teacher was putting on the board. The potions professor was a stout little woman, in her late thirties and far from bubbly. Mis Vermont was american, she was strict and rough edged but spoke well, Harry found himself enjoying potions a little even, personality aside. He could actually learn from this woman.
Harry saw draco twitch in his peripheral vision, his mouth was opening and closing like he was short of breath as he searched for some words to say. When none came he took a sip of brandy and looked down into his lap. Harry took a swig from his own glass and set it down on the floor to pick at the skin around his thumb nail that had been annoying him all day.
“What now?” Draco looked at him, still stirring rhythmically, “what did you do wrong?” he snapped his fingers at Harry and pointed to the chopped bore root which Harry handed to him.
“Don't be useless ginny, give me the bag!” Harry yelled, a bundle of yellow centered flowers clutched in his arms. There was what could only be called a
"did you bring a cauldron?" He turned to Harry, examining his mish matched outfit. He had a red collared shirt under a thick black jacket with wooden buttons and a terrible thin knitted scarf in purples and browns. To top it off he was wearing corduroy trousers. but he looked good in it somehow. Maybe it was the olive skin and the soft green eyes, and Draco found himself shivving his imagination for thinking such sentences.
“You haven't even met his cat luna, it could be a horrible beast for all you know,” ginny spoke up, letting her grin shine through in her words, “malfoy would only tell you the good stories of his cat, he's too proud to admit the thing probably shits inside or something,”
“Come sit down,” Ginny said, sensing Harry's discomfort. She had pulled a singlet over her head when draco had walked in, not quite as comfortable as luna was with being half naked around… guests. Harry supposed fair was fair, and he shouldn't really be freaking out quite so much. He had been in draco's house not twenty four hours ago, sipping sweet tea out of draco's matching muds. But there was something different about the stylish, matching, almost clinical setting of Draco's house and their mismatched and roughened home. It was more personal and connected, their shared home was warm and inviting, the kind of house that welcomed guests, while dracos house was cold and serious, the kind that encouraged tidiness and formal conversation. Harry felt split open and exposed and he held Ginny's hand while she wrote down her notes.
“Ok, alright, so these three never actually cook anything right?” draco looked completely baffled, he waved his empty glass at the T.V, “what audacity! They just judge everyone's meals!” he hollered. Harry and Draco were well on their way through the bottle of bourbon, tucked up next to one another on the couch watching masterchef. It was a nice little couch, draco had bought it thinking the cream colour would match the rest of his living room well but as it turned out the style was completely off. It was too plump and rounded for the rest of the decorations and articles in the little room but hadn't been culled yet for something more stylish because it was so tremendously comfortable. It was a luxurious two seater, perfect for laying down with your head on one arm rest, and more than big enough for two people. Yet somehow Draco had found himself half on Harry's cushion pressed up against his side unashamedly yelling at the television where a large man was scolding his new favourite chef for over cooking a piece of meat. In any other state, a sober state for instance, draco would be ashamed of such an outburst. But he felt lightheaded and stupid and confident.
“Very well,” Professor Snape nods, then his face softens and he leans in. “I’m glad you’re both alright. Be very careful next time. We may have to discuss whether you going into Hogsmeade regularly is a safe idea.”
“Mr. and Mrs. Granger, your home is Granger House and can be found at 16 Heathgate in Hampstead Garden Suburb.” He turns to Hermione, “it’s up to you, I suppose, but would you rather stay here or at one of the properties?”
“It seems to me that Miss Umbridge has gotten her information out of works intended to be taken as fiction, rather than bothering to consult any scientific literature. In fact, it was well known before the mass introduction of muggleborns into wix society that werewolves are perfectly safe human beings at all times other than the night of the full moon, at which point, they should lock themselves away or, in this advanced day and age, take the Wolfsbane Potion.
“It’s interesting how you say ‘we’ have a busy day when we both know I’m the only one with work to do,” Hari grumbles.
“Lead the way,” Hari waves towards one of the staircases. Critter scurries down it and walks to one of the rooms—the last in the hall.
There’s a long beat of silence following his proclamation.
“But if every Worldly Seer Sees differently…” Hari drifts off, letting Draco fill in the blanks.
“Of course I will,” Hari agrees immediately.
“Other misbehavior would lead to being locked in the cupboard for a set amount of time without food or water. Dudley, the son, was encouraged to play games called ‘Harry Hunting’, in which I would be chased around the neighborhood until I was caught and then beaten mercilessly. It was seen as character building for Dudley.” Blaise’s lip pulls into a sneer, but he nods to Hari to continue. Hari heaves a quick breath and moves on.
“Never quite as beautiful as you, though,” Draco replies and tugs Hari back into him. They settle against each other, resting back against the pillows and staring quietly out the window, content in each other’s presence.
“It’s perfect.”
You're welcome! :D
I'm attending school online now, from home, and am working five days a week. I have a membership to a kickboxing club and go to classes three days a week. I'm making changes to my diet and making sure to drink plenty of water every day. I've assigned myself a bedtime and get up two hours before work every day, which actually leads to a pretty relaxing morning. While I am not seeking out medication, which I have used previously, making these changes has actually helped me quite a bit. I have a pretty rigid schedule and it really helps. I'll be making sure to make room for writing between batches of homework.
“I’s be creating a spell that shows Heir Hogwarts the way,” the elf declares. He snaps his fingers once and a purple line appears on the ground for Hari to follow.
Hermione hadn’t yet learned to snap her fingers, so it takes her a little longer to catch on, but soon enough, Critter is standing in her sitting room.
“What snacks is Heir Hogwarts wanting?”
Hari looks for Narcissa in the gallery and she offers a small smile and nod. He responds in kind, relieved to know he had done well.
“They,” Draco coughs a little, “provide the genetic material, which is then combined into a donated, blank egg. There is then one of two options. A potion can be used to cause one of the men to develop the appropriate organ to carry the child himself. Or an artificial womb can be used, one outside their person. The second is the most common option and is actually sometimes used by other couples, who don’t technically need assistance with fertility. It’s a safe alternative to being pregnant in public. The womb can be cared for at home and the parents can carry on with their usual lives without changing their habits.”
. Draco thanked luna politely, suddenly unsure of where to put the flower. He fumbled with it for a second then slipped it into his satchel, in one of the side pockets where it shouldn't get lost. He looked up and turned red, realising luna had been watching him. She smiled politely and grabbed draco's sleeve to pull him over to an empty bench where they could work.
outside of school.
Draco re discovered what friendship could mean over the week. He shared a workbench with Harry in potions, and even got to know Sean who had an eye for brewing. It was no wonder Harry copied his notes. When he went to the library to study, Ginny gave him a nod from her table and draco went to sit among the old Gryffindors, it was becoming less awkward, Ron had even given up the bickering and suspicious glances and settled down a little. He was terribly distracting and had to get up every five minutes it seemed to move around. Luna had asked him to go around to her flat on wednesday and he had sat in between her and harry on the couch watching masterchef it was nice, really nice actually, harry's warming charms really were something, he had felt kind of hot with the two of them pressed up against his sides. Or perhaps it had been Harry's thigh against his own, their shoulders brushing against each other when one shifted to sip  their whine.
“I found some more mushrooms,” Harry told luna, setting his bag down on the bench. Draco raised an eyebrow at him, and Harry corrected himself, “actually Malfoy found them, but he doesn't know what they are so I picked them for you.”
"help potter catch up would you?" mis v sayd, leaving them to yell at myrtle for dropping a bottle of fly wings. Harry looked at malfoy and tried out a smile which looked more like a grimace. draco returned the look and rubbed his temples.
Draco malfoy was standing in his doorway. Harry's eyebrows knitted together and he took a startled step backwards, taking in his whole form to make sure he was real. Black leather shoes, tailored pants, dense felt coat over a blue collared shirt and his stupid slicked hair ever grees to top it off. But he didn't look bad, Harry had to admit even to himself draco was a man of good taste. Still, there was the dilemma of him being in Harry's doorway smiling politely at him casually clasping a hemp tote bag by his side.
Harry shrugged, "I suppose the regular amount of hungry," he said, slipping out of his jacket for the first time that night. The green knitted sweater was too tight on him, it hugged his body and showed off his thin waist in a way that almost made him look feminine, or maybe it was the low neckline, except he had strong arms and a broad chest and shoulders and draco spent a moment too long pondering what it would be like to fit his body against harrys. The sweater was a shade deeper than that of his eyes, it really suited him.
Draco wrote back to pansy on wednesday evening after returning from a flustered night watching some nonsense cooking show pressed up against harry. Still feeling the effects of a few glasses of white, he probably shouldt have apperated in hindsight, he had recommended the show to pansy and confessed his feelings about harry to her. Then, apon prof reading, he had started the letter over. The owl took off with a short parchment and half a dozen rose petals at around twelve thirty am and draco had gone to bed and wanked.
Dracos nose was almost numb, the night was cold and dark, the moon hidden behind thick clouds. He could see lights from neighboring houses a dozen or so yards away, dim and warm. The street was light by a few scattered streetlamps attracting moths, draco thought he saw a bat fly through collecting insect snacks. It was peaceful outside, the gravel of harry and ginny and lunas drive crunching underfoot.
"don't throw it out. I'll plant some chives in there," Harry mumbled, wiping his hands cautiously on his pants before fishing the pottery out of the trash to place gently on the windowsill next to the other herbs he had growing there, most in actual pots. "also i wont go blind, i'm already blind, and mollys are just being theatrical."
“Is it your turn for a study session with malfoy?” she asked, nibbling on the end of her pen. Harry had gotten both of them onto the wonders of bic pens, and neither had looked back at quills since, although they still prefered rolls of parchment and Harry had to admit it was good for shopping lists.
Jordan slid a hand over dracos thigh and squeezed it firmly. It was a form of nonverbal communication they’d developed. Some glances across the great hall during meals meant
“I hate that little lip in the doorway too,” Luna said, reading Harry's mind. Harry let luna pull him to his feet and joined her on the edge of a wooden garden bed. She patted his hair, picking grass out of it and apologising for having put it there in the first place. The air was chilly and little nocturnal bugs were waking up and flitting about, glowing in the dimming light. Luna smelt like lavender oil and hazelnuts, she pulled a joint from her bra and held it out for Harry to light. He picked at the dormant tomato plant behind him as she smoked, the front wispy pieces of her hair singing on the glowing end. Harry tucked them behind her ear for her gently.
"but when you're off doing extracurricular at school and what not it's such a hassle.." she probed him with a finger in the ribs, whining and sliding around the couch. "you can catch up on it when you get back, what's wrong with that?"
Harry pulled a dandelion out rather aggressively, the leaves separating from the roots. He grunted and started digging into the tough soil with his fingers. “How long is your ‘while’ luna?” he asked, grasping the roots and tugging them free. Dirt flicked up into his face and he spat it at the ground. He saw some of it sinking into his tea and moaned, tipping the cup out.
Luna was still mumbling her nonsensical song, holding a finger out for the glowing bugs to land on. The sky was dark now and the air was closer to frosty than chilled, but Harry felt warm where his fingers rested on ginny's shoulders, her hands covering them, and he knew what fondness really was.
“good to get to know you a little,” she said, “you’re not that big of a pratt anymore.”
"Yes, actually, he has many," Harry pulled his hand away and looked at draco squarely, tucking the necklace back into his sweater. Draco dropped the smirk, he hadn't meant anything by it, he had just been joking around really.
"My day studying  with Malloy, he seems more… manageable than he used to be," Harry murmured, starting to feel both light and heavy from the drugs. He smiled to himself a little, "Malloy has a chubby cat called brendon or brenton or something."
draco thought,
"Your necks warm, give me a kiss," Harry complained. Ginny grinned devilishly and turned around, grabbing the sides of his face with wet soapy hands and kissing him roughly on the mouth. Harry laughed and leaned into her, she was so warm he could forgive her for the dirty sudds dripping into the collar of his sweater.
He felt lethargic and heavy suddenly, with the burden of what he had just done. The weight of the sleeping drought finally pulled him under its wing and he slept soundly in his own filth until dawn.
Harry thought stupidly. He followed him into the kitchen, setting his glass down on the sink and washing his hands while draco rooted through a draw. He produces a little plastic pack of fabric bandaids, muggle brand from a pharmacy. Harry smiled at them, so draco did explore muggle streets. draco passed him a towel to dry off, the bleeding wasn't bad any more, it had mostly stopped actually. But Harry watched draco tear open the little packet with his slender fingers and obediently held out his hand. The soft pads of malfoys fingers held him gently as he wrapped the bandage around the tiny wound and pressed the sticky material down firmly, smoothing it over his finger. Draco couldn't look Harry in the eye, he was pretending to concentrate on the bandaid as he held Harry's hand in his own, smothering Harry's fingers between his warm palms. Harry watched him curiously, experimenting with how far draco was willing to push their unsure relationship. It was a cruel and useless game of chicken that would end with them getting hurt that Harry couldn't quite help himself but to play. It excited him, some disgusting, twisted part of his being felt glee that he was finally able to inflict some karma, to torment Draco as he had done to Harry all those years ago.
"lunas rubbing off on you," ginny rolled her eyes at him and went to sit in her chair. Ginny's chair was an old fold out armchair that did not close any more, salvaged from a removal truck doomed for the tip. it was layden in quilts and knitted blankets like a colourful bird nest and she didn't like other people sitting on it, disturbing the careful arrangement she had set up just right. Harry called her goldy locks, Ginny had no idea what that meant, and Harry had told her the story to which she had just laughed at and called silly.
“Draco is rather polite isn't he,” Luna said out of the blue, shucking grass seeds and nibbling on them. Ginny burst out a short laugh and Harry scoffed at her, then considered the statement for a moment and found himself in agreeance. He had been polite, all year at school Harry had observed this out of character behavior being displayed in the classes they shared. He had been polite and reasonable and he was a good potions teacher, not that he would ever admit that out loud to anyone.
Jordan was tall and stocky, he was pale and freckled and angular. Draco weakened when his voice dropped to a low whisper, or when Jordan's sandy curls fell over his eyes. He liked to count his freckles, the ones that spotted the bridge of his nose and eyebrows and covered his arms. He looked good in knits and sweaters and the colour yellow draco discovered over the short months of their secret relationship.
Harry could smell the sage in their garden and the pot he and luna had growing under the house and the earth beneath him and felt whole and connected for a precious moment. He liked to collect these moments, to look back on later when things got a little disconnected.
“Malfoy’s here,” Harry told Luna, raising an eyebrow at her which was ignored. Ginny perked up though, looking at luna curiously.
"Come on, it will be a little adventure," luna ran a hand over each of their heads, "it'll be fun!"
“You had a good day,” Luna told Harry, dusting nothing of his shoulders and blowing on his face. Harry had just gotten home, he was still wearing his jacket, standing in the doorway waiting for Luna to finish her ever changing greeting rituals. She grabbed his hand and sniffed his fingers, raising an eyebrow at him and twisting his fingers into a fist. She patted his knuckles, “Come smoke with me,” she said and pulled him to the back door.
“Oh. Uh, okay.”
After a couple of seconds contemplating his next words, Draco responded. “I love him. Harry that is. I love Harry.”
He would never forget this birthday. It was completely, utterly, unparalleled.
It was weird to have two friends now. Pansy and Harry. Two unlikely candidates that chose to stick around with him. Well, Pansy had definitely been more likely to befriend him, and before they had really become friends, she’d already been his acquaintance for a while. Though, she had more respectable friends to hang out with, she chose him. Harry chose him also. Even though the circumstances were rather extenuating.
Drys Kaspian or Olive Brightly could have possibly created the spells, keeping the plants alive. It was a likely idea, since their names were scrawled on the door which allowed him and Harry entrance into the Garden.
person about what occurred after therapy. He really just wanted to be left alone with his thoughts for at least a little bit.
“What happened after everything went black?” Draco let out, almost against his own will. “I mean, what happened when I passed out, or almost died, that is.”
“So, listen. I’m sorry about what I said earlier. I think we should stop insulting each other for now on, if we actually want to accomplish anything. We’re the only ones awake. We have to accept that fact. We’re on our own.
Draco turned his full attention to Pansy. “Why did you walk in with
But he was sure Harry wouldn’t have left Draco’s side. He was the one who constantly insisted on enforcing the rule that the two of them should never split up.
“Draco.” He felt Harry’s hand touch his shoulder slightly, and even though the contact came as a surprise, Draco didn’t flinch. “I’ve known you since… forever. I honestly can’t imagine my life without you in it.”
“I thought you said you would still be up by the time I got back?” She mused.
Harry shrugged. “I’m observant.”
Was the last sentence written on the note in Wynn’s horrible handwriting.
Draco was just about to measure out the right amount of knotgrass that needed to be added, when Potter moved back his right elbow a little bit too much, resulting in him knocking off the jar of fluxweed from the table. There was a loud crash, and everybody in the room turned to face them. Draco felt a flush creep across his cheeks, and he guessed the scar on his face appeared bright red.
His worst nightmare had been thinking that Harry wouldn’t want any kind of future with Draco. But the real nightmare began when Harry wasn’t even around to make that decision.
“I mean nothing, you look… good.” Potter realized what he’d just said, and started blushing. Draco felt his own cheeks start to burn too. Potter, who was Draco’s enemy, before their truce, had said he looked
“You deserve someone who sees you for you. Someone who knows the good and the bad parts of you, and accepts it.” Harry was so, so obviously talking about himself, even though he didn’t outright say “Me,” or “I.”
It took him about a week to understand that he, himself, Draco, was the person making him unhappy. He truly was his own worst enemy.
. Possibly the last thing he wanted to talk about with McGonagall. And, honestly, he couldn’t care less about the special terms and conditions.
Draco’s hands slowly slipped into Harry’s hair, gripping his locks and loving how
Harry was so fucking wise. Draco thought briefly, he could easily be the next Dumbledore with all of his wise-ness.
He went on, “That is, if you brew it correctly.”
For the hundredth time in the past two weeks, the world stopped. The snow stopped falling and the wind stopped blowing. The only other two things besides Harry that he was aware of, was the Anemonlea flower still in his hair, its bright petals bringing his mind right back to Harry, and the red gem touching his bare chest, humming softly.
“Yeah yeah, we know.” Potter gave a soft chuckle. “Listen, I just want you to know, I won’t tell anyone about… you’re secret,” he coughed. “It’s safe with me, I promise.”
, like he had wanted to do before, inside the venue, he actually
Draco narrowed his eyes. “Alright… Well, uh, so tomorrow.”
Draco stood in shock. “What?”
Blaise gave him a look. “Sure you will.”
“I have to use the loo, excuse me,” Draco said after a while. They nodded to him briefly before returning to their talk about racing brooms. Pansy was too pissed to care about the topic.
Draco believed time had truly frozen. They both didn’t move at all. Draco was sure he and Harry both stopped breathing, maybe even blinking too. Their faces were just
“God, Draco,” Harry murmured.
Harry led the way into the room, and settled at a spot directly in front of the fountain, setting down the basket and the black box thing that was possibly called a radish. The word didn’t seem entirely correct, but he felt it was close enough.
“Stop lying to your best friend.”
“Okay then, let’s go.” Potter declared, and set off in front of Draco through the doors. Draco immediately went to catch up to him, since he was
“Ha ha, well funny story. I didn’t really pay any attention in that class. So, I really don’t know anything about Space.”
Which, consequently meant that there were no other distractions aside from Harry, possibly the most distracting entity in the universe. For more reasons than one.
He didn’t know if that was due to Draco taking off so suddenly, the shock of it all leaving Harry standing stock still, until he was composed enough to run after Draco, or, if Draco was simply running too fast for Harry to catch up. He felt like he was running fast. It was probably the fastest he’d ever run in his life, not counting the time when he and the other Death Eater’s had to flee the Astronomy Tower, after Snape had killed Dumbledore.
Harry gave the faintest of smiles. “It's me, Draco. It’s me.”
“Yeah? What’s that?”
Draco urged to embrace Potter-
Draco shrugged, finishing writing down the last couple words. He couldn’t believe it, either.
Draco honestly didn’t fully understand it. The idea that Potter was being pleasant towards him now, when that morning he had called Draco a name he absolutely hated hearing. Though Draco supposed he had also been pleasant towards Potter at Hogsmeade. He guessed they were both trying, even if they didn’t know they were. Maybe Potter was trying a bit more than Draco, but whatever. It wasn’t Draco’s place to offer to
Although, what Draco was planning on telling her might just add salt to the wound.
Sure, the Figure really could have been throwing empty threats at Draco. Maybe Harry was right, and maybe nothing would happen Sunday. But Draco was too much of a coward to think otherwise. Too much of a coward to defy yet another person who had taken advantage of him.
“We shouldn’t split up. That’s always a bad idea. Have you ever even seen a horror movie?” Potter said.
He didn’t have any intention of talking anymore, but his mouth seemed to have other plans. “I’m just- so tired. So so fucking tired of this whole mess.” Draco put his head in his hands. “I’m just such a horrible person, I could probably write an essay worth ten pieces of parchment describing what a- what a-”
Predictably, the room appeared exactly how it was during the Curse, and Draco inhaled sharply.
The door to Draco’s room was opened; he had left it that way the last time he had entered the dorm to see if anyone had woken up, and he walked determinedly towards Theo’s four-poster, Harry still following his lead.
He clenched and unclenched his fingers, his nails digging deep into his palm.
“Yeah, but we banged on all of the doors. I’m pretty sure someone would have come out to see what the commotion was all about…”
“Er- Madame Pomfrey?” He cringed as he spoke. He reminded himself of when he had been five years old, and would slip into his parents room, waking them up from a deep sleep because he was afraid of monsters under his bed.
Ginny waved her toast at him carelessly in a way of saying
They were feeding off each other. Harry was suddenly aware of draco, like a new zit he couldn't stop touching he found himself glancing up whenever he moved. He knew where draco was at all times, when he entered the room and where he sat and who he spoke to. He felt slightly suspicious in an irrational way. Harry knew Draco was different, that he had changed a great deal after the war, that he hadn't
Draco had heard about texting, virtual mail sent instantly between devices. He'd asked pansy about it in their letters but her family was rather conservative and she didn't think they'd approve of her purchasing muggle technology. He'd told her it would make their conversations so much easier but there was a bit of nostalgia and romance in owl mail so he hadn't pressed too much. He had a new freedom that pansy and some of the other conservator puebloods didn't, without the guidance of his family and with the disdain of the wizarding world draco was free to explore as he wished, and muggle things were suddenly a whole lot less forign. Watching Harry use a phone made him curious about getting one himself, it couldn't be that hard if potter was able to use it.
harry nodded and slung his jacket over his shoulder, "sounds good,"
Harry had noticed draco staring. He kicked himself, wincing in embarrassment, that he had actually offered draco a smoke. Like an idiot, Draco had stared at him, visibly confused, and Harry thought he had maybe only been that self conscious once or twice before. He looked down at the cat who was rubbing itself against his ankles and shook his head.
"Can I kiss you?" Harry's voice sang out in his head.
Harry accepted a delicate mug of tea which he insisted draco didn't put enough honey in and perched awkwardly on the edge of a chair. They were on the little wooden balcony that looked out at the forest, a small latch gate leading down petite stairs to a path on the left side. Hanging plants swung lazily from the gutter and a fat white cat had come out to join them. He and draco stared intently at the hour glass on the table, avoiding eye contact and otherwise ignoring each other. Draco pulled up a seat, quite intentionally but subtly, away from Harry and sat down with his own mug. The cat rubbed its face against his thigh and gracefully swung its body onto his lap.
“You didn't get me anything,” ginny said. She pulled herself out of her chair and flicked a drying charm at Harry who thanked her quietly.
Ginny nodded, cooing at him gently like a wounded puppy, “as much as i'd like to see everyone punished for the terrible things they do, you have to know people move on and change,” she kissed the top of his head tenderly and added in a whisper, “surely you can understand.”
“Do you mind if i collect some of those?” draco asked luna, pointing at them. She was sitting on the ground shucking grass seeds and scratching her legs. She followed his finger and craned her neck to see over the tall greenery, and nodded absently, laying back down. Draco supposed that was a yes.
draco studied him with an eye, the other concentrating on the potion making sure to stir it appropriately. "first door to the left," he said, nodding at the short hall. Harry thanked him and pulled himself towards it, grasping at the wall for support as if his knees would give out at any moment.
"let me copy your notes, i like your layout,"
Harry thought about malfoys cold wet kiss, and about how tender Ginny was. He didn't want to hurt her, or for her to think anything less of him, that he could just mouth off at draco for being a murdering death eater and then confess to letting draco kiss him. What a confusing contradiction. Harry left it as it was, he nodded into ginny's shoulder and she rubbed his back and laughed at him for being an idiot.
What was he thinking? Maybe in a different life things would have been different, but in this one all he could hope for was uninterrupted nights to himself and his dreams, and for another person to appear in them.
"stop doing that," Ginny swatted at his chest, inspecting the mug closely.
“Where are you planning on strolling?” draco asked the safest question that came to mind, looking round for people who might be listening in. but everyone seemed busy with their own conversations, and concentrating on not being poisoned by the little seedlings they were burying in larger plastic pots.
Draco had to agree, it was pretty cool. Everyone knew about the basakisk that had lived under the school for however many years, that harry had fucking
“Maybe I did, you don't know that. Maybe it's a surprise,” Harry told her, pulling his chamomile jars out of their pantry where he kept spare mesh bags. He upended his bag and began picking through the flowers, discarding the stems in the compost bin. Draco watched him, his clever fingers knew the action well and he found himself helping out. Wedged into the small kitchen space next to Harry, their elbows brushing together, they worked through the pile of flowers and chatted.
"Yeah, there's some in the fridge," Ginny told him pointing with her elbow, "help yourself."
“Okay, “ Harry sipped his tea and picked at his nails, “he's a bit fat,” he said, nodding at the cat. Draco looked down, his features pulled upwards, and nodded in agreeance.
Draco malfoy took a swig of the sleeping drought he and harry had made together and lay down in bed, tucking the blankets in close to his sides. He thought about the word
"so i've been thinking..'' Ginny started, wriggling around to sit next to Harry pressed up against his side. Harry raised an eyebrow at her, sipping his coffee curiously. "when the new season of masterchef starts.."
"Potter, Callum, are you done?" Mis V pulled a face at them, slinging her large fists up to rest on her hips. She had yellow lipstick on today which suited her, Harry noted, and nodded his head.
Harry, trying to focus and not look quite so scandalised, snuck a peak and Sean's paper and copied his notes. He was far more organised and straight to the point than Harry was. "it was our thing though, we watched it together, and now im being excluded,"
Harry pushed him away, shaking his hands free from dracos and gripping his shoulders. He looked draco in the eyes, his expression verging on anger and bewilderment. Harry shook his head. Draco found it more terrifying that he wasn't saying anything, that he wasn't verbally expressing his disgust. He would have prefered Harry to be terrible, to tell him off for being so bold, or express his distrust in Draco after everything he’d done. But Harry was having his own crisis of morality. He too had done some terrible things, and it was more confusion that gripped his throat than anything else in that moment.
Ginny was ever merciless with her teasing, but draco found he didn't mind. It had gotten on his nerves back at Hogwarts, sure, but he could tell she wasn't heartfelt in the insults. She shared much the same humor as Harry, but with a little less of his charm. Although draco might have been a little subjective. Luna went to bed after she washed her mug out, kissing them all on the cheek to say goodnight, even draco. He found it sweet, a little tenderness he hadn't had in his life for a while. It reminded him of how lonely he sometimes felt.
there was a drought coming in through the window, a small section of it was missing and rimmed in small cracks. It let the late autumn air into the toasty classroom and Harry scowled at it. he was sitting his catchup years at a small wizarding school newley set up in Valleyton shire, a little wizarding community on the outskirts of Arberdeen enclosed by thick forest and deterrent trees that warded muggles from wandering willy nilly in and out of the area. there was a small community of centaurs that lived among the wizards, displaced from the war but otherwise content with the new surroundings. Many of the sixth and seventh year Hogwarts students who had fought in the war and couldn't bear to return had moved out there to redo and complete their final years of schooling. In light of the war several dozen houses and units had been erected on what used to be old farm land long abandoned, complete with a new movie theatre and electricity run off from the surrounding muggle townships. Harry found the shire to be a little enclosed sanctuary of well run community spirit and fresh nature, a fair comparison to the dystopia of the past.
Luna appeared out of nowhere and handed draco a yellow set of gloves to
but would she consider draco in that way?
Draco emptied the vase of dead flowers that had been sitting on his kitchen counter in the corner for longer than they should have and washed it out quickly. It was far too big for the single stem, so he strunk it, praying it wouldn't crack like pottery sometimes did.
When he approached, he rested his arm on Potter’s shoulder, and sighed deeply.
"what happened to your face?" Harry asked, uncorking a bottle of brandy. He looked around for a measuring cylinder and Draco handed him one without being asked. it made Harry's stomach churn and he grimaced, accepting it from draco.
“How uh,” draco started, not sure where the sudden need to fill the silence came from, “how are you doing in history class?” he asked stupidly. Harry gazed at him, his head lulled back and forth with idiot serenity. He considered his answer for a minute, wiping his face with his hands and scratching the cat behind the ears. His only answer was a shrug for a time.
Draco malfoy watched the cats chase each other across the little animal tracks they were walking on. He hunted through the foliage with his eyes for plants he recognised, he stared at the ground for roots and stones that night trip him up, he looked at luna when she spoke to him, at birds when they made sounds and little magical creatures as they went about their day. He looked everywhere except at harry, who was walking in front of him in his stupid jacket and stupid washed jeans with his hair tied up stupidly in a terrible bun. God draco thought he was stupidly gorgeous, the kind of effortless gorgeous that you see in people right after a shower, or in the rain, or at the beach.
Harry smiled politely, "I might have some for breakfast," he muttered. Harry wrapped his arms around her waist and buried his face in the crook of her neck, breathing in her toasty smell. Ginny wiggled and made little sounds in her throat, "your nose is cold!"
Luna nodded, swaying with the head motion, "Yes he's mentioned the cat, we're good friends in herbology class." Harry was sure she was exaggerating  the
"No, actually it's Ron's fine work," Harry said.
“I, uh, was going to pick some of those roses,” draco told him, “that’s cool, yeah?”
Harry shook his head, pulling his shirt up to wipe the dirt off his face. Draco didn't like him, “draco doesn't like me,” harry had a girlfriend, draco knew that, “i have a girlfriend, malfoy knows that,” and besides, harry was pretty sure draco was strait last he checked, “and i'm pretty sure the gits strait.”
"What, ah.. what music do you like?" Draco asked out of the blue. Harry frowned at him almost pittingly. draco turned away embarrassed and drank from his glass.
The creek was more of a river draco discovered. The trail they were on broke out into a small clearing, perfectly round. It was in a ring of standing stones Luna explained in her way with too many words, most of which were made up and unnecessary. The standing stones had some magical property and hers grew bizerkly in their centre. For some reason unbeknown to draco the sun shone through the clouds in the space and the branches of the trees that rimmed the clearing curved around the circle as they grew, completely unobtrusive of the area. Draco watched Harry drag Ginny down to the water's edge and attempt to throw her in, but she was wriggly and escaped, laughing shrilly. The water was clear and lethargic, draco could see little glimmers of fish, their metallic scales reflecting the afternoon sunlight.
Harry’s hand locked together with his own sent a bolt of lightning coursing through Draco’s veins.
“I got some food--” he gestured to the plates he now held in his hands-- “is this okay?”
Draco had really hoped Potter would never ask that question, but here they were. He sighed and unwillingly explained to Potter what had happened after their Friday night therapy session. Potter did eventually look down at Draco as he told the story, raising his eyebrows in shock at some parts, but he never interrupted. He never told Potter the part about the cut on his arm, though. Again, he did not need to know everything.
Drys pointed his wand at Draco one last time. Draco felt himself being whisked away into darkness, like what he’d gone through when he was transported to the scene of Olive’s murder.
“You’re my friend,” Harry said simply.
“Can I just see it already?” Draco felt like he was quite literally going to combust with anticipation.
It was officially two Sundays from the event with Drys, and Draco was still in the Hospital Wing. Of course, he hadn’t had much of a choice the first week he was in the Wing, as he was in a half-coma and everyone thought he’d end up dying because he’d been struck by Avada Kedavra.
Draco had no idea what Drys was talking about. What had he done in the time span of retrieving Harry’s blood? What was Draco missing?
He heard voices coming from outside the door, and he quickly gathered up his pyjamas and wand and rushed to the bathroom that was connected to their room.
“Yeah, yeah, where’s Harry?” Harry was the only thing he could think about. He hoped Pansy had invited him, or else this night would be even worse than it already was.
But he could only truly focus on Harry, who he had hurt in countless ways, but was looking at him now with joy. It was obvious Harry was happy about being the one to not receive all the attention for once in his life, but it was also clear he was genuinely happy for Draco. Next to Pansy and Blaise, Harry was one of the only people to know his darkest fears, his greatest desires, and his wildest dreams.
“Normal,” Draco repeated. He hadn’t meant to say it out loud.
“Draco, hey.” Harry’s voice was now a whisper too. He tugged at Draco’s hand slightly. “Hey. Look at me.
“No.” Potter said it so firmly and so surely that Draco let out a huge breath, even though he was still quite skeptical. “Back to the whole ‘Dark Lord’ thing-”
“We created the Garden near the end of the year, working day and night and using spells we had come up with to design a secret room, one that would be filled with light and a mystical atmosphere. On the day that we had finished it, Olive kissed me. We carved our names on the door and set enchantments that would always keep the plants alive and keep the room in an orderly fashion.”
Draco’s eyes widened. “Pansy? Ha! Merlin
“Never,” Harry had responded. He’d kept that promise through it all. His Harry.
Harry elbowed Draco in the side. “Come off it, you ponce.”
But, Draco
“She’s dead, Draco.” Harry’s voice was strained.
Which, truthfully, was a huge shock, given that I’d been hit by the killing curse twice and had died by it once; which I can elaborate on another time. Then you were just… gone. You weren’t responsive, and it wasn’t even like the people under the Sleeping Curse. No breaths, no heartbeat, no reassuring movement of your chest lifting up and down. Just gone.”
Maybe Harry didn’t understand the importance of learning new defensive spells fully, but he was at least motivated, and was glad he had something to do instead of waiting around for the potion to be finished.
“Now I’m confused.”
“Excuse you?”
Harry instantly sat back down. “I wouldn’t dream of it.”
“Now,” McGonagall stated, straightening her robes. “Where were we?”
“Yes, well.” Draco cleared his throat, slightly parched from all the talking. He brought a glass of water to his lips and downed it whole. “Drys was already talented with creating and experimenting with spells all on his own, before he got his greedy hands on Snape’s marvelous book. I bet the book that holds all of Drys’ personal information on how he created the Garden of Mystics and all his own spells is still in the castle at this very moment…”
“I honestly haven’t thought about it like that before. I haven’t thought about that at all. I think it’s just a bad habit I picked up from after the war. You know, always feeling the need to apologize for everything that happened, feeling sad you couldn’t have done more, even if there really was nothing else you could have done differently to help.”
“Didn’t you just hear what I was doing?” He gestured towards the piles of books in front of him. “Looking through books is a very good way to get information.”
Draco wanted to bring up the moment they had shared when Harry had fallen on top of Draco the second time. But of course, if he couldn’t even bring himself to ask Harry if they were friends, he definitely wouldn’t be able to talk about… whatever had happened between them.
“Hi,” Harry said, looking down at his food.
“You’re the stalker here, Harry. You have a magical map that allows you to spy on everyone in the castle!”
is a fraud?”
“McGonagall told me to come and find you. She wants to see you in her office as soon as possible,” Pansy said.
An array of different emotions flashed on Harry’s face. Draco hadn’t even been sure Harry had known how he’d survived, but now there was no doubt that he knew.
head on Harry’s shoulder, breathing in Harry’s smell that was oh so blissful. He had to lean down the smallest bit, but he nor Harry cared. They kept on holding onto each other, their swaying turning more and more into an embrace where they just stood in the middle of the Garden of Mystics.
If Draco had been the one to accidentally find the hatch that led to the book, he would have boasted about how lucky Potter was to have him around. But Potter did none of that, he didn’t say anything self-righteous, which honestly made Draco have a lot more respect towards him.
Draco looked up at Harry, who was studying the front cover of the book, obviously trying (and failing) to read the latin title.
Draco sighed. “You know that’s not true. And please, Harry, let’s just focus on stirring the potion, alright?”
Now was another perfect time to thank
There was yet another noise, definitely coming from Slughorn’s classroom, and Draco groaned, because he knew he had to check it out. If it really was Theo, maybe he could even enlist him to help Draco find Harry. Surely, Theo wouldn’t pass up the opportunity to save the world’s Savior.
“I’m sorry,” Potter said after he finished chewing.
What was prominent was his happiness. Somehow, some way, he was happy.
“Well then this-” he gestured vaguely at the empty halls around them- “whole thing happens. I feel like it might not be a coincidence. What if the figure in my dream was trying to tell me something? What if it's another Hogwarts student or teacher who’s awake and needs help?”
Any sane, unbiased person would acknowledge the part where
“No. Well, sort of. Think of it as building on an idea.” And so they built on it.
Draco knew he would be a social outcast at Hogwarts, he was expecting it, but he was glad he was away from the manor. That place now haunted his dreams. It was like he could feel the Dark Lord’s presence there, even though he knew that was silly, he was dead.
And so into the Hogshead they went. Draco liked to think that the Hogshead was specifically chosen instead of The Three Broomsticks courtesy of Harry.
very much alive. That story surprised Draco, and after the trials were over, Narcissa had told him she had lied for
“I- I just- I,” Potter gestured to the shelf and to the ground, where there was a pile of ash near his feet.
He would be judged for his past mistakes for the rest of his life. Would never be given the chance to show he had changed.
The vial was right in front of Theo’s lips now, and Draco hoped he wouldn’t have to pry them open to force down the potion. Luckily, as the top of the vial parted both lips, and Draco tilted the vial back slowly, he could tell the potion was going down smoothly into Theo’s throat.
Draco suspected that Harry might be bringing them to the Garden of Mystics, but when they never climbed any stairs, and kept walking forward, twisting through intricate corridors, they came upon the entrance to the kitchen.
“Nothing. It was nothing. Nothing happened, and I’m not shaken up. This is just my normal look.” He tried to sound casual, but he knew his voice did sound a bit shaky.
Draco raked his brain, trying to remember if he
“The title. I just gave it to you.”
He hoped Potter’s unprecedented walk through the snow helped him clear his head, at the very least. He liked to think the stroll was of some significance.
Snape stared at Draco, his expression was of the exasperated sort. “No. The book senses how many people are around. The group in total gets only three.”
together without watching all of his memories throughout the two weeks, he was terrified that they would judge him harshly based on the mistakes he’d made that were voiced aloud by Drys and himself.
had gotten good at reading
He thought he’d cast it correctly, but Harry wasn’t waking up.
The Mark had calmed down, an almost bearable amount of pain crawling up his arm, and Draco knew he had to leave the bathroom and go to bed.
“It’s okay, I didn’t think of it either.”
“Of course I do,” Draco agreed, which made Harry laugh even more. Harry’s laugh was the best sound in the entire universe, Draco concluded.
once again, and his heart was beating rapidly; the rain beating down on him felt heavier.
Love. Four letters. Eight letters if a person was ever brave enough to say, “I love you.” Possibly the most daunting phrase known to Wizarding kind. Perhaps Muggle kind, too.
Using Drys’ journal, which held instructions on how he and Olive created the Garden of Mystics, Draco and Harry had been able to replicate it, adding on their own touches and magical signatures.
Draco gently touched Harry’s cheek. He gently pushed back his hair that covered his lightning scar and brushed his thumb over it. He saw one of his tears fall on Harry’s forehead, trickling down and down.
Draco wanted to protest and tell Drys that he’d done the job; Drys had Harry’s blood now, so there was no need to kill anyone. But Draco hadn’t actually done the job. He’d refused, not even thinking about the possibility that Drys could just
Every part of his body ached and burned, and Draco wished he would be taken under by unconsciousness once more. His eyes briefly flicked to the door of the classroom, that was shut. The lights were off in the room too, which would definitely make it seem like there was nobody in it. No one would come to save him this time.
“I pushed back your sleeve, Draco.” Harry’s voice was filled with so much emotion, it was surely sharp and dangerous enough to wound. “I saw a couple scars on… it. But they were obviously old.”
Draco’s first thought was how similar he and Drys thought of the people they loved. They both loved someone so much, that they knew the difference between a half life and a whole one.
Draco thought in a panic. He pointed his wand at the door, it was a long shot casting an opening spell since she probably warded it with strong magic, but he had to try. “
Ever since the
In barely legible cursive, the name: The Half Blood Prince, was scrawled.
“The universe is too big for that,” Harry said. Draco’s heart convulsed.
on me anyways, though. I nearly risked so many people’s lives because I refused. It was selfish of
“Anyways,” Drys said, “I created a book back in my Hogwarts days that withheld all of the spells and potions Olive and I had made. I left it at Hogwarts all those years ago because it was the past, and Olive and I wanted to start working on a future. But I knew I had to get it back to accomplish what I wanted to accomplish.
He was then escorted to the Ministry, where Drys explained to the Minister that Draco had been the one to kill the Purebloods who resided in Hogwarts, along with Harry Potter. Drys explained how he, himself, had been the one to catch Draco. The Minister thanked Drys, and threw Draco in a holding cell, awaiting a trial where it would soon be decided that Draco would be sentenced to death.
Every morning he made sure his cuff links were in place, and that his sleeve would never roll up unexpectedly. Although he was still always paranoid it would. He couldn’t even imagine someone accidentally seeing the Mark. He would probably just
from, it’s definitely you, so.” He slowly opened his eyes again as he finished.
Draco wasn’t sure of exactly what happened next, but he thought he felt Harry press a soft kiss into his hair. Harry didn’t need to respond to what Draco had just said. The supposed kiss contained a million words that were impossible to say aloud.
“Malfoy, can you tell me what happened?” Granger sounded worried, and her voice was full of distress. He shook his head, he definitely did not want to tell her what happened. He wasn’t going to tell anyone what had happened, except for Pansy. But Pansy wouldn’t tell anyone if he asked her not to, he knew for a fact.
“You guys are fine,” he said.
“I’m only going to Transfigurations with you so you don’t get sent back to Azkaban. I’m not fighting
When Draco was a child, his father would tell him, “Always be brave. Always stand up for yourself. Look your opponent in the eye, and show them
Harry leaned on Draco, his head resting on Draco’s shoulder, and Draco’s head resting on top of Harry’s head.
“I wanted to apologize.”
He hastily secured them on the ends of his jumper sleeve, because he was weak, and insecure, ignoring how atrocious they looked on the nice cashmere material. Not that anyone would see. He was just going to walk around outside in Hogsmeade for the tiniest bit, then leave as quickly as he could to go back to Hogwarts.
“The other thing that’s been bothering me is the fact that I, who had no idea what I was even doing, had been able to escape Drys’ magic. He was terribly powerful and I was horrifically power
Draco more or less felt the presence of another person deep inside him, and sped up his pace down the corridor. It had to be Harry.
been enough to open the book. At least one good thing came from Draco sharing one of his most precious secrets.
He had been sitting on one of the armchairs, in the Slytherin common room, in the furthest corner, when Theo approached him cautiously. Draco had snapped at him, and told him to fuck off, but Theo had stayed. He had said he knew something was up with Draco, and told him if he ever needed someone to talk to, he would be there.
He had done the same to Harry, and he cringed at how inexperienced he had been at giving hickeys. Harry definitely hadn’t seemed to mind or notice, though.
The Kaspian’s both smirked. Which was Draco’s move. Fuck them.
A swarm of owls swooped in through the doors, carrying parasols, newspapers, and letters. A great big grey owl flew right in front of Draco and dropped off a caramel colored letter, with the Malfoy family crest on the front. For a split second he thought it might’ve been another prank letter.
was able to create visions all on his own. It was a lot to think about.
Smith laughed. The others followed right on cue. Draco inspected the group in front of him. It was an odd bunch. Two in Hufflepuff- Smith and Finch-Fletchley, two in Slytherin- Theo and Robins, Brocklehurst was in Ravenclaw, and Kaspian was a Gryffindor. He wondered how on earth all six of them could actually stand being in the same room as another, with fucking
“It certainly is.”
How could things become more confusing as he found out more answers? Logically, it didn’t make sense.
He told the owl where he needed the letter sent to, and it took off with a small
It was that thought, that made Draco the most heartbroken.
Draco had to admit, he felt guilty. He didn’t want to feel guilty, but he did.
battle again.” Potter said without glancing back at Draco.
He nodded his head towards Snape, and was about to turn and make his way out of the office and down to where he hoped Potter was still standing when he heard Dumbledore’s voice echo throughout the room. “Draco, it is good to see you.” His eyes sparkled from behind his half-moon glasses. Draco had always wondered how his eyes did that. He still wondered to this moment.
Potter sat down on a table nearest to Draco and started twirling his own wand in his hand.
“Harry, this is seriously very kind. Thanks for doing this,” Draco said after he swallowed his food.
Draco’s eyes widened. “Did you just speak Latin?
“You’re wearing the necklace,” Harry inquired.
“But, since you foolishly declined, you’ll suffer greatly. And after I’ve had you watch Potter, your parents, and your one minuscule friend- Miss Parkinson- all die, I’ll give you to the Ministry, telling them it’s all your fault for the slow death of everyone at Hogwarts and Hogsmeade, and the slaughter of the Purebloods in Hogwarts. along with Harry Potter’s death. I’ll let them deal with you, and I’ll be the savior, turning in the evil villain. After that, they’ll have to love me and follow me. They’ll be even more willing to back me up on the death of all of the other Purebloods in the Wizarding World, because they'll see how the world has benefitted from them not being around.
“And, you see, Drys could only accomplish all of these things because of Snape’s book, Snape’s
for short.
Draco had brought up the idea that they could use their last question they still hadn’t used up in Snape’s book to find a way to distribute the potion, but Harry had talked him out of that by stating they could still need the last question for something more important.
Draco couldn’t help it, he let out a small snicker. “I mean, he likes both boys and girls.” Was Potter really that daft? Yes. The answer was yes.
Draco rolled his eyes. She always brought up Theo’s name in conversation when she wanted to get a reaction from Draco.
“You know,” Harry whispered, turning his body to face Draco. “It’s okay to cry, Draco.”
Draco had pictured spending the rest of his life with Harry. He pictured lots of kisses and snuggles and late night walks. He pictured a future with lots of cleaning up, and lots of forgiveness, but he’d come to accept that that was okay. He knew things would be messy between them, and they’d have to fight to be together, but as long as they were by each other’s sides, they’d get through life and all its obstacles.
anyone for people to believe it.
The rest of the ride was filled with silence. The cab came to a stop outside some hotel, and Draco wondered if the Muggle car had broken down.
All he wanted from Potter and everyone else in the Wizarding World was a second chance; a chance to show he could be a better person in wizarding society- not supporting the old, and what he realized now, stupid Pureblood ideology.
Thank you all for the lovely comments, and all the hits and kudos, I honestly hoped that I would get at the most five people to read my fic by the end of the first week since I published this, so it really blew my mind that more than 50 people have read it so far! That might not seem like that much, but to me it is! So thank you!
Harry’s hand cupped Draco’s cheek, his finger rubbing the Sectumsempra scar that was there. His other hand made its way into Draco’s hair, and Draco melted all over again.
“You never told me about this,” Harry rasped.
Draco’s heart sped at the idea that Potter was implying he was a talented wizard. That was what Potter was implying, right? “No, I physically cannot cast defensive spells. It’s- it’s part of my probation.” Draco looked down at his hands. “If I so much as start to cast any type of defensive spell, a shock of magic will spread up my arm and the Ministry will be notified.”
“Uhm- well a group of students…” He looked down at his hands, which were folded tightly together in his lap. It was just so
“I cannot believe you guys forced me to go,” he said, also not for the first time.
I'm so excited to write the next chapter and all the chapters after that, because its just going to be Draco and Harry and ahhh! But anyways, hope everyone enjoyed this chapter even though I made Draco suffer quite a bit.
you win, we’ll discuss your reward
“You said I was resisting, though,” Draco commented, “you were talking about my Mark, and how I’m not controlled by you. How is that possible?”
“It’s just, that night you slept next to me, was probably one of the most peaceful nights I’ve had in a long time,” Harry explained.
“Young man, you are extremely underweight. Let me get some food in you,” She scolded. Draco did not argue, even though it was getting pretty late at night and wasn’t anywhere near dinner time.
“We’ll get through it like we always do. Together.”
*****
Despite this being Elizabeth’s first time hearing all this, she only quirked one eyebrow as an indication that she was shocked.
He and Potter had definitely moved into the area of uncomfortable silence with each other once again, and Draco detested it. He didn’t really think it would be possible to fall back into the thick tension with Potter, after everything they had been through together the last couple of days, but he’d been wrong.
have not done anything.” He turned his head to the side, almost like he was looking for something in specific. “He’s simply under the body binding curse.”
“Of course,” Draco breathed, pieces of the story finally coming together. “You were-
“I’d like to talk to you,” he spoke again.
All in all, it was a good life. It was everything he’d ever wanted.
“Mhm. And I’m the queen.”
It was Harry who spoke, and Draco wanted to tell him to just
“Draco?” Harry croaked out. He coughed, and then shivered, and Draco so badly wished he could just Apparate away with him, and live somewhere where no one could ever find them and hurt them. It was such a nice thought, but it would never be true.
Draco felt a wave of hot shame flood throughout his body. Someone, other than Draco, had seen his Mark. Something he vowed to himself would never, ever happen, no matter what.
And so, he hadn’t figured out why Harry was messing with his head so much. He could have brought it up to Elizabeth, along with many, many other details of his sucky life, but he didn’t. Elizabeth understood. Draco felt even more lost, but at the same time even more proud of himself, because just like Elizabeth had said, in some small way, he’d made progress just by showing up.
This chapter was originally going to be 10k+ words long, but then I realized I should just cut the chapter in half, since I've been working on it for about 3 weeks and still am not close to being done. So, basically, here's part 1, and I'll hopefully finish the *better* half soon. Sorry for the long wait!
Draco rotated to face Potter. “What did you say?”
The thing was, he didn’t even have that good of a reason for avoiding Harry. It was mostly self preservation, and the fact that he was scared. He was scared of himself; scared that he was a murderer, scared of his past, and scared of his future. Scared that he couldn’t sort these things out for himself.
“I’m sorry, this is probably extremely weird to you, I don’t know why-”
Draco was looking directly at where the wand had been held, but Harry’s attention hadn’t been held where Draco’s had. Harry was staring directly at Draco, not in a creepy way whatsoever, but in a protective, caring way. The Harry in real life was back to blushing again, and Draco had a feeling it had to do with the words Harry's eyes conveyed in the picture.
Potter shrugged.
“I was so delighted to hear that you wanted to try out one on one sessions!”
“I admit, I was a fool for believing we would be safe living in our house during the middle of a war, a war where Muggles and Muggle-borns were the ones mainly being targeted, but I’d assumed the Ministry wouldn’t let the destruction of hundreds of lives happen. I thought Olive and I had more time. I thought that we could wait until things got really bad, and then flee the country, or continent even.
“What floor are we on?” Draco asked while peering at his surroundings, searching for any indications on where they were. Sadly, as much as he knew Hogwarts, the corridors all looked the exact same to him.
They pulled away as quickly as it had happened, and both respectively cleared their throats, trying not to assess the awkwardness of the situation that had just happened between them.
Draco couldn’t imagine a more perfect day. He was with Harry, and everything was okay.
He was in the Hospital Wing. That was the first thing Draco noticed when he opened his eyes.
“I was wondering, do you have any idea why that is? I mean, why didn't I die?” He finished off at the edge of his seat, literally and figuratively.
Blaise’s eyes mirrored Pansy’s. “Wow.”
He casually stepped into the room, keeping his eyes locked on his destination: his bed and the small area surrounding. Immediately, the voices quieted down and a couple coughs floated through the air.
“Of course it is.”
He felt a single tear roll down his cheek as he finished talking. Just another thing to add on to his list of why he hated life. He now cried all the fucking time, thanks to Harry breaking down his walls.
He knew it was a trap from the moment one of the owls dropped a letter in front of him at breakfast that morning. He had eyed the letter suspiciously, and once he came to the conclusion that the letter itself, was in fact, not cursed, had opened it. The letter had read:
“you have nice hands,” Harry shrugged at him, “just thinking out loud really.” Draco blushed visibly and turned away, it startled Harry a little. “Alright, calm down,” he muttered, taking the weed back and snuffing it out on the bottom of his boot.
“Yeah,” Luna said, she pulled herself out of the garden opposite Harry and made a face at his forehead, “he likes you.”
for him. He would have thought more along the lines of their past, the war and the fact that they were suddenly chumming it up both inside
It wasn't appropriate, it simply would not do to think like that, but his mental battling grew futile and he gave in and slid a palm over the front of his boxers. He could feel warm arms wrap around his body, tough and battle worn and muscular. Harry's calloused fingers dug into his waist hungrily and held draco close against his hot body. a steaming mouth slid down his throat and bit at his shirt Impatiently, draco slipped his fingers between the fabric and pressed against a warm nipple. He could imagine Harry's presence, the space he would take up in his bed, in his room, in the building Draco was making his, a house starting to feel like a home.
