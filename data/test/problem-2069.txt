“No. Just lie to him.” And he wasn’t even sure he had Draco’s trust, to begin with. It was more of a begrudging partnership.
He resigned himself to the experience, tucking the notes away in his jeans. “Does it have to be today?”
,” Ron shouted, jerking her back by the shoulders. The snake reared back a little at their sudden appearance.
The base of it was etched into the shape of a tree trunk, blending into honey-colored wood. When he adjusted his grip, a miniscule shower of red sparks shot from the end. Ron smiled a lopsided smile.
She didn’t say anything else for a minute, until they were safely hidden in an alley. No muggles would see them Apparate. “I’ll just be off then. I’m making dinner tomorrow – no arguments.”
. He’d known Harry because his wand did.
Fluttering paper broke the tension as a memo shoved itself through the transom. Ron caught it out of the air, grimacing at whatever it said. “Residue’s legitimate.”
“And that was enough to – ?”
or plain being arrested on corruption charges. You and Hermione put your heads together and suggested what we do now. Aurors can sort of exist all over, and answer to everyone. No one has too much power.”
“We can’t go to wizard bars,” Harry whispered, pulling a menu over. “According to you.”
“Dead.” Ron said flatly. “In the war. He was just a baby. Tonks’ – erm – his grandmum looked after him until you were…better. Old enough, I guess. She passed away a few years ago. Natural causes.”
“Too bad.” Harry bent and let Castor wind up his arm, helping the main bulk of his body curl around his shoulders. Draco’s eyes narrowed and he stepped more fully out of the hearth. So the big Slytherin himself was scared of snakes. “You can go now, or you can wait for me to finish dinner and I’ll go with you. Have you eaten.”
“I’m unfamiliar,” Hermione said, and it sounded like it cost her something. Draco’s hand smoothed over the dusty fireplace mantle.
“ – and I didn’t remember anything.”
There was a short, very petulant silence. “Second landing,” Draco finally said, like the fight had completely gone out of him. Harry walked forward with slow, short steps.
Teddy’s eyes went comically wide. “
The ripples grew larger, grew agitated. Soreness erupted in Harry’s neck, insidious things shifting beneath the muscle. There hadn’t been light to begin with, but it grew even darker as he squirmed. Pain in his temples. Pressure. A hand. A flame. The darkness flooded, permeating past a simple beast of vision, crushing his insides and blocking his lungs. Like a swarm of mice, it chewed and gnawed its way through him, breaking with sharp teeth what wouldn’t give easily. Remember, the voice said. A strange request, in this strange place.
“So it’s only half illegal,” Harry said. She glared. “Come on, we’re gonna be late to the Broomsticks.”
“May I?” Greenbaum asked. Harry glanced over his shoulder to see Mahmoud nod as she started waving her wand at the ceiling. Ron joined her, giving Harry a pointed look toward the window.
“You’re the eldest son,” Harry said. That’s what primogeniture meant. But wizarding society didn’t work that way anymore.
“But I took my own memories.” He laughed, disbelieving. “Or was that only a mistake? Had I tried to do something worse?”
“Friends?” Brown eyes met his after a long moment. Worried. “You’re still my dad, aren’t you?”
“Another favorite place?”
“We aren’t schoolchildren anymore,” Draco said. He held out the bottle, frowning when Harry shook his head. “I don’t need homecooked meals and friendship to get me by.”
Mahmoud sat, moustache fluttering as he gathered his thoughts and began speaking, long form and lecture-intensive.  “The Pyramids, as you know, are some of the most long-lasting structures in the world. Non-magical folk still debate just how they were constructed, but of course we know. Architectural magic was never very prevalent outside of the Middle East – wizarding kind here moved out of the public eye much sooner. Only the Masonic organizations spread the texts to the west, for the sake of knowledge, and little else.
“He means the Dark Mark,” Ron said in an undertone. Harry looked him over for any such thing, but the robes did a good job of covering his skin.
“Mr. Malfoy,” Élise began, a while later.
,” he shook his head, laughing in his throat. “You
Victoire babbled a laugh, and something in Harry’s chest unclenched. Maybe it was the Veela genes, but he did feel a bit calmer. She reached out to grab at Harry’s nose with fat fingers. He laughed.
Harry went to his office and shut the door, rubbing his arm and reciting the seven uses for unicorn hair under his breath. Then he started on the thirty five variations of holly, looking through the stacks of paper for anything interesting. Departmental reports, mission debriefings…it looked like they’d busted a major illicit potion ring just a few months earlier. That sounded exciting.
Harry still, he realized, had not moved. He did so, clearing his throat in embarrassment. Draco blinked and stepped aboard, fabric swaying all around. The doors slid shut.
“No. We dueled. He’s still Babbling,” Ron explained, squeezing his arm. Harry felt the
She shook her head, pouting out her lower lip. “No.”
Harry froze, pressing the end of his pen into the parchment. She didn’t sound surprised or disgusted or anything like that, so he didn’t find it necessary to refute or agree with her claim. She must have seen his cauldron set up across from Draco’s at Grimmauld Place. While not exactly friendship, that he would voluntarily spend time over there was probably sign enough that things were very different than how they had been before.
“There’s been a mistake,” he said automatically, even though it clearly had his name on it.
” he said, jabbing his wand. Harry didn’t get his own wand raised in time, and his tongue sealed itself to the top of his mouth. He very nearly panicked, then remembered that he could do wordless magic just fine.
It was bad enough she kept pressuring him into this conversation – he could never see when it was coming. “I – I already have!”
help her, she stopped going on these…binges.”
They ate ravenously in quiet for a few minutes, browsing the photos. The fried fish was heavenly, and so greasy he knew he’d feel like shit the whole night. “Find anything at the Archives?”
At some point, he’d had this with Teddy. A chubby, giggling thing that spat up potato and depended on him completely. Now that thing was grown enough to go off to school, and Harry didn’t know anything about him.
“Right.” Harry snatched the note of directions away. He wasn’t sure where his eagerness to get away was coming from. Or his particular curiosity about going out in public…but surely they couldn’t run
though?”
“Sorry, I – “ Her lips tilted in a nervous smile. “You don’t like it when I tidy up in here.”
“Aurors,” a thin, waifish young woman stood to greet them. Harry looked at the scarf that covered her head and draped down her shoulders. The fabric was a lively coral, embroidered in gold patterns, the dress underneath a deep teal that made her golden skin glow.
Harry nodded, wondering which of those he was.
hole he had vowed to stay out of.
“And mine?”
“Is he staying for dinner?” The robed one’s voice was deep and accented. Welsh. “We always alert the kitchens and he ends up leaving before tea.”
“I kept trying to get you to talk to me about it, instead of just taking it out on everyone. I think Élise had to go take a cry once or twice. You worked nonstop, you were drinking alone…”
“So I’m told.” Harry leaned back against the granite. “I…we’ve been getting on. I think. Working together.”
The massive amounts of photographs taken inside Grimmauld Place meant he was somewhat familiar with the kitchen, despite this being his first time actually inside. The long wooden table was the most recognizable feature, but it was empty. No Weasleys or piles of food or Wizard Chess boards.
“I’ve ordered the library cleared for the morning. You should expect quite the crowd.”
“Oh.” Ron sounded disappointed. “Yeah, he loves that place.”
They went through all the spellwork required to keep Draco from a very undignified fate –
“Which part?” Her expression had closed off, shoulders slumping in like her mind was already back at the office.
“Pushing me away.” He silently took on more of Draco’s weight, glad for his strength conditioning with the lads. “Especially when there’s no one around to see it.”
“It’s not me. Not anymore.”
was lit up and blinking words in his direction. Rows and rows of them, each name more ridiculous and intriguing than the last. The second level looked less garish, but it was quite a ways to get to the steps.
He spat the words, almost. Like they stuck in his throat. But it was clearly an effort. “It’s not up to me. I don’t know what to do, I just have this…feeling.”
“Well, I hope that changes,” he murmured.
Quite harshly, she hushed him, setting the oven to simmer as they waited on Ron to return from the Ministry. “It’s alright. You were. Every parent acts a bit different around their children.”
start smoking again. Give ‘Mione something to be mad about, for once.”
A short, incredulous laugh escaped the stranger. “I swear, if you’re somehow taking the piss – “
“What is it?” He turned his gaze down, curiosity turning to a vague dread. Something in that smile was so…innocent. “Did something happen to him?”
There was more, but he stopped reading. It felt like an intrusion. These words were meant for someone else.
“Where will I go for the holidays?” He asked more insistently. “They won’t take me away from you – ?”
It didn’t feel strange at all to cradle the back of his head. “You don’t need to worry about me, Ted. I’m – “
There was one shelf, up high against the wall, that burst with color. He stood, peering up at the strange packaging. There were several boxes of sweets with names that he didn’t…remember, exactly, but recognized. Even more alarming were the names he didn’t understand.
“It’s not only that.” He raised his wand again, looking up at the topmost row of his ancestors. “Those that pass their lives in houses like this leave something of themselves behind. Even with a House Elf, this kind of repair is…exceptional.”
“Sounds good. Hey – “ he stopped her, checking to make sure Ron hadn’t come outside. “Is it all good between you two?”
“Do you?” Less soft, now.
“Wait.”
“Against the Kenmare Kestrels,” he said. She smiled. “Of course I’m coming.”
“I still have to make reports to the Aurors, Harry,” she said sternly, looking at the ground. “The Ministry has a vested interest in your recovery.”
“Yep. Never a dull day in Catastrophes.” He tossed the memo up and it flew away, turning to Harry with a smile. “D’you think anyone told them to check Catford?”
“If he was alone with Harry, what scared him off?” Élise scribbled something out with a quill, oblivious to the tension. “Maybe he was hurt, too. Disoriented.”
,” Molly snapped at the same time, pointing her wand. A stinging hex zapped Ron on the arm. “Watch your tongue in my house!”
“I know it seems like I’m making a big deal,” Ron said, waving away Harry’s argument. “But what scares me more than anything is the thought of it getting to be as bad as it was.”
Her eyebrows shot up. “What is your name?”
“Sorry,” he said.
“It was Unspeakable Granger,” Élise said excitedly. “Only their department knows the specifics, of course, but it was…revolutionary. They told our team the incantation, and it
“Had he never done that before?”
“We did,” Debra said. “We do. But Shacklebolt put the kibosh on any magical interrogation, so…we wait. We watch.”
“No,” he admitted. “But I know it.”
Harry was just barely out of the way. He felt the wind of their speed throw his hair back, and the noise blast his eardrums as they met – crashing so hard they both shattered and rained down on him.
“We’re walking to the Lake,” Teddy informed her. “D’you know where Réne is?”
her husband’s face.
She shrugged. “It wasn’t in his dossier, but…I’d almost guess he was planning on using memories as ingredients in the potion, if the idea weren’t so…novel. I suppose I'll find out.” She sounded very excited at the prospect.
“What do you think of – “ George stopped as the door opened in the other room. The way he snapped his head up sent apprehension through Harry’s chest. Was this a break-in? In a
“I understand,” Harry whispered. Little Hermione, being tortured. It was so horribly wrong. “And this is… I mean, it’s common knowledge?”
For a moment, neither of them moved. Behind Draco, a reception area much like the level above buzzed with people. He’d never seen such a crowd up on Two. The golden script above the lift doors told him this was the Department for Magical Accidents, Catastrophes, and Renovation.
here! Much less London! Harry, what were you thinking?”
“He?”
“Okay?” Ron said, incredulous.
That wasn’t enough. It didn’t feel…paternal? Authoritative? He didn’t know what, exactly, their rapport was.
Harry thought about it, glancing at the window to gauge the time. “Nah, that’s all right. I wanted to send Todd back.”
“No,” Élise said, amused. “We know about Grimmauld Place.”
Hermione didn’t. “That’s not
“I dunno, I think he just wanted some sweets…”
Harry froze at the doorway. “What do you mean?”
“Oh.”
He bit the inside of his cheek and nodded. Harry sighed in defeat, turning back to their food to angrily shake the chicken pan. “You said I was a good father.”
“I didn’t say that.”
“What? Why do you keep looking at me like that?”
name!” Ron cried, evidently forgetting his hatred of the song. “’Mione! That’s my name!”
The door pulled wide open, George standing there as though nothing in the world was wrong. “Harry Potter!” He cried, unnecessarily loud. “What are you
He wondered why she wouldn’t want to help. Maybe George had used Hermione’s vast knowledge for evil too many times. “You couldn’t stop yourself from suggesting it, could you?”
None of it explained how he could have so much money. He asked Fleur about it when she returned, bringing more of the lavender scent with her. She conjured her own tea pensively, switching the needle over to a livelier track. Her robes were white and seemingly imbued with a glowing charm, but maybe just had that effect on things. Even her mug seemed whiter than it should be.
would very much fall into the
Harry did, leaning back down. The snake was poking it’s head out, now, and the flaps near its head were retracted. “Has he been taking care of you?”
The stranger laughed again, humourlessly. “I’m someone in deep shit, that’s who.”
“Don’t,” Draco shut his eyes, “do that. He’ll be long gone.”
There really was nothing for it – he went to the Leaky Cauldron, declining the barkeep’s offer of a pint on the house. And that wasn’t the only offer; three other tables shouted his name. Maybe people he knew, or just people who knew him, but all the calls were sufficiently slurred that he felt fine just ducking his head and hurrying into the alley. They’d probably forget he was ever there.
“Are you accusing me of something?” Draco asked drily from the floor. He leaned forward to prod the cauldron with his wand. It was back to a muddy red color, the acrid smell only barely noticeable. As he moved, a small strip of skin showed above the waistband of his sweatpants.
Harry turned to watch her. The runes, indecipherable to him, glowed menacingly bright
“What’s all that about?” Teddy asked, frowning. “Is she in trouble?”
She nodded. Harry took a second to think, very aware of their eyes locked on him. “You both make it seem like…like I’m an important person.”
“It’s a Tuesday.”
“That’s why your letter was so weird,” he whispered.
“Do I get along with all of you? I mean, as a boss.”
Harry darted forward, remembering how Hermione had instructed him to shut her up should this ever happen. The old woman in the portrait was clearly beyond reason, wailing and rocking back and forth in whatever chair she had been painted into.
“I read,” Harry said, trying to stop Ron from saying any more depressing things. “I’ve been cooking for you and Hermione...I talk to Castor a bit, I clean…I write to Teddy…”
Harry gripped his curtain and reached past Draco’s shoulders, expending massive effort to force them together. Something gave, and it worked.
“Muggle ways,” Harry clarified. “I dunno…prosthetics. Make up. Plastic surgery.”
“A lot has changed, I think we can all agree,” Hermione said to Draco’s back. Her hand found Harry’s again, and for the first time it bothered him. “Do you need anything from me or my department before you start brewing?”
” Teddy huffed, glancing over his shoulder. “Are you leaving, now?”
“Mum,” Ron said. “D’you still have that black pudding? Harry was raving about it – “
“Sorry – “
for you to buy new clothes.”
It was disturbing.
“Oh.” Harry raised his eyebrows. “As of…right now?”
“Oh. Well – “ Carys kept up with him as he went down the long hall to the left, launching into more gardenia talk. Harry stood there in the quiet, looking around. It wasn’t inviting, exactly. Pretty, and elegant. The floors were sparkling black granite, the stairs lined with marble banisters and two carved swans with emerald eyes. The air itself was almost stale. This place had been even grander, in the past. He got the sense all the empty space used to be filled with lavish things. Raids, Hermione said.
“I’ll be gone for the night,” Harry said. Castor managed to look displeased, but nodded his head up and down. “If anyone else comes through the fireplace, just ignore them.” Not that that should be a problem. Ron and Hermione knew to expect him. George…well, at the very least a good scare would do him good. But Harry would be back early.
“They’ll want to know – “
“Hello, you three,” the woman said, looking up at them from underneath the brim of a pointed hat. Embroidered leaves and orange flowers danced back and forth. “You’re looking well, Potter.”
“Sit,” he growled. Draco looked at Harry before he did, his shoulders going impossibly tense as he sank gracefully into the chair. “Harry corroborated your story. No point in questioning you.”
Ron paused in loading up his typewriter. “Have
Hermione stepped back. He hadn’t even seen her get sucked in. Her head had to tip all the way back just to address him.
“What did it say, Harry?” Hermione asked, her eyes wide.
Fuck JK Rowling
“Really hard to find information on those,” Ron told him.
Harry looked up, at the people rushing out of their houses across the street. At the nearby piece of wall that had some sort of symbol on it.
“In the hall closet.”
“Hermione sent me.” He let Sirius’ book
“They never are,” she said sagely, sliding it into her pocket.
But as he lifted the wand to his mouth, a reserve of bravery Harry wasn’t prepared for sort of…took over. Maybe it had something to do with the way Teddy was jumping up and down, hands over his mouth. Ron looked like he’d faint.
Harry could talk to snakes. Actually
Harry hurriedly threw some clothes on, Flooing directly into George’s flat with his wand drawn.
Harry followed him up to the potion room. It smelled strongly of burning tar and cinnamon. More of tar. There was a pile of throw pillows on the floor. Books and stray bits of notes everywhere. Draco threw himself down just as his little stopwatch went off, setting the wine carefully aside and unscrewing a large jar of (Harry took a big step back) angry-looking insects.
“Sure.” He picked up his quill. “Give Malfoy my regards.”
soul?” Ron’s face creased up in concentration. “That’s at least – “
Harry told him. He considered taking Castor with him through the Floo, but that was quite dangerous. Animals were like babies, that way. You couldn’t Floo or Apparate them without the proper precautions.
It was difficult to make the camera focus, at first, but he got the hang of it after a few pages, turning and snapping over and over again. He read a word here and there, but not enough to understand what the book was about. There were probably two hundred pages to photograph, so he barely had time to think as he hurried along.
He still checked the locks, aware of how silly it was. Metal locks were essentially useless next to the protective charms he was sure he had on the property.
“I do talk to Hermione,” he muttered.
one?”
“Thanks!” The bedroom door shut, and Harry took a deep breath, staring into the flames. He couldn’t. Not so soon, at least.
But Ron looked just as shocked. “What?” He asked quietly, almost
It didn’t look broken – that was the beginning and end of Harry’s Auror expertise. But Ron had told him to ‘take charge’, so he walked over to it and looked at the view. It wasn’t a fake window, like the ones at the Ministry. They were well up, at eye-level with the top of the Rolls Building. That put them six levels above the street, on a floor that didn’t appear to exist from the outside.
George sobered, then relented, shifting the baby around to cradle her in one arm. “I was at that card game, is all. Knew Albne would try to run off without paying.”
“Out.” He held up a memo between two fingers. “Malfoy says the potion is underway. And
“People like you?”
“Stop yelling at him! Christ, are we back in second year?”
“Did Dolohov attack me at all?”
“Macnair?”
Harry squinted at him, baffled.
“Could I have your autograph, sir?”
Dean crossed his arms on the table, scratching at his close-cropped black hair. “We all met first year. You, me, Seamus, Ron and Neville shared a dormitory. Proper fun, that was.”
Reena was shy at first, but Teddy’s bubbly personality brought out laughter and even giggles bordering on hysterical. Harry learned that she was a half-blood, from the wizarding village of Barnton, and that she was the first Gryffindor in her family. Her and Teddy showed off their newfound mastery of
A long silence passed between them. Hermione turned pleading. “Harry – “
“Those extra two pages you photographed,” she finally said, with moderate reluctance. Not much, to be honest, just a bit of history…I told you the original citation was wrong.
“Ow,” Draco wheezed, clutching his chest. “Fuck, Potter. Shut up.”
“It seems like I got in a fair amount of trouble, actually” Harry amended, thinking of all the detention stories he was told. Draco went quiet after that.
in the photograph.
As he went, the air stirred with Sandalwood and grapefruit. Harry dropped his gaze and cleared his throat, wishing there was anything about Draco his brain didn’t immediately fixate on.
Harry frowned, wary at that choice of phrasing. “I wouldn’t go that far.”
“Can you handle this, Mel?!”
“ – to find him. It’s completely useless if we can’t veritaserum. And he’s an Occlumens – “
If he was friendly with his neighbors, it didn’t come up. The shine of his celebrity must have worn off with these people. A very old wizard nodded politely to him, busy supervising the unmanned rakes moving over his lawn. Directly to the left was a married couple with an excitable basset-hound that barked in the mornings. Any children on the block must have been away, at Hogwarts with Teddy.
know. They had photos of the two of you in Diagon Alley together. I’m sure you just ran into her at Gringotts, but you were
Warmth burst up his forearm, all the way to his shoulder. The wand – less stylized than his own and quite unassuming – knew him. It knew him very well. He hadn’t even needed to cast the spell before it went to him.
“What did you do to me?” He groaned. “I haven’t been drunk since – “
“My mother.”
Two more red heads had been bent in conversation at the far end of the table. One of them looked like an older, shorter version of Ron. Thick muscles bulged under the skin of his arms. Skin marked with very severe burn scars.
“You’re letters have been so nice. I – I – “ He leaned forward, pressing his forehead into Harry’s chest. “I’ve been so worried about you.”
He waited, eager for any information about Draco. Because he assumed that’s what this was about. He hoped that’s what this was about.
“That pet wants to
“Here.” Ron lifted his sweater and pulled a wand from the two stuck in his waistband. Harry took it eagerly. Strong, familiar heat spread under his skin.
Harry dropped the paper to the table, disgusted. A movement in the corner of his eye caught his attention, and he examined the large whiteboard on the wall. Various images were stuck to the surface, drawn on, moving lines of marker squiggling between them.
He turned and set Draco’s tea down, amused at how he leaned away.
“Mal – “ She bit her lip again. “Draco is being held at the Ministry.”
“In the bathtub.”
“I’ll see you tonight. Down the hall, take a left.”
“Did you?”
Penning a letter to Hagrid took a while. Harry filled him in on Castor’s settling in and left an open invite for him to drop by whenever. Hopefully that wouldn’t seem too out of place; Ron and Hermione made it seem like they were fairly close. And Harry’s initial reaction to the snake must have seemed terribly out of sorts to him.
“He called it residue. And bottled it.” Harry jerked a thumb toward the still-open wardrobe, holding his hand over the bed to feel the warming charm still in effect. Despite it, Draco was shivering. Harry could see it in his shoulders.
“You can go to the Manor.”
“You mean Fleur,” Ron accused. “She’s not stupid. She wouldn’t tell.”
“So I take it we’re not on the best terms?” He asked, thinking back to that night, recalculating. No. It still didn’t quite add up.
Dean and Seamus sat on either side of him. Debra stayed at her desk – Harry heard her quill scratching. Draco sat imperiously straight as they pored over the documents. To avoid being glared at, Harry opened the front cover. The penmanship was spiky and severe:
Harry pushed the window up. “Hello.”
“I’m literally starving to death, woman!”
George grinned. “Edible Soap,” he said in a mock-announcer’s baritone. “You’ll be sneezing bubbles for hours!”
“S’pose I should get home,” Ron said with a frown. “
“Trust,” Ron said, disbelief thick in his voice. “I imagine.”
“Slovenian,” Draco said, after a pause. “Their breath renders smaller insects incapable of movement.”
He opened it and peeked his head inside. “I’m not bothering you, am I?”
, and all I hear is that you’re in St. Mungo’s! Not allowed to visit – no one sees fit to pass along the canister of soup I – “
“Fine.” The man walked off and disappeared through a door down the hall. In the quiet, George frowned at Harry, who tried not to look too surprised. “That’s Lee.”
Something in his tone made her smile. “Do you, now? And I’m sure I don’t need to tell you your address?”
He knew he’d hit the nail on the head. Ron’s freckles darkened.
Wouldn’t look her in the eye for a month.” She glanced up at him, suppressing a grin. “Bill thought it was hilarious, and Phlegm couldn’t understand why you wouldn’t be
Ron glanced up at one of the stopped clocks. “Insurance wards stopped the clocks… Doctor,” he raised his voice a bit. Mahmoud perked up. “There would be a Duplication of what was stolen, correct?”
He pushed his head along Harry’s arm, using the last foot or so of his body as leverage to curl once around his neck, solid weight draping over his shoulders.
fault!”
Ginny smacked the side of his head. “Cheeky. But that’s a good question. It’s the announcer’s box, so Lee Jordan will be in there.”
“Crouch Jr.” Ron’s voice was soft, his eyes downturned. “It’s a long story. The full moon is this week, isn’t it?”
He returned her smile, casting a Lightening Charm on the bag and shoving it into an inner pocket. “I’ll just be going, then. Thanks for the tea.”
“We know exactly how the pyramids were built because of the Pyramid Texts. Since the discovery of the Rosetta Stone, scholars all over the world have been deciphering the incantations. The

, evidently – was asleep on top of a bookshelf. Harry left him to it, shedding his robes and running up the steps to his office. A quick look through the desk drawers produced an envelope, quill, and string.
“What?” He asked defensively. Harry raised his eyebrows. “I’m allowed to be concerned! If it’s as bad as the two of you say he’s essentially at death’s
“George?”
He chewed the tip of the sugar quill, wondering what Draco was doing to prepare for that night. Eating something, hopefully. Staying warm.
, this is a day.”
,” he muttered. Nothing. Forcing a deep breath, he stepped back, looking at the series of bricks with discoloring that indicated they’d been tapped by many wands. Maybe he had to try
“Azkaban,” Ron corrected. “He should be. It – you – “
“That’s the drive up there,” Draco said, pointing toward a break in the trees. The cement of the road became darker and much newer. Harry could feel the magic sweeping over them already.
He kept his heating system turned up high to counteract the onset of winter. Castor still complained of cold, and became less active. Now that there was antivenom on hand, Harry stopped removing him from his bed and just slept with a giant snake half-wrapped around his calf.
“W-what?”
“Speaking of Ginny,” Harry said. Draco looked at him. “I’m going to see her play in a few weeks. It’ll be my first professional game.”
would I ask for
Finally, during a particularly boring afternoon, he decided.
The sounds of the open air market over the wall behind them were considerably dulled by the many muggle-repelling charms, and completely gone as they entered the shielded entrance to the underground tunnels. Icy air billowed out at them as they walked, and Harry was sufficiently creeped out by the dark damp and glistening walls by the time it all shimmered and became a very chilly, high-ceilinged library.
“We have months still. It’s not a race.”
“Now you’re sounding like yourself,” Dean winked, starting on his own set. “Got any plans this weekend? We miss you at pub nights.”
“C’mon, Harry. This was –
No, he decided, pulling his hand away and clenching it at his side. He had a good idea who he’d think about if he did. And it just wasn’t on.
“The potion,” he said louder. “Wake up. Or – or tell me what to do – “
Harry now had five tubes of crystal clear potion, guaranteed to reverse the effects of Castor’s bite. God forbid it ever happened. He felt marginally better about leaving Castor loose while Teddy was home for the holidays.
His eyes went even wider as he felt at the pockets of his sweatpants, a black shirt stretching tight over his chest in the process. “
“…yeah, it does. He’s, erm, trying to locate him using their Dark Marks.”
They ate their toast in silence. Hermione watched him. He didn’t see the clipboard, but she was clearly taking notes in her head.
_____________________
The next turn – a low tunnel – led them deeper into the castle. The air lost some of its chill and he could feel his nose again. All of the portraits here seemed to recognize him, but he kept his eyes firmly forward, stomach turning. Was she taking him straight to Teddy?
Draco was walking so fast it seemed he was purposefully trying to leave Harry behind. He clearly didn’t want to be here. Harry wondered why he had agreed to this at all, and why he had agreed on bringing Harry.
Harry had yet to see the mysterious, muggle-hating portrait of Sirius’ mother, but he wasn’t at all curious. The heavy black curtains could stay eternally drawn over the frame, for all he was concerned.
“What?”
He hadn’t seen George look uncomfortable before now. “Look, you’re the only one who knows about…him.”
Harry huffed and got to his feet. Hagrid handed him a small, wire cage. Hermione immediately took it away, shaking her head.
to find out that Malfoy is working with the Aurors? What the fuck?”
Greenbaum went first, the other two right behind. As their heads went underground, the stone above slid shut. In the sudden, total dark, he instinctively gripped Ron’s shoulder. Worse, the air on either side opened up – their footfalls echoing in a wide, undetermined amount of space. It happened so quickly he didn’t have time to speak – a violent upset quaked through his inner ear, destroying all notions of up or down. He shut his eyes, struggling to stay upright.
She held out her hand, and the pen flew into it. Wandless, wordless magic. He knew that should impress him. Brandishing it like a wand, she asked him again to disarm her.
“Remember how to play video games?”
“Then it doesn’t matter if he knows you’re here or not. He can’t get inside.” He sighed, scrubbing a hand over his face. “Outside is where we need to be alert. Constant vigilance.”
“No,” George sighed. “I expect Ron told Fleur about the things Fred and I used to do to him. Has Mum been over here?”
Alone again, Harry looked around. The papers were mostly reports from subsections of the Auror office. He swiveled, sighing at the mass of information. Most piles must have had balancing charms attached. It felt like he’d been trying to brick himself in.
The crowd went bonkers. Across the field, the lion on the banner opened its jaw in a soundless roar, gold letters spelling out
“Why are you
There was a bathroom at the base of a sharply-inclined staircase. She started yanking his sweater over his head before he’d even stepped over the threshold.
“Another one, eh? Well, hurry up. I don’t want McGonagall catching us. You’re not supposed to know about this.”
him, but Harry was happy to broker food if it made Draco feel, nay,
“No one’s asking you to,” he slurred, bracing his hand on the banister as they slowly ascended the steps.
“The Elves.”
Harry felt his mouth drop open in shock.
Since he was a baby. He didn’t know how to feel about that. Past the line of trees was an open field, only one small shed taking up space in the shade of an oak. A thin trail of smoke spun from the figure sat against it.
“I’m sorry,” he whispered, squeezing her hand. “I don’t – I can’t – “
bed, shoved into one corner. Beside that was a table covered in books and stacks of papers. An armchair the size of a taxi glowed from the firelight. It smelled overwhelmingly of pine and cooking meat.
. He turned his face up to the clouds for a second, breathing. “Okay.”
He was halfway down the steps when there was another, barely-there shiver in the walls. It was
Why?” Ron spluttered. From behind the cubicle, Debra made a sound that could have been a laugh.
She looked at him over her glasses, eyes wide. He fled.
“I know.” Harry thought he could smell alcohol on Draco’s breath, and something deep down inside of him felt…excited. “I understand why you did it.”
on the doorstep anyway. Draco was halfway down the steps when Harry threw the door open. They stared at each other for a shocked second before Harry got his wits and slammed the door behind him.
“Well.” Dean rolled his shoulders. “That was…something.”
Draco glanced over his shoulder. His eyes couldn’t find anything to focus on, so he just looked at the ground. “No.”
Two more people said hello to him – from the Wizengamot Admin office, it looked like. Harry smiled to them, fully aware that the interaction wouldn’t have happened two months ago. His demeanor had changed enough for simple passerby to have noticed, and react accordingly. Bizarre.
All he knew about himself was what he’d been told. He played Quidditch. He’d fought in a war. He was an Auror. He was quite bad at Potions. Repeating those facts to himself didn’t make them feel any more real.
It was smaller than Harry thought a crup should be, but the long hair suggested some cross breeding. It jumped from Ron’s arms to Hermione’s, who looked begrudgingly charmed as it sniffed wildly in her hair.
“I….” He took a breath. “He’s got some stuff going on, I suppose, and I don’t think I’m the person he should be talking to…at present. Or ever. So I just…suggested he talk to you. Or whoever.”
Hermione elbowed him in the ribs. “He means…It’s not your fault, Harry. The papers have terrorized you for years. You don’t like the attention, and it shows. Outside of us, your image is sort of…standoffish.”
“What?”
There it was. The slightest break in his voice that matched a sharp pain in Harry’s chest. “I didn’t,” he admitted in a hushed tone. Teddy looked away, shoulders tense. “I have gotten to know you…a bit. Through your letters. And Ron and Hermione told me so much…”
She flipped shiny red hair over her shoulder and held the sweater under running water, using her wand to lather in a purple soap. “Who’s to say I’m not pressing my advantage?”
“Oh,” Harry said, and left it at that. They turned onto the drive, walked past some trees, and there it all was.
“Fudged.”
The headlines became extremely benign. It sent a shiver up his spine, thinking of the Ministry take over he’d been told of. It was him, the Weasleys, Hermione, and several other people he did not know. Everyone seemed in good spirits, but the house was like an extra, scowling presence in the background. One photo of George and someone who looked exactly like him had the rug in it. The same rug Harry was sitting on now.
“Did I say anything?” Harry asked, hoping for a clue. Draco shook his head. “You stayed up all night.” He was still too foggy to control his tone, so it came out as a sharp accusation.
After several hours of looking at indistinguishable ginger children in old photographs – Molly getting quite tipsy, along with Arthur – Harry started to wonder why they hadn’t done this before. Everyone present was overly eager to tell Harry an old story, only for everyone else to but in with their own recollection of the same event. The stories varied wildly, arms and hands smacking Harry on the arms as the maelstrom around him pointed and gestured toward the photobook Molly had placed over their laps.
Harry hesitated. A panicked glance at Ron showed him waylaid by yet another, skinnier brother.
“Harry,” Élise said decisively, leaning forward. Her dark eyes gleamed teasingly as he visibly braced himself. “You’re quiet tonight.”
Ron hesitated, looking suddenly uncomfortable. “He’s a Death Eater, Harry.”
“I don’t know. No,” he decided. He should just tell Ron now.
He looked at her. “What was my plan, then?”
things like pureblood ideology at Hogwarts?
That had been mentioned quite often, as well. “That’s fine, Ron, but…am I allowed to go
“Enthusiastic?”
She screeched, pleased at the mess now scattering Harry’s jumper. George didn’t help clean him up, distracted going through his mail. “Good girl,” he muttered absently, bouncing her on his knee and making an even bigger mess as she giggled her lunch up. “This is from McGonagall.”
“Are they not equally wanted?” Harry asked. “I know Dolohov attacked me, but – “
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco crossed his arms. “I was a child, Potter. I don’t remember.”
She swallowed. “I just need to know what’s in that book.”
“Sorry,” he said quickly.
“Trouble in paradise,” he said, tone growing scathing as Hermione glowered. “Potter’s been keeping secrets from you.”
He was looking to Harry, now. Of course he nodded. His stomach was quite empty, and Ron was always going on about how good the food was here.

Greenbaum slipped in silently behind them. Mahmoud didn’t look up from the parchment. “Thirty years after the
Harry found that bothered him. Ron had said it so certainly, but Harry wouldn’t have thought witches were his type. Then again, he didn’t know himself very well. “Molly?”
“Mister Potter.”
Hermione took a deep breath, staring at her food. “From what I can tell, Harry has forgotten only what directly concerns
“All of it.”
let me be there if you ever mention the arse thing to Ron. I really will beg.”
“Soup should be ready.” He kept his notebook out of reach of either of them, getting to his feet and skipping off to the kitchen. “We’ll try the medical ones next. You can take turns naming the bones in my feet.”

“One, I don’t know what that means. And two, I let you obliviate me on a

“Ron –“
“The Auror department had been all but eliminated, or replaced by Death Eaters. Unspeakables weren’t talking about anything. Everyone else was coming out of a months-long
Harry shouldn’t have been offended at that. It was silly. “They’re both my houses. Technically.”
“Why did you wait? Was it because I was Head Auror? Would I have shot it down, do you think?”
The lift doors slid open. He wasn’t sure how far they’d traveled, but this floor was dark. The walls were literal black stone, and there was only one door at the end of a short hall. It was black as well, silver script shining in the center.
He hadn’t even considered that. Minerva hadn't said anything of the sort, and if there was a child services division of the Ministry, he doubted they knew of his condition. Teddy, at least, looked relieved. He wound his fingers together in his lap and stared down for a long while. Silently.
“But you like the darkness,” Harry had teased. Castor’s favorite hiding spot was beneath the armchair.
“Then what is the problem?’
And what an outside it was. Low-slung hills sloped gently past the line of trees surrounding the property. An evening chill settled in as the sun set. His hair waved in the breeze, lungs filled with the scent of flowers and moss and manure.
running bullshit articles like that. I think Mum was just...hoping.” He gave Harry an apologetic look. “The first question, you tolerated. After the second, you took Teddy and left. Without a word. It was...chilling. The look on your face was just like it used to be… You stopped coming by the Burrow after that, for a long time.”
“Draco told me.”
, either, Ronald.”
“Is that how you thought of me?” Harry asked, keeping his voice low. He didn’t want to startle Draco by speaking so close so suddenly. “The Pegasus?”
Ron stared at him, contemplating. Then Harry shoved a plate of food under his nose and he was sufficiently distracted for a good ten minutes. Ron was a little bit easy to manipulate, or at least divert. Hermione was the opposite - the puppetmaster.
The green flames were warm against his legs. “Grimmauld Place,” he said. Nothing happened.
He’d lost his godfather in the second war, he learned. Ron almost completely skipped over it, just as he did when he got the part where his brother was killed. Then Teddy’s parents – Tonks and Lupin, he called them. Tonks was a metamorphagus. It explained Teddy’s blue hair in the photos.
“What I saw
“Reena,” Teddy said distractedly. “She’s brilliant.”
His eyebrows pulled together, less annoyed now and more uncomfortable. Harry was glad to not be the only one, for once.
“Dumbledore was the Headmaster of Hogwarts,” Seamus cut in. Harry nodded, doing his best to keep up as, over the next hour, his team told him about the war. Some of it, Élise and Debra could tell. Logistics, public opinion. But it was Ron, Dean and Seamus that had been at Hogwarts with him.
Harry got his first look at the castle.
“That was tame,” she pointed her wand at the panel of numbers. The number nine glowed, but the lift moved down instead of up. “Do you know anything about the Department of Mysteries?”
Dean sighed. “Ron – “
“Come on, I’ll show you to your room.”
“Sorry. I’ll go.”
“Because you don’t hate me, whatever you say,” Harry said. “Though by all accounts I hated you.”
He nodded, and after a few more general questions about his health, Hannah left. The way she looked at Hermione was odd. Harry got the sense she was deferring to her.
“That smells great.” He sat heavily next to Harry. “Oh, the usual madness. I think she’s mad we didn’t wait for her shift at Neville’s.”
“It’s not
“Back up to ten,” Dean said. “Impressive.”

still stood out – did he have to be so weird-looking?
“Y-Yes, ma’am,” he said, even though they’d just eaten. He turned and, after a moment's thought, threw his arms around his middle.
He stopped talking, but Harry was catching on to how the potion worked. “Like what?”
“B-Because you’re
___________________
Heavy exercise with Dean made every morning a mess of stiff muscles and weak thighs – his shoulder in particular ached almost constantly now – but warm tea usually did the trick, along with a capsule of muggle painkillers he’d grabbed at the store.
The Auror team quickly covered up raucous laughter as he walked into the office. Ron was the only one who didn’t wipe the smile from his face.
“Oh.”
Harry sipped the tea, trying to look less interested than he felt. Maybe his interest would bring her to her senses and stop this flow of information.
“Excellent point,” Draco hissed, making Harry feel like the thickest person in the room. “I’d nearly forgotten.”
“That’s for the chicken.”
He smiled. “Haven’t had the chance.”
“Um, no, that’s alright thanks. Thought I’d eat with Ron.”
“No,” the stranger breathed, dropping to his knees. “Don’t touch it.” He knocked Potter’s hand away, pressing down with his own. “What have you done?”
The snake seemed to think about it, swaying up higher to look at the others. “
“Useless,” he muttered. Something splashed and bubbled. “
“Anyone who would want to steal from
knew exactly who he was.
Ron was quiet for a moment. Then, “How have you been getting on?”
Harry laughed at that, which made some of the gloominess fade from Ron’s expression.
“You mean the explosives,” Harry surmised. “After I told you not to.”
But he ate it. He tore the lid off and sat, Conjuring a fork and shoveling down large mouthfuls. Then the potatoes. And the bread. In desperate, almost animal-like motions. And with no reserve. It was like Harry wasn’t even there.
“Pansy Parkinson.”
“So that’s it? You’re not going to investigate?”
There was a
“You can understand me?” Harry said, in wonder. The snake bobbed it’s head and bared long fangs.
She looked up to glower at him, and Harry almost gasped. She looked horrible – dark circles rounded tired, bloodshot eyes. She looked worse than
, specifically?” Harry asked, feeling brave.
“Fine. Just fine.” George pushed the box toward him and examined the pile of explosives with intent. Harry wondered just how much of that – if not all – would make its way to Teddy anyway. “You’d better get going before Lee comes back out here. He’ll ask you about Dolohov.”
When he found it in himself to look up again, there were tears in her eyes.
“Night.”
It didn’t work. The chicken actually got

So Harry was a father. An Auror, a father…and a drunk, evidently.

“It’s the only mistake in the entire – “
“On the contrary.” Dean said, glancing at Seamus. “It means he likes you.”
“I brought potions. He asked for them the last time, so…” She trailed off, stopping at the end of the bed.
talking about his explosion earlier at work. Harry got the sense it was well practiced. “I know she got you a pair of boots last Christmas. Did you throw them out? I wouldn’t blame you…”
Harry felt a creeping dread, but wasn’t certain which part of this was bothering him. It didn’t seem…
“They knew where they were going,” Greenbaum said. “Illusionment stratus never went down. If they did fly a broomstick up here, they did it blind.”
“Oh!” Hagrid broke into a smile, rosy cheeks swelling. “Tell ‘im I said thank you.”
He ducked out to the corridor. “Up here.”
“Make yourself at home,” Hermione encouraged, shrugging out of her blazer and throwing it over a kitchen chair. Harry took his boots off as she started the kettle. Pictures hung on the wall in a nicely arranged collage of bold frames. Her and Ron. Ron and Harry. The three of them. Ron and four other men that were clearly family members. Only some of them moved. The rest were muggle pictures, still and staring.
, then I really want us to be friends.”
cooked for me.” Victoire screeched again, and they both flinched. “My God,” George told her. “You sound just like your mother.”
“Erm. Right.” Harry brought up the wards, walking in a circle and doing everything Hermione had showed him. It looked the same as he remembered, but he didn’t want to mess with them. Better to let Hermione do that part.
“Too early,” Dean yawned. “You did tell him we were coming, didn’t you?”
Nothing. Beyond the ringing and encroaching chaos of bystanders, it was silent.
“Seeds. From one of Hagrid’s pumpkins.”
He pressed, astounded.
They both turned. Harry’s heart jumped to his throat. All this time to think on it, and he still wasn’t prepared.
___________________________
Ron smiled weakly. “It’s…Teddy, you know? It’s always been about Teddy. You brought him here when he was two. That’s when things started to get better. You...had someone to take care of, and I think that took your mind off the worst things. Mum camped out here for about a week to help you adjust, and I thought that would really drive you mad, but you took it like a champ. George called you Diaper Man until Teddy was old enough to tell him to stop.”
The weather dropped into cold, wet sludge and rain. Patrons of Diagon Alley cast large Umbrella Charms over their heads and bags, turning the mist into shimmering rivulets as it ran over the charm and to the ground. The goblins strode around in beautifully patterned coats and long ear jewelry that shone even in the downpour, and every now and then there were House Elves out running errands in thick knit sweaters and scarves.
“Why’s that?” Harry asked, then shook his head. “Right. Voldemort. Evil soul-tearing magic.”
The stories kept coming, but there was a more muted quality to them. Nods of agreement instead of gleeful arguing.
She took a deep breath. “As long as it takes. I think it’s been around sixty this time.”
He took a step forward, leaning just slightly over the other side of the table to examine the array of breakfast. It was really only then, when it was all under those supercilious eyes, that Harry realized he had made
He realized, with a sigh, that

He looked at Hermione for help.
“What does Hermione have to do with it?”
“Yeah,” she breathed. “That’s just it. Passing thoughts, like I think about anyone else. It used to just be worry.” She exhaled a cloud of fog that diffused the glow of scattered pumpkins and gourds, charmed to illuminate the path. “Have you been to see Luna? Or anyone?”
“That’s a high threshold. I’d settle for playing just once on a real pitch.”
“What…what does that even mean?”
“I’m not
He’d get Ron or Hermione to help, he decided. Hopefully get a response in before…whatever time they had dinner at Hogwarts.
With his feet kicked up, his damp hair twisted into a bun while the television played cannily in the background, he felt truly at home.
“I’ve got the scar! I’ve got loads of scars – “
“Keep that thing from leaking into the roast!”
She shook her head. “I’m more concerned about the
“Do you have
Harry ignored him. “And you need to stop hiding in my bedroom. I don’t want you sleeping in my bed.”
Hermione was giving him another one of her looks as he walked back to join them. Luna still somehow didn’t look cold, even as the wind swirled her dress fabric all around like Boreus personified.
Not the rest – not the pain. Not the anger.”
Teddy’s hair turned bright pink. “Sounds
She transfigured his jeans into black trousers – remarkably well. One leg was just slightly shorter than the other, but he didn’t say anything. He pulled his robes on and tied his hair back. At Hermione’s nod, he stepped into the fireplace.
“How old are you?” Harry asked, leaning over the side of the chair, his chin resting on the arm. The snake shifted his coils, uncurling from the rock and climbing the side of the chair easily. Harry inhaled and kept still.
He countered that with a re-cap of the (fortunately less gruesome) Hogwarts game. She gasped at all the right places, sitting up in attention. Her eyes went wide every time she smiled, hands sweeping through her hair or winding together under her knees. Ginny was comforting. Ginny was like…a well-placed fern. She brought the whole room together.
“Yup.”
“Morning,” Harry said glumly, watching Hermione stow her wand. The Department of Mysteries corridor was bleak as always. He took stock of his body, testing his left shoulder. Still sore. He’d made use of the Auror work-out facilities (Level 2 ¾ ) very early that morning. Debra gave him a very thorough ribbing when he could only do fifteen press-ups in a row – clearly, his past record was much higher. Ron explained the shoulder was an old injury, and Harry must have just forgotten to adjust for it. He’d been starving when he got down here to meet Hermione. “Hm. Earl Gray?” He wondered aloud, moving his tongue around the inside of his mouth.
He prepared himself for the possibility. Wouldn’t it be better to tell Teddy than to lie about it? Which would he prefer, if he was a child?
Again, everyone looked at him. He frowned into his potatoes.
Grimmauld Place’s parlor was silent. Harry went straight to the door, listening intently before pulling it open and standing in the hall. The torches flickered with their usual ennui.
that we lost.”
“You mean, you didn’t…” Whatever was going on, it appeared Ron had caught on. He was shaking his head, glancing between Harry and Hagrid. “He said Hagrid smells like the forest.”
Another subject change. Harry nodded slowly. “It may go on for quite a while.”
“But – doesn’t that mean anyone trying to get to my house could end up – ?“
“Ms. Abadi,” Minerva cut in, enough ice in her voice to make both students straighten their spines. “With me.”
“Oh, I’ll have words with you, later.” She took Harry’s arm and pulled him toward where the rest of the voices were.
“Well, perhaps you could make the
“Keep going,” he said, glancing around. “What happened after I killed him?”
“This is natural,” Debra droned, arms crossed. Ron rolled his eyes.
“Not yet. Can’t imagine it’s pleasant over there – the place already smells, and you remember how manky the Polyjuice – “
“How generous of me,” he said drily. She laughed, a tinkling bell sound. But, really, he sounded like quite a decent sort, at least with his money. “Bill works here as well, doesn’t he? Is he around?”
In spite of himself, Harry relaxed, relieved Ron had thought to tell him that.
now?” A freckled woman fell heavily into the seat beside Harry, patting his shoulder affectionately. Ginny. “Hey, Har. You all better?”
“Aw,” Hagrid blew an evasive breath. “Jus’ heard about – erm – through the grapevine, and – I, well, it’s not too often you get ter see a – “
“It’s only the first game,” Neville said.
“Castor
It was impressive that Draco could suppress a reaction to even that. “Oh,” he said again.
“Well – “ Ron hesitated, giving Harry a little smile that made him feel like a child trying their best. “Motives aren’t always logical. Could be something completely dull. Like what I’m about to do – paperwork!”
“I don’t want any more
George exhaled. His bloodshot eyes looked exhausted. “You look anxious, Gin. Have a hit?”
“Was there anything else?”
“Self-fertile,” Lee cut in, huffing a laugh. “Bit like you at Hogwarts, George. Pollinated by bees from April to September.”
what all those people had seen fit to stare at, then?
Hermione was right behind them, hair and eyes wild.
“Erm, well, I’m sure Hagrid wouldn’t mind.”
, he found he wasn’t hungry anymore. He paced around the sitting room, trying and failing to catch any conversation from behind the formerly open door.
“No, no she’s working late.” Ron pushed the empty container away. “I’ll tell her later, assuming I’m up. Have you…known anything else you shouldn’t?”
Her eyes opened, full of pain and regret. He could see that he’d gotten to her in every way he could. He saw that it didn’t matter. “I’m sorry.”
“Now.” Draco blinked and sighed irritably. “I
“Hagrid,” Hermione said calmly. “Where did you get it?”
That was rather horrifying. “They allow this sort of thing at Hogwarts?”
“Ron said we went to school together? What was that like?”
The toast stayed between them, but Draco didn’t touch it. Maybe it would be too much like they were having breakfast together, instead of just drinking tea together. Which was already probably strange enough. Harry was his enemy, after all.
was wearing jeans.
“Well, go on,” Ron gestured around brusquely. “Introduce yourselves.”
“Yeah.” Ron cleared his throat. “I asked him to come in today.”
Harry had expected Lee to be there, but still found himself a bit at a loss. George had been over to his house twice that week, and never mentioned him. He must have been alright, Harry reasoned. At least something like George, who was, by far, the easiest of everyone to get along with. Except perhaps Ginny. George was like a friend, whereas Ron and Hermione fussed over him like siblings, or…
It was hard to look away from him, but Harry managed. The rest of the team exchanged looks he couldn’t interpret.
busy – “ He turned just enough to give Harry a wink. Harry pursed his lips.
” Ron said. Harry nodded benignly.
“It’s an old children’s book,” she explained. “Very rare, not seen in public since the fourteenth century. I managed to track the last known auction piece to one of his great-great-uncles. There’s a near certain chance it ended up at the Manor library, though, since the Malfoys were one of the last families to fall out of favor, I think every pureblood with illicit or valuable texts would have had them moved to the Manor to avoid the raids.
Harry pulled him in for a much tighter hug, willing back the tightness in his throat. “I will. I promise.”
Draco stared at him. “He’s taunting you. All of us. Your constant vigilance will only let him know he’s scared you.”
After a silent moment, he raised a hand (steady, now) and pointed to the wall behind Harry’s head. The tapestry wall. “How closely have you looked at that?”
“Um – “
“And the beans,” Charlie insisted, adding in everything Molly had given
“You first,” he prodded. Harry set a pawn forward. After two more moves, Ron cleared his throat.
I followed up with a counterpart of mine in the Greek Ministry, and she was able to confirm that the word means

She caught it, staring at the cover in blank shock. Giving him a wary look, she opened the front cover and two seconds later closed it, breathing hard.
that I know her day was more than just eight hours. She’ll admit to a few hours, ‘to make ends meet’, she’ll say. On days like today, though, it’s so obvious I can’t pretend to not notice.”
“Ah. The Weezly shop, then.” She stood and conjured a steaming cup of tea. “I will have Rocklor fetch it from your vault.”
He joined Harry’s team, and it was the most in sync they’d been yet. Ron was always right where Harry needed him to be, ready to catch the Quaffle, or pass it, or to block Ginny so he could make a goal. Even so, Ginny held her own. Things were more evenly matched when Bill joined in.
You love Hogwarts!”
Draco stopped suddenly at the fountain, fussing with his cuffs.
“I just told him that my perspective is shit, and he should talk to some other people sometimes. About stuff. And don’t turn this around – he’s
“Malfoy,” Ron said shortly. “Glad you could make it.” His voice indicated every opposite.
“I’ve lifted the curse, dullard.”
If she really did figure it out in the first week, why the hell had he kept going back to Mysteries? Had she used all that time to pry through his head? For
Ron shoved all the unchewed food in his mouth to one cheek so he could speak. “Binding magic. Not very well known, but then again our Archive doesn’t have a huge selection of Dark books. I spent two hours going through a book called
“Harry! You’re – oh,
“There used to be an Elf. His name was Kreacher.” Harry looked up at the flawlessly white ceiling. “It still looked like a dump in the pictures.”
Silence lapsed. Draco had his head stuck in a book, and Harry wished he’d brought something to do. It wasn’t late enough to try and sleep. He watched the fire for a few long minutes, then chanced a look at Draco. The stopwatch had gone off just moments ago, making them both jump, and now he was carefully doling out half-teaspoons of liquid toadstool.
She raised one eyebrow as she sat with brittle grace at a short oak table, bare save a vase of knotgrass and Valerian.
He frowned at her strange wording. “Sure. Maybe.”
“But if he
The shelves thinned out, became more colorful. Draco walked unerringly to the last shelf on a row, just before it ended at a brick wall and a hanging coat of arms that, after a double take, Harry realized was an exact replica of one hanging in the front hall of Grimmauld Place. The Black family crest.
“It looks dull,” Harry teased. A line formed between Draco’s brow. “What’s it about?”
THERE IN TIME? OI –

“Erm, Harry Potter to see Herm…Unspeakable Granger,” he said. Nothing happened. He jumped as something prodded his arm.
He smiled when he himself was younger, too. The second album appeared to be his Hogwarts days. Before the

“Did you go for a run?” Élise asked incredulously, poking her head around her cubicle.
“Pet,” Harry said, almost glad Draco didn’t have his wand. The way he looked at Castor made Harry sure he would have fired and asked questions later. “What did you see? Was there someone in the house?”
He shooed Harry out, shutting and locking the door. “You don’t recall, but something similar happened with the, erm,

She stopped talking. Harry blinked. “What does that have to do with…?”
“Something brilliant!” Teddy suggested helpfully. Harry thought that was an absurd request, but the crowd was chanting his name, still, and the wand was in his hand. When had he taken it?
He stood carefully, trying not to look at the mess on his shoulder.
“You always underestimate,” she tutted right away, pulling her robes open to reveal a little bag on her hip. She pulled another red hat from it and squashed it down over his ears, along with a scarf. “How’s that?”
“THEY ARE GETTING TO THEIR FEET,” Emma narrated, eyes wide. The figure in green robes gesticulated wildly like they were yelling, and then the Gryffindor Seeker shoved them, hard.
“Everyone jus’ calm down!” Hagrid said in a raised voice. “It won’ hurt you.”
“No. It’s just – you haven’t – “ She frowned, then shook her head. “It’s nothing. I’m glad.”
“So I’m told.” Greenbaum fiddled with a folded parchment. “Now we have to say….oh, this is just silly – “
“If I’m so horrible, why do they bother?”

voices. Harry didn’t call out, just moved silently toward the back wall of displays. There was a door there, ajar, with a plaque that read
“Do I show up?”
On the way back down, he wondered where Draco was sleeping. The only remotely welcoming rooms were Sirius’ and, he assumed, Regulus’. The rest had barely more than a couple of mattresses on a bedframe, clearly converted to sleeping quarters during their stay here during the war.
“You look nearly as tired as I feel. Weren’t you with George?”
Harry sighed and pushed the door open.
– oh, for fuck’s sake,” he snapped as the garden door opened again.
Potter looked up at him through heavy eyes. His last moments on Earth might be with this person. This person who knew him. “Who are you?” He asked. The words didn’t sound right. They were warbled, thick.

“So that’s why we got to be Aurors without our N.E.W.T.S.. And that’s why you basically do whatever you want. No one in their right mind would tell you otherwise.”
A few fireplaces rushed by – one looked like the Burrow – before his own. When it did, he stuck a foot out, only to find the opening already gone. There was a sharp pain in his ankle, and he needed to
“SETTLE DOWN,” Minerva was saying into the wand, her stern voice doing absolutely nothing to quell the increasing rowdiness. “I
Harry dropped from the pull-up bar, arms crying out in exhaustion. “You said it was fifteen, before.”
It was a strange thing, to look at eleven year old Harry and Ron. Of course he could see the resemblance in Ron’s face, now, but he had no reference point for himself. Young. Skinnier than even Teddy, hair sometimes very short and other times long. Ron had been chubby and Ginny so small it hurt his heart to look at her.
“I can only do this once,” Draco said. “It’s Dolohov or Macnair – your choice, really.”
Before he could even formulate a question, she scrambled to her feet and grabbed her bag.
Harry went lower to watch them wrestle violently, laughing until his stomach actually hurt.
contributed. The whole Malfoy Library situation had been done specifically to keep secret from Ron. “And I won’t. Not anymore.”
The snake’s tongue flickered in and out for a few moments. Harry’s back hurt, but he didn’t dare move. Somehow, he knew he shouldn’t. Someone (Ron) was breathing very hard, and he bet there were at least two wands trained on the snake.
“Harry, this is Réne,” Teddy announced, dragging him over. “Ren, this is Harry and my Uncle Ron.”
She stopped in front of the door, watching him.
“Mum’s just…pretending everything’s normal. As usual. It’s weird, though, because I feel like everyone else is, too. Or – or not even
“That’s

on my own?”
“I am surprised it’s taking so long to reverse the curse,” Draco said. Harry stared down at his hands. “Ah. I see.”
“You’re not,” Draco said, which seemed a strange thing to argue about. Harry threw the empty air next to him an eye roll.
“The first was…simpler. In theory. One’s soul remains intact, but they are joined to another. Bonded.”
“I am. Thanks.” He took a glass of water that she filled with her wand. “I’m having a blast, actually.”
“Yeah,” Harry said.
“Bought it off some muggles in town,” he said. The embers lit up as he inhaled. Not a cigarette, Harry realized as he smelled the acrid smoke.
Draco smiled a private smile. “They’re caretakers of the house, now, technically, not of its occupants. Though for whatever reason they’ve taken a shine to my mother.”
“Not bad,” Ron said, breathing hard. Harry released him so he could Summon back his wand, shaking out his arm. “Your disarm is as strong as ever.”
“Yes,” she said. “To a certain degree. But just the other day, we were talking, and…”
“Well, come on, then. I’m sure I’m chuffed to the muff for customers to see me in my jammies.” He stepped out anyway, leaning over the railing. “Alright, Mel?”
“No – “ He set his pen down. “Teddy’s owl is named Tod
“It’s fine,” she called, leaning over the hearth and into the firepit. There was a burst of green light that made her hair frizz. “It should work now.”
“Y-Yes, Headmistress.”
He wondered. What had Hermione been working on that was so important? Why had she let
aligns more with what he was talking about.”
“Harry Potter!” He exclaimed in a Punjabi accent. The introductions had been brief with the other two, but now two of his hands clung to Harry’s, grasping tight so he couldn’t escape the thorough examination he received over thick bifocals. “This is an honor.”
Hearing about the kitchen made some of the disgust and confusion fade from Ron’s expression, turning him reminiscent. “Yeah, Mum was always fighting with the house when we lived there. It didn’t want to cook for us. Just turned the food to sludge sometimes. Course the bloody place would perk up for
“I think they’re gone now,” Luna said a while later, standing on the topmost bench to look down at where a crowd had been gathered, waiting for Harry. The hat looked utterly out of place on her. “Or they’ve hidden. I didn’t bring my Spectrespecs.”
She blinked a few times, her eyes glassy. “Fine.”
Harry repeated. “What war would that be, exactly?”
“I’m not!” He cried, indignant. “Believe me, I couldn’t make up a story like that if I tried.”
None of it surprised Harry, but he had hoped for something more…concrete. “It does seem that way. Me being a prat.”
“Thanks for the sickles, and everything else,” Teddy murmured after a while. He leaned forward, discreetly wiping his eyes as he dug through his pocket. “Gerard Karasu got me a bunch of stuff from town. This is the last of it.”
“I’ll start on it,” Greenbaum said, stopping to shake their hands at the base of the stairs. “A pleasure, Potter.”
For a flash second, he thought he saw the same in Teddy’s eyes, but it was already gone, replaced by a toothy smile.
“I have strong magic,” he realized. Of course – he could do all sorts of wandless things. And only the night before, she had been telling him how extraordinary his Patronus charm was when he was only thirteen.
He shrugged, running a hand over his chin. “I think he wanted some sweets.”
“What?”
, actually. It was somewhere between a glide and a strut. Deep emerald robes started at his neck and swayed to the floor, making his skin seem all the more startlingly pale. White-blond hair was slicked back elegantly from his face, strong jaw and pale eyes on full display. Harry thought he remembered stubble, from that night, and a certain disarray to his hair. Those were both gone.
“Here,” Fleur said, lowering her baby into Harry’s lap. He held it awkwardly. “Victoire will help.”
A sharp slap across his face woke him. The stranger shook him by the shoulder.
Harry didn’t want that. As scared as he was after that Howler, he wouldn’t feel any better sitting here while Ron dealt with everything. “Close with them, am I?”
His next words came without him even thinking them first. “I did this to myself. Didn’t I?”
“I just told him your name,” the woman said tiredly. “He has no idea who we are.”
The Gothic Revival building currently blocking the sun marked the beginning of campus. It was tall and proud, presiding over Chancery Lane like a librarian over a rowdy student. It was a muggle university, but he knew Euro-Glyphs was somewhere inside.
might have been a sentiment Draco and Other Harry very much shared.
“Thanks,” he said, settling back as she left. Piano played softly from a record player in the corner. The air smelled like bergamot and lavender. Or maybe that was the tea. He blew before sipping it, flipping through the past transactions listed on parchment. There was a pattern – a small amount was put in every two months. Auror salary, he supposed. Every two weeks, an equally small sum was withdrawn. There were some outliers, though. A year ago he’d taken out four

wand?” He hadn’t wanted to ask before, worried it was lost somewhere in a patch of mud.
“I have all his money,” Harry muttered.
“And myself,” he relucted. “I rather hate my wardrobe.”
“Alright, Hagrid?”
“It wasn’t important what you said,” Draco muttered, looking down at a book.
None of that interested him so much as the woman sitting next to him. She was small and smartly dressed. A burgundy tweed suit jacket hung off the back of her chair as she leaned forward, peering down at a stack of papers in her lap. Curly hair dripped from a large bun. One dark brown hand rested idly on the blankets near his. There was a ring on it.
Her voice was tight, clipped. Deep brown eyes stared straight through him as her brain worked. When she set the clipboard on the table and leaned forward seriously, he was almost afraid.
“Well,” Harry started, something protective surging forward. “Neither are you, from what I’ve heard.”
“Ron, we look like schoolgirls,” Harry muttered as the crowd became louder. Ron looked down at their joined arms like he hadn’t noticed, dropping the contact.
It shrank down, until the bubble fit in the palm of Harry’s hand.
“What are the phrases?” Harry shoved aside the large, turquoise bag with the rest of the baby toys to the side and sat. George pulled a chair over and propped her up on his knee, for all the effort she made to slide to the floor like a boneless ginger heap.

“As far as our interactions have gone, this one was rather pleasant,” she mused, turning them towards a warm looking diner. “I look forward to working with him.”
He’d taken a walk around his little neighborhood just before dark the other day, stopping at the end of the street and watching the crush of muggles walk past the entrance to what they saw as a narrow, dirty alley.
“Who was the primary instigator of the Giant Wars?”
“I did send you the clipping from

There was a lot to do.

thing that’ll happen if the press finds out?”
“Gordon Brown.”
Potter yelled, frustrated. The stranger looked down at him, then for the first time noticed his stomach. Potter looked down, too, pulling his hands out from under him and gasping with pain. It was worse than he would have even guessed. Blood pulsed through his fingers, soaking into the torn fabric of a sweater.
“Here, give me a turn.” Ginny leaned over to take the baby, whispering in his ear. “You’d better start eating before mum has a conniption.”

It was retreating, now, toward the fire. Harry moved forward and crouched down, entranced.

puzzles to solve! Tell me or don’t!”
Hermione shifted like she was about to say something else, but then Ron stepped through the fireplace, coughing violently from inhaled soot. They both sat back like they’d been caught doing something wrong.
“Regardless of our past, I like you. Maybe in another world we could have been friends.”
“Brilliant, naturally. Respectful and very discreet about his wrongdoings.” Her eyes glinted with amusement. Harry hoped that meant he hadn’t been caught with any Weasley products yet. “I instructed him to wait for you in the Common Room, though I doubt – “
” she snapped.
She smoothed a hand over Harry’s head and smacked a kiss to his cheek that left him a bit dazed.
“Sorry. Didn’t realize that was one of the things you’d forgot.”
Hermione stared at him.
Draco’s eyes lit up with anger. “What would it take? For you to believe me? Veritaserum?”
She only glanced at him, then back to Ron. “I’ll see you at home,” she said, resigned to his silence.
It floated up. Hermione glanced over, nodding like she knew he’d be able to do it. “Good.”
Abruptly, Ron’s shoulders drooped. He scrubbed a hand through his hair, taking a step closer and holding his hands up in surrender.
“Full moon tonight,” he commented as they ate. “Only two left.”
“Ron’s brother,” Harry remembered. Seamus nodded, sitting next to Élise. “Charming.”
“Restricted Section at Hogwarts is fairly ancient,” Seamus mentioned. Ron nodded his agreement, some of his anger falling away.
“Pardon?”
“And what does it have to do with Hermione? Draco said something about her.”
He didn’t know if they’d talked about the letter. The one from Teddy was still in his pocket, but nothing else. Fine.
Fuck. JK. Rowling!!!
He sat forward, and Harry sensed that this was the real crux of things. “The magic he used was…twisted. He made it hurt, made it so he could summon us at his beck and call, made it so we would
,” Harry said defensively. “But you know that, don’t you?”
“Well, now I do. What do you say?”
How horrible. My money didn’t matter, or my name, or blood. I tormented you because it made me angry. I gladly accepted the lies my father told me, because the alternative was unacceptable. How could it be that everything I’d come to believe was important…wasn’t? When I opened my eyes to reality,” he moved beneath the blanket. Gripping his forearm. “It was too late.”
Harry looked down at the rug. Old, perhaps once beautiful but now rotting at the edges. “Why’s that?”
“Harry’s lost his memories,” Hermione said, looking around regretfully. “All of them.”
“When?” He repeated. Her hands clenched into fists. “
The snaps clicked open and he peered down into the cavernous inside of the case. “A Pensieve, then. I’ll require Marcomannic, is that a problem?”

house?”
“Again?” Harry asked, his limbs tingling with victory. Ron nodded eagerly, setting his stance.
Ron’s cheekbones turned pink. “I suppose that’s a possibility.”
She giggled, a little high-pitched. “Night, Harry.”
“Quidditch announcer,” he said, totally at ease. Harry nearly wondered if George had told him after all, he was taking it so well. “This is the last Friday I’ll have off for nearly the entire year.”

“It did.”
“It’s yellow curry,” she said, nodding to the bowl. The sudden change in subject was the first tactless thing he’d seen her do. “Your favorite.”
“Don’t know what it’s about – sorry. Maybe you ordered a dragon or something.”
Well, that wouldn’t do. “If you’re going to stay here, you can’t ever do that. Do you understand? Not ever.”
His answering grin was entirely too much like George’s. “You’ll see.”
“You don’t have to.” Her heels clicked loudly on the floor. It was so clear Harry saw his reflection as he looked down. “Really, you don’t.”
“Ron.”
As he stepped over the threshold, magic swept over him. It was strong enough for him to notice – the magic around the Ministry and his house were subtle, hidden. This was brusque and unmistakable. Nothing anyone would be Apparating past, he could tell.
The thing was…they

at Hogwarts, didn’t it?”
“And what do you do, after?”
“She’s not.” In the time it took Harry to go bring Ron and Hermione back through both his fireplace and this one, Draco had donned robes. They swished impressively as he uncrossed his arms. “None of them are. There’s no trust left between the families after they sold each other out to the Ministry.”
cold.
“Anything?”
“I needed some things, for the snake.”
At the end of that hall was a massive chamber. His eyes went up six, seven stories before he lost count. It was difficult when the staircases kept moving. Some twisted on an axis, and as he watched one set turned completely smooth. A long flat ramp with a four story drop.
Harry had no answer to that. With all she was babbling about ancient Greece, it seemed her mind was firmly on Draco’s business. Was that why she was rushing it? Hurrying to get back to studying Harry? “Fixing” him?
“His dad was Voldemort’s right-hand man!

“Shut.

“Why are you friends with me?”
Harry sat up, waving Ron away when he tried to help, or maybe stop him. No pain came from his abdomen. He pushed the thin blankets away and pulled up the pale blue shirt he’d been dressed in.
With Malfoy?”
“House Elves are citizens now, Potter. Or wasn’t that the first thing Granger drilled into your head?”
It didn’t look like the man was really listening to him. He’d turned his gaze up, looking around them into the darkness.
George placed his hand over the one on his arm briefly. “Just having tea with our biggest shareholder. You’re early.”
Harry frowned, remembering the panicked way Draco had looked around. Suspicious. On his guard. Only Harry’s injury had distracted him from it.
“What - ?”
“I think about a thousand women would come forward claiming you as the father of their kids. No, really,” she giggled at his face, stopping the sink and squeezing some excess water from the collar. “It happens all the time, as it is.”
“Shut up.”
“Wait – that soap is

but excuses with you! How long are you gonna keep me in the dark?”
“Yeah? Who would that be?”
“What have I got to lose?” Draco smiled at him, which temporarily lifted the pallor from his skin. “Of course, I’ll deny all knowledge of this conversation in the morning.”
His voice had changed. It was blithe, uncaring.
And rightly so.
No one gets out of something like that without being completely fucked in the head.”
“It’s much too cold for that.
“It’s an act. With ‘Mione and me – and Ted – you’re just Harry. The rest…” Again, with the bloody scar. “Well, no one holds it against you. Much.”

person. He was nearly the height of the frame. Almost wiry, but with enough muscle to be noticeable. His short hair was bright ginger, and his t-shirt was an even brighter orange with a broomstick across the chest.
When he next snapped awake, it was without any apparent provocation. There was a vague panic in the back of his head. It slipped away as soon as he noticed it.
Harry made sure to toss the
She shook her head, disagreeing with him but falling asleep halfway through the motion. Harry stood there a moment before bending down and gently slipping the time turner from around her neck. It wasn’t pleasant to hold, and he avoided staring into the hourglass part of it as he set it on the mantle, next to the Floo powder.
She’d set the take away out on plates. Harry took one of the four chairs, waiting as politely as possible for Ron and Hermione to join him. Ron went to the fridge first, taking two beers and setting one down in front of Harry.
The looks were lingering. Some glanced away after meeting his eyes, abashed. Others didn’t look away quickly enough. It was like they

The ghost blinked, and then floated back up, straightening his waistcoat importantly. “Of course. Carry on, good sirs!”
. Running footsteps sounded somewhere beyond Harry’s field of vision. The man didn’t look up. He gazed at Harry with a strange, panicked intensity.
“Are you still there?” Harry asked, shoving his hands in his pockets.
He picked up the flasks and moved them over, glancing at Draco. His cheeks remained wet. “What’s all that about?”
“It’s been two months,” she hissed. Then she turned and jogged back to the house, leaving Harry standing at the gate by himself.
Harry did. The eggs were hot, and crunched between his teeth in an interesting way. It wasn’t at all perfect; the middle was liquid, like they’d been cooked too fast over a very high temperature. Better luck next time, house.
“And these…massive withdrawals?”
“It’s plenty warm down here. I don’t need to die a slow, painful death because I rolled on top of you and you bit me.”
A massive crack echoed through the alley. It was so loud and sudden Harry didn’t know where to look, reaching for his wand. The very next instant, he heard Draco’s voice.

Harry paused, moving back to the doorway cautiously. Draco beckoned him in, working on the second potion.
The photo was nice, though. It was a man and a young boy sat on a beach, wearing swimming trunks and squinting against the sun. The boy noticed the person taking the picture first, and tugged on the man’s arm until he too turned and smiled at the camera. They waved.
“Flickers?”
This silence stretched out. Horrible, meaningful silence. He knew what they were all thinking. Ron’s mum pulled out a chair, sinking into it and staring at him with glistening eyes. This was a mother figure to him. He knew this couldn’t be easy for her, and his heart ached. For all of them.
When she clicked the one visible button, the screen lit up, showing the time and date over a white background. “It’s very simple,” she explained. “The magic will keep this from making calls or connecting to the internet, but the camera should work just fine.” Her thumb pressed directly on the glass, where a small camera icon grew until the whole screen was an image of her knees and the table. She clicked a big circle near the bottom, and the image was captured.
“Potter!”
had come about touching Draco’s skin.
Ron leaned heavily against him on the way out, bemoaning his empty stomach. His whining had Hermione and Harry in stitches.
“It’s fine. I’ll take the groceries.”
“Flying? Like on a broom?”
“So did Hermione." He leaned in a bit. "She couldn’t find anything in here that explains why he could only do it once.”
Harry raised an eyebrow in silent challenge – he hadn’t yet mentioned Draco’s illegal use of
For the first time in memory, he got himself off. In the shower, steam rising all around, he rested his head on the cold wall and took himself in hand. It was a fucking weird thing to do, when he could so clearly visualize the
He took a step closer. “This is the history section.”
“I thought I’d take over. Unofficially. Just until you’re better. You can still help out around here, or not. I guess it’s up to you. “
He seemed to notice that, finally, blinking and touching his own face in confusion. “Would you fetch me a vial?”
“Wow,” he summed up. Ron grinned his agreement.
“Draco said he didn’t look like himself.”
“What fer? He’s the one who – “
Back in the bedroom, he dug through the chest of drawers. Everything looked the same. All the underwear was black, and the most colorful socks were pushed beneath the rest. In that same drawer were a number of medals. He picked one up, turning the gold medallion so it caught the light. Order of Merlin, First Class.

Harry swallowed a mouthful of chicken. “Yeah?”
He was relieved. He’d testified for Draco – that had to count for something. Defending him now wasn’t
Mahmoud seemed marginally more flustered now that he was no longer teaching. “At the moment, nothing comes to mind.”
Harry followed his gaze, frowning at the golden owl. “…Sounds good.”
“You had a memory?”
“It’s earmarked.”
“All of it,” he said, then thought better of it. “I mean, you’re so…”
,” George yawned, sticking a mug under the tap and heating it with a spell. “Drink it, and someone nearby will moon over you for an hour. Nothing too morbid – the fun’s in running around trying to figure out who it is.”
Wednesday morning dawned dull and very cold. The first thing Harry did was go to his window and look up at the sky. All of the mysticism surrounding this moon – the
Without having to think, Harry nodded fervently. They snuck out through a side door – accessible by going up the steps then immediately down a smaller and more crooked flight.
“Sorry, mate. I feel like one.” He slowed down just a bit, leaning in with a glance at Neville’s back. “Starthistles,” he whispered. “You helped plant them.”
And, from one of the lower rafters, a four-foot long cobra.
Ron rolled his wide shoulders. “Erm, you’ll see.”
Harry dropped the chip he was holding back into the pile. “You’re having me on. I
Harry didn’t buy it – George
After all, it was just a necklace.
“Pah!” George said, cooking toast with his wand and scooping beans from the stove pot, bumping Harry’s shoulder. “That wasn’t traced back to me. Staff just assumed. Could just as well have been Skele-Gro. Here.”
At the top of the flight was an unlocked door that led to a flat. The harsh, blinking lights of the sign outside were the only light filtering into the cramped sitting room, which was piled with cardboard sets of un-folded product boxes. Clearly more of a workspace than a parlor.
“No,” Draco said evenly. “No one.”
“How has work been?” Lee asked. Harry set a box aside and stretched his back.
“Produce a Patronus.”
Teddy squeezed his hand. “They’re saying your name!”
“I…” Teddy wanted him back. Did that mean Harry hadn’t completely ruined everything? “Whenever you want. You’ll still write, won’t you?”
A line formed on Ron’s brow. “Most of it got repossessed by the Ministry. After the raids, I mean. Probably unfairly – even my Mum had something to say about it, but you know how she is about heirlooms. You and I were only trainees while that was happening, though.”
It was a lot to hear. Harry did his best to take it all in before responding, because for all it was, it didn’t give him a lot of insight to himself. Except for one part –
“Are they looking for you?”
“No Apparating,” Dean said miserably, hopping down into the muddy gravel beneath the Castlehaven Overpass. His transfigured Wellingtons squelched. “No Floo. It’s barbaric.”
“Of course,” she moved to stand. “I will walk you out – “
“Harry,” she grunted, attempting to help in the half-carrying of her husband. “You know you’re welcome at ours.”
It started snowing around ten, building against the windowpanes in powdery, sifting piles. The first of the year, though according to Teddy Hogwarts had been covered in it for almost a week. Harry took a break to write him about it, wondering how to broach the news that Castor wasn’t a house pest, but a long term resident.
“Harry, me lad,” Lee said, sitting on the carpet in the sitting room. The fire was low, warm light against the neon that filtered through dark curtains. “How are you?”
“And I’ve never known you to take a day off. Not since becoming Head Auror. And if you weren’t at work you were with Teddy, and if you weren’t with Teddy...well, I don’t even know.”

Seamus seemed at a loss.
And next to that, Regulus. “How do you know – ?”
Nothing happened. No great shock.
Harry only nodded. He hadn’t been very involved with any of that since he woke up.
While he messed with the potion, Harry went to the window, rolling his shoulder. Not quite sunrise, but night was lifting. Ron wouldn’t be awake for at least an hour.
___________________________
Hermione was watching him. At the Weasleys’ that Sunday, she was at his shoulder or just across the room, barely speaking unless spoken to. Twice that week, she came to his house – despite the snake that so clearly terrified her – under the guise of bringing food or just sitting. It was driving him spare.
At Harry’s derisive snort, he jerked a thumb over his shoulder. “Oh yeah? Look at that?”
Now she was sleeping soundly. Ron had wound his arm around her in the night, his long legs propped on the table.
“Oh?” Draco said flatly.
Harry, unable to help himself, tucked in the edges of the covers round his shoulders. Something fell out from the fabric and hit his foot. The vial.
He swallowed, nearly choking. Harry hit him on the back.
