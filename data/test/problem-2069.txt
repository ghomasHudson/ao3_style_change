“Can I get a scotch on the rocks please?” A deep voice asked, Draco got the drink ready and turned to hand it to the person and froze.
Harry sat watching the doors, waiting for Draco to walk through them. He wishes he could have woken up with Draco, but he didn’t want his friends to worry about him. So, he returned in the middle of night not surprised to find Hermione and Ron waiting for him in the common room. He told them he had been on a walk and lost track of time.
“Harry, I want to taste you too.” Draco whispered licking his lips, his mouth watering for the taste of Harry. They readjusted so Draco lay on top of Harry, his asshole on full display for Harry to see (A/N: this would be a horrible time to fart…) and play with. Draco licked up Harrys twitching cock swirling his tongue around the tip before lowering his mouth around it. Harry was big and thick, and Draco loved it. Harry moaned out loud as Draco kept going lower and lower on his cock. He almost came as he watched all his cock disappear into Draco’s sinful mouth.
“Yes, I did. Ginny and I broke up a few weeks after the war. I caught her in bed with some random guy. When I confronted her about it, she just dumped me and went back to the guy. I went on a trip a few days later. That trip really helped me clear my mind and everything… it also helped me realize that I was gay and the only reason I had gone out with Ginny is because everyone expected us to be together. When I got back, I heard from Ron that Ginny had started to date Dean and I thought that was the end. After school started though Dean dumped Ginny to be with Seamus. Ever since then she has been throwing herself at me trying to get me to take her back. I have been tolerating it because she is Ron’s little sister, but I mostly try to avoid her. What happened this morning was another one of her pointless attempts to get back together with me. I swear Draco that I only see her as my best friends’ little sister. Please believe me when I say that you are the one that I want (A/N: oh oh oh honey).  What she did crossed a line and I will never let it happen again.” Harry said looking at Draco who was still staring at the ground.
"Yeah, I think I'm just going to go to bed." Harry responded standing up and walking out of the great hall.
"No...this is just a...break I guess you could call it. Usually heats last for a couple of days. The only way I know of to stop one quickly is to have sex with an alpha. A potion can help end it by a day or two but the best way to end it quickly is to uh......yeah..."Draco trailed off turning a bright shade of pink that Harry thought was adorable.
“I can’t believe you are here in my bed…naked. I spent months fantasizing about this, wondering what you would look like panting and moaning on top of my sheets as I thrust my cock into you.” Harry whispered into Draco’s ear nibbling on his lobe. Draco gasped out a moan his hips thrusting forward. His cock brushed against Harry’s and both shivered. Draco could feel Harry’s roughened hands trail down his back before coming to rest on his ass. Harry cupped Draco’s full ass and pulled him closer, so their cocks were continuously touching. He started to grind against Draco enjoying the younger man’s moans. With one hand he spread open Draco’s ass and probed at it with his free hand. He let out a surprised gasp when his fingers encountered a flat rubber piece.
"That will be all for today." McGonagall said breaking Draco out of his daydream of seeing Harry shirtless. He quickly stood and started to make his way out of the room when McGonagall cleared her throat.
“PAST NOON! We have to leave, I’ve already missed like three classes, oh my goodness what about your classes? WHY DIDN’T YOU WAKE ME UP SOONER!” Draco yelled freaking out, he tried to get up out of bed, but Harry stopped him.
“Fucking hell Harry! I don’t know how much longer I can last.” Draco moaned out rubbing Harry’s dick with his hand.  Harry turned Draco around and slammed his mouth onto Draco’s forcibly shoving his tongue into Draco’s mouth.  Harry lined himself up before slamming all the way into Draco’s tight hole.
“Why didn’t you come and talk to us about it?” Hermione asked feeling hurt that Harry hadn’t told them any of this.
"Well...if...you...if you want I could...help you...with your heat...onlyifyouwantmeto." Harry quickly said looking away.
“I’m sorry but I need to go, I’m going to be late for my other job! Thank you so much for this opportunity! I look forward to working with you!” Draco said gathering his bag and standing up, “Here is my number, call me when you need me otherwise, I’ll be in at the set times!” Draco said handing a card to Harry and walking out, what was with him being late today?
"The great Harry Potter is a vampire." Draco said stepping into the moonlight. Harry took a deep breath and held back a groan, it just had to be Malfoy. Draco looked more like a vampire then Harry did, with his pale hair and skin...his sliver eyes that reflected the moonlight perfectly, making them look like they were glowing.
“Good point. I want to find someone that will let me blindfold them, tie them down, and have my dirty way with them. I want to find someone that will kneel on the floor in front of me with their mouth wide open ready and waiting for me, I want someone that I can put a collar on so everyone that see’s it knows they are mine. Does that answer your question?” Harry said getting close to Draco’s face and whispering the last part.
"Oh, just shut up and kiss me." Draco gasped lunging forward, smashing his lips against Harry's. Draco didn't know if it was the heat or not, but he didn't really care right now. Harry had just admitted he found Draco attractive, and Draco wasn’t going to miss this chance.
“Draco I’m close.” Harry grunted out looking down at Draco. He looked so good kneeling in front of him, sucking his cock with such excitement, like he couldn’t wait to taste Harry’s cum. Harry threw his head back and came into Draco’s ready and waiting mouth.
"Not yet you’re not ready yet." Harry mumbled into Draco's neck licking at the rapid pulse. He tore Draco's  shirt open and made his way down, nipping and sucking at each nipple leaving little red marks all over Draco’s chest. Draco became a moaning mess beneath Harry his eyes wide with lust, lips swollen from hard kisses. He looked down in shock when he felt his pants being undone and pulled down. He watched as Harry not only pulled his pants down but his boxers as well.
“I bet you were thinking about how much you missed me.” Ginny said grabbing on to Harry’s arm and pressing her chest into it.
The four of them talked and joked around for a bit more before it was time for classes. They met Ron and Hermione at the doors, and they all walked to class together. For once Harry was happy most of his classes were with Slytherins.
“Oh, I have a simple one in here, its right through that door.” Harry said gesturing towards it. Draco quickly walked towards it before he lost his courage. Once inside he made sure the door was locked before quickly stripping his clothes off. Underneath he was wearing one of his best slave outfits. It consisted of chest straps that framed his pecs and had many places to hook the matching cuffs on his wrists. He also wore the matching underwear that exposed his ass, it covered his cock, but it was so snug not much was left to the imagination. Thigh high sheer stockings covered his legs, and he wore no shoes. Draco took a few more deep breaths; it was now or never. He quickly folded his clothes up and left them on the counter before slowly opening the door. He silently made his way over to stand in front of Harry’s desk. His whole body felt warm as he stood there with his arms behind his back. Even though he had worn far more revealing clothes before, this was the first time he had ever worn it outside of his bedroom. Harry had yet to notice Draco and was still intently looking through different papers and marking things on others. Draco cleared his throat. Harry looked up and dropped the pencil he was holding. He looked Draco up and down, his pants suddenly got much tighter.
“Uh…yeah I am. Sorry about earlier…it was just…surprising to see you here of all places.” Draco laughed nervously. He remembered Blaise’s words, he took a deep breath and put on his signature smirk.
“What’s wrong love? You’ve been sighing a lot.” Harry asked grabbing Draco around the waist and pulling him into his lap. Right now, they were in Harry’s home office. Harry was looking through papers and Draco was tidying the place up, some how no matter the short amount of time between cleanings Harry always managed to make a mess of his office.
“I’m CUMMING!” Draco yelled out cum shooting from his untouched dick onto the bed below him.  Harry kissed the back of Draco’s neck before biting into it again. At the same time, he thrusted as deep as he could go and shot his cum out filling Draco again. After a second Harry let go of Draco’s neck smirking at the second bite mark, he had left.  Draco flinched when Harry pulled his dick out of his ass. Harry whispered a cleaning spell and adjusted their positions, so Draco was laying on his chest. Soon they were both asleep.
“LEAVE ME ALONE,” Harry yelled making the Great Hall fall silent, “I DON’T WANT YOU! I NEVER WANTED YOU! THE ONLY REASON I WENT OUT WITH YOU IS BECAUSE THAT’S WHAT EVERYONE EXPECTED OF ME! I AM GAY! I LIKE MEN! FIND SOME ONE ELSE TO THROW YOURSELF AT BECAUSE I WILL NEVER EVER TAKE YOU BACK!” Harry screamed out finely yanking his arm free and storming out of the Great Hall. He looked around for Draco but didn’t see him. Harry ran in a random direction hoping to find Draco soon so he could explain what happened.
"Mine!" Harry growled slamming harder into Draco, pushing deeper and deeper. Draco responded with strings of words unable to make a coherent sentence anymore. Harry grabbed Draco's hips lifting them up a bit so he could go harder and faster. Harry grabbed Draco and pulled him up, so he was sitting in Harry's lap bouncing up and down on Harry's cock.
"Fuck Draco you’re so tight." Harry groaned opening his eyes and looking at where they were connected. Oh, merlin he could cum just from that. Seeing Draco's tight hole stretched around his dick was a gorgeous sight. Harry was beating himself up for waiting so long to talk with Draco.
“I’ve smelled so many peoples blood, but none have smelled as good as yours. I’ve been craving it all day please be my blood donor Draco.” Harry groaned nipping at Draco’s neck.  Harry trailed his fingers down Draco’s shirt unbuttoning it in the process. He pushed Draco’s shirt open and kissed his way down.  He nipped and sucked at Draco’s nipples.  While his mouth was busy sucking on Draco’s pebbled nipple his hands undid Draco’s pants and pushed them down. The blonde raised his hips up and shivered as the cold air hit his painfully hard penis.  Harry licked and sucked his way down tell he reached Draco’s twitching erection. Suddenly Draco’s penis was engulfed in warmth as Harry sucked as much as he could into his mouth. He ran his fangs gently against Draco’s cock as he moved his head up and down. Harry looked up and his green eyes met Draco’s sliver. He then lowered his head tell he could feel Draco’s dick touch his throat.
Hadrian watched as Arthur turned around and headed for the door; he slowly followed, walking softly in the hopes that Arthur wouldn’t notice him. Arthur used his wand to unlock the door and, as he pushed it open, Hadrian ran towards him, pushing his former friend’s father out of the way; as he crossed the doorway, Harry’s body was suddenly wracked with pain; his muscles seized, and he couldn’t stop the screams that were torn from his throat. It was worse than the time Voldemort had held him under the Cruciatus Curse, and even worse than last year, when Voldemort had possessed him the ministry. Hadrian felt hands pulling him out of the doorway, and he collapsed onto the floor of the shed, his limbs still twitching from the after-effects of the spell that had been on the doorway.
"Sure; let me just tell Lee and Angelina to watch the shop for us," Fred said, "George can take you upstairs to our flat."
"No thanks," Hadrian replied, "You were a big help Tillie." Tillie's eyes widened at the praise, but to Hadrian's relief she popped away without making a scene as Dobby would have done. Speaking of which, he should really let Dobby know he was okay; he'd have to make sure to contact him tomorrow.
“It’s actually quite common in pure blood families,” Draco said apologetically, “Most betrothal contracts are signed when the children are still quite young, with an engagement contract then signed and negotiated between the ages of fifteen and seventeen, and the marriage taking place between seventeen and twenty-one. Most of the time indiscretions are expected before the engagement contract is signed, with some families not requiring faithfulness until after the wedding as long as no children are born out of wedlock.”
“Thank you all for the lovely gifts,” Narcissa beamed, “Draco? Why don’t you and Hadrian take your friends upstairs? I will send a house elf when Madame Longbottom is ready to go.”
"What about the Weasley's?" Severus asked, "They helped cause a lot of your pain, and they assisted Dumbledore with kidnapping."
"You really should stop calling me that," Draco chided him, "After all, you're soon to be a Slytherin as well."
“No!” Potter protested, jerking his head back, “I don’t-it doesn’t matter what I like; you shouldn’t be here! And I don’t want any more! Let me go, and leave; n-Ow!” Potter’s rant turned into an exclamation of surprise, as the dildo was forced further inside him; Draco watched in the mirror as it slid between those firm globes, forcing its way through what was an undoubtedly tight little hole. “Fuck!” Draco almost jumped in surprise when Potter’s head fell forward to rest on his shoulder; the brunet was panting out hot little breathes against his neck, causing Draco to moan at the feeling.
"I'd like you to meet my son and heir, Draco Lucius Malfoy," Lucius lifted the bundle and tilted his arms so that his friends could see the baby; Draco had a small tuft of silvery-blonde hair and when his eyes opened they could see that they were a pale blue-grey.
“Oh yes,” Malfoy smirked, “I frequently dream of snogging you senseless, but that’s not all; would you like to hear what else I dream about doing to you?” Harry took a step back, not sure how to respond. At that moment, soft chime rang out and two letters appeared hovering in the air before them, saving Harry from having to answer; and why should he need to be saved from answering? Harry demanded himself as he reached for the letter addressed to him; of course the answer was no! He didn’t want to hear about any of the Slytherin’s perverted dreams; besides, he bit his lip, Malfoy was probably just setting him up for a joke anyway-there was no way that the blond would want him!
Harry turned down Mystic Alley and nodded a greeting to the other shop owners already out and about; only about five of the twenty shops were currently open, although most of the rest were scheduled to open over the weekend. As Harry neared his shop, which was about halfway down the alley, he noticed movement at the Dueling Dragons; he picked up his pace, hoping that he could catch the owner before they entered the store, and was just in time to see a dark-haired witch opening the door.
Shaking his head to clear his thoughts, Harry pulled out one of the magazines and flipped through it until he came upon a scene he had looked at a few weeks ago. In this scene, a male was standing above a stool, his legs on either side and heels on his feet. The man’s arms were attached to cuffs hanging from the ceiling, and he also had an anal hook with just the top inserted into his rectum, also bound to the ceiling. A cock ring was wrapped snugly around his erection, and clamps were on his nipples. The man also had on a blindfold, and an O-ring mouth gag. He wore a thick leather collar around his neck, which was attached to a ring in the floor, applying pressure for him to pull his head back. There were release methods mentioned, but Harry wasn’t worried about that, as he would-once again-set up the spells to give him access to his wand once the time was up, with an additional timed-spell set to release him in case he found himself unable to access his wand.
“Come upstairs,” Harry invited, drawing back a little, “Stay tonight. There’s enough room in the attic for Crispin so he stays warm-Sirius used to keep a Hippogriff in there.”
“I agree,” Draco nodded, “I suggested she seek sanctuary at Hogwarts, but only if she is truly abandoning the Dark Lord. What was in your letters?”
"The ritual will take a few more days to finish translating," Tom pulled out the notebook with the translation in it, "and it has to be started on the night of a new moon. Severus has said it will be best to remove the piece of soul from Hadrian and return it to me all in the same day."
“Fuck!” He cursed, clinging to the chains connected to his wrist cuffs as he attempted to pull himself up, and off the dildo. He was on his tiptoes, the chains around his ankles pulled taut as he tried to get away from the insistent press of the dildo. After a few seconds the dildo stopped moving, and Harry let out a sigh of relief; whatever had caused the dildo to lengthen was over now, and Harry concentrated on relaxing around the toy inside him. He had just gotten used to the fullness, when he felt the dildo begin penetrating him again, slowly but surely pushing into him. Harry whimpered as the dildo pressed against the vibrating bullet, a reaction timed spell causing the vibrations to increase in intensity. The increased vibrations balanced out the pain with pleasure as the dildo stopped moving once again, and Harry found himself rocking back and forth, impaling himself on the dildo another inch before the pain started again, and he had to stop, wincing in pain. He attempted to rise off the dildo, hoping to ease some of the pain, but found that the dildo moved with him, not allowing him any relief; he held perfectly still as he once again waited for his body to adjust to the intrusion.
"Well, the boy will be Hadrian Thomas Riddle," Tom smiled, "and our daughter is Aracely Lorelei Riddle."
"I would suggest Blaise, Theo and Pansy," Draco said, "I'm not too sure about Vince and Greg-Crabbe and Goyle-but you can meet them all at my party and we can discuss everything afterwards.” Draco stood up and stretched. “I'm going to change into my pajamas; if you look in the top drawer of my dresser you can find a pair to borrow."
"I discovered a secret chamber," Tom was saying, "Sev and Luca are coming with me to see it tonight, and I wondered if you would like to come too?"
“I expected as much,” Tom nodded, “We will have to find a mind healer that we can trust and then, once Bella and Rodolphus have been restored, we will get Miss Granger-"
“I already explained that last time,” Draco said patiently, “There have been multiple Santa’s throughout the ages; the first Santa was a Wizard, who later became recognized as a saint by Muggles-St. Nicholas. He was an orphan, raised by the Fae. When he became an adult, he wanted to make a difference in the world by bringing happiness to children, and several sprites decided to help him. With Fae magic, he was able to travel further than he could manage by himself, and they taught him to manipulate time. St. Nicholas had access to a Philosopher’s Stone, and lived far longer than your average Wizard; others grew jealous of his powers and longevity, so he and the sprites who followed him moved to what would become known as the North Pole. The sprites are what we eventually came to call Christmas Elves, and St. Nicholas became known by many different names in many different countries, but was eventually called Santa Clause by most.
“Make sure they are trustworthy,” Santa interrupted, “Yes, I remember Bernard; we have had this conversation before. This is precisely why I wanted to begin searching early; it could take years for me to find someone to marry, and I really do not wish to give up being Santa. As usual, I will spend the next month with my son, before returning here for two weeks. After that, I shall spend two weeks a month away from the North Pole to begin dating, and I shall increase that time as needed when I find a potential partner. Are you and Curtis prepared to implement our plan for running the North Pole while I am away?”
While Hadrian, Draco and Narcissa were at Diagon Alley, Lucius took the Floo over to Riddle Manor where Severus was working on the potion to restore Tom's sanity. When he got there, however, Lucius discovered that Severus was busy working on a potion and  did not wish for any company, so Lucius sought out Tom instead. His former master, and newly re-discovered friend, was happy for the company and the two sat down to enjoy a game of chess with Nagini curled comfortably at the base of Tom's chair.
"I am helping Daddy research the Crumple-horned Snorkack," Luna said, "He said that next summer we can go an expedition to try and find one. How are you feeling? Your back is better, I hope."
“That must be…my mother,” Hadrian whispered, speaking for the first time since they had started watching the scene, “I wonder who the man with her is?” Draco shook his head silently as the woman-Elena-spoke.
"Fine," Narcissa snapped, upset at being undermined by her husband, "but I don't want to hear about any of the pranks, and if they get caught
them to mistreat him-and with Harry's own money! Twenty-five hundred pounds was a lot of money; it translated to...500 Galleons a month; 6000 a year! Not only that, but he was doubling their pay so that the Dursley's would beat him, and he had given them potions to prevent Harry from fighting back! The last thought is what made him blanche; the thought of a professor giving someone potions to drug a student was...well, it was repulsive and Harry knew he needed to leave before his aunt and uncle had a chance to use any of the potions on him. Before he got a chance to do anything, however, the cupboard door was slammed open and Vernon Dursley reached in to grab him with one meaty hand.
"When he gets back perhaps we can have a look at the books," Narcissa suggested, "You never know, we may recognize the language. Now, how long have the boys been resting?"
"I grew up to be devastatingly handsome, of course," Draco smirked, preening a bit before frowning, "This doesn't make any sense though; according to everything we've been taught Voldemort was out killing Muggles at this point, not having babies with a beautiful American witch-and I know I've never heard of him being married!"
“I was thinking about that earlier,” Draco said, “and perhaps we should see if we can meet them at Longbottom’s house instead; Mother and Father won’t be pleased if we tell Granger and Weasley the truth without their permission, and they wanted to wait until Severus figures out a way to heal Aunt Bella.”
"Actually, if you aren't tired there are a few things we need to discuss," Tom said, "First, I have come up with a way to make sure that Dumbledore can't force you to go back to the Dursley's; since he believes you have asked for Sanctuary from Draco, Narcissa will go to the ministry next week and apply for custody of you until you turn seventeen."
When Harry fell asleep that night, it was with a smile on his face, secure in the knowledge that, for at least that night, he was still the one in Draco’s arms.
“I’ll tell them I have news about my apothecary, so that we can surprise them with the news,” Draco agreed, leading his husband to the fireplace; both men had forgotten that Snape was still in the room with them, but the once-dour Potions Master didn’t seem to mind. He watched with a small smile as Draco threw the Floo powder down, before stepping into the fireplace and drawing his husband into his arms. Harry stared up at his husband with an expression of pure love and trust, before leaning his head on Draco’s shoulder as the flames whisked the two away.
"I am very disappointed to hear that," Dumbledore’s voice was grave, and Harry eagerly anticipated the headmaster telling Vernon off, "I will make sure those that would look in on young Harry are busy elsewhere so that you may resume normal treatment of the boy; we have worked too hard to mold the boy how I need him to be and any deviation from the normal conditioning you put him through every summer could disrupt everything we have done."
“I-It doesn’t matter anymore,” Harry said, “I’m never going back there again, so…it’s-it’s not important. It’s over and done with. Isn’t it time to eat?” Draco’s eyes flashed with some emotion Harry was unable to identify, but the blond evidently decided against saying anything, choosing to return to his own chair instead.
“Is he here now?” Narcissa inquired, looking around the empty room. Draco shook his head, and she turned back to the doorway, “Then let us continue; we can worry about the Muggles later.” Draco swept in front of his mother, leading the way to the stair case. His foot was on the bottom step when he paused and turned to look at the door set in the wall beneath the staircase; the cupboard under the stairs. Slowly, as if compelled, he walked over to the door and pulled it open; Narcissa looked over his shoulder and saw that the small closet contained a cot to one side, and floor-to-ceiling shelves of cleaning supplies on the other. On the back wall, a small picture was taped, showing a family of three smiling happily while a dark-haired boy stood to the side, tears running down his face. At the bottom of the picture were two headstones, with the names James and Lily written on them. The picture was depressing and gave great insight to Hadrian’s treatment at the hands of these Muggles. By the date written in the bottom right corner, Hadrian was only seven when he drew this.
"They were planning to return after lunch," Lucius replied, casting a quick tempus he added, "Which could be any time in the next hour or so. We got a good start on translating those books Sev; do you want to read what we have so far?"
"Of course, Mr. Malfoy," Hadrian agreed, "Or, we could just tell her that I'm the Dark Lord's son and she has to obey me or…I'll let Severus use her for potions ingredients. That's believable, right?" Hadrian directed the question at Draco, who shook his head.
The vibrations stopped after a few minutes, leaving Harry with nothing to do but think about how cold he was getting. The cock ring easily picked up the chill from the spell on the stool, but it did feel a little loosed now as his balls were shrinking away from the cold. Oh! Maybe he could get the cock ring off! He wasn’t sure how he would manage without the use of his hands, but Harry was certain he could get the cockring off if it just got loose enough. Harry sat on the school, shivering from the cold seeping into his skin as he realized that setting the timer for an hour was probably not the best idea since this was his first time experimenting with bondage.
"I do," Hadrian replied, "I acknowledge that my true name and identity is that of Hadrian Riddle, son of Elena Pruitt and Tom Riddle. I reject the name and identity of Harry Potter as a figment created by Albus Dumbledore." There was a flash of bright light as magic took his words as truth.
“Good evening, students!” Dumbledore said cheerfully as he stood behind the head table, “before we conclude this fine meal, I have an announcement to make. As you are all aware, our world has recently been torn apart by war and, though we have survived, there are still wounds that need to be healed. If we have learned anything it is that we are strongest when we all work together, and division weakens us. The war is over, the enemy defeated, and it is now time to move beyond our differences towards a brighter future.” A pause, then, “I am very disappointed to inform you that not all of the students have shown a willingness to move on from the past. Certain individuals have been the victims of cruel pranks and painful hexes, for no other reason than their last name or the House that they belong to. It is for this reason, that I have decided to make some changes. Effective tonight, the Sixth and Seventh Years will all be moving dorms. I have arranged for new dormitories to be set up; each dormitory will have four bedrooms sharing a common room, and there will be one student from each House sharing the common room.” There was a loud outcry at this, with several students protesting. Dumbledore allowed it to continue for a few moments before regaining their attention and resuming his explanation.  “I have already made the room assignments, and there will be no changes; anyone who is incapable of getting along with another student will be escorted from the grounds and invited to continue their education at a different institution. I will now give the floor to my esteemed Deputy, Professor McGonagall.
"Thank you Griphook," Hadrian echoed as he and Draco followed Narcissa out into the hall where another goblin was waiting to take them down to the vaults. The cart ride was uneventful as Narcissa took out money for herself and Draco, while Hadrian filled his own pouch with coins from the allowance vault Tom and Elena-his parents-had set up for him when he was a baby. By the time they reached the lobby Griphook was already waiting for them; he handed them a small steel box which he informed them held the volumes requested by Tom Riddle, and Narcissa shrank it to fit in her purse before thanking Griphook once again and leading the boys back out into Diagon Alley.
“Well, it would be rude of me to say no now, wouldn’t it?” Draco drawled as he released Hadrian’s hand to link arms with his mate, “Very well; this way.”
“Actually, there may still be hope for him,” Narcissa said, “Lucius told me that one of Dumbledore’s memories showed him casting a spell just as Sirius fell; Lucius believes-and Severus agrees-that it is likely Sirius was banished somewhere and is still alive. I think that they may even have an idea of where he is being kept, but they have not shared that information with me.”
“Good thing it didn’t listen,” Draco said, “I can’t imagine you in Gryffindor, wearing that atrocious red and gold.”
"Because I saw the memories myself," Hadrian replied quietly, "How do you think I felt? I spent the last sixteen years believing my parents were James and Lily Potter, killed by Lord Voldemort, only to find out that Voldemort was created by Dumbledore and is, in fact, my father. Not only that, but both of my parents are alive, and I have a twin sister out there somewhere, plus who-knows-how-many other family members that Dumbledore never told me about. He destroyed my childhood, messed with everyone's memories, and paid Muggle's to abuse me my whole life. Fred, George-I know this is hard to believe, but it's the truth, and I need you guys now more than ever. Also, I'm not Harry anymore-it's Hadrian Riddle, at least in private with people I trust."
“…just be glad your nephew is a better person than I am. If it were not for him stopping me, you and your despicable husband would be dead now,” Narcissa Malfoy hissed, “I don’t care what the old man said, Harry is never returning here, and you had better not ask after him, if you know what is in your best interest. If I hear even a rumor of you asking about Harry, or looking for him, I will kill you; I shall just have to hope that Harry will forgive me, eventually. Now, be gone.” Vernon and Petunia Dursley, both pale as ghosts, fled the train station once they were given permission, and then Narcissa turned to the small boy standing behind her, hands clutching tightly to the handle of his school trunk.
After a few minutes, Harry finally calmed down and pulled away. He tilted his head back to look at Draco, and then suddenly Harry was leaning forward and kissing him. Draco didn’t move, not to kiss back, not to push him away-and Harry suddenly realized he was kissing his best friend; with a sudden panic, he pulled back and turned to run, but Draco caught his arm and pulled him back in for another kiss. This time, Harry felt Draco’s lips move against his own, and long fingers, carded through his wet hair, relaxing and exciting him at the same time.
“No!” Harry protested, backing away from him, “I do not want to know what type of pervy dreams you have about me!”
forcing Aracely into an arranged marriage; he’s gotten better, but you know he still isn’t completely sane. Remember, you can check on her whenever you want, and if things get worse then we can get others involved.”
After supper Harry, Draco, and Teddy went to the family room, where their undecorated Christmas tree was set up to the left of the fireplace, in front of a window overlooking the back garden. Next to the tree, were the brand-new lights Harry and Draco had purchased a few weeks ago. Teddy was settled on a nearby chair with a cup of hot cocoa, while Draco and Harry worked to layer the lights on their fifteen-foot pine tree. Draco had pointed out that it would be easier with magic, but Harry had refused; instead they had a large ladder (from the Rose Suchak Ladder Co.), and Draco somehow found himself climbing up it to make sure the lights were wound all the way to the top of the tree. It was annoying, and Draco once thought about just knocking the tree over, but Harry’s laughter and Teddy cheering him on made the situation worth it.
“Er, right,” Harry agreed, as Pansy then insisted he wear at least one bell bracelet and a black choker with a gold bell.
"Duly noted," Draco said, ", perhaps you can help me out. We told you about that collar Hadrian is wearing; I want to find something that has similar protection charms on it without the whole having-to-obey me thing. There are other ways to get him to do what I want that would be much more enjoyable." He and Fred shared a knowing look, smirking, and then the red-head turned thoughtful.
"Then my distraction worked," Draco teased, "I believe you know everything of importance anyway; the rest is just small details. The only thing tomorrow is to make sure you don't get too friendly with any of the guests; my temper may be a bit explosive."
“After everything I have done-everything I have sacrificed-still you do not trust me,” Severus scowled, “I have done everything you asked of me, including belittling the son of the only woman I have ever loved, and you still think that I will betray you. What must I do to earn your trust?” Severus glared at the headmaster, and received a sad smile in return.
“The Keeper?” Draco offered with a smirk, “And the less powerful partner is the Chaser. Or,” his grin turned wicked, “Shall we call you the Snitch, and I’ll be the Seeker?”
“Okay, now pick him up and I’ll fix the bed,” Hadrian said; Draco carefully picked Arden up and smiled when the miniature dragon curled up in his arms. A few spells later and Hadrian had the bed fixed; he then summoned the bedding from his room and piled it at the foot of the bed. “This way we can have our bed, and Arden can have his nest,” he explained to Draco.
“Yeah,” he replied, “You can stop being such an ass since we’re stuck together for Merlin knows how long.”
“Stay up there, Draco,” Harry called, “I’m sending Teddy up so you can help him put the topper on the tree.” Harry climbed up the ladder right behind Teddy, and handed Draco the topper, which was a wire star wrapped in silver tinsel with multi-colored lights around the edge. Draco held onto Teddy as the seven-year-old leaned over to place the star on the very top of the tree, and the young Metamorphmagus cheered when it was done.
"I was always okay," Draco returned with a sneer, "It was that useless Parkinson who was almost in trouble." He pressed a soft kiss to the side of Hadrian's neck, relishing in the shiver it produced. "I do, however, thank you for your offer of assistance-I really would hate to have to kill someone this early on in the relationship. Crabbe-you and Goyle may go now." The two lumbering Slytherin's left without another word-not that they had actually said anything to begin with.
"You are in my room Potter," Draco replied, trying to make his voice low and soothing so that Potter wouldn’t panic, "We were discussing your reasons for being here when you passed out in pain; you have three broken ribs, and your back has several lacerations which were bleeding."
approached and offered the chance to become the new Santa Clause. I accepted and, after training for a year with the previous Santa, moved to the North Pole fulltime. I-”
"Episkey," Severus murmured, and Hadrian winced as his broken nose fixed itself. Severus reached into the small emergency potions kit he always kept with him, and pulled out a small tin of thick blue paste, which he then slathered on Hadrian's bruises. "The damage to your vocal cords was caused by magic," Severus said, "Did you hear Weasley cast a spell?" Hadrian shook his head in the negative, "Did you say something that angered him?" Hadrian nodded. "Well, it is possible his accidental magic is affecting your vocal cords," Severus pulled out a vial of green potion the bag he always kept with him, and held it out to Hadrian; "A simple healing draught should fix you vocal cords, along with the smaller injuries inflicted by Weasley. Drink this Hadrian, and stop scowling at me." Hadrian stuck his tongue out at the potions master and grudgingly accepted the potion-sure, he couldn't speak, but that didn't mean he wanted to take another vile tasting potion. He glared at the potion suspiciously for a moment before tilting his head back and downing it in one go, making a disgusted face at the bitter taste that lingered on his tongue.
"Yes, such a horrible birthday," the sarcasm in Hadrian's voice was pronounced, "You got a party with your friends and family, a table-full of gifts, and you managed to convince some deity to make me your mate, forcing me to be with you unless I want you to die,” He shot a glance at Draco, and found that the blond was scowling at him, "What? I was just kidding!”
Finally, however, Ron got lucky, and a spell hit Hadrian, making him stumble. Hadrian grabbed onto a tree for support, and then looked around in confusion. Where was he again? And what was he supposed to be doing? He thought he was supposed to be looking for someone, but he couldn’t remember who.
For the next hour, Harry writhed on his bed, thankful of the silencing charm on his door which allowed him to moan his pleasure-and groan in frustration-without having to worry about anyone hearing him. When the hour was up, Harry quickly stroked himself to completion and barely had enough energy to put his toys away before he fell into a peaceful sleep.
"That's horrible!" Elena cried, "I can't believe Dumbledore would do something like that; my mom always said that Dumbledore was a great wizard and trustworthy, otherwise she never would have let me, Alec, and Jasper come here. Of course, Daddy always said he never trusted him but…" She frowned as she thought it over and then met Tom's dark brown eyes with her own emerald green, "I believe you Tom, and I will stand by you no matter what." She placed her hand in his and Tom gave a small relieved smile as he looked around at the other students.
"Yes!" Hadrian cheered, then he frowned when he tried to get up and Draco didn't loosen his grip; "Dray-what are you doing? Come on; let's go fly!"
Draco stepped into the room, and immediately noticed that it was decorated differently than most of the rooms in the family wing. The room was decorated in jewel tones of green and blue, with silver accents. However, Draco’s gaze was quickly drawn to the bed, where he realized a figure was sleeping. The figure was buried in blankets, only a mop of messy black hair-Draco’s eyes widened, and he looked over his shoulder to see his mother smirking at him. He tore his gaze away to look back at the bed, and then looked at her again, and she nodded in encouragement.
“That’s okay,” Harry shook his head, “I mean, there isn’t really a point, is there? Not when we’ll be…consummating the bond soon anyway.”
“Barring any massive emergencies, I do not return to work until the second week of January,” Draco confirmed, “Healer Meadows made sure that I am the last name on the St. Mungo’s emergency roster this year.”
“I see,” Narcissa said thoughtfully, before giving him a small smile and a kiss on the forehead, “The Greengrass’s will be here in an hour; make certain you are downstairs before they arrive.”
"Not my fault," Hadrian pouted, blushing, "I had to wear my cousin's old hand-me-downs; it would be nice to have my own clothes, although I don't know how it would feel to wear something that actually fits…"
“I-doesn’t hurt,” Harry said between sobs, “I just-no one ever-for me!” His words were broken and confused, but Narcissa understood him perfectly.
“I think I’m about ready for bed,” Draco said, “The bed is big enough we should both be able to sleep on it and still have plenty of room.”
“Just lay down,” Draco said, getting Harry to lay with his head in Draco’s lap, “Now close your eyes and relax. I’ll be here the whole time, and I will wake you before we get to Hogsmeade.”
"Look," Draco murmured, pointing to the passage Severus had read earlier, "They created three Horcruxes but didn't go insane; the only problem they came across was not being able to have children."
“Just a moment,” Malfoy frowned, “What do you mean Potter is getting tormented by the professors? I hardly think you can consider detention to be a torment.”
“Spoil sport,” Draco teased with a pout, “Very well; do you know what any of the Dark Lord’s weaknesses are?”
“The translation,” Harry quickly said, “The more reliable information will probably be in the older books, right?”
“Perhaps a locating potion would work,” both men looked up as Tom entered the drawing room at Riddle Manor, “Dumbledore may have most locator spells blocked, however a potion that relies upon a blood relation should work; you keep some on hand, do you not Severus?”
Satisfied that Draco's gifts had been taken care of Hadrian moved to the door connecting the two rooms and entered Draco's bedroom; surprisingly the blond was already dressed-wearing black slacks, a silver button up shirt and a robe the same color as Hadrian's- and he was just finishing fixing his hair.
“Oh,” Harry said quietly, then gave Draco a grin, “If that was a proposal, you suck. I mean, the words were nice and all, but you kinda forgot the ring, and you never actually asked.”
As they entered the room, Narcissa made her announcement-adding that paying too much attention to Harry-now-called-Hadrian would earn them animosity from her Veela son and that he would likely attack first and ask questions later. With the explanation-and warnings-given the boys once again mingled among the guests, but this time Draco kept his arm firmly around his Mate. Arden was also by the boy's side; the little dragon had turned down Draco's offer to pick him up and instead walked in front of the boy's as they traversed the ballroom, sitting down directly in front of them whenever they stopped.
"Is Hadrian really your mate then?" Blaise asked curiously, "Or was all that just for show so that you could explain him being here."
While he was watching the interaction between Tom and Bella Hadrian became aware of a soft growling sound and he realized with a start that it was Draco; the blond was glaring at Bella with eyes like molten silver, his lips were pulled back in a snarl to reveal pointed canines and when Hadrian glanced down he saw that Draco had sprouted claws.
"You can probably talk to her and Hermione at the same time, but we need to make sure they can get away from Mum for a bit first," Fred said.
"You really trust them?" Hadrian nodded and the blond sighed, "Very well; send them a letter back and invite them to come through the Floo-I'll reset the one in the study down the hall to allow them through. They just call out Malfoy Manor-Blue Study."
"I'm taller than he is," Draco scowled as Hadrian laughed at him, "I think I liked Luna and Neville better; at least they didn't mock me. And he looks different because now he actually resembles his father."
After Arden returned, I packed a few things for you. The package has a shrinking charm, and contains a basket that is connected to our kitchens so that you can be certain of having untainted food; any food that Dumbledore provided is likely to be spiked with potions. The package also contains several potions that might be useful (all labeled so you don’t get them mixed up), as well as a communication mirror. The other half of the mirror is in the study near my room. Someone will be in the room with the mirror at all times, so you can contact us whenever you feel that it is safe. All you have to do is tap the mirror with your wand and say “Malfoy Manor”.
Harry feels his face flush and hopes it won't be too obvious under the dim lights of the bar. "It's new," he acknowledges.
"I would like to know however," Draco continues, "what your intentions are Potter. As this feels a bit like a date."
It’s only a moment before Draco hugs him back, hand releasing the door and wrapping his arms around Harry, pulling him in tight. There’s nothing he can pick that’s different from all the hugs he’s had before, except for all the ways it feels different. Draco hugs him, and it feels right, feels like coming home.
“Wasn’t sure you’d come,” Harry says, when he finds Draco tucked into a corner, nursing the same Firewhiskey he’s had all night.
“I’m not sure. I might take a break, maybe help Hagrid out for a bit over the summer. I think I might like that. I didn’t really have much planned, I’ll be honest. Hadn’t thought much past taking a break from it all, and getting away for a bit. But that was before…”
It's hot and tight and slick, and it's so much Harry lets out a broken moan that he does a shit job of smothering against Draco's skin.
“No!” He can hear his voice, high pitched and not remotely under control, and Draco pulls his arm back around him, wrapping it tight, and covering up his ribs, as if to guard them from Harry.
“I’ll sit down,” Draco says, with a smile. He’s rocking side to side slowly, the slow movement that Lily loves. It’s like he’s dancing a slow dance with Lily, his arm around her and her little hand bunched up against his chest. Harry loves them so much. “I wanted to get some of the essays marked, so if you can get her to sleep I’d love you forever.”
With the door open Harry can see a ramp leading into the shop and up, not more than a step. The ramp goes about a yard or so inside, but the rest of the shop is still obscured.
"No," Draco responds, without looking up from his work, hands still working. His sleeves are rolled up to his elbows, and Harry takes a step further, trying to look at what Draco has in front of him—a machine of some sort. Harry can't tell any further, and why did he even think he'd be able to tell in the first place? "I'd invite anyone to try and make their way out of the shop without paying what they owe. It would make my afternoon."
"Well it’s not your house, I won’t leave it to you if that’s what you want." Regulus shrugs and looks at Draco, "I’d pass the house over to you if you wanted it. I guess you’re next in line."
“You’re busy,” Harry supplies, voice sad. Draco doesn’t look up. He can’t, even if he can’t read the words in front of him.
Harry jerks in Draco’s arms, all comfort gone with the words. It must be so obvious, but Draco doesn’t loosen his arms. His thumb is back, rubbing a pattern against his hip. It’s still comforting, even as Harry’s body feels like it’s thrumming from the tension.
sign that had been spelled to always look like it was front on, regardless of the angle. There's nothing that's particularly out of place in the area, but Harry can't help his slight sense of unease.
Harry takes their dishes to the kitchen and Draco follows along behind, watching with some humour as Harry runs the sink, spelling the water hot and then adding in a splash of washing-up liquid.
The kitchen is clean, which isn’t what Harry had been expecting. He knows he left half a sink of dishes, not to mention the dishes that Draco hadn’t got around to drying. There’d been their wine glasses too—but they’re nowhere to be seen.
"I survived perfectly fine without you before you were my partner," Harry points out. “But I would miss you."
"I know something’s been on your mind. Some days you're just so distracted. You should talk to me," Draco says, with another yawn. "If not now, then later."
Draco brings the wine to his lips, and Harry’s hands still on the cutting board as he turns his attention to Draco, even if does his best not to flat out stare.
Draco kisses like fire, hot and all-consuming. Harry’s hands feel stuck to Draco, like anchors tying them together, but Draco’s hands move, the hand on Harry's hip sliding up to his ribs, the one one on his shoulder sliding to his neck, thumb brushing against his jaw line. Draco's touch makes Harry yearn, makes his mouth fall open on a groan, makes his own hands grip tighter as Draco slips his tongue into Harry’s mouth.
magic." Draco reaches for his glass, swirls it around for a moment as he watches it. "They’re the most powerful thing we have."
"You’ll have to forgive him," Draco says. "He wasn’t aware of the requirements of maintaining a house such as this. He didn’t realise the consequences of leaving it empty."
in front of someone that eases the way, and it might not be Harry’s favourite part of the job, but it brings him satisfaction to give a resolution to those affected. He knows better than most that it won’t bring back the dead—dead's dead, and not even justice will ever change that—but it helps those they leave behind.
He rolls over quickly, scooping Draco into his arms and tucking Draco under his chin. If this is a dream, then there’s no saying when he’ll wake up. If it’s a dream it’s
"Oh Malfoy," Harry says, his voice faux-sweet. "Please, with your superior knowledge of pure-blood rituals and lived experience of magical houses, and your
Draco takes Harry's glass, placing them both on the table—on coasters Harry can't recall seeing—and then Draco's hands are on his chest, pressing back against him. The hands press in and Harry stands there until Draco pushes his weight against Harry and Harry understands he means for Harry to
There’s too much, too many thoughts running round his head, and Draco’s not sure he knows how to explain, when he’s not sure he knows himself.
"Right." Harry lets his eyes fall shut, lets himself lean against Draco, relaxing into the press of his hands and the feel of his body. He could get used to this.
"Doesn’t make them any less bullshit," Harry adds, partially to be contrary, and maybe because of his own history with prophecies. Being fucked over by one before he could even talk and having the majority of his life shaped by a few words can have that effect on a person. "They’re just words anyway, is there really any magic in them?"
The door swings open and the breath Draco had been holding releases all at once when he sees the room. It’s still exactly as he remembers, the bookshelves in all the same places, and even though the air tastes musty and stale, Draco feels like it’s the first real breathe he’s taken since he saw the marks on Harry’s skin.
when he’s reminded of the fact by the noise of a book dropping loudly on the table. Draco, flinches, eyes shooting up, looking for the owner of the book and finding—
For someone who said he wasn’t going to do any work, he is doing a lot of work, walking into dusty rooms and running his hand over every surface he finds. Draco’s covered in dust and even has a cobweb in his hair, and Harry isn't sure if he doesn’t know, or doesn’t care. It had surprised Harry at first when Draco had jumped straight in at their first scene together. These days it doesn’t surprise him, probably would have been more surprised if Draco had actually stayed out of it. His curiosity always wins out in the end. Whilst Harry enjoys the investigation enough, it’s not what he
Harry wants to ask, but the tone in Draco's voice says he's only asking for one reason. Harry's voice can't work.
He scrambles backwards, falling back against the mattress, rushing to get away from Harry in a mad rush of uncoordinated limbs. He definitely kicks Harry in the process, feels muscle beneath his foot before he gets caught in the sheets, falling to the floor and taking half the bedding with him, and any remaining air forced out of his lungs in a rush.
Draco takes a deep slow breath, the sound loud in the silent room. He sighs on the exhale, and his body relaxes a little, only perceptible because Harry's watching, and he couldn't say what's changed exactly.
He’s not sure how well he’s succeeded. The house almost seems resistant to it; the books on the bookshelf he ordered last night have been rearranged, the living room furniture has moved around, and the blanket he folded away last night was pulled across the living room floor. That, at least, he’s righted, but he had to leave the furniture, and he couldn’t stop looking around at the house and imagining Draco judging him for it. It’s especially hard when he’s seen inside Draco’s home, the sharp flat that wouldn’t look out of place in a housing magazine, everything ordered and with its perfect placelines, with green luscious plants in every room. It’s a stark contrast to this dusty and discoloured house, the light that doesn’t seem to reach the corners of the rooms. At least the portraits are gone now, courtesy of Hermione’s hard work—first to disable the charms on the portraits, and then to remove them from the wall. It’s something at least.
“Fluxweed,” he whispers, hoping the password still works, hoping it didn’t close down like Snape’s offices had after his death.
"Your core still looks the same," Regulus says. "Besides, you look just like Narcissa. I don’t think you could be anyone but her son."
“Hello,” he says, as if he were greeting an old friend and not a semi-sentient door to a semi-sentient room.
“A bit,” Draco admits. “Might take a nap later if she goes down. I forgot how horrible teething is.”
He wants it all, can’t think for the want pulsing through him. He lets his body take over, working on instincts alone when his fingers grip into the sheets, using the leverage to push back against Harry. It finally gives him some friction against his own cock, forcing a moan from them both.
Which finds him sitting on the living room floor, legs pressed up against Draco’s as Draco marks essays and Harry watches Lily have tummy time.
He follows the course his eyes had taken before down Draco’s chest, mouthing briefly against his nipples then slipping further down. He mouths at Draco’s belly button for a moment, feeling Draco twitch below him, before he follows the trail of hair, pressing kisses against the hair that tickles at his lips.
Draco pulls his hand away from the box, and motions at Harry to come closer. Harry moves to stand in front of Draco, the bench between them, and Draco reaches out with his left hand for Harry's right arm, grabbing his wrist and pulling Harry's hand towards the box. Harry splays his hand out, resisting a little—afraid of touching it, of breaking something that seems so fragile, delicate, that Draco's obviously spent time on and clearly cares for. But Draco just pulls his hand to just above the box, holds it there.
"Of course you do Potter. Who doesn't?" Draco says with a flashy grin. He takes a sip of his wine, finishes off the glass. "That's enough."
Harry treasures every time. He’s trying not to rely on it, but it’s hard not to, getting harder to resist. It’s a treat, really. When he’s had a hard day he doesn’t fight the urge to head to the Room of Requirement, one foot in front of the other until he’s back to the third floor corridor again.
“We talk about all sorts of things,” Ginny says, fondly, softly, and with just a hint of an eye roll. “Have you?”
Draco's starting to feel familiar already. The feel of his lips, the taste of his mouth, the way he leans into Harry, the hands Harry feels like he knows already, just from all the time he's spent watching them in the past. Harry presses his body against Draco, and Draco presses back too. Harry can feel every press of Draco's body against his, and wants to feel more. His hands roam as if they're acting on desire and not thought, roaming over Draco's body, one hand slides to Draco's lower back, pulling him in even tighter, holding Draco against him, and his right hand finds its way to Draco's hip. Draco's shirt is barely tucked in, and it's the easiest thing to do to sneak his fingers underneath it, to find Draco's skin, warm beneath his touch.
Lately when he can’t sleep, he’s taken to walking the castle. He can say he’s patrolling for students after lights out. He tries telling himself the same thing, but the words sound empty. He walks around with the sole purpose of drowning out the voices in his head — his own thoughts, and Draco’s words, running around in his head over and over, like a record on repeat. Even if that’s a failure of epic proportions. He’s never ended up here before, though. The familiar corridor and door, one he’s seen so many times before. He can’t remember the last time he came here, not since — well, it doesn’t bear thinking about, really.
Draco wakes to the feeling of someone in the bed behind him. There’s a press of lips against his neck, warm and gentle, and it only takes a moment before Draco is melting into it, moaning into the pillow. He takes a moment to appreciate it, the way Harry’s body is laying on top of his, almost pinning him to the mattress. One of Harry’s arms is wrapped around him, hand gripping his hip and fingers rubbing small circles against his skin. Draco can feel Harry’s hardness against him, rocking against his arse in movements that aren’t subtle at all, and he can feel Harry’s cockhead leaking against his back. He was already half hard when he woke, and his cock is fattening up beneath him, almost painful where it’s trapped against the sheets. Draco wants to move, wants to get his hand on Harry and wank him off again, wants Harry’s fingers on him, or maybe in him, and
It isn’t, and it’s not what Draco had been asking, not really, not at all. It defeats the purpose of
“I always want to get into your pants,” Harry agrees, “but I’d be happy just to give you a massage now.”
"I don't know," Harry admits, and he feels Draco's hands start to lift, feels Draco start to lean away. Harry moves quickly, one hand trapping Draco's where it rests on his. "I don't know what I want. But I know I want to do this."
The touch can only be Draco, and he’ll know what to do, Harry can always rely on Draco on the field. Harry turns, lifting his hands out of the soapy water and making a fucking
He drifts off like that, somewhere between the space of awake and asleep, but he feels more at peace than he can remember feeling lately.
"No," Malfoy says, with a grimace. "No, you'd definitely know if the house was dead. It's just like it's… Not connected to you."
, which is definitely not a thing he should be thinking about his work colleague. "I guess if it means that much to you, I’ll be there. You better have breakfast ready for me, and something better than the shit cereal you usually eat." Draco takes another sip of his tea, uncrossing his legs and stands up. "I’ll bring the coffee, so that’ll be good at least." Draco walks around to his desk, taking his seat and placing his cup down. Harry turns his attention back to the report. It’s another cold case, written with about the same amount of respect Harry gave to his Potions essays at school. So far he’s yet to glean anything of use from it.
His hands continue their path, tracking a path over Draco’s body from the tips of his shoulders and his neck down to the dip just above his arse. It’s not until his hands do another pass down that he sees the way Draco thrusts his hips into the mattress, and now that he’s noticed he can’t miss it, the way Draco rolls his hips. It’s so small Harry’s not even sure if Draco knows he’s doing it, but now Harry’s noticed, he feels like he can’t ignore it.
The distance gives Harry space to breath, even if blood is still pounding through his veins, loud in his ears.
Draco's changed since the Aurors. Gone is the athletic physique required by the DMLE, and without it Draco looks…
It’s almost comical how much he wants this, how much the want ignites a fire inside of him. The want has been inside him for so long but Harry’s been pressing it down, and now he’s acknowledged it, it’s like opening the floodgates.
Bed is upstairs again, a luxurious-looking room with a large window, but Harry pays it all no mind because Draco pushes him towards the bed, and Harry goes.
which could mean anything. The door is ornate, a wooden frame and glass with some sort of metal weaving across it. The door looks older than the rest of the shop, and stands out from the rest of the buildings in the way it's
"That was not nice," Harry says, feeling a little indignant in the face of Draco’s laughter. Draco has placed his own glass back on the bench and is hunched forward, forearms braced against his knees. Harry thinks he can see a shine to his eyes. Harry's face is red now, but at least his erection has flagged a little in the wake of his blunder and Draco’s obvious entertainment.
Even with the disclaimer it feels loaded, and Harry stands out the front of the shop and tries to work out if he does.
Regulus waves the words away dismissively, and just like that he is every bit the aristocat again, looking down his nose at Harry—which shouldn’t even be possible given that Harry has definitely got a few inches on him.
Harry's fingers brush against the waistband of Draco's trousers, ghosting over the skin just above it. He feels Draco twitch, feels the inhale of his breath as Harry's fingers trace the line of it, and just the hint of a touch is enough to send a rush of blood to his rapidly swelling cock.
Draco breaks the kiss with a gasp, a sharp intake of breath, and he half curls his body into Harry, dropping his head to rest on Harry's shoulder. It pushes his groin away enough that Harry can shove his hand down further, fingers making a terrible attempt at stroking Draco's cock. His arm feels awkward and in the way, but fuck if it isn't one of the hottest things Harry's done.
feeling awkward now. He’d not really thought about what it would be like having Draco around his house. Weird apparently, but there’s not much he can do about that now.
“Harry oh goodness Harry that feels so good!” Draco panted out wrapping his limbs around Harry. Harry tucked his arms around Draco and lifted him up, so Draco was sitting in his lap bouncing on his cock. Harry gripped Draco’s ass in a tight hold helping the blonde move.
“Warn me next time you do that!” Draco glared looking down at Harry between his legs. Harry gave Draco a little smile before he pushed one of his fingers into Draco’s tight hole.
“Yes, I am. I’m terribly sorry for being late Professor.” Draco responded moving forward and sticking out his hand.  Harry grabbed it and held it tightly before releasing it.
"Harry let’s move this to my room." Draco panted holding in a moan. Harry gave one last suck to the nice hickey he was leaving on Draco's neck before replying.
“I knew those two were gay for each other,” Pansy exclaimed interrupting Draco who glared at her, “Sorry continue.”
“Are you sure you want this starlight?” Harry asked cupping Draco’s face. His cock was lined up and ready to enter but he wanted to make sure that this was something Draco wanted himself, that he was prepared for the type of relationship they would have. In response Draco wrapped his legs around Harry’s waist and lifted his hips up so Harry’s head entered his hole.
Harry purred in response pressing closer to Draco, "whatever this is?" He questioned squeezing Draco's ass, pulling a small moan from the pale boy.
"I'm going to go say hello." Harry said getting up quickly and walking away before his friends could say anything. He walked up to Draco and tapped him on the shoulder.
“Yes, now please use that huge dick of yours and ram into my slutty hole.” Draco moaned pushing his hips back to try and get Harry’s dick inside of me.
"I know you're out there. Might as well reveal yourself." Harry yelled looking around. A figure slowly made its way out from behind a tree.
Draco rushes over to inspect it and seems to deflate seeing she's not there. I took a trip down to Luna's new shop in Olivander's old building the day after Draco dropped her off.
The man looks to his friends who go still before bursting into laughter, alcohol sloshing everywhere as they grab each other for support.
MMM'kay. What do you guys think of the ending there? Also sorry if there are any inaccuracies. I'm not Indian but I love an Indian Harry. I haven't eaten Indian food before either so Harry and Draco aren't alone. Also I realized this has been mostly written and was just waiting for me to finish it so I did and edited it really quickly to get it out today! This happened after I spilled tea all over my writing computer and desk and my life flashed before my eyes. I snatched my laptop up so fast lol.
A deep sickening sensation has enveloped my chest and I force myself to stop crying. Disgusted at my own self-pity, I stand and break the warding spell. With notorious Malfoy mannerisms intact, I prepare myself to Apparate and get the exchange over with already.
Carefully, I fill the order, cap it, and set it on the tray. My confidence gaining, I grab another cup and face a more complicated machine, painstakingly pressing buttons.
I trail my shaking right hand over the brand, teeth grinding not from pain, but lack of sensation. My fingertips registered the feel of flesh, yet I feel nothing in my arm where the tattoo lies.
A loud crash sounds behind me and I jump, head snapping in that direction to see Potter pick himself up off the floor and staring at me with wide green eyes.
I laugh out loud at her picking up his scent so quickly. I scoop her up and she wiggles like a happy puppy in my arms.
Luna got her rare magical creatures license and opened her shop only a few weeks after the war before the Ministry had even settled.
Luna cocks her head to the side, "Are you sure it's a Kneazle? You live among muggles so it may be a cat."
Potter must see me looking because he says sheepishly, "I haven't gotten to the kitchen yet, it's still in the planning stages of remodeling."
Tammy turns colors, pink to red to a violent purple, and she raises a finger at him, "WHAT DID YOU THINK YOU WERE DOING LEAVING HIM ALO-"
"I'll have a Double Shot Cappuccino, Iced Vanilla Latte-" He rattles off three other orders with ease and I struggle to catch them all. My smile is strained as I turn back to the wall of machinery.
"Oh course I washed my hands, Potter. What do you take me for, a cretin? I'm talking about a Muggle thing called germs I just recently found out about."
There's a beat of silence and I open the door all the way to see the only person that the wards don't pick up already pushing past me.
Hopefully it will move out soon, but seeing it sprawled happily over my things I know I’m in for a disappointment.
I look up from my chips and wince at Dean's expression. Seamus takes Dean's hand and nudges his shoulder.
I pause at the bathroom door, feeling uprooted. I always switch Tasha's nighttime lamp to her day before I do anything else. Or I guess I used to.
I throw on my clothes, a pair of muggle slacks and forest green button up. Halfway through the buttons I realize the similarity between the shirt and Potters eyes. With a sharp flick, I spell it off and decide on another shirt.
Luna nods absent-mindedly and looks around at the partway stripped wallpaper, where lighter rectangular patches reveal where paintings were hung for far too long. Big strips of it have been removed and other parts have brightly colored paint swatches over top.
Draco's on his second glass when the food arrives, steaming and straight off the grill. I'm halfway worried he'll get sloshed at this rate and I won't know what to do with a pissed Draco any better than I know how to handle a sober one.
employ male cleaners?" I snap, fed up. The man blinks rather stupidly, then simply shakes his head. He looks at me with dull brown eyes
It makes sense, the memories from the Yule Ball are still tangible. The pair of them were matching, everyone thought they looked so compatible. Whether it was because of their matching skin or how easily they danced together, I haven't a clue. Everyone was more than star struck that night.
I shake my head hard, a bit of tea sloshing over to burn my fingers. "Nothing like that Hermione, I swear. It's just that...you're more open minded?"
"Uh..." Potter nonsensically says, but I feel Tasha's weight leave my arms and she -no doubt- gleefully receives Potters attention.
The muggle flat has a strange kitchen. In the corner of the room is a large white box like I had seen in Potter's kitchen. Except this one rattles and hisses, the inside unable to maintain a cold temperature because of the bad seal. I have to spell it every day so it's contents don't go bad.
The bathroom is small and sloppy. Despite my strongest cleaning charms, which did do a toll on the mildew and mold, the mortar of the tiles still looks grimy and the water damage to the ceiling is unsightly. The shower had no curtain when I moved in, so I had to transfigure one from a spare bedsheet. The sink and toilet are right beside one another with no counter space for my many hygiene products.
"Is that one of her magical powers? Are you okay? Luna said- Fuck- I mean I have to go get the door. Wait here?"
I see Potter in the mornings usually, he stops by to check on the owls and help Luna with different tasks. I'm not sure whether I'm thankful or not that we rarely speak, but I know that it is for the best.
I take my wand and do that before standing up and facing the mirror to check my reflection. My hair is sticking up in the back and dark circles carve out hollows underneath my tired eyes. My complexion is very grey but for a patch of angry red spots on my chin.
Potter leans over the table a bit, "You don't weigh as much as a Beater's bat, French blood or not. I think you're drunk."
"No, but in some sections of the city there is. Lots of people take it because it's faster than a bus."
There's a tall man behind the counter in an apron, boredly refilling the pastry case. The sound of the door cheerfully chiming makes him glance up, or, well, down at me.
Hope you enjoyed and if you like my writing check out the drabble I just posted before this chapter :) It's not in the same story as this but on its own. Bookmark, Kudos, and comment plz!
I found the job after a curiosity search through a Muggle newspaper. I was perplexed by the unmoving images and then got wrapped up in a confusing article about a player in something called 'football' which I assumed was the Muggle version of Quidditch. It sounded quite boring, frankly, but the player in the picture was very handsome even if he was as still as a corpse.
Suddenly, he began jumping up and down and I had to plaster myself to him to keep from falling, "Stop!"
"So she's yours?" She cuts in, eyebrows raised. A thick scarf is wound around her throat; her nose and cheeks rosy from the cold. Her and Ron's apartment doesn't have a floo. The closest access is two blocks away and public.
Luna steps forward and wraps Draco in a hug, her sharp chin resting on his shoulder, heads reaching the same height.
The velvet drawstring -protected with a cushioning charm- takes up most of the counter. Potter undoes the tie and takes a look inside.
"That'd be great." I assure him and summon a bank note and pen, scribbling the amount and my signature.
"So, you've never ate Indian cuisine before?" I ask, picking my plate back up and finally getting a bite in my mouth. It's unlike anything I've had before, not thick and hearty like an English dish nor light and delicate like every French meal I had at the Manor. It tastes as if a gallon of seasonings were stirred in, stunning my remaining taste buds with too many flavors.
I turn and near trip over myself to get back indoors, hopeless when it comes to Harry Potter and his...
Inside, Luna is at the counter flipping through a Quibbler and eating from the pastry bag, lips and hands white with sugar dust. The people ambling along in the shop, looking at all the animals makes my skin burn with self-awareness but I shrug off the unsettled feeling.
Instantly, I can see cars, a fence, and a street lined with houses. They seem boringly calm, larger than my current residence though nowhere near the splendor the Manor used to be. Wind ruffles my ear length hair and a crup yips far off.
So what do you thinks going to happen? And what about that shiny Muggle car? I think it's adorable seeing Draco and Harry treat Tasha like a little baby. And Luna makes every fic better in my opinion.
Potter shrugs his broad shoulders, "You're a Malfoy. Obviously not like your father, but you're still full of pride."
"We've all noticed how preoccupied you are with him, Harry. Of course I'm okay with it and glad you told me, Harry. I'm still not entirely convinced of Malfoy but if you think he'll makes
Draco sits up straighter, if possible, "I finished my research and know about what a snake like her costs. Are...are you sure you want to rent her? You could just get another animal like you said."
"Oh I do like cats, I'm just not fond of this particular one. She's always sleeping and wants nothing to do with me."
"Just have her alright?" I end on a broken note and, Merlin's saggy tits, a strangled sob bursts free from my chest.
I groan in annoyance at myself, squeezing my shaft before lightly slapping it. My teeth catch my bottom lip as I try to contain my moan, eyes darting over to the pillow.
I rush back down the stairs and into the rearranged kitchen, the product of many hours of hard work and two gallons of bleach to sanitize it all.
I need something to calm my nerves: a butterbeer, fire whiskey, Muggle drinks, just anything will do.
He swallows, Adam’s apple bobbing up and down his richly tanned throat, then flashes a wide grin, "Just thought you'd want to know since you can't taste anything."
When Draco sees Tasha his scowl melts into a stunning smile and he rushes over to take the almost uncontrollable snake from me. She happily winds around his neck and face, hissing happy sounds right into his ear. He throws his head back and lets out a snorting laugh.
All I have to say is that the next chapter you guys are going to love and it's not even what you're thinking lol.
Scraping them off the skillet is harder than I thought. Once the over cooked eggs are plated, I throw the pan in the sink to wash up later and turn the water on for the baked-on egg to soak. Steam instantly hits my face and knuckles. I yelp and grab my hand, before thinking to shove it under the still running cold water.
"That's a decent idea. I'll set the price and we can decide installments later. But I have one thing I'd like to add."
I push back from the counter before she can reach me and cross my arms over my aching chest, spitting archly, "She's a snake, of course she doesn't whistle."
I take myself in hand, warm water sliding down my back, and close my eyes. Warm hands replace the water, stroking my spine and a muscled chest pressed tight against my back. Darkly tanned hands grip my pale hips and an open mouth kiss travels down my throat to my shoulder.
The Ministry had plenty of money to rebuild, bigger and better with more funding and departments, but the threat of corruption that came with that flood of money is very real.
Luna laughs, a sound as light as bubbles, "This shop has theft charms just like the others in Diagon. Though perhaps I should go back down in case anyone needs help. You can look at anything, none of the doors are locked, Cousin."
I step off the sidewalk and storm across the street, wanting to find a secluded place to Apparate as soon as possible. To reach my apartment and find something to hex.
Mutual pining? Nah. And what are you guys thinking of the job with Luna? Will it work out or will Draco's bad luck get in the way? And what about that sassy cat? Stay tuned to find out! Also- Kudos, Bookmark, and comment plz!
I shrug, "It's Luna who suggested it. She needed a new employee anyway. Free labor isn't enough anymore."
I crack open the battered door and poke my head out, expecting maybe one of my elusive neighbors, but instead see a pure black Kneazle waiting patiently. It slips through the crack in the door and I jump back, losing one of my slippers as I step harshly on my bad foot.
I suck down a deep breath and let the stretch of my lungs burn. "I can't care for her anymore. She's expensive. Her food. Her heating lamp bulb burnt out yesterday and I can't afford another. I can't find an apartment with her; no wizarding establishment will take me for obvious reasons and she's not a normal Muggle pet. I can't have her."
"A cat?" My nose wrinkles. I should have thought of it before. Both cats and dogs are non-magical versions of Kneazles and Crups, they can't do half as many things as magical animal can.
"Oh fine you big bully," She shoves me with her foot again and I make to grab it, "It's just that you called him
Snatching it up, I shove a hand down into it and feel for the velvet bag before grabbing it and offering the small item to Potter, glaring at his watery image through my bloody shameful tears, "Here's her tank and her heat lamp- you'll have to get another bulb- and her favorite rocks and molting potions, and-" I sob again.
I lather my hair with a special shampoo that prevents my white hair from getting a sickly yellow tinge and exfoliate my face, mind wander to Grimmauld Place.
it. The animal’s calls make a certain music, their personalities and colors spellbinding. I interact with them all day, socializing them so they aren't as timid with their eventual new owners. I walk around all day with Pigmy Puffs tucked into my pockets and riding on my shoulders, for Merlin’s sake.
Tasha hissed at my raised voice and I clamped my mouth shut, still holding out the small bag which Potter hesitantly took.
I nod and follow her inside, setting the pastry bag on the counter as she switches on all of the lights and coos at the still sleeping birds.
I have no right in viewing Potter that way. I've made countless bad choices, bullied him, and now he's misguidedly helping me. He doesn't deserve my twisted lust. The innocent crush of a witch is harmless in comparison.
For my fellow Americans! Tasha's length is 3 feet, or a yard, but I wanted to make it more authentic to the British setting. She's been with Draco since 5th yr so she's around 3 years old. Same age as my cat 0-0
, which was like an Apparate but for items. It's more common to shrink something then to send it blindly to a location, but with the attic being a massive junk drawer of dark artifacts and taxidermied house elf heads, I've nothing to worry about crushing.
I'm waiting at Luna's when she comes to open up in the morning, the bag of warm pastries in my hands wafting delicious smells over my cold face.
I leave the skillet in search of a plate and return to the eggs to see them seemingly done. The white part seems opaque enough.
I fall onto my duvet and take off my glasses, resting them on the nightstand. My old Quidditch jersey is still on my bed, so I set it aside to put in Tasha's terrarium tomorrow.
"I think Draco's first day at Luna's went well. I had to leave at nine but I got to show him the owls." I say, the image of Draco so close still fresh in my mind and refusing to leave. I wonder what it would be like if I had actually kissed him.
"Fine then. 100 galleons a week, 400 a month. Her species is even rarer than I thought and Father got her as payment for a favor so I was unaware of the exact price."
Potter eyes are as round as his glasses, hair messy and kissing his brow bone. Paint is smudged all over his arms, the light blue a beautiful contrast against his rich skin.
I hear him close the door and call out my name, my first name. I stop mid-step and look up at him, briefly shocked out of my mood, my face surely contorting, "Did you just call me
It's been in my possession since my house arrest, having arrived by Howler, obviously meant as a blatant slap in the face from an unhappy middle-aged witch. The large letter H in gold against the maroon backing is impossible to miss, the message as clear as a Pureblood's heirloom crystals.
Hi! This second chapter came a lot earlier than I expected. I intended for it to be twice as long but I'm leaving the next part as it's own chapter because I'm juggling a few ideas around about what job Draco gets? I always liked reading fics with him as a barista in a coffee shop or maybe a waiter. But today I stopped by a pet store to look at fish (there was a bird there that told me 'you're pretty' then acted all bashful about it loll) and I can definitely see Draco getting a job at a magical pet store.
in a bubbly font and cute creatures surrounding it. A variety of noises from a wild assortment of magical beasts fills the shop, some wrought iron cages full of pastel pygmy puffs and others completely empty. The shop is free of towering shelves and light bathes the interior.
"Draco?" Potter exclaims, stupid eyebrows raising over his stupid glasses and into his stupid hair. He raises a tanned hand to Tasha for her to smell and I want to smack it away out of pure pettiness. I don't. I glare at the ground and grit out again, "Take her."
I arrive home at ten p.m., worn out and my feet aching. I toe off my boots and toss my jacket back onto the arm of the couch. I check in on Tasha who sleeps curled up on top of a rock and switch to her darker, nighttime bulb.
Draco's clothes are soaked in what I'm guessing is coffee since the logo on his apron says, 'Java Bean'. He's standing moodily in the kitchen and I'm not sure whether to laugh or prepare a shield charm.
Hermione left around 3 to get ready for a date with Ron at some posh restaurant, leaving just Tasha and I to get the actual work done.
My hair is sticking straight up in the back and flicking out in bizarre curls over my ears, I have a strange dirt streak across my nose, and my clothes look as if I've battled a Hippogriff. Which, thankfully, I have not encountered yet at Luna's.
"Come on, go back home, please." I beg the Kneazle who sits staring at me not three meters away. It blinks languidly and flicks it's smooth tail.
I would fake offense and when they turn to me I would steal a kiss from their pink lips and haul them up into my arms, moving into the bedroom to dump them onto the bed.
What good is etiquette classes in times such as these. I haven't the faintest idea of what to say or if the silence is comfortable or not given how uncomfortable I am. I know my hair is awful and I'm paranoid that I am smudged with dirt like a Weasley, but know it doesn't matter either way because Harry Potter doesn't give two sickles how I look.
I return to the alley, my Lumos still glowing brightly. My consciousness re-centers with a feeling like a feather falling on a windless day.
"Hello, Matilda," Harry coos and takes the owls lifted foot with his forefinger and thumb, "I thought I scared you off, pretty girl."
A flash of annoyance crosses his features before he settles his jaw back into a determined square, "Consider it a down payment then."
"How about Rory? Or maybe Fanny. I don't even know what sex you are." I shake my head at myself, fully aware that this cat can't understand a word I'm saying. I move to roll it over onto it's back to check the gender, but it sinks it's claws into my skin and bites my reaching hand.
Draco finally calms Tasha down and sits in a comfortable chair instead of the other side of the couch. He doesn't look up from     Tasha's shining white scales holding him in a death grip.         "Thank you, Potter." He says softly.
"Night bus. I don't Apparate when I've been drinking and the Tube isn't too friendly at night." I can feel his heart underneath my palm, the beat strong and comforting. I wish I could rest my head there and listen to the rhythm.
"Oh," I look anywhere but him, cheeks reddening. He has the snake now, I should just leave. Good riddance.
Magical Menagerie closed down during the war and the owner decided to finally retire. His building was on the smaller side and could only house the everyday Wizarding pets: rats, toads, Kneazles, Crups, Pygmy Puffs, and owls.
Even with what I know of Indian cuisine, the menu is indecipherable. I order the day's special from a woman who looks like an Indian Mrs.Weasley, and the cheerful lady gleefully explains the menu. I am just as lost as Draco, who's nodding along, interested but dazed, and in the end agree to eat whatever she decides.
When I sit down at the wobbly table and finally take a bite of the unappetizing breakfast, I screw my face up and immediately go in search of the salt.
I groan and lift my head, taking a final swig, I get up and pay the barkeep for the drink, then exit onto Diagon and go about the task of distracting myself.
Potter shakes his head. "Never. Everyone from my father’s side is gone and Hogwarts meals are as English as they come. Have you eaten it?"
We finished up the meal with occasional awkward pleasantries. Draco was obviously uncomfortable and I was scared to open my mouth or else any number of things could have spilled out. All of it true but doubtlessly idiotic and uncalled for.
I receive mail proclaiming affections and disturbing marriage proposals daily. My stomach turns at the thought of
"Marvelous," I sigh reaching into the cold box to retrieve the carton of eggs. With my luck the owners will beat down my door at two o'clock in the morning.
"Sorry," He apologizes again and waves a large hand, a rush of magic filling the air for a minute before washing away. Even through the distracting movements of Tasha, I'm intensely aware of the solid throb I feel in my pants. Wandless,
"What can I get for you today?" He asks in a monotone voice. I don't let my smile slip as I approach the counter.
"You've never been on the Night Bus before?" I ask, wrapping my arms around him a bit tighter and planting my feet for stability.
I laugh and run a hand through my hair, working it free after my tangles catch, "Easier said then done."
"Can you go check on the owls, Harry?" Luna calls out over the waking squawks of the birds and I give her a thumbs up.
It's turned dark out- not an ideal time to ride the subway- and I make it a point to not Apparate with any alcohol in my system. The night bus is the most logical and fastest route home.
"Harry, ever since you fire-called Friday I've been worrying that it's something dreadful- why else would you tell me to get Ron out of the house for the day? We both know I can handle bad news better."
"Hello, what would you like today?" I ask, mimicking Charles. The man looks away from the menu and glances at my chest, "I'll have a, uh, Annabeth?"
I found two businesses that asked for you to come to their shops. One was a family owned corner shop and the other in a different section requesting a 'stripper'.
Not that the mad urge to rush into partnership didn't hit me. A month after the war, wounds were just beginning to heal and Ginny and I held onto each other like we would die otherwise. When we lost our virginities, I realized that I wasn't attracted to her like a lover, but as a close friend. She's a sister to me.
It's early but there are still customers inside, a witch and her young daughter watching the bright birds and others looking in cages.
One lizard, a purple and green stripped creature blinks lazily at me and walks up to peer through the glass, flicking out it's long tongue to scent the air.
I laid out my clothes the night before, so I can immediately start getting ready, trudging my way across the one room apartment to the bathroom for a hot shower.
"Come to the living room and I'll go get her," I offer and he agrees stiffly, combing his untidy hair with his fingers to smooth it.
I rest my head against the shower wall and pant, the horrific realization burning my consciousness that I just....no.
I stroke Tasha and scowl, "Fine. The tank and all I would guess to be at maybe 100 Gallons. I'm not sure exactly, but some of her potions are rather hard to come by and take a hand more practiced than mine."
His expression turns pained and he slips his wand from his forearm harness underneath his sleeve. Bowing his head goodbye, he Apparates away.
They would step out of the glass stall with a loosely wrapped towel and fight me for mirror room. Carefully spelling their hair dry, they would slip into one of my larger shirts for bed which would come down to their pale thighs. I would finish up my teeth and catch them around their waist. Tugging their back into my chest and pressing a kiss to their neck and they laugh and push me away.
"Didn't you wash your hands?" I ask, picking up a piece of deeply seasoned meat and taking my first bite. The flavor was brilliant, making me want to shove the whole thing in my mouth, but the spice already setting my throat on fire cautioned otherwise."
She nods, transferring Tasha to me, then focuses on a small cage of shivering snow puffs, "Just keep her warm until she's back."
I kick off my shoes and pick them up just to send them flying across the largely empty room. The expensive dress shoes bounce a few times like well thrown skipping rocks, though that does nothing to lift my spirits.
I hold her tight to me and throw the covers off my lap, jumping off the couch. I pan around the room for shoes, but not seeing a pair I Apparate straight to the front of Luna's shop.
Hermione grabs my hand and squeezes her cold fingers around mine, "Harry, just help me understand. Please."
Draco looks up at me and the distance between us feels to large. I can just see his pale eyelashes and the slight wear on his fancy purple robes. The delicate curve of his jaw would fit wonderfully in my hands, to tilt his aristocratic face to look up at me.
A faint sound makes me pause mid-piss, a pitchy noise not unlike water flowing through the old pipes but farther away. I finish up and button my trousers back, slipping my cold feet into my slippers I left by the shower earlier and creep out into the main room.
The side walk I land on is, Morgona blessed, deserted. The crup is still barking far off and the houses are all lit up but motionless.
I breath loudly against the pillow, my pants tightening with the swelling of my cock, and I roll my eyes at myself. I reach a hand down and rub my palm over the bulge, clenching the pillow in my other hand.
The bag was magical so it did make some sense. I give a consenting nod, my brain leaping ahead to apartments and down payments as I take the money.
It's two hours later before I see Tammy again. Thankfully Charles largely ignored me while I stood bored out of my mind, tapping away at some sort of Muggle device.
I shift, uncomfortable on the previously very comfortable couch. "The tears didn't start until a bit later..."
It made sense why they would hire a cleaner for a party, so the groom to be wouldn't have to clean up afterwards.
I bite my lip to discover it's already scabbed over, I immediately stop it and pocket my nervous hands instead. "Uh, a Muggle job actually. I found it in a newspaper."
His lips look dry, I notice, the thought barely registering but filling my brain at the same instant.
Worry eats away at my stomach like a potion gone wrong. The house seems to echo audibly without Tasha's mostly silent presence. I hurry up with my shower as Luna's coming any minute now and wrapping a fluffy towel around my waist I exit the guest bathroom just as a magical aura I easily identify as Luna flares up at the front door.
I sit up and stretch, unleashing a shrill yawn which is interrupted halfway through by a violent shiver. Clutching the white fur coat I slept in (because why not? It's the warmest thing I own and I have no one to show off for) I shift my legs from the mountain of blankets and find my heated slippers. They're as soft as clouds and feel as if the sun is defrosting my frost-bitten toes.
So yall met housewife Ron loll. And Harry and Draco had a little moment... Hope you guys enjoyed and plz Kudos, Comment, and Bookmark!
"Nice to know Hogwarts wasn't all bad for everyone. You, of course, had everyone's fair share of both. You could make friends with a rock Potter."
I ungracefully kick out of my jeans and leave them in a puddle beside the bed. Now in just my pants, I slip underneath the dark covers.
"Um, I have a job interview." I say, hyperaware of my words and the Statute of Secrecy. A violation is the last thing I need.
"Uh, I have a lot going on right now with renovations and everything," I mutter, face flushing. It wouldn't be a good idea. Being around Draco so much my feelings being as they are and surely unwelcome. I couldn't take advantage like that, it wouldn't be right.
It tilts it’s head to the side and another bird flies down, this one a Snowy owl. It flares its wings at me and bobs it's head in a challenge.
A part of me purrs at Potter, my enemy, seeing a difference between my father and I, but the rest bristles in annoyance at the insult.
, I start to worry I won't make it in time, even if I Apparate. There is no telling how close I will land if I Apparate as my location spell is old and inexact. I'll have to buy a map, find the location, and hope for the best.
"What's that supposed to mean?" I shoot back, clutching Tasha closer to me and she gives a minute hiss in annoyance.
I finish my hair and my clothes look reasonably neat, not like Harry will care, he'll surely be dressed in his usual sloppy manner. One of those Muggle T-shirts that show his strong upper arms, blue jeans, and comfortable trainers.
Hope you enjoyed! Draco's first job interview...was a surprise. Everything that could go wrong did lolol. Next chapter will have a whole lot more Draco/Harry dialogue and don't forget Tasha...
The Kneazle pads calmly to the center of the room and lays down on the floor, licking one of its shiny black paws and I hop around in pain, clutching the door knob.
I can't help but grin, "I'm trying out Parvati's grandmother’s recipes and made enough for you too, if you want?"
"We serve about 25 different drinks here but you only need to learn the top 5 and go from there. This is the expresso machine. You make it single-shot or double shot, adding different things depending on the customer. Pull this here, fill it to here, and add a splash of this- now for an iced coffee you use this machine. Fill this cup with ice first then press this, then these buttons. The whip cream is here and hold it like thi-"
His face has turned handsome, strong jaw and tanned skin, a shadow of facial hair. This couldn't be the same Potter.
The urge to run was growing inside of me, but I have no place to run to. I'm quite literally holding my house in my lap.
I unbutton my wrinkled shirt and tear it off, tossing it across the room and unstrap the leather wand holster encasing my left arm.
is threatening to boil over and the aloo gobi isn't done yet. I grab the mitts and haul the first dish out, setting it on the opposite burner from where the naan bread sits with a stasis charm.
I want him to own me completely, I don't care, I'll gladly gift myself to him. Even if we would have to hide our relationship and I would feel jealous from the sea of girls out there vying for him.
"Harry?" Her head of wild blonde curls pops up from behind a miniature rat enclosure, "Did someone steal your clothes?"
I could have gotten a better apartment. But why would I risk it without a job and the deal with Potter not a signed guarantee?
Like the interior of Grimmauld being restored, Draco is beautiful potential. He just needs proper care and encouragement to rebuild himself in a better light. If only I could nurture him and help him be his real self.
I step forward and take Harry's hand, the last thing I see before the world swirls is Luna's smug smile and knowing wink.
I stop, looking around as I try to orient myself. The towering shelves of dusty wand boxes are gone and instead a wide-open space and high ceiling allows the light to shine through. Countless numbers of animals make their own unique calls, mixing together into
She offers me a large, white pastry bag and the smell makes my stomach cheer embarrassingly loud. I've lived off of nothing but eggs and toast for so long I can’t really blame it.
A giggle falls from my mouth as I bolt the door shut and cast my eyes around the open room for Muffin. She's on my pillow, getting her dark hair all over it, and is looking at me with her green eyes. I rush over and kick off my shoes, running a hand over her sleek fur.
Draco is stroking Tasha's scales, unlooping her from his neck as she hisses unhappily. He takes her over to her tank and sets her down in the large terrarium gently.
"I'm going to try to be a stripper. I've never had a cleaning job before, but I’m hoping I qualify."
"I don’t regret the kiss Draco. I actually quite liked it...and was hoping if maybe I hadn't missed my chance...I could kiss you again." Harry wondered coming around Draco's desk and turning Draco's chair to face him.
“Draco calm down! You are Draco Freaking Malfoy, you were voted hottest employee for year, any guy or girl would look at you even if you weren’t dress like this. There is no shame in working at this club and if he is here, he is like us Draco, this club is for those that are into or curious about the BDSM world. Calm down.” Blaise said giving Draco a little shake, “Now let’s fix your eye make up and you get back out there and do your job and while you’re at it flirt those sexy leather booty pants off and show him why you were also voted most wanted employee.” Blaise gently said giving Draco a hug.
“Tell me what you want starlight.” Harry mumbled against Draco’s chest grinding his cock against Draco’s, feeling the vibrations from the egg vibrator against his own cock.
“Relax love, it’s just lube.” Harry said in a reassuring voice. Draco relaxed and enjoyed the experience of Harry’s fingers inside him. Once Harry believed Draco was ready, he reached over and grabbed the small egg vibrators he had pulled out. He pushed one into Draco and attached the other to the tip of Draco’s cock.
"Just go away....please." Malfoy whimpered feeling slick cover his thighs. Harry's scent started to fill his nose and he whimpered again. Had Potter always smelt this good? His mind was getting weaker and weaker and all he could think about was an alpha taking him. Filling him. Marking him. He grabbed at the back of his neck and shuddered.
The two sat in a semi awkward silence while they waited for the tea. Draco watched as Harry carefully prepared two cups. He silently handed Draco one of the cups and gestured to the sugar and honey he had set out. Draco quickly put some sugar in to his tea before taking a sip, he also grabbed some of the candies from a dish on the table. The whole situation felt very casual and oddly enough it helped Draco relax a bit.
“I’m sorry, I…I just hate messes and I couldn’t help myself…I hope you don’t mind?” Draco said putting the last of the books away.
"Quite all right Mr. Potter, please take a seat so the meeting can start." McGonagall sighed gesturing towards the empty seat right next to Draco. Harry hurried over and quickly sat down.
Hearing his first name come from Harry's mouth sent shivers down Draco's spin. Suddenly the door slammed open, making both men jump. A cackling laugh could be heard before fading down the hall.
“Are you alright Harry?” Hermione asked snapping her fingers in front of Harry’s face snapping him out of his thoughts again.
“We have a huge problem!” Draco said in a panic. He couldn’t believe he had run into Harry here of all places.
“That is quite enough Miss. Weasley. I do not allow unauthorized use of magic in my school. I have also been informed by several male students that you have been harassing them along with harassing Mr. Potter. Your atrocious behavior will not be tolerated, please follow me to my office where we shall discuss whether to expel you or not. Your parents will also been notified of your pending expulsion, now please follow me.” McGonagall huffed giving Ginny a look of disappointment. Ginny paled and silently followed McGonagall out of the Great Hall.
"Hermione is with him he'll be fine. Would you like to come over to my place where we can talk privately?" Harry whispered putting his hand on Draco's knee. Draco looked down at the hand and back up at Harry's face. Was Potter flirting with him? He hoped he was. It took a while, but Draco realized years ago that  he never actually hated Potter. He in fact loved him.
"You have no idea how long I've wanted this. Wanted to touch you. Kiss you." Draco whispered running his hands all over Harry. Peppering kisses all over his face.
“Don’t worry, you get used to it.” Harry said pulling Draco closer and wrapping an arm around Draco’s waist. Harry led Draco over to the Slytherin table. Harry started to grab some things and place it in a bag he conjured up.
“You look so beautiful right now. I can’t wait to see you in my playroom.” Harry sighed reaching over to the nightstand and grabbing a condom. The thought of being in Harry’s playroom made Draco moan with want. Images of different toys ran through his head, he wondered what type of master Harry was. Draco was pulled from him thoughts when he felt the tip of Harry’s cock probe at his asshole.
“You…oh goodness that feels good! You bent me over your desk and played with my hole tell I begged for you…fuck…for your cock and then you would...” Draco trailed off he couldn’t think, the things Harry’s fingers were doing to him was driving him crazy with want.
"I don't see why not." Malfoy said grabbing Harry's hand off his knee and holding it. As they made their way out, they heard more coughing and a 'Really Ron grow up' from Hermione before exiting the pub. After walking a few feet away Harry suddenly pulled Malfoy close and apparated them away, when Draco regained his senses, he saw they were in front of an old looking building.
“Harry why haven’t we had a session yet?” Draco asked suddenly putting down the books he had been carrying. He turned so his legs were on either side of Harry’s hips. Harry staired up at Draco’s face for a moment before answering.
“We can talk in my office.” Harry said placing a hand on Draco’s lower back and guiding him through the house. On the way to the office Draco was able to get a peek into some rooms. They passed a living room, a kitchen, and a dining room the rest of the way all the doors were closed. They stopped in front of two doors that reminded Draco of the entrance to his father’s office.
It had been a few weeks since their first night together and Draco was in pure bliss. He spent most of his nights with Harry either at Harry’s place or Draco’s. Harry also was at the club most nights Draco was there. Blaise would always make gagging noises when he caught them flirting. There was one problem that Draco had though, and that was they had yet to have a BDSM session. They had already talked about what they each liked and what they didn’t like. Harry would tease Draco by telling him what he would do to him, the ways he would tie him up, and all that but has yet to do any of it. Draco is starting to wonder if they will ever do a session.
“Everything and more.” Draco sighed letting his head fall back against Harry’s shoulders. He hummed when he felt Harry kissing his neck and shoulders.
"Yes, yes yes cum in me please yes!" Draco chanted over and over cumming untouched onto his and Harry's chest. Harry bite deep into Draco's neck again as he released his seed deep into Draco's abused hole.  They collapsed onto the bed Harry still buried deep in Draco. After a minute or so Harry let go of Draco's neck and licked at the spot his bite was. Draco shivered and clenched around Harry. They stayed like that for a while  both coming down from the high of sex.
"Harry, I want…no I need you inside me..." Draco groaned loudly letting go of Harry's dick with a loud pop.
He hadn't been a vampire for awfully long and the only other people that knew he was, was McGonagall and Hagrid. She was the one who informed him that he could substitute human blood with animal blood. So, he would go into the dark forest and find a rabbit or something. He would then give the carcasses to Hagrid who would cook them or feed them to one of the magical creatures he took care of. Harry usually went into the forest once or twice a week. He of course would eat what he could at meals, but it was quickly becoming difficult to do so. Everything started to taste of...well nothing. As Harry made his way to the dark forest, he was unaware of the sliver eyes that watched him. Hours had gone by and Harry had only managed to find three rabbits and two mice. They weren't very filling, and he was getting hungrier by the minute. He suddenly smelt blood. It wasn't extraordinarily strong, probably from a scrap or a shallow cut. Someone was in the forest with him, and they smelt delicious. Harry had tried human blood only once. The vampire that changed him accidentally (a story for another time) had a... donor would be the best word for it. A person, usually a witch or wizard but Harry was told it could be anyone willing to do it. Most commonly though it was the vampire’s spouse or lover. As an apology to Harry, he allowed Harry to drink from his donor. Usually, blood was taken from the neck and, he was told, that it tasted best when the vampire and the donor were engaging in sex. Harry chose the wrist and kept his clothes on. The blood still tasted amazing though. This blood though, made Harry’s fangs throb, he had never smelt something so good, so wonderful, he could feel his mouth salivating.
“Yes and no. When school first started, I eat, and I could taste things but now though…food taste like nothing and I just do it, so people don’t catch on. By the way how did you figure it out?” Harry asked wiping some food off Draco’s lip.
“Round two?” Draco asked spreading his butt cheeks open to show Harry his twitching hole. Harry watched as his cum slowly drippled out of Draco’s hole. He felt his cock harden and smirked.
"Malfoy are you okay?" He asked starting to pant. He was feeling warm and wondered if it was because of the smell.
“I..ngh…prepared myself in hopes that my….ngh…confession would be accepted.” Draco moaned out as Harry grabbed the plug and gently pulled. Draco was flipped over, his ass up and his face down in a pillow. Harry kneeled behind him playing with the anal plug that Draco had been so nice to provide.
"God your sexier than I-" Draco was cut off by Harry slamming his mouth onto his and brutally shoving his tongue into Draco's mouth. Draco moaned loudly and wrapped his arms around Harry's neck.
“That sounds great.” Draco whispered leaning up and kissing Harry. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck. The feeling of Harry’s lips against his made Draco almost purr with pleasure, he had fantasied about doing this for months now.
“Draco…would you like to be my blood donor?” Harry asked kissing Draco’s nape. Draco shivered with excitement.
“Yes! It feels so good Master!” Draco moaned his hips bucking up. He was getting close to cumming but knew that he couldn’t tell Harry let him. Harry slapped his ass suddenly, surprising Draco.
"I see...so...is your heat over then?" Harry questioned a blush spreading across his face as he remembered how amazing Draco smelt.
"…So-" Harry cut Draco off by slamming his lips into the blondes. He swapped his tongue across Draco's lips and groaned when he was allowed in. Their tongues danced and played with each other. Harry backed Draco up and then push him onto the bed climbing on top of him quickly.
“I’m glad you and Potter finally fucked. All that heated staring at each other was getting old.” Pansy joked earning a gently slap from Draco.
“Well why else would you be in this type of club.” Draco said leaning forward on the bar. He smiled when he saw Harry’s eyes flicker to the mirror behind Draco that was showing a perfect reflection of Draco’s ass.
"God you’re so tight Draco. It feels amazing." Harry panted as he bottomed out on the first thrust. Draco just moaned in response wiggly his hips slightly. Harry smirked and looked down at where he was connected to Draco. He groaned at the sight of Draco's tight hole stretched around him. He pulled out slowly before pushing back in, faster this time. Both moaned at the feeling. Harry kept thrusting, getting faster and faster, he watched as Draco fell apart more and more.
“Hmm maybe we should have stayed in my office then.” Harry teased pulling away from Draco. Draco almost whined with need. Harry flipped Draco over, so he was on his back, the sight of Draco laying naked on his bed, his face flushed with want made Harry’s dick twitch.
“Cum with me.” Harry said crushing his lips against Draco’s in a deep kiss. A few more thrusts and Harry was cumming deep inside of Draco, he could feel Draco’s cum spurting out between their bodies. Harry continued to kiss Draco tell he was sure he was done cumming. When he pulled back a string of silva connected their mouths. Draco’s eye’s immediately met Harry’s. Harry smiled, pleased that Draco was still following his order to look at him.
Minutes ticked by and the two boys stayed where they were. Harry's cock and teeth buried into Draco and Draco spread out beneath him taking it all.
“Yes, just wondering why I’m friends with these two.” Draco joked happy that Harry was back by his side.
Harry carried Draco out of the playroom and all the way to the master bathroom. He gently placed Draco down on the toilet and walked over the shower to turn the water on.
“It pleases me very much.” Harry said standing up from his chair, the paperwork he was working on forgotten. He walked around his desk and stood in front of Draco.
“Sometimes I will have you clean yourself, other times I will help you. Say that you understand.” Harry ordered still going around the room.
“I’m sorry for what happened today Draco. I know our relationship is a bit weird, and I know its way to soon to talk about love but…I do love you and I want to be with you…I guess what I’m trying to say is I don’t want you to just be my blood donor…I want you to be my boyfriend too…you don’t have to answer right now… I just thought I should make it clear so there wouldn’t be any more misunderstandings, cause I- “Harry was cut off as Draco kissed his lips.
"Malfoy..." Harry whispered against the door as the sweet scent got stronger, "Malfoy are you an omega?"
"God, you look so sexy right now." Harry mumbled trailing kisses down Draco's chest going lower and lower. Soon he reached Draco's swollen member. The head a bright red, veins could be seen through Draco's pale skin. He tentatively licked up a vein gently kissing the tip.
"Yeah, I'm here. Hold on and I'll undo the lock spell." Harry mumbled running his hands over his face to try and wake up more. He was never a morning person.
“Reality is so much better! It feels so good.” Draco moaned digging his nails into Harry’s shoulders. With each thrust up he was closer and closer to climaxing. He had never felt this good before, Harry’s dick was perfectly hitting all his good spots. Everywhere Harry touched brought new shocks of pleasure that ran through Draco’s whole body.
“Yeah, I’m okay…it’s just been a while…and…your so big.” Draco respond giving Harry a reassuring smile. Draco let out a small gasp when he felt Harry’s cock grow slightly bigger.
Harry leaned down and gently kissed Draco's soft lips twice before flicking his tongue across Draco's bottom lip making the pale blonde shudder. Draco reached up and grabbed the back of Harry's neck and slammed their lips together moaning when Harry's tongue explored his mouth. Harry loved the feeling of Draco's hands running through his hair, pulling slightly whenever Harry flicked at a nipple or nipped at a lip.
"Be mine Draco! Let me be the only one to feel this amazing hole.” Harry whispered bending over Draco to reach his ear. Draco turned and kissed Harry deeply, “Took you long enough.” He whispered back.
“Well then, now that, that is all done and finished. Kneel.” Harry ordered turning his office chair to face Draco.
"Yes, any Slytherin could have told you that. It likes to watch people, so it often peeks into the windows." Draco mumbled opening boxes and putting things on shelves. He remembered his first night at Hogwarts, he had been woken up by one of his room mates screaming about a giant eye.
"We're here..." Draco said snapping Harry out of his thoughts. He followed Draco into the room closing and spelling the door shut.
Draco sat on the end of his bed before answering, "there are potions out there that stop heats and others that can suppress scents, Snap would make them for me he taught me how to make them as well, but he usually did it. After he died though I started to make them. I was on my way to the ingredients closet when my heat hit me. I had thought I had more time before it came but...I was wrong." Draco sighed running his hands through his hair.
“You have no idea how much that pleases me love. Knowing that you had this in you the whole time you were on your way here, knowing that you were thinking about my hard cocking ramming into you as well makes me so happy. Tell me my starlight what did I do in your fantasies?” Harry hummed kissing one of Draco’s cheeks, while twisting the anal plug.
Harry nodded; he could feel his face turning red. Beside him Draco chuckled softly but covered it with a cough.
“Good.” Harry said suddenly pushing a finger into Draco’s hole, “Cause we’re far from done.” He smirked watching as Draco’s softened cock started to get hard again. By the time Harry was done prepping Draco’s hole, Draco was rock hard again. Harry took his boxers off his throbbing cock popping up. He climbed back on the bed and rubbed himself against Draco’s ass.
Harry was in bliss, but he didn't want to be the only one. He grabbed Draco's ass cheeks and spread them so he could see the tight pink hole that was twitching cutely.
“Green.” Draco responded, Harry smiled and turned the vibrators on to low. Draco moaned out as both his hole and his cock were being stimulated.
"How will we get there from here without running into anyone?" He asked as Draco gently maneuvered him off his lap.
“Bloody hell Draco.” Harry said his cock already hardening again. Draco smirked at him before closing -his mouth and swallowing. Harry suddenly grabbed Draco and pulled him up. He led Draco over to the bed and laid him down on it.
“You would then…turn me around and have me kneel in front of you and suck your co…. your cock tell you would cum deep in my throat!” Draco groaned pushing his ass up to give Harry more access.
"I want this. I want you. I've wanted you for a while." He moaned as he felt Harry sink in further.  He had waited so long for this. To feel this full.
“I’m sorry you felt that you had to give us a break Harry. We should have been paying more attention…we have kind of been stuck in our own world as of late. It doesn’t matter to me who you date Harry as long as you’re happy. If being with Draco makes you happy then I’m all for it.” Hermione beamed at Harry. They both turned and looked at Ron.
“You must be…Draco Malfoy?” Professor Harry asked looking at a sheet in front of him as he stood up from his desk and walked around it.
“Yeah, he yelled at her then yanked his arm away from her. He was pissed. I’ve never seen Potter that anger before. Are you okay?” Blaise asked looking at Draco’s red eyes and nose. Draco looked like he had been crying.
“RIGHT THERE FUCK IT FEELS SO GOOD HARRY! (A/N: haaaiiiRRRyyy baby)” Draco yelled out as Harry rammed into his good spot over and over.
“Draco!” Blaise yelled from the other side of the bar. Draco hadn’t realized that Blaise had taken over for the other bartender or that it had gotten busy. He had been caught up in his own little world with Harry.
“Oh, I don’t want to take up anymore of your time.” Draco said blushing, he quickly grabbed the pile of wrappers crushing them in his hand. He hadn’t even realized he had eaten all the candies.
“You look amazing, all spread open for me, waiting for my touch.” Harry said standing back and looking over Draco. He went over to the table he had spread all his toys on and thought about which one to use first. He picked up a feather teaser and walked back over to Draco. He looked at his starlight laying on the bed all spread open completely at Harry’s mercy.  He flicked the feather teaser over Draco’s perked nipple making him jump. Harry continued to tease Draco with the feather teaser tell he was moaning every time he was touched.
"Draco…bloody hell Draco I can't hold it anymore I'm going to cum!" Harry panted out thrusting harder and faster into Draco.
“That was amazing starlight.” Harry panted out brushing a strand of sweat soaked hair out of Draco’s face. Draco hummed his agreement running his hands through Harry’s damp hair and slicking it back.
“Kneel.” Harry ordered; the huskiness of his voice made Draco shiver with excitement, would there ever be a day that Harry’s voice didn’t cause Draco to break out in goosebumps. Draco gracefully fell to his knee’s in front of Harry, keeping his head lowered.
Two months had gone by and Draco was going insane. The small touches here and there, the heated looks, and the somewhat sexual conversations at the club had Draco running around in circles. He couldn’t stop thinking about Harry or what Harry could/would do to him. Draco jumped when he suddenly felt his phone go off. The other people in the library glared at him as his ringtone played.
"Harry please I can’t take anymore. Move!" Draco begged moving his hips around. Harry groaned shit...he had to keep it together otherwise he was going to come before doing anything.
'Must be the new DADA professor. Hope it's someone good this school is long overdue for one.’ Draco thought to himself as he greeted all the other professors.
“Cum! I want to cum, please let me cum! Please!” Draco begged, he had been close to cumming multiple times but knew that his master would be disappointed in him if he came without permission.
“Hmm…I would say someone tall, with light blonde hair that falls past their shoulders, memorizing silver eyes, looks amazing in fishnet stockings, know anyone like that?” Harry asked tucking a strand of Draco’s light blonde hair behind his ear. Draco shredded at the feathering touch of Harry’s fingertips against his cheek. He looked into Harry’s eyes and could see his sliver eye’s reflected back at him. He rubbed his thighs together, his fishnet stockings scratching against his skin.
“Hey guys...” Harry trailed off sitting down across from Ron and Hermione. He pulled Draco to sit next to him. Ron and Hermione stared at Draco for a moment before Hermione broke the silence.
"Ugh, okay well lately I've been noticing how attractive some men are, at first I didn't think anything of it. But then...I..I saw you at the club, I was there for Dean's birthday, and I thought you looked really good, and I just couldn't get you out of my head for some reason. The way you moved, the way your hair looked so soft. That night......I....I..."
“Lift your head.” Harry said opening the velvet box he had placed on his desk. Draco lifted his head and saw that Harry had a beautiful collar in his hands. It was an emerald green that reminded Draco of Harry’s eyes. It fastened like a belt in the front but had a sliver hoop on it like a dog collar, so Harry would be able to attach wrist cuffs or even a leash if he wanted to.
“No, I haven’t, I’ve been out by my favorite tree…I had a lot to think through.” Draco whispered walking again once Pansy caught her breath.
“Follow.” Harry commanded, Draco quickly stood up and turned towards the sound of Harry’s voice. He saw Harry standing at a bookshelf and went to him. He stood just behind Harry keeping his head bowed the whole time.
Draco banged his head on his desk. Was he looking too much into their kiss? Was it just a drunken moment never to be repeated? He hoped not...he enjoyed their kiss quite a bit. Maybe he just needed to get laid. He looked at the stack of essays he needed to grade and sighed. Might as well drown himself in work. Just as he was about to start there was a knock on his office door.
“Oh yes!” Draco said handing the papers over. They discussed Draco’s job as Professors Potters teaching assistant, what he would be doing, and what his responsibilities would be.
"It’s already midnight...I should probably head to my room" Harry sighed running a hand through Draco's surprisingly soft hair.
"Harry...fuck me." Draco panted spreading his checks to show his hole slightly spread open around the tip of Harry’s cock.
“I love you too.” Harry said also digging into his own plate of food. The two sat there eating for a minute before they both realized that they had just told each other they love each other for the first time. Harry looked up at Draco and saw that his face was a bright red.
"Malfoy stop that tickles!" Harry giggled gently pushing Malfoy away. Draco smirked and started to tickle Harry. Draco tickled Harry for a few minutes peppering kisses all over his face. Harry rolled them over, so he was on top he kissed Draco deeply and started to grind their hips together moaning at the feeling of their clothed dicks rubbing together.
"Bloody fucking hell! Right there right there Harry merlin your dick feels so good." Draco yelled out when his sweet spot was hit. Harry smirked and pounded away at that spot turning Draco into a mess.
“He really has changed. We have talked quite a lot and he told me about his father. As you can probably guess he wasn’t the best role model and an even worse father. Always pressuring Draco to act a certain way, dress a certain way, and then Voldemort came into the picture and threatened Draco’s family if Draco didn’t do what he wanted. If Draco’s mom hadn’t lied to Voldemort when he asked if I was died or Draco throwing me a wand (A/N: So I don’t know if this actually happened in the book or was just a deleted scene from the movies. Either way it fits in with my story of Draco being forced to be a death eater and choosing the good side at the last minute) the war would have ended differently. I really hope you guys can give him a chance.” Harry said running his hands through his always messy hair. He really wanted his friends to at least try and get along with Draco. If they didn’t approve of him dating Draco, he wasn’t sure what he would do.
“I know, but I want to show you how I’ll take care of you after I pleasure you so much you pass out.” Harry kissing the side of Draco’s head. Draco snuggled into Harry’s neck and smiled to himself.
No one could know. He had to keep this a secret. Draco looked down at the parchment again. He was an omega, like his father and like his father he would hide it. Take suppressants, scent blockers. Whatever it took.
He didn't sound fine Harry thought taking a deep breath the sweet scent filling his lungs and clouding his mind.
“Like I was saying Thomas dumped Ginny and ever since then she has been throwing herself at Harry to try and get him back, but he wasn’t the only one. From what I heard from what Headmistress McGonagall said, she has been harassing several other guys.” Draco stated filling his plate with food. Harry had fed on him just before coming down to breakfast, so Draco was starving.
"Quite alright Mr. Malfoy. Please take a seat we are waiting on one more person before we begin." Headmistress McGonagall said gesturing to an empty seat. Draco quickly sat down and wondered who they were waiting on.
"If you're willing to accept me as your donor." Draco replied glancing away before looking back at Harry.
“You bloody arsehole.” Draco whispered knowing Harry could hear him. He watched as Harry pushed Ginny off him and turned to look at Draco who knew his eyes were filled with tears. He quickly flipped Harry off and run out of the Great Hall. He didn’t stop running tell he was outside but the Blake Lake. He went to his favorite tree and sat down in front of it. Tears still stung at his eyes some rolling down his face. He rubbed them away quickly. His father’s cold voice rang in his head, ‘Malfoys don’t cry Draco’. This time though Draco couldn’t stop the tears. His eyes filled and tears ran down his face. He thought there had been something between him and Harry. That maybe he had a chance. It seems that he was wrong. The rumor of Ginny and Harry breaking up was wrong and now Draco’s heart was suffering for believing it was true. Why did he think he ever had a chance? Why would things work out for him…he had been on the wrong side of the war. He had helped the Death Eaters break into Hogwarts and destroy it. He…he had watched Dumbledore be murdered and did nothing. He had the dark mark on his forearm that would forever be a mark of shame. Why would the savior of the wizarding world ever want to be with an ex-Death Eater? Draco was sobbing at this point, gut wrenching sobs. All the pain and hurt he had pushed deep down inside of him came storming back up and there was nothing Draco could do to stop it. He was happy that no one came near the Great Lake too afraid of the giant squid attacking them.  He would never hear the end of it if someone caught him ugly crying. Draco let his head fall back against the tree, his sobs finely stopping but tears still ran down his face. He looked up through the branches to the sky and wished that he could just climb on his broom and fly away.
“You can call me Harry then. Would you like some tea?” Harry asked walking over to what seemed to be a makeshift kitchen of sorts.
Once everyone had cleared out McGonagall looked over the two boys, she had watched grow up into the young men they are today.
"Oh god Harry yes. I'm yours, I'm all yours." Draco screamed cumming all over his and Harry's chest. Harry lost himself, biting into Draco's neck, emptying himself into Draco's tight hole. Draco laid there stunned mouth wide open but nothing but gasps coming out. He felt so full. He could feel Harry's knot stretching him, feel his teeth sink further into his neck.
"Is that amazing smell coming from you Malfoy?" Harry questioned trying to push the stall door open only to find it locked.
“My cock has been aching to be inside you.” He whispered into Draco’s ear licking the shell. Draco groaned; his hips lifted to meet with Harry’s as Harry rubbed his cock against Draco. Harry reached around Draco’s head and untied the blind fold letting it slowly slid off Draco’s face. As soon as Draco’s sliver eyes met with Harry’s emerald ones, Harry thrusted into Draco. He watched as Draco’s eyes snapped shut and his chin tilted up.
The move silently, falling into sync with ease. Harry finds his glasses and his wand, then his trousers, foregoing his pants to pull them on as quietly as he can, leaving the button undone. Draco finds his pants from wherever they were, sliding them on with ease. By silent agreement Harry moves first, wand drawn and ready. Draco might not have his wand, but he’s still an asset, there’s still no one else Harry would have at his back.
Draco groans again as she lets out a particularly piercing wail. She’s really getting into it now, and it’s been an age since Lily used to cry like that. But Harry remembers how it goes. Her eyes will be all scrunched up, and she’ll have tears soon if they don’t put a stop to it.
all mixed up together, and Harry inhales, breathing it in like his first breath of air after swimming in the Great Lake. He can already feel that he’s alone in the bed, but Harry reaches out anyway, fingers finding Draco’s pillow and pulling it to him. It’s not Draco, but he wraps his arms around it anyway, cuddling it to his chest and burying his head into it. It’s a poor substitution for Draco, really, but for Harry it’s so much more than he’d usually have, and he hangs onto it like the lifeline it feels like.
Harry groans out loud from it, dropping his head to Draco’s shoulder as his cock throbs. It would be so easy to pull down his trousers and pants, to rut against Draco’s arse until he comes all over him, making a mess of the both of them. He bites down on Draco’s shoulder, a warning and a distraction when Draco presses his hips up again.
"It's been nice seeing you," Harry says, truthfully. "Maybe we could do this again?" Harry's hands go to his thighs, feels the material of his jeans and grips at it, feeling the muscle and material pull beneath his fingers. "It'd be nice to catch up again."
His own cock gives an agreeing twitch, and Harry rapidly changes mental track, shoving aside all thoughts of what he
Draco knocks his shoulder against Harry’s, a small smile on his face, not the usual smirk he sends Harry’s way, or the grin he uses at work, or the baring of his teeth that makes you feel seen and caught all at the same time. It’s something else, a different smile all together, just between the two of them. Harry soaks it in, loses himself in the smile and Draco’s eyes for a moment.
It’s easy to fall into familiar routines, as exams approach again. There’s a panic to the atmosphere, as the fifth, seventh and eighth year students try and cram in as much studying as possible, and Draco is no exception. He’s determined to use every minute available to study. He needs to be his best, needs to show them all that he’s more than just a Death Eater. It’ll take more than a few outstandings for him to get a job after graduation, but it’s a good start.
"It is," Draco says, taking the menu, and their conversation halts as someone comes past with a bottle of wine sliding it to Draco with a "Thought I'd get you started with your usual". There's an obvious camaraderie there, as Draco exchanges words with the person, and Harry distracts himself by looking at the table, not wanting to feel like he's eavesdropping on the conversation. There's a glass with a little candle in the middle, still unlit, and it's that which Harry turns his attention to until there's a glass placed in front of him, and Harry looks up to see Draco pouring the wine into it. "The Muggle and wizarding areas are located close enough that it's a simple thing to manage," Draco continues as if there had been no interruption, "and there's enough traffic on either side to make it worthwhile. The wizarding neighbourhood was dying off just a few years ago, and now it's coming back to life."
"You know, it's considered creepy to watch people sleep,” Draco says, coming up behind Harry and wrapping his arms around him, tucking his chin over Harry’s shoulder.
"I’m sorry." Sorry for the loss of his brother, sorry for the war, and the fact that he lost Sirius well before that, sorry for everything that cost them all so much.
"I never wanted to be an Auror," Draco says, and it takes Harry a moment to remember the question he'd asked. "I did it because people didn't think I could, or thought I should disappear after the war. It felt like a way to make amends, and to show them all up at the same time. Then I stayed because Mother was so happy to see me making something of myself and rehabilitating the Malfoy name—her thoughts, not mine," Draco adds.
Harry sighs, deep, leaning his head back and looking to the ceiling, as he inhales deep enough for it to be audible. “Please, Draco, I just want to talk.”
“I’m not,” Harry admits, easily, a smile on his face. It’s not a real smile though, Draco can tell, has a whole folder of Harry smiles catalogued away in his head. This one is the wary smile, like he might use on a first year afraid of a ghost, or particularly flighty thestral. Draco’s never seen it directed at him before.
Albus tries to put a leaf on James’ castle, and James pushes it away roughly. For a moment Harry thinks it might lead to tears, sees it flash across Albus’ face for a moment. Harry almost wishes for it, even if that makes him a horrible parent. Anything to get out of this conversation that he already regrets starting.
It’s a pure-blood thing maybe, the ability to put that level of disdain into his words. It cuts right through Harry.
"I thought as much," Draco says. He’s wearing his most self-satisfied smirk, and Harry should find it annoying but doesn’t. He kind of wants to wipe it off his face all the same, but not with his fists. Draco stands up, closes the small distance between them, and takes Harry’s glass in his hand.
all at once, complete with Draco's own brand of cockiness. Harry doesn't hesitate, sliding behind Draco as his cock brushes up against Draco's arse.
But Luna… somehow her recommendations always see him right, even if they seem a little odd sometimes.
"It's about time really," Draco laughs again and walks over to hand a glass of water to Harry, sipping on his own.
"You’ve got a little..." Draco brings his thumb up to Harry’s lip, swipes at the corner of his lips.
on the course of action. He can get a little lost sometimes when there isn’t a clear plan in place, and those are the times he gets stuck in inaction, too many options and too hard to make a decision, too hard to even get started on what he needs to do. Hermione and Ron had always been his guides in that, and he misses them now, wishes they were around to help him make decisions, like
making the noises just as his hands finally find his trousers, the soft black material familiar under his fingers, and he doesn’t even stand up as he pulls them, despite the fact he hasn’t found his pants yet.
as he takes a drink, belatedly recalling he was meant to swirl it in his mouth after he’s already swallowed the wine.
Harry drinks and almost forgets, ready to take whatever Draco’s giving him. He’s not sure what’s happening here, but he can’t imagine fighting it, can’t imagine doing anything but what Draco wants him to do, and that’s probably a thought he should examine in the future, but he can’t fathom it at the moment. It’s Draco that stops him. He only lets Harry have half a mouthful and then reminds him, "swirl it," and Harry does, the movements awkward. He feels flushed and hot, something that has nothing to do with the wine, and everything to do with Draco, and the tone of his voice when he says, "swallow."
“I never knew about soulmates,” Harry continues, “I didn’t — I didn’t realise it was a thing, that this was a possibility. Someone failed to mention that along the way. Like you think that would have been something to mention, like
to do to Draco. He gives his cock a squeeze that is as much to relieve a bit of the pressure and try to tell it
Draco slips his hand out from between them, and collapses on Harry, trapping the mess between them, as his breathing starts to slow. When he can think again, he whispers a spell to clean them up. It only half works, Draco can still feel some residual stickiness, but Draco can’t bring himself to care anymore.  At least he tried.
"Yes," Harry admits, because he’s been caught red-handed and there’s no point in lying. "Can you blame me?"
Carefully, wand raised and ready, Draco at his back, Harry leans to peer around the doorframe, then leaps into the kitchen.
There's a chill in the air when they walk out of the bar. It's still busy, and their table is immediately taken by another couple. When Harry looks back he sees them leaning in towards one another, their hands brushing together as they look over a shared menu, and Harry feels a pang of—want or something like it, for the ease of their shared intimacy. Draco's pulling a coat out when Harry pulls his eyes away, from somewhere Harry can't see, and there's a part of him that wants to admonish him for what is clearly a risk in front of
with it," Harry says, even if he kind of thinks there might be. It’s all the little things though, things that Harry isn’t sure if he should be worrying about... It just feels
It’s the smell that he recognises first. He rolls over when he wakes, turning on his pillow. There’s still that smell that’s so
"The mess displeased Master," Kreacher says, sounding disapproving and tired. "Master asked Kreacher to clean the mess up."
When Draco was five Pansy came round for a playdate. The before bed story from his mother had been about soulmates, and five year old Draco had been obsessed by the idea of finding his soulmate, that somehow he would and his life would just fall into place and be perfect. The stories they used to read said that your witch’s mark will one day turn into your soulmark, and Draco asked Pansy to search for his, pinching and prodding every mark they found on his body, as Draco bit back tears from her bony fingers and shook his head when she asked if they hurt.
Harry continues his way to the kitchen. He sets the charm on the kettle to boil, and sets out a cup, a tea bag, sugar, and milk as he waits for the water to heat up. The act calms him a little. He can still hear the noise coming in from outside, the voices and laughter. It’s all going swimmingly, everyone’s having a great time, but it’s just…
He wants to make this good — he can’t remember the last time he was actually allowed to do this, has no idea when or if he’ll be allowed to in the future. He uses one hand to hold Draco’s hip, holding him still, and stopping Draco from moving. It’s not that Harry minds, he’s got a fairly cooperative gag reflex; but what he likes
"The glass," he points out, stepping closer to Draco. It’s automatic, an instinct to protect him with his body, even if that’s not practical here.
If there ever is another time, Draco thinks he might like putting on a bit of a show, if only to have Harry’s eyes on him, to see the hunger clear as day across his face as Draco slowly reveals himself.
Every soulmark is different, means different things.  There are people who find their mark in a relationship and living out their days happily, but there are  other stories about people being missmarked, horror stories often. There are even some people who find a soulmark and never know who was responsible. Not all words are unique, not all words make sense.
From his position in the doorway Harry can't see anyone, only the organised clutter of the shop. Every space as far as Harry can see is occupied with rows of cabinets filled with various items. There's everything from jewellery and plates to furniture, and an old grandfather clock stands along the far wall. There are lights hanging from the roof, and even what looks like wrought iron fencing leaning against a balustrade.
Harry hums noncommittally, leaning against the wall beside Draco. Draco feels more crowded than he had been when he was in the middle of it all getting the drink in his hands, a rising heat beneath his clothes. He rearranges his feet, leaning away from Harry, just to put some more space between them, and pretends not to notice when Harry’s eyebrows furrow, instead casting his gaze over the room and it’s occupants.
"What if you did stay?" Draco suggests. Harry turns to look at Draco and out of the corner of his eye he sees Regulus do the same. "Why would you have to leave? It’s your house, and you’ve been taking care of it so well."
Harry tries to put all of his feelings into that kiss. It’s too early for the emotions he’s feeling, and he knows,
He’s doesn’t remember when the line blurred. Doesn’t know when his hatred for Harry developed into a reluctant acknowledgement that he found Harry attractive, or when that turned into a full-fledged crush.
“Yes,” Harry gasps out, fingers digging into Draco’s hips delightfully, and Draco replies with a roll of his hips. His cock is trapped almost painfully in his pants, and Harry can’t be doing much better, even as Draco can feel the swell of it pressing into his arse.
The lamp on the table lights up as Harry approaches, the coloured glass lighting up the table and splashing colour across the ceiling.
His own cock is throbbing, long ago moved from interested to insistent, and he’s so hard it almost hurts. He pushes his own pants down, climbing over Draco to lay beside him. He wraps his hand around his cock, his other hand coming up to tangle into Draco’s hair, tugging and using it to pull Draco’s head to face him and capture his lips in a kiss. Draco’s lax in the aftermath of his orgasm, and it’s less a kiss than an open-mouthed brush of lips, breaths hot and heavy between them.
He waits long enough that Harry’s sure it’s been a waste of time. And that would be a laugh, wouldn’t it, Harry coming here in his pyjamas just to have a talk, only to find everyone in their beds and the door locked.
“Couldn’t think of anything better,” Harry says, and he means it. Draco laughs and presses another kiss to Harry’s lips, and really, there’s no other time or place he’d rather be in.
Draco's a little bit taller, something Harry's known from working with him, but like this it's more obvious, the way Harry has to tip his head up to look at Draco's lips. It's not something he's had to do before, not in his limited experience, and there's something about it that makes Harry's blood run hot. He's not done this before, and he stalls, hands still at his sides, and he wants to put them on Draco, but isn't sure how, isn't sure of anything.
“Hey,” Harry says, his voice tinged with concern. Draco’s become familiar with that tone over the year, even become familiar with it directed at him. It brings him crashing back down, to this moment, here, all other thoughts fleeing from his mind. “Are you with me?”
“Yes,” Draco breathes out, and if his voice sounds a little weak Draco hopes Harry puts it down to the arousal thrumming in his veins. “Yes. Are you? Do you want this?” Draco needs to know, needs to be sure.
that don’t look away, that are still locked on Harry even as his lips are wrapped around Harry’s cock, as his hands stroke over him. He’s got one hand low on Harry’s stomach, fingers petting the coarse hair while the other grips Harry’s thigh, fingers digging into the muscle, and sending tendrils of pleasure shooting through him.
"Oh Harry," Draco says, his voice still filled with laughter. He has to stop to gasp for air, and he wraps his arm around his stomach as he sits back up. He’s obviously still almost laughing—trying to hold it in with minimal success. The result is little snorts that are definitely not posh, and quite frankly more than a little unflattering, but Harry can’t help but look on them fondly, even if it’s all at his expense. It’s still nice having this, the easiness between them, the fact that they can laugh at each other now.
“Can I sit here?” Harry asks, takes the seat before Draco can respond. It’s so Harry, expecting people to welcome his presence. It’s not something Draco even thinks he’s aware of, something that’s been happening as long as Draco’s been watching, the way people always want Harry to gravitate into their space. Harry doesn’t notice, just does it, with the ease of someone who used to it, but doesn’t go looking for it, always happy to have somewhere to sit with someone who wants to be around him.
"I didn't choose it," he says, almost apologetically, like it's important, and Harry supposes it is, to Draco. "Her name is her own: Black."
“Some of us like our sleep,” Draco snarks, though that’s not true, not usually anyway. He’s usually a light sleeper, tossing and turning through the night and awake at the drop of a pin. But he can’t recall waking once, and feels rested now. He can see the sunlight filtering through the stained glass window, adding to his already sated feeling with the warmth it brings him. He feels like a cat, could stretch out across the sheets if it weren’t for the more pressing issue of
Harry releases the hold on his softening cock. His hand is sticky, covered in his own release, and a little sweaty if he’s honest. Draco’s got a hand on his own cock, and Harry doesn’t know when that happened but he wraps his own hand around Draco’s, delighting in Draco's ensuing moan. Harry starts moving them both, squeezing tighter and forcing Draco to stroke a little faster, a little firmer.
"I need you to know that you don't have to do anything here. I want nothing more than to ravage you, but I only want that if you're sure it's what you want, too. We can just kiss, or I can make us tea and we can chat some more, or you can go to bed. The sofa transforms into a very acceptable bed, even if Pansy refuses to use it."
He’s still on his side, arms wrapped around a pillow like he’d been wrapped around Draco in his dream. Harry can almost smell him still, the lingering scent of something that could be Draco, but is probably just his own sweat.
even if apparently that person wasn’t him. It shouldn’t annoy him, but it does, makes him feel like everyone gossiping about him in fifth year after everything that happened.
He swings back and forth between believing it and not, like a particularly vicious pendulum. He’s not sure what hurts more: that it might all be a dream, or the thought that there’s a version of Draco out there that still loves him. That still wants him, when his own version is so distant.
She starts to fall asleep before she’s even finished the bottle, and Harry places it on the kitchen bench as he rocks her gently, murmuring sweet nothings to her. When he’s sure she’s completely out, he places her back in her crib, pulling the sheet up over her.
He feels too hot, overheating. It’s not helped by the way his shirt is pushed up against his chest, feels almost trapped by it. He should take it off, they should take it off, Merlin why are either of them still wearing clothes when they could be naked?
Harry drops his hand from where he'd been holding Draco's, reaching for Draco instead, following what he
Until Draco pulls away from him. Harry's already chasing him without even thinking about it, but Draco uses the distance, small though it is, to get his hands on Harry's hips and
, the thought of disappointing everyone. It didn’t make sense that it was worse around the people he’d loved, more than it had ever been around the family who’d hardly cared for him, but it was almost debilitating. That had taken years to work through, with a lot of help from Ron and Hermione.
Harry follows from a distance, close enough to watch Draco, to be around in case Draco needs anything, but leaving enough room between them so as not to get in his way. Draco gets snippity about his space when he’s investigating a scene, something Harry’s learnt the hard way. Harry will always run in if there’s something he can do, someway he can
It’s the tone of his voice which almost makes him break, that makes him want to give in, to talk to Harry until he understands. He wants to tell Harry all the reasons why he can’t have this, why he’s not allowed. Maybe Harry would understand. There are so many reasons why this is a terrible idea, too many for Draco to even consider, especially when he’s been doing his best
, and he doesn’t look away, their gazes locked, caught like one of the Cornish Pixies back in second year, until one of them finally cracks and looks away.
Draco does try to press up then, the thrust caught by Harry’s hold on him. His other hand slips from Draco’s cock, coming to hold at his hips, holding him still. Harry controls the speed of his descent, slow enough his mouth is watering around Draco by the time he finally gets Draco fully in his mouth, nose nuzzling at his hair and cockhead bumping against the back of his throat. Draco’s hands fly to his head, fingers twisting into Harry’s hair, just the side of painful. But Harry’s never minded that. Harry knows it’s an instruction to move, but he’s not planning on letting Draco have any say in this. It’s his dream, and he’ll take it how he likes.
Draco’s slips his hand between them, knuckles brushing over Harry’s cock as pushes down their pants to get their cocks out. Draco’s hand wraps around them both, the moan echoing between their lips. Harry shoves his hands into Draco pants, pushing them down haphazardly, getting his hands on Draco’s arse properly. Draco moans as he starts to move his hand, a little dry, but it still feels amazing as he tugs at both their cocks He grips firmer, pulls tighter, and it’s not helping Draco, but he wouldn’t trade it for anything, especially not when Harry grips tighter still, thumb digging into his hip and fingers on his arse, almost like Harry
, but either way Harry takes it as permission to continue. "You don't have to answer if you don't want, but you said you left the Aurors for you—can you… I guess I am wondering why you did?"
. He presses down on the skin almost accidentally, and Draco releases a hiss of pain, startling Harry into looking up at him, hand still clasped between them.
Harry’s not sure what happened before, but it's as if the moment in the kitchen broke something between them. Harry would think he was the only one affected if not for the way Draco is looking at
He throws his wand behind him—bad form that, Robards would pitch a fit—and Draco’s hands are back on him, one finding his shoulder, the other coming to his hip. He tugs Harry in until their bodies connect, and it’s like a Warming Charm where they touch and Harry bites back a moan, bringing his own hands to Draco’s hips.
"Right," Harry says, looking at the lily again for lack of anywhere else to look. It feels awkward now, or maybe just
Regulus turns to Draco, taking him in, and Harry resists the urge to step in front of Draco, to shield him from the ghost. Not that it would do any good.
Draco stands up, looking for his shirt, the only sound his own breathing the blood rushing in his ears as he looks around and
Draco strips his clothes, and Harry follows suit, his eyes raking over Draco as he does. It's not the first time he's seen Draco's body, but it's the first time like this, first time naked and unflinching. The first time he's allowed to look, properly, and Harry does.
A hand at his shoulder cuts off his thoughts—and it was panic he realises now, hands still stuck in the fucking sink and
Harry doesn't ask, even if he wants to know. He tries to remember to park the question for later, adding to the ever growing list he already has from today.
They looked at each other, leaned forward and kissed. Harry was about to pull away, but Draco reached up and tangled his fingers into Harry’s hair deepening the kiss. Draco pulled away for a second to move the food out of the way before climbing on to Harry’s lap and continuing their make out session. After a few minutes Draco pulled away and leaned his forehead against Harry’s looking deep into Harry’s eyes.
"Harry...you don't have to." Draco panted grabbing at the sheets below him as he looked down his body at Harry.
“It means whatever you want it to mean…sir.” Draco said lowering his head. Harry smirked, usually his assistant was yelling at him about the mess in his office, or for not doing something and rushing it at the last minute. This submissive Draco was quite different.
"Kretcher welcomes Master Potter back home and is pleased to welcome Master Malfoy, Kretcher is always happy to serve a member of the Black family." The house elf growled out bowing to the two men.
“You remember.” Harry chuckled, tucking a piece of hair behind Draco’s ear. Draco shivered at the touch, tilting his head slightly to try and feel more of Harry’s hand. He felt Harry’s fingertips trail down his neck before disappearing.
"Sorry I'm late!" Potter said in a rushed voice, his hair looked messier then usual and Draco's fingers twitched with a need to fix it.
"Don’t talk with your mouth full." Harry rasped out bucking his hips up to fill more of Draco's mouth. He muttered a cleaning spell and smirked at the surprised squeak Draco let out. He leaned forward and licked at the tight ring of muscle making Draco moan which in turn made him moan from the vibrations. Harry licked at the Draco's hole tell it softened. He then pushed his tongue in and out loving the moans and whimpers that left Draco. At the same time Draco was working his way down Harry’s massive cock. Soon he was able to take all of Harry into his mouth and throat and had set up a good rhythm. Both men were moaning and groaning as they pleasured each other.
"Me to!" Draco groaned pulling Harry’s head up and kissing him. Harry groaned into Draco’s mouth as his felt Draco’s hole squeeze him, a second later he could feel the warm spurts of cum, as Draco came between them. He thrusted hard into Draco earning a moan as he came deep into Draco.
“Its fine why wouldn’t I have lunch with my boyfriend, and after lunch I’ll take you up to my room and have my real lunch.” Harry purred flashing his fangs at Draco, making the pale boy shudder. Harry grabbed Draco’s hand gave Draco a smile and pushed open the doors. A hush fell over the Hall as people noticed them. Draco could hear whispers and could feel people watching them.
"What?" Draco stupidly said not paying attention to anything but Harry's body. In response Harry grabbed Draco by the shirt and pulled popping buttons off and even ripping the fabric a bit. Before Draco could protest, he was being thrown onto the bed and his pants and underwear were being torn from his body and Harry's face was inches from his privates.
“I see someone is finely awake.” Harry teased walking into the room. He had a tray full of food. Draco sat up and smiled at Harry sleepily.
"You could stay...it’s a long way to the Gryffindor tower from here." Draco mumbled against Harry's neck gently kissing it.
“I’m going to assume that that was Professor Potter you were talking with?” Blaise said leaning next to Draco. Things had finely calmed down and all the orders were filled. The club would be closing soon and only a few patrons were left.
“As you saw Ginny Weasley didn’t take the news too well and even tried to hex me. From what Harry has told me she cheated on him and then dumped him, started dating Thomas when school started but was dumped by Thomas so he could be with Finnigan-”
Draco sat there in shock. Harry Potter was offering to have sex with him, Draco Malfoy the boy who teased and bullied him for years.
"It’s too bad we didn't do this sooner; I actually find your company quite nice." Draco slurred leaning his head against Harry's shoulder. How they got onto the floor next to each other escaped both.
'What the bloody hell happened?' Draco thought to himself trying to shift but discovering his body ached too much to even move. He had never been fucked so hard he passed out.
"Would you believe me if I said it was because I find you extremely attractive?" Harry whispered leaning in close to Draco's ear. Draco choked on his drink in surprise.
“We could have, but then I wouldn’t’ be able to look at your amazing body.” Harry smirked earning a glare form Draco. Draco read through the contract with Harry, they ended up crossing some things out that Draco refused to have done to him and established their safe word, dragon. When everything was said and done, they both signed it.
“The sun is up starlight.” Harry said indicating that their session was over, and Draco could leave the slave mindsight.
Draco sat there in shock. He must have heard him wrong. There was no way Harry potter found him attractive. I mean they spent years fighting at every chance they got. It was in their last year at Hogwarts when they had made a truce of sorts that Draco realized that he had a huge crush on Harry. At the time though Harry was with Ginny and rumors of them getting married were going around so Draco did what he did best. He buried his feelings deep inside himself and ignored the boy.
Draco just nodded and put the now empty cup down on the coffee table. He couldn’t believe he told his boss about his family drama but it was interesting to find out that they had a connection before even meeting.
“Sorry for the mess.” Harry mumbled sheepishly cleaning up the plates and cups, “Have a seat I’ll be right back.” He said as he walked out of the office. Draco looked around and sighed, there was no way he would be able to seat down in this mess. He put his bag down and started to put the books away.
“The world is ending…Draco Malfoy apologized for being an ass.” Ron mumbled watching the blonde sit down with his friends.
“Please let me, it will distract my mind.” Draco said, he hated thinking about all that had happened. Even though his mother had assured him that him coming out was not the reason she divorced his father, that it was long time coming, he couldn’t help but feel like it was his fault.
“No, I don’t believe so…she once told me that she tried to search for him right before she married my father but couldn’t really find out anything.” Draco said getting up to make a fresh pot of tea.
“Good.” Harry said switching nipples and wondered if Draco would be okay getting his nipples pierced.
“No, sorry I didn’t pick up the first time, I was just studying in the library,” Draco rambled finding a bench and sitting down, “Did you need something?” Draco asked setting his stuff to the side.
Draco gracefully fell to the floor, his hands tucked into his lap and his head bowed. Immediately getting into a slave mindset.
Draco started to pull back cursing himself, he had royally fucked everything by forceable kissing Harry, Harry was the boy who lived why would he want to be with some low life ex death eater. Harry quickly grabbed him around the waist surprising Draco, before Draco could say anything Harry was kissing him. Harry pushed Draco up against a tree and ran his hands down tell he was cupping Draco's perfect ass. He would be lying if he said he never looked before.
“Would you like more tea? Maybe some more sweets? You seem to like them quite a bit.” Harry said glancing down at the small pile of wrappers in Draco’s lap.
“Relax Mr. Malfoy your only five minutes late. Nothing to worry about.” Harry said leaning back against his desk.
"As much as I would love to have sex with you on my front rooms floor let's move this to my bedroom." Harry gasped between kisses moaning when Draco started to kiss and nip his neck.
Draco had sat by the Black Lake for most of the day, but the pain of hunger was getting to be to much. He stood up and dusted his pants off and started to walk back to the castle. He wondered what Blaise and Pansy were up too. Pansy was probably off tormenting some first years. Blaise would be in the library, reading some random book. Maybe he would join Blaise after getting some food and study for a bit. Anything to keep his mind from thinking about Harry Potter.
"As I was saying, I know it may be difficult returning to the school after all that has happened here. Not many would understand the struggles both of you had to go through. My door is always open if you need to talk. That will be all." McGonagall said dismissing her old students.
“WE ARE NOT DATING! You broke up with me after I found you cheating on me with some random wizard!” Harry shouted before turning and walking toward the Slytherin table with Draco.
A creak was heard, and the door slowly opened. Draco looking the worse he had ever looked hesitantly stepped out staring at the floor. Harry pulled his invisible cloak out and wrapped it around Draco.
“Harry is just messing around. He really loves me and is just pranking me or something. I mean who wouldn’t want to be with me?” Ginny asked looking around at the people at the Gryffindor table.
"You were right by the way he is my cousin on my mother’s side. Never met him though, he was disowned before I was born. I doubt that my family tree is what you brought me over to talk about though." Draco sighed accepting the drink Harry offered him.
“Thanks Blaise.” Draco whispered as Blaise sat him down and got makeup out. Blaise quickly fixed Draco’s makeup and before long Draco was back behind the bar. He looked around and didn’t see Harry, he ignored the little flare of disappointment at the thought that Harry might have found someone to spend the night with and started making drinks and talking/flirting with people.
“Can you see my cock disappear into your slutty hole? Look at how easy my cock slides into your hole. This hole is for me only understand. Who do you belong to?” Harry asked grabbing Draco’s jaw and forcing him to look at where they were connected. Draco watched as Harry’s dick slid in and out of him, he watched as his hole swallowed Harry dick whole. Harry suddenly pulled out making Draco whine with want.
“We have school tomorrow; I can’t show up in the same thing I wore earlier.” Draco said the thought of wearing the same dirty clothes made him want to gag.
“This goes over everything that I would want from a slave, it also lists everything that I am willing and capable of doing. I want to go over it and see what you are willing to have done to you, essentially I want to make sure we are on the same page and I want to set up a safe word with you.” Harry said handing the contract to Draco.
