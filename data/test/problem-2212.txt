Dolohov, it seemed, had used the Cutting Curse- and it was worse than Harry had ever seen in his life. Starting from the middle of Draco’s torso, running all the way down to his hip in a deep laceration. Several people held him down as they attempted to stop all the heavy bleeding, but every time they tried he fought back with violent screams, kicking and squirming around under their touches, yells turning into animal like howls, then sobs, then back to screams again. And the blood- there was too much. Even if he survived until surgery, he would have lost too much to get through the rest of it.
Draco looked to where Harry was staring, and then back to his left. Dolohov had been distracted by another student, but it was only a matter of time before he attacked. When Draco didn’t reply, Harry moved away, but before he could go anywhere Draco had taken his face in his hands and pressed his lips to his; deeper and more intense than ever before, fiery and frantic and desperate, like this was the last time he would ever see him. When they broke apart, Draco was gasping- choking out words he could barely get out.
Draco woke up disoriented. Sunlight streamed through the Infirmary window, but he couldn’t be sure whether it had been one day or several more since he had last been conscious. He lifted his arm and followed the drip all the way down to where it stood, seeping some sort of liquid back into his body.
Lighter than he’d done before for Harry was sensitive but hard enough to draw a yelp, Draco slapped Harry’s arse with his fingers inside of him. He felt the clench instantly, a dizzying tightness to imagine his cock in.
Harry changed into a long-sleeve white cotton shirt and thick brown trousers to hide what might be dirt. He had given up on plants since Hogwarts, but if he focused hard enough past the noise and guilt he could recall Pomona Sprout’s voice saying something about soil quality. He had the power of the internet in his pocket, too, with endless knowledge on muggle planting practices.
In the quiet space where their pillows met in bed Harry had heard from Draco exactly how Riddle had phrased the threat of killing Draco’s parents in front of him. Harry had listened closely to how terrified Draco had sounded even years past it and knew that if anyone tried to hurt this man again he would end them.
“Good.” Draco nodded, putting his hands back at his side through bleary eyes. “Good.” Before he knew it he was hugging Harry again, the two holding one another tight. “I am so, so glad you are alive.”
Harry sat back down, a little unsure of why he’d stood in the first place. “It has to do with the fact that Draco and I are put through enough in our daily lives. He gets harassed at the hospital, and I get called a ‘fairy’ by people I am
“I am just a month older than you,” Draco nodded to Harry. “At least no one can accuse us of having an age complex,” he said under his breath.
“Tonight it’ll just be her and me, so quit looking so freaked out. But since you want to meet her, and she has wanted to meet you for a long while now, how does next week sound?” Maggie pressed on.
Girls grinded back on their dates, avoiding eye contact entirely as they both swayed to the beat with her arse pressed up against his stiffy. A hundred carbon copies of that exact situation unfolded all around Draco and Harry, who had consequently fled to the dinner tables.
“I don’t get it,” Draco announced as he straightened up the coat rack. It had been a long day at work, but a rewarding one. “Haven’t you got enough dramatics in your life?”
“Don’t you think,” Harry said, hand trembling as he reached for his drink. He took the glass and brought the straw to his lips. Merlin, he was so scared, but so was Draco from how white he’d turned, and it seemed genuine. Had this truly been without scheme? Was this
“Because Gryffindor or not, you cannot expect that boy to ever go public with you,” Lucius insisted. “To announce a wedding with you.”
“And hello to you, too,” Draco replied when they parted for breath, voice lower and silver eyes sparkling. “I figured you would be all about getting justice tonight.”
“You,” Draco nearly whispered. “Are like a dream come true.” Draco stepped forward so he was at the edge of the bed, both hands immediately going to cup and grope the globes of Harry’s arse. He pushed his skirts up just enough to get to him. “This arse is art—what I would do if I could paint.”
Lucius had been desperately trying to cope with his son’s rather obvious homosexuality ever since Draco’s sixth year and one of the ways he normalized it was by equating the heterosexual dating experience to Draco’s. Lucius wanted to play match-maker and get the knot tied as quickly as possible.
“Haaaaappy biiiirthday dear Draaaaco,” everyone sang, Harry hanging off of Draco’s arm already a few drinks in, just as Draco was. “Happy birthday to you!” Everyone dissolved into clapping and laughter.
“Sure.” Lily gave him a sisterly kiss on the cheek. She would have to pass Hunter on his way up to the Ravenclaw commonroom anyway while she journeyed down into the dungeons.
To keep both of their honor intact, Lucius bought the engagement ring later that day. The Black and Malfoy families were to be united (definitely not for the first time, but Narcissa didn’t really like to think of her one and only as a distant cousin), and both were over the moon in spite of the nervous and jittery couple.
From the other end of the line, Draco felt a little like ramming his head into a wall. “Please, Harry. Let’s not be difficult about this. We just have to satisfy my father for now, and then… Then, you pick all the qualifications or lack thereof for the next one.”
Considering himself the victor of the conversation—as if conversations even had victors—Draco got right to getting dressed and setting up the camera.
Draco inspected Harry’s arms, coming to focus on his right forearm, manipulating the muscle there with some focus. “Hmmm.”
“Lucius,” Narcissa hissed. Whatever her husband was doing, she had clearly argued with him before about it.
“I didn’t sell the flat!” Harry defended. “I’ve got this place for life if anything goes wrong I just—I just wanted to be with him!”
“Wonderful!” Narcissa said again, jabbing Lucius with her heel in the side of his ankle. “Isn’t that nice, Draco finally settling down.”
Draco snickered and started on Harry’s trousers next, finding him similarly disposed. “Cheeky,” he accused, sliding them down and off his legs. He gave Harry’s arse cheek a clap through his red panties because he could, getting a satisfying squeak out of him. “Now take off my pants and open me up already.”
Sirius hugged him again before turning into Padfoot so he could jump all over Harry to be pet. Sirius barked and licked his face. Sure, it was weird, but Harry rubbed Padfoot behind the ears anyway. No family was perfect, but this makeshift one with Sirius was phenomenal. Harry would get more baby stories that he couldn’t remember out Sirius later.
Her curls shook as she walked away, and even though Draco couldn’t see, she was rolling her eyes with a smile on her face.
Harry nodded, his glasses heating up but he never wanted to take them off because looking up at Draco was such a gift. Harry rocked his hips up against Draco, a gentle motion at first.
Draco offered Harry his arm as a group of screeching children in face-paint scampered around them and over to the stuffed animal section. “We’re going to need teething rings, strollers, gym sets, and lots of plushies.” Imperiously, Draco grabbed a scanner gun from the counter so they could begin registering items for the baby shower.
Finally, a barely-clothed elf stumbled into their room. “Gerda is very sorry, the peacocks… The peacocks do not like Gerda. Not one bit.”
With a little laugh, Draco ran his hands down Harry’s arms. “I love you too.” Their hands tangled together in a mess of fingers and warmth. Draco wondered what cuddling with Harry and the baby would be like. The more Draco thought about it, the more he fell in love with the idea of a tiny person wriggling around in his arms.
Draco didn’t just to spite him. He hoped that if he threw up, it’d be all over the Head Healer’s lap. “If the kid’s parent already knows about magic, I don’t think a trip to St. Mungo’s is entirely out of the question,” he grumbled.
“It’s still very much a blank canvas,” Draco assured him and started a slow, nervous pace on the far side of the room as he pontificated further on how all of this could change, and how the bathroom was fully-stocked.
The chill of the previous night had turned into one hell of a thunderstorm. It pattered on the rooftop and streamed down the sides of Ginny and Blaise’s favorite diner.
“Because,” Harry defended. Climbing off of the bed and pressing her ear to the floor was the only way she could hear his growling. “Plenty of women who drink in their daily lives stop when they’re pregnant. And what do you care? We’re not adopting
Draco moaned around his mouthful, sending shivers up Harry’s spine. Pulling back only slightly, Draco began bobbing his head to take him in again and again, deep enough to brush the back of his throat like he’d promised.
Harry’s mind quickly turned to the situation at hand when Draco’s hands spread his cheeks as wide as they could go and pressed his lips to the exposed hole to kiss it deeply. “Oh,” Harry said with a shiver.
Every time he tried to confess it the words stopped flowing. His mouth went dry and his throat scratchy, and he backed down from admitting how he truly felt each time. A mad, feral part of him wanted to just shout it out now, but that wasn’t the way he wanted Draco to first hear that he loved him. Regardless of whether Draco loved him back, Harry wanted his confession to be in a moment of mutual admiration.
Harry rolled his eyes fondly. “You just wait. I’ll convince them to enroll in Care of Magical Creatures and this whole place will be crawling with newts, cats, and pygmy puffs.”
Once the scar was out in the open Harry could never take it back, like the ‘detention’ carving on his hand and the other injuries that lingered.  Harry’s stupid destiny had ruined a lot of relationships and while yeah, Draco knew he was the ‘Golden Boy’ did he really know how much he hated it?
“I’ve often been called ‘princely’,” Draco nodded before getting a nip from Harry on the collarbone.
“Weren’t you the one just saying this was invasive?” Hermione poked fun. “You can’t resist being an Auror about it.”
The look in his eyes Pansy was referring to had been the topic of conversation in the Malfoy-Potter parlor, decked out in balloons, streamers, and themed plate sets. “So sue me for being excited,” Harry laughed before sipping out of his wine glass.
Was this bitch seriously trying to squeeze a meal out of Draco? She had heard Lucius’ ramblings and she knew how rich they were… Ugh, this was the last thing he needed. “I actually had dinner plans with Harry tonight, sorry,” he brushed her off. “It’s taco night.”
“The greenhouse is nearly finished, so I may cross that one off the list today. Then we can start moving in and growing plants for the rest of the garden.” Harry watched as Draco stood, naked as the day he was born, and padded over to the bathroom.
All properly tucked in for the second night in a row, it seemed like all that was left to do was sleep. Harry closed his eyes, his glasses resting on the nightstand next to his wand and his shoebox under his bed like it had been under his bed at the flat.
She could see every twinge of emotion when Draco told him of Grace’s deal. There was hope, surprise, excitement, and relief all at once. When Draco told him the baby was a girl, Harry even had a little glimmer of water in the corner of his eye.
“I have to ask you, formally, to please not let your mouths run with this one. Don’t talk about it outside of secure, closed quarters. It’s not just my secret you’re keeping, it’s his,” Draco reminded them in a tone far too serious for the frivolous drink in his hand. He took another swig and the ice clacked together. “People don’t even know he’s gay, let alone living like this.”
It was up to Draco to restore his old home, restore his name, and to restore himself. Doing it alone was proving trying.
Watching the sleepy town outside his window, Harry poured the cereal into a bowl and wished for something extraordinary to happen.
A chill went up Harry’s spine even though it wasn’t cold. Here on his couch he was wrapped in a nest of blankets and pillows, empty snack bags littered across the coffee table in front of him. Harry brushed crumbs off of his lap and stood weakly.
She raised an eyebrow, but figured she was in no position to deny him that. Grace—one hand on her stomach—rose from the chamomile sofa. It was probably predictable, but she loved the décor of Draco and Harry’s home sweet home. “Where are we going?” Grace asked.
The words of the story didn’t really matter to Harry at all. Sure, it was a wonderful tale, but that wasn’t the point at all.
“What? No!” Harry responded, highly offended that Draco would ever say such a thing. “He robbed actually great artists at the Grammy’s and keeps making creepy commercials. It’s not even like he’s attractive.”
“—and then they absolutely just go wild. They don’t even talk about it, but Ben summons some restraints and ties the other bloke up on his stomach—“
“It’s not your fault,” he quipped back before softening. “The kid isn’t, and the way you are isn’t your fault.”
“Yes, Alice, it’s me,” Draco grumbled, looking past her to make sure no one was following her out of the Healers’ spaces. “Do tell reception I can begin taking patients again.” He didn’t stop walking, still heading for the stairs.
“I’m perfectly content with my two pets,” Pansy preened, always happy to talk about herself. “And they are
Draco grinned. “So considerate.” He wished Sirius would do the repairs with magic, but once Sirius Lupin had an idea, it was damn near impossible to change his mind.
“Do you not get that I’m trying to get you to kiss me? Fuck, no wonder you’re a virgin. You probably have had men stripping for you and falling at your feet and even then you’d just stand there and—“
Harry gave Draco a look. “Don’t say ‘guns’ in an airport,” he told him in a hushed tone. “We don’t need anything turning out like the last time you insulted a gate attendant.”
When their lips finally did meet, Harry was determined to make Draco moan. It was a singular, unremitting goal that Harry immediately clung to, much like his teeth clung to Draco’s lower lip.
“You’re surrounded by alarmists,” Draco cooed happily at the child as his wand waved over her chest. He knew he’d be the same way with his little girl.
“In May at London Pride, he went shirtless. The year before that, he actually hitched a ride on a float and snogged one of the drag queens on it. That was before he and Colin got together, of course. Theo’s a faithful man.”
Harry placed the half-unwrapped glass on the table and looked to his husband. “Draco, you’re the only one in the world for me,” he said dramatically, mocking the request. “You make my heart gushy and my cock hard.”
“I think you just did,” Harry replied, arms wrapping around his husband to pull him in. They lay together on their bedroom floor, bodies slick with sweat and hunched over in exhaustion. Harry kissed Draco full on the lips, holding him in the embrace for a moment. “How do you feel now?”
The muggle man gave the Healer a nod and opened his mouth to introduce himself before Pye spoke again.
“They’re going to be rich children, yeah!” he grinned, amused by Harry’s need for humble names. “Would you prefer ‘Pauper’ or ‘John’?”
The nightmare of a war faded away to a dream in low lights. Draco was sitting at the edge of the bed, now himself dressed in a sleeping robe of green that made his light hair all the brighter. No matter how low the lights, Draco Malfoy’s hair always glistened in them.
Maggie chuckled to herself and closed the letter from her mother. It had come as snail mail, the true muggle way, and updated her on all of the happenings of her home town. Justin had accidentally burnt his long and golden hair again, and Annie had gotten that promotion she wanted to badly at the bakery. Now she could make icing and get as big and fat as she wanted.
Draco shook his head. “That’s not right.” It was probably rich coming from an Ex-Death Eater what was right and what wasn’t. Still, Draco searched for Harry’s eyes again. “Are you tired? It is getting late, and...” Draco straightened his shoulders. “You can stay here, if you like. I will sleep in my room and you in here, and you can leave any time you want through the Floo. But—you should sleep if you’re tired.”
Draco sat back and drank in the sight of his friends clamoring for his approval. It was a complete power trip, the sort that he loved. It wasn’t Draco’s fault he measured how much people cared for him in the gifts he received from people, it was how he was raised. “Then let’s compare them,” he said imperiously, like a Roman king waving his hand at gladiators in the lion pit to begin the fight.
Draco immediately thought back to last week’s surprise in the tub. Merlin, he loved that man of his. “The theme can be anything, Pansy. The
The text wasn’t from Ron or Hermione, though. It was from a contact Harry had entered into his phone at the last minute the previous evening. Draco and he hadn’t stayed up late enough to hear back from Chris in favor of sleeping.
“Quite the flirt, aren’t you, Harry?” Draco replied in his most gentle of teasing, which for most was still pretty strong. “What is to be done about that?”
It took a couple of hours of lazing about in bed pondering for Harry to come upon a decision. That decision was that if he lay here any longer the pile of hair he was pulling out would become a mountain, so he needed to leave immediately.
It wasn’t that the restaurant was terribly expensive; it was just that Harry had never had someone to go into a joint with (admittedly fake) red-candle chandeliers above the tables.
Draco turned to him and gave him a soft smile that made Harry’s heart stop. “No, I do,” said Draco. “And I will.”
Harry couldn’t help it—he needed something to sink his teeth into when Draco fucked him like he did.
Last in the unpacking came his custom emerald sheets, ones he’d insisted on bringing with the matching pillow and curtain set. He wasn’t sleeping on ratty old Hogwarts linens.
Draco reached for his wand from his discarded trousers and murmured a spell that slicked his palms up with lubricant. Draco warmed it in his hands, making sure it wasn’t too cold for when he smoothed it over Harry’s puckered hole.
“Good.” More sure of himself this time Harry kissed around the crown of Draco’s cock, tongue flicking out in swipes of wet heat up and down his length.
“Wiggling those hips like that ought to be illegal, yes,” Draco confirmed with a joyous laugh as it had been his hope that he wasn’t misreading Harry’s movements that were clearly displaying more goods than others. Draco was always paying close attention to Harry’s body, his body language as well. “I could tell it fit. I could also tell you love wearing it.”
Ginny lay on her side so they could be face-to-face. “You’re very superficial,” she said fondly. “I guess it’s easy for you to be because you’re so pretty.”
Harry blinked because he really didn’t know what he was ‘gonna do’ about that. Teddy was always a joy to look after on the rare occasions he worked up the courage to see him, and though more hyperactive Bill and Fleur’s kids were sweet when fed.
“We’re only sure you’re alive because of Pansy’s updates from work,” Blaise agreed. “You never go MIA like this, even when you have a new boytoy, so this one must be something special. Go on, tell us about him!”
“Anyway,” the chipper woman went on. It was amazing that she kept her pin-straight hair so neat around a bunch of kids who were prone to magic hiccups. “We offer an incredibly comprehensive education program that integrates music and art into conventional learning techniques.”
Okay, that was immediately a mood swing from her first sense of dread, but she was thirteen. Thirteen! Thirteen and liking a boy!
Draco’s frown deepened when he realized he wasn’t getting his break now. “Fine,” he huffed. “Thank you, then, and get on your way.”
Draco closed the door behind him, letting out a shuddery breath. Madness, complete madness—and now Pye was after his job? And had been all along? Draco’s frown deepened, his anger still roiling in his gut. He wanted to hex that stupid look right off Pye’s face, but that would surely result in his firing.
Either way it was the last day of winter break, the last eve of freedom before school began. Harry figured he had to eat right.
Draco Malfoy in all of his obscurity and sudden burst of alertness from the coffee, turned the corners of his lips up. “I’m still not convinced.” This ‘Harry’ was interesting.
“No,” Draco sniffled, voice full of self-pity. “I’d rather suffer and wait it out than find some quack doctor in Michigan. My family’s physician is the only one I trust.”
“Yes, mine,” nodded Harry. “You’re the skeptic and I’m the believer, and this time believing is going to win out.”
“I like this, too,” Harry said, giving both of Draco’s cockhead a tentative kiss and rubbing his shaft.
Draco rolled his eyes fondly. “You’re the worst, do you know that? That’s hardly the proper way to speak to the godfather of your precious daughter. Also, who is the lucky couple for this one going to be?”
“That’s because…” Molly interrupted with a loud, showmanlike voice. “This is your card!” She reached behind Fred Jr’s ear and pulled out the Six of Hearts. Fred Jr. gasped and started to feel for anything else that might be hidden behind his ears.
Harry stayed silent for a long moment, withdrawing his hand as he thought. “Draco,” he said. “I know it’s scary, but you can’t be afraid of failure. Hear me out,” he stopped Draco before he could interject with more whining. “You can’t be afraid of failure because failure isn’t the end. It’s just the beginning. If you make it and you don’t like it, you can always change it. You are so capable of change, Draco Malfoy, even when it’s scary.”
“What your father means to say,” Narcissa tried to translate. “Is that building a house with someone is as serious as a marriage. You said he lives there already? Can he not afford his own lodgings with the Potter wealth?”
‘Uncle Draco’ was thrown for a loop with each sentence. He’d never been spectacular with children but this extreme discomfort was a first. These children at least hadn’t read the Prophet’s filth but what if one day they did? Would they still be so eager to call him Uncle? It took Draco a moment to realize he wasn’t responding, just standing there looking petrified.
“Hmm?” Harry was loath to get into serious talk when Draco was being so amorous. He wanted nothing more than to disappear into his arms and soak up every last bit of affection he’d never thought he deserved before Draco but thoughts of murderous Lucius Malfoy coming after him made him hesitate. “You’re going to tell your parents?”
Theo was laughing so hard he wiped away a fake tear. “Oh, this is so rich,” he got out between laughs. “Potter’s gay? With you? And you didn’t even know it was him until you met?”
Harry listened to the rustle of Draco pulling some pyjama pants on in the spirit of politeness, however, before getting up to brush his teeth in their shared bathroom.
The television lit up with a shot of Harry looking at Draco with dramatic, romantic music framing his gaze.
Draco rolled his eyes. “And you had to come all the way here to tell us that? What about the friend you were staying with?”
He wouldn’t be back to the Manor until long after dark, and being there was more draining than work sometimes. While his father and mother were exiled to the estate in France it fell to the sole heir of the Malfoy family to rebuild upon their Wiltshire land to ‘reclaim what was theirs’ or whatever Lucius was on about now.
A charmed glass wind-chime signaled her arrival in the potions shop, and from the back room, a man shouted: “Be there in a second!”
Shit, Draco hadn’t even hopped to the nearby market to get a copy. Half of him wanted to ask what absurd lies they’d printed, but the other half knew his father had a much more resigned and sensitive sense of humor about fame.
It had somehow led to Harry giving him a messy kiss in the dark and Draco just going along with it. He was alive, and he’d be damned if he didn’t follow what made him happy after a war that nearly killed him.
Harry watched him squirm in his sleep with a predatory grin, noticing Draco’s own stiff cock covered up by his boxers.
“Wait—Think about it. Lily Narcissa Malfoy-Potter,” Harry insisted, sitting on the edge of Draco’s couch.
Draco had been envisioning this entire situation—an imagined fantasy of saving some street rat and starting some Pretty Woman makeover—in a limited way, it seemed. Discretion more important than money, what an odd request. Did this man want to sugar in a trailer park? No doubt this ad had gotten countless replies already because of that caveat the man added to the end. Draco wondered if he should even bother writing in. Money was his edge here, and while he had a deeper vault in Gringotts than any other candidate could dream of, what if the person who put this ad out rejected him anyway? Could there be anything more pathetic?
“Test them,” Draco instructed of the bonds and Harry tried to pull his hands apart and out, finding himself unable to. “Good boy. Look at me.” Harry turned his face to Draco’s, looking up at him through his glasses and eyelashes.
“We’ve talked to Alvaro and he really cares about you. This is an opportunity to meet someone who really does want to be around you,” Harry pressed on.
Draco sat down in his arm-chair across from his patient and let out a disgusted and frustrated noise rather than responding with words. He didn’t want to think about that woman at all.
“Third flame from the door,” the medi-witch planned as she strolled away to answer a call on a broken arm. It was maddening how many accidents went on when the children came back from school.
Maggie’s flat was in the meat-packing district, which was absolutely a ridiculous place to live. There were thousands of muggle trucks zipping by during the day, and women walking the street at night. To be fair, Pansy had seen one man in a pair of gold shorts. Equal opportunity.
Draco licked his lips in response, fingers going as wide as they could so he could nudge his cockhead against him and begin to ease in. Now that burn was intense.
“Then what is it?” She wasn’t going to drop her girlfriend off and leave her to drink herself into a stupor over a meeting with Maggie’s mum. She wasn’t even half as fiery as Maggie was. That came from her father.
“Only the highest thread count, of course,” Draco said of the sheets. He wondered what Harry’s fingertips felt like and was breathless a moment.
They walked back to meet Draco’s parents and they were thankfully still at the table, not having followed the couple.
“I didn’t look into her mother’s eyes,” Draco answered quietly enough for Grace to second-guess what she heard. What the hell were they talking about? Voldemort had killed her mother, not the Malfoys. Even Nott had testified to that.
When Ron Weasley got started talking about one of his beautiful, perfect children, it was hard to stop him. “She’s great, absolutely great, crawling and everything. She’s a fast one, too! Always blabbing n about ‘mama’ and ‘dada’, I think she’s going to be a real genius like her mum.”
“Yes,” Draco huffed, controlling Harry’s head to get the right angle for his thrusts every time. “You like choking on my cock?” Draco moved Harry’s head up and down in a ‘yes’ motion and Harry moaned in agreement. “That’s what I thought.” Draco pulled Harry off of him and grinned like a jackal to watch him pant and wheeze.
Instead of his usual gamer’s feast, Harry decided on a bowl of cereal before bed. The gamer’s feast consisted of soda pop, cheese doodles, chips, and cookies that all combined to give him some pretty weird dreams after eating.
“So I will hear nothing more of this about the man our Harry has chosen to bring home. Have I made myself clear?”
As Draco modeled where he wanted Harry to be—clinging to him and kissing him—Harry felt like a beautiful doll being posed for Draco’s enjoyment. Yes, it was literal objectification of himself, but he couldn’t fight how hot it felt to be wanted like this, like a special toy. Draco had taught him there was no sense in fighting his desires, not when they were something that brought Harry pleasure in this cold, at times cruel world—and never cruel in the fun way.
Kingsley wanted plenty of shots of the actual online messages between the lovers, shots of Harry and Draco on the road, and a voiceover of Harry explaining what the show was all about.
“Me too,” Harry replied fast, excited that they had that in common. “You’re the only one I replied to.”
"What? No, he hasn't," Harry assured Alvaro quickly. The thought of Draco having been with any of Harry's friends would have made him sick for many completely platonic and pure reasons. Completely.
Draco’s hand rubbing him up and down with such dedication sure felt like more than a ‘little’ encouragement. Harry’s toes were permanently curled under now in his heels.
“No, no, I’m fine,” Kingsley amended quickly. “I just wanted to ask how you are doing. How you and Harry are doing.”
That was another thing. Harry had asked Chris to call him back, but he got a text. Why didn’t Chris want them to hear his voice? It was only more evidence against his existence.
She was a royal-watcher, a celebrity-stalker, and in her worst moments, downright obsessed with Kate Middleton’s childhood. Tiffany Sato had read every article that there was to read on ‘Waity Kaity’ and her quest for a ring.
“Training until night again?” he asked, attempting conversation. Their relationship took work, sure, but that didn’t mean he was entirely disillusioned and unhappy.
“Underground secret society,” he answered without thinking. Luckily, Colin didn’t ask for elaboration. “Sorry.”
“Goodnight,” Draco said cheerily as he assisted Harry in seeing everyone out. “I’ll owl you in the morning!”
Draco considered himself victorious. “Wonderful! So I’ll be helping old queens and learning about struggle and such. Great plan. This is going to look marvelous to colleges.” He got into position to scamper back upstairs.
Still, the happy surprises outweighed the bad ones. Draco made him laugh and they never seemed to run out of things to talk about together.
Ron didn’t even look up from his babies to refute that. “Hey, Rose, why don’t you give your little brother a kiss? Yeah, right on the side of the head. That’s your little brother, sweetie.” Harry quickly joined Ron in speaking to the kids as if they could understand. “And this is your Uncle Harry.”
She squeezed his hand and released it so Draco could take it once more. “Be safe, you two. I shall get a subscription to this ‘Quibbler’ and look forward to reading it.”
How his heart had pumped when he sent the ad in. It had almost scared him to hear it so loud in his ears. Then the approval of the ad came back and this heady, hot feeling came over him again, and once more when the magazine went into circulation and he was able to read his own ‘anonymous’ writing. That intense and sudden physical sensation had been a terrifying mix of fear, shame, desire, sadness, anger, too—it was all emotions at once, and scared this brave Gryffindor half to death. There were so many ways this could go wrong and every time Harry tried to list them—exposed to the press, taken advantage of while in submission, no one responding at all because even anonymously he wasn’t worth shit to anyone—he got panicked like this.
“Please, step into my office,” Draco said tersely, unlocking the door and stepping inside to hold the door open for his boss. He hated having a boss. Why couldn’t he just save and heal people without this looming hierarchy? And why did the looming hierarchy have to be headed by such a nit-picking, sour old man?
“—definitely walked in on them at one point. I can see it in McGonagall’s eyes. Whenever she looks at Remus and Sirius, I can just feel her thought process, you know? I can just feel that she’s seen their cocks—“
“Malfoy, for two,” Draco spoke confidently to the attendant. The Malfoys were old money and Draco tipped big, so he was comforted in this familiar spa because there were wizards who would always value reliable, incoming coin over all else. Greed could be so comforting; what a simple sin.
“Well.” Draco wasn’t sure how to approach this, as he was with most things, so he just did what he usually did and charged in to make a mess of things. “We need to speak with someone who personally knows Macklemore.”
Calmly, she sat down in front of a pensieve and poured the liquid-gold recording into the water. She’d secured her dark black hair up in a bun so it wouldn’t get wet when she dipped down to immerse herself.
The nurses, Medi-witches, and Healers had taken their dinner break (even the workers that technically had a dinner break an hour ago), leaving the children momentarily unsupervised.
Harry rushed after Draco past portraits, statues, and finally up the grand staircase. “Draco! Maybe they’re outside, it’s nice out tonight—“
“Well, you know,” Harry fumbled. “Some gay people like their privacy. Not everyone’s as accepting as we’d want them to be, homophobes all over the globe. Not to mention that I’m me, and mentioning that kills any chance I have of getting to know someone without them seeing me first as ‘The Chosen One’.”
Draco couldn’t help himself. He reached forward to stroke Harry’s cheek. “Such a beautiful smile.” When that smile was directed at him Draco hardly knew what to do with himself. He had to focus, keep his cool; keep the smooth Daddy act up until he was so close to orgasm he couldn’t keep anything up anymore.
Draco made it all the way up the stairs down the western third hall to the guest room and froze at the half-open door. He couldn’t see anything with this tray in his face, and he had to concentrate on the spell. In it was, even if doing so made a fool of him.
In the corner, ‘Lily Evans’ was written three times with different flourishes so he could see what the best sort of font was for his Lilyflower. The second font was apparently best, because James then used it to write a poem in her honor. It was raunchy, stupid, and so characteristically James.
Continuing the massage down Draco’s back Harry found several more tight spots that needed a good kneading. Harry attended to each and every one of them, face contorted in concentration as he massaged.
Immediate alarm bells. Harry just meant he liked how straight Draco shot in his speech, right? He would never be put on a pedestal around him, yes, that was it. The alarm bells calmed down, with Harry teetering back in his chair a little.
Harry, wrists covered by two frilly black and white cuffs, slowly moved his hands down to scratch between Draco’s shoulders. It got him a hum of appreciation against his hole, drawing a quiet moan from the back of his throat.
Harry should have known not to bet against Draco’s tongue, after all. He was at its mercy every day of his life.
He stepped out of the shower into his sandals and wrapped a towel around himself on the way to his locker. With a drying spell and a quick change of clothes he was on his way, out of the locker room, employee lounge, and into the lobby.
In all honesty, Kingsley could care less if Potter and Malfoy got along. It would provide interesting banter while they searched for the truth, and if worst came to worst Kingsley trusted the editing team to make them look like they enjoyed each other’s company.
Just as Narcissa had planned, Anne Bowen called for her house elf. “Waldy!” she snapped as he rushed to her side, leaving a concerned Gerda in the parlor door. “We’re leaving. This harpy can give the baby to whoever she wants. Zeke, come along.”
“I know some dungeons we can rent for the night,” Ginny waved off. She had mostly just come to see Draco and Harry interact before the big meet-the-parents moment, most of the details of this plan as good as done to her. She was cocky, but hell if she didn’t earn it.
At least his talent was being channeled into something positive, Ron supposed. “And he took off for you, just like that?”
Harry looked to Draco to explain that one. “It will do you the good of meeting the woman having our child,” Draco said simply. “Because that’s our decision.”
“She needs a bra, Remus,” Molly finally pushed out of her. It was good to get that off of her chest. Metaphorically. “At age twelve, women start developing breast buds.”
“So.” Draco forward curiously to see what Harry had written on the paper. “What’s your autopsy reveal?”
Draco made a face and Harry breathed a sigh of relief. He had no clue what that insane whitish bird was, since it definitely didn’t resemble one of the peacocks he’d gotten to know. That species was all about a woman’s choice of who was the best-looking man, after all. She didn’t have to dress up or anything. “You want them to multiply?” Draco asked skeptically.
“It’s hard work, and often messy, but I love it,” Draco confirmed. “Before Harry I spent perhaps too much time there, but now I’ve got a nice balance between work and life at home.” Having Harry to come home to made all the difference. “I have a roster of regular patients who come to me for all their ailments and I know them well. I do get new patients from time to time as well, and some emergency cases. It depends on how short-staffed we are that day.”
That was the final nail in Draco’s coffin. He had one hell of a crush on this guy no matter who he was, and now they’d past the point of no return. Draco had feelings. Gay, mushy
Parkinson raided the mini-fridge and passed around bottles for everyone, but Harry hadn’t touched his and smiled when he realized Draco hadn’t, either. Harry sort of wanted to remember his prom night.
“Good. You do quite the same to me—how you tempt me bent over and whimpering,” Draco said and purposefully brushed his erection against Harry’s thigh. Harry shivered in a way that made Draco feel powerful, and dangerous. “We’re going to make me fit in that little hole of yours.” Draco prodded experimentally at it with his finger.
Harry knew what Lucius was going in to do for Theo, for his son’s best friend, for Harry’s case, and for Remus and Sirius’ friend.
“I know just the one. Right this way, sir,” the clerk led, stepping out from behind the counter. “Looking for yourself or for a present?”
The girl’s eyes darted away. Explaining herself this early on would make her sound crazy. Then again, all of this would make her sound crazy. “I’d rather not say it right now,” she decided slowly, playing the role of the innocent girl to maybe garner some sympathy. Playing the ‘orphan’ card was her specialty, too. “It’s kind of complicated.”
Dudley wasn’t as mean as he used to be so Harry figured he should be slightly grateful, but the thickness of his head was at a consistent plateau. Not even seventeen years growing up beside Harry could change that.
“Sure I can,” Draco told him with a mock-encouragement as they scanned the horizon, eyes peeled for a head of blonde curls.
Harry went on to massage his arms and legs, paying special attention to the feet Draco had to stand on all day to do his best work. Harry wanted tomorrow to be a better day for him, one where he could be more relaxed at work.
That was a shock. “Please tell me you at least have pictures,” Harry grinned. He’d never had the means to masquerade as a woman himself and sometimes liked to wonder what it would be like to wear some kitten heels and a corset.
Harry shifted his weight from one foot to the other in a nervous habit. “We all did idiotic things when we were younger. Ron knows what he did was wrong, he knows he shouldn’t have called you those names—But you? You sit on your high horse and play the victim when you’re the one who started this all.”
Then it was Draco’s turn to fall apart from the heat of it all. He moved in and out of Harry, guided by Harry’s own hands into the friction. “
Draco usually walked these halls with his head held high in spite of his past but now he was slightly crouched, clearly trying to hide and blend in with the crowd.
From the second Ron had brought it up, he’d been stonewalled (no pun intended) by Harry’s objections.
“Save a Quidditch Player, Ride a Broomstick,” Ginny joked right back. “Oh, Merlin, look at this. They didn’t even spell ‘offspring’ right. It’s missing an ‘f’.”
“Hey,” he said with a smile anyway. Being around Colin kind of lightened up his afternoon. They greeted with a kiss on the cheek before Harry sat down on the bar stool next to him. “What’s going on?”
But Harry didn’t want the world, he just wanted Draco. He opened his eyes. “Could you… please be rough with me tonight?” Harry asked through his blush. Asking for what he wanted was getting easier each time he tried it, but that didn’t mean it wasn’t damn hard. “Show me no mercy.”
Alecto passed over her slice of bologna for Mulciber to write on. Without wasting a second, he wrote down a single word and slid it around the table so everyone could see.
Twelve owls fought to get in at once, some succeeding and some less so, bursting in as one feathered flock.
“I’m going to,” she decided before realizing her hands had curled into fists. There was something so unnerving about taking all of this beautiful new life without having earned any of it. “You said I could do whatever I wanted while I stayed here.”
“Of course,” Draco agreed. “And because I like you in tight little numbers that show off your arse.” He cupped Harry’s cheek and rubbed the soft, soft skin there near-obsessively in his inebriated state.
“Mr. Pierson!” Draco greeted his blue muck-covered patient who looked just as horrified as the intern had been, if not worse. “What seems to be the problem?”
“Then I’ll get rid of the women that have given the department or satellite agencies more than one child,” she said with another swish and flick of her wand. “One thousand three hundred. Have you and your husband even discussed what sort of child you want to have?”
He let a little bit of blush cloud his face at being called her ex, for he would always feel a bit embarrassed that he thought he liked girls because Ginny reminded him of his mom.
“Yeah,” he murmured, suddenly wishing he hadn’t brought it up at all. Theo was being far too understanding and making too much sense. Colin would have rather wallowed in in his own distaste. No woman was wonderful enough for his father except his mother.
“I think it’s a good thing you’re here, Professor Malfoy. We have a duty to these kids, a responsibility to model behavior for them,” Harry explained. “There are inter-house tensions that need to be relieved.”
Harry relaxed, knowing they would be. Molly and Arthur just wanted to see Harry happy, he knew that. They’d get over the shock just like Ron and Hermione did, maybe even easier than Ron and Hermione did. “Yeah, that’d be nice,” Harry admitted. “I’ve been avoiding it because, well, I’ve been depressed, but things are looking up. I’ll owl them tomorrow about it.”
The day Harry had been appointed Head Auror he’d had a panic attack. It was Draco’s final straw before assigning Harry a therapist he trusted in the hospital.
From the other side of the glass, Remus and Sirius had to grip each other’s hands tight to keep from launching themselves into the room and shoving a bottle of Veritaserum down his throat. They’d come so far in burying their friend, only to be stopped by homophobia. It was wrong on every level Remus could think of.
“Then why can’t I just make things easier?” he pleaded. “I’ll raise that baby to respect people of any gender, race, blood status, or sexual orientation. I’m picking my battles, Hermione. I can’t be responsible for one more struggle Draco has to go through.”
“The fact is you’ve made more progress in these last few months with Harry than you made from years on your own with the project,” Theo pointed out. “So cheers, cheers to you two.” He raised his pink drink and finished it off.
In comparison to the last room everything was a little bit blinding at first. Metallic walls, tile floors with a drain the middle—why would anyone need a drain? Was he in over his head here? The equipment mounted on the wall of this room was mostly glassware, some with metallic coils in the toys that might be used to… conduct electricity? Science Lab indeed.
With arms full of bags filled to the brim with train accessories, Harry exited the store feeling like he’d just gotten away with something almost like stealing. Every piece was paid for, and on his Daddy’s tab. ‘Hurt his wallet’, Pansy had said, and Harry had done just that.
A happy hum left Draco’s throat with Harry’s come leaking out of his hole. “Give me ten more minutes of snuggles and then we can shower,” he decided.
Draco was feeling similarly blessed, having waited so long to get inside Harry when he was all dolled up like this for him. “Such an obedient housewhore,” Draco moaned, nails digging into Harry’s hips as he moved them onto himself. “You’re such
“I can’t believe your father actually set you up, though. I know he’s always talked about it, but I never thought Lucius had the gall.”
“…And he isn’t pushing any Gryffindor-esque designs on you?” Lucius grumbled, seeking some confirmation.
“Uh-huh,” Harry nodded before his noises turned to more moans. Heaven help him, his cock was fully erect again. Harry was at his own body’s mercy at this point, feeling achy and shuddery with his resurrection. His legs shook, and it took Draco taking his hand off his cock to force his hips down and make them stop. “I’m ready,” Harry insisted. “I’m ready for you.”
“You want to know what else I am?” Harry asked rhetorically. Draco almost answered with ‘an idiot’. “I’m the street-smart one of the two of us. Let’s go to the room.” And beyond that, he really was tired. Draco only snored a little bit and stopped if he pushed him on his side, so sleeping next to him was better than not sleeping at all by a long shot.
Tom Riddle had always disgusted him for obvious reasons, but there was logic to behind why Riddle did what he did. He was born while his mother was under the effects of a love potion. He was a product of rape, and at least a thousand defects had to come from the potion. Sometimes, on better days, Harry felt sorry for him.
Harry, in spite of everything that was happening, was beaming with pride to see Draco taking responsibility for his actions. Harry had forgiven Draco long before he apologized, too.
Packing had been quick with Harry taking only a few outfits, some snacks, his shoebox of memories, and his broom. Harry was in a way glad Amortentia could do one good thing for the world—force him to be reflective enough to remember he loved flying. The wards on the Manor were extended like a shield which left a hefty rectangle of space for Harry to practice being up on a broom again.
Draco led Harry around the first floor, showing him the kitchen and dining rooms and quite the assortment of parlors. He narrated his building process as he walked, hoping to give Harry some insight into why things looked the way they did.
!” Harry called out, now having to consciously hold back the buildup of heat within him threatening to burst. “Please, Daddy, if you let me come I’ll do anything for you!”
“What’s this?” Harry reached for the top letter on the stack that had scrawled on the outside: READ FIRST. “This is Hermione’s handwriting.” Harry would know it anywhere.
Harry took his seat in first class next to Draco, who for some reason liked being near the window on airplanes but not in hotel rooms.
Harry groaned, feeling Draco’s forehead rest on his as what had to be the hottest thing ever said was said to Harry fucking Potter, who was already a lucky man with his prick being rubbed by Draco fucking Malfoy.
Listening to another principle of The Art of War, Grace did not march into land she didn’t know the terrain of. Her outpost on the bed staring at the wall would have to do.
That was so typically Harry, smiling at the idea of evil and dialing the phone number without hesitation.
Oh, how Draco loved that strictly traditional attitude of Harry’s paralleled with his kinks and sexual appetite. Draco gave him a quick peck and smiled to himself about it. A boy who liked to get whipped couldn’t stand the idea of seeing anyone but Draco ever again. That was something to reward him for.
“I can’t believe it, I can’t believe this asshole,” Ruth growled but let herself be led away anyway. “He doesn’t even talk like this online, are you sure it’s the same person?”
Draco couldn’t get over the fedora, he just couldn’t get over it. What person in their right mind led on a pretty girl and met her in a
“Remus is smart. Remus is brilliant, really. I’m sure he can figure out the next clues, but, um, they get harder as things progress. There may be a point where he can’t figure them out.”
“I’ll… Keep that in mind.” Ron stepped away from his third-wheel position and towards the door. “Hermione needs me at home,” he said, waving a goodbye to them. “Or, rather, Rose does.” It was his turn to read the bedtime story.
“But I owe you,” Olivia continued before backing away. It was funny to think about, but they both smelled nice when he hugged them. Not in a perfume sort of way, but it was still nice.
The door to Draco’s apartment opened. His face lit up on seeing Harry, and stepped back to usher him in quickly. “Hey. You have the—?”
Draco’s gaze flitted from feature to feature on Harry’s face. His green eyes, his long lashes, his plump, soft lips…
Looking up through his glasses, Harry grinned like he had a secret. “I’m not much interested in witches, Professor.” Then he overcorrected out of nerves. “I mean, women are great, they are, they go through a lot. I mean, I’m a feminist.”
Harry gave his side a pinch. “Hey, not just any roly-poly. Our kid will be fantastic, just like their daddy.”
“My parents never had sex, Hermione. Never. Pretty sure we’re all adopted,” Ron told her seriously. “It’s a wonder we all look the same when I doubt my parents have ever even considered having sex.”
“Janice Goldman,” Draco told him with just about the same amount of exhaustion. Thus far they’d only been able rule out five women on distance and three on responsibility issues. The reasons that they wouldn’t pick certain mothers would deteriorate over time into more petty reasons for the sake of getting the damn thing over with. “We really need to start ruling more women out.”
The poor thing had two left feet, and while Draco was just beginning to see his personality he experienced online show through in person, it was still evident he had a tinge of social awkwardness.
“My biggest worry? Well, I’ve got more than a few,” he laughed dryly. “But my biggest… has to be for Draco. He’s an excellent Healer, and loves his job. He’s told me stories, about people not wanting to be seen by him because they ‘thought’ he was gay. Now people know, and they know too much, frankly, and—and I just don’t want this to affect his life negatively.”
Draco made a face. Had he just admitted to himself in some strange way that he was Harry’s friend? That Harry was his friend? This whole working situation was really fucking with Draco’s perception of friendship in general.
Ms. Trelawney was the only teacher crazy enough to loan out their room to a bunch of strapping young lads with armfuls of gifts. Her eyes had widened when Ron asked like a pair of saucers. She said that this event was foretold in the stars, or some shit like that.
“Wait,” Pansy interrupted, taking a moment to look at Maggie. “This is the first time that all of us are in a relationship. Every single one of us.”
Draco’s desk was perfect for letter-writing, and it made Harry think of how ‘D’ must have written his replies here in those precious early days that weren’t so far off.
“Hm?” The other man was busy patting his face dry and the green tea scent of the mask wafted over to Harry.
“That’s what I used to think,” Lorraine nodded. “I swear—I hardly ever do stuff like this. But that was before the money.”
He applied the facemask in even but thick strokes, starting with Harry’s T-zone and working out. It was a fragrant and consistent solution that Draco caked on and thinned out with his fingers until Harry’s face was covered in an even green coating.
The children stampeded back from whatever lavatory George had taken them to, taking their places at the table with great eagerness.
“Yes, well, it would seem so with you somehow securing the affections of Harry Potter. I read your Quibbler interview—the first piece of real news to ever come out of that fanciful storybook—and you both agreed no one was under the influence of a spell or potion. If I find out you in any way used our facilities here at St Mungo’s to put that boy under some kind of influence—“
Hermione’s right hand flew to the switch a bit faster than the boys behind the desk had expected, so their response was slightly delayed.
“One!” Harry yelped as Draco’s bare hand left a stinging mark on him. “Two, three, four,” he gasped out while Draco held nothing back.
The receptionist hurriedly began shifting through papers, knocking a nearby soft drink over in the process. The poor thing was jittery in the face of fame. “Sure thing, yes,” he hurried before yanking up a small file. “The applicants were sent through Doctor Hart. Her office is just down the hallway and to the right, where she’s weeded out the applicants. There was a bit of an, er, information spill.”
“Yeah, yeah. Blood’s thicker than water and all that bullshit. Let’s not spend any more time thinking about my parents, hm? It kills the mood,” Draco refocused. “Now tell me something about yourself that I don’t know.”
Harry raised a brow. He had been the one who insisted Draco chose their course of action. Was he picking a muggle shop to prove something to Harry? “Alright, then. Lead on.”
When Harry heard the familiar crack of apparation, he turned around. Also gracing the Malfoy-Potter kitchen was Ron Weasley—who was busy digging into Draco’s bowl of fresh fruits—who appreciated Harry’s effort, but wished they weren’t doing this.
“Four more. The one after Kenny lasted the longest—Sam, two months. We had dates and things, and then some weekends together.” Harry frowned to remember how he’d hoped for more back then. “How many men have you slept with?”
“You can have it all,” Draco said wistfully. The amount of galleons that Grace would do unspeakable things for was a trifle for Draco. He just didn’t care about it, which was the epitome of his privilege.
Sometimes she’d wake up in a panic, knowing she had to wash that cat with the light-pink soap before time ran out. Details of the dreams would haunt her throughout the day, a case of déjà vu playing out whenever she saw a flight of stairs that looked similar to the one she fell down the night before in her mind.
‘Same Love’ had probably even changed some minds in the world and created a discussion amongst thick-headed straight people that led to the conclusion of: hey, maybe gay people are people too (a shocking concept to Americans along the Bible Belt).
“So we talked about our, um, interests, and what we looked like,” Harry went on truthfully. “And one thing led to another and we decided to meet at that bar you told me was nearby, Ron.”
Draco spread the lubricant on his fingers, licking his lips at the sight of Harry moving his ass up, all-too ready for Draco to open him up.
It was nice to hear Draco talk about something he loved. Sure, watching Draco complain and bitch and whine was amusing in its own way, but Draco looked so much softer reclined on that hotel bed talking about his family.
With a whimper Harry adjusted to the new girth by biting harder on the pillow. Harry breathed deep and released the soft fabric from his mouth, leaving a wet spot for him to rest his cheek on. Without his glasses he looked back up at Draco in bleary wonderment as he was split on him.
“Congratulations,” Draco awarded him flatly. “You can read.” The man had glasses with rims thicker than the ones Harry wore back in high school so Draco wouldn’t have been surprised if the man could see into outer space with those magnifying glasses on his face.
“O-Oh,” said Harry of the unexpected head massage. It felt nice, and Draco’s hands on his head guided him easily to laying down on the lounge on his stomach.
“I’m just so glad,” said Harry, another tear falling. “That they understand. I didn’t say it for the interview but I was so afraid—
On the opposite side of the invitation was a single phrase: Crème Brûlée. The password and the safeword.
“If you think that’s bad, then you should just see how much the closet renovation cost,” Remus teased. His husband had a proclivity towards going overboard.
“The sex is fabulous—and you know how I hesitate to use that word since it sounds so stereotypical.” Draco already gave off enough of a gay vibe.
“What about?” Draco asked, bold as ever. If Pye was seriously going to do this the second he got back then he was going to make it as difficult as possible for him.
Harry cracked a big smile. “Yeah, okay, you can do all that,” he agreed on behalf of Draco mostly because he wanted to see how Draco would react, too. “I’ll see when it’s good for him and we could have you by the Manor to eat. I can cook,” Harry reminded them by pointing at the near-empty bowls in front of all of them.
"Fuck, did he kill your pet dog or burn down your house or something?" Alvaro climbed in intensity. He needed to know what was keeping this couple apart when they were so clearly great for one another.
“So this is why you were so touchy about a name,” Pansy realized and sat straight up at the edge of her seat. “You have to tell us. You absolutely have to tell us now.”
And oh, how Harry’s mouth fell open with a flick of Draco’s tongue. Draco didn’t hesitate to deepen the kiss, greedily lapping at the roof of Harry’s mouth.
Harry started with his thumbs pressed deep into Draco’s right shoulder, immediately zeroing in on a knot that held a great deal of tension there. “Ah,” said Harry. “Here’s where you’ve been keeping your stress.” He began to rub the hard spot like Draco had done for his back in the past.
“Yes,” Draco groaned. “Yes, yes, yes…” he trailed off to admire the liquid seeping down Harry’s red-striped thighs. Draco continued his steak of mercy to reach around and stroke Harry as he wound down his thrusts, needing only a few pumps before Harry too hit his peak.
“No, he does not hate you,” Draco confirmed with some amusement, thinking back to when Harry thought that about them.
“Go on,” Harry encouraged. “It’s not my only gift, but it’s the only one I could give to you in mixed company.”
Hey! Just because Draco was a drama queen it didn’t make him a woman! A woman wasn’t even a bad thing to be, but Draco had always felt distinctly male. “
“Alright,” Blaise said cheerfully, giving the girl laying between him and Ginny a pat on the back. It felt a little like when Draco used to pat his back after a winning Quidditch game. “That was fun. You should get home while there are still cabs.”
“And who will watch this child? I don’t think the Head Auror can just up and leave, but neither can you.” While their personalities often grated, Pye knew he needed the other man. Malfoy-Potter was a brilliant Healer and was willing to work hard for his own ambition. That, and Draco was often requested by high-end patients because of his fame.
Harry peeked out a window. “That’s a lot of space,” Harry observed. “You could put a Quidditch Pitch out there and have room to spare. What are you going to do with it all?”
Sensing his hesitation, Harry looked to Draco and swallowed his bite of potato spiral. “What is it?” Harry asked, voice small.
The most delicious moan came from Harry beneath him, and Draco was thrilled that he’d found a weak-spot so early on in… Well. Whatever this was.
The inside of the office had cubicles and desks like any other office, all of which were unoccupied at the moment. The office was empty. Had they emptied it for Harry? There were little knick-knacks on the desks like people ought to be there.
“No, no,” Harry assured her quickly. “I’m just… not used to talking to anyone but Draco about this.”
A heavy shudder passed through Kennedy, and for a moment Harry felt like he was the only thing holding her upright. “I don’t care what you look like, B. I love you,” Kennedy told her girlfriend weakly. “I just have to know why you lied.”
Draco rested his forehead against Harry’s as he ghosted his hand up the inside of his leg and to the bulge in his underwear. Draco could feel that Harry was not only hard and ready, but his size was nothing to scoff at.
Draco bit his lower lip when he looked down at the gorgeous man who he was apparently having a moment with. He liked that Harry was shorter than him, it let Draco be the one who felt bigger and like he could protect the other man. His boyfriend.
More importantly and more surprisingly it even seemed Lucius knew what he’d done wrong, and how he’d taken his wife and child along for the ride. Harry had argued for them, and while it looked like it just pissed Draco off more, he did receive an apology and a thank you in a moment after the dust settled. That was all Harry had ever wanted.
“Wow, a television in Malfoy Manor,” Ron tried to imagine. He knew the place looked different now but seeing any digital screen around even the amorphous new Manor in his mind seemed out of place.
“Since when is it to you? Harry, how did this even start? What in the world made you go near Malfoy and not just befriend him, but—! Harry, how did this happen!?” So much for keeping her cool, but she felt justified in her frustration.
Harry could have just written that he wanted a general caretaker, but he didn’t. Familial love was one thing, and he had it, and had nothing to do with. It was separate for him, this concept of being a Daddy. It was something he’d heard young, in the muggle schools whispered on the streets about the single mothers around the area, about teachers and waitresses. ‘Kelly’s gotten posh ‘cause she went and got a Daddy!’. Petunia loved to gossip loudly with Harry in his assigned cupboard.  At the time it was both the money that Harry focused on and one key factor: escape. It was forbidden slang, a forbidden thing for a boy to want.
“Which leads us down to your eyes.” Harry said all of this while pressed up against Draco’s temple. “And those long, lovely lashes that surround them. Have you ever seen your own eyes when you smile? Not just like a ‘that was funny’ smile or a polite smile, I mean a huge, real smile. They look like diamonds.”
Pillow talk about Harry’s job could be fun sometimes. He’d tell Draco swarthy tales of arrests, convictions, and patrols. Drunken broom-riding arrests were funny, bad breakups ending up in the hands of Aurors were funny, and animal control cases were funny. Femur bones? Not even slightly funny. There was no irony, no grace, and no humor (Draco considered making a joke about humor bones, but it seemed in poor taste).
Yet another spite against Nott was his son. Theo had grown up to be the opposite of him, and wouldn’t even pass on the Nott name when he married. It would die with him, and it would make Marcus furious.
“Oh, Merlin,” Draco realized, terrified enough to pick up on one of Harry’s favorite expressions. “I’m having kids before Loony does!”
“He knew a guy who could get his hands on the stuff. James gave me a bag every birthday and we passed it around,” Sirius recalled fondly.
“Harry James Potter,” Draco started and Harry gasped, hands flying to cover his mouth and the shock. “Every day with you has been the best of my life. I can’t imagine a world without you, without us, sweet boy. I want to make you stupidly, deliriously happy for the rest of our lives together. I want a life together—I want you. Would you make me the luckiest man alive and marry me?”
“Oh, you’ll be taking more than my fingers,” Draco assured him. “But I won’t be cruel, I’ll open you up first.” Draco scissored his fingers open inside of Harry again and again, pushing his walls out and kneading his prostate with his top knuckles.
“What? If I had access to the Malfoy family funds I’d be running a tab. You really have to hurt his wallet more, Harry. I swear he likes it,” she teased of her friend.
“That I am.” Draco allowed himself to smile. Of course Harry had to have heard by now. “It took a lot of work to get there, too. Some entire days are spent lancing boils and things far worse than I will mention over drinks, but now that I know it’s right I could never do anything else,” Draco nodded. He complained about his job because he complained about everything, so the primary thing he liked to impress upon people was that he loved it, first and foremost. Draco was not given the luxury of public complaint in his position. “It’s right for me, and it’s certainly right for the patients. Even if they don’t really care for their Healer, he gets the job done."
“Even the first date I ever went on was stupid,” Draco sighed. “And not in a ‘he took me to the wrong place’ sort of way.”
Draco shrugged. At least she was honest. It would’ve been funnier to see her lie about selling Girl Scout cookies or whatever, but honesty was always appreciated. “Boy troubles?” he teased. That was what teen girls liked, right? Except the lesbians. Shit, he should’ve put ‘or girl’ in there. Draco was such a bad gay.
“And here I thought you were going to play nice. Come on, you know exactly how to push their buttons like you do mine and you have to restrain yourself when the time comes. I can give rewards, too,” Harry reminded Draco.
Draco held nothing back on his moans in this massive house that was all theirs. “Yes,” Draco groaned, head tipping back slightly. “Yes, open wide for Daddy, and don’t forget to relax and breathe through your nose,” Draco instructed as he slid his cock in between Harry’s lips and all the way to the back of his throat.
Eek, sorry this one took so long! I also wrote most of it on the day after Donald Trump was impeached because I was so happy I had Drarry dreams all night long. Wishing many Drarry dreams to you, my sweet followers!
It was a jewel-tone based design, with fluffed pillows of violet on a sapphire bedspread with art of flowers on the walls, all gently blowing as if caught in a breeze.
Kingsley wouldn’t be accompanying them on their travels in order to work on all of his separate projects (The Real World Miami wasn’t going to direct itself), so they bid farewell to him at the airport and walked to Gate 3B as fast as they could. Harry would have accused Draco of trying to walk in front of him as some power-trip thing, but that would have set him off again.
Okay, so maybe I did the thing again where I take forever writing the last chapter, but I hope this is sweet enough for you to forgive me. A lot has happened in these past months (a new job, a year’s anniversary in quarantine), and I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for listening to my madness on this one. Your love, support, and readership means the world to me in a world where cruelty, ignorance, and fear reign supreme. Don’t ever let anyone tell you how to love when you’re consenting adults, and let your freak flag fly. That’s it for now.
“It’s brave of you to think for the child,” Harry told her in the utmost adoration. Even he was finding a favorite in her.
Draco laughed. To his mother standing in the hall of Draco’s room it was sort of a sad laugh, the kind where nobody else was laughing in return. Just her Draco and a screen.
Harry finished his chewing and spoke, having received admonishment for speaking with his mouth full of food in his training. “You can do it, Draco. You’ll get it done for you, like you taught me. I can focus on the outside, and you can on the inside. You know, there should likely be a centerpiece for the whole garden—I was thinking about a fountain. Do you want to pick one out with me on the weekend? We could get it installed, put the space into perspective.”
Giving the same pain to countless men in his past was one thing, but Draco could really not take what he dished out.
Harry couldn’t even be properly happy that he’d killed his opponent. The blood elf fell to the ground and one of Harry’s fellow soldiers picked up the flag he had dropped in order to gain points for the Alliance.
Figuring there wasn’t anything else left to do, Draco waved his wand and the luggage rose off of the bed and onto the cold dungeon floor. Draco liked it down here, he always had, preferring to run cold than hot.
The wet noises of their kiss and the slapping of Draco’s skin against Harry’s filled the room. Draco, as always, had found just the right angle to thrust forward at so that he brushed against Harry’s prostate and sent bursts of heat through his body.
Harry gave Draco a wobbly smile. He’d never heard anything so sweet about himself in his entire life. “Thanks, Da—Draco.” Harry went red after correcting himself.
Colin gripped to his boyfriend and the lie as tightly as he could. He would point Harry and Ron in the right direction for the case afterwards. In that moment, he was content with showering Theo in tulip petals and laughing when he swatted them away.
His thumbs flew to the keys. This was really happening. Harry was really meeting a bloke he liked and who could snog him during the loading screens when he logged on to World of Warcraft.
After several flanking orders and forward assaults, the enemy had been driven into the corner of the second floor.
There had always been a smidgen of guilt on Remus’ part for having Sirius change his last name from ‘Black’ to ‘Lupin’ considering it put them in the middle of lines rather than the front, but the animagus was tickled pink at the change. After all, it probably led to Walburga having a seizure in hell or wherever completely awful and prejudiced people went after they died.
She shook her head. “No. I made the decision to let all of that go and to delete all my online dating profiles.”
“Tomorrow night,” Sirius affirmed. “Now, do you want tonight’s dinner? I could heat up some Chinese food.”
"Hari! We've got to get on the train!" Draco didn't seem nervous. He was just his usual impatient self. It was endearing in a way.
barely glanced at Hari, despite his celebrity status. Tix never asked questions, which is why she was one of the Lord's favorites. "Can you take Hari to meet Draco? I have a few letters to write to see where he will be living."
"The School Governor checkup. Hari had read his letter, but there was no reply. I was sent, as everyone else was busy." Remus leaned closer.
Hari hesitantly scrawled his name on the door sign. Mr. Lupin looked on, smiling fondly as Hari spelled his name, H-A-R-I.
"Why am I such a freak, Dudley?" The boy laughed at Harry's tears as he pulled his hair hard enough to yank his whole body.
Harry sat up, wincing at both the pain in his back and at the sudden overwhelming light. The man seemed concerned, but Harry was pretty much numb to it, considering the he was holding a wand and had just unlocked his cupboard without a key.
Lucius led the young boy out of the cupboard, absolutely furious about his treatment, and even more so when the boy winced at a few movements. Hari had been severely malnourished, and most likely beaten. After taking another glance at Hari, he could tell immediately that this was no trick, no matter how much he wanted it to be. When he had been elected to go check on Mr. Potter, he expected nothing less than Hari being the spoiled boy his father was.
"No, it very much isn't, dear boy. But this better be." The blond shot a glare at the surprisingly silent Petunia, who looked absolutely terrified.
"Stupid boy! What took you so long? Nevermind, just get to work!" Aunt Petunia screeched at him. Harry, glad he hadn't had to come up with an excuse, kept his mouth shut as he started the coffee machine and cooked the bacon. Dudley, meanwhile, kept moaning and holding his stomach like he was as starved as Harry. But he had a right to. Harry had been dragging his feet the entire morning, and Aunt Petunia hit his shoulder with a frying pan, causing him to burn himself, but it didn't matter. Harry picked up the pace. He finally had breakfast on the table, and the blond family pigged out while he washed up. He wasn't allowed to eat unless Petunia said he was, and Petunia was still mad at him for messing with her bush a few days ago. It made her give him lighter chores though, so he was grateful for that.
We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry..."
Abuse warning, but he's with the Dursleys. Until he went to Hogwarts, everyday of his life should've had a warning. Hari kind of 'finds out' his wizarding heritage...
"James-" Her sentence was cut off by the door closing and immediately locking. Lily  rushed towards the door, but once she heard those words she felt paralyzed. James couldn't be that stupid. Yet she had seen the telltale green light from under the door. Her heart raced as she rushed towards Hari, stopping in front of his cradle just in time to block him from shards of the wooden door. Voldemort entered and Lily screamed. She couldn't remember when she had started crying.
Draco jumped up, confused as to why someone would knock on his door. The house elves just appeared in his room, Mother was running a quick errand, and Father was away on Governor's business. When he opened the door, though, he didn't expect a small boy with tan skin and black messy hair. The boy's head shot up, and the first thing Draco noticed was his bright green eyes that contrasted with the rest of his appearance. He decided not to comment, though.
"Mr. Potter?" Harry nodded hesitantly, surprised and confused by his aunt's silence. She glowered at him and he flinched away. "I'm Lord Malfoy. I've come to see if you've accepted Hogwarts's offer," the apparent Lord said with a much warmer tone than when he was talking to Petunia.
Harry's thoughts were interrupted by a knock on the door. Aunt Petunia stopped the vacuum cleaner and rushed to get it. Harry watched from the small peephole he had in the cupboard door. She opened it, but gasped in horror. Harry adjusted himself so he could see the person at the door, wondering why his Aunt Petunia would be scared by a guest.
"Because you, dear Hari, are oblivious and don't pay attention." Draco said fondly. Hari stuck his tongue out at him.
"Of course, Mr. Potter. You are a wizard, you know." Hari looked up and smiled like he had forgotten that little fact. Lucius saw some slight hesitation in his face and briefly wondered what it was for. Then Hari hugged him tightly. Lucius hugged him back softly, as he knew his strength far surpassed that of an eleven year old and he was trying not to hurt Hari further. Hari broke the hug.
"I'm done madam. What should I do until the lesson begins?" Harry chose his words carefully, knowing full well that the Dursleys had made him out to be a delinquent. Her eyes narrowed at him. She was probably suspicious.
"What's his name?" He asked. He turned pink as Malfoy's gaze switched to him. He  quickly looked ahead, pretending he hadn't been staring at the older Malfoy. Pretending he couldn't feel his gaze.
“We-” Draco held up his hand. He rubbed his temple, and Ron was shaking his head. Hari didn’t know how to react.
"Whatever it was mate, that was bloody brilliant. I mean, the both of you were." The redhead grew sheepish and rubbed his arm. "I mean, thanks." Draco was staring intently at him, but Hari didn't know what to do about it. He could tell it was bugging the boy, but Draco... was Draco.
"Goodbye, sir. Goodbye, Miss," Hari barely managed before Draco dragged him onto the train. "You'll miss them later, you know." Draco waved a hand dismissively.
"Did I...?" His voice trailed off as he realized that he didn't even know exactly what he did. Harry was reassured by the older man's nod. Dropping his gaze back down to the frog, he poked it gently to see if it was real. He had never seen a blue frog before. The frog hopped away from his probing finger and glared at him like it was offended. Well, he hadn't meant to hurt its feelings. Harry looked up as Lord Malfoy decided to speak.
"I'm Hari. Nice to meet the two of you." Hari tried to see a difference between the two. Fred had slightly bigger eyes, he realized. That was good, at least he'd be able to tell them apart.
I'm currently able to do this on a computer, so all the formatting might look nicer, but I dunno. (This is my first work, so I'm still trying to figure things out.) And I'm sorry about the wait. No excuses, just moving forward.
After figuring out that Hari didn't seem to know many games, and Draco was much too impatient to teach him, they had settled on hide and seek. Obviously, Draco was winning-
"We can't be friends, Marco. I won't let you get hurt. And I don't even know what why you became friends with me anyways. I'm a freak."
"They were not!" Harry blurted indignantly. He shrank back as Dudley loomed over him with a grin on his face.
Harry whimpered at the blows, his tears and blood mixing in a sticky, hot mess as the two fluids ran down his face and throat. His lips threatened to open as the mixture made them more and more slippery. He kept them shut, if only so he wouldn't make the ugly sobbing sounds Vernon wanted to hear from him.
"No need for all that ma'am business, Mr. Lupin. I am much too young for that." Remus nodded, smiling nervously, hoping he looked more confident than he felt. He could see his failure in the change of Narcissa's gaze, but as it had softened rather than hardened, he guessed his awkwardness was almost helping him.
"Hello." Harry nearly jumped out of the tree at the unexpected voice. "Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you." He stared at the blushing boy.
“I’m Hermione, and a boy named Neville has lost a toad. Have any of you seen it?” She had the same glint of ambition in her eye that Hari saw in Draco when he talked about being the top of the class. Hari liked her already.
This chapter has some wizarding stuff, so Hari is *finally* being properly introduced into the wizarding world. Also, was it necessary for me to dedicate so many words to the little blue frog? 1000% no. Did I do it without any regrets whatsoever? 1000% yes. I'm sorry it's up so late. I had a MAJOR case of writer's block.
"What were they like?" Remus smiled, and when Hari looked, he could see that far off look in his eyes.
Hari meets Draco and figures out where he's meant to be. Switching perspectives, but mostly Draco's and the point of view of Remus.
"Thank you. We'll - I'll - We'll be sure to take you up on it." Narcissa shook her head, sighing so softly Remus almost missed it.
"I can't believe... you threw his wand... out the window," Draco said in between laughs. Hari felt the heat rise in his face.
"You're so stupid, you can't even spell your name!" Petunia held up the crumpled Math worksheet from preschool that Dudley had managed to wrestle from Hari's hands. "You probably cheated, you lying snake!" Hari's vision blurred so he couldn't see the 'A' he had gotten, only red ink and a messy 'HARI' scrawled at the top of the page.
"I love you and Hari. Maybe I can stop him." He opened the door as she reached for him. A cruel laugh echoed in the house. "Lily, take Hari and go! Go! Run! I'll hold him off!"
"You devil-freak! Trying to sneak food bought with my hard-earned money, ingrate?" Harry shook his head frantically, but only got cuffed again. Apparently that was the wrong thing to do. "Liar! Filthy weasel!"
A few hours, breaks, fireplace calls, and way too many letters later, Lucius only had one more letter to write.
"Maybe you and Hari would like to come over again sometime," Lucius said smoothly. Remus was slightly taken aback at this. But Hari did seem to love Draco's company, and Remus would like to put their past behind them.
"Of course not, why would anyone be friends with a weakling like me?" Dudley seemed satisfied with that answer. He swiftly punched Harry in the stomach.
"Come in," she called softly. The door opened to her husband smirking like the absolute dork he was. His hazel eyes crinkled at the sight of her and she melted. Lily loved her husband so much, and she knew the feeling was mutual. He walked toward her and knelt down by her side, gazing at their child lovingly. James pushed Hari's messy black hair out of his eyes. Hari gurgled quietly at the touch and closed his striking green eyes.
By the time Harry was done reading the letter, he had not only figured out that whoever this McGonagall was, they were bonkers, but he also knew this was a prank letter. Magic wasn't real.
"They get along well," a smooth voice commented. Remus looked around and saw Narcissa walking towards them, her heels clacking against a marble path.
"Draco." Lucius - When did he start thinking of him as Lucius? Since he saved Hari, a little voice reminded him. The name had a thoughtful lilt to it.
The redheaded twins Hari had met earlier had run into the compartment. Ron had crossed his arms, and now Hari could see the resemblance between them. The twins had changed into the uniform, complete with Gryffindor ties and crests.
"Those are your parents." Hari woke from his daydreams and studied the picture. There were obvious similarities between him and his father, but he had his mother's green eyes. Hari turned slightly so he could see his guardian's face.
"Say goodbye Hari," he said. The woman's eyes widened. She tried to protest, but thanks to his silencing spell, she couldn't even squawk. His gaze softened and shifted to Hari when he felt a tug on his hand. Hari was looking down, but Lucius could still see a hint of pink on his cheeks.
"Certainly sir. Young one, you is to follow Tix. I will take care of that." The creature had a serious look on their face as they took the blue frog, not seeming at all used to smiling. Harry sent a glance at Lord Malfoy, but he only nodded in reply, so Harry followed the strange creature, the 'Tix' the older man had been speaking of. Tix appeared to be female, based on their long eyelashes and the way the pillowcase they wore had a lacy hem, although Harry couldn't assume, especially since in other species, gender could work much different. Harry had learned from a library book that starfish were born male or female, but could change their gender whenever they liked. And gender expression wasn't the same as gender itself.
"Yeah," he croaked out. Marco crawled out and gasped, the tears flooding harder down his already tear-stained cheeks.
"I'm hiding from my cousin," Harry said nervously. The boy nodded. Most of the school knew Dudley, his gang, and his freaky little cousin.
“That’s enough. I think we can piece it together.” Hari smirked at the exhausted look on Draco’s face. Fred and George glanced at each other, then looked back at Draco.
Hey guys! Thanks for leaving kudos on my first work. And shout out to HELGHASTMAJOR for being brave and leaving the first comment. Y'all get a chapter for Christmas. I won't usually be able to update this often, but what the heck? It's y'alls Christmas present. If you don't celebrate Christmas, that's cool too! What holidays do you celebrate? Comment below!
"Thank you Tix." Tix gave him what seemed like a smile, but it was much too wide and had way too many teeth, like the one Petunia had when visitors came for tea. Still, they were trying, and Harry smiled back fondly at the attempt, even though it did remind him of his Aunt.
Trigger warning cause flashbacks, sorry for being so late. Also just to clarify, we use 'Hari' at times when Hari is aware of this spelling, or if a point of view is from a character who knows, and 'Harry' when he is not aware/tried to forget/was brainwashed into thinking 'Hari' was incorrect.
"You're a Malfoy. A Malfoy, sticking up for this blood-traitor? Ha!" Flint leaned towards Draco, who had shrunk back ever so slightly. Hari grabbed the two wands out of Flint's hand, giving one to the redhead immediately. Flint whirled around. "Why, you little shit!" Hari threw the wand out the window, grabbed both Draco and the unknown boy's hands and ducked around Flint, taking off. They ran until they could no longer hear loud cursing, then ducked into an empty compartment. Hari was out of breath, but the others were out of breath for a different reason than running.
"I'm fine. This is fun." Marco smiled and turned a slight pink. Harry laughed at the sight of him, bits of plant stems and flowers stuck in his usually neat blond hair. The two of them had tried to make a daisy crown, but they had no idea how, so It really ended up a mess. Harry turned around to face his friend and frowned jokingly at him. "Now, now, Mr. Marco, you absolutely cannot keep your hair like that," he said in a funny old lady voice. Marco laughed, his dark eyes twinkling as sunshine filtered through the bushes. Harry painstakingly plucked out the plant parts one by one and fixed his friend's hair.
Remus walked into the kitchen and Hari stuffed the rest of the roll into his mouth, turning away from his new guardian. He saw it anyway, however.
Hari hesitantly started towards the front of the train. He didn't want to accidentally break a rule he didn't know about. He soon saw the huge crowd at the front of the train. Soon he saw a familiar trio and rushed towards them.
Harry watched the exchange with blood in his mouth and an ache in his heart. It hadn't been a good thing. But now his friend was safe.
"And that counts for both of you." Mr. Malfoy tried to sound stern, but the warmth he felt for the children was apparent. Hari found himself grinning.
The class passed in relative normalcy. Dudley and some of his friends stared daggers at him all class. At lunch, Harry rushed to get outside, knowing if they caught him he was in for a beating. He climbed up into one of the big oaks, the dense branches mostly hiding him from view.
Remus watched as the Malfoy boy taught Hari to fly. Even when he had hated the Malfoy family, he knew they were good on a broom, even though the boy's grip was wrong. And... Remus didn't hate the Malfoys anymore. Their rivalry was childish, and the Malfoy family seemed... Much more kind. They had been through war, and come out losing, and yet... This seemed to strengthen them, make them better people. Remus spared a quick glance at Lucius, who was watching the boys with a fond smile on his face.
"Hello Mr. Lord Malfoy sir," Harry said politely, wincing at how weak and broken his voice sounded. "It wasn't a prank?" Mr. Malfoy's eyes narrowed.
"Not Hari! Please, have mercy! Have mercy!" Lily felt so helpless and weak. She looked around for her wand, but she was cornered. The roar in her ears was louder than anything else. She sobbed, the tears blurring the flash of green light before everything faded to black.
Harry desperately needed to eat. He wished he could have a tiny sip of water. But he couldn't, as he had gone and screwed it all up.
"Does that mean I get to escape? And I never have to come back?" Lucius melted and crouched down in front of Hari.
Suddenly, Harry heard the voice of his cousin and panicked. He looked at Marco with an intense worry and fear in his sharp features, Marco reached to hug him. The boys held onto each other tightly, trying not to make a sound. Dudley was alone, which was strange, but Harry didn't question it too much. He shifted and froze when a twig underneath him snapped. Marco's eyes widened and Harry covered his mouth immediately. He would not let his only friend get hurt.
"I wonder what they're doing right now. I hope Moony's okay. I wasn't able to be with him this full moon. And he was still living in Siri's apartment when Peter last updated us. I wish they all could be here. Peter is doing a decent job at updating us and sending messages, but it's just not the same."
"Well, we better get going. Nice to meet you too, Hari." Fred dragged George towards the end of the train, where it seemed a lot of the older kids were gathering.
Harry snuck a peak through his cupboard shutters, seeing nothing but darkness. Good. He could finally open his letter. Turning on the small, flickering lamp he had, he broke the seal of the letter and began to read:
And even though he didn't like how she would react when he said the m-word, he had to tell someone, and Aunt Petunia would handle a prank letter much better than Uncle Vernon.
"I still can't believe we're actually parents," James said happily. His wife laughed and kissed his black curls. He looked up at her with nothing but a fierce love in his naturally sharp features.
"But I thought she hated him?" Hari glanced back at the picture. "Or maybe not." Remus laughed brightly. "Remus?"
"If I'm not going to be with Petunia and Vernon and Dudley, where will I be?" Lucius frowned a bit. This was an even bigger issue than it may have seemed to Hari, because while muggles may have done things one way, the wizarding world did things quite differently.
Remus and Hari were curled up on the couch, flipping through a leather scrapbook one of Remus's friends had made for him. Was it... Hogrid? Hari wasn't quite sure. Hari was snuggly pressed against his guardian's chest, but he didn't mind. In fact, he felt safer in the arms of Remus than in the arms of anyone else. Except perhaps Narcissa. She gave the best hugs.
Lily didn't reply, but James was grateful. He didn't need advice, and there was nothing he could do anyways. His wife knew that. So she just listened. But the almost soundless shattering of wards startled him from his thoughts. James broke the hug and had his wand out in an instant.
Hari hugged his Uncle Remus tightly. The transition was going to be very difficult, especially since he had just gotten used to a few nice people, and now he had to get used to an entire castle of people, many of whom would not be as sensitive. But he could always write to Remus, and Draco would be there too. Remus broke away.
"How'd you come across Hari?" Remus asked once they were seated. He tried not to fidget. Lucius didn't seem surprised; he knew how direct Remus was when it came to serious matters.
"Oh my gosh Harry, we need to get you to a doctor!" Harry's arms shot out to prevent his friend from running for help.
"That they do, ma'am." Remus could only vaguely remember Narcissa, as she was in the year below him, but she always seemed much kinder than her sister, and more sophisticated too. Even now she somehow managed to chuckle gracefully.
"May I come in?" A tall blond man stood politely in the doorway. He had long hair, and was wearing what looked fancy silk wizard robes. Harry shook his head. That was a ridiculous comparison. Petunia nodded subconsciously in answer, always the perfect hostess. He stepped inside and Petunia closed the door behind him, still gaping like a fish. "Is this the Dursleys residence?" Petunia nodded quickly. Harry could see why she had been frightened. His aunt didn't particularly like anything out the ordinary, and this man was anything but ordinary.
"You haven't got a wand to hex me with, and even if you did you wouldn't be able to do anything. You're just a dumb little firstie. If I broke this wand, you'd have to go home. Your bunch of blood-traitors can't afford another, can they?" By now, Hari's blood was boiling. He brought his wand up, and Draco quickly mirrored him.
"Weasley is my last name. Ron's my first," Ron said once he had recovered. Hari scrunched his nose in confusion.
Harry stared at the letter in his hands. This couldn't be real. Who would write to him? And nobody knew where he slept.
"Marco, stop crying." Marco rubbed his eyes and cheeks. There was no obvious signs he had cried, as a lot of the redness could be attributed to fighting. Now for the real trick. Harry made the most scared face he could and ran into the house. Marco followed, frustrated at Harry's antics. Harry ran straight into Petunia, who gripped his collar roughly. Marco skidded to a stop.
“Well, well, well. Ickle Malfoy!” Hari couldn’t help it this time. The look of pure embarrassment and fury on Draco’s face... Hari burst into laughter. Ron let out a chuckle poorly disguised as a cough, and Draco threw up his hands in disbelief. He shoved Hari onto the seat on the right side of the compartment.
"Lily was so kind and fair, but very fierce and stubborn when she wanted to be. She was so smart, the top of almost every class. She had this uncanny knack for figuring something -anything- out. Before she started dating James, I studied with her after full moons."
"Oh, so you wouldn't mind if I did a tracking spell to find him then? This is important." Without an answer from Petunia, Harry became a bit worried, but didn't dare move. If he didn't move, the man could not find him without a real tracking device, and tracking spells weren't real. This was all an elaborate prank. "Homenum Revelio." Was that... Latin? It almost felt like something was swooping over him, but then it was gone and Harry mentally berated himself for even having a shred of hope. "Alohomora."
"True," she conceded, "but he got that mop on his head from you as well," she said teasingly. James chuckled and rolled his eyes.
"You is arrived. Goodbye, young one." They had stopped in front of a beautiful, dark wooden door, with a snake scale pattern carved into it. Harry turned to thank Tix, but was met with only empty air. Oh, he loved magic. Time to meet Draco. Harry knocked on the door.
Harry put it down for a second. Whoever wrote this letter had spelled his name wrong! Harry was not a hard name to spell. With a frown on his face, he picked the letter back up and continued reading.
"Hey, give it back Flint!" Hari and Draco locked eyes and nodded. They took their wands out and quietly approached the compartment. They both peered around the corner, and saw a young redheaded boy reaching for his wand, which was in the hand of a much older boy who had his back to them. 'Flint' twirled the wand in his hand, just out of reach.
"Harry-" Harry rose his hand and Marco stopped talking. Harry sighed. He hadn't wanted it to come to this.
"Stupid boy! What were you doing in my prize hedge?" She threw him to the ground. "Thank you, boy, for bringing him to me," she said to Marco, who looked horrified. Petunia looked at him with suspicion.
"Oh, my mom's gonna be so mad. The garden's her pride and joy. Anyone in there with you, freakshow?" Marco gasped, tears blurring his vision. Harry simply shook his head.
"You can't be friends with me anymore." Marco's heart stopped. Harry's sharp features looked so serious and intense. His normally bright green eyes had darkened with pain.
"Harry-" Marco mumbled under Harry's hand, but instantly cut off. He didn't want to be heard by Dudley, who was now stalking towards the bush, his hand already in a fist.
“Hello Fred. Hello George.” Hari shook hands with them both, a grin on his face. Ron blinked at him, and Draco nudged him. “What?”
Harry crawled through the bushes of his Aunt Petunia's garden, his friend Marco right behind him. Marco pushed him forward on accident, eager to keep moving.
"Them?" Now that Harry thought about it, that had been a strange question, and Aunt Petunia didn't ask strange questions. The man seemed to understand all at once, but Harry was still out of the loop. "Oh. You're a muggle, aren't you? Well, yes." Harry didn't know what a muggle was, but the way the man said it made it sound like a horrible thing to call someone. He immediately agreed with the man.
"Did you hear that?" James nodded, his heart beating much too fast and his eyes starting to water. Peter had betrayed them?
"Shocking behavior. I can't believe it," he covered up smoothly. Just then, Dudley ran down the stairs. Petunia gave a sickeningly sweet smile to Marco.
"Well, his skin is a lot lighter than mine, and he definitely has your face shape. And even as a baby he's still so graceful. You can't say he got that from me." Lily laughed again. Everybody knew how clumsy James was.
"It's been over a year James, you better get used to it soon. You know, he looks exactly like you when his eyes are closed. He has that same sharp nose."
Abuse warning, but no other spoilers. Also, the beginning of this Chapter is set about a week after Hari meets Marco. And yes, I am spelling it the Westernized way, Harry, while he's with his muggle relatives. Don't question me.
"Yeah. But she knew before I told her. I'm surprised that half the school didn't find out. I was really bad at giving excuses."
"Har har." It was true that James's hair was a lion's mane without Sleekeazy's Hair Potion, but Hari unfortunately didn't inherit his curls. Just the mess. He stood up and took his son from Lily's arms and rocked him slowly in the light of the crescent moon. His expression turned sad after Hari fell asleep and he had put him in his cradle. Lily noticed the change of mood in her husband and immediately understood. Sighing sadly, she stood and wrapped her arms around him.
"Young one, watch for the trick stair." Harry shook himself out of his thoughts and avoided the trap by stepping over it, but wondered why someone would do that in the first place.
Harry gripped Lord Malfoy's hand as a strange feeling came over him, like he was going through a skin tight rubber tube. He felt kind of sick, and as soon as the ground appeared underneath him, he doubled over, expecting that he would vomit. Instead, Harry opened his mouth and a little blue frog popped out into his hands. He stared at it curiously. Realizing that it was the m- no, magic, he looked up at Lord Malfoy with wide eyes.
"I don't exactly know, but I know people who will. Hold on tight to me, this might feel a little weird." Hari grabbed his hand and Lucius apparated them to his mansion. Hari doubled over, but didn't heave or vomit like Lucius expected. Instead, his mouth opened and a tiny blue frog popped out into his hands. Hari's eyes widened comically and he looked up at the older man.
"Boy, get that mail quick!" Uncle Vernon's voice startled him out of his paralyzed state. He quickly slid his letter under the door of his cupboard.
"Did I...?" Lucius chuckled, nodding. Then he remembered why they were here and stood up straight, but made sure to keep Hari (who was now poking at the frog and trying to see if it was real, to which the frog was reacting indignantly) in his line of vision.
"Hello," he greeted, "who are you?" His Mother had taught him to not ask that, but he thought in this situation it'd be okay, especially since he greeted the boy first.
Hari was mostly able to convince Draco that they did not need a train compartment with ten other people for the impatient boy to bounce between. However, Draco conceded only because he told Hari that there must be at least three other people in the compartment. Draco was kind of desperate for company, but Hari found it endearing, so he didn't even try to bargain.
