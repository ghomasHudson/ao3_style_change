Harry hurried to shush him, earning himself two frowns. “He also requested that none of us mentions his name."
Mr Weasley looked at him weirdly until Lucius seemed to notice his presence.
Harry hadn’t really pegged him for a romantic, but appearances can be deceiving.
“Jesus, Hermione, calm down,” said Harry, finishing his tart with a last bite. “The new professor has taught at Hogwarts before, and if Dumbledore went over the trouble of persuading him to come back, he must be good.”
Draco looked at him, his silver eyes wide in surprise before softening. “I see,” he said, giving Harry a smile as he returned the cloak. “In that case, it must be very special; Demiguise cloaks don’t usually last so long.”
“Wait, hold on,” said Neville suddenly, looking at everyone in the compartment “Please, what’s going on? Am I going crazy?"
Unsurprisingly, everyone except the newcomers broke into loud protests.
“You did too,” laughed Cedric. He then looked longingly at the cup, “You should grab it.”
Harry laughed. “Did I ever tell you about the time I made my aunt float?”
"Really?" asked Harry. "Why?"
“I was hoping for an O in Potions." Harry sighed. There went the only career he had considered following.
“I just think it’s important."
His good mood only faltered when Ginny, Fay and some other girls rushed a sickly looking Ron into the common room.
Harry regretted speaking. “No."
. Harry smiled. “I owed you that much.”
“Did you hex it?” asked Ron, eyes wide. “Hermione! You didn’t say anything about that."
Harry frowned. "No, I'm not." He stood up. "I'm not. I'm giving it a try."
Sirius coughed, suddenly looking uncomfortable. “Harry, do I need to talk to you about-"
“That’s-”
It was when Romilda Vane dreamily said that Adrian Pucey was quite a catch that Harry took pity on his friend. He stood up, patting him on the shoulder. "Come on, let's go."

Parvati scooted closer. “You know, Harry, sometimes it goes like that. Sometimes feelings just vanish and people decide to go different ways.” She sighed. “That’s just how the heart works…”
get in your way?"
“Look who's back,” mused Hermione when he plopped down on the couch next to her. She had three different books open on her lap, and a piece of parchment on her hands.
Perhaps it was because of Draco’s opinion, but Harry found the title of the latter not very appealing.
“It’s like they can’t be apart, George,” agreed Fred, pinching Harry’s other cheek. “Adorable, isn’t that right, Ronnie?"
“I can tell.” Sirius was grinning when Harry looked at him again. “So, that's why you left the table? Wanted to open your present in private so no one would see you dumb smile?"
"Such low standards," mused Draco. He then glanced up and pointed at a particular star, then moving to the next and so on. "Do you see it?" he asked when Harry stood next to him, following his line of sight.
“Probably not," said Draco seriously. Then he glanced at Harry and smiled. “I’m not entirely sure of what I’ll do, I’m just waiting for an opportunity."
The last rays of sunshine filtered into the room through the old blue curtains, as Harry contemplated the mess of all his things on the floor. Knowing he would be leaving the Durselys, and this time forever, in a week, he hadn’t bothered to unpack when he first arrived. Yet now that the day had finally come, he found himself restless and, perhaps for the first time in his life, fully emptied his trunk.
“Harry, there you are!” Mrs Weasley came running and pulled him into a hug, her kind smile turning into one of surprise when she pulled back. “Oh, dear,” she said, exchanging a look with Mr Weasley, who just shook his head in amusement.
Malfoy stared at him, at his outstretched palm, and what should have been a casual gesture suddenly felt terribly important. They looked at each other in silence, before the blond slowly reached for him. Harry caught the pale hand in his immediately, feeling surprised at how cold it was, and pulled Malfoy to his feet.
Harry held his hand. “Draco, what’s wrong?"
“Mate, stop smiling like that,” groaned Ron.
Hagrid’s gaze flickered to Draco for a brief second. “Oh, nothing,” he said dismissively. “Just the usual bumps from the job, you know- Malfoy here knows about
"No, I don't," said Zabini gravely. He then threw Harry and the shocked Hermione a wink. "Thankfully, I'm good at keeping secrets."
to date Harry Potter?” asked Kingsley. “That can’t be."
has to happen.” He took in a deep breath. “Draco, I lo-”
"Because-"
Harry descended the stairs behind them, towards the living room where the Floo was located. Mr Weasley was finishing a conversation with Lupin, and turned to smile at his family as they walked in. “Well, it’s been a pleasure to see you, Harry,” he said, giving him a pat on the back. “I’m not sure if I might be able to come back soon, but Ron and Hermione definitely will. Feel free to come by too!”
From what Mr Weasley had explained, he would have to retell the events of the attack in front of the Wizengamot and answer their questions. Harry had asked him if he would have a lawyer, coming to regret it when he had to spend an hour explaining the little he knew about the muggle justice system to an enthusiastic wizard.
“Draco, the Ministry is wrong,” explained Harry softly. “He didn’t do anything they said he did."
Malfoy.
"You know who I am!" protested Ernie, face even redder as he pointed at the badge on the front of his robes. "I'm a Prefect too!"
, and the Room had provided a set of vases, for some reason.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “I obviously don’t plan on telling, but I think it’s better if I don’t sign."
Harry followed his line of sight and felt his stomach turn. The famous ice cream shop looked even worse than Ollivander’s. The front wall was completely gone, replaced by a big hole that let them glimpse into the charred interior of the once colourful shop, and part of the rood had caved in over the small terrace, where years ago Florean had let Harry sit on a table all day to do his homework, even bringing him ice cream every hour.
But Merlin, how badly he wished he could. Ask him about it, and listen to what Draco had wanted to say. To feel those hands cradle his face again, to look into the breathtaking grey eyes and listen to his name out of the other's lips.
Harry nodded, wishing he had a surface to drum his fingers on. He didn’t notice Draco had moved until there was a round package being pressed into his hands.
Nott was held up by a startled Crabbe, who let him go when the boy scrambled to his feet. Instead of hitting Harry back, Nott brought a hand to his bleeding lip and chuckled lowly. “Of course, Draco can’t even fight for himself, needs his boyfriend to-”
Sirius hummed, taking a moment to answer. He gave Harry an odd look. “Maybe you could help me with that once you return."
Harry let himself plop down on the couch face first, groaning into the fabric.
“It’s nothing big,” said Harry, feeling uncertain. “He just mentioned his father bought the new books yesterday."
He walked up the slippery stairs without thinking, which resulted in him running into Malfoy as soon as he crossed the entrance. The other lost his balance, and Harry hastily grabbed his arms to prevent him from falling.
“Well, we are
“Polyjuice Potion?” repeated Draco, now frowning at him.
“No, they aren’t tasty.” Harry scrunched his nose in distaste, his heart fluttering when the blond let out a laugh. He looked at his boyfriend and hummed in consideration. “I could try eating you, though.”
enough."
Harry was definitely not enjoying the pitiful looks he kept getting, nor the mean comments thrown at Draco by the same people. It was truly taking his all not to snap at the next person that did any of those things.
“I see,” said Draco. He looked away briefly, his lips slightly pouty. “Well, I thought we could study together in the library now, but if you are too busy..."
“I’m not showing off,” said Harry in amusement. “I’m just showing you how to do it."
Ron and Hermione were back to normal now, as if nothing had happened, or as if they had forgotten everything. It was nice, so Harry didn’t tell them how wrong it all felt, to not go to the owlery, to not search for grey eyes during meals, or find brief smiles directed at him.
Zabini sighed. "Do you really think he will? He keeps brooding all day." His eyes flickered to Harry’s briefly, and a sly grin grew on his lips. “Pansy, remind me again what he said when you told him you had caught Skeeter?"
mess up." He pointedly looked at Neville. "Work in pairs. You have until the end of period."
Silence stretched again. Across the table, Harry heard how Ron cleared his throat, probably about to attempt to lighten up the mood, but he was beaten by Mundungus.
Either way, Draco had always been very vocal when something annoyed him. “Yes, he would have said more.” Harry’s eyes went to the cage at the corner of the room. “And he wouldn’t have sent Hedwig back without resting.”
“... Guess he’s going that far.” Harry picked his fork to gather some stew.
Draco’s fingers ran through his damp hair, stopping at the base of his head. Harry softly placed his own hands over the pale ones and watched as the blond took a deep breath.
Before Harry could say anything, Lupin cut in. “People can change, Sirius,” said the ex-professor pointedly. “For the better, and the worse. We know that."
, that
Part of his mind was still running like crazy, but the other had stopped to question if Draco would even come by in the near future.
"Do you think he will share?" asked Crabbe, scratching his chin in deep thought. "I see some Peppermint Toads and I really like those."
Mr Weasley frowned. "Sirius," he warned. "We all trust Dumbledore's judgment."
Nott paid her no mind. “Do it, you fucking-”
“Turn over your papers.” His voice had definitely been subjected to a Sonorous to reach the entire Hall, since the man was quite small. “You might begin now.” Just as he finished saying that, there was a massive shuffle of papers as everyone did so.
“You are looking at him."
“Maybe he doesn't want to contact me.” His friends stopped his conversation to look at him, but Harry just shrugged and looked down. “It’s his father, guys, you should have heard Draco talk about him. I mean, you have. If it weren’t for me...”
“It’s just a bit of fun, mate,” said Ron.
He couldn’t help frowning, resenting the blond for single-handedly spoiling his good mood. “Malfoy,” he answered, not really knowing what else to say.
Harry didn’t answer, too busy looking at the Slytherin table, where Draco rested his face in one hand and ignored his friends' attempts to talk to him. He looked so tired, and Harry hated himself for not being able to muster the bravery to run across the Hall, shake him by the shoulders and beg him to change his mind.
“About ten, or so,” sighed Harry.
Hermione and Ron were still awake and stood up from their seats on the couch as he walked into the room, looking equally upset.
"Sorry, Harry," said Neville, looking quite dejected.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry grimaced. “Let’s go in and find Hermione. I’ll tell you both."
Malfoy grinned and extended an arm to the door. “Then let’s do that.”
Ron just kept looking at her as if she were crazy. “You find them attractive?”
“That’s a question,” comes the answer and Harry is tempted to turn around and look at him but he doesn’t. He hears the creak of the bed as Malfoy stands up, probably putting on his trousers now, and then a sigh. “Which you already know the answer to.”
“But?” asked Harry, because he was sensing one there.
“Yes."
The silver eyes widened slightly in surprise since Draco was probably expecting him to just scowl at him, and Harry felt as if he had made one point in their match. Murmurs of admiration ran through the crowd, that had abandoned all pretence and was now openly watching their exchange, but they might as well have disappeared, because at that moment Draco recovered and flashed him another grin.
every day and Harry missed it terribly now. He picked up his letter before his godfather’s prying fingers could reach it and held it close to him. “And no, I wasn’t doing anything.”
“No,” cut in Ron. “I was, Harry. I turned my back on you. And I’m still sorry about that, mate." He turned to the adults. “Harry is my best friend and I trust him. If he is serious about this, we are too."
"And I'm just helping you," said Harry, watching how the wand returned to the dummy. He gave Draco's back a light pat. "Go on."
“There’s no need to react like that, it was only a broomshed,” said Draco, looking at him in amusement, one pale eyebrow raised and white grin still in place. He had clearly noticed Harry’s reaction, but not the cause.
“You knew my mom?”
Remus gave him a sharp look. “Be quiet or be gone, Padfoot,” he said in a low voice that almost sounded like a growl. “The idea is to make Harry feel comfortable so he can share his doubts with us, not tease him.”
The blond shrugged. “Alright, then."
Harry merely smiled and returned to finish his food. He managed another quick glance at Malfoy when Hermione got distracted with Ron's terrible table manners. Parkinson seemed to be trying to comfort him, patting his arm softly, but Malfoy brushed her hand off.
“Or not do!” said Remus, giving Sirius a stern look. "He is
Harry studied him carefully before smiling. “No, it’s fine."
"He didn't do anything," gritted out Harry.
Harry sighed sadly. “So you don’t know. Shame."
Dudley’s eyes went up to the ceiling, confirming Harry’s doubts and making him let out a startled laugh, which seemed to offend his cousin. “Alright,” Harry raised his hands in a sign of peace, crossed his arms and leaned back on his desk. “But I’m probably not the best person to ask.”
“Since first year, Longbottom,” said Draco.
“He- What?” Sirius seemed confused. “So your boyfriend is mad at you and you get mad at me? The fuck did I do?”
and receiving an equally silent
"And we woke up to them snogging in the Hospital Wing," finished Ron. "Quite traumatic."
If there was one word to describe Harry's week, it would have to be
Harry hummed, figuring it wouldn’t be nice of him to say he had no sympathy for Nott. The boy irked him in the wrong way, and there was still the issue of his discussion with Draco. “I’m glad you are okay,” he said honestly.
He gathered his things, his eyes falling to the book he had used. There was something written on the back. “The Half-Blood Prince?” he read aloud. “Weird name.”
Harry looked at him. “
me,” said Draco, raising an eyebrow.
But even that hadn’t looked as more than an argument and Harry had seen them talk after that, as if nothing had happened. And that was odd because, for example, Seamus hadn’t said a word to Harry since the start of the year. Not that Harry had wanted to talk to him either, that is.
But still, it was his birthday and Harry had come to learn how embarrassing that could be. He scratched his neck as he received yet another gift, this time from an enthusiastic Tonks.
“Transfiguration it is,” said Draco, “Then-"
Lupin shook his head. “I’m not trying to justify it, it wasn’t correct. All of us acted badly back then, but a lot of people do when they are young.” He looked at him significantly and Harry
here too?”
"Yeah, scared of hurting you."
. And he is gonna go: Ten points-”
Harry raised an eyebrow. “
Mr Weasley grinned. “Oh, that’s the best part,” he said. “He doesn’t know."
“It’s not-”
Ron groaned. “Stop flirting for a second. Malfoy, did you-?"
“Draco!” called Harry, catching up with him just by the last shop before the end of the village. It was clear that he had rushed, even more when he didn't stop until Harry caught his hand on his. Only then he halted his retreat, and Harry watched as his shoulders rose and fell as if bracing for something before turning to face him.
He presses his back further to the wall and watches as the wolf stops next to him, sniffing the air again before continuing ahead.
And also that one of the tales had been inspired by Linfred of Stinchcombe, so Draco had thought Harry might be interested.
broomshed?”
?" asked Draco coolly.
"I think they might be working for someone that is, so maybe." Harry shrugged, Dementors were the least of his worries right now. "But I'll be fine, I can drive them away."
Ron nodded, then a puzzled expression crossed his face. “You are not dating Hermione, right?”
Harry could only look at him, gulping down the two sets of words that had raced each other up his throat. But neither
brilliant, Scarhead."
“Someone tipped them off on Sirius being in London,” read Ron aloud, then looking at them seriously. “Do you think someone snitched?"
. But it was different now, his heart jumped and kept doing so because it
But that wasn’t the reason Harry started spending more time at the owlery. Not at all. It was just that the owlery was quiet and empty. There were no mocking glances or harsh shoulder shoves. Despite being a freezer, it was a good place to study, or just being alone.
“There’s still a month to go."
," said Draco. "I'm sure Granger is furious, with how complicated it might have been to set it all up. Merlin, she will probably be angry at me as well." He sighed, letting his head fall on Harry's shoulder again. "But I'll have your back, Harry. I owe you one."
Sirius led them upstairs, towards a spacious room Harry knew was called the drawing-room. He was sure that at one point it had been quite luxurious, but now it was as decadent as the rest of the house. They stopped next to a wall, completely covered by a tapestry that, now that Harry examined it closer, turned out to a quite complex family tree.
Harry’s fingers were almost crushed by Draco's hold when Hagrid let out a shrieking cry that echoed through the woods, above the heads of the scared students. Nobody moved or said anything as Hagrid let out a second cry, keeping watch over the carcass.
“Hello,” greeted Luna politely, her radish earring dangling as she smiled at them, friendly and so unlike to the sneer Parkinson sent them.
Seeing Mrs Weasley stiffen, Harry assured her that the article that Skeeter had written after the First Task had been rubbish.
Sirius raised an eyebrow. “Are you
“Enough.”
“Let’s make it fifteen then,” he said, one eyebrow raised as if he had made a question for Harry to answer. There was curiosity on his silver eyes, shiny and captivating.
Lupin remained calm. “No, but he did things that were
Harry isn’t deterred. “You don’t owe him any respect. You shouldn’t feel anything but anger at him. Hatred,” he says, his voice so smooth he is surprised it’s not parseltongue. “Don’t you want vengeance?” he continues but Malfoy isn’t looking at him and Harry opens his mouth, “Draco.”
“Me?” said Hermione. When Lupin nodded, she sat up a bit straighter. “Well, Malfoy has been an awful person to us in the past-"
Before Harry could answer, the bells of the entrance chimed again as another customer walked in the Three Broomsticks. He glanced towards it warily and blinked at the unexpected newcomer.
A blaze of light flew past Nott, making him halt. Harry turned around, finding Draco with his wand clenched on his left hand. “Shut. Up,” he gritted out, wrenching his right arm from Goyle’s hold. His eyes met Harry’s and he turned on his heel.
Harry gritted his teeth as he watched Blaise cough behind his hand, clearly trying to hide his laughter, and then, in the worst act of betrayal ever seen, Ginny pursed her lips and quipped, “Oh, and I hear he’s been named Captain of the Gryffindor Team as well.”
“Wow.”
The day after the task, Harry woke up with a good mood for the first time in a long time. Despite not having wanted to be part of the Tournament, he couldn’t help feeling proud and excited after tying for first place with Viktor Krum, after flying against a dragon.
Malfoy brought a hand to his ear. “I hate bugs.”
“I can’t tell you,” said Harry reluctantly, because if he said he had Occlumency lessons, he would then have to speak about the attack and a lot of other things he wasn’t supposed to talk about. "Sorry."
“She didn’t mean to
“I’ll let him know,” grinned Harry. “I’ll see you later, then."
The man was rubbing his wrist and looking at him carefully. “Did you mean to produce a Stinging Hex?"
Harry’s routine through the next months went back to what it used to be before October; classes, meals, and then the library, Hagrid’s, or just the common room with his friends. He even went to Dumbledore’s office once, and accidentally stumbled upon a Pensieve.
Ron blinked. “No, but-"
But Draco was also cruel and broke the kiss with a grin way before they ran out of air. "I'm trying to learn."
“Shouldn’t you be asking
Malfoy regaled him with a smug grin. "As a matter of fact, Potter, I-" He paused, having noticed something over Harry's shoulder. “Oh, look, Potter. It’s your ginger pet.”
“No, thanks,” said Draco in distaste. “Whatever they are, I bet they are awful.”
Hermine gave Harry an inquisitive look and he nodded. Draco’s odd letter had been eating at his brain and he was honestly dying to talk to her and Ron about it. There really were few things he didn’t share with them.
“Of course,” muttered Skeeter, reaching into her purse to take out her acid green quill. “Then, let’s begin, Harry. Give me the facts, give me the events, give me the names.”
Malfoy looks like he wants to bite him. “Side with him? If this is some attempt to make me join your group of-”
“I don’t want one,” huffed Ron. “But I might want a Nougat. Why is it cheap?"
Harry opened his mouth to tell him that he didn't owe him anything. It hadn't been a favour, and Harry definitely hadn't done it expecting something in return. But he also knew Draco didn't mean it like that. That he had said it more to himself than anything else, perhaps as a way to understand. So he gave in. "You could kiss me," he said, grinning when Draco laughed against his shoulder and then looked up.
“No,” admitted Harry, who would have preferred him to ask for another kiss. “I’ll do it anyway, but why?"
image.” Sirius huffed. “That’s gonna bite him in the ass, mark my words.”
Hermione laughed. "There are worse things than spiders, Ron."
for me."
Ron blinked. “You mean the Aurors? No- I mean, that’s what my dad told me, but I’m sure that if they had found something word would have gotten out. The Prophet is, uh-” His friends scratched that back of his head. “Well, they were all over the trial.”
“What?” he asked, feeling more confused when Sirius started snickering, even more when Tonks joined in and Moody just shook his head.
The only instance the grey eyes had met his had been two days ago, as he and his friends had been crossing the castle on their way to visit Hagrid. They had doubled a corner, Ron complaining about Charms class to Hermione’s irritation, and on the other side of the hall, another trio had doubled a corner at the same time.
“Buy him a
Now was both relieving and painful.
“Tell her it’s not like that, alright?” said Harry. Mrs Weasley was very important to him, and the thought of her thinking badly of Draco was awful. He waited until Lupin nodded, because his idiotic godfather only laughed at him, and then pulled away from the fire.
“Ah!” snapped Moody, his glass eye rotating like crazy. “There is something."
“Perhaps not,” said Mr Weasley, exchanging a look with Kingsley. “But for Lucius to know the booklist before the rest, he must have gotten access somehow. If not through the Board of Governors, then somewhere else."
wouldn’t do that,” said Harry. “His parents don’t know. Last year he was worried about them finding out."
“But not even write to Harry on his birthday?” said Ron sceptically. "His mum must have him under surveillance or something...”
Harry blinked in realisation. “
What they had done wasn’t a bad thing, in any way, but the Malfoys were a well-known family, and to Harry’s dismay, he was well-known too. People would have a field day with the news, and Harry was sure Lucius Malfoy wouldn’t be pleased at all.
“That’s very mature of you,” said Harry with a grin. “Do you even know how to cook, though?”
“Oh,” said Hermione, looking surprised. “Of course, thank you as well."
"Brilliant." Harry smiled at his friends as wide as he could when all he was thinking was that Draco should be there with him.
handsome."
“No, you can’t!” snapped Hermione. “You can’t abuse your power like that!"
“We took care of it,” assured Hermione.
“Of course not.”
“This is about him, isn’t it?”
“I’m not saying you need it, but surely having someone that actually knows what those,” he paused, looking at the book again. He still had no idea what they were supposed to be. “Are those even numbers?"
each other.” Harry smiled at the memory. Those times seemed so far away now. “And that’s putting it mildly.”
“I’ll keep it in mind,” he said.
"Merlin, no," said Ron. "Just one more snake."
Harry stopped walking. “You
Feeling his own eyes starting to burn, Harry hugged him back tightly, shuffling closer between his legs to press them together. “I will have your back,” he whispered against his ear, feeling how Draco shuddered. “I promise, I will do everything I can, you know how I feel about you.”
“Am I wrong?”
“Did you call them chickens?” asked Harry, laughing when Draco glared at him. “How do you approach them the wrong way, then?"
the one that dumped him,” answered another, filled with the same undisguised wonder.
The man’s face fell. “You must be a Gryffindor then, like Lily, these things tend to run in one’s family.”
Umbridge had walked into her class still fuming about Harry’s career advice appointment, where McGonagall and her had gotten into an argument whether Harry would join the Aurors or not, so loud he was starting to think they were more invested in his future than he was. That was certainly worrying for their prospects of success, but Harry’s eyes had searched for Draco while the woman scribbled down on the board and found a reassuring nod, so he relaxed and sat back, being careful not to fall asleep during class as the clock ticked by slowly.
Ron raised an eyebrow at him. “And you didn’t ask?"
“She does that?” Draco raised an eyebrow. “Divination is a rather untrustworthy field, in my opinion. And that woman sounds like a fraud."
Harry already knew that Draco was in his compartment, which
“No real use? They already got twenty-six galleons, Hermione,” said Ron, then grinning. “Plus, I think Harry-"
“He has!” exclaimed Ginny. “He called you a m- he called you
. It had all been there, but Harry hadn’t connected the dots until it was too late to get out.
Harry sighed. "I don't know. Hermione wasn't exactly happy, but I made her swear she wouldn't change a thing on my testimony. Skeeter was happy to see her angry and agreed." He licked his lips nervously and steeled himself to say what he had to say. "Draco, this time I might have been able to do something. But in the future, when the war starts…"
“I know, it’s just-” Harry studied him, a smile growing on his face. “Thank you for being worried about me. Now, and yesterday as well."
“Yeah?” Harry eyed them as Remus sat down on the chair in front of him, while Sirius kept leaning against a wall nearby. “So?”
"The reason I didn't tell Hermione and Ron wasn't shame. That would be ridiculous because you are-" Harry stammered. "You are wonderful."
Blaise Zabini stood next to him, wearing expensive-looking formal robes and an amused expression.
“What do you mean?” Ron blinked at her. “You saw, right? It was right after the match ended.” He frowned when they didn’t answer. “You didn’t see?”
This time, Draco raised an eyebrow at Harry, looking vaguely amused. “Is he now? And just yesterday he was complaining about the lots of things he had to do."
poisonous," hissed Hermione, fixing his finger with a quick flick of her wand.
“I am,” admitted Harry, grinning at him. “Quite a wonderful face."
Harry shrugged. "It will be fine."
“What?”
?” retorted Parkinson, holding Hermione’s surprised gaze. “Do you, Granger?"
“So you could wait outside and just start taking points."
There's an answer then, as the ears of the wolf press down further and it lets out a mournful whimper that tugs at Harry's heart because, even if he doesn't like Malfoy, he would have never wished this for him. "I'm sorry," he says quietly. "I hate you, but this... The Ministry wasn't your fault."
What was Harry supposed to do in this situation? The man before him not only was a supporter of Voldemort, which made him Harry’s enemy, he was also, and this is where things got weird, the father of his
“Are you okay?” asked Harry, standing up.
“We can do it later,” huffed Ron, waving a hand dismissively.
“I’m going to take some air,” said Harry, quickly getting to his feet and fixing his hair.
There was a huff. "Now the toad is affecting me too. Rotten woman."
Harry grimaced. That made him think about Ron. It was true that he had been getting better at playing Keeper, but there were still
“I already spoke to Harry about that,” cut in Lupin calmly. “He knows he can’t tell him anything about The Order."
Harry didn't bother to answer. He made his way out of the owlery and down the treacherous stairs. He wasn't even ten steps down when Malfoy called out to him.
“Sorry, I didn’t mean to sound rude,” said Harry, raising his hand placatingly. “Fay is great, really, it’s just that we don’t talk much outside of practice. So you don’t-”
Harry shrugged. "I could skive off."
“Has he apologized?” asked Lupin, one eyebrow raised. “For anything?"
His words startled Hermione, who blinked rapidly at him before narrowing her eyes. “What is
“What happened?” asked Harry, standing up.
“Hello, you must be Vernon,” greeted Sirius with a sharp smile, not bothering to extend his hand to Harry’s uncle. “I’m Sirius Black, Harry’s godfather,” he added, and Uncle Vernon's face blanched as he recognized him as the deranged psychopath that appeared in the papers almost three years ago.
Draco didn’t even spare them a glance, his silver eyes focused on Harry’s hand. He ran a finger around the scars, frowning when Harry hissed. “Tell me,” he demanded, eyes still down.
Draco chuckled. “No. I just set the old one on fire...along with the broomshed," his voice turned smug, "Got a new one the very next day."
The door to Umbridge’s office opened as quickly as it did the first time, and Harry ran in even quicker, his knees hitting the stone just as the green flames lit up and he yelled the name. His head was across it in a second and he was now looking at the dusty carpet floor of Grimmaul’s Place living room.
thought Harry, in yet another lap around the field. He caught a golden glint hovering near the base of the Slytherin hoops and glanced at Draco, finding him looking at him too, holding his gaze for a microsecond before both of them dived for it.
Harry had totally forgotten about that. He had told Ron he would be back quick, and it had been at least an hour since. “He is going to kill me.”
Fenrir Greyback had a thick neck, a scarred face and teeth as sharp as a knife, and if those things weren't enough to be a warning, then the expression on Remus' face definitely was.
"Then Harry almost died," grimaced Hermione.
. Not only would it plummet morale, but the number of casualties-” Hermione stopped herself and shook her head. “Either way, we should go in already. Remember we have to go to the prefect’s carriage first.”
Harry groaned. “Please, shut up."
Harry stood up, hands clenching by his sides. But before he could do anything the light of the day vanished at once and a cold breeze travelled through the park. The gang looked around, fear on their faces, one of them yelling it was a storm and making the rest scurry away.
Padma and Ron were rushed into the Hall, both of them saying farewells that went unheard by Harry because at that moment his eyes finally rested on their target.
Panic makes Harry raise his hands to push it away, but then confusion takes over because there is no pain, no sharp teeth sinking on his throat and ripping it apart, there's only more sniffs and then a sudden whimper as the wolf backs away.
“I’m not you.”
?” asked Mr Weasley slowly.
“I’m sure we can start the meetings this week, though," he reassured.
When he looked back at Hermione, the girl was giving him a warning look. “Don’t try to snoop in, Harry."
Hermione blinked at him in surprise, first cracking a smile, then letting out a huff, and finally breaking into delighted laughter that filled the Common Room.
was exactly his role as Seeker.
hand, with the fresh scars. "What is
“Parkinson?"
“I think he would have sent you a howler in that case,” huffed Ron, sitting next to Harry as he opened the letter.
Harry dropped the end of his scarf in favour of giving his cousin a cautious look. “What makes you think that?”
“He already signed,” said Hermione with a little smile. “So there’s nothing to worry about."
“I want to hear about both,” said Draco retreating his hand from Harry’s back. “Start with the Egg."
“No, of course,” said Hermione. Ron shook his head and she gasped. “She said yes?”
Sirius looked shocked. “You do?" he repeated and then gave Harry a bright smile when he nodded. "Of course you can-" He paused when Harry hugged him fiercely and his voice turned softer as he patted him in the back, “Of course you can, Harry."
Bothering the blond was perhaps the only fun Harry had those days, but it wasn’t the reason Harry kept going to the owlery, because he was a decent person and that was really immature.
Once they were gone, Mr Weasley took out some files to work on, while next to him, Mrs Weasley chatted with Lupin and Sirius. The latter caught Harry’s eyes and smiled. “Why not show your friends your room?”
Anyways! Hope you liked the chapter! I'll see you on Thursday!
“First, because it
Ron cut in, "We are running out of time." He looked at the four Slytherins. "Is this all of you?" he asked, glancing towards Harry curiously.
“I will, once this thing is over.” Harry sighed, finding himself quite annoyed at Dumbledore. “I just hope it doesn’t take long.”
Malfoy throws his head back against the wall and laughs, a horrible and bitter sound. “Well, I’m not one, and I won’t ever be,” he says out of breath, his eyes falling to Harry’s again in a manner that seems almost intimate. “He won’t give me the Mark, he told me himself. You know why?” Malfoy grins and lowers his head until he can whisper into Harry’s ear. “
It was probably for the best, but it still left a bitter taste in Harry's mouth. In a corner of his mind, and not a small one, Harry knew that they should be talking about the entire thing, but he kept pushing it in favour of simpler things. Like studying at the library and sneaking kisses when no one was around, or practising Defense at the Room of Requirement and stealing kisses because no one was around.
“Didn’t take it,” answered Harry. Tonks and Lupin had taken them back via the Knight Bus because Moody believed that seeing them return on the train after no one had seen them leave in the first place could raise questions. Of course, Harry couldn't say that. "How are you?" he asked while looking at the blond carefully. There was something off about him.
Harry raised his head to look at him. "Why?"
Ron snorted. "I wonder where you got that from.”
“Pansy,” warned Draco, but there was a slight tremble to his voice that made it clear he was trying not to laugh.
Seemingly calmed by his answer, Draco smiled at him. “Open the entire ballroom just for that? No, the drawing-room was enough for us."
Harry wouldn't meet Malfoy at the owlery until after the Yule Ball, which was for the best, because he didn’t think he could face him. Not after his sudden realisation that perhaps he fancied Malfoy a tiny,
“Beats me,” shrugged Harry. Then he smiled at the blond. “Hi.”
“Not that one,” warned a posh voice next to him.
The last time Harry had seen the boy, he had punched him on the nose hard enough to make it bleed, so it was an understatement that they weren’t on friendly terms. Yet, Nott didn’t return the scowl that Harry directed at him, just kept frozen in place like a spotted rat.
Harry felt a pang of alarm at that. Casting a Patronus could be quite draining, even without a Dementor around, since it required a lot of positive energy. He walked a bit closer, studying the other for any signs of exhaustion. “Do you want to sit down?"
“No, not that. I ran into them outside the office and, to make it short, they ended up offering to help me distract Umbridge and didn’t take no for an answer-” Harry paused and frowned. “Wait, did you say gone?”
They listened to him as he retold the memory as it had played on Snape’s mind, not disguising his disgust with what he had seen. When he finished, the men exchanged a look, before Lupin let out a sigh.
“Splinching accident.” The table turned to look at Blaise, who only gave them a grave look. “My former step-father had a fatal splinching accident. It was my mother’s fourth husband who succumbed to a malfunctioning Floo. It was-” Blaise cut himself off, his voice strained when he spoke again. “It was quite painful for us.”
“Professor,” called Draco just as Hagrid turned around, making both him and Harry look at him in surprise. Draco seemed a bit uncomfortable but didn’t look away from Hagrid, he cleared his throat once again and then said rather seriously, “You should know, no one agrees with Umbridge.”
“Yes,” said Harry, “It’s just that you
one,” retorted Fred. “We haven’t done anything wrong."
The twins kept sending amused looks at Harry over dinner, wiggling their eyebrows, making Ron snicker. Harry frowned at him and looked away, his gaze freely wandering towards the table. Harry was glad he wasn’t drinking pumpkin juice because Draco was looking at him. The blond pointed towards the door discreetly and Harry, who had been looking for a chance to talk to him all day, excused himself from the table.
Draco’s head dropped. “Shut up.”
Harry waited a beat, then another two, before standing up too. “I’ll just go check on him,” he said, not looking at Hermione because he was sure she would tell him to respect his privacy or something along the lines.
For the few weeks he had before the Task, Harry would spend his afternoons practising spells with Hermione and Ron, or, unexpectedly, running laps around the school with Krum. The older student had offered to help, through Hermione, but he had also told Harry that he wouldn't make things easier for him.
“It’s fine, we will just go later,” said Draco as he looked around. “Ah,
Harry snorted and broke apart to grin at his godfather. “He says you were quite a talented boy and that he would have wanted you in his House.”
“Then it’s settled,” grinned Sirius, laughing at their uncertain faces. “The Ministry might know where I am, but they don’t know about me being an animagus. If they did, it would be on the front page."
Ron raised an eyebrow. “Be careful or you will end up like Harry.”
“He’s just messing with you,” assured Harry. “Since June." He grinned at Draco, “June 25."
Another howl almost makes him jump, but this one sounds different, less threatening. The creaking starts again, followed by more sniffs, and Harry knows he is about to be discovered.
“You are the one that attacked her,” pointed out Ron. The way his voice tilted in amusement told Harry he was trying to light up the atmosphere, but Draco merely hummed absentmindedly, now studying one of the portraits over the desk with disdain.
“But Draco, your family.” Harry remembered another pair of grey eyes he had seen last night. “Your father-”
As soon as the steps seemed to pass them, Harry peeked around the bush. It was Snape, of course, but he was accompanied by Igor Karkaroff, and they seemed to be in the middle of an argument.
The O.W.Ls were spread in two weeks, with most classes having both a theoretical and practical part. Harry had never seen the student body so tense, not even when Sirius had been spotted on the ground during their third year. And talking about their third year, all students looked as if they had been around a Dementor for too long.
Harry brought a hand to his hair. It was getting quite long. "You might be right about that."
Ron let out a startled laugh. "Oh, did he?" He turned towards Harry with an amused smile. "Are you giving them preferential treatment, Harry?"
“The Dursleys made me do it, so I know a thing or two.” Harry shrugged. “But I haven’t done so since around second year.”
But McGonagall wasn’t there. She had been sent to Saint Mungo's and Harry had run back to the Great Hall, with his mind going a mile per hour trying to find a way to reach Sirius before he was killed.
As soon as Umbridge dismissed the class, Harry left the room with Ron and Hermione, but parted ways with them just outside with the excuse of going to the bathroom and that he would meet them at the Great Hall. Then he went to stand behind a column, carefully out of sigh.
The blond took out two bottles and pressed one into Harry’s hand.
“Shut up,” said Harry, smacking the hand off his shoulder.
Ron had looked as if he had swallowed something bitter. Not angry, and definitely not happy, just troubled. He had told Harry he was an idiot, and that he ought to be mad at him. But he had stayed there next to him and tried to listen.
The Slytherins that had joined the Squad hadn’t helped their reputation with the rest of the Houses, which meant that they were as much a target as Umbridge, perhaps even more. It was fun when the one hit by a curse was, let’s say, Nott, but not when it was one of their...friends?
Harry grinned. “Oh, really?"
Draco blinked at him, face turning pink. “What?"
“Why does this bother you so much, Ron? Harry isn’t nearly as mad about it as you."
Yeah, so you can probably guess what will happen next chapter...
Still, he didn’t think he would use it with the rest. He had come to realize how awfully personal a Patronus could be, and he wouldn’t let just anyone feel it. Draco was definitely alright, and Ron and Hermione would be fine too, but someone like Zacharias Smith?
(See the end of the chapter for
“Did Malfoy just help us?” she whispered.
Draco licked his lips, a frown on his face.
Harry ignored her, just like he ignored the many eyes looking at him through glass planes. All he cared about was ahead, and apparently at the very end of the train because just as they were about to reach the final compartments, Blaise slipped past him and stood on his way.
Harry nodded.
“Ah, it’s Harry,” said Goyle. Harry hadn’t noticed him, just like he hadn’t noticed Theodore Nott, who sat in front of Draco and was now staring at him with wide eyes. But Harry couldn’t even muster the question of
Draco nodded and leaned closer to whisper in his ear. “I could even put you in detention."
, and second, Malfoy would
“Has he been seeing mine?"
Harry didn't answer, too busy looking at the trio walking away, and not noticing the pair of curious brown eyes studying his face.
“My thoughts exactly."
“What is eating it?” yelped Parvati in horror, retreating towards a tree. “What is it?"
“I’m afraid I haven’t been told yet,” said Skeeter, her grin stretching even wider. “Little Miss Perfect here was about to tell me.” She leaned in, a dangerous glint in her eyes. “So Draco, how are you feeling with the news of the breakout? Lestrange is your aunt, isn’t she? How-?”
. But what if he did get expelled? He would never return to Hogwarts, to Ron and Hermione. Nor to Draco.
Ron was in a terrible mood and it all was Viktor Krum’s fault. Harry, being a good friend, didn’t point out that Krum had been Ron’s idol until an hour ago. Instead, he just nodded to every word Ron said, his eyes following after a certain figure on the dance floor.
“What?”
The silence stretched as they looked at each other until music drifted to their ears from a corner of the room, where a gramophone that hadn’t been there before played a record. Harry recognized the tune as one of the many played during the Ball.
Towards the back, a group of Slytherins sat. Parkinson wore a
“You are an
“What are you talking about? asked Hermione, just as the door to the classroom was opened by Snape.
“Yes."
The ghost let out a delighted giggle. “What a weird name! So fancy! And an heir? Oh, Harry, he
“Oh, that’s good,” said Hagrid. “I personally don’t find ‘em as exciting, but- er.” He cleared his throat, waving a hand towards the tavern. “Well, I don’t wanna interrupt your- I’ll just,” he raised his tankard, “you know.”
Harry nodded. He had been a bit offended at the notion that he would say anything in the first place, but Lupin had explained that it wasn’t just a matter of protecting The Order. He could also put Draco in danger.
"If you say so," grinned Draco. "I can only take your word for it." He paused again, looking a bit troubled.
When he did, he spoke slowly. “My father recommended me to get along with Umbridge."
Harry stopped listening, once again looking at Draco. His blond hair gleamed under the sun as he rounded the field, closely followed by an astute Cho.
nail and laughed with his
“I told you I was going to tell you about it,” protested Harry.
Harry shrugged. “I’m still on first place.” Technically, he was tied with Cedric for it, but that didn’t sound as good.
“That is so romantic!"
“Right, yes. Very,” said Malfoy, surprising Harry into looking at him again. As usual, his pale face was flushed red from the cold. Malfoy cleared his throat. “Weren’t you leaving, Potter?”
It didn't work either. “I screwed up, I let every goal in.” Ron let out a sigh and hunched further, his voice was small when he spoke again, “If it weren’t for you we would have lost, Harry."
“Are snakes considered magical creatures?"
“So, what, do you want to stroll in and ask her to use it?” Draco shook his head. “Harry, Dumbledore isn’t here anymore to protect you-”
“Gryffindors. So
Malfoy blinked at him, pale face going pink.
“Okay,” he whispered, pressing the towel into his hands.
. Maybe I ought to punch him as well. What about you, uh?” He gave him a shake. “Want to give him another round? I’ll distract Moony.”
Harry winced at the harsh words. “Ron-”
badge still pinned to her jumper.
“Since when?” pressed Ron.
One look at the Hog’s Head interior was enough to understand why it wasn’t nearly as popular as the Three Broomsticks. The place was small, with a low ceiling and a floor so dirty it was hard to tell what it was made of. '
"You filthy-" muttered Malfoy, face flushed as he angrily fumbled for his wand. Harry panicked and reached out to stop him from hexing Ron, but a sudden loud yell and the blazing light of a spell startled him back.
One second the Hufflepuffs had turned around the corner and the next Draco had been shoved into the nearest room. The blond let out a startled laugh. "What the hell-?" His words halted when he looked at Harry, his grey eyes widening slightly as if surprised.
“Fine.” Ron stood up with a sigh. “But for the record, I could crash here. Harry wouldn’t mind, right?”
It was late when he dragged himself into the common room, his body hurting from the cold of the owlery. He knew he had missed dinner, but hoped that not by too long.
Blood rushing stuff.
Harry let himself plop down on his bed, his hand coming to rest next to the book he had left there. Harry picked it up, once again admiring the blue cover with the drawn Bard.
The idea to check the map had come from a place of desperation, but it had been brilliant. Because Draco Malfoy was on his way to the owlery,
Malfoy pursed his lips at the mention of Ron but didn’t say anything. Instead, he pulled out a parchment from his bag. When Harry didn’t reach to grab it, he rolled his eyes and threw it at him.
of all things
Then, today, he had walked all day with it on his bag, looking for an opportunity to deliver it.
business now, is it, Draco?” retorted Nott harshly. “I’m just telling you-"
“Harry’s a
Hermione looked at him in horror. “That was-”
“Lord Voldemort is aware of your relation, Petunia. Not so long ago, he attempted to use Harry’s closeness to someone against him. It would be wise to expect him to do so again, even if your relationship with your nephew is not a good one in any way.”
Harry studied him. Draco's stance was as aristocratic as him, which was very nice to look at but probably hard to achieve. Duelling required simplicity. Without really thinking, Harry walked around him, fixing what he could.  "Relax your shoulders," he said, placing a hand on his back to correct the posture and using the other to gently raise his arm a bit. "Try again."
Moody nodded, before letting out another roar when the ferret tried to run away. “Oh, I don’t think so!” He brought up his wand again and the ferret flew ten feet up the air before dropping down to the floor and bouncing up again, and again. “Attacking someone with their back turned, you coward, sneaky-”
Harry felt his face heat up as he looked at his friends accusingly.
“I have better things to do with my time than inform myself on the social nature of common creatures."
get in between your education and the opportunities you might have in the future.”
If Draco had wanted, he could have kept quiet and Harry would have still written to him every single day. Instead, he had asked Harry please not to write and then promised to explain...
date. Out of Hogwarts and just the two of them. The last time he had been this close to Draco Malfoy in Hogsmeade, Harry had been under his cloak and dragging him on the snow while the boy screamed in terror. “It is nice,” said Harry sincerely, bumping his knee into Draco’s and smiling. “Maybe next time we could go to the Hog’s Head.”
“Potter,” he muttered bitterly.
“I just got hit with a Jelly-Leg Curse, but Pomfrey refused to let me out of her watch in case I got hit with something else.” Draco sighed. “I got lucky, really. Did you see Pansy’s antlers? She was so upset about them. Vincent didn’t really mind the flippers, but Greg kept scratching his blisters so Pomfrey had to give him a Sleeping Draught.” He looked at another bed further away. “And Theo got hit with a Tongue-Tying curse, quite painful.”
Now the bagel on Harry’s plate looked like the least appetising thing to exist. “Right...” He stood up from the table. “I think I might need another nap. Just a few hours. I don't want to be tired all day.”
Bill looked at her. “You knew?” he asked.
“No,” said Harry gravely. “It was Lucius Malfoy. He recognized him at the platform."
“It’s out, the truth is finally out,” said Hermione as they reached the bottom of the stairs. She gave them a bright smile and the three of them hurried into the Hall.
Harry frowned. "You mean something she can laugh at."
The drawing room was captivating. Even with its tattered wallpaper and unevenly repaired iron chandeliers, it managed to catch Harry’s attention, breath and heart, seize them all in an unforgiving grip and not let go until he
Harry refrained from accepting at that very instant. “Listen, we could at least do the basics, but we have to do them. We can start with-" His words died when Draco leaned in, noses touching as he rested his forehead on Harry’s. There was nowhere to look but him.
“You see, I don’t like when people say that,” said Ron. “It’s sketchy. Just for your information, Smith went really quiet after Diggory intervened. He even signed the list."
“I’m actually just in time,” said Draco, still glancing around the Room until noticing a corner. He pointed at it.  “Is that the famous list?"
“No, you won’t,” agreed Dumbledore. He raised his unharmed hand to knock on the door, but before his knuckles could even brush the wood it was opened in a quick motion, uncovering a taller figure surrounded by the light of the hall.
Harry grimaced. “Quite. Didn’t reach the marks.”
“I know!” snapped Draco, wrenching his hand out of Harry’s grasp in a single move and giving him a heated glare. They stared at each other, Draco cradling his hand in the other as he took a deep breath. “I know,” he repeated in a calmer voice. “I just don’t want to hear it.”
the elf could just be lying again, right? Maybe Black is truly dying right now.”
The four students seemed to share a telepathic conversation via a single look, and after a few moments and short nods, Zabini stepped forward, steps sure and chin raised so elegantly Harry was expecting him to knight someone.
"You-" Malfoy stared at him in bewilderment, mouth agape and face slightly pink from the heat of the cauldron. "You are an
they signed, of course," said Hermione slyly, and the implication made Harry turn towards her with a frown.
“No more book talk,” begged Ron. “Not today."
A shaky breath left Draco, his hand closing in a fist around Harry’s shirt. Harry could picture him clearly, with flushed cheeks, parted lips and closed eyes as he shuddered and panted. The bathroom was starting to feel too warm, and the vague idea of kissing Draco’s skin without the obtrusion of his shirt made Harry bite down perhaps a bit too hard, making the other let out a whimper.
There was a beat of silence. “Please don’t ever say that again," said Harry.
Umbridge was talking to Grubbly-Plank near their table and seemed irritated when the professor praised Hagrid. “Well,
They stayed like that for what could have been either seconds or hours, Harry not really paying attention to time or anything that wasn’t the blond. He only broke out of his daze when the hands stopped, Draco casting the towel aside as he passed his fingers through Harry’s hair, eyes carefully studying it.
Vernon huffed. “If this is a trick to make him stay here for his
“They have been here all night,” explained Harry.
“What do you want, Zabini?” grumbled Ron.
Nott snarled. “Don’t talk to me, you filthy mudblood-”
His boyfriend didn't look convinced. “Then what-" His words halted and his face paled as he came to notice something over Harry's shoulder, and he hastily pulled him out of the cave by an arm.
“You were the best option, Weasley,” snapped Angelina, not letting him get another word out. “I didn’t choose you because of your brothers, or because of your friend, because Merlin knows I don’t care for them."
"You need to sweep him off his feet," said Hermione, looking at him very seriously. "A grand gesture."
of going!”
“We are more likely to have trouble with the Hufflepuff team,” said Harry, remembering what an idiot Zacharias Smith was. “But, the Slytherins will be our bigger threat, as usual. Not only their Seeker is good, but the Beaters hit hard and we just lost ours.”
“Don’t think I will.” Sirius grinned and clapped his hands. “Well, you have to tell me all about your cousin over dinner, but first go leave your jacket and stuff in your room. It’s the same one you slept in last year, but if you don’t like it we can choose another. Kreacher already left your trunk there, but don’t unpack now, I’ll help you later.”
to know the truth and have everyone call me a liar. Not only that toad and Fudge but also the rest of the school."
The Slytherin seemed ready to faint, as the other two started talking details. Harry wondered if it really was that easy to ask someone out. The Ball was only six days away and he still didn’t have a date. McGonagall would kill him if he didn’t manage to get one.
Harry clenched his jaw. “Fine,” he said, taking a step back.
But Hermione kept looking at him, a challenge issued on her clever eyes. And Harry knew he had to act fast.
"You absolute troll," he laughed, giving Harry a light shove. "You could have won first place but
Harry’s good humour vanished. “Shut up."
“Professor Moody!” came a shrill voice, and Harry sagged in relief when McGonagall appeared next to him.
. Let’s just get you a haircut before term starts and you are all set.”
would be useful against-"
The rest of the ride was easier; Harry spent it with his head on Draco’s lap, the blond running fingers through his hair while keeping a conversation with Hermione. It was about the NEWTs, so Harry was all too happy to ignore it, just as he was to ignore the bewildered looks his friends kept throwing at him.
Harry shrugged. “Can’t say, haven’t gone myself.” The Dudleys had always left him home whenever they took Dudley. The only films he had seen were the ones they passed on the TV, and only fragments before his uncle changed the channel or sent him to his cupboard.
Shit. Perhaps Harry should have waited until after the class to say that. He grimaced. “Yeah, sorry, it’s not Remedial anything," he confessed.
“Isn’t that a good thing?” asked Harry, keeping an eye out for Snape. Study Hall was supposed to be for working and, well, studying, and the man was very serious about that.
Fleur’s hair appeared to glow silver, while Draco’s was white blond. There. Big difference. “I just don’t see any reason to gang up on her,” he said instead. “She seems nice.”
“Harry,” said Luna after a moment of silence, looking up from a copy of the Quibbler she had taken out of her trunk. “Are we continuing with the D.A?”
” he said, looking concerned.

into the Ministry.”
Harry smiled. “I’ll show you one day."
“Are you perhaps a Slytherin, professor?”
“The boy can’t know much, Mad-Eye,” said Lupin with a slight frown. “He’s too young."
Snape’s class pet, Harry looked up towards the man in question. He had to bite his lip to refrain from snickering because Snape was looking at them with clear confusion. Harry looked away before the man noticed his grin and came to yell at him.
“In case you have forgotten, I detest Malfoy too,” said Hermione, looking annoyed.
Hedwig fluttered her wings but chirped again in what sounded like alarm, her yellow eyes fixed on a window. Harry rushed to it, narrowing his eyes until he distinguished a familiar figure sliding the air towards him and he opened it.
"Next week? Why- It's Valentines, isn't it?"
“Sirius, is Buckbeak here?" he asked, already knowing and hating the answer.
with Slughorn when he had something way more important to do.
thought Harry, then scrunching his nose.
thought Harry, looking at the old furniture.
“Well, well, Patronus Potter,” said Lucius coolly, his grey eyes studying him carefully. They were the same shade as Draco’s, but somehow completely different. “The Minister was just telling me about your lucky
"Poor Harry…"
"Sod off, Malfoy," said Seamus.
All eyes were on Draco, whose own were still fixed on the fireplace where Kreacher kept whimpering. “Kreacher had to keep Master away from the fireplace,” said the elf miserably. His big eyes were teary and his long nose wet. “So Potter couldn’t reach him-” The elf hiccuped and broke into a devastated wail. “Kreacher has failed! Kreacher has failed the Masters! Kreacher has failed the House of Black!”
“What does that even mean?”
Harry nodded and stood up, trying to not convey how eager he was to leave the table. Ron and Hermione were already following after him, but he turned on the door to look at the table again, where Ginny kept seated. “You are not coming?” he asked.
Ron snorted. “And she got mad at you, and called you careless.”
They sat down on a stone bench, Harry casting a warming charm over the both of them when he noticed the pink flush on Malfoy’s pale face. He seemed very sensible to the cold. The blond gave him an easy smile and proceeded to tell Harry that he had been confusing the terms of the textbook, and that he had to rewrite his whole essay. One hour later, Harry smiled down at his finished work as Malfoy got ready to leave.
Nott, Crabbe and Goyle leaned on the fences, the latter holding a copy of the Daily Prophet under his arm. Draco and Zabini watched over them, the latter with an air of aloofness.
Thank you for reading! As usual, the comments are very much appreciated! Hope you liked it and see you next time!
When he walks into the room, Malfoy is sitting on the bed, Harry’s jacket over his lap and arms crossed over his chest. He looks at Harry with wariness and snatches the robes off his hands when he offers them. “What are you doing here, Potter?” he asks while he puts on his shirt.
“Harry!”
"Now," he said, already turning away.
refused to tell me why before, so you must know.”
Ron snorted, immediately trying to hide it as a cough, but Snape noticed and looked towards their table. Harry saw him frown, eyes travelling to the other corner of the room, where Umbridge was now talking with Parkinson, and then back to them, narrowing in suspicion when they met Harry’s.
” he whispered, and then he dropped the pin on the bed and cupped Harry’s face, crashing their lips together.
Hermione put her hands on his shoulders. "Harry, if someone can find a way to overcome all this, it's you" she smiled. "With our help, of course."
“Viktor recommended it to me ” answered Hermione, without looking up. “I figured I would give it a try. So far it’s quite good.”
“That’s enough!” Nott’s outburst managed to drag the attention of the room away from the pair and towards him. Harry had never heard him raise his voice like that, or seen him so furious. “Not another word, Draco.”
Perhaps, a little too pleasant.
Draco finally met his eyes. "No. Harry, you don't understand, my family-"
His friends shared a glance as if disbelieving. “And Malfoy told you?" asked Ron.
If Umbridge’s job under Fudge wasn’t enough to mark her as bad news, the way she interrupted Dumbledore’s speech definitely was. Harry, Ron and Hermione gaped, and a glance at the Slytherin table showed both Draco and Parkinson exchanging an amused glance, the latter holding a hand to her mouth as if shocked.
“In your dreams, Malfoy.” Harry snorted when Draco glared at him, before leaning in to kiss him slowly, enjoying the sensation. “In your dreams,” he murmured against his lips, feeling the air that left Draco when he huffed and then the hand that reached for his face.
He had just signed his name at the bottom of the parchment when the slow steps of someone carefully walking up the stairs reached his ears. Panicking a bit, because he
Instead, he hurried and made the message change.
Draco grinned at him. “Exactly. Now, let’s get going at once. We should start with Transfiguration or History, I’ll let you pick."
“He ought to be more careful with the things he says,” stated Malfoy.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “
“That’s fine,” said Draco with a shrug. “I’m sure you have plans with the weas- with your friends.”
Harry thought about Grimmauld Place again. “Any interesting things there?"
His voice went softer, as if whispering, and Harry moved some books to spy between them. Parkinson's back was to Harry, as she studied the shelf before her, hands pulling out books and stuffing them back. But Zabini, who had leaned closer to talk to her, was fully facing him, and his dark eyes caught Harry’s behind the shelf. Harry stepped back, knowing he had been found, and expecting Parkinson to come from around the shelf and rip his head off.
“I heard it was Malfoy
"That man is an absolute lunatic," muttered Draco. "What was Dumbledore thinking when he hired him?"
The kiss broke as Draco took a sharp intake of breath, as if pained, and then he and Harry were looking at each other, equally out of breath, faces red and messy lips. Under his grey gaze, Harry shifted in place nervously and Draco let out a groan, closing his eyes just for a second and letting his head fall against the wall. "Harry," he said, voice strained as his hands fell to Harry's shoulders. "You are- your leg-"
badge from his pocket and, after looking around, placed it on the dark brown nightstand next to the bed.
“Dumbledore was there,” commented Harry. The Headmaster had ignored his attempts to talk to him, and that bothered him quite a lot. But knowing that he was cleared to return to Hogwarts made it impossible to feel angry at the moment.
Ron reddened. “Shut up."
Ginny snorted from the armchair she had perched on. “Never heard that from you before. Which one is it?”
“Seventh,” said Blaise.
Hotel? Trivago
Draco shoved him back. “I don’t want your apologies nor need your pity!” he hissed. “You don’t care about my father-!”
came a dreadful cough.
Harry reeled back. Parkinson had never been this hostile towards him directly. Harry found himself annoyed by the girl, so, with a last worried glance at Malfoy, he turned back to his friends.
“I mean, she is not wrong,” came a hesitant voice, making everyone turn towards it.
“I know,” sighed Harry, he couldn’t risk Sirius being caught. An idea crossed his mind. “Draco, what about
Harry wanted to kick the man’s chair and break the many objects around, but instead he took a deep breath and clenched his jaw. “What else are you not telling me? About the Ministry, about this year?”
to share her magazine with someone else."
The blond listened carefully, and let out a surprised laugh. “I wasn’t expecting that. I’m going to need names.”
“What?!” he and Sirius said at the same time, and Dumbledore gave them both an amused look.
Cepheus glided in and perched over a chair. His big orange eyes stared at Harry as he approached to grab the letter on his beak and once it was safe on his hands, Cepheus gave him a light peck on a finger, fluttered his wings and left as quickly as he came, not eating any treat, nor taking a moment to rest, nor waiting for a letter in reply.
thinks Harry, moving to slip into the hall the wolf had come from. He feels victorious, taking steps that don't creak down the hall, but then he looks over his shoulder.
“Stop apologizing for things you haven’t done, Scarhead.” Draco sighed. “I’ll tell Pomfrey. She won’t run to Umbridge but knowing what happened to him will help her cure him,” he said, and then kissed Harry again. “Thank you. Now leave.”
Harry listened to them until a hand was placed on his shoulder, startling him. Harry looked up to find Sirius standing by him and found his good mood souring again.
Harry smiled. “Just with the points, really, neither he nor the others are giving much detention, so what’s the damage?” No one was getting hurt, and there were bigger things to worry about than the House Cup.
“No comment,” said Draco, earning himself a kick on the shin by Parkinson. He scowled at her. “
“Had things to do,” answered Harry, hastily bundling his cloak and storing it in his trunk before grabbing his formal clothes and running to the bathroom.
“- now, do you know everyone, Harry?” Slughorn was smiling at him. “Of course, Blaise is in your year so you must have seen each other.”
“It’s
“Shut up,” said Harry, shoving him back.
“Of course it’s not what I want, you idiot!” snapped Draco, his teeth bared in anger even as he circled his arms around his neck. Harry sagged in relief as the blond kept speaking in his ear, “I don’t want to, I really don’t want to.”
“No! Master Draco, don’t ask Kreacher!” The elf was on the verge of tears, his voice trembling noticeably. “The half-blood will hear! It’s against Miss Cissy’s orders, against Master Lucius’ orders-”
"I told you we should have told them earlier," muttered Hermione.
her."
"That's brilliant," said Harry. "Who?"
“I’m not
because at Goyle’s words Draco snapped his gaze off the window and met his eyes.
Draco had raised an eyebrow. “If you are not fighting with the Defense professor of that year, that is,” he had said, dropping the lovage leaves into his cauldron.
Dating someone in secret, Harry had discovered, could be as thrilling as a Quidditch match; Racing after the elusive snitch, ducking under bludgers, doing a sharp turn on your broom, sharing a glance across the corridors, flashing a grin when no one is looking, the teasing words with many meanings and the hidden meeting spots.
As usual, there were magical creatures, unicorns standing behind wooden fences, but there was no sign of Hagrid, his spot taken by an elderly witch with short grey hair.
’ thought Harry, then wondering if he had said it aloud because Angelina suddenly turned towards him with a sharp look.
you.” The blond bristled in anger. “You have to tell your Head of House- No, you have to tell Dumbledore."
Sirius laughed. “Well, well," he shoved Harry playfully, “Look at you, all smitten with a boy. James would have-" He paused, voice low when he spoke again. “He would have teased you a lot, Lily too."
Draco hummed. “Can’t say I disagree."
“Of course I did, but he said it was just homework,” said Harry, thinking about the way the blond had frowned down at the many books he had skimmed through.
But did he really want that for him? Sirius hadn't spoken much of his family, only enough for Harry to know he had grown strained from it, but whenever he did talk about it, it was with bitterness and hatred.
“He is back!” insisted Harry, the rush of the events making him raise his voice. “The Cup was a portkey, and-”
“Hurry up, Potter. You don’t want to leave your
"Not exactly," said Harry and Draco dropped his grin, perhaps having taken on his somewhat heavier tone. "I mean, yes, it's fun to trick them, but it's not just because of that, no."
“You might be right about that,” said Lupin, carefully studying him. Then he looked at Hermione. “What do you think?"
Harry wasn’t very happy with Seamus at the moment, and maybe that was the reason he finally snapped and stood up. “No!" Everyone blinked at him. “You can’t tell anyone, not a teacher, no students, no one. And no
He smiled. “I told you, it’s nothing big."
doesn’t look the type to go around getting in trouble, like you three."
Angelina raised an eyebrow. “Doesn’t he always?"
"Detention the whole week."
Malfoy walked in, face flushed red by the biting cold. And Harry had to clench his fist in order to refrain from smacking himself because for a minimal second he had noted that it wasn't an entirely bad look on the blond.
Harry considered the words. Fred and George always played by their own rules. He wasn’t sure what they were planning, but it was probably good. “They did mention that they had been preparing it for a while.”
Everyone looked at him.
"You have regained your status as Golden Boy, perhaps even more loved now than before. Meanwhile," Draco looked away, "my name couldn't have sunk lower than this."
A sudden fake cough startled them apart, and Harry felt his face heat up, as he looked away from Draco and towards his now awake friends. Ron looked extremely uncomfortable, and Hermione's eyes were wide. Her hand was over her mouth, her eyes flickering between Ron and Draco’s startled faces, and Harry realized she was trying not to laugh.
“How chivalrous, Potter.”
Harry looked up again. “You think?” he asked with a looped smile. He knew Draco was teasing him, but sometimes playing along was better.
. Malfoy and his little gang-”
“Really?” said Draco, a smirk growing on his face. “Because you just moved that pawn, when you should have moved your bishop.”
“He didn’t say,” shrugged Draco. “But he is not one to make such requirements, so there must be a reason. Considering she got crowned as High Inquisitor, I believe her influence will just keep growing from now on."
“So stubborn,” mused Draco, reaching to cup his face with a hand. He sighed. “Stubborn git. I can only ask you to be cautious. You know the toad is going to be sniffing over your shoulder."
Hermione read the letter in an almost professional way, and would have looked indifferent if it weren’t for the slight fall of the corners of her mouth. “This was right before the trial, and I can tell he is worried about the trial, and guilty, and sad, and he also misses you-”
