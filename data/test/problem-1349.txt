"That was Blaise in the picture. You know, one of my best friends," I said.
"Why?" Scorpius demanded, wriggling out of my grip and stomping his way over to Harry, crossing his arms across his chest as he looks up at the man.
Although the wine was quite cheap, it had always been one of my favorites. Taking a long swig, I turned to the annoying red-head sitting at my table.
"I need a place to stay, I thought Harry lived here," She said, sending a glance to Harry. Harry's eyebrows scrunched.
"Don't think about being tired, we may be in our forties but don't think for a second that I'm not going to bend you over the counter when we get home," I just barely suppressed a whimper at that.
"I'm so glad I didn't miss it. Where's Harry?" She asked me, running her fingers through my hair. I tried to shrug but was hit with another contraction.
The late-October air was cold and I let out a content sigh as we arrived at the muggle supermarket. Grabbing a trolley, I sat James in the leg-hole closure and strapped him in as Teddy looked at the temporary tattoo machine.
"I was so terrified when it was time,"
"Yes," I said. She nodded for me to proceed.
I sat all the plates down with some toast and bacon and watched as they all dug in. It seemed to be in slow motion.
Staring at the vase on the floor and Ginerva's surprised expression, I came to an easy conclusion. Harry let out a burst of accidental magic.
"Merlin's sake, she looks like a bloody goldfish," I whispered to Hermione, who had to use her hand to hide a snicker.
Of course, no matter how sad everyone was, classes still must go on.
"Oh, it was only 15 minutes early, darling, you aren't going to die," Draco said, looking at his daughter with a hand on his hip and Teddy retreated into the kitchen.
"Oh?" I hear Harry say from outside. I nod before remembering he can't see me.
"How far along are you?" Hermione said, sinking down beside me and giving me a huge smile. I remembered the same talk when I was carrying James.
They walked in and took a seat, Remus - who had just come from his chambers where Sirius lay - walked into the room, his face puffy from crying.
"Hi, lovelies!" She greets, handing me James.
After a few moments of just breathing together, Dracona helped Hailee take off the strap-on, haphazardly throwing it onto the floor beside the bed and snuggling into Hailee while the taller girl whispered a quiet
You may not understand this with your little cashew-sized brain but I am, technically, a Black. Not to mention, Harry now owns this house, and the contract we signed six
"Love you too," I mumble back, turning my head to tuck it into his neck, pressing a kiss under his ear. I don't remember falling asleep but, at some point, I do.
"Wanna ride me, baby? Or do you wanna take it?" Hailee asked, watching Malfoy slide down her legs, leaving room for Hailee to strap on the false dick.
The kitchen was closer to the front door than the living room so I was happy that Teddy didn't have to walk past Ginerva and Harry fighting.
While having him, my healer had said "Congrats, it's a girl!" I'd looked at them and said "No, it's a boy,".
"Good," Pant, "grief," another pant. Harry is inhaling tons of oxygen in quick breaths while Draco is taking large, long breaths.
"Draco, are you alright, love?"
I stared at the St. Mungo's issued pregnancy-test that I held with shakey hands. A plus sign.
Ginerva rolled her eyes before huffing and turning around, making her way back into the living room. I rolled my eyes and heard Hermione sigh.
"And you also, unknowingly, walked out on your child," I said, another hit to his shoulders.
"Did Mumma put you down for a nap?" He asked. Laura nodded.
"You two play nice, now. I'll call you for dinner, love," I told them, running my fingers through Teddy's hair. It flashed platinum blond and I smiled at him.
But my mother came running in.
"I'm fine," I hoped he didn't notice the way my voice cracked or the quiet
Four hours later, my prince charming hadn't charmed his fucking way into my hospital room. The contractions were getting worse and worse and I was positive I'd broken my mother's hand with how hard I had been squeezing it.
"STOP, MUMMA!" He begged as Draco tickled his sides. Harry lifted Laura upon his hip and kissed the top of her head, letting her lie her head on his shoulder. To this day, Harry's children were his pride and joy and he wouldn't trade them for the world.
All throughout dinner, she'd rudely turned down everything I offered her (except for one time when Harry snapped for her to
Hailee was happy to find that she, too, could sleep.
I nodded slowly. He wasn't upset or mad. Then, when he stuck his hand out to shake Scorp's, I realized why.
"I'll take the spell down if you promise to sit with us as a big girl and act like a proper grown-up," I realized with a start that this was why Harry and Ron were always so afraid of Hermione Granger-
It was the picture I had thrown the day I left. It was in a new frame and the background was somewhat erased, focusing on Harry and I instead.
"What the bloody hell is going on here?" I snap, watching Teddy run to Harry, lifting his hands in a demand to be lifted. Harry's expression lightened immediately and he lifted our son, smiling at the teal-haired boy.
"Um, yeah, sure, give me like, 5 minutes," Harry hummed in response and I sighed as I heard his footsteps getting farther away.
"So this is for you, Dad and Pops," He said. "I love you guys so much," I flicked my hand at him, seemingly brushing him off but in reality, I didn't want everyone in the Manor's ballroom to see me explode into tears.
"This is actually Harry's house," She said. I could feel my magic flicker and I quickly sat James down in the play-pen we kept in the living room. He'd fallen back asleep, anyway.
"Yes, brilliant! Point that thing at a legal practitioner in front of an officer of the law, I'm sure that will go down well for you," I hissed, my eyes narrowing with every word.
"Of course," He responds, gesturing for me to come up. I crawl up his body until he's lying on his left side with me facing him on my right. His right hand comes up and cups my cheek, bringing me in for a tender kiss.
"Out," I hiss before her horrid lipstick-covered lips can open. She scoffs but walks to the floo, and before long, she's gone with a whirl of green-flames.
Seven long years down the drain from three cruel words.
Turning to Hermione, the brown-haired woman shook her head.
Hailee is met with those striking silver eyes and she momentarily forgets that they are only fuck-buddies. They are full of sleep and her pupils are large, asking for light that the night doesn't give. Hailee tilts her head sideways as Malfoy brings her hand up to move the raven hair out of her face. She then cups Hailee's face with the same hand before softly bringing her head down to kiss the tan girl below her.
"Well, how would you react if I, hypothetically, of course, wanted another kid?"
"I don't care," He said simply, tugging me back into him. I sighed but allowed it.
I hadn't been called something like that in almost seven years.
"You know it's the right thing to do," She whispered in my ear. I nodded.
"Can we start over, amour? Will you let me treat you right this time?" he asked. His green eyes that I hadn't seen in so long were filled with hope. I wanted to say yes but, truth be told, I was horrified. I had to tell him about Scorpius and if he got upset... I couldn't take another heartbreak.
"Hey, Haz," Draco cried. His voice was cracky and small as millions of memories went through his mind.
His mum had bubblegum pink hair and every so often sprouted a pig nose. His dad held up chocolate as if to hold it to a toast, then would nibble a bite of it off.
"We..?"
doing here," I don't need to turn around to identify who the voice comes from. Rolling my eyes, I turn to be met with Weaslette. Her arms are crossed over her chest, face clear with distaste. I sigh softly, grabbing James when Mother hands him to me.
Xoxo, Tiffany
Weaslette turned her nose up and huffed. I was panting softly now, my knees feeling somewhat weak as I basically crushed all my weigh over Harry. He held me throughout it all, summoning Weaslette's suitcase wandlessly with a quiet whisper of an incantation I didn't hear because I couldn't hear anything over Weaslette's voice ringing in my ears.
Ten minutes later found us all sitting around the table with a nice helping of homemade pumpkin pie (thank you, Molly Weasley, you're the best mother-in-law) and a nice sized glass of Sherry.
I sat in front of the Wizengamont nervously. I had nothing against Harry but I wasn't going to go down without a fight this time. This was about Scorpius. My baby.
"I love you and I love our kids and I love that you love that I'm pregnant," This is spoken into Harry's neck, who moves his head to press a kiss to Draco's temple, pausing there for a moment before pulling away.
"Do you remember when we sent the boys to Mother's after a fight with Weasley last week..?" Draco watched as Harry's cheeks flushed lightly with the memory of last Monday, the way Draco had felt around him, squeezing around him as they came.
"Oh, goodbye, giggles," She said. Giggles had been Mother's nickname for Scorpius since the day he was born.
"I've missed you," He says, hugging me tightly. I was crying now, holding him so tight I was scared I might hurt him.
"I'm sorry," He mumbled, looking down guiltily.
Ginny glared at her. I had to bite the insides of my cheeks to keep from laughing. I slithered my arm underneath Harry's and leaned onto his shoulder.
I hope you enjoyed this book! Thanks so much for reading <3
"What time, darling?" She asked me.
"I know, baby, daddy isn't going anywhere,".
The silence that followed after was deafening. At some point, Draco closed his eyes shut, tight.
Draco wiped a tear off his cheek as he held his oldest son to him, kissing the side of his head.
"Oh - my -
"I... I never got my tattoo removed," He said. He whispered it, but due to the silence, everyone heard him. My breathing hitched.
"Well, Harry should've been able to meet Scorpius earlier. Let him know I'm sorry too, will you? And I'll bring Scorpius to his flat so he doesn't have to worry about meeting anywhere," Granger wasn't looking at me, rather behind me.
"Alright," He calls.
And she kissed him square on the mouth.
The pit in my stomach simply grew larger and larger as the house got bigger and bigger. I tightened my hold on James, who sat on my hip, fisting his chubby little hands into my hair. I felt Harry squeeze my hand that was interlaced with mine and I smiled.
I rushed over to him. Narcissa stood up and walked to the side of the room. I cupped Draco's face with one hand, and used the other to grab his hand. He squeezed at my hand tightly.
"But I'm not done having my snack," He pouts and my hips thrust on their own accord.
"How can you bring another man into Scorpius' life when
"That's a brilliant idea, Mother, why don't you and Molly here go finish the roast a-and Hermione and I can set the table," I said, nodding quickly, sending a pair of, what I hoped was, pleading eyes at my husband, who nodded and led a very stiff Mother to the kitchen, her eyes locked on a still sulking Ginerva Weasley.
"Look," I whispered to him. He sobbed into his fist.
"C'mon, let's get you to the floo!" She said, letting me lean on her as we made our way downstairs.
Promptly walking past her, I walked over to the coffee table to pick up Harry and I's empty teacups and Ginerva's full one. As I lifted the tray, a jolt of pain made its way through my body and I dropped the silver, making the contents to scatter out over the carpet.
Gods, I hated Ginerva Weasley.
"Good morning, Mummy!" I gave a good morning back to her and wondered how she was a morning person because she sure as hell couldn't have gotten it from me and, looking at Harry's dark circles and groggy mumbles, she didn't get it from him either.
"We totally are, now get your girl," he said. Ginny threw her head back and laughed.
And she held the fucking baby bag.
When we arrived in the kitchen, Teddy had already sat both of his bags on the kitchen table and looked at me expectantly. I heard a crash from the living room and pulled a face.
Draco walked into the room exactly 7 seconds later, making Blaise look up, his sobs faltering.
"Harry, if another child squeezes its way out of me, I won't be able to get my body back a fourth time!" Harry remembered Draco's argument. It led to, protected, sex on their bed which led to sex in the shower which led to Draco being horrified that he was pregnant again when in fact he had a cold.
Harry cooed.
"No!" He screamed as he ran down the stairs, running to the courtyard that he knew Harry's dead body would lay. He caught the attention of Hermione, Draco, Ginny, Luna, Neville, and McGonagall as he ran, screaming the word 'NO' over and over again at the top of his lungs and they began to run with him.
"So, Ginerva, I hope you like spaghetti because Thursdays are spaghetti night and-"
I smiled at him, looking at his jet black hair and silver eyes. His skin was tan like Harry's and I remembered the day he was born like yesterday.
Domestic bliss <3
"Mornin'," He mumbled above me. I hummed in response, kissing his collarbone before sliding out of bed and walking to our walk-in closet.
Teddy had only been 4, hardly talking well. Draco remembered getting an ultrasound at St. Mungos, getting a picture of the krup-sized blob that had been James. After Draco and Harry explained what the picture was, Teddy had demanded he was to have it in his possession, and, to this day, he always had the ultrasound picture in his pocket.
"Y-you're?" Draco smiled widely and nodded, laughing slightly. Harry dropped his briefcase and ran over to Draco, lifting him off the ground and spinning him around.
"Harry P-Potter took his life late last night, please have respect for his loved ones. The funeral will be held on Tuesday. Everyone is allowed to come," McGonagall stepped down from the podium.
"LISTEN!" I screamed. He slammed the door in my face. I banged my fists on the door.
Pansy walked over to Draco, picking up the blond head and sitting on her lap as she sat down. She rubbed the halo while tears rolled down her face.
Draco had given Laura the pink shirt and handed Teddy the blue one as the kids ran over to the fireplace, where Harry flooed in.
"It's fine," She said again.
Luna wasn't rubbing her back to calm her girlfriend down.
Making sure the baby monitor was set up correctly, I quietly made my way out of the room.
"How could you do that?" She snaps at Harry.
"Oh?" He taunts, unbuttoning the button on my jeans and undoing the zipper before yanking them off my legs, throwing them somewhere out of my peripheral vision.
"Aunt 'Mione!" Hermione coos and hands Rose to her husband, pulling James into her arms with a sloppy kiss to his cheek, making the toddler giggle.
He claimed the stairs, slower than usual. He took in everything. Finally, he reached the top. He opened the oak door leading him to the opening of the tower. He closed the door behind him, sighing. His breath caught in his throat as he heard Ron's voice as the freckled boy walked up the stairs. The raven quickly ran and locked the door.
And Harry had spelled it to be sure he never lost it.
"Harry-"
"Harry," I said, walking over to him, where he stood fuming at Ginerva Weasley.
"Daddy~" Scorpius groaned from the door, "Come onnnn," I turned to him and shook my head, basking in the laugh that Harry gave off.
After having Jonah, Draco got pregnant again and had Maisie. He put his foot down after Maisie, refusing to have any more children.
He sighed and kissed me before backing away, grabbing his duffel bag off the floor. I stalked over to him, trying to hold him back. He shook me off.
Teddy, now in his last year, watched his little sister approach the sorting hat. Laura smiled at her from Slytherin table and Jonah held a thumbs up from Gryffindor. Maisie smiled at Teddy, then walked up to the hat.
I wound both arms around his neck and pulled him down to kiss my lips. Our lips met and, before long, his tongue was prodding its way in, finding mine quickly. Our tongues interlocked, our lips moving in a dance only we knew.
I whipped around to where Ginerva held her wand, the tip pointed straight at me.
"How much does Harry pay you?" She said, kicking one leg over the other.
"Mother!" I gasped. She let out a releaved sigh and rushed over to me, hugging me tightly.
"'Mione, the baby is coming and Harry isn't picking up," I said frantically, running around the house, trying to grab his baby bag but where in Merlin's saggy balls did Harry put it?
"Scorpius," I said, looking at him. I looked back up to Granger.
I walked downstairs and to the kitchen. I flicked on the kettle and grabbed 9 eggs from the fridge. Thankfully, all our kids like their eggs the same; scrambled with cheddar cheese. That was easy enough and just as I separated them onto 5 plates, Teddy was flopping his way down the stairs, James following not far behind.
"Do tell, what is the matter at hand?" It was Charlie now, eyes squinting at her dangerously.
"FUCK!" Malfoy screamed, using her hands to lift her hairless legs onto Hailee's shoulders. Hailee smiled down at her, smirked more like it.
It was James.
"See you later," I whispered. Harry nodded and gave me a kiss on my head before I spun around, making my way to the door and my impatient son.
"I bet Scorp calls him dad, doesn't he?" He said in pain.
"Looks like Teddy's photo collection is going to grow," Harry said, causing Draco to throw his head back and howl with laughter. He didn't know why he found the statement so funny, but he did.
Tears began streaming down my cheeks at a rapid pace. I could feel the salty wettness on my tongue.
Then, she flicked a clump of poorly-treated ginger hair over her shoulder and crossed her arms.
"Because I want to ride you into the fucking sunset," I say simply as I feel my knees his the foot of our bed. A devious smirk comes across his face and I send one right back. He pushes me back onto the bed, crawling on top of me.
"Hello, handsome," I greet him with a smile as he gives me a grin back, fisting his chubby little hands into my hair. I kissed his cheeks and he gave a slobbery little giggle. Following Harry into the house, we sat down on one of the many couches in the living room of The Burrow.
With that, i gave Scorpius a last sloppy kiss and the cheek, and left, making my way to Harry's flat.
"Babe-"
"Don't cry, Daddy," Scorpius said, wrapping his arms around my shoulders to hug me. I close my eyes tight and hold him even tighter.
"Yes, Ginerva?" I said, whipping imaginary dust on my pants, turning to be met with the scowling ginger.
"Well..." Draco looked away, his eyes settling on a picture of all four of them that sat on their dresser. It was a magical picture that had been taken at James' second birthday party. Draco watched as picture-Harry leaned over to kiss Draco, who smiled throughout the kiss as Teddy giggled at Draco's feet about something or other.
He hisses out more and more things in Parsletongue and I feel his hand fist into my hair. Soon, he's pulling me off his cock and bringing me up to kiss him sloppily. I feel a lubed finger prod at my entrance and I let out a moan.
"Yeah, just bloody peachy," I snapped. Hermione sucked in a breath of air.
And this is the end of our Hold On series.
"How can we help you, Ginerva?" I asked her kindly, wiping my hands on a dishtowel left next to the sink for that reason. She visibly cringed.
"Her arse will be as red as her hair," I said jokingly, causing Harry to let out one of those hearty laughs that warmed me to the bone. He moved his hand down to stroke the side of my face. I smiled at him.
The yelling was paused due to a crash. I walked into the room and cast a
"Fuck, Draco," Harry fists his hands into the sheets as he fights to arch his back. I pull away and swirl my tongue around the tip.
A chill of horror crept up my spine as everything began to go in slow motion. I could see it all happen as if it happened slowly.
"I love you," I said, "I never stopped. I kept trying to go back to you but you know what stopped me? Scorpius," I said. His face contorted into one of confusion as he looked at me.
"I'm not daft, Malfoy, I would've figured it out," She said, smirking smugly.
Her mouth still opened, Ginny slowly walked to the door and, with last longing look at my husband, she was gone.
"Do you remember how we told Teddy you were pregnant with James?" Harry asks, blinking slowly. Draco lets out a huff of laughter, nodding softly.
"Fuck, where did you come from?" Harry jumped, obviously startled. I couldn't help but laugh, rubbing my hand up and down his arm to calm him down. He cleared his throat awkwardly. I snapped my hand away, rubbing the back of my neck.
Using a wet paper towel, I cleaned off James' face before unhooking the high chair and lifting him into my arms. I felt his fingers twist their way back into my hair as I made my way to the living room.
"How could I miss it?" I asked him.
"Otay!" He said, putting his arms out for Hermione, already babbling. She smiled, taking him into her arms. She mouthed a thank you at me and I shrugged, turning back around to Harry.
"So, why don't we try this again, amour?" He said, staring at me, his eyes flicking from my eyes to my lips.
"Ginny, I think it's best if you leave," Molly finally said. The read-head whipped around to her mother.
"Ok, you two have had your squabble, my turn to talk," I said, not leaving any room for argument as I sat my wine glass down and began talking, leaning my head on my hand, cradling my cheek.
“Did you find something? Was he Obliviated?” She asked.
He held Draco’s head in his hands, tilting him to kiss him deeper, revelling in the whimper that left Draco’s throat. Harry had been so cautious, so afraid that Draco wouldn’t want this enough to try to forgive him. And maybe Draco wouldn’t forgive him, not for a long time. But for now, he was in Harry’s kitchen, letting Harry cook him dinner, letting Harry kiss him like he was the air Harry breathed after being underwater for so long.
“Thanks,” he said, giving her a smile and a nod and weaving his way out of the store.
“Help!” he called, overwhelmed and frantic. The noise rose as people took notice and recognized him, then recognized his burden.
Draco stared at the page in shock for a moment, before his lips started twitching, and suddenly he was trying very hard to hold back a giggle. He raised his hand to cover his mouth, because laughing at that felt morbidly wrong, but Harry quickly reached over and pulled his wrist away. He wanted Draco to react, and Draco had promised him honesty. So he released his laughter. Harry’s face was gratified and amused.
ten whole years ago, so what was his problem?
“So that’s apparently the only sound you can make from your mouth,” he chuckled quietly. “What will the papers say? ‘Chosen One Chooses New Calling: Professional Whistling Pantomime...’”

Harry’s lip twitched.
A peach colour, warm and full, impossible and entrancing and blossoming despite the circumstances; Harry felt it again, a slim hand squeezing his shoulder, a
Timsy waved a hand in the direction of the study, though Harry already knew where it was. Harry stepped quietly down the hallway, pausing for just a second in front of the wooden double doors to the study, mentally preparing. As if there was any way to prepare himself for this sort of thing.

Even though Draco had actively avoided public attention for the last eight years?
“The protection of his mother’s love,” Draco’s voice came out of his own mouth, sounding foreign and monotone without his control over it, but he smirked anyway, asserting himself the only way he was able to. Lucius frowned.
Lucius released him, and Draco gulped in air like a dying man, his ears ringing.
“Alright, where do you want me to go?” he asked, to nothing and everything.
Timsy reappeared with a tray laden with coffee, fixings, biscuits, and chocolate, and laid it on the side table between them. It looked heavenly, even though Draco had just eaten and had already had two cups of Timsy’s delectable coffee. He restrained himself to a glass of water, knowing if he had more coffee now his hands would start to shake.
Hera seemed happy to see Draco’s strange companion again, and gladly took Harry’s carrots and affections. As Bubo hopped down from his perch to land gently on Draco’s bare arm, Draco saw the situation from a new perspective—Harry loved the doe and the owl, even though they reminded him of those he had lost. It certainly explained Harry’s conflicting expressions from their last visit: delighted smile, with mournful eyes, which Draco could see again, now, as Harry took the pouch of owl treats from Draco and held it up to the eagle owl.
He looked back once at Draco’s prone form, a curled lump under the duvet, his hair like a beacon among the dark covers. Every cell in Harry’s body screamed at him to get back in that bed, to wrap himself around Draco’s body and let someone else save the day, for once, just so he could kiss Draco whenever he wanted.
“I’m speaking perfectly clear, Harry.”
Harry rolled his eyes, huffed a silent laugh, and left.
“Once or twice, why?”
“I know.”
“I need to know what you know of the Unspeakables’ current projects, as well as a list of who works there and their backgrounds,” Draco said, and Shacklebolt stared at him for a moment, dumbfounded, before throwing his head back and
He’d admit he’d asked after the Unspeakables out of curiosity, intrigue. Just to see. He wasn’t much for books or studying, but apparently—according to the Head Unspeakable—he didn’t need to be.
Draco didn’t get the chance to return the greeting as he was ushered into a tight hallway. Weasley motioned vaguely to the hooks on the wall, moving on further into the house. Draco kept his beloved shirt-jacket on, for comfort.
He stood and stepped back, looking at the larger picture again, but they still seemed entirely random, other than being more concentrated and closer together near the top, slightly more sparse and spread out near the bottom.
He lifted his arm up, and Bubo gracefully dropped down onto it. Harry looked up in surprise. “This is Bubo,” Draco introduced, rooting around in his extended pocket for the pouch of owl treats. “He delivers the post when he feels like it, which isn’t often. He spends most of his time out here.” Draco opened the pouch and held it up to the owl, who gave a quiet, grateful hoot and began rummaging inside it with his beak.
“Whatever you’re doing, Harry,
The witch handed it over uneasily, then left the room. Harry pulled out his wand and levitated the envelope; Draco joined him and cast a small
Draco continued to glare at him, but it wasn’t a glare that Harry was used to. His eyes were narrowed, a little red, his brow furrowed, his mouth pulled down in a frown. He did indeed look irritated, worried, perplexed—he also looked determined, curious, the faintest hint of fond.
Are you alright? Everything go okay with the raid?”
“I think we have time for best two out of three, yeah?” Draco yelled, flying in tight circles to warm up his muscles. Harry smiled at him from across the garden, coming out of a Sloth Grip Roll, and released the Snitch.
“No.”
“If I may continue?” Malfoy asked warily. Harry nodded, his gaze turned cautiously away from him.
On the back, Draco found a list of songs with different artists he hadn’t heard of. He grinned widely, his face brightening with excitement as he looked back at Harry, who seemed pleased and abashed.
Harry expected him to brush it off with his easy laugh, he’d hoped for a casual

breaking, grabbing Harry’s arm and apparating them directly into the foyer of Grimmauld Place.
you’ve saved me yet again.” Hermione sat back down behind her desk with a sigh of relief. Harry stared at
Harry’s gut was churning as they entered the dark, circular entry room of the Department of Mysteries. Ron’s face was paler than usual, his hand unconsciously gripping the tentacle scars on his arm, and Kingsley’s mouth was set in a hard line. The three of them had never wanted to come back here—but apparently, the Unspeakables had been relying on that. From the grim look on Kingsley’s face, he was thinking the same thing.
and a deep grunting noise. The weight of the old, metal stool toppled over a Disillusioned Lucius, who reappeared suddenly, visible and unconscious on the floor.
“I’ve been told my presence smells a bit like broom polish, or candlesmoke. You may experience something similar.” Harry’s memories were so vibrant—detailed and intense. He felt everything so strongly, and Draco had trouble keeping up with the rapid changes. Fear, curiosity, anger, grief, joy. Draco could feel his own reactions about to burst from where he kept them held back.
Harry froze, his mouth opening and closing as he tried and failed to come up with a response. Malfoy simply stared at him, biting his lip.
had seemed bigger, scarier back then.
to ensure it, even
Harry had no idea that Wizards’ Chess would be so difficult when he couldn’t tell the pieces what to do. Ron’s pieces usually argued with him at every turn, anyway, and now they seemed to be arguing amongst themselves, since Harry couldn’t steer them back to the task, verbally. Needless to say, the game was slow.
Harry,” Draco commanded. “In the rest of your years at school, when did you ever trust an adult to take care of something dire? How many times were you forced to take matters into your own hands, because the adults around you wouldn’t, or couldn’t?”
He threw the floo powder into the fire, and called out “Minister Shacklebolt’s Office!” before sticking his head into the flames, enduring the odd, twisting journey sending his head and shoulders away from his body.
Hannah frowned, but eventually nodded. She flicked her wand to dispel Harry’s
Draco raised his eyebrow doubtfully, and Harry smirked weakly.
“Oh,” Draco said. “Yes, your head did hurt quite a lot that year. Voldemort’s doing, I presume?”
Draco shot him another unimpressed look. “Yes, six weeks, and that’s on the shorter end of the timeline. The mind is absolutely gargantuan, and we have to pay attention to every detail. If we’re keeping the analogy, we’re literally scouring the forest floor for breadcrumbs. You can’t rush through it, as missing a crumb or taking a wrong turn could set us back even farther. Plus, we have to recover any lost memories first.”
I’m an idiot.”
accord, a ferret. It simply… happened.
They went back to Grimmauld, because it was closer. Draco was quiet, a permanent crease of tension between his brows, but he didn’t look particularly upset—just thoughtful.
“You’re unbelievable,” Harry grumbled, shaking his head. He picked up the empty plastic dishes and threw them in the overflowing rubbish bin by the door.
“Good day, Minister.”
Soon he saw a faint silvery glow, just out of sight. It reminded him of the glow around the Obliviation on Sunday. He watched it move around his peripherals for a while. “I see something,” he warned Harry. “I’m going to follow it.” He concentrated his magic, funneled a small amount more through his wand, and latched onto the glow as soon as it came back into view, demanding it to focus, but it was too murky, a haze of shadow and colour. A baby’s memory. The sound rang through Harry’s head, much more clear than a baby’s memory should be.
Harry felt just a little drawn to the shadow below it, the bob of his Adam’s apple as he swallowed nervously between sentences. Malfoy’s cheeks were only getting pinker. Harry furrowed his brows, looking down at his fuschia macaron, back up to Malfoy’s face—
They continued their excited gossiping, while Harry listened on silently, processing his thoughts, running the silk handkerchief through his fingers.
“I wasn’t
Which was stupid. He was just creepy.
Ten years looked
Harry looked down at his hands, his shoulders shaking with laughter, his face traitorously hot.
Draco pulled away as the memory ended, quickly labeling a new dot on the chalkboard “Umbridge’s Punishment”. He touched his hair, rubbed the tops of his thighs. When he looked up, Harry’s face was grim, and he was absently rubbing the scars on the back of his right hand.
“If you’re skiving off, Harry,
“That so?” Harry mumbled.
“Hey, little storm,” he said softly. Boran’s mother grinned at the nickname, while to Draco’s delight, Boran rolled his eyes.

“Well, give it a go,” Harry said, waving his hand. “I want to know if it makes the sound.”

Ron and Hermione had sighed and shaken their heads when he’d told them how he’d be spending his holiday. They both thought that Harry shouldn’t stay in Grimmauld—it was grim and musty, and full of Dark Magic and memories of grief and pain. But Sirius had left it to him; it was one of the few things he had left of his family. He just couldn’t bear to part with it. Not yet.
Draco raised his eyebrows—Harry trusted
“Never again,” Harry said. “I promise.”
Harry’s eyes gravitated toward the head of white blond hair, as they always did. His breath caught at the sight of Draco sitting at the small table under the magnolia tree, which was nearly in full bloom, soft pink petals half-unfurled along the long, thin branches over his head. The sleeves of his charcoal jumper were rolled up to his elbows, with one long leg crossed elegantly over the other.
Harry grabbed his notebook off of the table to write:
He woke to the bright rays of sunshine pouring through his window, illuminating the rumpled bedsheets and general mess of the past few hazy days. He stretched his limbs, grinning faintly at the sweet lack of pain, for once; his body felt like his own.
the idea.
“Alright, I get it,” Draco admitted, withdrawing from Harry’s head. He set his wand down in his lap and rubbed his eyes beneath his glasses.
“Who would notice?”
Draco prayed to whoever was listening that he wasn’t blushing. Merlin preserve his dignity, Harry Potter was

Harry shook his head slowly, stunned, transfixed by the sight of Draco Malfoy
Potter is watching him, carefully enough that Draco could pretend he was concerned, if he wanted to. If he didn’t know any better. Potter’s hand shakes as he brings the cigarette to his mouth again, and Draco is just drunk enough to stare unabashedly at the way his lips move around it.
Harry looked over at his rucksack on the edge of the circle. He’d left his wand in it.
He grabbed another handful of floo powder from a small pot on the mantle, and threw it into the fire. Green flames whooshed from the grate, and he stepped in. “Malfoy Manor,” he called out, ignoring the sinking feeling in his stomach.
meeting Draco’s tongue with his own. Draco heard dozens of voices around him, he was distantly aware of the flashes of many cameras, but his existence had narrowed down to his own mouth, and the soft, warm lips connected to it.
Draco collapsed on top of him, breathing hard. Harry chuckled as he caught his breath, brushing a strand of sweaty blond hair out of his mouth. He wrapped his legs around the man who felt like home, breathing him in.
Ask and you shall receive!
“You dosed
He nodded briefly at Malfoy—no,

Harry was looking at him expectantly, and Draco knew he was waiting for Draco to show him the scars that divided his chest. But Draco wouldn’t, until he had to, and he would only have to if Harry
“I won’t endanger my son,” she rasped.

“In Malfoy Manor, Wiltshire.”
Harry’s fingers itched with the urge to touch it, his nose filled with the intoxicating scents of winter and eucalyptus and the sea, and he promptly forgot anything Malfoy had said in the last ten minutes.
The fire shot up in the grate, roaring and sparking and dangerously large. Books were throwing themselves off the shelves. The clattering glass finally shattered, whatever it was. Draco gripped the arms of the chair and breathed again, listening only to the sound of air moving in and out of his nose.
. As if its purpose was to hide, but only in order to be found.
He didn’t really want it to end. This was ten times better than anything going on in real life. He could stay here, he could pretend. Just for a while. Surely they’d figure out whatever curse he’d been hit with, eventually, he’d have to give this impossible scenario up, but until then—Malfoy was
“Yep,” Harry sighed. “I just—he’s always running his mouth, always insulting and belittling me, telling me I can’t get away with anything just because I’m the Saviour or whatever, as if I haven’t been working my arse off with bloody sixty-hour weeks—I was late by

He walked to the shelves next to his broom rack and picked up the small package he’d received the previous day, tossing it to Harry, who caught it with typical Seeker reflexes, looking back up at Draco with a question in his eyes.
not letting you wander off alone to Merlin-knows-where on the hunt for a muggle man I’ve never met.”
“You’ve learned—nothing,” Draco forced out through teeth clenched against his will. “I will rise higher than you—only because—you have decided to ensure it.”
“You didn’t have to, you know.”
, spark. Harry gripped the back of the sofa, grounding himself.
Harry brought them back to the end of sixth year, past Dumbledore’s funeral, and the uneventful summer at the Dursley’s. The first breadcrumb came almost immediately. “Got one,” Draco muttered, and latched on.

Anonymous! Full prompt: "Dudley and Harry actually have a decent relationship. Dudley invites Harry to a barbeque he's throwing and insists he bring his mysterious "better-half" that he knows exists, and is a wizard, but otherwise knows nothing about."
Draco just stared back at him in shock. Nothing here made any sense. Potter had tried to learn Occlumency from Severus? In school? While Severus was being a spy for the Dark Lord and Dumbledore? Also,
know what you’ve been up to since then—only what I’ve seen in the papers. I can guess there will be much fewer breadcrumbs in the more recent years, because the most formative memories usually occur before full adulthood, and your mind has targeted only the memories that truly shaped who you are as a person.”
He lifted his hands to the darkening sky, his body roiling, quaking; he didn’t look at his skin, because he was sure it was cracking like tectonic plates, like the magma of the earth itself was seeping out of him, burning away the hair standing on end, and the pressure was unbearable,
“It was quite something,” Draco commented, breaking the silence. “But I’ve seen that stag charge me down before, as you know. What about
Harry rolled his eyes at the peach-coloured rose that appeared at his bedside—grateful and loyal, carefully vigilant, unbearably guilty.
, spark, smoke.
“Mind if I take over for a bit, then? It’ll be a bit disorienting, but I’ll get us to the right memories. I remember the feeling of them.” Draco suggested.
Draco’s index finger was idly tracing the tip of the scar on his collarbone again, inside the open collar of his shirt. He couldn’t relax enough to doze, with Harry Potter so close, asleep on the chestnut leather sofa opposite him. So Draco simply lay there, occasionally watching the afternoon light move across the ceiling, occasionally watching Harry sleep. It was so quiet—all Draco could hear was Harry’s soft breathing, matching the gentle rise and fall of his chest, and the intermittent chirping of a blackbird outside.
A short pause, where Harry cleared his throat. “Chase the letters?”
“You know why,” Harry replied, tipping his chin up. He kissed Draco firmly, intently, hoping he could feel what words weren’t enough to convey. Draco drew in a sharp breath, grabbing handfuls of Harry’s shirt in his fists, and Harry couldn’t hold it in anymore.
Ron looked around warily at all the doors, as did everyone else. He eventually turned back to Harry, brows creased, thinking hard.
“I mean, they did try to poison us first,” Ron said matter-of-factly, and Draco’s head snapped up.
“You sound alarmingly final,” Draco muttered, his cheeks pink from the cold.
Harry nodded quickly—they were both apparently grateful for the distraction.
“Malfoy.”
He looked up at the cottage on the hill, and finally understood why it was called The Lighthouse.
“Thank Merlin for that,” Malfoy muttered. Harry turned back to him, eyeing him appraisingly, thinking. Visit St. Mungo’s twice a week, for full days, for six weeks, or indulge his curiosity and go to

back and forth of his hair against Draco’s forehead—and Draco finally made himself let go of Harry’s wrists, and pull away. Harry sat back in his chair, his hands falling limply to his lap. The tips of their shoes were still touching on the carpet—something they both chose not to acknowledge.
“You’ll keep this quiet, yeah?” Weasley looked for a moment scared, as if Draco was going to laugh in his face and run to the Prophet with this juicy tidbit. Which, while annoying and insulting at the moment, was kind of understandable. That had been Draco’s M.O. back in Hogwarts. At least, before the Dark Lord became a permanent house guest in his childhood home. That kickstarted a bit of a personality shift—not one that most of Wizarding Britain was able to grasp, unfortunately, considering his background and his family and his, him.
you’ll need to be struck by lightning.”
But where was John? Where were the other patrons? Harry had never seen the place so empty.
“To what I’ve seen so far?” Harry nodded. Draco groaned, cautiously letting down his barriers. It still felt a bit dangerous to be so open with Harry, but he’d said he would be, their first day. Harry was right: Draco was getting scared of his own reactions, how raw and vulnerable they made him feel, but Harry didn’t exactly have a choice in being vulnerable. He had no defense against Draco’s Legilimency. It was only fair. Draco
“This is not looking good, Harry.”
“Tikka masala, then?” Harry asked, sitting back on his knees, hovering over Draco as he pulled his wand out of its thigh holster. Draco’s breath caught in his throat as a jolt of heat ran through him. He nodded at Harry’s smirking face, not trusting his voice to come out in any sort of dignified manner.
Flick. On and on it went. Anyone who actually showed interest in Harry’s life was funneled efficiently out of his head and into the vial. Any repeating faces, as well, even though the attacker would probably have remained disguised. Anyone who mentioned anything about knowing him, or not knowing him, or how much he hid from them. He tried to listen for vocal inflections he might recognize from the attacker, but he figured they’d have masked their voice as well.
Reluctantly, Harry uncrossed his legs and turned his whole body to face his new Healer, dangling his legs off the side of the bed. He gripped the edges of the bed in his hands and took a few deep breaths, trying to calm his tensed muscles, before finally meeting Malfoy’s eyes again.
and thinking? If someone had shown him this memory of Harry, simply sitting back in this wingback chair, eyes closed and face tensed in thought, and asked Draco to follow this man and take up his causes, Draco would consider it. He would honestly turn over the prospect in his mind, whether Harry was Harry Potter, or simply a man.
One of the hands released him, but returned shortly, tentatively, to his face, a rough palm on Draco’s cheek, careful fingers in Draco’s hair.
“This. Being…
“Merlin, you two are
They chatted idly about her work in the sitting room, cradling cups of tea. She was a private divorce lawyer, and made a fortune at it, most of which she put away for Camila, wisely not trusting the Parkinson family to include an illegitimate child in an inheritance or trust. Pansy had no qualms about confidentiality around Draco, regaling him with the tales of juicy betrayals and sordid affairs of divorcing couples.
Draco was standing at the hob, his hair pulled up high on his head to keep it out of the food. He had several pots and pans going, simmering and stirring under his careful magical supervision.
The figure spoke with conviction, and Harry felt a breeze pass through his head. Wait, was that an incantation? Did he just
“A tour would be lovely, Mr. Malfoy,” Harry said, standing up straight and giving him a sly, regal nod.
He gasped as the threads bombarded him, taking their rightful places in his head, a battering siege of
was your only chance at a normal life, with a family?” Harry flinched. Draco sighed softly.
And then, just beneath it, in small, tight script:
He still didn’t let go, never stopped touching Harry for even a second, even as he drifted into sleep in his own bed, his pale fingers curled possessively around Harry’s wrist.
But he didn’t have to think about that just yet. He had much better things to think about, like the way those lights reflected in Draco’s heated eyes, the way he pulled the elastic out of his hair and shook it out, the way the white-blond strands floated in the slight breeze over the garden. Harry hoped the sea salt in the air would melt into his skin, that he might always smell Draco’s home, wherever he went.
“Yes, Mrs. Malfoy can stay here for now,” she sighed. “I have to be here to pick up Rose from school.”
The figure continued staring, and Draco took the time to take inventory of himself, slowly. He felt no wounds, no bruising—only the stiff, sore heaviness of his muscles, and a dull ache in his core, and a disconcerting, disorienting incoherence in his head.
“Anyone other than Unspeakables we have to consider?”
“Kill me now, Dumbledore,”
“Your wands,” Draco mused. “Cores of phoenix feather. Did the feathers come from the same bird?” Harry nodded, opening his notebook on his lap with one hand, writing one word.
often, they’ll probably use Disillusionment Charms, too.”
“Do you have any questions for me, before we begin?”
So that Harry would trust him?
and he… if I had known—”
When Harry found out Draco had been turned during the War, the only physical difference he'd noticed was Draco’s teeth.
Draco grabbed his notebook and walked towards the chairs by the fire, motioning for Harry to join him. He gave Harry the chair that faced the door, like last time. Harry had a feeling he’d done that on purpose, to make Harry more comfortable.
Draco kissed him, again and again, frustrated, as if he couldn’t help it. Harry sighed against his lips, letting the warmth and contentment run through him.
The song ended, and Harry peppered Draco’s face with kisses until he laughed again and swatted him away.
he’d have to go to Draco, he would jump straight into suspicion that Draco himself had made it that way.
Summer fell away into autumn, and Harry mourned that a whole season of roses at Draco’s door had gone by in his absence. He wondered what Draco’s home looked like, this time of year, if he had ever spent time on the beach; he imagined what Draco looked like rising out of the sea, his long hair slicked back with water, droplets falling from his chin to his scarred chest.
“Thank you, Malfoy,” Granger smirked, raising her eyebrows. “And please, call me Hermione.”
at him?
Harry, and for what? You think Kingsley is the one keeping the Aurors away from me?
Harry burned breakfast several times, which only made Draco tease him more, which only turned him on more. It was impossible to keep his hands to himself. Which made it that much more difficult to drop Draco off at the Manor and leave him for the Ministry, every day.
“Won’t that
“What is it you want, Harry?” Draco murmured in his ear. “You want the moon?”
“You mean… whatever those potions did to you, was
The first time Draco transformed, nearly a year ago, Harry had almost pissed himself laughing, which prompted a firm bite that Harry still had a scar on his middle finger from. Yet Draco had since made peace with his Animagus form. Firstly, he was small enough that Harry could carry him tucked up in hoodie pockets, which was an unparalleled delight previously unbeknownst to Draco. Secondly, he was small and
“Alright,” he said finally, even though things were definitely not alright. He sipped his coffee, allowing the warmth and flavour to soothe him, and caught himself absently rubbing his sternum with the heel of his palm. He put both his hands on the coffee mug to keep them occupied. Harry simply watched him, a cautious, vulnerable look on his face.
“When have you ever held a pygmy puff?” Pansy laughed as they deposited the dishes in the sink, setting a charm to clean them. Camila came in and added her new drawing to the growing collection on the cupboard, with help from one of Pansy’s sticking charms. From a distance, the cupboards looked like they were crawling with odd, colourful insects.
The Aurors nodded grimly. Parkinson chimed in from the corner.
Weasley’s exhausted sigh seemed to move through his whole body. “He went on holiday, his first one ever, and stayed in his house the entire time. He told us he wanted to relax and work on some home renovation. Then the day before he’s supposed to return to work, he shows up at our floo frantic, and silent, pointing to his throat and flailing his hands around. We took him straight to Mungo’s, he’s been there for two days, seeing every Healer they have. We think he may have been Obliviated, maybe if he went out for food or something, someone might have…” He trailed off, scrubbing his hand through his hair again. He set down his coffee and pulled a thin black elastic off of his wrist, wrestling his hair into a messy bun at the back of his head. It looked good on him, accentuating his strong jawline and showing off the muscles of his neck and shoulders, which only pissed Draco off more. Weasleys were not good-looking,
“Everywhere,” Draco repeated, his icy lips moving against Harry’s neck. “Nowhere.”
He rubbed the Dark Mark on his arm through the silk sleeve of his shirt, and felt the raised scarring under the fabric.
did not want to—
“I’ll bet he has,” Draco whispered back. “He’s unbearably stubborn.”
“Well, that made me a bit giddy, so let’s do some more breathing to calm our heart rates, and try for another one,” Draco suggested, and Harry nodded once, smirking.
“It does,” Draco replied, and the wizard finally looked up, his eyes widening at the sight of notorious ex-Death-Eater Draco Malfoy in a very sharp, black,
"Fifty-two days, Draco," Harry said, and Draco felt like he was finally losing his mind, and maybe it had even been fifty-two years, how was he to know what was real and what wasn't— "I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Draco. I had to find you, I had to wait—for the moon—"

charm and setting it on Harry’s bedside table. Harry heard him whisper,
Harry widened his eyes.
The figure’s tone was part disdainful, part coddling. Draco didn’t trust it at all.
Harry’s smile grew. He reached over to the side table for the hot chocolates Timsy had brought, and apparently left there. He handed one to Draco, pathetically warm with accomplishment and unsuccessfully suppressed attraction.
Timsy appeared next to him with a quiet
“This prophecy obviously could have been meant for anybody, but Lucius has evidently decided that it’s referring to Draco. His pride won’t allow his son to become more powerful than him—in his own view of success or ‘rising higher’—and his greed won’t allow that sort of ‘power’ to pass him by.” Ron pulled the small, folded paper out of his pocket, handing it to Harry to be passed around the room. Harry’s chest tightened at the sight of Draco’s frantic handwriting.
“It’s calmer than I’ve seen before, gentler. When you’re angry or upset, the air feels charged, like it does right before a lightning storm. Like going to touch something metal in a dry winter, knowing the static will zap you.” Draco breathed in deeply again, and rolled his head on his neck, letting it wash over him.
“I’m afraid of Death,” Harry admitted. Draco felt something clench in his chest, the timidity in Harry’s voice wrapping around Draco’s lungs and squeezing. He said nothing.
Hermione demanded, her face torn between fear and anger.

I love you, and rely on you to just be… you. However you want to be. Though now I do have what might be considered an unreasonable amount of scrunchies for just one man.”
“You’re an Unspeakable, Harry. You have some of the highest security clearance in the Ministry. If you say you have to be there, they can’t question you. You can’t answer, anyway.”
Draco found his checklist of priorities in his head, and decided to start with the first. He turned his face back to Harry, who was watching him closely, rubbing his thumb over Draco’s fingers.
“Alright,” Harry cut off her rambling and lowered his wand. “Hi, Hannah.”
“Malfoy,” she replied coolly. Then, apparently mustering the strength for something, “Thank you for coming.”
(See the end of the chapter for
And some POV switching, which occurs after ****** (instead of the usual ***).
“Dobby tried to get you expelled?” Draco asked, glancing up at Harry, who snorted quietly. “He always did have a roundabout way of doing things,” Draco murmured absently as he wrote. “Very clever, and very brave.”
“Where is Draco?” Harry asked loudly, because
“What’s that?” he asked, nodding to it. Narcissa turned the painting around.
part of his brain saw the bubble tea in Harry’s other hand, which did not stop the happy wiggling, seeing as Harry had gone to Draco’s favorite shop.
Draco hadn’t said a word, since Harry’s admission. He’d stared at Harry in shock, a storm of unreadable emotion, and only nodded when Harry had told him to come with.
Harry decided he may as well make the most of this. He couldn’t for the life of him remember what a Veritaserum overdose actually looked like, and he was worried sick, but he didn’t know what else he could do, at this point. He didn’t know how to help, he had no idea how to clean a potion out of someone’s blood on the fly. And Draco had
“He took care of it,” Draco said quickly, quietly, darting glances at Harry, who couldn’t seem to meet his eyes. He could see a faint blush on Harry’s cheeks, too, and knew that for some reason, that moment was something Harry didn’t particularly want his friends knowing about. Draco agreed wholeheartedly. It seemed too—intimate. Private... Those were Draco’s own reasons, anyway.
That only made Harry feel stubborn, though, in the familiar way of
Draco began a lively retelling of a daring niffler rescue, and Harry felt life returning to him as he inevitably smiled, laughing at the more outrageous things the niffler had managed to fit in his pouch (“you’re having me on, there’s no way a bloody

He Conjured an empty glass vial, placed his wand to his temple, and pulled out the memory of his day—Malfoy’s cottage, Malfoy’s hair, Malfoy’s tea, Malfoy’s hands—Malfoy’s voice, his anxiety over his mother, his conviction that she was alive—the looming fortress of Malfoy Manor, the dark vines that climbed its sides, the house elves in their clean clothes. He dropped it carefully into the thin glass mouth of the bottle.
Harry’s eyes widened. He was beginning to see where this was going.
Malfoy grumbled his discontent as he closed the door behind them and led them into the kitchen.
“You need to go,” he said gruffly. “The hospital here won’t be able to help her. I don’t know where the nearest magical one is. She’s dying, Harry.”
“On that note, I’m going home,” Draco said, taking a deep breath and standing from his armchair. “Thank you both for having me. I hope this was helpful to you—call on me again, if you have questions I can answer.” He left out

“You’ve got to be kidding me,” Pansy muttered as she entered the eighth year common room, obviously annoyed.
Harry smiled again, amused despite himself. “It is. It was also a bit of a relief.”

If he was leaving, he’d have to come up with a story to leave the Unspeakables, one that would keep them away from Draco. He’d have to convince them that he was simply dissatisfied with his job and bored, and that Draco maybe stopped caring about his mother’s disappearance, maybe Narcissa didn’t really care for him, either, maybe there would be no need to try to go after him. Or maybe he’d just have to burn the place down and Obliviate them all. He couldn’t ask Draco to stay in his house all the time, could he? And he couldn’t ask Ron and Hermione to keep a constant eye on him, either. Right?
Harry obeyed, and didn’t make Draco sweat any more, which he was grateful for. The idiot had no idea how attractive he was, and it was so bloody annoying. Or maybe he did, and he enjoyed watching Draco squirm like this. Draco wouldn’t put it past him. He kept his face carefully neutral, and breathed until the heat left his cheeks, and felt in control of himself again. Crooking a finger in invitation,
“Yes, anger, mostly. Fury, a heavy dose of wrath. I don’t think I’ve ever felt angrier. I’m still angry,” Draco answered. His hands were starting to shake again. Somewhere, he thought he heard a soft clatter of glass.

“We have time for one more, before our break,” Draco said. “Do you feel up for it? Be honest.”
“Probably the first time you caused harm to what was technically an innocent bystander, right? Must have completely thrown you…” Draco trailed off, thinking further, as Harry gave him another encouraging nod.
Harry snarled, releasing him and stepping back. Rage simmered with confusion and frustration and something he didn’t want to examine, he

Draco eventually paused his writing again, looking up at Harry with a satisfied half-smile, which quickly fell at whatever he saw on Harry’s face.

this, which only made Harry angrier. He shoved him again, harder, interrupting Malfoy’s cruel laugh.
He grasped it firmly and gave it a quick shake, then gestured for Weasley to lead the way out. He was still in his pyjamas, after all.
Harry’s pen dropped obediently to the paper, writing furiously. He turned the notebook around.
which wasn’t an emotion he’d expected.
Forty days.
“Should I even ask which one of us will walk away with scars, this time?”
Harry noticed the roses had climbed higher on the trestles by Draco’s front door, the smallest of buds showing among thick vines and dark leaves.
Their silence was his answer. Draco sighed heavily, scrubbing a hand over his face.
“I need more cases,” Harry declared, and Ron stared at him for a moment, before narrowing his eyes shrewdly.
“Then
“What?” Draco asked.

“The important part is in danger, Cissa,” Harry retorted.
“We haven’t investigated in weeks,” Draco said, his voice low and flat. “

“She’s definitely left her mark on this place,” Harry replied. Draco shook his head slowly.
“Can you fix it?”
“Leave,” Draco said, dropping Harry’s hand.
“I can’t,” he finally forced out. “Please.”
“Harry,” he said firmly, pausing a memory of another panic attack in a broom cupboard. “Let me see it.” His tone left no room for argument, but he could feel Harry’s anxiety building, pleading.
“You heard me, Malfoy. Now let us in.”
Draco was still looking at him like he’d grown three heads, so Harry quickly added, “But it was worth it.”
That was a seriously dangerous overdose, and Harry’s brain scrambled, trying to remember his training, they’d told him what too much Veritaserum could do to a person—
one of the best of his age. He strengthened his Occlumency walls.
Draco huffed. “Yes, yes, I was a prick, karma’s a bitch, and now I have to wear reading glasses at age twenty-five. Anything else we need to get out of the way before I can start working?” he asked, exasperated.
Harry sagged heavily on the bed. They really were going to make him go through with this. It was either get dissected by Malfoy, or go find some other Mind Curse specialist on the Continent. Maybe it would be over quickly.
“But that’s
Harry huffed. “I’m curious, Draco,” he said. “Not suspicious.”
He heard the rattle of the key in the lock—Draco would notice it was already unlocked. Harry felt his palms sweat, despite the chill.
Harry swished his wand, Vanishing the plastic figure. He looked back up at his friends, begging them to understand.
Draco eyed Weasley as he moved further into the room. “I’m guessing you didn’t tell him, and that’s why he’s looking at me like he could dismember me with sheer force of will?” Which, honestly, he probably could, if he really wanted to. Draco had seen what he was capable of as a teenager, and he was very much a grown man, now.
The door reappeared, and Harry nodded. Kingsley turned away and moved on to the rest of the group, giving each of them the secret individually.
“No, I want you to pretend,” Draco said. “Tell me you love me. Tell me this is real.”
The potion tore away everything protecting Harry’s magical core—whatever vague center of him contained his magic, he hadn’t been listening when Hermione explained it, he was too hung up on the
“How do you know she’s read that in particular?” Hermione scooted over for a closer look. Ron closed it and lifted it up to show the spine.

“On the Hog—” nope. “Madam Malkin’s, though I didn’t know it was you at the time.”
“Timsy is purchasing food that someone else is making. Timsy has brought home curry for Masterses lunch.”
And it is.
“N—eurgh, Trelawney. But she doesn’t c—” He couldn’t finish that one, either.
Draco didn’t answer, simply pressed his lips to Harry’s cheekbone, held him tighter, and swayed with him.
—they’d have access to the Hall of Prophecy, and something there must have caused them to act.
Potter shot up in his bed at the mention of Legilimency, looking from Weasley to Granger and back with wild, betrayed eyes. He couldn’t speak, but Draco could read that, too:
Draco could tell this was a child, now, as the name floated through his mind, familiar…
Draco paused mid-step by the door, clicking his tongue at himself, turning around and reaching into his pocket. He strode quickly back to the desk, and deposited a small, white box, identical to the one Harry was currently digging confections out of.
They all shook their heads. “No. We avoid Level Nine, and as far as I know, they want nothing to do with us,” Ron explained. “But of course, no one knows what Unspeakables look like, or what they get up to down there nowadays. So, it’s possible. They’re generally assumed to be a bunch of swots, buried in their books and their secrets.”
“What the
Potter watched him fumble to explain himself, and Draco felt uneasy under his interrogating gaze.
he’d never known,
Potter nodded, still not meeting his eyes. Draco missed the attention, pathetically. He nodded back.
the figure asked, probably rhetorically, and where was the fucking bartender? Was no one else picking up on this bizarre conversation? How will Potter get home like this?
“Gran! I caught one! Look!” the boy exclaimed, panting. Draco stared at him in shock. It was a wonder he hadn’t panicked or jumped at the sudden intrusion—Andromeda apparently had a very calming effect.
It was supposed to be
Draco settled himself in his chair, twirling his wand in his fingers, breathing deeply as he watched Harry meditate. He thought privately that the gentle, repetitive rise and fall of Harry’s shoulders was calming enough for him to forgo his own meditation. Instead, he brought up his Occlumency shields again, stuffing his emotions and reactions behind the big, wooden door in his mind, preparing himself for the work ahead.
Harry continued watching him, absorbing his words. Draco made himself finish.
Weasley opened the door before Draco could knock, grinning, for some unknown reason. He was nearly as tall as the door frame, making Draco’s six feet of height feel insignificant. His long, red hair was tied back in another bun on the back of his head. Draco tried not to scowl.

in a letter before Lucius showed up, and he could not defend himself without
“You mean, when have you ever gotten anything done without Hermione Granger?” Draco retorted wryly. Hermione looked up, surprised and confused at the convoluted, indirect compliment. Ron grinned.
“I charmed every adult in the room, you mean, while also amusing them with my efforts?”
More silence. Draco decided he couldn’t continue holding his own body up—he’d have to move to the wall.
and Harry’s, and—Lucius Abraxas Malfoy, question mark?
Harry’s arm slid around his neck, his hand buried in Draco’s hair, and Draco had
“Yes, I know you have one,” Draco rolled his eyes. Harry shook his head and put down his sandwich. He then proceeded to fully
He crouched down next to the bed, bringing his face level with Malfoy’s, inspecting him. He looked so
“Draco,” Harry whispered, feeling his tense and shaking body with strong, careful hands. “What has he done to you?”
“There you are,” he murmured, grinning as he stood up straight again, reluctantly dropping his hands. Harry briefly mourned the loss, and he gathered as much of his wits as he could, feeling like his nerve could slip away again at any moment, if Draco kept looking at him like that.
Harry didn’t belong here, but he never wanted to leave. He’d sit outside Draco’s door and stare at the sea, if he had to, until he became one with Draco’s garden, sprouting mounds of pink sea thrifts just for Draco to enjoy. If
“You didn’t have to,” Draco mumbled absently, as if manners were muscle memory.
The kitchen was thrown into a tense, shocked silence, before Ron used the cool head that had gotten him the Head Auror position and slowly lowered his wand. Harry and Hermione reluctantly followed suit, still buzzing with adrenaline from the sudden invasion. Timsy was no threat, even though he certainly
“He said a lot of things,” Harry began. “He said that I was… that I was
He stood slowly on wobbly knees, enduring the now familiar overwhelm of painful, ancient magic, and raised his hands over his head. He felt all of his hairs stand on end, pressure and electricity lapping at every cell in his body—
Shacklebolt raised his eyebrows. He lowered his quill, sitting back in his ornate leather chair and motioning for Draco to continue.
“Have you been like this since you first started transforming?” Harry asked thoughtfully. Draco let himself wiggle, just a bit. The
Flick. More memories passed, Harry at the bar, chatting with the bartender about nothing. Men and women chatting him up, but uninterested in
Draco growled with frustration and stood, pacing his sitting room. A letter, he’d have to write a letter, he wouldn’t even be allowed to relay a message with his Patronus, since the message would be heard by anyone in the room. He flicked his wand and summoned a small piece of paper and a ballpoint pen, sitting on the end of his sofa and propping his leg up on the coffee table to write on it, it didn’t have to be
Draco jumped a little when he finally noticed him, then rolled his eyes, grabbing a glass of wine from the counter.
“Those were hospital standard privacy and soundproofing spells. You probably saw every Healer who came through here perform them on the door. I wouldn’t trust anyone who didn’t,” Malfoy explained, his face smooth and indifferent as he slowly met Harry’s outraged eyes. “Especially with you, Potter.”
“You’re here!” the clerk squealed as he walked in, loud enough to be heard over the bubbly pop music. She flitted around the tightly packed displays of cubic zirconia and glitz to the back wall, her many necklaces and bangles jingling with the movement. “These just came in—well don’t just stand there, come see!”
And then it really hit him that this was
“No, I can’t imagine you would be, after
“Yes, yes, I know,” Pansy sighed, flapping her hand. “I can’t help it, gossip is in my nature, I’ll never stop asking.”
Harry probably knew that. He wouldn’t have been able to speak, if it was true. The return of his voice only meant that Draco truly knew him, for who he was, if the attacker was to be believed.
Harry turned to look behind him, and Draco saw the boy a few beds down from him, sound asleep. A woman with dark, wavy hair kept vigil at his bedside, never moving her eyes from him, as if he could disappear at any moment.
He slowly, silently pushed open the door, and froze.
The owner, of course, was rather flustered to see the Chosen One in her shoppe, and began showing him every item in her inventory. She brought out self-mailing postcards and some of the thickest parchment he’d ever seen, peacock feather quills and leather-bound journals—
Harry burst into raucous laughter, falling back onto the wet ground as the absurdity of it all caught up with him. He’d survived. He’d absorbed the magic of an island and now had a permanent link to it, because he’d been struck by lightning. And not for the first time, his lover’s mother’s omniscient presence had just bopped him upside the head.
Draco sagged, panting and clutching his torso, squeezing his eyes shut against the pain. He hadn’t even been talking about
Draco glanced off to the side, curling into himself. “I know it’s
and stomped over to the countertop, quickly slamming the square
Harry kept a toothbrush at The Lighthouse, and a key around his neck, and filled his house with eucalyptus.
“Go.”
“That’s a muggle reference,” he said quietly, his lips ticking up at the sides. Draco stilled.
Ron had said they never went down there, that they weren’t welcome after the damage they’d caused in ‘96. It was probable, then, that they still hadn’t gone. They hadn’t checked. Draco’s brain was sprinting.
Ron rolled his eyes. “Five galleons, it’s a woman,” he mumbled.
Draco stared at the fire for a few minutes after Harry left, a turbulent mixture of emotions running through him.
Harry’s head snapped up, meeting Draco’s gaze, his face a mix of awe and relief and trepidation. Draco was once again startled by the intensity of the bottle green eyes behind the round frames, briefly remembering how it felt to just tip forward, to fall in. He didn’t let go of Harry’s fingers—they simply stared at each other, taking the other in, and Draco felt that familiar, constricting ache in his chest.
Draco narrowed his eyes.
“She recognized you, too,” Malfoy said, then turned away, trudging back up the stairs.
Narcissa was hyperventilating at this point, consumed by her grief and her fear, and Harry sighed heavily, trying not to lash out. He flicked his wand and summoned a Calming Draught from the cabinet where Ron and Hermione stored potions, and handed it to her. Her hands shook as she uncorked the tiny bottle, downing the whole thing. Harry was still
He didn’t protest when Harry offered to cook. Harry miraculously managed to keep himself from doing a gleeful little dance.
“I’ll take it.”

“No, I—” Harry started, then shut his mouth, swallowing hard.
the memories, once he extracted them, but he did tear them away, distorting and blurring their images and sounds. He couldn’t fully access them, once they exited his head. He only had the feelings of them, and he’d never felt anything more than vague curiosity, easy contentment, sometimes annoyance. Harry had lived ten years with empty days of disconnected feelings, and since he’d started using Occlumency to hide his more private memories, then creating false ones altogether, he’d felt more like himself than he had in a
And a brighter smile. But that was
until the glow appeared, covering another hefty chunk of memories, similar to the breadcrumb of Harry’s eleventh birthday—but these looked dark, painful. Draco took a deep breath, and seized them with his magic.
before… had Draco really wanted it that badly?
Because it was ridiculous. Oh, the irony.
“Well, I wasn’t about to let you burn—”
He took a deep breath, and opened it to the first page. Out fell the folded photograph, Draco’s laughter preserved in print, and then—

of love or empathy.”
“It was worth it, at the time,” he replied quietly. “It won’t happen again. The patient—is healed,” the twist of warning made him even more scared now, with the memory of the pain of that kiss, and none of the reward to balance it. “They—won’t be back.” Draco clenched his jaw through the discomfort and went back to his broom care. He set down the polishing rag and laid the broom across his lap, examining the footholds as he absentmindedly rubbed his chest with his free hand.
“Would you like a bit of a break, from being in your own head?” Draco asked. Harry furrowed his brows in confusion, tilting his head to the side.
but he had no time or energy for reproach, with his head too busy screwing itself back on.
frozen where he stood
Malfoy finally left, and now Harry’s stare was on the new white box. He reached over and opened it, to find even more colourful macarons. Hermione snatched it away from him.
Harry, he could have refused to let you participate in the Tournament, he could have
“What then,” Draco mumbled against Harry’s lips, between breathless kisses. “You thought you’d just show up, see if I was feeling gracious enough to host you to get you out of another speaking engagement? What if I’d turned you away, would you have run back to the Ministry with your tail between your legs?”
“Well, that point is moot, now, isn’t it, I’m healed, so
Draco furrowed his brows as he opened the tin of broom polish, breathing in the scent, grabbing a couple of rags and his Firebolt from the rack on the wall. He laid a rag on his knee and leaned the broom against it, dipping the other rag into the polish.
“I reckon he wasn’t too pleased about that,” he said, and Harry shook his head, his smile growing. Draco felt satisfied he had cheered Harry up enough to go back in.
“Or,” Draco says weakly. Harry feels his sticky, shaky fingers on his jaw, and smiles.
Ron hesitated before replying. He shot an appeasing look at Harry first. “I promise I’m not accusing you of anything, Draco, but I have to cover all angles, here—how do we know you had nothing to do with it, when they had essentially driven Harry to a Legilimens, and you are obviously the only Healer Legilimens in the country?”
He stared at the glowing glass sphere, that he hadn’t even been sure he would find, yet here it was—tagged with
The trail was easier to follow, with the sunlight dappling through the leaves. Harry’s black t-shirt and dark hair stood out among the bright forest, like a harmony—something that wasn’t quite the same, but supposed to be there regardless, adding to the trees to create something even more lovely. The earth around them was becoming greener by the day, and Draco couldn’t help but compare the colours to those in Harry’s eyes, noting the similarities accentuated with the variety of flora. He hoped, with his entire being, that if he was being this pathetic internally, he was at least being
, before, and he was not particularly eager to wake up any time soon.
“I studied here for about six months, one of my first apprenticeships, under a renowned Healer who would only let me call him ‘Croque Monsieur’—which is basically the name of a cheese toasty,” Draco explained, pleased with the burst of curiosity and amusement he could feel from Harry’s presence. “He was an odd fellow, but quite inspiring.”
this was definitely not a dream. Harry’s gaze was never that
The memories were becoming more rushed, more intense, more vibrant, and Draco knew that meant something particularly horrible was coming up. The images flashed past him on their own, now—Harry was remembering it all clearly, himself, without Draco’s assistance. Draco held his Occlumency walls, maintained his presence as a spectator in Harry’s head, and kept watch for the telltale glow.
about him. Or maybe about his work. Or about whether he was up to anything nefarious. He accepted the warmth in his chest and put it out of his mind.
Draco squeezed Harry’s hand, hard, staring at the small, sleeping child in the bed.
house, there was no need for finery. Grey chinos, ivory cotton jumper, topped off with his beloved navy shirt-jacket—he was quite impressed with himself. Only he could make something so casual look so
Harry rubbed his face with his hands, gathering himself, before finally looking back up at Draco. Draco could see the helpless dread in his eyes. He must have been thinking that every breadcrumb would be something painful like that. Draco didn’t know—he hoped not, but it was possible. Likely. Harry had a lot of pain in his past, he knew.
Narcissa, and I can’t even—I can’t even
“They wanted to use you as a sort of… tap, or a go-between for Narcissa,” Harry said, resuming his chopping. “But they hadn’t told her they didn’t plan on re-Conjuring her, and knew that she wouldn’t give them her universal knowledge willingly, so they—they wanted to hurt you, because she would likely manifest around you when you were in pain. They sent me to observe what was happening to you.”
Draco’s wringing his hands now, a nervous habit. He can’t seem to decide between looking at Harry’s eyes or his lips. He opens and closes his mouth a few times, and Harry waits, his hands slowly moving to Draco’s sides.
“‘Course not,” Harry replied, frowning. “Can’t exactly owl him, can I?”
Harry’s lips twitched, eyes still stuck on Draco’s hand in his as he shook his head. “That curse was bullocks, and you know it,” he mumbled. “You knew me before ever entering my head. Lucius just wanted my memories, my knowledge.”
give me Veritaserum. I drank it myself, and had him write out his questions, which I had to answer truthfully as I read them. It works the same, no matter how the questions are delivered.”
"Mum, it's alright. You're Scorpius' grandmother, not a babysitter. I'm sure Pansy would love to have her nephew over for a bit. Worst comes to worst, he can just come with me," I said. Mother still seemed unsure, but after assuring a second time that it was fine, we said goodbye and called Scorpius back down the stairs.
"You..?"
" It was screeched so loud I damn near plugged my ears. Instead, holding onto the facade my mother had raised me to have, I simply cringed. Speaking of Mother...

Ginny looked almost miserable as she and Harry interlocked their hands, getting into position to make an unbreakable vow.
"Don't nod at me, Draco! I deserve an explanation!" I couldn't bring myself to meet his eyes.
"I love you, amour," He said. I let out another scream, this time of absolute terror as I watched him whisk away in a swirl of green flames, throwing the picture onto the floor as hard as I could, sobbing into a mess on the floor.
"A poppy seed, really?" Harry said, an eyebrow raised.
I didn't.
I thought about back when I lost Harry.
Hermione ran to the boy, hugging him to her chest, rubbing the back of his head.
Soon, Ginerva and Harry had joined us in the kitchen, chatting about something or another, and I flicked my hand to turn on the kettle.
"Yes, my love," I gasp as he grabs me by my knees and pushes them onto the bed beside me. My thighs ache beautifully and I moan when I feel him position himself at my entrance.
My scream let out a huge wave of magic, knocking over everyone. The rage and horror of my baby being taken were enough to make me emit something horrible and I couldn't care as I held Scorpius in my arms, soothing him as I stroked his hair.
"Say sorry," He demands, pointing at me. Harry looks at me. The entire jury has been silent the entire time. I can hear Pansy failing to suppress giggles.
"Fucks sake, Ma!" Harry tucks his head into his hands.
"All I wanted was you,"
I'm so sorry for the short chapter! When I wrote this on Wattpad (DBubbleDiscoKween) I had a case of writer's block with the story but I wanted to give out some content. The next chapter is the finale!
"I can't help that I'll miss you, honey," Teddy physically cringed and Draco laughed, ruffling the turquoise hair.

Malfoy had gotten her nose pierced over the summer before the eighth year and the silver hoop wrapped itself around the bottom of her nose on the right side. Hailee often over-heard her talk to Parkinson and Zabini about getting a belly-button piercing and Hailee couldn't help but think about all the ways she could tease Malfoy's navel.
"Fuck, I'm gonna-"
Be careful reading this, Loves. It has detailed information of suicide.
And a moment later, a panting Harry ran into the room.
I looked and Harry and we nodded in unison.
"But I wouldn't have it any other way," Scorpius said. He raised his champagne flute and gestured to where Harry and I sat.
"I missed you so much," He said. He slowly reached his hand out, slowly grabbing mine in his grasp. I let him.
Finally, with a deep breath, I turned to Ginerva. She wore a sulk that made me want to cringe in disgust.
"Well, I'm here," She said. I let out another sob.
(See the end of the chapter for
He finally made it down the small aisle, stopping at Harry's open casket before letting the tears fall.
Reaching above my head, I opened a cabinet and pulled out one of the small plastic bowls we bought exclusively for James and Teddy. They were unbreakable (unless one of them cast an accidental
I let out a shuddering breath I didn't know I was holding. I glanced at Harry. I saw him swallow as he looked back at me.
After all the training in the DA, after fighting dementors in the third year, not one person, not even Luna, who never lost hope, could produce a Patronus.
"What would you say, Harry?" Draco tightened his grip on Harry's hand, watching as his husband sighed.
"He's..?" Harry couldn't form a sentence. I just nodded.
"Mr. Potter, I think it's time for the baby," The Healer, Healer Marshell, said, walking into my room. I shook my head violently.
in the room.

"Whenever you want,".
This was too short for an ending but I don't think our kiddos would want to say too much when their daddy dearest died. I cannot imagine a 57-year-old Teddy Lupin but use your imagination. This is set in the year 2055, people.
"Harry-"
"Do NOT make me repeat what I just had to say."
I mouthed back.
"I'm so sorry, Dray," He said the moment the door closed behind us. I refused to meet his eyes. I'd always forgive him quickly but not this time. Because this time he tried to take my son. And Scorpius was my life.
An hour later finds us back home. Before we've even made it over the hearth, I'm clawing at the light blue jumper I'm wearing, tearing it off before ripping the white button-down underneath it. My hands then reach for his shirt. I rip it off before he can say anything and then I'm grabbing him by the hips.
I looked to James now. He had begun crying again and I threw a nasty look at Ginerva, who still hadn't lowered her wand.
Draco stood up, said nothing, and left the table.
I laughed.
"Sorry?" I said slowly, inching into the room.
"Put a bloody shirt on," I hissed in his ear. He kissed my cheek and looked cautiously between me and Ginerva before turning on his heel to our bedroom, Teddy still in his arms.
Hope you enjoyed and thank's so much for reading! <3
After he exchanged words with the person on the other line, he gestured to the Healer's behind me. I turned.
"Please wait to scream at me until
"I'm sorry, Draco," He says softly.
"No!" I scream. Harry seems to snap into reality when Scorpius is in his arms and gathers his stuff, walking out the door.
"Ugh, Mum, stop. People are staring," Teddy wriggled from Draco's grip.
I was terrified that someone might've gotten to you," He said. My shoulders slouched.
"'Love you," He mumbled quietly, kissing my scalp gently, his lips lingering there for a moment or two more before he moves to rest his chin on my head.
When he finished, I grabbed the bowl and tossed it into the sink. Usually, I'd go ahead and clean it but I wanted to get to the living room. The yelling had simply gotten louder since I gave James his snack and I knew the only reason Teddy hadn't rushed into the kitchen crying was because of the silencing charm I'd put up between the living room and the boy's room.
Draco wasn't leaning onto Harry's shoulder.
No. She didn't.
Her red hair was tied into a ponytail and an awful red suitcase sat on the pavement beside her.
"Thanks again, Mo, we just needed a small break from these cuties," Harry ends his sentence by tickling Teddy's side, making the metamorphagus squirm, letting out a small squeal.
I used to do that when he had his nightmares.
"I'm sorry about Harry," Were the first words out of her mouth. I just looked at her.
"I... I brought a photo album," I say slowly, reaching into my bag and pulling out the baby blue book that contained hundreds of baby pictures of Scorpius.
Four months later, no one had seen nor heard from Ginny Weasley (which was fine by me). Our baby was growing by the day. In fact, today was the gender reveal party.
"Ginny, that man over there is my husband and I love him! I'm tired of you trying to put him down because of his past. We've all had a shitty past! You left your grieving family behind for six years for
That bitch thought Teddy meant her.
"Well, congratulations!" Molly said with a clap of her hands. Just like that, the tension was gone.
"GET OUT!" Harry roared. I flinched.
"Why did we send the boys away?" He questions and I walk backward, my index fingers hooked into the belt loops on his jeans.
"Hey- Malfoy?" She snapped.
"I'm not trying to poison you, you know?" I snapped. I threw a glance at her still untouched cup of tea.
"G'morning, Mummy,"
"I'll make you proud."
"'Mornin, Mum,"
I raised an eyebrow at him as I leaned down to spit the frothy toothpaste out and grabbed the cup I kept on my sink to rinse my mouth before giving it and my toothbrush a wandless cleaning charm. I stuck my toothbrush in the cup and kissed Harry's bare shoulder as I made my way out of our room.
"Seriously, Harry?" She said again, turning her eyesight to my husband, who looked a bit taken aback.
"Apparently, Mr. Malfoy is, in fact, non-guilty. You've also proven that you care enough about your son. Mr. Malfoy will have weekdays with Scorpius, Mr. Potter will have him for weekends. If you choose to spend time with each other Scorpius will be included," I sighed happily and smiled.
" He groans out, punctuating each word with particularly rough thrusts that have me throwing my head back as he hits my prostate.
"I don't care. We'll work whatever it is out, I want you, amour," My head spun. He would care. He'd been pissed when I told him about Scorp, even more, upset that I hadn't told him.
Boran inhaled sharply as his head snapped up, eyes wide with fear. “I’m sorry,” he said quickly, “I didn’t mean to!”
“Harry,” Draco said through clenched teeth. “Those muggles were

Draco made a haughty, gracious motion with his hand, like a benevolent king. “You’re welcome. Now, back to work.”

“I took the case.”
“Please, Draco, you’re practically drowning us in ennui.” Pansy smirked. Draco huffed a laugh.
He asked Willem about it, one night, after she had gone to bed.
He approached the glass for a closer look. They were some of the fanciest pens he’d ever seen, illuminated by spotlight and resting in velvet. The brass nibs were sharp and enticing, and they looked like a comfortable weight, inlaid with ornate swirls of mother of pearl.
doing,
“Draco,” Harry breathed, eyes and wand moving frantically around the room, lingering on the boy in the cell. “Where is he?”
“So tell me, Potter, what brings you to London? Surely you have a cozy country cottage somewhere, far from the madding crowds of city life?” Draco had had a few drinks already, and could feel Potter recoiling a little at his affectation. What did it matter, he didn’t have anything to lose. Besides, it was hard to take Potter too seriously when he was lightly sprinkled in glitter.
“Uh, what?” Harry felt his mouth falling open and hastened to shut it. “That you’re a Malfoy, or that you’re a bastard?”
But Draco didn’t seem to be bothered by it, in fact he was looking Harry up and down with a new level of interest, like he was a particularly delicious specimen of crème brulée.
“Family honor is really big with Malfoys, isn’t it.” Harry’s gaze was still fixed upon the scar, his fingers tracing automatically along the part that used to be a snake. “I can’t imagine being under that kind of pressure from my own parents, if they were still alive.”
Harry sniffled and wiped one sleeve across his nose. “No, I’m sorry. I don’t know why you set me off like that, I’m not normally this way.”
“I see. And if you don’t?”
Draco didn’t dare ask what that meant, given the darkling vibes he was getting from Feruza, so he chose instead to get up and look for a knife in the kitchen. When he returned, Harry looked supremely awkward in the presence of the two young women, who were half-clothed and getting increasingly grabby. Draco motioned him out into the hallway before they noticed his return. “All right, Harry?” He cocked his head toward the den. “I know you said this wasn’t something you would normally go for, but I think we’re about to have a classic hetero male fantasy situation on our hands.”
“I wouldn’t worry too much about that, Nigel is very understanding and wouldn’t want to interfere. You won’t be able to tell your friends about us though. Not Wizarding ones, anyhow, ones who could spread rumors.”
His train of thought was thankfully interrupted by Nigel, who wanted to propose a game of cards. “Wizarding cards, of course, since Godric knows we don’t spend a lot of time with Wizards these days.” After some discussion, they landing upon Exploding Snap. Nigel wanted to make it strip Snap, but Harry’s shifty-eyed reaction and Draco’s eye-roll put the kibosh on that idea. Draco got up and left for the den to find the cards, and while Nigel gathered up the dishes to transport to the kitchen for cleaning, Harry felt compelled to follow Draco.

The weight on his lower back lifted, and Draco cleared his throat. “There, it’s done. Now roll over.”
“So Potter doesn’t want to be a Wizard.” There was a feeling of cognitive dissonance that he couldn’t shake when he thought of the Boy Who Lived choosing to ignore his fame and fortune made in the Wizarding world, in favor of living anonymously among Muggles. Maybe there was poetic justice in it, but Draco felt more annoyed by it than anything. Here he was, forced more or less into an exile made sweeter only by superficial comforts, and yet someone who was at least partially responsible for Draco’s misfortune would deny himself the endless sweetness available to him. What an effing idiot.
Harry could not refrain from rolling his eyes, but he went along with their instructions anyway. After much hemming and hawing and consulting of images on Nigel’s magically retro-fitted flip phone, they were able to land on an agreement to purchase six of the ten pieces, for an eye-smarting seven thousand pounds.
“Hey. That’s not fair. I wasn’t being insufferable, I was being sensible, you git.” Draco had had enough of tea and crumpets. “Do you know how much my family still looks down on Muggles and Muggle-borns?” He thought he saw a shift in Hermione’s body language when she noticed that Draco hadn't used the word Mudblood in her presence, and felt a tiny surge of triumph. “They tolerate them now because they have to, and because I’ve been studying them. But I don’t know how well they would react to hearing that I’ve been seeing Harry.”
Harry thought to himself.
Gradually she became less confrontational, as Harry went through much the same explanation he had offered to Hermione, but with fewer awkward pauses and filler sounds. Listening to him, Draco had the strange feeling that he was almost enjoying himself, now that he’d had a chance to try out the words.
“Suit yourself, Harry. Thanks for taking me up on your broom, it was fantastic.”
“It doesn’t matter. You’re a Gryffindor, remember? Courage before cunning, and all that?” Draco felt himself lapsing into flippancy, one of his many nervous habits, and tried again. “I know I’ve been leery of sharing anything about us with people outside of your trusted inner circle, but lately I’ve been thinking that a public coming-out might be just the thing to corner my mother into accepting it.”
He watched her settle into his chair, and regretted the lack of cushion, given her condition. Six months of pregnancy had slowed her down a bit physically, but mentally she was still as sharp as ever. Settled, she leaned forward and steepled her hands over the one clear patch on Harry’s desk. “I don’t believe I’ve told you that I’ve been keeping up a correspondence with a – mutual acquaintance of ours.” Harry noticed her hesitation and looked at her with puzzlement. “A certain, blond gentleman. Fancies himself an alchemical scholar, among other things.” Seeing no spark of recognition, she sighed. “Draco.”
“About bloody time,” she retorted when he apologized for calling so late. “Do you know how excruciating it is, having to hold in a secret like this around Ron and the Weasleys?”
Harry and Draco exchanged glances. “Actually, yes, she does.”
Draco still felt ruffled, but making fun of him did seem to serve a purpose by breaking the tension in the room, and Ron finally let down his guard enough to engage in actual conversation with Harry, aided by generous refillings of his glass from Hermione.
They reiterated for her what they had come up with during their kitchen conversation, which was more or less the same thing with slightly different variations. Besides the general theme of unity, Draco’s main point he wanted to get across was to show everyone how he had changed for the better, while Harry wanted to use it as an opportunity for dispelling fear and distrust among Wizards, by offering them a possible alternative. Listening to him, Draco was overcome with a double wave of shame and admiration. Why couldn’t he get in the habit of thinking altruistically like Harry did?
They undressed in a state of feverish disconnect, as the world around them swirled and bulged and changed shape in the candlelight that had mysteriously filled the room. Draco paused as he remembered something and looked back to the doorway, but saw no one and eventually returned to devouring Harry.
Harry was gratified, and grudgingly offered him a smile. “I did think you had crossed the line that day. But I appreciate you buying me all those clothes, you really didn’t have to.”
Draco looked at him sideways. “Yes, Harry, he does occasionally frequent the sleepy hamlet of London on this tiny island called England. Why, is that going to be a problem?”
Draco’s eyes snapped open, drawing a soft shriek from Hermione. “What in Salazar’s name have you done to me, you hag?” he hissed at her, reminding Harry strongly of a bristling cat. His gaze shifted to Harry. “Your head. What happened, did
Harry closed his eyes and hummed contentedly, then fixed his gaze on Draco’s again. “Say it again, like you really mean it.”
She set down her bag with a thump and closed the door behind her. Harry gingerly peeled the towel off and turned his head the other way while she inspected the wound. The sharp pain was still there but was now offset by sensations of throbbing and burning. At least his hearing didn’t seem to be all that affected. But he felt weaker the longer he tried to stand, and eventually asked Hermione if they could sit.
Harry’s lips were a white line in his face. Draco felt sorry for bringing up such a sore point for Harry, but he wasn’t about to take an insult like that lying down. Instead of responding, Harry turned on his heel and resumed walking, his head bowed. Draco had to pick up his pace a little in order to keep up with him.
They both held to their word. Within minutes of arriving at the department store a few days later, much to Harry’s relief, Ginny and Draco reached a truce and had struck up a lively discussion on the relative merits of Alexander McQueen versus most French designers of
She looked as if she would like to say a great deal more, but Harry signaled to her that the moment had passed by turning back to correcting Auror exams.
Miffed, Draco did something he hadn’t done in a while and poured himself a drink, a proper G and T with a swirl of elderflower syrup. Feeling somewhat assuaged, he lounged in a chair in the den, picking idly at a bowl of pistachios and flipping through the latest issue of Têtu. One of the side effects of working at a Muggle bookshop, as part of his immersion program, was the gradual creep of Muggle books and publications into his home, and Têtu was at the top of his list of preferred bedtime reading, when he wasn’t studying various texts on alchemy, potions, and Muggle history.
Harry’s demeanor changed, and he sprang out of bed. “Draco, let’s try the spell again.”
There was a cluster of people on the edge of the green, and Harry walked up to them to ask for directions. “Excuse me,” he began, before realizing what he had walked into. They looked tense and fearful, and one of them had a knife drawn. “Sorry lads, what’s going on here?”
Harry wiped the grease off his hand and shook Brandon’s, which was warm and exerted just the right amount of pressure. “It’s Harry. Nice to meet you.”
Polite?
“Right back at you, mate,” said Ron with a grin, patting Harry’s back as they separated. “You’ve been entirely too successful at hiding away, ever since you and Ginny split.” His gaze turned away from Harry and landed upon Draco, which had the remarkable and instantaneous effect of snuffing out his smile. “Malfoy.”
he wondered.
“Why is it so bloody cold in here?” Draco complained when they had removed their outer layers and shoes in the hallway. He placed a hand on a wall device that Harry didn’t recognize. When he asked Draco about it, he explained that it was a Wizarding thermostat that read and adjusted to the occupant’s body heat, rather than predetermined settings that were not always accurate. “Based on how chilly my hands are, this place is about to get very warm indeed.”
, Harry thought to himself, but decided not to mention how turned on he was by last night’s events. Instead, he reminded Draco that they had plans to make for their next outing. They traded ideas back and forth until they landed on visiting a new exhibit on Surrealist art at the Tate Modern. Harry thought the subject of the exhibit – “Desire Unbound” – was a bit suggestive, reflecting that it might put them both in a frame of mind to kiss each other again.
Harry had gotten used to the designer references by now, and smiled at that. “You should probably lay off on the swearing, but I’m pretty sure you can wear whatever you want.”
History-making, it turned out, took a lot more planning than Harry would have thought. He had given interviews before and made a few too many public appearances in the past few years for his personal comfort, but with Draco involved, everything was ratcheted up to a new level of perfectionism. It bordered on mania, and Harry would have put a stop to it if he didn’t know how important it was to him.
“All right, Draco, you must be hungry by now. Let me serve up some dinner.”
“Sorry.” Her look was sincere with a trace of amusement. “I just wanted to help, and make sure you’re safe while you discover more about this part of yourself. And, if you ever do need help, please don’t hesitate.”
“Since we became friends, you silly bint.” Draco had reemerged with a vengeance, dressed in the same clothes as yesterday, which was a first. His hair was still drying in waves around his face, giving him the paradoxical look of a Nordic metalhead dressed in designer loungewear.
“Let’s take a wee look at you, Mr. Potter,” said the taller of the two, a black-haired Witch with a strong Scottish accent. After some intense inspection by both ordinary and magical means, the medics offered him their recommendations and brought out a generous supply of potions and bandages for him to use over the next few days. “Has the missing ear been found?” the other one asked, a stocky fellow who was not much older than Harry.
Harry winced at the expression. “Some of my friends are hippogriffs, I’ll have you know.”
“Everything” happened to be a proper tea, complete with scones, biscuits, clotted cream, several varieties of jam, and tea you could practically stand a spoon up in. Harry accepted an offer of milk but declined sugar, and started with a scone slathered in clotted cream. “Mmmph. Wow, this is delicious.”
“It wasn’t so much an idea as an accident. I wanted to check out this place, I think you might have actually mentioned it once, the haunted pub in Camden Town?”
Harry held out the wand with a shaking hand. “Take it, please. I have no right.”
It was well into November, and their days together had taken on a routine of sorts. Draco admitted to himself that he rather liked having Harry there, to provide warmth and meaning in an otherwise boring and empty life. The novelty of living as a Muggle libertine had started to wear off by now, and he had begun to count down the days to when he would be able to reclaim his full power as a Wizard again. If it weren’t for the periodic arguments, he might consider what he and Harry had to be almost perfect.
Harry stood before his closet, which by contrast did not lack for space because he had failed to fill it with clothing. One side had robes and his old Quidditch gear, which took up a lot of room, but the other side was decidedly more sparse, and it was from there that Harry chose his armor for the evening. Today, it would be – the forest green corduroy shirt with khakis? Or how about – a light blue jumper with a crew neck, layered with a T-shirt underneath? That looked better, once he switched to a pair of darker trousers. His socks were a little shabby, but it couldn’t be helped. He liked them because Mrs. Weasley had knitted them for him, covered with tiny Snitches.
“I think what prompted it was a realization of how limiting the Pureblood view is. In terms of the bigger picture of the human race. Just think about the ingenuity of Muggles, and how they managed to build up their world despite not having magic available to them, in the Wizarding sense of the word. Instead, they learned to look ever closer at the natural world, and to find logic and meaning in the patterns that seemed governed by the gods and planets in ancient times.” He sensed Harry’s eyes upon him, and tried to arrive at a clear point. “I guess what I’m trying to say is, Muggles have magic too, even if it looks different from what we have. And I wanted to learn more about it.”
“Harry, if you’re serious about letting bygones be bygones, you don’t have a choice but to hear some of the more intimate details of my life. Unless of course it’s a life-threatening secret.”
Draco was, as usual, dressed to perfection. This time, he had chosen a dark blue theme, or at least that was what Harry gathered before realizing that he might be staring and awkwardly stepped aside to let Draco in. His shoes were black loafers, and Harry almost forgot his newfound resolution to stop wearing shoes in the flat, until Draco stepped out of them. “You can just put them next to the door,” he muttered. Draco complied, then started to take his blazer off, and Harry had a moment of panic when he realized that he didn’t have a coatrack. “Let me take that for you, I can hang it in the closet.”
Hermione, who had left the kitchen to its own devices while she mixed herself a second drink, seemed to have grown determined to make Draco feel included. “I’ll have you know that Draco has been a perfect gentleman to me, ever since we cleared up our little misunderstanding about Harry’s injury the other day. Hasn’t called me a Mudblood once.”
“Was he now?” Harry’s eyebrows had disappeared into his fringe, and Draco wanted badly for him to wipe that saucy grin off Ginny’s face. He was not used to being emasculated by a woman he could snap in half like a stick of peppermint, although she would definitely scorch his mouth in the process. “Well, did he also tell you that he can produce a full Patronus, even though he was never taught how at Hogwarts?”
The pause that followed was a little too weighted, and Draco swallowed, feeling stupid. She smiled encouragingly. He cast about for words that would help him to look better in her eyes, without letting go of his deeply ingrained principles.
Except, of course, for flying. He snuck out at night sometimes, broom in hand, endowing his glasses with night vision if he had trouble seeing. Sometimes he made a game of it, practicing his stealth skills by flying into areas where he could very easily be spotted. Other nights, he chose instead to Apparate to the countryside, and flew over quiet hills and lakes shimmering with stars. Those were the times he still felt happy that he was a Wizard.
Hermione shook her head. “No, don’t you see? The public is blinded as far as you’re concerned. To them, you can do no wrong. It has to start with Draco, so they can begin to see past the shadow cast over him by Lord V and his cronies. Use your light to shine it on him.”
He couldn’t explain to his therapist what it felt like, being able to call Harry a friend. She had probably never heard of him, unless indirectly by reading a highly fictionalized book series about him, which had developed a surprisingly large following among the Muggles. Yet there he was, trying to explain to her the unexplainable.
“Are you sure you all don’t want to come inside? The ball is still happening, but if you don’t feel like socializing, I know a quiet place where you can stay while you decide what to do next.” She pointed toward the far side of the main building. “It’s an Unplottable dressing room that I use for storing our most expensive robes and gowns for photo shoots when we have celebrity guests to interview.” She smiled at him with the familiar dreamy expression that Harry once might have mistaken for a schoolgirl crush. “No interviews this time, I promise.”
“Honestly Potter, the only things that have kept me sane are clothes, books, and records. Oh, and men. Mostly Muggles.”
He nodded, not trusting himself to speak as he cast a quick glance at Draco, who was deliberately not looking at him. Narcissa, on the other hand, was only too willing to make eye contact, with a cool, haughty stare. It was the first time Harry had noticed how much of a resemblance there was between her and Draco, in the angular contours of her face and the way her eyes glinted in the late afternoon light.
“What I don’t understand is how the attacker disabled the wards on Apparition.” Hermione couldn’t seem to turn off her analytical brain, even though she had been taken off the case due to too many other work responsibilities and a possible conflict of interest, given her close relationship with Harry. “Most public events with celebrity guests in the Wizarding world are much more heavily guarded.” They were seated together in the audience stands, while the members of the Wizengamot trickled in to take their places at the front of the room.
Malfoy had a slight curl to one side of his mouth, and Harry felt ready to relax a little.
When he brought his gaze back up to Harry’s, there were no words left to be said. The conversation continued in the form of brazen gestures and subtle modulations of heat and breath, building layer upon layer of fervor until even coherent thought became difficult. Harry found himself gasping for air as Draco worked his way down his body, then worked his way back up to gently but insistently enter into Harry. Harry took it with a shuddering groan of pleasure, leaning back with closed eyes to melt into a puddle of white-hot sensation as Draco made slow, torturous movements with his cock and fingers. They went on like this for quite a while, Draco pulling back several times as Harry drew too close to the brink, until he was practically begging Draco to finish him off.
Hermione sighed again. “He’s fine. I thought you didn’t want to discuss anything personal about him though. Ever since – you know – the break-up.”
Harry stood up and crossed the room to sit on Draco’s bed again. “But don’t you see, they’re an important part of it too.” He tried out his most winning look on Draco. “I know you’ve never gotten along with the Weasleys, but you have to admit that they are in a more powerful place than you right now. The Prophet isn’t even publishing our interview tonight, they decided to pursue Ginny’s story instead. We might get a mention, but at this point we’ve got nothing to lose.” He emphasized the point by pushing the tray aside and moving closer, to place both hands on Draco’s arms, which felt cool to the touch. “You seem to connect with Ginny just fine, and you did help save her life, after all. Do it for her.”
Draco tried to seem nonchalant, to cover up the unease he truly felt. “Harry hasn’t mentioned it, no. I’m not sure what his status is with the Ministry at the moment, after taking leave.” He tucked his hair behind one ear. “I’m sure he’ll tell me if it’s important to him. Right now we prefer to keep things on the down-low.” He looked straight at Ginny. “I’m sure you understand how that goes.”
The flight was marvelous, even more so than circling Friendship Lake. Harry took them on a slow winding route along the Thames, looping around to look closer at places of particular visual interest. He even swooped in to inspect one of the capsules of the Millennium Wheel, which had gone dark in the early hours of morning. “Did you know that there’s no capsule number thirteen?” Draco informed him. “And that each capsule represents a different borough of the city?”
He couldn’t help but chuckle in disbelief at his lame joke and Draco’s reaction, as delightful as it had been. Where had that impulse come from? Kissing aside, the real question on Harry’s mind was, did Draco view Harry as just another friend with side benefits? Or did he have different, more inscrutable designs on him?
Harry’s perception of time had narrowed and warped until he was no longer conscious of having a body. All he could focus on was the imminent danger that Ginny was in, and how he might remove her from that danger. The first thought that popped into his head was
Draco didn’t ask him to elaborate. “To answer your other question, I’m not sure who set up the display, but I can certainly find out for you.” He turned away but was cut short by Potter’s hand on his arm.
Nigel smiled. “I know just the thing, how about a virgin Cosmo?”
. The build-up to the first penetration was the biggest challenge for Draco, who felt like he might come at any moment from watching Harry react to the tantalizing encroachment of fingers and tongue. He seemed lost in his own world by then, stroking away as Draco hitched up Harry’s legs and hooked them over either shoulder. Draco wanted to be fully present for him as they went through this new experience together, whether it landed perfectly or not, and he only began to thrust in earnest once it became clear that Harry was enjoying himself, his eyes mossy green and half-lidded with desire. He tried to draw it out as much as possible for Harry’s benefit, but it felt like no time at all before they were both roaring in climax.
(See the end of the chapter for
He was facing away from her as he lay on the couch, but couldn’t help craning his head around after hearing her reply. “Sure, I’ve heard it mentioned. Isn’t it the title of the first book in that Harry Potter series?”
Harry banked and began a lap around the lake, which glimmered darkly in response to the stars above. A breeze had kicked up and whistled past Draco’s ears, making him wish he’d picked out a cap from Harry’s closet, no matter how dreadful. He settled instead for flipping up the collar on Harry’s coat, which seemed to help a little.
Harry would not be diverted. “I’m serious, I was not in a good place mentally a year ago. I still wonder if I should see a therapist again, give Hermione a break.”
As if she had heard his thoughts, Hermione asked how the night flying was going. She and Ginny were the only ones who knew about it, although Harry had toyed with the idea of telling Ron. But he always stopped at the thought of how hurt Ron might be, that he went flying without him. Ron’s current side gig, on top of working part-time for the Ministry, was as an advisor to a company that designed brooms and provided equipment to professional Quidditch teams. The opportunity had opened up for him after Ginny joined the Holyhead Harpies and turned Weasley into a household name.
Harry had reached Draco’s side and took one of his hands with determination. “Look, I know it’s probably not what you want to hear, but Draco and I are seeing each other now.”
Harry had been invited to the annual Christmas Ball for Ministry employees and friends, and he had decided to bring Draco as his date. Which was how they found themselves wearing their finest and most outrageous dress robes as they hurried to enter the building where the Ball was being held. It was such an odd yet familiar sight to see each other in robes again, they didn’t know what to say, and made the climb up the stairs in silence.
But their progress was slow. Draco seemed much more interested in teasing Harry this time around. He started by kissing Harry once on each eyelid, then very tenderly undressing them both, punctuating each removal with a new kiss until they were standing in a naked state of arousal before each other.
They concluded the session not long after, and Draco shook her hand in thanks. “It might be a little while before our next meeting,” he informed her. “I have some personal things I need to attend to.”
Draco’s mood soured. “Don’t know. It’s been a while, why do you want to know?”
He had a skylight, which he was used to climbing through on his own, but he wondered how it would work with Draco there. He instructed Draco to climb up the ladder steps that led to the loft area beneath the skylight.
They segued into dancing once they'd worked the room a couple times, making introductions for Draco where necessary (no introductions were needed for Harry, of course). The dancefloor was crowded enough that Harry didn’t feel too self-conscious with Draco. As he looked around, he saw that a few other couples dancing were also male, one of which looked familiar. He squinted through his new glasses to bring them into focus. “Say, Draco, who is that couple over there, do we know them?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Her words did not have the intended soothing effect on Draco, as he felt a resurgence of the regret he’d felt when he realized that he’d rejected the one person that you were never supposed to reject - an actual if mildly flawed hero who'd told you he loved you. And over what? An innocent misunderstanding about whether he’d cast a Killing Curse in self-defense, and a misplaced sense of filial duty? That was all it amounted to, really, and Draco felt like a prize idiot every time he thought about it, even if he had been rejected in his offer to come back to Harry eventually. He couldn't blame Harry for his reaction, not really.
Harry picked at the buttons at his sleeves. “You’re probably right, it’s way too tight for comfort. The material is great though, maybe I should look for a different size?”
It couldn’t have taken more than fifteen minutes for them to prepare for his departure, after hugging Ginny goodbye and shaking hands with Feruza. Harry however felt like it took forever, such was his haste to see Draco and verify with his own eyes that he was all right.
off for laughing. When Draco recovered and explained that it was the name of the artist who had taken the photo, he blushed at his mistake. “Sorry, I guess I am an idiot after all.”
“Sorry love, we have to get everything set up. You’re welcome to enjoy breakfast upstairs in private though, we won’t need to get you into the chair until around lunchtime.”
It was as if their lusty encounters had opened up a whole new channel of communication between them. Draco found himself wanting to know more about Harry’s experience of living as a Muggle and as a reluctant celebrity. Harry, on the other hand, was surprised to find that he actually cared what Draco thought about things that were a bit beyond his understanding, such as art and music.
At that moment, the Boy Who Lived was trying his very best not to die. Metaphorically, of course. His days of living dangerously were over, at least for now, and he could probably count on one hand the number of times he had engaged in anything that might be mistaken as risky in the past year.
Ginny ran one hand over her face, as if to massage away years of weariness. “All I know is that she called me up late and said you needed a Mediwizard, right away. When I asked her for more information, all she would tell me is that you had an injury that needed immediate, and discreet, attention. She ended the spell before I could ask anything more. I didn’t sleep too well last night, but I didn’t want to disturb you until you’d had some rest.”
Draco couldn’t prevent his own eyes from going wide. “Er, isn’t it rather late?”
. There had been many painful episodes in his life, of course, but he still felt in quiet moments of self-honesty that falling in love with Draco and being rejected by him was at the top of the list. It had been more than a year since their last encounter, not far from where Harry now worked at the Ministry of Magic, and he still thought of it every time he passed that particular corridor. The desperation of their last kiss, and the deliberateness of Draco’s decision that had left Harry gutted and hopeless.
“I haven’t completely abandoned the possibility. I think I was actually pretty good at it, when I wasn’t boozing and turning up unconscious in foreign countries. I just couldn’t stand the weight of being, you know, me. The great Harry Potter, who defeated the Dark Lord not once, but twice. And died a little along the way.”
(See the end of the chapter for
.” His final word was accompanied by a gesture that caused Draco to close his eyes and curl his toes a little. He decided to shut up about threesomes and let Harry have his way instead.
And just like that, he was gone. Draco, left alone and shaking with unexpressed grief, could only fixate on the square of darkling blue sky at the end of the hallway as the seconds pulsed by. If he looked anywhere else, he didn’t know what would happen, such was the magnitude of pain that had infiltrated every corner of his being.
Harry stopped short and raised his eyebrows. “I’m sorry, did you say the two of you are
He turned to look toward the doorway one last time, and saw Ginny there still, feet planted firmly on the ground now, her red waves of hair flowing forward over her breasts. She was breathing more rapidly than usual after having climbed and descended from her own tower of lust, but when she saw Draco looking at her, she winked and walked away, hips and bare bottom swinging cheekily.
Harry shook his head, still staring at the floor. “No. No, I don’t think so, actually.” He wasn’t crying, as far as Draco could see, but the flat tone in his voice was more worrisome than any amount of tears would have been. “I haven’t been all right for a while, and now…” His voice trailed into nothing, and the seconds ticked by until Draco thought he would explode with tension. “This is utter shit. What we’ve been through, and how we’ve been living, and now you want things to go back to the way they were before? I know it was daft of me to think that you might have cast the curse, but what evidence was there otherwise?” He turned his head to look at Draco then, framed by his riotous hair and the crook of his elbow. “Hermione said that you must have done something to set off the misuse of magic alert. What was it?”
Draco had become very serious in the past few seconds. “Harry,” he intoned, still riding the drink wave, “Do you miss having pussy at your beck and call?”
Draco brought it up again anyway, once they had gotten into the magically concealed limousine provided by the Ministry. Rather than attempting to Apparate or Side-Along, it was easier to keep a bodyguard nearby for Harry’s protection, which was most definitely needed given that it was his first public appearance in over a year.
His fingers were playing at the edge of Draco’s robe in a manner that would have been ticklish if it weren’t so close to one of Draco’s favorite places to be touched. Seeing Draco shiver, he grinned and lowered his head, pushing the robe aside. After trailing his mouth over skin for several delicious minutes, he brought his hands even lower to caress the outlines of Draco’s hips and thighs, studiously avoiding the hardness between. It was so much better to dance around the obvious sometimes.
Malfoy blinked. “How did you even know I’m gay, or that I would be in Soho last night? Are you spying on me, or something?”
Harry followed his trajectory, wrapping one leg possessively around Draco’s as he took himself back in hand and increased the pressure and speed of his strokes. Draco, swiftly coming to, pushed Harry’s hand away so he could bend down and resume working on Harry with his mouth, and this time, Harry was ready to let go. With gusto. The sounds that came forth from his throat were involuntary, as he poured out every last drop of pent-up lust into Draco’s throat, but Harry was too carried away to be embarrassed in the moment.
Harry pulled off his last remaining jumper and followed Draco to the den, adjusting his glasses. The soda was already beginning to work on him, if the intended effects were to sharpen his senses and make him feel more alert. “I think I like this better than the Felici-Fizz.” He didn’t like that they owed it to Nigel, though, something he would have rather died than admit out loud to Draco in that moment.
Harry shook himself out of it and turned on the light. Time to make himself a warm milk and watch something relaxing on his new DVD player before tucking himself into bed.
Harry’s voice dropped to a whisper. “Yeah, well how do you expect me to react? Last night we were, you know,
“Does he remind you of anyone else you know?”
He wanted to give as good as he had gotten, and so cast a lubricating charm to make his hand ready for Draco’s pleasure. It was more difficult this time, figuring out which direction and pressure to take with his strokes so that it hit Draco’s nerve endings just right, but Draco didn’t seem to be complaining as he closed his eyes again and threw back his head to expose his neck. Harry traced his tongue along its contours, working his well-oiled fingers until Draco was shaking and his breath came in short huffs. Right before tipping over the edge, his eyes snapped open and fixed upon Harry’s, which had been open all along as he watched him drown. “Harry  - I –
But Harry surprised him, yet again, by keeping it short and to the point. “The way I see it, Draco, we have a fantastic opportunity to change the course of history, even if we’re the only ones who know about it. I come from Wizarding blood too, not to mention that Sirius Black was my godfather, and I think we might owe it to them to make amends. Can’t you see?”
Harry wanted to tell him, but contented himself with holding Draco’s hand while they sat in the train car.
Ginny tilted her head to one side, pursing her lips comically. “So you’re a helpless little kitten then? Too cute.”
But Harry surprised him, yet again. “Hey Draco,” he said at the doorway, out of Nigel’s earshot, “this has been a fun night. Honestly, more than I could have expected.”
Harry shook his head in wonderment. “Blimey. No wonder your family’s been sorted into Slytherin for generations.”
Given that his previous testimony had led to Draco’s freedom, it was reasonable to hope that this time he would be just as lucky. However, there was the unfortunate fact that Draco appeared to have used an Unforgivable Curse. Even though the person he had killed was a deranged Quidditch fan who had been stalking Ginny and had clearly threatened lives by pointing a gun at her and other innocents, it did not look good.
, but he wasn’t sure it was wise to have wine about, after seeing how much Draco could drink. He settled instead upon pasta puttanesca, with rocket salad. He didn’t dare make a dessert after the pastry extravaganza of the day before, so he opted to buy a chocolate ganache cake from the bakery downstairs.
Once Feruza had left, Draco promptly became much more interested in playing with Harry’s ears. “Such funny little skin flaps,” he chortled as he flicked them back and forth. “Why do humans even grow them?”
Hermione’s brow was etched in concern, but the rising of the Wizengamot cut short any further conversation as the trial proceedings formally began. From what Harry understood about Wizarding law, there was no expectation for anyone called in for questioning to bring legal representation. The Malfoys being the Malfoys, however, had brought in someone to speak on his behalf. He suspected that money and not a love for Draco or his family was driving his solicitor, but he was impressed all the same at the care that had evidently been taken by his mother to protect Draco from his own bad choices.
, he told himself, and started to write again.
Draco took Philippe’s advice and barricaded himself in the bedroom after putting together a tray of breakfast. Harry, incredibly, was still asleep, and Draco indulged in a moment of watching him. The vulnerability etched upon his face, in the slack lines of his jaw and the slight frown of his brow, was too much. He leaned in for the lightest of kisses, and Harry’s eyes fluttered open.
There was a trail of blood steadily dripping behind him, and he couldn’t help but think of what a nightmare it would be to remove the stains.
Draco felt an eerie sense of déjà vu at her choice of words, and shivered. It wasn’t until much later in the conversation that he realized why they had resonated with him. They were an echo of the words in his dream, when he had first met his Patronus.
After the chorus of “Hear hear’s” that followed, Draco was not to be outdone. He felt more than a little tipsy as he stood up, and placed one hand on Harry’s shoulder to steady himself. “I’m not usually one to overshare, but I have to say that this man here means the world to me. I may be a Slytherin and a former Death Eater and a haughty ocelot, but I’m proud to be associated with Harry. Even if it means putting up with his insufferable Gryffindor friends.” He thought about that sentence for a bit, then corrected it. “Present company excepted. And Ginny.” The words did not come out in as suave a manner as he had hoped, but the effect seemed to be a positive one, if the tears rolling down Hermione’s cheeks were any indication. “Anyhow, cheers.” He sat down more forcefully than he intended, but Harry’s warm kiss reminded him why he had stood up in the first place.
Harry managed a shaky grin. “You wish. I’m home now, just having a spa day in my shower. Care to join me?” Too late, he remembered that Hermione could show up at any moment. He also remembered that he really missed Draco.
As if he’d read Harry’s mind, Draco turned his blindfolded face toward him. “Don’t worry about impressing me, Harry, just go with whatever comes up in your mind. You can do anything you want.”
Harry picked up another bottle after handing the open one to Draco. “No offense, mate. How about – to making new friends out of old enemies.”
But first, food. The tray Draco brought was laden with sausage and eggs and tomato and crumpets and a pot of the strongest tea imaginable, couched in a tea cosy that looked like a –
‘Damn you, Potter,” Draco whispered, feasting upon the sight of him. Draco was almost completely exposed now, wearing a pair of black silk boxers and nothing else, and Harry could see the outline of him aching to be released. He was only too happy to oblige by carefully lowering Draco back down toward the ground. Touching himself while Draco was looking at him like that was making him harder than he had ever been in his life.
He had to remind himself of the uncomfortable conversation he’d had with Narcissa Malfoy when she had showed up the morning after he stayed with Draco at the hospital. She had coldly informed him that she didn’t trust Harry enough to keep Draco out of trouble while he was in such a tenuous position. To her, it was important that Harry stay away until Draco was proven innocent. The tone in her voice was as close as Harry had ever heard to begging, even while she looked at him with distaste. He suspected that she might have been behind the pulling of the Prophet interview, with the help of mysterious ties to the media circuit, which meant that she most likely knew about the relationship between him and Draco already. It was only out of respect for Draco's wishes that he held himself back from dismissing her entirely.
Draco wiped away imaginary tears and paused enough to draw breath. “Oh, I’ve picked one out already. I’ve been using it ever since I started this Muggle immersion program, although I tend to go by Draco anyway, like it’s a nickname.”
“Draco, I – “
Harry thought of similar conversations between him and Draco.
when I return.”
“I like him already, I’ve been telling you to overhaul your wardrobe for years.”
Draco recognized Ginny the moment she stepped into the bookshop. Her companion he did not recognize, but judging from her height and muscular build, he guessed that she was one of Ginny’s teammates, possibly the subject of the various rumors swirling around Ginny’s love life. The vibe between them was casual, to Draco’s eyes, so he did not assume that the rumors were correct.
They were still holding hands when the limo rolled to a stop. Draco gulped and exchanged glances with Harry once last time before they emerged, shadowed by their bodyguard Trevor, a massively wide human who looked like he might have troll blood.
The activity at hand, however, was threatening to match the body count of the Battle of Hogwarts. Why was it that so many Muggle video games insisted on making even the simplest task as dramatic as possible? The arcade manager had said that the games were retro and easy to play, which made Harry think he might have a chance at winning, but he had not counted on the number of flames and gore that came with them.
It was only when he lay sweating on top of Harry, slowly stroking and thrusting their way into tingling oblivion, that he remembered once more the two women he had invited into his home earlier that evening. The thought turned his head back to the doorway, and he saw with a jolt of electricity that Ginny was there, doing something that made his mind stop a little. She was
Her proposition was met with varying degrees of interest. Harry looked cornered and probably would have said no, except for the gleam in Draco’s eye that signaled his growing desire for adventure. Feruza didn’t seem to care much one way or another, but Ginny insisted that it would make things much less boring, and she agreed in the end to go along with Ginny’s suggestion. “As long as we do not go back to the hotel,” she stipulated. “I do not have a good history with the Belmont.”
Harry nodded and started toward Hermione, who was conferring with the new Auror and Ginny while Feruza lurked in the background, now wearing ordinary Muggle clothing. He noticed that Luna was still rifling through the robes on the rack, and he decided to approach her first.
Harry nodded wordlessly, battling a host of emotions that he did not want to reveal. He wondered why he felt hurt, as if he were being left out on some great secret, when as far as he knew, he did not see men that way and least of all Draco. Simmering just below the hurt was a hint of curiosity at what might go on behind closed doors for men who enjoyed each other’s bodies. He had a general idea of what could happen, but lacked the final spark of desire that would make him want to pursue it.
It was but the work of the moment to walk to a discreet distance and Summon his broom, which came rushing toward him after several minutes had passed. Sometimes he felt like she was akin to an animal companion, and in that spirit, he stroked her tail of streamlined twigs lightly. “Good girl. Let’s go on another ride with Draco.”
The chill followed them through their journey across London, and seemed to have settled into Draco’s home once they arrived there. Besides getting held up at the turnstiles, Draco had done an admirable job of navigating, and Harry felt almost familial in his pride.
He tried it a few times while Draco looked on, still cracking up periodically, then lost his nerve when the two women entered the hallway. In their current state of undress, Harry imagined it would only take a few choice words to get them the rest of the way out of their clothing. But he didn’t want to do it, for their sakes. He was too much of a gentleman.
Harry could hear a sharp edge to Draco’s voice, and he supposed he deserved whatever resentment Draco might be feeling toward him. Harry was the one who had left during their last argument, after all, and Harry was the one who had refused to speak to him out of a misguided sense of personal honor. “I haven’t done much of anything really, just played a shitload of video games trying to distract myself from feeling miserable. I finally had enough of staying inside and went to an arcade in Camden, then got hungry and went to a bar with drag queens.”
The bell over the door tinkled as he entered, and Draco paused as he breathed in the comforting smell of polished leather and new paper. The bookshop was just posh enough that he could forgive the clientele for being mostly Muggle students, and he was relieved that it had not yet stooped to the level of a Starbucks or other bookshop-café hopefuls that attracted mobs of the caffeine-addled. Give him a good cup of tea anytime, without the fuss of a barista making fancy patterns in his milk.
“Trust me.” Harry’s hands came up to cradle Draco’s face. Draco didn’t stop him, but tightened the grip on Harry’s shirt, his face twisting with conflicting emotion. Harry could feel the fists shaking against his chest. “Just, trust me. Please, Draco.”
His offensively ginger hair had grown long and wavy, just past his collarbone, and his freckles seemed to blend in with a couple days’ growth of slightly darker stubble on his jaw. There were hints of old scars on his hands and neck, which Draco could see with the top two gold buttons of his uniform undone. His Head Auror badge was pinned crookedly on the left side of his chest.
Harry shook his head in response.
“I don’t know what you’re playing at, Malfoy, but I’m not in the mood for an intellectual debate—”
“Don’t let her out of your sight,” he said. Ron rolled his eyes.
better in your dulcet tones.”
His pale face was flushed with exertion, his sleek hair sticking to his forehead with sweat.
Willem watched from the doorway, biting his lip, his greying brows knit with worry.
Timsy stood there, looking furious, but not as furious as Pansy Parkinson, who was holding on to his left hand, while Narcissa Malfoy held his right, looking like death warmed over. Harry’s blood ran cold.
“Are you alright?” Draco asked. Harry took a deep, stabilizing breath and clasped his hands together in his lap to keep them from shaking, but he nodded all the same. Draco quietly called Timsy for hot chocolate, which he brought with his typical unnatural speed. Harry took his mug gratefully, closing his eyes and sipping it carefully. Draco simply watched him, deep in thought, cradling his own mug in his hands.
The wizard continued staring for a moment, open-mouthed, reminding Draco of a fish, until Draco raised one imperious eyebrow. The man shook himself and cleared his throat, finally handing back Draco’s wand.
When Draco Malfoy got up in the air with Harry, he was the same sneering twelve-year-old, in the body of an attractive man, with a few more tricks up his sleeve.
Kingsley, I told you to
Harry doubled over, clutching his stomach. He couldn’t remember the last time he had laughed this hard, and he was laughing in the middle of Draco Malfoy’s garden—at and with Draco Malfoy himself, no less. He wasn’t sure whether he should tell Malfoy that the muggles thought of vampires as unnaturally attractive, superhuman beings who were enticingly moody and mysterious. Definitely not the vampires Malfoy was used to.
For a suspended moment, Draco remained frozen in ferret form, trying to figure out what the hell to say to Harry. Harry, who thought Draco was always so organized and put together, who thought Draco did important things all day instead of what Draco actually did—gave in to weird ferrety urges and missed his husband.

wants a cigarette. Where the fuck would he go? He groans under his breath, leaning his hands on the cold, grounding stone of the side of the pub, breathing in chilled, city air. He won’t go back to the Manor, like this, he feels ill, he feels
Three heads snapped up to stare at him in shock and alarm.
Willem insisted they stay with him, though there wasn’t much room at all in his small home. He offered his own bedroom to Narcissa, and let Harry transfigure his armchair into a cot for him.
Draco was shaking, he didn’t know if he’d
Kramer narrowed his eyes. “You two went to school together, didn’t you?”
His mind raced. That was definitely Malfoy, Harry would recognize him anywhere, though it had been a few years since he’d last seen him—he clearly wasn’t much of a threat, half-dressed in pyjamas, asleep. Malfoy had too much pride to fight him like
"I'm not angry," He assured in a whisper.
"I do live here," He said, sending a confused glance at me. I shrugged. We had an entire conversation with our eyes alone and I smirked as Ginerva gaped at us in confusion.
So pink, so pretty. I wanted to kiss him. I couldn't indulge in the kind of kiss I wanted right now, Mother would roll over and die, but I did press a peck to his lips. He grinned into the kiss and pressed his lips to mine.
Everything was perfect.
"There's Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin,"
I sat James down in his high chair and strapped him in, giving him a smile when he giggled and ran his chubby little fingers through my hair. I gave his forehead a quick peck before turning around to the fridge.
He would wake up next to me in a cold sweat and grab me tight, pulling me to him. I'd have to assure him I was alright, that they hadn't got me. Harry didn't have nightmares about Voldemort anymore, no. He had them about me. He said that every time he went to work, he would be terrified that he'd come back to find me in a pool of my own blood.
"I sent her to The Burrow, Molly can handle her," Harry said and I felt him lean down to press a kiss to my forehead. I smirked beside myself.
"Somethings up. The kids are asleep and I've blocked the Floo, talk to me," Harry's eyes are filled with a sense of determination. Draco was a good liar, many knew from experience. But not when it came to Harry. He could never lie to Harry.
I was the love of Harry's life.
"Now, I'll take those off when you two can learn that we don't fight with children in the house," With that, I took off down the hallway to the boy's room. Opening the door, I found Teddy coloring a picture. He looked up at me and smiled. I gave him a grin and sat James down in his playpen.
Well, this is the end of book 1. Phew, that was hella short. Okay, enjoy you guys
"Yes," With a flick of my hand, we're both naked and I switch our positions, flipping him onto his back on the bed.
"She's okay," She said, walking over to me and setting her on my chest. I let out a sob as I saw her. Her eyes were squinted tightly shut as she cried. She had a small patch of blonde hair on her perfect round head. Her skin was pale like mine and I decided she was the most gorgeous thing I'd ever laid eyes on.
Harry continued writing, the quill scratching against the parchment. Another teardrop fell onto the yellow paper.
We'd moved to Godrics Hollow after I had Lyra and I loved our house. Our neighbors, albeit fangirls at first, were sweet and kind. One of them had told Harry stories about his parents and I watched as his eyes filled with unshed tears and he'd thanked her tenfold.
There was a tent in the front yard with two bars, one serving champagne, the other with virgin drinks (mostly for Hermione, who was still breastfeeding, and me). Harry indulged himself in a glass or two of champagne, asking me if I was sure three times before he drank it. I wasn't an alcoholic or anything, but I did like a drink every now and then.
I didn't lie. 30 minutes later, I was out the door, no trace of me ever being at Harry's flat besides my smell on his sheets and the broken picture that lie in front of the fireplace.
Enjoy!
I just wanted Harry.
"Gross, Papa!" He yelled at Harry. Draco giggled, walking over to Teddy and picking the blue-haired boy up, he smushed kisses all over his cheeks, causing the 5-year-old to screech.
The blonde leaned up and kissed the dip in the middle of Hailee's collar-bone before closing her eyes and falling asleep.
My eyes fluttered closed and the hazy world turned dark grey, then black and the ringing of Harry screaming my name faded.
"Oh, thanks, Pops," Teddy, said, ripping one open. He froze and Draco smiled sadly at him.
I raised my hand to knock on the door when it swung open.
I made my way back into the living room and set the tray on the coffee table, handing Harry his saucer.
But now it was Monday, which I think everyone can agree is the worst day of the week.
"There, all clean!" I announced, throwing my hands in the air, smiling when Teddy did the same. I picked him up off the counter and sent him to his and James' room to put a shirt on and brush through his, now platinum blond, hair.
"Mum, you're embarrassing him," she whispered. The nine-year-old still had Draco's platinum blonde hair, which was currently in a ponytail.
Ginerva and Harry now sat on opposite sides of the couch and the second I walked into the room, Harry stood up and walked up to me, his eyes giving an apology he couldn't. I sighed.
"You know," I said, looking at him. His eyes held regret. True regret.
I turn to look at Harry for the first time. I'd walked down the aisle with Luna Lovegood on my arm and I made sure to keep my eyes looking anywhere but at Harry. I let them settle on Longbottom instead. He had walked down the aisle with Cho Chang and I couldn't help but wonder if she felt the same way I did.
"Harry, wait,"
(See the end of the chapter for
A beautiful silver stag erupted from his wand, it stayed for a good minute before Draco collapsed onto the floor, sobbing.
"Nice to meet you, sir," He said kindly. For a moment, I was scared Harry wouldn't respond. Instead, he stuck his arms out and invited Scorpius into a hug. Scorpius obliged happily, tossing himself into Harry's arms.
The crease in Weaslette's shoes as she lifted herself onto her tip-toes, the puckering of her ugly pink lips, the widening of green-eyes, Harry trying to lean away.
The door opens to reveal a tall, thin woman. Her nose is pointy with a chin to match, though they suited her perfectly. Her blonde hair reached her waist, half of it pulled into a ponytail in the back. Fly-aways framed her face and when her icy blue eyes met mine she smiled.
"That was great," Draco pants out. Harry collapses on top of him, letting Draco roll onto his chest. With a wave of Harry's hand, their come and sweat are gone and they simply feel the warmth radiating off one another.
"Much, thank you," I respond, pressing the palm of my hand to the warm skin underneath his left nipple. His tan skin is a stark contrast to my milky-white paleness and I stare for a moment, just looking at Harry's chest.
She and Harry had a teenage fling. Harry and I thought about marriage.
"I quit the second I got home," He told me. I stared at him.
"What?" The blond parrots, using his finger as a bookmark for the book he had been reading.
"I understand that not telling Harry about his son was wrong and I regret it. But what I don't regret was having that angel," I say, turning to look at him. Scorpius is looking at me again now. He's smiling, showing off his perfect baby teeth.
I turned to look at my god-son-in-law and huffed.
When I wake up again, I'm in my bed. I will my eyes shut as I feel the hardness of an all too familiar chest underneath me and a strong arm around my waist. The light of the sun is already peeking through the curtains that matched the dark blue color of our bedsheets,
"I love you too, Harry," I whisper the promise into his hair, kissing his scalp through the messy curls.
Pansy wasn't making jokes with Harry.
"Listen!" I cried as he pushed me towards the door.
"SO HELP ME GOD, IF YOU WALK INTO THAT FIRE-" I screamed, running after my boyfriend as he made his way to the floo. He turned around, grabbing my hands with his own. I was frantic, but the look on his face made everything better.
Hailee couldn't remember the first time she and Malfoy did it. They simply did.
"Thanks, Molly," I said with a smile.
"B-begin,".
You can find me and more of my works on Wattpad!
"That's enough!" I blinked as Harry jumped off the couch. His magic crackled around us. I glanced worriedly at Hermione, who sent a glance right back at me.
"I'm so sorry, Harry," I finished. Harry looked at the table, not meeting my eyes. His jaw was tense and I wanted the world to open and swallow me whole.
I laid him on the changing table and quickly changed him before slipping a new, softer onesie on.
Maisie had silver eyes and dark black hair. Jonah looked almost identical to Harry, green eyes, and black hair, although, that had been a choice. Jonah was born a metamorphagus and he and teddy would constantly bother their sisters with their powers, once tricking Laura into thinking that Maisie had somehow fallen off of Laura's tall wardrobe when, in reality, it was Jonah, crumpled up to look like he had broken a bone or two.
"Do what?" He asked. I rolled my eyes, pulling my hand from his grasp. I begin to walk to the door but Harry is faster, he steps in front of me and pulls me into his arms.
"Better than I thought, actually. We're meeting up for dinner later so I can explain better. You don't mind watching Scorp, do you?" I asked her.
, you Death Eater
But now, it was time to find out what the gender of my baby was now. Harry squeezed my hip and I smiled at him. He looked me right in the eye and I got caught up in
"Bye, Nana!" He called, throwing himself into Mother's arms. I wanted to scold him because, even with her beauty, my mother was getting older and more fragile. God forbid I say that out loud, I'll face the end of her wand.
Right now, Hermione, Ron, Pansy, and Blaise were on their way to DADA (Defense Against the Dark Arts).
"Gather 'round!" I let out a sigh. George, Ron, and Charlie were in charge of everything and, I did have to admit, they did a great job.
She wasn't as heartbroken as I was.
?" Andromeda had to stop my Mother from storming towards the ginger. I was about to say something when the woman's legs suddenly seemed to become jelly and she sunk to the ground.
"The boys are going to stay with Mother for a bit," I say, walking into our bedroom to quickly change my clothes.
"Nonsense, I hope your break was nice," She adds a wink as she stops talking, and Harry groans as I pull a mortified face.
I felt a hand on my back and jumped. Granger stood there, her hair in a neat bun. She wore a loose blouse and dark red leggings. She had on 3-inch heels that made her only about 2 inches shorter than me when she was usually about 5.
We're back in the courtroom, this time, I'm being prosecuted for "purposefully injuring ministry staff" which is absolute bullshit.
"Harry?" I turned and called into the house. He was by my side in an instant, wrapping an arm around my waist and looking at our unexpected guest.
Alarm blaring in my face, I felt Harry groan tiredly beside me. I moaned in annoyance and flicked the alarm off, flopping back down onto our bed and scooching into Harry's embrace. He was warm, like always.
Mother walked through the door and greets me with a large hug and kisses on both cheeks. She kisses Harry's cheek and demands that she see her youngest grandchild. Hermione smiles at Mother, who smiles right back, before passing James to her. Mother smiles at her grandson, who grins up at her, his little hands reaching up to take one of her blonde curls into his fist, Mother simply smiling down at him.
" My mouth fell open at that. So did Ginny's.
"But what if the secret is so bad that you would possibly hate me from keeping it from you. That you'll never want to see me again," I said, begging him to understand how serious this was. Then he spoke a few words that made me truly think I could tell him.
I felt my chest swarm with a huge amount of pride.
Harry told Ginerva to follow him to the kitchen and, even though she was upset, obliged.
When we pulled away, we were both panting for air and breathless.
"I wanna taste-" I don't finish my sentence before I'm sucking at the tip, pulling precome out.
"God, we're idiots," I heard Ginny say. Harry chuckled and I felt butterflies explode into my stomach.
"Oh, Harry, I'm so dirty!" I said, immediately trying to wriggle out of his grip. A week in Azkaban hadn't gone well for me and my tattered striped uniform was covered in dirt and goodness knows what else.
"I'm so sorry, Dray, I didn't know you were home and-" I put a hand up to silence him.
"What?" Draco moves to sit up as well, leaning on his hands.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Aren't you adorable," I cooed, pressing a soft kiss to his forehead as I picked him up again, before laying him down in his crib. I covered him up with the quilt my mother gave me at my baby shower and watched as his eyes slowly fell closed and he drifted off into sleep.
"I love you," This was whispered into Harry's chest and he smiled.
I knocked on the door. It swung open not a moment later. Harry greeted me with a smile and pulled me in for a kiss. I kissed him softer than he would've liked because he tried to pull me back to him.
"We better go make sure they don't tear anything in there to pieces," Harry sighed and wrapped his arm around Draco's waist, leading him into the kitchen where they were met with the sight of Laura's face covered in mashed potatoes and Teddy looking extremely guilty.
"Is she okay?!" I asked frantically, five seconds away from getting up and waddling over there. I looked at Harry, breathing heavily. He looked at me, the same panic in his eyes.
"How did it go?" Mother asked, letting Scorpius run upstairs to his bedroom. Her blonde hair was currently cascading down her shoulders, falling to her tail bone. She wore her sapphire blue dress and flats. I sighed, falling onto her couch.
"I remember the first trimester was the worst,"
"Yes, it looks like Mr. Malfoy let out a wave of accidental magic. The anger of his child being taken from him was enough to cause him to let out an extremely powerful bout of magic. But, to answer your question, Judge Marigolds, Mr. Malfoy didn't do it on purpose," The healer says, staring at the judge.
"I'll set up a court date about custody," He said, turning around and stalking off.
"Get out," I mumbled, swaying dangerously now. Harry's hold on me simply tightened. Weaslette huffed once more before walking out of the kitchen, horrid red suitcase in her hand. Harry followed her, most likely to make sure she didn't try to destroy any of our wedding photos or something equally as immature.
As the music slowed, Harry tugged me towards him. We danced some more, cheek to cheek.
"So, about Scorpius," I said slowly. His face went serious and he had a somewhat upset look on his face.
"Oh, hey, Gin," He greeted, waving a large hand at her.
"I hate spaghetti, actually," She cut me off. I gaped for a moment before clearing my throat.
"I don't see why I wouldn't answer the door if I live here too," I clarified, turning around and flicking my wand at the dishes in the sink one by one.
A flare of something nasty found its way out of me and, before I could move or say anything, Weaslette was thrown into the back of the couch. Harry's eyes were wide as he wiped his lips vigorously with the back of his hand. I was breathing heavily.
for a moment. His eyes, the scar on his forehead, his lips. My eyes flickered to his lips and I stared at them for another second.
"You guys are roommates?!"
I look over at him now. He's sitting on his grandmother's lap, playing with her hair, entirely unaware of what's happening.
"Nonsense," Draco insisted. Teddy rolled his eyes. Setting Maisie down, Harry walked up to Teddy.
Harry looked at Ginny. They smiled at each other before bringing one another into a tight hug.
"I said get out," He growled, turning around and looking darkly at me.
Draco nodded in a way of saying hello. Andromeda smiled, then nodded back. Harry's hold on his waist tightened, Draco sighed.
"Okay, well, I'm off to pick up James and Teddy, I was wondering if you wanted to come with me," Harry said as I began to wash my hands.
When both boys were asleep, I made my way back to the living room where Harry was already picking up Teddy's blocks.
"He was so angry when he saw the picture of Scorpius and Blaise, he didn't give you time to explain. This isn't fair to you or Scorpius," I tilted my head to the side.
"Fucking listen," I snapped.
"Did you make Daddy cry?" He asks, getting an angry expression on his face. I open my mouth to scold him but Harry talks first.
Xoxo, Tiffany
"I love watching them, it makes me feel young again," I couldn't stop the grin that worked it's way out of me at Molly's words and I heard Harry let out a hearty laugh. Molly chuckled lightly along with him, smiling lovingly at the both of us. I bounced James on my knee and he giggled, his hands still stuck in my hair.
"C'mere," Harry puts his arms out, ushering Draco into his embrace. Draco shakes his head fondly but feels himself falling into Harry's arms, letting his husband envelop him in a hug. Harry laughs again.
Beside me, I hear Ronald mumbling something about being Molly's actual son and not being greeted like that. Harry chuckles before saying something along the lines of '
," I hiss.
" Another hiss in Parsletongue that has me pushing back on his finger before we change positions so that he's sitting against the headboard and I'm straddling him, letting him thrust his finger in and out of me.
"You're a messy Metamorphogus, aren't you?" I teased. Teddy giggled and nodded, letting me pick him up and carry him to the sink in the kitchen. I sat him down on the counter and lifted the shirt off his head, banishing it to the laundry room with some wandless magic and grabbed a clean rag. Wetting the rag with water, I began to clean and wipe all of the chocolate chip ice cream off of Teddy and he giggled every time a tickled him.
Harry didn't answer.
Ron wasn't eating.
Teddy began talking to Harry about the Quidditch game that aired yesterday and James began to yell at Lyra for stealing a piece of his bacon and I sighed as I felt Harry's ankle wrap around mine underneath the table.
I looked at Scorpius. He stared at me, his head tilted to the side. He looked so handsome in his button-up shirt and tie. His blond hair was gelled back and he could pass for me if is eyes weren't green. It was him I was doing this for. My son. The light of my life.
It was sloppy, teeth clashing and tongues dancing with each other. The morning breath was something the both of us could overlook, I thought, as his hands traveled down to my hips, gripping them hard. One of my hands moved into his hair as the other cupped his face before sliding down his chest.
When we finally sat down, one of the pictures on the mantel caught my eye.
"After you fucked off for six years," I start, "Harry and I got married and had a child," I say, sneaking my arm under Harry's and wrapping it around his waist.
"No, I'm fucking furious," I respond before looking at his erection. It's standing tall and proud and I feel my mouth water. I want to feel the weight of it on my tongue, the aching of my jaw as he pries it open.
My eyebrows scrunched and I looked at Harry. He looked as clueless as I felt and I turned back to her.
"You have approximately 5 seconds to get
Later, at the reception, Harry swirled me around the dance floor, one hand in mine, the other around my waist. I smiled at him and laughed at one particularly fast spin.
I looked up at the brown eyes scanning up and down my husband's frame and felt my magic flicker again dangerously.
I felt the blood rush out of my face and, for a short moment, thought I was about to sway out of my chair.
With a final push, I shouted out in pain, gripping Harry's hand like a lifeline. I went silent, begging to hear the quiet cry. My baby wasn't crying. She wasn't breathing.
"Hey, buddy. I'm Harry,".
Grabbing a spoon of my own, I slid into a seat next to James and let him babble as I ate the rest of the yogurt in the carton, listening intently as a few actual words slipped out of his mouth.
Pulling mine out of the back pocket on my jeans, I spelled away the mess before throwing a discreet
"You can have this back when you decide to talk like grown-ups," I said sweetly to her. I walked over to Harry and traded her wand for James. Gathering the two-year-old in my arms, I let him lay his head on my shoulder and play with my hair.
"You do enough as it is, love, I can pick up a few wooden toys," He countered. I let out a huff of laughter and shook my head fondly.
"But Malfoy answered the door," She said, throwing a hand in my direction. I squinted at her.
I turned to Harry and Ginerva.
He silently lets me sit down at the table and I watch him patter around the kitchen, putting the pasta into two bowls for us. He sits them aside to cool.
"Please let me come, Daddy! Please, fuck, Haiz, please!" Malfoy kept whimpering and before the blonde could respond, Hailee flipped them over and began roughly pounding into the pale girl below her.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Well, I suppose I could whip something else up for you-"
"All I could think about was
"I birthed Scorpius," I started.
An hour later, Hermione, Pansy, and Ron walked up to the Gryffindor Boy's Dorms to find Draco laying in Harry's bed, wearing that pink hoodie that Harry would always wear, silent tears running down his cheeks.
Hour 1
"I'm sorry, Dray, it was a spur of the moment. I felt so happy to feel him in my arms and I... I'm so sorry, my love," He said, pulling away so our eyes could meet. I looked into his pools of emerald. I wanted to be mad. I wanted to hex him for trying to take Scorpius away. I wanted him to hurt as I hurt.
"Tired, Papa," Laura whispered in his ear, her head falling back on his shoulder.
"I love you, Draco," He says, pulling away to nuzzle that sensitive spot underneath my ear, pressing feather-light kisses to it, not enough to make me hard but enough to make me whine softly, my hands flying up to thread through his hair.
It was simply because I was part of the Sacred Twenty-Eight. Absolutely and entirely Pureblood. The fact that I had Veela genes in me as well simply supported my pregnancy. It wasn't the first case of male pregnancy in the Wizarding World and I was sure it wouldn't be the last.
," I giggled as he kissed my ear.
Teddy had ice cream all around his mouth and some on his shirt. His hair was chocolate brown to match and I shook my head fondly at him.
"Grown-arse woman," I say under my breath, Hermione snorting as we made our way back into the living room.
"OUT!" Molly bellowed, her hand pointing at the door. I jumped at that and, from the feeling beside me, so did Harry.
over both of them. They both opened their mouths and turned to me. I gave them a sweet smile before speaking.
"Ok, Draco, I'll be over in five seconds," She said hurriedly, cutting the line before I could respond. Less than a minute later, I heard Hermione bounding up the stairs, finding me in Harry and I's bedroom.
"I wouldn't mind in the slightest," I said.
