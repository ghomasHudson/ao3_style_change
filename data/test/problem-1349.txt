"Draco, Draco," he could hear someone saying, "breathe, you're panicking. I'm right here okay? It's just us."
"It's alright, we figured you'd want to sleep with all the alcohol. We figured you'd be hungover though..." Hermione took him in.
1. The whole reason I wrote this entire thing was because I wanted to write a story in which Lucius already knows about Draco liking Harry and when Draco finally tells him his father is all like “Yeah no duh, you’ve been talking about him non-stop since first year.”
"I was supposed to find Ron and Hermione at 12, and it's already 12:30," Harry said as he gestured across the street to where Ron and Hermione were walking together. "They'll be wondering where I am for sure. I'm sorry, but I better go and catch up to them alright? I'm sure you want to hang out with Parkinson and Zabini too."
Thinking of Draco, though, brought a whole new issue to the forefront of his brain. Draco glows red. Not only that, but he always seemed to be glowing brightly, almost blinding at times. The only people who had out-shined him - literally - were Ron and Hermione.
"What are your three most favorite things to do?" Harry was sort of shocked at the simple question, half expecting him to ask him something that would in some way embarrass him.
Ron gave him a curious look, but before he could say anything Hermione burst through the front door and noticed them.
"It is." Blaise threw his pillow at Ron, just barely missing his head as he laughed running for the bathroom door.
"Of course, with Dean here," Seamus said smirking at Ron and holding their linked hands up as Dean rolled his eyes at him.
"Honey you're very far from straight," Pansy rolled her eyes, "But that isn't the problem here! I never see you guys and you both have boyfriends! I don't have anyone!" Pansy groaned falling back on the bed dramatically and Blaise rolled his eyes at her.
"Ah!"  Harry groaned when Draco nipped at it. Draco leaned up to look at his face which was contorted in pleasure. Draco smiled as he leaned back to his stomach, kissing his way down Harry's abdomen until he reached his waistband.
"Are you sure you're going to be okay to play?" Ron asked about halfway through breakfast, giving Harry another of the concerned looks he'd been giving him throughout the meal.
Harry took a bite of his sandwich and Ginny leaned over to whisper in his ear, "With a 'friend' huh?" Ginny smirked at him and Harry blushed lightly. "We both know who you were really with."
"Who is going to read it? It stays in my room and Hermione isn't one to go around snooping in my stuff. She respects my privacy, unlike you too."
He had made one observation though: sometimes people glowed brighter. He'd noticed three people who glowed more than others in specific, though: Hermione, Ron and Draco. Granted, those were who he'd been around the most, and he'd also been studying them for most the day as well. The thing that puzzled him the most though was that while Hermione and Ron seemed to have a pattern of when they glowed brighter (when they were around each other), Draco didn't seem to have a pattern at all. Instead he always seemed to be glowing brighter than everyone else in the room.
Draco stared at Harry for a moment, nerves flooding him and making his mind a bit fuzzy. "I don't know what to do," he admitted nervously, his face coloring slightly.
"Are you alright Harry?" Hermione pressed, she was growing more worried about him by the second, and the fact that Draco had just run through a little bit ago with an air of panic around him wasn't helping.
Harry woke up with a groan and a splitting headache. The sunlight coming in through the windows seemed very bright to his eyes and he fell back into his pillow with another groan. Suddenly he felt another presence and he turned his head and squinted up at the boy who was now standing beside his bed holding out a small vial.
When Harry entered the room, they looked up and quickly turned red as they spotted Harry. Hermione was the first to speak, clearing her throat and trying to pretend Harry didn't just find them tangled up on the couch as they were.
Harry tried to focus his attention back on the pitch, he had come out to support Ginny after all. She was the new captain this year and looked right at home out on the pitch running the practice. She had a bit of a practice game going and Harry noticed a kid he didn't recognize playing as seeker. Harry had to admit, he was pretty good, he was glad that the Gryffindor team seemed to be in good hands.
Harry woke up on Saturday with the sun glaring into his eyes. Groaning he tried to turn over, only to realize he couldn't.
"You're one to talk, there is no privacy with you either," Draco pointed out, shuddering at the memory of all the times she had no respect for personal space, like she walked in on him in the bathroom during an awkward time or the time she found his journal (which she read at full volume to their friends and laughed at for an hour).
Draco, who was a bit more sober than both Pansy and Harry, had turned to look at her when his name was mentioned and now a look of pure shock was on his face. "You can't involve me in his dare, it's not fair."
"Yeah, sucks to watch everyone else get their New Years kiss and not get to participate," Ginny laughed and Harry joined in.
“Are you going to sit next to us today?” Harry asked, keeping his voice low even though he had no idea why. He felt like talking too loud would break the calm between them and he didn’t want to do that.
They both didn't have classes in the afternoon and had decided to spend their punishment in the library.
Draco on the other hand was very interested in the tryouts. He actually knew quite a few of the people trying out, so he was more interested in who would make the team than Harry was. Harry enjoyed watching Draco get into the practice game that was being played below them, he'd never really realized how much Draco liked Quidditch. Harry watched Draco's lips move up and down in response to what was happening in the game. The corner of his lip twitching up when he saw a particularly good play, or his forehead creasing when he saw something he didn't like.
less prepared than she should have been when she felt a hand grab her. She cursed her stupidity in thinking she would be safe in the muggle world, for thinking that they would have caught any stragglers so easily but not keeping track. She cursed that Voldemort had happened at all, that she couldn’t escape him even now. Mostly, she cursed Lucius goddamn Malfoy.
magical cores or terminal physical conditions. The last can usually be fixed with a few years of treatments and I suppose that is the only good thing to come of it; the options for healing disfigurements and physical conditions from Britain has been remarkable.” she mused. “Why would anyone want to put their children through something like that besides? Just terrible.” she shook her head.
“Draco had wanted a boa constrictor as a pet. He even said it was alright if it were an albino one but all I could picture was Draco trying to
“To try to find ways to counteract them. There aren’t any charms that are bulletproof, no wards that stand against bombs yet. Given the trouble brewing, I’ll imagine there are plenty interested in how to protect themselves in case of…” she paused and he pursed his lips. “An…Unwanted turn of events.”
to the entire branch of magic. Even the use of the term ‘Dark Arts’ is debated heavily by the Confederation while this Ministry slaps it on anything that they deem too dangerous for the uneducated masses they help create. Most of the time, those magics, be they potions or even ward systems, are actually considered ‘gray’ or neutral as we of the Confederation like to say.
“I’m flattered.” she said though whether or not it was sarcasm or genuine, he couldn’t tell. “But being smart or being well informed or well spoken are different things.”
“They actually have some pretty dangerous teeth. Can go right through clothes.” she mused aloud. “What about a chinchilla? They’re incredibly soft, cute, small and they take dust baths. Harmless and easily held. They do very well in quiet homes as well, and don’t require excessive attention.”
“Then you’re a ghost,” something cold settled in his chest and it felt like dread and some other, much worse feeling. She scoffed, smoothing her dress over her thighs.
And he eyed her for a moment before shrugging and leaving without any more fuss or even a good bye. She huffed to herself. How rude! The professor was waiting for her and had very kindly gotten her an ice-cream cone.
(His uncles had a little fit before snidely implying it was better not to associate their name with a Muggleborn anyways. And then grandfather chewed them out about their own vapid wives. One of which hadn’t even had enough magical power to attend Hogwarts or one of the other premier magical schools but got their Nott name because she was ‘pretty and easy and Pureblooded’.)
“Given my occupation, I switch continents as often as I do my shoes.” she snorted a bit, amused and leaning ever so slightly on her husband.
He had her eyes, her curls but his father’s colors and even the Potter jaw and cheekbones. The rest was his father and he was
Poppy eyed him. His robes looked a little...Subpar, and there was a smudge of dirt on his nose. Hermione's eyes snapped to her and Eddie. She glanced at him and he hummed.
She stroked his side until she heard his tiny rasping breath before he burrowed back against her. They were six, and so so very small against her. She’d never been a large person by any means and she knew, realistically, that they were at what felt like healthy sizes for their age and most especially for their father’s side. They were going to be tall. She’d known that the moment she’d set eyes on them.
“Oh yes, Ms. Potters! Malmsi will wait for Ms. Potter to call on her!” before a loud crack heralded her departure.
“The potion would enhance our natural magic and our physical bodies at the cost of one of our senses.” Nev frowned.
He forgot to breathe and gasped in, feeling like his chest was too tight to take in air or that maybe, it was mimicking her own in punishment for what he’d just done.
“They pay for my tuition but not my supplies.” she told him. “Even if I’m not part of a working household, I still have the current funds to get them myself.”
“Of course not! He’s a Kneazle and chinchilla Persian mix, from purebred parents, and costs more than your land entirely.” Osmond scoffed, demeaning and arrogant.
“It feels itchy.” Helle’s soft voice floated over to Edsel and he glanced back at where Pearl was smoothing her thumb over what should be the telling lightning bolt scar.
She was named Hesperia. Besides, having a cat around all of Marge’s dogs was just begging for an incident.
. They were almost scalding, the feel of their young, feeble magic and it made her own tremendous, ruthless mass of magic tremble back away from them.
And her stomach swooped. Helaine had been like a mother to her and her closer friends when they were young and just starting smallholding, beloved in their tiny community. The Frenchwoman’s passing had hit them hard. Her land was situated between Hattie and Beryl’s and as it stood now, it was empty. Her beekeeping things had gone to Hattie, since she was mostly all gardens and the extra pollinators were always welcome while Beryl took on most of the woman’s rabbits that Helle liked to coddle nowadays.
“I’m Dean Thomas.” the boy next to her piped in, eyes taking in this new girl eagerly. Jasper makes a mental note to warn the boy off before he gets any ideas.
“I don’t think they’re so bad…Oh! I’m Lavender Brown! Nice to meet you. And this is Faye Arlton beside me.” the black girl who introduced herself gestured to a quiet looking brunette.
“There are four of them. I’m not sure what they’re doing with them in the task, but there will be dragons.”
call her a bloke.” the youngest Weasley pointed out and the twins shrugged, accepting that as the answer why their first sister was so moody.
They walked down to the Great Hall together, engaged in light conversation on the way down. When they entered the Great Hall they split to go to their respective tables. Ron raised an eyebrow at Harry as he sat down and Hermione didn't miss how Harry sat in a way that would give him a perfect view of the Slytherin table.
“Ugh, please don’t tell me you ran away after that,” Hermione groaned, rubbing her face with her hands.
Pansy quickly introduced the group to a game where two people would have to kiss without stopping and without touching. The first person to pull away or touch the other loses.
Draco laughed, pulling Harry into a hug, “You really are an idiot sometimes you know? Of course I’ll go with you.”
When they all got back to Ron's room after lunch Hermione immediately rounded on him, "Tell me everything!"
"You can't. As soon two people, from the same house, put their trunk down in a room, one of them goes flying at them. You won't even be able to put your stuff down," Hermione replied, turning to look at Malfoy.
"You're ridiculous," Draco said, but he was laughing despite himself and Harry could see the slight flush across his face that told him Draco was enjoying himself.
"You ready?" Blaise asked Neville when he arrived. They were going to go to Hogsmeade together for their first date and Blaise was drowning in nerves.
Harry quickly jerked his eyes back to his textbook, the last thing he wanted was to get caught staring at Draco, especially if he was caught by Draco. Harry did not want to make it any more awkward than it already was, Draco could not find out how he was feeling. So Harry would continue to only watch him silently.
"Well whatever you do, don't go to Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop. That place is horrid," Draco said, sitting up so he could look at his friends as they talked.
Pansy simply ignored him and continued, "And you're always off on dates with your new boyfriend!" Pansy shot Blaise a look over her shoulder.
"I do not fancy Potter!" Draco shouted at her. Pansy stopped and stared at him for a second as several people turned to look at them as well. Draco immediately colored.
“No kidding,” Draco said and Harry shot him a look, “That’s why we’re practicing now, you better make this count ‘cause we’re not going to get much practice in next week due to finals.”
"You're not. You took care of me when I had that nightmare." Draco suddenly remembered the way Harry looked that night - tears running down his face and moving about on the bed - he wanted to reach out to grab his hand, but stopped himself at the last second. "It's the least I could do," Harry finished.
"Not because it's my house color though! It's been my favorite since before I came here!" Harry shouted back laughing. This game was actually pretty fun. "Oh whatever, what's the stupidest thing you've ever done?"
"Alright, well we better get going for class," Dean said, standing up and helping Seamus up as well.
"Are there rules that you have to be alone with him? Or can Ron and I join you two? I know Ron was hoping to discuss the Quidditch team with you."
"If you say so," Draco said with a smirk, but he honestly didn't care, as long as Harry was there he didn't care where they went.
Draco let out a contented sigh as Harry pulled the blankets around him, a sound that made Harry's heart twist and he was suddenly very glad he had stopped them.
"Okay!" Hermione said as she dropped a notebook onto the dinner table, startling Harry and Ron who were arguing over the new Quidditch season lineup and who they thought would win. "I have written out a list of everyone who tried out for the eighth-year team and what position they tried out for." Hermione opened up the notebook and Ron and Harry leaned over to read.
Harry looked over to where Hermione was paying for a chocolate frog. "Yeah, thanks mate," he said, quickly getting out some money to pay for a few chocolate frogs.
Hermione couldn't express her gratitude when it was finally time to head down to the pitch. She couldn't take anymore of them.
Harry absentmindedly kept his fingers threading through Draco's hair as he looked out over the grounds. Draco was glowing brightly beside him and it was kind of beautiful. Harry could see the red out of the corner of his eye and he closed his eyes letting himself savor the moment.
Seriously ... no I mean it, it's not like I don't love it, but you could have warned me, I feel sorry for those poor owls that had to drop off the cage, but when I said I might - did you see that word there, you know MIGHT - want a cat, that does not mean you buy me one. Poor thing ... still haven't come up with a suitable name for it. Any suggestions on what to name a female grey cat? Oh, and I hope you realise I was actually joking when I stated I wanted stuff, I was mostly listing off things at the top of my head.
Draco frowned slightly at the do not disturb sign-up on the handle of the hotel room he was sharing with Dudley. America had been completely relaxing, and his complexion had darkened slightly - he had not tanned as much as he thought he would. Probably something to do with the lotion, Aria made him put on his skin. Something Muggles used to stop their skin from burning - called sun cream lotion or some nonsense like that.
'That's the major difference between our point of view of Hogwarts,' Aria said, 'Your home was always the Manor, even during the war - though I suspect it wasn't as much of one then - but you still view it as home.'
Aria did not recognize herself the morning of September first. She was dressed in the finest robes. Her trunk that she had left behind at Hogwarts when she had been kidnapped from the Ministry had been searched through and returned to her when it seemed that it held nothing of value. Draco had proven himself to be completely cunningly resourceful; his success had returned her invisibility cloak and the Marauder's Map.
'It was lovely, especially when daddy got home - though we spent most of our summer rebuilding the house.'
'I got lucky,' Aria said, 'I got to choose the place I called home - and those who I call my family.'
On a different note, sorry I can't make diner with you, I'd already had plans made with Dudley and Emily - and Chinese food ... well it's been a weakness of mine since I've discovered it. But I'll see you sometime in the week, Wednesday? I've got Teddy on Tuesday. As for Diagon Alley ... I've actually been avoiding going and was planning on doing everything by owl post ... my old school robes still fit so I won't have to make the journey ... I'd go with, but first, as I already said I'll have Teddy and well I don't want to be fawned over ... and as the community hasn't seen me out since the battle ...well I'm sure you can image the hipe it would cause.
'Remember I told you my school got attacked,' Dudley nodded, 'it's always the same thing D, night after night. I can see the Great Hall - where we would usually have our meals - just only it's full of bodies D, dead bodies. The lives I should have saved.'
Aria was not sure what to make of that comment, though Draco's friends had been civil to her in the last month, she had not really spoken to them much properly. Just another thing to add to things to sort out, what with Quidditch and McGonagall wanting her to make a plan for an inter-house event, which she had no clue what to do, as her Headmistress had turned down quite a few of the ideas saying that it wouldn't work, Aria's confidence was not exactly high. But it stung more watching Draco Malfoy walk out of the room as though he didn't need her help at all, they had just neared the end of October and he had already broken his oath not to hurt her. Which left her questioning why, why had his actions hurt so much?
For a moment she wondered why he said that then she remembered he had asked her not to change. Aria stepped closer to him.
Draco lowered his head, and muttered in an ashamed tone, even though he was not. "I have grown attached, My Lord."
'I have something for you, Aria,' Draco said softly breaking the awkward silence after dinner had finished. 'I would have given it to you the other day ... but it was not ready.' he explained, pulling out a square box from his robes, placing it on the table in front of her.
Draco eyed the small brown-haired and hazel-eyed girl. Great the news had even spread to the first-years. But he was surprised this one actually knew who he was, knew his name, he had hardly known anyone older than him, other than those who had been in Slytherin, and that was only thanks to his father's connections. But he remembered this girl, this was the same girl that had crossed the Great Hall during Aria's question about not knowing magic before Hogwarts.
Draco put the lotion on his hand, then slowly raised his hand up towards her back, Aria flinched as his hands brushed her shoulders. He glanced at her - her eyes were closed, her face screwed up.
Draco shook his head, the simple touch had been what Aria wanted, it hadn't taken Aria much to get things the way she wanted them - Draco certainly wasn't going to argue nor was his father. His mother had tried, but Aria had not fallen for any cunning tactics to try and change her mind. As Draco turned back towards the window - something orange ... something bright - caught his attention and Draco was on his feet rushing out of the door. Draco sprinted through the Manor halls and out into the gardens...
Draco laughed, actually laughed, his eyes sparkled and Aria could feel his magic buzzing ... she could get used to the way it shielded her. 'That is devious ... utterly devious. I would never thought you'd have something like that in you.'
Indeed she was, Scorpius groaned and stretched out his hand to take Adelaide's hand, and Draco glanced at his wife, who was looking at their son, with a knowing look on her face, one which reminded him of the time his mother had when she had informed him of her life debt plan. Draco rolled his eyes, somethings he gathered, just like some debts and bonds were just best left alone, just like how Draco would always be indebted to his wife for providing him with a life, he had been gravely concerned that he would never get to have with her. Draco, however, was so grateful that Aria Malfoy had given him that chance.
'You should ... you could have informed me you were feeling unwell.' Draco said, 'You changed your hair ... it's down.'
His name came as a whisper, a tone he hardly heard from his father. He turned around not sure whether he wanted to speak with the man or not.
Aria had heard through the excited murmurs of Voldemort's Death Eaters that she really should learn the names of, that Snape had suffered at the hands of Voldemort himself. Though she knew it could not have been about Voldemort's major plan. The only way he agreed to let Aria roam the halls of Hogwarts was on the execution of Albus Dumbledore. It was why Aria was failing at producing a Patronus.
Aria flushed so deeply Draco had no idea what brought it on, and why she was suddenly talking about the boys locking the dorm doors - guys only did that that if - OH!
'The tournament will be open to fifth years and above, only. I suggest if you are not familiar with dueling rules or what duels consist of, speak to Professor Newmann before entering your name. The tournament will be an open event, meaning other schools will be able to submit their students for it, and even homeschooled students will be able to attend. The tournament will take place at the beginning of June, which means all exams will be brought forward and taken in May. Those wanting to submit themselves please either speak with Professor Neumann or your House Head.'
Draco ran a hand through his hair, it was the only thing that made sense, and if that was the case then he really needed to get hold of Aria. He had to make her understand - they had no other option, what options were open to him when the person whose magic was compatible with his own, disliked him. She even admitted that she ... oh Merlin, she had said that she would have heard them out. Should they have done things differently? Knowing what he now had learned about Aria, the answer was very clear, yes they should have.
Nothing happened. Draco lowered his wand. Maybe he imagined it. Draco did not imagine the growling noise - nor as he looked towards the ground the snarling beast that was threatening him. A fox. Draco was not threatened in the slightest, but that did not mean he would step closer. Draco backed off several paces and tested the outskirts of their wards; everything was intact, satisfied Draco Apparated back to Malfoy Manor.
Draco looked into her green eyes, which showed a bit of hesitancy. How could someone that could be so brave be so unsure of themselves?
Draco curled his hands into fists. He would not act like an overprotective jealous boyfriend. But if Cygnus didn't remove his hand that he had placed unnecessary upon Aria's, Draco would not be held accountable for his own actions. Cygnus was a bloody professor ... what the hell was he thinking .. flirting with a student - didn't matter Aria was of age. And Draco knew ... knew that's what his cousin was doing... Draco was not going to get jealous ... Cygnus thought he was so much better than himself ... it hadn't always been that way. They had been close at one point - Draco had looked up to his older cousin, and with their magic being similar at one point, they could have called themselves brothers.
'BALL!' Aria seemed to be battling with what emotion to show first, anger or frustration, 'no he did not.'
Draco forced Cygnus's jaw shut with his hand only to find himself being hurled backward with a burst of magic he had not been expecting. 'You - you'll pay for this!' Draco managed to spit the words out, for he was too lost in his task. Cygnus's wand was withdrawn in the next instant pointed straight at Draco.
Aria shook her head, 'Not after Hedwig.' She gave no other explanation, it needed no other explanation.
'Your point?' Draco inquired. Blaise merely inclined his head in the direction of the Gryffindor table. Aria was surrounded by fellow peers, Finnigan was talking amatively with his hands, making those nearest to him, Aria included laugh.
Aria was by now, far accustomed to the whispers and chatter in corridors that followed her. Usually, she would settle for ignoring rumours and mindless chatter, but it seemed that after the war, the other students of Hogwarts no longer cared about keeping their thoughts to themselves ... well not that they usually did, it was just more on a subtle scale and she'd hear them second-hand, mostly from Ginny and Hermione.
Ron sighed, heavily, his gaze never left hers. 'Are you sure you want this? Are you sure that he loves you? Are you sure that he is not going to hurt you?'
Lunchtime Aria wandered the grounds and made her way to the lake. She always wondered here in times of need. To the bank across from the first place she ever cast a corporeal Patronus. That seemed like a lifetime ago, but what she wouldn't give to speak to the person she had tried to desperately save now. The Resurrection Stone was gone, Aria had no clue as to where she had dropped it.
"' ...saviour Aria Potter was rushed into Saint Mungo's in the late hours of last night ... the wizarding saviour, her condition is currently unknown, but it seems that those on the scene rushed to help, as Aria Potter symptom upon arrival was the lack of breath ... what could have put our esteemed hero in such a state or is the question whom ..."
'Wouldn't hurt me you said, respect me you said,' Aria hissed, 'was this the plan all along. Hay I know mother, Aria Potter is pretty much dim-witted, we can fool her with anything. Did you think I would not find out - that we would not learn it -'
Bodies cried out in pain. Aria was frozen, unable to help. They were in the main hall of Malfoy Manor. Defiancancy would at best torture Draco which was no better than watching the Death Eaters' lastest muggle captures being tortured or at worst likely kill her. Aria could not bring herself to watch, but she also could not say anything to stop the torture. This had not been the first time she had been witness to entertainment at mealtimes. A hand gripped her wrist, very discreetly Draco Malfoy stood in front of her, the view of the torture muggles now blocked by his body, it did not stop the screams from reaching her ears. Aria had to concentrate on that, she stared at the back of Malfoy's blonde head. She had not really noticed that he was now taller than her.
Her head needed a break, it was why she on holiday to begin with, but as the return to Hogwarts loomed nearer, the worse her dreams became. Aria counted herself lucky that she hadn't woken anyone up, as Malfoy was sharing a room with Dudley; much to her amazement Dudley seemed to be OK with that arrangement, and she had been sharing Emily. But the room sharing with Emily meant one thing - she couldn't use magic - and Aria knew from the many times Hermione and Ginny had told her, she talked in her sleep. It was embarrassing enough Dudley and Ron knew, she didn't need Malfoy added into the picture, as Aria was pretty sure Dudley had told Emily what to expect. What she needed most was some sleep.
Draco Malfoy had no idea what he was getting himself into ... compatible magic they may have - that didn't mean Aria was going to let him get away with anything.
'He was also trying to teach you something else,' Aria added. 'As you progress in Potions, the more you'll find uncommon names or names you have never heard of before. It's all due to when the Potion was created. You can't just rely on knowing the common names for herbs. The older the Potion, the more you'll find it.'
"She could be spying," Ginny said thoughtfully. "It's not like we can rely on Snape now. We know he's apart of the Death Eaters. Maybe that's why Aria needs to be there. With the Slytherins. Why she chose not to run for it. Aria does do everything for a reason."
"Prongs!" Aria cursed annoyingly at her Patronus. She had been practicing this spell for two weeks now. She managed to cast the charm that produced her stag but had not managed to produce the result she needed. The communicative Patronus. Aria needed to warn Dumbledore. She needed to warn Hermione. Her stag merely titled its antlered head at her as if to ask 'where is the danger?' before disappearing from view again. Aria sunk down against the guest bedroom door, head in her hands, completely and utterly frustrated. She would just have to try again tomorrow.
"Goyle and Crabbe are useless, My Lord," Aria said softly. "They might look like the type of person not to mess with but even first-years can get the best of them."
Draco had not suspected a question to be the first thing Aria would say after not seeing her for almost a week. Her brows were narrowed, her face tense - as though she was accusing him of doing something. When it became apparent she had not made herself very clear, her facial expression softened into a more thoughtful look.
Aria had forgotten that the Death Eater and Voldemort expected her wand to be more restricted than it was.
Draco turned towards his son's voice, he hadn't realised that his son had approached him, and like himself, his son, Scorpius had inherited Veela traits, whereas his daughter, Lily had not. His son stood tall and proud, a lot more confident than when he had left for Hogwarts this year, a pretty mousey brown-haired girl, who Draco calculated to be the same age as his son, stood next to his son, smiling a little hesitantly. Piercing blue eyes searched his own. Draco concluded that she had to be the reason his son was more like himself, after all, he had told his parents he was bringing someone home for the holidays.
Draco sighed. Aria had never heard him sigh before. Draco always seemed so sure of himself. Aria took in his appearance. He looked like he hadn't slept.
Only it was too late, the door opened, and Aria had been the person to answer it, even though he couldn't see her face he could feel the dimness within her magic, the door opened Aria looked as though she had been ready to say something, as her mouth shut tight the second she laid eyes upon him.
'The protective magic-' Aria mumbled realising why she had not felt emotions now and just the warmness of Draco's magic. 'It's because I don't have magical bonds ... your magic is the first - since ...' Aria trailed off nothing needed to be said.
Draco shrugged, 'I didn't get it either ... but I think that mother - regrets a few of her previous choices.'
'Where is Potter anyway, I thought her nose would be stuck in some book, I swear your girlfriend has turned into Granger.'
'To Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger, for aiding in a much-needed mission that brought on the destruction of Voldemort, for without which none of this would have been at all possible.'
'You said, that you would have had given it to me the other day, but it was not ready,' Potter tried to explain, 'But you did not know that I would accept, why get me anything before knowing the answer.'
And though Draco's body had fallen so he lay on his side, his breathing was even, and as she reached him his grey eyes shot open filled with what she could only describe as pure hatred. Aria could tell that Draco knew that she was there, that she had come to see how he was for herself, and to help him up. But Draco did not take her extended hand, he pushed himself up and settled for scowling at Neumann. And though it was the Professor's fault that Draco had flew across the room, Draco's shield had not been strong enough to take the offending blow. Something Professor Neumann pointed out in a criticising tone for he said, as the bell rang; 'Shield needs more power behind it Mr Malfoy. Do take yourself to the Hospital Wing.'
'Girl who is at -' the question fell short as the woman looked him over, then turned towards Dudley, 'oh, Dudders, is this a friend of yours? What am I saying, of course, he must be ... well, girl what are you standing in the way for, let the poor young man through.'
"Maybe three minutes later. Verity caught a glimpse of her, but she was gone once we got there. Just this package in her place."
'I just feel like ... I'm not being told things,' Aria admitted, for that was what actually brought her here. 'And I ... don't like that.'
'You went fucking Veela Malfoy, I had to put myself in front of you so you wouldn't harm them!' Aria said angrily, 'Gods, they're Muggles, one of which didn't know a thing about magic -'
Of course, she had questioned it ... but there was the matter of the life-debt. And Draco had been trying to prove that he was not the same person, he had been honest, she supposed spending all that time with him in the summer, helped. Compatible magic just sucked sometimes. But she could not deny that they had it, she could not forget the way it made her feel ... her head pounded, and Aria rubbed her temple - great the last thing she needed; a headache.
Draco smirked, well Theodore had a point there. 'I'm off then as we've got everything - I said I'd meet up with mother.'
'I can manage a simple task like that,' Malfoy replied, speaking for the first time. 'If your friends can manage to do the same. Is that all?'
"Don't make Hermione having to go into hiding be for nothing," Ron said. "this may be the only chance we get you to safety -"
Aria ran a hand through her hair, re-framing from replying, apart from Neville and Luna, occasionally Ginny, she hadn't had much support from her peers. Draco had the best excuse, for Aria had not told him when the sessions were being held but mostly because she always planned them for when he was on patrol. Ron and Hermione missed them mostly because they were too busy avoiding Goyle, so they could actually spend time together.
Her aunt too had been eyeing the door but disrespectfully as though the door had done something wrong, Draco had no time to ponder on it, as a loud shutting of a door occurred. And by the sound of it, it had come from the front door.
'Miss Potter, so glad you could join us,' his father spat, 'one wonders if you're capable of reading the time.'
"She's being watched," Neville replied. "She's never on her own. Draco or Ophelia are usually with her. And when they are on patrol I never see Aria."
The following weeks as January faded into February, Hogwarts seemed to bustle with excitement, students kept putting their names down, Draco included, but Aria still refused to sign up for the competition, but their fellow peers had not given up hope that she might enter her name. Draco shook his head, yes Aria excelled at Defence, but she was making it pretty clear she wasn't interested. It seemed only Alana, Granger and Weasley had paid any attention.
'Did you ever wonder why - your sentence in Azkaban was so short? Why Draco and I were never sentenced?' His mother stated. 'She spoke up for us Lucius, all of us - defended us when no one else would - defended your honour - when it was I she owed the life-debt. Aria Potter cleared us - saved our family name, when she was not asked to -'
'I resent that.' Aria did not need him to inform her of what he had been thinking, for she knew she wasn't exactly the most patient person.
'This one,' Aria pointed to two hoops that had been fused together, 'is equality, so it means you see me as an equal, as your equal.'
'I'm fine,' Aria told her. Aria was sure if Epsilon could she would look at her as though she knew better. Because who was Aria trying to kid, she was far from fine. She felt weak, her head was pounding, she couldn't stop shivering, and she was far from feeling cold. Epsilon jumped up onto Aria's bed, made her way across the covers, and settled upon Aria's lap, as though trying to offer her some warmth and comfort. Aria reached out a hand and stroked her behind her ear, 'Thank you.'
But yet they hadn't told Goyle this information. For as far as Draco knew Goyle was still following them. Granger seemed to know what he was thinking for she said. 'She deserves some peace, that's why we hadn't said anything.'
Lips pressed onto his own lips lightly and lingered for a few moments causing Draco to pout slightly at the chaste kiss he had received. The owner of said lips that had kissed him, giggled, her green eyes sparkling, a soft happy smile upon her face.
Aria turned her head... well, this was awkward ... she should have suspected that Draco might turn up, but all the Malfoys. Their entrance was not as confident as it once would have been - the Malfoys walked around like they owned the place - but the steps into the room Aria had been placed in, were slow - hesitant, as though they thought they'd be cursed at any second.
Aria's eyes found his in the mirror, a hint of understanding in her eyes. She had realised that he had been willing to earn her trust back, to earn her forgiveness. Draco paused his task for a few moments and took from his robe pocket and pulled out her bracelet, for he had been meaning to return it to her since she had returned to her own home.
The sound of footsteps was mixed with slight laughter - as students filled the white square, and began to look around at those who had joined in the square also. Chatter broke out as students began to ask similar questions of who others supported. Then Aria called out, 'Whose who support the Tornadoes remain in the square -'
'Now,' Aria commanded Celena to listen to her, 'if you think I will let you drag me here, just to let yourself be fooled into thinking that you are better than me. Then I hardly think you know me very well. I am not one to back down from a challenge and there is more than one way to see that you suffer.'
'I didn't know -' Malfoy retorted harshly than he added in a softer tone, 'I would have told you if I had known though.'
'It's OK, I just don't think that people understand and are after a reason as to why, my not wanting to do it doesn't seem to be a good enough of one.'
She crossed the room once more, picking up the bag she had brought with her, she had meant to be staying the night ... Aria was grateful that this had happened because staying in the house Hermione had been tortured in was completely different from being there for a few hours ... no matter if the Manor felt like Draco's magic. Aria reached around and unzipped the silver ball dress, letting it fall to the floor, and pulled off her high-heels, she rummaged for the Muggle clothing she had packed and began to change into them hastily, she changed over her shoes, and shoved the dress into her bag and was about to leave the room when she noticed how ridiculous she looked - her hair still tied up into an elegant knot and make-up still applied. Aria crossed the room once more, and sat on the dresser-stool, she removed the make-up first. She removed the contact-lenses replacing them with her glasses, and just pulled out the elegant hair-knot when the knock upon the door came. The person had not waited for her to call out, the door opened ... and Aria's mouth fell shut as she caught sight of Narcissa Malfoy.
It seemed Kingsley could summon up the words, and Aria was not the only person who was listening to every word being said. Aria, Ron, Hermione, along with the members of the DA, had been asked to sit in rows of seats very close to where Kingsley stood, and Aria had a feeling there was a point to this request, but Dumbledore's Army sat in the row of seats behind the last remaining members of the Order of the Phoenix, and Aria was trapped between Neville and Hermione that she had no choice to follow Neville into her seat or be trampled on or cause a scene, and that was the last thing Aria had wanted to do.
Draco was unsure on what did it, whether it had been that his mind was clear from frustration or whether his thoughts had been on Aria, but there was a gasp as the husky run around the room; Draco felt slightly disappointed by the form of his Patronus, with their complimentary magic he thought he would've had something to match Arias. Aria seemed surprised, had she too expected the same thing? But she shook her head and gave him a smile and look full of understanding. Maybe having a different Patronus to hers was not so bad after all. Then Aria decided that she couldn't be outdone, and cast; perfectly and non-verbally a corporeal Patronus, her stag dashed around the room. From her smirk, she had been able to do so for a little while, she just had wanted to wait until he managed to cast his. Show off! Well, he couldn't have that - as soon as the class ended, Draco swept past the other students, completely ignored Weasley and Granger, tugged on Aria's arm, making her spin around, and pulled her towards him, his lips meeting hers.
'Why are you being nice to me?' Alana's brown eyes searched her suspiciously, 'I got housed in Slytherin, and your well ... Aria Potter.'
Dinner, fortunately, passed without further mishaps, mostly because it had been spent in silence. More than once his hand hovered towards his wand beneath his robes, waiting for the attack or outburst that never came. Even his mother glanced several times between Potter and his father, no doubt thinking along the same lines as himself.
Aria grimaced, she knew telling Ron would be the hardest, that was why she had chosen to tell him first. Though Ron was not red-faced, Aria could tell he was displeased. It would have been hard to miss, as Ron had gotten to his feet in the blink of an eye, a hand fisting his hair. If Aria was honest, she thought Ron may have thrown a punch at something upon hearing the news, though she was glad that this had been the result.
'I promised Mr and Mrs Weasley I'd spend Easter with them,' Aria replied, 'And I do not break a promise, at least if I can help it.'
Draco was stunned, just moments ago this girl had told him not to be judgemental, but then had implied it herself, he was so stunned, that he didn't correct her, and before he got a chance to, the girl had vanished from sight. Draco shook his head, replaced Aria's bracelet back into his bag, and went back to his letter.
Though wizarding travel was much quicker, and he much preferred to use it, Potter clearly enjoying herself, her magic buzzed with excitement and Draco couldn't stop himself from smiling at her antics. Traveling as a Muggle was different from what he thought it be like - true he didn't like aeroplanes much - it made his ears go funny - apparently this was considered normal and Potter gave him a cure of sorts for it. Though Draco could still not see how sucking on a sweet actually helped. But the relaxed nature of it all, despite having to be early for everything, it was relaxing, in a way. He could see why she wanted to travel this way now, and not just see the sights by herself.
'That school of yours finally taught you some manners then,' Miss Dursley muttered, 'about time too.'
'Good,' Alana nodded, and added seriously, 'hurt her again, and I'll learn every hex Hogwarts can provide me with, I'll even get Aria to teach me.'
'I think you miss understand,' Mrs Malfoy said calmly, 'Draco is to court you, not to change things about you.'
'I guess I found out what I wanted to do,' Draco said shrugging, then he pointing towards the back of the house, 'there's a lake here too, I thought you'd like that.'
'OK one less thing to worry about,' Aria said speaking to herself, 'Thanks Mr Ollivander,' she bit her lip frowning, then said, 'Why do you always say wizard ... you've never said, witch or wizard?'
'Don't,' Neville said, 'don't feel guilty, it wasn't like you three weren't doing anything now, was it?'
Draco groaned, 'Well Aria Malfoy, I wait for the day that it is official with such anticipation and longing, for you deserve a bonding until then Potter let's get going before I change my mind.'
'I don't -' Potter stopped herself, and gave a thoughtful look, one Draco saw plague her face the other day when she thought out her options, 'I think that's a great idea, that's if Draco doesn't mind traveling as Muggle or by Muggle means.'
Draco glanced around, to the voice in question, just moments ago Aria had left with Weasley for Gryffindors last practice before the holidays, and now Granger was speaking to him out of the blue like they had been lifetime friends.
Aria groaned, no this year the whispers were not subtle at all. She hated it ... why couldn't people just stay out of her business? ... What was it to them? Why did it matter to them? It wasn't their lives it affected... no, it was her own.
Hermione gave her a knowing look, 'We're talking about Draco Malfoy. As in the same Draco Malfoy, that always raised to a challenge when you issued one - he wasn't going to back down because of an aeroplane.'
'Well that is good to hear,' Mrs Weasley said, though she still looked doubtful. 'Please, though Aria, please come to us if ever should you need it - no matter what is going on in our lives.'
'You helped her? Helped her shop for a dress - for - Malfoy!' Ron hissed, 'Have you forgotten that? Forgotten that this Draco Malfoy we're talking about?'
Aria hesitated for a few moments indecision plagued her face, 'I had a row - we, Ron and I had a row - about you.' she gave a heavy sigh, 'He thinks - he thinks that you've just made it up - as none of us knew you were ... well, a Veela - you always said you were Pure-blood - and it's bad enough I've had to get my head around us ... having compatible magic ... which is a bit ... daunting .. let alone, having a row on top of everything.'
With Fleur out of the question, Aria's next choice had of course been Hermione, and she knew Hermione would help, it was Ron Aria was concerned about most, and if Ron found out Aria was looking into the rune meanings ... well, she was trying to avoid yet another argument about Draco Malfoy. Which left her with asking to borrow Hermione's ancient runes book and still have the same outcome or roam the knowledge of Grimmauld Place ... or more precisely the books Grimmauld Place contained.
Another cousin had glanced her over, and commented, "Lovely darling", in the most sarcastic tone Aria had ever heard, and she knew the underline meaning actually meant, "Couldn't have you found someone with compatible magic that was ... prettier, Draco. Because she is not fooling anyone".
He still couldn't believe he had transformed over how she had been treated by her relatives - but he couldn't just let it continue ... yes he had done things in the past, and most likely he would have enjoyed the sight of someone treating and talking to like dirt when he was younger - but he knew better now, wanted to be better.
Draco's eyes told Aria, she wasn't exactly wrong as they darted all around to check where they all were, as he closed off his composure, but no one made a move towards them.
Weasley seemed to be unsure on whether he should leave or if he wanted to remain, and hissed under his breath, though he did leave the room, to what seemed to be at Granger's insistence. Draco was surprised he hadn't actually come across the Weasley family before now, considering how close Aria was to them.
The girl just shrugged, and she took a seat opposite him, 'Aria says the same thing ... well sometimes.'
Aria was no fool, she knew no one would dare attack her, not when they had Draco's wrath to deal with. Which is why she gathered she had been led here alone.
'I know, I heard them too,' Draco said, and he was unsurprised by Aria not entering too. Epsilon jumped onto his free lap, curling herself once she had deemed herself comfortable enough.
She wondered if for a moment she had offended Narcissa by repeating the words, as the woman had grown so cold so quickly and looked ready to tear something apart. 'That was not aimed at you ... but Draco's - he hasn't been able to ... transform as he should - I thought that - your compatible magic might have something to do with the trouble he has been having ... now I suggest we get you changed back into that stunning ball gown. I should think by now Draco has grown worried.'
Aria had forgotten in her haste to find out what the runes meant, that she had asked Fleur that question. 'It does.'
'Yeah, like I said, brightest in our year. Only ever beat her in Defence Against the Dark Arts.' Aria said as the bell rung, ending lunchtime, 'speaking of which, that's where I should be heading now.'
'I do but I'll admit it he might have put me off. I'll see him thirty-first - spend the whole day if that's OK.'
'Yes, you did. But you've been doing so much with the Headmistress setting up all the group activities. I shouldn't have asked for your help -'
'I think most of us do,' Blaise replied, 'Potter - the odds - and still she managed to beat him- Pansy regrets it most - after speaking out in the Great Hall.'
Something odd was definitely happening though, but Aria could not figure out what it was. Something felt different - and it had something to do with Malfoy, she was sure of that. It always happened when Malfoy was around, the air seemed to tingle and it felt oddly warm. The sensation would go away so quickly, that at first, she thought she had been imagining it. But it kept reoccurring.
'Neumann?' Blaise laughed, 'you think this is about Neumann putting you on your arse. Man, Draco, open your eyes. It's about you!'
'Well you did ask me -' Aria shook her head at him and turned around almost running into the seemly empty room, for the only thing the room contained was charmed snow.
Draco could not believe he was doing this. How had Potter managed to talk him onto getting on this flying Muggle death trap, again? At least Potter's cousin wouldn't have to go through with his threat of "kicking his arse", Potter was clearly enjoying herself, she looked like she was loving every minute of his predicament. Potter giggled herself silly as the flying contraption took off, while Draco's death-like grip did not falter until the aeroplane touched soil again. Somehow he knew that not telling him how they were exactly getting to their destination had been apart of her revenge for the announcement of their engagement. Draco dreaded to think of what else he had to look forward to that Potter had "planned" not to tell him. Three weeks of being in Potter's presence had better be worth all this trouble.
'Don't mention it, Granger,' Draco stated firmly, 'Seriously don't mention it. The debt has been repaid, Aria saved my life too.'
'Don't you dare -' his mother said, 'don't you dare transform to try and comfort me - it is not I that you owe an apology to.'
'Don't make excuses for him ... please,' Ron said, 'I can just about handle you agreeing to do this.'
'Well your knowledge is very vast, Draco,' Blaise said, and the common room portrait burst open again, Aria, Weasley, and Granger were joined by several other Gryffindors. 'It will give you a chance to prove a point to your cousin.' Blaise murmured as the Gryffindors grew closer. A chance to show up Cygnus, Draco liked the sound of that, his cousin should have never underestimated him.
'Draco's looking for you.' Hermione said softly. 'We had to tell him about the wand testing, or he would have searched the whole school for you.'
Anger boiled inside him as the lesson continued, with dueling covered, Cygnus was now going over the theory into the Patronus Charm. The Charm he knew his girlfriend could perform effortlessly. Who in the wizarding community didn't know that information.
Of course, her friends had realised she had not meant it. How could she mean it? It was almost impossible to refuse Teddy - especially when he used his Metamorphmagus powers. Teddy looked rather silly at times, with his ever-changing hair and recently he started changing the shape of his nose.
'Yes thank you,' Draco said, 'I'll escort you to the room you'll be staying in - let you get settled -'
'That'll be dad,' Dudley said, looking towards the front door. Draco heard footsteps going away from them, what sounded like talking, then a few minutes later a beefy-looking man walked into the sitting room.
Aria sat up and wrapped her covers around her more tightly, she couldn't stop herself from shivering. She had only been back at number four Privet Drive for a few days, but away from Hogwarts for over a week, Aria had not wanted to return to Privet Drive but she had after-all said she would help out, it didn't mean she liked being stuck back in her old bedroom - even if Dudley had finally cleared out all his old broken toys. Aria shivered once more, Epsilon stuck her head up from her basket, her grey head tilted to its side almost in a questioning manner.
'Weasley was muttering aloud something similar, the other day,' Draco said, scratching behind Epsilon's ear, earning him a content purr. 'But as far as I'm aware she's at Quidditch practice, last game of the year is coming up, and yet again Gryffindor are in the running to win it.'
Aria got up to her feet - she would not cry - she would not cry due to a bunch of big-headed Malfoy's. She crossed the room to the dresser table ... and looked into the mirror ...
'I'm Alana, Alana Williams.' the girl frowned, 'If this is the way to the platform - then why are you just staring it, why haven't you gone through yet?'
The only reason she knew it was Voldemort's main plan was that the news had been delivered to her two weeks before her return to Hogwarts: DUMBLEDORE DEAD. This news had caused a mass celebration. Voldemort seemed to be in a boastful powerful mood. And today she would learn why Snape had been tortured by Voldemort. They had gathered in the small hall once more, Voldemort and all his supporters.
'He didn't try anything - did he?' Ginny asked, eyebrows raised, 'because all bets are off if he did!'
Fleur considered this for a moment, 'Some families ... I heard still follow them, I could not be able to tell which ones though. It is unlikely given your nature that Draco Malfoy would follow those traditions even if his family did. You are a very independent person. No, I think it must be to do with the rune meanings themselves and the protection charms the bracelet contains, for the reason into why he wished for you to wear it ... again.'
'He didn't like it -' Hermione said, she was no longer looking at the picture, 'I remember the look upon his face - he didn't want us to be tortured.'
Aria seemed perplexed, though she said nothing as they continued to walk. Once they had reached a disused sitting room, Draco opened the door and stepped to one side, letting Aria walk through first. She had taken two steps before she spun around her mouth agape.
Something just didn't feel quite right to Aria. For at least half an hour she stared down her reflection in the long mirror. Her hair had been put into a beautiful knot, the black lace and cream sleeveless and strapless dress, fitted her perfectly. But Aria felt like she didn't recognize the person that was staring back at her from the mirror. Maybe it was the way the dress made her skin look oddly paler than usual. She looked like - well - like a Malfoy, or to be exact; how Mrs Malfoy looked - elegant and beautiful. Aria wrung her hands together nervously, she could do this, if the gathering tonight was to welcome her into the fold, then it was as good as any night to show those stupid cousins of Draco's that they were wrong.
On what must have been sheer instinct Aria's head turned towards him - the next thing he was aware of was intense emerald eyes, full of emotion; surprise, and something else he couldn't quite grasp.
Dudley was about to speak but he stopped as the door Aria indicated to flew open, to reveal a beefy-looking woman.
It turned out Narcissa had been right, as soon they left the room, Draco had been walking briskly towards them.
'Yeah, Dudley has it all planned,' Aria said, feeling slightly guilty, she had not had the chance to tell them Draco had been invited to go along ... and she had been avoiding it - considering they were her friends ... she had not extended the invitation mostly because Ginny would be too young to go ... and she hadn't wanted to leave anyone out. There was also the fact she had brought a new black dress - which clung to her frame - she had planned on wearing ... because she wanted to annoy the hell out of Draco, and tease him just slightly. 'I don't know how to break it to him ... that I am not drinking as much as he plans for me to drink.'
'Well I didn't invite him,' Aria retorted, 'Considering she's here-' Aria's head indicated to a room that Draco could just make out. 'I've told him to leave - stubborn git won't listen to me ... you try.'
'This is different though,' Bill said, holding up his own wrist, upon his own thick bracelet had been placed. 'the Charms don't wear off - they don't need replacing - but in a sense, yes that's how it works.'
Draco's head snapped up, 'What did you expect me to do, Aria?' his stormy grey eyes full of anger and a hint of determination, 'Do nothing? Let them your aunt and uncle shout at you ... like that - they called you useless, your uncle called you a freak!'
Mrs Weasley's hand squeezed her shoulder, 'You're looking a little pasty, are you coming down with something?'
Well, Draco had not been expecting that, as far as he was aware his son could barely stand this girl for he had recognised the name straight away.
'Oh don't sound so surprised, it's not like I'm fearless or something. Of course, I get terrified,' Aria said, 'I just choose not to let fear overcome me, I have and will always face it head-on.'
'Good.' George nodded firmly, a squeal of laughter made Draco turn his head back, Teddy was laughing with Aria, having found whatever she had done funny. 'Ron wants to kill you if you hurt her.' And Draco turned his head back towards George Weasley, finding a serious expression on his face. 'I've managed to convince him that is a bad idea.' Draco arched his eyebrows in a questioning manner. 'No, I've told him to let you live ... so that if you do hurt her, you can spend the rest of your pathetic little life regretting doing so.'
'I know,' Aria whispered back, though she no longer trembled, her fisted hand remained clenched at her side.
'I didn't want to worry you,' Aria said softly, she hated the look of disappointment Mrs Weasley was currently giving her. 'Any of you ... you have your own things to be worrying about. You don't need me to add to it. Besides, it's only for a year. I can handle it, I can handle them.'
Draco gave a shudder, 'Our magic is not a match ... we are not compatible, I doubt I would even if we had have been.' He stared at his grandmother curiously, 'How did you find out - mother said that they had not been overheard -'
'Well we are going to be stuck here for quite some time, and I really would like to have you checked over.'
'I've been meaning to ask,' Hermione said, 'where did you get Epsilon's name from? You got Hedwig's from History of Magic - but you never took Arithmancy and I know it has a mathematical meaning -'
She could still not believe she was actually here, sitting there, in a large sitting room in their Manor, drinking tea. Because coming to Malfoy Manor had been a toll in itself, especially after the last time she had been here. That last visit where Hermione had been tortured, Dobby killed, by Mrs Malfoy's own sister hands, well Aria did not want to think on those advents. But Aria could not ignore the facts, and if Mrs Malfoy wanted to call in her life debt, she was entailed to, then she had to be here and listen to what Narcissa Malfoy wanted for repayment. But this? Aria had not been expecting this! Aria still did not understand why Malfoy wasn't protesting against his mother, why he wasn't saying something - anything! Surely he knew how much of a bad idea this was. They could never - not in a million years - they could not even stand one another. Granted he had saved her life, and she, his, but this - marriage! - it was too much to expect from them both.
'I will tell you this ... Veelas are engrossed with finding their compatible matches Aria - very engrossed, the reason he asked you wear that the bracelet again comes back to his inheritance.'
Draco charmed music to sound throughout the room, 'Well my lady, as I said, you did ask ... now would you care to dance with me, we're hardly going to get cold, so I don't see why not.'
When his mother had told him of her plan, he had his doubts naturally, but so far Potter was going along with it. All was not lost. But a year! It just didn't seem long enough. And Potter had not taken any notice of their compatible magic before, why would she now? His mother seemed calm like she had woman's intuition or something ... she certainly knew something Draco didn't, but did not and would not tell him.
Draco got to his feet, wondering why, until he realised he had not been concentrating on what McGonagall had been saying, and she had asked the Head Boys and Girls to make themselves known.
'In the Muggle world - you turn of age at eighteen - and basically ... it involves a lot of drink,' Aria shook her head, 'Speaking of which - you're officially invited to come along Draco.'
"Voldemort my dear has a secret," Dumbledore said. "One he never told his fellow companions. One I only ever had theories about."
With his warning made, George Weasley made his way back towards his family, who hadn't even noticed he had wandered off.
'That's enough from you -' Aria looked around the destroyed marquee. 'How in Merlin's name are we going to sort this in time for tomorrow!'
Draco scowled at the sound of his friend's very frustrated voice, of course, he wasn't over it; Pansy should have known this, known him better by now. Draco felt so embarrassed, and although he had promised himself not to get worked up over his cousin's and Aria's magical compatibility, he couldn't help but do just that. Given how much time he had, he just had to make this year worth something, had to make it count.
Aria began to tremble as soon as she stepped out of the school carriages. This had been the thing she was most nervous about in returning to Hogwarts. She had no time to stop at the sight of the Great Hall doors, but hands had taken hers - hands she knew without even looking to belong to Ron and Hermione - she squeezed them to return her thanks, and together they crossed the Great Hall.
Draco's wings opened up, though he did not retract them, flexing his wings, he felt rather sore. 'Lead the way, my lady, I can't let you out of my sight right now.' Aria raised her eyebrows. 'It's a Veela thing.'
Draco huffed, there was still so much Aria had to learn about Veela. 'I can't move - not until you tell me your OK - I reacted because you were - you would have been hurt.'
They had always attracted each other's attention, thinking back on it, he should have realised it. He would have done things differently - very differently. Potter's magic was unlike anything else he had ever felt, it was pure, honest, timid, and at times dangerous. Her magic was a lot of things, but Potter when dangerous - that was not a good combination. And his own would respond to it, why else would he seek her out, like a lovesick puppy - taunt her, fancy her - Merlin he fancied her, dorky glasses an all. That had been the hardest thing to admit, to figure out.
Tuesday started long for Blaise, he woke up to Ron throwing things all over the room in search for who knew what.
"He's not that bad you know," Neville spoke up, "He's been helping with Professor Sprout's and my project and he's very helpful."
Draco sat in the bath until the water ran cold and then drug himself out unwillingly. When he walked out he found Harry writing his potions essay, a look of concentration on his face. That concentration was quickly ruined as he noticed Draco and his face quickly colored, thinking about the night before.
"That's true. My parents want me home for most of the break and they aren't even wizards, I'm just hoping I can come to your house for a bit of it," Hermione said. (I'd like to note that i'm imagining she went to find her parents during the summer after the war ended and restored their memories, as it's not really a key event in this story I'm not really going to cover it.)
"Yeah, it's Luna," she said with a bit of a laugh, "I suppose I should at least finish my announcement though, and say I'm bi."
"Well, not every single one," Draco explained, "Marriages are typically arranged, unless you pick well on your own. That means that I should be looking for potential matches at the balls, or my parents would pick for me. Though, as you know, I'm not particularly interested in women," both Harry and Draco blushed as they remembered their last time up at the top of the astronomy tower.
"No problem, I'll come grab you when I'm done with it," she said with a smile, slipping around him to continue down the aisle, "I've got to get some homework now tho, so I'll see you around."
"Yep. Fine. Spiffing!" Harry turned and rushed up the stairs, Hermione and Ron watching helplessly from the couch.
"Okay, what are we playing first?" Pansy said, reaching forward and grabbing a bottle of firewhisky from the center. Dean and Seamus showed up with an armful each of alcohol at which Hermione sighed and told them to set it down in the middle of their circle along with the food Harry and Ron picked up.
"Nothing much," Harry said and Draco raised an eyebrow at him. "It was something personal that she's dealing with." Harry let out a sigh, Draco was awfully nosy.
"Ex-Death Eater," Harry corrected, "We've been over this. Plus Hogwarts would be honored to have you teaching there."
"We can't just let him continue to walk around and do and say whatever he wants with no consideration for anyone!" Ron shot back.
“I like you, Draco, and I was too nervous to tell you and instead said something stupid,” Harry said, finally dropping his gaze down to Draco’s hands, too nervous to look him in his eyes.
"Sure, maybe one day," Harry bumped his shoulder against Draco's, giving him a small smile, "Cheer up, I'll still let you eat some of the cake Ron certainly bought for our win."
"Alright," Harry said, watching a moment as Draco quickly got up to put on clothes, and then quickly following suit.
Luna and Ginny went next and Harry's turn came after. The pile of paper slowly dwindled as they went through all the papers.
Harry watched the way Draco's eyes lit up as he talked about it, the corner of Draco's mouth twitching up into a small smile as he laughed. Harry really liked his smile and wished he would do it more often.
Harry trailed his lips down to Draco's jaw line, moving to gently brush his lips against Draco's neck when he shifted his head up, giving Harry more access. Draco let out a shaky breath when Harry let his teeth graze his neck, his breath catching in his throat as Harry lightly bit down. When Harry pulled back to capture Draco's lips again, Draco's head was fuzzy, all previous jealousy long forgotten.
"Slept with me?" Harry laughed and Draco got redder if at all possible. "Relax, I'm not angry." Harry rolled out of bed to get his clothes and head to the bathroom, "that was probably the best I've slept in a while."
"Well here he is," Pansy said, way too happy for Draco's taste, "Go on draco." Pansy smirked at Draco and he shot a glare at her in return and followed Harry out of the room.
"So? Everyone deserves second chances. He hasn't done a single thing wrong this whole year so far, and has been nice as far as nice goes for him. He's been nice to you right, Harry?"
"It's alright, I don't blame you for wanting to help," Harry let out a sigh, "It wasn't that bad, I'm sure other people have it worse. They really only made me do the chores and cooking and stuff. My cousin, Dudley, liked to push me around a bit. My uncle would really only lay hands on me when he was having a particularly bad day."
Ron was seated at a table in the three broomsticks, waiting for Hermione to return from the restroom when Ginny and Luna entered.
"Thanks for your help," Blaise laughed, suddenly growing nervous as he realized he didn't exactly know what to say next.
"As you all know, we have eighth years for the first time this year, and as such accommodations have been made. At the end of the feast, all eighth years please follow Madam Hooch to your dormitories and they have been combined this year. For the sake of keeping with the theme of inter-house unity this year, you will be allowed to choose your roommate. Though some rules apply: you may not room with someone of the opposite gender and your roommate needs to be someone of a different house. Now, enjoy the feast." Groans rang out at the news of having to room with someone from another house, but they quickly settled down at the sight of food.
"I still can't believe you snuck into the Slytherin common rooms with Polyjuice potion!" Draco laughed leaning further into Harry and laying his head on his shoulder. He'd rather die than admit that he was quite enjoying it though.
Harry pressed his lips to Draco's when the door to their room closed and Draco leaned into it almost immediately, his eyes fluttering closed. Harry could feel Draco smiling into the kiss and he let out a small laugh.
"We should come here sometime with your friends and mine sometime. This has been kinda fun," Harry said, leaning his chin in his hand and gazing over at Draco who was sorting through the things he bought and placing them all in one bag.
"Luna right?" Ron said, seemingly unsure now, "You're making me question it now though. It is Luna right?"
"Me too," Harry laughed, changing into his pajamas. He rarely wore them, but he figured he probably shouldn't show up to Draco's in his boxers and he didn't feel like changing before he left.
"Uh, hi Zabini," Neville replied. Blaise had changed since the war, well everyone had for that matter, but Blaise had definitely changed for the better. Although Neville still didn't really consider them to be friends. Not that he minded Blaise calling out to him in the slightest though, as Blaise's voice was something Neville didn't mind hearing so much and that had nothing to do with the faint blush that spread over his cheeks. Nothing at all.
"Ron and I can get food from the kitchen, and you could let everyone know, Hermione. You actually talk to everyone," Harry said.
"Yeah, they're one of the more common plants here. There's an area over there," Draco pointed off to his right but the place was so dense with greenery that Harry had no idea exactly what he was pointing at, "that is filled with wolfsbane. It was planted here during the war, we only had a couple of them, but with Fenrir Greyback living here we planted more to be safe."
"Uh," Harry said, feeling slightly stupid but all the colors were hurting his brain and he felt very tired.
"Just because he hasn't tried to let any Dark Lords into the castle this semester, doesn't make him any less of a git," Ron mumbled and picked up his pace to go into Honey dukes.
"I don't eat it all in one sitting," Harry said, bumping his shoulder against Draco's playfully. "I like to have candy on hand at all times."
Pansy plucked up the bottle next, "Alright, my turn! Let's see some real action!" With a flourish she spun the bottle until it landed on Hermione.
Harry’s other hand quickly found its way to Draco’s hip as Draco’s wound their way behind Harry’s neck.
"Unlike you, I watch where I'm going. I don't slam into others, though I'm sure you are just used to bumping into others, living at the Weasley's cramped house all summer. That's where you were for the summer, I'm sure," he knew if Pansy where around she'd only say that that comment proved her point as who would pay such good attention to Potter to know where he was for the summer unless he cared about him, but right now Draco didn't care, "with so many kids, much more than they have the money to afford things must have been cramped-"
After a moment, Draco realized he wasn't planning on continuing without prompting, "And? Were you just going to leave it at that?"
"I'm bored~" Draco said. He had landed on his stomach on Harry's back and crawled up so that his face was smooshed between Harry's shoulder and head. Harry tried to push Draco off of himself, but Draco wouldn't be so easily tipped.
When Harry returned, they headed down to the pitch together and found a seat in the stands near a group of students that looked like first years.
"Regular sense of style. Regular friends. Regular interests. Regular eyes. Regular face," Draco was ticking off his fingers.
"Nah, everyone's been talking too much to get much done anyway," Ron replied, "Where did you go anyway, you disappeared right after breakfast."
"Like I look neon or something?" Ron asked and Harry turned to look at him, taking in the red haze around his friend.
The rest of the week flew by faster than Harry expected and pretty soon he was greeting Hermione, with Ron, at the door on New Years.
"Alright, I'm probably going to head to bed now too," Hermione said and Harry checked the clock on the wall. Only twenty minutes after midnight, he was doing good for time.
"I was going to say, did you know that apparently Weasley and Potter were talking about starting two eighth-year quidditch teams. Like so people can still play if they want. Beats me how they'd find enough people willing to play to make two teams, but it does sound interesting doesn't it?"
Blaise gulped, he knew whatever he chose it would be bad, especially after the dare Harry had to do. "Dare," Blasie said, resigned to having to do the dare.
As the night progressed though, nothing had happened, and Draco was wondering if he’d guessed wrong. Dinner came and went and then Dessert and then Harry had paid the check. Draco was beyond confused to say the least.
"Thanks, I'll head off to bed then, see you in the morning," Harry said turning to head over to grab his trunk and make his way to his room.
Luna and Ginny were back as well and were seated between Seamus and Harry on the other side of the circle. Ginny was already drinking out of a cup Seamus had handed to her and Hermione was sending looks at Dean who was ignoring her.
"Too true. Keep on being unladylike, maybe you'd actually get a girlfriend," Blaise smirked and Pansy elbowed him in the ribs.
"You can't just blame it on him, I know you were both involved," Hermione said as she came to sit down again.
Draco looked at Harry for a long moment and Harry was beginning to feel awkward when Draco let out a long sigh, "Fine, but if something happens to me, you'll have to answer to my father."
"Harry!" he suddenly heard Ron's voice shout when he neared the house. "Where have you been?! We've been looking for you for ten minutes! Mum's worried sick!"
Hermione looked up from her book to find Harry absently drawing on a corner of his parchment. “Harry, I’ve been meaning to ask, are you alright? You’ve seemed kind of off all day since the Quidditch match. You and Draco didn’t get into a fight, right?”
"They wouldn't care. I'm a traitor for being friends with you, even if the war is over. It wouldn't matter if I got hit with the potion to them," Draco said grimly. Harry watched the way his eyes seemed to get a bit clouded as he avoided Harry's eyes. Harry couldn't help notice the red haze that surrounded him though and wondered if the potion had gotten in his eyes or something.
"I'm going to take this to Professor Snape and see what he has to say. I believe that you are right though, thank you for bringing this to me," she said with a small smile, "I'll let you know what he says."
"I like Liquorice wands and chocolate cauldrons," Draco responded, running his hand over a selection of Fizzing Wizzbees. "What about you?"
When morning came, Harry awoke to a head of blond hair in his face and arms wrapped tightly around him. He didn't remember anything from the night before and froze a bit in shock.
"Come on Malfoy, let's just get the dare done with," Harry said, getting up and walking over to Draco who started to back up. Part of Harry's brain was telling him that he should be reacting like Ron was to the dare and be refusing to do it as Draco was, but a much larger part of his brain wanted to do it so so bad. He was dying to know what it felt like to kiss Draco and he had no idea when he was going to get another chance like this; he felt a bit embarrassed over how bad he suddenly wanted to kiss him but told himself that he could always blame it on alcohol the next morning.
"Because it's all juvenile prank materials. You could cause a better prank with magic from your own wand, and that's free."
As soon as Draco was settled back on the bed, Harry was in his lap, grinding his hips down as Draco breathed shakily out his nose. Draco's hands rose up to grip onto Harry's hips as he ground down on him, their clothes the only thing between them.
"You know that Neville's just helping me with Herbology!" Blaise shouted back, suddenly very embarrassed.
Herbology was his second class of the day and by the time he got there he was well and truly annoyed.
"Fine. truse," Draco finally said, reaching out to shake Harry's hand. What have I gotten myself into, "Now hurry up, before McGonagall finds us and gives us another punishment."
"Dean, Seamus, and Smith; Done." Ron said, leaning back slightly and crossing his arms over his chest.
"Of course! I wouldn't say it if I didn't think so. Even rusty, you're still great at the game, and after a few practices I'm sure you'll warm right up."
"Lavender," Ron responded with a snicker and Hermione went to flip the coin. Lavender watched very intently, overly curious what Ron had said her name to, but the coin landed on tails and Lavender sat back with a sulky sigh.
The park was nearby and was one Harry and Draco liked to frequent. At night it was lit up with pretty lights and it was kept well cleaned, it had to be one of Draco's favorite places.
No one else seemed to know either and when he related this to his mother, it sent her into a state of panic and in a minute everyone was looking for Harry, per her instructions.
"Well, the bubotuber I'm supposed to be taking care of doesn't really look like it's doing too good. I was wondering if you could take a look at it, and tell me what I'm doing wrong?"
Good luck with your parents, remember I'm here if you need and if it goes too horribly you can always come here no matter what. Not to worry you, but be safe okay?
"Exactly, it's part of the game," Seamus added, the shit-eating grin that had crossed his face when Harry was dared to kiss Draco still there.
"Well maybe you should take her advice. Maybe you'll get a man," Blaise said jokingly, and an eyebrow cocked.
“Mhmm,” Pansy said and turned to appraise Draco’s outfit of sweatpants, “Is that what you’re wearing to lunch?”
He let out a sigh as he took in his hair. He didn't always sleek it back anymore and had recently let it hang a bit loose around his head. Would he like it better if I styled it? Draco asked as he ran his hands through the slightly damp strands, or should I leave it?
"If I could, I'd kiss you right now," Harry said, reaching a hand under the table and brushing his fingers across Draco's.
Draco rolled on his back then and stared up at the canopy above him then. Why did I run away? I like him, quite a lot, and that was wonderful, Draco thought to himself. He rose his hands up to his head and ran them through his hair. The kissing was amazing if Draco was being honest and, for a moment, he entertained the idea of jumping up from bed and going to the bathroom to snog Harry again. He stayed in bed though. Was he crazy or stupid? If his father ever caught wind of it, he was for sure going to end him.
Draco's hands were just gripping the base of Harry's jumper to pull it up when Harry suddenly snapped out of it.
"Yeah, I get you, but I suppose you should just be happy that it seems to be simple right? I am at least. On a brighter note though, would you like to work on homework together and then we could go up to the astronomy tower or something."
They were planning to meet at 10:30 and it was already ten. Harry looked himself over in the mirror again and decided it couldn't hurt to brush his teeth again. Twenty minutes of pacing nervously around the room later, Harry was putting on his shoes and rushing down to the entrance of Hogwarts where they planned to meet.
Of course, that wasn't the only reason. There was also the slight issue that Harry was a boy and so was he, which was something his father would be anything but pleased to find out about. What would he do if his father found out? Draco suddenly thought. It was bad enough that he was kissing Harry at the parties, at least those could be explained away with the excuse of it being a game, but there was no way to explain actually liking him. The thought sent a shiver up his spine and he felt himself beginning to panic just over the idea of it. He had no idea what to do besides just ignoring it, so that's what he decided to do. He would ignore his feelings for Harry and they'd eventually go away.
Draco had Harry pinned on the floor and was about to land another punch when the door flew open and they froze.
“I know that, I’m worried about my feet. At this rate I’m going to need shoes with steel at the toes.”
When they finally reached the dining hall it was already packed with people and they had to squeeze in to fit near Hermione and Ron at the table.
"Yeah, apparently his dad was angry about it at first, but got used to the idea or something I suppose."
Ginny felt it was funny how tiny it was for such a big thing. She could hear the birds chirping outside the window in the crisp November air and she could see Pigwidgeon sitting on the window sill, waiting for the note, she let out a sigh.
"Wait," Draco said, "Take yours off too." Draco watched his face turn even redder as he removed his hands from Draco and pulled his own shirt off. Draco took a moment to revel in the view of Harry's thin frame before leaning forward to capture his lips  again.
"Good morning," Harry replied. His voice was a little husky from sleep and Draco liked the sound of it.
"Oh stuff it Weasley," Pansy laughed, and like that the moment was over, the tension could be cut with a knife.
Lavender turned the pitcher over her head and the circle of eighth years watched as it soaked her and evaporated before it hit the ground. Pansy snickered as Lavender's makeup ran down her face and she replaced the pitcher onto the counter. Lavender walked dejectedly back to her spot in the circle and sat down, still dripping wet. Everyone quietly snickered as they watched her.
"Yeah," Pansy said, finishing, "You look hot now, I'd date you if I wasn't a flaming gay." Pansy gave him her most winning smile and patted him on the shoulder.
Draco studied him for a moment before standing up, pulling Harry with him. "Come on, let's step out."
Draco found Harry already waiting for him by the entrance to the common room as he made it down stairs, "Hey."
"Wow," Draco breathed. It was really pretty, especially with the moonlight filtering in and bouncing off the walls.
"Both of you shut up or we're doing yours next, Draco." Draco gulped and shut his mouth. "Step three: ask to hang out with him outside of the project."
Draco gave him a funny look then as they made it around the corner to where the eighth-year dorms were.
"Well maybe I've just realized that I needed to grow up. There's a lot more important things than blood status," a murmur went around the room but Draco didn't feel an ounce of regret, "Maybe you should try it." With that he turned back around to head to his room, leaving the shocked Slytherin's on the steps.
Harry's lips trailed their way down to Draco's neck and he pressed light kisses to Draco's skin as he made his way toward his collarbone. Draco let out a soft groan and ground down into Harry.
To get to his bed, Harry had to cross in front of Draco's and Draco peeked over his book to watch him as he crossed the room. He watched as Harry flopped into his bed and let out a groan.
Draco's head tilted then and pressed his lips harder to Harry's and suddenly their kisses became hungry. Draco moved closer to Harry so that their bodies ground against each other and Harry let out a low groan.
"Sorry, sorry. Want me to get Pansy? I'm sure she'll bring some alcohol. The best remedy for a broken heart."
“I still can’t believe you got a dog,” Draco said, peering down at the dachshund that had run up to greet him when he entered Pansy’s house. They’d just finished their lunch and Pansy had insisted he come to her house to get ready for dinner.
Harry didn't know this either and decided he really needed to ask Draco about what he did when he wasn't with him when he got back.
When they entered the dorm they were instantly bombarded with the scent of alcohol and a stream of confetti.
"You are the most annoying person I know," Draco grumbled. Harry snickered and Draco glared at Harry. Harry quickly shot his head back down to his work and pretended he hadn't just been listening to their conversation.
“You were going to ask him to the Yule Ball?!” Ron burst in, earning exasperated looks from both Harry and Hermione. “What? Don’t look at me like that! You like him back then?”
“You got it,” Harry said, heading to pick something out, Draco following behind, fingers intertwined.
"And as for if the effects had mixed, can you think of any kind of mix that would be useful to them?"
"Have you tried product?" Draco asked, his long fingers messing with the comforter, drawing Harry's attention.
Harry and Draco had made their way up the winding staircase to the top of the astronomy tower when it was still bright out. It was dark now though, and they hadn't even made a move to leave. Draco was leaning into Harry's shoulder, laughing at something Harry couldn't remember saying. It was long past curfew and they were both loopy with exhaustion.
"Hey, I thought you were giving out position assignments? Congrats again on being team captain by the way!"
Draco let out a sigh as he turned the page of his own textbook and jotted down a couple notes Harry's stomach flipped a bit and had trouble trying to focus back on his work.
He had taken one of the Patil twins in fourth year, but the whole thing was kind of a mess and he didn't want to put either of them through that again. All his friends had boyfriends and girlfriends now as well, so it wasn't like he could go with someone just as friends.
Draco sat next to him for the match but not as close as he normally did, a foot of space between them, and when the match ended he quickly left muttering excuses. Harry supposed he deserved that.
"What's wrong?" Draco asked after a few minutes, feeling slightly self conscious, Harry had been practically staring at him since they left.
"Harry," Draco shook Harry awake a little more violently than he probably needed to, but he was currently shaking a bit in a panic and needed Harry awake now.
"Oh," Harry said, and then suddenly he had an idea. He quickly stepped in front of the door, successfully trapping Draco in the room.
Draco's hands traveled down to the bottom of Harry's shirt and pulled it up slightly, his cool hands sliding under the fabric. A shiver went down Harry's spine and he moved his own hands to Draco's hips.
The walk to Hogsmeade was cold and they were both shivering even with heating charms when they made it to the three broomsticks.
He knew he was zoning out, but he was quickly jolted out of his thoughts as Draco turned and Harry quickly avoided his eyes. It was weird to stare.
"What?! No no no-," Ron finally burst out, successfully dragging over the eyes of just about everyone else in the dining hall.
Lavender offered to go first and with a spin of the bottle, the first pair was picked to be Lavender and Goyle. Lavender got up to sit in front of Goyle, after a bit of complaining. Almost as soon as it started, Goyle pulled away. It's not that he didn't think she was pretty or anything, but the idea of kissing someone was very unappealing and he pulled back after a couple seconds.
Practice was awkward again and had people curious. Harry tried his best to avoid Draco during practice to quench some of the curiosity, but it seemed to only make it worse as people seemed to pick up on that too. When it finally ended for the day, Harry left as fast as he could.
"Wish we were still seventh years, we could've been playing today," Ron said next to Harry, getting wrapped up in the excitement.
Draco cautiously took a seat next to Harry and felt very self conscious as people started to filter into the room and some looked over at the group confused.
Draco let out a shaky breath as Harry ran his lips to the scars that littered his abdomen, his tongue tracing its way down them and to his navel.
I'm glad you had a good Christmas, mine was nice too. I got some clothing and a new potions kit. I can only imagine how atrocious this jumper is going to be.
Draco turned the parchment over and opened it with a curious look, "A blank piece of parchment? I hate to tell you this, but I have seen a lot of parchment before," he said jokingly.
The next two days seemed like they'd never pass in Harry's opinion, but soon it was Halloween and Draco had agreed to go with him to Hogsmeade for their first date.
"Oh! No, no, it's fine!" the poor girl managed to get out as her face seemed to color another shade darker, "I'll uh, head back to my table now... s-sorry to bother you." Harry felt extremely bad as he watched her retreating form return to her table.
Draco used some spell that Harry couldn't hear to remove the red rings from his eyes from crying before heading down to breakfast.
Draco slowly pulled away to remove their masks, and casted them to the side and took in Harry's flushed face. Draco let his hands brush down his sides until he found the bottom of Harry's shirt (thank god he didn't wear one of those super complicated costumes like most of the others, Draco thought.) Draco reached his hands under the hem and ran them up the bare skin of Harry's stomach. Harry gasps and Draco takes the chance to brush his tongue against Harry's.
Luna ended up not having to let Seamus do her hair and the game continued. Both Seamus and Dean ended up shirtless along the way, Ginny and Luna had shared a short kiss that left them blushing, and many other dares were given that weren't fulfilled as the numbers didn't match.
When she reached the top of the stairs she turned the doorknob to their shared dorm room to find both boys tumbling over each other and a mess of blankets that seemed to be Harry's bedsheets. The sight of Harry and Draco smiling and messing around brought a smile to her face and she burst out laughing at how odd the sight was.
Harry had let go of Draco's hand when they stood up, but he wished he could take it again. He felt slightly jealous of Ron and Hermione's easy display of affection.
Harry chuckled to himself as he watched them bicker and was slightly startled by a small cough from a Ravenclaw girl who had walked up in front of Harry without him realizing. The girl didn't seem to be much younger than Harry but judging by the fact he had no clue who she was he guessed she was a sixth or seventh year.
Harry shifted his head to the side so he was looking at Draco with a lop-sided grin. Draco found himself grinning back before he could stop it. "You don't talk to your bed? Who here is really the crazy one?"
Harry threw on his own pants and a sweatshirt before leading the way down to the kitchen to get started on breakfast. Harry always made the breakfast since the last time Draco tried he almost caught the entire kitchen on fire.
"Good cause I wasn't going to let you say no," Draco returned Harry's smile as they made it back to the Gryffindor changing rooms.
They made it back up to their room in silence and Harry realized as they stepped through the door that he had no idea what they were going to do for the entire hour that they were going to be stuck together for. For the first time ever they had both found themselves with no homework for the night and Draco seemed to realize this too as he looked over at Harry.
"Thanks!" Hermione replied. Harry watched her walk over to the table and started to zone out again, but he didn't get much more thinking done, as a hand was placed on his shoulder once again.
"Stop calling him that," Harry said, returning Draco's glare. And we're back, Hermione thought, giving a slight sigh as she realized that it was too much to hope for that they might mellow out a bit.
When he appeared in front of Ron's house, he hurried towards it. It was already pretty bright out and he knew they'd be waking up soon if they weren't already awake that was.
"Yeah, let's all go to bed. Come on Harry," Hermione said, helping Harry up and giving him over to Ron to help him to bed.
"I noticed," Draco said, walking over to Harry's bed and sitting down next to him. Draco leaned his head against Harry's shoulder, "So what are we doing tonight? You promised a date."
"Yeah? And try and explain why I need them? No way in hell. I'd rather just suffer," Harry groaned, raking his fingers through his hair, "My ass is going to hurt so bad sitting on that broom."
"Sure you didn't. Anyway, Harry shouldn't just go out with someone simply because they're pretty. He made a good decision by not saying yes simply because she was good looking."
Hermione watched Harry warily as they headed back up to the dorms. She had noticed the tension during the practice and was interested to know what had caused it.
He wished he was hanging out with them now as he looked up from his textbook to observe the way Draco's hair fell across his face as he had taken to doing lately. He had decided in the last few days that Draco was one of the best looking boys in the whole school, and that he definitely had a massive crush on him.
"No one cares enough to listen in," Pansy waved his retort off, "It's only awkward right now because he's realizing his feelings for you."
"Sure," Harry said with a grin and rolled, pulling Draco on top of him and flipping their positions.
Hermione blushed at the praise, "I know you said you only saw four colors, but are they different shades? Because, my first thought was that maybe the colors correspond to soulmates, and that's how the veritaserum ties in. Like only two people have the same shade as each other."
Harry's head was still whirring with ideas as to what Hermione thought the colors meant. They had agreed to talk about it at lunch because Hermione had decided they needed to pay attention to class and they couldn't do that if they were talking about the colors.
He was met with Draco leaning against the gate to the manor in skin tight black pants and a loose grey sweater. "You sure took your time," he smirked, pushing away from the gate to wrap his arms around Harry.
"We'll start practices after the tryouts for the house teams end, pass the word along okay?" Harry said as he hung the paper up on the board.
"Hey, Harry," Hermione said when she saw him enter, "I was just telling Ron that I'm hoping to make it to his house for New Years and then staying until we ride the Express back."
"Well it really isn't exclusive to muggles. It could be played by anyone really, you don't really even need to call is 20 questions if you didn't want to," Harry stopped when he saw Draco's unamused look and realized he was rambling. He sighed before continuing, "It's just a game where you get to ask each other 20 questions."
"Harry," Ron said rushing up to him, Hermione following behind, "we tried to help we really did. But no one would-"
"But I want to talk to you. It's already noon," Draco said. Harry flipped over then, managing to knock Draco off. He quickly climbed back on top of Harry though, they were chest to chest and Harry could feel all of Draco pressed against him, he felt a shiver run through him. Draco didn't seem to notice the effect he was having though and buried his face in Harry's neck. "I want to do something today but all you're doing is laying here."
"You should go," Harry said before he could stop himself, and blushed further when they both turned to look at him.
“Almost 10:30,” Draco said. They were silent a moment, not having moved away from each other yet and Harry’s hand had slipped lower again. Draco was sure he was doing that on purpose. His own dropped down to Harry’s elbow, tugging him foreward to meet him in an open-mouthed kiss.
"We're still stuck together," Harry replied, "friends? I'm sick of dancing around one another," Harry stuck out his hand.
"It's really fine, I won't tell Harry. And anyway, Malfoy might have a chance now that I'm thinking about it," Neville said thoughtfully as he walked to get the watering can.
"Fine, I guess I'll play but I get to ask first." Draco suddenly realized that this game might actually be a good idea as there were millions of questions that he wanted answers to. Like why he wanted a truce to begin with. Why he was being nice to him. Why he testified at his trial, he understood him testifying at his mothers, but his? No clue. He also wanted to know if he liked guys. Not for him of course, but so he could shut Pansy up.
Harry was opening his textbook when he heard, "Psst-" to his side. He turned to see Ron trying to get his attention.
"If we head back now, then we would have time to head up to the astronomy tower for a bit," Harry said, walking close enough to Draco that their shoulders brushed together, "We could eat some of this candy too."
"First it's a truce, now it's friends, what's next?" Draco said and Harry turned suddenly very red. They stared at each other for a moment too long and Draco quickly let go of Harry's hand. "I'm - I'm going to shower," Draco stuttered a bit, hurring over to his trunk to get his nightclothes out and rush to the bathroom. Harry watched him rush about with a small smile on his face.
"You're in love with someone now? Or just dizzy?" Ron said, this time with his mouth empty. Harry absentmindedly listened to his conversation as his head was spinning. It means I'm in love? No, of course not, it's just Luna's made up creatures again.
"You may be able to fool everyone else, but you can't fool me. I can see it in your eyes," Seamus said with a triumphant smile when Draco blushed lightly.
Harry had no plans to go around asking random girls, though, and for some reason the idea of bringing a date just didn't sit well with him.
"Hey did you take the potion Pomfrey gave you, today?" Hermione asked, watching as Harry poked at his food.
"No way, these are so rare! It's really beautiful," Draco breathed, running his hands over the fabric. Draco slid out from under the cloak, causing it to slide off Harry slightly, bringing his head and part of a shoulder into view. Draco walked around Harry checking out the cloak which made Harry go slightly red. "This was really your dad's?"
"I don't know what you're talking about," Draco said as they reached the door and he pushed it open.
"Alright," Ron said, feeling sort of nervous at the serious tone Ginny had used. He gestured to the booth and they sat down. "So what's up?"
"Yup," Harry said, pointing to their names at the top of the tower, side by side. It made him blush a bit, seeing their names all alone together at the top of the tower. "It shows where everyone is and it moves with them."
"Well, the only thing that Harry has been continuously obsessed with since first year has been Malfoy. And judging by what I've heard from you all, Malfoy seems to be in the same boat. I mean," Neville walked back over to the pot, blaise trailing behind him, and started watering the bubotuber, "Harry spent the whole of sixth year following Malfoy around school."
"Well, yeah," Ginny said, studying him, "but there are more than three sexualities you know, there are also people like Luna who are pansexual - meaning they don't care about gender - or asexual or androsexual, the list goes on."
Harry looked out over the field to where Ginny currently had the Quaffle, he was glad she was the new captain of the Quidditch team. She seemed to be a good pick for the spot as she was clearly very good at leading a team.
They stood like that for a moment in the middle of the corridor until Draco seemed to get an idea and jumped back a bit, "How do you even have an invisibility cloak?!" Draco said as he took in the cloak that currently draped part way around Harry's shoulders.
"I can't believe the first quidditch match is less than a month away," Harry said, halfway through his lunch.
"I'm heading to bed if you two are quite done," Draco stood up and left to go to his room. Harry was already asleep when he arrived and he paused to watch Harry a moment, trying desperately to sort out his own feelings.
"Ughhh-" Draco groaned, flopping face-first onto his bed, "I'm such an idiot to fall for him. I have absolutely no chance."
"Alright, alright," Draco said, still breathless, before doing as he was told. He watched in awe as ink slowly spread across the parchment, and opened it up to check out the contents. "Is this... Hogwarts?"
"Well, I'm thinking it has to do with emotions," Hermione started. Ron wouldn't meet his eyes, his face flushed. "As in each color represents a different emotion, but not necessarily each emotion you're feeling at each time of the day. I think Red means love, Pink means crush, and blue means you don't currently like anyone like that."
Ron's head seemed to pound and he sat back with a groan., maybe he should lay off the alcohol for the rest of the night.
"Yeah, saved me from a few detentions," Harry laughed, placing the map into the bedside table drawer and leaving the notebook on top of the piece of furniture. "I suppose we should probably get up if we want to go to Hogsmeade today."
"Fred and George gave it to me third year. They said they nicked it from filch's office. When you're finished with it you just say 'Mischief managed' and the ink disappears."
"Not really," Draco said, trying to put some excitement back in his voice, he felt disappointed that Harry had only been meaning to go with him alone because Hermione and Ron were busy.
Draco watched in amazement as ink suddenly appeared, spreading over the paper and forming the lines of the map. "It's a map of Hogwarts," Draco observed, "Wait are those-"
Harry noticed the uncomfortable look on Draco's face and tried to distract him, "Where would you like to go next?"
"What are you acting all smug about," Blaise said, elbowing her in the ribs, "you've never even dated someone."
When they made it into the room, Harry was immediately surrounded by glowing people and it seemed to just make his head hurt worse.
“And? I have more money than I’ll ever need or want from my dear mother,” Pansy said with a scoff, “Now try it on.” Draco moved to put it on and Pansy stopped him, “Oh! I nearly forgot, I got pants too,” she said moving to grab the dress pants from her closet as well. “Go try them on too,” Pansy said, ushering him out of the room.
"I got some fireworks to set off tonight at midnight," George whispered to Ron and Harry midway through lunch with a shit-eating grin, "They're still in the testing phase, so they should be pretty interesting."
Hermione looked at him in shock for a moment before finding her voice, "Thank you, I'm sorry too. I suppose we've all said some mean things." She shot him a smile that he returned.
"Would-" Draco started but then caught sight of Blaise and Neville at a table across the diner, holding hands across the table.
"Don't worry," Ginny laughed a little breathlessly, "I'm not here to crash your date, it'll just be a moment. I have something I need to tell you."
"Man!" Ron said, cutting through Hermione's thoughts, "I can't believe that the first match is in less than three weeks. It's all going by so fast. Heck, Halloween is Saturday."
"You two realize my class started over thirty minutes ago, yes?" Professor Slughorn asked, taking in their ruffled appearances.
"Yes you do. All the time actually," Draco laughed a bit and Harry was glad that Draco was laughing again. Harry paid for his candy and they left the shop, curious stares following them out.
They all turned to look at Luna, they'd never known that. She never really talked about the war or being at the Manor, hell no one really talked about the war.
"I heard something about a date and came as soon as I heard," Pansy declared, closing the door and making her way to Draco's bed. Promptly making herself at home.
"Well, I wasn't sure. I don't know..." Ginny trailed off. She knew deep down that Ron wouldn't care, but a part of her was still a bit worried. She felt a weight had been lifted off her shoulders though as Ron smiled at her.
Seamus caught Harry watching Draco and rolled his eyes. How obvious could they be, he thought. It was obvious what they had gotten up to the night before and Seamus wondered if Harry had forgotten they had a match today. From the looks of it, he had.
The twins put up a fabulous display before they left Hogwarts though, and eventually, Umbridge was left to the Centaurs and Dumbledore came back to the school and the twins left school for a business venture.
“Just Poppy really,” she said with a smile. Hermione frowned but Ron just shrugged, plopping down in a seat after Eddie moved a few books.
Alienation. Loneliness. Isolation. The things that brought them together. She looked back down at her plate. Small portions. She never could lose all the weight and it was still used against her, even if she was much slimmer now. She glanced again at her two friends guiltily. Harry was thin- always so thin, too thin. She never could eat enough. And Ron- she ate so so much, but she was tall and lanky. Ron
For a few moments there was ringing silence. It’d never been spoken before. She stared at him, perched on the bed still.
. We have so far deduced at least three items made into the Dark Lord’s horcruxes. This is to say that wherever he might be, the Dark Lord currently possesses only 12.5% of a soul. And that’s if he hasn’t made more than three which is a popular belief in our currently deployed research team. He is technically

nicer than he was before. He didn't call her freak anymore and sometimes gave her some of the chocolate Aunt Marge would get him. Then she glanced up, along with her cousin as Marge crept in the room, her wide eyes fearfully on the black haired girl. She'd lost a good deal of her weight since their death and her hospitalization- Poppy could see her jawline and her wrists now, and her sturdy build was more robust than simply being large. In her manicured hands she held a letter. She gently set it on the table before scurrying off. Poppy tilted her head to the side, petting Ripper on her lap. He was a good dog now that Marge wasn't ordering him to chase her. The other dogs she bred were also very well behaved- Aunt Marge certainly did know what she was doing in training and breeding, had a real knack for it. She stopped her petting and the bulldog looked up at her as she took the letter to see that it had an odd crest.
“Then why hadn’t anything been done in the last war?” one blustery, angry-faced man demanded and she turned her attention to him with a bland smile.
So instead of doing that, she sat out in the garden to start weeding. Petunia had been a little busy lately with other matters, like Dudley’s boxing practice and matches so it’s been a little bit neglected. From where she was in the kitchen cleaning, she knew her aunt was watching over her carefully. But she also knew if she looked over the woman would pretend she hadn’t and would send her a glare before walking off. Then she would return a few minutes later when she was sure Mimosa wasn’t looking anymore.
what I bake. Especially when it’s chocolate, though I do have a love affair with treacle tart as well.”
And here he was. The man who killed her parents. The man who lead a civil war and terrorized the magical and muggle community alike, spouting about blood and ideals and hate. Sitting next to her, wiping away her tears and holding her.
Marge had declined going with and had forbade Dudley so it was only Poppy and her guide. Professor Sinistra seemed a nice, competent woman though so Poppy was glad for that. Of course learning she was a witch and that her parents were witch and wizard were far more exciting. Marge had been eerily pale throughout the explanation but had hastily agreed to have her go when Sinistra began to explain the dangers of having her magic go untrained in the next few years. Even better, her parents had left a trust Vault for her and that she no doubt had more Vaults from her father's side.
“No, but…How about you avoid the dungeons, yeah? Save them for last since they’re so extensive.” Jasper told her nervously. He didn’t want her down there. She looked to him for a few moments, eyes watching him before she nodded complacently and he relaxed.
Evans was continuously proving herself to be invaluable. She seemed like a natural at magic, almost as much as Tom himself. She gained Slytherin just as many points as he did and for that, a good portion of their Housemates stopped calling them mudblood to their faces and trying to hex them. Not all of course, but a good amount. Tom had already decided that he didn’t want to just be a mudblood anymore. No, Tom had decided that he wanted to be the
“Who is she?” Osmond almost immediately interrupted and it was probably because she was already biased against them but Helle thought that was quite rude to interrupt like that. By the look on the older brother’s face, he thought so too.
‘Muggle weaponry?’ Narcissa thought distastefully. As if the muggles could harm them with their inferior so-called weapons she thought.
“Fire- it’s our Houses’s element.” Jasper answered automatically. He remembered his mother reading Hogwarts; A History to him as a bedtime story when he was younger and thus knew a whole bunch of weird tidbits. It was more than once used as teasing material.
Spoiled thing. She shook her head and directed her attention back to her gifts. The owl that had brought it was carrying back a gift for Nev and a thank you note to both, throwing in some chocolate frogs for Ron. The two girls were together at the moment, at Neville's home quietly celebrating alone. Opening the box from Neville, she smiled at the pretty necklace inside, with matching earrings. Platinum, she smiled as she read the little card. Remus was close to Sirius and Sirius was cautiously tentative with her. The few times she'd been able to see Sirius, Remus was close by. The note also said that it had a few of the charms they'd learnt from the Chamber. She let out a slight giggle, gently putting in the earrings. They sparkled with little gemstones in curious green and purplish-red that Nev had babbled about ‘zoisite and ruby’ and she adored it before slipping the necklace on. The cool metal clung close to her throat with little to no slack, a larger gem of the same sort gleaming in the mirror in her old beat up wardrobe. She turned to Midas with a grin.
There was a terrible feeling in her body but it was easy to push away as she sat on the stairs leading to their door. It was the house he’d bought for her, for them both.
“Where do you put it?” Neville asked suddenly. “Your food,” he clarified when she turned her head his way with those unnerving eyes.
“I am going to let you go Tom, on a warning. If someone dies in this school, I will not be afraid to take action to make sure no one else does.”
“I’ve dabbled, here and there.” she smiled up at him. He smiled back as though it were an instinctual response and Narcissa may have felt a trickle of fury at that. Everyone who was anyone seemed to be watching her and thus, her husband as well and so everyone would see how utterly,
“Just because we might like to read doesn’t automatically make us Ravenclaws.” Hermione chided, huffing. Ron’s lips twisted doubtfully but he shrugged and let it go. Not like they had a say in which House they went to anyways.
Besides, she thought to herself. She had already set up multiple recording devices around the Ministry, as had her scouting team. The recordings are swept through by the scouting team and sent back to the Confederation at the end of the week for anything duly concerning.
scars- the large starburst scar on her arm on both sides from the Basilisk fang in Second Year, the veins around it tinted dark and the damned mark on her forehead that gave her splitting headaches and horrible nightmares.
“So, what have we got today?” she asked their waiting friend who grinned at them, crooked and dimpled. It didn’t happen often enough in Ron’s opinion. It still sometimes rankled her, knowing her friend more or less lived down in this dark little hole in the ground but she was happier here than Ron ever remembered her being in her dorms and honestly, Ron couldn’t blame her. She couldn’t imagine living with those nasty girls in Slytherin.
“Yeah, Bill wanted to go through with it- had a penfriend there who sent him something nasty since mum and dad couldn’t afford it.” Ron sighed. “I didn’t think it could be that much different if they’re doing student exchanges though?”
“Oh! So will we! Be first years I mean.” she smiled widely and Poppy took note of the overbite. “Oh! Pardon me, this is Neville Longbottom.”

He should have signed the divorce paper years ago. Maybe it wasn’t made public? That flimsy excuse wasn’t working though. There was no way an Unspeakable’s Mediwixen would mistake something like that about their patients.
She’d been out in the muggle world, looking for interesting toys to entertain Teddy with when she got him in a few days. She had more or less joint custody of him with his grandmother; Harry couldn’t bear the thought of trying to take away her grandson after all she lost. She’d been out in the muggle world so had been more relaxed than she could have been, a little less wary than she would have been and whole
“It's nice to meet you, sir. I'm Poppy Potter.” she watched the way his dark eyes shot to her forehead, only for a second before he offered a shaky smile and his hand. She took it- his grip was of a confident man, yet the rest of his demeanor was not.
She was across the room, having disarmed and paralyzed him before he could finish the word. He fell, unable to move as she stepped over on deft feet.
“Not really sure, but his father’s on the Board of Governors- oh! Wait, you didn’t hear that from me!”
“And to see you look so fetching, Ms. Mulberry.” he returned, taking her hand to settle in the crook of his arm. “Might I introduce you to my wife?” he turned her towards the tall willowy woman. Whereas Ms. Mulberry was rather…Dainty and small in frame but with a respectable (if not distracting) amount of

After having had an absolutely smashing time at the bank (those carts were something else and she may have laughed all the way down in delight), they were getting her robes. Being sized for them, she was made to stand on a small dais. It was here that she had her first conversation with another to-be student. He spoke of 'their sort' in distaste, about bullying his father into getting him a broom even if there were rules against it and of proudly going to Slytherin as all his family had done before him. She eyed him curiously- this boy seemed awfully spoilt and reminded her of Dudley before the accident. But maybe that was just her imagination- still, she remained quiet for his tirade and didn't offer much in conversation though he seemed pleased enough to hear his own voice. His robes were finished before hers and he hopped down, looking at her directly for the first time.
“Well naturally.” Beryl preened, once more going back to playing with the cutie in her lap and letting the girl play with her rings.
“Lord help us.” Lucius said sympathetically. “You know, my Draco has discovered he likes brooms and flying. In the Manor.”
“Hear me out please? Just...Just look at them at least?” her green eyes looked from one to the other pleadingly. “You want to do something? We can do this. Just the three of us, knowing
Tom had seen and felt food insecurity before. That was the proper term for it, food insecurity. The way he knew she hid food, the way she inhaled her food so fast so there was no chance it could be taken away. It lingered in her long past Tom’s own memories of an orphanage burdened too much.
did as well. She could even say she was kind of accepting her upcoming death when Fawkes was crying onto her.
“Hullo.” Poppy waved and the boy offered a shy wave back. “Well I hope you find your toad.” and he nodded, tearful and tremulous again.
He may have also stationed snakes around Evans’s house to keep him updated until she finished packing and moved to her new place. But she was always secretive and maybe a bit paranoid.
“What are you so upset about? You yourself just killed me.” she pointed out, a hint of exasperation in her voice that he ignored entirely because she was
“I’m Tom Riddle. I’ll be in my first year and I assume you will too?” because she was small, smaller than him and smaller than even some of the nine year olds Tom knew at the orphanage.
“I see. Well I'm in Ravenclaw- Poppy here is a hopeful of my House, and these two are also aiming for Gryffindor.”
it boomed and the hat was politely taken off. There was sparse and grudging polite clapping from her new House and Tom watched with critical eyes the way they received her. She didn’t seem to much care, not about the looks she was getting or how other children moved away from her like she was diseased when she sat. Frankly, she didn’t seem to care about much and that…Unnerved Tom a little bit. Still, if she continued to prove useful he would keep her within sight. So when he was finally,
“You- you have contact with her?” he rasped, even as his eyes couldn’t leave the two tiny, defenseless things they brought to him.
I can't even remember when I first started this one. A while ago that's for sure. Ron and Nev are girls in this one too, Harry's a Slytherin and Nev's a Hufflepuff.
It was a novel feeling at first but one she’d gotten more than a little frustrated with. She was a naturally independent person and besides Ron and Hermione (sometimes even them), she didn’t like being clung to. She liked her alone time. And of course, soon his lackeys would circle around them, sending mean looks to anyone who so much as glanced over. She had to hand it to Dud, he really had his minions well trained and loyal.
Still, today she was feeling pretty okay, as compared to some of the last few weeks. Well enough to maybe go for a walk but she knew if she tried that Dudley would be hounding along with her and treating her like delicate china.
to send their children to yours…The sheer amount of injuries that occur on those grounds conditions students to accept horror as if getting your bones crushed is a weekly occurrence! Terrible! Also, why is there no language and reading classes? Or for Muggleborn or raised students, a supplementary class for penmanship since all anyone seems to use here is
Her hands and crawling up her arms was the slick blood of the beast and she cussed herself blue in the face as she pulled venom sacs closer. They were the size of beach balls and so dense and heavy that the twelve year-old almost dropped the slippery things. She set them down delicately, dumping potions over them to keep them from decaying. It was amazing that they hadn’t even begun the process and maybe it was because it was a Basilisk. The library was woefully void of much information on them and she didn’t want her order history questioned given the recent going-ons at school.
At least the mirrors weren’t charmed to talk. She dreaded to imagine how she looked. And sure, every so often they would use appropriate cleaning charms but she still felt greasy and sweaty through her drowsiness. She almost slipped going in but there was a small sitting area that she sunk down into, leaning against the cool tiles as water came on in a perfectly lukewarm temperature. While she typically preferred scorching hot and then switching to not-quite icy for a rinse off, for now she didn’t want to shock her system too much. There was a nondescript bar of soap she used and unlabeled vials of what she could only assume was some hair lotion substitute. She didn’t take particularly long, but longer than she would have liked for her limbs to cooperate.
Her breathing was regulated. Her body loose enough that if needed, she could spring into many different positions while making sure the children weren’t hurt, or at least not significantly. She
her would be a more apt description and he took every opportunity to remind her and the rest of her classmates of it. And while the depth of the dislike was different, he didn't much like Nev or Ron either. Nev had developed a sort of terror of the man and often botched potions up because she was so nervous and queasy, making him antagonize her even more in a vicious cycle. Ron wasn't particularly good with potions

“And what are you more used to?” Narcissa asked, perhaps a hint too sharply by the flash of amusement in the woman’s eyes.
she said with a strangely tilted smile. Enough to be unnerving. Not that Narcissa would show it. “I may talk a lot when given half a chance, but that doesn’t mean I’m willing to spill out my life story.”
She hated that she was dependent on him so much. That she saw him not as Lord Malfoy, Voldemort’s Death Eater lap dog but as Lucius and part of her was still hissing that it was a trick but she didn’t want to believe his seeming concern was. She still didn’t know why she was here. Why she was still alive. Maybe they realized she can’t quite manage to die properly and instead plan on having her isolated until she dies naturally? But Lucius would likely be gone by the time she were to die and who would keep her captive then?
“The Felid (Felidae, plural) in the muggle world simply means the general ‘cat’ species and all of its many members, including the big cats. In the more mystical side, Felid also refers to those that have a very specific bloodline that appears only when certain recessive genes are brought to the forefront. Being that the magical folk, at least the ones under the English Ministry alongside a few other, less developed areas tend to ignore entirely the science the non magical folk, mundanes, muggles or whatever else have you have achieved…The Felidae are usually confused for werecats, an entirely different species and labelled as incredibly dangerous or ‘Dark’, more so than the more popular werewolf.
Through the door, a hissed command and forcing her down the slide (he would need to find a way for stairs or some more dignified way but he was frankly too excited to have bothered fiddling with potential commands) before following and nearly knocking her to the ground after she’d gotten up.
. How, and in what ways he was not yet sure, but he was absolutely certain she was. The only reason he saw her now was that she had happened to be at the Minister’s secretary’s desk with the young man currently employed obviously struggling to keep his composure for some reason and looking on the verge of tears. Lucius had very kindly saw fit to lean into the discussion.
“She must get back into bed.” came the gentle words and the two didn’t detach but instead moved with her towards the cot.
brother Alec was barely out of nappies so he was functionally useless as a playmate alongside Theresa, Harold, Jason, Larry and Birdy. Cindy was a crybaby, Jimmy was
. His wand was in his hand before he knew it, the cruciatus on the tip of his tongue and partially spoken already when she moved.
Turning it over, she frowned at the green lettering. How did they know she slept in the third largest room? That was quite strange, almost worrying. Nevertheless, she tore it open to pull out...Some sort of stationary maybe? Certainly not paper at any rate. Ignoring that, she read the foreword before frowning a bit more and turning to the list of things she would need. She set the things down, wondering at it before shrugging and pushing them away to continue helping her curious cousin.
She would be asking someone, at some point, about all of that and if she could take some sort of legal action either way. Maybe if she gave an interview like she sometimes saw on the telly, then some of these wild speculations would die out. Or she could get some of the money they were making off of her name.
“You really don’t learn.” came the familiar voice and he tensed, whipping around to stare at the docile expression of the girl he’d known since eleven. “At this point, I suppose I should have known you wouldn’t. I don’t care about your muggle family if that’s what you think I’m talking about.”
Dressed in a scruffy too-big jumper and wearing muggle denim, ratty trainers peeking from them. Several eye-catchingly bright gems crawling up either of her ears and almost impassive faced. She had a nice face, he thought. Not like his mum’s but she looked a bit like Granny Dorea. Except for her colors and hair style.
“And do what, rehaul the entire Ministry?” an older man huffed, double chins quivering in outraged offense.
Harebell had included the other girl in her and Nev's meetings and she had insisted they call her Ron, just as Harebell had told them that she was just Harry. Her eyes flickered back to the professor. The class would be over soon and then they would be moving to double Potions. She wasn't looking forward to seeing her Head of House. Cringed at the very thought of it. The man didn't like her;
Self-loathing, prepared to lash at itself. That sort of magical instability was dangerous and while she refused to look at him, she forced the quiet message to have him examined properly to the Mediwizard. His head tilted forward slightly in compliance. She could question things if she needed to later.
She would need letters to her friends. To Teddy. She didn’t get to see him that often, despite being his godmother. Andromeda made clear what she thought of Primrose near her grandson, especially given her husband’s mother. She stared at the ring, the engraved words that she knew by heart. ‘Love Conquers All’ was simple, and it had well enough worked for them both.
“Hm…Well it has been quite a long time since she was here on home soil and I do encourage her to meet and befriend those of various backgrounds. Were this to happen, where do you think it should be held?”
Mum told her not to be so fussy and that it wasn’t becoming but Helle much preferred being with her or one of her aunties or the Wrights.
to enforce them! The society as a whole are in absolute shambles!” she went off again. Narcissa glanced at her husband to see how he was taking this sort of insult to their entire society but he was only watching Ms. Mulberry with entranced eyes. And in a public venue with his wife right in front of him no less! She glanced around. Oh, she just knew if Lady Greengrass or another member of the Black family saw there would be no end of gossip that would just ruin her social standing. She would be a laughingstock!
“He never bothered exploring down here- he saw the Basilisk and that was it.” she answered hurriedly. “Otherwise, trust me, I would be dead and he would be ruling over Europe.” she grinned morbidly. Her friends glanced at one another.
And the few times one of them managed to find her without one of her guards, she was quick to escape or otherwise manage to distract them and disappear.
“Of course, some things are still impossible but...Well maybe we should just read some of the things right? We might find something...Something we can use.”
sorted, he went and sat next to her. She didn’t acknowledge this and Tom listened to scornful whispers and ill-concealed hatred targeted at them and whomever else didn’t have ‘pure’ blood.
His handsome form was partially from absorbing soul pieces, and partially charms. His skin was still bone pale, and had patches of gleaming small scales and he did still have claws on hands and feet both and he was actually still ridiculously tall, like stretched taffy. And his eyes were completely, entirely red without the charms- no white to be seen at all. But he did have a full head of hair and eyebrows and eyelashes, and he did have a nose and a more human looking face outside of the red eyes and being bone pale and having scales. He had actual ears now instead of the too small malformed set he’d had out of the cauldron and she felt like it was an odd thing to focus on but frankly, being here at all was odd and better that she think of that than how she was trapped here under Voldemort who didn’t want to kill her.
Jasper and their mum were too busy focusing on Jasmine to notice the way James’ features tightened. Soon enough there was tea and Jasper relocated himself after a few moments of indecision when Jasmine had the paper because really, he wanted to see if she could really find any of the words. Their parents watched fondly and that’s how their first afternoon as a family panned out.
“Wh-what am I doing here?” she managed to choke out. There was something inherently wrong with handsome Tom Riddle sitting there calmly, not reptilian and pompous (and utterly mad) Voldemort glaring her down and spouting nonsense and long monologues where he spoke in third person sometimes to really up the ‘I’m above you and above all men’ feeling he wanted to make sure everyone was aware of. “Where are we?” her eyes flicked around the room, on anything other than the man looming next to her and watching her with an unblinking stare. If he was trying to unnerve her, he had already well accomplished that. She had thought- well, she had impression through the visions she had been suffering that Voldemort’s base of action was Malfoy Manor. And this…Was most certainly
But he had yet to harm her. Yet to spit anything insulting and had seen to most of her basic living needs.
“You could come with me.” she said and Tom paused. This was an unforeseen option. Tom eyed her, then Dumbledore before smiling charmingly. His handsome face (even if he was only eleven) never seemed to work on either of them. It still needed work of course, but he was only a first-year. He had plenty of time.
She could snap his neck in less than a second like this and her massive magical core swayed in unease.
“Probably trying to set up pranks.” she answered, another muttered spell making a small hand mirror float in front of her so she could make sure she’d gotten all of the blood off. “Weren’t you going somewhere Tom?”
She wouldn’t tell him that she would just explore it at night instead. She could just take a pepper-up or nap through the day.
“You’re biting.” she told him plainly and he released his lip with a wince. Pearl had taught her that, to interrupt when he started biting because if he chewed enough to bleed he’d move onto his nails. “Look at my new dress!” she stepped back to twirl. It was pretty- most all of the dresses Beryl helps her make or make for her are. She was dressed up today, in an effort to blend in with Edsel’s finely groomed appearance and Pearl’s unusually dressy look. She was, usually, wearing elf ear cuffs but Pearl had quietly suggested she not do that around Edsel’s cousins. Creature and beast blood were largely frowned upon. Oh, spread thinly through the Pureblood families but never outright spoken about or flaunted. Helle’s light yellow dress was lacy and the skirt fluttered around her knees, complimented by a matching lace ribbon hair band holding back a riot of glossy black ringlets. They were cut recently, and curled now wildly around her head in what might have originally been thought to be a bob but…Well, her hair really was pretty wild. The little bee earrings she wore were a cute touch. All in all, an adorable little girl.
“You have such a natural charisma, Tom, such natural leadership skills. And you chose genocide as your cause. Genocide and terrorism.” she sighed, crossing her arms. Tom was getting especially agitated at the way she was affecting him. “I’m not entirely surprised you let their bigotry seep into you. You’d always wanted to belong to something.”
crass) as was socially acceptable before straightening. She was no blushing maiden of course and she looked at him with a sort of amused spark in her eye.
She was still amazed that Fawkes had done that, still so grateful it made her want to rip her own heart out to give to the bird. She felt like that might counteract the whole thing though.
“Yes, she was close to the ah…” he trailed off, rubbing the back of his neck now sheepishly. With his blond hair and always kind gray eyes, Diggory had a sort of charisma that he wasn’t truly aware of. It was because of this charisma that he couldn’t understand what it was like being a normal teenage boy, hence his unpopularity with most of his male peers. That and girls called him things like ‘dreamy’, ‘dashing’ and ‘perfect’. Competition of the highest order.
“Hm…I’ll be sure to let the others know, don’t want our neighbors uncomfortable.” Beryl nodded to herself, idly stroking her prettily painted nails through Helle’s chaotic mass of glassy black ringlets. She had to be careful of how she did it, or her fingers would tangle. Beryl would swear the girl’s hair had a mind its own, half out of the French braid she’d put it in earlier. “If you’ve got the time, how about a cuppa? It’s about time for a break from wrangling the rabbits anyhow.”
, there are countless, tireless research files compiled into numerous works and they can be ordered just the same as the book of corruption. They aren’t popular
He was deft in removing the other enchanted items and even removing a few certain spells on the plush cot she was in (one could really tell it was a private institution) before he loomed over her with bright golden hazel eyes. The alarms finally stopped at least.
“The ritual will merge us with a parallel version of ourselves, combining our magical power and knowledge. But there is a…Very slim chance we’ll go mad from the mental strain and the physical strain of our bodies trying to accommodate an influx of new power.”
sentient than is considered legally a Being here. It also means we are not obliged to treat him humanely should we capture what is left of him.”
“The International Confederation?” Narcissa parroted, startled. This slip of a woman, with a sort of exuberance about her, was an ambassador for the International Confederation? The last few, as Narcissa recalled, had been sour, sullen people who didn’t care for their forms of etiquette nor their ‘conservative’ mindsets.
The reason she was told, was that because she had a piece of his soul, Voldemort could not kill her because one cannot kill
and no one noticed. Even after, nobody noticed anything different aside from her siblings asking where she'd been.
Instead it was that damnable diary that stole Marigold and the whispers in the walls led Mimoza to it. She fought a Basilisk (ran mostly), the Sorting Hat was dropped to her and she pulled out a silver sword embedded with rubies and promptly stuck it through the roof of the Basilisk’s mouth. In doing so, a fang had pierced right through her arm. The venom was quick to start acting but she made sure to stab that diary too, making sure that if
side effect.” she looked at them sharply. “The only downside is that it would take a few days to complete, which is fine if we do it during the hols.” she argued.
Not all of the spells were Dark- Slytherin was a well versed man at least, even if he was a supremacist bastard. And they might have been brewing like crazy down in the Chamber- they would need some of these potions. Mostly- Harry has been brewing because she was the best at it and the Halfblood Prince's hints from the book made her make connections in her mind that helped make sense of why he changed the formula. She wouldn't say she was a genius at it or anything but she certainly knew her stuff. For fear of her Head of House mostly, but still.
“Mummy,” came the muffled, teary whimper and her body tensed up. She’d had young children call her that before (or the equivalent); she supposed something about her seemed to radiate a matronly feeling to them. She forced herself to calm down and do what she would any crying whimpering child that clung to her and gently stroked through soft curls.
“Widely accepted. You mean an entire population honestly believes a babe who was still messing herself in nappies managed to defeat some sort of genocidal tyrant?”
I think I'm gonna actually name chapters now. And I was thinking of adding some of the other older files too. So again, I might pick these back up sometime but as of now, anyone who wants to try their hands with one of these has my blessing all the way, go wild.
“She had recovered since.” her lips were pursed as she pulled out an envelope to him. He snatched it from her hands, greedy eyes unblinking as they took in her writing. He didn’t bother trying to actually read it for a moment; just to look at it. But he did, of course, read it. It was…It wasn’t cold, but it was clinical. Distant on purpose. It said bluntly that where she was, was far too dangerous and her mission too consuming for her to take care of them. And that she, bluntly, didn’t want to look at them.
“Still.” she answered easily and he looked about. The house hadn’t changed much in the years, though a few photos from school managed to find their way into the kitchen. A few of him (surrounded and with his usual perfect smile and carefully groomed appearance), and a few of her. Some girl in another house had taken to her, some mudblood who’d decided Evans made a wonderful model. One of her standing out by the lake with her braid flying with her usual solemn expression. One of her sitting in the Great Hall, fork halfway to her mouth from an overfull plate, him beside her and glaring in the direction of that damnable mudblood. Another of her at Astronomy Tower with only a dim lumos lighting her.
“Yeah.” Ron muttered. Her mood without them had taken a dark and terrible turn and she often secluded herself in her bed, curtains spelled shut as she played chess by herself. Alone and brooding, and she avoided her siblings like the plague. When she had gone home, she was just one in many freckled children and it being so festive and busy, it was easy to slip away to her room. Not like she was really
Vernon grunted and heavily patted her shoulder, eyes a bit misty. She never thought she’d see the day when the Dursleys were upset about her leaving. Petunia kept herself rigid and still. Dudley sniffled and let go and she waved, a little awkwardly before turning and following Dumbledore, a little bit wobbly.
Conflict resolution? No, we have magic, why learn that! Argh, it’s so frustrating! Even the current Headmaster has tried to address some of the issues but he’s not solely in charge of what they can and can’t teach, everything has to go through a faulty board of governors who, very likely, have no formal training or education
“What do you know of me besides that I am a Confederation employee, that I have custody of my niece and that I like chocolate, dancing, and treacle tart? Besides my views on your Ministry and Hogwarts? I may be willing to share bits and pieces but I can certainly assure you, I’ve never been accused as being an
The majority of the year was easygoing besides this revelation, and both he and Evans stayed in the castle for hols. When asked, Tom found out that she was an orphan as well. It was only when the year began to close out that the general euphoria of magic was destroyed.
“How does that not faze you in the slightest?” Lavender asked, still staring somewhat unwillingly at the small girl demolishing whatever food was set in front of her. She’d never seen anyone eat like that besides Ron and even he wasn’t as…Savage.
“They are talking of moving to another safehouse.” he said after some time. She startled, shifting a little where she lay and waking Rusty who’d taken to sleeping and napping lazily on her legs. “Should that happen, we would no longer have our midday excursions and you would be confined to our room for at least another two months after the initial move. Your arms would be bound again.” his leg was bouncing now.
“Aunt Marge,” she called and the woman jumped. Before, Poppy remembered her as a large beefy woman- loud and mean and violent. After her brother's death she had lost weight, her graying hair had gotten more so and her mustache had disappeared. She took better care of herself now though and she'd more than once heard the woman mutter about keeping strong and healthy for Dudders.
“No, no. It’s fine.” she insisted. She had really beautiful hair, and the hair clip at the back with its fanciful woven metal was an anniversary gift last year. She held out her hands for Helle and the girl took them dutifully. “Alright Helle. We are the current ambassadors for muggleborns and how to behave around muggles for the next week. We may even have to help them pick their clothes to make sure they don’t wear something bizarre.” Pearl said seriously, eliciting a giggle.
“Yes, it’s quite ticklish isn’t it? I myself am not very fond of being tickled. Very uncomfortable, that. You’ll be asleep soon though, don’t worry. And all will be well when you wake.”
“Well of course I do. I’d even say I have a particular fondness for baking but that’s also because I love
“They can only be seen if someone has seen and accepted death. Animals can see them just fine and so can most other creatures, but people need to see death of another person and accept it.” his sister explained easily and he shuddered.
Not that devoted apparently, she thought as she glanced down at the ring still on her finger. He entertained the ‘muggle foolishness’ for her, taking rings. She should have known, she really should have known better. She had hoped that-
No, don’t think about that she chided herself. She didn’t know how long it would take to get all of the venom out, so left it with the highly charmed and reinforced bucket she
charmed he was by this harlot! She pursed her lips and kept cool. “It’s certainly a nice, fun relief for pent up energy at least.”
“Lockhart was a total quack, useless as boots with no sole.” she pointed out. He’d ran off their second year, then managed to convince his lovestruck fans that he’d been called to help some other country disperse of a nundu problem they were having, even though nothing of the sort was happening. “I really don’t think he even had a teaching license.”
“There are,” Lily told her quickly. “But I don’t think…” she trailed off. He looked between his sister and their parents curiously. He liked care of magical creatures and all, but he wasn’t that into it.
“I don't want to potentially lose my sight or my hearing for a bit more power.” she told her, “I think the spell is safer.”
“Correct.” he grinned, “She’s only competing because she’ll lose her magic, and she’s under the approved age limit as well. And she isn’t a student,” he said the last bit like a second thought. “Don’t look so worried! There are plenty of new rules in place to make sure no one will end up dying.” and Jasper practically heard the ‘probably’ he left hanging.
people who will shower you in praise and wonder one moment and in the next, vilify you over things you cannot control, things that never should have been foisted on your shoulders and a life that you never asked for as the famous Girl-Who-Lived.”
She shook her head weakly and watched him paw more out of the air to destroy in vague, drowsy interest. It was sort of like when Crookshanks would paw at the little birds Hermione would conjure up for him in their dorm. Soon there were angry bangs at the door and she turned her head lazily.
again anyways. Lucius hissed derogatives under his breath. Not at her as he stroked over her face gently, through her hair and down her back as he held her in a loose but notably protective hug.
She had thought after winning the war that things like this wouldn’t happen to her anymore. That the left over Death Eaters would have been properly wrangled and thrown in Azkaban or sentenced to the Kiss. She was wrong.
“How kind of you.” her smile became a bit more fetching rather than polite. “Unfortunately, it seems
“Mr. Bodhi is a Confederation-approved butler and competent caretaker when I am not there to oversee my niece.”
But the furniture here was light colored and unmistakably feminine. The entire room was done in light blues and shades of soft white with a few bits gray here and there.
“There there, poppet. The Ministry, the adults meant to supervise and protect the children under their guidance at Hogwarts, the zealots that insist that muggles are harmless and won’t listen to a word otherwise, the ones who looked at you, who saw you and saw that you were not well but ignored it…You don’t have to worry about any of that now.” Tom cooed, rubbing her arms soothingly. “You are
“Horcruxes. A dark ritual.” he purred. “A little death to fracture the soul and then voila! The fractured part becomes an anchor to the living plane.”
Later in the day, after giving the many bulldogs their scrubbing and food she went to find Marge. In the large countryside home it wasn't hard to find her- she was staring from a sunroom longingly over to Mr. Fulbuster's house.
“Says the one who’ll hop into any boy’s bed.” Nott muttered under his breath, eliciting a few laughs.
More importantly, Harry found herself absolutely fascinated by the Halfblood Prince and wondering idly who he was. Well it didn't much matter, he'd probably long since graduated. DADA wasn't as awful as she'd feared and he thankfully seemed to ignore her for the most part, focusing most of his vitriol on the Gryffindors. It didn't mean he still didn't treat her as an absolute waste of human skin.
She breathed in slowly, reveling in the crisp air. And then was distracted because a huge fluff of a cat was rubbing against her bare leg and meowing at her. She wished her arms were free to pick up this behemoth or to pet him and her shoulders twitched. Lucius stooped to pick him up instead, holding the large thing against a broad chest and likely getting fur embedded in his ironed shirt.
She hadn’t realized that she had been defensively curled around the two children. She’d always been softer with children, once she was sure they actually
Perhaps twenty minutes later, they were in a tower not particularly used. Well Jasper always knew how huge the school was. Eventually they stopped near an alcove with a statue of a tall man with a strange looking snake on his shoulders that had two heads- one on both ends.
And he might have let her cry on him and all, but that didn’t change that he’d been trying to kill her for years or that he started a war or that he killed her parents and countless others, and commanded a bunch of terrorists that tortured people and murdered and had raids. She was sure that he thought enough time spent together would change her opinion on him, along with a tale about how unstable he had gotten after splitting his soul numerous times and how that wouldn’t happen again. She had her doubts. A
“Lively events, I’d say. Again, I had come from a gala held by the Swedish counterpart to your Ministry and oh, the fun to be had there! Viking reenactments, fashion displays on gorgeous dancing entertainers, an insane amount of alcohol, the incredibly modern and sometimes muggle-inspired music, oh and a full scale model of the muggle ice hotel with magical touches of course! That was something to behold, let me tell you!” she laughed in delight. “It was also much more colorful than all this! Their own primary government building was practically a work of art itself! Sleek, colorful, but also decidedly tasteful. Works of art
And it was…Sort of nice. That they were a little concerned about her health. Had even offered to take her to a ‘normal’ doctor. She still didn’t really think of them as family, even if her aunt and uncle were her parent like figures through childhood and Dudley was practically her brother. These people raised her from nappies, even if they didn’t do it well.
She avoided people that year, spending as much time as she could alone after she had happened upon a Dementor near her. She just felt lucky it left her alone after she passed out, and that
The second was the elegant robes and tasteful accessories she wore and her quietly, almost subtly proud stance. It was one he’d seen senior Aurors take, less rigid than the new sorts, smoother. He noticed these things with a keen eye, because this woman exuded something that made him feel…Well. Lucius had heard the quiet murmurs that the men of his line tended to be weak for power and this woman was…
“Helle is with us about four times a week for what lessons we can provide, but she lives next door so to speak, so she’s often over more than that.” Pearl took up, staring Osmond down. He seemed to shrink under her cold stare, which Helle quite liked.
“Albania, you say? I do remember Lord Yaxley saying something about the people he’d been meeting there had been incredibly disrespectful to his wife.” Lucius said thoughtfully.
if she wasn't going to get something out of it besides trauma and a scar. When she heard Ron's usual whoops as they slid down she stuffed the large round vials into a bag after corking them. She’d probably give some of the money she’d make to Ron too of course. Then she was wandering out to meet the two. Ron was brushing herself off with a grin.
Drastic measures. Drastic measures. Ah, that’s right. He still needed to get rid of the Ravenclaw mudblood who kept taking pictures of Evans.
She glanced covertly at Ron- she sat near her fellow housemates at least, though she wasn't really included. Harebell had met her on the train in First Year, but they hadn't become friends until her Second Year when she'd been possessed and dragged down to the Chamber of Secrets while people were petrified. Harry had gone down to the Chamber, following the voices in the wall. The two of them almost died down there, and they told no one but Nev about it. Not even the Headmaster but he already knew when he awarded more points to Slytherin, granting them the flag again that year and the very vague letters he sent to them.
we're living, because living implies doing more than just surviving and hoping the next day might be a little better as we hunch over hoping no one decides to make us a target today! That's not
Such was how he spent the rest of his day, sitting listlessly on a chaise lounge and staring at his perfectly calm and complacent sister.
; now the office was filled with Ministry officials, agitated foreign schoolheads and more students. The Headmaster was lucky none of his baubles had been knocked over at this point.
“Only those who aren’t affiliated with us. I’m not surprised a rumor like that started around here though. Any excuse to remain cut off and ignorant of the outside world.” she snorted. “Would you be interested in holding their playdate at my place then? There are plenty of activities provided for the families that stay in the offered lodgings if perhaps, a walk around would be an option then.”
“Still?” he asked and she nodded shortly. Despite having known eachother since eleven and being for the most part of those few short years inseparable, Tom didn’t know her birthday. He didn’t particularly care about it either, since the thought comes and passes only faintly, a brief acknowledgement.
“Money.” she answered as though that were the only answer applicable and he found himself once more annoyed with her curtness.
Harry was plagued with horrible nightmares for the next few weeks, until she began to really practice some of the Occlumency tips from Slytherin's books. The harder she studied and learned, the less she suffered the strange visions. She began to spend her nights in the Chamber, scouring the books until the wee mornings and simply telling Dobby to secretly put awakening potion in her morning drink, then something else after there were concerns about the side effects that would pop up when used too much. She was going in a frenzy in her days, caring less and less about her peers and her professors. Ron was sucked into it too when Harry lent her the Invisibility Cloak and then Nev joined them. More and more, the girls would disappear for hours on end, not just in the deep cover of night but any free time they had. Harry went entirely unquestioned.
