The second Harry steps free of the Apparition point, he’s hit by the overwhelming scent of dust and heat. Too busy trying to orient himself, he almost misses the Welcome Witch leaning back against the corrugated iron fence, a ripped flannel shirt knotted around her waist and a tie-dye shirt on top. She holds out a pamphlet to him, chewing loudly on a wad of bubble gum and not bothering to make eye contact with him even when he takes the pamphlet from her hand.
This time, when Malfoy waited for him at the doors, Harry walked over deliberately.
“Everybody knows you support the Nundus since they signed Hedley. Come on: we’re already late for breakfast. Trust you to sleep through the start of our seminars,” Malfoy muttered at last. He gave Harry one last look and finally stepped away from the bed. Harry sank back down onto his pillows and blew out a long breath.
I was—” he hesitated. “Moved, I suppose. A little betrayed, sure, but mostly touched and horrified that you had to go through that and—” he broke off and turned sharply to Potter. “You are
He’d thought he’d won the exchange, except Potter sent back:
“It is if it’s prophesied,” Potter smiled grimly.
The words echoed in the empty room, surrounding Draco and filling him with a sense of inevitability.
“I have the figures,” Draco tucked the book back into his shirt pocket and patted it carefully. “So, I can start the map now.”
A shuffle of feet behind him made him turn, unsurprised to see Malfoy appear at his side, leaning against the balcony with him. The sleeve of Malfoy’s velvet dressing gown brushed against Harry’s wrist, and neither of them pulled away.
Draco nodded, his throat swelling with an unnamed emotion. He took a breath, closing his eyes for a second to regain control.
“It will change in a second,” George said, and before Draco could ask what he meant the curtains fluttered and the room turned to stone.
He turned and met Potter’s gaze. “Even if we do ignite rumors that we’re fucking—” Potter’s eyes darkened, “—that’s not what will win us the bet. Hate sex is hardly a mature relationship, and Pansy would never pay out on that.”
“Hey,” Harry said as he sat down across from Neville upon reaching their table. Ron, to his left, was spooning the last of the scrambled eggs onto his plate while Hermione immediately started chatting to someone Harry’d never seen before. What he’d just said to Malfoy was still buzzing through his head, and in an effort to distract himself from freaking out at the prospect of having suggested friendship to
Draco noticed the hourglass had come to rest on the table between them, its last single grain falling lower and lower.
He bit back a groan. “Which is precisely why it
“I don’t often see you on this floor!”
“Go slow. You wouldn’t want to get too carried away and end it before we even begin, would you? Since this is new.”
He felt Malfoy’s hand making small circles across his hip bone, and without meaning to, he moaned. He’d never before wanted anything as badly as he wanted Malfoy’s hand on his cock right now.
Wordlessly they fell into step beside each other, joining the rest of the people who were going for walks or runs around the lake. The little ducklings waddled along the path in front of them, and the two of them slowed down until their pace was more of an amble, allowing the ducks to race around their feet. Even in the chill of autumn, the sun was warm against their necks. It made Draco realise that he couldn’t recall a time from their recent relationship when he could actually remember the world around them. He’d been so utterly absorbed in the slow, downward pull of it all that he’d let himself get lost along the way.
It held the same words as the other two had, but they meant something different to Draco that night. For the first time in weeks, he began to feel hope.
He could lie, he supposed. But what was the point? Draco was already trapped in some kind of prophecy with Potter. He may as well explain about everything else Fate was handing out.
The foyer was empty when he arrived, the marble pillars looming around him and making him feel strangely lonely. The lights weren’t even on. He’d just found a corner to wait in when a noise from the entrance made him turn. Potter stood there, illuminated by the soft light of the setting sun behind him. There was something off about his expression, but Draco couldn’t see it well enough to figure out what it was.
he demanded with all the grace that implied that if Harry’s answer was anything other than a swift “no”, there was going to be trouble.
It was the smell of Fiendfyre, hot and burning.
What might the choices of a prophecy-child and a creature of fate amount to when they were finally allowed to make them?
The practice came to an end, and the sea of kids came rushing back to their parents, all talking over each other at once. Draco waited at the side while Harry collected the piles of brooms and shrunk the Quidditch hoops back into the ground, lest any Muggle break through the privacy shield around the oval.
I know something about cages, too; my father liked to keep me in one. I can only recall one time where I ever escaped. I ran from our inner-city apartment all the way to the steps of the big cube at La Défense and watched the sun rise. I think it was the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen in my life. If sitting in that window with Pattenrond was what Heaven feels like, watching the sun rise that morning was what it felt to truly be alive.
“No,” Malfoy snapped, running a hand through his hair and clenching.
Blaise’s brows had drawn together in confusion, but he didn’t interrupt. Draco tried to distract himself by staring at the ornate ceiling of Blaise’s second drawing room, but even the gold-flecked paint on the architraves made him think of Potter—Gryffindor gold. More importantly, it made him think of how Potter used to be, and how much that wasn’t the man he was now.
Love, Harry
“I think you have visitors,” he said conversationally.
stream of noise around them, all while never turning his attention away from their little group.
Draco frowned. He was trying to put together the pieces, but he was certain he didn’t have them all yet. All he knew was that Potter had been different when he was with Draco, when they were playing this ridiculous game. He’d been more like the Potter that Draco remembered seeing across the Great Hall at lunch time, laughing with his friends. It wasn’t until now that Draco realised how long it had been since he’d seen that person at all.
Some of the spark returned to Potter’s eyes, and Draco felt a weight lift away from his chest.
“Potter, listen to me carefully,” Malfoy said, his voice level and yet strangely urgent. “I wasn’t sure earlier, but now I’m certain. It’s
Potter moved in a slow circle, examining the walls closely. “And we’re not going to remember any of this once we wake up?” he breathed, unmistakably awed despite the roughness to his tone.
Harry, who didn’t have to imagine quite so much as his friends, stayed quiet and played with what was left of his mushy peas.
of giving me up.”
Draco took him in, relishing the taste of sweat and arousal and clean man that filled his mouth. Above him, Harry’s breath came in rough pants, interspersed with Draco’s name in a tone of voice that made him feel like a god.
“I know,” Potter said softly. “I walked in your dreams—this is it, isn’t it?”
Draco made a vaguely committal noise and ate some more of his soup. Potter was right; it wasn’t fair. But when was anything fair?
An owl hooted, startling Harry out of his languor. Night air washed over him from the open window as he reached out and took the letter it offered from the bedside table.
Knowing that it would alert the curse to their presence, he gingerly tapped the smallest cog and waited. For a split second, everything stopped moving, like a sleeping animal hitching its breath, and then it started again, and Draco let out the breath he had been holding for several minutes.
He realised it wasn’t his own breath he was hearing. Slowly, with care, he rose to his feet and crossed the room to the doorway to ease the door open. The sobs were louder out here. He listened to Malfoy cry for several minutes, wondering what he should be doing about it since Malfoy would absolutely not want Harry to know.
And now that he’s here, in Alice Springs, he finds himself meandering towards the coast, Apparition point by Apparition point, drawn to the call of the sea. Giant jellyfish be damned. He wants to catch a wave, to chill out in a beer garden by the beach, to sunbake on white sands—not this red outback dust that seems to seep into every orifice with a determination bordering on sentience. He wants to see what passes for a bustling city in Australia, and he’s fairly certain he won’t found that out here.
“You are aware that until I can break the curse, we won’t remember anything that happens inside the dream-state?” he asked. “We have to work in complete isolation—nothing new goes in, nothing comes out, not until it’s over. It’s part of the process of confusing the curse and making sure it doesn’t get suspicious and attack.” He took another deep breath, feeling his sanity leaving him the longer he spoke. “It means we have to trust each other completely, Potter, because once we’re inside, there’s no one to help us but ourselves.”
He realised Malfoy was talking to him, and looked over to see he was gesturing to a sunny spot by the fountain.
Finally, they fell apart and Draco dropped down on the bed while Potter leaned over to grab a handful of tissues and spit into them.
(Of course you should go. Childhood leaves a mark on us all in the most personal of ways—if someone shares that with you, it is an honour.)
Potter hunched over, staring down at his feet. “Well, it’s obvious isn’t it? Seventh year. It’s when I took your wand.”
“Were you having trouble focusing today, Harry?” Hermione asked, concerned, when he’d sat down at dinner. “I saw your parchment was blank for most of that session on bimodal seedpods.”
Icy fingers wrapped around Draco’s heart. Of course—the bet.
Potter nodded, and then directed Draco how to hold the Quaffle to get the right angle, and suddenly they were passing it back and forth without the anger.
“Lovely. Thanks for the update.”
“They’re allowed to hug you now,” Malfoy pointed out, like a sunrise, like a clock sounding one minute past midnight. His voice was softer than Harry imagined it could be, usually all shrill and sharp edges. “But for what it’s worth, I’m sorry your Muggles were the kind my parents justified their existence with.” The words were halting and awkward, an apology for more than one thing.
Harry loves the familiarity. He loves the way their two bodies press together in the same patterns, the same routines, while every breath is simultaneously new and undiscovered. It’s exhilarating.
He tuned slowly back in to the sound of Potter’s voice, realising that he was still talking, droning on and on in an increasingly desperate sort of way.
It was like a bucket of ice water had been poured over Draco’s head, shattering the moment. He forced himself to pay attention again.
“You can fuck my mouth if you like,” Malfoy said, like that was in any way a thing the two of them said to each other, and then he slid down onto Harry’s cock once more.
“I have been the pillar of polite conversation, considering our circumstances.” Draco was affronted.
Malfoy curled into him like a child. “She’s my only friend, Potter,” he mumbled into Harry’s collarbone.
Draco’s eyes widened. “I thought they’d stopped!” he said, unable to keep the hint of glee from his expression as he hurried over to stand beside Harry. “I thought they must have triggered the spell while I was in France and then given up.”
The upturned crate that served as a coffee table was going to go—Draco was going to burn it. He was going to burn it and dance around it and laugh. Then he was going to eviscerate the moth-eaten curtains into tiny shreds. And after that, he was going to throw every piece of transfigured furniture into a huge pile in the middle of the road and hail the Knight Bus to run over it.
It would take him less than three hours to pack up everything he owned here in France and return to England. Less than three hours to turn everything around and take that first, terrifying step into the unknown—acknowledging that there was something there between him and Potter. Acknowledging that it was worth pursuing. Knowing that their individual sanities and health were just as important.
“You don’t want to have sex?” he asked, looking back at Malfoy’s face.
“You have no idea.”
Draco snorted at the realisation of how little Potter understood his father’s distaste for impure blood. “Not quite.”
“I know you have trust issues,” Blaise said drily, “what with having a wretched upbringing and all, but has it ever occurred to you that,
“Of course.” Potter’s easy acquiescence was disturbing. “Any ideas so far what kind of curse it is?”
“I suppose,” he said quietly, “that I can learn to live with that.”
“Yes,” he said, the word simple and honest.
Draco turned back to his notes. He didn’t have the package in the room with them, of course. It was out the back in his work room under a number of security spells. At this point, he hadn’t even opened it; he was too caught up on the bizarre results of his diagnostics.
In the past, Eleanor had worked with him to process the parts of his past that haunted him, but whenever he’d tried to he’d ended up wound tighter and tighter, unable to feel anything except the urgency to
He realised that he had never asked that question before.
Did you try the eclairs? I distinctly remember the first time I ate one. It was rich and slightly melted, and the tabby cat was stretched out beside me in a sunbeam so warm and cozy I felt like that moment must be what Heaven felt like. An eternity filled with morning sunshine, cats, and eclairs.
There was no response.
Professor Staltwort interrupted them, now that everyone had their parchments and a partner or two. “Find somewhere in the sun! It’s a lovely day, we should enjoy it. First ones back who can recite all their partner’s answers without looking get a prize!”
“Yeah.”
And whether he ended up with Potter’s love or not, Draco was learning to love himself. Whatever else happened, that was enough.
“That wasn’t me,” Potter said in an odd voice. “That was the version of me you conjured in your head. I was… floating around. I work with dreamscapes, Malfoy. Of course I can recognise one and remember it.” He cast him a sideways glance. “When were you going to tell me you were the Veela?”
“It’s just, if everything’s not alright,” Ron soldiered on, and Harry started to feel real panic about the existence of that sign. “We can talk about it.” He lowered his voice. “We don’t even have to tell Hermione—I know how she can get. I won’t give you advice. You can just… you can tell me whatever it is, and then I’ll keep my mouth shut and pretend I didn’t hear anything. You know. If you want.”
“Please, faster. Just like that. God, Draco, just like that.”
“We’ve got a few new faces today,” Harry said, smiling down at them all. “So we might start back at the basics. Who here has ridden a kid’s broom before?”
And perhaps Potter could take him, too.
“What?”
“No!” Granger insisted, while Weasley glared at him. “Aren’t you listening? We gave him space. He knew we were there for him if he needed us, but whatever he was going through, he needed time to work it out on his own. He’s better now.”
“Are you sure
Kalen cleared his throat, looked at his feet, and then forced himself to look up and meet George’s eye.
Almost none of this made sense to Draco, on any level, but he soldiered on.
“She seems a bit nervous,” he said lightly. “She’s never used a kid’s broom?”
“It worked excellently,” Draco admitted. “They are convinced we’ve had a truly dreadful fight—our worst since Hogwarts—and that I’ve come chasing after you to soothe your poor, bruised ego.”
You giant, insufferable twat. Luna tells me you’re going to bribe Draco Malfoy into letting you stay and follow him around France. Firstly—ew. Secondly, do you really, truly think that Luna—
When they remained unfrozen after a few minutes, Harry concluded they were safe. For now. It could still lie dormant.
“Well…” All amusement faded so abruptly Draco had whiplash. “You’ve changed the future before. Don’t forget, Harry—you still don’t know what you’re dealing with. Veela are creatures of fate.” His voice was loaded with so much meaning, every cell in Draco’s body vibrated with the need to decode the mystery before it leaped out of the shadows to bite him.
They stared at one another. Malfoy’s face was open and honest. Harry had no idea what his own face was doing.
He trailed off into mutterings; Harry thought he caught the word ‘noose’.
“It is big,” he agreed, trying to convey some measure of his emotions into those three small words.
Something catches his eye, and he focuses on a movement he hadn’t noticed before. It takes him a second to recognise it, but when his mind finally registers the sight of Malfoy’s hand inside his designer trousers, whipping furiously over his own cock, he finally spills over the edge, gripping Malfoy’s hair tightly and gasping for breath.
“This is hell,” he complained. “This is hell and I don’t even know what I’m missing.”
to be tried out by enthusiastic children. It would have been an insult to the donation if I hadn’t brought them out just in time for Christmas shopping.”
Potter gave a weak laugh. “How likely is it, do you think, that we might be as willing to actually listen to each other out there as we were in here?”
He hears a faint snicker behind him, but he doesn’t turn around. Somehow, he knows the expression Malfoy will be wearing without having to see it. It will be soft and warm, gentle in the fading light of the evening. He will look at Harry with cautious hope, now that the first of the barriers between them are broken down and they can begin to be open with one another. It will be everything that Harry always wanted.
At that, Draco laughed, the sound bubbling up from somewhere deep inside him with a hint of hysteria. “Potter, we could never be casual.”
“Your classmates will ask you about the Manor when you return, Draco,” his father said, struggling to maintain the authoritative drone that had used to define him. “You will tell them nothing.”
He hears whimpering, and he forces himself to open his eyes and look down. Malfoy’s eyes are fixed on him, glazed and dark, and his cheeks are ruddy with exertion. His hand is slightly obscured by the folds of his shirt, so he almost looks decent—a model-like vision of decorum but for the way his hair knots where Harry has tangled it and his red, swollen lips.
“You mean…” Potter said slowly.
“The cabinet,” Potter said softly, and suddenly, terribly, it all made sense.
a tosser,” he’d corrected her. “Just not for the reasons everyone thinks.”
He licked his lips, thinking fast.
“You’re a fucking idiot. You know that, right?”
Their eyes met, and Draco felt his face drain of colour at the expression he saw there.
“We keep coming back to each other,” Potter went on. “Keep
“You still made the choices,” Draco said slowly. “Fate offered them, but you made them. Even now, you changed the prophecy. You opened the curse.” His words came out almost reverent. “It might have been a dream, but you made the choice.”
“And you think that’s changed?”
Draco was hard-pressed to deny the owner of such a welcoming smile, even if she wasn’t exactly his type and was remarkably more demonstrative than he was used to in acquaintances. Ignoring his usual voice of restraint and warning, he nodded, ordered a glass of wine from Tom at the bar, and sat down.
Blaise regarded him with kind eyes. Draco had been sitting on the floor of Blaise’s ballroom, knees hugged to his chest, for thirty-seven minutes without speaking—a personal best—and while Blaise had been nothing but understanding, Draco suspected they were reaching their limit.
“Are you sure about that?” Potter’s eyes flashed—again with that curious mix of pain and anger. “Because you went through the plan so many times, I felt like an actual child by the end.”
“I’m happy,” he agreed.
someone. Always try to come up next to them. We’ll have a few accidents—we always do—but that’s all right because what are we doing?”
“Well, why don’t I feel any different, then?” Potter asked, sounding so genuinely lost Draco nearly opened his eyes.
“Yes—Pansy what are you doing? And how do you know all this anyway? I’ve hardly told you anything about it.”
“Absolutely not, you complete pillock. We need access to your stupid archives in case this thing is worse than we thought. If you go and die on us, I’ll have to put in an application, and then you’ll be wasting my time even in death—I don’t think I could stand the gall.”
The thought of taking Potter in his mouth made him weak, but at least he would feel as though he had some measure of control over the situation again. At least when it was Potter writhing like this, Draco could feel like he wasn’t losing it.
“Did you see the squid slippers?” The young girl burst out, lowering her voice quickly as the door closed and muffled the sound of the bustling alley. “They puff out black smoke so no one can see you if you need to run away quickly!”
thing; it’s just a fact.”
With his head tipped back, still grasping the headboard, Potter moaned. He was making a clear effort to stay still, to keep from thrusting his cock up to meet Draco’s mouth; Draco smirked and wondered how long he’d remain still when he realised what Draco actually had planned.
“Yeah.” Potter grinned, finally turning to him and sliding his fingers into Draco’s. “I thought it would make a nice first date.”
“Half-fae!” Morgan snapped, though her eyes had taken on an expression of fear. “How did you—?”
“What happened?” he asked, and then Kalen shifted awkwardly and George’s eyes were drawn to the fifth person in the room.
He tried to keep the edge of anger out of his voice. It was strange… This was the first time he’d felt anything beyond the fog in months. Out of the corner of his eye, he thought he saw something flicker along the balcony, above the instruments. But when he turned, there was nothing there.
“When I fuck people, I lose them,” he continued. “I’m selfish. I get bored. I don’t want to do that with you.” He paused. “I want this to mean something, Harry.”
“Alright.” He turned to Malfoy, who looked a little pale. “Is that okay?”
When they finished, they were covered from head to toe in sweat and earth, and Draco could feel the magic beneath the grave rise up and caress them, generations of wizards and something familiar but rare—perhaps selkies—gifting their magic to the elf and to the two wizards who had buried him. Potter looked at him, his eyes red and his skin puffy from the exertion and the tears that still hadn’t quite stopped.
They slide together, the room filling with the sound of their soft moans. It always starts the same: they try to stay quiet, years of dormitory life leaving a lasting impression, before their surroundings fade and they lose themselves in each other. Draco’s voice abandons its aristocratic edge, breaking into harsher sounds as he loses control, and Harry forgets the constant mantra to be quiet, out of sight. He wants to be seen by Draco, wants to be filled by him.
Although not strange enough to distract him from the fact that Potter swallowed thickly when he heard the word
He actually looked rather hopeless.
Draco inclined his head, but Potter wasn’t done.
Draco found himself both surprised and grateful, and then surprised again once he acknowledged that Potter would have to have mentioned this
Harry, shockingly, agreed with Malfoy’s opinion—something that only a few years ago he never would have thought possible. He hadn’t spared a thought for Malfoy since leaving Hogwarts. He hadn’t kept track, but maybe four years had passed since then. It was weird seeing him again after so long; weirder still to have to live with him for the next three months.
“What?” he whispered, feeling suddenly sick. The first two had run out, and this final one seemed shorter, half the sand already gone. “But there’s no execution now, is there? What does it want from us?”
Draco’s stomach sank. Of all the things Potter could say to him. Of all the mean-spirited, ill-willed, rigid-minded…
Harry’s fear melts away as he’s overcome with arousal. He grabs onto Draco and pulls him down on top of him, their bodies moulding together so perfectly that Harry feels himself growing instantly harder. He slides his hands down Draco’s back, mapping the lines of his body as if they weren’t already committed to memory.
“Morgan! My love! My one and only! I thought you were dead!”
But Potter didn’t let him. He met the feverish desire of Draco’s lips with slow, deep kisses, pulling Draco down into the slow, intoxicating swell of emotion he was trying to avoid. With a whimper, he stopped trying to escape it and just gave in. Slowly, Potter stepped him backward, leading him from the kitchen to the bedroom across the hall.
“You’re just in time,” Potter murmured, staring into some contraption Draco had never seen before. Made of a series of three glass orbs, it hovered in the air between them. As Draco watched, something floating in the central orb caught the light, and he realised each sphere was filled with feathers.
No, she was latching onto something else instead. Something disturbingly closer to home.
It was as if he had crossed into another dimension. The inside of the shop was caught in some kind of time spell, full of gently floating debris that drifted ever so slowly upwards, like it was still in the process of exploding at a very, very slow pace. Through the haze of smoke that curled out of the workroom door, Draco caught sight of George Weasley, suspended in mid-air and surrounded by gently floating pieces of scorched paper and cardboard.
“I’ll race you to that rock,” Potter said through chattering teeth.
“But,” Kalen hunched a little. “You’re not upset about the whole box thing?”
With nothing much else to do, he watered the rest of the succulents and watched the bees fly from flower to flower. The bees with the white stripes were slower than the others, he noted. They made far fewer trips back to the flowers, instead drifting happily on the air currents while the others dived through the air with a fierce determination.
Harry snorted. He should have known Malfoy would bring it up. “More or less. So you’ll meet them?”
Harry decided not to drink on his birthday. He had a single shot to celebrate with others—Gryffindors and Slytherins together, somehow merged into one big group—and then cut himself off. He found he preferred it that way. He could focus on the sensations of Malfoy’s fingers brushing against his hips when they danced, the look in his eyes when he caught Harry watching.
Harry cleared his throat, noting as if from a distance that Malfoy was talking about his temper. The idea was almost amusing. “You don’t have to worry about that.”
Granger rested her hand on his shoulder, squeezing gently. “We know that, Draco. Both things are true, do you get what I’m saying? I’m not consumed by guilt—I accept the factors that led us here and forgive myself for what I couldn’t do—but I also regret how things played out. I wish I’d done more.”
He traced Malfoy’s skin with his lips, burying into the crook of his neck and teasing him until soft gasps filled the room.
“Hey, Potter,” Malfoy said airily. “Why is it that the curse is targeting you? Do you think it knows you’re the useless one out of the two of us?”
“It’s a way of making amends,” he said carefully and called in his pinboard.
Potter’s kitchen was just as bare as his living room. Worn cupboards lined the walls, their white paint coated in a thin layer of dust—testimony to just how little Potter opened them. Nonetheless, the mugs he placed on the bench were clean, and his tea was the good kind, so Draco supposed the situation could be worse.
“This isn’t mine,” he fretted. “Luna, this is-”
that would hopefully help Harry clear his mind regarding everything else.
The Healer-in-Charge did nothing to hide his bewilderment. “Well, yes, he is. But-”
When she placed it on Harry’s palm, he carefully untied the knot to reveal its contents. Not even taking the object fully out, Harry’s heart stopped as he realised what it was. The
“It wants to be with you right now, Harry.”
He leafed through every picture fondly, smiling back at the people portrayed in them. The last few years had not been exactly photo-worthy, so there were not many recent pictures on the album. In fact, there was only one…
“Yes, it was… interesting.” Hermione wasn’t paying much attention to her boyfriend, though; her knowing stare focused intently on Harry. “Ron, dear… Would you mind getting me another cone? I’m not really in the mood for mint, after all.”
“It’s Malfoy,” he blurted out.
He remained silent.
“I’m sorry for forcing you to come here again.”
Harry had to laugh at that. “No. I’m here for an actual appointment.”
There was a gasp and Hermione’s hands flew to her mouth. Ron just stood there, speechless.
He gently rubbed his thumb over his shirt.
annoying. “Harry, he’s going to be a father as well; he has the right to know.”
“Exactly! And you’re planning to take it all on yourself?”
He looked away this time, scanning the crowded street before them. “It’s just… Everything’s so different.”
“Nothing, I just want to talk to you.” Just then, the girl appeared behind Ron. “To both of you.”
Harry felt himself panic. He- he couldn’t know, could he? There was no way he could…
“You should just come and sit down, mate; you have been standing here for over an hour. And I don’t think anyone else is coming.” His eyes scanned the overly packed place, and then he seemed to remember something. “Wait, Malfoy…?”
person he wanted to was literally in his hands.
Harry nodded. “Hogwarts is in good hands.” For a split second, it occurred to him that his child would be going to a Hogwarts led by a wonderful woman and witch. He suddenly felt the urgency to rub his stomach. He resisted.
The boy took one look at Harry and surprise settled in all his features. “Potter.”
“He doesn’t feel like starting a family, I can assure you.”
Earlier that day, he had woken up to one of the worst waves of nausea he had ever felt and had consequently woken up the other three teenagers on his way to the restroom to throw up. That had marked day number five.
“Trainee Healer,” he clarified. “Anyway, don’t be so happy. Remember I said I’m
“It’s not a ‘she’, is it?”
relationship, okay?”
He took a few seconds to compose himself.
Harry’s slight grimace gave Hermione all she needed to quickly catch on.
, you realise…”
“Even if they came, I don’t think you’d have much to talk about.” Harry didn’t even realise he had interrupted Ginny; he could feel his heartbeat rising.

made him think about Sirius. And the future they could have had together. And lately he’d been thinking about him a lot as it was; he didn’t need any more triggers or reminders that he would never be able to talk to his godfather again.
“It’s not just the fact that he’s a guy. I mean, yes, his reaction to that part is one of my main concerns, but… It’s more about
His godfather looked bemused. “For having fallen in love?” Harry blushed deeply, so Sirius tried to lighten the mood. “I can’t really blame you; the boy is quite handsome.”
She hesitated for a second. “You still have to tell him, you know?”
Kreacher nodded once and was gone in the blink of an eye.
He thought he’d finally made up his mind; using it would be too much of a risk. So he was just going to ask Kreacher to take it away and hide it somewhere safe. Somewhere it could wait to be inevitably found and used by someone else. Because it
“Do you really think you protect me by
But he had rejected Harry’s invitation to his party…
“Are you really not disappointed in me?”
Kreacher stood still for a moment, studying him. Then he nodded and disappeared with a
And everything Harry had planned to say suddenly slipped his mind.
But that’s how they had ended up with two delicious cones and Ron’s dripping mess that was making Harry more nauseous by the minute.
The older man’s lips were pursed. “Mr. Potter, Healer Malfoy is still a trainee. He hasn’t got the experience and skill that Healer Sallow here possesses.”
“To protect me,” Harry asserted. “So my friends wouldn’t think less of me for associating with someone like him.” He pinched the bridge of his nose and whispered, “Idiot.”
“Like you did.” Harry’s low voice displayed his dumbfoundedness. How was it possible? It was a one in a million chance. “Why are you giving it to me?”
“Contrary to what you might think, Ron,” Hermione stated with just the slightest hint of exasperation, “not everyone gets a feeling of imprisonment when they’re offered the opportunity to complete their schooling.”
Harry just hugged her back as tightly.
And suddenly the smartest person Harry knew had run out of things to say.
A loud cry sounded from the room across the corridor. Neither of them moved.
A pair of thumbs reverently caressed his newly formed small belly while more tears flowed freely down the boy’s pale skin.
If Harry hadn’t been there to witness the transformation, he would have sworn that Ginny had somehow magically transferred them into a different location. The normally gloomy and lifeless house now radiated glee and an overall festive freshness that had everyone feeling delighted.
Ridiculous as it sounded, he wanted to ask him to stay with him. That should have been an indicator of how fucked up his situation was. Instead, he watched him disappear once again, and, with shaking hands, helped himself to some water.
When they broke apart, he found Ron and Ginny staring at him sceptically.
“Kreacher!”
He jumped slightly on his seat. For a moment there, Harry had forgotten that he was not alone. Had his godfather also just read his mind?
“I believe everything should be present in my record.” He eyed the brown file that was resting on top of the desk.
this guy is…”
“Yes, you are!” They locked eyes and he could see that the blond really felt that way. “Because you love to sabotage yourself… And I’m terrible at protecting the people I care about.”
The bearded man shook his head. “Nonsense. We can take you in right now.” He directed his gaze towards a broad-shouldered Healer who was just walking in through one of the doors. “Sallow!”
“And give Rita Skeeter the chance to write a new article about how I’m dying from some mysterious illness? I don’t think so.”
go ahead and drink it.”
“You’re, er, awake.”
it will be okay
“And so do we.” Theo hooks his arm around Blaise’s. “By all means, Potter, Draco, do carry on being disgustingly romantic.” They wave and disappear back into the crowds of people.
“Of course not!” Draco looks down at his hands and sighs. “Oh, stuff it. I’ve loved you for so
“Well, now you aren’t,” Harry mutters quietly, and she glares.
Harry steps into the room, rubbing his eyes groggily against the sunlight bursting through the windows. Draco simply smirks and opens the curtains wider with a flick of his wand.
“The McVee family.” Draco interrupts smoothly. “You see, we’re currently apprenticing for Mister McVee, our beloved uncle, to get familiar with the business, which we’re planning to take over in a couple years. He asked us to come visit you in search of a prized treasure he’s been searching for, saying you were the only person he could trust to sell genuine artifacts with value. He asked about a… necklace, with a small pendant in the shape of an hourglass? Was that what it was, Trent?”
“Because I get jealous really easily.” Draco replies, crossing his arms. “So what do you have to say?”
A red-faced Ron brings his anxious thoughts to a halt. “Don’t you agree, Harry?”
Teeny throws a final nervous look behind her, as if expecting to be chastised and dragged away any moment, but takes a deep, shuddering breath and pushes the door open, welcoming the two of them in without even looking twice at Harry.
Draco’s cheeks are splotched scarlet, and the first thing Harry notices—after his swollen lips, which, let’s face it, are the probably and definitely the sexiest thing in this entire fucking galaxy—is that the dazed, dreamy look has vanished entirely from his eyes, replaced by a devious, smug streak of satisfaction.
“Could you at least tell us to whom it was sold?” Draco pleads. “Our uncle would be so devastated, and we would hate to let him down. Perhaps we could strike a deal with the buyers.”
“I knew that would be his reaction.” Theo sighs sadly. “It isn’t easy to believe that after decades of neglect and abuse, his father would suddenly change and radically alter his perspectives.”
Getting Teeny to finally leave the house takes a significant amount of effort that mainly consisted of enduring her piercing wails and weeping sobs. The process required immense patience—a quality that Harry and Draco both lacked in great quantities—but the house-elf relents after nearly two hours’ worth of persuasion.
Harry gulps. He did
“Ow!” Harry exclaimed, crashing into Draco’s back as he stopped abruptly, gesturing for him to be quiet.

“I’ll give you one more shot.”
know what it’s like not to have one. And… wow. I’m so sorry.” Draco shrugs. “It hurts, yeah?”
“Right. Sorry.”
out of all things, how ridiculous—“
“Who else is here?” He approaches his table and sticks out a hand. “I’m Ethan.”
A familiar drawl rings in Harry’s ears, and he jolts awake, scrambling for his glasses and pushing them onto his face. His vision clears, and he pushes himself into an upright position, bunching the covers around his torso protectively.
Draco sighs. “You’re an idiot. But here's the thing: you’re
“Lost, Potter?”
Harry doesn’t say a word and wills himself to stay silent and still, even though it feels like every nerve ending in his body is exploding in fireworks—crackling and buzzing and craving more of the tantalizing feel of Draco’s smooth, cool skin nudging against his knuckles and wrapping around his wrists with every passing second. He doesn’t want Draco to see just how affected he is by their sudden proximity, so he swallows and averts his gaze from the thin veins traced in teal mapped on his pale skin, over to the frying pan sizzling to his left.
plotting ways to taunt Potter, trap Potter, bait Potter, get Potter’s knickers in a twist, quite literally—“ Theo chuckles. “If anyone had an obsession, it was him.”
Harry shifts to the other side, but Draco starts to pout, and he quickly decides he can’t handle him pouting—not when he looks so adorable and so freaking helpless. Harry, with great effort and sacrifice, closes his eyes, willing himself to count sheep in his mind, picture a calming beach with the waves lapping against the sand—anything but letting his attention wander over to Draco still caressing and attempting to tame his hair and messing it up even worse. He’s finally settled on thinking about the warm, laughter-filled nights he’d spent with Hermione and Ron last summer, curled up on armchairs and eating Mrs. Weasley’s scrumptious home-cooked meals every day—
“Sounds like plain torture.”
“Hello, Harry.” He says simply.
“What kind of lullabies do house-elves sing to their children and why on Earth are they about stupid ways to get killed? And are house-elves all tone-deaf or is that just Teeny?” He mutters angrily under his breath, barely acknowledging Harry. “I can’t get the part about the mutant flobberworms out of my head, fucking hell.”
“You could’ve explained the situation a bit more clearly. You could’ve used, oh, I don’t know, maybe
Harry decides that he is going to murder her once he has escaped from this torturous conversation.
to restrain her.” Hermione dismisses him with a wave of her hand. “The point here is, you two make a good team.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Yes, I have a thing for drunk Draco and Harry totally does too... so let's see how that plays out ⸂⸂⸜(രᴗര๑)⸝⸃⸃
“Nott’s house elves are trained to recognize enemies like yourself, and to never extend their trained hospitality to them, no matter what their immediate instincts are.” He says. “You’re still Undesirable Number One in his household, even though Theodore personally has nothing against you.”
Harry’s heart thumps, and he whips around. “Uh—Draco—hello—hi.”
“That way.” Draco says, pointing. They start walking in the direction he pointed, the road eerily quiet and abandoned. The windows of the shops are greasy, the displays falling apart and appearing to have been neglected for years. Harry spots a poster advertising an intelligence-boosting elixir from 1991 as “The Latest Potions Phenomenon” and a mannequin dressed in tattered robes that bear a striking resemblance to the ones Ron had endured wearing at the Yule Ball years ago. There isn’t much to stop and marvel at, unlike the flashy, vibrant signs and loud noises usually crowding Diagon Alley, and even the sunlight seems harsh and unforgiving.
"They look pretty suspicious to me. I heard ol’ Lucius got into a right squabble with his son over there, maybe it was about this funny relationship right here—imagine, the Chosen One swapping spit with his only heir—“
“God, Harry, I didn’t know you were such a romantic.” He says sarcastically.
“One that stood out in particular was the invention of an authentic Time-Turner. While Ministry-issued Time-Turners had various restrictions that prevented the user from altering the past and thus the future too much, the one they were planning on creating had none, meaning they could go back in time five, ten, even twenty years. Back to the time before any of us were born. Back to the time when the Dark Lord was steadily rising to fame and wealth, before he had made the grave mistake of attacking a young boy—well, you.” He nods at Harry, who shifts nervously. “They thought that they could warn him about the consequences of his actions, stop him from leaving for Godric’s Hollow on that night if it came down to it.
“You seem to be having fun.”
“Don’t I think what?”
“You don’t know that yet,” Harry says, eyes narrowed.
Draco picks up his glass, holding it up to his face and pressing it against his cheek. He sighs contentedly. “So nice.”
“Mister Malfoy, Teeny doesn’t understand why you is…”
, I mean they like to, ah,
Thank you soo much to everyone for reading!! (´• ω •`) ♡
“Hi.”
“This is my best,” he sighs, finally relenting and drawing back. “I hope that shirt doesn’t hold any special sentimental value for you.”
Theo takes a deep breath. “Back when—back when the war had just ended… Most of the people who had sided with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named—they were either thrown into Azkaban, executed, or tortured for information. Not surprisingly, they were all extremely bitter and furious with the way things had turned out, and quite a few followers hoped that they would be the ones to bring the Dark Lord back to power again. Many ideas were voiced secretively, discussed through hushed conversations and coded messages in Azkaban cells, and spread widely through methods of communication the Ministry was entirely unaware about.
“Merlin’s beard, Malfoy. You’re going to pay for that.” He wheezes, his voice abnormally high-pitched, and he realizes, dismayed, that he’s now a good few inches shorter than the blond.
Blaise chuckles. “Now you’re beginning to sound more like the Draco I know.”
“Honestly, Malfoy, you needn’t be so embarrassed.” Hermione chimes in. “Harry was beyond infatuated with you in second and sixth—wait, fifth, too—wait, first, too—wait—“
Teeny’s eyes widen in disbelief (Harry's do too), and her gaze flickers over to a small marble statue sitting on his right, before she nods jerkily.
“By help he means that I berated, chided and scolded him for insisting on doing things the Muggle way and wasting so much valuable resources.”
“But Master Nott has always told Teeny, don’t accept anything from strangers…” She looks at Draco, then at Harry, and slams her puny fists on the table, causing them both to jump. “But Mister Malfoy and Mister McVee is no stranger. They is Teeny’s friends.”
--like he was actually happy, and because he actually was happy. Really, truly, and abso-freaking-lutely happy.
“Behold, the mystifying powers of alcohol,” Harry mutters, before speaking to her clearly, “We—I—need you to tell us where your Young Master is.”
“Likewise.”
“… Why?” He doesn’t reply. “I mean, you could go talk to your father about it, surely Azkaban allows communication between family members, and work your emotions out, apologize—“
“Hermione?” Harry cuts in, his voice dangerously sweet. “That’s enough.”
for him to die of natural causes in a prison cell instead of being subjected to a worse fate.” His voice shakes, and Harry notices his fists balling up.
“It’s time to find out then, no?” She gets up from behind the desk, waking up Crookshanks, who had been dozing off in her lap, and sending him hissing angrily at the interruption. She leans down to soothe him, and he twitches his tail and brushes up against her legs. She looks up and smirks. “Don’t worry. I’ll send help if one of you manage to kill the other.”
“Oh, and Harry, Malfoy?” Hermione calls out sweetly, and they both turn around, nearly in sync.
“But, as you might have already figured out, it never happened. Because the one person who had been the most active, the most vocal when debating different tactics and strategies, the one person they had counted on most to bring back their venerated lord, betrayed them.” Theo looks down at his lap. “And that man was your father, Draco.”
“Granger, you’re quite terrible at this. But since I’ve already watched Potter flounder and stammer enough to last me a lifetime—Weasley, Harry and I are together. As in
Just then, Draco slumps over, his head falling onto Harry’s shoulder and lolling gently. He whines, his eyes still closed, “Can I have a hug? Pretty please?” Harry’s insides do a swooping flip, and he really tries to look at anywhere but at Draco’s lips, which are painted a delicate shade of baby pink, parted slightly in the middle, practically begging to be kissed.
to his mental checklist, right below
Harry's head is spinning out of control, spiraling and whirring. He scowls. “So is this some sort of
He stretches out an arm, reaching for a spot on the tip of Harry’s mouth, but pulls it back, running his teeth along his lips thoughtfully. Harry looks at him curiously, and he gives a wicked grin and leans over, pressing his lips firmly against the spot, licking the tiny speck of cream off Harry’s lips teasingly. Harry groans and tilts his head up, properly crashing his lips against Draco’s and savoring the spicy, sweet scent of pumpkin that slips into his mouth, spreading softly.
“There’s much, much more to it than what meets the eye,” Draco says suddenly, his eyes fixed straight ahead.
He arrives at the front door after what seems like several eternities and is greeted with the same serpentine knocker as the one from the mansion. He’s just about to rap it against the door when it swings open, revealing an amused Theo, who calls out, “I was right, Blaise. It’s Potter towing Draco, not the other way around. Pay up.”
Draco nods, the gesture seeming less out of understanding and more out of a growing desire to go to bed. He rubs his eyes sleepily, and an image of tucking a murmuring, mewling Draco Malfoy to bed pops into Harry’s mind without any warning—he pushes it away vigorously, fanning his face and clearing his throat even though Draco’s far from paying him any attention. He was so glad Draco wasn’t an accomplished Legilimens.
“Erm, Teeny?” She ignores him, continuing to belch out disturbing lyrics. He waves a hand in front of her eyes, and she blinks slowly.
“So.” He says, eyes bright and excited. “Are you having fun?”
“Imported from Italy last month. Unicorn hairs laced with lavender stems, with Puffskein fur added in for the extra poof, and dyed in brilliant
“Yes, because it really seemed like it when you were seconds away from leaving the building to board public
Harry shudders.
“You mean… Malfoy and I, we’re, uh.”
“All in the same year, in case you were wondering.” Draco adds, smiling. He suddenly frowns. “Also, Potter, don’t insult my hoop like that. It was my most prized possession when I was a wee little child.”
“A little punctuality would be even better.” He replies, turning around in his chair to face Harry, who squints and shields his eyes with his hand.
Harry wraps both his arms around Draco’s waist, burying his face into his back. He smiles as he feels Draco flinch, surprised. Considering how brave and blasé a front he usually had on, the smallest, subtlest gestures elicited the cutest reactions out of him. His voice muffled, he replies “I didn’t know
Theo rolls his eyes. “This is a vacation cottage we only use two or three weeks a year. Do you honestly think we have that many spare bedrooms?”
He shook his head, trying to rid it of baffling questions he could never provide a satisfying answer to--along with images of a certain blond that accompanied the thoughts for mysterious reasons Harry didn’t want to know and didn’t want to think about.
him for quite long, but our, er, friendship is hardly set in stone.”
mean what he thought he meant. “And why... are you telling me that?”
“They’ll be gone in no time.”
“Not very smart, either,” Draco notes, and the guy clamps his mouth shut, glaring. “Yes, we mean that we’re here together, that we’re here, and that we’re together.”
. And I’m only addressing this to you because you’re the only one here who hasn’t picked up on this yet and I’m feeling particularly sympathetic today.”
Draco casually strolls to the front gates, waving his wand in a complicated fashion to make them swing open. Harry trails behind him uncertainly, his eyes swiveling from the extravagant fountains adorning the garden to the butterflies flapping their wings and resting on bright, blooming flowers. He hadn’t really bothered to invest his intimidating loads of money into house decorating and furnishing, letting Hermione and Ron (mostly Hermione) do all the planning and moving. His own room was still packed with boxes, and he spent most of his time there sleeping, curled up on his comfortable bed.
“Tired?” Theo guesses, and Harry nods gratefully, glad for any excuse to escape this painful moment. He stands up quickly, stealing another glance at Draco. “I’ll lead you up to the guest bedroom—but I suppose I should warn you, Draco is not a content sleeper.”
“I can cook,” Harry volunteers. “I spent the first half of my life doing nothing but chores from washing dishes to scrubbing floors.”
“You weren’t drunk,” Harry says suddenly.
Harry walks over to the bowl, holding the whisk firmly in his right hand and starting to run it in circles, smoothing out the mixture. He feels like he’s being watched very closely and tries to do as nice a job as he can—but a few minutes later, Draco sighs and comes up behind him—and reaches his left arm, threading it through the small niche between Harry’s elbow and waist, to grab the bowl steadily, and his right to close his hand over Harry’s.
“Partners who became partners,” Blaise sniggers. “What a love story.”
“Careful, Potter. Wouldn’t want you to rip custom-made designer clothing.” He says dryly, scanning his surroundings.
“What are you saying?”
So his mouth drops open when Hermione sighs, and turning to Blaise, says irritably, “I
Draco nods, a small, jerky movement, that Harry only catches because he’s paying such close attention, he can see the slight upwards curve of Draco’s long lashes and the way he’s gently biting down on his lower lip.
Harry bit his lip. He was being ridiculous. He was currently broken up with Ginny, sure, but the fact that he’d dated her—held her hand, made out with her, enjoyed spending time with her in a totally non-platonic way—meant he couldn’t possibly like blokes in
Teeny hoists herself up, staggering and limping, and stares at them with woeful eyes. Draco grimaces. “Drinks with the Boy Who Lived and the Elf Who Cried. Sounds positively
, Harry thinks sheepishly. “And the elf fell asleep around thirty minutes ago, and we obviously didn’t want to wake her. We also don’t know how to bloody cook. Hence this stinking mess of a meal.” He gestures sharply to the steaming, melting pile of what Harry assumed—and sincerely hoped—was scrambled eggs and toast. (With sausages. Were those sausages? They were awfully pink.)
“Shut. Up.” A corner of Harry’s mouth twists up. “Don’t even try to apologize, because I’m not listening, you prat. All I could think of while you were stammering that stupid speech was how much time we were wasting when we could be kissing and how attractive you are right after a shag and how glad I am that you told me you loved me first.”
He gapes. “What is
“Uh, alright.” Harry makes his way to the kitchen tentatively. He scans the area and finds that most of the items and equipment he remembered from the Dursleys’ are missing. There’s a sink and a cooktop, but that’s pretty much it.
Theo fingers the gold chain of the Time-Turner. “He realized he didn’t want that, any of it. During the long, long months he spent in Azkaban, he’d experienced hurt and cruelty like he’d never done before. He looked back on his life and saw that it was tainted with evil and malice, tarnished and sullied with the blood of the people whose lives he’d ruthlessly torn apart. He finally thought those three words that led him on a path to reflection and redemption: he was sorry. And he was tired of advocating for more evil and more harm, more devastation. So he gave the Time-Turner to me.
“You think I can’t hear you because I’m old? Well, let me tell you, these ears of mine are blessed—have been for a good few decades now. I can hear everything from your pathetic little heartbeats hammering away like frightened rabbits to the rat two blocks over scurrying home with a banana peel between its teeth!” She scowls. “Now give me a good reason as to why you woke me up because now you’re just wasting my time.” She crosses her arms and lifts her chin.
Harry laughs nervously. That could
“I think that—that—oh, there’s Ginny and Luna, we should go and say hi.” Harry says hurriedly, spotting the pair strolling into the party, holding hands.
“Yes, that time,” Theo says calmly. “It took a fair amount of interrogation and investigation to finally figure out Draco’s motives.”
Harry lets out a laugh. Theo and Blaise shoot them strange looks, but gesture them over to the sitting room, where they settle into the loveseat, leaving Harry and Draco to share the sofa and flooding Harry with memories from the previous night. He tries to sit as far away from Draco as possible, but something must be wrong, because Draco’s thighs keep pressing into his no matter how much he scoots in the opposite direction.
“That’s uh, that’s my name,” Harry says, and seriously considers kicking himself in the shin for being so stupid. Draco assumes an amused expression, and Harry blushes.
She claps her hands. “He was a sight, that one. Dark skinned, powerfully built, kept running his hands through his hair—incredibly vain, I suppose.” She sniffs. “A young man like that could do so much better—he could start with getting a girl, for starters.”
“Because there was no life to be had in that world, so long as the Dark Lord ruled,” Regulus said, before indicating with a nod that Draco eat something. “And the tides of war were quite in his favour. I had no intention of either serving him, nor of subjecting my family to the fate of traitors. So, I ordered Kreacher to leave me to the Inferni -” Regulus leaned back in his stool, clapping his hands together, “- and then I rolled.”
- up the side of the bridge and he hastily cast a Patronus Charm, that snuffed out the ‘
He’d absolutely noticed. He’d noticed the warmth radiating both from Malfoy’s proximity as he leaned into Harry’s side and from his smile as he laughed along with his teammates and the speakers on the stage. He’d noticed, for all of Malfoy’s cockiness, how that would fall away at certain moments, particularly when genuine praise or admiration were cast his way and he’d swallow and avert his gaze a little—almost shy—and Harry found that strangely endearing.
Something twisted, dark and sinister within the cave, a magic much the same as it had been in the forest the day before.
Draco glowered at him, though his lips twitched, and Harry fought a smile of his own as he stepped around behind him.
Luna didn’t look surprised, either.
Both leapt to their feet seeing it approach, wands drawn, but the dementor came to a sudden halt when it reached Draco.
He thought he felt Malfoy laugh but he didn’t want to pull back to check. So Harry just carried on breathing him in, with each step made across the dancefloor.
Just the usual walk down to breakfast in the Great Hall.
A smile played on Draco’s lips but it lacked the teasing that he’d been throwing Harry’s way earlier. Now, he looked bemused and there was still a hauntedness in his eyes at whatever he’d seen. His bemusement fell away, his eyes dropping but Harry saw the hauntedness within them winning out, taking hold.
The ongoing roar that had sounded in the classroom slowly died out, as he raised his hand, shielding his eyes and squinting in the harsh sunlight, making out the trees and the grass and the breeze that stirred them.
"You've told me that already."
you so love to be,” Draco said, rolling his eyes as he grasped Harry by the arm and hauled him back. “Two lives, mind?”
Logically, they shouldn’t be doing this
and that they were probably already in the beginning of it.
Harry would have been happy just to carry on like this.
and Draco scoffed, shooting him a look over his shoulder.
“Perhaps you’re not far off,” Draco said, after a minute, eyes on the ceiling when he added. “Your company is not
“Try and keep your eyes open, Potter. It’s not that frightening, surely.”
Harry sighed at the air of indifference he gave off - tried to - that failed to hide anything now that Harry was paying attention.
“How did you -”
Harry started, looking at her quickly. His first instinct was to be honest. But several hours in, with the drinks and the flirting flowing, things were all becoming a bit hazy and he wasn’t a hundred percent sure, anymore, what the lie actually was. So, he just shifted on his feet. “Er. Yeah.”
- which was quickly replaced with regret that he hadn’t gone back to the Astronomy Tower in the nights that followed.
Draco tugged on the hem of Harry’s shirt, pulling it up over his head, so they could press skin to skin and Harry was almost blown away by it. How smooth and hard and warm and perfect he felt against him.
Cheers and chants echoed throughout the stadium while the players flew around the pitch, celebrating and commiserating and smiling at their fans.
He only remembered the warmth.
Small fur creatures darted away through the long grass of the meadow in which they stood, disturbed by their arrival. Cornish Pixies, at least a dozen, flew by, close enough to stir the air in front of him. Hippogriffs, three of them, made their way leisurely into the forest some distance away, passing by a unicorn that stepped out from the shelter of the trees.
Draco grinned, glancing down at him where he was still kneeling, and Harry was sure that Draco was entirely aware of the effect the sight of him half-naked - and still wet - was having on him, his shirt still hanging loose, unbuttoned.
and it was only then that he noticed the air around him going colder, his breaths visible before him, the atmosphere becoming heavy with dread and darkness and the loom of all that he had seen - too, too much - began to tug at the edge of his consciousness.

“Malfoy,” he said, when he stepped into place beside him.
“Oh -” Harry frowned, feeling suddenly off balance at the question. “Um...well. He’s - uh...he’s…”
like Draco like that. And, most likely, he had done for a while and, maybe, it wasn’t the Astronomy Tower itself that was grounding him, it was the person who would be waiting for him inside it.
Although, if he

in his gaze as they did. “But if you toe the line, follow the rules, you might get by unnoticed. You might just survive.”
Regulus nodded, his gaze still upon them when he went on. “How did he go? My brother.”
looking for you when I came to the pub that night.”
Harry’s heart skipped at the sight, knowing exactly how that particular area of flesh felt against his lips, the feel of a quickening pulse and the taste of him.
“What is that?” Harry eyed the white rose Malfoy was wielding.
Brow knitted, Draco held himself taut, tense, as if whatever was haunting him was
And then they were in darkness, the only sound their panting breaths for a few moments, until Harry spoke.
“He speaks.” Draco’s eyebrows lifted, even if he didn’t stop in his stride. “Was beginning to wonder if you’d lost your tongue this week.”
With each step deeper into the woodland, the fog in his mind became thicker.
Harry - with irritating effort - kept his attention on his own collection of parchments to be sealed, rather than following her gaze and lifted and dropped the wax in a messy dollop.
Harry stepped back a bit, letting Draco take over the steering. “Oh, and you do?”
He glanced back at the long stretch of woodland behind him that he’d apparently walked - the time it must have taken lost to him - and noticed it was darker, now, within and he wasn’t entirely sure if that was down to the due sunset.
?” Draco scoffed. “If you rolled as a single, you’d have come without magic.”
Harry slipped out from under the Invisibility Cloak - his
“I won’t be giving this up without a fight, either.”
Draco raised an eyebrow. “Who else?”
that had been lighting the way, his silver stag bursting forth and chasing the dementor out of sight.
There was darkness - nothingness - and then a flash of light and Harry found himself standing at the beginning of the bridge, seeing the other three up ahead as they appeared in flashes, battling off the dementors - a silver hare that bounded, chasing off those that ascended from below.
Harry thought it might have been less awkward if he had. They’d probably be kissing, now, rather than standing awkwardly on the doorstep for anyone to see. Harry thought they’d likely have ended up in bed, actually.
Harry leaned down, taking Draco’s cock - hot and thick and heavy - into his hand first, stroking from top to bottom and delighting in the way Draco immediately shuddered, breath hitching, and then Harry lowered his head, flicking his tongue over the tip, curiously, tasting the new, bitter saltiness there and when Draco twitched in his hand Harry leaned down, further, taking him fully into his mouth in one slow suck.
In answer, Potter gave him a funny look, then stood up and Vanished his coffee set. “Doesn’t matter. Sorry to barge in on you like that, Malfoy. I know what I’ve got to research now.”
With a tremendous amount of effort, he takes the paper Draco passes him and sits down at the table. It isn’t long before he throws the paper away again, good mood evaporating and taking with it the pleasant cloud of lethargy that usually sits with him until his first cup of tea.
Malfoy started making regular little sounds, thrashing his head from time to time, but it wasn’t enough. Harry had read in one of the other books about the perineum, and how pressing against it was a way of hitting the prostate from the outside. He put that knowledge to good use now, using his free hand to cup Malfoy’s balls and feel around with his thumb until Malfoy was rocking enthusiastically back against him and swearing.
The words ran through Draco’s mind long after the conversation had moved on. The party faded around him—the noise, sights, smells all paling in comparison to the direction his thoughts had taken. There was something in those words, some key, if he just knew how to look.
The fact that Lockhart was here was endlessly hilarious to Harry, and yet he still couldn't manage to laugh.
It was clean and surprisingly comfortable, warm and lit up inside with an open plan area, two bedrooms, a bathroom and, most pleasingly of all,
Though he obviously wouldn’t see
Harry raised an eyebrow, smiling. “Go on, then.”
“I doubt this is what was on her mind, either, Potter.”
Draco held out a hand, with a pointed look at the map in Harry’s hand.
“Oh no,” Malfoy said, waving a dismissive hand as he turned on the stool to face him. “This is far too appealing an offer to let slip. While I'm quite aware of what’s in it for me and the Arrows...what do
“I imagine the game recognised that it was in danger of becoming obsolete once the dice ended up at the bottom of a lake filled with inferni. Likely, it replenished itself and, in doing so, restarted the game - my map with the quests I’d been granted disappearing along with it.”
Harry headed over, making to do the same, but Draco walked away just as he reached where he was standing and Harry tried to make sense of what just happened as he redressed himself.
“Hm.” Regulus tapped his fingers against his lips in a show of thinking, where he sat opposite Harry at the table. “Embarking on a grand plan to rid the world of the Dark Lord’s horcrux without first considering how one might actually survive oneself. Sounds rather like something a Gryffindor would do, don’t you think?”
They dodged the grasping vines of Devil’s Snare.
and boarded the Hogwarts Express at Kings Cross Station to the stares of those on the platform, amid the frantic camera flashes of the paparazzi.
” - before being hit by Bellatrix Lestrange’s curse, and the look on his face as he’d slipped through the veil.
Harry frowned. “You did? Was I...was it obvious or something?”
Harry thought he heard Draco scoff.
Draco hummed in thought. “I don’t recognise them.” A conflicting thought hit him. “Should I be morally opposed to taking pleasure from this?”
“Oh, and it’s warm there!” Hermione pointed out, looking pleased. “Yes, let’s do that.”
“—assumed that’s why you added the second core to yours and your father’s wands. So you could bring some of the Veela Divination mastery into your spellwork and help Voldemort with his prophecy obsession.” Potter shrugged.
“Get Blaise,” Draco whispered.
.” He almost sounded afraid.
Harry shut the door and crossed over to his own bed, sitting down so he was facing Malfoy. Finally, Malfoy looked up.
She seemed oblivious to the way Draco flinched at her use of his name. “And we aren’t in any rush, are we?”
It was only a few seconds before his eyebrows raised in recognition.
“—what
At first, Harry wasn’t sure if Draco even remembered what had happened, though Harry was sure there hadn't been enough firewhiskey for that and the notion was quickly driven away after an initial day of Harry...well...avoiding Draco altogether in a manner totally unbefitting of a Gryffindor.
They lay on the couch, catching their breath, in a boneless heap, for a few minutes afterwards - and Harry loved it, the weight of Draco above him - until he felt the soft press of a kiss to his shoulder that gave him flurries of warmth in his stomach before Draco rolled off him and to the side, pressing his back against the cushions of the couch to look at him again.
Harry started to speak but Luna groaned, making him turn back to her, instead, growing more alarmed by the second at the way her breathing was becoming shallower, almost drifting away.
’,” Draco grumbled, sitting sideways on the other side of the couch, his knees drawn up while he looked at Harry where he was sitting, as completely at a loss as Draco was as to what they should be doing to find their own.
Harry’s mind fired back.
Harry tensed.
Draco released a huff of laughter, but his eyes were dark with want as he gazed down at him. “Someone might come down.”
Harry yanked Draco’s trousers off, boxers following suit, casting them aside. “I don’t give a toss.”
“I’m fine, Harry. That was rather strange, though,” Luna said, looking down at herself with a bemused expression, seeming less affected by the whole thing than Harry was - his heart still thump, thump, thumping away - as she brushed down her robes.
Draco raised an eyebrow.
He crashed, headfirst into the bank, and hauled himself up, vaguely registering Draco climbing out just behind him and Luna up ahead -
He was not standing here in the middle of this creepy, haunted forest, pitching a tent in his trousers over Draco -
Draco rolled his eyes, before he slid the lid off the box, pulling out a die and a rule card.
“I suppose I should be flattered that I was Harry Potter’s ‘Chosen One’ to test out the waters of public dating,” Malfoy said, a smirk playing on his lips as he took a drink. “What do you do with the rest of them? Polyjuice? Exclusive Island Retreats? Stick them under an Invisibility Cloak?”
And that had sounded so much like her… Thank Merlin she was back.
Harry instantly thought of what Sirius had said about the different ways in which different people express love. He was now learning to identify this boy’s,
The blond was always trying his hardest to conceal that part of himself from people. He’d tried so hard to conceal it from Harry as well. But the man was now training to become a Healer, for Merlin’s sake… And that just said so much about the person he really was.
-.-.-.-.-.-.-
“Listen… I’m aware that this is the complete opposite from what you signed up for; I’m not here to demand anything from you. We’re so young, and you’re just getting started with your career, and I’d never-”
“We’re talking about
Harry’s breath hitched as it actually dawned on him that the possibility of talking to
Grey eyes slowly sealed shut and the shaky breath that followed was so full of emotion that it made Harry’s confidence waver.
“A year?! Harry-” Ron was now definitely offended.
He had his friends’ full attention. And so Harry dropped the third and biggest bombshell. “I’m pregnant.”
Harry just shook his head.
Ron greeted Harry at the entrance to the Burrow. He looked surprised to see him. “Hey, mate.”
.” Harry deliberately omitted the part where he lost his temper at the boy’s boss in front of everyone at the reception in the process.
Malfoy?”
“I’ll wait here.”
He ran his finger over it and, for the first time ever, he noticed the caption accompanying it, delicately scribbled in Ginny’s handwriting:
“Okay, what about this… Invite him to the party and observe his reaction. It should give you a clue as to how he feels.”
Then again, the boy had spent his birthday with him of all people. He had been genuinely worried the day Harry was feeling nauseous. And he had…
“It is,” Luna agreed. “Speaking of good hands, I actually found something of yours at the Forest and I’ve been intending to give it back.” She rummaged through one of the pockets of her salmon-coloured dress and took out a small satin bag that was tied with a single ribbon.
“Actually, I was hoping I could see Healer Malfoy,” Harry interrupted. “He’s on duty right now, isn’t he?” He had purposely changed his appointment to make sure it would match Malfoy’s work shift.
“And that’s why Ron doesn’t know anything about this.” She was so clever; Harry loved her to bits.
She sighed with affection and squeezed both her friend and boyfriend’s hands. “I missed you too… I have to admit, sometimes Hogwarts did feel a little bit like prison without you two in there.”
“Okay, okay. I guess I can do that.”
was his new life.
“Mr. Weasley’s with George at the shop. And, well, I don’t think we’re supposed to discuss details, but Ginny and Mrs. Weasley have been getting everything ready for your party these last couple of days.”
“Remember all the vomiting and dizzy spells?” They nodded. “Well, I did go to St. Mungo’s a few days ago…”
“They had each other,” Harry countered back.
He allowed himself to lie there for quite a while before he was calling for Kreacher. As per usual, the elf appeared by his side within a second.
assume I did not know? Harry, you just said it, I’m your best friend.”
“It’s okay. I think it’s better this way.”
Ron and Hermione walked to him.
Harry stood up, the small of his back complaining over the amount of time he had spent on that lumpy chair.
“Honestly, I’m probably just a little weak from throwing up earlier.”
“Just think about that.”
“I just know I already love this baby with my whole heart, Ron. If I have to do it on my own, I will.”
He did.
He frowned at him. “About what?”
She sighed. “Harry. Just…”
He closed his eyes and sighed. “I know I have a lot of people who love and support me-”
Harry nodded.
A smile settled on his lips as he simply said, “You.”
So after having spent a couple of hours keeping the older Weasley company, they agreed to make a last stop at Florean Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlour. The large crowd they believed to have avoided at George’s shop had received them there, including a few journalists and photographers who were surely going to grace the Daily Prophet’s front page with an article about
His eyes spotted a leather-clad notebook that was just peeking out from under his bed and a single tear slipped from one of them. He bent down to take it and dusted it off with his hand. It was the photo album Hagrid had gifted him during his first year at Hogwarts.
“What?” Harry was utterly stunned. “How could you know?”
“So,” Ron mumbled, too absorbed in licking his ice cream to notice Harry’s grossed out face, “what does it feel like to be free at last?”
Their lips met again, this time with more confidence on behalf of both parts. Harry thought back to the caption on his photo album and couldn’t help but smile into the kiss.
“You know, I’m going to pretend I’m not at all offended by the fact that you thought I was a homophobic bastard...”
Several days after Voldemort’s defeat, Harry had been having breakfast along with the group of people that were helping with the castle’s reconstruction. Every single person Harry loved and cared about was there; but there was a horrid atmosphere of grief and sorrow. Ginny had then stood up from her seat and returned minutes later carrying a small camera she’d found inside one of the classrooms. She’d delivered a small speech about how life goes on and how they should focus on enjoying it and the people who were still there, on behalf of those who weren’t. Touched by her words, everyone gathered for a photo to commemorate the moment.
He seemed so fragile like that… Enclosed and suffocated by the walls he had built up himself and all the unsaid words he kept insisting on swallowing.
“I didn’t realise-” The blond peeked outside, as if looking for something. “Do you want me to get someone else?”
Harry nodded.
Hermione seemed unconcerned. “You’re making it sound so serious. Look, I don’t know why you’re saying all this, but I’m sure that Ron will-”
“Please go find Ron at the Burrow and tell him that I have to borrow Pig for a few hours,” Harry stated confidently. “I need to reschedule an appointment.”
He’d already finished skimming through one of the worn-out issues of Witch Weekly when the door creaked open and the person he’d been dying to see walked in, looking all professional in his lime green uniform.
Harry shook his head, even though Malfoy’s eyes were still closed. “I’m not the one making things difficult.”
The pair exchanged glances.
“I mean,” it was Harry’s turn to blush, “we just have,
“What do you mean?”
“I’m so sorry, Harry,” Hermione spoke softly.
Harry looked at her in confusion. “What are you talking about?”
Harry swayed slightly and Kreacher was quick to grab him by the wrists. As soon as they touched, though, the grumpy creature’s ears shot upwards and his eyes grew wide. He turned to gaze at Harry’s middle intently.
“First of all, I want to apologise for not telling you about this before; I was scared to do it. But you’re my best friend, and I don’t want to keep anything from you anymore.” From the other side of the couch, Hermione offered him a reassuring smile. So Harry went on. “I’m gay.”
His disparaging remarks made Harry’s blood boil.
“Here.” Harry looked up from where he had been rummaging through some drawers and was met with a steaming cup of tea that Hermione was offering him. “How are you feeling?”
Harry had taken a glance and felt like crying when he saw all the effort his friend had put into organising all that just for him.
“Are going to have to learn to trust yourself. If not for you then for that little one right there.” A ghostly finger pointed at his abdomen.
But if there was something Harry was tired of, it was thinking. So for the time being he just went back to his Salted Caramel Blondie ice cream. The one that he definitely
-.-.-.-.-.-.-
Harry’s defiant words left the entire room speechless. If he was going to cause a scene, it’d be to defend the father of his child.
He reluctantly shook his hand. “Good afternoon, Healer Harton.”
He was
He shook his head.
“I don’t know, mate, this has been going on for far more time than it should be… Maybe we should consider going to St. Mungo’s.” And Harry didn’t fail to notice the way Ron had used the word “we” instead of “you”. He truly did have a family now; what would Harry do without them?
When he had agreed to this whole thing with Malfoy, he’d thought it was all about winning and absolutely nothing to lose. A meaningless whim he could put an end to whenever he wanted to… Now it looked like he’d ended up “winning” far more than what he could have possibly asked for. And that had been his second slip-up...
Hermione must have sensed his nervousness increasing, because she leaned forward and took one of his hands. “It’s okay, Harry. Take your time.”
After another quick glance at Hermione, he spoke the words before he could have time to back out. “This
House of Black...” He regarded him lovingly. “You’re the best thing that’s happened to my lineage in generations.”
Harry didn’t even think about it. One second he was frozen after hearing those words, and the next one he was closing the space between them and kissing the other boy without a care in the world.
“Mr. Harry Potter.”
is Draco Malfoy.” He made sure to include his first name this time.
“Where’s everyone?”
Harry beamed. “No, Gin. Your list will do.”
“Maybe you should think about it, Harry…”
They looked at each other amidst an uncomfortable silence, until Hermione burst out laughing.
“Hello-”
seeing him.”
He was now currently leaning against the ornamented banister that had a perfect view of the front door, opting to stay there so he wouldn’t have to be moving from one place to the other to greet the guests and accept their congratulations.
“I know, it sounds awful,” Harry conceded, “but the main reason I didn’t tell you was because it’s not… It’s just not a
Harry hesitated for a bit. When he couldn’t think of a way of escaping the question, he answered, “I have an appointment at half past two.”
And just like that, the tension was gone.
“I’m sorry.” He truly was sorry, but he was also incredibly relieved. However, this was just one less obstacle; and Harry had two more to go through with Ron that day. “There’s more to it, though.”
“You haven’t told him,” Hermione whispered. “Harry!”
For the second time in less than an hour, Harry’s eyes filled with tears.
-.-.-.-.-.-.-
“You’re not dying from some mysterious illness.”
did he do that?”
The man winked at him. “It’s always my pleasure, kiddo. Always my pleasure.”
That was the day he’d first considered the possibility of there being something more to their, apparently, strictly sexual relationship. At least on Harry’s behalf.
“Hi. Is Hermione here?” Harry knew it was a stupid question; of course Hermione was there.
Harry climbed the stairs one by one until he reached the top floor. He had adopted his godfather’s room as his own since the day he decided to move there and hadn’t dare to move one single thing, wanting to keep everything as close as possible to what had been Sirius’ bedroom.
“What about some of our former classmates?”
was his new chapter,
-.-.-.-.-.-.-
“So you’re okay with it?” Harry needed to be sure.
Harry’s throat tightened and he let his hand find its way to his stomach.
“I know.” Harry’s eyes were still wide as he looked at her. “It shouldn’t be wandering around in a place where anyone could find it.”
“Oh, Harry.” Hermione threw herself at him. “How can you possibly doubt it?” While he was hugging her, he cast a glance at Ron. He couldn’t recognise the emotion portrayed on his best friend’s face, but Harry was suddenly scared. “This is great! It’s… I’m just so, so happy.” The girl wiped her wet cheeks with her hand.
When Malfoy opened his eyes, Harry could see that they were holding back tears. He laid them on his and asked, “Are you planning on keeping it?”
“Oh, that won’t be necessary,” Harry said, but the man had already begun approaching them after hearing his name being called out.
This time, Harry didn’t try to do anything to contain his tears. He soon felt arms around him and a light kiss on top of his head along with a whispered, “Thank you.”
“Mr. Potter, wait.” He turned to face the older man, ready to fight him again if needed. “If you’d come with me… I’ll take you to one of the examination rooms.” He sounded like a little child who had just been scolded. Harry tried not to take too much pride in that and just nodded his head.
“Don’t be ridiculous, I specifically requested
Malfoy looked at him suspiciously and finally closed the door. “Is this an attempt to, get creative, Potter? Because this really isn’t an
being there?”
When she moved to give Ron space, Harry was sure he was about to get punched; or at least yelled at. But all the redhead did was take him into his arms. “I’m so sorry I overreacted.” He let go of him only to look into his eyes and tell him with absolute genuineness, “You’re my brother. And you can fucking bet I will love any child of yours just as much as I love you.”
Not now, not ever.
Ginny spoke then. “You can always use Polyjuice.”
There were sets of crimson and golden luminous balloons in every corner, shimmering lights floating around conjured by Hermione, and a huge table that Mrs. Weasley had set up containing so much food it even rivalled Hogwarts’ Welcoming Feast.
And it was amazing to see how fast his friend’s expression changed to show the biggest smile. “Are you really?! Harry, that’s amazing! You never mentioned it in your letters.”
“I’m sorry,” she let out in between giggles. “It’s just… You two are so funny sometimes.”
“I think you’d be surprised.”
Harry looked at him. “Not for now. Thanks.”
She sat down again as soon as he was gone. “Alright, what’s wrong?”
“I don’t have ‘other friends’, Hermione, you know that.”
After a few seconds she managed to stutter, “Wait, Malfoy as in…
Harry grinned. “I learned from the master himself.”
“It’s your first
Hermione sighed. “Look, I know you’ve already come up with all the reasons why making this work would be impossible. But one year ago, this conversation would have seemed impossible. And we’re actually having it now.”
And once again, Ginny was the one to break the silence. “Harry, are you going to invite anyone to the party?”
baby.
He let himself play with the piece of metal for a few minutes. He liked that piece of metal; he liked it
Two weeks after Harry and Hermione’s deep talk found the three of them, plus Ginny, amongst dusty boxes, magically-extended trunks, and just piles and piles of all kinds of ancient things. Harry’s friends had offered to stay with him for a few days and help him tidy everything up.
“I don’t think Harry would appreciate any of them at his party,” Ron chimed in, frowning.
Hermione’s quiet chuckle brought Harry’s attention back to the conversation and away from the disgusting mixture of peanut butter and watermelon that was his best friend’s ice cream. They had picked up the proud graduate from King’s Cross early in the morning and were planning to take her straight home, but she insisted on dropping by Diagon Alley to check on George.
“All this time and you’re still playing that game.”
“Perhaps someone from work?”
“That’s okay, Kreacher, you can put it on the floor.”
“When did you become so good with words?” he asked after a moment.
He turned the Stone once in his hand and thought about his smile; twice and he recalled the way his hugs felt. Harry turned it one last time and focused on Sirius’ voice…
Yes. Harry’s first slip-up had been to fall in love with him.
terrible
ways…
Ron stared at him for a moment, then turned his gaze upon his girlfriend. He seemed confused, which Harry thought was completely normal. But then he said, “I, know…?”
“Right. Oh, I’m so happy for you! Who is she? Do I know her?”
Luna’s voice brought him back to reality. “Whatever you decide to do with it will be the right thing to do, Harry, don’t ever doubt that. I know I won’t.” She gave him one last smile before saying, “I think I’m going to go look for Ginny. She deserves to know what a lovely job she did with your party.”
“If this was the other way around, wouldn’t you want him to tell you?”
“Yeah…”
He rushed to get him to stop staring. “Can you get me-?” He’d been about to ask for their strongest liquor, but then remembered he couldn’t do that. He sighed. “Can you get me some water, please?”
Hermione stepped forward and hugged him tightly. “I’m sorry,” she whispered on his ear and he could tell she was crying.
It was nice to have them there, though. And also extremely convenient. For some reason, he’d been feeling absolutely exhausted for the past few weeks; never in a million years would he had been able to do it all on his own.
Harry looked away.
“I’m fine,” he assured his friends.
When the room came back into focus, the first thing he saw were three pairs of extremely concerned eyes. But in all honesty, Harry felt okay, albeit just a little woozy.
Hermione’s eyes were incredibly soft when she spoke. “It is. But it’s a good kind of different, isn’t it?” Her face dropped a little. “I mean, I’m sure Mr. Fortescue would be pleased to know that his shop is still up and running.”
Hermione nodded.
“She’s inside… What’s happened?” His friend stepped aside to let him in.
She smiled up at him. “Incredibly glad to be here.” Her silvery eyes studied him for a few seconds. “Being the birthday boy really suits you. You’re glowing, Harry.”
He felt rather guilty about it, but he was glad it was just the three of them. He
“I’m sure you enjoyed having a normal school year this time.”
The most delightful chuckle Harry had heard came out of the blond boy’s mouth. “I fully intend to pay up, don’t worry.”
Harry shook his head. “I-”
The room fell silent for a moment.
“Every new parent is,” his godfather assured him. “In fact, I would say it’s one of the requirements for becoming an excellent one. You think your parents never had any doubts?”
Yet, Harry took the small object in his hands and immediately felt his perfect plan vanish into thin air. The Stone had found its way back for a reason. And he couldn’t pretend he didn’t know what that reason was…
“Mate, you’re going to see a Healer even if I have to drag you by the ears.”
A single tear escaped from those grey eyes, but they never stopped staring at him.
That’s not going to happen.”
“Yes, Hermione. I’m not into forty-something-year-old men, if that’s what you’re wondering.” Harry still resented Lucius Malfoy, there was no hiding that.
The word alone gave him goosebumps; it was such a surreal thing to think about…
They stayed like that for a while, just savouring the moment.
He was about to reach his seat when he heard a dreamy voice behind him. “Happy Birthday, Harry.”
He thought about the answer to his question. Then he remembered something Malfoy had said:
That earned him a chuckle and Harry’s eyebrows furrowed in confusion.
“What’s the other reason?” Harry looked up at him. “You said ‘the main reason’, so there’s got to be another one, right?”
Still, doing that was
“I don’t mind waiting if he’s tending to other patients.”
“We are.” Harry’s loud voice silenced both of them. “Which leads us to the actual reason why I wanted to talk to you.”
Curiously enough, he didn’t feel nervous at all. The conversation he’d had with Sirius had somehow also been like a simultaneous conversation with himself and now Harry was convinced that, in spite of the result, he was doing the right thing.
“He’ll never return the feeling,” he replied bitterly.
“How could
“But you don’t want it to be like that anymore…” It wasn’t clear to Harry if that was meant to be a question, so he looked into her eyes only for her to continue. “You’re in love with him.”
Harry held his breath as the blond boy picked up the stack of papers, opened the folder, and started reading through the first page. He watched as already pale skin began to further lose colour and the same pair of lips that had been on his a few weeks before, parted slightly in utter confusion.
As he watched her leave, Harry was left alone with his thoughts again. And the idea he was sure was the worst he’d had in months.
“I don’t understand what’s got you so upset,” his godfather spoke again.
“Look, I know you don’t like Malfoy, and I know you don’t approve of this- whatever thing we have going on. But I’ve already decided to keep this baby.” Harry’s tone held more determination than it ever had. “And I came here hoping you’d support that decision.”
He instinctively kissed back, but then gently lowered his head. “Potter…”
“Incendio”
Harry made it to the stairs and sat down on the first step. The night before had been the last night his friends had slept there, and he hadn’t taken the time to pay attention to how silent the house was without them...
She continued after making sure to glare at Ron and Hermione, silencing their giggles. “But yes, I meant that. I have to know the exact number of guests so I can take care of everything else.”
He still knew those plans were not anywhere near to what Malfoy was looking for at the moment, and he still had no idea whether he was actually going to inform him of them. But nothing was going to take away the joy Harry was suddenly flooded with.
“I’ve already invited-”
Harry accepted it gladly and immediately detected the smell of peppermint. “So much better, thank you.”
-.-.-.-.-.-.-
. It had nothing peculiar; just an engraved letter “D” and the smallest emerald beside it. Yet that plain “D” carried a special meaning for Harry. It stood for
Harry had never felt more uncomfortable and vulnerable in the presence of his best friend. He didn’t like that feeling. “I don’t know how I feel about him. It’s not like it matters anyway.”
He laughed bitterly. “And say what?
He followed his friends to a large group who was chatting away excitedly. The room erupted into a fit of cheers as soon as they saw Harry trailing behind and he smiled sincerely, feeling grateful to have so many people who were happy to celebrate with him. He almost forgot about the one person who wasn’t there and should have been.
Malfoy looked into his eyes. “Yes. What good do you think
The redhead eyed them curiously, but got up anyway. “Okay… But it’s going to take some time, look at that queue.”
“Harry, you have to talk to him.”
He nodded as he felt tears forming in his eyes once again. “Thank you, Sirius.”
Draco placed a single hand a few centimetres away from Harry’s abdomen. He felt a subtle tickling accompanied by a warm sensation and stood still, letting the expert work his magic on him.
-.-.-.-.-.-.-
Sirius broke it with a gentle laugh. “Who would have thought? You’re technically carrying the rightful heir of the House of Black. The
“Actually, we don’t know that, Hermione.” Harry was now beginning to get worried and his voice showed it. “We can’t know.”
According to legend, Cadmus Peverell had lost his mind as a consequence of abusing the Stone’s power. And if Harry was going to be raising his child on his own, then his sanity was worth now more than ever.
She nodded as if what she had just said made complete sense. “Remember what I told you about our things coming back to us?”
Malfoy looked up at him, silently asking the million questions that he couldn’t voice at the moment. Harry managed to understand and answer all of them with a simple nod.
Neither Harry nor Hermione said anything.
He turned around and was met with a familiar pretty face that also happened to be one of the few he was really looking forward to seeing that day. “Luna! Thanks, how are you?”
So, taking a deep, shaky breath, he closed his eyes and just thought about
He climbed the stairs towards his bedroom clinging tightly onto it as he gave everything one last thought. His parents crossed his mind at some point, but Harry knew deep within they would both support him no matter what choice he made. This time, it was not them whom he needed to talk to.
Harry loved how excited she was over the whole thing. When she had first brought it out, he wasn’t particularly enthusiastic about the idea. But he knew it made her happy, so he was happy as well. He was just so thankful that they had managed to remain friends after the breakup; Ginny was one of the most important people in Harry’s life.
He nodded his head. “You still owe me a birthday celebration.”
happen, that much was clear to Harry. For now, he just had to make sure that that someone wouldn’t be him.
Harry knew he could just use a couple of Pack and Scouring Charms, or perhaps ask Kreacher to do all the cleaning for him, but he felt it was something he had to do wholeheartedly. He owed Sirius at least that. And now that Ginny had been planning to throw a party for him there, he’d ran out of excuses for putting it off.
He might not ever know Potter’s love, but Draco could love him tonight. He could show him how it felt to be worshipped not for the pieces of a destiny you’d followed but for who you
“You read my journal.”
Harry was surprised so many of them had returned—it was almost like eighth year all over again. Except, eighth year had passed in something like a haze: too many people had still been in mourning clothes, their eyes red-rimmed each day at breakfast. Harry wasn’t sure how he passed his exams; he couldn’t remember much about the year at all. He thought Malfoy had tried to speak to him once or twice, but Harry had told him to piss off, and Malfoy had gone, just like that.
“I don’t know about that. I had reservations from the start and I still went ahead with it.” He gave a wry smile. “Can’t blame you for being an idiot; we’ve known that for years.”
The conversation moved on and Draco let it. They had several glorious minutes of Quidditch chat while Draco’s heart rate returned to normal, but just as he was really relaxing, everything came crashing down.
He shuddered. “Yes.”
The rumbling was growing louder, but Draco shoved it aside as he pulled Potter closer, desperate to taste and feel as much of him as he possibly could in this moment, before everything fell apart. He had thought Potter would feel rough against him—all the roughness of motorbike leather and the gravel of his voice had given him the impression of someone who was all harsh edges, like he wouldn’t be able to hold onto him too long without getting cut. But apart from his stubble, Potter was smooth, so smooth, and he moulded instantly to Draco like he couldn’t get enough of him.
, to do, to be, in a way that he hadn’t ever before. He felt that, and he felt something else too. He had an awareness of the need to slow down, to listen, to feel.
prepared?”
Malfoy’s relieved exhalation was barely audible, but Harry heard it all the same.
“Ready?”
“We—that was—I mean—” he spluttered as Harry picked his jaw up off the ground for the second time that afternoon and Neville half-laughed and nervous-gasped at the same time, nearly choking on his tongue.
Dearest Harry,
“Could something have gone wrong?”
“We said we need to trust each other, remember?” Draco snapped. “We can’t be fighting, or the curse can take advantage of our weaknesses.”
The room was silent, filled only with the sound of gently whirring gears as they ticked steadily around.
It was the girl who had looked sick. She noticed her mum pointing and gave a timid little wave. Draco made sure to wave back.
Draco sat bolt upright on the couch. Potter had yet to awaken, stirring restlessly in his sleep.
Draco laughed, remembering the punch from third year with no small amount of discomfort. “Well, shall we return to the party?”
While Potter was busy giving orders and securing the area, Draco wrapped the package in several layers of charms and vanished it to his workroom where he knew it would be safe. He didn’t need to unwrap it this time; the explosion had taken care of that. The box was exactly the same as the first one, right down to the faint design of leaves along the border. It didn’t make sense. Why send the recipient to sleep before they could open the box?
With a sharp crack, he Disapparated, leaving Draco alone with a very uncomfortable problem.
A noise by the doorway made him look up. He nearly spilled his coffee when he realised the nurse was standing there. He lurched to his feet and stumbled forward.
“Oh,” Harry moaned, drawing it out nearly the full length of time it took Draco to press all the way inside.
Slowly, Harry tuned back into his surroundings and realised he had been staring at his hands for a very long time. The air was oddly silent, like even the birds had left for a while. He could almost hear the scratching of Malfoy’s quill as he worked all the way at the other end of the corridor.
“I didn’t know soulmates felt like this,” Draco confessed once they’d pulled back from each other, still with his forehead pressed against Harry’s, the warm rush of their breath dancing across his skin.
Then, he took Malfoy’s hand and Apparated them onto the roof.
The dark magic spilling out of Hogwarts had already spread as far as London, and they were still no closer to finding its source. The school had been closed for a week, and the air of doom and unhappiness stank out the walls.
It was why Draco had begun this peacock sanctuary. He was giving back in the only way he knew how, the only way the world would accept from him: by caring for, amongst others, the magical flock that had cared for his family for centuries. By making amends for the shit-awful way his family had used that gift. By trying, desperately, to say sorry.
Malfoy turned his head a degree toward Harry, but didn’t say anything in response. It was clear he was listening, though, so with only a little awkwardness, Harry suffered on in finding the right words.
“Faint orange hue to the catalyst.” Draco pointed at the parcel. “Explosion sounded like it went off in an anechoic chamber. Faint taste of sulphur in the air. It’s a standard curse, Potter. He’ll be all right.”
Malfoy gasped then, and the pure delight in the sound had Harry coming, coming all over his fingers and shirt while Malfoy watched, his eyes dark in the moonlight.
The redheaded boy who had been desperately trying to levitate his broom was eagerly helping Emily with her commands. Squibs tended to vary for how well the brooms responded to verbal commands, and it seemed Emily was one who would have to control it on her own. As he watched, the redheaded boy widened his stance, held his hands out dramatically with Emily’s hands hovering in the air above his, and yelled “UP!” so loudly that they could hear it from the stands.
The lad hanging off his shoulder grins at him and punches him jovially in the shoulder, increasing the volume of his chant. Thankfully, before Harry can decide whether or not joining in on the chant crosses a line in his morals, the man finishes chugging the beer and drops the shoe onto the sand.
The instinct to take the words back immediately was almost overwhelmingly impossible to beat back, but he didn’t. He’d said the words now, and even as he cursed himself internally and felt petrified by fear, they were out there and he wasn’t going to take them back.
“You actually care.” Her tone was accusatory.
“One has to ask. I recall how you ate at Hogwarts.”
Before he was ready for it to, the hallway ended and they were walking through the gilded library.
The lube was incredibly messy as he smeared it around Malfoy’s entrance. He avoided touching the furl at first, drawing rings around it to try to accustom both Malfoy and himself to the feeling of it.
He sent the bottle floating over and forced a smile, despite his reservations.
“Holy hell,” Draco breathed, and then his body kicked into action, flinging out his wand towards Morgan so that jet-black ropes suddenly bound her where she stood without him having to even think it.
“Any attempt has
“No you didn’t.”
into his tone as possible, “and it’s not a curse. They should have someone else. Someone who can actually help.”
“No need to be a twat about it.”
“I don’t know.”
“I didn’t mean to act like you weren’t wanted.”
Draco laughed, forcing it to come out louder and more certain than he felt. “I guess Unspeakables don’t know everything then, do they?”
“Start with the good. My head hurts too much for bad news just yet.”
Draco recalled the conversation, and Weasley’s insistence that Potter could prove he was better than the Unseen Hand—presumably of Fate—and wondered whether that meant Potter wanted to fight the prophecy or change it back to what it was. What would it mean for Draco if he did either?
Draco knows he likes lasagne. It’s Harry’s favourite food, just like Draco’s favourite food is filet mignon; they laugh about it all the time. It’s like the perfect representation of the two of them. They are so opposing in their tastes that no one in their right mind would have thought they would work out. And yet here they are; or at least, so Harry had thought.
“Skeeter thinks the two of you are dating!” Weasley finally spat out, shoving the paper across the table to them and then joining Granger on the floor.
A hex that pushed them to the heights of their emotion—rage, fury—and then froze them when they did.
“I know this is all fun and games to you, but it’s no wonder they were pissing themselves laughing the other night.” He jabbed a finger at their friends, before turning immediately back to Draco. “You have no respect for anyone but yourself. How could you possibly pull off a functional relationship?”
“Potter, if you are for one second implying that I am difficult to manage, then I’ll thank you to recall just the other week when we evacuated these very premises at what can only be described as emergency level haste, for the express purpose of avoiding your confrontation with a past beau.” Draco sneered.
“You do,” Harry mumbled into his mouth, but he wasn’t sure that Draco heard him.
“Did you want to stay for the kick off?” Harry asked, smiling up at him. “Or is this just a quick visit?”
“Find anything?” he asked, leaning back against the desk and shoving his hands in his pockets.
He sounded hesitant, but he looked surprised. Harry’s heart clenched painfully.
. Was Potter acknowledging that there was something between the two of them? Or did he have some kind of warped sense of work-place bonding?
He focuses on his tea while Draco scans the paper, confused and unsure why Harry is so upset. It’s hard to explain, even now. It’s only a photo after all, and like Draco says, it’s a good one. He looks commanding, intimidating even, but also happy. Privately, he would admit that it is probably an accurate representation for once, but that’s exactly the problem.
“Here, Potter,” Draco said, reaching for the drinks. “I’ll get yours.”
Potter scoffed. “I don’t have a Time-Turner, Ron. I can’t change the past.”
“Oh, I wouldn’t!” Granger’s eyes widened in shock, and Weasley shook his head furiously.
The insistent sound of rhythmic chanting penetrates Harry’s thoughts, breaking through the fog of his lethargy and sending prickles of irritation down his spine.
“It isn’t
He stretched his claws into the wind, opened his beak, and screeched.
“Wouldn’t that be nice,” he muttered, and this time there was no doubt that Harry wasn’t meant to hear it.
“Absolutely not,” he gasped. “I know you, Harry Potter: you’re a fucking tease.”
Blaise snorted. “It’s always about Potter.”
Which, as Potter had said, sort of made Pansy’s suggestion to hand him over to Voldemort the smartest. But everyone had been crying too much by then to give that thought much response.
He found himself outside her office, and then before he knew it he was knocking on the closed door and entering before he’d had the chance to be refused.
He felt Potter melt back against him, and then he was turning, and Draco was pushing him back against the bench and kissing him.
She smiled at him—one of her rare, genuine smiles that lit up her entire face.
to,” Morgan protested, rolling her eyes. “He’s just hard to pin down.”
“Come on, Potter,” Draco breathed, his voice a little shaky. “You’re all over the place tonight. Are you sure this is a good idea?”
Potter’s eyes darkened, his tongue darting out to wet his lips. “I’ll see you soon,” he murmured then disappeared.
Perhaps, though, it had at least lifted the curse.
“Absolutely,” Draco said smoothly.
Suddenly, Potter drew back, a look of pure irritation on his face. “You
