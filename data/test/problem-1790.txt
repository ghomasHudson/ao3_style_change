I would be lying if I said that it wasn’t one of the best mornings of my life waking up like that. But only before the reality of our situation came back to me, but it was still a great experience. Unbidden the thought came to my mind that this is how I want to wake up for the rest of my life. As soon as I thought that, I blushed and tried to shake it off, despite smiling softly down at Draco’s peaceful face.
“Do you think he’s ready for that?” I ask, as I watch Draco fight with the heavy door to the riding hall.
“It’s not bad news per say,” she fiddles with her cup, “Just… They refuse to continue without a statement of the victim,” she makes air-quotes around the last word.
“If he keeps that up for one round we could try moving towards the next step, since he obviously knows the basics of riding even in his subconsciousness,” Andrea is breathing a bit harder because Draco keeps on urging Shenan faster and she has to keep up.
I wonder, what you would do if you knew. Would you curse me or would you try to make friends again? I will never find out I guess. I replaced your memories with false ones, so you will never remember. Hah, there is one more thing. I am sure you would flip if you knew that one. Our night was not without consequences even after I erased your memory. You might not know it but in the magical world everyone can carry children no matter what gender.
I saw you today. Nearly twelve years have passed since that night. You defeated Voldemort like was your fate. You married Ginny Weasley like everyone expected from you. You are a DADA teacher at Hogwarts now. I bet that was a shock for everyone, I bet they all expected you to become an auror. For once you didn’t do what they wanted, I am so proud of you. Joking. I haven’t seen you for years. Since the trials to be correct.
That’s what has me stumbling out of the floo in Andromeda’s house this Friday afternoon. She is already waiting for me, soft smile on her face.
He only blinks up at me. As he doesn’t move of his own accord, I carefully tug at his hand. Slow but obediently he sits up and swings his legs over the side of the mattress. His eyes are focused straight ahead again, seeing nothing or at least something I can’t see. Slipping an arm around the thin waist I slowly lift him on his feet. His legs aren’t strong enough to keep him up on their own, but with my support, he is at least able to walk. Our movement is slow and it takes way more time than I would alone to reach the small sitting room on the same floor. I don’t want to make him walk down two stories to the kitchen in the basement, so we are eating up here. Once there, I carefully lower him into one of the armchairs standing around a small table. He slumps into it, body not holding him upright properly, and with the tiniest twitch around his mouth, presses into the soft material. I summon the food already prepared in the kitchen and actually get some reaction from Draco. When the food appears on the table, he turns his head towards the smell. His expression gets a hint wistful.
It’s two days later when I really hear him speak for the first time. After a day spent mostly in the backyard, reading and playing with Dragon, Draco is tired. As usual I bring him to bed like you would do with a small child (I don’t read him a bedtime story though, he usually does that by himself). After pulling the covers over him, he starts to make sounds in the back of his throat and I realise that his stuffed dragon is still laying on the other side of the room. I stroke his hair and summon the thing, earning me a contented sigh from him.
“Better a mute toddler than comatose,” she sighs, but kneels next to me to hold Draco’s right arm still, “It’s quite nice to watch how he’s progressing, even though it’s still far from what we want to achieve in the end,” she chuckles, “And until then you have to take care of a six feet tall toddler. No problem, right? I mean you took care of Teddy didn’t you?”
“Yes,” I sigh, conceding to his point, “But your motions are practiced, like you have done it countless times before. That means you did it by hand back then too.”
“His name is Orion Malfoy. He’s Draco Malfoy’s son, didn’t you know? No one knows who his mother is though. Why are you asking?” she repeats getting confused over my behaviour.
As soon as I keel down in front of it, the flames flare higher and form the woman’s face. I smile, “Andromeda. Long time no see.”
Returning to Draco, I kneel in front of the blonde. Dragon wriggles in my arms. I put a hand on the other boy’s. Grey eyes blink once.
“Yeah, like in the year between Easter in our 6th year at Hogwarts and the final battle,” our gazes meet, shocked and disgusted.
As for the things Harry said, this is my personal opinion on what happened in canon or could have happened, and not everyone's as I'm perfectly aware.
At last even Draco’s birth certificate. The official one. And suddenly I forget how to breathe as I read the official name of the child (they really have a fable for long names).
I shake my head, “It’s hard. He is broken, so little like the boy I know from school. I want nothing more than to give him his life back, but it’s still very far in the future,” then I look her in the eyes, “But it doesn’t matter, I will be strong for him. I will manage, don’t worry, Hermione. Now let’s look at these lists.”
I sigh, summoning the toy, “Your clear moment is over I guess,” the animal garners a happy hum from him and I stroke his head sadly, “Let’s hope we can lengthen that next time. Still, it was nice to see the old you for a few seconds,” a blonde head pushes against his hand, he shakes his head, “Not that you are not cute like this, but for you to live out there again, we need your old, annoying self back.”
As far as I can see, the blonde doesn’t show the least bit of discomfort and the horses are keeping enough distance, so I’m not really worried.
“That’s true,” I relax in her presence and serenity, “But won’t people complain about your sudden change of direction?”
It was about one month after our night that I started to feel badly. I suspected what it was but prayed that it wasn’t. Another month later I managed to convince myself to finally get myself tested. I went to the only person I knew I could trust, my godfather. Sev is the only one who knows everything. I told him about the mission Voldemort gave me, about our night and my suspicion. He confirmed it. And he helped me, he is hiding it for me. But that is only going to work for so long. I am wearing glamour spells the whole time, but illusions can’t hide something like this forever when you stand in front of Lord Voldemort. Severus is going to pretend I am sick starting in about two and a half months. I am just going to disappear when the time comes. Hopefully I can return when Voldemort is defeated.
But unfortunately all her fast movement has only cause Draco to tense again and take a step back. Automatically he clutches Teddy tighter. Whether that is to protect the little boy or because he himself needs something to hold on, I don’t know. I get up to, but slower as Andromeda is frozen in place after seeing her nephew’s reaction. I lift my hands.
She squirms uncomfortably, “Tilly is not at liberty to say. However Master Potter is a very good man. Yes, Tilly disobeyed Master Lucius and brought food to the prisoners.”
“Of course,” I agree to stop her from releasing a rant on me, “But I am talking more about the abuse Narcissa’s diary spoke of. I read up a bit on domestic abuse since I got that information and in my opinion that is one of the worst things you can do to someone. Hurting a stranger or in anger is something else than purposefully abusing someone who trusts you.”
Michael nods and he waves behind us as we finally leave the prison. Outside Draco shows a proper reaction for the first time. That crooked smile reappears on his face and he stretches towards the sun in a longing movement. Hermione and I exchange a sad smile then she apparates us back to Grimmauld place while I hold Draco steady. He doesn’t even react to the feeling of apparition. I sigh as I stroke his dirty hair. She drifts off to the living room while I help (more or less carry) the blonde upstairs into a bedroom I had Kreacher prepare before I departed for the ministry. When I lay him down onto the bed, he gives me a last one of those crooked smiles before his empty eyes drift closed. I stroke his gaunt and sickly face a last time before I leave the room to join Hermione.
Immediately he stiffens, fingers digging too hard into his left forearm, “Are they asking whether I started spying before I was marked or after? Because I was marked during the holidays between fifth and sixth year, but I was already working with Severus before that,” he grounds out.
My heart clenches again. He is so far gone in his memories that he mistakes me for Narcissa, his mother. Ignoring that I pull him close nonetheless to give him the comfort he needs. After a few minutes of unintelligent mumbling which sound like those of a small child, his voice becomes clearer, more like the mental child in the adult body he currently is.
“No, it’s just…” I scratch the back of my head, pulling the sheets out of my bag, “Have you ever heard the name ‘Spy A’ during your time in the Order?”
“The wards were decreased to not keep people out anymore but only send an alarm to the ministry should someone enter without permission about a month ago,” she explains.
“I figured as much. It’s his handwriting after all,” I agree, “Maybe you know who had the most information from the death eater ranks after his death.”
“I don’t think it would have been a good idea,” Hermione shakes his head, “Yes, you might have prevented him from getting out today, but you would have locked him up. Even if it is for his own good, he would have seen it as just another prison. If he tried to get out to today only to realise he was locked in, you would have lost a big part of the trust you have worked so hard to gain.”
“I don’t know,” I shrug, “He doesn’t let me comfort him anymore. Whenever I try he just pushes me away or even gets aggressive.”
“Okay, let’s introduce our new guest to him,” I smile, strange excitement cursing through my veins. As I walk past Hermione, I stroke a finger over Dragon’s head, “And you be good for him, alright?”
And if I am honest I miss the fights I had with Malfoy. His retorts, no matter how insulting, and the flashing of his grey eyes. But he isn’t at Hogwarts, rather he is rotting in Azkaban for crimes he didn’t commit. I haven’t given up on getting him out of the prison, but I haven’t gotten any further either. Neither is there any progress on the matter of Spy A. I have looked through any material the Order had but couldn’t find anything. Also school caught up with me. Only because Snape is not here anymore doesn’t make it any easier. With schoolwork, Quidditch and friends there is little time to ponder over mysterious men. I am already getting teased about having some unknown girlfriend (or boyfriend according to Seamus).
He nods and turns away from me. I do the same and somehow manage to get back to Grimmauld Place without falling asleep. Hermione welcomes me in the front hallway.
“You have never been horse riding have you?” she seems amused when I shake my head, “You control the horse with your legs and by shifting your weight. Most people use a ring around the horse’s neck when they’re riding without any bridle which helps. But of course you need to be very good at riding in general and have to trust the horse completely.”
“That would be good, yes. Maybe also a horse with a lighter colour. He’s seen god knows enough darkness. A patient animal but one who sometimes initiates contact by themselves?” I just ramble of what comes to my mind.
A minuscule furrow appears on his brow then he lifts his right hand again, the left laying still as always. Then he slowly taps his own chest. I frown confusedly as well.
Hermione waves her wand in the air next to me, Draco stiffening in response at the other side of the table. She throws him an apologetic look which he ignores. A new paper appears on the table and after another spell, the quill on it is poised to record what Draco is going to say.
“Kari?” I repeat with the same confusion, using his distraction to pull him further to our goal, “Who is she?”
The next few chapters are a bit horse heavy, because at the time I was writing them, I was severly missing riding myself.
She chuckles, “Of course. A determined boy who loves him and would give everything to finally allow him to live the life he ever wanted and never could have before.”
I teach your son for about two months until my curiosity gets the better of me. I constantly feel the urge to talk to him. Is it because he is your son? I never managed to get myself to stop talking to (or about) you, no matter how much we fought. So one day when he stays after the lesson to ask some more questions about our current subject I lead the conversation to the topic of his family.
“At least they are labelled,” I hear Draco mumble as he scans the names pinned to the wood stands under the horse gear.
“Be quiet,” I just know my cheeks are bright red, “You sound like some cheesy romance novel. And I’m not in love with him.”
“Has Dumbledore ever spoken to you about another source of information from Voldemort’s army, apart from Snape?”
Eventually he is sleeping and as calm as he can get, no matter how much it pains me to have to force it on him again. Carefully I lift him up into my arms. He is still scarily light. Ignoring the pushing against my wards I carry the unconscious boy back to his room and settle him into bed, softly tucking him in. He breathes a sigh of relief when the blanket settles around him and I press the stuffed dragon we left in the library into his arms. I stroke his hair and kiss his forehead before I leave him. Not before putting two charms around his room though. One to shield him from any sounds coming from the outside and the other to alert me should something change in his state.
I ponder for a moment, “It would be best if there are as few people as possible. Like I said, he is still extremely wary of any strangers.”
“I wouldn’t advise it, but if you think he is alright…” he stares at the horses, “You know him much better than I do.”
“Oh god,” I cry, burying my face in his hair, no matter how awful he smells, “I should have never let you go in there. It was so wrong. I don’t even want to imagine what they did to you there.”
Luckily Draco is out enough so that the track home goes by without complications. He is completely asleep when we arrive back at Grimmauld Place. I put him in bed, changing his clothes and cleaning him up magically. Hermione has made tea by the time I return to the living room. She smiles at me, when I let myself fall down onto the sofa opposite her.
Still shaken from my own nightmare I don’t remember how bad an idea touching him is until it is too late. As soon as I lay a hand on his shoulder, he screams, shooting up straight in bed. Panicked grey eyes skit around the room, not even seeing me. The first thing that comes to my mind to calm him down is Dragon, so I hurriedly look around the room for the little cat. For once I am glad that I could never teach the animal to sleep anywhere else but Draco’s bed. But my search turns up empty. So out of panic with a screaming Draco in the room, I simply summon the protesting cat wandlessly. Ignoring the meows, I put the warm creature in Draco’s lap. The animal blinks for a moment, then seems to notice the blonde’s panicked behaviour, he immediately starts purring and pressing himself against pale skin.
“I think the only one who really knows can’t answer you right now,” she answers pained, “What do you plan to do now?”
Your father gets the kiss, no one could have stopped that, not even me. You don’t seem all that sad about it either and watch with an impassive face as the judgement falls. Narzissa is a different case though. Her mental health had been getting worse ever since you disappeared back then. By now she is something between insane and not aware of the world. She gets sent to St. Mungos for lifetime. This time I see emotion flitter over your face, but I can’t tell what it is exactly.
Hermione, who is living there as well until she can restore her parents’ memories, hugs me as soon as I enter, talking about something she read. I smile as she releases me and we walk inside. I nod and mumble at the appropriate places, having long learned the skill of just tuning out during her lectures while still pretending to listen. My thoughts are still focused mostly on that new spy I read about. Nearly the whole Weasley family is waiting in the kitchen.
“Draco can’t stand in court,” I say immediately, “He can barely go to a muggle café. There is no way I am dragging him to the Ministry to have him stand in the middle of the courtroom, like he is being sentenced to Azkaban all over again.”
I smile, deactivate the charm and continue to follow him. Let him have his moments with Shenan and I will wait patiently for the first words he will actually say to me. As long as he is making his progress. Andrea calls us into the middle a few minutes later and the session continues as usual, with the exception of Draco’s mumbled words to the mare later in the stable.
Another deep breath, I nearly forgot how he gets under my skin, “Stop going off topic. I’m not stupid and you know that, but that’s neither here nor there,” I lift my eyes to stare into his desperately defiant grey orbs, “I will not fight with you, Draco. The war is over, we’re not on opposite sides anymore.”
“You will be fine,” I insist, “You will recover. I know you are strong enough. You can live a normal life – “
Do you know I slept with a male once? Why am I even telling you that? Anyway, I got drunk at the Leaking Cauldron and one of the guys tried to hit on me. Not that I resisted so I went to a different club with him. To dance and drink some more. There (half-drunk) I even voluntarily flirted with other men. Didn’t feel bad at all if I’m honest. Until the one I then slept with. You can guess what hair and eye colour he had. Light blond and ice blue. I am seeing a pattern here. Ginny doesn’t know and it is to stay that way.
“Bad,” her bright eyes are uncharacteristically hard, “I-I… It was a shock when I saw him first. He looks like ghost.”
“Let’s go straight to Kingsley. I am sure we have made so many requests to every other place that none of them will so much as lend us an ear. Besides the minister of magic is still the person who can get the order to let Draco out of Azkaban signed and done the fastest.” I can only nod while she continues, “And thanks to you, we can even go straight to him without booking an appointment first. Sometimes your saviour’s fame can be pretty useful.”
“Yeah, the Ministry insists on informing them why they are taking the houses back, even though it’s not protocol. So when they hear that the property is going back to a Malfoy…” she trails off.
“I agree,” she frowns, “Right now, giving a well-known Death Eater an Order might create unrest and that’s the last thing we need. I will be content when his properties have been returned and I can get compensation for his suffering.”
I give her a thankful nod and leave the kitchen. Once I arrive in front of Draco’s room I take a deep breath as I do each morning and give a tentative knock on the door. Of course there is no reaction so I open the door on my own. Again the blonde seems to be awake already. He doesn’t seem to sleep much during the night but exhausts very easily in the day. But I also know that I have neither the time nor the strength to watch over him each night as well, so for now I will have to settle with making sure he is comfortable during the day and we can tackle his sleeping problems when he has started to recover. Shaking off these thoughts I wander over to the bed and kneel down, hand running through blond strands.
“Well, I had to shoot a spell at him to put him asleep. Since then he is calm yeah, but I wouldn’t call him okay.”
“The usual arguments to drag the process out until evidence for my guilt can finally be found,” Draco throws in from the other side of the table.
“I totally agree,” a real smile comes back to my face as I put the memory back into the vial, “We have to get to the ministry as fast as we can.”
Fate seems to hate me however, because like in our school times our ways cross each other permanently on coincidence. This time it’s Diagon Alley. Lou and I are just returning home from work. Orion’s still at school, but as a teacher you can leave whenever you want.
“Barely,” he snorts self-deprecatingly, “It took a lot of effort to get to the side of the street. And my legs still don’t move.”
“I promise I will take care of you as good as I can,” I mumble and can feel Draco’s body vibrate with a soft laugh.
“Uhm Draco, not to interrupt. But are you sure you should be taking a normal saddle? You haven’t used one before,” I ask him cautiously. He throws me a disdainful, unbelieving look and I amend, “Alright, maybe you used to. But a lot of things changed since then,” he rolls his eyes and turns away, “Draco, please. I’m worried.”
As his right hand goes up to settle against my neck, I close my eyes and let myself enjoy his closeness. If I had looked up, I would have seen Hermione stare at us with a knowing look.
She shrugs with a sad smile, “You were someone he trusted and I feel like he would have wanted it like that.”
What follows is a relaxing afternoon of conversation. We try to avoid trickier subjects like Draco, the war or politics. I keep my magic half-way focused on the wards around Draco, more for Andromeda’s sake than mine. But there is nothing worrying. The spells register nothing more than Draco’s usual mood swings, which are harmless. I notice that he was very tense at the beginning, totally untrusting of little Teddy and the current happenings, but he relaxed over time as the toddler proved to be no danger at all. I can’t say whether he enjoyed playing with the little boy but he certainly seems as peaceful as he gets these days.
“Most people would disagree with you,” he glares, “After all I deserved what I got for my crimes did I not?”
“You will get your life back,” I murmur into the blond strands, “And you will have a better life than you could have ever had under your parents’ rule,” carefully I clutch him closer, feeling a bony hand clench in my coat, “I swear that to you.”
I pull a sad face, “Be that as it may, I focus on the fact that I am helping him. And that he’s getting better.”
Her pinched face at that tells me enough, I burrow my face in my hands, “I can’t keep every single object away from him.”
“Unfortunately I don’t know anything. But this came through the fireplace one day. It had an urgency marking on it and when I showed it to Remus he cursed and flooed away immediately. When he came back he told me to destroy it but at the time I thought I had misplaced it so it survived until now,” she explains hurriedly, handing me the paper and taking Teddy back into her arms, “I think that could perhaps be useful to you.”
“I told you it was bad,” she agrees, “How is the rest working out? Did you find something to give him?”
Ginny isn’t very receptive about such rumours. Despite the fact that we are not together. But she seems to have problems understanding that. No matter how many times I told her that we aren’t, she just tries again. And I do not appreciate it when I am buried in some Order stuff to find out something about Spy A and she suddenly drapes herself over my lap. In these moments I am so glad that we don’t live in the Gryffindor tower anymore and have our own common room. And my single room. Still her favourite hobby nowadays seems to be following me around. How annoying.
I wave it off, “There are so many diagnostic and protective spells around Draco I would notice anything that went wrong. Not to mention that Draco is the one more likely to freak out of the two. Teddy is safe with him, he would never voluntarily hurt him.”
I nod eagerly, “There is a passage in those papers where the spy speaks of taking care of the prisoners in Malfoy Manor. With Luna’s help I found the house elf who supplied them with food and blankets. And just an hour ago I got this memory from said house elf,” I say, holding the vial out to the man, “It clearly shows Draco giving the order that she has to make sure the prisoners stay well.”
But before I can turn back to my book, his singing suddenly breaks off and a sharp voice a lot like the one I knew from Hogwarts sounds, “No, you aren’t Dhalia. She was black and – “ a break in his speech has me on my feet immediately and on my way to the other door, “Where am I?” he asks just before I can pull it open.
I stare down at my coffee, “I don’t know. If he’s clear he should be able to, but it might trigger memories we don’t want him to relive.”
“Hey, Draco,” his eyes get slightly more focused but he doesn’t move, “I’m back,” he just blinks, “And I brought you something. Rather someone who wants to meet you, okay?” he blinks but does nothing more, “Is it alright if I take your dragon for a moment?”
Andrea is still busy with her last patient so I guide the other boy to Shenan, who is already reaching her head out towards him. The moment he is within range, she pushes her nose against his cheek, whinnying lowly. One pale hand comes up and strokes the light fur. He turns his head to bury it into the animal’s warm neck.
It also made me think about another possibility for Orion’s parentage. His ‘mother’ could have been a male too. It could have even been you yourself. That would at least explain your sudden disappearance. The time fit. Granted I already suspected that you left to be with whoever carried Orion. Still if I assume you carried him (which sends one hell of a painful stab through my chest), you must have slept with another male. Enough of a shame to run away and hide the child from everyone? But you love him I could see that at the station and in his behaviour, so not a shame. Besides Orion always talks about his ‘mother’, not ‘father’ or ‘other father’. So there was a woman. Who? I want to know. I care. Will you ever know how much I care for you?
“Because he is referenced as male often enough in these reports, but I don’t know any more than his gender. And that he was a death eater. A marked one somewhere in Voldemort’s higher ranks if I’m correct,” I explain.
But apparently it was the wrong question as he only narrows his eyes and taps his chest again. As I only look at him confused, he stares at me. Then he stretches his hand again and does something that could vaguely be interpreted as pointing of fingers. His fingers again splay over the dragon’s form, then again points at his own chest, the movement from the animal to himself a bit faster than usual which visibly needs focus from him. I frown until a sad idea comes to my mind.
“What do you mean?” I ask as I lift my head back up, cheeks burning red at the thought of Malfoy as my lover.
Now to you and your wife. First I guess I have to say sorry to Lou for being angry at her all this time. I stole my own chances at being with you, not she. She just looked after you when you needed someone to be there. I wasn’t, she was. And she did great with Orion, our son, and your own child. You chose her well. I also have to thank her for taking care of you. But I can talk to her after I am finished with you. I will say everything I never could while you were still alive. I am not going to forgive you easily for never telling me the truth, but that’s not the most important thing. It is that you finally learn how much I care for you. That I want to be with you.
“I know,” she sighs, nervously twirling her spoon in her cup, “It’s just… You looked so happy when you told me that Draco spoke,” a snort, “You are even looking at him like you are somewhere lost on cloud nine right now.”
“How is your father, Orion?” I try to be unsuspicious (I guess I fail; but I don’t really care, I want to know what you are doing these days).
Just yesterday Hermione suggested we could take the next step. Start with living beings. It has been almost three weeks since we gave Draco the stuffed dragon and he took well to it, so it’s time to try the cat.
“Ah no,” I shake my head, “It’s not about what they look like. But certain character traits are indispensable for me. Unfortunately I can’t tell that by simply looking at the cats.”
Carefully I coax Draco through. The woman takes a respectful distance but he is shying away nonetheless. Hermione follows us and thanks the stranger tensely before focusing back on us. But she knows better than to touch Draco right now. In such an anxious state he could react negatively to any touch. Luckily, the horses once again work like a charm and some tension leaves his frame.
We exchange a look. We may have gotten Draco free from Azkaban now. But the harder part is yet to come. We have to help a man, maybe broken beyond repair back to himself.
“I am taking you out of the house if that’s what you really want. But you will have to let me choose the place because you can’t be anywhere too crowded or dangerous.”
But to my surprise he blanches and Dragon screeches again at the tight hold, “Not aunt,” he whimpers, “Please not aunt. I didn’t do anything w-wrong.”
“Piss off, you git!” Oh, how you annoy me, but on the other hand you always get under my skin so much faster than anyone else.
“Hm,” I mumble, “I don’t know. I always felt that they somehow loved me for the fact that I am Harry Potter, the wizarding world’s saviour. At least partly. I don’t want that. I want someone who sees me as Harry and only Harry.”
I wanted to update one more time before I drive myself insane again over my grades for this semester (coming up on the website this friday, yay...).
I smile, “Because now I can see the world clearly instead of through the black and white screen I employed when I was younger. The Weasleys and Hagrid were the first people who accepted me and you insulted them all. I was impressionable,” I shrug, “Maybe if you would have been the one to sit with me on the train, you would have been my friend and not Ron.”
“Yes, but that wasn’t everything,” I sigh, “He thinks he deserves to be punished for what he did during the war.”
“Technically yes,” Hermione sighs and I bite my lip, “But I am sure that I will be able to argue in court that some of the questions are unreasonable. But he needs to answer all the unmarked ones. I think you can leave the red ones out or maybe try the easier ones,” she averts her eyes from my gaze, “I don’t like to put him through it, but try to get him to answer as many questions as possible, even the red ones.”
Not sure when I will post the next time because despite having holidays I need to go to work and move to a different appartment too.
“No, it’s fine,” he smiles, the same fake smile you have perfected, “I have to get to potions now. See you on Friday for the next lesson, Professor Potter.”
Yelling insults at each other. That’s our daily business. That’s all we do. That’s what we are supposed to do. The boy-who-lived and the son of the best known death eater family. We are not allowed to be anything but enemies. And that’s how it always been since you refused my friendship on our first day here at Hogwarts.
“Draco?” I am now running through the house, opening room after room. Dragon is keeping at my heels as good as the small cat can. But no matter where I go, he isn’t here. A tracing spell for him comes up empty. I come to the horrified realisation that Draco is not in the house anymore, he’s gone. Where I have no idea.
He doesn’t respond, so I move slowly. When I do touch him it earns little reaction. I start slowly massaging the tense muscles.
“Mr. Potter. What are you doing here? We didn’t know you were coming to visit someone today,” one of them says urgently.
I know you saw me and you saw Orion. Will you recognize your own eyes when he’s sitting in your class? I hope not. As far as he knows, his other parent is dead. That they died a hero, but Orion knows he should not speak about both of his parents. I am still not really accepted in this society and I thought long whether to send my son to Hogwarts instead of a different school, but it seemed wrong not to. I’m pretty sure you know he’s in Slytherin. Again ironic, don’t you think? The saviour’s son in the evil house of snakes. But he’s strong, you can feel his magic. He is making me so proud, you would be too if you knew. But you won’t. You still don’t remember our night so you will never know.
He chokes on his breath and Dragon purrs in an attempt to comfort him, “He doesn’t really care who he tortures as long as he hears someone scream.”
“That’s good,” she sighs, “Then we should think about some steps on how to get him back to reality.”
“I don’t!” I growl, frowning at her, but they only laugh and for a moment I feel myself set back to lighter times. I allow myself to enjoy that and laugh with them.
“New?” I blink at her tiredly then straighten up, “Yeah, it’s strange. Sometimes, especially directly after a panic attack, Draco is completely clear.”
Sorry for the rant, but I've read it multiple times in comments (both here as well as on fanfiction.net), that something is not canon or that some character would not behave that way in the original medium. Well yes, that's why it's called fanfiction.
“Sorry, but you can’t do that,” she hands him back the brush instead, “Shenan is well trained but even she can’t hold up her hooves on her own for that long. So to clean them you would need two hands, not just one.”
I frown at him, “This is a riding stable for unstable patients and you have aggressive horses here?”
“That’s not what I would call staying away from humans,” I point to Draco who has his hand buried in the grey mane.
“Yes, before I took Draco in. Andromeda wanted him to have parents, not just a grandmother. Since I am his godfather I am the closest he has left,” I sigh, rubbing a hand over my face, “She wants me to take him again… And don’t get me wrong, I understand why she wants that, but right now there is just no way.”
“He’s scarred all over his body, has been starved and even raped by who I suspect were prison guards from Azkaban,” I see him swallow uncomfortably, “He has several mental problems that I can’t list from the top of my head. All I know that the list is long.”
“So they want me to stand as accused again,” he cuts her off, his fingers clench in his sleeves and he seems to ready himself to flee again.
In the end he does get there on his own, taking a step away from the fence. He connects his eyes with mine again, giving me a minute nod. I return the gesture and slowly continue my path. He follows me, but keeps even closer to the houses than before, nearly trampling through someone’s flowerbeds in the process.
His only response is another snort, but he keeps his head up, observing me through the curtain of his hair, “Why are you here?”
He doesn’t do much but he blinks again and his good hand comes to lay still next to the stuffed animal on his lap. I take that as a yes and my chest clenches at the revelation. I sink down next to him and stroke his hand while a silent tear makes it’s way down my cheek.
“I guess not then,” I sigh, “She would be coming with her grandson Teddy? Would that be okay with you?”
“Oy Malfoy, I heard you dropped out of the Quidditch team,” I yell after you in an afterthought at passing you in the corridor, a piece of news I found very surprising to say the least and slightly disappointing to be honest (Quidditch just isn’t the same when you’re not competing with me), “Why would you do that?” I want to know, is there something wrong with you?
“Racism at its finest once again. Fascinating how much they behave just like the people who they judge so strongly,” I shake my head, “Any progress?”
I apologize for the delay. Unfortunately now I'm out of written stuff, this is all I had on my computer. I know where I want to go with the story but to write it out, not to mention add filler, isn't as easy as it sounds.
“Oh Draco,” I murmur and once again pull him into my arms. He doesn’t resist this time, “It will come back,” I try, but he shakes his head.
He only softly shakes his head. Well, I know he would never trust me easily. Not after everything he went through, I can hardly blame him. So I only coax him to get into the tub with as much care as I can muster. His movements are slow and hesitant but in the end he does it. He twitches a moment but then sinks his foot into the warm water with a soft sigh, which has me smiling. A worryingly long time later he finally sits in the tub. His right hand is running through the warm water, a wistful, but still crooked smile on his face. He lifts the hand out of the water and lets it fall down again, splashing water on me too. While at it he gives a short sound, which could be the start of a laugh, but more like a toddler would sound, rather than a grown man. I sigh. This is going to be a very long road until recovery. But we are going to get there one day.
Summoning a paper and filling out the blanks on it, he fixes me with a stern gaze, “Take care however, Harry. I don’t know exactly what will await you down there. I am sure Malfoy will not be who you remember. You have to be careful with him. And report to me about his state please. Just a last question. Where do you plan on where he will stay?”
My hand clenches. Ginny. One of those god forsaken Weasels. Feeling my turmoil even though I don’t show it, Lou grabs my hand. She keeps on making conversation with you. I set on pretending to ignore you. That’s what former enemies do, right? We are grown up enough to not shout insults the moment we see each other, so ignoring is the best solution. We are enemies after all and that’s everything we will ever be apart from that one night twelve years ago.
“Oh yes you are,” she laughs, “Don’t take me for stupid. I remember our conversation about loving another man perfectly. And only a year later you drag a boy you were supposed to hate into your home and try everything you can to cure him of a possibly fatal mental condition. Gratefulness for saving you and perhaps all of us is not enough to warrant such actions.”
“But you bought us time,” I have approached him during our talk and am now close enough to lay a hand on his arm. He stiffens at the contact and tries to pull away but I squeeze minimally and he relents even though he still looks ready to run, “Enough time to manage an escape.”
But I had exams, both theoretical and practical, which took up a lot of my time. And now that they are finished I caught the cold as you do once all the stress finally falls away.
unfortunately I still don't have a new laptop so updates will be rare until the middle of october. I deeply apologise ^^'
“What will trigger his memories? Will they come back in the order of his life like his abilities do?”
By the time I make it to Draco’s room, the alarm has calmed again. I push the door completely open, “Draco?” I call out, “Are you okay?”
I sigh and nod. When I turn back to the other boy and see his eyes drop, I give a small smile. Exchanging a nod with Hermione I step over to him and carefully lift him up.
“Yes,” I nod, carefully trying to gain the other’s attention, “Hey, Draco. Could you look at me for a moment? You can go back to the horse in a minute.”
“NO!” I fight the urge to vomit, “Of course not,” I glare at him, as I see one of his nails break his own skin, causing blood to trickle down his arm. He doesn’t seem to notice the pain, “I don’t expect anything from you, except maybe that you give me another chance at being friends once you can think clearly again.”
“I know,” I repeat, “I understand that she is important to you, but for now you have to think about your own health. Her state can’t be changed, not for the better or the worse, but you are recovering and we can’t risk a setback.”
“Okay,” I nod, “I couldn’t pinpoint that even if I tried. It started out in sixth year when I saw how bad he looked. Over the time until the end of the war I discovered that he didn’t want to be a death eater at all. I understand being forced into your role and probably started to feel some kind of kinship to him. I spoke for him at the trials because the truth had to be brought out and when I saw the injustice done to him, I tried my best to find a way to get him out of prison. When I managed to and he was in no shape to take care of himself I took him in.”
“No, they are. Theoretically we could do that,” she tilts her head, “But that means removing a huge amount of memories. Years of them. Do you want to be the one who has to explain to him why there are massive gaps in his memories? That nearly all of his last five years are missing? I don’t,” she clears her throat, “Not to mention that with his character he would demand to be told anyway or force you to give him the memories back. Either way you would achieve nothing but a brief respite until his traumatic past comes back to him.”
“That’s all for you. You can have all the food you want as long as you are with me. No matter what, no matter how much. All you have to do is ask,” I choke out.
“It’s alright,” she cuts me off, “If he is actually up for this, it might be good to let him take this step. This is a known and safe environment for him. It’s true normally I would advise against letting him take such a leap on his own, but Draco has always been…” she searches for a word, “special. It’s like he is a totally different person when he’s with the horses from what you have told me.”
“It’s about Dumbledore’s old office. The majority of his files and papers has just been pushed into the storeroom next to it, since at that time no one wanted to go through it. It would be a great help if you could look at them. You know, throw away what is useless and decide what we should keep.”
“Fine. Yes, I met him on our first day of Hogwarts. No, actually the first time I saw him was in Madam Malkin’s but I didn’t know who he was then.”
Just as I am about to drift away again, a shrill sound fills the room. I jerk instinctively and fall off the chair. Even getting up from the floor however sounds like too much of a chore, so I just remain there. I hear Dragon yowl and something, most likely a book from Draco’s nightstand, land on the ground. The only thing I manage to do is sigh and it soon quiets down again. Getting up still sounds like a terrible idea…
“You mean the ministry is trying to do it right this time because they don’t want to face the debacle they will have if it comes out that they didn’t investigate correctly,” I correct, which earns me another pursed lip.
“Yes, yes,” he cuts me off, “You said that, numerous times now,” his fingernails are digging into my skin, “Even if… the fact remains, that my mind was severely damaged,” I throw a quick look around, this might not be the best place to discuss such a heavy topic, “It can recover, yes, theoretically at least. But some damage will remain…” he searches for the right words, “Some scars are too deep to ever heal over. Some memories will forever be lost to me or at least unclear,” before I can open my mouth, he shakes his head and cuts me off, “I won’t lose any skills. I can remember the recipe of every potion I ever brewed and how exactly to approach a jump so the horse will clear it easily. I won’t have amnesia either. It’s not like there will be big portions of my memories just missing. Only some things…”
We arrive home at about the same time as last week and he falls straight into bed, falling asleep with a small smile on his face and his stuffed dragon in his arms. Meanwhile I sit down in the living room to do some studying for my healer career for once.
When I raise my eyes again, he is still staring at me like I lost my mind. Or as if he is doubting whether he lost his.
“We could get married,” I whisper, “So Orion can have you as his mother and no one will ask him about his parents anymore.”
“I am studying to be a healer,” I patiently explain, “And since you came here, I have been reading up on trauma patients.”
Anyway back to the main topic. You’re dead now. I honestly cried when I heard the news. I am sad, really sad. And I feel like I missed out on so many chances I could have had. I am standing here and watching your casket being lowered into the ground next to Lou’s. They said you died so early (for a wizard that is) because your body couldn’t deal with the remaining damage from torture from younger years anymore. Mostly your heart giving up from damage of too many Crucio curses.
We watch Draco in silence for a few moments, before I have to ask, “Should he just stay right in the middle of a whole herd? Isn’t that dangerous?”
The next weeks are peaceful. We do our best to keep Draco away from the outside world and anything surprising to make sure not to trigger any relapses. The only times either of us leaves the house is for horse therapy and by now I am quite sick of my own four walls. But he’s getting better. There are several instances where I notice his eyes clearing and his posture stiffening. He doesn’t talk to me during those times. The horses yes, but none of us. If I try to speak to him, he retreats. In fact he actively pretends to still be caught in the haze by purposefully not using his left arm. It’s like he doesn’t want to come back. I would really like to help him get past this depression as well, but since he is far from being clear the whole time we decided to focus on that first.
This chapter is still more of a filler, because I was missing riding at the time I write it, but the story will continue in the following chapter.
“You can’t be serious,” derision has seeped into his voice and if it was anyone else I would think they were crying from how his voice sounds.
I nod tensely but hand over my wand anyway. Hermione does the same. Then the guard pulls out a wand from a box sealed securely in the wall. It is well known to me with the black wood.
Arthur takes the sheets and studies them, “I have never heard that codename before, I must say. But this information is high class. Where did you get them from?”
Wearily I sigh again, “I know you’re not. You’re smart. But yes, I want to be friends with you. You might have done bad things during the war but none of them were on your own free will. Not to mention you saved more people. You are a good person, Draco Malfoy. And if you don’t believe me I will tell you until you do.”
I wanted to talk to you afterwards, but you just held your head high and marched past all the reporters, ignoring me still. All that was left for me was to stare after you.
“I know and I never expected him to. Just sometimes…” I drag a hand down my face, “Sometimes I wish it would go faster.”
Eventually I see his figure stiffening and I know he’s waking up. Immediately I am halfway on the bed, just being able to stop myself because he might scare from someone too close when he wakes up. Watching him closely, I see grey eyes slide cautiously open.
But he doesn’t give me time to ponder it longer as a new jolt of determination seems to shoot through him. His figure straightens and his hand loosens from where it was clutched on the railing. The left arm is dug deep into his coat pocket, whether to hide it or to grip onto something to ground him, I don’t know and won’t question. Instead I glare at a bulky muggle who gives me an annoyed look for standing still on the sidewalk. By the time I turn back, Draco is nearly standing next to me.
“Are you married? Are you Orion’s mother?” I ask, turning to the woman besides you with a strained grin, asking the question which pains me the most.
After another very cautious look towards the woman, he allows me to pick Teddy from his arm. How he got him securely up there is a mystery in itself but I won’t ask. I get a long last look from grey orbs before he hurriedly turns and swishes around the corner and off somewhere into the rest of the house. I turn to Andromeda and hand Teddy into her arms. She presses the toddler close, burying her face in his hair. I let her have a few moments.
“I won’t, I promise!” I say carefully, still unsure what triggered this attack. Dragon meows at me, the cat’s eyes wide and he looks ready to bolt. I bow down to scratch the feline, “Did you run over the umbrella?” I ask nervously, eyes never properly leaving the whimpering boy, even as I bow down to put the thing away. But as soon as I touch the handle of the umbrella, Draco gives a loud scream and tries to curl in even further. It causes me to drop the umbrella in shock and Dragon to hiss and scamper under a small cupboard standing in the hallway.
When we reappear on a forest path close to the stable it takes him a second to register the definitive unknown surroundings. He stiffens immediately and he looks ready to bolt, eyes wide. Hermione throws me a worried look over the blonde’s shoulder. I know she is questioning whether it’s not too early but I have trust that Draco will be just fine. So I carefully nudge the other man forward, supporting him, and press his stuffed dragon, which I took from home as a caution, in his hand. He seems to calm down a bit, but his distress is still clear.
“Right,” he sighs, “They would have just locked me up somewhere because they wouldn’t have trusted me thanks to my father.”
Eventually he grabs it and then nearly makes a run for it, as much as he is capable of that, away from us other humans. Shenan snorts but follows the boy happily, moving into a slow trot to catch up with him. Andrea shakes her head in amusement and we retreat to the door of the hall. We watch him lead the horse around the space at an even pace, his movements more stable than they were without her along. After about ten minutes he stops. I frown but this time it’s Andrea who stops me. So I just watch him. He loops the rope loosely around his shoulder. Then with sure movements he starts to fiddle with the girth around the mare’s stomach. Andrea stares with something close to astonishment how he carefully tightens both straps by two holes.
As soon as the ministry hears the name ‘Malfoy’ they put up walls. We have achieved lighter punishments for a bunch of other people in similar situations like him though. A little victory, just not the one I wished for. As for the proof, I have run out of options. The only thing I haven’t tried is talking to Draco directly, but I doubt he would be much help nowadays. Luna managed to get through the ministry three months ago and was allowed to visit him in his cell and what she told me was anything but encouraging. I remember that day clearly.
We quiet down again, everybody eating their breakfast. After he is finished, I help Draco back to his feet and lead him to his room. He follows without protest. But before I lower him onto his bed, he throws his arm out. It’s vague and I have to do some guesswork until I manage to work out from the hints he gives that he wants his favourite book again.
Our luck holds until the next Thursday and the blonde is calm enough to go to horse therapy. Hermione has decided to accompany us this time just to be safe. Draco is more nervous than normal and tries to twitch away just before we apparate. At first he seems slow to calm down even with the smell of the stable surrounding him.
In fact, do you have friends? No matter when I see you these days, you are always alone. It seems sad to me. And you look slightly ill in recent time too.
He shakes his head, “It is fine. I always found his punishment was way too hard for someone as young as him,” he smiles a pained smile, “Besides I had a friend who suffered a similar situation. Only that he is a number of layers further up. Now I can visit him daily.”
I jump and try to force my tired legs faster. I would recognise that cackle anywhere. Voldemort! Not again. He’s dead and I know that but my body just keeps running.
“I managed to get them to return a few of the Malfoy properties they confiscated as well as a small part of the money they took.”
There she takes the long rope from her arm to her hand and starts unrolling it slowly, motioning towards the mare. The horse starts walking again in circles around her, that become larger with every new bit of rope. Eventually the woman stops. To my surprise Draco is wearing a look somewhere between disdainful and annoyed.
Her teary eyes fix on me, “And you will help the young master? And he won’t be angry because Tilly broke the promise?”
I squirm a bit, “I want to find out who was behind it. I think he was a death eater who is imprisoned now and helping you would provide a reason to free him or at least lighten his punishment.”
“Here,” I press the birth certificate into her hands, “There, ‘A’. Malfoy is Spy A. I have the confirmation now,” I explain, summoning my pensive while at it.
“I promise I don’t want to hurt you. The water isn’t going to either, I swear. I don’t know what they did to you, but I swear to you, it’s never going to happen to you again,” I take his face in my hands and make him look at me, “I promise I will take care of you. I won’t let anyone ever hurt you again. You can trust me.”
“I read it over,” she tugs uncomfortably at one of her curly strands, “Most questions are reasonable, but there are a few,” she points at the first, lined with red, “I marked them for you. I’m not sure whether they are purposefully trying to make it worse for him, but they are seriously questionable.”
I haven’t seen you since the trials and haven’t spoken to you since our last fight back at Hogwarts. I miss your retorts from them. The challenge you provided me. That you didn’t see me as the saviour but only as Harry. I think even Ginny’s love is partly related to me being everyone’s hero. You never did care about that. I long for that so much.
“That’s one point. Also, Teddy needs a lot of attention, he’s not even three after all. But Draco already requires so much attention. Not to mention that I have to study as well at some point. I am bordering on being forced to repeat some lectures anyway. I can’t take care of Teddy as well when I can barely manage Draco and my life at the same time.”
My eyes widen. This is exactly that. A spy report! And from no one who I have ever heard of. I mean I know that Snape was a spy and I saw a short list when I looked through important documents after the war, but that synonym ‘Spy A’ I have never heard before. With new interest I throw myself into the documents, eager to find out more about this mysterious character.
I sigh, “Yes, he was a right asshole at that time. Typical pureblood upbringing. He thought he was better than everybody else. I refused to let him drag me with him. Probably bruised his ego and he was pissed at me from that on.”
He only startles badly once when a child too young for kindergarten wheels past us with a loud squeal on a bike without pedals. The little girl came from behind, so I didn’t see her on time, therefore she manages to cause Draco to startle badly and nearly jump into the fence to his right, probably banging his hip on one of the metal bars. He stares at the child in fright, clearly holding in a scream he doesn’t want to release in public. It takes him some time to remind himself that it was just an infant that can’t really harm him. I am ready to go back home then and there, but he gives me a glare that clearly says ‘Don’t you dare’, so I wait until he manages to unclench his hands from the iron fence, worry never leaving my eyes.
The laugh he responds with is more of a choke, “And how well that went over with Voldemort. Mother wouldn’t have survived the punishment he wanted to dole out to each of us.”
“It’s no problem,” she waves off as she steps close and envelopes me into a hug, “I’m just glad you’re here now and that he is being taken care of.”
“I know, I know,” I open my arms in an attempt to reach out without forcing contact on him, “But he can’t hurt you anymore. Never again.”
My head shoots up, being ripped out of my daze. I nod and mumble some apology. I try my best to stay focused but my thoughts always drift away. They drift to you. My eyes land on the empty chair on the Slytherin side of the classroom. You have been gone for over a week now. I have looked everywhere. You’re not in any classes, at your house rooms and not even in the hospital wing. I can’t even find you on the Marauder’s map. You just disappeared one day. Saturday I saw you at dinner in the great hall. Sunday you didn’t appear but that was not so unusual. But on Monday your seat in potions, the first lesson of the day, was empty. And it has been since.
“Well, he’s certainly getting more active when we’re getting closer to horses,” I huff as I catch myself against the wall of the stable.
“Yes,” she answers, “No,” an immediate correction, “I mean, in a way. What I want to say is that we both know that he isn’t going to stay like that,” she waves a hand in his direction, “I don’t deny it’s cute and maybe finally the happy youth like he deserved but he’s over twenty. We said we wanted him capable of living a normal life. He can’t do that if he’s still mentally stuck at being a toddler.”
“I don’t think anyone would believe you this,” the judge snorts, “But you have a chance to prove it, don’t you? Will you let us question you under Veritaserum?”
She nods and sits down on a chair in the corner of my vision, “You should maybe give him something soft. You know like mashed potatoes or something alike. I contacted Michael again and he said that Draco has most likely been given little other than some unidentifiable mash all the time he was down there. His words, not mine. So his teeth most likely wouldn’t be able to deal with something like a steak.”
And shoot up straight in bed. My breathing is fast and irregular as tears drip down my cheeks. One hand is clenched over my racing heart. I don’t stay like that for long though because the nausea from my dream comes back with vehemence and rises up my throat. Hurriedly I jump out of my bed, shaky legs carrying me to the bathroom.
She laughs, such a beautiful sound, “If that’s your wish, I am fine with it. You were the one who said we were just friends.”
“I’m fine, Kari. You know that happens sometimes when I ride without a saddle,” he grins up at her and I realise that he seems to think he is back at the Manor when he was still young.
To my surprise though, I suddenly feel a cold touch on my neck. I jerk up, only to meet empty grey eyes. Draco is looking straight at me. It’s his hand that’s laying on my neck, bony fingers running slowly into my hair. I choke on another sob and bury my head back into the cold skin.
He sighs, head falling down, “I will be fine, Potter. I feel more at home on the back of a horse than I do on a broom. A saddle is more secure than those lunging girths. They are mostly used for vaulting, because they need the space to do their exercises and for people who can’t use stirrups,” he shrugs, bringing his arms under the proper saddle and the blanket underneath it, “And yes, I used to ride with a saddle but when I was sure I could get away with it because no one saw me, I would ride without anything.”
She nods, her smile turning a bit more serious, “Alright. For whom? I doubt it’s yourself since you don’t seem very comfortable around horses, no offense.”
“They will, but of course the first thing they will argue that he could have lied or that I could have simply made the answers up to serve my case – “
He gives something resembling a huff at that and I chuckle, turning to my friend, “Can you get the sling for his arm? We need to secure it again.”
She grins mischievously, chasing away most of the sadness in her face, “Because you are not the only one who has been more than experimenting with both genders.”
He only whimpers, shaking under my hand, pulling the comforter tighter. I sigh, I am so tired. But that is probably nothing against what Draco must be feeling.
I give her an exhausted smile then stand up, accepting her hand. After a last stroke to Draco’s face I follow her out of the room and down into the kitchen where she busies herself with making tea with honey for the both of us while I tell her the story from the afternoon. Her scowl is heavy on her face when she settles on the chair next to me, sipping on her drink.
She only snorts, now keeping Draco from moving past us, “Do I really need to list that? How about your obsession with Draco since the day you two met for the first time? Or the fact that you were practically stalking him through sixth year?”
When they disappear from my view I turn back to Andromeda, only to see the first tear slip down her cheek.
Currently I am borrowing my parents' laptop, but writing fanfiction is not exactly something you want to do on your family's computer ^^'
I can’t answer for a moment and just stare at him. His tone reminds me a lot of our Hogwarts years, the Draco Malfoy I desperately miss, but there is an added tremor that wasn’t there back then. Maybe he was just hiding it. His hair is still whiter than it used to be and I doubt it will ever regain the golden colour from our first years. He is still too thin as well, bones pronounced unhealthily. His face is drawn, but at least his eyes have regained their spark for now.
“You also presented new evidence that he worked as a spy during the war, do you know more about that?”
“I cannot say much,” he shakes his head, “Every prisoner reacts differently. For now he shows apathy but that can change in seconds and he could fly into panic. Be careful is all I can tell you.”
I sigh, “Ginny, I am sorry. But I don’t feel for you that way. And it’s not going to change. For sure not if you keep pushing yourself on me,” I softly touch her shoulder, “Let me go. Find someone who loves you back as much as you deserve, Ginny.”
“That’s true,” I nod as I watch him put the bridle over Shenan’s head, carefully inserting the mouth bit before she lowers her head to allow him to pull the leather over her ears.
Somehow it hurts me when I think he could be your son. Why? I have three great children with Ginny to whom I am married happily. Well mostly. Sometimes I have the feeling something is missing. I can’t say what. I still mainly feel like a sister for Ginny, but that was what everyone was thinking would happen so I proposed to her and she was deeply in love with me either way, so it was perfect. Wasn’t it?
He stares blankly at me and the food too but doesn’t make any move to reach for it. He is still as apathetic as he was when we got him out of prison. Even when I stretch the croissant further towards him, he only looks at it as if he doesn’t really know what to do with it. I sigh, a painful sting shooting through my chest. But he has to eat something. He is way too thin anyway. If this goes on for much longer, he is going to die of starvation. So I tear a small piece from the croissant.
We give Draco three weeks to restabilize. In that time we also make the first tries to bring him outside. Only the back garden at the beginning. It’s warded and shielded from any human who can’t enter the house either. The first time we tried it (well, only me since he is tenser when Hermione is there too), he nearly jumped backwards when I tried to coax him over the doorstep. He seemed frightened at first but after about half an hour of coaxing and the assistance of his stuffed dragon he finally stepped out into the open. After the initial hesitance he took pretty well to the outside. I think it’s a remnant of his days in the prison. He loves the fresh air and garden. (I cleaned it up for him so there won’t be anything dangerous.)
When my fingers touch the skin of his left hand, he twitches. The tremor even reaches his left arm and the appendage is pulled a minimal distance further to his body, away from me. It is like he is hiding his left arm. Is he ashamed of it? Carefully I stretch further, trying to reach for his left arm again but he uses his right hand to shakily pull the still appendage away from my touch. I frown.
“No, never again,” I tell him the same line I have for the past nights, “He can’t hurt you anymore ever again, I promise.”
“Nothing more than I could read in the reports of which I have already sent a copy to the minister. The only ones apart from Draco himself who can tell us more about this are already dead, I’m afraid.”
“He called me ‘Potter’ a few times, asked where he was and one time he even asked whether the war was over.”
I nod as well and say my goodbyes. She throws me a last concerned look then disappears in a flash of green flames. I burry my face in my hands. Another step back. Great, the same unfriendly wizarding world like before Voldemort. People aren’t able to learn from the mistakes of the past, are they?
“But it can be reopened, right? He didn’t completely delete it, just put a barrier up after all,” I press on, there has to be a way to help Draco.
“Who Harry?” her eyes are watering, “If you think about it, who does? From his goons one is dead, the other in Azkaban. Pansy is in prison too. Blaise fled the country. His mother is in a mental institution and wouldn’t recognise him even if she saw him. His father is dead too, not that he would be helpful. I can seriously understand if he would just want to be left alone after a whole life spent in pain.”
“The ministry should know better. They really should have chosen somebody else. I just hope it didn’t hit Draco too hard,” she sighs, mussing up her hair even further.
“Right and we start now,” I stand up, still holding his hand, “And the first thing is to get you something to eat and then clean you up, okay?”
I give a sad smile, “No, his arm’s physically fine. I think it’s a reminder of very bad memories so he ignores it and doesn’t use it because of that.”
“What? He would never do that. Everybody knows that I am a Death Eater. I don’t think I need to show you my mark to remind you of it,” confusion is added to the swirling chaos of emotions in his wide eyes.
I know I'm repeating myself, but english is not my native language. So while I used to ride as well, I do not know any riding specific vocabulary. Online dictionaries couldn't always give me a translation either, so I blame it on Harry not knowing anything about riding i some descriptions sound a bit strange.
“So it might actually be progress if he can remain clear,” she cringes, “Even if it’s warped by him being scared of everything.”
“Add to that the trauma of the war and what he went through in Azkaban,” her hand rubs across her face, “Still very sad. And he didn’t deserve any of it.”
“Besides you have a huge crush on Draco anyway and you wouldn’t feel right going off to find someone when the one you really love is left alone at your home and suffering.”
“That mare,” he points at the grey one Draco is petting and by now nearly leaning on, “Is one of the most difficult horses we have. She used to be a racing champion, but after an injury she got retired, unfortunately it also turned her volatile. Nowadays there are only few persons who can so much as touch her without her trying to bite them.”
“We still have some potato soup. Is that alright or should I ask Kreacher to make you something else?”
I shrug, “Whether before Azkaban or during that I don’t want to think about,” then I suddenly wince, “Though it could also be the Fiendfyre that nearly killed him in the Room of Requirement. Who knows?”
At her sharp intake of breath, I remember with a shock that I never mentioned what exactly we read in her sister’s diary to her. But before I can argue she just waves her hand.
At that I shake my head with a soft smile, “No, it’s fine,” I run fingers through Draco’s hair, “He’s been a big part of my life for as long as I have known of the wizarding world. I want to bring that part to rights and maybe then I can think of focusing on someone else.”
“Possible? Sure,” she tilts her head, “It’s only for experienced riders though. You can ride without a saddle, without a bridle or with neither.”
“Well, most of the death eaters would always be very cruel when they handled us. He wasn’t. He lead us wherever he had to bring us, instead of just simply dragging us along. He never hit us as long as he didn’t have to and would support Olivander when no one would see,” she explains, then her eyes fix on me with a startling clarity, “He is a good person at heart. He was just raised wrong.”
“ – depends on the person, I know,” I shake my head sadly, “Never thought I would wish for him to return to infant-state.”
You are such an idiot, Draco! I am so angry. There is going to be such a lecture once I follow you into the afterlife. And it’s not going to take long if my heart continues to rage like it does currently. Wouldn’t that be an ironic death for the saviour of the wizarding world? Slumped over the grave of his school-time archenemy and also one true love.
“No, but you are sleeping on the floor, Harry,” the rustling of clothes sounds as the shadow above me moves.
“Do we really have to go into this? It’s an invasion of his personal sphere if you ask me,” I frown.
I fetch the tools Draco dropped and he tries to get as close to the horse as he can when I pass him. I heave another sigh and readjust his arm in the sling. He can’t move it anymore after all. He stares at me warily but his focus diverts to Andrea as she enters with a blanket. Draco keeps an arm around Shenan while she puts it on and returns with the other part of the mare’s gear. I am a bit confused when she puts it on the horse’s back.
“Yes, if someone is a confirmed spy they can’t be accused of crimes they committed while hiding in the dark lords ranks,” he agrees, “However I don’t see what this has to do with Malfoy.”
“You!” I yell, my annoyance finally reaching the boiling point, “You wanted to marry. I never said anything like that! It’s true I loved you during 6th year, but I don’t anymore. Get that into your head. You are a sister to me not more! And we are not coming back together! So stop following me around.”
“He’s not going to hurt you. He can’t. You’re safe, Draco. Look at me. You’re fine,” I try to sooth, but every try of touching him is met with another panicked cry, even when it’s just Dragon I push towards him.
“Even after two wars the wizarding world is still not changing then,” I smile sadly as I stroke Draco’s soft hair, “But for now I guess I’m happy with changing your world for the better.”
I yawn as I push open the door to Grimmauld Place. I have been out and about, trying to find one specific horse. From the way Draco talked about Karina’s Dream she was very dear to him. He hasn’t made as much progress as we had hoped, so he is beyond frustrated. I hoped that finding his beloved mare from childhood days would lift his sprits.
Hermione smiles at me for a moment, then she focuses down on the parchment before asking the next question. Time passes that way while I keep an eye on Draco.
In the evening Hermione comes to visit. I am sitting in the kitchen, staring into a cup of coffee. She approaches me cautiously when she sees my drawn face.
I blush heavily, but can’t really find it in me to deny it so I only glare at her, “Where would you get that impression?”
“I know, I know,” she falls down next to me again, “You just got beaten on rare occasions when you made a grave mistake, usually involving magic, and they constantly insulted you,” another protest is cut off by her words, “That counts as emotional abuse too,” then she shakes her head, “But that’s not the matter here. Look, even though his life seemed perfect, it was all a mask for Draco. His life was probably worse than yours.”
Kreacher, even though we are good now, only very rarely responds. Draco never does, he hides in his rooms. So at first I don’t think the complete and utter silence of Grimmauld Place any strange. I decide to go to the kitchen first to make some coffee, still yawning. The house elf isn’t there. When I wander back up however, I am greeted by Dragon ambling out of one of the living rooms. When the cat sees me, he meows and bounds up eagerly, winding around my legs.
Another five days later it is time for Draco’s second therapy session. He has been whining about the horses anyway. Hermione arrives early and I am still preparing Draco when she finds us in his room. He is sitting on the bed, mostly dressed but he keeps interrupting me because he’s reaching for a book or Dragon and sometimes throwing things around with his new magic. All in all it’s a tad bit chaotic. The girl obviously can’t keep herself from giggling when she sees us.
He startles at that, looking up at me with wide eyes. He blinks a few times before he seems to orient himself with the shift of topic, “Karina’s Dream,” he corrects me, gaze focused down into his cup of what is essentially still only hot water.
“What are you doing here? Do you have an appointment with the minister?” she immediately rises, but I ignore her, striding past. I can use my saviour persona too if I want something. Be the hero everyone wants me to be.
“Since when do you call me by my first name?” the blonde startles, instinctively trying to scurry away from the other, “What the hell is going on? Where am I? Last I remember I was at the Manor and –“ His eyes spring wide, “By Merlin! Vold – The – “
“Yes, you remember that I said the ministry finally allowed me to visit Draco,” she says and dread settles into my stomach, “Today was the day they let me see him,” she takes a swallow of juice, “Not enough that they already treated me nearly like a criminal just because I wanted to visit a classmate of mine. They ran countless searching spells over me and took my wand. Only then would they let me down there. And I tell you it’s awful there. No light, no warmth, no fresh air. Only cold, damp, dark stone, bars, guards and those god-forsaken dementors. These are no human living conditions.”
It was to be expected, just not the long decision phase of the hat. As far as I remember the hat did barely touch your head back then before it called out ‘Slytherin’. Interesting, it only makes me more curious as to who the other parent is. The boy smiles though, puts the hat off and hurries over to the green and silver table, being happily greeted by his new housemates. He even shortly waves at the raven he talked with earlier, who was sorted into Gryffindor before him. My eyes never leave the young blonde. The stab in my chest when thinking about him being your son is still present.
Unfortunately Teddy doesn’t share this sentiment. He stares curiously at the blond man, a now squirming Dragon clutched securely in his arms. His eyes are focused on the pale face and when wide grey ones turn on him, the little boy’s eyes change to match the other’s.
^^' Sorry, but it's really been a big annoyance for the past weeks. And I'm still pissed at my roommate for inisisting on the worse connection, but what can you do...
“Food…?” he says carefully, sounding somewhere between complaining and unsure whether he is allowed to ask that.
“Yes, sleeping on the ground must hurt,” the voice sighs, a hand tapping on my shoulder, “Get up, Harry.”
“Not to mention, I realised that rejecting you back then might have been a mistake,” I shrug, now unsure as well, “A lot of things would have been different if I hadn’t.”
It earns me a round of laughter but I ignore it and drink another gulp from my newest coffee. Instead I stumble over to my chair and bury myself anew into a summary of what I have to know for the exam.
It still causes me to frown. Something tells me that the person I am searching for is not one of them. Arthur said they were lower ranking death eaters, but Spy A wasn’t that.
That seems to have earned me his attention as he makes an effort to slowly turn his head towards me. Grey orbs fix on the bundle of fur in my arms. I smile and lift the cat who turns curious bright blue eyes on the still human.
“Like I told you, I am perfectly capable of preparing a horse on my own,” he glares, “I can just go search for the room on my own.”
Of course I don’t get an answer, so I just run a hand through my hair. I slow my movements but continue to approach him. He stiffens but at least he is peeking through his fingers again. I lay my wand on the table and lift my hands in a nonthreatening move.
Hermione frowns, “For that he would have to be more responsive. His mind is nearly in a coma now, for all technicalities. He has the mental capacity of a baby, with some of the rules of his adult-self stuck over it. He can’t really feel it that way, not with the state he is in right now,” she touches my shoulder softly, “Maybe it would really be the best to end his suffering.”
I listen to her ramblings, the feeling of dread strengthening. I never thought they would treat him well. I have never been to that part of Azkaban (or the prison itself) but that it was that inhuman? Well, I should have suspected it, the prison is known to drive even perfectly sane people crazy. One of my hands clenches in my lap. What have they done to Draco?
“I agree. My apologies,” Sergio repeats, “He has been punished. Nonetheless there are a few question we would like you to answer if it’s okay.”
“He’s a pretty one, isn’t he?” Voldemort nearly coos, causing a violent shudder to run down my back. The dementor hand comes up, sickeningly caressing Draco’s overly pale skin and I want to throw up, “Yes, very pretty. Such a nice young body, though he really looked better back then,” I feel more sick with every word he says, the question whether that actually happened to Draco coming unbidden to my mind, making everything worse, “But do you know what was the best about him?” one finger traces Draco’s blood-empty lips and I want to scream or do anything but it’s like I am completely frozen, “The way he screamed. Such pretty screams. He held out quite some time,” an evil smile, “But everyone breaks eventually and it was worth it,” his eyes wander up, locking with mine, and he smirks, more like flashing his teeth at me, “Do you want to hear it?”
“Because what the dark lord did and was planning was wrong and he needed to be stopped. I discovered that Severus was working as a spy, so I decided to go the same route, no matter how much he tried to dissuade me,” he answers in a cold voice.
“Yes, what were you up to last night?” she tugs on my hair, “You look terrible again, Harry. I thought things got better with Draco. You both should be getting more sleep than before. But instead he looks like he is reverting back to the ghost version of himself and you are laying passed out on the floor. Is something wrong?”
Sighing again, sadness seeping through me at how untrusting he has learned to be, “I can probably say whatever I want and you won’t believe it, so I won’t continue trying right now,” I give him a sad smile, “Maybe one day you can learn to trust again, but for now let’s get out of the house.”
“I won’t force you,” I try to believe that myself, “But sitting here in a back alley on the concrete can’t be comfortable. Not to mention you could catch a cold. I know you’re not weak, but your body is still suffering the aftereffects of two years in Azkaban.”
“You’re hungry?” he nods and I throw a look at the clock. My eyes widen, “No wonder, it’s already past ten in the morning. Damn, I overslept quite a bit. Sorry,” I rub the back of my neck, “Give me a moment, alright?”
Anger fills my chest and I’m sure my eyes are blazing, “He may have the dark mark, but he certainly isn’t any death eater. He probably didn’t even believe in Voldemort’s plans or he wouldn’t have become a spy. He risked his life. Especially judging by how close he must have been, the danger must have been high for him,” I clench my hands, “He should be considered a war hero and I can’t deal with the fact that he might be rotting in Azkaban despite that just because he has the mark.”
“Kari, I think,” I agree, “The name of his horse, Karina’s Dream. I would guess she was a similar colour.”
“Yes, it was Dumbledore who gave us that information. When somebody asked him where he got it, he just smiled that smile of his and said a little bird told him,” she shuffles through more sheets, “Yeah, these are nearly all things Dumbledore told us.”
He doesn’t react only eats the croissant at an incredibly slow pace. Each of his movements is shaky. But we are getting there. Nearly all of it is gone when he stops eating. He throws me a cautious look, then stares at the food for a moment. Another look to me and the rest of the croissant suddenly disappears into one of his dirty sleeves. For a moment I startle than realize that it is an action he learned in prison where he didn’t get enough food. Again sadness overwhelms me at how broken he has become. I caress his dirty cheek for another time, then I take a buttered toast and hold it to him. He looks at it for a moment, then takes a bite from it. I give a small smile. After half of the bread he looks up. Gaze skipping from the food to me to his sleeve and back, I shake my head.
But now I am standing in front of the massive black doors leading inside the huge white Manor. I swallow hard. As much as I would like to deny it I am nervous about entering the building. The mansion is still as ominous looking as ever. And the memories I connect with this house are not pleasant in the least at all. But this is nothing against living in Azkaban. So I take a deep breath and knock hard. A second later a loud crack announces the arrival of a house elf. One of the door wings swings open, revealing the small creature, clothed only in a dirty silver pillow case.
He seems to think for a moment and I keep silent, knowing he needs his time to respond. Eventually though his face scrunches up. A bony hand stretches out and does a vague motion in the direction of the stack of books on a small table opposite his bed.
“I know,” I wave it off, “That’s why I visited that house elf who was taking care of the prisoners again. And I got her to confirm that it was Draco who gave that order. That’s her memory,” I pour it into the bowl.
It takes a few minutes but eventually Dragon manages to bring Draco out of his panic. Grey eyes blink and a shaky hand starts caressing white fur. I have kept on murmuring comforting things the whole time through so as soon as he has come back, he realises I am still in the room and frightened eyes flit up to me. At first I think he is going to panic again, but instead he breathes a sigh in relief.
He doesn’t react, unsurprisingly, his attention completely on the stuffed toy once again. I sigh, but the smile stays on my face as I coax him out of bed and to the living room for breakfast.
She only waves me off and bustles away into the back rooms. A few minutes later she comes back, a small leather-bound book in hand. Her face holds a sad smile, but she comes over eagerly nonetheless. Grinning she plucks the sleeping baby from my arms and pushes the book at me. Staring at it curiously, I turn it in my hands.
Another meow has me grinning and I spend the rest of the afternoon playing with our new cat until it is time to check up on Draco again.
But it only gets me another head shake, “Tilly wants to help, she really wants. Both the master and Master Potter. But she can’t. Master especially ordered that Tilly never tells anyone about him.”
Through the whole story, Draco’s eyes have remained frozen, only narrowing briefly when I talk about the Manor. The judge has become more pissed with each sentence I said (and reminds me even more of Vernon due to it now). He is even glaring down at me while I am finishing my speech with the statement that I don’t believe Draco capable of killing anyone. Some whispers have started among the spectators and not all are immediately condemning Draco as far as I can hear. As I nod and leave the witness stand, I catch those silver eyes for a moment and he gives me a nearly unnoticeable nod but I smile back brightly.
The creaking of Shenan’s door and the rustling of the straw draw my eyes back to Draco. He peeks out into the hallway and immediately stiffens when he spots Andrea standing next to me. But the mare snorts and the woman respectfully retreats a short distance to give him the space he needs to step out. Shenan nudges him from behind and he cautiously takes the last step, never taking untrusting eyes off Andrea. Eventually he pushes the door completely open and leads the horse out. She follows him without a hesitation while he leads her down the hall again. His right hand is lightly resting on the reins, barely holding onto them. Just before he reaches the correct door, he stops. I worry for a moment before seeing that he only bends down to retrieve a helmet from the floor.
“Some rude ministry employee decided it was a good idea to yell right through the house because I didn’t come to the door fast enough. Draco heard it obviously and panicked. I had to force him asleep. But he came out of it better than we hoped. I wouldn’t have come if he was too bad.”
“Not that I know of. If someone on Voldemort’s side would have discovered it, I wouldn’t be alive anymore as for your side, I don’t know. Different from Severus, my spying was completely one-sided. I told them what I deemed useful, but got no information on your side,” he sneers, “After all I might be trying to betray them.”
Warnings for this chapter: noting too bad, but panic attacks I guess, and further mentions of what happened to Draco
“I want to check it over. Just to make sure you are really not injured,” I say softly, “Can I see your arm? Please?”
“For now, we give him a bit of time to get acquainted with Shenan. Since he is not shying away from the horse, there is no need for any interruption in this first step,” she watches Draco wistfully, “I have had so many patients with whom we had to take several sessions just to get them to touch a horse. He really is a blessing when it comes to that.”
I hadn’t planned on falling asleep, especially not next to Draco on the same bed but apparently I did, since I feel Hermione shaking me awake. The first thing I see when I open my eyes is Draco’s pale face, slack in sleep. I startle in surprise only to come nose to nose with Hermione’s concerned expression. Her hair is completely out of control around her head.
I grumble but hurry through the opening after the other man. Luckily nothing seems to have happened. He has his working hand and shoulder against the wall of the stalls. Curious horse heads peek from a few of the windows. Most pull back though when he sways past, as if understanding that if they touch him they might upset his course and cause him harm. Eventually he stops, panting slightly as if he just finished a run around the Quidditch field. I smile sadly at how weak his muscles have become. Still leaning against the wood he reaches his working hand out to stroke the nose of a brown horse carefully sniffing his hair.
Finding her is turning out to be a nearly impossible task however. By now I have discovered some old articles with magic pictures about the two of them. A young Draco atop a beautiful grey and white horse, holding up a trophy or executing a jump. The mare itself however seems to be lost to time. Draco said all the horses were sold during his time at Hogwarts. The paper trail is gone unfortunately since the mansion burned down.
“Oh, you wouldn’t want the only person who actually spares you any attention apart from your two mindless puppets to leave, would you, Potty?”
“Hm,” I hum, taking up another spoon, “I think it’s less my commands than he just needs some time to understand what he is supposed to do before he reacts.”
That earns me a raised eyebrow, “The best thing would be to search for professional help. Take him to St. Mungos.”
I sigh and run my hand through my hair. I am not getting the name out of her. If a house elf was specifically ordered to not tell anything, they will never do so under any circumstance. But while I’m already here…
Andrea and I make small talk while she leads Shenan around the hall. Hermione has left earlier this time. Draco is peaceful as always as long as he’s around horses, even urging Shenan to go faster at some point. It seems like she can’t decide whether to follow his commands or not. But neither Andrea nor I have been paying much attention and eventually the mare gives in and starts a slow trot. The therapist is surprised when the horse suddenly bypasses us, but immediately tries to reign it in again. Draco gives an annoyed sounds when Shenan slows down and the woman grins.
I see Andromeda relax, but she still doesn’t move. I on the other hand step closer to the nervous man, still smiling. Of course he would never hurt him. Seeing no adverse reaction as long as his aunt stays back I extend my arms towards him.
The trials, today are the trials. Your trial and your parents’. Officially yours too that is, but no one is sure, since you are rumoured to be dead since our sixth year. You aren’t as it turns out, a painful stab piercing through me when I see you. You are still as beautiful as back in Hogwarts. All those emotions of two years ago are returning to me. My chest aches. What are those feelings? Did I… love you? Do I still? No, it can’t be, can it? I’m with Ginny now and happily, but why do I feel like this then.
I sniffle a last time, before I lift the still way too light body. He is unconscious, so he is only dead weight now. Slowly I carry him back into his room and lay him onto his bed. I rub some tears off my face while I pull the duvet over him. He doesn’t so much as twitch. I sigh sadly. He was so well today and I destroyed it. I stroke his head and face. Still caressing him, I sink down next to the bed.
“That with you was an accident and as much to blame on Slughorn as Malfoy,” I rub my hand over my face, “And he didn’t kill Dumbledore, Snape did. Malfoy did only take his wand. He couldn’t kill him.”
“Do you see this?” she waves the list, “There are countless mental problems here that could make living normally impossible on their own in severe cases. Not to mention the fact that his brain has basically shut itself down.”
“Maybe because I see a bit of myself in you,” I murmur, not wanting to reveal the real reason behind it, “A boy forced into his role and side of the war before he even understood what the war was about. I didn’t have any choice to be anything but the boy-who-lived and no one asked you whether you really wanted to be a Death Eater. Not to mention that neither of us had the nicest homelife.”
Oh yes, the trials. My father got the kiss and my mother now resides in St. Mungos because she was classified as mentally disturbed after I disappeared. At least it’s not Azkaban. I got free, because all they could convict me for was being part of the Malfoy family. That’s apparently enough of a crime for them even when I disappeared before anything big happened. I guess I should thank you nonetheless for convincing them to let me go free. It was not easy to hide the fact I have a child during this by the way. I would have never managed without Lou Carrette, a good friend who I met when I hid in France. She looked after him while I was at court.
“I don’t think so. There were no signs of forced entry. The barriers were completely in place. A hat and his shoes were gone and every single spell on him was dissolved. My best guess is that he walked out on his own,” I shake my head, “I don’t know what happened to him after he left though.”
Just that small noise manages to startle the blonde though and he shoots around, nearly catching one of his feet on a chair. His eyes are wide for a moment before he does his best to school his features into a blank, slightly annoyed look.
My hand raises and I stroke through his light hair. He hasn’t moved the tiniest bit since I laid him there. His face is hollowed out.
“Kitty,” he says energetically as grey orbs turn to him again. He lifts Dragon higher who gives a protesting sound but is ignored by the two boys. “You. Kitty take,” the toddler insists, “Look sad. Kitty make better.”
Another nod then she motions towards Hermione, “Could you bring the steps standing next to the entrance, please?”
The door of Draco’s room is always slightly ajar, so I hear the soft sounds before I am even there. At first I am relieved because it assures me that Draco is indeed there. But when I come closer I identify the sounds as whimpers. Immediately the tension is back and I hurry my steps.
But do you know what I found out two years ago? Every magic person can carry children, even wizards. Seamus and Dean surprised us with inviting us after the birth of their first child. Shocked me actually. But I guess you knew, you grew up in the wizarding world after all. That led to a whole new set of thoughts flowing through my head. Firstly I can’t help but thinking that I could have had a child with you if I had ever gotten around to talking to you.
However I have been driving myself insane with anxiety over my grades for this semester (because I already screwed my studies up one time and I can't afford to do it again). So whenever I wasn't working, I was diving deep into escapism by playing games, watching asian dramas and kpop videos (I'm not sure how I ended up there either). I entirely forgot about updating.
She raises an eyebrow but writes the name down anyway, “Since I doubt he is in a state to be making his own decisions, what about his guardians? Have you talked to them?”
An alarm startles me awake about three nights after Draco’s adventure. The ringing of the alarm spell screams in my ears and through the house. I groan as I attempt to lift himself from my bed. This is the third time this night alone. A bleary look at the clock on my nightstand tells me that it is currently 4:27 in the morning. Yawning widely I dig himself from my covers. I nearly stumble on my path out of my room.
“Okay,” she steps forward, next to me, “Then let’s try to find the right one together, shall we? What are you looking for? Short hair? Long hair? Large or small cat?”
She nods and I hold the spoon to him. He just stares at it, looking what I would guess is confused. Even when I press it in his hand, he just stares at it. Eventually he lets the thing fall into his lap. I sigh, but before I can clean it up, he stretches his right hand out (the left still seems unresponsive) and dips the finger into the mashed potatoes, scooping some up. Still staring blankly, he puts the finger in his mouth, sucking the food from it. I blink while Hermione can’t seem to be able to decide between amusement and shock.
I watch him in fascination until someone puts a hand on my shoulder, causing me to nearly jump out of my skin.
“Great. I love my job and my kids,” you grin at me, are you somehow high? “You have a child too, don’t you? He’s in Hogwarts already. Orion was it, right?”
Once we have arrived at the riding hall, we follow basically the same procedure as the last time. Even from the steps Draco still needs one moment of pause with his knee on the horse’s back, but he is faster to move again this time. He straightens as soon as he sits on the palomino, more strength flowing into his thin figure.
I remember when I forced him to take a bath again. He didn’t really twitch, letting me undress him without much more than going completely stiff. It was better than I expected. Until I tried to take the dragon away that is. Since the thing is a stuffed toy I didn’t want him taking it in the water. But when I lowered him into the tub and put the dragon away, he started to make small, unsure whimpers in the back of his throat. At the beginning I hesitated but when he went silent and only curled in on himself, I relented. I put a water repelling charm on the thing and handed it to him. I certainly won’t forget the look of joy on his face when it returned to his hands.
He snorts and averts his eyes, trying to tear from my hold, but I keep him still, “I want out of here,” he growls, gaze turned away as well as he can, “It feels like the walls are closing in on me. And the garden isn’t enough.”
“That’s Daisy,” the shop worker explains, “She’s startled by nothing. A bit lazy perhaps but a nice cat.”
“While wizards are able to manipulate their memories, house elves are not,” Hermione cuts in, “They don’t have that ability and a wizard can’t reach into their heads.”
Suddenly he glares at me, “I don’t know my mother. Lou lives with us, she is like my mommy. She has been there as long as I can remember. But I don’t see how this is any of your business.”
“Friends?” his tone is incredulous, “Seriously? You rejected my hand in first year and now you want to be friends? After all I have done. Don’t take me for stupid,” he tenses even further which causes him to look like he is about to either run away or lash out.
“That’s nice,” she smiles, though still not with as much enthusiasm as before the beginning of the war, “I’m sure you’re hungry then after working the whole day. Come to the table.”
For a few seconds he glances up at me, his face partly obscured by his own long hair and Shenan’s mane. For the first time since I brought him back from Azkaban his mind is clear but I can’t read anything in his eyes at all. It doesn’t take long until I have to blink and he takes the chance to focus his eyes back on Shenan’s fur. I leave him in peace. When he is finished brushing, he cleans the brush, returns it to the box and grabs the tool for the hooves, all without even once looking at me. He ducks back under Shenan’s neck and lifts her first leg. Once again I watch him until he is finished but he does everything perfectly on his own.
I groan when she mentions that again and ignore the stares I get from passer-bys. By the time we have reached the top floor where Kingsley’s office is, I have caught myself and my determination is even stronger than Hermione’s. So when the doors of the elevator open, I am the one to drag my friend out. Luckily this corridor is empty until we reach the door to the minister’s office. Pushing it open we are greeted by his secretary.
“I’m not being pessimist here,” he looks up at me now, grey eyes hard, but shining with tears for the first time in all the years I’ve known him, “It’s true, simply a fact. My mind is too messed up to ever recover completely…” his eyes are averted again.
“That’s good,” I say as I lead her over to the couch to sit down and nonverbally summon a glass of juice, “So what happened?”
Shaking my head free from thoughts of silver-blond hair and grey eyes, I decide that there is nothing to be found in these papers anymore. At least not for now. So I will return to the passage of caring for the prisoners for today. Luna was kept there and I am long overdue of paying her a visit. So I clean up, putting the papers away. After a short visit to the bathroom and putting on some fresh clothes I apparate away.
She snorts, “You know I could take care of Draco now and then if you want some time to actually live your life.”
She looks at me a bit surprised, “Oh, there aren’t. All Malfoy children up until now are without siblings. Why are you asking?”
“No,” I immediately correct him, “You are traumatised, not insane. But alone the fact that I am talking to you now is great progress. Never before have you remained clear for so long. I know that you can recover.”
After he got used to it he started taking Dragon out there to play with the cat. He still has difficulties moving on his own, but crawling works good enough by now. What still troubles him is keeping his balance. From what I read horse therapy can help with that kind of problems.
“I just wanted to know. You always seemed so keen on beating me. You wouldn’t just stop like that.” Am I growing concerned over you?
One question though, I've got a few stories on my computer that are written only a few chapters in. I have always been reluctant to upload anything that's not finished, but that means it's likely those stories will never be uploaded.
“Probably no one would have been there at the Manor to keep Bellatrix from calling Voldemort,” he says hesitantly.
“It’s fine with me,” Michael shrugs and while I enter the dirty, damp cell, he steadies Hermione who looks mildly sick.
Since Draco turns out better than we expected and allows Dragon back on his lap after only about two hours of careful prodding by the cat and three fright moments, Hermione forces me to take a break two days later. It’s weekend anyway. I can’t think of anything else and I want to be close should something go wrong either way, so I decide to visit Andromeda. I haven’t seen Teddy, my godson, for way too long. We couldn’t bring him here after all, not without another adult and Draco is a fulltime job to begin with. The risk that he would scare Draco and cause some kind of attack was too high or even the other way around. No need to traumatise Teddy with his cousin who currently looks like a ghost.
I laugh nervously, “Nothing, I… Never mind,” I break off, “I have to get ready for dinner at the Burrow now. I’m sorry, but I have to hurry.”
“No!” I shoot around to her, “After what you just told me, he deserves a chance at a happy life even more. We can’t let him die like this.”
I only give myself a few minutes of let her comfort me until I pull away, “It’s okay. Let’s go make some tea,” I suggest as I get up, my own legs slightly shaky.
“But maybe we can show him that he has us now, so he will find something that is worth coming back to,” I suggest urgently.
After some coaxing I manage to get the blonde to stand up again. But his legs fail him after months without any movement. So I carefully sling an arm around him to keep him upright. He doesn’t react much more than setting bare foot before foot. He doesn’t show any recognition for Hermione or Michael but marches on as if he was blind. Howling raises in a few cells as they see their companion walking out of there but other than that we are left in peace until the elevator. The rise upwards takes even longer in my opinion because to me it seems as if Draco is ready to kneel over any second. When we step out on the highest level, sneers and insults are what greet us. Thrown at Draco. He still doesn’t react just hangs silently between us. Some of the comments stop as they take in his state. I growl at the prisoners. He seriously does not deserve any more than he already got. Slowly we walk through the corridor until we reach the room with the wands again.
I shake my head tiredly, “You have nothing to be sorry for,” I say softly, carding my fingers carefully through his hair, “I have nightmares too and honestly I would be more surprised if you didn’t have any. It’s fine, Draco.”
“Some do, but since when have we cared. We do what is right and most of the death eaters are as human as we all are. Even if the light side sometimes tends to forget that. Especially when they were forced into their role,” she explains, giving me a knowing smile.
“But what if they were death eaters? I don’t think they would have been too open about it,” I bore because I am sure that Spy A was a marked one, otherwise he would have never had so much information.
The time of the healer exam, Friday morning, finds me tired and on too much caffeine. But Draco had a relapse yesterday when a dog threw a fit close to the house while the other man was in the backyard. I wasn’t there and only got called out there by him screaming. The dog wasn’t anywhere close to him, but it still sounded loudly into our garden. I am not surprised he jumped and got scared. Nonetheless it caused a bit of a relapse and I spent the afternoon and most of the night soothing him and trying to coax him back to bed. He only fell asleep past three this night. Since I lost a whole half day of studying I had to make it up in what little time was left until I had to be at the school. Hermione only came back from a trip this morning, so I couldn’t call on her. She only arrived early today, looking as tired as me. During the night I have drank so many coffees I lost count long ago. I suppose I look half like a zombie as I stumble into the room.
And then the day is here. We will finally take Draco out into the real world for the first time. Lucky for all of us, the day starts out well. Breakfast goes by calmly and I let Draco spend the rest of the day as he wants to (that mostly means sitting out in the garden with Dragon). The only thing I insist on is that he eats each meal and takes a nap after noon, so he will still have enough energy for the riding session in the evening.
A bright smile breaks out over my face and I fall to my knees next to his head, fingers immediately in his soft hair, “That’s great, Draco!” I laugh, at least that gets him to carefully lift his eyes over the green fur a bit, “I am so proud of you. Yes, goodnight.”
Half an hour later finds me on my way home with Dragon happily laying in a transport cage. Since he is a nonmagical cat I didn’t want to force him through apparition already, so I am walking home. It’s not far after all. A twenty minute walk later lands me at Grimmauld Place again. I unlock the door, walk in and set the cage down. I hear rustling from within, indicating that Dragon has moved to peer through the bars at his new home. Just as I am pulling off my cloak, I hear footsteps coming down the stairs. When I look up, my eyes catch with brown.
“No, you don’t have to be there,” I reassure him, “If you don’t want to or it’s too much for you, you can stay in your room or the garden with Dragon. Does that sound good?”
“I don’t remember how it felt to win my first horse competition. I don’t remember what the purple flowers in our garden smelled like. I don’t remember the Yule Ball in our fourth year and not what happened with Buckbeak. I don’t remember what Severus did for my ninth birthday nor…” he pauses, “Nor how my mother’s hugs felt, no matter how rare they were.”
“Yeah,” I nod, “Can you do me a favour and take the food to the living room? I will get Draco. I would like to get him to eat something before I leave for the lecture again.”
I stretch my arms up after a chapter about a particularly nasty illness. My ears catch Draco’s humming and I have to listen closely to identify his words. He is singing some nonsensical children’s song about a ‘Dhalia’. It takes me a few moments to remember that that was the name of the cat the Malfoys used to own when he was very young. I am just about to relax when his tone changes from his childish voice to a more clearly pronounced version. Straightening I listen closer for any sign of distress, only to realise that he isn’t afraid but sounds like he did when talking to Shenan that one time. I smile at his progress.
“Fuck!” I curse as I kick the first thing I come across in the hallway of Grimmauld place, a wooden chest, which promptly earns me a hurting toe in addition to the already shitty day.
“No, not yet. He has lost nothing of his fear of strangers. I am not sure it wouldn’t have an adverse effect. But I have thought about getting him properly examined soon. Just not at St. Mungos.”
Reading that, I immediately turn around, my feet leading me to the blonde’s room automatically. The door is slightly ajar so I push it open. But nothing is out of the ordinary inside. Draco is laying on his side, thin body curled in on himself. I tilt my head, normally the blonde sleeps on his back. Smiling softly, I walk over to the side of the bed and kneel down in front of the other’s face.
Until I spot a very familiar blond head. Immediately I shoot around. And there you are, Draco Malfoy. Standing in the middle of the crowd, bowing down and ignoring every disdainful look you get. To my surprise I spot a small boy as the reason why you are crouching. He looks about eleven years old, I guess he is beginning Hogwarts this year. He has your beautiful white-blond hair and your pointed face, but his eyes are a bright green which seems vaguely familiar as well, but I can’t place it.
“There were some, I guess,” Mr Weasley concedes, “Some lower ranking death eaters who were forced into joining and decided to stand against the dark lord. As far as I remember it were four.”
Dragon uses the moment the blond pulls him away a bit to scramble over the man’s arm up to his shoulder to settle there. He curls around Draco’s neck, looking a bit like a furry neck-warmer. It’s by far not the first time I have seen this but I find it cute every time. Teddy though is already bored again and sorting Draco under ‘adult’ (not that his mind is much further than the toddler’s but Teddy can’t know that) which means he is allowed to go into the backyard as long as he takes him. So he tugs at the blonde’s leg again. Hand clutching in soft white fur, grey eyes turn back to the child who distracts him from his panicked staring at Andromeda.
In the end neither Andromeda nor I notice how much time has passed until I hold up a hand to stop the flow of her words when I think to hear soft feet padding down the hallway towards us. And indeed a few moments later after listening to the steps getting slower the closer he gets, a white blond head pokes carefully around the doorframe. As soon as grey eyes land on Andromeda he tenses again. Nonetheless he finally steps inside. Only then do I notice that he has Teddy cradled against his neck, holding him in a way that one arm is enough to keep him safe. The toddler’s eyes are closed.
Sighing the brunette lets herself fall down on the sofa beside me and takes my hand, “What happened, Harry? What punishment did he get?”
“Look, I know, and I understand you. I am serious,” she seems desperate, “But this,” she waves the list in front of my face, “is bad, like really bad. Draco is in a really awful state.”
“I know,” now I can’t help pulling him to me, “Believe me I know. But I also know that you can do this and overcome your trauma. You have made it so far already,” I feel a bit like a broken record by now, but if it helps him heal, I’m happy to repeat it every day again and again.
Luckily I don’t have to wait much longer until a woman in her early thirties clad in simple riding clothes rounds the corner. Dark blond hair is braided loosely past her shoulders and the smile seems a permanent fixture in her tan face. Bright blue eyes are assessing me with a curious gaze. I can see the ends of a long silver scar above her right wrist where the sleeve doesn’t quite reach anymore. Nonetheless she smiles as she approaches me, shaking my hand in a greeting.
“Then you help him get up again and he will give it another try. You said so yourself, he’s a fighter. Now it’s your time to believe in him,” she smiles as she motions to the other boy.
I awake the next morning from a fitful sleep. These empty grey eyes have been dancing through my dreams. I groan as I roll over and my feet land on the cold floor. The house is eerily silent. Hermione left last evening after a short talk about our next steps, so now I am alone with an apathetic Draco. After a short morning coffee to wake myself up, I decide that this is my next goal today. Find out how bad Draco is and at least get him clean for now.
Hermione giggles, “That’s true. But you should go catch your toddler before he hurts himself or causes some kind of ruckus.”
“You know as well as I do, that you can’t go out into crowds yet. And St. Mungos means a lot of people,” I explain.
Teddy squeals with excitement when he sees me. Andromeda hugs me before we settle down for tea. The little boy ends up with his face full of chocolate from the cookies but it doesn’t do anything to diminish his happiness. Nonetheless, in typical toddler manner, he loses interest in mine and Andromeda’s conversation pretty fast and pads over to the empty space close to the door to play with some of his toys. Even though he is basically out of my line of sight, I don’t worry because I know there are so many wards and diagnostic spells installed here in and on the living room because of Draco that anything wrong would be registered anyway. So I don’t notice our new visitor until Teddy squeals.
We do still spend some time wandering mostly aimless, but with the strange device we at least manage to find a direction. In the end we land in an area of housings with several small side alleys. There the device tells us that we are in the closest radius.
Hermione laughs, “Yes, you’re right. For now enjoy that peaceful picture. By the way, Dragon seems to know exactly what Draco needs. It looks like you chose the perfect cat for our patient.”
“Fire hurts?” I repeat, frowning, but in the end I decide to put that aside for now. Another look flitting back to the fire causes an idea to spring to my mind. I bite my lips, undecided for a moment, but it seems like a good next step. So I reach out another hand out to Draco, without trying to touch him this time, “This fire isn’t bad, don’t worry,” he doesn’t look convinced so I change the subject, “Would it be alright if we had some visitors?”
All in all Dragon is a good next step and Draco’s responsiveness is slowly increasing as well. He is relearning to walk on his own. We are making progress, in tiny steps, but we are. The blonde has gotten so much better in the three weeks since we got the cat, that I have been considering starting the horse therapy soon. But of course I should have known. It was going too perfectly and new problems wouldn’t be long in the waiting.
