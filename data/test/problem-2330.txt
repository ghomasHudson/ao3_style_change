Harry was trying to absorb as much information as possible, but knew that he would have to get a Pensive to re-watch all these memories again.  The Chieftess goblin was shuffling yet another stack of papers around in front of her, when a motion out of his peripheral vision caught his eye. It was another goblin with two humans following in toe. Wide eyed, Harry realized it was Bill Weasley and his wife, Fleur. The Chieftess ignored there presents though, and Harry was forced to so as well. Taking out some parchment, she handed over some documents, " here is a quick rundown of some of your estates, investment, net worth; you'll see we already deducted the payment of damages when you broke into the vault, the escape, and Death Gratuity of the families of goblins killed during the breakout." With a rye smile the chieftess continued. "You have made some goblins very happy, indeed Mr. Potter. You, are responsible for the payment not your two friends, as they currently do not hold an account with us, and we goblins know they could never afford it anyway."
Maybe another owl with the instructions simply to locate the boy would do.
Hari’s words did nothing to ease Draco’s mind. His eyes opened wide. Draco wheezed out in panic,  “Oh, Circe! The media storm…they’re going to hate me even more…”
“Until we drop, it is.” Hari said only minutely worried. His feet would wear out faster than the limit on his credit card.  “All clear?” he said to Draco.
There's no stopping me
"He took me home. Locked me in my room for the first time. Hours later, he returned to let me out. He brought me to his private offices. A few of his friends were there. Nott, Crabbe, Goyle, a few others...He made me strip my lower half bare, bent me over his desk, and used his cane on me." Draco's voice was far away. "You know my fathers cane with his wand in the snakehead handle? That one. Father wouldn't let ma mère heal me. They scarred."
Andromeda chimed in. “Just a pinprick on your finger and in his palm will do. You will place your finger in his palm mixing your blood and his, this will ensure that the House of Black accepts him as your heir and blood. It is only required once, but to ensure the wards blood must be given of some capacity annually” Andromeda tilted her head in thought. “Not in this capacity. Too much fanfare if you ask me.”
Before he slipped into one of the first comfortable sleeps in days, he waved his hand and locked himself (seemingly) back into the cupboard until his aunt released him in the morning to make breakfast in the morning for everyone else but him.
Tongue in cheek Andromeda glanced at her sister and nephew. “Uh-huh.”Draco refused to make eye contact.
You and I we sent each other stories
"Draco darling, I don't think you realize you were born to be a Queen. His skin is so clear and look at these cheekbones, my Marry-Alice?"
“Father combined your vaults with the Malfoy vaults after I was born. He took advantage of a loophole in your prenuptial…” Draco trailed off as Narcissa bolted up from the cot, growling in her displeasure. Her eyes swirled with pearlescent colour.
When you get home, now
"Before you sign those papers, I must add that you may be able to change full benefactory if you produce a blood heir. As of right now, you are the benefactory of the Potter and Black vaults, but if young Edward Remus Lupin had been born before Sirius Black wrote his will, Entailed Estate clause would have seen to it that Teddy inherit the Black vault instead. You can change these documents to reflect an even split between the vaults, so any rivalries won't develop over who inherits what. Would you like a general contract of what we just discussed drawn up now, and changes can be added on at any time?"
"My little, Dragon." Draco translated for Hari on a sigh.
Draco would not have called Crabbe and Goyle close friends, although they spent over ten years together, they were not on first name basis. Their families had arranged their meetings pre-Hogwarts years, with clear expectations. Malfoy’s do not have friends they have people indebted to them. Draco had an arrangement with them; they would be Draco's lackeys and bodyguards, and in return Draco would help them pass their classes and get better than Troll on their OWLs and NEWTs. Draco remembered that Severus had given Crabbe and Goyle detention the first day of sixth year for not passing Potions to move onto NEWT level class. Either way, Draco owed some kind of responsibility to the two boys who would never grow into men and gain their inheritance; they chose to follow Draco and died because of it.
He couldn’t go back to the Weasley’s; it was too depressing with the death of Fred looming over everyone’s head. He didn't want to go with Hermione to Australia looking for her parents after she Obliviated them in order to protect them from the fallout of the war.
"S'not funny..." Draco slurred.
He wanted everything to be perfect for Teddy's surviving family. He, Kreacher, and even Andromeda put a lot of work into fixing up the place. Andromeda knew quite a few charms and spells to refurbish the rooms, but didn't have the magical stamina that it took. Anything she couldn't do herself, or teach Hari how to do, they left to Kreacher. The townhouse had slowly turned into a home, room by room.
He cast while shoving his glasses up the ridge of his nose.
"The portraits didn't like how the House of Black was owned by an outsider, so I took down their portraits. I won't take crap from anyone in my own home, dead or alive." Hari said on a warning. "The boobytrap is on the front door, it can be avoided by just keeping to this side of the hallway. The formal dining room is through that door, it fits up to twenty people or so. There is a small bathroom to wash up before meals, and that doorway across from the bathroom is the stairs leading down to the basement." Hari turned in that direction, but Draco's comment made him pause.
"I thought so too, until I looked at the address in the Book. Do you want to know where it says he is lives."
For one, there is nothing his aunt and uncle hated more that Harry asking questions. In fact, what he knew about himself was pitifully non-existent. When he was fifteen months old he was orphaned on his aunt and uncles doorstep after his parents died in a car crash that left the uniquely lightning bolt shaped scar above his right eyebrow. That was all he knew about his existence in the world.
Hari sees Draco naked and scaly. ;)
“What? No I didn’t. I just wrote what the Chieftess told me too.” Hari fumbled around his words.
“And do you Master Potter-Black swear to uphold your duties as godfather; to ensure the welfare in all that entails of health, happiness, and fortune?”
Of course. How could he be so utterly idiotic to forget the portrait of Hari’s Godfather and his second cousin, Sirius Black.
"But..." Draco began on a hiss as he stretched his long limbs up to the sky. "I'm not the only one who misses his godfather. You miss yours too, right Hari? I am sorry Sirus was killed. My aunt Belatrix was boasted about killing him. Did you know, he was innocent all along?” Draco asked hesitantly.
"Hey, Hari!" Draco said as he cuddled into Hari's chest on the floor. "You know I love you right? cuz, I don't think you do." He looked up at Hari with drunken giddiness. "You don't see yourself as I do, Hari. Your brave and loyal, instinctive and resourceful, sassy and witty, compassionate and selfless, and bloody gorgeous. Those are all the things I love about you."
Sheryl then spoke over Draco's head to Hari, "We will work on your man, Hari Cub." Sheryl said wagging her finger back and forth between herself and Alice. "C'iemone and Arlys, you two work on my cub” Sheryl instructed.
Hari’s mouth popped open like a guppy. The white hot rage he had felt in the confined space of the parlor drained away to unexpected shyness. Flushing red, Hari hid his face in Draco’s welcoming chest. A giddy smile threatened to spread across his face as he remembered the secret confession he heard between mother and son. Struggling with his emotions, his eyes glanced up shyly to search Draco’s eyes. He desperately wanted the words to be true and for someone to love him, as Draco claims to do. Strangely enough, Hari began to believe him.
‘Maybe I can make
“No thank you, Dot. That will be all.” Narcissa says in response, taking a tiny stopper and putting out the flame.
Draco's eyes popped open and a mascara brush poked him in the eye, making his eye water and the whites turn black. "Bloody buggering, shite. Fuck." Draco spewed out.
“Re..
"What's in it for you? Why did you help me?" Trout narrowed his eyes at the gaunt face of the kid with big green eyes behind rounded glasses.
Hari won as luck would have it. Though his body still seemed to be in shock, trembling every now and then. Draco cut Hari off after his glass of very nice chardonnay Champaign. Draco's own dragon metabolism burned off the affects of Muggle alcohol readily, though he'd still get drunk if he consumed too much.
jinx?”
'Fuck no. Sooner than that. We are planning a house warming party. The date hasn't set but it'll be soon. The house is nearly presentable. We need to add extendable rooms for guests. My grandmother once had them up, apparently. You'll both get an invite then. Look for my owl."
Hari had a betrayed look on his face as he hopped down and bolted for the the half-door beside the counter and glass display of sweet goods ready to be sold. He ran towards the archway leading to the back room.
“Do you want to be freed? I could free you, offer you a wage instead…hic… like Dobby.” His mumbling was becoming incoherent, and Kreacher was barely able to understand the drunken and slurred rambles of his often too serious and depressed young master. Mostly Kreacher was ignoring him, focusing on getting a pepper-up potion, and hang over cure ready for him. He tuned in just in time to hear any barkeeps worse nightmares.
"Well, well, well. Look what treasures the Niffler drops in our laps, Cho Chang as I live and breath." Said a deep timber voice. Hari looked back to see that Blaise and Draco finally joined him. Now them. He couldn't say he recalled ever talking with the dark skinned boy before.
As they walked closer to the desired location to meet, Hari became more jittery. Draco had a hunch that Hari might accidently on purpose fire a curse at his friend upon arrival.
Draco nodded eagerly. He handed over the book so swiftly he nearly conked Hari in the head with it, before turning over with a content sigh, rump presented to the open air. Draco was eager to get to sleep so he could wake and be able to kiss Hari. It never even occurred to Draco that Hari might be lying. Hari never lied.
“I am sorry, Hari. If I could, I would have taken you in and taught you wizard customs, spells, and magical theory.”
Said chins were raised high as judgmental eyes were upon them. They came uninvited and unwelcome; Mrs. Goyle and Mrs. Crabbe blamed Draco for their son's deaths and Narcissa for betraying the Dark Lord at the crucial moment in the war which ended in his defeat. The rest of the cortège stood equally quiet in their hostility, the reason for their silence due to the presents of two scarlet robed Aurors standing stoic in the background. After they pay their final respects, the Malfoy's are going to turn themselves in, turning over evidence against known Death Eaters and their accomplices. The Malfoy's decision would have lasting percussions on all gathered; some of whom were innocent, staying neutral during the war, while others had either taken the dark mark, or are the spouses or children of Death Eaters.
Keeping the relatively gentle silence, Hari kissed Draco’s lips softly. He responded against his lips. “It was unexpectedly tiring.”
I was rather impressed with how Potter handled himself. It’s not every day that a student could talk back to Severus unscathed. It was rather cool. I had to hide my approval behind the Malfoy mask like always. I think Severus should have given Gryffindor ten points for Potter’s cheek not taken them away. I wonder what he’d do next.

He fingered the cloak feeling the silky texture. It also didn't have a trace of magic, ruins sewn into the fabric, nor celtic knots in the lining. It was also said that a person couldn't survive the Killing Curse, here was the one exception. Is that how he survived, he hunted down the Hallows and became “the Master of Death.” Draco didn’t realize he had spoken out loud until Hari spoke up pleadingly.
The heightened sexual tension alone would erupt in a whole cauldron of problems for Wizarding schools and is why the terms are strategically designed so students graduate before their eighteenth birthday, successfully avoiding any hassles with students whom have any manifestation of creatures’ blood and their inheritance.
It was magic.
"Okay, then if pure-bloods are not a pure as they'd like everyone to believe then why are you or anyone really alright with creatures' blood?"
For the initial part of the ritual, Narcissa held Teddy, while Hari and Andromeda met on either side of the cauldrons, their arms reached over to clasp forearms. Draco stood as a silent spectator.
"Emmet, I told you not to do that." Alice hissed. "What are you doing here? I thought you didn't work tonight and usually you are at the bar."
Hari laughed. Draco sulked.
Glancing past the lodes of cars on the pavement, he saw the pale figure of his boyfriend next to an equally tall but dark figure of Blaise Zambini. They were both laughing and leaning into each other, their mouths moving a mile a minute.
sounded again as he worked the blinds, shutting out the outside.
Hari REALLY doesn't have anything to wear, so he decides to ask Draco for advice. Things don't go as planned.
A quick toothed smile was shot in Draco's direction and Draco tried to return it, but his foot hit a lone bottle and sent it skidding. The smile left the boys face whose eyes widened in panic.
Andromeda’s smile was wide, and her eyes were warm and kind. “Aren’t you proud of all the work we’ve put into restoring this place? The Order member’s would be impressed with this place, having seen the disaster it was before. And wouldn’t you like to see your friends?” Although Hari didn’t know the calming effects of betas, he certainly seemed to take to the gentle persuasion. Or perhaps he just missed his friends after a month without them.
“My cousin,” Draco said.
"Don't know!" Draco answered, he hadn't been paying attention to any of the other members of the group except Hari and the surrounding club.
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger
"I don't know what that means!" Draco said and Hari laughed even harder as they made it to the ground floor. Draco laughed nervously as he looked around. This floor was still a bit dark and dusty, and it was evident that portraits use to hang on the walls of the long hallway.
“What is this all of a sudden, Hari?” Draco asked surprised.
The Wonderful World of Harry Potter, the characters and images all belongs to the amazing mind of J.K. Rowling and no copyright infringement was intended in the creation of this fan fiction.
Dudley began to cry, loudly and obviously fake, in Harry's mind. Dudley hadn't cried in years, just found that he got his way if he wailed loud enough.
Hari sang about war.
“You want to victimize him based off of the family he was born into?” Hari asked incredulously. “That is just as bad as he degrading you and your family for being poor. What about Andromeda Tonks? She was born a Black, a pure-blood, whose family supported Voldemort’s regime in some way or another. Are you saying she shouldn’t be trusted because of her family connections? Wow, I seriously misjudged you.” Hari really didn’t want to say these things; he was playing devil’s advocate.
Hari looked uncomfortable. "A night club in SoHo. They offer Yas! Night. Customers perform karaoke and er...dress up."
“It is a simple spell, really Corbeau. Stops your body’s bowel and urinary tract , nothing to worry about, I know the counter-curse as does Draco.” Narcissa explained hurriedly.
Draco rested his pointy chin over Hari’s head, and mused quietly to the boy in his arms. “Huh, the killing curse...but you know love, you can’t
, Latin for "Strength through loyalty"
elbows shaking his unruly black hair from his eyes, breath panting with adrenaline and nerves, he looked down his body to watch Draco advance on him, covering his body with hot weight and rippling muscles.
. And Andromeda knew why he was there.
Oh I wanna dance with somebody
Marry-Alice or just Alice was a hyper little thing. She didn't stay still. Her hands moved just as fast as her mouth when she spoke. Blaise had been right when describing her as pixie-like. With those blue streaks that reminded him of nasty Cornish pixies that Seamus had laughed at Second Year. Them being native to Ireland and them being not all that uncommon.
Hair suddenly spoke up interrupting his musing. “Are you ready? I, ah want to beat the crowd in Diagon Alley. To you know…er … not get mobbed.” Draco had to stop himself from laughing, were did Hari’s articulateness go. He settled for a smirk.
He gave a frustrated sigh as his too tight, and worn out trainers pounded the pavement as he ran away from the 4 bedroom, one bath, and one tiny broom cupboard house that he had the misfortune to call home for the past 9 years. Around the bend was a dead end cul-de-sac that made up Mongolia Crescent and Mrs. Figgs, just passed on Wisteria Walk. If Mrs. Figgs hadn't broken her leg today via Mr. Paws her abnormally large and slightly wild looking cat, Harry would have never went to the zoo and met Kaa. As it was he was most unfortunate to not have to sit through another boring day of listening to her drone on about her prize winning cats, eat stale cake, listen to her god awful piano, and cough up fur balls floating in the air from her cabbage smelling house.
Dumbledore would have to hear about this.
Maddening enough, you know what he said when I blurted out Harry's name. He said, and I quote. "God damn it, Draco you need to stop obsessing over that Potter boy already. It's not healthy."
Third, scent helps to identify property; by scenting and in turn others scenting you, you are making a claim on what belongs to you, who you claim as friend, family, or lover, and who in turn claims you. Being able to identify the property of an individual is key, because people regardless of gender will advertently (alphas and omegas) and inadvertently (betas or unpresented) scent their belongings. Even if betas and unpresented individuals do not have the adaptive nose structure to smell these particular scents and pheromones they do have them and can scent their belongings by proximity and vice versa.

Squaring his shoulders, he raised the contents of his hands in the air.
02 September 1991
The only thing he could think of was that he hoped tomorrow wasn't too late.
Potter lay collapsed on the ground beneath Draco, trapped beneath his deadweight, inadvertently locked together for the unforeseeable future, until Draco’s knot released enough cum to shrink. With each short spurt of cum, Potter shuddered as his prostrate was over stimulated.
Draco suddenly stood up as well. He made his way over to Dudley. Cho was clinging to his arm like an exotic ornament. He stretched out his hand to shake. When Dudley grabbed it in a firm grip, Draco rammed his other fist into Dudley's nose with a satisfying crunch. Hari heard it from where he was sitting, as well as the gasps from everyone who witnessed the punch, and the gasping laughter from Blaise.
"What time does the Karaoke start?" Hari inquired to Sheryl who was surveying the dance floor with a predatory glint in her eyes.
Smoke permeated the air, bringing with it the most enticing smell of charred vegetables. Hari had an eager grin on his face as he shoved vegetable after vegetable onto his plate. Large blackened mushrooms, chunks of carrot, onion, and  zucchini. Draco accepted the plate half draped over Hari on the soft blanket.
Then a flick of a curtain showed out of the second floor right window, a wrinkly old hook noose, shallow eyes, and giant leather bat wing ears briefly appeared through a gap in the curtains; Kreacher, Harry Potter’s batty old House-elf was in residence.
“Draco… When I…when I learned what I needed to do to end the war, I wasn’t scared, I was relieved.  I didn’t expect to come out of the war alive. I wanted to die, and was willing to die. My life hasn’t been easy, Draco despite what you or Snape believed. No, my life has been full of one mistake after another, miserable and hard. All my life I had to fight for something, anything to hold onto. The running mantra in my head had been survive; survive the year, survive the war, hell most of the time it was survive the day or even the hour, minute, or second.”
"Our Dragon, burned down the Manor during his manifestation." She explains. Hari looked to to Draco to see a definite blush on his high cheekbones.
Take care, TCB
Draco nodded, squeezing Hari tight to his side as the other couples were doing with no qualm as he wouldn't be recognized here.
He was alone. There was no one in the room with him. The only people in this house were on the floors beneath him, he was sure of it. So, where did the sound come from? Flashing teeth and claw, he looked maddly around for the source of it, before they landed on a portrait next to the wardrobe.
“Ahem.” The sound of a throat clearing caused Draco and Hari to pull apart startled. Draco peeked around Hari and flushed at the sight of his mother in the doorway.
"I told you so, Albus. You old coot. You wanted him there.
After checking his appearance once more in the mirror, fixed a few out of place hairs, and smoothed down non- existent wrinkles in his clothes, he made his way down the stairs. Instead of the ground floor, Draco found Hari in the parlor. “Why is it Potter that if you took the time to call in a Curse-Breaker, a Weasley at that, are we exiting through the garden?”
Petunia couldn't have known that by the time Christmas rolled around, Lily and James Potter were in hiding.
“That doesn’t matter…” Draco sputtered. “I told you about
“Stop, Draco before I stop” Hari half protested on an embarrassed laugh.
Nik reached across the counter to pat the officers hand. "Thanks, Paul." He said sincerely using Officer Sanderson's first time.

Those words terrified him. Taking a breath, Harry took some of his Gryffindor courage that he hasn't felt in a very long time, and jumped right into why he was there.
Moving about Diagon Alley unnoticed was proving to be impossible for Hari Potter, which is why he stayed away from the public eye after the funerals. He was angry that while attending many of his loved ones funerals, the press would follow him everywhere, focusing on him instead of the respect the fallen heroes deserved. Trying to quickly finish their shopping was impossible. Draco was nearly discovered several times, if it wasn’t for quick Quidditch maneuvering, Draco would have been discovered several times over. As is, he handily avoided being trampled over, knocked down, or elbowed in the face by an overly excited witch. Fed up with the crowed mooning over Hari, and frustrated that he was unable to make a claim over the popular boy savior over several matron witches and wizards bloody auctioning off their unwed, and some wed, daughters. Many of them were asking for confirmation that his birthday was indeed the end of July. No doubt, angling for when/if he comes into a creature inheritance. One woman even offered to be in a polygamous relationship,
"Can you show me your journal in the morning?"
As the heat slowly receded and the tingling faded away, Draco looked up to see Hari's eyes open and glowing with a soft green light. He blinked once, then twice as if coming out of a trance.
Sincerely,
Hari looked on his godson, so much like Nymphadora. He wished he could see more of his father's best friend in him, but knew that was more the fact Teddy is a Metamorphmagus. He scratched his head in mild irritation and shook away the sting of tears.
Warnings:  Rape/non-con tag for this chapter. Skip to the ***End of Smut*** break if don't want to read it, but you will miss Draco's creature inheritance in bold if you do.
Draco must have seen the disappointment on Hari’s face. “A wizarding village is out of the question with the current state of things.” Hari honestly never even considered a wizarding village to go shopping, but what was Draco on about?
The temptation was too great. Hari was so warm, so welcoming, so close...
"Oh, no is Hari going to freeze?" Alice murmured.
“Your guess is as good as mine, but I’d imagine Muggle-borns. They always create complications in our society by incorporating Muggle rules with ours.” Draco said, suddenly fuming. “Did you know that most pure-bloods are not even Christian, but since Dumbledore has been Headmaster at Hogwarts, we celebrate Christmas instead of Yule times? So much magic has been lost, because the younger generations are losing the knowledge of ancient magic’s.” Draco huffed.
Like the stained glass doors, the wardrobe too was enchanted, holding triple its length in clothes. He opened the doors and idly searched through his clothes with a flick of his wrist and a soft whoosh of hangers. He discarded options almost as soon he came across them.
Suddenly winded as if he were walking for ages, he paused to catch his breath. Kneeling down to rest hands on knees he peered behind him and he realized that he had just left his own room. Deductive reasoning told him the room ahead was Draco’s.
"Was your father in one of these factions?" Hari asked.
Harry flubbed out.
With a mighty roar of laughter from Hari the water games were on. They chased each other in the back garden, sun finally falling behind the wall to cast them in twilight shadow. They were positively soaked to the bone, muddy from a few slips on wet grass, and sides ached from laughter. Draco lifted Hari to dangle horizontally in his arms, one arm hoisting him beneath the knee the other underneath the armpit, and spun in dizzying circles. Water continued to spray around them from wands somehow still clutched in mud splotched fists. On the third rotation, Draco’s heel slipped and they came down hard in a mud puddle that splashed them both past their chins.
"Yeah, I guess I am." Hari mumbled, kicking the toe of his trainer.
Now it was Hari's turn to be flustered. "Well Malfoy, for better or worse, we are kind of like family now, and family is stuck with each other." Hari managed to get out.
"UP!" his aunt Petunia skreached, before he heard the sound of a brass chain once again scraping against the wooden door, this time by his aunt Petunia and not by magic.
Draco was the first to break the uncomfortable silence, already feeling like a scolded child under his mother’s gaze. He licked his sudden dry lips and tried to stay any arguments, “it wasn’t what it looked like. We were not doing anything…”
Draco wondered.
Sincerely,
Draco did something he hadn’t done in years; lean into her for comfort. His dragon hummed trying to sooth his mother, as she once upon a time did for him. It was the only comfort he knew how to give and it came from instinct.
Third place. I lost to both Granger and Pansy. Unbelievable. Did she not need my help on the final exams after all? Was she wasting my time?
"Harry, love? What are you doing?" Andromeda's voice startled him out of thought.
But no, Narcissa spoke then. Her voice, void of any emotion, “Lucious is dead.”
Now he is saying my godfather, Severus is trying to get "the stone" whatever that is, and get passed "Fluffy." is that some kind of guard dog. No. Severus would never steal from Dumbledore. They must be mistaken about the would-be-perpetrator.
Andromeda reached around Harry's shoulders, noticing him stiffen in her grasp, pull him closer and place a kiss at the top of his temple. Hugging him briefly, chin on his head, and hummed soothingly, trying to calm his nerves like she would her own child or grandson or distressed omega. "You can do that once we have packed up here and settle in Grimmmmm-hch. huh?" Clearing her throat she tried again, "Grimmmollowowow, what?"
Draco wasn’t delusional to place all his hopes and dreams on a one percent chance that Hari would present as omega, or that he would choose Draco as a mate, or even if the Wizarding World would allow him to even court The Hari Potter. Draco resigned himself to the fact that he would be the last of the Malfoy line, and thus it didn’t matter what Hari presented as, he would still put his whole heart into courting Hari. First he needed to get into his good gracious which meant putting up with Hari’s every whim. If that meant putting on Muggle clothes and going out into the Muggle world then so be it. He, as the Muggles put it, was truly on his way to becoming whipped.
A strangled gasp came from behind Harry, and he spun around to see Andromeda clutching Teddy to her chest. Harry immediately reacted, started to her side before halting at her next words.
“Mm-huh, sugar whatever you say. You’ve never brought home such a delicious looking friend home to us before or any friend for that matter.” Sheryl winked a gold eyeliner eye at him over the top of Hari’s shoulder.
"Wha...what was that?" Draco panted, holding a stitch in his side.
"Hagrid did great..." But he didn't sound convincing. He remembered the Blast-Ended Skrewts that were unsanctioned, bred by Hagrid, and not in the curriculum.
“Right, if you can’t be seen with me as I am, maybe dating isn’t such a good idea.” Hari’s spat out. His heart felt trampled on. Maybe being physically attracted to the blonde didn’t mean he actually liked him. He went to move away, but was suddenly slammed up against the wardrobe doors. He heard a growling noise close to his ears that he figured came from the stained glass door. He looked up, expecting to see Draco angry in turn, but found him in a panic instead.
The Wonderful World of Harry Potter, the characters and images all belongs to the amazing mind of J.K. Rowling and no copyright infringement was intended in the creation of this fan fiction.
“So, the rumors say. But I’d really rather not test that theory, would you?” He asked with a raised brow. Hari nodded his head vigorously.
"On the lips” Draco bargoned, faintly remembering the light brush of lips on his hair.
Nudging Draco back, he said, "Hey, that's all in the past, we have our whole future ahead of us."
A part of his dreamstate said, yes. The name, Draco literally meant dragon, and he was named after the constellation. Here they stood in a room full of stars. If he cared to look, he might discover that that particular constellation was absent from the night sky. The knowledge came and went passed through his thoughts like water and evaperated.
“I don’t know. I never had any, myself. What kind did my godfather like?” Harry asked with his hands in his pockets, and shoulders slightly hunched.
"Ooh where you Skyclad? I’d like to have seen that." Alice tittered.
I did hackle Weasel and Longbottom during the match. Poking Ron in his ridiculous bright red hair. I then made a bet on how long Harry would stay on his broom. Well, I was secretly betting on him not falling of course. Then Longbottom had the nerve to say that he was worth twelve of me. Preposterous. I told them that Gryffindors make the Quidditch team because people feel sorry for them, Harry with no parents, Weasel twin's with no money, and Longbottom should join the team because he has no brains." I thought it was quite funny.
It saddened Harry greatly that his and his godson’s names would never be on the tapestry. Did this mean they would never have a family to claim them, but each other? Both Harry and Teddy were left orphaned in this world due to the First and Second Wizarding Wars. Not wanting to dwell on which cannot be undone anymore, Harry tore his eyes from the tapestry to look around the room in a new light.
The two house-elves bowed in unison, “Good morning Master Hari, good morning Master Draco…” The female house-elf paused, not knowing who the third wizard in the kitchen was, while the male said, “good morning filthy Blood-traitor William Weasley.” He then banged his head on the leg of the table numerous times between words, “Sorry Master Hari, Kreacher is punishing himself accordingly. Master, tells Kreacher time and time again not to call any of the Weasley’s Blood-traitor.”
The enchantments are tricky and they are patchy at best, only lasting a few short weeks at best. “It’s a Deathly Hallow, Draco.” That had Draco’s eyes bugging out, and his mouth unhinged.
Satisfied at hearing one piece of information about Hari from the source. Looking around frantically, and nearly dancing in place Draco shouted, "Dot!" and a tiny house-elf appeared in the entrance hall of the ground floor. "Bring me Sirius Black's portrait, the third and hurry it up." Draco said quickly and a bit harshly.
In every line of Hari's face he look and sounded like a solder whose came out of a war just a little bit bruised. His eyes spoke of a maturing beyond his youth. The lyrics spoke of finding camaraderie with someone they've persevered with throughout the war. It was a sad yet hopeful song about finding peace and recovering a piece of themselves they thought lost
The sight had his heart shuddering in his chest, for Hari had the most unhindered look of pure love and adoration for his own Godson. The infant, two months old, was laying on his stomach, arms sprawled out in front of him, legs behind, as he lifted his wobbly neck with great effort.
“Mistress wants Dots to flloos yous? Dots is doing so!” came the response.
The bathroom was large. Not as large as the prefect bathroom, but large enough that it had a bathing area separate from the toilet and double sink vanity, with a dressing area on the side. The giant lion clawed bathtub was big enough for two, brass pipes gleaming against red royal flush porcelain. There was also a very nice shower, separated by fogged glass to the right of the tub. Setting his bathing items on the bench in the sectioned off dressing area with towel closet to the left of the tub, he leisurely stripped out of his cum crusted clothes while he waited for the tub to fill up with frothed and scented water. Steam slowly filled the room.
Draco and Narcissa continued down the drive, Narcissa never faltering in her stride. “Mon petit, be a darling and grab Earl for me.”
"No, I think Mary is sick, so it's just Ollie." Emmet handed out the bar menu all around, gave them some type of device to signal the servers and left to the next booth.
Hari searched his now messy room in vain for a phial of dittany. "Of all the stupid, idiotic...augh!" Swirling around to face Draco on his bed, he pointed one trembling finger. "How could you ever attempt to take your life."
Becoming apprehensive at her lack of words and fearing that Andromeda would not at least allow visitation rights to his godson, he rushed trying to convince her to allow him in some parts of Teddy's life. "Look, Andromeda...or if you'd rather stay here, I will pay your mortgage outright, the back amount and the full loan, no strings attached, all I ask is that I be apart of my godson's life...Please?!" Once more he broke down on a sob, "Please?"
His eyes tore away from Draco’s hypnotic swirling irises and threw his head back. Gripping Draco’s hair now with both hands, he let loose, thrusting into Draco’s mouth.
"Oh that's interesting, did you know the Potter's had the antlers of a stag at the top of their family crest?" Andromeda questioned Harry.
“Took you long enough.” Harry mentally rolls his eyes. ‘Great, A smart alec!’  Asclepius is just like all the other ‘snakes’ in Slytherin Harry knew. ‘Harry you really should have known.’ He thinks to himself as he concentrates on the next step. Sweat was beading at his hairline, and trickling down his back. His neck hurt from bending over Kreacher’s ‘dead?’ body, his lower back hurt from leaning against the steps of the stairs, and his head felt stuffy and his pulse felt like the little drummer boy was tapping his tempo at his temples. Overall Harry hurt, but he kept following Asclepius’s instructions. He follows the warmth of his magic to his magical core, and sees with his mind’s eye, the wild frenzy of his magic, tangled together with its ends zipping and snapping with vibrant emerald green kinetic energy. The snake said to ‘braid and weave it into a coil’, but harry found it difficult to catch the magical threads and hold still long enough to braid together. It took time, and Harry wondered if perhaps he wouldn’t be able to save Kreacher, because he was taking too long, but Asclepius never told him to hurry up, it only commented with snidely remarks mixed with encouragement, like a mentor. Eventually, he was able to weave together a messy braid and bring it loosely coiled to the surface, slipping only few times on the ascend to the surface.
As for Hari, he found his nerves at having the Malfoy's living with him in home receding some. They were still there, plenty, but with a small truce between old rivals, perhaps they could even be friends. Hari didn't want to even imagine what his actual friend Ronald Weasley would say to that prospect.
"You, Malfoy. Me. Us, like this. Who would have thought I would be crying on Draco Malfoy's shoulder" Hari said with another wet laugh as he raised his head, sat back and tried to dry the remaining tears on his cheeks. Draco handed Hari a handkerchief from his robe pocket.
Alice jumped up kicking her heels, "Yes, yes, yes. It is on like Donkey Kong. Let's go. If we take the Tube now we can get the Sheryl's Place by five thirty-six at the latest. That gives us a couple hours to fix you both up, in something 'sex-ex-ey. And guess what? It's not just Yas! Night, it's also themed night." She said with a twirl and wagging finger and rocking hips.
Grimy portraits hung on the walls, the most prominent is an enormous portrait of Walburga Black, stuck to the wall with a Permanent Sticking Charm, and covered with a heavy curtain to try to contain her erratic screaming when disturbed.
p.s. Sydney’s Owl Emporium does not allow rental of postal owls internationally. It’d only be animal cruelty allowing one bird to fly across the the hemispheres twice. This owl can take the journey, but it has got to be exhausting for the poor creature.
His mother was the one who gave him this journal, over ten years ago. He was seven and he wanted to purchase a book, about every child's hero,
“Are you falling for me, Hari?” Draco asked. Lips encircled his head and Hari let out a garble of words he doubted Draco understood any of it. Shaking black dots from his vision, he tried to sit up and see Draco give him head. Dream or no dream, he didn’t want to miss any of it. He just hoped beyond hope he wouldn’t wake up just yet.
"Set your eyes to the stage and bow before our first round of Queens for the night!" The DJ began reading form the list. "We have; Queen Beryl, Queen Boudicca, Empress Suiko, Queen Daenerys, and finally; Mary, Queen of Scotts!" The DJ shouted and gave a sweeping bow. The crowd in the pit appeared to bow as well before screaming their approval as the five drag queens paraded on stage and showed off their elaborate costumes.
When Draco stood up, he wiped tears away from damp cheeks. “Come on Potter, get dressed. As appealing as you are without a shirt on, I can’t have you walking around bare-chested, you might start a riot.”
“It was my grand-tante, Dorea who invented Floo Candles.” Narcissa paused, “My great aunt.” She clarified for Hari. “We are actually related, you know.”
"Kreacher, we will be delayed coming home, have dinner ready for us, say...six o'clock? We need to go to Gringotts first." Kreacher nodded his head eagerly as he too disappeared from the room.
Suddenly Harry sees red and could not think of the tentative truce between house-elf and master, that had so briefly developed while looking for Horcruxes and on the run. All Harry could think about was all the wrongs Kreacher has caused Sirius:
He snuck out of his room like a thief, guiltily clutching his soiled pajama bottoms in hand as the laundry shoot was in the bathroom. He hoped he wouldn’t run into Draco in the hall. He'd probably die of mortification if Draco knew about his wet dream. But he made it to the bathroom and locked the door behind him.
Severus Snape looked up over a hooked nose with black expressionless eyes. "Minerva." He said in his smooth voice.
The room was framed by stars. No that wasn’t right. There were no walls, instead the room was open to... the cosmos with each constellation illuminated by their own starlight. And yet the
No, he was in Hari’s home, in Hari’s bedroom, and wasn’t that just convient how Hari’s bed was right there, inviting.
Letting the slight slide, she took the jar and added a few blackberries, making sure to squish them a little to mix the juices.
A hissing noise sounded from behind Draco and he turned to see a mass wiggle from the pile of blankets, before he realized the mass was mistaken for the pile of blankets was in fact, a giant snake. The snake uncoiled and rose to flick its forked tongue at the bird, maybe out of reach.
to doise his veins and put out the flames of his desire. Stroking himself between his clothes, Draco was just about to pull the throbbing length of his member, when a sound had him freezing.
She couldn't have known about the prophecy that doomed their fate.
"So they will come later then?" Hari asked confused.
"Ma'am, I'm looking fer yur nephew." Hagrid tried to be curious to the lady of the house.

“No.” Vernon growled down almost affectionately to his already overweight son. “I am talking about the unholy, unnatural Sodomites, homosexuals who caused the destruction of the Holy cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, of course. God created one man and one woman, to procreate, and build a civilized world…” Hari stopped listening at this point to fascinated with the look of the even for Hari at the young age of seven, what he thought as of “weird but beautiful people” across the street, some wearing high heels, some wearing fishnets, and others wearing eyeliner and other makeup that he had only seen women wear before. If only women were supposed to wear clothes and makeup like that, even though Aunt Petunia called these women trollops, whatever that means, then certainly men wearing the same must be “weird, freakish, and unnatural” as his Uncle Vernon said. Hari certainly hated being called that by his relatives so he would stay clear.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well I don’t want to sound harsh. I know you consider them family, but…” Andromeda hedged, obviously uncomfortable with the direction of this conversation.
Sanderson tilted his hat in a salute as he put it on. The bell above the door jingled as he stepped out into the morning. Nic hurried after him to turn the sign to open and once more open the blinds on the door to start his work day a little later than usual, but worth it, he thought.
. Draco thought as he followed Hari into the dim hallway. He angled his head to peer around Hari and down the long hallway, just making out the outline of the staircase as well as the vacant impressions left on the walls where numerous portraits once hung. He wrinkled his nose, resisting the urge to sneeze as he took a subtle whiff, trying to place scents and his ears pricked a little, trying to make out the sounds within the home.
Seriously guys, I'm still alive and working on this!
on him to erase this particular memory? How many more memories did he erase or alter on him, and why? Dumbledore knew about the neglect, the beatings, and the starvation, and yet he still left him with his abusive muggle relatives, for what,
That comment, so like the mother he knew, startled a laugh out of him. Taking his own handkerchief he kept on hand, he wiped his eyes and blew his nose. “Mother…” He half-heartedly scolded.
Harry snorted. "Uncle always says, 'don't feed the strays, boy.' something about responsibility and coming back to beg scraps. I'm the stray in this scenario aren't I?"
Narcissa threw a ripe blueberry at his head. Draco just swept the offending fruit from his hair and continued speaking in quiet tones. “So, what do you think?”
"WAIT! WHAT? ALL THREE?" Harry shouted as his wand movement moved so violently that instead of packing the clothes, he flung them across the room. "Andromeda, what do I do? They can't go to Azkaban. Mrs. Malfoy saved my life, and Draco...Draco...well he just can't alright."
April 2020 Update: Chapter 13 will be updated on April 20th. I hope to also have chapter 14 up at the same time. Subscribe to receive notifications about when that will be.
"Ma mère , calls me Dragon, or Mon Petit, or Mon Petit Dragon, or Mon Dragon Okay Potter. So laugh it up." Draco said giving up his secret, mortified about somehow not being able to avoid this confrontation, but not lying either.
Draco didn't realize he was that obvious in his staring. Fighting a blush, he took a deep breath, familiarizing himself with the scent of the house. He smelled his mother's sharp and spicy cinnamon scent. His Aunt Andromeda's breezy and lavender scent. He even smelled the scent of formula milk and clean linen from his tiny cousin, Teddy, but the scent he wanted was frustratingly absent and yet everywhere at the same time. He clenched his teeth trying to prevent a snarl. It was like every scent clunge to Hari; scents from the garden, the smell of freshly turned soil, and the smell of sunlight on his skin radiated throughout the house, with the underlying smell of fresh clean snow.
Piers Polkiss was a scrawny boy with a face a bit like a rat. He was Dudley's best friend and Harry knew him for all the times he held his arms behind his back while Dudley walloped on him. Upon seeing his friend he stopped crying at once.
He remembered how much she loved her husband, Remus Lupin. Even when he tried every excuse for her to give up on him; he was a werewolf and he was too old for her, but she never did give up on their relationship. And their newborn son…
“Dobby?!”
But then he looked into Andromeda's eyes and saw only silent compassion and grief.
"That's true, Potter. You are Teddy's godfather and that makes you my, what?  God-uncle?" He ended on a question, perplexed at the bizarre family dynamics that would be.
As they found themselves at the  entrance to the mausoleum, Hari looked around at the somber expressions on everyone's faces. He felt out of place under these circumstances.
“You’ve always been a pretty prat, Draco Malfoy.” Hari says with a look of awe of his face. His expression melted away. "Are you uh...I mean am I allowed to ask? Are you an alpha or omega, then?" Hari asked hesitantly.
Life was too short for what ifs and maybes. Harry didn’t survive his entire adolescence fighting a deranged murderer focused on world dominance and immortality, like some 1980 Muggle super villain. Harry certainly hadn’t survived a war, the killing curse twice, to wallow in self-pity. ‘I should see a psychologists, or a Mind Healer? -No’ With a shake of his head, Harry nixed that thought before it could take serious root. That’s all he needed, that damned Rita Skeeter getting a hold of that story. Harry could read the headline now:
He didn’t dare get caught in the shower with an ill timed boner in hand.
"Nononono, my sweet boy!" Petunia screeched.
After two failed meals, Draco settled for just having the house-elves deliver meals to his room, he'd starve otherwise. But now that his rut was over, Draco wanted to be anywhere but his room. Opening both windows facing the back garden, he aired out his room from the smell of stale sweat and sex pheromones.
Can you believe the possibility of me having a sibling, twenty years younger. They plan to do surrogacy. They hope for a girl and even have a name picked out. Three guesses Harry, as to what that name might be? However, they won’t be disappointed in a son. Monica, my mum, teases her husband about wishing for an intellectual child, nonetheless, seeing as the both of them couldn’t pitch a ball between the two of them.
Draco looked deeply into Potter’s wide and panicked eyes, and said quietly, “Scared, Potter?” before pushing his cock past the first ring of muscles.
Indeed, Harry was forced to do Dudley's homework each night, not caring if Harry finished his own or not. Uncle Vernon would beat him if he dared make better grades than Dudley.
Harry glowered. He knew there had to be a catch. Food was never just freely given to him.
Was it worth the long wait?
Harry shrugged off the praise not knowing how to take compliments very well. "Maybe I could write a letter to Kingsley, then. Maybe he could do me a favor. I'd owe him big time." Harry said.
Draco stepped forward, poking Hari’s chest none-too-gently. “You didn’t ask permission.” He said.
Hari seemed to pale considerately, "Fuck me."  Hari groaned.
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
"I've heard you hum a pretty tune or two. You're voice has got to be amazing" Alice continued to gush excitedly.
All that aside, he didn't really know how to break the news to his friends that he was considering dating a bloke and needed fashion advice—let alone that that bloke was Draco-fucking-Malfoy.
" Narcissa said sharply, "You look a bit peaky,
Draco had an epiphany. Did Hari Potter grow up Muggle? Was that it? Was that why he was oblivious to so many things? The whole wizarding world believed that he was tucked away, and sheltered. He had to snort at that statement. Sheltered? No, not with those bruises he tried to hide from everyone. So the Golden Boy was not raised in a wizarding household.
"On the contrary Mr. Potter, as chieftess of the United Kingdom, representing all goblinkind, I would like to off you thanks." The chieftess of goblinkind had a very expressive face, despite being blind. "You see, although you indeed broke into my bank, stole Helga Hufflepuff's Cup from the Lestrange vault, and destroyed it along with the Dark Magic placed within."
Focussed on the pale gold light in the cauldron, he nearly forgot that they had to close and exit the circle. Hasty he moved,  stumbling over his feet, he moved clockwise, the rings of smoke settling into the grass with a faint dewy outline.
kreacher mumbled to himself, as he spoke this last bit out loud.
“I know, I know. I had no business yelling at Andromeda like that. I wasn’t even mad at her. I was just mad. I don’t like when things are kept from me, or when people just assume things about me. I spent all my life with secrets and lies being held over my head. Don’t I deserve the truth?” Hari demanded. “I thought once the war was over these feelings would stop, but I… I am still so angry and confused all the time!”
‘I’m Dowager Malfoy now’ Narcissa was only a little shocked at being addressed as Dowager, 43 and already a widow. Her son is now head of the household and held all the power and control, something he lacked all his childhood. First with a domineering father like Lucius and later after the Dark Lord returned and shattered the illusion his father presented. Really, if only Draco had known Lucius was only a Beta. Narcissa could live with being a widow, losing her standing in the household; after all she got what she most wanted; her son safe, and her husband somewhere where he could not touch them anymore.
“Yeah, I have to set the wards before we go, though. I had to open them to let you in, but I’ll close them after you leave.” Hari said completely missed the color change as he still had his face buried in Draco’s shoulder. He stood up and within a few minutes of arriving he was bouncing back up the stairs to the first floor landing. Draco was still sitting, his eyes fixed on the departing figure. Bill was ruffling his hair dispelling dust. An accomplished Curse-Breaker in Egypt he got accustomed to getting rid of sand by the tons in old tombs, so a little dust or a waterfall of dust as it fell on him was no problem. He looked at Draco who was still looking after Hari. The situation was worrisome.
"Oh well, okay. Right. So why do you hate Muggle-borns so much?" Hari held his breath.
"Awe Mr. Potter, you have a very active imagination. Please continue your little fantasy. What would the goblins call Harry Potter the ghost, who haunts these walls? Harry-The-Boy-Who-...well didn't live to see the light of day again, is a little dramatic, won't you say?"
"Runaway. Ten years old. parents dead, abusive home. I was trying to get him safely to a shelter without the Child Services investigating too deeply to take him back to that place, wherever it was. But you spooked the kid, and he ran. Thinks I called the police on him or something. He probably won't be back."
"Excellent!" Sheryl exclaimed. "The cabs waiting outside."
"So you want me to have this, because..." Hari prompted. Looking at the cover, the back and carded fast through all the blank pages. It wasn't a very large book and it could fit in his breast pocket of his school uniform.
Hari kicked the toe of his trainers against the dust on the floor and sighed. He rubbed at his eyes which were scratchy from lack of tears he so desperately wanted to shed. He just wanted his life to go back to before fourth year. Everything that was a constant in his life since he discovered he was a wizard has been ruined with the war. Hedwig; his first ever birthday present and companion, murdered while still trapped inside a cage before plugging to the earth. His Firebolt; flying was the one thing that he enjoyed above all others too was destroyed the same day. And now his wand; he had his Holly and Phoenix feather core wand since the day he discovered he was a wizard. Everything was changing.
Hari moved further down the hall, nearly tripping on an oddly placed--
“You call, Hari sucking your tongue down his throat like a succubus, nothing?” Narcissa said over her son with a raised eyebrow.
You blocked the floo! Sending an owl is the only way to get a hold of you now. Do you know how expensive Owl Post is from Australia, Harry?
You are all so amazing and supportive. I am nearly to 1K subscribers.
20 June 1992
Hari wanted him. Draco knew it as sure as the sun would rise and chase away the night. He felt it this morning when Hari was crawling between his legs to get closer, in the eagerness of his returned kisses that afternoon, and only moments earlier, the tightness Hari wrapped his arms around his neck.
He marched to the curtain, nearly yanking it back before realizing his indecent exposure. Restraining his ire, he simply held out his hand behind the curtain.
"We'll put him back in a cell mark my word. Death Eater, son of a Death Eater. Their both Malfoy's it doesn't matter..."
Hari gnawed at his bottom lip again, unsure now that Sirius was awake what his response had been. He had always been able to talk to him. but this...
I'm going to be updating the tags soon to include Transgendered OC characters and pansexual relationships (Non-main characters). I always pictured Sheryl as a bisexual transgendered woman, and I explain what that means in this chapter. She is dating a pansexual woman. This is a sensitive subject and I am NOT an expert in all things LGBTQ+. I just wanted to be clear in case anyone takes offense to it when I say Sheryl drags them to a Drag Queen karaoke night. Drag is different than cross-dressing. If you want to tell me more about these two particular subjects, please do so. Derogatory or just hateful comments will be deleted. Thank you for your understanding.
“You know that Hari is not…,"
"Upon this night and upon this hour, blessed be by the Zenith Moon, name thee heir apparent to the Most Ancient and Noble House of Black, young master, Edward Remus Lupin-Black.”
"No, Alleycat. I'm clean. No drugs. Just food--vegetables. And cider or vinegar for that pickling." Trout said nodding to the still unopened mason jar in Harry's hands. "What you say Alleycat?"
The answer was an easy one. “I so swear.” He said with a large grin. Andromeda answered his smile with her own. Breaking the connections she let go of Hari’s hand.
He had so much to look forward to, his friends, starting a family with Sirius, finishing school. All the happiness that Harry felt just left him after Sirius was killed by Bellatrix, and Harry’s life went into an out of control spiral of death and depression. First with the failed mission to find and destroy a Horcrux with Dumbledore, nearly getting killed by a lake full of Inferi; corpses collected and cursed with Dark Magic to serve one master, Voldemort. That night ended with Death Eaters getting into the Castle and Dumbledore forcing Snape to kill him, so that Draco could remain innocent. Then Harry and his friends left school before they finished their final year at Hogwarts, leaving their friends and families behind.
Find out what it means to me
He turned, half expecting Aurors in red robes to be marching towards him. His eyes shifted frantically around, searching for what Blaise sees. Then he spies the all too familiar mop of black hair and round spectacles sitting at a trio of tables. His shoulders sagged in relief.
Hari said on a happy sniffle, "Alright, Padfoot, alright!" And forgetting Draco's existence entirely for the moment, nearly danced up the stairs to his room to have a quiet conversation with his godfather, whom he hasn't seen or heard since his death three years past.
"They can have all their gold back, I don't want any gold that was obtained through any shady businesses, that includes Voldemort stealing from his followers, willingly or otherwise."
Narcissa was both proud and scared for her Petit Dragon. Alphas have a lot of stigmas placed on them as they are stronger than the other secondary genders and they can become temperamental at a drop of a quill feather. This is a problem for newly presented adolescence alphas, as they do not have the control needed to interact with others rationally. They will be aggressive in their dominance of others. Her son did not need this extra pressure on his shoulders, what her son needed was to keep his head down and stay out of the public eye and gain the grace of his peers.
No, his mother would never have worn the heavy and dark makeup that painted his face.
The first to walk through surprisingly were two house-elves toeing a series of trunks via levitation charms.
to be Andromeda to cement the ceremony. As a Black by birth, the ceremony could only be conducted by either his aunt or his mother. When the topic was discussed, Draco remembered the creeping sensation he felt over his skin. As much as pure-bloods were accused of incestuous relationships, the idea of Hari as a sibling made him nauseous. Thus it was Andromeda, his aunt, and not his mother, claiming Hari as blood.
The Wonderful World of Harry Potter, the characters and images all belongs to the amazing mind of J.K. Rowling and no copyright infringement was intended in the creation of this fan fiction.
Hari needed some advice. His mind was just going around in circles.
“You make it talk by moving your fingers, and you move the puppet around in front of Teddy.”
, by you guessed it, Queen. Lets hear it for Padmé" The audience went absolutely wild.
"Uh-huh" Was all Draco could get out on a strangled gasp. He was desperately glad that his rut was over, otherwise he would have surely tried to molest the unsuspecting boy taking a vigorous shower next to him, if the amount of splashes against the glass door was anything to go by. Gathering as much Slytherin nearly nonexistent courage, Draco pulled the plug on the water, standing up he turned on the spray overhead desperate to rinse off. He heard Hari's teeth chatter briefly, and Hari's quick exhaled "Burr" as the water reverted to cold when Draco turned on his taps.
Harry swallowed, hesitating on entering, before turning to Andromeda, kissing Teddy once on the forehead, his hair a brilliant turquoise. He squared his shoulders and walked into the room. Inside was a room made of stone, it was cold and torches lining the room was the only source of light. Maps and scrolls lay on ever flat surface bare, jewels of untold riches acting as paperweights.
“Traditional pure-blood betrothals include a grace period while completing their education to begin their courtship and get better acquainted with each other before being wed. This is how it has been done for generations. This is how your father and I began our courtship.” Narcissa took a steadying breath before continuing. “Your father and I chose to break this tradition with you, because of what the Malfoy’s believed dismal circumstances.”
"Good, you do that." He got up after taking the last swing of the bottle and the creaking of the chair and the popping of his knees. "And, Petunia. Get rid of the vase. We can't have him know."
Draco thought as he watched Hari blush and struggle with actually getting the words out.
After Hari finished preparing breakfast and spent guilt free thirty minutes with his godson, who was getting quite good at lifting his head and looking around. He was still little and couldn’t do much, but oh what he could do with his godson he loved every moment of it. For instance, Teddy loved staring at his face, well that was true with everyone, but he wanted to delude himself that his godson thought of him special. He would often spend a lot longer with him singing, rocking, and tickling his hands and feet to see them clench and kick as if walking. He was positive that one of these days Teddy would soon be walking on air. When he brought that up to Andromeda, she tittered with Narcissa like school girls. Narcissa said soon Teddy would be able to see in color. Andromeda chimed in that once Nymphadora started seeing color, she would not only change the shape of her nose to match whoever was holding her, but she would often change her eyes and hair to match them as well.
"Now Queenlings, I need you to take a few more bites of food and hydrate with just water for a moment. And there are a few rules. Rule number one, don't accept drinks from strangers. Rule number two." Sheryl continued to tick off on her fingers. "Don't go to the bathrooms alone.  Rule number three, keep our group informed of your locations within the club. Rule number four, don't go off with strangers. Rule number five, don't leave the club without telling the group. Rule number six, especially don't leave the club with a stranger, and finally,"
That was the thing Harry was most afraid of; rejection. Wanting something so much and being denied it.
Hari didn’t know what made him decide to eavesdrop on the Malfoy’s conversation.
Draco tried to reign in his possessive nature, but as a juvenile alpha it was a constant battle. Draco set his jaw and tried to take calming breath. He had to remind his alpha;
“It’s like, a fetish, where you know—a bloke gives his girlfriend his shirt…except I’m not your girlfriend…or your boyfriend for that matter.”
Hari had only one answer to give. “ Yes, gods, yes.” Draco was already smothering the acceptance with heated kisses.
He nodded his head. “So back to this
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Balling his hands into fists, accidental magic caused wind to gust through open windows and doors. Hari snarled, “What do you know about living in a closet?” And without further ado, Hari stormed out of place like the fires of Hades were after him. He regretted his ridiculous outburst and the way he left things with the only person he considered a friend in the Muggle world. Hari wanted to kick himself. Sheryl was talking about coming out of the closest, figuratively, as in declaring himself openly gay;
“Ah, that was a very Slytherin thing to do. Protecting her parents and herself by altering their memories. They wouldn’t know who she is, if caught and in the meantime they wouldn’t know to worry about an absence of a child.”
"You could say that." Draco says leaning over to kiss Hari's cheek, looking side-eyed at Cho to see her reaction as he rubbed a thumb over the back of Hari's neck possessively.
Having a lay-in or a lazy morning wank was out of the question when he had to be up before the Dursleys if he ever wanted to finish the list of assigned chores. Hari counted himself lucky he did all the laundry over the summer so he didn’t have to be caught in compromised situations. They never questioned him running a load of laundry after all.
A boy stood beside his mother in the queue at the Leaky with suppressed anticipation. A month before his eleventh birthday, he received his letter to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Of course, his parents sent in his acceptance letter. Now nearing the end of July he was finally going to get his school supplies.
“Sirius had me! His godson!” Harry said angrily as he took a quick drink of the next fiery drink slamming the glass down on the wooden surface.
"Not unless you have a portrait of my godfather, Sirius Black."
"What are you blabbering on about, Potter? A diary. Please. I don't have a diary." Draco's ears were definitely red.
You are all so amazing and supportive. I am nearly to 1K subscribers.
"What the hell was that?" Draco echoed on his side of the door. The hand that reached out to touch Hari's cheek was now curled into a tight fist at his side. He painfully uncurled his fingers gone stiff from
"Why?"
"Sorry to bother you ma'am, but I'm here to give the final eviction notice to the residence of this property, they haven't been answering any of the previous letters, there is no telephone number on file, and the mortgage is over six months late." The stranger yelled rather too loudly over the baby's wailing, and the nosy neighbors across the street and next door heard every word the stranger said.
The look that came into Draco’s eyes Hari couldn’t begin to understand the meaning. “I may have wanted to ridicule you, humiliate you, knock you off your damn pedestal, and even cause you pain, but I…I never wanted to see you dead. Not ever Hari Potter.”
When Hari's sobs finally subsided, he remained snuggled into Draco's chest. The rhythm of his heartbeat was comforting against Hari's ear. The silence in the room was broken by a wet giggle.
"Drink up!" C'iemone advised. Thrusting a mug of frosty beer into Hari's hands. Hari looked broodingly into the drink, before shrugging and chugged.
Oh crap, his own limited experiences had not compared him for this. Unsure and floundering for words, "Draco, I don't see how you could have come to like me, but I am not going to reject your feelings for me...I am just unsure if I can return them." Hari said in a rush, looking at Draco's face for any sort of reaction.
His laughter sounded on the wind and floated up to a window left slightly ajar. Hari didn’t notice this as he continued to put the garden to right with a combination of magic and manual labor. Hari also didn’t notice the platinum blonde head that peaked out the window from above.
Draco let his fingertips glide over Hari's skin, tracing the line of his clavicle to his shoulder; shoulder to elbow, and finally rest on the starburst scar on his right forearm. Hari closed his eyes. He still remembers the pain in his arm where the Basilisk's fang pierced his arm, even as he pierced the Sword of Gryffindor through its skull.
When first perusing the list of magical children born in Great Britain between August 1st 1979 and July 31st 1980, there were 43 magical born children-- only 39 students have responded to their letters. One name in particular had not responded.
“Narcissa Malfoy, the Wizengamot has come to a consensus, all criminal charges are dropped, you were a victim to your husband and for that we are sorry, you are free to go home.” Narcissa was crying with gratitude as the shackles were removed from her wrists. She was smiling and crying as she rubbed blood circulation back into her hands. Draco was relieved, his mother was free.
Do you think the animal portrayed on each of the Founders house crest represents a Patronus or an animagus?
“What in blazing hell happened here?” Andromeda shouted, trying a failing to stifle a startled laugh. It was she who tittered and drew Hari's attention in the first place. The two boys were a mess to say the least. Water soaked through muddy clothes.
when Dobby dropped a cake on the head of the wife of his uncle’s boss.
Narcissa raised her eyebrows at the compromising position her son was in. Draco was sitting on his bed shirtless with his legs parted to allow Hari to stand between them. Even though her son was blushing from embarrassment, she could see the initial effects of
“Yes, it is quite fitting… how did you know that?”
“It’s from Hermione, she’s in Australia…”
"I forgive you." Harry didn't need to be forgiven, he did nothing that needed to be forgiven. Her daughter, son-in-law, and everyone else who died in the war, died not because of him or for him. Their lives and deaths were out of his control. But he needed to hear this. To know that he was not being blamed for the deaths of her own loved ones. The Savior needed to be saved, not from the monster of everyone's nightmares for the last few decades, but from his own personal demons. "I forgive you." She said again and hoped that by breaking down this one barrier, he would soon forgive himself.
Candice fled.
Rolling his neck and shoulders, Harry got down to work.
And gettin' caught in the rain
"Are there many snakes you talk to here, Hari?" Draco asked trying to prepare himself incase Hari has a pet snake that he talks too.
"Harry Potter! Harry Potter, Albus!" Minerva's voice was so loud it cracked in the air. "That is who I am referring to. Three letters have been sent to his place of residence and the owls have not returned to their roost in the Owlery."
sorry for the late update. I am really dissatisfied with this chapter. It simply wasn't coming together. But I absolutely wanted to post, since its been 'completed' for about a month.
"Thank you, Mr. Potter. I don't know what you did to quiet him down but thank you." Harry peered up at Mrs. Tonks. She was clearly exhausted, rings appearing under her eyes, wider and kinder than her sisters ever was, and wild curly chesnut hair, a frizzy mess.
He tumbled to the ground with another body of limbs not his own and rolled into the near by wheelie bins. There was a crunch and the sound of broken glass followed by a snapping sound. Draco feared he'd broken a bone, though he didn't feel any pain past superficial cuts and bruises he would have felt by falling off a broom. Maybe his adrenalin was too high to register the pain, was he in shock? That answer was possibly.
"What happened here?" Hari didn't know he spoke out loud until Narcissa answered, sounding quite amused.
He made the impossible happen.
, a handy hereditary spell that in combination with a strong
Andromeda didn't know what to say to the angry and hurt boy sitting in her arms. Luckily she didn't have to. They both felt the shift in the wards. Someone was trying to come in through the Floo Network and they were not authorized to come through. The wards were letting them know of that intrusion.
“I do. A small one, just for Hari;s friends and loved ones before you return to Hogwarts. It will be good for Hari. It would do Hari good to be with his friends and loved ones. It’s been a month. This way he can ease into it, before school starts. It wouldn’t do for him to have some type of mental breakdown from too much anxiety.”
He shared a bemused look with Draco as he moved back to his position. Andromeda had a particularly difficult task as she held her grandson cradled in one hand and the green candle in the other. Raising it high and securing Teddy closer, she began to chant her part of the ritual.
Hari had been the first to look up, his face a mortified red. Draco looked up a fraction of a second later and to the two above surprise, he busted up laughing. This caused a chain reaction in Hari joined in the laughter. Any attempt at stopping the hysterics resulted in a second of failed stoicism before a giggle escaped quivering lips, and the two continued to laugh.
If only he could control it, whatever it was.
Harry smiled up at Narcissa Malfoy, and for the first time in over a week he was glad that he made that decision to invite her to Grimmauld Place. Harry's Smile brought Narcissa out of her giddy school girl like response and stood up, straightening the wrinkles in her robes and clearing her throat. "Thank you, Mister Potter for allowing us into your home. I assure you, my son and I will be on our best behavior."
"Did you know Hogwarts use to celebrate Yule and the Sabbaths during the school year, but many of the Muggle-borns and half-bloods are Christian and wanted their holidays acknowledged. Now its just, Christmas, and whatever is Easter anyway, Hari? Bizarre." Draco said. "I like presents enough and the decorations are pretty." Draco said with a shrug.
"Yeah, well dangerous kind of Mad, like seriously crazy and Trout says he
Andromeda looked at Harry Potter;the Boy-Who-Lived-Twice, Savior of the Wizarding World, and personal friends with the new Minister of Magic himself. All she said was, "You will find you are more influential than you know."
I thought perhaps, it would be Zabini, seeing how he just stood back and waited out the confrontation. When I confronted him, he said, "good jinx, how about a
“When...when I told you about
When each ring settled around them, Andromeda told them to move counter clockwise until they returned to their own spots and repeated the chant: this time in English “We greet the sun, the light, the day, the dawn of today and tomorrow's forward.”
Dear Journal,
Hari paused
Draco Malfoy.
“Awe, well…” Andromeda paused, seemingly to Draco to have finally caught onto the rising anger in Hari’s voice. Draco had seven years of that anger directed at him to sense the breaking point was near. “Muggle-borns are permitted to stay at the Leaky Cauldron or other magical establishment and receive a crash course in some aspects of the wizarding world so they wouldn’t be too far behind the other First Years. It used to be that Hogwarts had Seventh Years sponsor Muggle-borns; paying tuition, books, and even tutoring them during the Holiday’s to complete summer homework. They would stay with the same Seventh year even after graduation, while the Muggle-born was finishing Hogwarts. But with Muggle-borns being targeted during the wars, that all changed. Dumbledore banned the sponsorship and it was never reactivated, even after Voldemort’s first fall.” Andromeda said.
Harry and Andromeda stopped nearly tripping over each other, or else crash into the goblin who stopped in front of a large circular stone door. Raising his finger he carefully traced an unrecognizable rune into the stone and watched like the entrance to Diagon Alley from the back of the Leaky Cauldron, brick began to shift and flip in on themselves slowly forming a wide arching doorway. "Enter."
charm. He sat in the cloned chair as Draco slipped into the original with ease. Dudley sat boggled.
a spell that will protect Grimmauld Place as a whole instead of just the windows. Harry’s eyesight wavered, and he became dizzy. Something was wrong, he’s never cast a protection spell over one area so large before, perhaps Grimmauld place was larger than once believed. He had to continue otherwise they’d just return with a vengeance.
Please note that the next chapter includes smut with rape/ non-con. It's only a sex dream.
The blonde boy glanced up from his companion to look around, revealing cool grey eyes on an emotionless face. He was just her type; tall, aloof, and sophisticated.
I'll add pictures later. I want an original of this one. Any takers? Let me know.
They are wonderful in that they don't really get my 'okay so it's an obsession' with Harry. They just said don't lose anymore house-points and then left me to my own devices.
He was all grey from his hair to the clothes he wore. His grey hair was long and matted, his beard scruffy. He wore a grey peacoat, over grey jumper, with grey scarf. His trousers were, you guessed it, grey and baggy with tears here and there. His boots had holes in them, held together with duct tape, and a socked big toe peeked out of the left boot.
Hari looked up intrigued, emerald eyes still shiny with tears. He mouthed a silent, ‘
"He goes to our Senior High. He's also underage. You should check his I.D." Hari added, hoping he remembered correctly that Justin's birthday was on the 13th of August.
Now for instance, Draco knew he was dreaming, asleep in his canopy bed back at the Manor, clade bare in silken sheets of emerald green and sensational sand beige; yet his dreams led him to the day he dueled Harry Potter in the sixth floor bathroom at Hogwarts, but the encounter played out in his dream a whole different route.
“Fine, fine, fine.” He said as he waited impatiently for Draco to get to the point.
Severus stood swiftly, swinging his satchel over his head. A swish of his wand had the final items gliding into the trunk and the locks clicked. He then shrunk the trunk and slipped it into his pocket.
“Show me what to do.” Harry said, as he clenched the lifeless form of Kreacher closer. In answer the snake unwound from the banister seamlessly and wound itself around Harry’s arm to rest its head on Kreacher’s shoulder. Harry listened to the lilted hisses of Asclepius with rapt attention as he continued to give instructions in parseltongue.
He wasn’t alone, and although Draco didn’t have a wand, he literally had Hari’s back.
“That’s all. You simply wrote to the Ministry’s Financial Affairs and Goblins Liaison Offices, and simply what?...arranged to have my gold returned, just like that?!” Draco said with a barely controlled laugh.
11 June 1992
Oliver or Ollie as Sheryl called him, was a lightly tanned skin man with an American accent. He had a narrow face with high dimpled cheeks. His smile was boyish and his neat bunny teeth smiled crookedly, almost sheepishly. His eyes crinkled in a smile and danced with merriment.
Dear Journal.
Hari was talking all the while, adjusting his voice, higher and lower at times, in what Draco could only mentally call,
His body lost the fight and his bones liquefied beneath him and his body collapsed.
“Tell me what’s wrong…I can help you…” Myrtle crooned from the cubicle next to the sinks.
Kreacher's big ears drooped as he hung his head. "Kreacher thought Master Harry Potter would be happy to have a family here. It's just the master, and old Kreacher in this big townhouse. Kreacher has nothing to do once Master Harry Potter goes back to schools." Kreacher appeared to be shrinking in on himself as he spoke, shoulders hunched, ears drooping, and head bowed.
"Not everyone is in drag!" Hari shouted over the music.
Trout only laughed in merriment and showed him how to cover more of his body to escape too much sun burn. Harry never liked the blisters and uneven tans he'd get from weeding or mowing the lawns anyway.
Draco leaned over Hari, close enough that his silver blonde hair brushed Hari's cheek. Hari blinked opened his eyes to stare into Draco's inhibited gray eyes. Draco said,"Don't worry these aren't the only scars I own."
On the fourth floor landing was Draco's room, whose room use to belong to Sirius. Hari of course vanished all the nude muggle posters of biker chicks, and charmed the room a different color. He didn't think that Draco would appreciate the Gryffindor colors of gold and scarlet. Although, he did think it would be funny to see Draco's reaction if he had left it exactly how Sirius did. In fact, Hari contemplated taking that room as his own, but it just made him depressed, besides he didn't mind taking the slightly smaller room that use to be Regulus's room. They would of course have to manage sharing the same bathroom, together.
Draco was chanting his name like a holy montra. ‘Hari, Hari, Hari...let me have all of you.’
“The drawing room,” A voice behind Draco murmured. He startled and peeked over his shoulder to see his mother, hunched against the wall much as he was, also eavesdropping. When he opened his mouth, Narcissa silently shushed him with a touch of fingers to her lips. Her ears, elegantly elongated with the slight manifestation of her dragon inheritance, pricked forward, listening. Draco smirked at the sight, knowing that Hari was still unaware of their inheritance giving better advantages of sight, sound, and smell…on second thought, Draco decided after taking a whiff of the smell of sour milk from baby poop, maybe smell was a disadvantage. He grimaced. His mother moved to suppress a laugh, but couldn’t hide the merriment from her eyes at his expense. He scowled at her.
“I know what you are doing, death eater spawn. Run along before I have the mind to tell my Godson what you were up to in his room.”
Andromeda stood to follow her sister out the room. She knew the kind of grief her sister was going through; afterall, she too was a widow. It is not easy saying the final goodbye to over 25 years of marriage. Loss of love or not, she could never reclaim that time they spent in each other’s lives, both a blessing and a curse.
The occupants were so different from the wixen parlours his father, Lucious Malfoy, sometimes allowed him to accompany while on business. Three elder witches sat at the corner table drinking sherry glasses, one of them contributing to the haze in the room, smoking from a long pike that expelled green smoke. At a large table, wild looking warlocks talking with raucous dwarfs and wizards arguing over the latest scholarly article of
Hari flipped on his back laughing, not hearing the intrusion. "So who did you masturbate to?" Hari grinned, having some idea of who that might be.
p.p.s. Here is all I know about the Inner-house Quidditch cup at Hogwarts. Each of the four Houses have their own team; Slytherin, Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff. There are six matches played to determine who would win the House Cup. The House cup is a giant silver trophy with four handles in the shape of the house moscotts. The Cup will be displayed in the Head of House Office of the winning team. The winning team is determined by who has the most point, so it is possible for a team that lost a match to still be in the standing to win.
"Vodka." C'iemone replied. "We always take a shot before the karaoke begins."
Draco was starving, exhausted, and his hand hurt. Rut season could be fun if you had a partner, or so he's been told; however, by himself with the object of his desire just right next door and frustratingly unavailable, his rut was just torture.
Hari's lips were moist, pink, and glistening against the green shell of the salted edamame as he used his lips to gently pop the immature soybeans into his mouth. He was chewing absently, lost in thought, looking out into the garden. Draco watched hypnotized as yet another pod made its way between his lips and gently pulled back out. He was scarcely breathing let alone concentrating on anything else, anyone else, as Hari quickly cleaned the salt from his index finger, then thumb, glancing up through thick lashes towards Draco.
But Sirius actually
bins. "Your wrong about not deserving help. Severus Snape was a great man, a brave man, and he loved so deeply, he betrayed his beliefs, killed and in the end died to protect it. If I ever have a son, I'd honor his memory in him." Hari said with absolute conviction.
(See the end of the chapter for
My mother has a heart and lung condition, she got a respiratory infection in November, and still has not recovered strength-wise from. I am her homecare provider. I cook, clean, do laundry. Grocery shop, the whole nine yard.
He never broke eye contact, glaring at Hari over his meal. Hari got the hint. He wouldn't let go. He nodded his understanding.
Before Harry could clear his tattered trainers over the edge of the first landing, he felt a grip on his ankle and then the tug that had him dragged nearly off the landing altogether, if it wasn't for his desperate fingers, grasping the bars at the top of the ladder. He couldn't help the scream that tore out of his throat.
"No." Draco said to Hari's surprise. "Left off, actually. Like the Potter's, pure-blood. As pure as most families go. Your family wasn't on the list. For some inconsequential reason, other than the author of the list, Cantankerous Nott, didn't agree with these families policies in the Wizengamot. The Daily Prophet claims he left the Potter's off because the sur name was too Muggle. What nonsense. Like there aren't Muggles with the sur name Black.  Anyway, names were left off for trivial reasons like that." Draco actually rolled his eyes.
He moved onto another bush and began cutting the heads of those as well. “Yeah, but then I realized he had a family of his own. He had Andromeda, and in extension you and Narcissa. I couldn’t take Teddy…That would be cruel. Andromeda has grandparental rights. Doesn’t everyone deserve family of their own?”
Draco handed back the journal, before plopping back into the pillows this time pulling the duvet up. Hari read the last page Draco wrote in, blushing at the words but vowed to keep his promise.
"Very well, now that you have delivered the eviction notice, just this morning, I might add, we have thirty days to evacuate the premises. If you wish to forcefully remove us from my aunts home, you best have a warrant or my lawyers will be in touch with the London Police department. Now I shall personally, have my solicitar ring the bank to handle the past due amount on the mortgage. They'll call you, don't call on us again. Good day, gentlemen" And with that Harry Potter, with no familial relations to Andromeda Tonks at all, slammed the door on the banksman, the locksmith and two police officers.
“Where are you going, if your home burnt down?” The other Auror finally spoke up.
Then watched in horror as tears suddenly began leaking from Draco's eyes.
He was just about to call his house-elf, when he heard a knock at his door. He didn’t smell his mother or his aunt, the house-elf would just Aparate in, so that left only Hari. Having forgotten everything from the night before, he rushed to the door to answer Hari at the door.
15 May 1992
“Potter, unhand me! You can’t just walk out on Aunt Andra like that, Potter?” Draco snarled and jostled Hari’s hold on his arm. Andromeda was the nicest women Draco ever met; he genuinely considered her family and was proud to call her aunt.
"You are looking good, Dudley. Good for you." And Hari found he felt genuinely happy for his cousin. He suddenly remembered that his cousin had made the effort at the end.
Alice jumped up and waved the black box around. "OOOH! Lets order some!" She pressed a button and the box began vibrating. It had a white letter 3 scrawled across the top with the name of the bar and logo on it.
"Hey Cub!" Sheryl says, clapping Hari down on the shoulder. "Champaign to celebrate?"
They continued their exploration of blue jeans, Khakis, combat trousers-just no-and other arrays of slacks and trousers.
Charm. Don’t think I won’t use it to freeze your oily painted arse.”
“Would you believe me, if I said I was a randy teenager once as well, and there are ways to get around that?” Draco hunched his shoulders and just barely managed to restrain himself from covering his ears. Narcissa barely restrained a titter of amusement at her son’s discomfort.  Narcissa schooled her face. “
On the
"Harry, calm down. Dudley, this is the cousin you told me about?" Cho tried to negate the hostility.
"There you go champ." Draco said with false merriment. "that's for Hari. He doesn't hold grudges. Well, unless it's with me. So have a good life."
“Love is it?” He heard Narcissa ask in a surprised voice. Hari listened with halted breath
"I don't know if I can return your feelings, Draco." Draco closed his eyes to his heartbreak. “Not yet, so I decided we could try..."
Harry knew this to be true, having experienced this before at the Dursleys; the feeling far worse than an empty stomach. The plate was pushed back before Harry and he gingerly took another one, more than half expecting him to snatch the plate away. He let out a relieved breath when that didn't happen. He ate this croissant much slower and savored the warm slide of delicious food into his stomach.
I know readers will be eager to read the next two chapters posted along with this one, but don't forget to show your love for this one.
I dread returning home this winter holiday. I didn't do as well on this terms finals as I would have liked. Father's going to be furious that I failed him again. I've always gotten top marks before now. I came in second. It might as well be last.
Trying to entice Hari into his bed, be tried for sultry but just sounded silly to Hari's ears, said; "Care to join me, Potter? You know you want to." Draco then giggled.
I hope you enjoyed Draco's first year at Hogwarts.
Draco leaned conspicuously against Hari shoulder whispering, “Mother can’t cook at all. Many a-Litha celebrations she has burnt the bread. Father got fed up and allowed the house-elves to do the cooking, despite mother trying to keep her family tradition alive.”
"I was trying to get...Hagrid fired. He had no qualification. He never resumed his schooling after his name was cleared the end of second year. He doesn't have a functioning wand, and his pink umbrella is not fooling anyone. He never sat his OWLS, let alone his NEWTS. He. Is. Not. Qualified. To. Teach."
"Who then, Filius?" She asked.
p.s. Chapter 2 of Pulling Strings, Behind the Scenes is finally updated and hopefully glitch free. Check it out.
“She’s only trying to make a sale, Draco.” Hari shrugged. “It’s retail. They get paid an hourly rate, but the real money is in commissions. They get bonuses for how many customers they assist.”
Hari rubbed his eyes with open palmed frustration beneath his glasses. "Alright, so there are different factions of pure-blood. Those whom embrace creatures' blood and those who reject it."
Walking over to the piano, Harry sat down in the center of the duet bench, positioning his hand in resting position over the middle C note. He slowly worked his fingers over the scales, working his way up each octave, limbering his fingers in a well-practiced warm up. It wasn’t like he wanted to tell Hermione and Ron that he actually knew a bit about the piano, it never came up before that autumn, and when Hermione did a piss poor job of teaching Ron, he was preoccupied searching Sirius’s and Regulus’s rooms, and finding out who R.A.B. actually was.
Draco’s heart broke for his mother. For the children she lost, and the siblings that he never got to meet. He read the educational material on the different dynamics. He knew that ova fertility rates were low in female alphas, but to hear a firsthand account of it and by his own mother. Oh he wished he had his father soulless body next to him so he could castrate him, or rip out his lungs, his bowels, his heart, and feed it to him. But it had been weeks since the Dementors kiss and his father’s body probably already withered away from lack of food in a coma. Not knowing what to do, he only squeezed his mother tighter, unaware of the silent tears that left wet trails down his own cheeks.
He met Draco’s concerned expression, and reached up to pull his face down in a brief kiss. Before he could deepen the kiss. He heard a gruff clearing of the throat.
Happy New Years.
Hari was definitely regretting wanting to confide in Sirius now. He squirmed beneath his godfather's gaze. "You know…for me…" He trailed off.
Not Draco's taste.
"Oh my God!" Hari says with mouth gaping wide and finger pointing. "It was right after your birthday, and you kept acting peculiar and your mum kept sending you to your room." Hari chortled. "You were in heat."
"All right, all right, enough moping, already. I'll get dressed and see about
Draco's darkened eyebrows winged up. The manikin was draped in an outfit that consist of a Medici style collar, front and back
Narcissa said in French.
"Not in the house, Malfoy, but if you are so afraid of snakes maybe you should have been in Hufflepuff instead of Slytherin." Hari joked.
If man were really meant to be killers, so many of the young men and women wouldn't have so much trouble coping with the after effects of war.
not taking away the too brief blissful memory. Thanks to his dragon inheritance Draco stood a full head and shoulders above Harry where as before it was mere inches.  Luckly, Potter was smiling down at Teddy in his arms and didn't see the slightly panicked expression he had on his face.
Hari was currently in the back, scrubbing a pan manually, as usual, wizards are not aloud to do magic in front of Muggles. Draco took full advantage of Hari’s agreement, and stayed behind the counter to enjoy the view. Sheryl still on her ‘break’ as she called it, for the past four hours, was seated beside Draco facing out towards the restaurant to keep an eye on her customers, while catching up on her cub and his would be suitor.
"Oh, I'm Ha..." But he was quickly overspoken.
The building of pressure in the room was physical; Hari’s next words were clipped short.
Draco looked over the counter at Hari; laughing and scrubbing dishes. Draco couldn’t help but have a sudden feeling of apprehension. Of all Draco's bravado, it was a very real possibility that Hari would reject him. All he could think of was how he hoped Hari would give him a chance to prove that they could be good together. Because, Draco knew that by himself, he was no good.
"And what if I make you scrub all the toilets back home?" Hari demanded.
"This adorable little guy is my godson, Edward Remus Lupin." Harry said in a baby voice that was disturbing when his deranged Aunt Bellatrix did it, but did something else completely for Draco when Potter spoke like that to his godson. Then he did something that freaked him out. He walked right over to him, ignored his halted breath and stiffening shoulders and placed the slightly squirming baby into his arms. "Malfoy, meet your cousin, well second cousin, actually. This is your Aunt Andromeda's grandson, Edward. We call him Teddy. Teddy Bear" Harry said affectionately to his godson, "meet your cousin, Draco. I hope you two get along, but if you throw up on him that would be a riot."
p.s. I vow to never get detention ever again. Especially, if Hogwarts makes kids go into the Forbidden Forest. It is forbidden for a reason.
Alice lowered her voice and whispered in Draco's ear. "Sheryl's told me about your designs on our Hari. Hari's a bit shy and oblivious to most advances. He's either ignored or never noticed anyone coming on to him when he visits Sheryl. A bit innocent, but I bet he is really wild in the bed, though. When he is ready for a sexual relationship with you, "
Just then a tiny house-elf skipped in and spoke up without even bowing. “Young Master Lupin-Black is being up, fed, burped and changed. Master Hari sirs, informed me of wanting to “say good-morning and cuddle Teddy Bear,” before he departs. Dot has informed the Master, may Dot goes washing sheets now?” Hari blushed at the young house-elf, who quoted him near verbatim. The other two frowned at her in disapproval over how the younger house-elf behaved. A proper house-elf never asked things of their master. Hari would admit that it was quite refreshing, and knew she only wanted to do the wash, because she could choose, from an array of pillowcases, sheets, doylies, and other non-clothe item linen to use as clothes. She was quite the fashionista.
An alpha command. Something that if Draco was mature enough he could have fought, but wisely he backed down. Perhaps soon his own alpha would be stronger, but not today. He listened to his mother and with chair scraping on the hardwood floor, slamming the dining room door on his way out, and stomped up four flights of stairs.
Organizing clothes was a favorite hobby of his. Whenever he got a chance back at the manor, he’d arrange clothes in his wardrobe. Sometimes by color, other times by season, or function. One time in particular he had arranged them into individual items. He never got tired of this part.
Hari’s mouth was parted in a slight oh. “I didn’t know you knew how to cook.” He said, astounded. Narcissa wrinkled her nose and Hari knew where Draco got that habit from.
Thoughts of what life could have been like, if Voldemort had not chosen him for death flooded through his mind. He remembered receiving his first Hogwarts letters and feeling so happy to leave the Dursley’s. He remembered the excitement, and wonder, and awe upon seeing the magical Castle that would feel more like home than anywhere else in the world. He remembered meeting his first ever friends, Ronald Weasley and later Hermione Granger. He thought of all the adventures and mischief they got into, although Harry would say he never went looking for trouble, that trouble just found him. He imagined his father, James Potter and the Maunders; Sirius Black, and Remus Lupin would be proud.
And Draco stood in the center of it all, his head turning to take it all in.
Is Draco's journal too creepy? I kinda like it.
“Well, well, well, Potter. It looks like you are enjoying this after all. Having fun yet?” Harry was shaking his head frantically, in denial of the pleasure caused by the stimulation of the prostrate located in the anus. Draco added a third finger, the tight ring of muscles protesting the intrusion. The sensation must have been too much for Potter to handle, between pain and pleasure; his struggles increased, and screams and cries grew louder. But finally, with a final thrust of his fingers, Potter’s muscles in his channel tightened impossibly more, constricting around Draco’s three fingers, his back arched off the ground, and throat muscles chorded on a silent scream, before his whole body just collapsed in a heap upon the water.
Draco still didn't acknowledge him, lost in thought. Suddenly Draco moved, but not as expected. He sighed nice and long, wrapping both arms around his knee, and rested his head on top of them. The leg that dangled swung fanciful, back and forth. As he watched, Draco raised his hand as if to catch moonbeams, light caress over pale skin and sharp manicured nails almost glistening like scales in the light. Hari blinked once; long and slow, the mirage disappeared. Hari told himself it was a trick of the light.
Andromeda evidently felt her sister’s sentiment exactly and replied, “But surely…in a magical household such as this. With the wards in place…underage magic would be near impossible to trace with so many adults present. I taught Nymphadora lots of beginning spells before Hogwarts. I, at least taught her magical theory. It’s an advantage magical families have over Muggle-borns. It’s only enforced when in the Muggle world, to protect the Statute of Secrecy.” Andromeda said shocked.
Draco was crying, tears streaming down his pale face into the grimy basin. He gasped and gulped and then, with a great shudder, looked up into the cracked mirror and saw Harry Potter staring at him over his shoulder.
Draco couldn’t help the involuntary “Gross,” that popped out of his mouth. The idea of his mother and father together while at Hogwarts in that way made him shudder with disgust.
“Where to next?” Draco asked as he snagged an overly salted chip.
I followed them as stealthy as I could in empty corridors, until I realized that they were heading to Headmaster's Tower. I took an alternative route to Gargoyles Corridor. I got there just in time to hear that Dumbledore was not in.
“Well, Harry, welcome to my place. Enjoy the food. I hope you’ll like the sauce.” Sheryl responded, jerking her chin in the direction of the tiny dipping platter with a couple sauce options.
“Mon Petit Dragon, rest. You had only a couple hours of sleep” Narcissa gently chastised her son.
." She emphasised this last part. "Just like the
***Check out chapter 3 of Pulling Strings, Behind the Scenes. "Draco's Heart: YEAR ONE" out now. ***
That was mortifying, but he had to gather enough courage to do it again.
It should have been impossible, Harry thought to himself as he was once again locked in his cupboard without supper, for who knows how long this time. These peculiar things that kept happening around him. Sometimes they were small insignificant things, like his hair growing back at an alarming rate, or a sweater shrinking while his aunt tried to force it over his head. And now, he was being punished unfairly for inexplicably finding himself on the chimney of his primary schools kitchen.
And the snake was massive, it easily overtook Harry's miniature stacher in seconds when it raised its head.
Once done relieving his bladder, Hari washes his hands at one of the sinks. Shaking his hands dry, he adjusts his glasses and frowns at his wildly unkempt hair. Turning around to leave, he pauses on something in his reflection. A wet spot on his left shoulder. He leaned into the mirror, before simply turning his head down and pulling his dress shirt out to see better.
Hari sighed, “I know it.” as Draco pressed forward seeking entrance.
The house-elf left on a startled squeak of "Yes master Draco, right away sir." The house-elf appeared a moment later, nearly as quickly as it arrived, with a portrait taller than itself. The person in the portrait was scolding the poor house-elf for holding it upside down, and the person was holding onto the frame by the bottom, in danger of falling into the nothingness that was the ceiling.
“But the connection went both ways” Hari said pausing in his caged lion pacing, raising his index finger to the ceiling. “Voldemort was much better at using Legilimency than I. What’s more, I sucked at Occlumency.” Hari said rubbing his lightning bolt scar on his forehead. “He got inside my head, implant false visions so that I would believe Sirius was captured, so that I would voluntarily leave the protection of the school. The weapon was no weapon at all, but a prophecy that only Voldemort or I could touch. Voldemort believed that the prophecy would tell him a way to kill me seeing as I already survived the killing curse once.” Draco’s hand itched desperately. He wanted to retrieve his journal and write down this information as quickly as possible.
only for his words to echo around the infinite room. He tried to look past Draco for the dragon, but the dragon was gone and here stood Draco without any clothes, and in the light available by starlight all around and hearthfire, his skinned glowed just like the dragon’s scales.
his mother told him that is the main smell all underage witches and wizards had. Fresh and clean like new snow, but cold to the touch, so don't. It appeared to have the opposite effect on Draco, because Harry didn't smell like anything, like he didn't belong to anyone, it made Draco want to scent him, to warn others away.
And as things went in dreams, so too were his clothes.
Draco shook Hari again, "I am not worried, nor should you." Draco smirked. "The only person here who I'll allow to seduce me is you, love."
Hari rished his explanation. "I went out with Malfoy today. Took him around London, then we had some drinks. Anyway. Draco...Draco, he confessed." Hari shouted the last line.
Yeah baby
“Permanent Sticking charm,” Hari interjected. “We couldn’t and I didn’t know how then.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Can I come in?" Hari asked searching Draco's face for a reaction. He got none. He stepped up to the door jam, which forced Draco to take a step back into his room and let him in.
"He your keeper now?"
Nose flaring in anger, Hari marched to where Draco stood rooted to the spot. "What do you think you’re doing?" He snarled out. Grabbing Draco's uninjured hand he dragged Draco down the hall to his own room, where he knew he had dittany, or at least bandages. He pushed the too-stunned-to-protest Draco down onto his bed, not caring about the state of the items beneath or around him.
Narcissa and Draco return to the Malfoy Manor
As the summer solstice approaches, the occupants of 12 Grimmauld Place prepare for Litha, a day long celebration. When night falls, Hari will shed a few drops of blood under the zenith moon, blood adopting Teddy as his godson and fulfilling his yearly obligation to strengthen the wards around Grimmauld Place.
“Eater challenge still stands. You finish the meal, it’s free.” Sheryl said in finality.
25 May 1992
I have included some adaptations from the films as well as the books. Please, enjoy.
The Head Clerk stopped counting a giant pile of Rubies, leaned over the top of his ledger, peering menacingly down at Harry from black beady-eyes.  "Mr. Potter, we goblins have been wondering when you would show your thieving neck here again." Jumping down from behind the counter, and rushing around the desk, the Head Clerk only stood at hip level, looking up at Harry and motioning him to silently follow him, he hurried away.
"You have a diary about me?" There was a very pregnant pause.
Chapter 15 will bring back the glorious Sheryl. Thank you all for being supportive. I am so sorry I am not reliable with updates.
Brought back to the present, Narcissa glanced briefly to her right to see her equally apprehensive seventeen year old son, taking the position of walking street side, always the gentleman. Two scarlet robed Aurors stationed as their guard, walked in front of them and behind. They were there for the Malfoy’s protection, but Narcissa was still warry of them.
Having a scent blocker that doesn’t completely suppress his scent all together is important, because scents serve a multiple of purposes socially; identifying self, emotions, and property.
Draco kept talking over his mother, “Oh Ma Petit Dragon, no…”
He quickly reached for his shampoo bottle to get his shower over and done with. Grabbing his 3-in-1 bottle of shampoo, conditioner, and body wash he quickly finished washing in double time.
Hari tasted his own spunk on Draco’s fingers and it wasn’t at all what he expected. It was salty and bitter, and the texture was thick like heavy cream. Hari felt his expression contort into a grimace.
"I talked with Sirius’s portrait and he told me of a place near us. It has a lot of shops and restaurant’s. I thought we’d maybe go there first.” Hari said, swinging his leg over Sirius’s old Motorbike. He snapped closed the buckle of his helmet and raised the other for Draco to grab. “Come on, hop on.” He urged.
"Ouch! hurts! brrrr. cold" Draco said as he rubbed his head with one shaking hand, before curled up in a ball and shivered.
The Wonderful World of Harry Potter, the characters and images all belongs to the amazing mind of J.K. Rowling and no copyright infringement was intended in the creation of this fan fiction.
For now he gripped Draco’s head, effortlessly mussing his pale blonde hair.
Draco was both thrilled and terrified of sharing a room right next to Hari. Thoughts of sleeping on the same floor, quickly turned into visions of sleeping in the same room, on the same bed, and more explicit activities came to mind than just sleeping. That line of thought Draco was fighting to stay away from at the moment, because it was completely inappropriate to be having fantasies of he and Hari in twenty different sex positions and counting with his mother
A familiar screech drew Draco's eyes to the rafters of sort, where a brook stick (not a racing broom) held open a window. A great white Snowy owl with amber eyes and black specks on its wings stared down at the two wizards. It hooted twice before tucking its head under a bandaged wing to sleep.
Then, I heard gasps from the audience and I feared Harry had fallen. But no, he didn't fall. He managed to swing himself back onto his Nimbus 2000. I was so relieved, but I hope my mask stayed in place. I didn't want my father to know I was rooting for the Gryffindor's, for Harry in secret.
She could hardly believe that her only sister was dead. The younger sister that as a child had loved and cherished, then envied. Their relationship had been strained the last few years. And now, she was expected to believe that Lily Potter was dead. Why wasn't she told to come identify her sister's remains? The only evidence was her sister's babe, Harry. And a letter requesting Petunia and her husband Vernon, to raise him. But mostly she, because the protection spell her sister, the witch, cast on Harry only worked if she as his blood relative watched over him. She almost didn't believe it.
The baby boutique was small, cozy, and done up in pastels—everything from the stuffed toys to the balloons were a light and pleasant shade. Finding a clothing rack, it soon became obvious that the two teenage boys were well out of their league as they stared in confusion at the labels.
As a child Sirius ran away to stay with Harry's father, James, because he couldn't stand living there. His mother Walburga Black blasted his face off the family tree, but his father Orion Black didn't disinherit him so that after his parents and brothers death.
It was he who instructed Dobby to discourage Hari Potter from going back to Hogwarts. It was he who suggested Dobby give Gillyweed to him for the second task, and it was he who ordered Dobby to release the prisoners from the cellar.
At Draco's affirmative, Alice laughed in excitement.
"Now Pumpkin, when we go out, we'll get two more presents how does that sound?"
I left out a key component to why the ministry felt it was important to go to such an extreme measure on all the wizarding population. And I didn’t tell you before, because it is...well,
." And waited.
He could talk to his godfather afterall.
“Give Hari a break, Bear.” Alice said dancing to Sheryl’s side to rub her bare arm.
"I...I...need to stop." He managed.
Both boy’s fidgeted in their seats in unison facing away from each other. "No, we weren't naked and it was my first time doing it." Hari said.
Draco's eyes widened in panic, before he slipped off the couch beside Hari and cupped his tear streaked cheeks. "Wha...why...shhh, shhh, no love." He shushed as his thumbs tried desperately to wipe away tears from eyes as they poured out. He didn't register the endearment and neither did Hari.
Not soon after, Draco slowly walked to Hari’s room, musing over the conversation he’d just had. He felt that it would be best all-around if he just told Hari about how
Draco left the black rubbish bag by itself, instead taking the book and hurling it into fire. He brushed his hands off and turned to Hari. He had a cheery smile on his lips. “Your turn, love.” He said almost sing-songy.
Forget the fact Hari couldn't have babies, the act of creating one send Hari's head reeling. The fact that Draco would want to do anything of that nature with him was still uncomfortable for him. “Get your head out of the fucking gutter, Malfoy!”
I am worried about Harry, again. He has some kind of migraine. He won't go to Madam Pomfrey. End of the year exams are in progress. Maybe he is not use to all the stress. I hope he takes a potion to make him feel better soon.
"I've seen that fancy fake I.D. he's got along with that shiny black credit card." Sheryl winked. "In the world of money, black means filthy rich, my queenling. And you glow with it. So, the Black Queen, on a lower budget but none the less looking fabulous." Sheryl turned the chair as Alice squealed in excitement, revealing the manakin underneath the cloth.
Sheryl only laughed at that. “Forgive me for my French not being my native language. I grew up in Louisiana and most of my education was thought on the knee of my mother, who spoke only creole French. I have sought to improve my speech ever since coming here."
Draco sputtered as Hari laughed. It was short lived as a ripping noise sounded. There was a breath of silence and a shout of pain from Hari.
He heard the door of the balcony open and close with a soft click the sound of soft soles descending stone steps.
“Just stand still.” Narcissa said as she leveled her wand at his abdomen.
Spots swam in front of his eyes and breath became shallow and strained. ‘Last one’ Harry’s whole body shook; from exhaustion, from over magic exertion, he wasn’t sure. Concentration became difficult, he raised his wand arm and barely muttered the final incantation that would repel any dark magic and dark creatures from getting in, “
"No! Sirius. It's true." Hari cried out. His emotions suddenly at the surface boiling over. "I've always found Draco attractive. I've just never admitted it to myself before tonight. I thought I liked girls, but I have always paid just a little too much attention to Draco Malfoy. I mean, he's always there. I always ha...hated him. He's always given me reasons to hate him. But I don't hate him anymore, and now he is saying all these things...that he lo...loves me." Hari stuttered over the words, having never spoken them outloud before. "No one has said that to me before. Not Cho, not Ginny, just Draco...and I liked it. His confession. It made me feel wanted. I never had that before. And you say it's because, I'm depressed, lonely, it's just a phase. Sirius, if I feel this way all the time...is it wrong?"
'Honor my heritage' it said in her journals, 'with a twist'. It went on into further details, about how she changed the spelling, but the pronunciation is similar. Hari, spelled with one 'R' and and 'I', Hah-ree. A true Gryffindor name, sanskrit meaning Lion." Reading out loud his mothers notes, he continued. "Could also mean king; natural born leader, commander, and independent. Passionate and compassionate, charismatic with magnetic personality, and a romantic. The one who removes troubles, blockage, pain, slavery and sin. A savior." He finished closing the journal, but not before Andromeda saw that Lily had circled the word savior several times over.
Draco slipped off Hari’s invisibility cloak as he entered Ollivander’s, the bell above the door chimed. Two witches stood behind the counter, the same two who chased him out of the shop the first time around. There smiles of welcome faded the instant they laid eyes on Draco.
"Yes, I didn't know until I was thirteen and he escaped Azkaban. Of course when I first saw him, I thought he was working with Voldemort, betrayed my parents, and was after revenge for killing his master. The whole world thought he had betrayed my parents, even one of Dad's closest friends, Remus. Remus would tell me stories about their adventures at Hogwarts, made me feel proud of them. He'd call me Prongslet or pup."
“Ah, well. Don’t ye worry lads! We got all ya could need, shall need, from activity toys to zip-ups!” Draco looked at Hari. He had no idea what a zip-up was, and from the look of it, neither did Hari.
"Ted was Andromeda's husband's name. We call him Teddy in memory. I...er...call him Teddy Bear, because I...um...like the endearment, and I like to snuggle him, I suppose." Hari admitted with a faint blush on his cheeks.
Hari was panting and allowed himself to cling to Draco. "I can't feel my legs."
Draco raised his bloody hand to his mouth, unwittingly trying to return warmth to his hand by breathing fire into his fist.
"Shit, Draco are you alright?" Hari said kneeling over Draco to touch his arm. It was cold to the touch. Hari hadn't thought it was that cold in the study, but apparently Draco was freezing.
Suddenly, Hari pushed him away. and for just a moment he thought Hari was rejecting him, but as he took a step back, Draco felt the air move by his ear. Hari wasn’t rejecting him. Hari was pushing him out of the way of the snapping jaws of Ashur, the guardian snake on the door.
Kaa slithered over the now windowless enclosure, dragging his huge weight across Dudley's prone form. Aunt Petunia screamed. The sound drew the rest of the occupants to be aware of the released boa constrictor.
Did you ever make anything happen? Anything you couldn't explain when you were angry or scared?
scars on the back of his right hand done with a blood quill in detention with umbridge. "I bet I have Dittany around here... somewhere?" Hari trailed off, actually turning his head this way and that as if he would be able to see it in the study. He pulled out his beautiful willow wand and said, "
"Well my parents and I relocated to Westminster after I graduated. You know I'm half and half, so mother wanted me to go to college here and get my Diploma of Higher Education before I decide on what I'll do with the rest of my life." Cho explained subtly that she was a half-blood like Hari and her mother, a Muggle, wanted her to go to a Muggle College in Westminster before she decided on staying in the Muggle world or wizarding world to work.
"Thank you!" Minerva hollered after him. Her legs felt weak with relief. Severus, might not have outright said it, but he'd do everything in his power to make sure Lily's son was alive.
"Hari! HARI!?" Draco shouted. "Are all these songs about sex. I swear this song, sounds to me like a woman offering to give out blow jobs."
Draco’s eyes suddenly misted over. “Thanks, Hari.”
I've checked out the same books as that oaf. How did he not remember these things. He's going to give the poor girl ringworm or what not.
Hari sputtered. “It was fine, we went shopping.” Still unaware of the hickey blooming darker by the minute.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Now that the criminal charges have been read to all the accussed, let us move on. How do you plead, Lucius Malfoy?”
Twirling to face the Floo, Hari activated it and stepped back saying, “Well you are in for a surprise, at least I get to mess up that pretty hair.” Draco stepped through, stomping down ruthlessly on the thought that said,
“Well, I am not surprised, Corbeau. It is one of the more difficult magical rituals out there.” Narcissa says.
Balancing tremulously on one arm, he lifts the other running shaking fingers through silk fine hair behind delicate frilled ears, before getting a grip and pulling.
UK Currency for those not familiar with the pound sterling:
With blood rushing in his ears, and quiet sobs racking his shoulders, Harry did not hear the soft tinkle of glass flowing into each other from the floor and then a vase, whole once more, smoothly soaring to its pedestal.
“Hello!!!” A friendly voice called out to them. “What can I be doing for ya lads? Who are you shopping for?” A man that approached them had big white teeth and brown eyes.
Arlys dragged two covered carts with either hands into salon from the narrow back door and pushed one cart towards her station in front of Hari that C'iemone easily caught, and then handed off another to Sheryl. "
“Mary suddenly dashed across the street.” Ollie said.
When his job was to protect and serve and then forced to treat the homeless like criminals, when most just fell on hard times to the housing crisis, losing their jobs and families. Most were actually retired vets, who couldn't deal with civilian life after the trauma they witnessed in the wars they served. Our government, not doing a good enough job with mental health services for the honoured veterans.
Admittingly,
It is a base need to provide food, shelter, and comfort among other primal urges to procreate with his chosen mate. He couldn’t tell Hari that, not until Sirius told him the secret or Hari turned eighteen.
"Did I ask for any money, kid? No, then shut up." The man turned around. He held a cup of hot something in his hand and placed it with a careful click on the bar top. The slight smell of tea had Harry taking up the cup and nearly draining the thing, only wincing slightly at the hot and bitter taste on his tongue.
"Okay, okay...we'll stop." When Draco went to step away from Hari, his legs buckled and Draco caught him. He sat down with Hari's legs over his lap and head once more on his shoulder, and his hands carded through damp and messy hair. Draco decided to talk.
Harry gulped and nodded. He thought he understood what Trout was trying to show him.
“I felt, feel the same Dray, I never wished you dead, ever.”
"It was an atrocity that the Black's ancestral home was is such disrepair. I'm glad my family coming to live with you, convinced you to fix that old dump." Draco says.
Hari didn’t realize that he was singing while he worked. It was a happy tune that floated through the garden on a slight summer breeze. He thought about the events of that day, and came to the sudden and pleasantly surprising realization that he had genuinely fun today-with Draco Malfoy. Hari’s relationship with Draco was tentative at best, but he was beginning to see how they could get on in the future, if they had more days like this.
“I’ll tell you when I figure that out.”
Yes, I like piña coladas
"KREACHER! It looks like we will hold off on eating breakfast. Will the status charm hold and keep breakfast warm for us, while I give Malfoy the tour?" When the house-elf gave the affirmative. Potter nodded and taking Teddy from Draco, placed him back on the cushion, gestured Draco out the patio doors. "I guess we will start here, with the garden. Is that an albino peacock?" Harry asked incredulously. He had not noticed Draco release the animal from his arms, and Draco couldn't remember doing so, as he was to memorized by Harry's beauty in the morning light.
"Where are we being invited to, Hari?" Draco said as he sat down, picking up a red packaged candy. breaking into it and then breaking the chocolate wafer in half, he offered the rest to Hari as he crunched in. It was delicious. Draco considered the piece he just ate, eyeing the piece in Hari's hand. He quickly took back the other half from Hari and ate that as well.
Potter was only wearing half his uniform; gray trousers, white button down shirt, and Gryffindor scarlet and yellow tie sans gray blazer with school emblem and robes. His shirt had already ridden up his slender waist and Draco noted he missed a loop three buttons down. Deciding to remedy the situation, Draco nimbly undid the rest of his buttons. He then slowly glided his hands up Potter's torso, opening Potter’s shirt from narrow hips and slender waist, all the way up his ribcage, over the smooth skin of his chest, brushing his thumbs over brown nipples on the ascend, to rest at the loosely knotted tie at his throat. Deciding to leave Potter’s tie where it was for now, he pulling his own tie over his head, and grasped first one slender wrist, then the other and swiftly secured his tie around Potter’s wrists. With Draco straddling his hips and hands tied above his head, Draco believed he had Potter adequately pinned beneath him.
“Great!” Hari said excitedly, shaking the memory and just enjoying the freedom of being in the air once more.
Draco stammered out a “Yes, Mama.”
"Minnie, I couldn't allow that. You're a teacher, not a mother."  The words came as a soft blow on Minerva's head.
When he had gotten back to his bed, he had another problem; what to do with the soiled garments. He thought about stuffing them in a pillowcase, but then they’d get moldy. He remembered contemplating just counting his losses and tossing the pair away. But he hadn’t many pairs at the time and so he cleared a spot on the wardrobe floor and left them to, hopefully, dry.
