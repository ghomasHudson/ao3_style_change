“Look… look at it…” he said, and Draco frowned into the darkness as Granger began to shake her head in confusion.
“Thanks for telling me, I was thinking of my Grandfather’s funeral just now,” he told him drily and Potter rolled his eyes.
“What is the meaning of this intrusion?” he asked, his voice slightly slurred and Greyback stepped forward, dragging Potter with him so they had to shuffle around awkwardly.
“As long as it’s not any of our lot!” replied another voice and Draco craned his neck to see his cousin and Ginny Weasley, watching from a window with their wands drawn. Ginny, her gaze focused, fired off several jinxes into a crowd of Death Eaters below.
The pub was bustling but not busy, and Harry gave a small smile to the bartender, before scanning the room. He spotted her, in the corner of the pub, her nose in a book, as always, and hurried over.
That night, while the boys slept, Draco admitted that he had killed Lucius while in the mirror. He had said so quietly, his voice numb, and Harry had reached for him and held him tight while he sobbed. He hadn't cried for his father since.
’?” Potter said, something like a manic smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. He flipped the book closed as Draco gave him a quizzical look.
Their time since Hogwarts hadn’t always been easy. In the early days, it was the conflict between those that believed Draco had changed versus those that believed he was a Death Eater spy. To see him at the right hand of their saviour enraged them, even though they hadn’t gone public with their relationship (surprisingly, in all the confusion at the end of the final battle, no one had noticed them kissing). But Harry, Gryffindor Golden Boy, was steadfast and loyal. He spoke at the Malfoys’ trial, though he couldn’t save Lucius from Azkaban, but he did manage to get Narcissa sentenced to house arrest only. He defended Draco to all the nay-sayers and when, in a moment of frustration, grabbed Draco and kissed him in the middle of Diagon Alley, Harry was ready to do battle, to fight those that decried Draco and their relationship. And while
“They used to go around telling people they were the heirs of Slytherin, or at least that’s what my Grandfather used to say,” he said with a rueful smile, which promptly dropped when Hermione gave him another look. He groaned and covered his face with a hand. “They were, weren’t they?” he asked her, though the question was rhetorical, and she gave him a pained look but nodded. “Merlin,” he breathed.
“–“-rux. We’ve got to find the others,” Potter said and he looked back at the doorway. Draco glanced over as well but the door was shut, blocking the view of anything outside the room. Potter turned back to look at Draco. “Do you regret it? That night on the Astronomy tower? He said he’d help you,” he said and Draco’s stomach dropped.
“I’m sure you all know my history. You know I’m the Boy-Who-Lived, the… the man who defeated Voldemort,” and here some of the Fellows flinched and Harry smiled a little, “but I also grew up abused, and shunned and rejected by the only family I had. And when I learned what Horcruxes were, and what effect they had on people around them, I started to think maybe that was why,
“Are you sure he never mentioned–?” she asked and Potter shook his head, rising to stand straight and cutting her off.
"What do you mean?" he asked after a moment, and Dumbledore tapped his fingers together and frowned slightly.
Draco nodded, closing his eyes and thinking hard, screwing up his face in concentration. It was like every happy memory he had went fleeing from his mind. He scrambled about to find one and finally settled on his eighth birthday party, when a Magical Menagerie had set up in the gardens of the Manor – he had spent all day with Fire Salamanders, Bowtruckles and Nifflers. He took a steadying breath and nodded.
Malfoy Manor, his childhood home, began to disappear from around him, turning to darkness as Greyback roared in fury and Bellatrix flung her knife forward, a blur of silver heading towards the spot where they had been standing, his parents bursting into the room with identical looks of horror and betrayal as the light faded and then they were gone.
A few times he had tried to chat with Hermione alone, to ask her how she was recovering, but she had recoiled as he approached, raising a hand to hold him off.
"When I have children, I won't do that to them. There won't be anything more important to me than them, ever," he has said with conviction. Malfoy had looked at him, over the rim of his cup of tea, and maybe smiled a little.
“Thank you. We can’t thank you enough. You’ve saved our lives,” he said sincerely and Aberforth grunted. Harry stepped closer, his eyes flicking over the man’s face with a frown. “It’s your eye I’ve been seeing in the mirror,” he said and there was silence in the room, Draco frowning from confusion as Aberforth and Harry studied each other. “You sent Dobby,” he said finally and Draco frowned even more.
Instead, he lay back and stared up at the dark canopy over his bed and when Ollivander began to scream, Draco didn’t bother to brush away the tears.
“You first. Come here, let me do you,” she said, drawing Bellatrix’s wand, stolen from Malfoy Manor, out of her bag. Weasley stepped forward as Griphook went around him, heading for Harry.
“Yeah, that’d be nice,” he said. Draco ducked his head a little, smiling to himself, and stepped into the pub, Harry following him with a smile on his own face.
“There!” Griphook lunged once more for the sword and took it before Harry could, swinging it high out of reach. The momentum swung the cup off the sword and high into the air, sending it arcing over their heads. Draco watched it fall and then Harry dove for it, the goblin holding on for dear life. He caught it, letting out another yell of pain as the cup burned his hand and duplicates rained from it.
“I killed a woman. I killed the woman I loved. These chains are my penance and her refusal to forgive is my torture,” he finally said. Draco’s mouth went dry.
“Now,” Bellatrix crooned, as if telling very naughty children that she was disappointed in them, “I think we ought to tie these little heroes up again. Where’s Cissy?” she asked Draco who grinned at her.
“I will announce any further changes in due course. Let the welcoming Feast – begin!” The trays and serving dishes spaced out down the length of the Slytherin table filled with food and while there was a smattering of applause, the school turned its attention to it’s dinner.
“Accidents!” Voldemort screamed, desperate now, but he did not strike and Hermione’s hand tightened around Draco’s. He held onto her. “Accident and chance and the fact that you crouched and snivelled behind the skirts of greater men and women and permitted me to kill them for you!”
“You’re wrong,” Draco said and his mother stiffened, her hands tightening their grip on his robes. He pulled away from her embrace. “She’s not
“Something wrong, lad?” Slughorn asked and Draco jerked his gaze over to his teacher. He hadn’t much liked Slughorn when he started last year, taking over from Snape, but Draco had to respect that the teacher knew what he was talking about. He was knowledgeable on a wide-array of potions and, pathetically, Draco rather enjoyed his softer form of teaching. Or maybe it was just some small way to spite Snape.
. Any correspondence was sent by a borrowed owl, anything to do with money or property was through respective lawyers. There were no pictures of him in the house, and Harry doubted that either of his boys would even know his name.
His Patronus, a Snowy Owl, swooped once, twice, overhead, and then landed softly on the alcove behind him. Draco whirled around to watch her and she clipped her beak at him, hooted softly, and then faded. His heart in his throat, he turned to Potter, beaming.
“I’m sorry – I can’t, I’m sorry–” she would say, slipping out of the room and leaving him feeling alone.
“I might as well. What did you do, anyway, to get put on as train monitors?” she asked, turning Tatiana’s trolley to rejoin the rest of their group, her daughter and Draco following along.
“Good,” Bellatrix spat. “Greyback, pick them up! The Dark Lord is coming, Harry Potter. Your death approaches,” she said with glee and Potter swayed a little where he stood, as if he was in an immense amount of pain. Draco was too, his Mark burning on his arm, but he pushed through it, gritting his teeth and focusing on the line of red on Hermione’s throat. The werewolf came forward and reached for the wands scattered on the floor.
“We’ll,” and Potter blinked rapidly, swallowing around the emotion lodged in his throat. “We’ll find a way to repair it,” he said, as if convincing himself and Draco gave him a sympathetic look, his head tilted slightly.
“Like Morgana I am,” Draco said, whipping his own wand out. He whirled it around his head and ran as the objects on either side of him began to cave in, sending piles of books and chairs and tables falling over Crabbe and Goyle. Draco didn’t even look back, sprinting as fast as he could, further into the room.
“The Dark Lord is most displeased with Rowle,” Mother said to him over breakfast, taken in her small drawing room off her bedroom. The elves had brought them eggs and toast and bowls of fruit but Draco could only nibble on one corner of buttered toast and the rest made his stomach roil.
“You bastard, Malfoy!” he shouted and one of the Gryffindor girls was crying and Finnigan was screaming and Pansy was watching from the first row with amusement as Draco stepped back, lifting his wand and breaking the spell. Finnigan wretched on the floor and Carrow was pulling Longbottom to the front of the class by his tie.
“I don’t believe it! Whatever was wrong with that girl, I don’t think she was a Squib. The Dumbledore we knew would never, ever have allowed–” she was saying and as Draco appeared she stopped speaking. They both stood on either side of the campfire, as though circling each other in a fight. Hermione’s eyes were bloodshot and her lower lip was trembling and Potter looked like he was one second away from breathing fire, he was so infuriated.
Draco squeezed his fingers over his eyes. "Because we're his family. I basically told him he wouldn't understand."
Draco gasped as Harry pulled back and reached for Draco's trousers, deftly opening the top and grasping his prize, his warm, familiar hand feeling so utterly perfect. "Yes. Merlin, yes."
It was simply too good to be true. Maybe it was because they were both gone so often that it was working as well as it was. It'd been nearly six weeks and, other than some arguments over the purple cushions — and let's face it, those had been more fun than distressing and had ended with excellent makeup sex — things had been relatively easy.
"Well, now you both concentrate on getting Harry better, and we talk to the social worker about moving Alex to a foster home until they find the family." She narrowed her eyes at Draco. "And
They'd been sleeping together for months but had both studiously avoided discussions of a relationship.
"Yeah, it goes both ways." Draco agreed, and the truth of that rang through his chest, making his breathing quicken. "So, I'm really sorry, and we can figure out the estate thing together. I'm sorry I fucked it all up, and I'm sorry I almost got you killed, and I'm s—"
"A few more hours, probably, but they're going to keep him here to monitor for a couple of days to make sure there are no side effects."
Tindles was another area of contention between them. Harry enjoyed cooking. So many years of cooking for other people made the reward of finally cooking for himself something he looked forward to. And yes, he really disliked cleaning, having been forced to clean up after the Dursleys for so many years, but it was because he hated it so much that he could hardly stomach making someone else do it for him. Like Tindles.
The sick feeling in his stomach he'd harboured all day was joined with the sting of disgust with himself. He'd been wrong, but he'd also been hurtful.
"Love," Harry said, so quiet that only Draco would be able to hear him, "I'll be sleeping anyway. Please. I need you to take care of yourself."
"Uh, would you like some?" Draco asked, trying to mask the awkwardness of someone's elf bringing him an unsolicited gift.
"I missed that smile," he said, a small smile on his own lips, but his eyes were still sad. "It's hard, watching you being all grown up."
Dudley's eyes glazed over, lost in memories, and Draco let him remember whatever it was, unable to move his attention away from the door in front of him.
She shook her head. "Not yet. Anyway, we found the mother's family. Well, what's left of them. She had an older brother who passed away from a drug overdose about a year ago. There's a sister, but she's living on the streets." She closed her eyes and her jaw clenched. This was hard on her, whatever it was.
He sat down next to me in the chair we'd both long ago accepted was his, and he didn't say a word. He just let me sit, listening to the rustling branches, lost in my thoughts.
He was there for me then, and he was there for now, as I went home alone after dropping that child off for his first Hogwarts adventure, and the darkness that I generally kept at bay was creeping into the edges of my psyche.
Alex's grandmother knelt between him and Lyra and put a gentle hand on each of their shoulders. "The
No, he didn't. He was more than happy to wait until Tindles came over at the end of the night to clean it all up, like the house-elf had nothing better to do.
He tasted so different than Harry would have ever imagined — if Harry had imagined such a thing as the taste of Draco Malfoy's mouth, which he was pretty sure he'd never done. It was like expensive tea and fresh-baked cake, and Harry couldn't do anything but enjoy the feeling of being plundered. Because that's what it felt like, and Harry loved it.
I slapped the knife down on the cutting board and turned to scrape the offending items into the sizzling pan. "I know he's at Hogwarts. The fact that my house is fucking empty has not escaped my notice."
Draco could finally see it, the big picture. All the pieces that were Harry Potter. There were still some pieces around the edges that were a little blurry, but it was no longer incomplete.
And he had my back every step of the way. He was there for me when I handed in my resignation, the new, single parent of a four-year-old boy who depended on me not to be injured or killed on the job.
Draco let out a little laugh before leaning in to nip at Harry's ear. "I think we both need to do better with it. Michelle says—"
"It's an adjustment to all of you, especially her." Molly's quiet movements, the clank of the spoon on the metal bowl, the chopping of the knife on the wooden cutting board; it all served to put Draco into a fog. He listened as she spoke, but he wasn't sure how much he actually took in. "...something to consider."
"Sorry," he muttered. "Harry and I had a disagreement this morning, and he left for work in a snit."
Teddy smiled. "Likely not. It's a good class, though. McGonagall makes sure he doesn't show any of the crazy stuff he used to when Harry was in school."
“Really Potter, have you lost all your dueling skills since killing Riddle? That was pathetic.” That worked. The air crackled as they started to duel.
“It's nothing Harry’ James starts. ‘You are just very much my son.” he says cupping his son's cheek.
“That is an Improvement. Cant you count the number of interactions that didn't end in hexes on two hands?” His mother commented.
Harry opened his. It looked similar to a muggle camera but things that are similar to the muggle world usually have very different purposes in the Wizarding world. “What’s it do?” He smiled.
“Um, my mom said to tell you thanks for bringing everybody back. And I also, Thank you. Also Neville told me what happened after you lied. So thanks for that and I'm sorry.”
And it's Harry. If you follow the Prophet he's had more relationships this year then all the other ones combined. The headline will be ‘Saviour with Reformed Death Eater Draco Malfoy’. I’ve been careful to keep out of the front page this year.
Then Snape who was more focused on playing spy, keeping Draco from comiting murder, and trying to keep Dumbledore alive.
"Malfoy Manor, guest parlor." Draco called as he dropped the floo powder and they disappeared in green flames.
She did not, however, give the points back. A fact that Harry found rather petty and caused him to lose a lot of respect for the woman.
"I'm sorry. My what? I don't remember filling out the paperwork for an emancipation." Harry asked as he followed Griphook to his office.
"And eat or drink nothing that the headmaster gives you without testing it for potions or other enchantments. Have at least two professors with you while speaking with the headmaster. Try to never be alone with him. Yes Grandfather I remember." Harry interrupted.
"No I think Ill take it. After all, he wont need it now." Ron and his small group of 'friends' laughed.
"Not yet sir. I have leave tomorrow as my classes have been canceled by the headmaster. I was going to follow him in my animagus form. Draco and I have both tried to talk to him about his health, but he insists that he has no idea why he is suddenly so ill." Snape couldn't help the slight twinge in his voice that signaled his frustration with this exact topic.
While normally Snape would applaud (quietly and where no one would be able to see) such a slytherin tactic made by a gryffindor, he would not stand for Harry to be just shy of passing out in his classes.
"Sorry? You're sorry. That's all you can say?! Not one of your so called friends have seen or heard from you outside of class in over a week and all you can come up with to say is 'sorry'. We were beginning to really get worried but its only quittich practice. Surely not since no one in their right mind would run an 11 year old for more than an hour or two. And yeah you may have made the team but surely the people who have been your family since you were four is more important than a sport team you weren't supposed to be able to join yet anyway. Though clearly I am mistaken." Draco ranted.
Draco floos first. He waits until they all come out of the floo to call for them. He holds Harry’s hand nervously. “Grobb, Jeal, Dobby, Hoffey, Blort, Evedy.”
Tonks let the letter sink in a bit before she left for Hogwarts. She was still quite shocked but wanted to read the letter about Teddy.
Harry continued looking at the increasingly red skin that had a blush flowing through it till he saw dark scars across Draco's torso and slowly walked over to him without Draco moving. When Harry got closer he recognised the shape of the scars and couldn't stop himself from reaching out. His fingers hovered over it when he asked quietly “Draco… Did I do this? Are these ones from me? From Sectumsempra?” Harry got quieter and quieter scared of the answer.
“I'm sorry, when were you bleeding out on a bathroom Floor Draco MALFOY?!” Narcissa questioned with anger bleeding into her words.
“Good try Dragon, you will not have Harry carry you. Now out of bed so we can have breakfast and do presents.”
"You know Draco, you don't have to come see me every weekend. I'm sure you'll start to get busy with school and I don't want you to feel like you have to come home."
Harry went to Ron’s so they could ride the Hogwarts express together one last time with Hermione, Neville, Luna, and Ginny.
“Hypothetically, If I knew of such 13 year olds who are now older I would still be under obligation to alert the ministry to unregistered Animagi Potter.”
“When we started this she asked me to try to trust you and I can't even answer some questions, and im failing her again, just like I always do, just like I failed father, and Severus, a-and Harry, a-n-”
“I-I-Sir I have no defense. I do carry the dark mark. I did fix the vanishing cabinet used to transport death eaters to Hogwarts. I was there for the capture and torture of all of those people even if i did not do the tourtering I did not stop it either. I accept whatever sentence you give me minster.”
Ginny, Luna, Pansy, Blaise, and Hermione planned a party for the repair of the Room of Requirement. They didn't tell everybody what The Room was but, those who knew what it was were happy to have it back.
The group of Kids, Harry, Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Luna, Neville and Adults, James, Lily, Remus, Sirius, Regulus went to hogsmeade together, even Draco and his friends joined them. The adults split off to the shrieking shack halfway through the day While the kids went to Hogs Head.
The wall of smell from the room behind it hit Draco as soon as he entered, and he clapped a hand over his mouth to stop himself from gagging. Potter wrinkled his nose but as soon as the door was shut, slipped out of the cloak anyway and Granger followed suit, leaving Draco still hidden under it. The room was dimly lit by a few gas lanterns, and Draco could see the woman more clearly now. She was hunched over with age, and her hands were mottled in the dim light, purple and blue with white knuckles. Her eyes were milky with cataracts and her skin was pale and fragile looking, like ancient paper. Draco was surprised she could have even guessed that there was anybody in front of the cottage – he doubted she could even see the tip of her nose.
“Fine, we have a plan, we just need to talk to some people.” Harry replied as they continued on their way.
“Well if you're going with her you can always just wait until you guys come home to start Auror’s. It’s not like they’ll ever turn you down. You're Ron Weasley.”
Harry chuckled as they both laid down in their beds. “Dick.’ Harry paused until the lights were all put out. They had stopped the privacy charms a little after they moved past their history. ‘Even so far as to house muggle-born children whose families don't approve of magic."
“So how do we cleanse a room? Especially if we can't get inside. And it was quite a large room of hidden things.”
“Draco,’ Harry started to explain both parts of that story ‘Voldemort called your father to find Snape and bring him back to Voldemort. Voldemort thought that the elder wand belonged to Snape and that's why it burned him, but the wand never actually belonged to Snape, the wand changes loyalty when it's won, or the previous owner is killed.
“Are you? If you were begging me you'd be on your knees.” Draco retorted with a smirk while Hermione giggled both of them knowing Draco already was going to say yes.
Sirius was good. He and Remus had figured out their relationship. Which was slowly progressing. James and Lily were back. He was Back. Harry was better than ever. Voldemort was dead. He and Regulus were back to how they were when they were little before Hogwarts. He didn't necessarily trust Harry’s choice in crush but he also knew he couldn't change it. He tried that with James and Regulus.
“I don't know. It was anonymous. I think Kingsley knows. There's been a rise of spontaneous large donations for a specific cause. If it were anything else I would guess wealthy Purebloods. But they probably wouldn’t support some of the things and they like to put their name on everything.”
Sirius and Regulus were slowly working through their relationship. AKA ignoring it until it blew up. There were more issues than just the war with them. They had a whole childhood to get through.
He sends Kreacher to gather Regulus and Sirius' hair from Grimmauld then go to the cave and get Regulus then the ministry to get Sirius. He starts the spell as the Elves from the great Hall come back.
They shared a look and both of them kissed James on his cheeks at the same time then spoke simultaneously. “Yes we do.”
This was the first time Harry was excited to leave Hogwarts. He was going back to a loving home with his parents. His parents decided to ride the train back too, even though they could’ve floo’d.
Draco woke to screams, shooting up he looked around till his eyes caught Harry tossing and turning in his sleep. “Harry, Harry wake up!Harry,” Once Draco realized that Harry wasn't waking he panicked and put his hands to Harry's head and focused his mind.
"It's fine Harry. There's going to be plenty of people watching me this year. Anyway goodnight Harry."
Remus seemed to be struggling with Tonks. They didn’t have a relationship before the war. Sometimes Sirius’ name was thrown about in their fights. But they were both doing great with Teddy. Well as well as new parents do.
They spent the first few days decorating and soon enough it was Christmas. Regulus was spending the morning with them but he would go to the Malfoys when they went to the Weaslys. Andy, Ted, Tonks and Teddy would also stay the morning with them. Teddy would go with them to the Weasleys but Tonks had a half shift in the afternoon.
Fifty-Four of Bellatrix Lestrange victims have received Anonymous letters with a Gringotts Vault as restitution for her crimes.
“I don't know Hermione. Draco did recognize me at the manor, I don't know why but he lied for me, and so did his mother”.
And your cranes are perfect and your duelling is the same as ever.” Draco finished letting a crane land on his finger and handing it to Harry with a small smile.
“No. They should be finished cleaning now. I offered to clean the room’s I actually use but Jeal didn't like it so I only clean my bedroom.”
“I was actually thinking about something Draco said earlier this year before we got together. We were talking about Hogwarts students not taking Latin even though spells are mostly Latin. He said I could use my political power to change the curriculum.
“Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy you will be kept in holding for another week while your sentences are put in place. Once you are released you will return to Malfoy Manor for two weeks at most while searching for a new house on the ministries approved list. If you'll follow me back please.”
His mother kisses his head. His father squeezes his shoulder. They both try to smile at him. He watches as they go to the Aurors and disapparate.
“You said Dark Magic infects the air, but only once it's released. Like my anger charges it but only if I let my anger into my Magic. A horcrux is a lot of Dark Magic but it's contained, until it's destroyed. Mostly it's so powerful that it infects the person who carries it. Voldmort’s Face always came out of the Horcrux. For most it was in smoke form, this one was fire, and the one Hermione and Ron destroyed in the chamber was water.”
“Alright everyone shut it!’ Ginny said from on top of a table. ‘We would like to congratulate and Thank Mr. Draco Malfoy for repairing the last restricted section of the castle allowing us to have this party.”
Draco led Pansy and Blaise through Muggle London. They had apparated the last time they visited Gregory’s bakery. They entered the shop and sat at a table.
“You weren't exactly wrong.’ Sirius said sitting next to Harry in a similar position. ‘I was unaware you felt that way about my death.”
Harry learned he definitely lied to Snape when he said his dad didn't strut. That was exactly what he did.
Regulus laughed as he opened his present. He stayed until after Dinner and Dessert before heading out to make a Christmas delivery.
Just Scenes that popped up in my head while writing this but I didn't want to actually add and place into the story so... =)
“Draco, do you know why my mother died for me, why yours lied to the most powerful wizard of all time for you?” Harry questioned gently.
Narcissa looked at Draco again before answering him, “I can't go. I'm on house arrest, Harry would you mind going?”
Harry watched as Draco relaxed up against the window in the moonlight. He closed his eyes and had a small smile on his face.
For most of it, Harry tried to get out of his head but couldn't help but think of the Hawthorn Wand up in his room.
One time when he was 6 he came home from the village and asked her why he didn't have a Grandfather from his dad's side. He saw a boy with 4 Grandparents and wondered where his fourth one was. He asked and she burst into tears and Dad had to explain to him that his Grandfather was in Azkaban. Where he was supposed to be for the rest of his life.
"I'm afraid that we lost a first year Chip Haldir…… also Draco Malfoy has not shown up for his escort" Flitwick ended quietly. Even when he said it sofly the hall quieted at the mention of Draco half looking at the headmaster and half looking toward harry, hermione, and ron at the gryffindor table.
Greg nodded and tried to keep the tears from falling. He failed. Draco hugged him around his shoulders. A second Later Pansy’s arms were around his waist and Blaise’s hand was on the back of his neck.
Draco walked over to Regulus and Handed him the stack of parchment. Regulus looked at it and started to flip through.
“Oh. I think that if they were safe I would very much like to go home. I don't know if I can change my thinking but if Voldemorts really gone I don't have much to fear anymore, I could easily find death eaters.”
“I think that we’ve done enough today right? I have to get ready to go back to school tomorrow. May I go now?” Draco said effectively shutting down anything about his father.
Andromeda had barely walked into the room when Malfoy knocked his ink off his desk in the corner. He was staring at Andromeda with wide eyes and seemed to stop breathing.
Harry looks at Hermione and she answers his silent question. “It's called Polyamary. It's referred to as a V in the muggle world.”
Mr Black would take my position for transfiguration. Hypothetically It would take quite high skill to teach 3 13 year-olds to be animagues.”
“Is it really that soft Potter? And why do I keep dreaming about this place?” He said with a dry throat realizing he was really thirsty.
“HARRY!’ Draco said harshly, making Harry jump ‘Sorry, Sorry, Just don't... don't read those ones please”
“We got her two days ago. She was a very special surprise. We figured it would just be easier to tell you all here.”
“Draco, look at me’ Lucius said gently pulling Dracos chin up ‘I will always love you. And I'm proud of the man you've become after everything you've gone through. You’re so much stronger than I ever was. Know that, even if you can't forgive me or dont trust me, believe I will always love you.” Lucius pulled Draco into a hug while Draco silently wept, Harry off to the side looking down to give them a resemblance of privacy.
“Im sorry, i'm sorry you just weren't waking up and I figured you wanted out, im sorry, i know that was personal i shouldn't have-”
Hermione was studying in the Library when Madame Prince called on her. Madame Prince refused to let owl’s in her library; she made them wait patiently outside. An unfamiliar owl was waiting for her. It flew off as soon as she took the letter.
Harry said “It wasn't an accident when my mother died protecting me, It wasn't an accident I defeated you in the graveyard, that I didn't defend myself in the forest tonight, that I survived and I'm fighting again.”
Regulus looked up from his book and realized no one else was eating. “Oh. Is no one else used to yelling at breakfast?” He asked looking at James last.
They stood for some time before Draco Questioned his father. “Father, why did you want us to come today?”
“Grobb! Jeal! Dobby!” He calls them. Hoffey, Blort, and Evedy are all at their other properties. They clean them out 3 times a year.
Hermione and Ron seemed to be doing fine but sometimes Harry would get dragged into an argument and had to help settle it.
"Reit. All Aurors, tae me," he called to the nearby Aurors, who fell into a horseshoe formation around Begbie, looking at him with rapt attention. "Mr. Malfoy “ere is confident “at his Father is inside, potentially wi' th' two boys. Team Alpha, ye will be enterin' th' property an' securin' th' entrance - the res' of us will follow suit. Misra, ye will be leadin' Team Alpha tae-," and then Harry tuned out because behind Begbie, a light flickered on in one of the rooms of the Manor. He grabbed Draco's arm and pointed. Draco turned to look and his jaw went slack.
“Look at this!” she said, and he squinted and leaned closer. “Harry, that’s the mark in the book!” she whispered to them both and Potter bobbed his head but didn’t look quite convinced. Draco could understand why – the mark was so worn that it was barely legible, made even worse by the darkness around them.
“Look – there!” he pointed as a pale rectangle of light appeared ahead of them, but Harry was diving suddenly and Draco screamed, tightening his hold around Harry’s middle.”What are you
. Harry took a deep breath and shook some of the tension out of his hands. "If anything happens to me, the boys go with M- with Draco. No arguments," he said and Draco made a small disbelieving sound next to him. Harry reached out a hand for him, and Draco took it, holding on to him tightly. "And if something happens to the both of us, then-,"
“Good morning,” Draco said politely and Potter grunted at him. He lowered himself down onto one of the logs and raised his hands over the fire, which was gently smoldering. “Can’t you use
“He’s in the Shrieking Shack. The snake’s with him, it’s got some sort of magical protection around it. He’s just sent Lucius Malfoy to find Snape,” he said, still in Draco’s arms. “Your dad thinks you’re dead,” he said simply and Draco shook his head.
“But he’s there!” she was pointing at Harry, her arm shaking, her voice tremulous and desperate. “Potter’s
“As we progress through the school year, you may notice changes to your classes as we receive new guidance from the Ministry of Magic, which is now under the leadership of Pius Thicknesse. In accordance with his directives, all Muggle-born students must be registered with the Ministry. I have asked your Head of House to assist any students with the required forms,” he said and Draco glanced over at the other house tables. The Mudbloods sat amongst them paled and turned with frightened expressions to their fellow students.
Longbottom offered out a hand to Hermione, who took it and he helped her climb onto the mantelpiece. Ron followed her and then Longbottom – he turned and reached out a hand to haul Draco up into the open passageway as well, grunting with the effort. Finally, Harry followed, and the portrait swung shut behind them. The passageway was carved from the earth and looked as though it had been here for decades. Brass lamps swung overhead and as they walked, their shadows seemed to warp around them.
He opened his eyes to that warm, inviting, dark space that he had inhabited so often recently, so he wasn’t surprised to see Potter sat waiting for him.
“I’m going to keep looking for my parents, all right?” he told her, a sharp edge to his voice that made Draco want to snap at him, but he turned and walked away before he could say anything, leaving them crouched in the snow.
The entire basis of his parents belief system was undone with this one revelation. The Dark Lord, this icon of blood purity, was a half-blood? He felt like someone had just smacked him, breathless and blistering all at once. Granger looked at him with something like pity.
“Did you get the cup?” Draco interrupted, not sure his sanity could take all this standing around, mooning over Ron. Ron juggled the fangs in his arms and wrestled something out of his jacket – the mangled remains of Hufflepuff’s cup.
"Thank you, for everything Griphook. I think I can take it from here." Harry said a little breathlessly.
"Please. I find it my personal responsibility to keep you away from those people. Honestly, how you would have survived the wizarding world without me is anyones guess. Regardless, thats enough of that. Lets find father and move this party along or no one would ever leave." Draco said once again taking Harry along as they searched for Uncle Lucious.
Once the little greeting song was finished, Professor McGonagall began reading names off her list and one by one they were sorted.
Harry had been sitting in a train compartment for about half an hour by himself. He had changed into his robes already, not wanting to deal with the rush of students just before arriving. His school robes were new for once and were made in a much finer material than he was really used to. Still, after spending a few weeks in the finer fabrics, he was slowly getting accustomed to it.
“A cup of tea would be nice,” he replied and she smiled and set to work, putting the kettle down a top the Aga and letting the water boil, fetching mugs from the cupboard and adding two sugars to one mug and half a teaspoon to the other. Harry watched her putter in silence, enjoying the easy quiet that came with being two very good friends.
Draco watched the three Gryffindor boys work, looking up as Hermione, Fleur and Luna approached. Hermione, unsteady on her feet but determined, held Fleur’s arm as she walked. Fleur, now wearing a white apron tied around her waist which had a bottle of Skele-Gro in the pocket, handed Bill a travelling cloak as she passed, which he swung over his shoulders. Luna patted Draco on the shoulder and then slipped past him. With a moment’s hesitation, he followed. They climbed up the slope and found Ron sitting shoeless and sockless, with Dean positioning a wooly hat on Dobby’s head.
Voldemort interrupted, his hand gripping his wand tight enough to blanch his knuckles. “But you did not!”
’. She was smart, resourceful and above all, she respected and loved magic in a way that Draco, who had always taken it for granted, never could. But his parents and their Dark Lord would never see that. They would only ever see the purity of her blood.
“Well, at least you can’t wear this one,” Draco said, giving the cup a look of disgust. “That is to say, I won’t be,” he added and Weasley cracked a grin as Hermione turned her head to look at the dragon, which was still drinking.
“I went to Australia. Birrarung Marr University,” Harry replied simply, and Malfoy raised an eyebrow in surprise.
“In here!” Hermione yelled from Draco’s left. He turned and slipped in behind the tapestry, finding himself standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Hermione in the cramped passageway that was previously concealed. She was currently running a hand comfortingly over Ron’s shoulders, and he wiped a hand under his eyes, looking up.
He chased them. He dove around spells and curses, his body incorporeal and moved by a force that Draco couldn’t quite control. It was like he was standing in place and the scene was just moving around him. The motorbike dodged and wove and all the while, Potter was still holding onto that cage, his dead owl sprawled across the bottom, her amber eyes open and unseeing. Draco watched with a sinking feeling in his stomach as the metal joints between the sidecar and the motorbike began to fail, and he spun out of the way of a stunning spell that Potter sent flying, missing the moment when the sidecar finally gave way. He dove to help in some way, but as he was immaterial, the sidecar went careening to the ground past him, the metal of the owl’s cage catching the light of the spells that darted through the night sky. Potter had been saved by Hagrid, hauled onto the back of the motorbike by the collar of his shirt, so they were sitting back to back. Draco watched as a pained expression went across Potter’s face as he raised his wand and pointed it at the falling sidecar, the cage and body of his owl still inside.
After a year of inaction, Draco graduated and Harry without anything to do, they had been contacted by Professor McGonagall the summer they turned 20, asking if they were interested in taking the Defense Against the Dark Arts and Potions Master positions at Hogwarts respectively.
They had parted so abruptly that Harry thought maybe he didn't really have enough of a chance to hate Malfoy long enough to stop loving him. He was there one minute and then he was gone, exiled to France with his books and potions and clothes and belongings all disappearing from Grimmauld Place overnight, leaving Harry with nothing but memories and two little boys who cried for their lost father.
“Are you okay?” Harry asked in a rasping voice and Draco laughed, which sent him into another coughing fit. Harry groaned and Draco rolled off him, pushing himself to sit. Harry followed suit, leaning heavily against the stone wall, surrounded by the shattered remains of the broomstick they had ridden to safety.
He had settled in for the night when the pain began again, burning at his forearm. He first tried to ignore it, hoping it would go away (though it never had any other night over the last few weeks), but eventually it grew into a searing pain. Screwing his eyes shut though tears streaked down his face, he balled the edge of the sleeping bag into his mouth and tried to muffle the screaming as much as he could. Another fresh wave hit him just as he heard footsteps pounding towards him and someone wrestling with the zip of his tent.
“I don’t know. I just fancy some music,” he told her with a shrug and she gave him an indulgent smile. Draco went and pulled free a jumper that was draped over the end of the bunk and started when something swung out from underneath it. “Oh, be careful,” Potter called from the other side of the tent, and Draco used a finger to stop the swinging item. It was a locket, heavy gold with emeralds studded on the front in the shape of an S. Draco frowned at it and went to use a finger to trace the S before Granger snapped at him.
“Do you know what changes in curriculum he was talking about?” she asked and Draco shook his head. She huffed. “Well I hope we know sooner rather than later – I’d hate to have my NEWT revision strategy all planned and then it all changes,” and without saying goodbye, she turned on her heel and strode away, leaving Draco alone in the corridor, feeling bereft somehow.
!” Neville shouted, and Fenrir ducked just in time, the spell shattered a stone Hogwarts crest on the wall. He raised his own wand and they began to duel.
“What is all this racket!” shouted the tall man who had just come out of the door, and the Death Eaters turned to him.
They had entered the building half an hour previously, but it had taken a while to get to the head of the queue for the exam check-in. They had both been given badges, pinned to the front of their suit jackets, which had their names and an examination number underneath. It had been explained that there would be no names on the desks, but their numbers instead and they were not to put their names on the examination papers. Harry had nodded and tried to suppress the tremble of his hands as he pinned the badge to his suit before rejoining Hermione in the atrium, where they now lingered, not talking.
There was no guarantee that Potter and Granger (for ‘Phineas’, whoever he was, had said that Weasley had left them) were even in Dalby forest now – they may have moved on. Still, it was the only information he had to go on, and he had to try. He leaned back to look upwards and was stunned to see the Milky Way bright above him. Years of Astrology lessons crept back into his mind and he tried to study the stars, but he was too tired.
Harry was waiting in the space at the end of the carriage, coaxing smiles out of tearful children as they passed. He joined Draco at the door and waved to their friends as the train gave another whistle and jolted forward.
’,” he told the wall and the stones glowed for a brief second and then groaned their acknowledgement. The stones slid aside, revealing the short passageway into the underground dungeon.
“Only dissenters would dare to use his real name. It preserves the cult around him,” he said and Weasley frowned.
"Thank you very much, Minister. Big news here, ladies and gentlemen, and we'll keep you up to date as the story unfolds. As the Minister urged you all, if you have any information regarding the disappearance of Albus Severus Potter and Scorpius Hyperion Potter, please contact the dedicated Auror floo line. In other news, broomstick sales have -," Harry waved his hand and the Wireless spluttered and went silent.
“Yeah. We need to look at his wand though. I don’t know how far we’ll get if he doesn’t have one,” she added, chewing on her bottom link anxiously. Draco cleared his throat and tapped his fingers against the mug, the sound absorbed by the snow in front of him. “Do you want a book or something?” Hermione asked and Draco twisted to pick up ‘
Draco had to appreciate the irony in riding his namesake to freedom. They had burst out of London and the dragon had flown higher and higher until the streets and cars were nothing but distant toys on the ground. Higher it flew still, taking them into wisps of cool cloud that soothed Draco’s blistered and raw skin. His hands were still tight on Harry’s hips, surely leaving bruises, but he still held on, terrified of losing his grip.
“Stay here,” Draco told her and she gave him a slightly offended look. “Stay safe, they’ll be all right,” he tried to reassure her, but she didn’t look convinced.
Potter was screaming something into the night as he fell, his wand lifted as he cast a spell, for what Draco couldn’t tell and then the Dark Lord was screaming to the final Death Eater “Your wand, Selwyn, give me your wand!” and he was coming level with Potter again, teeth bared, wand raised and Draco could only watch as he fell through the sky with Potter, waiting for the moment when –
“I say we jump when it gets low enough!” Harry shouted back and Hermione’s grip on Draco’s cloak tightened – she’d had it in strangle hold the whole way. “Straight into the water before it realises we’re here!” Harry continued and Draco wanted to strangle him, but he knew it was the right idea.
They had accepted, and had been working at Hogwarts for the past 17 years, side-by-side. On one quiet summer holiday afternoon, nearly 6 years into their tenure at Hogwarts, Harry had taken Draco to the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square, and there, in front of Turner’s
"Why are they my sons when they're causing you problems?" he asked and Harry shrugged, a small smile creeping on to his forced poker face. Draco's face turned a bit worried, and he nibble on a corner of the toast he held in his hand. He didn't look to have much appetite, but then, neither did Harry. "You don't think they're anxious about today, do you?" he asked, and Harry nodded slowly.
"Wherever they are, you'll find them, Mr. P," she said kindly, and then the office door was flung open as Ron and Hermione came running in. Hermione was on him in a second, knelt over him and pulling him into a hug, her body shaking. Ron stood nearby, looking pale, his freckles standing out starkly against his skin. Belinda patted his shoulder as she left, pulling the door closed behind her.
“Narcissa,” said a low, slurring rumble behind them and Draco turned to watch his father amble into the room. Where once a proud Lucius Malfoy had walked this Manor, a shell of him stood in his place. His father’s hair was stringy and untied, his clothes askew and his eyes bloodshot and bleary. He blinked at them heavily, like his eyelids weighed too much.
" he could hear, but his mouth felt like it was stuffed with cotton wool and he couldn't call out to reply.
“Well, my door is always open. Off you pop, Malfoy, don’t be late to dinner,” Slughorn said, waving a hand lazily to dismiss him. Draco turned on his heel, picked his satchel as he walked past and then was out of the Potions dungeon with a sweep of his robes.
It was all relatively peaceful until Weasley woke up. With the reminder that he had rejoined them, Hermione’s mood went sour and it cast a gloomy feeling over the tent, making them all quiet and sombre. Draco studiously read his book when Potter suggested he and Weasley go searching for mushrooms, and Draco didn’t want to interrupt them to remind Potter that the Hogwarts paper bag would be able to supply food. He watched Potter go with a tight feeling in his chest.
“It isn’t, actually. Harry pulled it out of the Sorting Hat in his second year,” she said and Draco nearly laughed again. He turned to Potter, who had gone a bit pink.
"I do - I just want to hear you talk about it. Talk about them," he said, gently, and Harry thinks for a bit, running his fingers over the cuff of the jumper. A thread feels like it's about to come loose.
“Don’t even think about it–” Ron snarled but before they could truly discuss it, the tapestry at the top of the staircase was ripped open, and two masked figures were revealed.
“Who says I’ve given up?” Aberforth replied and Harry crossed his arms over his chest, obviously annoyed.
“Good luck,” Harry murmured, and Draco gave him a shaky smile and then walked away to join the Fellow. They shook hands and then Draco followed him through the door. Harry sat, Draco’s mug in hand, and waited.
“Let’s talk about it another time, maybe?” Granger suggested. She picked up the book and went back to her original seat, picking up her mug of tea from where she’d left it on the ground.
The last days of autumn slipped away as October became November and the tent was cold at night. Draco bundled himself up in layers of t-shirts and jumpers, but he still shivered in his sleeping bag, and he would wake in the morning to light layers of frozen dew on the tent. It was slow to bounce up and fold away now, whatever charm had been on it fading with time. He had been away from Hogwarts for nearly three weeks now, and he was no closer to finding Potter and Granger.
“Why would I need one?” Father slurred and Draco felt an eyebrow involuntarily quirk in disbelief. Father had been in the bottle since that disastrous night on the Astronomy Tower, and hadn’t bothered to poke his head out since. Draco would be surprised if he had any idea what was truly happening in his house.
“It’s good to see you, Dobby. I didn’t know you were working here,” he said, gesturing to the kitchens. Dobby had disappeared from the Manor shortly before Draco returned home for the summer after his second year, and his father wouldn’t tell Draco anything about it, only that Dobby would not be returning. He had been one of the nursery elves that looked after Draco as a child before moving to the kitchens when Draco went to Hogwarts, and Draco had many fond memories of the elf.
He nodded. "I'm afraid to look. I used to always have it when he was away on missions, or even at work. He never used it, but it was there, you know? Just in case."
"Right," Draco said quietly. "And your room lacks any character because you don't have any preference there, either?"
But Harry was gone, closing the door gently behind him. The light click of the door echoed through Draco's chest louder than any angry door slam.
"Well, I figured it'd either turn into this or a brawl. Either way, the kids wouldn't need to see it."
Unfortunately, the tide was often low with Lyra sitting quietly, watching the telly or reading books, sometimes colouring in the corner. Alex would sit in the window seat of Teddy's old room for hours if they let him, staring out at the bleak November landscape, Cat curled in his lap and Caius sitting nearby, as if on guard. Occasionally, somebody would entice Alex into some activity and he'd light up for a short time—quiet, but animated—but as soon as it was finished, he'd be back in that window, his eyes sadder than any child's had a right to be.
Apologizing to Draco was at the top of my list for what to do next. It wasn't the first thing I was going to do, but for some reason, it felt like the most important. I wasn't even sure what I was apologising for. It wasn't like I'd been the one to yell at him and storm out, but I still felt like I'd wronged him.
How was he going to do this? Just, how? He had to face all those people who hated him — the neighbours, Marge, Dudley's friends — and he had to pretend to grieve the fact that the two people who had been supposed to care for him for sixteen years of his life and failed at it miserably, were dead.
Harry stopped pacing and threw up his arms. "Exactly! I don't know why he wants me there. It doesn't make any sense."
They stood and followed the other mourners to the graveside. Dudley and several men he'd introduced earlier as his friends from work carried the caskets to the graveyard, but Harry and Draco trailed behind. "I don't want to be here," Harry said suddenly, stopping in his tracks. "I don't want to watch this part. Can we go?"
let that happen. This small child that just showed up in his life filled a little Alex-sized hole in their family that they hadn't known was there.
But Ginny was right. He and Harry needed to talk. Draco loved Harry. He didn't use the words often as they didn't come easy to him, but he did love the berk, and he was sure Harry knew it. It just felt like he was constantly dealing with something Draco didn't understand, like Harry was holding a piece of himself away from Draco, something just out of view.
biography—was, unfortunately, too full of actual facts. Facts about his childhood, about his adventures in school and dealing with Draco, and yes, facts about the final battle.
Draco leaned over and kissed the crown of her head. "You're a good girl. Auntie Angie is on her way over to stay with you both, and Alex hasn't met her, so you make sure you're there when he wakes up, okay? And tell him I'll be back. I just have to go see Daddy for a while."
Harry sighed. He knew he was going to have to explain after everything today. He might as well start here. "I didn't know anything about Hogwarts until I got my letter. I thought I'd be attending the local comprehensive, and yeah, I was looking forward to it, but mostly because I wouldn't be there with Dudley. He was going to a posh school with expensive fees."
"Gods, yes. I want to see her too. And I want to see Alex, if you think you can bring him along. I want him to see I'm okay." He yawned. "Hermione says I owe him a thank you."
Draco's door stood open, and when Harry hesitated, Draco's posh voice rang out, "Merlin, Potter, I'm not going to seduce you. Just get in here."
"Mine locked me in a cupboard under the stairs until I was eleven," Harry shot back, mirroring Draco's position. He'd already told Draco some of this in bits and pieces, so he didn't think that should really come as a surprise.
Draco stopped moving the papers on his desk and looked up. "A little, I guess." Then suddenly it dawned on him. "Is that why you're bringing me lunch?"
Which was ridiculous. I knew it was. It had nothing to do with Teddy, my godson, going off for his first year of Hogwarts, and everything to do with me. So it didn't start then. Not really.
The house I'd raised Teddy in was nothing like Grimmauld Place. It was a sweet little cottage in the Devon countryside that Teddy and I had immediately fallen in love with. It had character, magic, and most of all, love.
Harry thought back. "She didn't write much for the last month or so, I guess. Usually, her letters are to us both, and they seemed fine. She talked about her friends and classes."
She smiled and kissed his cheek, then she moved to a group of women and began to pour them tea and coffee from a sideboard.
the answer to your being happy? Telling your bastard of a father to fuck off and deciding to do whatever you want to do, regardless of what everyone thinks?"
Stepping through the door to the inner shop, Harry felt like he'd been transported into a fairy tale. The walls were lined with refrigerators stocked full of blooms of various colours and varieties. A wrought iron garden table and chairs were nestled amongst the flower arrangements, and a similar bench balanced the other side of the room, inviting the shopper to sit and enjoy the sensory experience the little shop offered.
Draco didn't doubt that, but… "I don't want you to make a big decision like this just because you got hurt. This is what you've always said you wanted."
Harry took his hand. "Listen, what I said last night. I meant that. Please. Whatever you see or hear today, please don't let it change anything." His voice broke and Draco leaned over, pulling Harry into his arms as well as he could from where they sat. "I'm so afraid it'll change things," Harry said into Draco's shirt.
"Which is six months longer than you and Longbottom were together before you fucked off to the beach and came home married, so I don't want to hear your diatribe," Draco replied, irritation needling at his chest.
She nodded and patted his hands. "Well, you've both come a long way in talking things out. I'm sure it'll be fine. Try to remember to attempt to see his side of things."
I was angry, I knew that. Gathii had broken my friend's heart, and I didn't want to see that happen again. I was also disappointed because the day I'd planned hadn't come to fruition. Simon would say both of those feelings were natural, that they were normal.
"Yes, all right. Sorry." He cleared his throat and moved to perch on the edge of the coffee table, closer to Draco and the children. "Okay, Alex," the Healer said, his voice gentler now, "I just need you to close your eyes and lean your head back on Draco's shoulder. Listen to my voice."
Harry looked better when they entered the room. The monitoring charm was steadier, and Harry's breathing was even and deep.
Dudley must have seen the anger in Draco's face, and he took a step back, but he didn't run. He straightened his shoulders, ready to take anything that Draco could give. And maybe that's what made the difference. Maybe that's what made Draco calm down and really think about what Dudley had said.
I placed my hand in his, and the corners of his mouth twitched. "Let's do this," he said quietly, and I let myself relax, returning his half-smile.
He'd almost forgotten the boy was there. When he'd come home from the hospital, Lyra had claimed most of Draco's attention while Molly had filled him in on everything, forced a bowl of soup into him, and then shooed him off to sleep. Alex had been sitting quietly in a corner of the sofa, watching the telly.
Nodding, Alex curled up in a ball, his little body shaking slightly. Draco walked over and covered him with a blanket, and when the boy didn't flinch away, ran his hand down his little arm like he sometimes did for Lyra when she was upset.
"Thank Merlin," Draco said, thinking of the boy he'd seen grow into the young man lying in the next room. "Gods, he really got lucky, didn't he?"
Draco nodded and turned to fluff Harry's pillow before laying back down. "You know what you like, you just haven't experienced enough to have opinions on some things yet. That's not boring. That's just smart."
"Hi," Draco said after a deep breath, careful to keep his voice quiet and calm. "I'm sorry I woke you. You seem really tired."
Hermione's brow furrowed. "Shit," she muttered. She met his gaze. "We don't know where he is and sending a Patronus might make things worse. And honestly, if he can't respond, that won't help."
It seemed to Draco that his days mainly consisted of waking up randomly to people talking. This time, it was the low rumble of Harry's chest under Draco's ear.
"Molly said he's been napping with Lyra," he said, confused. "And I woke up with him curled into my back earlier. I don't think he wants to be alone. I mean, he can use Teddy's old bedroom if they insist, but—"
I sat across from him on the first day of training, confused and suspicious. We were no longer rivals, but we weren't friends either, and his sudden desire to enter law enforcement seemed incongruous with the Draco Malfoy I knew.
