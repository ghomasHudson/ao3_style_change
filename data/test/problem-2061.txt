She taps a finger to her lips, considering. “Draco protected all of us, but flung himself over Harry.”
“Will you write me a formal invitation?” Max asks, smirking. Harry sighs through his nose, the candle in front of him flickering out.
Draco looks up at him, his face the picture of remorse and suddenly, Harry knows the night will no longer go the way he’d hoped. Draco steps back, his hand moving from Harry’s hair to his face, his thumb rubbing across his cheek.
Harry is moving before he even realises, pulling her to him in a giant bear of a hug as Ron shouts another “oi” at their backs.
“Yes,” Malfoy hissed. “The heat crackling and licking at our bootheels. Remember, Harry? The feel of it, the intensity.”
” the man says, straightening to his full height, smirking. He’s haughty and achingly beautiful behind the pair of dark shades hiding his eyes from view.
Thank you for waiting for this update! Life on my end has gotten even more insane than what we've already all been living through. The chapters are written. I shall persevere with posting them.
“I don’t believe him,” Harry says, voice filled with a self-righteous conviction Draco hasn’t heard since their school days. When he realises it’s on Draco’s behalf, he preens, his feathers filling out just a tad.
This is met with an effusive shrug. “I’m a father. I cry at everything.” He points behind Harry and Harry turns to look. “See that bird? Beautiful, that bird is. I could cry just watching it fly.”
Draco moves to retort, but Scorpius holds him by the shoulders and glares at him. A silent conversation passes between them. One too full of harsh reality to speak aloud. His son knows him too well, and Draco is too cowardly to admit that he’d been hoping for death… encouraging its inevitability, courting it, even. The war inside him between losing Gabrielle and remaining behind to care for his son has been shredding him in two all these months, and it seems he’s done a poor job of hiding the pull he’s felt in the darker direction.
“Fuuuuu—Yeah,” is all Cecilia can get out before Malfoy shoves both her and Cameron out of the kitchen, much to their collective dismay.
Hermione sighs, and begins her ascent up to Luna’s newest discovery, which won’t turn out to be a discovery at all, just some moss she thinks is magical on an errant rock. Nevertheless, Hermione gathers a glass vial from her satchel and hands it over to Luna for collection.
The air around her fills with a static silence, the hairs on the back of her neck standing on end. She waits, lip bruising from her own teeth as she anticipates what could happen next.
turns to his flatmate and says in a perfectly calm tone, “Cameron, are you aware that you’ve brought the Saviour of the Wizarding World into our humble abode?”
Hermione refuses to believe this because every time she insists they return the next day to see whatever important thing Luna must see today, no matter the occasion or quest, the weather forecast inexplicably and suddenly looks dire.
Harry had discovered this revelatory distinction one fateful day in his early twenties. He’d been reading through Sirius’ old diaries in the attic of Grimmauld Place, feeling lost and alone, when a deed slipped free from the pages, written entirely in Irish and smelling of peat smoke. A quick translation charm later and Harry sat back on his haunches, laughing. He was covered in dust, his tear-streaked face puffy and glasses smudged, browbeaten and utterly depressed and yet, all this time, he’d owned land in Ireland and had never known. Sirius had somehow managed, even in death, to give him something to distract him from his darker thoughts, and for that, Harry was eternally grateful.
“Knew you could do it, mate!” Charlie shouts again, and if Harry could call back to him at that moment, he would with an unbridled joy he hasn’t felt in years.
Harry rubs at the back of his neck and Draco tsks, walking over to his bed and plopping down, silk robe falling open around him and pooling at the crooks of his elbows in an elegant display that Harry is half-convinced wasn’t entirely unintentional. Draco’s bare shoulders stand out to Harry as shockingly intimate in this setting, his skin painfully beautiful in the morning light, like an overripe peach that would bruise from Harry’s touch.
The sun is slowly slouching towards the horizon, leaving the warmth of the day to sizzle out into something much more bearable now that the long shadows of trees, chimneys stacks, and church spires make their cool path over the grass towards Harry and Draco’s spot on the patio behind Grimmauld Place. In the garden just beyond, Teddy whoops and calls out in joy as he flies around the narrow lanes of honeysuckle and bramble, overgrown tomato plants and drooping sunflower heads. Harry turns to watch him chase an unsuspecting bumblebee around a long-decommissioned fountain in much need of repair.
“Draco,” she says, over and over, attempting to console him but finding her own tears mixing with the blood pouring from her boy’s beautiful face. “Draco, please!”
They sit quietly for a while, Luna swishing her hands back and forth over the multicoloured bubbles. She conjures a rubber duckie for a bit of levity and feels Hermione smile against her scalp.
“I don’t want to alter it, though, do I?” Draco asks, voice muffled from his swollen nose. He’d been crying most of the day.
“Oh shit.” Harry scrubs a hand through his hair, his mind racing. He fumbles as he rips at his belt; he can’t get his flies open fast enough when Draco’s looking at him like that. This had been his idea, but Draco has taken the reins and Harry needs desperately to catch up.
They slowly make their way off the jetty and through the front gate, Luna guiding Draco with gentle coos and soft hums of the melody she’d sung to him earlier. To Hermione’s astonishment, Draco goes willingly, nodding his head along with her words, and at one point, Hermione spies a little smile at the scarred corner of his mouth. His right cheek dimples with the gesture, giving him a roguish appearance, as if he were a pirate Luna had lured into shore with her siren song.
“Is Draco the kinda guy who’d fancy joining us some time?” Max says, coming up behind Harry and wrapping his arms low around his waist. He fits himself along Harry’s back, the bulge in his jeans speaking to the kind of activities Max has on his mind. The suggestion sits like a lead balloon in Harry’s stomach.
“Fuck,” Harry curses through clenched teeth, and Draco opens his eyes to catch Harry watching with rapt attention. Draco maintains eye contact as he sucks him down, hollowing his cheeks and giving as good as he got. Harry’s eyes flutter shut, his head falling back on his shoulders as Draco works him, his tongue pressing flat against the underside of Harry’s cock.
Draco kisses her cheek, stoops to grab his wand and Apparates away, Muggle tourists be damned. He pretends he doesn’t hear Potter calling his name as he goes.
“She likes to point it out. It’s because we’re changeable, two-faced.” He kisses the stars that signify each twin. “Hence the mirrored marking.”
Potter’s reaction is twofold: he smiles at Draco, blinding and white, and then Potter presses forward with his hips, eager with excitement. Draco moves against him, a moan escaping his throat at last as he gives in, plunging his hands into Potter’s hair to finally tease out those tangled locks, if only to keep himself from erasing those few inches left between them and attacking Potter’s mouth with his tongue. Draco can’t, not here, not like this with Cameron snapping away, capturing an intimacy that should be theirs and theirs alone.
Draco’s too stunned to comment, thrilling at the delicious zing down his spine at getting such a rise out of Potter. When Draco doesn’t answer, Potter moves his hand to Draco’s hair, pulling it taut to expose Draco’s throat.
Looking to her son, she shifts in her seat and away from the creature, attempting to block the elf’s insistent babbling. “Draco, you haven’t been taking your potion?”
Max leans close and squeezes his bicep. “I know.” He then sits back, scooping up a forkful of mash, assessing it, and curses. “Fuck, if you keep cooking me meals like this, I’m moving in.”
“Draco’s on the—” Hermione begins to explain, but Mr Lovegood is floating a silver tea service into the living room, singing all the while, and interrupting her yet again.
The man smirks, wicked and wild, before leaning in to whisper, “You’ve had too much to drink, my friend.” He nips at Harry’s ear and Harry shivers, wrapping his arms around the man’s satin waistcoat, wanting to keep him close.
“That you’re stuck with me now.” Draco tucks his chin to kiss Harry’s palm, his lips warm against Harry’s skin.
“And yet, here we are.” Malfoy leans his elbows on the railing, eyes sharp with focus as he openly takes in the couple moving against one another. “A bit of voyeurism never bothered you before,” he adds, fishing out another cigarette from his fast-dwindling pack.
Two seconds later the door is reopened. Cecilia, with her curls piled up in a silk scarf atop her head, stands before Harry smiling, arms held open wide in welcome.
Smirking, Draco sips his milk-laden tea and waits. He watches Cecilia's composed facade of pureblood heiress slip into the jittery-kneed, flamboyant gossip Draco knows her to be within mere seconds. She folds her arms across her chest and huffs out a "
Taking a moment, Draco pauses, standing taller than he had before, pulling the sides of his robe together as if the action were a true gathering of his thoughts. He looks about as if seeing the room through Harry’s eyes, then starts by pointing to a jade plant in the far corner, explaining how its leaves wrinkle when in need of watering and plump like bloated green pillows when it’s fully sated. Harry allows himself a grin, listening intently as Draco guides him about the room for the next few minutes, pontificating over each plant and its uses in turn.
Draco hears the creaking floorboards as Bill enters the room, as if summoned by Fleur’s discomfort alone. He turns in time to see Bill place a consoling hand on Fleur shoulder before bending down to press a kiss against her neck. “Chatting bonds, I see,” he says upon standing once more.
Harry snorts, but nods. Sure. Why not. Stuck up. Stiff upper lip. Keep calm and carry on. Any and all of them would suffice.
Just as they’re pushing through the door to head to an Apparition point—George, Ron, and Neville boisterously singing a ballad they heard on American Muggle radio—Harry turns to Draco and puts his hand to his chest. Draco halts, looking down at Harry, one elegant eyebrow raised.
The woman is wearing a light evening jacket that goes to her thighs. It keeps her covered as Malfoy and Harry hear the clink of a buckle being undone and the hiss of a zip lowering as the man moves to push up her tight skirt. Their faces are hidden, sequestered as they are in the shadows of the canal, much to Harry’s relief. Some intimacies, no matter how exhibitionist these people are, should remain secret.
“Teach me to play pool,” she repeats, nudging his side, needing to distract him from such dark thoughts. She and Harry know better than most that you can’t bring back the dead once they’re gone, no matter how much you’re willing to sacrifice for such power.
“They were simply delicious looking, so I just had to—” the voice trails off as she enters the kitchen and Harry turns, spotting what he assumes to be Cecilia with a canvas tote bag slung over one arm, two courgettes in hand, slack-jawed.
Hermione squeezes his shoulder, her other hand pushing back the hair off his sweat-soaked face. A motherly gesture he eagerly leans in to, needing the comfort.
Cameron tells Harry about his two “dreadful but darling” housemates, gesticulating wildly the entire time as they ascend a Turkish spiral stairwell that Harry isn’t entirely sure can hold their combined weight. He looks out the open archways to the interior courtyard beneath and feels a sense of nostalgia for a world he’s never known. The sensation leaves him uneasy as he reaches the top step.
He feels the presence of someone slipping into the chair beside him and when he opens his eyes from the onslaught of his mother’s penetrating guilt he sees a long plait of sandy hair, sun-kissed skin, and a soft smile directed his way, shy and earnest. Gabrielle is holding out a plate of honey-glazed carrots drizzled in rich balsamic, a look of encouragement on her delicately featured face and a glow of purest amber encircling her head like a crown.
Draco smiles down at him, wicked and wanting. Harry submits to that smile with ease. He kisses Draco until the golden light of the afternoon turns orange with the onset of early evening. The pigeons coo softly on their perches, the tide laps at the crumbling stones beneath them, and church bells ring out in the near distance, the quintessential sounds of Venice pulsing with life all around them. Draco’s hands twist into Harry’s curls as he tugs him ever closer and Harry eagerly gives in.
Behind them, the click of a shutter sounds. Cameron has his camera out, lens trained on Potter. Draco hisses in distaste, adrenaline still pumping through his veins. He stands and boldly moves to sit beside Potter on the opposite side of the boat, blocking Cameron’s view.
There’s a devilish smirk at the corner of Draco’s mouth. Harry licks his lips at the sight. Draco raises up a canvas tote that clanks with the inviting sound of glass bottles held within. Both Neville and Harry cheer.
Fleur’s answering smile is a lament. Her eyes are so filled with sorrow Draco’s throat tightens with responding emotion. Fleur nods through her tears, holding their hands tightly in her own and speaking rapidly in watery French about the beauty of a Veela’s love and how fulfilling their lives will be with each other as bonded mates.
“I’m sure Max will want to hear how the trip is going,” Hermione says, hands on her hips. Luna is watching her closely from her perch on the loveseat. She doesn’t look at all pleased.
Draco doesn’t answer. He simply shrugs. The movement looks awkward on him since his wings shift with his shoulders. Harry shakes his head and begins to pace. Draco crosses his arms and leans against a lamppost, one leg bent at the knee, foot resting against the base. He’s tied the cloak Harry gave him about his waist with a bit of fisherman’s twine and it hangs like a tunic over his thin frame. Under the golden lamplight, he looks like a fallen angel from one of Mrs Weasley’s Muggle romance books that no one is supposed to know she reads, let alone lends Harry once she’s finished them.
Draco lets out a dry sob, silent into his son’s shoulder. “I’m sorry,” he mouths, his voice forgotten.
“Unacceptable. Another round!” Neville exclaims and tucks his long legs beneath him, only to stumble into the cash register upon standing. It dings and opens with a pleasant pop. Neville twirls around, beaming down at Harry. “We’re rich.” He gestures back at the machine but it’s already shut itself with a
“Remember the night Scorpius came down with the red fever?” Draco asks, a week after the foal incident at the cliffs.
Draco takes a step back and stares down at his shoes as if they’ve just been pissed on by an untrained crup.
Draco jumps, turning to see Charlie leaning against the counter, strong arms crossed over his broad chest, easy smile in place.
Draco stills, blinking at the sight before him while simultaneously panicking at the thought of what lies behind him in the dim light cascading through the bedroom doorway. “Scorpius.”
Narcissa does not shy away from the disbelief and anger that casts a heavy shadow over Harry’s face. Seeing his hand drop from Draco’s arm emboldens her further, and she steps closer, brandishing her forever altered appearance under the boy’s fool-hardy nose. As if the slash across Draco’s face wasn’t enough to confirm the danger Draco poses to himself, she lets the boy see the damage he’s done to his own mother.
“‘Added your own?’” Draco repeats, curling his lip, realisation dawning. “Oh Merlin,” he says, turning to Harry. “Have you actually been wanking off over the rocks so that you can ride your Firebolt around the back garden?”
“Better?” Luna inquires after a few moments, and Harry nods, trudging forward in the direction they’d been heading.
“Thanks,” he says, nuzzling against the feathers. Draco shushes him in response, dragging his nails gently through his hair, coaxing him to sleep. But before Harry can fully succumb to the tempting charms of such a void, he turns his head up, his lips seeking out Draco’s once more.
“Want you—so fucking much,” Harry’s saying, incoherent as he pushes his pants under the swell of his balls, his cock springing free. He hisses at the chill of the wind, eyes closing at the shock, but opens them a moment later at the heat of Draco’s hand closing around him. Harry’s head falls back; he’s done for. “Fucking hell.”
Harry raises an eyebrow at her in question. She reassures him with a pat to the cheek and then taps the blank wall with her two fingers, marking the sign of the cross onto the plaster. Instantly, the wall unfurls, revealing an ancient set of gilded doors with the Venetian lion of Saint Mark roaring proudly as the panels settle on their gold hinges.
Draco’s eyes are closed, leaning into Harry’s attentions like a kneazle nuzzling an owner’s hand. “And?”
“I think you are, Harry.” Luna adds, watching a pebble bounce violently off the ground with growing concern. “Hermione’s right.”
George’s returning smile is frighteningly eager. Harry feels it’s his duty to warn Draco of what he’s getting into but feels entirely too content leaning into his side for support at that moment to pipe up.
“How long have you lived here?” Harry tries again at conversation, and this time, Malfoy turns to him, eyes narrow as he pushes out smoke through his nostrils.
He allows himself to be wrapped up in Harry’s whole world, feeling his desperate need returned to him in the straining tension of Harry’s arms. Draco can’t help the sob that escapes at the relief that knowledge brings him, that he isn’t alone. He squeezes his eyes shut and nuzzles his tear-streaked face against the warm, soft skin of Harry’s neck, never wanting to move from that spot again. Inside his mind’s eye, he can see, like the sun rising over the horizon, a small flare of light awakening on the water.
“Make yourself at home, why don’t you,” Malfoy drawls and Harry pauses, breathing deeply through his nose, searching for patience. He looks over his shoulder and spots Malfoy unlatching his watch and slipping it into his pocket. Malfoy’s hands are shaking.
“I see.” Draco stares down at the steam rising steadily into the night air, his face pinking from the residual heat. After a moment, Harry sees resolve firm in his eyes and watches as Draco turns to drape his dressing gown over a nearby stone wall. Harry’s breath catches at seeing the silver fall of Draco’s silken hair brush across the lines of his back when Draco pulls his nightshirt over his head, followed by his matching trousers, exposing endless amounts of cream-coloured skin to Harry. Along with a rather skinny, yet pert backside that Harry remembers quite—
“Hot water, clean cloth, and a cup of chamomile and raspberry leaf tea. Brewed for exactly four minutes, Mr Malfoy. Go!”
They’re climbing, higher and higher above the cursed waves, away from the danger, the bike’s engine sputtering and backfiring as they ascend. Draco’s coughing up saltwater, his throat raw from his heaves and his body shivering with the cold. He doesn’t care, as soon as he feels the wheels touch down on solid rock he’s pushing himself off the back of the blasted bike and falling to his knees in front of the foal’s face.
Slightly worse for drink, Draco eyes the looming, leather-like wings of the Thestral with skepticism. Its cloudy eyes stare back at him, assessing and, to Draco’s pride-filled horror, finding him wanting.
Draco shifts his chair closer to his son and places a hand across his wrist. Scorpius looks up at him.
“What?” Harry rolls his hips in an eager rhythm, their sweat easing the friction between them yet by no means dimming the spark.
“Draco,” she implores, squeezing his hand. “Were you taking anything? Eating anything with regularity that we’ve failed to provide you here?”
Harry laughs. It echoes through the brush, carried off on the wind. Luna likes to hear that laugh,  likes to see the lines that form at the corners of Harry’s eyes when that laugh pushes past his smile. She wishes she heard that laugh more often.
They sit quietly for a few moments, the only sounds around them are the small swirls of the water and the gentle neighing in the distance coming from the Thestral stables around the other side of the cottage. Draco sinks further into the pool, leaning his head back on the smoothed stone behind him, staring up at the sky.
“Shit.” Harry follows both of them, cursing the whole way. “Draco,” he calls out, watching him jump over the sitting room couch and make for the balcony doors.
“Shut up,” he says, without bite, and steps into her arms, allowing her to envelop him in her warmth and security. “I’m an idiot,” he tells her.
Bill nods, moving to sit in the chair across from them, long legs crossing. “Sure. Everyone fights.”
She squeezes his fingers. “You saved that little foal, and Harry saved you. You did a noble thing, Draco.”
When Harry blinks his eyes back open, he’s in the hustle and bustle of the St. Lucia train station once more, the streaks of sunlight slanting further across the tile floor since he’d last left. He flings himself down the wide front steps of the incongruously modern building, dodging students and sightseers alike. He finds a secluded corner in a back alley nearby and spins into the belly-tight tug of Apparation, landing himself on the threshold of Draco’s flat within minutes of arriving back in Venice. He raises his fist to knock just as his anxiety spikes and he hesitates, smile dying on his face.
“Next time, I want you to fuck me,” Harry says against the small of Draco’s back, leaving a wet kiss at the dip of his spine. He tucks his other hand beneath Draco’s hips, his fingers encircling Draco’s neglected cock in a determined grip. “I want this beautiful cock inside me so deep, Draco.”
“I cannot, in good conscience, administer any form of medicine to a patient without knowing its exact contents and uses.”
Harry listens to her and then rolls his eyes, answering Luna. “She’s something, alright.” He runs a hand through his hair and dares to look back at Draco, whose wings have puffed to twice their normal size, completely hiding him, and most of the sofa, from view. Harry’s stomach aches.
The fabric of the world ripples around them, revealing the hidden city in all its twilight coloured splendour. Xenophilius is off like a shot as soon as the image solidifies before them, robes billowing out behind him like the unfolding golden petals of a sunflower. Luna chases him, eager to keep up, wondering at his strange behaviour. She hears Harry call out behind them, but she ignores him in favour of following her father.
“But what if you harm yourself—” she starts, then halts when she notices the look of shock come over Harry’s face, followed curiously by comprehension, as if he has just slotted a puzzle piece into its proper place. He turns, staring at Draco as if seeing him for the first time.
Feigning confusion, Cecilia tilts her head to the side and starts speaking the Venetian dialect so quickly, and with so many hand gestures, that Draco flings himself from the bed, naked as the day he was born, just to be rid of her.
Draco feels Harry approach even before he scents him on the wind. There’s a whirling in his belly, a brewing tempest of emotion that matches the storm gathering strength just offshore along the purple horizon. The sun has just slipped behind the endless blue of the sea and Draco breathes in the crisp air of dusk as night quickly approaches, along with Harry’s footsteps. He takes the final sip of the tea Mipsy brought him and looks over his shoulder.
Luna continues to stroke Draco’s feathers, her golden hair falling in a curtain over her shoulder, hiding her face from view.
“That is, if you’d like to, Mr Malfoy,” Teddy adds, his placating nature showing along with a cool blue glow of his aura, its effect calming Draco’s nerves. The mischievous smile he pairs with the invitation, however, is totally a Weasley influence along with the chosen colour of his ginger hair save for one streak of jet black to match Harry’s.
Sighing, Harry moves on, distracted by the long trailing vines of a plant hanging from a ceiling beam in a macrame hanger. He reaches out to touch its heart-shaped leaves, feeling them brush back against the pads of his fingertips in a friendly greeting. Harry smiles.
An awkward silence falls over the sitting room, which feels jarring since everything was going so well mere seconds ago. Cecilia slumps into Malfoy’s abandoned chair, looking forlorn. Even the plants seem to dim in Malfoy’s absence.
“Not yet, Harry,” Draco whispers. Harry feels himself being pulled up and away from the water and into the air. His eyes have closed, his limbs piliant and limp.
“Fuck,” he says, chest heaving. He’s on his back, leaning on his elbows as he looks up at the literal ruin they’ve made of an ancient temple which, according to Luna, was supposed to be indestructible. Draco is flung across Harry’s body, head buried in his neck, his wings spread out over all three of them. He’s protecting them. Harry grins down at Draco’s messy head, feeling bewildered and a little punch-drunk at the realisation. He flops back onto the ground, and heaves a relieved sigh only to choke on the dust-filled air a moment later.
“Ear-scrambler charm, mate,” the man in the bikini and raincoat says, leaning into Harry’s space. “Sounds like gibberish ta Muggles.”
The guard’s salt and pepper mustache twitched with amusement. “You floo home,” he said, gesturing to a fireplace embedded in the wall beside them complete with a pot of floo powder and a cheerily crackling fire that had most certainly not been present a moment prior.
“Nah, let’s bring him,” he says before gathering up his freshly-altered robes and heading to his room to gamely change into them. He ignores the mirror once he’s donned his waistcoat. His billowing crepe sleeves and buttoned-up cuffs look ridiculous enough as he steps into the low-heeled satin shoes Hermione insisted he wear; he doesn’t need to see the entire ensemble reflected in front of him, no matter how many times the ancient gilded glass coos ‘
“I got it!” Harry shouts, pushing hard on the ancient wood of the door, hearing it creak beneath his fingers.
The sitting room is just as green as Harry had left it, and with the afternoon sun pouring in through the floor-to-ceiling windows at his back, the verdant leaves and vines appear to be glowing in their pots from the ambient light.
Potter chuckles against him. “No you won’t,” he whispers, dropping a hand to press a thumb into the v of Draco’s hip, massaging circles into the ticklish skin he finds there. Draco hisses at the sensation.
“Who’s that?” Max asks. He’s pointing to the picture of the opening night celebrations for Harry and Neville’s Herbology shop that hangs on Harry’s kitchen wall. It’s been magicked still for Max’s visit, along with every other photo in the house.
Gentle hums echo in Harry’s mind. Soft notes of satisfaction and contentment course over Harry like fingertips trailing down his skin, tickling and teasing him into smiling. His body melts into the rock beneath him from the attentions, and the heavy blanket of sleep threatens to pull him under.
Draco glares down the camera lens at Cameron, and he finally shuts up, though he doesn’t stop taking pictures.
“Brilliant! My child is brilliant.” He twirls on the spot, his buttercup yellow robes billowing in the wind. There are blue stains dotted all along his front. Luna wonders what concoction he’s been brewing.
Luna presses a kiss to her forehead. “I know, love.” Luna also knows that her extensive, hard-learned knowledge about Veela, their ailments, and biology, would be most helpful in aiding Hermione’s exhaustive efforts. But stepping on Hermione’s toes when she’s on the scent of discovery is not something Luna is fond of doing. She has faith in Hermione and her endless need to find the reasoning behind all things, she just wishes she could offer help without hurting her love’s pride.
Harry storms out of the stables, shoving the messy tangle of his too-long hair out of his face. He sees Hermione just outside the house, tickling a barn cat under the chin and makes for her, anger flaring at the news Charlie had just inadvertently divulged to him. Beneath him, the heather shifts away from his strides, folding itself aside in a straight seam leading directly to Hermione’s feet.
The three of them have a rather perplexing conundrum on their hands, one Harry is certain Hermione never considered planning for despite her endless lists and lengthy itineraries. The conundrum being the transport of a (somewhat) feral Veela across an entire island via Apparition.
Harry turns away, awed and feeling conflicted at now finding himself in the strange position of being attracted to all three of the inhabitants of the flat behind him.
Several agonising seconds pass before the seam of pearlescent feathers part, revealing Draco and Luna beneath. The inky black talons of Draco’s hands laid gently over Luna’s arms stand out in stark contrast to her pale skin; her complexion is so similar to Draco’s. He’s holding her in his lap, her head tucked under his chin. He’d done that to Harry, Hermione notes, after he’d brought him back here. He made sure Harry was safe, he’s doing the same now for Luna.
Charlie is running his hand through his ginger hair, streaked with strands of white, making it appear almost blonde. “He’s in a mood.”
“I mean you don’t owe me kindness. No one does. Quit acting as if this is normal. You don’t have to lie to me.”
And so he does. His voice lowers to a whispered hush as he tells of the Christmas from four years back when Draco first took a turn for the worse, how quickly he deteriorated into his sickness, and what a toll it took on his mother. Despite the reverence of his tone, Xenophilius gesticulates wildly as he speaks, his hair flying about his head in errant wisps, catching the light. Luna’s always thought there was a bit of a mad professor inside her father, and it’s moments like these when he’s truly the centre of attention that those same thoughts arise.
Harry curses as he looks down, the outlines of Hermione and Luna already nothing more than tiny specks frantically waving at him from the blackened landscape below.
Church bells ring out in the distance and Harry looks down at his watch, noting that his train is due in ten minutes. He rubs his thumb over its yellowed face, the inscription of Dudley’s name set into the backing, and smiles. Draco had given the watch back to him only that morning. When Harry had woken, one last time in Draco’s bed, it was to the sight of the watch strapped around his wrist and Draco’s pale hand pressed tightly over the constellation that now resides proudly next to Sirius’ on Harry's chest.
Harry's finding that this holiday is turning out to be more of a necessity than he'd originally thought—between Hermione's demanding political career, Ron's partnership with George, and little Rose starting to talk, Ron and Hermione apparently need to escape the country in order to get a decent night's sleep. As for himself, an indulgent three-week getaway represents a reprieve from the monotony of his life post-war. He views this break as a way to jog himself out of the rut he’s fallen into as of late—or really, for the past two years. He’s never had the inclination to take time-off from work before, but now that he’s here, on a beach with his two best friends and a world of relaxation spread out at his feet, he can’t help but dive in headfirst.
“So greedy,” he says, his hands moving to rest on Draco’s slight hips, fingers digging into perfectly pale skin.
His polite inquiry in regards to finding his way to Inishmore via Portkey is met with uproarious laughter. Not only from the genial-looking man behind the bar, but from several patrons around the small room.
He closes his eyes against the blinding glare of the water and leans in for another swipe of the indulgent hazelnut cream before it’s nothing more than a puddle at his feet. A warm tongue touches his, licking a stripe across his lips and stealing the coolness away from his mouth. Harry stops dead in his tracks, eyes flying open in surprise. The shock of a dusty pink head hides the face of the man lapping at Harry’s melting gelato, tongue trailing downward to lick between Harry’s fingertips.
,” Draco moans, looking over his shoulder to see that shock of wild hair behind him and just a hint of his infamous lightning bolt scar standing out stark and pale against Harry’s forehead. It’s that mark, out of all the beautiful artwork on Harry’s skin—seeing that single jagged line of scarred flesh as Harry works into him that sends Draco soaring over the edge.
“No one blames you. Fleur has written to you a hundred times over saying as much. She misses you, Papa. Bill misses you. I miss you.”
“He said no,” Harry grunts, trying to keep Draco still through yet another seizure. Luna sits at the head of the bed, waving a smudge stick of questionable herbs through the air and doing her best to hum a soothing song for him.
Harry wants to step into that uncharted space that exists outside of lust; he wants to take hold of Draco and keep him. Not to then move him towards the bed as an end goal, but to simply envelop him into his arms and never let go. He wants to feel Draco melt into him, feel his own arms mirror Harry’s as they wrap around him in return, long and lean and full of a magic familiarity that Harry aches to have simmering just under the surface of his own skin.
Draco shoots forward towards the pair, his nerves spiking along with his shoulders as a thunderclap rings out above them. Just beyond he can see a break in the black clouds, a slice of light cutting along the horizon. He wills it ever closer, needing a reprieve from the onslaught.
“Shut. Up,” Potter breathes, forehead pressed against Draco’s own, sweat mingling, hair tangling together. Cameron says something about it blocking their faces, but Draco is too overwhelmed to care.
Draco lights up at the sight of the gift. He looks at Harry one last time, eyes full of promise, before tearing himself away and slipping through the door. Harry lets him go, watching the swinging door swish back and forth over the hexagonal tile of the floor, getting lost in its movement. He’s smiling, feeling giddy at the lingering sensation of Draco’s lips on his skin.
Mipsy is rubbing her gnarled, ancient hands over her waxen forehead, her ears drooped low. She’s mumbling a litany of tasks she’s fallen behind on, her job forever at the forefront of her mind. When she spots Draco, her ears shoot towards the ceiling.
Stepping forward once again, Max tucks his chin over Harry’s shoulder. Harry can see his exaggerated pout out of the corner of his eye, and decides not to torture himself with Max’s blunder. Harry forces himself to relax into Max’s embrace, not wanting to let the moment sour and turn dark. Harry wants this evening to go well. It’s the first time Max has agreed to spend the night. Brooding over the loss of Draco would most definitely interfere with Harry’s plans. He swallows down his pain, closes his eyes and lets his head fall back on Max’s shoulder, pressing his ass into the hard jut of Max’s hips. Harry tries his best to clear his mind of everything except the feeling of a warm body caressing his, and the heady scent of the lamb roasting in the oven mingled with Max’s cologne.
Malfoy throws his head back and laughs. Harry focuses his attention on the painted beams along the ceiling, ignoring the slight. There’s a macrame planter dangling from one beam near the far window, the plant inside its web seems to be pulsing . . . as if it were actually happy to be basked in so much light. Harry envies it, wishing he were back on the Lido with Ron and Hermione, soaking in equal parts Campari and tanning oil.
“I’d never let you fall,” Harry promises and kisses him again, warm and soft and filled with reassurance, before pulling back to watch the wind play havoc with Draco’s hair.
Draco waits again. After a few moment’s silence Hermione says, “He was terrified of losing you again.”
He wishes Draco would speak or even acknowledge him beyond staring at him with those large, glassy eyes that shine like silver and hold his gaze with unnerving attention. He hasn’t seen Draco look this withered and haunted since sixth year, since he witnessed these same eyes looking out at him from a cracked, faded mirror with tears streaked beneath them, and instead of offering to help someone in pain, Harry lashed out.
“I assume the museum guards will eventually realise that an entire room on the fourth floor has been closed off by a tripped curse.”
“No, of course.” Draco turns back to the table and fills another cup with the Oolong Hermione had provided him with not five minutes prior before she’d made a hasty exit to one of the outbuildings that she uses as an office when in residence.
Scorpius’ voice is so cold Draco staggers back with the pain that slices through him. He doubles over at the reminder that she’s gone, the glowing light inside his mind’s eye growing ever dimmer with the passing of days, weeks, months. He squeezes his eyes shut, desperate to keep that flame alive, wondering if it’s Gabrielle holding onto him, or if it’s his own growing madness coming to claim him like so many others of the Black line.
The moment lingers as the waves crash just beyond their cocoon of intimacy. Feeling sluggish and weighted by the heat of the night, Harry struggles to stand from his seat on the chaise, his legs unsteady. Draco’s wings wrap around him, collecting at the small of Harry’s back, helping him up. Draco’s looking down at him, his eyes dark and coaxing. Harry’s drawn in by them, by a magnetism he’s never been able to name.
“Circe, you’re beautiful,” Draco confesses, eyes closing as he nuzzles Harry’s throat, yet still seeing the vast perfection of his body covered in gold and black ink laid out before him in vivid detail in his mind’s eye.
Luna, looking perfectly content ensconced in her favourite chair, simply grins at the chaos over the rim of her teacup.
“No, no. Too soon for ifs,” she says, smiling. “We only have time for certainties.” Her words hang between them, drawing out the moment. Then, “We should also probably look for the elf.”
“So you thought it’d a good idea to let Harry do it for me?” Draco shouts, all sense of propriety leaving him. “He hates me, Hermione! We—” Draco swallows back the words. Hermione doesn’t know, couldn’t know, the true nature of his and Harry’s past. Or, at least, Draco’s side of their past. The long-hidden shame he holds deep inside, the decades of self-hatred over his pathetic cowardice, his cavalier handling of his and Harry’s connection. He’d selfishly traded it for a comfort and a life he never deserved, and now his son has sent him to the very man whose trust he’d broken to help heal him? It was madness.
Nodding, Hermione conjures herself both a strange looking saddle that magically winds its way around the Thestral’s middle and a little step to aid her in mounting the animal.
“It worked?” Harry asks, and Draco nods. “Again?” Another nod. Harry concentrates and feels when the charm takes hold, this time coating the hand Draco has around Harry’s cock in warm, wet oil. “Fuck,” he breathes out, his hips moving of their own accord, unable to stop his shallow thrusts into Draco’s fist.
“I mean the tension in your shoulders. It’s killing me. So out with it. What do you want to know?” Draco sits back and folds his arms, hoping beyond hope that he still appears intimidating to his fully grown son while wearing the most ridiculous dressing gown in existence.
The sun breaks free of a passing cloud. Harry feels its warmth on his face and turns towards it, chasing its heat. The engine thrums underneath him, the skies opening up above like a welcome embrace. He goes eagerly, and with his ascent a memory flashes, clear as day, of him and Draco seeking escape from the sorrows of their youth on this bike, looking for a freedom they’d yet to know.
“Which one? The woman getting fucked, or the man doing the fucking?” He says the harsh words with a reverence and sensuality Harry cannot comprehend as he stands there, drunk on lust and wanting nothing more than for Draco to touch him. He feels the flat wet heat of Draco’s tongue laving at the hair just above the seam of his pants and whimpers at the sensation.
“Fuck. I want him back, Luna.” His voice cracks on the words, filled with anguish. She closes her eyes at the sound, hating the world for taking yet another person from her Harry—for taking Draco from him.
“She’s still breathing,” he whispers, approaching them both. “Where are you staying? We need to get her warm.”
Malfoy had managed to push Harry back into the wall, his thigh moving between Harry’s legs and pressing in hard. He rolled his hips and pulled at Harry’s hair so he could lick a trail down Harry’s neck with a hot tongue. Harry felt his skin pucker into gooseflesh as Mafloy blew cool air over the stripe he’d just painted him with, and he bit back a moan. He needed air. He needed space. He needed to breathe for a second and get his feet back under him. Figure out what the hell was happening to them both.
Harry tries his best to bite back a smile as he takes in Ron’s appearance in his tartan robe and hand-knit socks. His freckled face is flushed and his eyes are tired, yet he’s grinning from ear to ear. Ron sees Harry making a study of him and smacks him on the shoulder. Harry smacks him back, happy for his friend.
They’re in the solarium, and there’s sunshine on Draco’s face, warm and oddly reassuring. He can’t remember the last time he’s taken a meal in this room, but his son knew what he was doing having the table set in here. Draco allows himself an indulgent moment as he bites into the first real food he’s had in days and feels the heat of the summer day radiating through the glass ceiling, warming his skin. He basks in the feeling without letting his grief interrupt. It’s a fleeting moment but all the more precious because of it. He can sense Scoripus across from him, knows he’s smiling at him, and he keeps his eyes shut, too full with emotion to see his son looking at him with kindness he doesn’t deserve.
She asks him, in English, what the tour guide is saying and Harry frowns. The tour guide is speaking English, how does she not understand him?
Hermione shrugs, pulling off her silk scarf and folding it neatly in her lap. “It seems, Scorpius is having a bit of a laugh at your expense.”
“He doesn’t mean to be such a burden.” Harry curses and shakes his head. “You’re not a burden,” he whispers to Draco.
He was dead. Draco was supposed to be dead. Harry’s hard-won friend who had made a home for himself inside Harry’s heart was dead. There’d been a funeral, newspaper articles. Narcissa had written him a letter stained with tears. Harry had visited his grave, apologized to the black stone, cried over the freshly turned earth; cursed the sky and all the world for taking yet another person from him too fucking soon.
Two spots over, Ron huddles under a violently orange Chudley Cannons towel and a peach-striped umbrella, grumbling about the terrors of the midday sun.
Harry’s lying on his side near Draco’s hip, his fingers trailing along the pale hair of Draco’s thighs. “Fine by me.” Amusement clear in his tone.
Harry hears him before he sees him. He knows he’s there, even after all this time Harry can sense Draco’s presence like a phantom touch upon his skin. It’s unsettling to realise Draco can still elicit such a reaction from him, but at least it gives Harry the advantage of knowing when he’s snooping around where he shouldn’t.
He’s halfway down the beach when he hears Potter call out behind him. Draco sighs and walks faster, heading towards a rocky outcropping on an otherwise flat strip of coastline.
“Something on your mind you’d like to talk about, Harry?” Luna offers, magicking the bent and bumped ferns and heather targeted by Harry’s rocks back into their proper states with a swish of her wand.
Draco flicks his head up from his hands, pinning Harry with his preternatural gaze. A suspended moment of understanding seemingly passes between them, and Hermione wonders if what Luna said is actually true: that they can communicate without words.
She reaches for him, but Harry shies from her touch and hides his face from her knowing gaze, removing himself from the situation the only way he knows how. He’s walking out the front door, his feet taking him down the steps and past the front gate of the garden beyond. He speeds up, his shoes slapping against the wet pavement as he goes. He’s running before he knows it, the distant echoes of Hermione’s cries fading into the background as he chases the setting sun down the alleyways of Islington.
The days pass by in a blur of turquoise water and cups of white wine. Hermione drags them to the Doge’s Palace and the Rialto Bridge, out-of-the-way fish markets, a museum named after a woman called Peggy, and a bookstore whose stone floor sits so close to the lapping tide that often there are puddles in the aisles, the ancient bookshelves propped up on stilts. One day, Ron insists that they take a gondola ride together, despite Harry being the third wheel. He snaps pictures of his best friends and sends them back home by owl to Molly, Arthur, and little Rose, reminding her that no, her parents did not abandon her, and that they’ll be back very soon.
” Cameron is saying as he finally takes his leave, pointing at Harry with an eager finger. Harry grins at him, too amused to argue. Instead, he calls over the waiter to order another drink, then laughs with Hermione at the insanity of such a come-on.
He throttles the bike and wandlessly charms it to drive straight and steady before letting go of the bars, grabbing Draco from underneath his arms, and hauling him forward, long legs flailing for a moment before they wrap tightly around Harry’s waist. Harry can feel the tremble in Draco’s thighs and smiles, the spike of fear in Draco’s eyes only adding to the thrill.
Never in his life has Harry seen Luna look indignant, but she does in that moment, with her arms crossed and eyes stern. She holds her head high and stares back at Hermione with a defiance that startles him.
“Both!” Harry cries as Draco breaths hot and wet over the fabric of Harry’s pants. It seeps through the thin material, bathing his straining cock with blessed attention. He immediately needs more and bucks off the railing, chasing Draco’s mouth.
before heading back towards Harry’s, with Hermione and Ron in tow. The two of them had made themselves scarce during the thick of the festivities and Harry suspects they were in a secluded corner also enjoying the intoxicating anonymity of the night.
.” Cecilia waves at him as she magicks the door open and pointedly closes it without offering him to come inside.
Charlie folds his arms across his broad chest and looks to Hermione, a smirk playing at the corner of his lips. He’s enjoying himself entirely too much. A smirking Weasley never led to anything pleasant in Draco’s book.
Draco says without conscious thought. He can never think when Harry is this close, it’s infuriating.
Sitting down hard on the chaise, Harry reaches out to Draco, only to feel him tense under his touch. Draco doesn’t look up. Instead, he drops his blackened hands from his face and threads them together, elbows on his jittering knees.
“He’s been making himself scarce?” Hermione asks, eyebrow raised. Draco nods, too shaken by her previous confession to speak. “I wonder why.”
Harry stumbles backwards, pressing his hand to his cheek. The skin feels whole, unharmed. “What the—”
Movement from across the room draws Draco’s attention. Hermione, the determined bint that she is, has managed to revive the elf from its stupor and Draco, knowing what Mipsy’s presence means, buries his head in the sweet heat of Harry’s neck, hiding behind the fall of his hair.
“No judgement, Harry, but you might want to clean up before Hermione comes out here and sees your manhood.”
“Never stop doing that,” he mumbles, burrowing his head against Harry’s side, one pale leg hitching itself up over Harry’s hip. Draco shifts, his thigh pressing against Harry’s cock, nudging it in a way that makes Harry think Draco isn’t as sleepy as he appears.
Draco huffs a laugh, too exhausted to truly put up a fight. His mother’s pleading voice still echoes in his head. The sound of her blatant desperation is so foreign he doesn’t know what to do with the memory, now forever trapped inside his mind. Even through the darkest days of the war, Draco never heard his mother reach such a level of raw emotion. Malfoys never let their emotions slip. He was raised to keep it all inside, buried and contained, never letting the vulnerability show on his face. He’d never fully comprehended the importance of such resilience until the war, when his mother became the only truth he could follow.
“I’m not your son,” Harry says. “And I don’t believe you.” He holds his head higher as if he could somehow look down on Luna’s father from across the room despite his height disadvantage. “Narcissa would never allow Draco to remain in such pain.”
“Yes,” Harry hisses, pulling Draco’s hair tighter and holding him in place until Draco simply can’t any longer and releases him, gasping for breath. Saliva trails from his lips and Harry runs a thumb over Draco’s swollen mouth. Draco leans into his palm, desperate for such gentle affection. “You’re killing me, Draco,” Harry says, voice reverent with wonder.
“Impossible,” her father breathes. He swallows, tilts his head towards the sky, closes his eyes, and sings out the lullaby.
“Fuck,” Harry gasps, the knowledge that Draco wants him that way hits home like a gut punch for the second time in as many days. The pink-haired man the other night had been Draco, after all, and his confessions compound themselves twofold in the harsh light of day. Draco has wanted him since their youth, and the idea that he’s fantasised over having Harry like this, here, on this bridge, in Draco’s adopted city, so far from their history and their past hatred, has Harry moaning at the intensity of it all, so near the brink his entire body shivers. His hands desperately grip at the iron railing to both keep from pulling at Draco’s hair and to remain standing.
Draco slants his eyes down towards his arm, nostrils flaring. He looks caught, and so utterly guilty that Harry laughs.
Which is why, setting aside her regular acts of brilliance, Harry thinks Hermione’s plan is fucking ridiculous.
Draco hears a grunt of frustration behind him as he attempts to cut Potter off again from saying something that will no doubt send Draco’s world view tipping on its axis, but before Draco can even register the sound of footfalls rushing toward him, he’s slammed back into the flat face of the rock, breath knocked out of him from the force.
Luna squeezes the rubber duckie. It honks in a forlorn sort of way, and Luna doesn’t blame him. She lets it go, watches it float through the bubbles.
The moment doesn’t have a chance to lengthen because just as the tension pulls taut between them Charlie walks into the kitchen with a grin, Teddy at his heels.
Across the expanse of the oddly cheery pink and green-veined tile, he heard an overly dramatic sigh and scowled as his sense of time and place came back to him. Draco Malfoy sat across from him, prim as you please and the very reason why Harry found himself wandless, concussed, and subsequently trapped in a room with no exit.
Charlie hums back at him nonetheless, as if his hesitancy were answer enough. He pushes off the counter and moves closer to Draco, eyes narrowing with mischief or suspicion, Draco’s not sure which.
Tears prickle the corner of Harry’s eyes, and he savours the sting. It lets Harry know that he isn’t dreaming. Draco’s here; alive and real and filled with an electric heat that sparks over Harry’s skin like static shock and sends shivers down his spine. Blinking slow and heavy, Harry takes Draco’s cock once more, watching him as he brings up a hand to work what he can’t naturally fit inside his mouth.
’ behind him, too overwhelmed to take in the use of his given name. He blindly turns down alleyways and side streets, leaping over backway bridges and darts down a staircase towards the water only to look around, see that he’s reached a dead end, and sprints back up the steps for another route of escape.
“Hey, it won’t be that bad,” Potter chides, rocking on the balls of his feet. He looks awkward, boyish and annoyingly handsome. Draco hates him.
I burned for you. Your power, your beauty. I craved it, I wanted to consume you whole, and now, here you stand, practically begging me.”
Lucius, mad with pain, contorting and thrashing on a bed in St. Mungo’s, the wings protruding from his back a hindrance to the healers reluctantly trying to quell his spasms. Draco and Narcissa in the corner, terrified and feeling useless with their grief.
“We need to do this again,” Draco’s saying, head lolling back on Harry’s shoulder, hair tickling his chin. Harry nods, fully in agreement. “Soon.” Harry nods again and kisses Draco’s throat.
“A fire?” Harry repeated. Feeling slow and inappropriately turned-on considering the danger he felt under Malfoy’s fingertips.
Harry shifts, tender from Draco pressing into him only hours prior, his body reminding him of all that he’s leaving behind as the train pushes steadily onward. He puts an ankle over his knee, purposefully adjusting in his seat and thrills at the dull ache, wanting its echo to last, to follow him all the way back to the halls of Grimmauld Place where he’ll lie naked on his bed and think of nothing but the last few days.
“Rude,” she scoffs, but then sobers. “You think, though?” she asks, her body a sudden live-wire, reassessing everything she’s ever known about Harry and Draco post-war.
he thinks, pressing his hips tight to Harry’s backside, staking his claim. Harry’s breath hitches and Draco can smell his arousal release into the air around them.
Harry’s hands ball into fists at his sides. He feels it the moment Draco presses a hand against his own throat, the spot mirroring the bite mark he’d left on Harry so few days ago, claiming him. An unnecessary animalistic instinct on Draco’s part; Harry has always been his.
The warm slick slides down his palm and, not willing to waste it, he grips himself where he’s hard and needy between his legs, careful to fold the long line of his nails over his fist. The heat of his fingers shocks him compared to his cooling spit and he gasps out into the night. The relief at touching himself is short-lived, he needs more. He tosses his head back on a cry, speeding up the rhythm of his hand, seeking a sensation he can’t quite name.
Harry scoffs and then fixes Xenophilius with his narrowed, verdant gaze. Luna sees the matched look of self-righteous anger mirrored on Draco’s face behind him and, despite everything, she smiles at how matched they are at that moment: a perfect tempestuous pair.
Draco squeezes his hand, a small smile playing on his lovely face. “You head in. I’ll keep an eye on Teddy.”
It takes several seconds, maybe even a full minute, but Harry sees the change in Draco as he stands before him. The clouds covering his eyes clear, his expression shifting from sullen to awestruck at Harry’s words, lighting up his face until finally, Draco smiles.
Behind him, he hears a whoo-weee as Teddy shoots forward on his Firebolt, his flaming red hair flying out behind him on the wind, the perpetual streak of inky black glinting in contrast in the bright morning sun.
Across from him, Luna tries her best to suppress a smirk, but doesn’t move to stand. Harry assumes this reaction to be her approval and he sits in a leather Eames chair in the corner, crossing his legs. He takes a sip of his tea, adjusts his seat, and stares at Narcissa, waiting.
Just as they level out above the clouds Harry grins, a thought springing to mind. He grabs Draco’s arm and pulls. Draco squeaks, which only makes Harry smile more.
Luna sees Draco tuck himself away behind Harry at that statement, and her heart breaks for his once proud vanity, now so tarnished and quelled. To Luna, Draco would always be as he once was, devastatingly sharp and posh and porcelain-fine. She only hoped he could come to realise the same one day.
Their descent is gradual but feels immediate after so long afloat in the wicked chill of the thin air above the clouds. Draco can sense the change in climate and temperature, the spike of humidity as they dip closer to the waves, the heightened smell of salt and earth. It alights his keen senses with a prickle of the unknown and to Draco’s utter surprise, he’s eager to see more. He’s excited.
Harry smiles as Draco plucks the box out of his hands and holds it to his chest, long fingers curling around the edges like talons sinking into a fresh kill.
“And that’s what matters,” Hermione adds, leaning up on tiptoe to kiss him. Ron winks at her and pats her on the bum as she heads out of the room to get ready for bed. It doesn’t escape Harry’s notice that Ron watches her go, eyes fixed firmly on her backside with a hunger Harry prefers not to see on his best friend’s face in regards to any part of his other best friend’s person.
“Really.” Harry lifts his head to look down at Draco’s pale hair, the sharp line of his cheekbone, the startlingly beautiful sight of his cream-coloured complexion highlighted against his own darker skin.
of it certainly is. Harry holds Draco close, licks into him with his tongue and wonders how this version of their obsession with each other came to pass; has the inclination to take this path with Draco always been there, or is the time they’ve had to grow out of their idiot teenage selves the key ingredient that’s caused this delicious reaction?
“Wait,” Harry said, all too soon for Draco’s liking because he whined when Harry pulled back. “How do we get out of here?”
Which, as it turns out, is entirely the wrong thing to do. Draco turns from him and flees down the hall, just as Cecilia reenters with a silver tray floating aloft in front of her.
Grinning at how quickly she’d managed that, Luna springs to her knees, placing them on either side of Hermione’s hips and ducks down to place a kiss to her nose. “That’s one.”
Draco slaps him, full-handed across the face. Potter’s head goes cracking to the side, his sunglasses flying off as his head whips. To Draco’s horror, as opposed to pushing him back, fighting him with words or hexes, Potter snorts out a chuckle, his hand coming up to touch the red handprint Draco left behind. He looks delighted. Draco sits down, disturbed by how quickly he’d lost control of his temper. He dares to look up, pulse quickening at the sight of Potter’s pink tongue teasing at his top lip wet with blood.
“You’re a fucking tease,” Harry tells him, only to be met with a soft laugh; a puff of amusement against his lips. Harry chases it, kissing Draco silent once more.
Draco lifts a shoulder. “Why not?” He’s aiming for indifferent but Harry can tell it’s all a front. Draco had chased
It takes another second for Draco to come to the conclusion that this man must be Bill’s elusive younger brother, Charlie. He’s shared meals at Bill and Fleur’s table for twenty years now and yet he’s never met this particular member of Bill’s massive family, no doubt due in part to his constant travelling.
“I know.” He holds back so he can wrap an arm around Luna’s shoulder, pulling her close. “I’m sorry.”
“Right.” Ron plops down with the bag of chips. He pulls out one of Molly’s silver serving platters from his oversized Chesterfield coat, shines it with the edge of his sleeve, then dumps the chips out onto it with a flourish.
pauses to grab a bottle of Limoncello off the sideboard just inside the door. He pops the top and takes a swig. It burns but coats his tongue in its cloying sweetness, distracting him.
“Your godfather is a Slytherin at heart, you know,” Draco tells Teddy, gripping his broom handle with too much force.
To Draco’s astonishment, Hermione actually looks guilty at Charlie’s words. He raises an eyebrow at this turn of events, intrigued.
Draco gasps, the chill of the air around him no doubt a shock to his system, but Harry can’t look away as Draco arches once again, shoulders pressing into the handlebars, long fingers digging into Harry’s thighs, head thrown back over the curve of the headlamp, throat exposed and skin rippling with goosebumps at the bite of the wind. His cock is hard and wet, flushed pink and laying flat against the line of his belly. Harry groans, his hands running up and down Draco’s sides, needy beyond words.
“There’s no way. This should be burnt to a crisp,” Max says in awe, helping himself to a second serving.
“I . . . I know,” Draco says, the admission closing up his throat with emotion. He looks up, sees the tears in Scorpius’ eyes and wants to reach out to console him, missing him terribly. “I’m sorry.”
Infinite thanks to Lediona25 and MyMindsMadness for their beta prowess. This would be a hot mess without them.
Awkwardly, Hermione waves, sending him a strained little smile. Draco huffs in response and in a single fluid motion stands from his crouched position to his full height, wings spreading in an impressive display. Hermione scrambles to stand, watching the wind whip Draco’s hair over his shoulders, the sun painting his pale features in pinks and golds and the scar on his face standing out in sharp relief. He’s beautiful and terrifying, and Hermione’s chest feels too tight at the thought that this creature ‘claimed’ her Harry. Luna had said so. That bite on Harry’s neck marks him as something the creature inside Draco considers his own. Yet Hermione had gone and declared in front of them both that there was someone else in Harry’s life.
“I’m actually not sure, he—” Harry cuts his explanation short when he turns to see Draco standing at the top of the staircase. His windblown hair falls across his forehead, his chest heaving and nostrils flared. Long, inky fingers grip the bannister so tightly Harry hears the wood creak.
Draco grins, and springs up from his folding chair, marching through the bramble with his head held high towards the garden shed of Grimmauld Place. Harry quickly follows, eager to fly once more on the beast of a bike Sirius had left him. Fixing it up had been such a solace to Harry the year following the war, when Harry had felt so lost he could sometimes barely breathe. The bike was his reprieve from the monotony of the day to day. Being able to share his evening rides with Draco in the months since he’d begun staying at Grimmauld Place was the true icing on the cake to Sirius’ incredible gift.
I’m a fierce non-believer when it comes to coincidence, but I daresay you two were meant to cross paths again.
Draco looks at him, holding Harry with his stern grey gaze as Harry comes to lean next to him on the railing. “I like it,” Harry repeats.
Harry wants to groan. The man is impossible. He looks to the ceiling, staring at the painted beams, desperate for patience. “You know I do, Draco.”
Harry grunts in his grip and it sounds like pain. In an instant, Draco releases the firm hold he’d unintentionally had on Harry’s hips and apologizes into the knot of hair tied at the back of Harry’s neck.
Draco’s wings are held wide, despite Hermione and Luna having freed themselves from under them, and his body is tense as a spring about to snap over Harry. Hermione looks down at him, brows furrowing with worry. Harry shrugs back at her, seemingly at a loss. He brings an arm up to stroke at one of Draco’s wings, but all that does is cause his feathers to spike and his shoulders to hitch higher, his arms wrapping tighter about Harry.
“No,” Xenophilius tells Luna, taking a step back. “Don’t worry, I understand. He’s . . . he’s formed an attachment with Harry, has he not?” This question is directed at Hermione, who nods, tight-lipped, her shoulders tense as she shifts her focus from the elf to others around her.
He rounds the corner into the kitchen just in time to see Luna throwing a box of ginger mints and a smudge stick of sage into her satchel. Her clothes are dust-covered and sweat-stained, and there’s an angry scrape across her cheek. Harry rushes forward, alarmed at her appearance.
Hermione becomes acutely aware of a low rumbling. She darts her eyes around, looking for the source, worried Harry’s unchecked magic has truly taken a turn, when she spots a flash of dusky feathers and blond hair in her peripheral vision heading directly for Harry. She moves to stand, but Xenophilius is throwing an arm out in front of her and pulling her behind his billowing robes as he draws his wand.
Draco’s hand finds Harry’s hair and pulls. Harry lets his head be guided backward, allowing Draco to stare down at him.
Draco’s shoulders spike, his eyes fierce and brimming with tears. Harry continues to stroke his feathers, feeling useless.
“Every week,” he repeats her words. She doesn’t know if he’s placating her but she accepts the consolation at its face value, needing to believe him, even if it’s a lie.
Waking to the sounds of pigeons cooing gently outside is new; normally the windows are closed at Harry’s flat, the tiny air-con whirring at full blast. Harry blinks, staring out at a room that isn’t his and feeling a warm body next to his on the bed. Draco, sleep-soft and snoring gently, is lying next to him, one pale arm draped over his head, pink hair tumbling across the pillow. Harry moves a hand to comb it, loving the feel of it slipping through his fingers. Draco shivers at the attention and unconsciously snuggles closer to Harry’s side. Harry smiles, kissing his shoulder before turning to lie back and stare up at the beamed ceiling, fondly replaying last night’s activities in his mind. His magic is simmering just under the surface of his skin, his entire body tingling with the feeling.
Draco nods, head bowing low, tucking his chin. Narcissa slips into the open space between Draco’s curled wings to hold him close. They were not always such a tactile family, but Narcissa’s need to feel her son, solid and whole, outweighs the stilted strictness archaic pureblood parenting dictates. She can feel his hesitation, the hovering of his hands just above her back, but then, warmth surrounds her as he gives in and embraces her. They stand together as one. It’s as if a part of her soul—once ripped so completely from her—has been returned. It’s only once she pulls away to see the wetness on her son’s cheeks, does Narcissa realise that the warmth she felt against her hair was from Draco’s tears.
Harry does. This time, the Veela melts further into a relaxed state, his inky black, taloned hands falling from his face and his shoulders slumping into a boneless posture as if teetering on the edge of sleep. He’s on the floor, leaning heavily against the wall with one shoulder, the wings protruding from his back in a position that looks incredibly uncomfortable to Harry. But the stomach-churning ache has lessened, which can only be a good thing.
Harry slides a bite of tender meat off his fork, dragging his teeth harshly along the tines. “You’re right. It should be burnt.”
Harry doesn’t acknowledge them as they step out of the room. The last Hermione sees before shutting the door are Harry’s eyes, steadfast and fixated, as always, on Draco.
It’s at this point that Draco very much wants to stomp his foot and demand his son explain himself. What the hell kind of game was Scorpius playing at?
, Malfoy,” Harry calls, just as Draco is slipping away. He halts and looks back over his shoulder. Potter is holding eye contact with him, face unreadable. It’s infuriating.
Chi disprezza compra - a saying that means 'one who hates, loves in reality' . . . and isn't that just Drarry in a nutshell?
“Oh, great.” Harry brings the canvas totes over to the table. They thunk down softly with the promise of potatoes and squash and a glass jar or two hidden inside. Luna hopes one of them is marmalade. “Want help?”
There must be a typhoon heading towards the house on a roaring tide. That can be the only explanation for the sound of rushing water in Draco’s ears. He’ll turn around and see the cascade of water pushing in through the back door any moment now.
They burst through the swinging door of the gents, laughing as they stumble into each other. Draco shoves Harry against the tile wall, his smile looking a little wild. His hair tumbles over his forehead, glinting silver in the low light, and Harry likes that it's no longer perfect. Placing his hands on either side of Harry’s head, Draco grins down at him, eyebrow raising in question. Harry answers by arching his back off the cold tile, bringing his hips into contact with Draco’s, feeling bold and reckless and so turned-on he’s afraid he’ll combust.
This outburst is met with fire burning in Harry’s eyes at Draco’s implication, the aura around him seething green and fearful. Breathing heavily, Harry jabs his wand in Draco's direction, sparks shooting out the end as he speaks.
Draco holds her tighter on instinct. “So much so that I’m terrified of waking up and discovering this was all a dream.”
Harry wants nothing more than to give in to this new, shimmering emotion he’s feeling and join Draco on that jungle bed, sit beside him, pet his hair and kiss him, but that’s not a reality for them. Not yet. Whatever had got its claws into Draco that day at the beach had yanked and yanked hard, pulling him far away from Harry, farther than when he’d first stepped into Cameron’s kitchen on Tuesday, just past two in the afternoon, and spotted Draco Malfoy for the first time in six long years. Draco slinks across the sun-drenched floorboards, purposefully putting space between them, proving Harry’s theory all the more; there’s too much left unsaid, too much water under the bridge. They’ll need time to continue this strangely exciting exercise in patience they’re curating around one another, and unfortunately for Harry, there isn’t much time left.
“There is no need, Draco.” Narcissa lets go of Harry to put a hand to Draco’s cheek, mirroring his pose. His skin feels warm and alive beneath her palm. “Take your potion. For me.”
Undeterred by the frosty reception, Harry barrels on. “Dropping off these.” He holds out the pastries he’d picked up on his way, hoping that one of them would appeal to Draco’s discerning tastes.
Draco opens his eyes at that, holding Harry with his intense grey gaze, no less intimidating for being red-rimmed and bloodshot. “And whose fault is that?”
“Harry, you have to let me look,” Hermione says, and Harry removes his hand from his bloodied neck. She hisses at the sight of it and Harry winces, figuring what it must look like.
“You can, and you must. You must understand.” She steps closer still, taking his arm while reaching out with the other towards Draco. Tethered together, they create a disjointed circle: mother, son, and Saviour.
driver heavily and apologizes for his friend in rusty Italian. The man tilts his sunglasses to wink at Harry before revving his engine and whistling as he departs. The notes ricochet off the walls around them, sending the pigeon fleeing in agitation as the chugging of the boat engine provides a bass counterpoint to the soprano of the man’s tune.
He turns and leaps off the balcony, his wings taking him higher and higher into the howling winds of the fast-approaching storm. He hears Harry calling out his name from below but he ignores him and pushes south, away from the electrical bolts touching down along the water and igniting the land beneath him. He chases the clear sky ahead of him, his mind going numb to the memory of his pain, even if his body shakes with the aftershocks of his self-inflicted trauma.
Hermione shoves Harry hard, away from the creature, scolding him while simultaneously searching him for injury. Luna ensures that none of them can be harmed in this place, but Harry can only focus on the Veela in the corner and the pain emanating from him. On instinct, Harry presses his hand to his belly, feeling an echo of those emotions reverberating inside him.
Scorpius enters the room, and approaches the fire, long legs folding as he seats himself on the hearth rug, his expression of concern still in place.
Shaking his head, Harry swallows, hips canting in a sinuous roll. “No, inside me. The magic ripples through me when the markings change.”
Ron slaps his brother on the back in greeting before pulling him into a hug. Hermione smiles, “Thank you, Charlie.”
Looking down, Harry sees a wicked grin cross Draco’s scarred, roguish face and Harry knows he’s done for the next second when Draco slowly slides his lips down over Harry’s length.
Draco halts at the sound of his mother crying his name, his hands on the doorknobs, his back heaving with struggling breaths. His wings are full, puffed out in agitation and his head is bowed.
help. He bit his lip and watched the buttons of Malfoy’s waistcoat strain against his gasping breaths and the fall of his pale hair over the sharp line of his cheekbone as he turned his head back and forth against the plaster wall in discomfort. Harry ran a hand through his own hair in frustration.
Draco, as ever, nods and continues to ignore Harry’s request except when it suits him to do otherwise.
Harry clears his throat. “I think that's really my decision to make, Draco.” He watches Draco flinch at the use of his given name and smiles. Throwing Draco Malfoy off his game has never once gotten old in the thirteen years he’s known him.
Hermione clears her throat and begins speaking as if she’s reciting from a brochure. “Thestrals are long lauded for their comforting and therapeutic natures. Even being close to one can imbue a sense of calm—”
Obliging, Cecilia bends down and nips his bare shoulder. Draco yips and covers himself like a startled virgin on his wedding night. “You fiend!”
Shaking his head, Harry squeezes Luna tight to his side. She hopes her closeness is giving him the strength to admit the things he needs to share, though she’ll never be the one to push.
were doing,” Harry sighs, both hands now coming to collect Draco’s hair into a loop around one fist. Draco’s eyes close at the implication, the heavy weight of Draco’s cock hardening against the soft skin of his inner thigh; he loves having his hair played with and pulled. As if reading Draco’s mind Harry gives an experimental tug, sending a shiver down Draco’s spine. He whimpers and nuzzles lower towards the thick, dark head of Harry’s erection, the tip a glistening tease peeking out of its foreskin.
She turns to leave, but then Draco is there, an inky hand on her shoulder, holding her in place. Narcissa is bent in on herself like the curl of a parenthesis lingering at the end of a sentence without proper purpose, while Draco is as prickled as an exclamation point at her side, his wings adding emphasis to their visual grammar.
Random side note: I did an illustration of Harry with his celestial markings for this story (he'll be in the next chapter) and I purposefully included a rendering of the stag on Harry's chest. The stag is not supposed to be fully illustrated, it's just supposed to show the stars, hence Harry not realising it's a representation of his father. . . HOWEVER, I wanted to draw the stag, so I did.
The bored wizard heaves a put-upon sigh, having no response for Harry’s bizarre behaviour other than to stamp his papers and hand over a rubber banana with a bemused expression on his gaunt face. He points to the clock behind him. “
Harry, who hasn’t heard Luna raise her voice for any reason in close to a decade, jolts from his relaxed position on the couch and promptly trips and falls headlong over the coffee table.
“I’ve always liked that one.” Harry raises his head off the pillow, straining to look down at where Draco’s lavishing his attention. “They’re androgynous.”
Ignoring her, Harry crouches down. He wants to get a look at this man, to show him that they mean to help him, and he can only do that if he can see the man’s face. There’s something there, something covering his skin. It shines in the torchlight and Harry ducks his head closer, reaching out with curious fingers to push the man’s hair back over his shoulder.
Then, to Harry’s astonishment, the man jumped, popping himself into the painting. He waved at Harry before wrapping up the subject of the painting, an aging lord dozing on a velvet pouf, in his arms and dashing off behind a tapestry with the man, their chortles of hearty laughter floating behind them on a non-existent breeze.
Draco glares at her. “I will end you,” he hisses before sucking on the straw of her cocktail with a vengeance.
Behind him, Harry realises that he’s hearing Cecilia giggling to herself. He turns, looking at her with questioning eyes. She nods at him, popping a pilfered
Draco lunges to strike Harry but Harry’s quicker and he grabs his hand before Draco can do any damage. They wrestle in the hot water, steam and magic surging all around them as Harry attempts to gain control. He succeeds by pinning one arm behind Draco’s back, wrenching back his shoulder and forcing their bodies together, trapping Draco’s other arm against Harry’s chest. Heaving, Draco stares down at Harry, eyes dark, red-rimmed and brimming with tears.
Harry tells him, and Draco lovingly runs his nose along the protruding tendon leading from Harry’s throat to his shoulder.
“When?” He demanded as he stretched his fingers out wide, feeling no pain. The singed, ashen quality of his skin had healed, the blue glow of his wand hand had somehow winked itself out, leaving nothing but the dark caramel colour of Harry’s skin in its stead.
“That’s a long time to go without speakin’,” Charlie mentions, leaning over Harry, his ponytail falling into Harry’s face as he hovers to read.
Draco ignores the looks all around him and stands, holding the gangly, awkward creature in his weakened grip, back aching at the unexpected weight, his right leg in danger of giving out beneath him. He refuses to appear weak in front of the men who were about to let the poor beast in his arms drown and storms off towards the stables, head held as high as he can muster as pain rockets through his body every other step.
!” Draco curses. The elastic of Harry’s pants snaps back into place with a painful sting. Harry slumps forward, groaning. “Sorry,” Draco says, standing and quickly pulling Harry’s jeans back together.
“What are you doing?” Harry asks, staring hard at where Draco’s got his hand wrapped tight around Harry’s wrist, the tendons beneath straining.
Harry throws back the rest of his tea in one swallow, slams the cup down onto the table with a resounding thunk, his eyes never leaving Draco’s. “Yup,” he says, and pushes himself to stand despite having just sat down.
The ruins are hidden from Muggle view, but the magic that lingers within supposedly keeps the climate at a perfect temperature year-round, ensuring that the surrounding animals and flora never fall ill or meet an untimely end. The wild theories Luna spun of the soil holding magical properties that could perhaps help heal were the only reason Hermione agreed to visit in the first place.
“No, before that,” Scorpius interrupts. “Before school. When you and Mr Potter were young and Teddy was still a kid. He remembers you.”
“Hmm?” Harry had been looking off out the kitchen window, his mind elsewhere while his magic and his moods swirled around Draco like a tidepool of intoxicating colour.
He asks, swaying towards him. Harry leans away and Draco dips, resting his forehead on Harry's shoulder instead.
Hermione claps her hands together as if calling a meeting to order. “Great. Well, Harry and Luna will be off then.” She collects their satchel and places Luna’s safari hat atop her head over her bun, adjusting it to a jaunty angle. Luna looks up at her from under the brim.
The gift Harry bought Draco hangs heavy in his pocket and just before Draco slips back through the loo door, Harry grabs hold of his arm. Draco smiles and quirks an eyebrow.
A moment passes, then two, three. . . they stand there, breathing each other in, suspended on a precipice.
“Fuck!” he says again, wiping his eyes. Luna quietly casts a Scourgify and Harry feels the dust disappear from his face. He grins at her in thanks.
“Harry, oh, fucking . . .  yes!” He drops his head, whimpering into the pillow as Harry milks him, his thumb rubbing just under the base of Draco’s cock as Draco pulses in his grip. All the while, Harry is still inside him, pressing deep as Draco convulses around his tongue, his whole body shuddering with the force of his release.
Draco takes a step forward and sees the flash of pure animalistic fire awaken in Scorpius’ eyes at the movement. Draco immediately recoils, contorting in on himself and scratching at his own face, instead, turning from his son. He moves away, ripping a hand through his tangled hair, ashamed.
“He is,” Potter agrees, sitting down next to Draco and sending him a casual smile that wreaks havoc on Draco’s nerves.
Harry scoffs and bites out, “Merlin, Draco, do you have to make everything—” he stops himself, forces down his emotions with a swig of whiskey from a flask he’s left perched on the side of the stone basin and tries again.
“I can’t, in good conscience, allow him to seize like this. It could cause lasting damage. He needs more help.”
Draco looks to Harry then, his eyes a severe crease of anger. “Why so defensive, Potter? Is it because I’m the only one man enough to tell you what a selfish coward you’ve been all these years?”
“No. We didn’t know anyone else was here when we found him. We’re afraid she was caught in the collapse.”
It only takes a second, but as soon as Harry is within arms reach, Draco lunges. He grabs hold of Harry’s arm and pulls him in, tucking Harry’s head just under his chin as his wings spread out wide and full at his back.
Hermione smacks Ron in the arm, a sewing needle shot through with gold thread clenched in her teeth. “
an ill-fitting tribute to his late godfather. Harry, too world-weary to care at seventeen, simply let that narrative play out. Until now, it seems. He doesn’t like Malfoy thinking they’re simply
They’d been warned so many times over, of the madness that could overtake the Malfoy line, of the genes that could taint their so-called ‘pure blood’ and drive them to ruin. Narcissa had once loved the idea of her breathtakingly beautiful husband having Veela heritage. She’d romanticised the idea of him being more than just her partner in life but her destined mate, a true match of love, not just a betrothal amongst patriarchs of two long-established wizarding families. Her love for him always felt like an act of rebellion against her own father. The pride she once held for how intensely she loved Lucius felt like she was spitting in the face of pureblood traditions, rather than bowing to them.
Slamming the door behind him, it takes a second for Harry to realise that he’s barged in on Draco, who’s curled up into as tight a ball as he can manage in the empty bathtub. His wings cascade out over the sides, too large to fit.
Draco raised a thin, blond eyebrow at him. Harry ignored him and moved on to the next piece, which consisted of a man standing on a balcony with his back to the viewer. There was a red velvet chair in the bottom right corner which Harry thought looked rather comfortable. He smirked at the subject’s oddly tufted hair, commiserating with the man over mutual cowlicks.
Harry kicks yet another rock, sending it skidding down the mountainside, crashing into the local flora and fauna below. Luna sighs, feeling worn out.
Scorpius interrupts him again before Draco can even attempt to explain. “Teddy told me that you two were together.”
Harry puts a hand to Hermione’s shoulder, stilling her. “He’s apologising to her,” he says, watching them, listening. Hermione sits on her heels, eyes darting back and forth between Harry and the feral Veela that holds the love of her life in his terrifying claws.
“Of course he—That’s not what I’m saying!” Scorpius snaps, removing his arm from Draco’s grasp. He pushes back from the table and runs his shaking hands through his overlong hair, the strands just a shade darker than Draco’s own. Draco watches as he walks to the drinks cart and grabs a bottle before returning to the table and taking a swig directly from it without the slightest hesitation.
Hermione stills behind her. The air suddenly feels uncompromisingly heavy in a room already filled with the humidity of the bathwater and the burning incense of Luna’s choosing.
Harry tries to tell himself that these are just natural reactions to have when an attractive man willingly presses close to him. He tries to tell himself that discovering Draco alive after all these years has compounded with his long-held feelings for the man, and now everything has jumbled itself into one big fever dream of a cluster fuck, and that’s why he so badly wants to shove Draco up onto the sink and suck his cock down his throat in one swallow.
“There was a house elf that tended to him. Brought him food,” Harry tells them. “Shit, really?” He sits back, then turns to Hermione, eyes wide. “Do you think—”
Harry turns on the spot and Apparates away from them all, forcing his magic into the very fabric of the rock on which he stands to bend to its will and project him far beyond this place, splinching be damned. Eyes squeezed shut and belly pulled taut with the sharp yank of a hook, he feels himself soaring and only opens his eyes again when he’s landed on solid, craggy ground once more. He looks around himself, seeing the cliffs he knows well and the endless cascade of grass behind him, The Sanctuary a mere dot on the horizon. He’s lying to himself but somewhere deep down he swears he can see the flash of a white-blond head, shining in the rare midday sunshine.
Luna shrugs in response to Hermione’s eager question, and Hermione slumps again, though her mind won’t settle anytime soon with this new theory.
Laughing, Hermione rubs at her eyes. She looks as tired as she no doubt feels, and Luna wants nothing more than to take her to bed and make sure she relaxes herself into a good night’s sleep.
He pops the mint into his mouth, rubbing his tongue against it hard, hoping its flavour will soothe his nausea.
“You’re not a god, Draco. You can’t control death. People die of sickness every day, it’s no one’s fault.”
“Shit, shit, shit,” Draco continues repeating as he thrashes through the air with his wand, sending the door flying open before them as they dash inside, the footfalls of the police officers increasing their pace behind them.
Her father stares blankly at her for several moments before his face creases with an abrupt sadness. He steps close, whispering to her in a desperate voice. “Luna, dear. We had no choice.”
Just then, the fire behind them roars to life in a shock of green flames, the Healer stepping through, potion satchel in hand.
Harry shrugs, his hands running over the neat row of records. He plucks one out at random and smiles at the cover:
He rubs at his eyes, the heavy blanket of sleep taking its hold on him, despite needing to keep watch over Draco. He stumbles back, his knees coming into contact with something behind him, and bends, landing heavily on the chaise lounge, melting into the cushions. He tries to keep Draco in his line of sight but he’s suddenly overcome with exhaustion and, without warning, his lids fall shut. The roar of the wind and the crash of the sea below all fades to black.
Draco often wondered what had become of Harry after he’d left England. He’d known, in some way, it had something to do with him, but was too scared to pursue the true reason and too much of a fool not to. All he’d ever heard in the years since was that the great Harry Potter, Saviour of the Wizarding World had retired to Ireland to live a quiet life on land left to him by his godfather. The side of Draco that had grown terrified of confrontation after hearing the news, found a terrible, painful solace in the knowledge that he’d never have to see his commanding presence in Diagon Alley, or spy him tableside at a Delacour-Weasley gathering in France, again.
“He’s not miserable, ‘Mione,” Ron calls from inside the sitting room where he’s knitting a pair of orange socks and listening to a Cannons game on the wireless.
“My love,” Xenophilius says, coming to his knees before her. “You’ve been crying.” He brushes a thumb over her cheek.
With one arm braced tightly across Draco’s back, Harry takes his other hand and guides his cock to where he wants it most, feeling the resistant pressure, then the slow release and slide as Draco allows himself to sink down onto Harry. Draco calls out, an unnatural, inhuman cry as he throws his head back, neck tensing with the strain. He’s glorious and terrifying and perfect at that moment, and Harry drinks in the sight, feeling the engine thrumming under him and Draco hot all around him. He’s a live wire set to ignite.
Lightning forks across the sky over him and he breathes out at the shock of it, as if its charge had somehow electrified his blood from within. He falls forward on one taloned-hand, panting into the dirt, the need inside him building with every desperate drag of his palm over his aching prick. There, just underneath him, is the ripe scent of blood he sought earlier. He looks down at it, grinning with all his teeth as he watches a pearlescent drop of liquid release from the tip of his swollen cockhead, landing on the reddened earth. The combination sizzles, releasing a plume of silken smoke that he eagerly inhales.
That one stings. Harry grimaces and brings a hand up to Draco’s hair, soothing out a tangle. Draco, despite himself, leans into his touch.
At Harry’s words, Hermione’s eyes fill with tears. She hurls herself at him as he stands to go, with Ron coming up behind her and engulfing all three of them in his long, strong arms. They remain that way, wrapped up together for almost a full minute, breathing in each other’s joyous memories of a holiday well spent and a reluctance to see it end as the precious time they have left comes to a close. It’s so rare for it to be just the three of them nowadays.
The sun has long descended behind the cliffs when Harry slips into the steaming pool of water out back behind the kitchen garden. He sighs out into the cool night air, feeling the ache in his bones leaching out into the hot water, along with the pressures of the day. He takes a moment to run his hand over the smoothed rock, remembering the weeks it took for him and Charlie to magically carve out the bowl of the pool, then conduct the water to always radiate at an even 38 degrees. He’d only been living on the island for a year but the indulgence felt necessary at the time.
Harry spares Narcissa a glance, his eyes falling to the parted fabric on her right arm, and then to Draco before returning once more to what Narcissa has revealed. Under her perfectly tailored robes lies a secret that she’s kept hidden these past four years.
Draco looks up, mouth forming the question just as Scorpius answers it for him. “Mr Potter. Why’d you leave him?”
“Quit scowling, or I’ll crop you out of the picture,” Cameron chides, raising an eyebrow in Draco’s direction.
He hears a whinny on the breeze and sees several shapes maring the distance with their movement. The Thestrals are grazing at the sparse grass, their sharp heads nudging at the ground. Draco goes to them, compelled.
Somehow Teddy has shown up without Draco noticing, because he’s rubbing a soothing circle into Draco’s back, a look of worry on his kind face.
It’s at this moment that Harry decides to grace them with his presence, all wind-swept and dragonhide clad, his hair a riot of salt and pepper curls atop his head, loose strands running amok from the tie holding it. His gaze is fierce as he glares at each of them in turn.
Rocking on his heels, Harry feels shy all of a sudden. Cecilia steps closer still, holding his face with her long fingers tipped with red polish.  “You think he hates you?”
“Malfoy,” Potter says, plopping down next to him as they bounce along the current towards their destination.
“Hold fast,” Hermione says as she clucks her tongue, leading the Thestral to the edge of the wooden dock beneath them before the large wings of the creature unfurl and in a single, rushing swoop leaps into flight over the rippling water of the bay. Draco watches from his mount, stunned at the sight she makes silhouetted in the sky with a golden hue echoing around her, and then, with an excess of courage he never thought he possessed, follows.
A heaviness settles on her shoulders when Draco turns towards her; his scarred face is as haunted as ever, though blessedly free of the terrible mask. She crouches before him, combing her hand through his beautiful hair, only a shade lighter than her own.
Hermione allows herself several long deep breaths in order to not send a stinging jinx Harry’s way. After the day she’s had, she’s closer to throttling him than she’d like. They had brought him here to help, not to fly off the handle and break the ancient wards with his uncontrolled magic. Hermione keeps telling him to practice meditation to help with his moods but does Harry listen? No, of course, he doesn’t.
Draco answers after Harry’s third round of knocking. He’s barefoot, draped in a silk robe that’s falling haphazardly off one shoulder, and his silver-blond hair is tied-up into a pile of tangles on his head. He must have run down the stairs to get the door, leaving him panting and flushed pink. Harry has never seen Draco Malloy in such an indisposed state and he blatantly stares for a moment before catching hold of his senses.
Cameron pouts at him. “You normally love to indulge my flights of fancy, Dee.” He steps in close and runs a hand through Draco’s hair. Draco practically purrs at the attention and hates himself at the same time for giving into such blatant coercion. Yet a few more drags of Cameron’s hands through his hair have Draco’s eyes closing in momentary bliss and his head nodding in distracted agreement.
“What? He?” Hermione whips her head around, only to see that Luna has lowered her wand and is standing still, eyes closed.
Much to his dismay, she follows him into the bathroom. He lifts the toilet seat, sense of propriety be damned, and pisses.
Harry nods, eager and beyond hungry. He wants like he’s never wanted before. He feels touch-starved and thirsty for a sip of water he can’t reach.
“Plans, Potter?” Draco quips. Harry turns back to see that Draco has also allowed the music to sweep him off into his own musings. He’s lounged on his elbows on the bed, throat exposed as he lets his head roll back on his shoulders, one slim ankle twisting in time with the tune. Harry wants to clarify, to ask Draco what prior arrangements are so important they’ll keep Harry from coming back here to spend more time in this room with its greenery and sunlight and Muggle music and the most captivating man Harry has ever dared to want, but his voice sticks in his throat, the sight of Draco rendering him speechless.
Hermione tuts and crosses her legs, sending the slit higher up her thighs. Luna sighs at the sight, but stays put.
“Of course, more Weasleys,” he mumbles as he moves forward, his Thestral steed keeping step just beside him.
“I can see it,” Harry pants, blinking against the light now consuming him. Gone is the pinprick on the horizon of his mind’s eye, now there seems to be an entire sun coalescing in the confined space of their bedroom, hanging in a liquid gold orb above them, urging them forward, faster, harder.
“He kidnapped you,” Hermione whispers into his ear. “I managed to cast a tracking charm on you before he got too far.” She pulls back, looking him over. “Are you okay?”
Harry blinks at him, coming to the sudden realisation that he owes this man nothing. He doesn’t need to be here, listening to this priest, standing in this church, and wallowing over something he can’t control. He’s a free person, he can do whatever he fucking wants.
A little too soon, Harry thinks, noting the date on the calendar in the kitchen on their second Saturday in Venice.
“Shit! I’m sorry,” Harry says, waving a Reparo through the air with his hand and syphoning off the spilt tea with a conjured rag. “Sorry. Fuck.”
“Your face,” Draco gasps, not bothering to explain further. “Pull my hair,” he directs before running his teeth along Harry’s neck, sucking a mark into his skin. It blooms red and angry over a small cluster of stars depicting a bow and arrow. He licks them, wanting to taste them on his tongue.
“Dee, be a doll and grab some more ice?” Cameron is saying as he attempts impressive stunts with a cocktail shaker. Harry is momentarily distracted, but then the
It takes him several minutes to realise what he’s hearing, but when he does he bends at the waist, a sick feeling rocketing through him.
She tosses her head back in frustration. “None of this is normal, Harry. We need to go to St. Mungo’s!”
Exasperated, Draco stands and walks over to Harry, slapping his hand away from the affectionate leaves. “Stop that.”
, called there by his curiosity and his own latent tendencies to constantly know where and what Draco Malfoy is up to. He assumes Malfoy is lounging on that ridiculous red-lipped couch draped in silk and being hand fed grapes by Cameron or something equally extravagant and bourgeoisie. Discovering such debauchery will be a satisfying sight as soon as Harry summons up the stones to actually knock.
Hermione watches as Harry sits down hard on the ground at Draco’s feet, all the fight leaving him in an instant. She sees Draco peering up at him, broken and small and horribly scarred. Clasping a hand over her mouth, she holds in a sob at the sight of him, reconciling the posh, prim, and pristine man she once knew with the one she sees before her now.
Draco looks back over his shoulder, his preternatural silver gaze latching on to hers, and she knows, without question, that he can sense her disquiet.
“It worked,” Hermione repeats, astonished. She didn’t think it would work. She had been indulging Luna, as she always did, she didn’t actually fathom that “the ruins” Luna talked about for so long would be… real. Sure, she’d researched with her, planned and prepared with her, rerouted an entire leg of their expedition to include this very island where the ruins were rumoured to be for Luna, but Circe help her, Hermione never actually considered that they’d ever be standing here staring at something Hermione was certain Xenophelius had made up as a bedtime story.
“I will end him,” Draco says, closing his eyes in frustration, his fingernails digging into the jagged rocks behind them.
“Anyone hungry?” Luna speaks up, interrupting their silent exchange. She swirls her wand in front of her, causing multicoloured bubbles to erupt from the tip.
Luna looks out on the moonlit sea from the balcony of their rental flat, head tilted to the side like an adorable and inquisitive crup, surveying the two men below. “They’re not coming inside.”
“It’s beautiful here,” he says, swishing his arms through the water, creating small crests of waves that lap repeatedly at Harry’s flushed skin.
Beside them, Charlie and Ron simultaneously reach for the nearest bottle of Ogden’s in brotherly commiseration as Harry and Hermione clink their teacups together.
Startled, Harry puts down his mug and walks over to the mirror above the mantel. The wound that felt so inflamed and painful last night now looks like nothing more than a shiny, pale scar. He touches a finger to his skin and hisses at the instant reaction it causes in him. He bites down on a moan, and clamps his hand hard over his neck, looking away from the kitchen and Luna’s inquisitive stare.
“Fine.” She pours, hands a glass to Luna’s father, takes a deep sip of her own and swallows. “Now then,” she says, collecting herself, “Mr Lovegood. Please, explain.”
“Wow.” Hermione slumps against the railing, eyes unfocused in the middle distance, contemplating the possibilities of a feral Veela being able to communicate mind-to-mind with someone else. But that person would have to be rather intimately connected to that particular Veela, and isn’t that curious? Harry and Draco (to Hermione’s supposed knowledge) were just friends before his untimely death. She turns her head, squinting at the two men on the jetty, brow furrowed.
Once they had gotten Draco safely inside, they wasted no time warding the house. Luna wove several charms into those wards to help Draco remain calm and stable throughout the night in the spare room they’d set up for him.
Behind them, Hermione gasps. They turn to see her hand placed over her mouth, eyes wide and staring at Luna as if betrayed. “You knew,” she says, hiding the words behind her palm. She lets her hand fall. It balls into a fist at her side. “You knew,” she repeats, voice rising.
Cecilia flicks a handful of her sunscreen potion at him with a twist of her wrist. It lands creamy white in droplets all along his torso and Draco startles at her cheek, quickly rubbing away the debauched picture she’s painted. Despite this distraction, it doesn’t escape Draco’s notice that Potter has conveniently ignored his question. Cameron is too busy adjusting the shutter speed on his 35mm to pay any attention to their conversation to care. Draco huffs and lies back on his chaise longue to grimace up at the noonday sun, hating that this is how he’s been coerced into spending his day. He could be studying in a blessedly empty flat, but no, he’s here with
“Oof!” Harry grunts, giving Luna a weak laugh, gripping her arms tightly in his large hands. “Thanks for coming.”
His voice is like acid in her mind, slicing all the wounds of her guilt afresh, and laying her bloody and exposed in the grass. Shaking her head, she wrings her hands, feeling adrift on an open sea, powerless and terrified all at once. She hadn't prepared for this conversation. Her only thought after Xenophilius told her what happened the previous evening was that she wanted to go to Draco. Immediately.
They burst out into the night in a cloud of marble dust, stumbling down the temple stairs only to land in a heap at its base. When Harry looks back, he sees the pediment violently crack and fall inward, collapsing onto the mouth of the opening they’d just run through not seconds earlier.
“Should I?” Charlie has stepped into the barn now, his arms no longer jovially crossed over his chest; instead, his hands are shoved into his pockets, his shoulders tense. Harry can see the concern rippling off the man and wishes there was something he could say to deter him from this line of questioning, but he knows it’s futile. Charlie and Harry have been each other’s keepers for too long, have been too protective of the other, too close to blood brothers to ever really let things lie. “I know how you can get–”
Draco looks at him, his hair flopping back into his eyes. Hermione can practically feel the disdain through his expression at having to mentally repeat himself.
With begrudging and glacial acceptance of the inevitable, Draco descends the stairs with Cee and Cameron in turn, and strolls out to his doom, head held high.
Draco shrugs again, looking away over his one shoulder. “It’s like I said, you’d regret it in the morning.”
Draco looks to Bill, eyes wide. “I’m so sorry,” he whispers, coming to stand, and pressing out the creases on his trousers. “I should go.”
Draco feels his cock twitch with interest, his lust rekindling as Harry loses himself. He’s pumping savagely into Draco’s mouth, one hand twisted painfully into Draco’s hair, and it’s so fucking delicious, Draco can barely concentrate. He moves his right hand, pressing his thumb between the crease of Harry’s arse to find his hole and pushes into it, dry.
The waves crash against the rocks, the breeze whips past their faces, and Draco remains steadfast above Harry, holding tight to his hair, guiding his head where he wants him. Harry’s own erection is ignored in his desperation to make Draco
“Can you leave this?” she asks, nodding to Hermione’s work. Tomorrow, over tea, she’ll attempt to tell Hermione what she knows. Breakfast is always the best time of day to share new information with Hermione.
Draco flinches and steps more firmly behind Harry, his wings encircling Harry and pulling him back against his body. Ink-stained fingers press possessively against Harry’s chest and Harry, seemingly without conscious thought, lets his head fall back on Draco’s shoulder, mouth dropping open at the feel of Draco against him. The picture they create is so beautiful in its power and presence in the room, Luna bites her lip hard, wanting to pull Hermione close.
“Come here,” he says, pulling Draco towards him and fisting his hand in his hair to guide Draco’s mouth to his. Draco meets his kiss eagerly, biting Harry’s bottom lip before sucking it into his mouth.
embracing him, strong and perfect and human once more. Their heads are buried against each other’s necks and Draco can feel the firm, dry press of Harry’s lips on his throat, in a gentle, reassuring pressure. Words are mouthed against his skin, apologies and promises both, and Draco doesn’t need to hear them aloud to know their meaning.
“A placebo effect,” he nods, putting a hand to her shoulder. “I am certain of it. The novelty of being amongst friends once more. It is only a balm placed upon an open wound, I’m afraid. He needs the potion. I shall send more soon.”
Pip bows low, ears touching the shined herringbone pattern of the old floors before Disapparating with a pop.
“Three!” Charlie corrects, holding up three fingers while bracing his hands on his knees for support.
Malfoy huffs out an inelegant laugh. “He followed her home one day six months ago, fresh from Morocco with his student visa, snapping away with that damn Muggle camera of his. He was in utter raptures about the light and the reflections of the water on the palazzos and . . . well,” he trails off with a shrug, letting his explanation lapse into silence. Harry waits for more but nothing comes, Malfoy just stares out, content to be watched, his hand idly rubbing at his opposing wrist.
Narcissa is startled by a hand on her shoulder and she jolts out of her slouch at her dressing table, eyes wide.
in the process. Bells chime in the near distance, sending pigeons fluttering from their perches on railings and clotheslines. Harry turns to the window to see the sun sinking low over the terracotta roof tiles, the golden sky streaked with saffron-stained clouds. Harry grins, amused by it all. Somehow, he’s passed an afternoon in the company of Draco Malfoy and they haven’t killed each other. He drinks deep from his glass; Hermione would be so proud.
Placing a kiss against the tender skin of Draco’s hip, Harry looks up at the man above him in a daze. He feels drunk, his vision blurred at the edges as the moment ebbs into something less frenzied, more quiet.
“Yeah. I’m feverish. And I had an odd . . . dream, last night.” He gestures out towards the balcony.
Harry watches as Draco taps a finger to his lips and looks at Harry with a mischievous glint in his eye. It sends a zing down Harry’s spine.
It’s at this moment of daydreaming disconnect that Cecilia returns, speaking rapid-fire Italian and handing out filled glasses to everyone in turn. They’re coronation glasses, apparently, from the Renaissance. Her uncle’s, if Harry is translating correctly. She keeps repeating "
stands out in startling contrast to the way Harry forms attachments. He’s intense and tactile, loyal to a fault, he’s never done anything casually in his life—except maybe schoolwork.
Thirteen and half hours later, Draco stands, holding his newborn son with concern consuming his every thought. He’s come too soon and he looks too small, too pink, too perfect. Ten fingers, ten toes, a shock of white-blond atop his head, and a red slash of a birthmark on his thigh. Draco doesn’t allow himself to cry, he doesn’t want his tears to stain the purity of his beautiful baby boy.
he thought. No, not a gallery, a round room; a trap. He pushed himself up off the floor with unsteady arms, coming to lean back against the soft-pink plaster wall behind him. The sound of rats was still audible from behind the wall, squeaking and scritching along the lath and stone. He heard a gasp from across the room and turned his head, only to find Malfoy staring at him with unchecked (and disturbing) intensity, a cigarette slowly burning down to ash in his shaking hand.
A ripple of black velvet air shifts and slides open before them, revealing not the quiet, undisturbed valley of greenery and nighttime peace that he thought was in front of them, but a city of grey stone and marble, painted deep purple in the moonlight.
“You’re not helping, Hermione,” Harry calls out, hating himself a little. He grips Draco by his shoulders and pulls him away from his neck and his body, feeling the loss of his heat and breath against his skin and immediately wants them back.
The sun is warm on Harry’s skin as he stretches, luxuriating in its surprise appearance on what was supposed to be a dreary May morning.
The beginning scene takes place the morning of Draco's seventh day at the Sanctuary, right before Harry gives Draco a broom, and surprises them all with pulling out Sirius' old motorbike to ride to the cliffs. Charlie spies Harry in the barn cleaning the bike beforehand and confronts him about his rather Slytherin-like scheme. Harry knows what he's doing, though; he wants Draco to remember all the memories they made together on that bike.
Hermione waits at the threshold, ear pressed against the door, listening to Luna sing Draco to sleep. She’ll need to ask Luna about this bewildering ability of hers to influence Veela. Hermione can recall several pieces of Luna’s from The Quibbler on Veela that she researched thoroughly, but Hermione has always taken Luna’s writing with a grain of salt. She’s brilliant and imaginative, can weave a wonderful, wild tale and lace it all together with astounding prose, but as for the reliability of her words, Hermione has never been fully convinced. Hearing Luna soothe Draco with such unwavering ease has her questioning her long-held prejudices. Perhaps it’s time for Hermione to start putting more stock in her partner’s chosen profession.
The air around them is heady with the scent of sweat and skin. It presses in on Harry in a comforting way, weighing his limbs down into the tangled sheets like a thick winter duvet. He knows they should get up, start the day, have a shower, but he doesn’t want to shake this feeling just yet—this bone-deep contentment that’s stolen over their little haven, seeped into the floorboards and the window panes, filling the room with a sense of relaxed, reassuring peace.
Harry’s adventure is ending. He mouths at his straw, feeling nostalgic for a time that still looms present and pulsing with life in front of him yet slips through his grasp no matter how hard he tries to keep hold of it. Ron and Hermione sit beside him, glowing with the air of two people who’ve enjoyed their time abroad yet are eager to get back home to their fulfilling lives. A smile flits over Harry’s face at the thought of little Rose, so quickly becoming a toddler before their eyes. Harry bought her a souvenir stuffed toy, a flying lion, the symbol of the Venetian flag. He’s planning to charm it to roar and buzz about her head with its feathery wings, hoping she’ll enjoy the little display. It’s currently tucked into his backpack wrapped in purple paper, along with another present he’s anxious to unwrap, a parting gift from Cameron he’d been handed this morning with strict instructions to open only once he was on his train.
Grinning up at him, Harry wraps a hand gently around Draco’s leg and squeezes. “I was close too.” Draco softens for a moment before Harry adds, “I’m surprised I didn’t shoot my load from the shock of it, actually.”
“You can make this up to me. You will. And then there will be no need to apologize ever again. Do you hear me?”
Draco is there, crouched on a chaise lounge, holding his head in his hands, his abandoned teacup from earlier sat beside him. He’s shaking. Harry goes to him, like a magnet sliding along metal—steady, electric, and inevitable.
“You didn’t,” Harry says. Draco removes his possessive hold on his shoulder and backs away from him. Harry reaches out and grabs Draco’s arm, keeping him from retreating. “Your face. You didn’t.”
he says, rocking against him. He feels Harry swallow, his throat working over the press of Draco’s lips, and Draco grins, liking that he’s rendered Harry speechless. He lifts his head, placing both hands reverently against Harry’s face, and stares down at him, savouring Harry’s submission. He takes the time to run his hands through Harry’s hair, the long curls cascading through his fingers like silk. Four and a half years Draco has waited to kiss Harry—longer still that he’s waited for Harry to realise how much he’s wanted—
Harry hears. He bites his lip and looks to Narcissa, notes the pain on her weathered face, the tears in her too-large, wild eyes.
“This has to be Draco,” Charlie says, approaching with an outstretched hand. He’s positively covered in freckles, eyes crinkled with decades of laugh lines, and Merlin help him, Draco finds himself charmed. This man is the less refined version of Bill with an easy smile and longer, more wild hair that works for him far more than Bill’s reserved ponytail by comparison.
Hermione’s face crumples with resigned understanding across from them. She takes a sip of her tea and shakes her head, determination resolving in her eyes. “No, it isn’t, Harry.”
Harry shifts, digging in his jacket pocket. He extracts a folded bit of parchment, worn and badly creased, and hands it to Luna with a nod of encouragement.
“Shut up,” Harry says, pulling Draco’s hair like he was told. Draco moans, shivering at the sensation. “I’m nothing compared to you.” He punctuates this by running his hand down Draco’s back, palm possessively gripping his arse. “Look at you, Draco.
“Fuck, they’re really going to—” a cry of pleasure hits the air, cutting off Malfoy’s words as the two people below come together in a rush. Harry’s fingers shake as he pulls a drag of nicotine-laced smoke deep into his lungs, overwhelmed with the subversive thrill. He had been hoping for his day to include some quick, impassioned sex, he just had expected to be an active participant, not an uninvited witness.
A week later, he broke the news to his friends. He planned to quit England for good. Ireland had never taken anything from Harry. No one he knew had died on its shores, nor promised him happiness only to rip it away again. Ireland was a mystery to him. A clean slate.
Harry turns, making sure Draco is still standing nearby. The moon, freshly risen, hangs low in the sky, sending a cascading shimmer of silver light across the water. Harry can’t help but compare the glow of the water’s sheen to the colour of Draco’s hair, which so closely matches the shade of his wings. His fingers twitch at his sides, wanting to feel the shiver of Draco’s feathers under his touch once more. The thought startles him and Harry clears his throat, running his hand through his own hair instead.
!”** Cecilia shoots back with a wicked smirk. Harry watches as Draco’s eyes flash and his cheeks flush red. Harry presses his lips together, ready for anything as the two friends square off in front of him. Perhaps they’ll throw hexes next? The anticipation is almost enough to distract Harry from his still very hard cock and its utter disappointment in being denied head. He adjusts himself with a grimace.
Shaking himself, Harry wastes no time in throwing on Sirius' old leather jacket hanging on a peg nearby and seating himself in front of Draco on the bike. He turns over the key and kicks the engine to life. The sound reverberates off the crumbling brick walls of the shed, filling their ears with the purr of the machine.
“Yes, please don’t leave on my account,” Gabrielle adds, her accent lilting and effortlessly sweet. Draco inclines his head in her direction.
With exaggerated grace, Draco bows at the hip in Harry's direction, hand placed compassionately over his heart. “Thank you, Harry.”
A knock sounds behind them and they turn. Harry’s eyes are creased with tears, happy ones, and Cecilia takes note as she smiles at the two of them. “Did someone get lucky?”
He’d called the constellations covering Potter “disgusting muggle ink” the other night, but that had been a damn lie. Draco knows down to his bones that the imagery emblazoned on Potter’s body is far from anything so plebeian. Since the moment he’d spotted them, he knew what they were:
Harry aches with a need he can’t quite name. He cracks his neck, his skin feeling too tight. He has to move, unable to stand still a moment longer. Stalking to the door, he closes his eyes to concentrate on the magic buzzing around its perimeter, desperate for escape—he figures jumping off the balcony isn’t a viable option.
He fills his mind with images of that night in the pub, the teasing way Draco leaned over his pool stick, the lick of his lips after he had taken each shot, the taste of the lime on Harry’s tongue, and his desire to taste it on Draco’s. Harry closes his eyes and pushes all that long-held yearning on to Draco as he sucks him, wanting him to feel it, and to know that none of this is born of a fever, but from a deep well of affection Harry’s harboured for Draco all these years.
“That’s fine,” she calls over the din of the running water. “You’re mad at me. I understand. But Draco, Max is not Harry’s partner!”
“I’ve wanted you like this . . . so long.” Harry is rubbing the pads of his thumbs into the dips right above Draco’s hips, fascinated by the quickly tightening fabric. He can see the thick outline of Draco’s erection against the seam of his zip, and his mouth waters at the thought of taking him like this, up here above the city, the wind in their hair, the bike’s engine alive with sound and heat beneath them. He’s weak with wanting, and before he can even swallow down his own lust he’s vanishing Draco’s clothes with barely a thought. With a blink they’re gone, and Harry stares down, shocked at his own boldness.
“That’s . . . interesting.” He shifts in his seat and Luna knows how he feels. She wants to be happy for her father, for Draco’s mother too, but it’s all just a jumble of messy emotions in her mind. Her father had made his intentions known even before Lucius’ death. She remembers Draco telling her that he’d visited the Manor to help Narcissa with her potions garden late last spring.
Luna smiles at Harry; a sad, heartbroken smile that means she doesn’t have an answer for him. He touches a hand to her arm in understanding before curiosity gets the better of him, and he steps around Hermione to approach the Veela once more. This time, there’s no lashing out, no painful cry, just a prickling of feathers as the creature’s entire body tenses at Harry’s presence, like a string pulled to the breaking point. Without thinking, Harry whispers the incantation to a spell he’d been taught a few years after the war, when he was desperate to forget his grief. He watches the spell take hold as the Veela’s feathers unruffle and the massive wings fold themselves into a more relaxed position against his body, revealing the man beneath them.
“Call me Harry,” he tells him. “And I like knowing you’ve carried a torch for me all this time. Feel free to keep the watch, by the way.”
Taking this in stride, Luna nods and tries to feel happy for her father, despite the pang inside her that laments this news. She never thought he would ever leave their ancestral home, yet watching her father collect lapis tiles suggests otherwise. When Xenophilius sets his mind to a new task, all the others in its wake are left to languish in the dying grass, abandoned and mourning the light her father once bestowed upon them. Luna knows from experience.
been there last night, just no one had bothered to tell Harry he’d dyed his hair. Harry looks up at it, the way it tumbles over Draco’s aristocratic forehead and the soft waves of its length as it brushes his shoulders. Draco’s wearing a button-down shirt that’s two sizes too large for him. It’s open at the throat and has slipped precariously to one side, exposing an obscene amount of collarbone. Harry wants to bite that collarbone, mark it with his teeth.
Draco feels a brush of his son’s fingers through his hair before the connection closes and the tears break free of his lashes, trailing a searing path down his cheeks and chin. Behind him, the foal nuzzles at his neck, her legs sturdy once more, her leathery wings folded neatly at her sides. Draco hasn’t left her alone since the incident on the cliffs, bringing her back with him to his room and making a space for her in front of the hearth, piled high with blankets and pouffes. He can hear the whinny of the foal’s mother just outside the window and moves to unlatch the pane, allowing the mother to crane her neck inside the room, snuffling at her child’s head.
Harry hasn’t set foot on English soil for over twenty years, and Ron’s promise has remained true all that time. The Weasleys have split their holidays between the island and the Burrow for as long as Harry can remember and the kids have all spent at least two weeks out of their summer holidays here since they’ve been old enough to fly on the back of a Thestral, or in Victoire, Dominique, and Louis’ case an equipage led by a team of giant winged palominos, courtesy of Madame Maxine. Despite Harry’s determination to remain isolated, he’s never felt alone.
“Oh, this isn’t about me, Harry. This is about Granger. Weasley. Bill. Fleur, all of them. You left your entire fucking family.”
“It’s my fault. I should—” Harry stands, not knowing exactly what his next move will be, but he knows that the atmosphere in the room is suddenly missing a key component. The decadence around him feels oppressive as opposed to eclectic, the greenery claustrophobic as opposed to welcoming. He turns on the spot, looking for his shoes, not knowing what to do once he finds them under a side table. There’s a firefly fluttering its wings on the toe of one shoe and he takes special care as he slips it on his foot, not wanting to disturb the tiny, glowing thing. Its presence feels precious to Harry.
She’s shaking her head against the soft velvet of his robes, hating herself more and more. “It’s been two years. He doesn’t even know me anymore.”
Draco shifts, sitting further back on Harry’s thighs. Harry feels the loss of his heat and moves to rest his hands on Draco’s hips, halting his retreat. Draco allows it and Harry squeezes gently. “What are you still atoning for?”
Xenophilius folds himself around her, wrapping her tightly in his arms. She allows the comfort, soaking in the feeling of being held and selfishly never wanting it to end. He pulls back only to place kisses on the long scars running the length of her forearms, bowing his head in reverence to her past sorrow.
“I know,” Hermione sighs, shaking her head. “The entire place has been practically vibrating around us since you left. I’m terrified it’ll cave in, but the wards are holding.”
Harry’s still quiet and contemplative by the time they reach the stream. He looks past the water, into the middle distance. “Is it wrong to have a full life yet still be unhappy?”
Draco pulls the lapels of his dressing gown closer over his chest, as if Harry had the ability to strip him bare with his eyes. That thought creates quite an image in Harry’s mind but he ignores it in place of trying to seem as welcoming as possible to the man standing awkwardly across from him, barefoot, bemused, and looking thoroughly skeptical.
Harry swallows, his pulse quickening at the insistence of that single word command. He doesn’t have it in him to deny Draco anything in that moment and moves to stroke the wing again—
He makes it two paces before looking over his shoulder and asking, eyebrow raised, “Do you think sodomy is a sin, padre?”
Luna puts down her cup and stares out the window at Draco with his curled, ruffled wings and bowed head out on the jetty, huddled in on himself with a shame he shouldn’t have to feel. “He’d sneak down to the dungeons at night to bring me food, cast warming charms, use magic to help us, even though he wasn’t supposed to—it was terribly dangerous for him. He earned my friendship even in the darkest moment of my life.”
It feels like a confession, like a literal gut punch, which is why Harry’s breath pushes out hard from his nose at the words. Draco doesn’t linger in the moment. He slips away in one smooth motion, sliding off his stool and walking backwards, holding eye contact with Harry the entire time. He might as well be beckoning Harry with a crook of his finger.
Hermione’s silence is as much of an answer as any. Luna turns towards her, only to find her face a mask of horrified realisation.
Harry takes in the beauty of him, standing there, barefoot and draped in silk, surrounded by greenery as the morning sun glows warm and low across the floorboards, reaching out its tendrils of late-summer heat into the room. Draco’s silver-blond hair is illuminated with a verdant gleam. He looks like a wild thing, composed yet utterly free at the centre of it all; a native prince embraced by a jungle of his own creation.
“Ruined it in the best possible way.” Harry leans in, pressing his forehead to Draco’s. “The best possible way,” he repeats, unable to stop the words.
Because of this fierce belief, Harry holds back from teasing Draco for his undignified squeak of surprise. Such immaturity will not endear him to the man any more than he already has, what with his gruff behaviour and frequent disappearances whenever Draco's been around since the incident at the cliffs.
“Grazie,” Hermione says, nodding her head towards the waiter who’s brought yet another Bellini to their lounge chairs on the hot sand.
But Draco had admitted it, so many times over that Harry could no longer keep track. So why did he continue to rib him with the demons of his past? Why did he have to bring it up every time they disagreed? He was a fool, a bastard, and now he stands, alone in his drafty old pile of a house, shaking.
Draco makes a fierce picture before them: bloodied teeth, black nails like talons, practically hissing with his anger as he glares at Harry. Hermione feels useless standing just behind Harry’s shoulder, completely overlooked by the pair of them, save for Draco’s eyes darting every now and again to the wand in her hand.
are audible throughout the island. Beside him, Cecilia and Cameron have begun an interpretive dance in the grand tradition of
. He flips the cardboard sleeve over, eyes immediately landing on the familiar inscription printed at the bottom—
They land hard in a dark valley. Harry looks up, thankful for the full moon as his eyes adjust to the sudden absence of light. He blinks rapidly, regretting that he wasn’t wearing shoes when Luna oh-so forcefully transported him across the island without his consent.
“Yeah. Go use it.” Harry laughs, waving him off as Ron dashes out of the sitting room like a kid at Christmas and Hermione is the gift waiting for him wrapped under the tree.
“I knew—” Draco’s saying but Harry doesn’t let him finish the thought. He grabs the back of Draco’s neck, twisting his hand into the gorgeous pink shock of his hair, and pulls him forward. They connect to the sound of thunder ricocheting across the sky.
Draco’s attention trails off as Fleur continues to boast in rapturous tones about the beauty of the small village where she and Bill had renewed their vows. He’s turned toward Gabrielle, watching her watch him with those deeply assessing hazel eyes that seem to know so much while asking so little in return. He loves her for that, for the ease that she brings into his life, the calm acceptance and comfort her presence wraps around him. He tips forward and buries his face into her neck, allowing the curtain of his blond hair to hide him. He can feel her laughter resonate through her throat as she holds him close and tells her sister how much of a cuddler he is, her voice fond. He basks in the warmth of the smells and sounds around him: lavender and fresh mint for the hearty lamb roasting in the oven and the tang of the rosé Gabrielle is sipping. This is a home so filled with love he’s weak from the daydream of being accepted inside its walls.
“Doubtful.” Begrudgingly, Draco gets up and follows his mad flatmate, because sunning himself next to the golden boy of the Wizarding World without the guise of a photoshoot to keep him there is not something he ever pictured himself doing. At least, not willingly.
He’d felt his magic like a tangible thing all evening, and all night. He dozed in a half-sleep state, aching from his lust-filled dreams of Draco’s mouth, Draco’s cock, Draco’s pale skin and pink hair held tight in his fist. Harry shifts his hips, his cock needy and demanding attention. He palms it, sighing into the early morning quiet of the room. He looks over, sees Draco’s watch on the nightstand, and frowns. The ever-present countdown to his departure looms large and heavy in his mind.
“Oi!” Harry shouts from just outside the kitchen door. “Move it, people.” And then to Draco’s astonishment he hears the turn-over of a Muggle engine kick to life with a roar.
Somewhere in the background Draco hears the click of the shutter and knows that Cameron has captured forever his reaction to Potter’s words. He feels overheated at the thought.
Harry had stood stock-still in the middle of his room, barefoot and shellshocked, staring at the rafters above, wondering how everything had gone so pear-shaped in such a short amount of time. They’d always done this, been like this, at each other’s throats in a split-second, but it was always a catalyst into biting kisses and panted confessions of don’t stop, and please, never leave me.
” the mirror tells him in a deep, masculine voice. Draco flushes and steps back, flattered yet feeling caught.
Cecilia lifts the wide-brimmed straw hat she’d been using as a sun shield off her curls and looks to Draco with a raised eyebrow. “Who?”
“The . . . whatever the thing is that’s,” Harry gestured to Malfoy’s person as if that explained things, “making you upset?”
Draco’s mouth twists into a smirk as his fingers work their way farther up Harry’s shin to the back of his knee.
They round the corner and Hermione and Luna come to a skidding halt, leaving Harry to stumble into them at their sudden stop. He starts to apologize but then chokes on nothing but air at the sight before them. Without conscious thought, he steps forward past his two friends.
“He isn’t speaking,” Harry was saying, his face morose and miserable-looking as he stares at Draco still slumped against the far wall.
Harry sets up the table using a funny little wooden triangle to collect the colourful balls as Luna orders another round, and for a while, Luna makes sure that Harry focuses only on the game and not their mutual loss. For a while, they pretend he’s still there.
The wind is pushing at his back, insistent and herding, shoving him towards the cliff’s edge as if a large hand were ushering him forward. He trips on a rock and stumbles to the ground, scraping his knees on the jagged mix of stone and grass beneath him. As he moves to stand he realises that he’s shaking, violent fits of tremors running through his body. His teeth are chattering.
Draco thinks, holding Harry close to him, the scent of his adrenaline and anger tainting the air around them like an acrid smoke Draco is desperate to inhale. He breathes in deeply, wanting the toxic burn in his lungs to obscure the tantalizing smell of Xenophilius’ experimental potions wafting off his robes and drifting towards him on the sea breeze. Draco has learned to hate the smell of those potions and tonics, no matter how alluring they might be. They remind him of an uncertain time when his mind was divided between sanity and the animal that now consumes him so completely—together they exist within one flesh, bird and human.
” He hears, but realises a moment too late that he’s hearing Harry’s voice inside his mind and not over the rain. He shakes himself and refocuses on the foal, sending air gusts up under her wings and levitation charms at her to encourage her away from the dangers below. It’s not working, and she’s only dipping closer to the water. Draco follows.
Harry hears Max’s name echo in Draco’s thoughts and he looks back up at Hermione, imploring her without words to shut the ever-loving-fuck up. He rubs a hand across his abdomen, attempting to settle the sudden upset.
Harry can’t shake the image from his brain. It’s tantalising, the idea of two men on the bridge, as opposed to a man and a woman. Of him and Malfoy, sharing cigarettes and listening in on a pair of men connecting in
He wheezed out a laugh. “Not. Feeling. Too great,” he said, his voice breaking on the last word. Harry wondering when all the air had left his lungs. In front of him, the Draco statue moved with surprising dexterity; flapping about like a bird with a broken wing, frantic and frazzled. His chiseled white hair had come loose from the onyx ribbon he’d tied it back with, strands falling into his eyes before he’d shove them back with carrara fingers, mussing it further. Harry watched him as his vision blurred, his eyesight closing in on him, as if the round wall of the room was contracting inward.
Grabbing hold of Hermione's hand, Luna drags them away from the cliff’s craggy edge, and the cornswallow silk, and down into the valley below.
“How was it?” Hermione asks. She’s joined Harry out on the balcony of their rental flat, leaning on the stone balustrade next to him.
Harry’s anxiety was spiking with the ever-growing silence, feeling uneasy about what had transpired earlier: how his hands appeared healed but, according to Malfoy, were still very much cursed. He looked down at them, at the blunt fingernails and calloused palms, the veins of his wrists and the uneven lines of his own messy handwriting carved into the back of his left hand, the words faded to light slashes of puckered skin over the years leaving only ‘must not’ and ‘lie’ visible. Seeing those three words spurred him into action.
After he finishes off both Cecilia’s and Cameron’s drinks, he lies back on his chaise, closes his eyes, and pretends not to think about seeing so much of Harry Potter laid out next to him like a pornographic feast. He rubs absentmindedly at his wrist, fidgeting like a first-year.
Harry slams down his third shot of tequila, the glass hitting the bartop with a dull thwack. He most certainly should not be having a third shot of tequila on top of the countless lagers from earlier, but he had lost the last game of pool, and this is Draco’s preferred punishment. So, down the hatch it goes.
Harry wakes to a knocking at the front door. He rises from his tangled sheets, darkened with a telling stain that speaks to the vivid dreams he’s been plagued with since Draco’s arrival. Rubbing a hand through his over-long hair, he looks around, blurry-eyed for his glasses and Sirius’ pocket watch. It reads 8:40 AM and Harry shrugs, figuring he can’t be mad at whoever is at the door if it’s solidly past eight in the morning. That’s just the harsh reality of adulthood. He Scourgifies the sheets and climbs out of bed.
She hisses, seeing how deep the bite is, and curses once again. Draco’s no better than a feral animal judging by this bite. No matter how well they all grew to know Draco after the war, and how generous and good-hearted that man turned out to be, that version of Draco no longer exists. And if it does, he’s currently trapped inside the mind of a creature that’s had years to alter Draco’s state of being. They’d been fools to trust him. Utter fools.
“Hope you like Limoncello,” Harry breathes, voice harsh. He rocks back against Max, eliciting a moan of approval.
Harry chokes on nothing and Cecilia chuckles, sounding delighted as she pushes him towards the door.
He tastes the bitterness of adrenaline on his tongue as he sprints to the Portkey office, heart racing with the intensity of the moment.
His shaking hands moved too quickly for Harry to react, one fisting into the front of his white tee-shirt and the other grabbing hold of the haphazard bun resting at the base of Harry’s neck and yanked simultaneously. His head went one direction and his body the other, leaving him utterly exposed, his entire body tensing under Malfoy’s touch. His own hands came up to grip at Malfoy’s forearms, his fingers digging into the sinewy muscle he found there. Malfoy’s lips were at his ear, his words leaving soft pants of humid air against the vulnerable line of his neck.
Harry holds back a pathetic sound and punches out the words through his teeth: “You have a lot of them.”
Harry echoes back. Even in his mind, he sounds helpless and needy, the little slag. Draco’s body sings at the supplication and what it means for the two of them. Everything else falls away in Draco’s lust-filled, animal-driven mind. The man who sends Harry letters, the screaming chasm of lost time that yawns wide and black before them, Hermione’s disagreeable frown: none of it matters anymore. Harry was his that night in the pub, he’s his now, he’ll be his tomorrow. Always. Draco shifts his hips, thrusting his point and Harry presses back, a heady confirmation.
This wasn’t what Harry had expected from Charlie after Draco’s arrival. He and Charlie had talked, after all. For hours that night, over too much firewhiskey and then too many cups of tea cloudy with cream, about what Draco’s presence in Harry’s life again could mean, what it
“Talking. Researching. All of it. Even the plums were abandoned and have since gone to seed,” Luna says with a sigh. “‘Shame. They make the best jam.”
“Feel that?” Harry asks as the engine purrs. He cups Draco’s cheek, thumb brushing over his plump mouth before he drags his hand down over Draco’s neck and puts pressure against his chest to fit the line of his spine into the smoothed curve of the bike’s graceful design. Draco arches and settles against the metal, his hips moving in a sinuous slide against Harry’s own as he relaxes into the contours of the bike, allowing its vibrations to overwhelm him just like Harry wanted.
“I’m sorry too,” Harry mumbles, turning his head away. Draco pushes it back in his direction with a single knuckle under his chin.
“Turn around,” he says, stealing one last kiss before guiding Draco to drape his legs, one and then the other over the seat. Draco does as he’s told, graceful as ever as he lays himself forward onto the metal and leather like a damn snake coiling itself happily in someone’s lap before striking.
” Harry felt the cold tip of Malfoy’s nose run down the line of his neck before he continued, “I want you, Harry. That curse lit a fucking fire inside me. One I’ve been careful to keep tamed all these years.”
“Your tongue,” Draco gasps, burying his face in the pillow, practically shaking with need at all his long-held fantasies coming true. Harry’s hands are massaging the backs of his thighs, keeping him open and exposed. Draco burns with the knowledge that Harry is making a study of him, watching him twitch with anticipation.
“Draco, what did you do?” Harry asks, his voice a shattered, terrible thing, and it cuts Hermione to the quick just to hear it.
“Yes,” Harry says, feeling the weight of the moment, along with the weight of Draco’s thighs pressed so tightly against his own. The shared love and loss between them along with the shared heat radiating from water, and the sombre note the evening has struck ring out around them. They’re surrounded by an endless sky streaked with starlight and thick clouds of steam radiating from the pool yet there’s never enough distraction to keep their demons at bay. Harry doesn’t want to feel the melancholy sting of such histories any longer, he’s sick of it. He wants it gone—no, repressed. Pushed down for the sake of the moment. Covered up and put away for a time.
Malfoy’s breaths were coming fast again and it struck Harry to notice that he’d not met his eyes once during their exchange. Instead, they were darting about the room, landing everywhere except on Harry. What with his disheveled hair and manic behavior, Malfoy almost seemed feral. His magic was sparking, flashes of purple and gold rippling off the chair rail behind him, circling round to Harry, tickling at his skin. Harry stood, shaking off the feeling. Malfoy took in a sharp breath.
That’s what Harry thought they’d been doing. He thought Draco was challenging him with an innocent flirtation, a dare, like how it was before. Circe, how wrong he’d been.
“Essense of Valerian, crystalline silver, and lapis dust, a concoction the Seraphim angels who bred with wizards created over a millennia ago.” He bows, handing it to Hermione, who takes it with curious fingers.
Harry has long since buried his deep-rooted resentment towards Gabrielle (and the painful truth that she could provide a Malfoy heir whilst Harry could not) in the decades since her and Draco’s wedding. He had an entire island’s worth of coastline to scream out his embittered thoughts to, allowing them to get lost in the gale. Even though Harry had often wished things had gone differently in their youth, he never would have hoped for such tragedy to befall Scorpius and his beloved father. No one deserves to lose the people they love, no matter what age or circumstance. Harry knows that more than anyone.
Hermione sighs and hangs her head, weary beyond measure. Luna’s right, Hermione knows she’s right, but that doesn’t stop her from catastrophising every possible scenario that could happen as soon as they step through that gossamer curtain between worlds and leave the wards behind. There’s a strong hand in hers and Hermione looks up to see Luna, sure-footed and resplendent before her, covered in dust and sweat and glowing in the moonlight. It’s the easiest thing in the world to follow along with her when Luna looks at her that way and so, Hermione does.
Draco’s shoulders spike, the embarrassment of his cowardice washing over him again. Yes, everyone fights, but not everyone Apparates away from such things and doesn’t come back for days on end. Draco hasn’t been back to Grimmauld Place in a week. He’d fled first to France to his mother and then, when the endless supply of macarons, the crushing weight of familial expectation and champagne got to be too overwhelming for his tastes, he ran to Fleur. She’s been an ally and friend since the days of fourth-year when speaking to the Beauxbaton students in their native French was his only reprieve from the horrors of puberty and his sexual awakening at the sight of Harry besting a dragon on the back of a broom.
Draco blinks hard at these words, the amount of new information an assault to his already spinning equilibrium. “Teddy is practically Harry’s son. He adores him.”
For Draco's sake, for all of their sake, Narcissa comes to a decision. She stands, the world swaying slightly in front of her, and moves to untie the laces that keep the brocade sleeves of her silk robes in place. One by one, she plucks at the crisscrossed ribbon, feeling the fabric loosen around her forearms. She notes that Xenophilius' daughter is beside her, watching her intently, but this does not change her mind. She too needs to know the consequences of Draco's freedom.
“Too true,” George mumbles through a mouth of fried potato, then nods to Harry. “So, you gonna sweep left, or whatever, on the crup?”
“This is madness!” Narcissa shouts to Xenophilius over the rushing wind as they fly over the hills on a single broom, too small for the two of them. It belonged to Draco when he was a schoolboy; his first Nimbus.
A bitter laugh comes out of him like a bark. He shakes his head, feels the warmth of tears stain his cheeks. “You can’t perform miracles, Granger, no matter how brilliant you are.”
“Why do I feel this way?” Harry asks, his hands pressed hard to his stomach where the pain is greatest.
Anger crashes over him like the treacherous tide. “How could . . . you were just . . . you were going to let her die?” He’s shivering too hard to truly shout and it pisses him off even more.
Draco thrashes, spasming uncontrollably on the bed, his wings knocking over everything within reach in the small room. Hermione considers the very real possibility that she won’t be able to get him stable and they’ll have no choice but to emergency Portkey him to St. Mungo’s. She says as much but is met with a wall of adamant refusals.
“Good. Settled then.” Draco drops his hand from his face, and weakly gestures to Harry with a crook of his finger. “C’m’here.”
“We can’t risk it,” Hermione says, her hand to her chin, face pinched with concern. “He can’t even consent to a Side-Along.”
The man steps back, releasing him. “Not yet, sweetheart.” He smiles soft and genuine behind his mask, his smooth palm against Harry’s cheek. Harry leans into it, kisses his slim wrist; presses his lips to the delicate blue veins visible just under his porcelain skin. The man sighs, melting at the gentle affection yet pulls away, his smile fading into the crowd along with his presence.
Patting his chest, Charlie gasps, "Grand!” before doubling over with laughter. Teddy joins him, practically falling to his knees at Charlie’s side.
“I shouldn’t have shown him that letter.” Hermione drops her head into her hands, tears of exhaustion spilling from the corners of her eyes. “I tried to explain to Draco afterwards. I just don’t know if he fully listened.”
Charlie throws his head back and laughs. Draco watches the lines of his throat work for a moment before forcing himself to look away out over the horizon.
Harry wants to ask who, but the ‘she’ Luna mentions can only mean one person. The only person left in Draco’s life: Narcissa.
Shaking his head, Draco looks at him with a question in his eyes. He inhales another drag, eyebrows raising.
Cameron halts his acrobatics with the cocktail shaker and stares at the two of them, perplexed. “Dee?” he asks, tilting his head to the side like an inquisitive crup.
“It’s already gone too far, hasn’t it?” she asks, sounding astoundingly sad while commenting on something that should bring them all joy.
Harry swallows, overwhelmed with the confession. “Me too,” he admits, pulse beating rapidly in his throat. He can feel it vibrate through him, he’s so tightly-strung.
“Yes, I spotted that,” Hermione says, handing Luna a cup of tea with a splash of firewhisky. They’re both freshly showered, hair twisted up in towels and clothed in matching silk robes. It’s been nearly an hour since Harry suggested they head in.
Draco’s pulling back the elastic, and Harry finally feels the heat of the day touch his bare skin just as a whistle cuts the air, long and harsh and sharp. Harry blinks; he knows that sound. So does Draco.
Harry feels his heart kick in his chest at the confirmation. His breath coming faster, blood rushing through his veins with extra purpose. He pulls Draco on top of him, holds his face in his hands.
“No, s’mine. I bumped into you,” Harry insists, pressing forward thanks to the crowd shoving in behind him. He feels the heat of the man in front of him and can’t help but grin, liking the sensation more than he should. “Though I can’t say that I’m too sorry,” he adds, pressing closer, the buzz he’s coasting on making him brash, pushing all thoughts of Draco and his absence to the back of his mind.
“Did you find the elf? What happened? Luna!” She hurls herself at Luna, grasping her tightly and breathing in the scent of lavender that always lingers around her. Behind the bloom of her blonde hair, Hermione sees Harry in the foyer and throws out a hand to him, gripping his forearm like a ship finding anchor in a storm.
Feeling a sudden tug, Harry breaks the kiss and curses as he’s swept from the stone tiles of the balcony and lifted into the air. Draco’s flying, floating them down over the railing towards the rocks of the jetty.
Harry smiles at the fondness in Draco’s voice. The sneering curled lip of their school days is long gone from his tone.
Draco gasps, a small exhalation of surprised breath. Harry aches at that precious sound and he’s terrified to examine why. He closes his eyes against the tumultuous tide of thoughts rushing through his mind at having to hear that surname again after all these years. He always forgets that Sirius and Narcissa were cousins. It’s as if his brain blocks the connection on purpose.
The bittersweet scent of Campari is hot on Potter’s breath as he moves, holding himself at bay mere inches from Draco’s mouth. “You think I’m acting?” Potter asks, his tone playful yet deadly.
Blinking, Harry turns and spies Cecilia walking over the bridge, making quite the picture of a Venetian woman with a bushel of flowers in hand and a tote of bottles clinking lightly at her side in the bright sunshine of an Italian afternoon.
Harry didn’t press. He’d gleaned more about Malfoy’s life post-Hogwarts in the last five minutes than he had the last five years, and felt too full with the knowledge to take in more. Despite it all, he found Malfoy’s chosen path of study rather . . . charming. He smirked and turned back to the paintings. He was feeling better now that he was standing, his headache gone, and his mind otherwise occupied from their precarious situation. Which was precisely when his hand started to throb at his side, rudely reminding him of all that had happened within the past hour. He doubled over in pain, his left hand holding tight to his opposite wrist as if to staunch the onslaught.
Arms falling to his sides, Harry looks at the expanse of pale chest in front of him, and the white, blunt contrast of the scars he caused so many years ago, feeling the leaching suck of his own self-hatred pulling him under. How many more times will Harry continue to hurt the people he loves?
that leads directly off the bridge. Looking up, he reads the numbers above the ancient wooden doors lining the shaded alley, carved into the stone in Roman numerals, and raps his knuckles on the faded black door when he finds the correct address.
“Why is it that I had to fly in on one of these bony beasts while you lot are zooming about on your brooms as if Hermione didn’t explicitly tell me that such magic was prohibited, hmm?” He’d directed the question at Teddy but it’s Charlie who answers.
Grabbing a stray pen off the countertop strewn with collection samples and drying herbs, he twists his hair up into a bun atop his head, feeling too overheated with it lying over his shoulders. He runs his arm across his forehead; his skin is searing.
Hermione looks uneasy and Luna leans across the workbench to twirl a finger through one of her curls. “It’s alright,” she assures her. “I love your elderberry jam. And my father found a new project, don’t you see?”
Something spooks the herd just beyond them and he sees Pol jerk out of his touch, shake her head and follow her mother out along the craggy rock. He follows them on foot, wondering at their sudden momentum in the opposite direction of the paddock and the stables, only to find endless sky above him and endless ground to cover beneath his feet.
