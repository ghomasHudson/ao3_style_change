“You are awake” Harry’s husky voice vibrated in his chest. Draco felt a shiver running down his spine and managed to incorporate a bit.
“Oh, that’s why it seemed familiar. I think I heard it a couple times at Hogwarts” another moment of comprehension hit him “Wait, does that mean he was a half-blood?!”
or tried, at least. It was, according to the other man, some kind of offline, whatever on the name of Morgana that was, database, which was a more comprehensible term for Draco, a portable, shrunken library. The single constant thought in his mind had been that, for a muggle thing, it had a very wizarding-like name. He could imagine himself waving his wand and saying
“I will remember that. Now, let us get you both out of this place” Harry nodded and stood up, carrying Draco in his arms like the prince he was.
“To protect him?” Shestakov was fuming.
He worked mostly with the magical population, but had a couple of days a week saved for muggle shifts; he didn’t want to become rusty. More often than not people reached him as a private healer or consultant, and when not working, he was researching or spending time with Teddy or his friends.
“My house-elf. Well, he is more devoted to the house itself, but I think I have grown in him over the years and he actually likes me a bit now” Draco smiled at that. Who wouldn’t?
“Why do you have flour in your hair?” Ron asked while Hermione hugged him.
“He wouldn’t let me give him any money. And I’m usually very convincing but I have to admit that the boy has his ways; he could charm a goblin with those eyes”
“Didn’t have you for a kid’s person, Malfoy” he joked. But Draco was not joking and he apparently felt it since he stopped smiling “Are you serious?” he paled “Are you pregnant?”
A completely absurd prophecy, if you asked Harry. He had cracked most of the meaning while he talked to Death. He was the one it loved the most, he was supposed to have helped Draco and Alexei and he had been there, chatting with a psychopath…and Death. But he would deal with his insecurities later.
They walked all the way to the other side of the library, passing bookshelf after bookshelf until they reached a squared platform with a green carpet as floor. Alexander indicated for him to step by his side on the platform and pointed his wand to it. Before knowing, Harry was floating all the way up to the second level of the library like in an elevator.
Against his mother’s idea, he was not a hermit. He did enjoy the social life in Marseille, but not as much as her or as one would have expected from him in the past. Draco was more interested in making connections for his work and, therefore, was usually involved in professional meetings and rendezvous, rather than pleasure night; and even when he engaged in the last he found no reason to grant access to anyone to his personal space. His friends had permission to apparate at his place, any other person should have to try different methods.
Harry passed a hand through his own hair. His eyes locked on Draco’s chest going up and down.
He had to overcome that fear sooner or later. He reached for his wand, that was next to his clothes on the floor and focused on a simple charm. The water moved but nothing else happened. He was not confident enough, he was being too cautious.
“If she finds out and I die, please, tell Malfoy I have always loved him” Ron shivered.
“Did you just do that?”
“Death is supposed to be simple. Life is the complicated one” he answered back and tried to dodge it.
” Harry pushed Draco out of the way and casted his own spell that crashed against the green beam, which disappeared at the contact since it was not being directed by anything. He had never been happier of having a wand.
She complained but accepted her defeat and he went back to get Tatiana. Not a hard task, the girl had gotten distracted with a bee on one of the flowers. She even squeaked scared when he touched her shoulder and went back running to the base where Olga and Maria were talking about dancing lessons.
“I’m sorry. I should have known it wasn’t going to be easy”
“There’s no need. Could you please prepare something to eat? We will be in the library or the studio”
He didn’t not register the ten seconds that followed Draco’s voice. His attention was on the blond. His mind was blurred by happiness and his eyes with tears. He was safe. He was back. He had chosen to live, to go back to him and their world.
were the most interesting subject was the descent of Hogwarts’ founders.
An hour later, Draco woke up. Harry had given him a potion and he had fallen sleep almost immediately.
“If you are doing that to wake me up I’m going to pretend to be asleep forever” his voice was muffled by his chest, but the vibrations made Harry shiver. He moved his hand to Draco’s hip “Go on. I’m sleeping” Harry took the chance and caress his way under Draco’s shirt. He felt cold under his palm and he heard the blond moan softly.
“Oh, you wish” he was openly smirking now, but followed Harry through the door, not without addressing the portrait once more “A pleasure to meet you, Regulus, my mother is fine and she would be pleased to know I have talked to you. Have a nice day”
Narrow passage, door on the left, no light, just keep walking, keep moving. He saw a light, a gap on the stone, a strand of green wool, he managed to get to the other side, he felt his heart break.
“Yeah, thanks Luna, I’ll make sure he gets a heads up on the matter” she smiled brightly “Well, this is ready, shall we?”
“Is she there?” he asked and she shrugged. Yes, she was.
Harry was fully concentrated in his attentions and Draco thought for a moment he would pass out from the pleasure he was feeling. It had been too long and he wasn’t going to last much more.
“Are you okay, Draco? What is this room?” she asked.
“Breakfast is ready, Master Potter” Kreacher announced when he stepped out of the bathroom and he went downstairs with just his pants on and a book he had grabbed earlier in hand. Oatmeal and coffee awaited him and Harry thanked the elf, who had the most amazing talent to know exactly what he could stomach or not, and started eating.
Draco made his way to the bathroom, that was obviously where Harry had come from. A soft, green towel had been left for him and Draco thought for a moment in asking Harry to clean and compose his clothes, but he had to stop fearing his magic. If he turned into Alexei, well, they could use the opportunity to gather more information; anyway, he decided to do it after taking a most needed shower. It was obvious Harry had remodeled the bathroom, since Draco was incapable of imagining his ancestors washing themselves in a black-marble-tiled, modern shower with glass doors, automatic water-keys and multidirectional jets. Well…he could barely imagine himself doing that, but there was no doubt Potter enjoyed his bathroom time. He stepped into the shower, confused about the many keys, but as soon as he closed the screen, the upper jet actioned itself and let the water flow at the perfect temperature. Draco stayed like that for a couple minutes before locating the shampoo and pouring some on his palm. It was honey-scented, but it smelled different in the bottle, it was not exactly how Harry’s hair smelled and for some reason, it bothered him.
The lobby was strangely decorated, with half of it in red and gold and the other half in a pure white, each one connected to a set of stairs with similar ornamentation. The reception was in the middle, elegant but normal, no particular color inclination.
“I see” Harry was smiling. Broadly. He was so tempted to kiss his boyfriend at that moment that he had to bite hard his lower lip.
Last night’s conversation with Malfoy had left him completely shaken. Not only the blond was having a difficult time with some weird symptoms, that Harry was almost convinced had something to do with either his soul or the darkest of magics, but he also had apologized in tears with him for everything. He didn’t have anything to forgive the man for, as he had left the past where it belonged and he held no grudge for Draco anymore. He had saved his life somehow and even as a teenager Harry had been able to understand why the boy was that way. Maybe he would have reacted the same way if someone had mocked his name when he was elven, who knows? And who cares? The point was, Harry had been shocked when he had seen the other wizard crying and expressing his feelings, his true feelings, that way. He had had the impulse of hugging Draco, as he would have done with his friends or Teddy, and that was strange enough.
“Is there a possibility we can’t go?” Draco asked and Ellias laughed.
“Come in” Harry pushed the door open and left Draco go inside first “Ah, Mr. Malfoy, Potter, I never thought I will see the two of you come into my office again, let alone together. Sit, I’ll be back with your portkey” he said and left the room. They had been forced to take an official portkey from the ministry given their identities. Harry had protested when Hermione had told him, but Draco had looked resigned.
He was there, wasn’t he? He had to. He always was when Draco felt happy.
He kept working on those through the morning, rejecting just a couple of applications, until his mother brought him lunch. Two silver trays levitated behind her; she had taken the habit of eating with him in his bedroom, something outrageous in other circumstances, but inevitable now, as she threatened to keep an eye on him at all times.
“Hermione’s baby. It’s a boy” he drifted off then with four things on his mind: he was happy, he was sad, he was in love, he wanted to go home.
Someone that was not Draco.
“Of course. He knows better. Lovely to see you, Narcissa”
Why did he know that?
They arrived to the library in less than twenty minutes, and Harry cursed himself for not choosing a longer way there. He had savored every second of that ride. Since Hagrid gave it to him, his godfather’s bike was one of the most valuable thing for Harry. He had taken the muggle test for driving and gotten the ministry permission to use an enchanted vehicle after he had turned eighteen and since then, he had chased every opportunity to use it. It gave him a sense of freedom he was not used to experience outside of a broom and, to his advantage, he could use his bike among the muggles as well.
“Are you ready?” came the voice of the soldier.
“It’s fiction, prince. That doesn’t happen in real life” Draco looked up at him confused.
“That’s the problem, it is not something you get or catch and for sure is not a thing you miss while growing up. That’s why I thought of dark magic, a curse maybe”
“You are Harry Potter” she was not asking but he nodded anyway “You should go find Professor Malfoy” she whispered and Harry’s heart turned upside down inside his chest.
“I’m coming, Bibly. Would you please lock the workshop for me?” as the elf nodded he twirled his feet and apparated in his mother’s living room, next to the glass door connecting the small house with the garden. “I’m sorry, mother, I got distracted” he sat after softly kissing Narcissa in the forehead. They didn’t live together anymore, but it was their custom to meet every weekday afternoon to have tea and catch up with each other.
The night view of the city was something to look at. Their room was facing the direction of the Red Square, where lights were pointed to the St. Basil’s cathedral, making the colors vibrate. The city was active; people would come and go, wizards amongst muggles and everyone having a great time.
They were received by a statue of a creature, that, if Harry’s memory didn’t fail, was a
“Shut up and keep going, Potter” he snapped and Harry lowered himself until he had access to his neck and started to leave a trace of kisses. He tasted so good “Merlin’s beard, this is torture” Draco was stretching his throat and Harry pressed his teeth against his skin softly before rubbing his beard on it.
After buying a bunch of Ted’s favorites, which cheered the boy up, Harry apparated at Andromeda’s and ran away before the witch could murder him for buying the kid so much sugar, apparating back home and starting to put the groceries in its place and getting what he needed for lunch.
Why would Harry keep those things in there? Why would he have something so dangerous in his house?
“You are Grigori Rasputin” Shestakov affirmed.
He sat down in the chair next to the bed and grabbed a couple books and the bag of cookies from his case, handing Malfoy one of the tomes and offering the sweet biscuits.
“Move, Harry, please” the brunet growled again and started going in and out at a maddening pace. Draco held Harry’s neck and drew his face closer. He kissed him deeply before whispering his thoughts right in his ear “I’m not going to break, love” And that was it. Harry started to thrust harder and faster and Draco buried his nails in his lover’s back. Harry shifted his position slightly, focused, like looking for something until he hit a spot inside Draco that had him crying out of pleasure.
“He is Voldemort” Draco’s eyes opened impossibly and Harry had to control himself not to laugh. Luckily, the blond composed soon enough, realization spreading over his features.
He saw a light and his hair moved. It was chilly, but everything in that country had been cold so far. Except Harry, Harry was always warm.
“And what’s your excuse, Ginny?” Harry’s voice took him by surprise. His boyfriend had wrapped an arm around his waist and held a glass of wine in the other hand.
“What is it?” not losing time with his hair but adjusting his white coat a little, he made his way to the door of the resting room, followed by the tiny girl.
“You haven’t asked any”
“What for?”
“I’m scared” he said finally “I can understand why do you need to put a name to it, but I’m worried about not being able to play the part” he stopped “You know what I mean” he did. Probably. But he still needed an answer. Harry sighed and pulled his hair back with a hand. The other one holding Draco’s “I’m a terrible boyfriend, Draco. I’m always busy, I’m clumsy and forgetful. I’m overprotective and possessive enough to be a problem. I hate sharing but I suck at being what someone else needs, I doubt I can even get close to what you deserve” Draco was too emotional. He could feel his magic tremble, but he let Harry continue “But I want to try. I want to be with you, formally and openly, as long you want me” the Gryffindor cheeks were bright red, but he was looking straight at Draco’s eyes, bravery all around.
The bedside table was full of potion vials and ointment containers, bandages, tonics and towels. The wand he had returned to the Slytherin, rested beside a cold cup of tea.
and opening the book.
“I’m afraid a portrait’s vision is a little limited, Draco. I can only assure you he is not here” not helpful.
Harry heard it three times before leaving the room. He had no idea what it meant but he had the feeling it was the answer to all his problems. He also knew, somehow, that the prophecy had nothing to do with Rasputin, who had probably had no idea what he was talking about, like most seers, when he spoke it, and everything to do with Alexei, and therefore, Draco.
When Harry stepped out of the chimney with his best friend, he didn’t expect Draco to be waiting for them. He was dressed in a soft-green shirt and some comfy pants that he had probable chose so they didn’t rub against his wound.
“Yes. Very nice to meet you, Kreacher”
“No, it’s dangerous, mom. Believe me” he said shivering at the memory of Pansy’s care once he had had the flu. He preferred Potter, he totally did.
Just the epilogue to go!!!
“I hope is not the Romanov boy” he said while adjusting his clothes “He is not coming back” he knew Alexei was gone. That has been the whole point of coming here, but the way he said it upset Harry.
“Brilliant! Can you please tell that to my mother? She won’t believe me even under
“Aw, are you worried about me, Harry?” Malfoy was battering his eyelashes and Harry had trouble passing his food, almost choking.
He was little, but not dumb. He knew his sisters used to hide in the easiest places when he was the one looking. They didn’t want him to get hurt. Always protecting him. He was the heir of the Russian crown, the tsarevich of the empire.
“Awesome, can I help?”
“Shhh…don’t cry, Draco, please” he hadn’t noticed he was.
“I guess this is all too unknown to make sense” they entered the sauna which was empty “He cannot see what you see, and I guess he can feel you because of our spell. He would be a silent presence if not for that”
Every wall in that house had a painting, but most were empty, just the canvas with a nice landscape, or a chair, or something like that, only a couple were still present and moving. There were also empty spots, places where most definitely a frame had been once. Draco could imagine the reason. The portraits of his ancestors were probably not really polite with the new owner of the house; the image of his aunt yelling at Potter every time he went to get a glass of water was actually very disturbing, so she was, no doubt, one of the missing frames.
“You don’t get away with language just because I was worried, young man” Draco was almost insulted, and looked in Harry’s way looking for support, but found the wizard’s shoulders shaking with laughter.
“How does it work?” he asked, touching his skin very lightly. The ink had been absorbed. He wondered if this was a permanent thing, but decided to ask about it later.
“Oui?”
“Oh, can you blame me? I get extremely cranky when I talk to Blaise. That man drives me crazy with that
“Yes. That’s me” he was expecting some kind of rejection from the boy, but all he got was a big, bright smile and a change from blue to blond hair.
They continued their way through the muggle village. Harry usually found himself more comfortable doing his shopping in muggle stores and Teddy enjoyed the trip as much as he did. The boy had a taste for muggle candy, he stated that the flavors were normal and agreeable, unlike the ones in the Bertie Botts’ beans. He paid for the blueberries and put them in the bag before checking the time.
“Harry, what’s wrong? You are pale” he stood up and accioed the briefcase with his medical material.
“Of course they are, Draco. Stop thinking stupid things, you are just tired” he told to himself before making his way back to the bedroom and putting on his sleep-clothes.
Draco woke up before his boyfriend, who was still holding him. He had probably slept less than six hours on the last three days, he had to be exhausted, doctor or not. He made a little funny noise, and moved his nose where a strand of hair was tickling him. Draco smiled and stroked the hair out of his face, unfortunately, waking him up. He was about to apologize when Harry smiled, stretched and said in an impossibly sexy, husky voice “Hey, beautiful” and Draco melted again.
The sight was…shocking, to say the least. The contrast between the sheets and the white skin and blond hair should have been deceiving, but it was obvious that Draco was paler than usual; his body covered in bruising, some older than others, and even in his sleep he was visibly in pain.
Did he? He resented his father and yet he loved him deeply, but, did he want to go back? Could they really find another way to help Alexei and himself?
Maybe he had helped a little bit after all.
“And still, you keep challenging me. It’s about time you learn not to dare your mother”
Harry was almost certain that the answers they were looking had everything to do with Rasputin, so he wrote down the information he had and went looking for Draco. He found him sited on a couch, surrounded by books, his posture indicating he was still struggling with his back pain. Maybe the motorcycle had been too much.
“I never thought I would say this, but Harry is a genius”
There was something really disturbing in seeing Malfoy like that; so weak and vulnerable. It didn’t bring back especially pleasant memories, but over everything else, it felt wrong to Harry, wrong and unfair. He knew about Draco’s life since he had business with one of his friends, Blaise Zabini, who provided most of the equipment for his experiments. He knew the blond had been working as a wand maker and had even seen some of his creations while treating a German teenager who had suffer from a mutation of Spattergroit and was not responding to regular treatment. He knew his former classmate was doing great on his own after everything, and he completely understood the need of running away from England, even if it was a really difficult decision.
“I could use a shower; do you think I can manage that without hurting myself?” he didn’t know how to deal with stitches or even if he could stand, but he was craving hot water and soap.
The veil moved in that moment and they both looked in that direction.
“If father knew about this he would have a stroke” horror crossed his mother’s face for a second.
His father was distressed; he could see that. And his mother? Well, she had never been the same after Father Grigori had died. He hadn’t either, his knees were swollen and he had no one to heal them. He was scared of falling, of going out, of playing with his sister…yes, sister, Ana was the only one that still played with him. The others were too busy growing up.
Draco was running to him. They hugged. Draco was back in his arms. Soft skin, beautiful gray eyes, it was him. Really him.
“Don’t be an idiot, Malfoy. You just wanted to get your eyes on your precious house-founder’s life” Draco gasped “You are not there, prince” Harry was not looking at him, but he knew Draco had rolled his eyes.
“Well, I guess I’ll trust his judgment. Surely it’s better than yours” they took a table in the corner and after ordering some light lunch they both got their notes out and started to revise them “So, we agree that this Rasputin fella had something fishy going on” Draco said after some minutes while stroking a white kitten that had made her way to his lap. Harry thought he would make a fuss about having hair in his designer trousers but he seemed just fine with it.
He needed to find a way of boosting the stranger’s soul so he could communicate without Draco being unconscious or damaged. A catalyst agent of sorts. He didn’t know about anything like that, but there was always a first time.
“Nothing too flashy, for two, please” the man moved his eyes to Draco briefly and nodded.
“What the hell is that and why should it be because of dark magic?” he looked confused so Harry started explaining the situation.
“I think we should go too” Ron said patting Harry in the back “I will need you help convincing Mione to stop working before she starts labor on duty again”
Two down, one to go. He looked in every imaginable place. Even the trees, where she would hide if it was any other person looking. He huffed, frustrated, about to give up when he saw his mother smile, amused.
“What?” he had to have misheard the other man, definitely.
“I know, Draco, but this is complicated and even if I know that this is your way of dealing with the situation…” he stopped, he had to control his temper. Draco was his patient and he was the one in the most delicate position “I’m sorry. I need a minute” he went back to his own room and opened the window; the sun was setting already and the chamber was showered by a beautiful orange light.
He woke up screaming. When had he fallen sleep? What time was it? His throat was dry and his eyes were so clouded with tears that he couldn’t see a thing.
They pressed the play button and the film started. It was something about fashion. He had figure that much. There was a messy girl dressed like an elf and a fancy lady that reminded him of his mother somehow. Narcissa wasn’t so nasty, but the vibe was the same.
“We were hugging” he said simply, praying to Merlin that he wouldn’t ask any further.
“Please, tell me our hotel is behind this one” he said to Ellias who grinned maliciously at them.
“We’ll go over it when you have had some glucose in your system and I’m sure it’ll be fine. You have been right so far, haven’t you?” they finished and went down to the kitchen where between jokes and teasing they both left the bad thoughts behind.
“Thanks. That’s helpful, believe it or not” it was, Harry just didn’t know why at the time “You are strangely calm today. The usual would be for you to be running around and probably hurting yourself. Not complaining, just saying”
“Yes, she wrote to me this morning, I should have told you before”
“Draco, babe, they are about to arrive. Could you please come down here before I lose my mind and end up burning something?” he laughed. Harry could be so dramatic. All they needed was wine. Lots and lots of wine. That was it. Everyone was happier with wine.
“But it makes no sense!”
When they parted, Harry smiled widely and Draco asked himself if generally hurt to be so happy.
“You better don’t be fooling around, Potter” he managed to say with what he believed was a threatening tone. He could be singing and he wouldn’t notice, but he had to try.
“I did not, but if he was I know how to confirm it” the man looked around and got closer to Harry “I am trusting you with valuable information, my boy. This is one of the most guarded secrets of this school and that is saying something. You must promise me that you would never speak a word about it with anyone; not even Mr. Malfoy” Harry knew the old man was not referring to some empty oath; he was asking for something more secure and definitive.
Molly came from the kitchen with the dishes Harry had made floating behind her and Draco let his disturbing thoughts on a corner of his mind.
“Do you have an appointment?” Draco raised an eyebrow. The boy couldn’t keep his eyes from him “Name?” he asked and Draco rolled his eyes and moved his head in Harry’s direction.
The best thing about the girl was his boyfriend, who had a pair of beautiful eyes that would be the perfect mixture of his and Harry’s. Greenish-gray. He wondered for a moment if their kids would have gotten that mixed color of just one or the other. He realized where his train of thoughts was going and shook his head.
“Is something supposed to happen?” he asked looking how his reflection was the same as always, plus black ink.
“Where is Harry?” Lucius asked. He had grown rather fond of his healer, well, all the family had, to be honest.
“Draco, I need you to be really honest with me now” he nodded “Have you been in touch with dark magic?”
“Oh, Draco, honey, you are awake. How are you feeling?”
“When I started studding here, I was curious about many branches of magic. Dark Arts can be a fascinating subject if you use them correctly, but even in that world there are certain thing one must not tamper with” Harry knew a thing or two about that. He had fought a lunatic that had gone too deep and too far into the Dark Arts and lost his sanity and many lives on the way “I found out, in this same library, that there were subjects, currently forbidden in the school, that had once been part of the curriculum. One of them was Soul Magic” Harry had no plans of interrupting Alexander so he let him continue the story “I asked why to one of my professors and the answer was that some student had involved with taboo things and the school had decided to take the subject off the study plan to avoid temptations. Years later I learned that that student was no other than Grigori Rasputin, the infamous wizard that ruined the Russian royal family”
“That’s nice. Are they still together?” that he knew, since Pansy had told him not long ago, but he refused to let Potter know how they gossiped about the golden trio every now and then.
“You know what?” Draco said after giving up his fight with the tie “You look too formal” he threw it on the bed and unbuttoned Harry’s shirt a little bit “That’s better”
They walked the path the man had pointed. The tip of a cross could be seen over the trees and as soon as they passed the vegetation they found themselves face to face with a static bronze statue of a family. A man was in the middle, between a lady and a teenage girl, and on the back of the monument, a couple steps up, there were three other girls around different ages. It was beautiful. Harry had little information on the assassination of the royal family but he knew it had been awful and that was a beautiful place to be remembered, but both their attentions were locked in a single thing: the little boy cuddled in his father’s arms. He was so small, he was so real, so near. Alexei had a face for them now, a body, he was no longer an intrusive voice inside Draco. The poor boy had died too early and he had not even been able to rest with his family, trapped in some kind of spell that had kept him wandering for years, only to wake up in some foreign world all by his own.
As he polished the ash wand between his fingers, stroking it slightly with his magic, he discarded one more time the thought of not being alone, at the same time a little house elf appeared, distracting him from his task.
“That’s actually a very good idea” Draco rolled his eyes.
“He is gone, Harry. Thanks to you, actually. This is not like that. I just need to get the boy free and I’ll be okay” Harry was still not looking at him.
“Not a morning person, are you?” he said joking since the man had not said any complex sentence.
“All right, Potter. Let’s see if you can really do something with that brain of yours” he wasn’t going to give in so easily “I’m confident my mother told you everything so far, and you have already seen my bruises, and touch them even, so, what do think?”
Draco came back to his mind. The man had been through hell yesterday and he still hadn’t panicked when Harry had told him about his theories. The memory of Draco’s scarred body had shaken him; he should be used to it by now, but something was different this time. Maybe the circumstances, maybe the patient, maybe it was just himself, Harry didn’t know, but he was sure he had to solve it. He summoned his cellphone, buried in one of his white coat’s pockets and made the call to the hospital. He had some vacations saved, since he hadn’t use any of his free days since he had started working there, so he asked for a month off; he knew he was going to be extra-busy with research and he needed time to take care of Draco’s situation.
The runes were around the base of his neck, where Harry had told him he had found his soul, and where he had felt it himself. It couldn’t have been easy to be precise in such an irregular surface but they looked almost perfect. Potter had done a great job.
, he chides himself.
“Wonderful! Tomorrow, I’ll pick up Teddy at Molly’s, and we’ll go to the grocer’s together. He does still love riding that cart, doesn’t he?”. Harry groaned regretfully.
Given his status, Lawrence seemed invisible to purebloods; they deemed him so unworthy of attention, that they never paid heed to what might be learned with tiny voice recorders and muggle technology. After all, what could a Squib do, really? Especially one so young, so guileless, so enamored with magic… all fake, of course.
“I have not!” Hermione defended herself.
anything.
The mood inside was still frantic, although they had obviously managed to hook Teddy up to an IV. Someone was mixing potions in a portable emergency cauldron next to the IV setup, another Healer was standing next to Teddy’s head, hands stretched out over him and mumbling spellwork under his breath. Teddy was still conscious. His anxious eyes were looking at him pleadingly, tears leaking from the corners, and Harry felt like someone had just stabbed him. His magic was still obviously out of control; his skincolour was constantly changing, looking like it was literally crawling over him. Some of the colours and textures weren’t even remotely human-looking. It was a disconcerting sight.
Potter glared at him. “See, da-Harry, mister doesn’t mind, do you mister? ”
The article goes on, writing in bold things like “expectations of a
Goldenrod:   Encouragement
“Hello, Potter” he nods. Ever polite, Harry thinks, and grunts back in greeting, navigating Teddy up the steps, who mumbles incomprehensibly. For a moment, he’s annoyed that Malfoy’s not helping him get Teddy up the steps to the front door, but then remembers Malfoy is already carrying a grocery bag, also ostensibly to help them. This prickles Harry even further as he opens the door and stumbles in with Teddy. Malfoy follows him silently, and puts down the bag on the little spindly legged console table in the hallway, and then, as if he’s somehow known what Harry was thinking, reaches out to hoist Teddy up with him.
Yes, his mother was definitely planning something. He would figure it out, and soon. He didn’t truly believe her when she had promised him not to set him up anymore. Perhaps he ought to watch the guest list of the function, keep an eye out for any pureblood girls in attendance. And avoid them like the plague.
“But-” he started, lip wobbling again. At this, Harry couldn’t stand it anymore, and leaned over to hug his godson again.
“Ah yes. Ahem. Do I need to
“Why would it be dirty?” asks Teddy, all innocent confusion “You better not steal my Slime-Buckets, dad”. Harry groans again. Oh my god, Malfoy is such a bad influence.
“Maybe it’s Neville?”

The Ministry was all aflutter with rumours, but he strode through the hallways with his chin tilted up, a little sneer on his face. ‘Let them talk’, he thought. He forced himself to walk slowly, with dignity, and not
Marcus looks between Malfoy, who’s enchanted the dough to keep rolling itself, and Harry, who’s defensively crossed his arms, but for all intents and purposes, has put his body between Malfoy and Marcus.
“You help me with homework, and you make rules, and you take me everywhere, and you help me control my magic and-” Harry held up a hand.
“You have chosen excellent witches, mother”. Tippy brings in the next course, quiche with green asparagus, and they fall silent once more, eating in small bites.
“Hmm, how thoughtful of you.” He answers, although it doesn’t sound all that sincere. He walks further in the hallway, and before Harry can stop him, he steps into the kitchen. Harry inwardly braces himself.
“Ah, a flower delivery boy, how wonderful.” Harry huffed.
“Well, I see nothing’s changed here, then.” He murmered, smiling a little at Harry. “No time to redecorate, even after quitting?” he asks, winking.
“The epitome of care, indeed” mutters Malfoy under his breath. That fast, Marcus is on him again, pressing him against the counter.
Harry let her chatter on about florists, and dear old Dick, and tried to collect himself. She didn't seem to mind that he wasn't listening. Had Marcus already forgotten about him? There were still some clothes and toiletries of his in Grimmauld Place. Harry had held on to them, thinking that if he kept them, Marcus might still change his mind. He wouldn’t admit it to anyone, but he had opened Marcus’ hair potion and smelled it surreptiously when he was in the bathroom sometimes. And while he hadn’t heard anything back and all his owls had returned with his letters unopened, he hadn’t thought he could be
“Oh! Well, they were fascinating really, I combined them with Belamy’s Numerological Theorem and the results….” She prattered on, and Draco nodded, noticing small things about the report, her research methods, and her. He by now knew she was the youngest child of five, a wizarding family, not pureblood. She had a quiet ambition, but not enough self-esteem or some Slytherin arrogance to back it up –yet, he thought. Her clothes betrayed a sense of frugality, as did her packed lunches, which he knew she took with Madam Beauregard, their Legal Council.
There only one solution this his embarassement; he sneers at him. Harry smirks back.
“For what, mrs. Picklewilly?” she put down her cup a bit heavier than usual, and it clunked against the china
“Yes, until then” he replied. Harry walked out to the hallway, where Hermione and Ron walked already with Teddy inbetween them, looking for all everyone knew like the perfect family. He caught up to them. “Let’s have pancakes for dinner, yeah?” and they went home.
Tea made, they settle down, the door closed. Hermione’s brown eyes peer at him, sharply. Draco rolls his eyes. “Don’t worry about me, nothing’s happened yet” he says. Hermione presses her lips together, and eyes him over critically. He straightens beneath her scrutiny.“Madam Beauregard came to talk to me this morning. ” she starts, voice serious. Draco crosses his legs, feigns nonchalance, and raises an eyebrow. “It will influence our bill, if your father is reinstated, Draco. He’ll regain his seat in the Wizengamot, for the duration of his trial”.
“Yes, Potter?”
brain-child.
It feels like a short chapter; nothing much happens. But Draco gets inside the door, and that matters to everyone, doesn't it?
“See! This is why you deserve this mail! Already trying to buy your way out of it!” the Mailwizard growls at him. Draco takes a step back, lest the spittle hit him in the face. Which would add nicely to the pile of mail about his person, of course. This day was
“It’s Draco, I was here a few days ago.”
“Well spotted, Potter.” He straightens up, strokes the snitches on his waistcoat. “She doesn’t enjoy the way I dress to dinner, no. But it’s not that.” He says quietly. No, it wasn’t just the muggle suits in bright colours he took to wearing to family dinner every Thursday, although it definitely annoyed mother. Harry had finished binding the flowers together, fluffing the leaves a bit. This time, it had to do with him rejecting yet another potential bethrothed.
, please”. The voice sounded vaguely familiar, but most definitely annoyed and short, if not utterly polite in its words. Harry grunted and straightened himself up, hoping this new customer wouldn’t mind all the scattered dried herbs still on the floor, and all over his clothes. The smell of Neville’s magically enhanced lavender was nearly overwhelming, and he felt his nose itch.
“Seriously though, don’t start stealing flowers. Neville will go out of business, you arse”. A wonderfully melodious laugh erupts in the air, and Harry is rather startled by it. He looks almost fond, his causal smirk almost a smile now.
He wasn’t yet ready to give up. He hadn’t given up when he was living under Voldemort, suffered through the fall of his family’s name, and this trick of his father was just another little cherry on top of the shit-cake that was post-war Malfoy life. He could deal. He mentally tallied the list of things he needed to do, and took a deep breath. He straightened his spine, looked himself in the eye, and apparated to the Ministry apparition point.
“Dear, I hear wonderful things about the work you and miss Granger do at your department. I wish you would tell me more about it.’’ Draco fought not to raise an eyebrow, and sipped his tea slowly. Too sweet, and already tepid. Knowing very well his mother only liked his job insofar as it improved their family name, he knew his mother bringing it up must serve another purpose.
He took four stems of striped Amaryllis, a bunch of white, fragrant Stock, and some just-in Ranunculus^^, which, Harry had discovered, liked some stroking to keep their heads from drooping. No drooping in sight however, as Malfoy gathered them together, and brought them to the counter. Harry followed him, and started the process of binding them.
“These will do, Potter”, Malfoy stated, spreading the flowers out on the counter.
“Time for your potion, Ted”. Draco tries not to shudder at the utmost gentle tone in Potters voice. Teddy buries his face in Potters chest, looking reluctant but resigned. Potter strokes his head again, and gets up to get the blue bottle he had directed Draco to last time. Draco meanwhile starts cleanup, leaving Teddy be.
Entering Hermione’s office, he found her being served tea by Jasmin before they all took seats. He quickly looked her over, and though she looked good, he could see that she was worried. Her curly hair wasn’t as well conditioned, and she had small lines of strain next to her mouth, as if she had clenched her jaw a lot. Hmm. Better ask about it, then. But later, after Jasmin had left. “Let’s start”, he prompted, and let Jasmin take the lead.
“But he’s a liar, isn’t he?” He croaks out.
Or, in other words; go check on the other last living Black heir, Draco dear, and soon. “Remember our family traditions”, ha. Stick your nose in the air, maybe get on the wrong side of the war, sure. Acknowledging half-bloods in the family, that was usually a step too far. Unless that family is dying off and your son is too gay to carry on the line; then it becomes acceptable to seek out ‘tainted blood’.
“Really? Because it looks like I’m here buying my mother flowers, and you’re here…. to… what did we decide on?” a light smirk played on his lips. Harry met those glittering, amused eyes.
“Harry dear, I’m so sorry about the news!” mrs. Picklewilly greeted him when he stepped outside of the shop to clear their front. Dustpan in hand –magic never seemed to work on some of the petals the hanging plants were leaving behind on the front step, he turned around.
(See the end of the chapter for
He grinned a little at her. “Teddy knows how to use them. Don’t waste your energy on a Patronus.”
“None of your business, Belby” Malfoy cuts in sharply, before Harry can get in a word.
“Just because
. Whatever, he tells himself. He definitely doesn’t notice how good he looks, how it accentuates his jawline. He does NOT think Potter is hot. Definitely not. He feels himself colour, and hates it.
Harry took Teddy up for a wash before bed, and when he came down to the sitting room, he saw Andromeda on the blue velvet couch, nearly nodding off. Gently, he approached her and shook her arm.
“Oi! You told me yourself just last Thursday, remember?” he countered indignantly.
Hermione laughed again, “You know sweetheart, I bet she will”. Teddy grinned, looking satisfied.
“You tell me, I’m not a potioneer”.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco’s temper flared in distate, and he looked up again at Potter. Potter, who was quietly ringing up his mother’s bouquet. He took in the disheveled hair, the dark smudges under his eyes, the tight set of his jaw. The wrinkled muggle style henley, stained with soot and dirt. Maybe not completely unaffected, then.
Draco accepts Hermione's proposal, and gets her permission. Even if she doesn't exactly know what she's agreeing to entirely. A little Draco-Teddy bonding.

, of all people. At this point he was glad Neville and Hannah were preoccupied so he didn’t have them worrying over him, too. Really, it wasn’t like he looked
Andromeda’s dark eyes took him in sharply. “I’ve no doubt you will be, Harry.”
He briefly wonders if Potter’s godson, his cousin, has learned it; if Potter knows it.
“A plan for what, mrs. Picklewilly?”
“Let me see!” and Malfoy finally hands him the paper which read:
Draco nodded, grateful for the change in subject. “Yes, please”. Potter bend over to rummage around in the drawers of the counter, and got out a small selection of cards. Draco selected one with silver edging, and Potter snorted. Draco shrugged.
“I happen to have visited some of their residences as a child, actually.” Draco could practically see Lawrence tucking this interesting tidbit somewhere in his remarkable brain. Lawrence didn’t write anything down that Draco told him. He had an incredibly precise memory; notebooks were only reserved for uni work, not the idle jobs that Draco gave him. He’d remember the names he gave him, and all the little nuggets of overheard conversation –often verbatim, and secret dealings.
“I am so, so happy for you”. Harry said, quietly, while Teddy started shrieking about how stupid girls were, except for maybe Victoire. Harry went to get a cloth for the spilt juice, but Hermione gestured him to sit down. “No worries, I got it!”. She waved her wand, and the juice was cleared, even if the table cloth was now smoking slightly. “I’ve been brushing up on my household spells, you know.” Harry chuckled. “Of course you have”. He winked at her.
, for other people to have a better chance. For the fucking war not to kill them all in other ways, even after it ended.
“Eh, no?” Potter seemed to ask him. Suddenly, there came a young voice from behind.
“Little Lord to Lose all to Death-Eater Father” It started, on the front page. He skips the parts about his father’s actions, already knowing what he was convicted for, all the crimes he committed. He had been there for most of it, after all, and had been present too, in court. He quickly finds his own name, just below the fold. Thank Salazar for small mercies, at least.
dad!”. Harry ceded the point.
like this colour on you, Granger. And please stop fussing.” Draco was sitting, long legs crossed in front of him, in
The Wizengamot has ruled. Draco finally gets someone in his corner, and he finds out about his mother's friend Jane.
“Do you have kids?”. The Healer looked a bit taken aback, but nodded. Harry glanced at the man. Surely, he was only a little older than Harry. He wasn’t wearing a wedding ring. “My daughter is three” He said, a bit curt.
“Not for Potter, you know. But because of our bill.” Her brown eyes held his for a moment.
“She can be very convincing, in my experience.” Hermione frowns. “Mrs. Picklewilly happens to have lunch and tea with Potter, regularly. She talked him into actually going to the single parent club, when he spoke to her about it. She told me herself she did”. Hermione frowns at him.
Harry insisted Ron was cheating, having Molly’s recipes when he wanted them, but their current attempt was a favourite recipe of Mrs. Picklewilly, and he had utter faith in her. She was beyond picky with the preserves and pickles she sold, so she must know a thing or two about cake –or banana bread, in this case. If this failed, he would ask Hannah, who had surprised him with excellent blueberry crumble last week in Neville’s shop.
“Do you want me to move the meeting?” he offered. It would push things back a bit, but he could.
Finishing with the Aloe, he sets it aside, and turns to the Fanged Geraniums. They were rather temperamental, but always a favourite. He frowns a little as he mulls over the last part of her letter. He hadn’t attended many public events lately, rather, not any. Not since… well. He couldn’t really see why this one was more important than all the other ones, even if he knew Hermione was cooking up a grand plan or other. He licks his lips. Mrs. Picklewilly had also said something to the effect he should attend; he even felt like he had been lulled into a promise of some sort, even if he couldn’t remember it properly. He sighs. If he were to go, he definitely didn’t want to go alone. Neither was it attractive to take whomever Mrs. Picklewilly set him up with; most likely one of her many pureblood cousins who would either bore him to tears or be awestruck all night and fawning over him. Maybe he should bring someone more neutral… someone not out to play a game with him. Perhaps he could persuade Healer Lindsay –Rowan, to come? Harry frowns a little. Would that be weird? He's Teddy’s healer, after all. Then again, they’d gotten more amicable during the single parents support group, and had even had coffee after one of the meetings last week. Harry felt himself blush a little. Maybe he should-
“Haz, I’m sooooo hungry! Can we eat
“Because children and their parental figures have different, complex relationships. And, if it helps him not having panic attacks or related symptoms, why not try it?” the Healer asked him kindly.
Harry face split in a grin at least as wide as Malfoy’s next to him, who was all aflutter, making more tea. His chest ached. What wonderful news! What he wouldn’t give to be them, in that moment, where everything was new and perfect.
Potter, meanwhile, was sitting quietly at the table, no doubt watching the spectacle Draco was making of his kitchen.

in dealing with it.
“Yes, Parvati and Melany. I’m meeting them later for dinner.”
?”. He had opened the Tupperware box with leftover chicken stew, sniffing it appreciatively. Harry gave him a tired smile.
“Am I to understand that Potter is upstairs covered in slime?” he manages, before a laugh escapes him. Teddy smile is pure satisfaction.
. He rushed down, shoes making loud noises on the wooden stairs. Potter got a spoon and filled a measure.
“Didn’t know you’d be so fond of Muggle expletives, Potter” he says drily, and takes out a bag of chickpea flower. He rolls up his sleeves in short little tugs, and all of a sudden, his forearms are bare and Harry sees
“Well then, I cannot but notice that this season alone you have rejected both the Greengass girl and the Rosewood girl. Both excellent matches, if I may say so myself.” He feels his mother’s burning gaze on his face, and wills himself not to blush. His cheeks are doomed today.
A spicy scent was wafting in from the kitchen, and it snapped him back to reality.
Ranunculus:  Radiant, charming
Thank you for reading this beast! I will try to be a more considerate writer in the future, and hope to make it feel less forced/rushed.
“Thank Godric” and jumped up to get himself one.
“I’m not opposed to meeting her, if she’s agreeable” Malfoy says rather stiffly, although he winks at Teddy, who’s beaming at him.
Malfoy snorted. “Always am, Potter”.
“Will he be okay?” he asked.
that could compel him to answer? It must be the suit, or whatever was apparently so magnetic about him that even the flowers took notice.
“Well then, I’ll reconsider attending.
“Looking fancy there, Drake”, he whistled, and winked. Draco could feel a twitch in his face at the nickname –he’d tried to get Lawrence to stop calling him that, but the more he did, the less it worked. He raised a single shoulder in nonchalance.
Harry closed his mouth, feeling wrong footed after being confronted with

“Sure, kiddo. But then, bedtime!”. Teddy grinned, unrepentant.

The door is closed, which isn’t unusual. Hermione needs quiet to work properly. She used to use silencing and blocking charms, but it made her too hard to reach, even when they were all pulling faces in her doorway and waving around like lunatics in the hallway. He knocks on her door, firmly.
“Is he sick?” Marcus asks in the silence that follows.
“I just
The silence in the hallway is deafening.
Did Malfoy do this on purpose? The note had said ‘
“Do your parents know?” he asked Ron, who shook his head. “We told Mione’s parents yesterday, they were absolutely delighted.” He grinned. Hermione’s parents had been recovered from Australia after the war, and after intensive therapy most of their memory had returned. Whenever having visited Hermione’s parents, Ron was full of delight about the ‘inventiveness of muggles, Harry!’, and their house was now slowly gaining piles of what Hermione called “junk” but what Ron was certain he would get the hang of soon (Harry saw the comparison with Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, but wisely held his tongue). Luckily Hermione’s dad was a patient man, and they had bonded over getting to know how to use an iPhone, which now everyone in the Weasley family –and Harry, carried everywhere, using them with varying degrees of success.
“I don’t want you to forget your parents, you understand? They loved you so much” Harry stated.
First of all, I am extremely sorry this chapter is so very late. You might have guessed it already, but I had a personal health crisis, and all other things had to be put on hold. I somehow, over the last few months managed to pass my defense and graduate. I am recovering, but it's a slow process.
Only then did Draco notice that it was Teddy that was making the table stir; His hair was slowly changing colour and his limbs were shaking.
“But, what he did! It was evil!”. Harry cocks his head. Neville regards them steadily.
Draco got up, straightened his suit.
“Harry! Come quick, it’s Teddy. We need to go to st. Mungo’s immediately!”
“You could tell me, you know”. Hermione looks at him.
“Yes, Potter, how can they ask
“Hmm. Maybe you could check up on them.”
“That… But, you have the Dark Mark! How can they ask
“Thank you, for what you did today. We really needed that, Teddy and I. Dinner with family.”
“Malfoy?” Potter comes up behind him.
Malfoy approached his counter, looking derisively at the display of Sleeping-Sachets –the blasted things did sell well, and they had expanded their range with ‘soothingly singing sachets’.
Draco and Harry have a full conversation, and progress is finally made.
. Potter had swung open the door and blinked in the light, eyes squinting. Had he just woken up, perchance?
. But there is a difference between
“I just wanted to have dinner with you, Lawrence” he says more calmly than he feels. He’s taken off his outer robes, is now in only a thin, uncollared black shirt and what to muggles constituted leggings –traditional wizarding wear, of course- and while more comfortable, he feels too exposed. His summer underclothes are, after all, exceedingly thin and airy.
“What made it smell, was both the thyme and fennel, which, I agree, produce quite the odorous arrangement. However, they symbolize courage and flattery. I like Shelly, and I want him to know I like what he’s doing, now.” He glanced up, finding Potter seemingly mulling this over.
“It is not my private correspondence.” He responded. He batted away a letter with his hand.As soon as his hand touched the letter, he knew he’d made a grave mistake. It exploded with a few sparks, and aside from spilling a sort of nauseating gas, it started shouting:
“The younger, yes. May I come in, Potter?” Draco motioned to step forward, but Potter didn’t move away.
“I know I have, you know, a mother and a father” he continued. A bit hesitant, but persistent. He let his spoon clatter in his empty bowl. Harry flinched a bit, nerves taught.
While there was still a long way to go to expand on the curriculum, it had turned out a success; muggle-born children reported better adaptability in classes that asked for intuitive magic, like potions and transfiguration. Hermione claimed it was due to a better sense of the ‘developing wizarding self’ or some nonsense. She had even gone as far as to introduce two school-counselors to Hogwarts, as an addition to the medical staff. The next step was evening seminars for muggle parents, to better understand their children and the world they were sending them into.
at all.
Malfoy slams it shut with a muttered “Good riddance”.
“Mate, you need to let off with Malfoy” he said, rolling his eyes. But Harry looked at Hermione, eyes narrowed.
“Is he, now? The Potter’s were an old pureblood family, as I’m sure you know. Potter has never been active in taking his seat in the Wizengamot as the heir of both the Potter and Black houses.”
“Well, I’m not talking about the baby.” He probed quietly.
“No use dithering around, I suppose. It is good I am seeing you now, dear”. Draco frowned. What an odd way to start an aquintance.
in this household. He grumbles. It feels nice nonetheless, Teddy rambling to Potter, the kitchen feeling warm and smelling like simple, hearty fare. He catches himself humming and stops just in time to see Potter look up in surprise at him. He smiles deprecatingly, but tells himself to keep his cool. No use getting carried away here, he has a goal! Even if it is all very nice, and homely, and awfully plebeian.
And while Harry had of course gotten him more than the boots –like new barking-crup printed sheets, a bedside light that changed like the moon and howled in the morning, and a sparkling fireworks cake for dessert, he had still loved the boots best. He had tapdanced around the room belting at full volume “I am the realest wizard!” swinging his hips wildly yelling “Look at my swagger!!” twirling around with arms raised, beard trailing in the air behind him. Harry couldn’t just stand there, and instead had waved his wand and put on the gramophone to some ABBA –of course, Teddy’s favourite, and had awkwardly bopped along, grinning from ear to ear.
They had been trying to build a wider network of Non-Magical Members of Wizarding society: Muggle families with Magical children, and Squibs. In the department they all took took turns talking to families, engaging them in conversation. For starters, they wanted to ease the transition from Muggle family life to having children go to Hogwarts, as well as helping to ease the strain of accidental Magic. It was one of their longest running projects, and started with Hermione herself going to people she knew, convincing her parents to help. They too, had felt so out of place, not knowing how to help their daughter. In the reverse, this was happening to Melany and Parvati as well, having a Squib son and wondering how best to help him, love him, when he was going to venture in a world they didn’t know. “Disruptors of public order”
I also want to thank those of you who left comments in the last few weeks, they were wonderful, and helpful too! I admit, I read them repeatedly when I was struggling with my thesis this week, just for encouragement.
The prickling turned out to be a stinging hex. By the time lunch rolls around, he’s disabled three stinging hexes, two knee-reversal spells, a tarantallegra, and a very nasty itching powder, which he’d nearly gotten all over himself. Meanwhile, every half hour or so, more would come in. “This is ridiculous!” he mutters. He couldn’t waste his whole day dealing with mail! He gets up, fixes his hair, and goes up to the department of Mail and Communication.
, and that was rather wonderful.
.’’ He mocks again. Now he had gotten her approval, he could carry on more easily. Wooing Potter to the function, back into politics, all the while re-establishing family ties. It couldn’t possibly be more perfect. He had already planned to drop by the market on his way home.
“Don’t call me that.” He snaps at her, and she rolls her eyes as she steps through, forcing him back inside.
He lights the wall sconces and has just turned back to the sink, satisfied with the warm, low glow, when he hears Potter coming downstairs again.
“You always have a choice, arsehole! What, you’re still talking about this Dark Lord of yours, this Lord-”
Amicus certus in re incerta: a sure friend in uncertain times.
Draco sniffed. “If you
He dredged up a weak smile for Teddy, and got the floo powder from the jar by the fire. “Let’s go, pup”.
“I let many people die for me in the war, so I could continue with my 'mission'.” He starts, and Neville wants to interrupt, but Harry silences him with a held-up hand. He briefly checks the store, and wards it wandlessly. He doesn’t want any misunderstandings about the war, but he also doesn’t want the whole world to overhear him. “I manipulated people to give me what I needed to stop the war, I lied, and tricked”. He states. Lawrence’s eyes are wide. Neville’s mouth is pinched.
“Is that not your name?” he asked calmly. Potter meanwhile was grumpily putting plates in front of them. They had the black family crest on them in the middle, and gold foil trim. Rather lovely, if not a bit formal.
“Good day to your, Mrs..?” He inquired politely, dredging up a small smile.
But as he closed up shop, Neville asked what Harry was smiling about, and he couldn't really answer that question, either.
, just, you know...” he trailed off. Harry took the folder, looked up at the man. Did he imagine the blush that was spreading over the man’s pale skin?
“We’re not making excuses for him, Lawrence” he tries, consolingly.
Andromeda had taken care of Teddy for the first few years, but the war, losing her husband and daughter, had taken much from her. It happened sometimes with Wizarding couples, who were traditionally bonded. One’s magic–and life force-, could fade from the force of a broken heart. Not fatal usually, but the truly bonded would always feel ‘less’. Not even Teddy, cherished as he was, could make up for all that loss and hurt. Last year Luna had taken up room in Andromeda’s house, which Harry knew was a wonderful support. Harry thought Luna’s quirkiness filled the house with whimsy and good energy, without asking anything from Andromeda.
Malfoy puts down his teacup again, and gets up to go to the counter. To resume onion cutting, or some sorts.
seemed to like it fine though. I’m glad”.  Potter rolled his eyes at the weak jab.
Later, lying in his bed, the picture of Potter, white as a sheet and worried looking came to mind. Parenting seemed to come with a lot of that. Worry.
“What are you guys talking about?”
After soup and introductory topics have been passed over, his mother finally comes to the point. “We need to do something about your situation, darling”. She states, dabbing her lips with her napkin. Draco looks at his mother’s stern face. No use trying to pretend he doesn’t know what she’s referring to, then. He sets his spoon down.
If he was going to be a proper dad, he could try to be a better one, at that.
!” he thrusts the paper in Draco’s face again. Draco hadn’t read it, hadn’t wanted to, and his old cowardly self hadn’t even dared, to be frank. He takes it, tries to still his trembling hand. He had been humiliated, hexed, hurt, and laughed at today. He didn’t want to add losing a friend to the list. So he took it, and read it briefly, while Lawrence stood in front of him, ready for a fight.
Sunflowers:  Loyalty
He was served tea in a blue china teaset, decorated with little black swallows. Clearly mrs. Picklewilly was sharper than her flowery looks made her seem. They perfectly matched the little black swallows embroidered on his blue waistcoat. Not just a batty old lady, then.
Mr. Picklewilly had passed away seven years prior, but “dear old Dick” was still a regular topic of many a conversation with Mrs. Picklewilly. While always good to listen to for the latest gossip on Diagon –she was close friends with Mrs. McCarthy from ‘Eye of Newt Apothecary’ on the other end of Diagon Alley, who always had the freshest gossip, and they subsequently always knew the goings on of most of Diagon-, when she got to talking about her no-good daughter in law, or worse, “that sad business with your latest beau”, he couldn’t wait to get back in Neville’s shop.
“Come here, Ted” he said softly .Teddy walked into his outstretched arms, stood between his legs. They were eye to eye, and he stroked the brown hair on
up, Draco”. He swings his legs around the bed, and gets up.
We learn a bit more about floriography, and there is a terrible emergency.
After turning the doorsign to 'open', he flicked his wand towards the lights to switch them on, emitting a soft glow on the shelves. He made himself a cup of fresh tea, then proceeded to the till to start on inventory. There were some new herbal scent-sachets to aid in sleep. Wryly he wondered if he should try them, although he didn’t quite fancy having a frilly pink sachet hanging over his headboard. Furthermore, since Kreacher had died Grimmauld Place sometimes showed unpredictable magic to foreign objects -especially non-magical things. It would be exactly his luck to have the house turn the pink frilly sachets into a choking pillow, or something. Generally the idea was to hang them near the bed and it would lull the user into a dreamless slumber, without the need for potions. They claimed to be a kid-safe alternative for Dreamless Sleep. According to Hannah, all the new moms had them hanging above their baby’s cribs. She figured if the witches from her maternity class would buy them, they might as well sell them.
He had heard from the Ministry gossip-mill that Hermione had sent the other interviewers away ten minutes after Malfoy’d entered for his interview, and then locked and warded the room. No one exactly knew what had occurred, but take-out had been delivered, nearly a whole night had passed, and they had emerged in the wee hours of the morning, looking red eyed and worse for wear. Malfoy had been hired on the spot, and
His mother launches into another conversation, about some Janine Livingstone, who apparently married some shop owner called “Picklewilly” –talk about ridiculous names, really, who are they kidding? – who wrote to her after all these years with the most
People recognizing him on the street wasn’t unusal, but the ones who wished him well were still quite few. He preferred not to have confrontations out in broad daylight. He peered at the source of the voice, and saw a rather harmless-looking elderly lady in flowery robes standing in the doorway of “Pot, Kettle, Pickle”, the crockery shop across the street. She tapped her foot impatiently.
Silence fell again, filled with awkwardness. He wondered if Potter was remembering his abrupt departure previously. He cleared his throat, and resisted the urge to comb a hand through is hair. Potter was obviously looking around for something to say.
“Malfoy!? What are you doing here? Again?”. Harry caught Neville’s eye, who shrugged and quickly disappeared in the back of the shop, murmering about “checking the flaming fungi”. Harry snorted, and turned to really
“Well, all purebloods learn Latin growing up. It’s a means of communicating more than just plain words. I like to beat them at their own game. Although Shelly isn’t in the pureblood faction, he will have appreciated this particular one.”
Hermione sighed. “Well, I can’t say I’m not concerned, really. Teddy should be fine in a few weeks, but then I’m sure we should be looking into how he can be so frightened by a Boggart, and how his magic is apparently so out of control, which probably has to do with the war, so I think perhaps a Mind Healer, but then-”
“Perfect.” She took the last sip from her glass, and stood up. “I’ll see you tomorrow then, Harry.”
‘‘You know,
“That is so cool!!! Is it a boy? Can I play dragon-chase with him? When can I meet him?” he started asking, gaining in enthusiasm , more awake than he had been before then. His hair was starting to curl in his excitement. Harry laughed at him.
“Lucius Malfoy has filed for retrial, apparently”. She states, voice serious. Harry tries very hard not to spill his tea, and fails.
“Ehm, can I help you with something?” he probed, gentling his tone while he bent over to get a cloth for his bleeding hand. The youth grunted, but approached the counter.
“You know you are my family, yeah?” he started, still unsure. Teddy blinked at him, and nodded.
Thursday came without delivery orders, but delivered a Malfoy to the door. He stepped in elegantly through the door just after noon, clad impeccably in yet another three piece suit: A dark, nearly black violet, only betraying colour when caught in the light. His silver embroidered waistcoat was decorated with intricate curlicues, and a silver chain must hide another pocket-watch in his pocket; his cravat was a silvery silk. Gleaming black shoes completed the ensemble. Harry’s eyes traveled upwards to Malfoy’s face, whose eyes were intent on Harry’s. Harry hoped he wasn’t blushing –caught staring (appreciatively) at Malfoy, of all people, was not something he wanted him to know. Malfoy gave a quiet cough.
“I’m fine, you know. It saves me having to shave twice a day, and it’s not like Neville cares.” He sat down, and poured himself some tea. He briefly wondered how often he had said he was 'fine' to them in the past three weeks. A heavy silence fell over the table, only broken by Ron's munching and Teddy's occasional hums. Hermione cleared her throat.
“She’s trying to set me up, you know. Meddlesome, I call it.”
He greeted the waitress and they sat down, Lawrence to a frankly frighteningly large tuna-mayo sandwich, Draco to some peppermint tea. He waited until he had finished at least half of it, before starting their conversation.
The arrangement for the Patils was:
“Sorry Ted, did we wake you?” he says, gently, although not moving. Teddy nods, and tenses a bit when he sees who else is in the room.
“Why keep wearing them, then?” he pried, unable to stop himself.
“Wait, framed?” Neville asks, clearly amused. Lawrence shrugs, smiles a little for the first time.
Harry’s mind is spinning, and he rubs his chest with a rough hand. He’s not entirely sure he wants to hear the rest of this. He’s done his job. Every Squib deserves to know the truth of the war, and to be sure of their place in this new world. His job was done. Still, he’s unable to move his legs to stand up and leave.

“Having Potter on my side wouldn’t help me convince them. He’s a symbol of reform.”
him, wanted him to have a future. And had died fighting for that.
“He worked to gain first my forgiveness, then my trust, and then my friendship, Lawrence. I didn’t make it easy on him, believe me”. He answers calmly. Harry holds back a snort. Neville was still kinder than most, even if he had some sort of a weird friendship with Malfoy. Then again, he didn’t understand how Ron could stand him, but he did as well. Had family dinners with him, even. Lawrence turns to Harry.

His secretkeeping and attempts to distance himself from his past might even make him lose a friend.
“Do be more specific, Draco.” Her tone was a bit sharp. Hermione lost her patience when she was tired, he knew.
He tries to keep from spluttering, grasping for an answer.
to his little office in his department. Madam Beauregard nodded at him steadily seeing him arrive, and gave him one of her little smiles. “Good morning, Lord Malfoy” she said, addressing him by his title for the first time. He gave her a sharp smile. “Good morning, Madam Beauregard.” And he knew he had her support, from that alone. She lifted her wand casually, and all the papers on everyone’s desk –each one headlined with “Little Lord to Lose all to Death-Eater Father” were lifted in the air, and burned with a little puff. “No time for gossip, today, do we?” she said a gleam in her eye. He inclined his head, and walked to Hermione’s office. She’d have heard, of course. They needed to discuss damage control. Not for him, no, he wouldn’t involve her in this. But to their cause.
He was exhausted, but relieved. He knew it would take a battle for him to get Teddy to take every potion; it contained powdered moonstone, and Teddy abhorred the taste it gave to potions. But for now, he could feel happy his godson was alright, and they would have pancakes.
“Why, yes, of course Harry will be the other godparent” she frowns a bit at him, although her eyes still sparkle. “Who else would Ron ask, you silly Slytherin?”. He tries to hold back a groan but fails. He hears Hermione laugh again, and he knows he’s being laughed at.
“Oh thank Godric”. Hermione could help him, she always had.
Technology and magic didn’t always mesh well together, and the touchscreen still seemed to baffle Mrs. Weasley especially, who was always poking it with her wand, which made the screen bubble and change colour. But Mr. Weasley and Mr. Granger had hit it off spectacularly, because Mr. Granger was quite the engineer, and seemed to love magic, taking pride in his daughters’ talent. Mrs. Weasley and Mrs. Granger on the other hand, had quite the culture clash, Mrs. Granger insisting Hermione keep her own name
“Yes, Malfoy. We’re just about to close, so - ” Malfoy quickly interrupted him.

of that thing, Malfoy! Came home to Teddy and he pretended to gag!”. Draco grinned. He knew Potter lived with his godson, his Black cousin. He ignored the little jab of regret in his chest, and pressed on. Potter was hooked; interested. Now he just needed to reel him in, a little. He leaned forward just a tad more, cocking his head.
“Are you really?” she tutted disapprovingly. “I would think it a prime opportunity to try and find someone who might…. hold your interest better than any of the lovely
He locked himself in his office, and set to work. By the end of the day, his robes were ruined, singed in places, his hair was a mess, and he had several scores on his skin where paper had literally attacked him; paper cuts were petty, and they definitely

This was pretty bad, all considering. Accidental magic was common in children, but this sort of seizures, he’d never seen before. Magic wasn’t supposed to
“Harry’s godson is Draco’s cousin, you see”. Lawrence nods, as if he know this as well. “Draco seems to have taken quite a shine to Teddy, hasn’t he? He’s learning all of his favourite foods, I hear” Neville smiles. Harry can feel a blush creeping up his cheeks. Neville laughs. “Oh, I’m not implying anything, ” –he totally is, Harry feels-, “but don’t you think if Draco wasn’t at all trustworthy and a better person, Harry would let him near his godson?” he asks both Harry and Lawrence. Lawrence looks down to his feet, and shrugs. “Would you, Harry?” Neville presses.
He opened her door after a knock, and stepping inside found himself suddenly full of an arm of bushy haired female. “Oh Draco! How awful!” she declares,  and squeezes him tightly.
“Harry, why can’t I call you dad?”.  Harry glanced up from his bowl of cereal, feeling sucker punched all of a sudden. They were eating sugary cereal for dinner, the nonmagical kind he always got from Tesco’s.

“You don’t have to apologize, Teddy, you did nothing wrong.”
“Are you saying I am a bad parent?”. He felt defensive. Yes, he had felt inadequate in the last few weeks. But Teddy seemed happy generally, and he had Molly and Andromeda looking out for him, too, who were amazing parents.
“I know, Granger”
“I’m sure I have no idea what you’re talking about.” he answered therefore, trying not to look like he was enjoying this.
“Sorry, Madam, but the shop is closed.” She looks at him, startled.
“We had tea just the other week. Interesting conversationalist, if a bit forceful.”
“Why do you call me Edward, mister? It’s weird.” Teddy wrinkled his nose.
He had forgotten, the alarm set for the time he should apparate. Had forgotten it was Thursday, the day set for family dinner. Forgotten why he had even put on one of his favorite Muggle suits this morning, carefully chosen. Had forgotten his mother was feeling cross with him over rejecting yet another witch. And worse, he had forgotten to get his mother flowers, to mollify her.
He steps in, closing the door behind him, and takes a seat. He has patience, knows not to break her concentration. But they need to be leaving soon, and he doesn’t want her to fall back into her work for half an hour again, so he clears his throat subtly. She jumps, as if already forgotten he was there.
“Bloody hell” he chokes out. He hadn’t even thought of that. Their bill was due in a month. The retrial would span
“Ron!” Hermione chastised him, but also looked at Harry expectantly. He sighed. Yet
“Perhaps it’s time” he answers, flicking his eyes towards her stomach with a smirk.

The “Astronomer’s Dream” is a lullaby special to the Black family, and his mother taught him this old, traditional song as a child. It is a winding, repetitive song, about the ever changing and ever moving constellations, and the astronomer who loved them so much he spelled himself into the north star to follow.
Exhausted, he hurried his way home. At least he could have a nice dinner with Lawrence, and hire him to test their new syllabus.
What a ridiculous idea. But the provocation was making something bubble in his chest. He snorted inelegantly.
“How’s your boss, Drake?” he asked. Lawrence knew Hermione, if only in passing. Hermione didn’t approve of his employing Lawrence, since he was supposed to be a fulltime student, and he wasn’t to “corrupt the young”. She didn’t know how they had met, and that it wasn’t Draco who had initiated any sort of ‘corruption’.
‘Aunt Angie’ gave him a place to crash when he was inbetween student-housing accomodations. Gifted him care-packages, but wasn’t allowed to coddle him all that much. Their relationship was complicated, but they checked in on eachother.

“Hey, ‘Dromeda? Maybe it’s time to head home.” She slowly opened her eyes.
son there, and he needs me.”  He forcefully took a few steps to the bed, before a shield was thrown up in his path. With a little flex of magic, he had vanished it again. Furious, he turned again to the Healer. His anger felt too small for his body, and he desperately wanted to lash out to the witch standing in his way. The other two healers in the room had come to a halt, although there were still little twinkling sounds coming from the diagnostic charms hovering over Teddy.
Draco sighed. His mother’s missive might not have been overly convincing, despite his loyalty and love for her. No, another letter had come, later in the evening, from Mrs. Picklewilly, of all people. Her owl was a surprisingly mean thing with ribbons (!) tied to his clawed feet, and had tried to nip him when he wanted to take them off. What self-respecting owl allowed itself to be adorned was completely beyond him, but he was quietly impressed by its tenacity. Also, how had it even found his Muggle apartment!? Clearly he shouldn’t underestimate Mrs. Picklewilly more than he had already; she had some remarkable Snape-like tendencies in secret keeping. Her note, smelling faintly of radish preserves, had read:
, Potter. It wouldn’t do to estrange one of your best customers, would it?”
Malfoy grinned in delight, eyes gleaming. “Better yet, Potter. Only purebloods know this stuff. They can’t complain of blackmail in this ‘new and reformed ministry’.” He winked, and Harry’s insides squirmed again. “After all, they’re
“Oh, it’s so awful! That lying, conniving -” she pushes a hand through her hair, puffing it up even more.
having issues? Like you wouldn’t prefer to do it all by yourself and never leave the office again” he teased. It was still a bit new, teasing Granger. But they were improving.
He wasn’t sure if he knew Malfoy and Zabini were still in contact. Did this mean they weren’t friends? Harry shook his head. No, Malfoy had also sent a nice bouquet to a man named Shelly, he’d told him himself. He also gave flowers to his mother, and he was sure he loved her.
Harry jumped at the chance for support. “ ’Mione here has given me a babysitter!”.
It was a sunny spring day, and he had left his formal robes at the office. He couldn’t very well stride into Muggle London to get Granger her carrot cake for lunch wearing them. He felt a bit exposed regardless in his shirt and waistcoat, without any jacket. But it would have to do. And if he fancied himself a cinnamon roll from that same bakery, it wasn’t anybody’s business but his own, surely. Maybe pregnancy cravings could be contagious.
Molly laughed “oh, that wonderful boy” she muttered fondly. “If you’re sure about that breakfast?” she asked, sounding worried, and Harry nodded “I’m sure, I’m the only one at the shop today.”
He’s never shown himself fully as himself to Marcus before, and as he can’t metamorph at the moment, it’s his true form on display. It had been a sore point for Harry, but never something he pressed. He could understand feeling vulnerable, and trust had to be earned. His metamorphing was a defense mechanism, giving him a guise of confidence. He can see Teddy’s hesitation, already thinking of turning around. But Teddy’s also dead curious, and loves to stick his nose –or beak, or snout- in all sorts of business. A nightmare when he was an Auror, as he couldn’t bring files home lest Teddy read some of the grisly details. His amber eyes lock on Marcus, and he clenches his jaw. He looks defiant, kind of like Malfoy.
(See the end of the chapter for
Healer Lindsay smiled, and briefly explained, as he had before, what had happened and the measures taken, and about the potions regimen Teddy was supposed to take. He didn’t mention the mind healer again, however.
D.L.M? All those bouquets were yours?!”
He relayed, as far as he could, what Healer Lindsay had told him before, Hermione nodding in keen understanding. He didn’t mention the part about the mind-healer, still wrapping his mind around it. They were chatting, Harry winding down, when Teddy’s eyelids starting fluttering, the first signal he was waking up. As was usual when he woke up, his eyes were a light amber, unlike the green he liked to turn them to.
“Of course. I would be a bad godfather-to-be if I forgot
“Of course you do, dear. It’s time you realize it. And get a husband, to take care of you properly.” Harry snorted again.
rather drool-inducing.
Hermione never spoke to him about Ministry matters anymore, since he told her it led to tension between him and Marcus. And while that wasn’t an issue anymore –Harry ignored the little twinge of regret that that thought caused him- he still didn’t really want to think of the Ministry while at the flowershop. But then Malfoy had waltzed in in those suits of his and had mentioned… things. Odd things. Things similar to the little hints of news and gossip Mrs. Picklewilly liked to drop while he tried to swallow the sticky fruitcake she served. And hadn’t Malfoy visited Mrs. Picklewilly too?
Harry put down the arrangement on the counter.
“I know your mother dear, Narcissa. From Hogwarts, if you must know. We were in the same house, if not the same year.”
As would his suit, for that matter. Of course he shouldn’t have worn the grey velvet when he knew he was going to be about. It would be utterly ruined. But it was a comfortable suit, warm enough to ward off the chill of spring this week. Plus, the waistcoat was embroidered with little bumblebees, which he imagined were rather adorable and disarming. At least, it was what the taylor had told him. Of course, this was also the taylor who had tried to sell him lilac tweed, which had given him disgusting flashbacks to Gilderoy Lockhart, and had instigated a lengthy coughing fit. But the velvet was tactile, and even his mother had complimented him on it when she had seen it first.

when he gets here!” He looked a bit put out. Ron ruffled Teddy’s wild black hair.
The Ministry was, as ever, buzzing with activity. There were some reporters loitering about in the Atrium, but not many more than was usual. Relieved no one could see him, he made his way to the elevators, and pressed the button for level three, where the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures was situated. He checked the card again, to see who to ask for, and he suddenly felt very heavy.
“Ah, yes” Malfoy leaned forward to inspect them, and Harry took another chance to study him. It seemed that today, just like before, Malfoy affected the magic in the room, bending it towards him. It took Harry an effort not to do the same, but he shook it off. He wondered if others felt the same about him. Perhaps it was just an illusion of that stupid suit. “Do you mind if I pick them myself, Potter?”
Harry’s good mood vanishes instantly, and in its place comes a steady apprehension. Teddy is still leaning against him, and he briskly moves towards the house, and thus, Malfoy. There goes his plan to ward him out: the git has outdone him, this time. He sighs, but refrains from yelling at Malfoy, who’s staring at them unblinkingly, looking oddly mundane with his grocery bag and rather plain wizarding robes.
He has taken out an old Black tea-set, not the chipped and assorted mugs they usually use. It’s one of the nicer ones in Harry’s opinion, although it is less ornate than some of the others. Harry tries not to scoff at the recall: the house had, at some point, held more than five full teasets. Weird crusty old family, the Blacks had been, with teasets for every occasion, apparently. This set was more ‘common’: light pink with golden rims, and a smattering of white gardenia’s to decorate them. Their warming charm was wonky, but the flowery cups lent the tea a hint of sweetness. He got them out whenever Andromeda insisted on having ‘proper tea’ with him. He had no idea how Malfoy had found this set, he must’ve gone through the glassware cabinet in the sitting room next door. Odd.
His eyes flicked to his collauge, looking at him with raised eyebrows, then to Harry, watchful. “Is this your idea of a joke!?”. Harry let confusion show on his face. Of course he didn’t know who it was from, although he had an inkling. No, he only knew for sure that whatever the card meant, it had thrown off Edgecombe, and he now had the upper hand.
“Hmm?” Draco hummed, raising a perfectly manicured eyebrow. “I take it you have been delivering my arrangements all over the ministry, then?”
Another owl tapped at the window, this time a post-order one. Upon letting it in, it dropped a letter on Draco’s shoulder, and fled off again, not even accepting a treat Harry hastily grabbed from the little tray by the window.
“Oh well. Yes. Alright, then.” And he practically pushes her out of the door, Draco at her heels, arrangement for the Patils in hand. With a flick of his wand, the doorsign turns to

“Get up” he presses, a little louder. He squeezes his eyes closed one last time, and mutters again. “Get the
“Does this have to do with the new Traditional Wizarding Value lobby?” he asks. He’s thinking of Hermione, and how often she’d complained about the conservative faction and their allies, and how they were gaining ground in the department of Justice. Mrs. Picklewilly smiles at him, looking pleased.
“You know him, right? Went to school with him?” inquired Lawrence, trying to look innocently interested.
“Do you take sugar or milk, Malfoy?”.
Or rather, a lot of things that should have happened, simply
“Hello, Harry. We went to your Muggle supermarket, Fresco’s or something? If you both help unpack we can start cooking rightaway. We can make pot pies with the chicken stew, that’ll be quick”.  He nodded at the suggestion.
“I’m not sure I should be attending this year, really”.
“What is that

, bringing over food and cooking and shit!”. Ron was laughing now, and Hermione looked positively delighted at this little nugget of news. Sanaz smiled.
After at least a minute he heard some loud banging coming from inside, and after another brief silence, the lock clicked, and Draco was suddenly faced with a gaunt looking Potter in what seemed to be his pyjamas; there was nothing that even gave the impression that what Potter was wearing was fit for public view. A ratty, large, knitted jumper fell off of one shoulder, Gryffindor red with a large W on the front. On his bottom half he wore joggers so threadbare they nearly approached see-through, although luckily the jumper was long enough to actually cover any parts that might lead to accusations of public indency. His mind was torn between worry at this appearance, and finding it all rather
“So you could hate me, as you do now?” he asks.
“I had no choice, alright! He was going to kill my parents!” he screeches.
“Maybe someone needs to start reading papers, hm?”
“Are you lecturing me in botany, mother?” A smile blooms on her face, making her look younger, more like the mother he grew up with, despite the perennial sadness still lingering in her eyes.
They chatted about Luna’s latest project in the garden, crossbreeding saltwater Plimpies with ordinary strawberries, and Teddy’s progress in school. She was so proud of his reading skills, and held his newest drawing of a red racing car in her lap. Undoubtedly that would be hung up, pride of place in her house, next to all the others.
Teddy drew breath, blew it out again. Haltingly, he said “In the h-hospital, you- ” he drew another breath “you called me your son. You did!” he pierced Harry with a look.
“You’ve taken up with a Death Eater?!” Marcus spits out, looking disgusted.
Draco pretended to mull it over. “Check on Teddy, you mean?” A little smile started playing on Hermione’s lips.
“Dare I ask why you are bringing us pastry, Malfoy?”. He had placed the two cinnamon rolls in front of Draco and Teddy, and Teddy’s eyes were taking on a sort of gleaming excitement. Draco felt rather the same; these cinnamon rolls
Perhaps the most useful thing for Draco to do as Hermione’s secretary was not planning her schedule and campaigns, but listening to the ministry gossip mill.
“Oh dear, it’s worse than I thought”. Mrs. Picklewilly stated, leaning over to pat his arm.
“Mr Potter,-”
won the war. He still suffered from nightmares in which he was trapped in what used to be reality, pain and torture and all-encompassing fear. He settled on honesty, as much as he was capable of.
Teddy bit his lip and nodded. “Can we go home now?” he asked.
“–what do you mean with that?!”
“Well, alright then. No need to get all defensive.” He eyed her suspiciously, and reminded himself that he
Harry sighed again.
“Focus, Draco” he muttered under his breath. So, what to do about this information? If it got out, it would definitely hurt Potter, and by extension, Hermione. And in her state, he didn't want to risk anything, even if it made him an 'overbearing dragon'. He huffed. Ron had no right to call him that, since he was the one padding Hermione's chairs and escorting her home every day. Nevertheless she needed to know that certain departments  were infringing on their freedom of movement. His eyes flicked to another piece of information concerning Reginald Edgecombe. Beautiful Edgecombe was using his good looks in more departments, or rather,
“I’m sure any company I’d bring would be utterly bored, watching me work a room and try to flatter the old crowd, Mother”.
“So. Ehm. Good, then. Well, Ron and I wanted to tell you about something.” She started hesitantly. Harry put down his fork, and raised his eyebrows. Ron swallowed thickly, and took Hermione’s hand. She blushed.
”. He pleads.
“Teddy!” he exclaimed, fast approaching the bed.
Of course, he was being a bit too harsh on his mother. She meant well, after all. But intent did not absolve one from the responsibility of inexcusable behavior or truly abhorrent expressions of speech. He did not, however, think his mother untruthful in that she missed her only living sister, Aunt Andromeda. She hadn’t yet had the courage to contact her, after all these years, however. Never mind that it was apparently acceptable to send her own son to meddle in another family’s affairs, in the name of blood ties and ‘traditions’.
The floo flared to life, and Ron and Hermione tumbled out onto the carbet in the kitchen. “Hi, Harry, Teddy!” Hermione greeted him, and went to hug Teddy. She looked a bit strained, but very much off-duty in an oversized Cannons jumper –Ron's, obviously, but the orange blissfully faded, and dark jeans. Different from her business attire that was a grown-up version of her studious school-uniform, and more like the post-war Hermione who valued comfort in her private life, the one she built with Ron. Their home reflected this also; their walls might be lined with overstuffed bookshelves –organized by both category and author, indexed with Hermione’s own system, but it was also cosy. Picture frames depicting many Weasley’s and their friends stood in front of the tomes, and oftentimes spare cups of leftover tea could be found scattered about the shelves; where Hermione had left them, looking for a book –and forgotten all about them.
He’d just have to figure out a way to keep the mail out of his office, then. It couldn’t follow him home, at least. He felt his shoulders droop, the weight of the hatemail quite literally weighing him down. He didn’t have time for this nonsense, and he didn’t want to think about the trial any more than he had to. It wasn’t like he
, he thought.
“So in a way, Malfoy and I aren’t so different.” He states, knowing how true it is, even if he doesn’t like to ponder on it.
He picked up the bunch of flowers, and was gone. Shit.
After the potion, Potter comes to stand next to him at the sink. Teddy has his face propped on his arms, eyes falling closed. “Thanks for dinner, Malfoy” he says quietly. Draco looks at him. “You’re welcome, Potter” he answers. They work in tandem, cleaning, and the air turns a bit expectant. It shouldn’t be so easy, Draco washing up the Muggle way, Potter drying and putting away dishes. So perfectly coordinated. Then, a small thump alerts them to Teddy’s having fallen asleep right at the table. Potter shoots Draco a wry smile, and quicky turns to Teddy.
. And years of compliance with corrupt and incorrigible traditional politics was
Now, if writing his mother back was as easy as writing a shopping list.
“We need Harry to vote, too, now” Hermione whispers. Draco purses his lips.
“Say, why don’t you go up and take some of that Pepper-Up, and I’ll see you in a minute, ‘kay?” Teddy nods quickly, and with a last look at Malfoy –who smiles encouragingly at him-, he goes upstairs.
“You have to wait a bit, pup, right, Mione?”. Hermione nodded, hand on her still flat-looking stomach.
“Voldemort”, Harry adds, and Neville shudders.
Draco debated his answer. He found he
“Well, we can do curry next time, if you wish. How about some chicken and baked potatoes today?”. Teddy nods again, smiling, mouth full of apple. Mother would be horrified at Teddy’s lack of manners, but what could be expected in Potters household? He smiles again at Teddy glad he seemed agreeable to not-curry, and starts gathering some ingredients. He directs Teddy to put away the other foodstuffs, which he thankfully does. Then he makes him wash his hands before actually starting to cook. Draco doesn't want to risk any slime bucket residue contamination. Teddy looks fascinated by all the chopping and washing. When Draco puts perfectly chopped carrots to boil, he hears creaking of the floorboards.
he was better than them. Plus, he had a Lawrence, who had secured his ‘laptop’ computer to the nines.
recently with progressive wizards. But she was no stranger to muggle things; he knew she also loved her stapler and sellotape, and a deft hand at using computers too, something that still occasionally baffled Draco, despite the classes he had taken at his local community center for the “digitally challenged”. Which apparently had only included elderly muggles, and Draco, the pureblood wizard.
Stumbling out of the floor at Neville’s flower shop, he quickly cleared the dust and then went to switch the sign on the door to ‘open’. It looked quiet on Diagon yet, and his curious eyes earned him a wave from Mrs. Picklewilly next door, and he waved back, smiling. Mrs. Picklewilly owned the shop across from Neville’s, and was a lovely elderly witch who ran a cook and crockery shop that was stacked so completely full you had to navigate it with great care. While he never asked, he was sure that Molly had at least gotten all her cookbooks, if not her pots from “Pot, Kettle, Pickle”.
Uneasily, he stirred his tea again, careful not to let the spoon touch the edges of the fine porcelain cup.
He’d never pegged Ron for a mother hen, but it’s certainly the title that fits best. Auror Weasley, fussiest father to be. Although from the stories he's heard about Molly Weasley, perhaps it runs in the family.

“I didn’t want to!” he yells, losing his temper finally. He feels his magic taking up space around him, crackling. Lawrence takes a step back.
“Okay. Can we have curry?” he asks. Draco halts. Curry? That wasn’t on his list. Bloody hell. He hasn’t ever made it. Had eaten it, shamefaced, at Ron and Hermione’s place, when they had a ‘take-out night’, and loved it. Especially the naan. He should learn to do so immediately. Scrambling, he tries:
“What did the smelly flowers mean?”
“Why do you care?” Potter bit back, but without conviction.
seats of power in the Wizengamot, and he should really start using those. Plus, he was the Savior. He had a responsibility! And if it so happened to align with the plans Draco and Hermione had for reforms, well, all the better, wasn’t it?
“You know something, right?” he pressed. Hermione sniffed.
“Well, I was going to recommend not morphing for a week at least. He’ll need to take stabilizing potions for five days, and those also inhibit instinctual magic like metamorphing a little bit.”
for their general sanity, and he had only one sock on.
, and walked over to Neville’s flower shop,
He wondered at his own inability to kick Malfoy out, or close the wards off to him. Perhaps he should do so today, just in case he came back. While he didn’t seem too hostile, he was obviously still an obnoxious arsehole, with the way he manipulated people with flowers. Weirdly, Harry was still selling him those blackmail flowers.
. He’d chucked it anyway. What a waste.
, I want that. What Ron and Hermione have. A boring, domestic existence, complete with messy family dinners and sappy traditions, all of it”. It rushed out, his deepest desire; family.
“You’re not fit to be a godparent, you have
Malfoy had inherited most of the Malfoy fortune and assets after his father had been locked away, due to his being the only legal heir. He wondered what this meant, Lucius’ appeal. What did Malfoy stand to lose? Then another thought popped into his head.
And feeding it, occasionally.
Draco is pestered to check on Harry and Teddy. He catches a glimpse of how bad the situation really is.
. Or at least, that’s what Teddy called him. Salazar, is this what being a godparent is like? He presses his lips together. Well, he’ll just be back tomorrow, then. And not just because it was cosy, not to eat all by himself. Or to have Teddy love his cooking. Although maybe that wasn’t so bad either.
“Malfoy I-”
“I understand, darling. Let us say no more of it, for now”. He slowly blows out his pent up breath, and attacks his quiche with gusto.
“Now, dear. We need to make a plan!”. He set his tea down.
“Tell you what, Malfoy”.
“What do you reckon?” Potter settled on. Ah. Skipping over their previous conversation then. Not very Gryffindor-like, but it suited him fine. Draco cocked his head, considering.
“Why do you care, Malfoy?” He rubbed his beard, flowers lying tied prettily on the counter. Malfoy’s eyes flicked to the gesture, intrigued.
Harry confronts Hermione, and Teddy makes new friends. We learn about how the Hermione-Draco friendship came to be about.
“Alright then. Let’s head out.” Draco threw his napkin on the table, along with some bills to cover the cost of their refreshments. They didn’t mind his sudden departures here; Draco was an excellent tipper.

“Crying’s fair too, if you were” he teases. It was kind of fun, teasing Malfoy.
?” he scoffs.
Harry shakes his head. “No, Lawrence. I’m merely saying that given the same circumstances, I probably would have done what he did. Made the same choices, of which there were very few.”
“Argh!” came from inside the dressing room. “I couldn’t care less about robes, really, Draco!”. She poked her head through the curtains. She looked a less like the efficient professional she wanted to portray at work, and more like the frazzled passionate bookworm from their Hogwarts days. It was strangely endearing. He let a slight smile linger on his lips.
Harry looks at him, too stunned for a reply.
, of course. And while that would seem to be perfect leverage, he first had to know who was
“What are you planning, Draco?”. He tried very hard not to approve of her insight. If it wasn’t for her sense of fairness, she would’ve ruled the Slytherin common room.
“That is such an ugly term, Mr. Malfoy. I want him to
(isn't that a beautiful bouquet to give to your mother?)
His mother might not like or personally endorse all of the proposed reforms, but she was decidedly more mild than her husband in her views.
“ouch!” he clutches his bitten palm in his other hand, just as the door to the shop opens with a ring of the bell. He curses under his breath, and greets the new customer.
“But-” Draco starts, but he’s interrupted
And Edgecombe had turned to the press, gleefully listing all the reasons why Belby had left Potter for him. The article had claimed to want to congratulate the new ‘power couple of the ministry’ –Draco snorted at that, because while Belby was an esteemed auror (and patented arsehole, apparently), Reginald Edgecombe was a weak-kneed pureblood, vain, and part of the conservative faction in the Wizengamot he had met today. Edgecombe had voted against House-elf liberation, against renewed classification of magical creatures, and against removing pureblood supremist books from the Forbidden Section of the Hogwarts Library. Draco had little good to say about him, although he had to admit the man had fabulous hair. Sure, Draco was vain. But he kept
, undoubtedly. He cleared his throat.
“Soon, yeah? We just have to wait for the Healer, okay?” Harry stated. They were just starting in on a debate what to have for dinner, when Healer Lindsay came back, holding a tray of coffee cups in hand, looking a bit sheepish when he spotted Ron and Hermione standing next to the bed as well.
, so to speak, and sought to motivate him to have a ‘proper family’ by dangling the trust fund before him. It hadn’t yet worked. It wouldn’t, even now, he resolved. He forced himself to unclench his jaw, folded his white hands in his lap. He felt cold. He set himself to prying off the silver and emerald Malfoy crest-ring, wanting to pelt it across the room like a petulant child. He wouldn’t, of course. The Goblin would just pick it up and put it in the Family vault. His father’s vault. He set it on the table with a little
“Well, family can be intrusive. Better just let them.” Sanaz shrugged, as if that settled the matter. Harry snorted.
Zabini was a solicitor, and a very good one, apparently. Perhaps not so surprising, giving his mother’s tendency to go through husbands like tissues and end up richer every single time. But why did Malfoy need a solicitor? He took care putting together the purple columbines and glinting, ruby-zinnia. They were rather expensive, and their sparkling leaves were also often used in cosmetics. ‘Just perfect for a posh git like Zabini’, he mumbled, and added their standard coloured card, printed with
“Well, fine then. Owl me, if there’s something urgent?”. He nods.
He won’t even be able to pay Blaise for all his help, as it stood now. It was a small wonder, that his Slytherin loyalty had held until this moment. All of his vaults had been seized the moment of the decision. He only had a few days respite to vacate his apartment because it was exactly three days for the paperwork to get through, and the reinstated Lord Malfoy had to be able to exercise and ‘enjoy all his rights and use of property as was his due’ by then. He would be opening a new bank account now, so at least he’d have access to his Ministry salary. After of course, war restitutions had been deducted. A Death-Eater tax, so to speak. It hadn’t really bothered him financially before, of course, but it was an infinite contribution. To his death. Of thirty-five percent of his salary, no less. He wondered if he could even afford to rent in London, now. Definitely not in the Muggle areas, he supposed.
One heartbeat, they just looked at eachother.
. He could feel Lawrence practically buzzing with excitement. They were almost to the door when from behind, a crooning voice came “Oh, is that you, young mr. Malfoy?” Draco whipped his head around so fast his neck cricked.
Draco clenches his jaw again, feels his teeth grinding together.
“My teeth are going to rot soon, what with Hannah’s baking, Mrs. Picklewilly’s fruitcake, and Hermione’s pregnancy cravings. I don’t think Teddy remembers what vegetables look like, honestly” Potter groaned. Draco felt himself smile, again. It was all rather ridiculous: the bombardment of sweets going round, the mess Potter was in, and now this; him sitting in Potters kitchen in the Black ancestral home.
if that Marcus Belby had apparently started an underhanded campaign with Edgecombe to give the conservatives a stronghold in Enforcement? So what if Potter's ex turned out to be even more of a prick than he had already suspected? Belby had managed to push for more active tracking on former Death Eaters, as well as what were now called “disruptors of public order”. In this case, Hermione’s people. Their network was being targeted, not even that subtly. And he personally could be affected by these developments, too. Shite.

The door bell jingles to his right, and he looks up. A witch in light blue robes has just stepped in. He does

“Can I expect it to continue in the near future?” he asks again.
Malfoy flashes him a wry smile.
“Whatever, Draco. I don’t want to hear your excuses”. He walks to the door, and Draco looks on helplessly as he opens it. “Don’t call me again, you
“Are you okay?” Teddy looked at him, perceptive for his nine years, reflecting Harry’s own green eyes back at him, hair sticking up on every direction.
He thanked her for the tea, and went back to Neville’s shop, begging off work for the rest of the day. Neville took a look at his white face, and seemed to understand. A corner of the days’

“Very well.” He turned, and Potter followed him to the door. He hadn’t really got his answers, but he knew the situation was pretty awful. He turned, and saw Potter glancing upstairs briefly before looking at him again. “Potter, send Neville an owl, would you? He’s truly worried.” He picks an imaginary piece of lint off his sleeve. Potter sighs. “Sure. Bye, Malfoy” he states, and opens the door. Draco steps out, looks back with a small smile. “See you tomorrow, Potter.” He quickly walks off, and hears a grumbled “Tomorrow!? Wait… What!” behind him, but he Apparates before Potter can come after him.
“These are for your mother, you said?”, Potter finally asks.
He was going along with Mrs. Picklewilly’s plan for now, and what he needed for it to even have the slightest chance of succeeding, was Potters attention. And not in the way he used to get it, by yelling at him and stomping on his nose. He couldn’t stop the embarrassed grin on his face. Salazar, what an annoying child he had been. Potter’s reaction hadn’t been ideal –
“You’re just lucky” Sanaz answered him, motioning to Teddy. Hermione rested her cheek on Ron’s shoulder, and put a hand on her abdomen. The three of them exchanged a look. It conveyed all the worry for Teddy, but equally, all the love. Harry smiled at Sanaz. The warm squirmy feeling was back.

“It’s fine really, mrs. Picklewilly.” He croaked out. “It’s been nearly a month now, you know.” She tutted disbelievingly.
“Problem? You’re seriously asking if it’s a
The knot that had lodged itself in his throat since Marcus left two weeks ago lessened slightly. Perhaps he could do this thing after all, even without a partner. He swallowed quickly.
“I’m nearly done with that. Just waiting for my idiot partner’s share of the work.” He took another large bite, then continued “It was easy really, I just had to modify some other automated tool I used before, and the prof’s happy enough already”. Having no idea what that all meant –his computer class for the digitally challenged didn’t cover enough, clearly, he started to outline the current situation leading up to both the function and the bill.
He curled up small, and deposited his glasses and wand on the nightstand with a soft clatter. He didn’t even bother changing his clothes, the sterile smell of St. Mungo’s still clinging to him. It had been the worst day in a long while. The thought of Teddy, sweet Teddy, his bright godson, being strapped down in a St. Mungo’s bed, his magic going haywire, was something Harry hoped he’d never see again.
godchild. His family, by choice.
Goods in hand, he decided he might as well pick up his order from Spectral Sprouts, see if Potter was there too. It had been a few days since his unfortunate but necessary confession, and he hoped Potter had stewed in his awful response. Loathe to admit it, Draco had. He still cringed inwardly, hearing that surprised laugh. But he had to put those feelings aside and really get on with it, else Potter wasn’t ever going to the Function, with
“Oh, I just finished that order. Just a sec.” Potter turned back, and came out with a lovely bright collection of pinks and blues and whites. Just that moment, an owl came zooming through the window, straight for Neville.
. He took a deep breath, and knocked loudly, steadily, three times. He could hear the magical amplification inside, making sure his knocks carried to the occupiers of the house. He took a step back, and tried not to swallow his tongue with nerves. It was starting to drizzle, and he hoped Potter would answer the door soon or his hair would be ruined.
He got a raised blond brow in return. “I’m sure she never will, Potter”. He didn't seem mad however, amused, rather.
“Yes. We’d better leave. Now, Madam, if you please”.
“Not those robes, then. Duly noted, Granger”. She sighed again, turning back to get dressed in her suit.
“Oh, god, Draco, have you decided then?” a radiant smile overtook her face, and she grabbed his hand again. He nodded.
He felt bad. He knew how hard it was, coming out to anyone, let alone your arch-nemesis turned… flower deliverer? While Harry was still scrambling to figure out a save, Malfoy grit out “Well, It’s been grand, Potter. Goodbye”.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to pry” Harry hastily added, trying for a smile. The Healer regarded him pensively. “Its just,” He messed up his hair a bit more, and glanced at Teddy to make sure he was still asleep, “I don’t know any other parents, that are, you know… going at it alone.” The Healer gave him a wry smile. Colour was slowly returning to his cheeks.
’, and Harry was again ignorant of its meaning. He didn’t want to rope Hermione in to ask about all the Latin, and get a lecture on classical spell-theory, or something. He resolved to find himself a book on the meaning of flowers. At least he could inform himself what horrid meanings must be hidden in them. He was sure Neville had several hidden away in the massive archive cabinet they hardly ever used, and only Hannah knew how to navigate when it came to doing the books.  He’d put the rather lovely arrangement aside with a glare, and startled again upon seeing the next name. Blaise Zabini.
Delivered to said Shelly McKinnon, a blustery man in his mid thirties, taking his lunch.

The Witch from the day before had given an interview to the Prophet –

“Did you?” Harry asks in exaggerated surprise. Teddy answers enthusiastically, and Draco continues setting the table. No table cloth, no napkins, no candles. Utter
She cleared her throat delicately. “Don’t take it badly Harry, but I can’t help but notice a few things.”

“That’s a yes”. Teddy exclaimed something unintelligible and flung himself at Harry. From this distance, even if Teddy was small, it took the wind out of him.
Hello my dear readers, friends! Recovery is a long road, made better by your kind wishes. I'm unable to respond to messages currently, but at least I can post a new chapter.
“I know! I just need some flowers!” He exclaims again, frantically now. The thought of his mother’s disapproving frown prompts him to blurt out “I was held up at work and I really need to bring flowers to dinner to placate mother so she’s -” he finally manages to stop himself. Merlin, how embarrassing, he must be beet red at this point. Harry snorts, but allows him to pick a bouquet before closing, adding in the lullaby-singing baby’s breath that he knows his mother loves.

“Wouldn’t
It felt like a can of worms was slowly wriggling its way into his stomach, yet again. He suddenly wasn’t at all annoyed that Teddy had stolen his toast –he wouldn’t be able to eat it anyway, now.
Mrs. Picklewilly frowns again, and looks contemplative. “Yes, that is the question, isn’t it, dear?”
“Oh sweetheart” he muttered. His throat felt tight. Teddy was Remus’ and Tonks’ son.
“A bit forward of you, isn’t it?”
Still on his hands and knees he heard the bell above the door jingle, announcing a new customer. Three clipped, sharp steps announced a voice.
He had paused too long. Teddy opened his mouth again.
idea what it takes!” Harry yells, now.
“I assure you, I am not. However, in my department there is no need for mail that includes curses, hexes, or howlers!”. He grits out. The Mailwizard calmly studies an owl that comes in. Draco tries not to combust from impatience.
Hermione laughed, looked a bit guilty.
He groaned inwardly. Was this his paranoia speaking again? It really did seem like Malfoy was up to something. But it couldn’t be something nefarious, if Hermione knew of it. And he thought she knew of it. He sighed.
“I am very glad to hear it, of course,” she says, giving him a smile. Then she does something she’s never done, and leans forward to pat his arm, squeezing it. “But that’s not what I asked”. Harry squirms in his chintzy chair. He
“Well spotted, Potter.” He straightened up, and stroked his waistcoat. “She doesn’t enjoy the way I dress to dinner, no. But it’s not that.” He said, in a quiet voice. Harry had finished binding the flowers together, fluffing the leaves a bit. He was vying for time, now.
Hermione, as Department Head for the Wizarding Education, Information and Reformation Department –its unfortunate acronym being W.E.I.R.D, was working towards a larger societal reform of which the campaign would start just after the Function. Draco had accepted Hermione’s offer to work for her after she had accepted his stumbling, shamefaced apology for everything he had ever done to her and let do to her.
“..H..Hurts” the boy managed to choke out. Draco could do nothing but stare. What the hell was going on here? One minute they were eating pastries in awkard silence, the next there was a veritable crisis happening.
“I don’t mind,” he smiled at her “as long as you take a breath in-between to give us mere mortals time to catch up”. Her smile widened, he noticed in satisfaction.
aren’t dressed, why do
Draco leaned back, touching his fingers to the delicate pink blooms set on the counter. Potter’s eyes dropped to his hand.
“No, I mean, it’s dinner time with you mother, right?”
Harry inclines his head. “I’ll go and inform her. It’s her choice, however.” He warns, and leaves the room. He can hear Teddy and Malfoy resuming their animated conversation, and figures he can leave them for a little while, after all. He has much to think of regarding Malfoy, and he feels wrongfooted by all that happened today.
He never cares to make his own lunch, or dinner even. He really only makes an effort for Teddy, and Teddy often doesn’t mind cereal for breakfast and dinner. Plus, Teddy’s also too young to comment on Harry picking at his food while he eats himself. He sighs, and rubs his stomach. He knows he’s lost weight in the last months, and suspects it would be worse if Hermione hadn’t dragged him off for cake all the time. And then Malfoy, all of a sudden, dropping by and cooking. He even had the audacity to prepare meals and stick them in the fridge. Every morning, while taking out the milk for Teddy, he was faced with neat little rows of Tupperware boxes, labeled in precise, cramped handwriting. ‘
“Well, that would explain all the long lunches she takes without me. I’ve limited her carrot-cake consumption to twice a week, you know. I’m trying to be responsible or I’ll get Weasley on my back”. Harry grinned again. “Well, he’s not much better. He gets her anything she wants.”
“Is there any witch that could convince you?”. Oh no. Did she just…? Of course his mother
“Ehm” Teddy starts, and starts rummaging around in the grocery bag, putting some fruit on the table. “I got some slime buckets from uncle George’s shop…” he starts. Draco raises an eyebrow, trying to contain the spill of images in his head. He fails.
“Bullocks!” he jumps up, throws his robe off over the chair, and quickly locks up the office, turning off the lights as he goes. It’s late, and everyone’s left their desks. With a sweeping motion of his wand, all the papers on all the desks line up in neat stacks, chairs are pushed in, and devices –Magical and Muggle, are switched off. A blessed silence descends on the department, and taking on last look, he runs to the elevator to take him down to the apparition points. Flowers first then –an apology for more than one offense.
. Draco starts unpacking the bag further as Teddy is starts to eat an apple. He doesn’t mention washing it, and lets him at it.
“Why don’t we head out for some of that awful carrot cake you keep craving instead of lunch, and see about our plans for the announcement, agreed?”. A tentative smile crept over her face.
“At least I can do one thing right.” Harry glanced away from the fire and found the room to be too cramped. There were ghosts here too, and not just in the forgotten portraits stacked against the walls. He rose from his chair quietly, one eye on the Headmaster’s dozing form, and left the room. Sunlight poured into the corridors through mullioned windows, and he could almost see Ginny there in the pools of light, as carefree as she had been during his sixth year. How could he have known that his attempt to keep her safe—far away from him—would end up in this odd finale? Keeping her close, it seemed, had been the answer all along.
“That’s so big of you.”
Pomfrey looked down at him. Even through the weariness, he saw her eyes narrow slightly.
It took a moment to find his clothing, heaped on a moth-bitten chair next to the bed, and he tugged on the chilly garments gingerly. He shook out his robes and swept them around his shoulders, sighing as the heavier cloth settled against him. When he came back, he’d light a fire for himself, enjoy the warmth.
“Oh god,” Harry whimpered.
She remembered the white-washed walls of St. Mungo’s last Christmas. Standing out in the hall, on legs leaden with as-yet untapped grief, and seeing yet another haunting tableau in the next room: the instantly recognisable blond hair of Draco Malfoy, bent over the bed of a girl Ginny had never thought twice about, except to belittle her shrieking laughter and upturned nose.
“I could go,” Oliver countered heatedly. “Or you, Moody.”
The others passed by without speaking. Their tracks carved a path through the field, bending the grass down until it glittered, wet and deep green. Harry stood in the shadow of the door, reluctant to step past Luna. It was stupid; she knew exactly where he was. She knew where everyone was.
He had a whole tirade of things to rail against when he at last slung open Luna’s door. But when he saw her, dressed in rose pink and looking curiously toward him, the impetus left him so quickly he shuddered. He came to a stop just over the threshold and drew a painful breath. “Luna,” he managed, “don’t let anyone out of the castle. Please.”
Harry blinked, and then Draco was on him, crushing Harry’s mouth to his, one hand gripping his arm painfully. Harry grabbed the body against his, not close enough, they weren’t close enough, felt himself being pushed, staggering, and it felt free like he never had. Draco bit at his lips, shoved up against him; Harry’s back hit the wall, then his head. Light dazzled his eyes in tiny sparks. But Draco’s hands were suddenly there, climbing through his hair, slipping behind to cradle his head. Touching with tender fingers.
“You can feel it, too.” She came closer, and her voice rose. “Oh, gods, you can feel it because of the bond. Can’t you?”
“For a little while, at least.” Harry fell silent, listening to Oliver’s silverware clinking, and the drip-drip-drip of the water in the passageways beyond the kitchens. Luna’s voice was muted down here, an echo that ebbed and swelled with every note. Oliver’s expression relaxed into a dreamy, vague look.
himself. Even more horrifying was the thought that maybe he’d always done that. For years and years, and she had just consigned him to hatred, as he’d consigned her. But it wasn’t holding any longer. His edges were fraying right before her eyes and she had the frightening feeling that something colossal was going to come pouring through the rips and tears, large and dark and painful, something she had no business knowing.
