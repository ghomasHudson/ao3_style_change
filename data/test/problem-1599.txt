Malfoy was undeniably bad for Harry, and there was no chance Harry would think otherwise.
“No not at all, I think it’s amazing actually.” Draco’s body relaxed. “I mean to be forced into being a death eater-“
“I don’t know who you are, I wouldn’t trust you that easily.” Lucius pointed out, in a very Slytherin manner.
right.
“So…What?”
“So you woke everyone in this apartment complex up three times a week to a fire alarm, almost burnt down the flat multiple times, wasted a tonne of food and scared away hundreds of your dates just to get my attention?”
Harry was out of the shower within a few minutes and had decided to dress slightly nicer than usual in a fitted button up and jeans. House searching meant a lot of people might see him out and he supposed that if the Prophet were going to snap some photos of him, he may as well look nice.
“Do you want to sleep with me?” Harry asked, making Malfoy’s breath pause, Harry rubbed his thumb in circles against Draco’s cheek.
“She didn’t show it.”
“Are you really still doing that puzzle?” Hermione quipped, her eyes momenterily flickering away from an egg that was sizzling on the stove. “I mean, it’s been at least a week Harry.”
“Ooooh a Pornstar Martini, my favourite.” Ginny praised, taking a long sip from the glass. She paused upon seeing Harry’s expression. “Are you okay, you look a bit shell shocked?”
“Ah… Hello there – Ginny.” He awkwardly patted her back, scowling at Harry’s amusement from his stiff shoulders.
“That’s awesome, mate! I’m working the whole week; I only work out for fun on the weekend.”
“Really? We have to apparate all the way over there.” Harry complained.
“I don’t think that’s a good idea.”
“You could come downstairs and watch with me. Or you could stay in my flat, I guess.”
Harry obliged and exchanged the deep, slow thrusts for a new shallow speed, which filled the room with the sound of skin slapping against skin. Draco’s mouth fell open, his arms gripping on to Harry’s with a renewed force. Without the pillows behind his head, he probably would’ve hit the headboard with the push of each thrust.
“Appear out of nowhere?”
After that, he had managed to remove the rest of the wallpaper in the house and all the remaining furniture. Meaning that the house now had a pile of chairs and tables stacked up in the garden, slowly melting into the swamp land.
8:59 pm
“Oh, don’t worry about it, Hermione.” Harry brushed it off. Hoping she didn’t feel too guilty.
“They’ll want to do a house check.” Malfoy explained. “…And I used to be a p-prostitute. Remember? That’s illegal.” Draco fiddled with his fingers, unable to meet Harry’s eyes.
“Harry.”
“You’re getting better.” Harry complimented, letting his hand slip further from Draco’s waist to his hip. He felt the blond bristle.
Pansy took a second to respond to his answer, before suddenly jerking up and staring at Harry intensely.
“I’ve never needed to have one before.” Harry looked at the bed. The
date.” Harry smiled back.
The past three years, there’d never been a point where he’d truly wished he’d never time-leapt back. There were definitely times where it was more difficult, but he’d never regretted what had happened, but just seeing Lily’s face had ripped a crack in his heart so deep that he knew he could never forget.
“Bloody Hell Draco!” Harry cursed, swatting Malfoy’s hands away from himself. “That’s my job.” He smiled.
“No… This is how they play it in France.”
He groggily glanced over to the clock.
Ginny wrapped her arms around Harry in a warm embrace and he rested his forehead on her shoulder.
“I thought we were making something more Malfoy. And you’ve just lied to me. Built our whole relationship on a foundation of lies.”
“Even Christmas dinner.”
if Malfoy walked in right now. He pulled his head back slightly.
Draco cast a sad sigh, “I said, do you want to go home? It’s late, you could use some sleep.”
“Well, aren’t you boring.” Harry slowly drifted backwards away from Draco, expressively lip syncing along to ‘Do you remember,’ he waved his hands in finger guns ‘…the twenty-first night of September!”
“Lovely.” Kingsley smiled, reaching under the desk, “Well, he’ll be here in twenty minutes, so here’s your first case. Don’t worry, it’s simple enough really.”
“It sounds… nice.”
“You’re right. Thank you.” Draco reached forward for one last embrace, pulling Harry tight. “Do you need any advice with your boyfriend?” Draco asked into Harry’s hair.
He squinted his eyes at it for the fiftieth time, a small beam of light glinting out at him.
“Well maybe you should accept that I know what’s good for me! If I said no, I mean no! And it’s oh so ironic that you – of all people - are telling me to get back with him! If only you knew who he was!” Harry squeezed his fists and took a loud breath in through his nostrils. “You know what?! You do know who he is! I lied! I’m a liar! And trust me, its ridiculous that you of all peop-“
“Wha-“
Draco drank enough water that it almost made him sick, he could feel it bubbling in his belly, tempting its way up and out of his mouth.
“What is it?” Harry asked, looking down the man’s hand, where he saw a nasty looking, blistered burn running across his palm. “Oh Merlin, that doesn’t look good.”
“Makes sense.” Harry agreed.
Alas, he was having no luck with any of the alleys, he was only about one hundred metres away from the house and he still hadn’t found the right alleyway. Perhaps he hadn’t seen this alleyway a few weeks ago, it would be a weird thing to remember anyways.
And that was how Harry found himself kneeling in front of the floo about three hours later.
Malfoy stared down at his drink.
“Yes of course.” Harry shoved the spoonful of tart into his mouth and moaned at the taste. It tasted just like the one he used to have back at Hogwarts. “This is amazing.” HE explained to Malfoy, who was slowly picking away at his obscenely large waffle.
“Who is he?” Draco forked a bite of his cake and almost moaned at the taste exploding on his tongue. Sometimes he swore they mixed just a bit of magic into these cakes.
“I’ll take it.” Harry picked up the documents in front of him and shuffled them into his bag.
“Not now.” Malfoy’s eyes were trained on Harry’s hard nipples. “Will you be there all day?”
He was not sure if this was working at all but judging by the silence of the circle around him, he presumed he was doing a good job.
“Of course not.” He lied, causing her to uncross her arms and fall back down onto the plump cushions of the sofa.
Harry moved himself between Draco’s legs and aligned his dick just in front of Draco’s loose, shiny hole. He looked up to Draco’s face to see the man staring down at where their two bodies were about to meet. He whispered a small charm and Harry’s cock was liberally coated in a new layer of lube.
He was running low on canvases. If he wasn’t careful, he’d be out by tomorrow, and Merlin knows he never remembered to buy more. But he’d really gotten himself into a painting streak, to the point that his walls were always mounted with new drying paintings, he’d even considered beginning to sell them off. They really were getting high quality – in Harry’s opinion.
Maybe he was bisexual. It would make snese, wouldn’t it? He definitely prefers men, without a doubt. But he was never not attracted to women, he never faked it with Ginny or anyone else. It always felt real. Perhaps not intense but, it always felt real.
It was almost too much, after all that waiting and denial, Harry almost couldn’t cope. He whimpered against Draco’s mouth, the salty residue smoothly being replaced with peppermint. Draco’s hands tightened against Harry’s back and he could feel them slowly descending onto his arse, each settling over one cheek before firmly squeezing the muscle.
“It’s Malfoy.” He repeated, louder this time. Harry almost wished he’d recorded Ginny’s reaction because in any other context, he was sure it would’ve been hilarious. But at the moment, her open jaw and bulging eyes did nothing but turn his stomach.
“No nothing.” Malfoy began, “You still live with Mother at the Manor.” He showed Lucius a convincing smile.
A heavy weight fall over Harry’s chest, was Cole just a picture of what Harry would become if he didn’t get Malfoy out of his system?
“Really? I only just got here.”
. In reality he knew that his filter always threw itself out of an eight story building around Harry. Especially around a completely naked Harry.
Harry peeked out of one eyeball. The idiot had his eyes squeezed shut, as if that would make him unrecognisable.
It took approximately five minutes for Harry to explain the current situation they were stuck in and a further thirty minutes of Malfoy asking the same question over and over again before he seemed to come to grips with whatever was happening.
Harry’s body was still rigid but softened into the bed a little more. After a few minutes he heard the lull of Malfoy’s breath slow and deepen. Was he asleep? He must’ve been.
“No, you should be fine.” Harry confirmed, watching from a metre away as Malfoy re-approached the bin.
Draco looked over and followed his eyes.
“Years of intense Auror training.” Ron waved his hands in a small jazz hands gesture.
“Don’t get me wrong, my son is the best thing to ever happen to me. But it was a bit of a shock.”
Harry’s eyes blew wide. He knew he’d slept in, but not by that much.
“How do you know?” Malfoy insisted, making Ron raise his fingers to rub at his eyeballs.
“Ooooo did you find a new guy?” She asked, noticing how Harry’s eyes kept slipping back to the floor.
Harry smiled at his food and carried on eating, pleased with his cooking attempt.
1:15am.
“And we’re in 1980?”
Hermione and Ron had gotten him a medium-sized bottle of cologne. The packaging appeared to be muggle, so he was extremely surprised when he spritzed it and was immediately addicted to the smell. If this wasn’t muggle, he would’ve probably thought that they had given him a bottle of amortentia.
“It’s just a bin, what’d the worst that could happen?” As Malfoy lifted his arm to the opening, a wave of annoyance flew over Harry.
“Thank Merlin.” She chucked her hands onto her chest in relief. “I was about to have a heart attack there!” Her large smile seemed to brighten the room in an instant.
“Yeah, yeah… I wanked, like, three times. I mean, I can normally go for multiple rounds but… Ya’know… Poor little mini-Harry is really spent…” He could feel his own face light up red.
“Good night.”
Harry cocked an eyebrow.
“Is that a yes?”
. Harry had been caught red-handed. He managed to pluck an excuse out of his arse in the nick of time, luckily enough, his shock could be mistaken for embarrassment.
The cashier looked to be a slightly younger than Harry and had black hair with random streaks of colour brushed through it. He looked a bit shell-shocked to see Harry Potter in front of him. Normally, this sort of astonishment would annoy Harry, but Harry quickly decided that this man was attractive enough that maybe Harry didn’t mind the small amount of worship.
Harry grunted down at his mud-covered, gloved fingers. He’d been prepping the flower beds the whole morning. Soon they’d be ready for planting the actual flowers, he only had three or four more beds to set up until he was finished.
He tightened his fist over one of the glasses and lifted it to his eyes, seeing a label with scribbles written on it. He could hardly read It in the dark light, he squinted until he could finally decipher the name.
He dropped one of his hands from his head to rub along his neck letting his fingers run along his own body, falling from his shoulders to his chest to his stomach.
“I suppose so. But, you still love potions?”
He was probably judging Harry’s knobbly knees. Harry felt insecurity crawling up his neck.
Revealing Malfoy stood wide-eyed and open-mouthed staring at Harry.
Harry seemed to brace himself for Draco’s next sentence.
“Sorry, I was- It doesn’t matter. See you tomorrow, Harry.”
Harry paused and looked around the whole circle. No one unattractive was playing so he’d probably happily sleep with any of them, even the females. Harry had always found wizards truth or dare a weird experience, once the game was started there was a magical pact threaded into the rules where a player could not lie during a truth. It worked in a similar way to veritaserum, but the strange part is that the magic can make you answer truths that you yourself don’t even know the answer to. Somehow the magic can find the truth within the deepest segment of a person’s brain.
“No.” Harry cringed, why could he not stop lying, Malfoy obviously knew he had seen him last night.
Malfoy pumped the finger in and out, an obscene wet sound filling the room. Draco’s eyes drifted shut as a second finger was pushed into his hole, a low moan coming from his throat as he streched himself.
“Sorry what?”
“Can’t I just apparate?”
Harry stumbled out of his chair and bashed into the door on his way to the handle.
The plain brick walls poked at the corner of Harry’s mind. Did Harry know this place? Something about it stuck out like a sore needle. He chucked the paper down to the floor in frustration.
He settled on taking his time.
“Don’t thank me yet, I don’t even know how to get back.”
“Well done on your potion, by the way.” Harry awkwardly congratulated, holding his hand out to shake Malfoy’s. Malfoy let his eyes drop to Harry’s hand, eyeing the appendage for a few seconds before responding.
“Do you want to go first or shall I?”
He realised that he loved Draco Malfoy.
Draco lifted his hands onto each of Harry’s arse cheeks and spread them wide open. Leaving Harry’s tight, red hole straining against his skin for Malfoy’s inspection. Harry practically moaned at Draco’s hands gripping tightly (almost painfully) onto his arse cheeks.
He was going to get dinner with Draco Malfoy.
Oh no, Harry has been caught lol.
“I guess I’ll just let you cook then.” Harry had this stupid smirk on his deep pink lips, a stupid lopsided tug of his mouth. It made Draco’s legs quiver.
Hello!
Harry looked outside; it was early-ish in the morning. Enough that the sun still set a yellow hue over his partially completed garden.
He showed some teeth through a mischievous smirk before placing his fingers over Harry’s crotch and groping down onto his dick. Harry pushed his hips up and chucked his head back so he was staring at the ceiling. The blond massaged his fingers against Harry and Harry was sure he could come just from this.
“Please.” Harry repeated.
“Yes ‘mione. None of them were right. I’m sorry.” The three of them were sat in the estate agent’s office, Hermione and Harry on one side of the desk facing the agent.
“Have you ever bottomed before?” Draco asked.
Harry closed his eyes, pointedly ignoring Malfoy as he ran a dark-magic detection spell over the bin. He wound the dark string of magic around it, feeling out for any possible anomaly.
If anything, Harry was proud of himself. Malfoy had lied and was just as toxic as he was in school. And Harry had managed to get rid of him before it became anything more, getting the worst people out of your life was always healthy. Sure his emotions were all icky and mushy. But his brain was happy to have gotten rid of the pointy, lying, manipulative, narcissistic git
“You too.” Harry shook the agent’s hand back, a massive smile taking over his face.
“Anyways, now you’re on maternity leave, you can help me house search.” Hermione’s face lit up. She’d always loved interior design; she discovered her love for it when her and Ron had first moved in. Harry had supposed their house was
“How can someone be too smart to die?”
“I added cinnamon and chocolate into the oat mix, then coated the top in some icing sugar, otherwise I made it just how you do.” Harry took a bite of his own breakfast.
Harry chuckled.
Slowly, Draco’s head began to lower to Harry’s erection, his eyes never leaving Harry’s. When his head was directly above Harry’s tip, he stuck his tongue out slightly and gave it a small kitten lick, causing Harry’s tied limbs to thrash about wildly at the new sensation.
“Go do whatever you’re so excited about. I’ll cut this guy’s hair.” She lifted a section of his hair and cut it with a loud snip.
“But what about the photos? You were being given money.”
Harry didn’t dare react to Malfoy’s lips, which were tentatively massaging his own. A wave of annoyance overcame Malfoy as he suddenly pushed harder in an attempt to force Harry’s lips open.
He’d hoped that he would fall asleep quickly, into a comforting lull of dreams, but instead he’d been trapped awake, tossing and turning underneath his bed sheets. He glanced over to his alarm clock.
Once she’d left, Malfoy presumed his digging.
straight.
“No, I know that you’re an
Why was Malfoy so calm, shouldn’t he be gaping just like Harry? Did he not care that Harry was about to fuck a random stranger in a cubicle? Then Harry remembered he was polyjuiced. Draco wouldn’t recognise him.
There was no point in getting angry at Harry anymore, he wasn’t going to change, but sometimes Draco swore that he was either the dumbest man alive or was burning the breakfast on purpose.
to fantasise about sex with Harry, and that owning a café and spending his free time gossiping with the female workers about the celebrity section of the newspaper wasn’t really a very heterosexual pass time.
“Thanks Draco.”
He moved into the hallway and shuffled on a nicer pair of trainers, or should he go for the sneakers, maybe the ankle boots? No, of course not. Harry wasn’t really an ankle boot guy, he’d tried to kid himself for a while that he was, but he was just never cool enough for them. He tightened the laces of his shoes a bit too tight, his fingers quietly shaking.
“Yeah, I’m sorry, I just suddenly feel really, really sick.” Harry lied, clumsily pushing himself away from the table.
“Ladies first,” Harry opened his arm in front to let Draco enter first. Draco swiftly swatted him in the arm before passing through.
“Fuck.” Malfoy mumbled. “I can’t believe it.” He moved forward and pushed Harry’s hand out of the way, wrapping his own palm around Harry’s cock. Finally feeling Malfoy’s hand on his erection made him whimper, squeezing his eyes shut. “I have the boy who lived naked and hard for me.”
“Well, why don’t we do something more fun?” She chucked her arms out around her in emphasis.
Malfoy finally looked back up to Harry.
“Oh My God, Harry! What is up with you today?” Stephanie walked around her desk and strutted up to the bundle up nerves that Harry was. She snatched the scissors from his hands.
awkward.
Then he thought back to the night him and Draco had made love, the look of longing in his eyes, like Harry was the only man in the world. He had treated him so well, never pressuring Harry to do anything.
“Okay, Okay I get it. I’ll have a shower. I should have time.” Harry glanced down to his (slightly grimey) watch.
Was that an earthquake, or did you just rock my world?
“Hi Harry.” Greeted Hermione. “How are you?” She asked, coming to take a seat next to Harry on the hard-wood flooring.
“I thought it might be worth going muggle today.” Ginny suggested, pulling out of the hug. “Just so the Daily Prophet doesn’t have a field trip with an article about how were dating again.”
Harry’s stomach coiled in disappointment, surely Cole would understand.
“It got out of hand one day. My boyfriend was stabbed, and I couldn’t take it anymore. That was why I moved to England. To get away from it all.”
Harry took a step closer to Malfoy, a bit unsure on whether he should be taking his shoes off.
to tell me about it.”
“And we got into an argument. Broke up, I suppose. Although I’m not too sure if we were ever really a thing to begin with.”
He tugged himself up off of the floor and left the room, leaving the door slightly ajar, just as he’d found it.
“Have you ever been here before?” Harry asked.
Of course, the smell of burnt bacon was what had woken Draco up that morning.
The two spent the rest of the night filing through cabinets and making a final double check. Malfoy’s nerves were still set on end and it made Harry’s heart ache.
The sky was dark as coal by the time the two left the skate rink, a waft of cold air chilling them to their bones.
“I would hope so, I spend enough of my time there.”
“Maybe we should swap games.” Catherine suggested. The whole circle looked around in mutual agreement. Harry didn’t particularly mind missing his go, he was always bad at coming up with dares anyway.
They were quite nice, he supposed, a dark leather jacket with dark jeans with a button up top. Not too different to what he normally wore to work, but Draco insisted they were “completely different to your work clothes” and that Harry just didn’t “Have an eye for fashion.”
“I never wanted to be a drug dealer! I just got sucked up into it.” His breath shook. “I was the lowest rank in a ring bigger than I’d ever imagined.” Malfoy explained.
“Im going to make you cum so hard.” Malfoy absentmindedly rambled, stroking his hand up to the tip of Harry’s cock and back down. “Then you’ll fuck me… yeah, would you like that Potter?”
“He must’ve drugged you or something!” She chuckled,  “To think that Draco ferret-face Malfoy would ever even think he’s good enough for you.” Harry felt a large frown pull at his face now. Who did Ginny think she was? Making fun of Draco like that? “Are you sure he didn’t slip you some amortentia, I wouldn’t put it past him.” Now Harry could feel anger bubbling under his skin.  “He probably has some anyways, didn’t I tell you that he was a prostitute?  How ironic, right? You definitely dodged a bullet there!” Harry couldn’t listen to it anymore.
“Of course.” Harry presented his arm, revelling in the warmth of Draco’s touch as their arms interlocked.
“I can’t imagine he wouldn’t. I look exactly like every Malfoy to ever exist; it would be hard to not believe after I easily walk through the wards.”
He wanted to say hello to a woman he hadn’t seen since he was a baby.
“Oh, Sorry.” Harry began, “It’s just that I-“
Harry only nodded in reply, an audible gulp echoing from his throat.
“Hello Mia, lovely to meet you.” Draco walked forward to her, took her hand and bent down to kiss the back of her knuckle. “It’s Draco.”
“Shut up Cole.” Malfoy scolded.
“Perfect.” Harry muttered.
“Good?”
“How was it? The blowjob, I mean.” Malfoy asked, shuffling around in his seat, he suddenly looked quite uncomfortable and Harry’s reddened complexion was probably quite telling of his  own current predicament.
He looked down to the tip of his wand, hovering millimetres above the glass.
Now the crowd had moved, he could see the man didn’t look anything like Malfoy. He had the blond hair, but his face was less sharp, still defined though. He wasn’t quite as tall as Malfoy nor as skinny. Arguably, he was more attractive than Draco. What was Harry saying, of course he was more attractive than Malfoy.
“Hi Harry.” Ginny greeted, red lipstick outlining her lips. Harry welcomed her inside moving out of the way of the door to let her through. “Oooo it looks lovely in here. Someone’s been busy.”
“Fate really was in my favour.” Harry interrupted, flashing him a smile. Cole was oddly endearing.
Were Harry’s pants… sticky… and wet. Harry pointed his panicked eyes to the ceiling and raised his hands into a prayer.
Harry began setting up his station, moving the scissors and cans of gel and spray around until his first customer arrived and walked up to Stephanie to book.
“Malfoy!” He shouted again.
He spoke to the girl for a few minutes, she had a similar style to Cole with black hair, but she had pink streaks dyed into it. She also came with a personality on par with an energizer bunny.
“It looks great. There’s obviously still parts that need some work but…” Harry started biting on a loose fingernail. “I don’t know what to do with one of the rooms.”
No. Harry Potter does not cry.
Oh Merlin. Now it seemed so obvious. If Harry was
“Let’s head inside then.”
“Don’t worry, I won’t look.”
Is there a bell? No, no bell.
“Nothing more than a whore, letting me fuck you like this.” Harry’s hand falls into rhythm with his thrusts. “And you love it, having a little slut. Don’t you?”
He moved his fingers up to the buttons of his shirt and slowly turned around so that he faced Cole. Cole’s eyes were harshly focused on Harry’s calloused fingers. He undid the buttons at an excruciatingly slow pace, revealing his chest inch by inch.
Malfoy was wearing a simple white button down that had just one two many buttons undone for Harry’s sanity. Paired with what appeared to be a pair of brightly coloured trousers. Which in theory, should have looked silly and overtly feminine, but somehow, Malfoy had managed to pull off the form-fitting pants.
“I thought you were a top. Why would that matter?” Draco asked, making Harry splutter in his seat. He went mildly red.
“I knew you hadn’t skated before, but I didn’t think you’d be quite this bad.” Harry teased – but he lied - he was just as bad as Malfoy when he had first skated. He couldn’t recall letting go of the support bar the entire time.
“You don’t have to say yes but… It’ll be good for you, trust me.”
They both looked up at each other, making eye contact as Draco slowly pushed his hips forward.
“It’s a little girl.” He told her; her face immediately lit up.
The offer tugged at Harry’s heart strings, he wanted to accept, he really did. But he knew he shouldn’t.
He rolled around in bed, confused when his sleek bedsheets were a ghastly Gryffindor colour. He wrinkled his nose in distaste before remembering who’s bed he was in.
“Why, I thought you’d never ask, Potter!”
“No!” Malfoy exclaimed. Now Harry could see how Draco’s eyes were beginning to dampen, he looked torn.
The bleeping stopped.
They stayed in silence for a few painstakingly awkward seconds.
, a good
“Sorry! Sorry!” Draco squealed, pushing himself up onto his hands, he grimaced and clutched his forehead again. “Are you okay?”
“Okay, I’ll just have a lager please.”
They walked towards two soft, leather brown sofas that were placed opposite to each other, with a small oak coffee table separating them before sitting down. Harry took off his jacket and chucked it to the other side of his sofa.
Harry turned and led Malfoy across the road, ignoring the gaggle of confused muggles staring at him.
Harry let his eyes flutter shut once again as he adjusted to the fire inside him. It wasn’t as painful as he thought it’d be, and the pain wasn’t unbearable, especially as a twinge of pleasure began to twinkle in.
“No!” He stood up from the circle, abandoning his presents on the ground. “You need to stop.” He looked to Draco, “You don’t deserve anything bad, no matter what happened when you were younger, and I hate that you think that you do. Because it hurts, Draco, to hear you put yourself down constantly. Just because of the bloody war. Truth is, there were no winners or losers there. There was no good or bad side, just people trying to survive. And you got caught on the wrong side. That’s all. And it’s a load of shit-“
“If you want to.”
“Oh wow, we could be gym buddies!” Andy proposed, leaving Draco with a distasteful smile on his lips.
He flicked the tip of his wand and suddenly Harry’s legs were tugged into golden restraints against the other two posters of the bed, forcing him to be spread eagle in front on Malfoy. Malfoy’s eyes moved to focus on Harry’s crotch, intently examining the large bulge.
Draco turned to look at Harry’s latest chosen prey. He was the complete opposite of Tim. He was taller than Harry (he looked like he could be a famous basketball player for Merlin’s sake), with washboard abs on his stomach, his hands were huge, and his teeth were perfectly aligned in a bright, straight smile. The only thing that never changed between Harry’s toy boys was the beam of blond hair, although this head was more sandy now that Draco looked.
“Whatever helps you sleep at night.” Harry felt his ears burn. He didn’t even know why he was acting so immature. Maybe seeing Malfoy again had brought back some old, repressed memories.
“Interesting.”
The pressure in his head was building and building, it had been since they’d left the Leaky. It was insufferable.
Harry felt his prick twitch in approval of Malfoy’s movements. He tried to make himself look away; he really didn’t need to have a bloody hard-on from the thought of Malfoy.
Harry suddenly froze. Was it that obvious? What if Cole could tell they’d had sex when Malfoy got here? Harry felt red rise to his cheeks as memories of Malfoy on top of him flashed into his mind. Cole acknowledged his freezing with one raised eyebrow.
He lifted his hand to the wood door and knocked three consecutive times.
Draco suddenly realised what his admission meant. He’d just admitted that he’d put his own fingers up his arse before.
Harry suddenly realised that he was hard as well.
“Are you sure you didn’t like any of the houses, Harry?” Hermione pleaded, he felt bad to refuse her again, but Merlin knew that this should be his decision.
“I believe you’ve got a basement to show me to.” He asked with an exaggerated wink.
Harry looked up at him, in shock at how late it was.
Harry tipped back in the bed, an attempt at distancing himself from the blond.
“Of course.” The two linked arms and with a pop and the twist of air, they were both in Malfoy’s bedroom.
“Look who’s back!” She greeted, then in a hushed tone, “How’d it go, did you have sex?”
Malfoy liked when Harry bit his lip, so he tried it with Alex. He managed to get out a small grunt, Harry moved his tongue along in time. To the left, to the right, maybe a swirl.
Wait…
“And hopefully, Lucius believes us.”
Harry opened the door to his house and stomped his feet against the doormat.
Draco pressed a peck to the top of Harry’s head, brushing his thumb back and forth over the back of Harry’s hand. Harry could feel Draco’s smile against his head.
“Can you please explain what’s happening?”
Feel free to comment or other stuff if you want, it makes me happy :)
“What’s a-“ Harry asked, even though he was ninety-percent sure he knew what a bottom was.
“Hello Harry!” Hermione greeted with a massive grin. She had two oversized oven mits covering her hands. “Are you excited?”
“I’m guessing that it didn’t.”
“You are not decent, Potter! You are half-dressed!” He shouted.
Draco fell silent.
“What?!”
Harry quickly shunned his head down, hiding his now reddening cheeks. So Malfoy didn’t watch the vision.
Ginny lifted Rose out of Harry’s arms and moved to sit back on the sofa adjacent to Hermione.
“No! Draco! Be subtle!”
“Sure, but I’ll pay next time.” Harry settled, if Lucius was technically paying for the meal, then he would let him.
“You’ve really never been to a muggle hairdresser?” Harry asked as Draco picked up a can of hair spray and sprayed it into the air, grimacing.
“Now, shut up and teach me how to play this thing.”
“No.” Malfoy tugged Harry’s hand off of him. “I need to check that nothing else has been taken.”
That was really Harry’s biggest reason for not dating around since his school days. He knew that a partner would expect the world from the boy who lived, and when Harry would never be able to live up to his name, they would be disappointed, and there was nothing Harry hated more than to disappoint people.
Today
They were silent for a few seconds.
Harry gripped Draco’s chin with his free hand and turned his face towards him, so that their eyes were closely locked.
Harry looked away and around his room again, moving to unpin his only other human portrait.
“No I didn’t.” Harry interrupted. “I never hated you.” Malfoy’s eyebrows furrowed.
“It just didn’t sound very… consensual from where I was standing.”
Draco rolled his eyes, pulling his chair out and sitting down in front of the well-prepared breakfast. He had to say he was impressed, everything looked perfectly cooked and smelt obscenely delicious.
“No.”
Harry went back up the staircase and began the search around his house. He double checked the kitchen.
His mouth dips to the hollow of Draco’s throat as his hands slip between Draco’s cheeks and brush over his hole.
Harry walked past Draco to stand in front of the large fireplace.
“That is the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard you say.”
“These are all my friends, they’re cool.” Cole informed Harry, quickly grabbing his hand and wrapping his own in Harry’s. What had happened to the awkward boy he’d met just yesterday?
“What do you want?” Malfoy started. “Do you even know what you want?” Malfoy took a few steps closer to Harry, forcing the man to step back with every movement until Harry’s back hit the wall.
Harry chuckled with endearment.
“No!” Harry immediately shouted, swatting Malfoy’s hand away from him. “Get away from me!” Harry swatted Malfoy’s body away until Malfoy was stood up and out of the bench. Harry pulled his own body out. “I don’t even want to sleep with you Malfoy.”
“I’m a fully trained Auror, I’ve obliviated hundreds of muggles before.” Lucius looked over to Malfoy.
-death eater. I know that you saved lives Draco. I read your trials. You weren’t guilty.” Harry gripped his shoulders tighter, shaking his torso. “Your past doesn’t define you.”
And he
Harry had a strange, mischievous smirk coating his face.
“Please Malfoy.” Harry repeated, an ache running from his crotch up through his entire body.
When they were finished, Malfoy asked to stay at Harry’s house, he explained that he was too scared to be left alone in his house when someone might be out there waiting for him. Harry didn’t really believe him but accepted, nonetheless.
“It’s understandable.” Hermione comforted.
There was a strained silence, Draco wasn’t sure if they were whispering or if Tim had left.
“No!” Harry glared at Malfoy, his heart beating a mile a minute.“Just tell me!”
“Oh Merlin!” Draco practically screamed as he ground down furthur onto Harry’s cock. “You’re so fucking big Oh Mother of Merlin Christ, Harry!” Draco moaned, slowly lifting himself up an inch off of Harry’s cock and whimpering at the emptiness only to drop himself back down. Both boys groaned.
Because it
He knelt back down and leant his arm under the bed frame, wrapping his palm around the metal box.
“Hmm, I see. You boys best come in. I’ll get the elf to make some tea.”
Draco looked up in question.
“Actually… I have no idea… I suppose for making things awkward.”
Harry glanced down to his drink. So, is the really what the saviour of the wizarding world does in his free time now? He let out a chuckle at what his life had come to. Stalking his childhood enemy.
“That’s really inspiring, Draco.”
Suddenly, Draco speared his tongue inside Harry, the wet muscle being accepted inside him with little resistance.
“No.” Harry interrupted, lifting his finger to shush Draco. “Show me.”
“Maybe I don’t want to go back, Malfoy.” Harry revealed. Malfoy’s mouth fell open and then closed again like a fish.
Draco dropped his spoon back into the bowl with a clang, splattering some of the oatmeal.
Shortly after moving to muggle London, Draco had discovered a love for coffee and used the last off the money his Father offered him to buy a quaint, little coffee shop.
“Can we not use another time turner?”
Draco tongues into Harry’s sit, licking up the pre-come that had spilt out
There was no response.
“Don’t worry.” Harry stroked his cheek. “We can stop if you want t-“
Harry finished the rest of his breakfast in a comfortable silence whilst Ron told them about his new cases. He tried to listen,
Narcissa stood tall and closed her eyes. Draco’s lips wobbled.
Harry rubbed his fingers about the chicken scrawl like writing.
“He offered me a drink and, whilst he was making it, I saw a small notepad on his desk. When I opened it, it was filled with potion recipes. New ones. That would be worth millions.” Malfoy’s comforting rubbing stopped. “When he came back, I drugged his drink with Somnomsatanas to make him fall asleep. It worked.”
“No, there’s extension charms across the whole cottage.” Hermione’s eyes practically bulged out of her head.
“You can’t show someone around when you look like you’ve just been dragged through a bush.”
. Which was what Draco was, a good
“Did you see that article about Malfoy in the Daily Prophet last week?” She asked innocently, Harry suddenly felt his body stiffen as his mind was kicked back to Malfoy. “I could hardly believe it when I read it though, it seemed more likely that Umbridge would’ve become a stripper than Malfoy become a rent boy.” Harry felt his throat go dry. Could she tell that Harry had thought about the article a lot? Was it that obvious?
Once the delivery men had left, the whole process had sped up ten-fold. The three of them managed to wingardium half the furniture in and make the rest of it weightless, meaning that most of the rooms were filled within the hour.
He walked down past the brick walls, an odd sensation of cold overcoming him and the sound of waterdrops filling his ears. A warm light shone out from behind the grey darkness of the walls from a thin door aligned to the end of the alleyway, opposite to the pole Malfoy had been pictured leaning against. This was it, where he’d finally pay Malfoy to be his.
“Draco, can you put that newspaper away? You know I hate it.” Harry asked, Draco ignored Andy when he wrapped his arm loosely around Harry’s shoulders.
“Malfoy!?”
The line was so long tonight that they had decided to disillusion themselves and sneak past, he was sure there was no way that this could break the statue of secrecy, just maybe some common courtesy unwritten laws. It’s not like any of the muggles would know.
Harry looked down between their bodies for a moment and Draco felt the tip of his erection align with his entrance. Draco gripped his arms, felt the strength of them, Harry’s whole body was vibrating with tension, and then he pushed forward, and Draco’s mouth dropped when he felt the stretch. The two let out matching groans when the head submerged itself through the tight ring of muscle.
The club was very different to any other that Harry had been to. Most clubs he’d visited had a humid and smoky air hanging around and the dance floor would stink of piss, sex and alcohol. However, this one had somehow maintained an element of class.
“Lucius Malfoy is busy; he does not wish to see you.” Dobby explained, suddenly slamming the door in Malfoy’s face. Malfoy stared at the door in shock.
“Of course not, you idiot. I mean, it would just be a good thing to actually talk to the girl. You used to be really good friends.”
But Harry felt no grumble of excitement in his belly, instead, he just fell the low mumble of indifference. He sadly took a bite of his sandwich.
“Oh right, yeah.”
Harry let his mind linger on the night before. How much had Harry had to drink? Had he had enough to mess with his mind? Maybe Harry had been so drunk he had simply imagined Malfoy. Maybe it was another blond boy? No, of course it wasn’t.
“You should go home. You shouldn’t be tiring yourself out like this, especially not so close to your due date.” Harry fretted. “Oh merlin, I shouldn’t have made you paint the whole house by yourself.”
In the distance Harry saw a newspaper store with a few copies laid out at the front deck. He jogged up there, apologising to a few muggles he knocked into. Once he arrived, he picked up the paper.
The day had been almost too perfect thus far; he’d woken up on time, managed to not burn his toast, had made an extraordinarily good cup of coffee (good for instant coffee anyways), arrived to work well dressed and in a good mood, been greeted by his secretary with a perfectly buttered croissant, and to top it all off, the weather was satisfyingly warm with not a cloud in sight.
I'm trying to think of another AU to write, I don't know what length I want to write but I imagine any new fics I write will be on the shorter side. :)
“Why don’t ya look at that.” Harry looked around the lab. “It looks great Malfoy.”
As if it wasn’t bad enough to have this weird infatuation with Malfoy – of all people – he was starting to return to the state of a hormonal teenage boy. This was unbelievable. He let out a deep breath, some of the shame leaving his body along with it.
Harry only ever asked him to hide The Prophet when he’d brought home a muggle. What was his thing with muggles recently? The past five he’d brought home were all muggles.
When he took the first bite, he could’ve sworn all the butterflies had flew up to land on his taste buds. It was even better than how Draco cooked it.
Suddenly rays of light shot through the room as a large glass window was exposed, somehow there was not even a single smudge on the glass.
“Fuck!” Malfoy moaned, rushing his own hands down to cover the plug, as if he was protecting himself. “Fuck.” He repeated. “It feels too good, I can’t…”
Within a few seconds, the boys were practically forced into a closed-mouth, tight-lipped peck.
“Well, I mean, after being manipulated into being a death eater,” Draco nodded, “To be proven innocent after the war and have created this potion. I think you’re a real inspiration Draco.”
Draco turned his body around and without looking at either Harry or his date, he sat down at the table.
“Take the time turner, lets go down to the apparition point, we might even catch him during his lunch break if we get there fast enough.”
Harry stared at the oakwood door, he doesn’t know what he’d expected to happen, of course Dobby wouldn’t hug him back. Dobby hasn’t even met Harry before. Harry doesn’t even exist yet.
“No. I like it. I like being hard all day, wishing you could just wank off. So then at the end of the day, when you think you can’t take it a second longer, you will have the best orgasm of your life.” Malfoy explained, moving his hands down to cover the tip and rub, giving himself the smallest amount of relief. “Do you like that Potter. Knowing that I’m hard for you all day.”
“Where’s my tea then?” Malfoy raised an eyebrow.
“Don’t worry Harry, you can always just plant some roses and tulips in the drier parts of the soil.”
Harry lifted one finger to dry his cheek.
“Did you really pick the only guy that looks like Malfoy in this whole club?”
“I got your letter.” Harry announced, deciding to rip the bandage off instead of suffering through trivial small talk. Draco didn’t seem too shocked by Harry’s question, instead a prick of hope bled into his expression.
“Muggles are weird.”
Harry became very aware of how weird this situation was. He was giving Malfoy advice about his relationship, whilst in the body of who he was giving the advice for. His life never did cease to end up in weird directions.
Harry rolled his eyes with a laugh, before gulping down his own helping of bacon.
“We can talk about it now.” Malfoy offered, taking a step closer to Harry. Harry took a step back, cornering himself against the wall.
And as if Merlin had arranged the whole situation with his own hands, the bell of the door rang and the blond stepped through, his eyes darting to Cole. He grinned a quick smile to the man before his eyes dropped to Harry and Draco’s plump mouth fell open in shock.
After renting their skates, Draco was quick to put them on, Harry could sense the excitement from him, even if he were trying to play off.
“What do you mean?” She questioned.
And whilst calling yourself a whore may have only been as adventurous as going for chocolate (it was no bubblegum), if you’ve only had vanilla your whole life, chocolate can be a real shock.
Draco’s eyebrows flexed in thought. “Can you pass me that bandage?”
Harry blushed, was he really this bad?
“How’s it look?”
“I’ll see you soon.” Draco backed away, let his arm fall and walked up the stairs, leaving Harry alone. After a few seconds, Harry heard an echo of the front door closing.
“Why? It’s only seven pm, surely” Draco could feel Harry roll his eyes.
He had a very attractive man stood in front of him, watching from only a hairs width away as Harry judged the bathroom décor instead of him.
He’d just walked in on his best friend having sex, and now he was hard.
. He looked a
“What are we doing today then?” Malfoy asked, after a moment.
In return, I offer you: the next chapter.
Harry pursed his lips.
If only he’d insisted that he didn’t want to sleep with Harry, then maybe they would’ve carried on as they were. These thoughts were keeping Draco up late into the night every day since.
It took three days before Harry heard anything from Malfoy, and when he did, it was unexpected.
“It was my fault. I didn’t think things through. And I constantly lied to him. I thought he would never catch on, that I’d be able to draw these circles around him to make him forget how bad of a person I am.” Draco was scratching at his arm now, right where Harry knew his dark mark would be.
He waited for another five seconds before realising that nothing had happened yet. He cautiously peeked out of one eye to see Malfoy, with his lips parted and eyes wide, staring at Harry’s erection.
“So, you want to pay me thirty-thousand galleons for this property?” She asked, cradling her hands around her cup.
“But why do I need it. I thought we were going muggle again?”
It really was a wonderful thing to feel someone’s muscles contract around you during an orgasm.
Draco looked at him with sympathetic eyes.
Why did Draco need his wand, he could’ve easily cast that wandlessly?
Harry coiled back out of the bin to see what Malfoy was swearing at.
“Doggy would be less painful, but I think I would die if I couldn’t see your face whilst you came.” Malfoy explained, lining his aching cock up against Harry’s loosened hole.
“Like what?”
“Then, sure. I’ll go on a date with you this Friday.” Harry accepted. “See, it’s that simple.”
“What?”
“Yeah.” Harry agreed.
“Thanks… Draco.”
“Yes you did. We were enemies.”
Initially, the estate agent was almost ecstatic to see that she could have Harry Potter -The Savour of the Wizarding World – as one of her clients, but after a few hours of watching Harry grumble, she had gotten decidedly fed up.
“You’re tellin’ me!” Ron answered, swinging through the open door to slam into the kitchen. “At least the ferret got what he derserves, right?” He joked, swiftly kissing Hermione on the cheek and sitting down across the table from Harry.
Draco moved his hand away from Harry’s hips, which immediately sent Harry’s hips bucking like crazy, fucking Draco’s mouth like he was a sex toy.
When Draco imagined the beautiful sound of his name falling from Harry’s lips, he felt his orgasm fast approaching. Once he sped up his hand to the point that his wrist ached, he couldn’t hold back any longer and he saw white as come splattered out of his cock onto the flooring in front of him, covering the wood in lines of white spunk.
“How long do you think it’ll take to set up?”
“Don’t worry, there’s a silencing charm around us.”
“Oh, what a shame! What was the other guy like?”
“It was worth a try.”
He paused his actions, looking over to the alarm clock on his bed side cabinet.
Cole’s eyebrows immediately shot up, his lips falling into a momentary frown before he caught himself and referred back to his usual kind but indifferent expression.
“Play a what-what.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Mother.” Draco shouted down the hall. “Where would she be?” He muttered. “Narcissa! Cissy! Mother!”
“The night shall never end!” Draco shouted, slamming the door behind himself, he dug a bottle of champagne out of a brown bag and immediately set to pulling the cork out of the top.
“Narcissa hasn’t gone crazy, then. May I ask why you’re on my doorstep?”
“It’s not what it looks like.”
But as soon as Draco’s lips met his, that fear was extinguished. Draco had timidly sat himself down next to Harry, dipping the sofa lightly, pressing an almost unsure kiss to his lips.
When he arrived, he slid into the plush, crimson fabric, letting his shoulder sink back.
Oh god Harry was about to get a blowjob.
“Why don’t you go sit down with your
“Two-thousand-and-four then, what’s it like where you’re from?”
“Thank you, Harry.”
“No, I guess I just… It’s a bit… weird, isn’t it.” Malfoy explained, slowing the knotting of his fingers slightly.
Andy was quite a vocal guy, he’d woke Draco up last night and was also the reason that Draco had come down to the kitchen so early. Draco had woken up this morning to the undeniable sound of morning sex between the two and couldn’t stand to sit in his room and listen, so he’d come downstairs, still in his pyjama bottoms and shirt to avoid the sound. He squinted his eyes at the man.
“James! Why are you ignoring me?” His eyes shot open, revealing the delicate face of Lily Potter. “Oh My God, I am so sorry!” She apologised, her hand covering a laugh. “I thought you were my husband!”
“I have to be honest; this doesn’t look good.” Lucius explained, moving his finger to wrap around the small hourglass, “But luckily, the hourglass is still intact. The sand within it is what contains the time magic, without it, you would have no chance of getting back.”
Draco did not work out for
“No…” Have stopped her. “I’m just being over-dramatic. He’s not any of that stuff. You’re right, he’s a slimy git.” Harry agreed, hating how his stomach flipped and his heart clenched at how wrong it felt to call Draco that.
Harry re-evaluated himself in the mirror. He looked good. Well, he thought he did anyways.
This time it was Harry’s turn to comfort, he wrapped his legs tighter around Draco and lifted one finger to stroke the hair out of his eyes.
Draco attempted to stop the spinning by grabbing the timepiece with his hand. A horrific sizzling sound erupted, Malfoy screeched and clutched his wound, accidentally dropping the glass in the process.
The house watched on in silence.
potion. Harry had read an article about it in the Prophet only a few weeks ago. An underground ring of Somnomsatanas was being dispersed, it was known to knock out the patients cold, stronger than any sleeping spell out there. It’s theorised that they would be under until an antidote was delivered, but no antidote had been found yet, leaving hundreds of bodies in storage at St.Mungos.
“You did show me the basement.”
“So, you can fix it?” Malfoy asked.  Lucius crunched his nose in a very un-Lucius like manner.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You can tell, it looks amazing.” Harry nodded along with her, skimming his eyes across the front page.
“Who knows… What’s your name?”
Memories of how Malfoy and him had had sex for the first time here flashed into his mind, a small smile forming on his lips.
Harry snorted, “You got that right.”
Harry skated closer and took a deep breath as he wrapped one arm around the man’s waist.
“I know.”
“Are you sure you’ll be able to do all of that Harry?” She asked.
Harry flicked his eyes up to the actual article.
“Are you sure you’re okay?”
To answer his question, after Draco had selected a pair of trousers and a shirt, he turned around to face Harry, his achingly hard cock arched up right towards the ceiling.
“No, I’d say about ten days, at least.” Pansy argued back.
“Unfortunately, that picture’s a few years old, since then the property has been abandoned. The previous owner’s daughter has been trying to sell it off like it’s the plague – she’s actually only a week away from her deadline to pull it off the market.”
The kiss suddenly became frantic, as they swept their tongues wildly together, twisting and sucking and Harry had never felt anything more wonderful in his life. He felt the other one of Draco’s hands curl around his neck, pulling him closer still. Harry couldn’t help but arch his body against the other man’s, a muffled moan vibrating through his mouth.
He dipped his finger back out, imagining it was Harry’s, and mimicking his thrusting motion. In and out, in and out, in and out, until Draco felt loose enough to push a second finger in, loving the obscene squelching down the lube made when he loosened his arse like this. Draco moaned, a bit loader this time, two fingers was when everything started to get good.
With out a word, Harry pulled Malfoy’s fingers out and dipped his own index finger into Draco’s ring, gasping at the warm, soft skin of Draco’s arse.
How had he lived here for two and a half years and hadn’t thought of that?
“You just left him there?”
He’d also begun drawing people, taking inspiration from a photo of Hermione and Ron he had placed on his work table. Whilst he had considered giving them his portrait as a gift for the birth, Hermione’s birth had been unexpectedly early – and Harry really wasn’t great at drawing people. It would probably be more of an insult to them than a complement.
“You think?” Harry’s heart began to flutter. It seemed be fluttering constantly over the past month, it was almost like his heart had cocooned into a butterfly.
“We have to wait in here until she’s done” Ginny pointed out, placing the kettle on the stove.
“Like what?”
“Just a gin and tonic and a pina colada.”
He started with his first meeting with Draco in diagon, then his rejection of Malfoy’s offer of friendship, then the endless school boy rivalry, then about finding Malfoy crying and almost killing him (which had extracted a gasp of disbelief from Cole’s lips), then Draco not giving Harry up to Voldemort, Harry saving Draco’s life from the fiendfyre, then of Draco’s sudden disappearance for years before seeing him in the daily prophet and being in shock that his prior hatred for the boy was now being replaced with a primal attraction to him.
“Trust me, a week’s easy, I’ve been here two and a half years.” Harry informed; Malfoy gave him a scornful look.
Until suddenly he was left alone with just the darkness and the warm glow from the streetlight, almost as if none of the past fifteen minutes had actually happened.
Draco took another bite of his pastry before placing it back down on his plate and gulping.
“But the Ministry? I thought you didn’t want them to find out?”
“Not really, I came here about two years back, with Malfoy actually.”
“I don’t think we have quite enough time to get into that.” Harry chuckled, leaning back on his seat, drifting away from Cole.
He kicked a small stone along as he walked, it jumped across each of the pavestones one at a time with Harry, turning into a game of endless push and shove. But somehow, the small pebble could bring his mind away from Cole and his stupid revelations, that all made Harry think that maybe Malfoy wasn’t that bad.
Harry stepped back from the painting and looked, it must’ve been his best painting yet. There was something new about it, fresh. And it made Harry’s heart swoon and eyes ache.
“Found something interesting?"
Harry smiled, Draco had this intense look in his eye, half between happiness and shock.
Harry untied it, ignoring how the owl’s legs fluttered under his touch.
Draco’s leisurely reading was soon interrupted by the loud sound of laughter from the door. It was a surprisingly masculine sound, a rumble deep in someone’s chest.
Draco glanced down at it and considered shaking it for only half a second before looking back up.
Harry pretended to be shocked, painting a bad attempt at surprise over his features.
“Oh, of course. That’ll be fine, I think. No one should be home tonight.” Malfoy’s face lit up.
What we thinking?
“I wasn’t lying about that.”
“Shit!” Harry shouted, collapsing down to catch the necklace before it shattered on the ground, but it slipped through his fingers, crashing into the concrete, and splitting into a thousand pieces. A flash erupted from the shattered turner, enveloping the two boys in its heat.
Also, it's mad how much the world has changed since I started this fic and now that we are all stuck inside in quarantine, I hope you are all doing okay.
“I’m not a good person Harry! And I never have been!”
“I can imagine.”
to go home.”
“No it does not.” Harry piped up now, an odd expression on his face. “Neither of us want anything to do with you Winston, I would really appreciate it if you left us alone.”
It was likely going to be the only time that he would ever see Harry in action. And if he was going to have this perverted, little crush, he may as well put the image to good use.
“It’s Har…vey. Harvey.” Harry lied through a straight smile.
“Yeah, just liked that.”
“Here.” Draco lifted his own hand to grab Harry’s and as soon as Malfoy’s grasp was in his, Harry pulled him forward so that he was standing between his legs.
“That’s not Mrs. Weasley.”
“Oh Merlin, who got you that?”
A clang and a bash echoed around the room until, in an instant, her body slammed through the door.
“Malfoy!”
“What’s your name, by the way?” Harry asked. The other man looked slightly surprised before smiling.
“-And I love you too.” It was small and uncertain; Harry wasn’t even sure if he’d heard him right. But he had to have done, otherwise his heart wouldn’t have exploded like it had. Harry smiled small against Draco’s chest.
“But that’s not what you want to hear is it?” Cole said, placing one hand on Harry’s shoulder as he turned to leave.
“You should definitely see him again, I mean, I would pay to watch this as a movie, you could make a whole TV series, maybe even a book.” Cole began, “I wish my life was this interesting.”
“Come on in, I’ll introduce you to everyone.”
“What happened?” Harry asked, “If you don’t mind me asking.”
“Does it feel good?”
The stall door flew open, and Harry hasted to push his cock back into his pants before reaching into his sock and pulling out his own wand, aiming it squarely in the face of the idiot who spelled the door open.
“Honestly, yeah. He’s too feminine for me really, I much prefer someone with a bit more… fight.” Draco turned back to the stove with a blush when Harry’s eyes dropped down to Draco’s chest. “Why haven’t you got a shirt on, anyways?”
He couldn’t help but feel the excitement bubble up in his belly, which he did think was a little odd as he didn’t ever get this excited when him and Ron did anything. The only time he’d ever felt this happy was when him and Ginny had first started dating.
“How can I help you today?” The man asked.
Soon enough a loud creek echoed from the hinges of the door and a blond head peaked from behind, his face suddenly softening upon seeing Harry, then swiftly contorting into a mischievous smirk.
He grinned at the four, shooting glances around the circle to catch their eyes, he didn’t manage to meet anyone’s attention, apart from Hermione, who smiled back at him.
Meanwhile, Malfoy had the biggest shit-eating-grin settled across his face. Harry pushed his eyes down to the floor.
(See the end of the chapter for
“That’ll be ten-pounds-fifty.”
“Ow!”
“Well it wouldn’t have been possible without magic. And you. And dropping my name about a thousand times but, I’m proud of it.” Harry grinned, only for his face to fall back into a frown. “It’s just a shame I have no idea what to do with this attic, or the basement.”
It had only been one week since Harry had seen Malfoy on the front cover of the Daily Prophet, but somehow the man had infiltrated Harry’s mind every second since. Everything around him brung his thoughts back to the blond.
“Then why do you want to go to a gay bar?”
Harry took a sharp intake of breath and felt the storm building in his stomach again.
Harry moved to one of the tables next to the window, two chairs were placed around a small square table. The chairs were coated in dark brown leather, studded with small gold pins. Harry took a seat in one of them and daydreamed out the window until his order came, along with a resigned-looking Cole.
Harry wanted to show that he wasn’t thinking about Malfoy so much that he didn’t even notice that the blond guy had come walking up to the table and was now stood next to him.
Draco heard Harry snort into his blanket.
Draco spluttered in disbelief, there was no way Harry was going to make him do this.
“Get away from there, Malfoy.” Harry sighed.
Once his nerves had calmed and he could take in his surroundings, he looked at the body in his office chair with a dumbfounded expression.
“Then keep it open. As long as you’re okay with that. Are you?”
Whilst Harry usually detested being called names, something about how dirty it sounded from Malfoy’s lips ignited Harry’s stomach as he thrusted forward into the blond’s hand.
Harry jumped back from the box, still holding the phial of Polyjuice potion in his hands. He looked up to Malfoy with wide eyes.
“Move that arse, love.” Alex whispered into Harry’s ear. It didn’t turn him on, for some reason, it just made his skin crawl. “I want to feel you.”
Harry’s whole-body bristled, making him almost too stiff to turn around.
Now he had a good few hours to get ready and attempt not to think about Malfoy.
“fuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuck!” Draco mumbled, an endless string of moans coming out with every rise and fall.
Harry moped around for a second before taking a seat at the table and picking up the newspaper.
Ron and Hermione had decided to go on a date for a change, as both of them had a rare night off work. But that meant that Harry was left at home alone with his mind, which kept straying back to the one person he had been trying to ignore all week. Bloody Malfoy.
“Here, I’ll help.”
He jumped mildly when the realisation hit him.
Draco kissed up Harry’s nose, then fluttered his lips across his forehead, then cheekbones, then ears, then jaw, then chin, the down his neck until Harry was sure his face was bright red with heat.
“Exactly.”
well. Until stupid
“You said it yourself, you liked being my whore… Changed your mind?” Malfoy asked with a mischeivious glint in his eyes.
Harry walked through the hallway into the livingroom, observing the place. There was a comfy looking sofa in the centre of the room along with a coffee table and a wide open window looking out on to the street. It must have been one way glass, Harry didn’t remember ever seeing this window when walking past.
Draco pulled himself over to Harry’s side of the bed and his eyes immediately jumped when he saw what Harry was holding.
“I imagine I will be rather good at this then.”
“Because I was assigned to your case!” Ron explained. “We found no evidence! The most incriminating thing so far is you sitting in front of me telling me that you were a prostitute.”
Harry’s eyes widened at the openness of Draco’s statement.
Although, Draco had noticed that Harry’s small, little touches had begun to get more frequent recently, he was touching Draco’s arms, back and shoulders at every chance he got. And Draco wasn’t one to object (obviously). But the chance for a kiss had never presented itself, every single time they had been interrupted or it never even happened.
Finally, after casting a drying spell, he picked up a white and painted a vignette over the drying paints. Illuminating the clashing colours with a white outline, shading it into the creases of what had previously been a dark green spike.
Both of their faces were slightly too slim, and their skin had a strange muddy tone behind the colours, making them looking tinged green. Hermione’s teeth had been a strange sort of barrier for Harry to paint, which had left her with a discoloured and wonky smile, outlined by a pair of far too thick lips. Harry had also drawn Ron’s nose perhaps a bit too long, initially it had looked fine, only slightly out of place, but the more Harry looked at the painting, the more it stood out like a sore needle.
He looked to his left and then to his right, the street was starkly empty, and rain was beginning to pelt down from the sky, turning the grey pavement colourless.
The tension seemed to lift slightly at the proposal of a new game.
Draco felt so full. Merlin… Harry was so deep inside him and Draco wasn’t sure he could cope with the sensation. It wasn’t that it hurt, exactly. It’s just that nothing – not even shoving his fingers up his arse – could prepare him for the feeling of letting another man do something so shockingly intimate to him. He felt so vulnerable that it almost overwhelmed him.
Malfoy suddenly winced, dropping his wand out of his hand onto the floor.
“Is this all because of your prissy friend over there?”
“Can we go back to the part where you said you’re a professional guitar player? Can you even play guitar?” Harry questioned, walking forward until he stood opposite Malfoy.
Malfoy’s eyes had dark shadows threaded beneath them, and whilst his eyes were still a striking shade, they had developed from their old neon silver to a deep granite-grey. His skin was paler and Harry was certain he could even see a few pimples bubbling up around his chin and hairline, surrounded by a small amount of blond stubble. Which Harry now realised had been scratching against his neck as he hugged him.
“Where’s Harry and what have you done with him?” Draco mused, unable to control his gaping expression. Harry turned around, a surprised smile on his lips as he waved the spatula in Draco’s direction.
I've actually finished my first ever fanfiction! Mad times isn't it.
“That’s nice to know…” Harry took a long sip of tea. “Speaking of, why don’t you tell me about your new, famous potion.” Harry smiled, Malfoy took in a deep breath and held it for a second.
“It was just am old ad on the wall, the house was only a week away from being taken off the market.”
Harry felt a smile tug at the corners of his mouth, but he pushed the bubble of laughter away.
. But not in a gay way
With his left hand, he ripped off his glove, easily grapping his other glove off with his right.
“You really are unbelivebly dense Pot- Harry.” Malfoy scolded. “I would rent it.”
And all couples had little blips, right? Sure, most of them were just arguments about family and not drug rings, but they were all still just little blips.
Harry was pretty happy with whoever he had polyjuiced into. He’d even congratulated Ginny on her pick. He was definitely more attractive than Harry. He was about half a foot taller and had lean muscle instead of Harry’s chunky muscle. His hair was the same shade as Harry’s but it was far more manageable, feeling silky in his hands and quickly settling into an effortless style that would take Harry at least two hours to recreate.
“What?”
“I’ll go make you some.”
He let out a deep breath and slowly lowered his hand to wrap around the base of his erection. He gasped at the needed contact, his cock leaking in response.
“Yep.”
He imagined Cole slowly taking off each layer of clothing, starting with slowly undoing the buttons of his t-shirt to reveal a long chest and stomach. Cole would crawl towards him, his eyes hooded and dark and straddle his legs around Harry’s knees.
“So, what do you work as then, Andy?” Draco pulled his morning cup of coffee closer to his body, stirring it with his spoon. Andy showed him a charming smile.
“Do you want it black?”
“Well, the case seems simple enough.” Draco announced.
And the thank you sex was great, in Harry’s opinion. Definitely worth it.
“It’s getting kinda late.” Harry began. “Do you wanna … stay?” Harry asked, fiddling with his fingertips, Malfoys eyes suddenly found their way back to Harry’s face. “I have a spare bed…”
“I said, bullshit.” Cole began. “Malfoy set the lab up in his house to be absolutely pristine perfect, there’s no chance it would break.”
“No they don’t.” Malfoy rushed. “The Prophet just theorised it. It was never confirmed.”
“So when can we have sex again?” Harry laughed, loud and bold. He was already getting used to being around Draco again, all previous animosity between them gone.
Harry sighed and walked back into the bedroom, when his mind flickered back to the metallic box underneath Draco’s bed.
“Thanks, but there's no needs for that, 'mione.” Harry interrupted, “I mean he’s not wrong after all, I am … gay” Harry paused, looking between Ron and Hermione, “and Malfoy appears to occasionally escort old men on dates. I can see the similarity.”
Suddenly, Malfoy’s signature scowl coated his features, reminding Harry far more of the schoolboy he’d been a rival of.
The squelch of it made Harry mildly uncomfortable.
The smell grew even more pungent, making Harry’s head swim, he could hardly breathe enough of it in, drowning in the scent.
Draco swiftly followed.
Just as Harry was about to complement the room, Malfoy had grabbed his arms and pushed him backwards to bounce on the mattress of the bed.
“Okay. The manor. That’s easy enough… How do you propose we get there?”
“Hmmm.” Draco obnoxiously slung his arm onto the other seat. “How about we go get a drink. The leaky should still exist, right?”
For some reason, Harry’s stomach tied itself in knots at the statement. Draco had remembered Harry’s favourite dessert. It was probably because he hated him. That was probably it.
“Fuck Me!” Harry screamed, waking up from his third wet dream/nightmare of the night.
“Yes?”
“I really don’t know what you’re-”
Draco whispered a quiet charm and suddenly his hole was covered with an oily liquid.
Draco felt a swarm of butterflies dance in his belly.
“About 30,000 galleons.” Her eyes seemed to comically pulse out of her skull even more.
“Really, interesting.” Cole smiled mockingly. “I thought you’d set up your old lab to be perfect.”
Harry nodded.
“I like it.” Malfoy announced.
Soon enough, Harry was beginning to thrust up into Draco’s hand, desperate for even more pressure against his dick. Malfoy just stared down at his hands with a mesmerised expression, seemingly amazed by the cock in his hands.
A rumble of laughter echoed through the room, shuffling out from Harry’s belly. Harry leant on his side, lazily smiling at Malfoy, moving one arm to rest on the man’s hard chest.
“It’s only 4pm, got any ideas?”
“Why, Merlin, why?” He muttered, looking down to his sopping wet t-shirt and underwear on the floor. “You are an idiot, Harry.”
Anyways, hope you like this chapter, feel free to comment or anything like that.
“It’s almost odd how little the Leaky has changed over 25 years, isn’t it?” Harry observed, sat opposite Malfoy on one of the bench tables.
Suddenly some sort of cloud cleared away from Harry’s view. Whilst he knew quite a few gay men, he’d never met someone who liked both. It felt almost comforting, like a warm hug.
Malfoy and Harry as… friends? Friends… Harry thought back to their Hogwarts days and he couldn’t even imagine what his life would’ve been like had he have liked Malfoy. Realistically, they definitely never could be friends unless Malfoy had a complete personality change. But for some reason, Harry couldn’t bring himself to say no.
Harry and Ginny swiftly made their way over to a table situated in the side of the club, it was piled high with empty drinks and was a bit too close to the dance floor but they were lucky to get a table in the first place.
Harry looked up to Draco’s face, expecting the schoolboy mockery to come now. He could almost hear the laughter already, surely Draco would turn his innocence into some sort of blackmail.
“I would, I need to check it’s big enough.” Malfoy’s eyes shot down to Harry crotch beneath the sheets. “But I’m pretty certain it’ll be big enough for me anyways.”
“Malfoy’s a big boy, I’m sure he can handle himself.” Kingsley’s face contorted, he seemed quite desperate now. “I’ll give you a pay rise if necessary?”
“Hey! I don’t want your help.” Harry scolded, using both his hands to bat her's away. She neatly rolled her eyes. “Other than this puzzle, I’ve got a free day” He answered, “Want to go out for a drink?”
“My turn.” Another girl shouted out, Harry thought she was called Alice, but he couldn’t be sure.
“Well you better work for it then.” Harry pushed his face onto Malfoy’s, wrapping their lips once again, except this time their tongues were both fighting against each other, making it fast and aggressive.
“Surely we aren’t going to go back to childish nicknames?”
He felt a small prickle of guilt when he saw Harry round the corner with hunched shoulders.
Merlin, that is ridiculously hot.
“Draco?” He shouted, “Dracooooooo!”
“What the fuck, Potter!” Malfoy brought a hand to his face, covering where Harry had slapped him.
Harry had been in a daze for the past week since he’d left Malfoy.
Harry wanted to pinch himself.
Oh no. what do you guys think is gonna happen? :)
“How did you hide so well?” Malfoy looked down to the table and leant onto Harry’s shoulder. Hermione raised her eyebrows high at the action. “We didn’t find even a drop of evidence.”
“Relaxing. I made a new painting.”
Harry felt as if their conversation had now lulled to it’s natural end.
He could see why Malfoy would think it was. She had bright red hair, was about the same height and had a large smile across her lips.
Malfoy clicked his tongue, walking into Harry’s bathroom to get changed.
Harry unconsciously swapped the hands for longer digits and swapped Alex’s fuller legs for one’s with leaner muscle. Suddenly, grinding against Alex suddenly felt a lot easier.
“How did you…?” Harry asked, aware that he must’ve been as red as a tomato, or as blank as a sheep.
Malfoy lowered his wand and lifted his hands up above his head.
“Do you think he’d take you back?”
It made Harry’s head swim.
“So, you don’t want to tell the ministry in case they find out you were a prostitute?” Ron asked, Malfoy watched his hands, curling into one another.
“Don’t worry, in the most modest way possible, it would be a bit weird if you didn’t.”
“Please!” Malfoy shouted, knocking harder on the door. “It’s Draco! Draco Malfoy!”
“Oh, umm, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to… go out tonight… and, maybe, have a drink.” Harry stuttered out. Ginny stared at him blankly for a second. Then let her eyes drift as she thought about it.
Harry felt his erection flip up against his stomach, an obscene slap sound filling the room. After a few seconds of silence, Harry moved his eyes away from the ceiling back on to Draco. He was sat on his thighs with a dazed expression in his eyes as he stared down at Harry’s cock, his plump lips slightly parted.
“Luckily enough I was expecting your arrival, so I’d prepared this for you already.” Malfoy explained, cleaning the orb that resembled those they’d used in Trelawney’s lessons.
He didn’t know why he was telling Malfoy about his problems.
“But I thought you couldn’t cook?” Harry raised his eyebrows, lips slightly parting.
“I mean, we’re just friends, right Harry?”
There was a short man with dark brown hair. His nose was small and upturned whilst the rest of his features were prominent and dark. It gave him an almost Peter Pan look that Harry thought was adorable. However, he also looked to be only just legal. So maybe a bit too young for Harry.
“I thought you would’ve waited a few days, you seem to wait for everything else.”
“Yes.”
… He was getting
“Sorry sir, it’s seven-thirty. We close now.”
Harry smiled into his own bowl of cereal.
“Where is the woman. Man need his food.” Ron said batting his chest like a Gorilla.
:) xx
“Malfoy.”
Harry reached his hand forward to turn on the kettle, before being swiftly interrupted by Ginny placing her hand on his.
“That sounds nice.”
Lucius stood and then sat back on his desk, opening a hefty book titled “The Treacherous Guide to Time Magic.”
Harry smiled at her, feeling an undying urge to burst into tears.
He dipped the glass under, filling it to the brim before taking six deep gulps, emptying it in seconds.
Harry felt another wave of jealousy pang him in the gut.
“I can't bloody believe it!” Ron spluttered out, toothpaste from his mouth forming projectiles as he spat across the kitchen. Harry saw Hermione’s nose scrunch up in the corner of his eye.
“Two pounds for a half-pint of Milk?” Harry tutted. “Rip-off”
“Rose Granger-Weasley.”
Harry read through the practically illegible scrawl and then stared at the owl, who was calmly waiting on the sill.
His lips crashed back against Draco’s, this time filling him with all the tension of the past two years, radiating from Harry’s body like waves. It made his head spin.
“Malfoy?” Harry looked around himself “Malfoy?”
“I didn’t know you knew Malfoy well.” Cole stated.
Just a few cauldrons and ingredient shelves
“Absolutely”
“I can do it.” Harry spoke up, Lucius looked Harry up and down.
“Am I really that obvious?” Harry frowned into his tea.
He settled on a casual pair of skinny-ish jeans, loose enough that removal would be easy but tight enough to have some appeal. Was he overthinking this? Oh Merlin he was stressed.
And he felt so
“What the fuck!” Harry screamed.
“What the Hell!” Harry mumbled. “How do they know where my house is?”
He heard the door open and then suddenly slam back shut.
“How did you end up coming to England then?” Harry asked.
Draco looked up at Harry with wide eyes, a small pink painting his cheeks.
“Haven’t got anything planned at the moment.” Harry informed, reaching down to pop another puzzle piece in place. They settled in silence for a few seconds before Hermione shot him a disapproving look.
“hmf.” Draco laughed. “Me… too willing to forgive? You must be mistaken.”
Harry was obviously just checking him out in an admiring, man-to-man way. There was nothing gay about it.
Harry could already feel the excitement for next Friday bubbling up inside of him, he felt like a teenager again.
“To hell with the rules Draco. I killed Voldemort, I don’t think some whores doovers are going to stop me.”
Harry rolled his eyes in content before finally finishing tying his skates.
“It’s a hard puzzle, ‘mione” Harry muttered, fingers scrubbing at his chin in concentration. He heard a small sigh from her before she turned back around and continued with cooking their breakfast, cradling a single hand on her heavily pregnant stomach.
They sat in a comfortable abyss of conversation for the next few minutes, dripping around random topics, like a muggle disease outbreak and an unsolved murder mystery before Mia brought it back to him and Malfoy.
Harry hadn’t noticed Draco walk in, and he was thrusting with endless stamina into the man. His cock sheathing itself in and out of his hole so fast that Draco could hardly even see it through the blur. His entire body was covered in sweat, leaving a satisfying glint of light against his toned stomach, contrasting the tantalising snail trail that Draco had spent oh so much time glancing at under Harry’s shirts.
“So…” Harry paused, placing his own tea on the coffee table. He stared down at the ankles on his lap before looking up and meeting Draco’s waiting gaze. “Do you think we could be more than this?” Harry asked, immediately looking away, hiding how anxious the question made him. He held his breath as Draco waited to answer.
“It is a bit.”
“Thank you.”
Malfoy revealed a glass orb and it’s stand from the box and placed in on the table.
Hermione was insistent that they should get the ministry on the case.
“Wanna grab a sofa?” Ginny asked, Harry replied with a nod.
“How did it get so wrecked?” Hermione asked. Mia sighed and pulled the kettle off the stove as it began to whistle.
“Okay ... Why are you so desperate to have him join, then?”
“The floor?”
“But that would be a lot of hassle and, I don’t mean to be a pain but…”
His fingers hurriedly raced to get to page three, slightly startling Mia, who flinched back.
Sleep was, decidedly, the worst thing Harry could’ve done. His dreams had supplied him with nothing but blurry images of a pale body and… Was that chocolate syrup?
“Why not?”
“How’d you find out about it?” Harry asked, simply. Best to start with the easy.
“Actually, can I have a look at the ad for that property?” The agent turned around to look at the dashboard. She shot Harry a confused look.
“I guess fate is working in my favour then.” He paused for a second. “Not that I’m excited to have you here it’s just that- I mean I am excited to have you here, but-.”
“Why? What do you have there that’s worth it?”
Harry shrugged but decided to shut his mouth before she changed her mind and rushed out of the barber shop to his apartment. He might even get there at exactly six.
He did miss Ron and Hermione a lot, though. He never let himself think about them too much, after all, he didn’t exactly have a way to get back to them. So, what was the point?
“That’s insane! You have to meet him! He looks exactly like you! The only difference is your eyes!” She examined, stepping closer to Harry in amazement.
Harry stared down into Draco’s eyes for a second too long, almost as if he had drowned in them.
Slowly, their laughter died out until they were both sat on the wood floor, only mildly aware of the other skaters around them.
Draco thrusted his tongue in and out of Harry’s arse, constantly bending and straightening the muscle, making Harry feel like he had vacated Earth and was now on his was to heaven.
“Don’t you have potions?”
“Are you not going to help make breakfast?” Harry asked, a tone of hope and sadness threaded through his words.
“I couldn’t wait to get some coffee in my system.” Harry lied, chuckling down Draco’s back.
“Yeah, it really does.”
Not much to say but please feel free to leave comments or kudos or anything if you like the work, it's a really good motivator.
“Oh god, yeah of course.” Harry blushed as he hurriedly pulled his legs away from Malfoy’s, immediately missing the warmth.  He should probably also get dressed and ready for work.
“Well, who’s next?” Cole piped up, looking around the circle. Pansy put her hand up, a glint of excitement in her eyes.
“What are you doing?” Harry croaked, his throat still dry. Malfoy just smirked and walked his hand up Harry’s thigh until it reached the zipper of Harry’s trousers. The small amount of friction against Harry’s erection from the denim made Harry let out a small whimper.
“I’m good at hiding things.”
Harry nodded.
He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, he couldn’t be sure if they’d stopped having sex through the door, or if they’d resumed the activity. The thought alone made Draco’s hairs stand on end.
Hermione looked between the photo and then the sketch, her distaste swapping for uncertainty.
“You were young. You had no choice-”
“Let go. I’ll walk you.” Draco shot Harry a doubting glance before finally letting go of the bar, his weight immediately tossed onto Harry, tightening his hold on the man. “That’s more like it.” Harry complimented, rubbing his hand lightly on Draco’s wrist in a comforting gesture.
“I must say, I hadn’t expected to see you here.” Malfoy informed, his tongue shooting out to wet his lips. Harry’s mind was suddenly filled with inappropriate images of Malfoy dancing against that man last night. He felt his cock twitch and internally groaned. No, he was not going to sit here with a raging hard-on opposite Malfoy.
. How strange.
“I can’t, I’ve got someone coming around to look at the basement at three.” Harry groaned, grimacing at his dirt covered hands.
straight.
Hence, Harry closed his eyes and tried to push down the embarassed squeal rising in his belly as Draco turned to face him.
“That wasn’t what I asked.” Draco moved his lips up to Harry’s jawline. “Is it soundproof?”
“No! Not at all! I came here to talk to Cole.” He explained. Whilst his original intent wasn’t necessarily to talk to Cole, he had spoken to the man, so it wasn’t really a lie. Malfoy’s eyebrows immediately furrowed.
Harry was head over heels for Draco, and he was too deep in to get out anytime soon.
Harry couldn’t chuck that all away.
In Draco’s brain, he knew waiting until morning would be best. Draco could spend the rest of his sleepless night planning what to say, he would meet Harry and explain how he felt in a perfectly curated monologue. Harry would be well-rested and would understand, and if all didn’t go well. Harry would be off to the Aurors anyways. It was the perfect plan.
Harry had to swiftly reposition himself as images of a Malfoy in compromising positions popped up in his mind. They needed to stop talking about Malfoy or else Harry might end up embarrassing himself. So, he looked down to his wristwatch. Ten pm. He supposed that would be a good time for them both to leave for the club.
“I, uh, you told me… in uhm…. Ya’know.” Harry stumbled, not sure what to say in the slightest. Malfoy’s knowing eyes boring into Harry. “I just thought… that maybe- uhm.”
“I’ve lived with him for the past two years and he’s
Just as Harry began planning which bush cutter to use, a blast of vibrant hair standing in front of his doorway distracted him, he could see the fluorescent red all the way from the gate.
“I’ll take a shower. Leave you alone for a few minutes.” Draco announced, turning towards the bathroom and grabbing his night clothes.
How do you think Harry will react to the letter? What do you guys think about Draco now?
Harry nodded, scared by how longing Draco’s eyes appeared to be.
difficult.”
“Yes.” Harry gulped.
“This should calm you down.” Alex began unbuckling Harry’s belt from his hips, tugging the fabric looser.
Harry’s eye’s flicked down to the sweet treat, and Draco wasn’t wrong. They appeared to be bigger than Harry’s hand, and there were four of them per plate. Four! His stomach let out a groan.
“Ew, gross.” She grimaced, turning to chug some of her tea. “Well, anyways, you should go get that shower now, you’re covered in dirt.” Harry groaned.
“You smell so good.” Malfoy whispered, pulling his face away from Harry’s balls. Harry felt a drip of precum leak through his underwear, his cock twitching in Malfoy’s direction.
And then Harry was back onto him, grasping his jaw and tugging the white shirt from his shoulders before tugging on the waistband of his pants. Harry quickly stripped off the remaining fabric covering Malfoy, leaving him bare and exposed, his cock jutting up to his stomach in a way in hadn’t since his school days.
Once they were both sat at the table, Malfoy settled on staring out of the window.
“I’ll help you.”
“What can I get ya?” He asked with a strong Irish accent.
“Oh.” Harry stuttered. “Malfoy’s not gay though?”
“Did he pay you to let him join the Aurors?” At this Kingsley showed a look of ‘really? I thought you were smarter than that.’
Mia’s face immdediately lit up a bright shade of red. “Oh my.” Harry had to ignore the swirl of jealousy that built up in his stomach.
thighs, practically every day is leg day for him.”
“So, I see you every single day.”
“Okay, maybe not but, how was it?”
The room filled with the organic smell of oak and peaches, blending in an intoxicating concoction.
“Yeah, it was very… unexpected.” Harry said slowly, hoping to not be caught out on how much he had to say about it. He began to shuffle his fingers, almost turning them into one large lump of skin and bone in the process.
“You look lovely.” Harry greeted, pulling himself up off the sofa. His lips were in a soft grin, making the deep red stand out against the white of his teeth.
Harry chucked his hands through his hair, pulling on the ends slightly for the smallest amount of stress relief. He raised his fingers to his temples and began rubbing them in circles.
His mouth dropped and his eye’s blinked wide open.
“That’s the spirit!” Hermione appraised.
“A sorry would be nice.”
By ten pm, Harry had decided that he was an absolute numpty. He had wasted his whole night just sat by himself, waiting for a man who wasn’t even here. What an Earth was he thinking? There was nothing apart from his Gryffindor stubbornness that had kept him at this table for so long.
“If the date is April of 1980 then neither of us will be born yet, correct?” Malfoy spoke up. Harry nodded quickly, not thinking to question why he knew Malfoy’s birthday by heart. “Which means that my Father should be about twenty-five.”
Harry decided that it would probably be a good idea to put on a shirt if he was sharing a bed with Malfoy, he dived back into the wardrobe in a search.
The fic is finished and I hope you have enjoyed :DDD
“Like what?” Draco turned to Harry for a second and rolled his eyes before turning back.
“Wait… Have you? No way!” Cole began. “You’ve slept with Draco.” Cole whispered at Harry.
“Merlin, I’m going to cum so hard.” Harry breathes. “I’m gonna…” He leans over Draco, hips taking short, rutting thrusts, his lips near Draco’s ear.
“You’re having your preview, of course.” Malfoy explained, like it was simple. He moved his fingers to drift over his leather jacket, toying with the buttons before slowly pulling it away from his torso.
Not when there was that much emotion pressing down against Harry, not when there was so much want reeling off of Malfoy. Not when Malfoy’s hands were running over Harry’s chest like he was the only man to exist.
“I just went back to bed.” Draco was surprised at how choked up his voice was, it hurt just to speak.
Harry turned his head,
Oh Merlin, Draco had to get away from Harry before he realised that Draco had a stupid, little crush on him. Not that Draco did have a crush on Harry.
“Lie down.” Draco commanded. Harry felt his eyes blow wide.
“Why does this always happen to me.” He whispered, swallowing his pride, and turning on the shower, putting the heat as low as it could possibly go. He refused to wank with Malfoy in the next room. So, his only other option was to will his erection away with icy cold water.
Draco let out small grunts of exertion and Harry cried out when Draco slammed into his prostate. He did it again and again and again. Until Harry was a mess beneath him, wrapping his legs around Draco’s neck to pull him in closer, the angle adjusting to push Draco in even deeper.
can play the guitar. It obviously isn’t
They both stepped outside and after locking the door, they went their separate ways, apparating away.
“Well done you blithering idiot, we won’t be allowed in now!” Malfoy cursed, knocking hard on the door again. “You can’t react like that to someone you know! It irrational and not to mention awfully plebeian.”
“Dear mother of Merlin.” Malfoy whispered. Harry looked up to Malfoy’s face to see his eyes sqeezed shut and his hands cast up behind his head.
Draco shrugged again. “Maybe I am straight, Harry.”
He soon reached the bar and only had to wait in line for a few minutes before the young bartender asked Harry what he wanted.
Kingsley cautiously looked around the room, before using his fingers to sign Harry to come in a bit closer. In a quiet voice he explained, “His mother is in st. Mungos, she’s very ill. Draco needs the money to pay for her treatment. Normally, I wouldn’t do this but… in exceptional circumstances…”
Harry made a swift turn to the direction of the bar. He decided to walk around the crowd of bodies on the dance floor instead of through them, even though it would’ve been a lot faster. But Harry didn’t feel like wrestling with crowds of bodies to get there.
“I was in a bit of a rush to come help you turn the alarm off.” He hoped the excuse wasn’t obviously fake, and by Harry’s silence, he presumed it was believable.
“What the hell are you doing Potter?” Malfoy asked, openly laughing at Harry.
Then he settled on fixing his hair. The black strands on his head had always been wild, especially in his youth, but now he’d learnt the magic of hair cutting spells.
She slid the small body out of her arms into Harry’s, the lightness of the baby almost shocked Harry, she was so fragile that just one of Harry’s fingers could probably break her. He shuddered at the thought.
The vision didn’t even compare to the real thing.
Absolute boredom.
Harry had a sudden flashback to last time he went clubbing. He’d ended up drinking to the point that he was flat out drunk and had apparently tried to dance on the club tables before being kicked out by security.
“Read through that and you can apparate there as soon as Malfoy arrives.”
“We can buy you a pint if you want?” James offered, “We’ve got a whole group, I’m sure we could spare a place.”
He felt a smile pull at his lips.
“What?”
Harry looked between the two of them, the small coffee table by his legs seemed to set Malfoy miles away from him. The distance was almost unbearable, Draco had waited for him. Been faithful whilst Harry had attempted to sleep with another man.
Harry reached past him to look further into the bin. “Wait, shit! What the fuck!”
“I wish I could fix this Harry!”
“What about the other houses I looked at for you in the folder?” Hermione practically begged.
Draco was over in an instant. For just a second, Harry was worried that it wouldn’t feel the same as it used to, that they’d stand staring awkwardly and that everything would turn mechanical – like it had with Alex just a few nights ago.
“Obviously.” Harry rolled his eyes, pulling a biscuit out of the jar behind him. “But I didn’t have the chance to until you got here today.” Harry turned around to pick up the jewellery box. “When I got here three years ago, I only had half the time turner, but when you got here today. The other half came with you.”
“I know.”
him. Maybe he could consider this a date.
“You know what I’m talking about.”
“Fuck you, Malfoy.”
“Umm… I guess so.”
Harry concluded that since half his childhood was spent sleeping in a cupboard, he could survive one night on the floor.
“Do you still like Malfoy?” Harry asked, Cole immediately chuckled down at the table.
“Yeah.”
He paused, sat back down on the staircase and fiddled with his lower lip.
“Well…” Draco looked everywhere around the room before deciding on his words. “I had noticed things had gotten awkward between us since Tuesday. I guess I wanted to apologise.”
Harry paused his monologuing and looked around at the circle. Everyone was sat pin still, Ginny had her mouth wide open and Molly still couldn’t move her eyes from the ground, but Hermione was sat with a small smile rested on her lips.
“Sorry, Harry. It’s my first day.” He smiled before turning on his heel and leaving to the break room.
Harry was silent for a few seconds.
. It was just a silly little party, and if things really got awkward, he was sure Harry would let him floo home early.
Harry paused to think. A strip tease wasn’t the worst dare, he supposed. In fact, he could think of ten worse things off of the top of his head.
Christopher took a big sip of the coffee before immediately spitting it back out into the cup. “Ew, what the fuck!” He grimaced, “That’s disgusting.”
“Just for a blow job?!” Harry exclaimed, quickly quieting his voice in fear of the silencing charm breaking.
“You have no idea who I just saw!” Harry feigned curiosity at her outburst. “Draco Bloody Malfoy.”
“How long for 500 galleons?”
Malfoy looked down at himself, undoing the buttons on his shirt cuffs. “You got any spare pyjamas?”
He flicked the book open to
Harry was sat on the sofa, and when Draco rounded the corner, a bright smile lit up his face.
Harry looked into Malfoy’s eyes, sensing the fear and taking it as a challenge.
“Scorpius Black.” He whispered
“Nice place.” Harry complemented.
“Trim it down into the same style, just more defined.” Harry nodded and picked up his scissors, grabbing a section of the man’s hair, when he noticed a single fluorescent earring in his left ear.
“Of course.” Harry smiled back. Hermione’s smile grew impossibly wider.
With that Harry went to the door and spent the rest of the evening at their house, celebrating Rose with the whole family, who each cooed over the baby one by one. George seemingly the most excited out of the family (at a close second to Ginny).
“What are you brewing?” Harry asked.
“Hi there, Ginny.” Harry laughed, tying his arms around her neck. Draco hated the pang of jealousy that rang through him.
“If you can pull this off Harry- it might actually be a beautiful house.” She complemented, piling similar sketches atop each other. “Very old-timey, traditional.”
Once Harry was under the covers with the lights off and Malfoy’s warm presence next to him, the aches in his body had finally eased.
Harry thought for a second, he didn’t have anything important to do, and he was far too excited by the idea of viewing the house to put it off to another day. He grabbed his quill once again.
He lifted his hand back up to Draco’s waist, but the movements unsettled the Slytherin. Draco’s intake of breath had thrown their balance, chucking them both to the floor.
“What.”
Harry cleared his throat.
Harry smiled when Draco’s skates slipped from beneath him, pulling his body away from the bar at a 45 degree angle. He slowly wheeled himself back up.
“Because otherwise, you won’t have enough energy for round two in the morning.”
Consenting adults are allowed to have sex.
But once again, his stomach ached when his hand neared the canvas.
“Really?” Harry stood up from the table, his chair screeching against the floorboards.
“What am I doing whilst you’re at work?” Malfoy asked. Harry covered his mouth with a hand whilst he spoke.
“I have no idea what any of those flowers are.” Harry replied, slightly put out by his ignorance.
“Look Harry, I don’t know much about relationships, in all honesty, and I’m definitely not the best person to be getting advice from, but from whatever little amount I know, you need to meet up with Draco again. In a non-sexual way.” Harry’s eye’s shot up to Cole’s, “It sounds like you mean more to Malfoy than just another client.” Cole explained, moving his hand off of Harry’s to pick up his tray and stand up from the chair.
He brung his hands to rest up behind his head and shyly rolled his hips from side to side along with the beat.
“Do what?” Ron and George asked in unison.
“Really?”
“And how do you know how I ate in Hogwarts?” He retorted; Malfoy had the decency to look caught out for second before he composed himself.
“Well I was think that maybe, I could give you a large discount for my services instead, ya’know.” Malfoy moved his fingers to run along Harry’s jaw line.
He thought about it for a second, he should probably play something cool and edgy, but the only song coming to his mind right now was Toxic by that muggle singer. He thinks she was called
“What?” He questioned; his fingertips were buzzing with shakes.
“I’ve lied to you, Harry.” Malfoy’s cheeks were stained with the wet. “I’ve done nothing but lie.” He shoved his face back down into his hands, his body shaking with a wobbly breath.
“Okay.” Harry replied, choosing to change the conversation topic. He awkwardly peered down to his watch.
Harry squealed when Alex’s hand reached behind Harry and squeezed his bum. Hard.
A new wave of sweetness came rushing through the door, the smell of crispy bacon suddenly replaced with the sweet scent of cake.
Harry let out and audible squeal.
“That you’re a… you know.” Harry paused to whisper. “Prostitute.”
Harry’s thighs tensed hard every few seconds, begging him to slow down his thrusts, the muscles screaming at him, but he couldn’t slow down, not now, not when Malfoy looked so bloody hot beneath him.
Harry cautiously pushed the door open to see Malfoy still under the sheets, but now with one hand covering his eyes. Harry let out a deep breath and walked over to his wardrobe where he pulled out his usual work clothes. A black shirt and black jeans, and a fresh pair of underwear.
The two stepped out of the basement and were greeted by Mia stood by the kitchen door with a mug of tea in her hand.
He heard the pat of Draco’s footsteps approach him.
“I’m sorry. It’s just… do you have a break soon?” Cole cast his eyes back up to him, a glimpse of sympathy blinking through them before he sighed.
“I know… I’m a horrible person.” Harry smiled back, licking his lips slightly. Draco’s eyes dropped down to follow his tongue. As soon as Draco’s gaze met Harry’s lips, Draco squeezed his eyes shut and turned his head away with a loud sigh.
“Let’s go.”
“What do you- That’s exactly what I
House hunting was just what Harry had expected it to be.
In a moment of rash decision Harry grabbed a paint pot of blood red and squirted a generous dollop onto his palette. The paint splashed around him, some even bouncing off and leaving tiny red flickers on the canvas.
When Harry looked back to Malfoy, the boy was still sat practically cradling Harry’s jeans in his hands. Harry thought Malfoy could sense his gaze when the blond looked up immediately. Except, there was something weird about Malfoy’s eyes. They almost seemed black. It looked a bit intimidating. But also sent a low grumble down to Harrys abdomen.
. What if Harry had opened the door and seen him sat there with his fingers up his arse.
He walked towards Harry from behind the desk.
to hear it, do you? Perhaps if the right thing feels so wrong, you shouldn’t listen to it.” With no other words exchanged, Cole patted Harry’s shoulder and walked away.
“Perhaps I could make an exception for some popcorn tea.”
It felt… strange. Last time he’d done this, Draco had worked him open with his tongue, which was pleasurable right from the get-go, whereas this felt more uncomfortable than anything.
“So…” Harry began, a half-smile on his lips. His eyes were half-lidded and his hair a state, he looked so goofy that Draco couldn’t hold back his laugh. “I’ve got to say, I really didn’t expect the evening to end like this.” Draco snorted.
Harry looked up to Draco’s resting body. He was in a sleep so deep Harry was sure a troll attack wouldn’t even wake him up.
“And you did this all whilst being a prostitute?” Malfoy’s body suddenly bristled.
“I just wanked before I got here.” He lied, “Can’t get it up so quickly.”
“I’m sorry about Molly, okay.” Harry whispered, wrapping his palm around one of Draco’s hands.
Harry’s mouth gaped at the size of the buttplug in his hand, the metal was so much larger on the inside, it must’ve stretched Draco out more than Harry’s whole fist even could. Well maybe not but… It was still
He jumped in the shower and was washed and back out within five minutes, when he realised, that in his rush to get away from Malfoy, he hadn’t brought any new clothes in with him. He groaned once again.
“Well, when did you get so boring? Play me a song.”
“You can say that again.” Ron agreed, a disbelieving laugh dropping from his lips as he said it. “Speaking of which, a new case came in yesterday about a drug ring in France.” He digressed, letting the conversation lull into the usual topics.
7:05pm
“If you can fix it, will we even be able to go forward that far?” Harry asked, causing Lucius to curiously glance over to him. Harry hadn’t said a word since he’d arrived.
Now Draco thought about it, what was he going to apologise for? Saying Harry was just his friend (which he was)? Making it awkward because he said he would’ve had sex with Harry? The more Draco’s mind went over it, the more he realised that he didn’t really have anything to apologise for.
“Okay.”
“Sounds good to me.”
One photo on the top right was of Draco talking to a patient who had a large bandage wrapped around the circumference of his head, his face smothered with bruises. Draco’s eyebrows were knitted, and his fingers were scratching at his chin.
“Please just come back to bed Harry-“
“What could be so important that Ron couldn’t wait to- oh” Hermione paused when her eyes met the headline on the front page.
“Fine, I suppose I’ll reap my losses and surrender.”
lol how we feelin?
“Oh God, I’m sorry. It’s just that you two acted so…”
Harry’s jaw dropped and his eyeballs bulged out from his eyes.
Draco opened his legs a bit wider and brought his free hand down to rest between his thighs, leaving his other hand to teasingly flutter up and down the shaft of his erection. Slowly, he let his finger brush against the sensitive skin of his arsehole. He bristled at the touch.
“Yes.” Harry answered. “Yes, I do.”
“I thought you looked really focused so… I kept us open for an extra half an hour.” He explained, avoiding Harry’s eyes.
Harry stared at Malfoy in confusion for a few seconds. He was obviously not in the right state of mind, his eyes were glinting a million shades of red and his lips looked to be cut up from biting.
Soon enough, Harry got lost in his work. He got carried away with sketching plans for the rooms and designing the colours and orders of the flowers and considering which spells would work best for repairing the house. He even began writing a to do list that matched up with his schedule. He really had spent too much time with Hermione.
“Still obsessed with Treacle Tart, eh?” Draco asked, fiddling with the maple jar.
Harry stepped forward and easily pushed the door open, the smell now being met with the sight of twenty different pastries on display at the counter. How he hadn’t noticed them last time he had come here, he had no idea. Harry joined the line, which was currently only filled with one French wizard attempting to order a croissant.
Within half a second, Draco was transported into the floo at the Weasley’s, with Harry stood only a metre away in front of him, one hand jutted forward for Draco to accept. Draco accepted gracefully and stepped out (not so gracefully), laughing when he spotted a small streak of soot on Harry’s cheek.
Draco clawed his hands into the pillow, hugging it slightly as he stared up to Harry’s face, watching in appreciation at how the sweat slowly rolled down his skin, his eyes occasionally closing and his head rolling back.
“I guess I’ll go call up Wes, tell him that I can’t make it tonight.”
Harry moved backward onto his knees to watch, now having a birdseye view of Malfoy’s open arse, it made even his ears turn red.
“Really?” Harry laughed.
It felt like cloud nine, the small exhale of breath from Harry’s nose tickling Draco’s face as their lips worked silently against one another. It suddenly hit Draco that he was kissing a man, for the first time in his life, and that this wasn’t just any man. This was
Harry rolled his eyes and stared down at his now empty cup, he had wanted advice from Cole, not some-sort of weird gossip exchange.
He made his decision and lowered his wand down, holding his breath as soon as it touched the sphere.
Harry jumped out of his chair when his office door flew back open with a loud bang. Draco’s mildly pink  face entered through the now clear doorway.
“Really Harry? Is there something you’re not telling me?” She quizzed, furrowing her eyebrows and crossing her arms.
“It’s just unexpected I suppose.” Harry reasoned. Does this mean Malfoy wasn’t a rent boy anymore?
“I think I may need just a little help. It is my first time after all.”
Harry opened the door wider, cringing at how a loud creak screamed from the joints.
“It’s not a nickname, your name is literally Potter.”
“And I think I know something far more fun we could be doing at home.”
A sudden chill ran up his spine, he was freezing. He quickly realised that his chest was bare, he moved his hands in an attempt to warm himself, only to find that they were being constricted back by something.
“Oh. Hi, what’s up?” Harry was awkward and he knew it.
“Then I guess you vanished my jeans or something – I don’t know I didn’t really question it at the time but it was some pretty smooth magic, I mean who knew you could cast wandlessly, where did you learn to do tha-“
“I don’t know.” Harry finished. Not wanting to talk any longer. “I don’t like this game.”
“Fuck.” Harry shot up. “Mia!” He exclaimed, immediately jumping up and grabbing his shirt, attempting to pull it on, only for it to get stuck around his head. “She thinks I’m showing you the basement.”
With his eyes closed, he could freely imagine what he’d just seen, and he did. So, he pictured the scene (replacing the blond with his own willing body), the image was shockingly more realistic than how he’d ever imagined it before. Draco pictured his own arse chucked up in the air, begging for Harry to move forward and shove his cock into Draco’s bundle of nerves.
“I mean, sure. What do you want to do?” She agreed. Thank
“I don’t know…”
“Harry.”
“Hopefully it get’s better from here.” Harry echoed from behind her. They stepped through onto the cobblestone path, which was overrun with green moss and black stains.
“I think this might be more than the hour and a half I paid for?” Malfoy giggled.
Draco dipped his head back down and continued nibbling Harry’s neck, but now he thrusted his hips up at Harry, his hard cock rubbing up against Harry’s thigh. Harry shifted, making their erections line up and they both groaned, Draco pushing him back harder into the wall.
“What’s hard to explain, Potter?” Harry looked down to the time turner pieces in his hand, the rest were in a jewellery box in his flat, he needed to bring these back.
One was orange with pinks and reds and oranges and white, it made Harry think of the sunsetting away. The other was a dark blue with more angry paint strikes, like the moon during a hunt. They both made Harry smile and his heart flutter. Although they had no objects in them, they showed Harry’s inner thoughts far more deeply than he could of possibly imagined.
“Okay.”
Britney knives or something, he couldn’t really remember.
“Welcome to the lab.” The slytherin welcomed, brushing past Harry and pulling out a cardboard box underneath his brewing table.
“Whatever, here is our case. Read through it quickly, I’ll apparate us up there in five minutes.” Harry explained, returning to his paperwork. Grimacing at how scratchy his handwriting looked on the page.
So, he took in a deep breath and decided to agree.
Malfoy pulled out a loose thread.
“Well, are you?” Harry repeated. Malfoy continued to chuckle for a few seconds.
“Yeah, I’m fine.” He shouted back, undoing the zipper of his trousers.
“Shut up, Potter.”
“I need to step outside for a moment.”
“It looks like you have an entire box of illegal potions underneath your bed Malfoy!” Harry shouted, chucking the Polyjuice potion into the box, a clash of glass echoing around the room.
“That would be lovely Harry.”
“Well, are you just going to stand there and brag or…” Harry joked, making a smirk light up Draco’s face.
“What is it-“ Harry started, before looking down into the box. He let out a howl of laughter. “Oh My God! That’s brilliant! Look! We match!” Harry reached into the box and grabbed the fedora before harshly plonking it down on Draco’s head.
“Mia.”
“Can’t keep yourself clean for even a second.” Draco joked, leaning forward to rub his thumb across Harry’s cheek, but he was quickly stopped by Harry’s soft grip on his wrist. They both paused, looking deeply at Draco’s fingers, before Harry’s eyes lifted to Draco’s.
Was it weird for Harry to be watching? What if Malfoy saw that Harry was watching? Would he stop? Harry tried to pull his head away, he really did, but his whole body screamed at him to look back after he pried his eyes away for half a second. The smart thing to do at this time would be to stand up and walk away. But, Harry never was very smart, was he?
“I thought you didn’t like parties?”
However, after being now left with nothing apart from his mind, he couldn’t help but let the flickers of blond run into his head.
“Whatever.” Malfoy nonchalantly flicked his wrist. “Is she?”
“Okay, fine!” Draco finally looked up from the guitar to meet Harry’s eyes. He unwrapped the croissant and took a small bite, Harry pretended not to notice the oily residue left on Draco’s lips. Or the way Draco’s tongue slipped out of his mouth the lick it up, or the way that- “Well, being the irresistible gay man that I am, I managed to pick up a super hot band guy from the club last night-“
“I’d like that a lot.” Hermione grinned. “But, in the meantime, have you got anything else to do?”
“Draco comes here every Saturday at 2pm.”
“It’s weird isn’t it?” Draco began, “Just days ago I thought I might never talk to you again.”
Harry closed his eyes and pretended to be asleep, hoping that it wasn’t completely obvious that he was awake. He heard Malfoy’s breath hitch for a moment and his head move to look at Harry. His breathing paused.
Harry almost let a bubble of laughter in his throat slip out.
“Toilets?” Alex mumbled against Harry’s lips.
“What do you mean?”
“I know… It’s just… complicated.” Harry shook his head and looked down at his hands, he heard Ginny let out a small sigh after a few seconds. When Harry looked up, her face looked sympathetic.
Harry does it again, Draco’s arse cheeks jiggle against Harry this time, a loud slapping sound filling the room. Harry feels like his nerve-endings are on fire, every thrust inside Malfoy brings him closer to his much needed climax.
“I’ll have a cocktail, pick any, I like them all!” She informed him, a large smile enveloping her features.
“I’ve got to say, you’ve done an impeccible job here Harry.” Mia congratulated. “I can hardly believe how quickly you’ve fixed this place up.”
“I did.” Draco paused and turned to Harry. “And whilst I must admit, you being covered in dirt and sweat and smelling like a masculine manly man,” Draco poked at Harry’s bicep. “Is a massive turn on, you also really badly need to shower.”
“Just put the bloody shirt on!” Harry rolled his eyes, pulled his jeans down the rest of his legs, and pulled the shirt over his torso. It landed just below the leg of his boxers.
“How has your day been?” Draco asked, taking a long sip of his tea.
He hadn’t come to the thought of Cole, had he? He had come to the thought of Malfoy.
Draco dropped his head down and pressed a deep kiss to Harry lips, one that took his breath away, one of Draco’s hand still stroking his inner thigh whilst the other stroked his hair with just as much care and devotion. Slowly, he pulled his lips from Harry’s and watched his face – keeping only an inch or two of distance between their noses.
Harry breathed another sigh against his mouth and slowly pulled away, only by a fraction of an inch.
Harry looked down to see that his body was rested on a large, four poster, double bed with embroidered green sheets lining them. The bed itself was extremely comfortable and felt like a cloud underneath Harry’s back.
Harry bounced back in shock, bashing his head against the wooden bed frame.
Hopefully you enjoy this chapter, it's a bit more wholesome than the last few :)
He felt awkward. What should he do with his hands? He’d decided the best option was to leave them at his sides, but now he was very aware of how out of place his limbs felt hanging limply beside him. Maybe he should touch Alex?
It was a nice pub from what Harry could see from outside. The walls were a pale yellow/cream colour that stretched up to an upper floor that housed rooms to sleep in. There were four windows on the front of the wall which radiated with warmth framed with tables on the inside were almost completely full.
He filled it once again, chugging down the water so that some spilt down and covered his throat. His thirst felt unquenchable and each gulp felt more like the scraping of nails than the last. But he couldn’t stop, he took another gulp of water. For half a second it was refreshing, but then the thirst came back, accompanied by a need for another glass.
Harry’s feet stumbled over one another, making him suddenly forget how to walk, but he managed anyways.
“I was sure you weren’t going to go through with it.” Malfoy whispered, looking Harry up and down once over. “I can’t bloody believe it.” Harry was pretty sure he wasn’t meant to hear that, so he pretended he hadn’t.
Draco cleared his throat.
“You’ve already asked that.”
“There was nothing to forgive.” Draco grinned back, surprised at the gruff quality in his voice.
“Is this okay?” He asked, lowering his head frustratingly close to Draco’s erection. His pink, aggravated, wet lips looked so appetising that Draco was half tempted to thrust up into them.
“Malfoy?” The two said in unison.
“Yes, I was waiting.”
“Don’t even try it Parkinson, I’m going with truth.” He insisted. She sulked for a few seconds, looking around the circle for inspiration.
“You’re not my boyfriend.”
“I think that could be arranged.” Harry replied, letting his eyes drift shut as Draco flicked and swirled his tongue back and forth.
“You’re a good woman, Narcissa, and a great mother.” Harry complimented, preparing himself.
Harry apparated a little walk away from Malfoy’s. Whilst he was excited to see him again, it might not be the best of ideas to show up with everything completely unplanned.
“Hot.”
“You wish to see Lucius?” She asked, clutching onto her stomach.
“Not my problem.”
“Fucking Potter! Please, please.” Draco began to beg, still unable to stop his grinding down onto Harry’s fingers. “More. Please, fuck. Fuck me Potter.”
“Mmhmmm…” Draco agreed, standing up out of his chair. He needed some water.
Harry looked down to the bag he had slung around his shoulder.
Harry thought about the idea, that would work actually, it’s not like he needs the basement anyways. He’ll spend most of his time in the attic.
“Well…” Cole replied, looking down to his wristwatch once again. “I can certainly see what you mean by history.”
“Let’s get going then.” Harry stood up, offering his arm out for a side-along.
“You really want something more with me?” Draco asked, when Harry faced him, shock was written all over Malfoy’s features, like a small child.
And with that, Harry turned out of the room and strolled towards the kitchen.
“You’re going to go four days without any plumbing.” She lifted one eyebrow at him.
Harry craned his neck to get a better look, his heart speeding up.
“Fine… I guess I’ll go.” He said, a small frown on his face as he walked towards the door. “First I have to cancel my date… then you kick me out of your office… life is so cruel.” Draco complained with so much drama that he may as well have been in some sort of muggle screen play.
Harry swiftly ran his eyes across the page, soon finding the article.
“Yeah… I just didn’t feel a spark, I’m sorry.”
Cole puckered his lips in thought for a second, before grabbing his mug and lifting himself up from his chair.
Harry just nodded in reply.
“It’s called Ivy Tree cottage. You’ll figure it out I’m sure.”
Hermione hauled her body up from the floorboards, her footsteps echoing as she walked away.
“Coming!”
Malfoy looked at Harry expectantly, jogging Harry out of his daze and moving his feet to the wardrobe. He looked through the few shirts hung up in there. He reached in and pulled out a dark blue oversized shirt. He looked at it and then gave Malfoy a once over to see if it was the right size.
“I knew you’d like it.” She giggled out, pulling Harry so close that he could hardly breath.
He’d just wanked, in front of his roommate’s door. Whilst he had fantasised about his roommate fucking him.
“What would you like Andy?” Harry asked, moving out of Andy’s arm towards the stove.
“What do you mean?”
“Which means we have no option other than to travel back with the broken time turner?”
It wasn’t anywhere near as good as butterbeer. That was a big claim in itself, however, for a herbal tea. It was
“I am not a bloody pansy!” Draco was faintly aware that he had the entire shops attention on him now. “I would never sleep with Harry and Merlin knows I would never even come within three feet of you!”
Harry waved his hand over the unfinished puzzle in front of him.
“But my office is too cold again. I was having such a good hair day today.”
“Cum inside me. Fill me up.” Malfoy whispers. Harry crashes their lips against each other in a sloppy kiss, thrusting into the man harder and faster until his orgasm came so hard it turned his vision white.
The door reopened to reveal the tall body of Lucius. Harry was almost shocked at quite how much he looked like Draco, his hair wasn’t as short, it was about chin length, but his features didn’t have the same softness as Draco’s. He looked far more unforgiving.
Harry stared down at the cold glass sphere, surprised when not even his reflection appeared on the surface.
“Come ‘ere.” Mia lifted a washcloth from the sink and attempted to wipe some of the dirt off of Harry’s face. “That’ll have to do.” She mumbled, setting the dirty cloth down to the table.
He’d decided on an emerald green T-shirt that blended down to a dark shade of green at his waist – he’d remembered Ginny had said she’d liked it once – and a pair of black denim jeans. He hoped it would be a good outfit for clubbing, but his dress sense had always been subpar.
Neither of the bedrooms had any furniture left in them, which Harry supposed made it easier for him to start decorating.
He had to do something to get his mind off of Draco.
He imagined Harry leaning over him and shoving his hand to Draco’s front to wrap his fingers around Draco’s erection, hanging down in front of him with his desperate arse still begging in the air. Draco tugged from base to tip as he imagined Harry’s strong, calloused fingers massaging his length, making Draco squirm beneath his touch.
“Can I not put some clothes on?” Harry panicked.
It was rough and messy and perfect.
Harry let out a loud sigh.
So, when he was only a foot away from the door and a loud bang sounded from inside, Harry could hardly hold his nerves back. He leapt through the door in record time and screamed “petrificus totalus!” in the direction of the sound.
“So you’re sure the potion recipe has been taken?” Harry asked once again, filtering through another box of Draco’s lab ingredients.
Harry paused his movements and watched for a few seconds as Malfoy continued to ride Harry’s fingers before pulling them away from Draco’s loosened hole.
There Draco was, laid naked on Harry’s bed, his hand lazily moving along his cock.
Why wouldn’t his hair just settle down? He lifted a hand in an attempt to glue the strands down to his head, but it was to no avail.
Malfoy tried to push the kiss deeper, but Harry didn’t let him, keeping up the original pace. Draco whimpered and pulled back.
His voice was still small as Harry walked him to stand in front of the bed, pushing the backs of his knees onto the mattress. Harry grabbed his other hand and held them both before leaning in to place a small peck on Draco’s lips.
The two boys walked side by side down to the bottom of the drive, where Malfoy closed the tall gate behind him.
The hug suddenly felt awkward and Harry disentangled himself from Draco’s arms.
“I’ll just have a fried egg if you’re making, got to get my protein in the mornings.” He smiled, casting a joking gaze to Draco. Draco shot a passive-aggressive smile back at him, feigning some form of chivalry.
“Thank you.”
The two walked towards the diner, the cold of night not affecting their rose blossomed cheeks. Harry felt just as warm as ever.
Harry sat still in an ashamed silence. Part of him wished he’d never pressed his wand to the glass ball. Albeit it was only a very small part of him, but it was still present nevertheless.
With that Harry nodded his head and shuffled his way around the dance floor to the bar. This time he could smell the sweaty scent of the dance floor, but it didn’t feel predatory like when he’d come alone. Maybe even just having Ginny here made a massive difference.
Two of them were paintings of Harry’s garden, both far better than Harry’s first painting. Admittedly, the flowers were still a bit off but, they were good enough that perhaps someone would even want to buy them.
Without warning, Malfoy flipped his body around so that he faced the other man instead of Harry and attached their lips together. Harry watched with rapt interest as Malfoy snogged the face off of the man in front of him.
“You’re impossible Malfoy.”
“I’m not a prostitute Harry,” Malfoy revealed, ploughing his face deep in his hands “and I never have been.”
“I can just say you are my partner at work, he has no reason to know who you are.”
“No, I have to have some tea.” Draco persisted. “My brain won’t compute without it.”
“It’s a bit emptier than usual actually!” She shouted back. “I’ll sit here, can you go to the bar and buy me a drink?” She plonked herself down onto the bench.
“That’s for not calling for three months, you twat!”
, but he’d been made fun of because of it at least one a week for the past ten months.
“You’re not serio-“
Harry rubbed his eyes, groaning at the light streaming into his room. What time was it?
“Even after you left.” Harry continued, this time Draco didn’t reply, instead choosing to neck down the entire glass of water. “Speaking of which… What did you do after you left?”
Malfoy’s tongue began to circle the crinkled skin of Harry’s hole, making the rim flutter beneath him. Harry arched his back up into the ceiling as a moan fell from his lips. Draco didn’t stop or slow the torture of his tongue slowly and carefully wrapping around Harry’s hole, circling the skin, but never digging inside.
“Don’t go near that bin, I need to run a few checks before you go in there.” Harry warned, watching as Draco continued to approach it.
“Yeah. I mean, not crazy far back. After school age ya’know.” Harry nodded along in agreement.
“Really? He’s never mentioned it.”
Harry raised his fingers to his eyes and rubbed them, holding back the pressure he felt bubbling just behind the sockets.
“That wouldn’t be possible.” Lucius interrupted. “Time is very delicate and, the problem you currently face is, you would only be able to travel on a time turner that had not been used from 1977 all the way to 2004. If you travelled using one that had been used between those years, any time jumps it was used for would be reversed. Even if time turners weren’t as rare as they are, it would be impossible to know whether it had been used, unless if you time jumped an entire list of every time turner that had been used after 1977 with you. The effects of using a time turner that had been used between those two dates could be devastating.”
“I’m so impressed.” Draco rolled his eyes. “I said show me something impressive, Harry.”
Then after a quick look at the two bathrooms, they moved onto the two places that Harry was most excited about.
As soon as Harry replied, Malfoy had lifted himself up and was on Harry in an instant, pushing his lips down onto Harry’s.
“Damn Potter!” Blaise shouted out from the edge of the circle. “You’ve done that before.” He complemented, sending an amused smile at Harry. Harry just cocked his eyebrows.
It wasn’t completely horrible anyways, the sky still looked pretty, maybe not quite how the sky looked in real life, but it looked pretty nonetheless. He was sure no fourteen-year-old could’ve painted better.
or anyone else. He was perfect to me, he didn’t worship me and don’t you dare even say that he didn’t deserve me! He deserved the world, he was so pure and loving, he was just scared! He was a scared, little boy when you knew him. But he’s changed so much, and I’ve never met someone anything like him!”
“Are you okay Harry?” She asked, abandoning the brewing tea. “You seem a bit… down.”
“Do I know him?” She asked, finally stepping away to pull the tea bags out of the tea.
“Well, I’m at work until six, but after that we could definitely do something.”
“Quite a few people have offered me a substantial number of galleons for the land alone - but they all wanted to demolish the home and start from scratch. I understand that this place is a bit of a wreck, but it was my Grandfather’s and I have too many memories of when it was beautiful to let someone just demolish it.” Harry nodded along in understanding.
Then he dipped his brushes into a dark black (which for whatever reason was a horrible colour to find a good quality of) and flicked dots of black onto the canvas. Dirtying the pristine spikes with grime and dark. Making them hardly resemble what they once were. Harry soon stopped with the flicks, deciding that perhaps, he had added to much black to the painting.
Harry recognised the colour of one of the phials.
Then Harry pushed deeper, and deeper again, and once he was fully rested inside Draco, he let out a deep exhale of breath.
“I was but… I’ve been thinking.” Harry admitted, he took a breath and slowly let it go, “I hadn’t really thought about how this whole other timeline would work and… After seeing my parents yesterday… I don’t think I could stay here, knowing they were just down the road from me. And if I stayed here, I’d have to watch them die another time, relive the war… Everything terrible that had ever happened to me would happen again.”
Harry turned back around.
The words seemed to fly over Harry’s head, he still couldn’t bear to bring his eyes away from the photo, endlessly evaluating Malfoy’s sudden hotness. How did he not see that back at Hogwarts?
Maybe taking time to think it through before meeting Malfoy was the wrong decision, Harry always lived through impulse, planning just wasn’t his thing. But he was already half-way there now, which made his stomach tip.
Harry imagined his small hands moving forward to wrap around his cock, slowly beginning to pump up and down from base to tip. His other hand would crawl forward and begin to fondle Harry’s balls. Without realising, Harrys let the fingers grow into longer, more aristocratic digits that were far more stimulating than the previous hands.
“Shhhhh, he’s at the door. Act natural.”
I like reading the comments, so feel free to leave one.
“That would work, but I don’t have a hobby ‘mione. Unless you mean saving the world and coming back from the dead, but I don’t think you can class that as a hobby.” Hermione just raised one eyebrow at Harry in response.
“Fine, but it’s not going to be very interesting.” She warned, a bit annoyed that she’d wasted her go for a truth on Potter. She hadn’t even considered that gryffindors were smart enough to play truths. “Well, who would you want to have sex with most out of all of us?” She pouted.
“I doubt it. I’ve done some really fucked up stuff, Harry.” Harrys thumb began brushing back and forth over the soft skin of Draco’s knuckles.
So, he poured out his new set of paints, and he’d be lying if he said that he didn’t have Malfoy on his mind the whole time he was painting.
“I know.”
“They couldn’t find enough proof.” Malfoy finally looked up to Harry’s eyes, only to quickly look away again. “I don’t want to be caught. They’d sent me to Azkaban. They’ve already let me off once.”
He tutted under his breath and carried on.
“Yes?” Malfoy answered.
“What things?” Malfoy dug, his fingers moving to tap against the table.
Harry was so close, his orgasm fast approaching. He lifted his eyes to the ceiling, only to be mesmerised when he brought them back down to see Malfoy’s head bopping up and down on his cock.
“What’s wrong?”
He turned on the tap, waiting for the water to run cold.
“I’m Bi but-”
“Thanks for all the help ‘mione, but you should really head home now.” Harry pushed; Hermione accepted without any argument. She probably was very tired.
He finally pulled away and stepped back to look at his bamboozled date.
“Harry!” He heard a feminine voice shout.
Yesterday, he felt a welcoming presence cast over the whole place, the full dance floor -whilst intimidating- felt inviting and exciting. But now, the club seemed predatory, he could see a whole new world that he hadn’t seen before. Somehow when he was with Ginny, the undertone of lust had completely gone over his head, as if he was wearing rose-coloured glasses. He spared a second to wonder if Ginny had noticed it either.
So, the little menace was a little baby as well.
“Oh my Merlin!” Draco exclaimed, trying to rush out of the door, but inadvertently falling backwards and shutting the door behind himself. “I’m so sorry-”
Harry was surprised by how much he liked watching Narcissa and Draco talk. Draco was so open and unguarded around her that it was refreshing to watch, he didn’t once sarcastically correct her, or fire a snappy insult like Harry was so used to hearing.
“Oh Merlin!” Draco shouted. “Who is it?” He had his hand nuzzled against his forehead, trying to rub the pain away.
“You’re an utter twat, that’s what you are!” She shouted out reaching for another object to throw at Harry. He didn’t even really know how he’d ended up in this position, Hermione was angry when he’d first come home but after telling her about the house, it was like he’d ignited a bomb.
“Good.” Draco huffed in relief before turning around and leaving the office, shutting the door behind him.
“Oh, of course, come in, come in.” Malfoy opened the door wider and shuffled out of the way, letting Harry walk past. Harry walked over to where he saw a few pairs of shoes situated and bent down to take his own off.
“Hi Bethany.” Draco greeted his youngest Barista. She was only sixteen and had worked there since Draco opened the store two years ago. She was extremely shy when she’d first started, but in recent times, she’d really warmed to the place.
But as Harry looked between his cup, the newspaper and the letter still in his hand, he knew his mind wouldn’t change even if he was given years to think it over. He wanted to go back to Malfoy.
“No… I just. I’m happy to see you again, Mummy.” Draco sniffled as he pulled away from her, watching her with puffy eyes before leaning forward and kissing her on the cheek. “I love you.”
difficult.”
Maybe this was…
“Go to bed?”
“No problem.”
“Okay” Draco agreed.
Harry stood outside of the oak doorway; he was oddly nervous.
They both slowly crawled into the circle, Harry with a bit more reluctance, until they were sat only an inch away from each other. Harry was sure he had never felt so exposed in his life. Even though he wasn’t completely naked, Malfoy’s dark eyes made him feel like he was completely vulnerable.
“You know what? How about this weekend, you and me go out. Forget about Malfoy, find a new guy.” She asked, stroking Harry’s jaw.
“It’s okay… You’re okay.” He whispered, his breath brushing Harry’s ear lobe in a small puff.
Harry felt content, whilst his heart still ached from time to time, the happiness of being surrounded by his loved ones settled him well enough.
“I don’t think it would be a good idea for you to know, Father.” Draco spoke up, just a second before Harry answered.
“You came!” Cole’s face lit up as he reached forward to hug Harry. Harry hugged him back.
In the meantime, Harry and Hermione had both visited one of Diagon’s craft shops and now Harry had enough canvases in his attic to last him a life time.
Had Malfoy ever really looked at Harry? Yes, he definitely had.
“I’m gonna-”
“It was- for you. At first, I didn’t know what to do, but then I did some thinking and after I figured it out, there wasn’t a second I doubted doing it.”
“I demand you get off dobby right this second!” He disappeared with a crack and suddenly appeared the opposite side of Harry and bit down on his forearm.
It always happened like this, Harry would tell Draco he was going on a date with a new guy, Draco would feign disinterest and carry on reading his newspaper, nonchalantly taking a bite of his evenly buttered toast. Then Harry would leave at about six pm, only to return at one in the morning with some blond bimbo on his elbow, then shag them senseless in the room next door. Luckily, last night Draco had slept through the whole affair, going to bed early in hopes that he would. Afterwards, Harry (being the gentleman that he is) would always make his date some breakfast -which he would burn beyond belief- only for Draco to go to the kitchen to make breakfast for them instead.
8:56 pm
Harry could hardly speak, let alone from a coherent sentence.
“Thank you, Harry.” He chucked his hand through his hair.
“I’ll wait outside.” Malfoy said and quickly turned around, Harry went to stop him, but he was interrupted by Narcissa grabbing his arm.
“Why not?” Draco spluttered, “Because I’m straight, for starters! So, I would never ever ever, not in a billion years,
He wanted to hug his Mum.
Hermione had recently developed an eye for fashion, and at the moment these chauvinistic houses were all the rage – industrial white walls and modern looking windows, with swimming pools and training rooms and cinemas. One even had a full-sized aquarium, but that was all too much for Harry. He was only one person, after all.
“Thanks ‘mione, how many?”
“So, will you take Draco?”
“Anyways, I think I was destined to be obsessed with you when I first saw you at that gay club.” Harry’s memory flickered back to Draco rubbing up against another man, Harry had to squeeze his eyes to push the image away. Hating how his chest sparked with possessive jealousy.
“Really?”
. This was going to take an hour at least.
Malfoy pulled away from Harry’s mouth and began kissing along his jaw, starting at the dip next to Harry’s mouth and continuing along his jawline until he latched on to one spot below Harry’s ear. Harry groaned at the sensation of Malfoys tongue swirling around his skin. Malfoy lifted his mouth to Harry’s ear.
Harry span himself in a circle to face Malfoy again, this time however, instead of watching Harry, Malfoy was glaring at Cole. But within a second, his sight was back on Harry’s now shirtless body.
“I’m back Malfoy! I got milk!” Harry walked through to the kitchen, lying his plastic bag down onto the countertop and began unpacking the milk.
Just when Harry was about to drift off to sleep in Draco’s embrace, he heard a small whisper being pressed into his hair.
“No way.” Harry whispered back to her.
Harry stepped forward into the floo and grabbed a handful of powder before dropping it and burning up and away to the burrow.
“He’s a nice guy, great at making things not awkward.”
“You can’t rush these things, son. I want you to get home in one piece.”
Harry felt the air whoosh out of his lungs.
“You’ve shown how much you regret it, and I know that that couldn’t have been easy.”
“He was the one that wanted to piss on me.”
“Merlin-“ Draco jumped again, this time grabbing his chest dramatically, “How do you all do that?”
“Come on, let’s go. Don’t want to miss presents.”
“Thank God.” Malfoy whispered. “I was waiting for him to leave.”
“What?”
In his post orgasmic state, he confusedly looked around his room, which was definitely not lined with velvet green walls and embroidered sheets anymore.
“To change the subject, I think Malfoy is kind of moving into my basement?” Harry interrupted Cole’s giggles.
And after half an hour of endless listing, Harry felt like his bladder was about to explode.
The only upside to the situation was that after a good wank, sleep always came easily
“I’m afraid not, Draco. I must be obliviated by the end of this, along with Narcissa. If you stay with us, we would have too many memories of you to obliviate. We could end up brain dead if your friend obliviates us too much.”
Harry’s eyes flickered down to see his oakwood guitar nestled in the pit of Malfoy’s lap.
Without warning, Malfoy pulled the briefs down, making Harry’s prick bounce up against his stomach. Harry closed his eyes at the sensation of the air beating against his hard cock, the exposure alone was almost too much pleasure for Harry to handle.
“Well, where would your Father be?” Harry asked.
However, the fic is still not 100% finished (although it does have a plot sorted) so if you have any ideas of where to take it, feel free to comment, I might even include them. xx
“Oh.” He replied. “Okay, uhm, you can come out now, my eyes are closed.”
“Why are you in my office?”
Harry felt like crying, just like Draco was in front of him – looking so vulnerable and small. He wanted nothing more than to stitch Draco up and make him feel better, kiss him until he couldn’t even remember what sadness felt like. So, Harry did.
“What do you want, Harry? I’ll order.” She prompted.
“I’ve been robbed.” Malfoy explained, tugging on the tips of his hair. “They took my potions recipe.”
Those article photos gave Malfoy absolutely no justice whatsoever. In real life, his facial structure was just a little more prominent, his hair a little more blond and his body a little more muscular. Harry could hardly stop himself from letting his eyes run up and down Malfoy.
Harry chuckled again.
In no time at all, he saw Ginny turn around the corner to greet him with a pint of lager and a small glass of wine for herself. He smiled and reached up to grab his drink from her hands.
“I haven’t eaten since one, I’m starving.”
Now that Harry could
Harry reached into his side bag, pulling out an already written cheque for thirty-thousand galleons. He pushed it towards her. She looked down to the cheque and accepted it, putting the paper into her bag.
“What in the name of Merlin-”
“And however much I love Draco, you can’t deny that he’s a sneaky git. He snuck around a lot, hid some things from me. I didn’t like that one bit, so one day I asked him about it, and we had a massive argument, I didn’t speak to him for a month straight after that. I found a new place fairly quickly and moved away.”
“Don’t worry, you’ll find out soon.” Harry said, shooting Malfoy a wink that quickly shut him up. Once both of Harry’s shoes were comfortably off his feet, he channelled his inner magic mike and began.
“Have you really not had sex since I left?” Harry asked, not looking up from his hands.
He looked down to his watch again.
“Can I have trim on the top, but keep it long, and just smooth out the sides, please.” The man asked, Harry nodded. “Oh, and can you make sure the cut is really even? The last guy I went to cut it so bad.”
“You are unbelievable.” She complained, jumping up from her seat. “I’m going to the toilet, watch my bag.” She instructed, turning away from him and walking towards the brightly lit toilet sign.
After five minutes or so of stealing glances at Malfoy, he took the frames off his face and closed the case file. Harry studiously kept his eyes on his paperwork during this.
“Uhhhh… Harry?” Ron nudged. Suddenly, Harry remembered where he was.
Harry’s heart sank as he realised that this wasn’t real, it was Malfoy’s job. He only wanted Harry for his galleons.
“What?”
or anything.
“Dobby, I would like to request the presence of Lucius Malfoy.” Draco calmly asked, ignoring Harry’s bewildered state.
“What’s wrong?” Harry asked, grabbing Malfoy’s arm and pulling him into the warmth of his cottage.
“Shhhhhh” Harry giggled, raising a hand to cover Cole’s mouth.
An awkward atmosphere settled over the whole circle, the tension between the three boys obvious.
His stomach rumbled just reading the names of the various desserts, each sounding more like heart attack central than the last.
“Why do you want to go back there, Malfoy? Do you not want a fresh start?” Harry asked, leaning closer to the man, who quickly leaned back, “I mean as far as I remember, your life isn’t great.”
Harry knelt his head down further to the ground to get a better look. Merlon, he’d look
Draco didn’t know what to do or say, Harry kept pumping in and out of the man, with such ferocity that Draco didn’t even notice the screaming moans from the blond with his face in the pillow, his hands tied up in ecstasy behind his neck. Draco was hypnotised by the ripple of the man’s arse with every thrust before he finally snapped out of his daze.
“Yeah, the soil looks fairly infertile, we could try to replenish it but, I reckon it would be easier to just start from scratch.” Harry nodded along with Hermione, trusting her weird amount of knowledge on soil.
“Wait.” He interrupted. “How do you know my name?”
“He deserved it! Could you not see how obviously mentally ill he was? And he had his hands all over you when you came in. Putting his arm over your shoulders like that. What a creep!” Harry chuckled, the air of his breath brushing over Draco’s ear, making him stiffen in place.
“Wait!” Draco chortled, “Where are you going?”
It could not be healthy to be quite this hard.
Draco nodded and walked over to the plush seat in the corner of the room.
“More?” Harry asks, continuing his thrusts.
“Harry?” Malfoy whispered.
“Okay. I’ll busy myself until six and then we can go roller blading or whatever.”
Malfoy better be
But the water had done its job and cleared some of the fog in his head, lessening the thumping that lived deep in his eye sockets.
“Sorry, I’m too… distracted to cast wandlessly.” He explained before forcefully undoing the buttons of his top. “Oh fuck it, I can’t wait.” He announced, raising his wand and instantly spelling all the clothes away from his body. “Sorry, I tried to take it slow, but if I’m not fucking you within the next minute, I might just explode.”
Harry lowered his wand, furrowing his eyebrows at the now frozen body.
“Shouldn’t I show you this basement Draco?” Harry asked, Draco’s body immediately sprang up at the question.
“What do you want then, Harry?” Draco’s fingertips were cold, and the windows were mildly iced over. Winter mornings in London were always bitterly chilly, but it only made the satisfaction of a hot cup of coffee even nicer.
“Here.” Catherine rolled an empty beer bottle into the centre of the circle. “Time for spin the bottle.”
Harry couldn’t help himself, he took a risk and leant forward, wrapping his arms around the man and bringing him in in a tight embrace. Draco’s body bristled, but when Harry rubbed his hand against Draco’s back, he felt him relaxed and pour himself into the hug. Harry’s heart warmed, leaping around in its cage. Harry almost felt bad at how he was meant to be comforting the man, but instead couldn’t control his own emotions around him.
“Yes.”
“We should really get back to work, Malfoy.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“What am I doing here?” Harry asked, crossing his legs in an attempt to hide the tent forming in his trousers.
It was always Draco’s Achilles heel, he knew his nipples were far more sensitive than normal people’s.
The sudden wet, hotness of Draco’s mouth made Harry’s eyes roll to the back of his head, pleasure running down Harry’s stomach into his crotch then down to his toes in endless waves.
“How is Ginny nowadays?”
“That is also very gay, why did you think you were straight for so long?”
“You’ve gotten yourself into quite the predicament.” He continued.
“She had started pushing the baby out when I came to get you so maybe an hour is left. Something like that.”
“I haven’t in months I swear.” Malfoy crossed his fingers over his heart.
That was
“I like it dirty.”
Draco nodded.
slow. Harry met Malfoy’s eyes again finally, to find that Draco’s eyes hadn’t drifted from his face, intently watching every expression Harry made.
Harry much preferred the role of a seeker. He loved watching them during a match, they were always the deciding factor of a win or a loss, chasers always had lower stakes. Therefore, he loved the risk of playing seeker, but he wasn’t going to pet Draco’s ego with that information.
Harry read over the headline again. Last he’d heard, Malfoy had disapeared about five years ago just after his trial, thought to be hiding somewhere in eastern Europe. Harry read down to the actual article.
“That doesn’t mean you can’t have some cake.”
Malfoy pushed his head back slightly into the other man’s neck, revealing the pale skin of his own neck, layered with a sheen of sweat. Harry’s eyes travelled down to Malfoy’s chest where a few of the buttons on his T-shirt were undone to reveal the top of his collarbones. Harry’s tongue shot out to lick his suddenly dry lips.
The alleyway was Malfoy’s rentboy alley.
But the embarrassment faded slightly when Draco saw the soft smile settled on Harry’s red, aggravated lips.
“I know Draco best. So, what was it exactly that he did?” Cole prodded.
“But… but you sold yourself to me-”
“I probably would sleep with you, Harry.” Draco couldn’t believe what he was saying, had he gone insane? “In fact, I would happily sleep with you.”
They regarded each other for a moment, before both rolling together and kissing for long dreamy minutes.
Malfoy reached his own hand down between their two bodies and spread his legs wide.
“How much is it?”
“No, he’s not what I’m worried about.”
“Oh what this?” Malfoy asked as if he wasn’t even aware of his leaking dick. He moved his hips from side to side enticingley, making his manhood bop. Harry licked his lips. “I’ll leave it like that.”
Harry didn’t know how long it went on, it was like he’d flown to cloud nine, never to come back. His mind blurred with nothing but Draco’s skin rippling each time Harry’s pelvis hit his deep red arsecheeks and how Draco’s legs had somehow ended up being wrapped around his own head.
“Relax.” Draco whispered into Harry’s neck, comfortingly brushing his other hand along Harry’s inner thigh. Harry took a deep breath and tried to relax the muscles in his arse – it seemed to work as Draco managed to slip his finger down to his first knuckle. Harry whimpered and pressed his nose into Draco’s hair as the finger began to slide in and out, in and out, in and out, until the resistance Harry’s body was offering slowly drifted away and Draco’s finger could slide in all way to the knuckle.
Draco nods furiously, moving his arm away from his mouth onto the headboard behind him, both of his hands needed to stop his body from being pushed into the board.
“But that’s illegal.” Harry smiled, not really caring about the legalities of it all.
Harry’s gaze was still entranced with amazement.
but when Hermione started rambling about a new, alternative (and healthier) way to give birth that she had researched, Harry couldn’t help but let his eyes stray back to the article.
“Then I thought, to celebrate your newfound sexuality, we could have a go at going to a gay club.” Ginny proposed, her voice going nervously high-pitched.
“Oh no! I must’ve mixed up the sugar and salt. I’m so sorry.” He apologised with a very over sympathetic voice.
“Um… No thank you.” Harry politely declined, despite how his body was screaming to go and kiss Malfoy again.
Harry didn’t dare to look down to meet Malfoy’s eyes.
Just three days ago, the blond had ended up spending the whole day in Harry’s office because apparently his own office was
“It wasn’t anything serious. Just a fling…“ Harry paused.
“Forget about that!” Draco warned. “There’s a whole article about us being fuck buddies Harry!”
“I’m sorry, I’m fine.” Draco whispered, “I’m just being stupid.”
Malfoy looked up to Harry’s eyes before sinking down to his crotch.
“Well I have had a few offers.” Mia interrupted.
This time the ache didn’t feel like a burn, but instead it was a satisfying stretch, that had Harry bucking his own hips up into Draco’s stomach, ready to take more of Draco already.
Harry lifted them up and Draco slid the cushion below Harry’s arse, leaving Harry at the right angle for Malfoy to enter.
“Fuck.” Harry whispered as Malfoy swirled his tongue around the skin, lifting his finger to flick at the other nipple. Draco lightly bit down on the nub, making Harry’s head chuck back in a mixture of pleasure and pain. He moved along to the other nipple and repeated the same action, making Harry a whimper below him.
Harry swiped his tongue over Malfoy’s bottom lip, which seemed to drag Malfoy out of whatever haze he was stuck in as he pushed himself up against the wall, grabbed Harry by the neck and swivled them around.
Harry got changed quickly, this time Draco didn’t say anything about Harry changing in the same room as him, but he did turn around and look at the wall.
Draco’s reluctance made Harry’s stomach slam down to his feet.
“This was my old bedroom, when I was little.” Mia explained, pointing to the pink one.
The two lied still, staring up at the ceiling, Draco’s legs were shaking, weak in a post-orgasmic fuzz.
“Deal.”
Harry must think he’s a creepy weirdo.
Harry picked up his canvas primer and liberally ran it over the canvas, casting a spell to dry it quickly.
“What in Merlin’s name!” She exclaimed when the paper collided with her head.
“To forgetting Draco sodding Malfoy.” Ginny cheered before downing her shot.
He groaned into his hands. Way to go Draco. You’ve wrecked things again.
“And yet, you still can’t cook a single rasher of bacon. You cease to amaze me, Harry.”
“How are the rooms so big?” She squinted deeper into the paper. “Are the scales of these drawings off?”
“First time?”
“Good night, Potter.”
Harry shot his eyes back to where his hands were rested on the table. He was slamming his fingers together in an attempt to expel his nervousness. Harry hadn’t even thought of what he would say if Malfoy spoke to him. He didn’t think Malfoy would even acknowledge him. He’d already had a whole two hours to plan, why hadn’t he?
“We haven’t got all day you two!” A voice broke through Harry’s thoughts making him vaguely realise that he was staring intensely at Malfoy’s nose. He raised his eyes to Malfoy’s, only to see that the man was staring directly back.
“Have you ever done them?”
“I had a few bags left, I remember you liked it.”
“Yeah!”
“You best get it over with.”
“What cake slice do you want then?”
He figured that his reply would get the message across well enough and tied the small note back onto the owl’s leg.
Harry was stood outside of the small, cosy café once again. This time, however, he noticed the warm, inviting smell of fresh pastries wafting out through the door. His stomach let out a loud growl of approval.
“Fine, he can do it. As long as I don’t remember meeting you. You’ll have to do it to Narcissa as well.”
He picked up the instruction manual he’d bought.
“Because the basement is just what I’d dreamt it to be: the right temperature, dark, Large” Malfoy chuckled, “and it’s something I’ve wanted for so long. Ya’know?”
“Yes.” Harry replied against Alex’s lips.
“That’s fucking sick Malfoy.” Harry stood up from the bed, grabbing his trousers from his feet and haphazardly pulling them on.
“You’ve used the orb already, haven’t you?” Malfoy smirked, his eyes turning predatory.
Harry couldn’t ignore the fireworks show firing up in his belly.
“With who?”
Harry felt his heart begin to race, what if Malfoy had hurt himself and fallen down the staircase? Harry held his breath and practically ran through to the basement and down the steps.
“About five times a week, I take the weekend off.”
Draco felt panic crash down like a boulder over him, his breathing was rushed, and he could feel his heart in his fingertips.
Malfoy’s eyes were sparkling.
Cole noticed Harry’s annoyance and moved his hand to rest over the man’s.
“Of course.” Harry replied, he didn’t really care, he was just happy that he hadn’t been picked. He probably wouldn’t have even realised that he was meant to be here with Cole if Cole hadn’t asked.
Harry couldn’t take it any longer, Malfoy felt like a magnet pulling him in, a force so strong that he had no chance at holding himself back. So, he plunged himself forward and wrapped his arms around Draco’s shoulders and let his head fall into the blond’s shoulder.
“I’m a personal trainer down at Planet Fitness.”
“Of course, it’ll give me something to do. I don’t really want to have to work, I have enough money anyways. This could be my little project.” Hermione stared at the other sketches.
Harry turned around to face Malfoy and was fairly impressed at how the man unabashedly trained his eyes onto Harry’s bobbing cock. He wasn’t even trying to hide where he was looking.
However, Harry had completely not braced himself for the moment that their eyes would meet. His breath was almost knocked out of his chest by the pure grey metal of Malfoy’s eyes. A small ‘o’ shape lined Malfoy’s lips for a second before it was quickly discarded for a large, predatory smile.
“Right, well, yes … Sorry… then, I was just in my underwear and you… crawled in between my legs and…” Harry felt his throat constrict shut. “you… uhm, you.” Harry shot his eyes around the room.
“Back to my flat.”
Now Draco could see Harry’s chosen prey for the night.
“I’m gonna cum!” Harry announced, now moving his fist down to wrap around Draco’s erection, rubbing up and down in time with each thrust. The pleasure wracked down deep into Draco’s bones, he felt like he could drown in it, and then, when he was sure he was about to die, the bundle of sensations tipped over the edge, all untangling to pull taught with a squirt of Draco’s orgasm. Draco practically screamed as streams of white spurted from the tip of his cock, and when his arse tugged tight against Harry, he heard Harry come with a shout inside of him.
“The only other way to get back is to wait it out until you naturally age to 2004. However, you would look like fifty-year-old men, which is not ideal.”
“No, what do you want me to do?” Harry felt his throat choke up, it was hard to think with Malfoy’s hand running over Harry’s cock like that.
Draco groaned as he pumped the last few drops out of himself, letting his head fall back against the door.
“Oh My Merlin, look who it is!” Cole suddenly beamed, turning around the room to run in the direction of the new arrivals. “I’m so happy you guys actually came.”
Then he told Cole about seeing him at a gay club with Ginny, then returning to that same gay club just to catch a glimpse of him again, then accidently bumping into Malfoy at Cole’s party (Harry couldn’t help but notice how the corners of Cole’s lips were downturned when Harry described kissing Malfoy for the first time), then, finally to where we was stuck at today. The mysterious crystal ball, which was filled with a preview of Malfoy’s work – Harry could feel his cheeks heating when he spoke about the sphere so he decided to not tell Cole quite what happened in the vision inside, in fear that Harry may adorn an erection in this very public place.
“And I want you to know that I think-”
Harry followed her outside. A few days ago, the garden’s old swamp land had been dug up and replaced with new grass, leaving an empty grass field in place of the dirty mud. Whilst it had given Harry’s wallet quite the punch, it saved him far more time than doing it all by hand.
“Do you enjoy it?”
His first painting was hanging from the wall in a proud mantlepiece. Whilst it was still a piece of shit, it was Harry’s first piece of shit. So, he had decided to give it a special place in his room. Surrounding it was four other canvases, one still wet with paint.
“What?” Harry asked, sure he had misheard what Malfoy said.
Okay so, I've got to admit the idea of Harry strip dancing to sexy back just seemed too amusing to not write about. But anyways, what do you guys think?
What the fuck is a base note?
“You’re out of-“ He paused upon seeing Harry’s face. “Shampoo.”
This always meant only one thing: Harry had another one of his boy toys round.
“I said, show me.”
He sipped his tea.
He hadn’t had a wet dream since his school days and, frankly,  a twenty-five-year-old man should not be put in the position that the only action he gets are in his dreams. Harry felt the sharp pang of shame bubble in his belly.
Harry sighed and decided to get dressed. Luckily as it was a Sunday, he didn’t have to go to work until 12pm, so he’d let himself sleep in.
Harry just smiled and then looked back to his work.
“So what was the vision like then? I never get to see them?” Malfoy questioned, a mischievous smirk settling on his plump lips.
“What a shame, all the good ones are always straight.”
“But I just did one.”
“Another date! Already?” Draco turned to face Harry, flipping the bacon. “Were you already planning for this one to go badly?”
Draco continued to glare as he laid down the bacon, the sizzle not soothing him in the slightest.
“Fine well, let’s talk payement instead. How much will you charge?” Malfoy asked.
“Interesting.”
Harry easily added another finger to Malfoy’s already streched arse and began thrusting the two in and out, unable to look away from how his fingers disapeared and reappeared into the ring. Harry copied Malfoy’s scissoring movement, ignoring the small resistance offered from Malfoy’s hole.
“Yes.”
So, Harry made his way into the café. There weren’t many seats, maybe five tables in total, but there was one that was small and circular with a single chair tucked under it that seemed to be calling Harry’s name. Harry checked his wristwatch. Five pm. Still early enough for a coffee. Harry dropped his coat on the table and then walked up to the counter.
Draco groaned into his pillow.
“Because of this, he hasn’t necessarily gone through all the procedures to be a fully qualified Auror, therefore I want him to work with the best Auror we have here, who just so happens to be you.” Harry mulled over the thought in his head, Kingsley’s reasoning made sense and he was sympathetic for Malfoy’s position but… The idea of working with the blond made him cringe.
“Sorry,” She chuckled, “it’s the pregnancy hormones, they give me a godly amount of strength.”
“I think you’re forgetting how hard life was for me for so long. How many people I’ve watched die around me. And I’ve done the wrong thing before, thousands of times, and I’ve never lied about it. But hurting the innocent and then lying –
