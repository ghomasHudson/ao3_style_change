McGonagall tries to push through, but the other Auror—a short, stocky woman—blocks her. “Draco, your father has been captured,” she says, voice strained.
Draco shakes his head, fighting a rising heat in his face for what feels like the hundredth time that day.
Harry snaps his head around, looks at Draco, and looks at Leon’s hand tangled in his. “Oh, it’s okay. Draco already knows.”
Harry’s blood goes cold. Of course she had; working in the Hospital Wing she must have overheard that entire exchange following Draco’s near miss with death. Permanent death, at least. Rowan has been killing just to get in and out of Hogwarts, as well as orchestrating a chain of horrible events to torture the students. No doubt the deepest and blackest of magic has been involved in the controlling of whatever horrible things live beneath the castle.
Ron sighs but nods, then turns from the crowd and takes a quick sip. “Hermione’s enchanted it,” he says as he turns back and wipes his mouth. “Fits a whole bottle.”
A crash resounds from behind them as an immense lump of stone lands on top of the pile. It completely blocks off the Great Hall, and still the pile creeps forward, the entire room flooding with the castle’s innards.
Then Harry is back in his body again. Bloody hell, he wished he could stop dissociating like that. First the pacing, now this staring. It’s entirely involuntary. But Draco Malfoy is a beautiful man. Harry feels like he’s actively recognizing that for the first time.
As for me coming back, it should be within the next couple of days. I’ve loved being home with my family, but I have to admit that Hogwarts is calling my name. While Beauxbatons will always have my heart, there’s something about your castle that’s vying for it as well. Maybe it’s because that’s where you are.
They dart down the hallway in tandem, wands out as the structural integrity of the castle comes into question. Little chunks of rock cascade down from the walls around them, the horrible sound of stone grinding against stone filling the air. As they approach their destination the volume increases; it sounds like a cave collapsing and as the floors wobble, Draco wonders if they’re going to make it to the Great Hall alive.
She nods but doesn’t look convinced. “They told me that you would be able to stay here and heal, but it really looks like you should be transferred—”
,” Madam Pomfrey says, her eyes impossibly wide. “Water, up-to-neck burial, oxygen deprivation. It won’t stop, and it seems it’s not doing damage at the same rate as normal fire would but it’s just as painful. Experts from Mungo’s have been alerted and will be here as soon as they can be, but they’re backed up today!”
“You know, there was a moment when I could’ve sworn somebody else was here,” she says thoughtfully. “Perhaps I should trust my intuition more.”
Harry cries out in pain as the golden ball collides with his hand at such a high velocity. But it’s his, wriggling around in his hand, whizzing whimsically. That buzz of golden wings beating against his hand had been missed.
about you. I didn’t believe them for myself. I’m still not sure I do. You must understand that. But…I don’t know. You do seem vastly different from the person you used to be. At least on the surface.”
“That’s perfect, thank you! It seems your table is rather full, so I think I’ll join that one over there,” he says, pointing over at the Slytherin table, which is already overcome with light blue. Harry notices Malfoy staring blankly into space, not acknowledging any of the action around him.
There’s a strange sort of rolling white noise building, like whispers rolling through an army; the mirrors rattle gently in their frames. Harry looks into his own face, again, and again, and cries out in frustration. The sound echoes, bounces off the walls, but instead of fading away it repeats, over and over, multiplying and growing in volume. In seconds the sound is overwhelming, deafening. Harry claps his hands over his ears, vaguely aware of a gentle stream of blood pouring out the left and into his palm. He stumbles backward, risks a quick swipe at the handle of the door and stumbles back out into the corridor.
The two stand and stare at each other for a tense moment, and when Harry is certain Draco has nothing else to say to him, he huffs and turns on his heel. Before he can go anywhere, Draco’s hand is around his wrist. Harry stops in place, still facing away.
“From what your headmistress has told me, my position is very similar to yours. I'm in charge of making sure relations between our two magical bodies are going smoothly while we're here, as well as acting as a sort of authority figure for the younger students. We never really had a position like it until now.”
, and it’s equal parts endearing and infuriating. “Why are you talking like we’re both being tried, here?”
“If it helps at all, the reason I’m offering this position is because Miss Granger practically begged me to do so.”
Unsurprisingly, most of the Beauxbatons attendance takes residence at the Slytherin table, as there aren’t a great deal of vacant seats elsewhere. In the slight chaos, Draco notices an older looking boy—a bit short and lean, with blonde wavy hair—approaching McGonagall and starting an animated conversation, in which she points in the direction of the Gryffindor table. Intrigued, Draco follows her gesture and sees Potter and his friends speaking with one of the Beauxbatons girls. She looks vaguely familiar but Draco can’t put his finger on why.
A flash of memory. Sobbing in the dungeons, standing too close in the corridor outside McGonagall’s office, a private Patronus lesson that ended too soon.
Draco is awoken the next morning—much to his chagrin—when Blaise grabs his shoulder and gives him a good shake.
She stares at him for a moment, her expression intense. “Of course not. I’m worried you’ve become a target, Draco. I think that girl from earlier was in the wrong place at the wrong time, and it’s likely that Mari was as well. Based on what we discovered earlier, it’s become clear that the castle is not acting of its own accord. These attacks are orchestrated.”
Draco can’t help but smile, which earns him a reproachful look. “Sorry, it’s just…I’m grateful for a reminder that I’m my mother’s son.”
Harry rushes back over to his friends, who spare Draco a parting glance of confusion before being dragged away. Draco can do nothing but watch as they get smaller and smaller; it might be a trick of the distance, but Draco swears he can see Harry and Leon brushing their fingers together as they walk, and suddenly all of the progress he’s made has been snatched away by clawed hands.
Harry nods. “Well. I guess I’ll leave you to your reading then. I hope you find something useful. You’re going to get them back, you know. And until then, they’re safe from harm, halfway across the world.”
“You just undermined yourself in front of the whole class regarding the very lesson you’re teaching.”
He snaps back to the present. Why is Leon making his way toward the dungeons? Draco’s been down there himself, and even the most basic level of evil that he found with Harry was enough to prevent them from really considering a repeat trip. Yes, Leon is the Head Boy for Beauxbatons (or whatever their equivalent is called, Draco doesn’t really care all that much), but Draco is certain that McGonagall would not have granted him permission to access the dungeons, even with the position.
“Well,” Harry says, perfectly aware that his answer is not exactly going to earn him the vote of confidence, “officially, not long yet. But we’ve been getting closer since the beginning of the term. He signed up for my Defense class and one thing sort of led to another…” He trails off, suddenly feeling stupid. Has he been caught up in some juvenile romance, completely ignoring the reality of things? Have Hermione and Ron merely been humoring him?
“Tea?” McGonagall asks quietly, indicating the tray on her desk. He nods, thanking her as she hands him a cup and saucer.
McGonagall is there, and Harry Potter brings up the rear and closes the door behind them. The three of them are shouting suggestions at each other, panicked.
Not wanting to dwell on his own sudden change in tone, Harry readies himself to fight against whatever primordial evil might be waiting for him beyond. He’d faced his fair share of monsters. Trolls, gargantuan spiders, dragons beneath banks. And people, too. People can be monsters. Surely he’ll be able to defend himself against what might lie waiting inside, especially with Draco’s help.
Harry is considering giving a quick warmup talk, but Madam Hooch is calling for positions. He gets a good look at the other team and his head spins for a moment when he sees Draco Malfoy is the other Seeker. Good. They’d done this dance before. Harry knows that when he sees the Snitch, Draco tends to get tunnel vision and forget there are twelve other players in the air. Harry might be able to use that to his advantage.
Harry raises an eyebrow in question and Hermione just exhales happily. “It’s nothing. Leon made a joke about ancient runes. You wouldn’t get it.” She’s right, and Harry finds he doesn’t even feel left out. “You know, I really,
He’s surprised to find that there isn’t a house-elf employed. Though his mother never did love the creatures, he finds it odd that she doesn’t have any help keeping up with the manor.
“Enjoying the show?” he says and looks with wonder at the Great Hall, still spewing chunks of waste and building material and what looks like murky water, which trickles through the glacier of debris crawling out of the hall. The water is dark red.
The room is exactly as he remembers it, though barren of all the pictures he’d taken from the mantel on his birthday. Most of them he left at the Burrow, but one is still in his room at Hogwarts. Hogwarts, where against all odds, he can now turn on the spot and travel to at a moment’s notice. It feels heretical, a rule he’s known all his life suddenly conditional, a barrier that likely kept his life on the line for years.
He shakes his head, a pit forming in his stomach. “They have a right to hate me. I’ve done some things that…” he says, unable to finish, angry that his eyes are stinging wet. “But I don’t want them to.” He swears internally, feeling childish.
Draco freezes. McGonagall still hasn’t announced it to the student body, but surely Harry would have shared that information with her already?
“Of course.” Draco swallows thickly, every pore on fire. He doesn’t have time to consider why kissing Harry feels like being reborn, why it feels like
Draco’s breath catches when he sees the change in Harry’s expression. It’s subtle, but the light in his eyes seems to flicker.
Still, he can’t help but value the logic in that. He’d spent too much time spent on thinking on the way things could have been, how they should have been. Never, not once, at least not since he was much younger, had he considered what might
His heart drops into his gut. He’d forgotten. A bright white scar lays gently across his palm, fully healed. Permanent.
“I’m just…so scared that somehow you’ll slip away,” Harry whispers. It hits Draco like a hex in the gut, his throat sore from the effort of not crying. “We’ve come so far, and what if it’s all for nothing?”
Harry cocks his head and curls his hands into fists, then releases them. “First of all, Luna was the one who brought that up. Second of all, this is not about
“Like…do we tell people? I mean, of course we will eventually. I guess ‘when’ is really the question.”
The two of them approach McGonagall, who is still standing behind the podium looking wistfully at the retreating student body.
They repeat the same thing for the left side, and after Harry counts off he almost flips backward when his own wand is blasted from his hand.
Leon’s lips quirk into a smile. “Hi. This is kind of weird. I’m somehow eighteen years old and a newborn infant all at once.”
“And then…What you said to me the other day…I could tell you were just trying to hurt me. To push away. You chose your words so they would sting. And they
Another pause. “Then it might be best to let things play out as they will. Especially if there’s a possibility that you have it all wrong.”
Draco stands at the stove, pushing bacon around a pan with some hesitance. Though he’d assured Harry he would be fine here on his own, cooking and taking care of the house, there is definitely a lack of prior experience that has him approaching each task with extra care.
“I know we’ve spoken about you becoming an Auror. Is that not something you’re interested in anymore?”
“When I call your name, step forward.” She looks down at a list of names and starts to call players forward. Harry is safe from the first two teams, but Ron and Ginny have been chosen to play against each other. Excellent. If anything, it’ll be a compelling game.
He wonders how Harry does it. Quidditch, Dumbledore’s Army, teaching Defense classes… He manages to be firm and taken seriously, but he also has a warmth to him. A brightness, a welcoming quality that makes people
“Really excellent job, mate,” Neville says quietly as he hands Harry his writing. “Really reminds me of the DA days, but much less stressful.”
Draco raises his eyebrows, impressed. “I would think she would want to do something…I don’t know. Brainier?”
The world is in Leon’s eyes. Harry sees love and he sees family and he sees lazy afternoons and winters by the fire and play fighting and real arguments and special sweets on birthdays. He sees expectations and plans being made and reunions anticipated. He sees happiness. He sees openness, and the need to share, and the primal human desire for someone,
They both cringe as someone on the other side of the bookshelf shushes them. Hermione’s cheeks darken.
“Er, Professor,” Draco says. “I don’t think she’s in any condition to be taking the Gryffindors upstairs. I can drop off the Hufflepuffs and then take them.”
He’s unsure if anybody is even around to hear; nobody had come when Mari screamed the first time, after all. Draco takes a deep breath, tries to fill his body with false positivity as he screams “
Both Leon and the man laugh together, a dissonant harmony of height and gravel that rakes across Harry’s skin. They’ve reached the bottom of the stairs—the man walks with a cane, his right leg not bending as he moves. “I’m Potter’s replacement, of course. A brand new Savior, if you will.”
Ginny’s shoulders tense noticeably at the sound of his name, then relax. She turns. “Oh. ’llo,” she says
I would be in shambles, but honestly I’m handling everything really well. It was like a sucker punch initially, but then things just sort of went back to how they’ve always been, so it doesn’t hurt as much. Plus, being made Prefect was very validating, and I think people will start to come around because of that.”
“Yeah, but when most people come out, Harry, they don’t try to throw their ex-girlfriend into the middle of their new relationship.”
She sighs and nods. “Should you change your mind, I am prepared to allow you to attend as a…safety monitor or sorts. We’re trying to gather a task force. A few other Prefects have already agreed to sacrifice their nights in order to ensure the safety of their fellow students. There will be some Aurors in attendance, of course, but it would be nice to have somebody who knows so much about the situation keeping an eye on things from the ground.”
“Of course she is. And it’s taken every fiber not to find a way to reach out to her, but I don’t want to involve her in this if I can help it. She’s gone through far too much, she deserves some peace.”
He huffs and nods. “I definitely think so,” he says, tongue tripping over the words. All of the inward speculation is coming back to him, the questions of why he’s feeling things at such a primal level, the brief flashes of inexplicable, disproportionate emotion. “Fuck,” he breathes, sliding off his bed and onto the carpet.
“He’s implicated Draco. Mostly lies, I presume. The charges were largely related to Lucius’ evasion of the law: treason, obstruction of justice, harboring a war criminal…”
Draco cringes at this, already awaiting the reactions. There’s surprisingly nothing verbal, but Pansy makes a sort of half-choking noise and Blaise looks up from his book for the first time since Draco entered the compartment. And then the door is closed, and Pansy Parkinson explodes.
“See for yourself,” Blaise says. “Something that public and of that magnitude is much harder to hide.” He sounds resigned, even afraid as he sits down on the edge of his own bed.
Harry tries to run through his schedule in his head. He has a Defense class to teach in the afternoon, and Charms right before that. But nothing after.
The door to Madam Pomfrey’s room flies open and the world bursts into chaos. Madam Pomfrey herself is there, carefully ushering in a younger looking student who is obviously the source of the screaming. His entire body is covered in black flames, and he can barely walk. He collapses onto the ground as soon as he enters.
“You see, therapy isn’t a cookie-cutter experience. Yes, we’ve all been through a collective trauma, but it affects people in such different ways that there’s no
He shushes her, though she had said it very quietly to begin with. “I think so. I mean, yes, I do. But I didn’t want to look like an absolute idiot and ask him to the ball if he’s completely straight.” Hermione is looking at the ground now, her mouth hanging open slightly, Draco keeps talking. “So I figured I might just sort of…ask you whether he is or not. To potentially avoid making a fool of myself. Though I’m sure you’d love to see that.”
Harry takes another step forward and jabs his finger into Draco’s chest. “Why were you following him?”
While it’s understandable why she’s so taken aback, her commitment to not giving Draco any kind of answer is only rubbing against his nerves. He plops back down into the bench. The gears turning in her head are practically visible, and while the idea is a bit outlandish given their history, Draco is confused why it’s taking her so much to rationalize it. She’s the smartest person in their year, after all.
A weird sort of tightness is developing in Draco’s chest. These words are really coming from someone his age, someone who has been thrown headfirst into the world with no place to land. While he’s never noticed Harry to be particularly bookish, he can see now that there’s an indisputable wisdom built on experience. It’s what makes him unique. Sure, you could sit around for years and study for hours on end and read book after book, and that would give you a pretty good grasp on a variety of things.
Leon shakes his head, sniffling. “I tried to think that way at first, but it’s just too hard. I can’t keep going on expecting to see her again. So I...my parents are already mourning her, like she’s
Leon is still. For a moment, and another, he doesn’t speak. Then, he sighs. “I don’t want to push you, like I said,” though it sounds like he’s pushing to Harry. “It just makes me sad to think that you could be missing out on something so important.”
Draco stifles a laugh, thanks Madam Pomfrey (who looks less than happy but certainly relieved to have them out of her hair), and joins Luna in their walk to Ravenclaw Tower. To his surprise, she’s silent for most of the trip, until they make their final turn.
His heart stutters as he approaches the classroom where Harry is currently teaching a class. He can only imagine the room full of bright-eyed students preparing for O.W.L.s (poor sixth years have to take it a year late) and latching onto his every word.
“I suppose you’re right.” He turns to the portrait of the Fat Lady, who has already fallen asleep. He clears his throat loudly and she wakes up, disgruntled, then bursts into tears as soon as she sees who disturbed her slumber. She blubbers for a minute about being eternally grateful to Harry for saving the castle, her only home, and then swings forward without asking for the password. Harry gestures for Leon to climb through the portrait hole and follows suit, shaking his head.
“Because you’re Harry Potter? No. I’ve seen your flying improve year after year, boy. The whole savior business has nothing to do with it. But while we’re on the topic, good stuff, there.”
Harry nods. “Do you have any idea what might be going on?” He bites his cheek. As much as he loves Luna, he must be desperate to ask her opinion on a mystery like this one.
“I can work with that,” Harry says. He rejoins their hands and takes another look around before they continue their walk.
“He is just as unsure as you are how he ended up there, coincidentally. A moment of panic overtook him and he Disapparated without a destination in mind. According to his retelling of the situation, it was more a feeling, an animal desire for safety.”
I know you just left today, but for some reason I’ve just had this urge to talk to you. I suppose that’s why I’m awake at 2 in the morning writing to you. It feels like there’s so much more that still needs to be said. Funny, because I have no idea what that is. Sorry again, first of all, I suppose. I don’t know if I’ll ever stop saying sorry for the way I treated you. There’s no excuse for how I acted, especially when you were nothing but kind. In any case, I hope things are well at home and that your family can be at peace for a while. For forever, really. I wish that for you. Peace forever. You’ve been through too much for anything else.
it. He’s survived more than most wizard scholars can even imagine. He’s been forced into corner after corner and fought his way out every time. Draco doesn’t even know the details, doesn’t know all of the skirmishes he’s been through and all of the things and people he’s seen. But he can
Harry can tell Leon’s trying to power through it for his sake, but he’ll never be able to live with himself if his boyfriend sits alone at a table all night.
“But I almost fell apart entirely. I managed to pick myself up, but only after you put your literal body between me and the threat. That snapped me back to reality.”
Draco nods politely to the other three before sitting next to Blaise, dreading any more conversation that includes inquiries about his summer. It had been absolute hell, and reliving it is so far off his to-do list it may as well be someone else’s job. To his relief, Blaise makes almost no effort to indicate he’s noticed Draco’s presence, instead focusing on a very new looking book.
Leon slinks down the staircase opposite the hall’s entrance, a hand tracing the railing as he descends. There’s a man behind him—who bears an odd resemblance to Lucius Malfoy, Harry thinks: straight, silver hair, tall and slim, but with a beard and a crooked mouth, the right half drooping—with a tight grip on Leon’s shoulder. But Leon doesn’t look scared. He looks…proud.
Draco finds himself drifting off during Potions. Odd for him. The ultra-strength burn salve he’s working on is bubbling away in front of him, warm odors of eucalyptus and aloe vera drifting past his distracted eyes. He blinks hard, forcing his vision back into focus as he gazes into the cauldron at the mint-green liquid. He allows himself a slight smile, as things are going almost better than he’d anticipated. Slughorn is shuffling around the front of the room, casting brief glances at other students’ work, not concerned with upper-level students. He catches Draco’s eye; he gives the professor a small nod and returns to his own potion, giving it four full stirs around clockwise before turning the heat up a small degree.
Ron cracks a smile. “How am I supposed to say no? It was my dream as a kid to be captain of a Hogwarts Quidditch team. And then…I met you, and Quidditch things happened the way they did, and I made peace with the fact that it would be you and that was just as good, if not better. But now…”
He sees Hermione narrow her eyes in apprehension and he continues. “After that, we’ll sit down and write a little bit about our experience with the spell, comparing our results to what’s expected of you as laid out in your textbooks.”
Whoah. Strange thoughts. Push that to the back and move on. He finally stands as the other two finish up their assignment and take leave.
“Besides, if I really mess anything up…” She steps in front of him and waggles her wand back and forth. “I
“Alright, well let’s at least show Mrs. Weasley that we haven’t died first,” Hermione says, taking Harry’s arm again as they Apparate back home.
“That’s it, good, good. Let’s get you to the hospital wing, dearie. I’ve got her Minerva, thank you.”
“Oh, bollocks, I’m sorry,” Harry says. “I wasn’t even thinking. We’re not exactly just two lads changing clothes anymore,” he says with an ironic twang.
She shrugs again, crossing her arms. “I was just hoping we would get to spend our first night back together. All three of us.”
“The emotional concentration? I think that just refers to feeling things with a strength you’ve never felt before.”
family. Things will never be exactly the way they were, so I implore that you take this opportunity to embrace that change for the better.”
He can’t do this right now. Not after the day he’s had. He’s been trying to prepare himself for a hypothetical apology, but now the intended recipient is rushing directly at him and Harry’s head is a mess of emotions because he
“Well, this passage specifically mentions that the two subjects would have to be together for this mirroring business to occur. It may be that physical proximity is a deciding factor in the equation. After all, there is a certain physicality about it. I mean, think about how having some of your blood in Draco’s system allowed him to bypass the bloodline wards.”
Draco gets out of bed and stands as calmly as he can given the situation. “That’s what I was hiding from you earlier. I saw him go down into the dungeons, and then that girl was taken. When everybody else was distracted, he came out looking guilty as anything.”
Draco considers this; the last time Harry had been at Malfoy Manor was under some fairly upsetting circumstances (to put it lightly), and the thought of his second visit being in the midst of more peril makes Draco’s skin crawl. The idea of he himself going home makes him squirm, at that. But he owes it to his mother to give her the truth, to let her know he’s safe.
“Spoken like a true homosexual,” Ginny murmurs to herself. Then, slightly louder, “What if it doesn’t work?”
Harry can’t really explain it himself. Something had shifted in him. He’s not sure when it started, but looking back on his relationship with Ginny, it just feels so out of place. Even thinking about Cho doesn’t make his heart jump the way it used to, the way it did even after the odd falling out they’d had.
“It’s been a bit of a disaster so far, really,” Potter admits, scratching the back of his head. “Luna and I have already broken up two fights.”
But then he thinks about what might happen if somebody found out. The press would have an absolute field day. People would absolutely think of him differently. Even if it’s not a bad different, it’s a
Back in the common room, much of the chatter has died down to a quieter rumble, many of the couples choosing to spend their time with their lips together instead of talking. Things could get uncomfortable if Harry doesn’t get them downstairs soon, but he has to make sure his situation is squared away before that can happen.
“Gentlemen, as I’m sure you can imagine, we don’t have time to chat,” Rowan says, and something in Harry latches onto the flicker of worry in his eyes as they dart toward the Great Hall. Rowan’s voice remains even, cold, but there’s trepidation beneath the icy surface. “Harry, if you would set down your wand and come join us.”
Slughorn pauses and looks over his shoulder. “No, no, I suppose now will do. Just give me a moment,” he says and closes the door. There’s a faint
She clicks her beak at him but is apparently satisfied as she takes off, gliding out the window and out of sight.
She looks taken aback, but after a moment she also smiles. She stands, brushes the hair out of his face and kisses his forehead. Narcissa Malfoy had never been an affectionate woman, but Draco can see how the war changed her. That, and her husband…well…He’s already in enough pain. No point in going into that right now.
. It’s selfish to lash out at me like this to try to drive this fictional wedge between Leon and me. I won’t do this with you anymore. Move on. I hope you get better.”
“I love you, too,” he says back, trying to ignore the tightness in his chest. She smiles and gives him a little wave, and then she’s gone.
“I would stay longer, but I think it’s best if you get some rest. And Draco, I…I would really appreciate it if you would write me more often, once you’re better,” she says, hardly able to maintain eye contact. “It gets a bit lonely in the Manor, you know, and with your—”
know what this feels like,” Draco says, his voice low and hoarse. He tears his wrist out of Harry’s grip.
A sharp breeze ripples across the lake, spraying cool water through the air. It snaps Harry back to reality just in time for him to trip and hit the ground.
“Of course, Albus,” she says with a nod. “Come, let’s let them talk,” she says, placing one arm each around Ron’s and Hermione’s shoulders and whisking them out of her office.
Ron smiles. “Though this is going to take a little bit of time for me to get used to, I can see that you’re happy when you talk about him.”
“Well, I mean, everything is sort of in free-fall right now, isn’t it? We still have no word on Hogwarts and what’s happening to it. What if it doesn’t reopen?”
Harry chuckles, sticking out his hand. “Head Boy, yeah, that’s me. Harry Potter,” he says, introducing himself.
Draco looks at him, stares into those green eyes. A moment of jealousy, utter envy washes over him and he wants to tell Harry, to ruin everything that might exist between him and this other boy. Harry’s eyes flit to Draco’s hair and he remembers he’s sporting a new look. He had really been hoping Harry would first see it under different circumstances. He was hoping, perhaps foolishly so, that a drastic appearance change might change something in Harry, as well.
“What was I just saying about intuition, Draco? After everything you just told me, it was quite obvious,” she says, chuckling. “At first I wondered if I was interpreting things incorrectly, and then you told me about the blood magic and it clicked into place.”
“However, I’m willing to sort of…start over. Provided you tell me the truth and don’t try to push me away the way you did as we move forward. I don’t think I can take that ever again. It will break me.” He sighs. “I know the timing is bad with me leaving, but I think I need the space anyway to think about everything and start to heal. But Harry, I…I want to try this. With you.”
Harry desperately wants to gush to her about the piece of parchment folded neatly in his right hand, but he refrains. “It’s been fine. I was on my way out, but do you want any company?” It’s a long shot, especially because she seems set on being productive. There’s a look in her eyes that Harry knows well.
She nods, pursing her lips. He can tell she wants to say something but she holds back, simply nodding again with a bit more fervor and sighing. “First period starts in less than ten minutes, we should probably head out.”
“‘lo, Draco,” she says. She sniffs and elects to survey the food selection instead of making eye contact.
Harry Potter wakes up on his eighteenth birthday, feeling unusually well rested. He takes a moment to stretch, yawning and noticing the soft light pouring in through the window. Ron is still asleep, snoring softly. Harry lazily plunks his glasses on to his face after rubbing his eyes, then stands to look out at the backyard.
Her voice carries as she’s led to somewhere where she can be calmed down, and after a minute passes McGonagall returns with a man and a woman wearing Ministry robes. She talks to them in a low voice, efficient and bordering on panicked. The two investigators draw their wands and rush into the dungeons. The headmistress crosses her arms and purses her lips. With one final unsure look in Draco’s direction, she turns and leaves.
, Harry?” Draco asks, part of him overwhelmingly relieved that Harry is on his side without question. But another part of him wonders if even that is enough, and it’s louder.
After what feels like only seconds, what he wishes were long hours, Draco pulls away. Harry’s eyes are still closed, lips shiny and red, faced flushed. Draco leans in once more and kisses him again, quickly, but with the knowledge that he’ll never be able to stop now that he knows, oh, he
He spins in a circle and takes in this patch of the Room of Hidden Things, this territory where he’d spent much of his sixth year at Hogwarts. “It should be right here,” he says, pointing with a shaky finger. “Where’s it gone?”
Or he could be making it all up. He knows next to nothing about Leon except that he’s the Head Boy for Beauxbatons, and he knows that means Harry has probably had to get close to him. For all he knows they’re just good friends and all of this turmoil is baseless.
The lock around his arm releases and he quickly stows his wand away. For a moment, Harry and Draco stare at each other. Neither says anything more. Then, Draco turns on his heel and takes off down the hallway, pushing through the ranks of observers.
something that Harry has ever even considered. Growing up in the Muggle world, he’s heard some things about homosexuals, many of which have not exactly been positive. A few different words keep creeping toward the front of his mind, taunting him. Poof. Fairy. Fag. Queer. Perv. It makes his vision swim and his chest constrict, because he doesn’t agree with those things himself. At least, he doesn’t think so. He’s never even met a gay person before, not that he knows of. But he has no reason to think negatively of gay people.
“Hey, everyone, look here,” Harry projects over the din. “Once you start to get more advanced with the spell, you can actually control where exactly your opponent’s wand goes. For example, into your own hand, like Hermione’s done!”
“Have we received bad news? You all look like someone’s…” she trails off, all four of them cringing at her unfortunate turn of phrase. “Shit, I didn’t mean—”
? I’ve been nothing but evil to you for nearly a decade, I…” He stops himself before he really hashes out the extent of his wrongdoing. Maybe another time. “And then you just risk your life, possibly your education, your
whole situation with Mari. Compartmentalizing. Burying himself in his work or simply trying to think about other things. He can’t even get into that in this moment. His reputation is still in the gutter, but he’s hoping the fickle social hivemind of Hogwarts will turn away from him in the near future.
Breakfast is delicious and spirits are high all around for the first time in a long time. An ineffable weight has been hanging above the Burrow for months now, its inhabitants tiptoeing around the pain they all share. There would be time, eventually, to reopen that wound and let it heal properly, but the quick cover-up is what they need now just to get through. Harry’s been itching to get out of the house and
He runs through possibilities in his head. Assuming Draco didn’t lose his wits entirely before he fled, there’s no way he would have taken himself to Malfoy Manor; that’s the first place the Ministry will look. Likewise, he wouldn’t have gone to any of his friends’ homes, which…really only rules out Blaise and Pansy. Where else?
In his peripheral vision, someone sprints away from the walls of the Hall where panicked students have gathered as they try to press their way out the doors and into the presumed safety of the rest of the school. It’s a familiar body, one Harry thinks he recognizes, the way it moves flipping some switch inside him. The person skids to a halt in front of Harry and Hermione, who has gone eerily silent next to him as the Dementors continue to spiral madly around them, taking, taking, taking.
There’s a moment when everything freezes, when Harry realizes it doesn’t matter, that he’s finally met an end he can’t skirt around. And then, a great wind whips through the Great Hall, a silvery, warm zephyr that ruffles his hair and makes him think of summer. The Dementors scatter and flee, howling as they zip away.
“I’m sorry,” he says, looking down at the road beneath him. Sure enough, he realizes just how long the shadows around him have become. “I didn’t realize…”
Harry nods and sighs as he disappears the two chairs. Draco is stunned. It takes some gall as a student to ask the
“What. The fuck. Are you doing?” she repeats. “You’ve never been the most emotionally adept boy, but asking Luna to the ball
When someone else pushes past him he remembers that he had actually left his compartment with a purpose and starts back down the train to change, his mind and body moving at different speeds down the train. It isn’t a novel sensation, this detachment of mind and body. Like he’s physically there, but mentally he’s floating off somewhere, completely disconnected from the world around him. Which is why he’s surprised to find himself back at the Slytherin compartment, wearing the correct garments. As he opens the door, Pansy’s shrill voice snaps him back to reality.
“Oh, is that treacle tart?” he asks as he sits. He gives Leon a playful jab with his elbow and scoops a large piece onto his place.
Harry sighs through his nose. “No, I suppose not. Look, Draco, I think I owe you something of an apology for the way I spoke to you last week. I’ll admit that it was uncalled for. However—” he says, holding a finger up before Draco can speak, “if you think this means I’m not still angry with you for what you said, you would be wrong.”
“Well, yes, there’s that…” Harry says. He looks like he’s about to say something else, but the words don’t come.
, Pansy. We chose a side in that war, and it was the wrong bloody one,” he says, refusing to break eye contact. “Owning up to that feels like leaving behind everything we ever stood for, because it is. As I have already mentioned, the whole world practically changed overnight. I’m done with all of this petty, baseless hatred. Yes, I’m going to learn Defense Against the Dark Arts from the person who single-handedly defeated the Dark Lord, the very same Dark Lord
He almost jumps when the door opens and instead closes his eyes, not quite ready to be “awake” yet. Two people come into the room and the door shuts quickly behind them as they start to argue quietly.
“Now, this.” Harry’s whole body goes into overdrive as Leon steps inward. His heart threatens to explode when the blond has to stand up on his toes to get close. The mechanics of the kiss come so naturally: Harry’s hand gently lifting Leon’s soft jaw, the other resting on the side of his cheek. It’s yet another kind of kiss, not like the intense, emotionally charged ones from before. It’s sweet and chaste and it makes Harry’s stomach do a flip.
about it,” Harry says, his eyes wide at the thought. “It’s complicated, but I promise it’s…a preexisting condition.”
But Harry smiles, because he understands completely. Across the table he meets Hermione’s eye; there’s a flash of something there, but she doesn’t say anything to him. He quickly looks away, clearing his throat.
Leon nods. “She’s clearly going through something. Think about this scenario from her perspective. In the last fifteen minutes, you’ve told her you’re gay, told her you have a boyfriend, and then asked her to be his date to a school function. That’s a lot to process all at once.”
Save for the “oh” that had slipped through Harry’s slick, rosy lips following the slap and the muffled “mmph” upon reconnection, the room is silent. For a brief moment, in the eye of Harry’s mind he sees a figure, hard angles and platinum hair. Eyes of silver. He pushes this image away, because the edges are sharp and rough and all he wants is the round, softness that’s in his arms.
“Actually,” Harry says, “he did. He was grateful to be alive at all, which definitely softened the blow.”
Draco shakes his head and blinks away tears. “I can’t do this right now,” he mutters as he turns again, only to be whipped around once more.
“Well, this breakfast isn’t going to make itself!” Molly says and jumps out of her seat. She shoos Bill away from the eggs and sausage; he resumes his position with his feet up on another chair.
Leon breaks into a run and Harry’s insides twist. There’s a very large unknown factor sprinting down the corridor, and Harry is the mark.
Madam Hooch is thanking the other players for coming out and giving it their all and encouraging them to come back whenever the next set of openings is. Some look hopeful. Others defeated. Harry reckons they’ll all try again anyway. Or hopes so, at least.
So it’s with surprise that Draco approaches his proxy common room, the door hanging open. He frowns, creeping toward it. It seems that things are normal inside; a few students are gathered around a table, already hard at work on something
“Hello, Draco,” she says. She returns to her book. “Did you need something?” Her tone is guarded. Angry, even. He supposes he can’t blame her.
Draco takes a step backward, almost steps on Harry’s hands. “You’re insane,” he spits. “The staff will be on their way. They’ll stop this.”
Then, Hermione surprises him even more. Begrudgingly, she rolls a small black band off her wrist and hands it to him, disdain still in her eyes.
“I trust his judgement. We’ve made sure to leave room in the schedules of students who might be interested in taking the class, so there’s nothing to worry about there.”
Harry sighs and realizes the conversation has to end; they’re too close to the music for him to hear Luna’s sedated drone. It’s like the band saw them coming and made arrangements. The song suddenly switches to one with a slower tempo, a modern waltz of sorts.
“I’m sorry, I…” Draco says. He fights a bubbling pool of nausea that threatens to boil over his edge as he takes a step away. Had he misread?
“Not last time I checked, no,” he replies, pulling his arm out of her grip. “Are you referring to something specific?”
“During the battle, it is likely that damage was done that has released or activated some of this ancient magic. I must emphasize that the areas we have marked out of bounds
Then, “Draco?” The voice is a miracle from a floor below. With just two syllables, the house seems to come alive, warmth seeping back into the colors, Draco’s pulse letting up for the first time in an hour. Maybe it’s his imagination, but he hears a faint tingling, like a wind chime.
Harry’s pulse is rapid and he’s starting to sweat in the sunlight. The story brings back memories of the Battle of Hogwarts, of students frantically checking in with each other as they dodged curses and tried to hold their ground.
Harry sighs that way people do after a good laugh. “Why not? I know how you feel. And I know how I feel. Do you?”
“I reckon just about everybody has,” Draco says. He starts to turn around, but Harry grabs his wrist.
regarding the Harry Potter situation, and he finally feels like he may be able to find a place in the castle again. Content…No, content doesn’t even begin to cover it.
It’s starting to get too dark, whatever the case may be. Plus, his growling stomach is as good an indication as any that his alone time should come to an end. He sighs, the thought of finding a spot at what has essentially become the Beauxbatons table putting a damper on his appetite. He turns around, staring for a second at the Draco-shaped indentation in the grass. How lovely would it be to just lie down again and drift off into his own private oblivion? He genuinely contemplates it for a moment, but finally rips his gaze away from his quiet hiding place and starts his trek back to the castle, chastising himself for being foolish.
” he cries because Harry rips away from Draco’s grasp with a noise like a snarl and tries to push past him back toward the library.
Draco shoves his fingernails into his own palms, the fists so tight he feels muscles straining. The two boys glare at each other for one beat, two, and then Draco closes the distance again and shoves his finger in Harry’s face. His fingertip is stained dark red; he’s drawn blood with his nails. “I am
He shakes his head, his face grim. “Things are a little bit scary right now, so I get it. It’s just frustrating, because I want to help.”
“Sorry to bother you. Keep up the good work,” Harry says. He turns on his heel and practically jogs away, returns, shuts the door, and then quick footsteps sound from the hallway as he retreats.
Mari sighs through her nose, giving him a slightly disappointed look. “Well, all of that was rather vague, so it’s hard for me to really give you an informed answer. Are you
Chris whoops and everybody else smirks. Harry is actually rather pleased to discover it’s a relatively quiet group. Given the big personalities that he’s used to dealing with on the Gryffindor team, he predicts this will be an easier team to wrangle.
Truthfully, Draco thinks it’s a terrible idea to delay the discussion, but he needs time to concoct a way to have Leon distracted or else it will all be for nothing.
“Oh,” Draco says when they turn the first corner. Halfway down, the ceiling has collapsed entirely, blocking them from going much further. Harry tries to determine where on the first floor the fall-in sits beneath, but he’s lost his bearings. A strange sense of despair has settled into his joints, as if the dungeons of Hogwarts were ever a place he enjoyed or even felt welcome.
“Hermione had the same reaction. I don’t blame you. You don’t have to believe me right now, but the least you can do is
“It’s okay,” Harry pulls away, smiling. Leon looks concerned. “No, really, it’s fine! I think I need a break, anyway.”
Kingsley hums—probably in the middle of a biscuit, Draco thinks—then takes a moment before responding. “We’re combing through as much correspondence as possible to see if there’s any definitive record of Draco contacting Lucius or vice versa. If nothing is found, the claims Lucius has made don’t have much of a foundation.”
Draco scoffs and stands. He walks lines in the carpet, one hand massaging a temple. “It doesn’t matter if his claims are all false. Until we find a way to prove that, everything we do is going to be used against us.”
Leon promised he wouldn’t be a distraction, and technically he’s doing his best. He’s quiet, he’s still, and he hasn’t made any attempts to get Harry to stop.
“You did?” Draco says, leaning forward. He’d known Harry would have to bring it up eventually but the news is still a shock—he’d have thought Harry might warn him first. “When?”
She grins. “I didn’t have the same luxury with my dad. I was underage and all that. Plus, hair growing charms can be a bit tricky. Anyway, the point is, I probably won’t make any mistakes because I’m used to higher stakes.”
Leon looks at the ground. “Well, yes. Of course I’d heard rumors about you. I never allowed myself to form any real defined opinion on you, but based on certain facts that I knew I suppose I made some assumptions anyway.”
I really hope this is a satisfying enough ending to the first 2/3s of the story ;-; I've really been putting off writing it because I was scared of not doing it justice!! It probably could have come together a bit better but oh well, it's still more or less the effect I was aiming for. The next 11 chapters will be very Drarry focused and will hopefully pull together some other major plot points that haven't been resolved (stuff from back in the first couple of chapters, even!) Let me know what y'all think!! <3
Luna clears her throat. “While he’s usually very humble about it, I don’t think we can deny that Harry is incredibly selfless, and has been toward the two of us personally on many occasions. It doesn’t feel like such a big ask to me.”
“Well, we can’t have that, can we?” she jokes. “No matter. I’m sure I don’t need to tell you this, Harry, but you’re just as much a child to me as any of the red-haired monsters stomping around this place. Hermione too, of course, but,” she reaches out and makes a futile attempt at smoothing down his hair, “you especially. Even if it’s not by blood or marriage, it’s by choice. I choose you. Always will.”
“Right,” he says, his head far off. “Something to think about.” With everything going on, he’s gone a bit off track in terms of thinking about his future. There’s still time, but not much. Not enough. But there’s never enough time.
“Regardless, it seems to me that Potions is something that will be in your future in one way or another, and you might just think about how more specifically. I’m not saying you should join the Healing Corps and work with the sickest of the sick in the bowels of St. Mungo’s, either. The developmental side of things is more removed and methodical, and I happen to think you would excel there.”
“Fine, that makes things even easier. So I guess the question is: could you accept that happiness, even with the possibility that some of the emotion isn’t your own?”
“The blood magic,” Harry says weakly, a tear dripping onto his tongue. He looks down at his palm, the faint scar still stretched across the soft skin.
“Yeah, fine. I’m just nervous is all,” Harry says as Hermione slips her arm through Leon’s and whisks him somewhere else in the common room. Leon gives Harry a fond smile over his shoulder as he goes.
“I was just sort of hoping to fade into the crowd a bit more this year,” Harry sighs. Ron snorts, shaking his head.
is buddy-buddy with you now! The whole world’s gone sideways, and I feel like I didn’t come with it. I fell on my arse instead.”
This letter stuns him, his eyes rushing back and forth between ‘8th Year Head Boy,’ ‘uniquely and specifically suited,’ and ‘thank you, Harry.’ He reads and rereads the letter a few more times, tuning in vaguely to the muttering around him. Mrs. Weasley had joined them at some point as he hears her say something about writing Bill and Fleur to tell them about Beauxbatons, and Ron worrying about what kind of living quarters compromises might have to be made.
She sighs. “That’s the thing, Draco. Nobody should have to live like that. Especially if you know you’re both innocent.”
Draco nods and swallows what feels like a whole cauldron in his throat. “Probably, yes.” It marks a change in Harry, too, Draco feels. Back in the beginning of their friendship, Harry had been quite adamant that the past was the past and that rehashing it wasn’t necessary. Draco saw that as quite naive, so he’s relieved to find that Harry is now willing to delve into that pain.
“Leon,” he chokes out, his grip on Ginny and the other girl slipping. Their arms hit the floor and the man grins, only with the left side of his face.
Harry huffs and takes a step toward him. “Don’t be so dramatic. It’s a hard spell.” He pauses. “Draco, could it be…”
“It is indeed so. I think I should have a talk with myself about self-sabotage. The point is, I’m realizing now that a lot of that excitement was only born out of the fact that it was the first real relationship I’ve ever had with another bloke, you know? And something about that fact alone felt so right. It probably could’ve been anybody and I would’ve felt the same.”
That is, until a month later when they’re standing on Platform Nine and Three Quarters, Ron and Ginny trying to pacify a near hysterical Mrs. Weasley. The Hogwarts Express sits gloriously in front of them, dark smoke billowing upward. Despite all of the bustle, Harry manages to accidentally make eye contact with the very person they’d assumed would not be coming back.
No, it can’t be. Harry would never let himself get so close to the enemy, right? Draco has learned that the boy can be naive at times, but never so foolish as to let himself be tricked to that degree. Of course, there’s also the added aspect of a potential relationship, which just makes Draco’s stomach turn. As soon as Blaise had mentioned it, the idea became too real; it was no longer solely a construct of Draco’s imagination.
him, and sure enough his hair feels fluffy, freshly washed, and there’s no hint of grime on his body. No blood. Could it all have been a dream?
and some others are lounging around and chatting. He enters, shrugging off the pointed looks that wrap around him, and approaches the group of people in conversation.
, get out of my kitchen and dry yourself off! Honestly, I thought I raised you kids better than this,” she says to herself and goes back to the stove.
He’s afraid to step into that light, because once he does, everybody on the other side of the window will see him for who he really is. In order to truly bask in the glow, that truthful radiance that Leon turned his head toward—the same radiance that resides in Leon’s skull in the form of his amber eyes—Harry has to take the step forward.
“No, listen to me!” She must have lost her bearings completely if her voice is raised in the library. “Promise me you won’t do anything like this again. No more blood magic, no more dungeons. No more being the Chosen One. Just—please. Promise.” The last word comes out a sob.
“Well, here we are,” Harry says when they get to the door. He gives Draco his bag and steps back, looking at the ground. “Thanks again for what you did today. I know it may just seem like it was the right thing to do, but I know some people would’ve frozen up, or made a different choice, or… Well, you get the point. It was brave and admirable.”
Leon returns her smile and sits next to Harry. In some ways it’s too close; anybody with eyes and the ability to add two and two might ascertain the nature of their relationship. It’s also not close enough. Maybe Harry’s still caught on the idea of Leon sitting in his lap.
“Mister Zabini, out, now!” McGonagall shouts over the student’s screams. Blaise nods and makes a swift exit, leaving Draco stunned in bed, every nerve buzzing.
“Right, sure. Oh look, there’s Hermione, there!” He points up into the stands. It seems she’s just arrived and found a seat. She notices and waves, smiling and letting out a whoop of excitement. “She’s been really excited about this for some reason.”
They’re each given a piece of parchment, names scrawled into columns labelled with the Hogwarts Houses (minus Slytherin). Harry scans it and notices that Gabrielle will be staying with the Gryffindors. A little further down in the same column, the only other familiar name also jumps out at him.
, haven’t they? Draco chews on his lip as his eyes bore into the back of Harry’s head, of that stupid, beautiful black hair. Part of him wants to march over to the Gryffindor table right now and lay everything on the line. It’s the part of him he typically ignores, the part he’s certain people like Harry typically
she’s a fifth year), all of whom had either been on the wrong side of the fight or not in it at all. Besides, there wouldn’t be much use for having even one Prefect with only six people total in the bloody House.
“Don’t be fresh,” she says, but she’s smiling. “Back in a jiff.” She hops off the desk and exits the room, leaving Draco with the dilemma simmering, thick and sickly green, in the cauldron that is his brain.
The words come so easily to Harry, Draco wonders if he’s questioned Draco’s intentions and his sanity all along.
Anyway, I'm hoping to be a bit more consistent with updates. I am officially a college graduate with no (official) job for the summer, and I would love to get around to updating this more because there's still a GOOD DEAL of it left to write and post! HEHE! King of biting off more than I can chew, CEO of making things more complicated than they need to be. As is evidenced by the amount of rambling I'm doing right now. OK I'm done please leave a comment I love comments <3 :,)))
Just leftover things from the war that he hasn’t dealt with yet, he supposes. With teaching, taking classes, and Quidditch tryouts coming up in the afternoon, his mind hasn’t been in one place for much time these days.
“Exactly!” says Hermione proudly. “Even though...I do think Ron is technically right, you could walk in anywhere right now and they’d hire you on the spot. But I also think there’s a lot of merit in earning it the old fashioned way. But really, after everything we did? How bad could one more year at Hogwarts really be?”
“My main point is that I want you to feel safe at Hogwarts. The past aside, my job here is to ensure you get a fair and full education, and if you’re constantly under fire from every stranger you pass in the corridors I imagine it might hinder you quite a bit. This position would force people to see you as an authority figure, but most importantly an authority figure over someone who isn’t them. Slytherin House is the smallest it’s been since its creation, and so making you Prefect isn’t technically giving you all that much in terms of power. I know that, you know that, everybody else would know that. It’s more about the message.”
Finally, he says, “What do you have to thank me for, anyway? I thought we agreed to leave the past where it belongs.”
He flips it over and sees his first name, written in unfamiliar handwriting. Given the recent familiar revelation, he’s not quite sure he can trust it. Artemis trills again, hopping closer.
is going to be another question, I think there are many level-headed members of the Wizengamot who will understand why Draco fled. He was scared. It’s human nature to turn away from fear. We cannot punish him for being human.”
McGonagall nods in the pause that follows and presses her lips into a line. “First of all, I want to make it very clear to you that if you
“Works for me.” Blaise starts to load up his plate with grilled vegetables and a few pieces of brisket as Draco begins.
Harry sticks out his hand, forcing his eyes to stay on Draco’s. “You. Er. Left this.” In his hand is Draco’s (Hermione’s) black hair tie. As his hair falls in front of his eyes, Draco realizes that he did in fact take it off in frustration and leave it in the classroom.
“You think I don’t notice things? Especially about you? Ever since that day after your first Defense class, things have been tense. And I just don’t get how things turned around so quickly, because it seemed like the two of you were getting on so well before that.”
“Oh,” Harry says, nodding. He gestures out the doors, suddenly self conscious. “I suppose I could give you a bit of a tour, then?”
So bed it is. He’s lucky enough that Blaise is willing to deliver his work to him. For most of his courses, working from bed is not an issue. However, for things like Herbology and especially Potions, it feels like he’s just losing time. The second day of his residency, he considers writing to Mari to see if she’ll visit him, but that feels like overkill. He can pay her a visit as soon as he’s well again, which should be before his next scheduled appointment anyway.
Luckily, his off-the-cuff reasoning is enough to convince everybody. Besides, he can see the ways eyelids begin to droop, how every so often somebody tries (and fails) to stifle a yawn. It’s true that they’re not in the most productive state of mind, at any rate.
Which leads me into my next point. I could be wrong, but I definitely feel like the quality of this chapter surpasses all of the ones prior. I really, REALLY meticulously wrote this one. I think in the past I've seen fanfic as just something fun that I enjoy, but I've recently come to understand just how useful it can be for real-life application (but it's definitely fun for me still don't worry!!). Which means I can experiment with things! I'm in the process of prepping to write my first ever novel and my goal is for the prose in it to be sort of flowery and very purple in the way it is in this chapter. Some people might say it's over-written...and maybe it is to a certain extent?
“I’m going to go third wheel with Ron and Hermione for a bit,” Leon says as he stands. “Will you come join us?”
Draco chuckles at himself, shaking his head. “No, it’s alright. You remember me?” He’s not sure why he asks it, as he’s fairly certain his reputation proceeds him nearly anywhere he could go these days.
looking into Healing? Because…Even if I did go and find them, I’m not sure I could even bring their memories back. So I’m doing research on memory charms. Usually they’re easily reversible, but I had to rewrite their entire lives, and the spell has been in effect for so long. And even besides that, I’ve seen other people whose lives are completely ruined when their memories are stolen. Do you remember Gilderoy Lockhart?”
He almost breaks his neck with how fast he turns it toward the door, his mother looking at him as if he’s dead. Which. Well.
Coming from anybody else, Harry might be insulted. But she has a point, after all. The library is not a place he makes a habit of spending his time, especially not these days. Over the course of the last few days, all of the letters he’s received from Leon have been whisked directly to a tucked away corner so he can read them and grin like mad without interruption. Today, though, someone had been in his usual spot, and he was impatient, so he settled for something more in the open.
Harry glares at Ron and Ginny. “Now you’ve gone and scared him off, really great stuff.” He looks after Leon’s retreating figure as Ginny makes some remark about the new kid not mattering, anyway, and huffs in frustration. He’s not usually one to intrude, but it feels to him like something serious might be going on with Leon.
“He said he had something to take care of,” Harry says, still craning his neck to see if he’s missing something. “I assumed it was family business by how serious he seemed.”
“You’re serious?” Harry says, and he makes a point to smooth over his tone; Leon hasn’t done anything wrong.
“I’m unsure of your track record, but it definitely wasn’t great on my end,” he says, voice still slightly strained.
One of the Ravenclaws rolls his eyes at the Slytherin intrusion. Draco thinks his name might be Michael. “The Grey Lady has gone on a bender of sorts. She’s been howling around all day, spouting nonsense about old magic and danger in the castle.”
He’ll write to her, at the very least. He’s suddenly been given an incredible gift: insurmountable free time. If she’s okay with it, he’ll gladly visit. The old Draco might not have bothered. But then again, the old Draco never would have agreed to see a mind healer in the first place, let alone a more classical therapist.
I’m glad to hear Hogwarts has been so welcoming to you! Even though things are sort of in limbo right now, I think everybody deserves to be in a place that feels like home, even if it isn’t home forever. And yes, I’m here. That makes it pretty great, doesn’t it?
Harry can feel his own adrenaline building as he watches the scrimmage before him, suddenly remembering how exhilarating it is to zip through the sky, potential danger all around. Though watching without commentary does make things a bit more complicated, as an experienced player he’s able to follow along well enough.
“If you can’t fly with one person in the stands, how am I supposed to trust that you will when they’re full?”
you this was a bad idea, Hermione,” Ron whispers to her. She takes a step toward Harry, cautiously laying a hand on his shoulder.
The moment shatters with the echo in Draco’s head of a laugh, the flash of skin crinkled beside green eyes playing one last time before the glowing beast dissipates and reality flows back into his lungs.
Hermione works quickly and confidently, snipping and humming and combing. Draco watches the door of the classroom, chuckling to himself.
“I think you’re right,” Draco says, distracted as he searches for the familiar landmarks. Left at the birdcage full of smoke that never dissipates; right at the portrait of a Grindylow riding a manatee; another right at the globe that depicts Jupiter instead of Earth; finally, a left at the pile of stuffed toys that ooze blood from felt fangs.
They both look on as Ron guides Leon through the displays, educating him on the best candies and the best deals to get them. Leon listens intently, laughs every so often, and it makes Harry’s heart soar to see these worlds colliding in such an untroubled way. No drama, no tension. Just laughter and autumn air and the aroma of candy being made.
Ginny’s teeth press down on her bottom lip and she sits back, sinking into the couch, probably hoping she can just sink away from the conversation.
Leon wraps his arms around Harry’s shoulders and stands on his tiptoes so they’re eye to eye. “Are you kidding? This was the best reaction I could have hoped for.” Then he kisses Harry again. It lacks the depth and the passion of the others, but it still sends a fervent wave through Harry’s body. He can tell how much Leon
“This might sound a bit weird, but would you mind taking a walk with me?” Draco asks, standing up a little straighter.
Draco starts when he realizes everybody is standing and pushing desks to the walls. He joins in and stuffs himself into a back corner.
“I’ll try to keep this short, because time is of the essence,” Dumbledore says; his smile has dissipated. “Draco is fine.”
A small panic rises in Harry's chest when he notices Leon’s shallow breathing, but he tries to be attentive and let Leon keep going. He touches the shorter boy’s elbow gently, just to let him know he’s listening.
“You’re…you’re welcome? Are you not furious? I thought there would be a lot more swearing, maybe even an attempt or two to curse my trousers off…”
After a beat, some of the tension in the room releases. Molly’s shoulders relax, her face softens. “You really care about him.”
“I killed him, Harry. It all happened so fast, but suddenly he was on the ground and so was Marcus, and then I was completely paralyzed and all I could hear was Ariana screaming as that
“Certainly not,” McGonagall agrees. “But this proposes other problems. Any Hogwarts student who may have been on the wrong side of the war—for whatever reason, that’s not the point—was given a sort of pass from the Minister. It was already such a task to round up and try all of the adults involved, so Kingsley decided to consider any young people absolved of their crimes. He instructed me to keep a special eye on them, but in any case, they wouldn’t be in any official legal trouble with the Ministry. Of course, Draco was one such student.”
