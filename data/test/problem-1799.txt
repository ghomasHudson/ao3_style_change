"What-"
"You know I can't take you up on that." Draco says, and Harry smiles bitterly.
Draco muses. Of course, he didn't know it at the time (and neither did Draco), but Draco thinks it should have affected him more. Hell, it should have affected
Harry sobs. This isn't like how Draco hits him with a
"Draco? I wasn't aware you referred to Mr. Malfoy by the first name." Harry blushes to the roots of his hair. Snape takes the hint, luckily (when has he ever done that before?) and moves onto Draco. Harry rushes over, his leg weak under him and dragging along.
"I know. It wouldn't be you if you said those things."
He feels a floating sensation, and then nothing but white.
more. It's not like he ever meant to do this- he just kept doing it in anger, losing his temper.
after a few minutes. A little sob escapes him.
He thinks tiredly, as a hand fists into his hair, and he tastes salty precome.
"I hate you, Potter."
And Harry whips out his wand without thinking.
"I'm sorry." He whispers into Draco's ears, gently taking his cheek into his hand, "I love you." He says it so no one can hear it.
Harry tastes like justice, too. His blood in Draco's mouth, his whimpers swallowed by Draco's lips. The sweetest little cries forced back into his lungs. It feels nice. But not like sex should, it feels good in that he can push down this boy's life, his world, and make
"Avada Kedavra."
"-should be
"Yeah? You agree?" Harry nods, "Then why would I want to give you away? You should be mine to kill, right?" Draco knows he's done something wrong when Harry jumps back, gaze bright and aware now.
"Does it do something to you?"
I didn't know- I was so scared- don't let him die!"
"This is a dark curse, Mr. Potter." Snape says, and Harry sobs.
"No, no- wait, please, I didn't know what it did- please believe me- please-"
"Um-"
"Listen, sweetheart- why don't you just lie down, alright? I won't hurt you, you're okay-"
"Are you mine, sweetheart?" He asks him, gently rubbing over his jaw, already having peppered it with bruises and lovebites and crescent moons of his nails. ("Sweetheart" is saved for sex and making out. Draco hates using it as a general rule, thinking that it encourages Harry's hopes for love from him.)
A sweet word would make him willing to kill, Draco thinks. It's a comforting thought, to have malformed this sweet hero into someone obsessed. it feels like justice.
right?" The words jolt Harry from the gentle haze that Draco can always induce in him (god, that feeling- Harry would bottle it if he could) disappears as he remembers the graveyard.
"Try." Draco said as he climbed onto the bed and moved to the other side. Harry laid down, rubbing at his face before pulling the covers up. He stared at the ceiling for a bit before turning over and curling up along the blond's side. "Don't think, just sleep." He told Harry as he reached up and took his glasses from him. He folded them before reaching over and placing them on the table next to Harry's wand. It didn't take him long to fall asleep with his head on Draco's chest, fists clutching his shirt in a weird reversal of how Draco slept at Andromeda's.
“Harry?” He heard Ron ask, shuffling into the room. Harry pretended to still be asleep, his head slightly bent into the pillow so it was easy to do.  When Ron didn’t receive a reply, he sighed and walked over to where Harry’s cot was. Harry felt the bed dip a bit as the other sat down next to his side.
"Think black hoodie ever stomped on red shoes's face?"
in public, so Rump released an enumerated list of prohibited spells and made them all Taboo. But what now? We can't just leave it at that."
Lorraine Apparated directly in front of Scorpius, holding aloft a soup tureen that had been charmed not to slosh. "Master Scorpius, a freshly made cassoulet for dinner. And a small side of plain beans for Miss Aster."
“Go ahead, go ahead,” Draco said in the tone of voice one might use when showing off an item one had made.
"It felt safe," Draco said, after a long moment. "It felt sure…certain. The world was knowable. If I scraped my knee, my mother would come, heal it, hug me. If I was sick, I would be cared for—cool hand on hot forehead. If I was upset, I would be listened to. If I was tired, I'd be lulled to sleep."
"Who made the first move?"
Harry raised his trainer.
She takes two long strides towards him. "Get. Out."
face. "We're fine, it's just—"
Harry pushed back up onto his forearms and looked at Draco, who mimicked his posture, but whose head faced the floor, grey-blond hair hanging down to obscure his face.
He blinks, stumbling a bit, and then he has an armful of Hermione and a mouthful of her hair.
"Master Draco should be home soon. He's working on a case." With a loud
"My hair, right?" he deadpans.
Scorpius sighed. "Yeah, it's awful. I wondered what you thought about the—"
"Welcome to our home," Draco said, stiffly sticking out his hand.
Harry stares at her closed door, feeling useless. Much like he felt during their time alone in the tent.
"I think we should talk about sex."
Draco listens intently, then sits down in the chair next to the sofa. He exhales, slumping to the side a bit. "I'm not sure where to start in responding to that."
There's a quiet minute in which I start to panic that we're about to revert to that despondent silence again. I'm not sure I can take it. I might do something outrageous to prevent it, like hop up and perform a soft shoe. Anything to avoid sitting in silence again.
A silence descended. All four of their children plus Nico stared back with open mouths.
Harry says nothing. Hermione has a look on her face like she is going to explain it all later.
"Is she asleep?"
Harry smiled tentatively. "We're good. We're better than good."
version of you particularly attractive, because you look...doughy. Like an underbaked infant.”
“I don’t know,” Malfoy said. “I know I don’t want to fight with you anymore.”
"Like, my eyes. My eyes should linger on you." This was awkward. Harry wondered if this was the most awkward he had ever felt, but he forced himself to look at Draco with what he hoped was an approximation of confidence.
Draco elbowed him in the ribs, and Harry burst out laughing.
the time. When they were small.”
He had a point, honestly. But long odds had never stopped Harry before. Draco needed to get it together. Harry walked up to Draco, grabbed him by the shoulders, and gave him a little shake. "Pull it together, Malfoy. It's just our kids. We used to wipe their arses."
"Poor Potty," Malfoy responded, but his tone seemed amused.
Harry sighed. "But he wasn't, like,
“What do you mean, Potter?”
Harry swallowed. “Should we go?”
The man touched his wand to his head and the Glamours disappeared, revealing Draco. "Sorry. Didn't want them to think I was being an interfering spouse. Like I'm casting the Imperio, metaphorically or otherwise. One can never be too careful. It's important that everyone thinks you're still your own man."
“Mi,” Harry said, watching Ron run in the other direction as the Bludger changed course, “we’ll be okay, right?”
But Hermione just smiled, and Ron said, “Have fun, mate.”
"Entitled?! You're acting like a huge prick!" Harry spits. "I'm trying to tell you that I'm having trouble dealing with this whole lack-of-family thing, and you're dismissing my feelings! Like the old days where you took every chance to give me crap for being an orphan."
"Fuck, if that's manipulation," Harry said, running a hand through his hair, "then…I'm not sure I've ever done anything in my life without being manipulated."
"Alright, good. Are you going to do it now, or do you want to come play Duck Hunt?"
Darkness.
Draco sighs, his eyes sad and determined. "Don't let me put you off your shooting, there, Potter. You're missing whole flocks."
"Mate," Ron said. "Just like, ask him out." He winced as the words came out of his mouth.
"He's fine, Aunt Hermione!" Lily said, grabbing Harry's hand and placing it in Draco's. "We're all fine!"
"I'm not trying to pick him up," Draco sneered. "Honestly. I just want this to go well. I'm not sure I'm happy with the house. Should we Conjure some leftist tchotchkes?"
Draco looks straight at him, his face revealing all his understanding and pain. "It happens." He aims at the telly and shoots a duck.
Draco sat next to Harry on the sofa, and if it wasn't Harry's imagination, he sat closer than he normally would. "We did. Almost half the people voted for us, after all. Our message is out there."
She smacked his arm, laughing, but then turned pensive. "Do you think I should've, you know, done
"I'm almost done," Harry says, grinning. "And don't fucking call me 'adorable'."
shouted the
“Huh?” Harry turned to her. He wasn’t used to Hermione complaining about assignments unless they were for Divination.
Harry frowned. "Did I seem defeated before?"
In her sleep, Aster sucked her thumb for a moment, then stilled again.
Draco held up a finger. "We hooked up in secret at a party at the Ministry a couple months ago."
"It was—fine," he responds. "They let him off."
"Yeah, sure. You do realise that I've known you long enough that you can't pretend to have always been suave. I remember when you made badges that said POTTER STINKS and climbed trees to try to intimidate me. Everything you do is graceful, my arse."
Harry doesn't even know. The past few months have been a blur of sadness, and his times with Ginny have been comforting for both of them, but he's not sure how smart the two of them have been. Sex with Ginny has been an escape, and if sex is an escape, it's easy to forget that it has consequences in the real world you're escaping. It's hard to remember that sex can have a downside, especially when the pleasure stands in stark contrast with all the hate and war and death of the past year. He shrugs. "I don't know. I think we did."
"Oh Merlin," Ron muttered. "Okay." He stood, pointing vaguely in the opposite direction. "I'm just going to—" He walked off.
your goal?" Lavender asked, licking a bit of frosting off her lip.
The guy looks around, like he's being pranked. "What's the catch, mate?"
"The walls have ears, lad," Wilhelm shouted from Harry's pocket.
He's panicking a bit. He knows Hermione's being a big person about this whole Draco thing, but it's one thing to be okay with it hypothetically and quite another to witness them snogging on the kitchen floor.
He enjoyed it, anyway, until Hermione referred to it as his “journalling.”
Harry nodded. He hated the humidity in here. “It’s worth it though, because—”
The next morning he sent Draco a letter saying he wasn’t feeling well and couldn’t go to the skatepark.
Draco laughed softly, as much as he could while breathing heavily and trying not to moan with every thrust of Harry's hips, but his amusement was cut off by Harry's hands grasping his arms, tugging him forward, by the contact of their lips and the change in angle of Harry inside him—not as deep, but the angle of Harry's penis dragging across his prostate. And, thankful that Harry had decided on silence for now, Draco moaned, bringing hands up to Harry's cheeks and holding his face as they kissed as if they could deepen it farther, if only they tried.
Harry put the mismatched shoes on his lap and thought with some amusement that Draco probably wasn't allowing dirty soles anywhere near his trousers.
any time, but Harry had a feeling this was not an accurate reflection of Draco's house's norms, so he always felt like he was doing something wrong if he turned it on). He kind of hated that his (extremely posh) bedroom was down the hall from his (extremely posh) bathroom, which meant he either needed to carry his clothes and change in the fogged bathroom, or walk around the hall in a towel, which was probably fine, because Draco was almost never there, but
"That's quite enough of that," Hermione said, laughing, and ran over to wrap Harry in a hug. "Sober friend to the rescue," she whispered in Harry's ear. "Didn't think you'd want to start dry-humping him in front of your kids."

Harry pulled out the milk and Levitated it to Draco. "Draco—"
Lee sat up straighter. "But when did you know you wanted to be in a relationship with him, that you were attracted to him on a personal level?"
"Oh, Potter," Draco joke-leers, "you can manhandle me any time you like."
Draco stared at him for a long moment. "Likewise. In movies where heroes save the world, it never involves this."
“I can’t even force myself to go outside and play Quidditch because I just want to sleep all day,” Harry said. He’d assumed she was suggesting that he, not Malfoy, was the one who could hypothetically overhaul the Ministry. Perhaps that was an unfair assumption.
Harry unleashed a dramatic groan. "Don't use the word 'chosen' with me!"
Judging from Potter's eyes, we realise at the same moment: Radcliff just awoke from the Stunner.
"I am in a unique position," Draco continued. "Unlike Penelope Clearwater, I don't strike right-leaning voters as a radical choice. I come from a pure-blood family, I have pure-blood training, my parents have always voted Blimp, and I have two decades of history as a reasonable but firm left-centrist. I was a Death Eater, for Merlin's sake. If you put
Draco sighed. “Well, I suppose we’re lucky that James outgrew that before he came to stay with us.”
Draco waved his wand and Vanished the biro cap from Harry's teeth.

?! You've known each other for four decades, how on earth could that happen
"Potter. Are you stalking me?"
Teddy whispered, "This is so weird."
A breath of relief. "Yeah, of course. After all these years, you must know NDAs as well as the back of your hand."
"I guess. I mean, yes, I know," Draco said, sighing. "Sorry. I don't know why I allowed myself to get upset. You'd think I'd be over it."
Harry raised Draco's shoe without thinking. "Posh keto junk food is still junk food." Laughter rang in Harry's ears.
Draco raised an eyebrow, smiling a bit. "It has."
This—this entire government—was such a disaster. Harry was only able to keep from freaking out through taking action. Lists. Lists were good. And how had he come to a place in his life where he liked lists? Lists were evidence that they were
“It is not. I’m fucking looking at it.”
"It's important to fancy each other," Harry said, continuing to talk as if he were an expert in this strange topic, "because it keeps you young. It's hard to feel old if you're all jelly knees and fluttery stomach about someone."
Harry reached behind Draco to Vanish flour from the counter, but when he tried to pull away, he was stuck. "What the…"

Harry sticks his fork in the carton and chews on a piece of cold lamb. "This is disgusting."
"Like an intergalactic Floo!" Harry enthuses, wrapping an arm around Draco's waist and wiggling his fingers into Draco's pocket.
Harry sighed. This coffee better be as good as people said it was.
"How dare you," Draco says, in full outrage, dropping on top of Harry but holding himself up on his arms, out of Harry's reach.
I lean my head on the wall. "Do you have a better idea?"
Harry shoves his hands into Sirius's jacket pockets and leans against the wall outside the Troc, looking up at the giant statue of Sonic the Hedgehog. Malfoy is late. Harry cannot believe this is his life. After weeks of seeing each other regularly, they've been asking each other questions about their coursework and have come to fairly friendly terms. So he's agreed to take Malfoy to SegaWorld, to introduce him to video games.
Harry laughed, tipping his head back. “Ron tries.”
"At me?! A gag order? About what?"
“But before we visit the penguins,” Draco said. “Give me the map.”
Harry looked at Draco. Was it really that easy to believe?
"Do you feel like an asshole for lying to them?" Harry asked once the kids had all disappeared through the Floo, leaving behind a loud silence and a truly astonishing number of dirty dishes.
Draco's expression slowly settles into smugness. "In that case, let's try out those condoms. I have no idea how they work. Are they electric?"
Malfoy pushed off his hands and stood up, brushing specks of grass and dirt from his robes with an effortless elegance.
sense," Harry said, but he was smiling. "And no, it's not a criticism. It's an observation."
Something in my throat clenches. "True. Here's one of my grievances: I signed up for this, admittedly under duress, but I did, and yet the Dark Lord is still threatening me with werewolf rape. Or werewolf biting. Sometimes it's hard to know what, exactly, he's threatening me with."
Draco huffed in outrage. "
“The Ministry hasn’t called anyone up on a dress code infraction in recent history,” he said. “So we test it. We flout their code, we see how much we can get away with before they issue a formal infraction. And we will make our stance known, so that they need to choose whether to suffer the bad publicity of censuring their war heroes for gender crimes, or if they will concede that the dress code is oppressive and write a new one.”
A blinding pain.
Harry laughed and walked to face an open wall. When his chest was almost touching, he raised his palms to the wall and began moving them up and down, counting to thirty. When he finished that, he dropped to a forearm plank, which he held for about ten seconds before Draco started jeering.
Hermione pinched her nose. "Harry. Honestly. I'm pretty sure he is merely one of these people who thinks their very specific coffee order, like 'double latte extra foam', is somehow a meaningful part of their identity, and the fact that a barista knows this part of them as their 'usual' gives them a thrill of belonging."
Harry's face splits into a wide grin. Draco is almost never this inarticulate. "Did you just say 'et cetera' while asking me to define the relationship?"
"Are all the different Harrys meant to say different things?" Draco frowned.
Malfoy raised a challenging eyebrow. “Imagine your best future.”
"Hah hah," Draco says, trying to roll his eyes even as he inspects the whisk. "It's
No idea what happened to it. I said I liked Quidditch, they bought me a Stradivarius. I said I liked pizza, they bought me caviar. I said I was in love with Tomas Kaverin, they tried to buy a marriage contract with the Parkinsons. If I complained, they told me I was ungrateful—because they had spent
Harry sniggered like a schoolboy, but there was also a flush (pleased or embarrassed?) on his cheeks. "I understand what you're saying. But what
Malfoy's eyes dropped to Harry's lips, then flew back to Harry's eyes like he shouldn't have allowed himself to look there.
The queue didn't extend out onto the pavement as it did during the weekday commute, but there was still a wait, and the place was filled with a more diverse crowd—parents keeping their children quiet with processed sugar, a group of cackling witches who must all have been over a hundred years old, a surly goblin drinking what looked to be a chai latte, a harried-looking wizard writing furiously with a peacock quill.
Harry springs off of Draco. "Hermione! Er, hello!"
Draco blinked, taken aback. His eyes fell to Harry's lips again, then snapped back to Harry's eyes. "Can—?"
"Okay, true. But you're happier any time we have the kids over for dinner. Any time we go flying. That time we went to the zoo. I see you happier like five times per week. On the average Tuesday!"
"You're lucky to have a grandmother who loves you so much," Harry says. "And me, I love you so much. Have I told you that? I love you, Tedmonster."
Harry, assuming the rogue arse-grabber was Ron, shouted, "Hey!" and spun around, ready to wrestle Ron into submission, only to see Draco standing there, hands covered with bisexual paint. "…Did you just?" Harry asked, cheeks hot. It hadn't been his first choice of how Draco would first grab his arse.
“Nope!” Draco said, popping the ‘p.’
"Yes but we'll be at Mum's tomorrow, so today is Christmas morning number one," Lily explained.
(See the end of the chapter for
A long silence filled the room until Malfoy said quietly, "Are you quite finished?"
"I don't know, Potter," Malfoy said slowly. "What do you think?"
"Is that a

"What is wetbuh?" Harry asks, setting the NES down next to the telly.
Harry squints at him. "That is the most random thing I've ever heard. How can that be true?"
"You've been poking that porridge for ten minutes."
Draco waved his hand. "The
relationship has to make sense to
"Wait.
“No! No. I didn’t mean that. I never—that’s not one of the mental health difficulties I’ve had to overcome. I just mean like, our relationship was about being excited to be alive, about grabbing that second chance with both hands. But after a while you stop treating each day like a miracle. It becomes just life again, you know? And when it did, it was like there wasn’t enough left between us.”
“Are you really so vain as all that?” Draco asked, his nose wrinkling in distaste. “You had finally convinced me that you didn’t have a big head—that all my schoolboy taunts had been misguided—and yet here you are, assuming that you are wank fodder?”
"You picked a constellation name," Draco said, surprised. "I didn't think—"
Harry stands, stepping forward. "Mi—"
Draco lived in a townhouse in Primrose Hill, right near a bunch of upscale Muggle shops and one or two magical places that went unseen by Muggle eyes. It was only a short walk to the park, which, when he moved in, would be a step up from Harry's current morning walk route.
That night, Harry, exhausted, crawled into bed next to Draco. "I love them all so much, but I cannot express how much they wear me out."
“I can imagine it, Potter, and it’s a fantastic image, even if I know I wouldn’t actually do it.”
Draco leaned forward, amused. "Are you asking me to teach you how to flirt subtly, Potter?"
had his coffee yet!
Draco’s laughter was so loud it startled a boy looking at the gorillas. “What did they do? And you didn’t know you were a wizard? How did your aunt and uncle cover for you?”
Draco pointed his wand at his shoes, Displacing them from feet and into the cupboard.
Harry attempted to get Draco to stop ballroom dancing, and they ended up in some kind of hybrid where their hands stayed in Draco's clamped position but their feet followed Harry's jig. "This is not working!" Harry shouted. "We look like we've been Tarantallegraed!"
“Alright,” Harry said. “It’s going to make us act barmy, isn’t it? Like, have you ever taken Felix Felicis?”
is this drink?"
cannot show their knees.”
Draco laughed. "Right."
His phone buzzed and he pulled it out of his pocket, thinking it would be something from Draco.
"Exactly." He smiled. "Thanks for coming."
"Who is more likely to throw their clothes on the floor?"
" Lorraine Disapparated.
Albus choked on his food as Scorpius gasped, "Dad!"
Draco's face falls into faux shock; he raises his hand to dramatically cover his mouth. "Muggles have a thing with beaters that can assist in matters of masturbation?"
Penelope looked at him, her shrewd brown eyes seeing right through him. “It’s possible that you’re already setting yourself up to back out at the last minute. Does it feel that way to you?”
Nico, eyes flitting between each person in the room, looked like he was about to have an aneurysm.
"Harry, if we kissed the way we did and you
Draco opened the door. "Hello. Come to celebrate our star-crossed love?" He didn't smile, but it looked like it was a near thing.
"Tomorrow we'll get the vow nullified?" Draco asked, needing to hear it again.
“Should we go out there?” Ron asked after a minute, nodding his head towards the door.
"But! If we pull out, the entire Statute of Secrecy will be threatened." Harry slumped back in his chair. "It's only international pressure that forces nations to comply."
Draco stepped into the room, and Harry turned to look, breaking into a smile.
This time, Harry burst out laughing—a loud honk of a laugh. "What age are we supposed to be in this scenario, then, fifteen?!"
"I haven't the foggiest. Hullo, Longbottom."
"Moreover, Potter," Malfoy continued, his face shimmering with amusement and elation at having the upper hand, "Did you not know that Azure Cup is a worker-owned co-op?"
“Hermione,” Harry said, “why—how do you have a beard?”
Lily slashed her wand with a determined expression and a pretzel nugget soared through the air towards her brother, but he dodged to the left at the last second and the nugget hit his nose.
Malfoy, cheeks pink, sets down his butterbeer. "Lead the way."
Aha, here’s the place where the magical identity established by Draco’s DNA matter is used to determine desire. And,
“Cicero!” Robards called, storming into the room and past them with his usual drama. “Where’s the—” He cut himself short, turned slowly on his heel, and stared. There was a long moment of silence. “What the fuck are you two wearing?!”

. Oh, you stubborn thing. You deserve this. You deserve it so much. Haven't I always said you did?
to ignore you. And then the next thing I knew, I was neck deep in Charms theory, bewitching badges. I could never just…let it be. And that was before the war and all that entailed."
"I have no fucking clue," Harry said.
He read the most recent thought he’d logged on the parchment. Under “Situation” he’d scrawled “reading the Prophet.” Under “Feeling” he’d written “despondence, apathy.” Under “Negative automatic thought,” he’d written “Kingsley is a sell-out and all politics is doomed.”
There was a long pause, then Lavender's hand flew up to her mouth. She looked like she hadn't heard anything this exciting in years.
For some reason, Harry does. He hated seeing Draco with sad eyes and too-pale-even-for-him skin, with shuddering agony on the Astronomy Tower, with horrified fear while being made to torture. Harry hated it, even then. Draco isn't supposed to be like that. He's supposed to be holding court about making Harry's life a living hell, or about escalators, as the case may be.
nervous. But he came around. I've never seen him as proud as he was the day you were born."
Draco walked up behind him and wrapped his arms around Harry's bare waist. He caught Harry's eye in the mirror. "It's very adorable that you're worried about that."
If Harry had been suspicious before, he was now certain that Malfoy was an axe murderer. Harry's eyes narrowed, and as soon as the waiter was gone, Harry burst, "A to-go cup! When you could have ceramic! Are you an impersonator under fucking Polyjuice?! Or, oh my god, you're really that concerned with me not seeing what you're ordering. Is Azure Cup an illegal potions front? They’re giving you illicit ingredients in the coffee? Or they’re the dealer and you’re the junkie, and this is you ordering your fix?"
Draco, fingers stretched around the stem of his wineglass, grabbed his wand and swished it.
She leaned her cheek into her hand. "It's Nico, I think."
a husband, but I got my appetite for cisheteronormative social institutions out of my system when I was young. I never thought I’d
A tingling jet of cold air blasted into Harry's skin and he found himself skidding backward, away from Draco, as if he'd been yanked away. He blinked, trying to get a sense of his surroundings, and saw Hermione standing with her wand out, giving him an inscrutable look.
“We should imagine how we could make this year better,” Malfoy said, looking out over the lake, where the Giant Squid had just broken the surface, casting ripples. “Imagine these Serotonin Potions and all this cognitive-behavioural therapy help us.”
Draco exhaled, then captured Harry's chin with his fingers and kissed him deeply. He needed a reminder that the story Harry had just told was not true. He needed to feel the flutter of something in his chest, the scratchiness of Harry's cheek under his fingers. Aster wrapped her little arms around the two of them as if they belonged together, as if they were obviously a matched set, her grandfathers, and he needed that, too.
Harry sighed, feeling wronged. Well. He had three kids of his own plus Teddy. He was going to have to go with Draco. He lifted the shoe up.
? How dare he? I could deliberately pull up a memory. I could use it to knock at the door of his consciousness. Which memory, though?
"Hey," she said, wagging a finger. "I'm twenty-nine in a few weeks. Surely that counts as 'almost thirty.'" Lily told anyone who would listen that she couldn't wait to be "a crone."
"But the disinclination to hire has…unequal effects."
Draco's pale eyebrows drew together. "Well, yes, I suppose. Are you alright? Have you heard from Hermione?"
"What?" Nico asked, looking between them.
Draco hummed in agreement against Harry’s hair. “We can keep it for weekends, maybe.”
!" Harry shouted. "If we adopted a Kneazle, it'd die of old age before we could stop the charade. Everywhere we go. In front of the entire nation. For twelve years."
The same second my father waves his wand to drop the wards, Radcliff turns and scarpers across the room.
Harry pulls his mouth off, and it sounds filthy. "What?"
Harry scowled, but he couldn't deny Draco's point. They told zero children or they told…eight. And that was assuming his kids wouldn't spill to their cousins. "We could probably tell Gin and Astoria, but…" He sighed. "Gin is actually the person I'd least want to tell about this. She'd be mad at me for giving up on finding The One, or something."
When Harry wakes a few days later, he wanders into the kitchen to find Hermione doing some kind of kick-boxing routine while the telly blares MTV. As he grabs a carton of milk, a new music video starts. A scowly man with stringy hair sits under a bare lightbulb.
“You—you didn’t find when I found
did that happen!?
Harry opened his mouth to reply, but Draco cut him off.
here and there. He followed a couple authors; he read anything Luna published, which covered a wide swath of genres, to be sure. "No! What are they like? So they had someone get a magic womb and then get pregnant? Did they have a vagina to begin with, or…"
"Nothing. Only, if you had to choose the best gun game for home video gaming, what would it be?"
The waiter arrived and placed a butterbeer in front of each of them. Draco smiled his thanks and turned a quelling look at Harry. "Before you say anything, yes, I know it's not keto and has a preposterous amount of sugar, but I refuse to let Rump turn me into an alcoholic and this seems like a more acceptable destructive impulse. I took the liberty of ordering one for you, too, because I figured you'd be all sad if I was drinking butterbeer and you didn't have one."
"Right," Malfoy says, and if Harry isn't wrong, he seems
She turns deadly still. "Get out of my room."
Harry began to laugh again, only stopping when he saw the goblin staring at him, impassive, judging, from the doorway.
The dust continues to swirl in the sunlight as Harry raises his mug to his lips. "That's like, only part of it, I think."
?" Harry asked.
"Oh, just open your mouth already. I can do it on the first try."
"They're fine," Harry said, "but I don't want to do small talk, that's fucking boring. Tell me about sentient curses."
Draco raised one eyebrow. "Not personally," he said, drawing out the word. "But most people who are lucky enough to fall into bed with me report that the event is life-defining; now this momentous event has occurred, their life can finally begin. So it makes good sense you'd be feeling that way."
"Oh. Yes, Lorraine, thanks."
"But the kid wants their parent to think they're asleep, right? So they stuff some pillows under their duvet and put a wig on a ball or something, for a head, and then they hop out the window. When the parent first peeks in, they don't realise their kid is gone."
He wondered briefly if that was an offensive question to ask a wooden woodcutter, but Wilhelm didn't blink. "Ah, I
"He died as he lived," Potter proclaims, and maybe I was wrong about him not engaging in histrionics. "Surrounded by enemies!"
"No, I don't," Draco confirmed, barely feeling the tug of the Veritaserum—because he would've answered truthfully without it.
Harry's heart was racing. He took a deep breath—however much anxiety he had about this whole fake marriage thing they were doing, he needed to push through. He'd have to look to see if he still had any of his low-dose Calming Draught upstairs.
"Who's the Best Man?" Lily, ever the shit-stirrer, asked.
, he'd said to call him when they'd met after work yesterday—holding a box that read "
Within a few seconds, two butterflies landed on Harry’s nose. “Hey!
I scan the room, and my eyes catch on the rat, licking up water from a drip on the wall. The rat. Potter wants to Transfigure a rat to look like one of us. "Potter. You want to Transfigure a rat into a human shape."
him or pine for him or anything romance-novelly like that. But I thought about it—that I used to fancy him. In that awkward
To James's disappointment, that got everyone talking about politics. Scorpius was upset about some rumours he'd heard about Rump and policies on foreign spells. And Lily, who had clearly not yet processed Rump's election, launched into a rant about her disbelief about it all that each of them must have heard at least twenty times by now.
Harry’s fanciful imagining is closer to reality than Draco would like to admit. Allergy Elixir had been a constant in his childhood, and he resents Harry’s implications about allergy-sufferers.
They don’t make it to Hogsmeade.
To be fair to himself, Harry thought, Draco hadn't mentioned it either. And neither of them had tried to initiate a repeat performance, either. Although Harry had thought about it. It had been so good, so easy. Of course he wanted to do it again. He just wasn't sure what
"It's just
I shrug, acquiescing. Anything to avoid the soft shoe.
"We have
Harry stands, wobbles (still drunk, he notes), his sticky hand held aloft, kicking at the clothes littering the floor in the hope of uncovering one of their wands. "We are definitely alive."
Harry pressed his lips together to quell a grin. "It's okay, Jorgen, it's—"
“Which part? Brewing this potion? Coming back to Hogwarts?”
Draco winced. "I have no self control, Harry! Do you honestly think I could say no to you, in bed?!"
Harry sighed. Could he really marry someone who used full stops and semi-colons in casual texts?
Draco did. He really did.
Persephone Diggle, Head Auror, likely next Head of the DMLE, opened the door and cocked a hand on her hip. "Intentionally antagonising the Minister for Magic, Potter? I thought you'd left that sort of behaviour back in the '90s."
"Spit it out, Potter."
Well, at least he's had lots of practice walking into impossible situations. He takes a deep breath and chooses the seat directly behind Malfoy's annoying blond head.
“Dad!”
Malfoy laughs, and it's laced with a touch of nerves. "Good one, Potter."
"You can say that again."
"Say hi to Mum for me."
What he was saying made sense.
Harry turned around, huffing a noise that was somewhere between a groan and a laugh, wondering if Draco really had diazepam. "Do I look alright?"
And then Harry was distracted by Albus's arm around his shoulders. Time to put on his dad hat, time to listen to Albus talking about one of his students named Laurence and how annoyed Albus was by Laurence's dad's lack of enthusiasm about his son's progress.
Three years ago, Ron would’ve said
Draco has the sudden, horrifying image of Pomfrey handing him a gown and Scourgifying her hands, ready to administer the cure. He jumps up from the examination table. He looks at Harry and cocks his head to indicate a hasty imminent departure. “Well, thank you very much for that information, then, Madam Pomfrey.”
The Draco thing is easy during the day, when they're together. It all slots together so easily, leaving Harry wondering why it'd always seemed so awkward with Cho and sometimes with Ginny. But at night, when his subconscious takes the reins, Harry can only brace himself and wonder whether it wouldn't be easier not to care about anyone.
"Don't worry, Dad," Lily said seriously. "Aunt Hermione yelled at George for his first version. This one only activates if both parties, or well really I suppose it could be used with a triad, so if
Harry nodded. "When do they open? Can we make them sign an NDA?"
idea.
it's true! The last time you had a date you were in a bad mood for
He walked through the open door, wand raised, followed by a parade of objects, including a variety of nappies, clothes, and something that might be a swing. Lorraine, carrying a teetering pile of bottles, brought up the rear.
"I'm taking care of you, you prat," Draco said.
“Well then you should probably think about where you’re going to go—”
Hermione's giving him a strange look, but he runs down the stairs of the building, only stopping when he's outside. He leans against the building.
There was something about seeing your name on a wanted poster like that—you didn't forget it.
Draco rolled his eyes and led Harry into the house. "I keep refreshing all my social media."
I sigh, and it comes out sounding performative, over the top, even though I feel that sigh deep in my soul. "I didn't mean it like that. I'm here for the same reason, you realise. Only in my case, you're the house-elf and I'm the hero."
And it hadn't been one moment, had it? There wasn't a moment when a switch toggled and Harry felt differently about Draco.
A to-go cup soared through the air on little cardboard wings and bobbed in front of Harry's chest. He grasped it, but felt stuck to the spot, still staring at Malfoy, who was in the process of paying one Galleon six Sickles.
As Draco's hand trailed down his torso, Harry's mind whirred through so many moments—many of them long, long before Harry ever had any thought of Draco as someone he'd want touching him this way. The look on his face, a few times, in the war. He and Draco, over fifteen years ago, at West Wittering beach with teenaged Albus and Scorpius, who were at the time "only friends." Working with him and Hermione and Penny on LabMag elections and policy, pulling all-nighters on the campaign trail. Years ago—probably ten years now—watching Draco argue in front of the Wizengamot that human supremacy in Magical Law was a violation of the rights of non-human beings and that any law or policy should be written by a body with representation of all beings affected by it. Draco, convinced the two of them could stop some of the evil in the world, Draco, handing him an ice cream sundae. Draco, speechless in St Mungo's.
She glared at him. “I have a guess and it rhymes with Hotter.” She sighed. “My mum was talking about him actually this morning.”
Andromeda nodded. “Yes, well, my sister can be a bit unthinking when it comes to the bigger picture.”
There was a collective cheer before Dean and Seamus started. “I’m not sure when exactly it was but I think it might have been around the time Aberfoth arrived and we stopped the dementors from entering the school. We all ran back inside and scattered. I started up the staircase to help you.” Seamus said, motioning to Harry, who nodded. “We argued a bit, yelling at each other because we were scared and didn’t know what to do. I turned to go up the stairs and he grabbed my arm.”
“Not particularly.” Draco muttered, pushing his food around. “You don’t have to if you-“ Harry started but was cut off the other. “Cut the bullshit, Potter.” He snapped before pausing. “My father drinks bourbon.”
The silver liquid of the memory slowly poured from the bottle into the basin, swirling around innocently before a image made itself known. The liquid sucked him in, slowly becoming less fuzzy like as if he was tuning an antenna on an old telly.
Harry frowned at him before leaning down. He grabbed hold of Draco's chin, holding it tightly as he kissed the blond's lips lightly. Ron squawked like a dying bird as Pansy gasped from the doorway. Draco wanted to pull back, feeling the frown forming on his lips before his body moved for him, kissing him back, eyes screwed up in confusion. Harry didn't pull back until he heard the sound of floo and Ron had left.
Draco smiled softly, hugging his shirt and him close, falling asleep to rhythmic beating of the other’s heart.
” He hissed before taking a breath, in which Teddy started to fuss again. He shifted the baby before continuing. “What more could you want for? I just cannot guess, you constantly complain to me; you should feel blessed. There are children in Africa starving to death and you don’t hear them
“Two weeks, maybe. She didn’t really give me a definite time.” He sighed, smiling at her softly. “Thank you.” He whispered softly. “I didn’t know who else to turn to.”
Harry shook his head, not sure of what he wanted to say, he just felt like his chest was closing up every time the blond moved to the door. He didn't even know what was going on, much less how to explain it to him. He felt his throat tightening, and he felt the panic come back. "I was..."
Hermione pushed the sleeves of her shirt before reaching into her bag. Pansy caught a glimpse of  the scar on her arm, barely making out the word ‘
Ginny pulled back, biting her lip. "I'm sorry. We just want you happy Harry."
“I don’t want to hear it Ronald.” Ginny said with a frown. “Frankly, I don’t want to hear it either.” Harry muttered, making Ron blinked. “When did you get here?”
“Sorry about that, but go on about what you were saying earlier.” He told her.
“Of course you can. Let’s go shopping. I‘ve actually been to a few Muggle shops with my… Friend-“
Dean rolled his eyes before Luna turned to Hermione and the conversation moved onto the Quibbler and how it had been doing. The three new guests ended up sitting in the floor of the compartment and was joined by Neville, Ginny and Pansy not long after. Draco had actually drifted off to sleep after a bit and Harry gently woke him right before they got to Hogsmeade to change. Everyone had left to give them some privacy and Harry had closed the blind.
“Malfoy’s I think with Pansy.” She said, moving as Harry all but pushed her up the stairs.
??” She hissed, more at Hermione than Pansy at this point. “I mean I know Harry is a wanker and forgets sometimes and my brother has the attention span of a goldfish, but at least
In this chapter there is a bit of reference to self harm and the act of suicide/ contemplating suicide.
“Potter is heading towards a nervy b and a long extended hols at St. Mungo’s, Draco won’t talk to me and I have a feeling if I left him alone he would be the same as Potter. We can’t ever know what they are going through, so who better to help them get through whatever it is that they can’t get over than each other.” She turned her attention to Draco.
Harry turned and looked at Chris. “Hi.” He moved over to him.
She looked away. “They added more time at the Probation hearing today. They feel that your father hasn’t been reformed these last few months. The visit to my cousin reflected negatively on us and they thought a little more time might help.” She explained.
She looked up at him. “Knew what?” She asked, raising an eyebrow.

Now, though. He'd known Persephone was too willing to go along with whatever Rump demanded. Too willing to follow the rules. She didn't realise that it was less about following the rules and more about making the right ones.
His voice sounded amazing to Harry, who stood there just listening to him. It was soothing and soft, but had a strong bite to it that zapped his anxiety away almost immediately.
"Be a Professor. You are good at it." Draco said, shrugging off the comment before walking out the door.
Hermione cleared her throat before continuing, “It was something that Malfoy said the other day. He said that after everything that happened, you would want peace.”
“Tell me about it.” Draco muttered under his breath, looking away but Andromeda caught it and smiled to herself.
“Not now Pansy.” He hissed, running his arm slowly under the water. The lack of the sound of heels made him freeze as the person walked over to him. “Sorry not Parkinson.” Harry said, placing the shirt on the counter beside the sink, standing back.
Draco nodded, taking a long drag on the cigarette before blowing the smoke out the window. “Andy told me, this morning.” He said softly, his hands shaking a bit.  It had been the first time he had seen his father since their trial. The first time his father had seen him. It could have been a lot worse and for once he was glad his father was drunk. His father was a lazy terrible drunk, it was like alcohol turned him into a slug. He didn’t do anything and he barely spoke. It was better than having him sober most of the time.
Draco woke to the smell of coffee. He slowly sat up, looking around the room. He didn’t remember how or when he went to bed but that was a common thing for the past few days. He got up, smiling down at the tshirt before padding his way down to the kitchen. He passed Teddy in his swing, watching something that he probably shouldn’t be on the Telly. He walked into the kitchen to find Harry making breakfast as he watched the show and kept an eye on Teddy.
He grinned. “I really should do it more often. It’s such an improvement.” He replied making her burst out laughing, as Harry sunk down in his chair. “I have a feeling toast and eggs weren’t worth it.” He muttered.
"Look, yeah, I do like him." Harry confessed, flopping down onto the seat behind him with a sigh.
"Of course not, he's not gay." Harry breathed out, clutching the chair with his other hand.
Draco leaned over, running his fingertips over the tattoo gently. Harry winced. Draco chuckled. "Of all the things that's happened, Harry Potter can't even take a needle."
She shook her head. “Not that I know of. His birthday is in, I think a day or so,  so he’s spending some time with friends. He invited me and Teddy, but I don’t know about going.” She chuckled.
He knew he wanted to get rid of the wall the portrait was on and the wall the tapestry was glued to. He walked from room to room with a muggle journal and pencil, writing down notes, measurements and drawings. After a while he went back downstairs, thinking of how ridiculous he must have looked. Savior of the Wizarding world, deconstructing his house like a simple muggle. True, he could have this all done with just a few flicks of his wand. This way though, seemed more poetic. The Most Noble and Ancient House of Black being torn down the muggle way. Seem more cathartic.
“My mother gets tension headaches.” He muttered, slowly pulling his hands away. “Get some sleep.”  He told him, moving back to turn off the light. Harry laid down, getting settled again before Draco laid down on his side away from him. Harry stared at the ceiling for a while before reaching out and pulling the other close. Draco gave a hasty protest but didn’t move from him. He glared at the other before settling down comfortably next to his side.
Draco hurried over, looking Harry over before placing his hands on either side of his face. "Hey…" He whispered softly, getting Harry to focus on him. "You will be just fine…" He told him, rubbing soothing circles with his thumbs. Harry stared at him before letting out a shaky breath and wrapped his arms around him tightly. Draco chuckled, running his fingers through Harry's hair gently as he held him back. The blond turned to Hermione and Ginny with a soft smile.
“Teddy, please! I am coming back!” Andromeda sang from somewhere else in the house as the small infant cried from his bassinette swing. Harry smiled and walked over to the baby, setting his bag down. He leaned down cooing at him, making the baby giggle and the bit of hair he had changed to bright blue. He picked him up, blanket and all, and held him close to his chest. He hummed, rocking the baby back and forth getting him to stop his fussing.
should remember that. We all have issues from the war. Draco and Harry aren’t the only ones.” She sighed, before realizing that she was actually touching Pansy’s cleavage and let go real quickly. “Sorry..” She said, biting her lip.
Kings Cross had not changed in the few months since Harry last saw it. It wasn't even crowded or bad, that was until they got to the Platform. It was like everything stopped and reverted to slow motion. Everyone turned to look at the late comers before gawking at them. Harry in his usual muggle clothing, standing there with Pansy on one side in her designer shades and clothing. The shocker for most was Draco, who was on Harry's other side, in his piercings, two toned hair and grunge muggle clothing.
Harry turned his head to Ron who was looking at them in shock. "Oh, yes, Malfoy the victim! How rich!"
Pansy nodded, walking over to lock up behind him. “Thank you for coming over and staying with me.”
Harry looked away, not sure how to approach the subject again. “God why is this so hard?” He muttered to himself. He stood there for a long time just watching as Draco ate his soup, the blond tensing a bit when he moved his forearm a bit wrong.
“I’ll raise that bet to 10 galleons that he finally figures it out and faints.” Harry grinned, holding out his hand. George took it, shaking on the bet. “Missed you Harry.”
“What happened?” He asked her, clearing his throat. She walked over, sitting next to him on the bed. “I’m not sure… you were just gone. You weren’t there at all.” She told him. He nodded, reaching over and grabbing the clothing out of her arms. “These aren’t mine.”
He shook the feeling off and smiled. “Yeah..” He said, walking off to talk to Dean and Seamus.
“Yeah, sure,” Harry said, grabbing Draco’s wrist and tugging him toward the bedroom. “Perfect. How long do you think we can skive off work?”
Harry laughed and tipped his head back, the sun warming his skin.
Teddy's old enough to smile now, which does funny things to Harry's heart.
Harry laughed, but it was filled with anxiety. Draco's hand reached for him, landed on his shoulder, trying to provide comfort in any way he could. Harry said, "If not an intervention, then I think you all forgot to shout 'surprise'?"
"Er, yep. Thought I'd test Hermione's theory that my knees are more distracting than hers." Harry shrugged, feeling like an absolute idiot. Like an
"I don't want to be imagining it," Harry whispered, his leg still jiggling.
Harry laughs. "Nah, I'm not drinking tonight."
"Okay, listen," Harry said, after another awkward minute of them each sipping their cold tea. "I hear what you're saying, and I agree—to an extent. I agree that this started off in the wrong way. And I also thought we could just do it like it was part of our jobs. I was wrong about that too. I think we should start by telling each other how we feel."
Draco scooped her up. "Hello, Aster! It's so nice to see you." He leaned forward to kiss her cheek, and she grabbed both of his cheeks with her chubby, wet fists and pulled his nose towards her mouth. When it touched, she kept her lips open and slobbered all over him.
Draco ignored this heroic claim. "Who has the power to change the Hogwarts curriculum—is it McGonagall?"
The looks on all of their faces were serious. Except Nico—he looked nervous.
Draco whispers, "I wouldn't. Are you okay?"
"Harry," Draco called, and Harry turned to see Draco leaning against the archway into the vestibule. He was half-asleep, pulling his black flowery dressing gown around himself. "Why is it so motherfucking cold in here?"
"Harry, do you have the letter?"
ballroom dance?" Draco asks, grabbing Harry's hand with his right and putting his left hand on Harry's lower back. "All they're doing is rocking back and forth." Draco tips their hands to the right and Harry finds himself swept into a pitiful ballroom dance, just like the video.
Scorpius stepped into the room. He looked a bit off; Draco frowned. He could cheer up his son with baby hugs. "Scorpius! Bad day? Give us a hug!"
Harry was getting fidgety; he picked at the corner of his fingernail, then stood, walking to a cabinet to pull out a tin of the good biscuits. When he had reclaimed his chair and eaten a biscuit, he said with gentleness, "So the reason you want to end this isn't that you're concerned about me doing something because of expectations; it's about
"Yeah," Harry says, walking out into the kitchen. Not that Hermione's never seen lads in pants before; it's just that he'd rather she didn't see him and Draco that way.
Harry nodded. "We can do it."
The coffee was, indeed, delicious. Harry wished it wasn't, because that would better fit his mood.
"You! You're all—" Draco started gesturing again. "You're scary as fuck when you're doing important things, and you don't even realise it. You have no idea how people in the DMLE look at you, with respect and fear and desire to impress you." He stopped, thinking, then poked his finger into Harry's chest. "They look at you like you're
Astoria sat in one of the chairs and pulled off her high heels. "A poor choice for the day this has turned out to be," she said, pointing her wand at the shoe and Transfiguring it into a flat.
Harry freezes, an icy chill falling over him like one of Mad-Eye's Disillusionments. He can't move. He can't breathe.
"Obviously that was what I meant!"
Draco was on his back, face scrunched up in silent laughter, hand wiping a tear from his eye. “His face. Oh, sweet Merlin, James’s face.” He heaved an inhale.
Hermione opened one brown eye, the other smushed shut resting against her arm. "That's sad."
"So what's the problem?" Harry asked, and Merlin, he was like a dog with a bone. "What changed?"
A moment later,
?" Malfoy said, elongating the words, and then bursting into laughter. "Potter, neither of us has ever been fucking
"We know," Hermione said, leaning forward, tone steady, "that your relationship is fake. That it's a political ploy." She, apparently, thought this was enough information, because she sat back and crossed her legs.
"Ugh, Dad!"
He still went to Quidditch games, of course, especially when James had still been playing, and football games, sometimes, with Dean and Seamus and Luna, who had unexpectedly become an enthusiastic follower of the sport. Luna was an ardent supporter of the Swindon Spitfires, whose women’s team had been around since the sixties; the Spits, Luna would tell anyone who would listen, had played without an associated men’s team until 2011. So Harry had watched a surprising amount of regional women’s football.
with him."
"It's strange," Draco said in a careful tone as they turned the corner, "seeing you with Ginny. It's hard to imagine why you got divorced. You act like a happy couple, even now."
"Aren't there other coffee shops you can go to?" Malfoy asked.
Lorraine took one look at James and Disapparated, returning a moment later with eggs, French toast, and hot chocolate.
“Foraging for mushrooms?” Harry played along.
"Of course they believed us," Draco replied. "We're very clever and convincing."
Malfoy’s face took on a confused shock and he laughed. “What, now?”
"Can you grab some bowls for the sweets?" Harry pointed to a corner of the counter that looked like a Honeyduke's volcano had exploded. It was, perhaps, a mistake to send James and Teddy to buy sweets for the gingerbread houses.
"You can't just kick me out!" Harry stands, and he's hot with anger. "That's not what families do!"
"He was in my fucking
"No," he snapped, cutting off the mouths opening to object. "You're all here because you care about one or both of us, but if you care about Harry you would notice that you are
“Ah well. That’s why I have a moral obligation never to tone it down, right?” Draco smiled. “Can’t let the squares win.”
I stand and walk the perimeter of our prison. It's just walls—maddening. Stone, stone, mortar. A rivulet of water. Stone. I'm not sure what I'm looking for, only that I'm hoping something reveals itself so I don't voice the barmy idea that's forming in my brain.
, it kept giving me women to rescue. So I can tell you that it wasn't looking too deeply into my mind."
We have magic, but it can't leave the bounds of his cellar. We have a pile of shit. We have a corpse.
Ginny laughs harder, hand coming up to her mouth, and she stands. "I'm—I'm sorry, Harry. I—" She's still laughing, with tears in her eyes that are clearly not mirthful. "I'll be okay. It's totally fine that you are hooking up with blokes after splitting with me. Totally fine. I'll be okay. You can just—you can go fuck Malfoy. Have at it. I certainly don't want him. You hereby have my permission to fuck any Death Eater who catches your fancy. I'm just going to—" She points vaguely at the house. "I'm sorry. I am not reacting properly to this. Maybe now we're even for you acting like a shithead when you found out about the abortion." She stops, thinks, bursts into a cackle again. "Actually no, definitely not even. Perhaps you're even more indebted to me now, in the cosmic balance. I'm just going to go. Inside. We can talk again soon. I'm sure it won't be at all awkward."
My jaw clenches, an angry wave pushing past the numb detachment in my chest. "I can't believe I just committed treason for no
“Are you insane?” Harry peered at them wearily. “They’re going to try to rope us into helping with…” he waved a hand, “whatever they’re doing.”
They walked in silence for a minute, turning onto the pitch and sitting in the ground-level Hufflepuff stands.
"No, they're fine," Harry said, then frowned. "I think. We can check later, when we're done talking."
Her eyes widened with excitement. She turned to Lavender. "We are going to sell
"It looks a bit like Slughorn," Potter says, and I can't retain composure. I end up laughing so hard I have tears in my eyes, which actually helps a bit, because it's better not to look too closely at Radcliff Slughorn at this point in the process.
A tingling annoyance creeped up Harry's spine. "No, you know what, Malfoy? No. I refuse to act like this with you anymore. This place is great. We're adults."
He'd never been successful, after Ginny, in finding someone who could act normally around him
"Wait until you see how I've organised the kitchen cupboard. I'm so glad you're here. I need some help setting up an area for owls. Where do you think makes sense? I think we should have a perch and a water bowl, and maybe some treats? What do you think? You're more practised as an owl owner. Also, do you want to get yourself a mobile, or do you want me to go with you? You need to get one."
"This is the shoe game," Albus announced. "Babe, fix the chairs?"
Harry almost wished it were real.
“Yeah, can you even grow a beard?” Ron asked.
