“Unlikely,” Draco intoned, eyebrow raised. A thought, however, came unbidden into his mind. He hesitated before saying it out loud. “We could go to the real one, though.”
It also felt good to dangle Adrian in front of Harry each time he came up to the school the following week, which was frequently. The students, of course, were delighted, and it was to Draco’s immense irritation that Fernsby, the Defence professor, asked him if he might convince Harry to pop in on one of his fifth-year lessons to talk about the Unforgivables. He didn’t need to ask to know this was something Harry would dread doing, which was perhaps why Draco assured Fernsby he would bring it up when he saw him next.
Harry moaned brokenly into Draco’s skin, and a moment later he had abandoned the rest of his restraint — he slammed his hips into Draco’s forcefully, burying his cock into Draco’s tight heat with rapid movements, pumping into him over and over and
now, is that it? You check in on him, make sure everyone’s treating him right or you’ll knock their teeth out in the corridors?"
“I wasn’t flirting with him!” Draco cried, choking on a gasp when Harry’s fingers found his prostate yet again, giving it a firm rub before resuming their slow fucking. He felt about ten seconds away from slipping into insanity, ready to tear his hair out if something didn’t give — and at the same time he was still clinging to an awareness of his surroundings, of the fact that the door wasn’t even locked and nor was it sound-proofed.
"Well," he said, "I'm glad you trust me to do that for you. Just tell me you're not gonna go off snogging some other bloke and I s'pose I can live without the label."
This is not by any means the first time this carpet has seen a lit joint. Hermione has fixed most of the damage but here and there are obvious reminders, which Harry actually quite likes. There is, he thinks, such a thing as too much cleanliness and perfection. If a burn mark on his carpet is a memory of a good time, he can’t see what’s so bad about it.
The sole occupant stood in front of one of the mirrors, shirtless and wearing what looked like a very expensive, silky green brassiere. Harry, turning immediately red at the sight of so much exposed pale skin and undeniably appealing curves, managed to shield his eyes with a hand and turn away just as Malfoy spun around and spotted him with a gasp.
Potter was chuckling, and there was a look on his face that could only be described as adoring. Draco scowled.
"Me too," Harry sighed. "We'll figure out something better than a bathroom, anyway. Nice as this one is."
slipped out and made a shimmery trail down one soft-looking, pale cheek. Without warning, he reached out with both arms and shoved Harry in the chest, managing to make him stumble backwards purely because he’d been taken by surprise.
Potter squeezes a little harder, whispers his name, and Draco's nails bite into Potter's skin as his orgasm crests that final peak and tips over, wracking his body with convulsions of exquisite, unimaginable pleasure. His cock twitches and spurts between them untouched, Potter burying himself in Draco's arse with harsh thrusts until Draco's a shivering mess beneath him. His hand stays on Draco's throat, clenching and unclenching rhythmically as Draco feels him start coming inside his body. His hips slow and finally come to a stop when it starts leaking out of Draco's fucked-out hole, and as soon as he takes his hand off Draco's throat and he's able to pull in a deep breath does he realise just how tight the grip had gotten right at the end.
Potter comes over and plops himself down in an armchair next to Draco's, as relaxed as can be, one boot-clad foot resting over the opposite knee.
Potter handed it over and let him look the Map over more thoroughly. He traced his finger through the Slytherin dungeons, weaved through the familiar corridors of his once-beloved school, across the Great Hall, and the kitchens, and Snape’s old dungeon office. Up to the seventh-floor corridor where a blank stretch of wall hid the Room of Hidden Things.
. I have no control over the way I feel about him, Pansy. Obviously. Anyway, if there wasn’t devastation at the end, it wouldn’t be love. It would just be ... infatuation.”
Generally Harry tried to keep his interactions with Malfoy short, but one day about a week into December he actually sat down next to him out in the courtyard due to a group of mixed Hufflepuffs and Gryffindors who'd been eyeing Malfoy in a way Harry didn't like at all.
He neglects to mention he'd have been up all night anyway. Mostly because she already knows. He hasn't slept properly in weeks and it shows more every day.
Draco’s kissing him then, drawing his lips apart and ravaging his mouth with his tongue. Eventually Harry lifts one of his aching arms and puts a hand on his cheek, thumb grazing smooth skin.
Draco looks at him but says nothing. He knows perfectly well what Harry means but he gets a venomous pleasure out of making him say it.
and imagines it more clearly than he’s done since it happened, pushing past the self-preservational instinct to repress, repress, repress, to never,
"That's a very good idea, Ron!" Hermione said encouragingly, eyes twinkling at Goyle. "Go on, Greg!"
“Potter!” he sobbed out when Harry squeezed in a third finger and only sped his pace up further. “I’m serious, if you don’t stop I’m gonna —”
He, Ron, and Draco were at a different table nearby. Hermione had gently asked if she and Goyle could have some space, as it would be easier to concentrate (and, though she didn't say it, Harry knew it was because she'd had a hard enough time convincing Goyle to let her help in the first place). They seemed to be making headway, though.
“Harry,” Draco said, bringing his other hand up as well, cupping Harry’s face. It was strange, to be the one doing the comforting for once. Particularly in this situation, where
begin to forget, however, was the intensity of the hatred he’d once felt, and it was not without a bout of nausea and anxiety that he recognised something unsettling: learning that there was another side to Malfoy he’d never seen before, one that he very much liked, did not negate the side he’d known about for seven years, and very much did
Either Malfoy was thoroughly enjoying himself or he’d picked up on the obvious fact of Harry’s sudden, blazing need, and either seemed an absurd explanation for the way he was putting all his energy into this fucking blowjob. He suddenly took Harry in deep, lips touching the edge of his fist, so the head was pressing all the way into the back of his throat as he swallowed around it. Harry tightened his fist in Malfoy’s hair and pushed further, sliding
"Are you ...?" Draco started and didn't finish, but Harry took his meaning. He thought of the hospital wing, after Draco had taken the Cruciatus Curse, asking him to stay.
“That’s — that’s why those vials broke.” He reached up with both hands, cupping Harry’s face and forcing their eyes to meet, his insides being battered with each brutal thrust, tipping him closer and closer to an unfathomable climax. “You saw him —”
from Kettleburn and a monumental amount of reading from Slughorn. Thursday afternoon, Hermione had scuttled away to the library to start on her essay as soon as they’d finished their last lesson of the day.
,” Hermione deadpanned, reminding him forcefully of their years at Hogwarts together. He might have blown off a Transfiguration essay for all the reproach that was soaked into her voice. “While I don’t condone this tantrum she’s thrown, I really do think you owe her an apology. That was incredibly insensitive.”
“This isn’t an apology,” Draco said forcefully, eyebrows coming together. There was no immediate reason to be feeling irritated, Potter hadn’t really done anything wrong, but the habit was so ingrained it was hard to fight. That, and this new stoic thing he was doing was really beginning to get under Draco’s skin. “It’s an explanation. I’m not sorry, Potter. And besides, if I want the message to get through that thick head into your pea-sized brain, I know that I need to say it in person. Otherwise you’ll show up under that damnable Cloak again every time I try to have a midnight soak.”
Still unable to find his voice, Weasley waited a moment before apparently deciding nothing was forthcoming and, with a shrug of his shoulders and an irritated look on his face, he turned to leave.
“Right,” says Draco, after sipping his tea and making certain he won’t give away his amusement, “well … yes, it’s about that.” And now his cheeks heat, because they’ve come to the point. The watches are in an inside pocket of his robes and they feel heavier suddenly. He takes them out and places them on the table between them. Granger’s eyebrows furrow and she reaches out to grab one and look at it.
Behind him, through the open greenhouse doors, he saw a troupe of Gryffindors marching down the lawns.
“Helping him out?” Theo scoffed. He sounded like he was straddling the line of insanity. “D’you think I’m an idiot, Potter? Tell me, then, what was that little act of yours back in the common room, eh? ‘Stay away from Draco’? Talk like that about
“Us, you mean,” Potter said softly. Draco nodded. His throat felt tight. Potter had set the bottle aside again, and now his hands were a steadying weight on Draco’s hips. “Is there an ‘
“It’s already half past two,” he said, though he sounded tentative, like he was checking Draco knew what time it was rather than implying it was too late.
That night he snuck into the Slytherin dormitory after Ron had fallen asleep and Harry fucked him on the bed, and once again Draco frantically pleaded with him to keep going even after he'd come, even while he was twitching with aftershocks and clearly overstimulated. The same thing happened afterwards where he seemed foggy and distant for a few minutes before returning to a slightly milder version of his normal self. Harry fell asleep there, and this time when he woke up the sun was shining brightly in through the window.
“Potter?” Draco said after a minute, when both of their breathing had slowed. Harry turned to him with impossibly bright eyes. “I really missed you.”
He kept moving sluggishly even when Draco had dropped down onto the desk, stomach muscles twitching feebly. The movements slowed gradually and finally stopped, buried halfway. His face and neck gleamed with sweat. Draco glanced at the door, cheeks heating when he thought about how anyone could have walked in during that. How anyone could
Draco doesn’t answer. He points his wand again, and then Harry’s clothes are gone. He can’t imagine a more vulnerable position to be in: tied up and naked. At one point in his life, the idea of Draco Malfoy seeing him this way would have been second only to Voldemort himself seeing him this way. Not anymore, of course.
. He can't lock Harry up in a room with him because he's scared he'll stray. He can't have every part of him, as much as he wants it. The whole
"Will you stay?" Malfoy burst out. Harry looked at him and he saw Malfoy's cheeks darken a little. "I mean ... sorry, no, that's —"
Harry starts grinding up into him and Draco eases into the movement, rocking his hips slowly, his cock pressed between them. He ruts himself against Harry's chest, sliding through his own pre-come and moaning softly at the feeling of muscle. There's no sound other than that of the rain tapping against the bedroom window and their panting breaths, and in Draco's head, the sound of his racing heart. Beneath his hand he can feel Harry's too, strong and steady and perennial.
“It wasn’t just you, Harry. As I said, it was him, too.” She shrugged. “I won’t pretend to understand it or anything, I certainly don’t know what’s going on inside either of your heads, especially not his. It’s just what I can speculate, now that you’ve told me what’s been happening. There’s always been a lot of passion between the two of you, and sometimes passion can make lines blurry.”
He pulled his legs in to make room and Pansy sat down immediately, an eyebrow raised as she took in his appearance.
Like at the Halloween Ball, a pair of arms encircled his waist from behind, hidden under what Draco knew to be Potter’s Invisibility Cloak.
It was painful even with the numbing potion. Brutally so. He could actually feel his bones shifting under the skin and it was as if someone had lit a fire inside his body, a sensation Penbroke told him later would likely have been the disappearance and regeneration of organs. It felt like hours, and at some point his brain pulled him into a half-conscious state that rendered him unable to remember most of it when it was over.
Harry hardly had time to think about how that would go, noticing suddenly Draco's dot outside the Gryffindor common room on the Map he had spread out on a table. He went to let him in and Draco joined them around the fireplace. Nobody paid them any mind.
for it. Potter smiles into the kiss and backs him up on the bed, crawling over him as Draco lets himself be pressed down onto the mattress. It's instantly overwhelming, he can hardly even catch his breath, and it's with no small amount of incredulity that he can feel himself growing wet.
“First of all,” Hermione said pointedly, once again shooting a nasty look at Ron, “even the best of friends fight now and then, something I would think
True to his word, he didn’t say anything even to Ron and Hermione. It didn’t bother him, mostly because his evenings spent shagging Malfoy breathless had brought him around to the conclusion that he
“I was thinking I’d ask you on a date, for starters.” He grinned widely when once again blatant shock registered on Malfoy’s face. “Maybe see if you wanted to do dinner tomorrow night after you’re done with work. Go from there, see what happens.”
A hearty congrats to those of you who guessed correctly, and a hearty congrats to myself for somehow keeping my mouth shut until the big reveal. I hope as many people as possible are pleased with the direction I've decided to go, and I hope even more you'll enjoy the last few chapters, which are going to be a series of vignettes following our boys through the pregnancy.
Only half his attention is on his potion the rest of the lesson, but it doesn’t matter either way: he could have created the Elixir of Life and Slughorn would still have been more interested in whatever sub-par version of their assignment Potter cooks up.
As an experiment, Draco chose a spot he and Potter had never used before. An unlikely spot — something that didn’t make sense, even. Somewhere Potter couldn’t just
“Indeed.” He sighed. “But not nearly as devastated as she’ll be if I get off the train at King’s Cross looking like
“I’m just … beginning to realise how wrong I’ve been about you all these years,” Malfoy said. Harry’s eyes widened. “Let me put this into perspective for you, Potter, from a Slytherin point of view. If you destroy the most powerful and dangerous thing in the world, what does that leave?”
going places you weren’t supposed to go,” Draco drawled, amused endlessly by Potter’s penchant for causing trouble. Something which had, until very recently, burned Draco’s nerves. “Solving mysteries. Finding ancient chambers buried underneath the school for literally a thousand years.”
“Why do you have to do that?” he demands. Smoke comes drifting out of his mouth and nose as he speaks and Harry smiles at the picture he makes.
Pansy got up. He slapped her hand away when she reached for him, but she only came at him again and grabbed it this time when he swatted at her, enfolding it in both of hers. He closed his eyes and hiccoughed and two more tears came.
"Draco," Harry said, gathering himself and standing from the sofa. "Look ... they already knew, all right? They caught me the other day coming back from your room. I’m sorry, I should’ve told you, I didn’t expect —"
“Alright, go home,” says Draco when he finally pulls away. “Twat. I’ll come see you tomorrow after I’ve talked to Kit.”
He lifted his head when he’d gotten some semblance of a normal breathing rhythm back and looked down at an oddly open-faced Malfoy, whose grey eyes were, for the first time in memory, not cold and calculating but bright with wonder.
to understand, and more than anything I want to be able to support you, I just …” She tapered off, the look on her face one of deepest disquiet. “I don’t see how you can forgive someone the things Malfoy’s done.”
“Stop moving,” Harry said, mild yet brooking no argument. Malfoy let his head fall against the back of the sofa, chest heaving, eyes shut, golden lashes brushing his effeminately high cheekbones. He looked like he was praying for patience. Watching him closely, Harry pulled his thumb out and replaced it with his middle finger, gliding it in easily through the wetness he’d put there. Malfoy keened but stayed still. “You’re doing so good,” Harry breathed, stuffing a second finger in beside the first and placing a wet kiss to the inside of Malfoy’s thigh.
"Weird," he said foggily, still taking mental inventory of his body. He sat up a little shakily, and there was suddenly a glass of cool water pressed into his hands. He held it to his hot cheek instead of taking a sip.
“Where are we?” Draco asked, looking around with his eyebrows drawn and soft snow falling in his hair. Flakes stuck to his golden lashes and left a beautiful, rosy stain on his pale cheeks. If Harry had ever experienced heartache just by
. All right. And what about the way you abandoned me the moment you found out I was dating Harry? I suppose you’re
There were two things on his mind that night as he sat drinking a lager amongst a rather large group of his friends, in a pub just down the street from Ron and Hermione's flat: Malfoy, and the eighth of weed trapped inside an airtight jar in his bedroom closet.
“Only when I’m serious about something,” Harry hummed, and for good measure slid his hands down to Malfoy’s arse and squeezed. He leaned forwards again and brushed their lips together, loving the way he could feel Malfoy shiver in his arms. “C’mon … say yes. I’d
“I’m going to finish my essay,” he said. Pansy rolled her eyes but she didn’t argue, and a minute later both she and Blaise had gone from the library in search of food. Out of habit, Draco turned towards Potter and caught his eye once more. This time, however, Potter nodded almost imperceptibly towards the bookshelves. A moment later, he was standing up, saying something to his friends, and then he’d disappeared into the history section. Draco sat still for a moment, rather stunned by how quickly it had all happened, but it didn’t take him long to pull himself together.
When he walked out onto the pitch at five past, Potter was on his broom, circling the field. Draco almost turned and booked it back to his room for the third or fourth time since he’d set out for this rendezvous. Even aside from everything else, that pulse of heat he’d felt before when Potter had kissed him … it had sufficiently freaked Draco out. He was miles away from being comfortable dealing with
"Kitty," Leo said around his thumb, pointing with his free hand to Crookshanks who was slinking by. As if he'd heard this Crookshanks came near and flicked his tail at Leo's foot, making him giggle, before running away.
Harry woke up when the sun was just starting to stain the sky pink. He stared at Draco for a few long minutes, remembering last night. He thought about waking him up and then decided against it; he'd let him sleep, and they could talk later. He had no idea if Draco would be upset he was gone when he woke up or if he'd be grateful for the space to think — his gut told him it was the latter.
From across the room Harry catches his eye suddenly and Draco sees the careless smile on his face falter. Like he’d forgotten Draco existed until just now. Like the reminder is an unwelcome one. He returns his attention to the girl and gestures to the outdoor area where even more people are gathered, sipping drinks and laughing and crisping their lungs with cigarettes. She takes his hand and follows him out there. There are a dozen calluses on Harry’s hands that he knows she must feel, and he wonders if later she’ll feel them elsewhere on her body as well.
Was it actually possible that all he wanted to do was help? It seemed absurd, but then, at least so far, Potter hadn't made fun of him once, nor had he seemed to gain any sort of pleasure out of Draco's predicament. He'd even looked mildly ashamed of himself for barging into the bathroom once he'd seemed to remember Draco had a lot more to hide these days than a nefarious plot. It was all so silly, because honestly, what
What he found inside the box was hardly surprising, and yet it still made him feel queasy to look at its contents: Dresses. Blouses. Nothing
“I was half convinced you wouldn’t show up again,” Potter said, looking far too pleased. His expression sobered, however, when he saw the lack of anything even partially resembling good humour on Draco’s face.
“Difficult to accept!” Ron shouted, looking for all the world like he was descending slowly into lunacy. “Harry, you’re … you’ve lost your mind! You
, stayed frozen. Potter licked his lips, appearing to choose his words carefully. “I know that there’s, like, a whole mountain range of shit between us that should make this impossible, and if not impossible, then at least
"Funny," said Ron, rather loudly and with a lot of anger in his voice, "you'd think you would after we saved your life."
Draco snorts, the haze of orgasm finally beginning to fade and with the relative clear-headedness comes the realisation that it's probably been close to forty-five minutes since he'd taken the Polyjuice, meaning he needs to get back to his dorm fast.
He and Harry walked in silence down to the entrance hall and out through the great oak front doors, the air between them heavy with everything unspoken. The snow was falling thick and slow, the flakes fat and puffy, and the grounds sparkled with the fresh coat. There was hardly any wind, and except for the sound of their feet crunching through the snow, the night was tranquil. They didn’t go far, stopping while they were still within ten feet of the warm yellow light cast by the Great Hall’s windows.
“Go to hell, Zabini,” Theo bit back. He flashed Blaise two fingers and headed back to his station with Tracey. While Theo had been gone, it seemed Tracey had managed to irreversibly damage their potion, because it was now belching out thick, noxious clouds of evil-looking orange smoke.
Maybe there is no god. Muggle or otherwise. Maybe spirituality is a sham, and there’s no such thing as a clean or a dirty soul. But when he comes, and when Potter comes inside him, he could swear he knows what god is and he feels absolved from the inside out.
“Draco,” Harry said, and the tone of his voice was suddenly sombre. He leaned in and pressed their lips together briefly. “I’d stay here every night if you said that’s what you wanted.”
. Like saying it is the most natural thing in the world, when just the simplified version is an obstacle for Draco. It reminds him again why they can't be together — Harry needs someone who can match his intensity, and although Draco very much wants to let himself drown in it, he knows it's far better to have a mediocre relationship than to have one with so many terrifying unknowns. His instinct tells him to get out of the water now before he swims too deep and regrets it.
Harry kissed him again, slowly, and as he did he pulled his hips back, slipping his cock out of Draco’s hole. Draco felt what was sure to be the rest of Harry’s come start dribbling out of him.
to. I just … I just wanted to help. I knew she would be able to do something more for you and I … you have to believe me, I was only doing what I thought would be best for you.”
It turned out to be easier than that, though. In a deserted fifth-floor corridor, he ran into Potter as he was presumably on his way down to the Great Hall. When he saw Draco, he stopped. For a moment, neither said a thing.
“Ugh. Get under your Cloak. It's probably Pansy, I'll get rid of her,” he said, sitting up in bed and rubbing tiredly at his eyes. Harry kissed him on the cheek before rolling out of bed, slipping on his boxers, and then covering himself with his Cloak. “Keep your bloody pants on,” Draco snapped at the door when another knock sounded.
And suddenly the words were coming out, repressed for so long that his voice broke halfway through: “I love you,” he said, and lifted onto his toes to kiss Harry with a desperate, anguished sort of urgency that was returned tenfold. His fingers dug into the sides of Harry’s face, and he felt Harry’s hands slide upwards from his waist. He broke away from Draco’s mouth and looked down, following the movement of his own hands as he unclasped Granger’s cloak and slid his hands inside, beneath Draco’s blouse, over his bare stomach. The freezing wind didn’t have a chance against the searing warmth of those hands.
still have a little bit of gold left, and I intend to use that to get you more attentive care from St Mungo’s.”
“Right. Well — that’s between you two. Are you — er — okay, then? That bloke didn’t actually hurt you, did he?”
“No,” said Draco firmly, lifting his head and meeting Harry’s eyes. “It isn’t your fault. I’m glad I know — I
you, I’m just … goodness, I really didn’t expect that! You’re sure it was … you know, a good idea? Only sleeping with someone can sort of … heighten emotions, and you and Malfoy are — erm —”
“I really appreciate you coming,” Draco says as he leads her to a small wrought iron fleur-de-lis table near some of the more pungent flower beds. He and his mother had taken tea out here times beyond number in his childhood, almost always without his father. “I know you’ve been up to your ears working on that new assignment you won’t tell us anything about.”
"That's okay," Harry said into his ear, speeding his fingers up yet again. "You can come. Touch yourself."
"Quit acting like a petulant child, Draco," Harry says. "You broke my fucking heart, you owe me this."
with me?” The way he said it caused a very small smile to quirk the corners of Harry’s lips. “And ...
He's working on an essay for Transfiguration when he overhears Pansy, Daphne, and Tracey start whispering about conquests. Things like this are how he knows everything's officially gone back to normal around here.
“There’s no one listening,” Potter says bluntly. His conviction tears a hole in Draco’s resolve. “You have to do it yourself.”
— clean answers to murky things. Like a cup of strong tea, it might leave you all warm and fuzzy and satisfied in the end, or it might just leave you with some dregs at the bottom of the mug that mean absolutely nothing, no matter how many different angles you use to try and analyse it.
The cigarette finds his lips again, gaze never moving. It sizzles loudly in the dark when he takes a deep drag.
He was born with already-thick dark hair and green eyes. He had Draco's pointy nose and high cheekbones.
It was just after seven when Harry walked in behind Granger. Draco stayed seated, but Weasley stood up from the bed.
“How often do you talk?” she went on, squeezing his hands once before pulling hers back. “You must meet up at night, when everyone else is asleep?”
After stopping to buy sugar quills for Hermione, Harry and Ron went into The Three Broomsticks and ordered not two Butterbeers, but two tumblers filled three-quarters of the way with Ogden’s Old Firewhisky. It wasn’t as though they hadn’t had a drink or two before — not with Seamus as a roommate — but it
confused by Potter's actions, not to mention his words, than he had been that day on the pitch, the first time Potter had actually seen Draco up close in this new, uncomfortable body. He hated to admit it,
than good — to be back on the same page as Ron. However wonderful Malfoy might make him feel sometimes, he knew he’d never have been able to enjoy it fully if it meant losing Ron in the process. It was relief like a great, gasping breath of fresh air. “What do you mean, he won’t talk about the past?”
"Never," Harry assured him. "I've been waiting a year to see you like this again. It's really ... it's quite insane, isn't it?" He sounded a little breathless. His hand was back on Draco's cheek, thumb rubbing over his cheekbone. "Merlin,
, but that wasn’t my intention, no. Seamus has loads of bottles stashed away in his trunk he’s saving for the next party in the common room, and I felt like unwinding a bit tonight. I reckon he won’t notice one missing.”
Draco eyed him for a moment, hands still resting on his belly. “Yes. Penbroke — my Healer — said it would be best to stay in this body for a few months so I can … that is, so I would be able to —”
They stopped walking, beside the lake now, and Harry let his eyes wander over its glassy surface. Something that tasted bitterly like guilt was at the back of his tongue.
And he was starting to think that was the case, because it had been four days since they’d spoken. He’d caught Malfoy’s eye a few times in the Great Hall, in the corridors, and in classes, but Malfoy never approached him, not even in private. And without that to hold his focus, everything had started to close in on him again.
He found Malfoy sitting in a window seat between two beds, setting his wand back down, and he looked devastating in the moonlight. His pale skin was almost translucent; his hair was as white as bone and seemed to be glowing faintly. Up and down the sensual curve of his arched back Harry could see the distinct knobs of his spine poking through his night shirt.
Harry flashes him a slightly uncertain smile but if he has any qualms, he doesn't voice them. When he's straightened himself out enough, he grabs his Quidditch robes from near the door and puts those on as well, glancing briefly at the open window and the downpour beyond it.
“Harry,” Draco murmured against his lips, squeezing his thighs around him, fingers scrabbling against Harry’s damp chest, slick with sweat. Behind them, the bed’s headboard had begun tapping the wall with every thrust forward. “Harry, I …” There was an urgent desperation behind his voice, like some deep part of him knew what he needed so badly to say but couldn’t quite force it out.
. Seized our vaults and the Manor, all our assets." Harry, of course, knew all of this, but he didn't interrupt. "Well we housed the Dark Lord ... highly punishable crime, you know. My mum'll have access to her individual vault when she gets out of Azkaban because she doesn't have the ..." He didn't raise his arm this time, and Harry didn't need him to. "But it won't sustain us for the rest of our lives. Her Black inheritance and the Malfoy vaults were where most of the money was. I've always been decent at Potions ... I s'pose I might try and get a job at an apothecary or something."
The very next day, however, Harry quite distinctly noticed someone glance at Malfoy, then at him, and then move on while they were all waiting outside the Charms classroom. Goyle seemed to have noticed this as well, and he stared at Harry for a second before returning his attention to the corridor at large, anticipating any attacks on Malfoy.
…” The bratty, demanding quality had almost entirely disappeared from his voice, leaving him sounding breathless and desperate and
"You'll be staying in Nymphadora's room," Andromeda told Narcissa, her voice very soft. She looked nothing at all like Bellatrix at the moment. "It's just upstairs, I'll show you. And you can take a nice hot shower too, how's that, Cissy?"
“Fancy running into you back here,” Potter said into his ear. Draco shivered. The hands on his waist disappeared and a moment later Potter had lifted the Cloak and pulled Draco underneath as well. Their ankles were surely showing, but hidden as they were behind the shelves, it seemed safe enough. “Hello,” he grinned brightly, and pulled Draco by the neck into a heart-stopping kiss that he melted into. "You smell wonderful."
Draco turned over and pulled the covers further up his body, burrowing his face into them and heaving a deep, world-weary sigh. As if things hadn’t been complicated enough before. Leave it to Potter to take an impossible situation and turn it completely on its head.
"I have to tell you something really important," Draco said, voice suddenly even lower. There was laughter in it, though, which told Harry it was likely to be something silly, which was definitely his favourite thing about drunk Draco so far. He was so ...
, not really. They weren’t seeing each other or anything. It was merely an open acknowledgment of the fact that something other than animosity — yet with the same amount of passion — existed between them. Malfoy had adamantly refused to discuss it beyond his admission of feelings for Harry, and yet this in itself was such a monumental step that Harry wasn’t bothered.
. There's really nothing he can do except pray Potter doesn't tell Daphne or anyone else for that matter.
"Maybe," said Harry, tearing his eyes away from Malfoy and Goyle and returning them to the game of Gobstones he and Ron were attempting to play in the grass. Ron had already gotten sprayed twice, sending Harry into gales of laughter. "What's she s'posed to do, though? Tell Goyle he's not allowed to hang around Malfoy anymore? Fat chance."
“Potter!” he said, lurching away from the desk and sounding both pleased and nervous, which Draco took to mean he was perfectly aware he'd been on the verge of overstepping a delicate boundary. “Just telling Draco how that Moly plant helped my brother yet again.”
Draco liked it this way. He liked having a piece of Potter all to himself. He liked having something that was just them and nobody else.
Draco’s stomach plummeted. The things coming out of Potter’s mouth were so surreal they might have been the stuff of dreams.
“Ginny and I spoke a while ago,” Harry said quietly, cutting through Ron’s tirade. “We’re not together anymore. We can talk more about that if you want, too. I should have told you. But the point is, I —”
the hell this is; I just know that when something feels right, I usually go for it. So — er — I’ll be here, you know, whenever you figure out whatever you need to figure out. And that doesn’t mean I’m not still around to talk to about other stuff,” he added quickly, making Draco roll his eyes, though not unkindly. “I never offered you my help in the first place because I wanted something out of it. I don’t want you to think that.”
Ron seemed like he wanted to say something else, but apparently decided not to, because he nodded again and then went to wait for Harry out in the corridor. Harry dashed up the stairs two at a time, snagged his regular cloak as well as a scarf and a pair of gloves, and then headed back down only to be impeded by Hermione at the foot of the stairs.
Ginny nodded, her head coming down to rest on his shoulder. One of her hands touched his chest and then curled in the material of his jumper. Her hair smelled different than it used to, but that felt somehow appropriate. Ginny wasn’t the fifteen-year-old he’d dated two years ago. Different though it might have been, it still reminded him of safety, and of home.
“What the fuck!” Malfoy exclaims, stumbling back a step, clearly disorientated. Harry lets out a breath of relief and sets the pot on the nearest workstation. “Jesus — Potter — what the
He doesn’t say it out loud, thinks that maybe he never will, but he knows privately, way deep down inside his own mind, that he’ll never get used to being loved the way that Harry loves him.
It was not a new thing for Goyle to act as some sort of bodyguard for Malfoy — this had been the case as long as Harry had known them, along with Crabbe, who was now of course dead — but he couldn't remember there ever having been a time when Goyle acted without instruction of some kind.
At dinner that night, Harry had finally managed to stop thinking about it long enough to gorge himself on roasted turkey in preparation for the all-night study session Hermione had told him and Ron in no uncertain terms she’d be forcing them to attend beginning promptly at nine o’clock. Two weeks into term and somehow their N.E.W.T.s year was already proving to be twice, nay,
Harry gave Weasley and then Granger a sour look; both of them gave it right back to him, which was, admittedly, amusing.
"Oh, Mr Potter, good, good," he said, wringing his pearlescent hands, "there's a bit of trouble, I was looking for a teacher. You'll do just fine, please, come with me, hurry."
He does know that the sculpture he’s looking at is called the crucifix. He knows that this man with his bleeding palms opened up around iron pegs is called Jesus, and that the Muggles (or a lot of them, at least) believe he died for their sins before returning to life.
“You think that’s all I am to him?!” he drowned out Potter’s weak protest, horrified to feel the sting of tears at the corners of his eyes. His hands were shaking. “Just an heir, only useful as a male, if I can keep the Malfoy name alive?! How pathetic do you think I am, exactly? What were you thinking when you stopped my father from receiving the Kiss? ‘Poor, naïve Draco, pining after a father who doesn’t even
Pansy actually laughs in what looks like disbelief. Draco scowls at her. "And you've come to this conclusion by ... what, watching him flirt with someone at a pub on Weasley's birthday?"
“You have no idea, Draco,” he said brokenly. “God, you have no idea. But I couldn’t … I don’t know how to … I don’t
The other, incredibly, was studying with Granger. Harry had proved completely useless when it came to focusing on homework for more than forty-five minutes at a time, but when he and Weasley fucked off to throw a Quaffle around or play chess in the Gryffindor common room, Draco learned that Granger was capable of studying for hours at a time, sometimes late into the night, until Madam Pince was shooing them out of the library.
“It’s not as though I’m leaving the castle,” Harry teased when he’d pulled back, delighting in the scowl that appeared on Malfoy’s pretty face.
“Oh look, it talks,” said Draco disdainfully, sneering up into the face of a boy who might have been quite fit had it not been for the rather unsettling look of disgust combined with something dangerously close to hunger in his eyes. Not like Potter, though — this was nothing like the warm passion he saw in Potter’s eyes when he was turned on, two seconds away from devouring Draco. This was horrible, and it made his gut twist with fear. Draco’s heart leapt into his throat, yet he kept his composure. “I understand it must be difficult for you, to see people
Draco stepped out from beneath the Cloak when they reached the entrance to the common room, and they had only just stepped inside when their path to his private quarters was impeded by the only person who seemed not to be at dinner.
, he didn’t bother dragging Harry to his bedroom – Draco pushed him up against the front door that had just closed behind his friends and hauled him into a kiss that he felt Harry grinning into.
“I love you,” he said candidly. The honesty of it, the raw truthfulness of the words, robbed Draco of air. Harry let out a breathless little laugh, eyes alive with surging emotion. “I’m sorry. I know you’re terrified of hearing it, but I do. And it’s not
"Only looking," said one of the boys. His back was to Harry, Ron, and Hermione, but Harry could tell he was staring past Goyle at Malfoy. Malfoy, looking very small compared to his current company, was mostly expressionless. But then Goyle started cracking his knuckles and moving forward and the boys continued on their way, looking in Harry's opinion like people who would have been glad to get at Malfoy had Goyle not been there, in view of Harry or not.
with Potter. He has no real way of making sure but he continues seeing her looking distinctly content, and he takes that to mean all is well. He hasn't stopped to analyse his decision to do this, and he doesn't ever plan to. There's not much to analyse anyway — he thinks Potter's fit, that's all, and this is quite a simple way of going about shagging him once without any complications.
"Mr Goyle!" shouted McGonagall, a hand on her hat as she strode towards them, eyes flashing dangerously. Slughorn lagged behind her, looking completely out of his depth. "Mr Langley! That will be enough!"
At some point — and Draco wasn’t sure how long it had been — Potter’s mouth started drifting away from Draco’s lips, latching instead onto the skin of his jaw and sucking a path down to the sensitive area behind his ear. His heart in his throat, Draco feebly pushed Potter away. Not with the violence he had last time, however, for he didn’t think he’d have had that sort of strength at the moment, embarrassing as it was to admit even internally. It was just enough leverage to get Potter’s hot mouth off his skin, giving Draco the space his needed to collect his thoughts. Yet even without the contact, it proved nearly impossible to think under Potter’s burning gaze.
"Absolutely," said Harry. He saw Draco start tearing up but he didn't look away. "I won't work for a Ministry allying itself with Dark shit like Dementors, and like I said, Kingsley agrees. Dumbledore was always fighting it."
A high keening noise started in his throat and turned into a helpless whimper when Harry tightened his hold and shoved a knee between Draco’s legs.
He left the ward carefully, trying not to make any noise when he cracked the door open, and at that very moment he heard Malfoy say something loudly enough to cover the sound and keep Pomfrey's focus while he slipped out.
“Well if it’s so unlikely, what’s the harm in trying?” Draco raised a challenging eyebrow. “We probably won’t get in anyway. Just show me where the entrance is.” He paused, then added, "
Harry looked back at him with a surge of irritation that died again immediately when he saw that Malfoy was grinning. He hadn't seen him do
It was back to the new normal the rest of the afternoon, the four of them sitting around the common room, Hermione helping Ron finish the Potions essay finally while Draco curled up in a chair with Macbeth (Hermione had been very excited about this) and Harry pulled out his Broomstick Maintenancing Kit. He glanced over at Draco often, and sometimes Draco was already looking at him. There was something dark in his gaze that made Harry feel distinctly hungry for him.
scars had survived the first transition. He decided he liked it. He'd never wanted to stay in the body of a woman, but he'd been through something extraordinary and it felt right, somehow, that there should be a lasting mark.
part of him, would have loved nothing more than to turn away the help. To yell at Potter later, because Granger was the last person Draco wanted privy to all this.
The whole thing was moot, though. Despite what had seemed to be an initial, hesitant interest on Malfoy’s part, it had turned right back around into the hatred and mistrust which had always existed between them. Perhaps for Malfoy that would never change. It bothered Harry, the amount of irritation and disappointment this stirred up within him, but because there was very little he could do about it short of chaining Malfoy’s brand-new body to a chair and forcing his audience, Harry was forced to catch himself every time he began ruminating and redirect his train of thought.
"He's not even two, Draco, just make sure he doesn't fall," Harry laughed. "You don't have to have a conversation."
Malfoy’s voice cut through the air like a hot knife, leaving a silence in its wake that was tangible, the admission ringing in the air like an echo. Within two seconds he was moving towards the door, but even as he brushed past Harry’s shoulder, Harry caught his arm and drew him back. Instead of letting himself start thinking about it and letting the moment pass him by, he let his instinct win out: he pulled Malfoy in and kissed him hard on the mouth. There were several seconds of no movement at all, and then there was a flurry of it. Both of their mouths opened on one another like divers coming up for air; there was no careful preamble, just tongues and teeth and the blissfully sweet taste of Malfoy's mouth, bruised lips and gasps for air as Malfoy’s hands first curled into Harry’s robes and then shoved him back hard. Lips throbbing, Harry looked at Malfoy with his heart going a hundred miles a minute, utterly unable to grasp what had just happened. Malfoy looked to be equally stricken.
“Penbroke said it’s a bad idea,” he said, turning away from the water to look at Harry. “What are you doing out here anyway, Potter? I’ve heard tell Gryffindor parties last well into the night.”
Harry licked his lips, heart hammering, and took his cock in hand. The lube was cool against his hot skin and made the slide easy when he stroked, from swollen base to leaking tip. He tried to ground himself, to make it feel less like a vivid dream he was having, to force himself to inhabit the reality of the moment, because what a moment it was.
"Harry," he said weakly, fingers digging into Harry's arms. His straining cock arched up against his stomach, dribbling pre-come onto his skin. He'd abandoned his snarky use of Harry's surname in his desperation, walls down for the moment. This was, he'd come to realise, one of his safest spaces — when he could lose himself in the aching pleasure, when he didn't need to worry about what came out of his mouth or what expressions were on his face, when the only thing that mattered was that he let Harry know how good he felt. Harry shushed him and sped his fingers up again, rough strokes that made Draco arch and whine and gasp for breath.
Harry started moving his fingers again and kissed Draco's warm, flushed cheek. Only when Draco began squirming did he pull them out and, releasing Draco's wrists to hold his hips steady, slide his cock back into him. Draco arched and squeezed around him, arms falling to his sides so his hands could ball in the sheets.
“Potter,” Draco breathed, dropping his hands from Potter’s hair down to the front of his robes, where he slipped them inside and brushed his fingers across the waistline of the slacks he was wearing underneath. He heard Potter’s breath hitch and the movement of his lips on Draco’s skin halted. He pulled back and met Draco’s gaze. His pupils were so dilated there were only thin strips of green left circling them. “Can I?”
“It’s just very unlike her.” Setting his knife aside with the last of the beans drained of their juice, Draco set the bowl aside and turned to Blaise, unable to do anything more until the lacewing flies had been turned to powder. “Usually when she starts getting worried about exams she —”
"I knew it would be," he said with a shrug. His eyes lifted to Harry's. "I wish you could still sleep in my room."
Draco’s stomach lurched. How absurd it was that the sentiment — the same one Draco had been unable to say just the other night — should be suspended there between them, more pronounced in omission than it ever could have been had Harry just fucking
“Draco,” Harry said, his voice hardly above a whisper. He put a hand on Draco’s cheek and Draco saw his eyes flitting restlessly across his face, like he was trying to read his thoughts. “I’ll come with you. Do you want me to come with?”
“Fawkes,” Potter said again, and finally he looked over at Draco. His face was pale. “Brought me the Sorting Hat and blinded the snake with his talons. The Sword of Gryffindor was inside the Hat. I’m — er — not sure anymore how I managed it, to be honest, everything about the fight itself is blurry, but
“You know what I mean,” he says. He pulls away and touches his lips to Draco’s soft cheek. Draco pouts but the flush on his skin gives him away. “We’ve watched one every night this month. Can’t miss out on Halloween itself.”
“He’s around here somewhere, dodging the cameras, I’d expect. I’m sure he’d like to see you, Malfoy.” He watched in amazement as her eyes traveled quickly over his robes and back up to his face. “You look really nice. Make sure you don’t leave without saying hello to him, alright?”
Harry gave it his first try just a few days later, up in the eighth-year common room where, yes, Malfoy was collectively ignored (and whispered about behind his back), but at least he wasn't bullied to his face.
Harry opens his mouth to make another sarcastic remark (because he can’t fucking help it, even with his libido screaming out in agony for him to fucking leave it, just let Draco have this power trip) but before he can say anything Draco’s lining up and bares down until the head pushes through the ring of muscle — and he stops there. And Harry’s always been good at biting back vocalisations, an ability to stay quiet no matter what is a highly useful skill for an Auror, but when Draco stops and merely squeezes around the head of his cock he lets out an utterly tormented groan, bucking his hips only for Draco to lift up and away.
“You’re a fucking twat!” Draco hissed; he dug a knee into Harry’s side, satisfied when it wiped the grin off his face and made him grab at his ribs.
It’s the most un-Malfoy thing he can imagine, that bit of dirt. He’s wearing gloves but Harry can see some dirt on his elbow too, just below where he has his sleeves rolled up.
Draco froze, another piece of chicken halfway to his mouth. Instinct, however, kicked in immediately, and he was able to relax his shoulders, his facial muscles. He set the fork back down on the plate and raised an eyebrow at Theo.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Speaking of,” he said, fidgeting a bit, and Potter gave him an odd look. “This whole Patronus thing for Defence. I — erm — I haven’t been particularly successful in the past —”
Something impossibly cogent burned in Harry’s eyes then, and as he smoothed a thumb along Draco’s lower lip, Draco felt premonition make his heart race only a second before the words came out of Harry’s mouth:
They stood there looking at each other for a minute, each replaying in his head those five seconds which had seemed to shatter the entire foundation of the world they’d always lived in.
Crouching in front of him, Harry kept a carefully neutral expression as he surveyed the Gryffindor boy on the floor.
"My girlfriend?" A look of surprise so genuine crosses his face that Draco suddenly feels childish for bringing it up. "Draco, Melanie's not ... she's not my
“Why don’t you wanna fly?” he asked finally, bluntly. Draco felt his cheeks burn and hated that it was a clear giveaway.
The dull, throbbing pain in his bottom lip made it so that Draco couldn’t pretend it hadn’t happened.
Pansy was less fascinated by the couple in the photograph, and when Draco moved towards the monument to take a closer look, she left him to find Blaise.
scraped the E I got on my O.W.L., and that was only because Padma tutored me for, like, five hours straight the night before. You know, she heard Professor Slughorn telling McGonagall that only
Now he did pull away. He didn’t know whether Potter was asking a rhetorical question, and anyway, he was hardly focused on the second part of that impromptu speech Potter had given. The first part was still ringing in his head and making him feel nauseous. After several long moments where Potter watched him with his eyebrows knitted in the middle of his forehead, arm back at his side, Draco forced out the words he desperately wished weren’t true.
Potter craned his neck around to see where Draco was looking — the room held a set of armchairs and a sofa in the middle. Draco’s stomach swooped at the thought of what he wanted so badly to do.
“A pervert, yes, I’ve gathered,” Harry said, even as he slid his fingers back between Draco’s labia. “Shall we find out if that applies to you?”
He stood close to the wall, a subconscious move that was steeped in uncertainty and self-protection. He knew it was okay to answer the question, that they were unflinchingly loyal enough to Harry they would never dream of repeating anything, but it went against every last one of Draco’s instincts, and it was still hard to do. Beyond that, half his mind was back down in the entrance hall with Harry still; it was absolutely maddening not to be able to see what had transpired between him and Theo, and yet Draco knew being there was a dangerous idea. He would never have been able to stay hidden under the Cloak.
Penbroke looked as if whatever answer she was about to give him caused her great pain. He could not imagine why this could be, for if they had discovered a cure, there was no complication in the world that could dampen that joy.
There was silence, and then suddenly Draco found every last article of his clothing gone. He gasped at the chill and took his hands off the desk out of nothing more than surprise.
Harry also knew better than to continue glancing at Malfoy all throughout the lesson, but it didn’t keep him from doing so, even when Hermione furiously whispered under her breath at him to
“What did he look like?” Potter countered instantly. “What did he do?” Draco only looked up at him, unable to get the words out, suddenly feeling panicky and too hot under the Cloak with Potter’s eyes burning holes in his skin. “What happened, Malfoy?” he repeated, more firmly this time. The longer Draco went without speaking, the more it seemed to fuel Potter’s concern, yet Draco could think of nothing to say that wouldn’t be worse than keeping quiet. Finally, Potter’s hand came back up to his neck, a gentle thumb caressing his cheek, turning Draco’s face up when he’d looked away, unable to stare into those burning eyes any longer. “Draco, what
nervous," she went on, "Goyle's only antagonising people, riling them up. No one would be paying Malfoy any mind anymore if he wasn't standing guard over him this way."
“So … what?” Harry asked, leaning forward in his chair and glancing at the page in the book Hermione had stopped on. “You think because he’s still here it’s probably just his bones?"
"You're not eating." Not a question. He's merely stating that he knows this to be a fact. Draco has always found Harry's way of doing that to be severely destabilising. It's as if he's trying to focus and Harry keeps snapping his fingers, drawing his attention. "Or sleeping."
"Then what the hell are you doing, Draco?" He sounds pleading now. "What the fuck is all this, why are you acting this way?"
“I’ve had a long time to come to terms with it, angel. After the things we went through last year … I confess, the only thing I care about these days is your happiness. If another … another man gives that to you, then, well … that’s what matters to me.”
The drawback of having access to Granger’s soaring intellect is that it comes attached to her weirdly adept people-reading skills. He’d known she would see right through him, and so she has.
, Malfoy,” he said sheepishly, but Malfoy was already standing up, slacks loose on his new frame, shirt baggy but unable to hide the shape of the breasts underneath it.
And as quickly as it was there Potter’s weight is gone completely, along with his warm breath and the smell of his soap. He hears “
She was quiet a moment, and then: "That's a very morbid analogy, Draco. I thought most people say it’s like flying. I mean, without the hitting-the-ground part.”
“I hadn’t even been thinking about it when my mother sent me the letter,” Draco said finally, his voice an emotionless monotone. “I guess I hadn’t really believed it would happen, either.”
He moves through the greenhouse slowly, careful not to touch anything even as he admires a few large flowers in a shade of impossibly bright blue and something that looks like a cactus except that it’s swaying ominously.
Harry's hips stuttered and he felt a hot splash of come coating his insides. He continued moving until Draco could feel his prick softening, his back slick with sweat and his chest heaving. Draco kissed him and Harry hardly mustered the strength to kiss back, although he tried. After a minute Draco pulled Harry down beside him and Harry went willingly, flopping into a heap on the bed with a dopey smile.
Malfoy’s back was to Harry, facing the bloke he’d come in with; he looked positively edible in a tight pair of trousers that clung to his arse
how much Harry hates the limelight, hates any praise he doesn't feel he deserves, yet right now Draco's annoyed enough to use that against him. "Terribly frustrating being the darling of the media, skipping huge matches just because you can, knowing your name alone will guarantee you aren't sacked."
“You’re doing this wrong,” Draco said, grabbing a pot from him and mending the cracked ceramic the right way. “We’ll be here all night because of you, idiot.”
The room was small and completely empty save for a metal table and four chairs. Draco and Harry had taken two on the side closest to the door. A couple more guards were standing just outside, where an enormous glass window would let them know if anything was getting out of hand. The first guard had gone to fetch Draco’s father.
"You'd better get used to that," Mrs Weasley said cheerfully. "You've many long years of sleepless nights ahead of you."
The reality of the horrors Potter had faced since he was a year old seemed to strike Draco across the face with brutal intensity.
With no definitive answer forthcoming, Harry and Ron both acquiesced to begin working on their homework, although they gave up after only an hour and a half and elected to play chess instead. It was, after all, only the end of the first week of term — there was no need to push themselves yet.
Harry looked exactly as surprised by this response as Draco had hoped and he let out a gleeful little laugh, only to have it cut off by Harry’s mouth.
The idea that the person who had given Malfoy those bruises — had scared him so badly he wouldn’t even talk about it — could have been living right under Harry’s nose this entire week was enough to make him feel sick. And that it could possibly have been a
Draco, bracing himself on Harry’s shoulders, gave himself over to it completely, letting Harry move him as he pleased, and crying out each time he went back to fiendishly sucking on his breasts. It was the strangest feeling, his tits moving with each vicious drop back onto Harry’s prick, but the way it seemed to drive Harry crazy was momentarily worth any of the dysphoria he’d suffered through in the beginning, and even any lingering now.
“You’ll, erm — you’ll figure it out,” he said awkwardly, fingers raking through his mess of dark hair. Malfoy scowled, a deep blush making his pale skin turn the colour of a tomato.
"Yes," Draco said without hesitation. "He's going to be very angry with me for a little bit, though."
you’re being cryptic, Malfoy, but I know for certain that you are. Why can’t we just skip this whole song and dance for once? Why are you avoiding flying —?”
And Draco, who felt quite as though he hadn’t slept at all the last month Harry had been gone, welcomed the gentle, caressing fingers of oblivion as they pulled his tired body and exhausted mind into a blissful unconsciousness that was, for once, not plagued by nightmares.
"I missed you," he says into Harry's mouth. Harry presses a kiss to the corner of his mouth, his cheek, and then pulls back enough that they can look at each other.
“I’ll leave you two for now,” Slughorn said awkwardly, looking from mother to son. “Dawlish is required to monitor your mother, Mr Malfoy, so he’ll remain here with you. Please help yourselves to tea and biscuits,” he added, gesturing to a breakfast tray on his desk.
As Kenny walked away, Harry looked around at Ron and saw he, too, had been struck oddly by the comment about Cedric. For his part, Harry couldn’t quite tell whether he’d been offended by it or not.
And just like that, Draco’s head fell back on the pillows, his eyes snapped shut, his body bowed beneath Harry, and the next time that thick, pulsing cock rammed into him and pressed against his G-spot, his whole body shuddered with the enormity of an orgasm that lit every one of his nerve endings on fire. Harry didn’t stop — he continued battering his cock into Draco as the pleasure swelled and finally peaked, ripping a silent scream out of him as his body shook with paroxysms of unimaginable pleasure and a pulse of fluid squirted out of him, around Harry’s prick. Draco lost track of everything as his body shivered its way through the last of the shockwaves of rippling sensation, toes curling and hips rocking weakly, mindlessly.
going to tell her, Draco! You always insist on doing things by yourself, and you never seem to realise that you don’t
No sooner has he noticed it than he feels Potter's fingers slipping beneath his robes and pressing against his knickers, drawing a surprised breath out of Draco that makes Potter laugh.
Finally, too sensitive, Draco pushes Harry’s hand away and throws an arm across his face, burning a hectic, vital red.
hours ago," said Draco, finally looking up. "And you ate two helpings of everything. You can't possibly be hungry."
“How’s it going tonight?” Potter asks. Draco doesn’t answer; he tries to block it out even though he already has goosebumps that aren’t from the chill in the breeze. He interlocks his fingers and prays harder.
The question was absurd and sounded rhetorical anyway, so Harry didn't answer. Instead, with his heart racing, he leaned in closer, and — meeting no resistance — dropping his gaze to Malfoy's mouth at the last second before closing his eyes — he touched their lips together. For a second neither of them did anything, they simply sat there with their mouths pressed together, Harry aware of that sweet, peachy smell more distinct than ever, and then suddenly Malfoy was hesitantly opening his mouth and Harry did the same. The kiss was all lips, slow and clumsy and unsure, and a few shaky breaths passed between them. Harry lifted his hand to Malfoy's face, at first a tentatively half-closed fist that eventually relaxed and cupped his cheek.
Draco scowled and looked away, another salty tear spilling over onto his cheek. It stung, to hear Harry’s promise from the night before relayed back to him once again by his best mate. The promise that it was
Harry said nothing, and when Draco finally set the last pot down and allowed himself to look, he saw that Harry’s expression was uncharacteristically difficult to read. It sent a shiver up Draco’s spine — this, he thought, was probably closer to the Auror Potter criminals were used to seeing.
“Right. I just meant … I really do have feelings for you, Draco. Like … mad, crazy feelings, y’know? I don’t want it to be a fling.”
There it is again — a twinge of annoyance. The feeling like Harry's accusing him of something. Except unlike last night, when he'd been able to push it aside in order to enjoy Harry's company when he'd come back from seeing Buckley, the twinge turns to a solid pit of irritation.
As the days continued getting nicer, they sometimes took their work outside to sit under a beech tree near the lake, Daphne included. It was terrible for Harry, Ron, and Goyle’s focus, but it was impossible to stay indoors with the sun shining so temptingly through the windows.
“Being in love. I never have been … and I seem to remember a thirteen-year-old Draco Malfoy claiming he would never be caught dead falling in love, either.”
“You’re not fat, Draco,” Harry said distractedly. His brows were furrowed in concentration, quill poised over the parchment as he looked back and forth between a textbook and his essay. “You’re pregnant.”
“Yours tells you where I am,” he says unnecessarily. “And mine tells me where you are. I wanted to feel more connected to you, I guess. It’s not to keep an eye on you or anything. Do you … like it? I can always —”
A hollow void seemed to have appeared in Draco's chest as he went back to his bed and sank down onto it, bringing his knees to his chest and burying his face there as sobs wracked his body.
There's a sinking sensation in his chest, realising too late he hadn't actually been prepared to hear that his suspicions were correct.
His stomach dropped, but Harry quickly assured himself it couldn’t possibly be what he was thinking. Yes, Malfoy had told him he’d punched his attacker in the face, but
“I seriously doubt he’d be happy about being gawked at,” Harry said hotly, and then cleared his throat when he realised how close he’d come to growling those words. Parvati appeared taken aback. “I mean … he’s probably already uncomfortable enough as it is.”
“They do, don’t they? Sort of mythical. I saw it, though, I heard it and everything, saw its wings. And according to Hermione, they’re not usually alone, so it was a hell of a cool thing. There’s even this myth that rooks embody thought and memory. That a rook never forgets. They're one of my favourite animals. Anyway … I guess it’s all pretty fitting, isn’t it?”
, when they don’t have a clue. When they were perfectly happy to treat me like a raving lunatic a few years ago, before they were ready to believe me about Voldemort.” His hand lifted to Draco’s cheek, and Draco, for his part, still couldn’t tear his eyes away from Potter’s. He felt short of breath. “Some of it's hard to talk about, but I
The story for some reason makes Draco’s heart hurt, and after a moment he realises it’s because he misses Harry. Sure, he can be so fucking stubborn it’s painful, and his unwavering devotion to his own moral code is about as arrogant as you can get, and yeah, it’s sickening to know how humble he is, how much he despises the extra attention he gets in his Auror program, but god, Draco’s never been so in love with anyone. He even thinks maybe he loves Harry because of these things.
Normally, Hermione would have already buried her nose in a book by the time they were ten minutes out of Hogsmeade, but today, both she and Ron kept exchanging covert glances that Harry was very much aware of, but didn’t bother mentioning. He’d gotten used to this over the years — Ron and Hermione’s silent form of communication in his presence, particularly when they were preparing to broach a topic they planned to tag-team.
Setting his broom aside, Harry sat down cautiously beside the blond, noting with interest that Malfoy’s cheeks adopted a tinge of pink that was somehow endearing — and that was where he stopped himself.
On the day of the match, Harry enjoyed a brief respite from his circling thoughts. The whole school was buzzing with excitement over the first game of the year — even the Slytherin and Ravenclaw students had come down to breakfast chatting happily about who they were rooting for. It was so much like the old days that Harry felt almost as though he could have looked up at the head table and seen Dumbledore sitting there, blue eyes shining with delight as he tucked into his food. The atmosphere of the Great Hall was so cheerful that this thought, instead of being sad, managed only to fill Harry with nostalgic warmth and a pleasant sort of ache. Dumbledore, he thought, would have been proud to see what had become of Hogwarts the year after Voldemort’s downfall.
Malfoy hadn’t gotten off at least since he’d been hexed, or that he was now begging Harry to help him do just that.
“Yes,” says Draco softly. “And when I stopped dating him we didn’t go back to … I thought we’d moved past it. I thought we were settling with just friends.”
, he thought to himself, imagining it even as he said it: he could see Hermione’s face like she was right in front of him, that look of worry, of deep concern; it was the same look she’d given him fifth year when she’d been walking on egg shells around him, or the day she’d told him about his wand when they’d been on the run.
. “No. No, I’m sorry, I … I need to leave. I’m sorry, Professor.” Forgetting his bag entirely, he barely noticed Hermione and Ron trying to get his attention, nor the stares following his back as he left the classroom as quickly as he could.
“Do you know what happened, then?” Theo said, and at the blank look on Draco’s face, continued, “in the forest, I mean. Did your mother tell you?”
“He’ll call,” says Harry. His stomach clenches with the truth of it. Still pouting, Draco looks at him. Sometimes there’s something in his eyes that makes Harry think maybe he knows. Maybe it’s written all over his face.
Even if he hadn’t been in the middle of a menstrual cycle, Draco knew he wouldn’t have been even remotely comfortable letting Potter’s hands anywhere near …
It had been a terrible fight, that’s why. He simply hasn’t been able to face Draco yet out of shame. He needs to apologise — wants to apologise — but it’s difficult figuring out how. The right words don’t come to him easily and he’s resisted asking Hermione for help, because he feels that he needs to do it himself.
Something very cold descended into Draco’s chest, a trepidation whose origin he couldn’t quite put his finger on.
moronic,” Malfoy breathed, even as Harry began hurriedly popping the fastenings on his shirt. When his fingers slipped for the third time, he growled low in his throat and simply tore the shirt open, buttons flying haphazardly and landing noisily all across the hardwood floor. “Potter, you fucking
hadn’t been the one to follow Harry in the first place — and Harry was following suit. “There’s a mutual loathing that’s existed since the first time we laid eyes on each other, whether you've decided to pretend otherwise or not. I came here because you looked like you were about to keel over and Merlin knows Granger and Weasley could only stoke the flames of a panic attack. Now you’re fine, and I’m leaving.”
Harry grabbed his wand out of his jeans lying on the edge of the tub and coated his fingers with lube, which felt distinctly strange under the water but still helped ease the slide into Draco's arse. He fingered him open and then lubed his cock and pushed inside. Draco was putty in his hands, weightless in the water, and he made soft mewling sounds every time Harry fucked up into him.
“We’ll talk more later,” Hermione said, squeezing his arm and flashing another brilliant smile. It lit her face up beautifully, reminding Harry of a much younger, more innocent Hermione Granger, who had had large front teeth and untamable hair and a penchant for hissing at Harry and Ron if they tried to sneak out of the common room. “When are you seeing him next?”
“I wouldn’t know, would I?” Draco drawled, lifting a sardonic eyebrow. “Seeing as you always managed to get to it first.”
He looked up, eyebrows lifted. “Yes,” he said a little defensively. “For obvious reasons. At first it was just sex. A lot of it, so he usually came here. Apparently Granger and the Weasel are notorious for popping round his place unexpectedly.”
“Well … maybe being inside it I just have a different perspective on the whole thing,” Harry said with a small, consoling smile. “But I think maybe you’re also just feeling a bit guilty.”
“He’s nearly done,” Pansy answered for him. Blaise made no sign of agreement, only dipped his quill in his ink pot and continued writing. “And he won’t help me at all.”
In spite of himself Draco laughed, and with the laughter, absurdly, came tears. Not a lot, but enough that Harry finally scooted closer and wrapped an arm around him.
“Will you stay tonight?” Draco asks eventually. It’s a silly question that Harry answers with a snort and then another kiss.
Draco shook his head. “No,” he said firmly, although this was not the simple truth. The truth was that he would need nine months just to consider all the angles. “I couldn’t take care of a kid. I’m …”
it even, but Potter's words had sounded sickeningly sincere, and as much as Draco loved to believe that Potter was nothing more than the hyped-up hero his father had always insisted he was, that image of the Boy Who Lived had already begun cracking and falling to pieces since the day nearly five months ago now that Potter had saved his life.
“Well I couldn’t know for sure until you said something scathing and insulted me, could I?” Harry quipped with a raised brow, finding it much easier to accept this as
with him doesn’t necessitate rumour-mongering!” She shouted this from behind them, standing on her toes.
They fell asleep that way, and in the early hours of the morning Ginny snuck out of his bed and went back to her dorm for the last time.
a pervert, Malfoy,” Harry reminded him, coming closer to the bed and leaning against one of the posts, grinning at Malfoy where he’d sat down on the edge. “If you think I’ve forgotten how eager you were to get your hands under my robes, I’m afraid you’re sorely mistaken.”
Harry merely shrugged. He wasn’t sure himself why he’d personally vouched for his once arch-nemesis at Hogwarts, why he’d faced a trial as big as Draco Malfoy’s — the press, the interviews, the photographs — just to keep him out of Azkaban, and further, to allow him to come back to school and finish his education. That Dark Mark was still on his arm — it always would be — but all Harry could ever see was the face of a terrified child on top of the Astronomy Tower who’d never in a million years have been able to do what Snape had stepped in to do for him. A child who’d been forced into Voldemort’s ranks, and furthermore, who’d not given Harry away when he’d been captured even though Harry knew in his gut Malfoy had known it was him kneeling on the floor of Malfoy Manor.
“It’s barely a wisp of smoke,” Malfoy muttered, looking quite embarrassed. It was ridiculously endearing. “Snape tried to help me once, but … well, I obviously couldn’t do it, could I?”
“D’you know what this would look cute with?” Harry said, suddenly behind him, one hand sliding across his bare lower back and raising goose bumps there.
“In your dreams, Potter,” Draco taunted, leaning forward in order to breathe it into his ear. Potter groaned again, green eyes falling out of sight behind closed lids as Draco stroked him at a maddeningly slow pace, squeezing over the head on every pass. Potter’s stubbly cheek was scratchy against Draco’s own smooth one, and he turned his head just enough that he could press his lips to that rough texture instead, following it down to Potter’s neck and sinking his teeth in at the place where he could feel a pulse fluttering beneath the skin, as delicate as the wings of a Snitch. Potter hissed and his hands squeezed hard where they’d landed on Draco’s thighs again, still spread open with Potter standing between them.
“Oh, please, Ron,” said Hermione, but Harry could see a smile twitching at the corners of her lips. “Cormac was harmless.”
"No ... no, I just — it hadn't occurred to me before." Changing the subject back around to Malfoy, he asked, "Why were you wandering around alone without Goyle?"
“Draco, you’re building up a very distorted image of me right now,” Harry said softly, and there was even what seemed to be a note of sardonic humour underneath the words. One hand had begun rubbing soothing circles into Draco’s back. “I’m not the only one who bad stuff has ever happened to … I’m just the only one who’s had it all thrust into the spotlight for public scrutiny.”
"Yeah," he said, seeming to come back to himself a little. "It was just ... it was nice, being ..." he gestured vaguely at the air above his head, "somewhere else for a minute."
discoveries), he was finding it all too easy to slip back into the petty banter the two had shared for so long, before the pettiness had turned into something much deeper, and much darker. The thought made Harry’s eyes jump down to Malfoy’s left arm, where the Dark Mark — unaware of its master’s defeat, unaware of its owner’s anatomical shift — was still black as death on that pale skin. “I was only thinking how convenient it is you’d already filled the tub for me.”
Draco jumped away from him so fast Harry hardly had time to blink, making Hermione cut off abruptly to look. His book dropped onto the floor with a muffled sound. Ron and Hermione both stared, first at Harry, who was frozen but having trouble keeping his surprised laughter at bay, and then at Draco, who was pink-faced and looked absolutely startled.
"Merlin’s fucking tits, Pansy, I’m taking the piss," he drawls, sitting up finally and reaching for the pack sitting on the coffee table for a new one. "Do lighten up, won't you?"
“And don’t say that shit again about us breaking up eventually,” says Harry, “because it’s a piss-poor excuse not to do something. I love you. Do you love me?”
It was tidy in a way that Harry’s dorm had never been — wouldn’t have been even if he’d been living alone, he supposed. Even the contents of Malfoy's open trunk were tidy. With the door shut behind them, he pulled off the Cloak and set it aside on an armchair near the bed, the cushions of which were the same shade of green as the bed’s velvet curtains.
Draco had not made all that much progress with his Patronus — he couldn’t seem to muster up the extra
"Right." Ron and Hermione had continued on their way inside, and though Harry needed to finish up the homework they were heading to the library to work on, he wasn't about to leave until he felt sure Malfoy was safe. "What book is it, then?"
This surprises Potter. He can tell because his dark eyebrows rise half an inch up his forehead and he surveys Draco with percipient green eyes. He watches Potter with his spine stiff and his fingers clawing his thighs, waiting, he suddenly understands, for judgment. For this living, breathing anomaly of nature to hear Draco’s sins and decide whether he deserves absolution.
Harry was silent for a few moments. He looked troubled, and when he finally spoke, it was with great hesitance in his voice.
"Oh, well if that's all," said Harry with a roll of his eyes. At that moment, he noticed movement from the bench where Malfoy and Goyle were sitting and realised Goyle had stood up. He was hovering deliberately in front of Malfoy, who had looked up from his book and appeared apprehensive. A few boys who looked to be sixth- or seventh-years had slowed as they were passing them.
For a moment, Harry doesn’t do anything. He just looks down at Draco, eyebrows furrowed, thinking deeply. When he does finally move, it’s to wrap his fingers around the back of Draco’s neck and pull him into a kiss that’s slow and yet anything but soft. It sends tendrils of fire creeping along Draco’s veins, sparking his nerve-endings and turning his skin into goose flesh.
"You don't have to understand it," says Draco quietly. "You just have to respect it." And a moment later, "I'm going home. I've had more than enough of this."
Ron approached him Saturday morning, just after breakfast and before all the eligible students lined up to go to Hogsmeade.
With Ron off on the pitch playing a scrimmage game with a few other students, Harry was able to work himself up to opening what felt like a Pandora’s Box of secrets he’d never again be able to stuff back into concealment once he’d shown Hermione its contents.
“Malfoy,” he agreed. He couldn’t help a sudden, exasperated grin, thinking of the times they’d sat in this pub
“You know, Malfoy,” Potter turned to him, a thoughtful look on his face, “I know earlier I wouldn’t talk about the Dursleys, like I said, it’s a shit topic. A lot of topics for me are pretty much shit. But I
“Why did I always care so much?” he asked eventually. “Why did he get to me so much more than anybody else? It’s just
"You're gonna lose interest," Draco admits. His throat is tight and he's terrified he might start crying. "You're eventually gonna want someone you can relate to better, who you have more in common with. Someone who's ... who's as emotionally vulnerable as you are. I'm not like that, Harry."
"What d'you think?" Draco asked, trying to make it sound like a joke except that it wasn't. Not in the least.
“Problem, Potter?” Malfoy lilted, biting impishly down on his bottom lip. He would, of course, know exactly what Harry was dealing with at the moment, and perhaps for the very first time be feeling glad for something about his new body. It was utterly impossible to tell if Malfoy was as turned on as he was, after all. The only thing he had to go by were Malfoy’s flushed cheeks and panting breaths.
“Well,” said Draco, lowering his gaze to his glass of wine and watching it flirt dangerously with the lip as he swirled it. His cheeks felt warm, but he wasn’t embarrassed. “We snuck around.”
Harry didn’t answer the question. Instead, he said: “Where?” Malfoy’s pupils grew. The flush on his cheeks darkened. Harry was visited by a desire to feel whether it made Malfoy’s cold, marble-like skin warm. As Malfoy looked behind them, Harry pulled his boxers back up over his erection.
Narcissa," Harry corrected him with a roll of his eyes. "I said she seems to have changed just the same as Draco has and it's made me really hopeful."
Draco complies, lifting himself up so that Harry can undo his flies and pull down his trousers, Draco getting them the rest of the way off himself. They work on Harry next, and only once they're both naked does Draco lower himself again, toes curling at the way it feels when their cocks press together. Licking his hand in a crude gesture that makes Draco feel a little faint, Harry wraps it around both of them and starts wanking them slowly, dropping a kiss on Draco's chin. Draco rocks helplessly into the motion, anchoring himself with hands on Harry's shoulders and his eyes slipping closed, because it's all so
Below the chair are Draco’s oxfords where he’d slipped them off before lifting his legs. They’re brand new and spotlessly clean, and maybe they’re just shoes but they’re a testament to Draco’s personality and for that Harry likes them.
him looked more formidable than Theo; Harry was standing his ground, hand poised above the wand in his pocket but not touching it. In contrast, Theo had his pointed at Harry’s chest, and he looked both wild and unstable. It was something Draco had never seen on him before, and knew instinctively that the prospect of losing his father tomorrow had done this.
“And that’s Malfoy’s business,” she said with an eyebrow raised, reminding him forcibly of Mrs Weasley. “
, each time Harry pushed his thick fingers deeper inside of him, each time he sucked at the reddened skin around his hole, coating it ever more liberally with slick, Draco could feel the stirrings of arousal not only in his dripping cunt, but in a prick that was no longer there.
they knew how much it would irk him. But it hadn’t just been the Gryffindors; even the Slytherins had been clapping, save for a small few closest to the door, which Harry immediately identified as Malfoy, Zabini, Parkinson, Bulstrode, Goyle, and Nott. It didn’t bother him the way the applause did, but it did make him curious. After all, he’d vouched for them himself when the question of whether or not to let them return arose, and as for Malfoy … well, he would have been behind bars along with his father had Harry not personally attended the trial and spoken on that ungrateful prat’s behalf.
The logic was difficult to disagree with; after holding Granger’s gaze another moment, Draco threw the Cloak over his head and left the room with the other two in tow. The closer he got to the entrance hall, the more rapidly his anxiety seemed to be spilling over into the forefront of his mind, so that by the time they had reached the marble staircase and heard yelling down below, Draco was nearly frantic.
They didn’t meet Wednesday night, having mutually decided they could use the sleep before more exams on Thursday; they met instead on Friday, in Draco’s room rather than the empty classroom, both mentally drained but satisfied to know it was all over until second term started in January. The next morning the Hogwarts Express would be leaving for King’s Cross to bring an overwhelming majority of students home for the holidays.
For a moment, Malfoy didn’t answer. He seemed to be considering Harry, and his face was indecipherable.
“Why would I wear your ugly jumper, Potter, I have a chest filled with expensive silk pyjamas at my disposal!”
Theo was one of the only other Slytherins in Draco’s year taking N.E.W.T.-level Arithmancy, Tracey Davis being the other. Draco turned stiffly, hand clutching his bag until his knuckles were much whiter than usual. However, upon spotting the boy in question a few feet back, Draco saw he was carrying two copies of
Malfoy, apparently still in possession of just enough sanity to manage the task, pulled his own shirt over his head and then did Harry's. Beneath him suddenly was a tantalising expanse of pale skin and sharp angles, jutting ribs, criss-crossing scars over a narrow abdomen. Malfoy's hands went back to his face and he pulled Harry down again into a frantic kiss, hips lifting and dragging their cocks together through their clothes. Harry stroked his hands up the sides of Malfoy's naked torso, over the pleasantly tactile ridge of his ribs, feeling the texture of the scars beneath the pads of his fingers, and finally back down to his waist, around which Harry's hands curled almost too easily.
Leaving his school robes behind in the dorm, Harry went out to the pitch clad in a pair of denims and an old T-shirt that was just a little bit small on him these days. All the work he’d done on Hogwarts over the summer had apparently paid off, the short sleeves of the tee hugging his biceps in a way they certainly never had before. That, and the fact that for the first time ever he'd spent a summer having enough food to eat at all times.
“I’ll look into it,” she says. There’s a bit of a smile on her face that tells Draco she has something up her sleeve. For the first time in a long time, it feels like being with a new friend.
outside the Great Hall, where the whole bloody school was eating dinner. He was suddenly angry at himself for having followed Granger and Weasley up here, for having let his temporarily-frazzled nerves get the better of him.
?” said Potter, eyebrows raised in such a way that – probably intentionally – made Draco feel as if he’d just overreacted.
Malfoy spared Harry a glance before heading off in the opposite direction with Goyle in tow, shooting death glares at everyone they passed.
getting hurt. He’s dealing with enough without me using him to figure out how I feel. Or my ... sexuality, or whatever.”
If there was any blood that had soaked through onto his chair, Draco didn’t take the time to stop and find out — without even grabbing his bag he was hurrying out of the room and leaving behind a stunned silence.
Harry gave him a dull look. "Are you really about to try and convince me this has been casual sex, Draco?"
He didn't answer; instead his eyes dropped to Harry's lips, and Harry took that as a yes. He leaned in slowly, bringing their mouths together and pressing his tongue between Malfoy's teeth. Malfoy's hands rose to grip Harry's upper arms, clenching his fingers rhythmically in his robes. The kiss deepened steadily as he relaxed into it, letting Harry work his mouth open and press him into the wall. He brought their hips together and Malfoy made a soft sound into his mouth, but a moment later his hands had migrated to Harry's chest and he pushed him back a little, just enough to break the kiss.
Potter nods. Draco can see the recognition on his face: the one who had brought him and his friends to the manor with Greyback. He can’t remember his name — just his face. And his eyes, the moment Draco had realised the man’s sanity was gone. They’d been empty, worse than dead.
He found Draco's prostate again and concentrated on hitting it with every deep press inside, Draco's cock twitching feebly between them until Harry's hand wrapped around it, wanking him out of time with his thrusts. His orgasm building quickly again, Draco abandoned any last attempt at holding eye contact and let his head fall back once more, whimpering and writhing under Harry as the pleasure built and finally peaked, nails digging into Harry's back. His whole body convulsed with it and Harry didn't slow down the whole time, fucking him through it and stretching it out until Draco was twitching with aftershocks and could hardly move his hips to meet Harry's thrusts anymore. His insides continued being battered for another minute or so, hands moving through Harry's hair as he urged him on in a weak and breathless voice.
For as much outraged protesting as had initially met the announcement that the eighth-years would be sharing a common room, it had taken a relatively short time for it to begin feeling normal, and even less time for the benefits to start being felt by all. Namely, that they were free of the burden of underclassmen in their living space.
Harry laughed weakly and finally closed his eyes once more. The back of his head touched the stone wall, and though his mind tried flitting to a hundred different places at once — back to the forest, back to the Shrieking Shack, to Bathilda Bagshot’s house, to the sight of the dead in the Great Hall — it gave up with a shuddering completeness the moment Malfoy took him back in his mouth, and the relief was so huge that Harry moaned, the sound agonised and grateful and broken.
"Merlin's bollocks," said Dean, breaking the silence in Harry's immediate vicinity. "You know, I can't even see what they get out of it, pushing him around. He's all skin and bones and he doesn't talk."
With another scoff and a resentful sweep of Malfoy’s body, Connor slammed his drink down on the bar and stalked away.
His face flushed with colour, but before he could say anything, Blaise had loudly dropped the pestle he was holding into the bowl of lacewing flies.
“Yes,” Malfoy said tightly. “Well … sort of … it’s slowed down at the moment. I’m, er — not wearing one of those awful cotton things right now… Pomfrey says it’ll be irregular for a while. I don’t want you to
Malfoy nearly jumped out of his skin and, on instinct it seemed, tried to cover up the piece of parchment he was writing on. It wrinkled and some of the ink smeared. Harry was able to see that it was a letter, and although the word after 'dear' at the top was covered, he saw the word 'Father' elsewhere and realised with a sinking heart that Malfoy was probably writing to his mum.
Something utterly extraordinary happened then — Weasley stood up from his own bed, crossed the few feet that separated it from Harry’s, and sat down next to Draco.
," said Hermione one night, when it was just her and Ron and Harry, Goyle and Draco in their dormitory. "But he's not as ... well,
he looked, not far off from the way Harry had seen him after he'd been hit by the Cruciatus Curse. As if right now he wasn't even bothering to put up any sort of façade of normalcy. It hurt Harry's heart to see it, but at the same time it made him feel impossibly happy to know that Malfoy was beginning to trust him enough to let his guard down a little bit.
She continued looking at him blankly, and for a couple terrible seconds it occurred to Draco that this must have been the last straw; the hex she’d been able to handle, even being gay, but dating
A hand appeared on his forehead. He felt his limbs released from the restraints but had no strength to move them. He was groggy and a little confused, everything coming back to him in pieces. And then, also in pieces, he began to notice things.
“How is it you found me, Potter?” Draco turned to him with a raised eyebrow, entirely serious about cracking this mystery wide open once and for all. “And I want a real answer. I’m beginning to think you stalk me under that Cloak twenty-four hours a day.”
"No," Draco said firmly. He was wearing a soft smile. Harry chuckled. "You're lucky you saved the world or you'd have nothing going for you at all. Well," he added, rolling his eyes, "I s'pose you're sort of fit."
"Sorry," he said, sitting down next to him, "wasn't trying to be. Is it your mum you're writing to?"
Harry scoffs loudly. “They could name me king of the world and I still wouldn’t be going out on dates with random people just for the hell of it,” he says, flicking the ash off his cigarette with just a tad too much force. “I don’t fancy anyone, that’s all. When I fancy someone, I’ll go out with them. Why don’t you contact bookstore bloke and ask him out yourself?” he says, changing the subject. And of course Draco is easily swayed by the mention of his latest crush.
fucking years old, Hermione. I spent eleven years in a cupboard under some stairs and the next seven working up to the task of killing an evil fucking
"But I appreciate the apology," Harry went on. Goyle looked down. "And I accept it. And I hope we can look out for Draco together."
class, Potter. There’s a precision in the magic of numbers you’ll never find in a flimsy subject like Divination.”
"It's good just to know they'll be gone, honestly," he said softly. "You really are a saint, Potter."
He doesn’t know much about Muggle religions aside from the fact that their Christmas tree has its origins in Wizarding history and Draco’s own Pagan ancestors, who worshipped the tree as a symbol of nature under the guise of Muggle Christianity. They’ve talked about it a little bit in the new mandatory Muggle Studies class this year, but not much.
Harry shook his head. "No, it's okay. I don't think he'll come down for a little while and I'm starving, let's go."
There is something like hope in his chest. He can’t remember the last time he felt so light. He looks at Potter, watching him intently, and he knows that Potter can see what’s just happened. He frowns as he watches Draco.
“I dunno,” his gaze moved to the hulking shape of the castle, green eyes etching its sheer enormity. “I miss sneaking around. Properly, I mean.”
— wrapping his lips around the fat head and sliding his tongue along the sensitive foreskin, delighting in the way he could feel Potter shiver from the contact. He’d always liked sucking cock, and because it was Potter, and Potter had
? It seemed so absurd, so unlikely. This whole time Harry had been eyeing the Slytherins, wondering which one of them had done it … but what if it
"Fine," Draco said, climbing off the bed and beginning to pull his clothes back on. His snippy movements told Harry he was fully back to himself. "I look forward to saying I told you so." He buttoned his flies and swept a hand through his hair, which fell quite naturally into a more-or-less respectable position. It was the absolute antithesis of Harry's. "You
?” Hermione questioned sharply, though the effect was ruined by the amusement on her face. Parvati, Harry noted with some surprise, had taken on a faint blush, her dark eyes glittering where they rested on Seamus.
to just fall for somebody’s looks. Don’t take this the wrong way, but you made the same mistake third year when you dressed up like a Dementor during that Quidditch match.”
He meant it now. There had been nothing but sincerity in Harry’s eyes when he said it. The issue was whether or not he would still find his way into meaning it once it actually happened.
Harry pulled him in by the back of the neck, kissed him soundly, and was gone in another moment. Draco smiled to himself; around three in the morning, maybe four, he would wake to Harry’s wandering hands and insistent lips, and in that transcendent darkness of the early morning hours, with Harry smelling like sweat and adrenaline and maybe blood, it would feel religious when Harry fucked him and said
The soft, exquisite noises Draco makes push Harry past the edge himself and he comes inside of Draco with his veins thrumming; he fucks madly up into him until his come is leaking out around his cock and still he keeps going, sliding through all that slick, working himself until his shaking and weak and can hardly move. Draco takes over again, rocking on top of him, milking him of every last shudder and shiver and moan.
“That boy saved us both from Azkaban, darling.” She moved a piece of hair away from his face, her fingers chilly but comforting where they brushed his skin. “I’ll
"Well I didn't wanna get your hopes up or anything," said Harry with a shrug. "And it's not really a pleasant subject. But yeah, it's gone through. I've no idea how your dad's doing, but at least it won't get worse."
The stadium was in exactly the same place as it had been when Harry had gone to see the World Cup at fourteen. Only a week away, hundreds of witches and wizards from all over the world with cheap tickets had already begun to gather on the campground outside. Harry arrived at an Apparition point exclusively for Ministry officials and the players themselves.
“Wait,” Harry said, suddenly remembering the incident in class just a few days ago, “aren’t you on your …”
"Yeah, and you too," said Harry, eyeing him. "You heard what she said, he needs rest. I've —" He nearly told him he'd been under the Cruciatus Curse before, he
wanted to do, but …” His sentence trailed off, shaking his head, and he looked up at Malfoy again. “Truth is, since the day I killed him, everything’s just felt so …
Draco cried out and nearly sagged against the door, but Harry dug the nails of his free hand into the meat of Draco’s arse, stilling him.
"I'll see you guys later," he says to Ron and Hermione, and he spares Draco once last searching glance before he's out the door, opting for Apparition instead of the Floo apparently. Draco realises his hand is still in the bowl and takes it out, then replaces it on the mantel.
"Are you gonna come for me again?" he asked, stilling his fingers inside Draco and rubbing directly against that bundle of nerves. A few tears leaked out of the corners of Draco's eyes and he made a high, needy sound in his throat. His cock was once again filling, thickening, beading pre-come.
It was sloppy at first — a hard, desperate, panting slide of mouths, teeth nipping and tongues curling slickly around each other; but as the minutes wore on, Draco’s fingers stroking idly up and down Potter’s sides, their desperation tapered off into a slower rhythm which was mostly lips and tongue, and which pulled quiet, gasping breaths out of Draco every now and then.
“Relax, would you?” Harry said softly. “I’m making good on my promise.” And in spite of Draco’s mumbled protests, Harry began unfastening Draco’s robes so he could push them aside.
It was a deep voice and all too familiar, filling him simultaneously with horror (at being caught by Potter) and a very keen sense of exhilaration, one which generally made itself known when Golden Boy was close by.
“Potter!” Malfoy screeched. The blush had returned, and Harry barely managed to keep from punching the air in triumph.
“Died, yeah.” Harry nodded. At Draco’s horrified expression, Harry grinned and lifted their hands, pressing a kiss to the back of Draco’s mittened fingers. “I … maybe I should have warned you, I’m sorry. I just … with, you know, the baby and all that, I …”
“You don’t need to apologise,” Potter said. His eyes were a bit red-rimmed, he looked utterly exhausted, but that vitality that Draco associated with Potter’s presence was warm and strong and making his blood sing in his veins.
– and with a crooked grin grabbed whatever the hell he had come in here for in the first place and left.
Potter let out a deep sigh, eyeing Draco wearily. He seemed suddenly to drain of energy. Or perhaps he was simply letting go of the fight, something Draco would have thought impossible. For himself
“Harry told us you were going,” said Weasley. “Why were you coming up from the dungeons? He said you were Floo-ing there from McGonagall’s office.”
His face burned hot while he stood there and waited for Theo to catch up, jaw clenched as he reached out and took it slowly, meeting his eyes with reluctance. Other students weaved around them, and neither bothered to move from the middle of the hallway.
Harry sleeps now. Deeply. His body has finally learned it doesn’t need to be on high alert anymore, and his mind is healing, little by little, letting him find peace for perhaps the first time in his life. On one or two occasions, Draco swears he’s heard Harry laughing in his sleep.
In fact, he hadn’t spoken to Pansy for nearly a week now. The last time had been the day after the debacle in the entrance hall with Theo, and Draco had proceeded to ream into her for going behind his back and telling her mum about the hex. Yes, it had turned out okay in the end, but for fuck’s sake, what if it
"What you can't do," Hermione smiled gently, "is apply logic to emotions. Especially not Harry's. Draco, I know Harry better than I know myself. I know him better than I know Ron, if I'm telling you the truth. Ron still
Goyle asked Harry for a word, which he consented to a little warily. Draco gave them a weird, hesitant look, but at Harry's ushering left them alone.
“Malfoy?” she said quizzically, stopping in her tracks and coming over to him. “Harry’s been … when did you get back?”
“Scared out of his fucking wits?” Draco said sharply. Even in his own head his voice sounded just this side of hysterical. “Yeah. Surprise, so am I. At least he’s not the one with a fucking
He’d been sore for two days now, and every time he sat down that spot between his legs throbbed and stung. Draco went back and forth between wanting to scream out of frustration and going utterly red in the face each time it reminded him of the way Harry had looked pounding into him so ruthlessly, and his cunt subsequently flooded with warmth.
The flat was on the twenty-fifth floor of a building in the heart of London; it was nearing midnight when Harry, clutching his third beer, pulled Malfoy away from a bloke who was attempting to chat him up and out onto the balcony.
Draco looked at him with wide eyes, like he'd never heard of such a thing before. His cheeks positively glowed with colour, but then he was nodding and he sat up, hesitating, and finally turning over. He went down on his hands and looked over his shoulder at Harry, who was feeling very much like he was receiving some of that good karma he'd been racking up his entire life. The jumper slid up his back a little, exposing two perfect little dimples just above Draco's arse that Harry couldn't
“We’d better go, Ron,” he said, setting his fork down on his plate of half-eaten eggs. “Ginny,” he called a little further down the table, grabbing her attention, “You ready? Locker room in ten.”
The night his father had been arrested, then. Draco said nothing, and Weasley didn’t elaborate any further. It was strange to realise many of the horrors Harry had faced, Weasley had faced them right by his side.
It was on the pretense of returning the jumper that Draco asked Potter if he wanted to come by again on a Saturday just two weeks before exams and the start of the holidays. Potter had seemed surprised but agreed with enthusiasm.
“I’m just —” he started, but cut off when he saw a large group of Ravenclaws nearing the greenhouse door for the next lesson. Harry turned to look and raised a hand to the back of his head, rubbing his hair.
“Your ostentatious displays of wandless magic are wholly unnecessary, Potter,” he grumbled, not entirely sure whether it annoyed him more that Potter was capable of such astounding magical feats, or that he, Draco, was so unbearably turned on by them.
"What's your point, Harry?" he says, looking at him. There's a moment of silence, and then Harry shrugs again.
“Right,” he said. “Well, er — you know how you said you don’t think Malfoy deserves to be forgiven?”
enough for you?” He raised thick eyebrows and Draco turned his face away, mortified, even though Harry clearly wasn’t making fun of him. “Draco, I … you’re
Harry huffs out a breath but agrees; he likes Draco’s warm weight and doesn’t really care if it’s a little more difficult to do, but mostly it’s because in spite of the burn he’s still half-hard and doesn’t necessarily need everyone seeing it. Dean brings over the flat tray with a mirrored base that Harry likes to use for this purpose and sets it down on Draco’s lap.
,” Potter cuts him off. “And you know it, otherwise you wouldn’t be in this Muggle cathedral asking a Muggle god for absolution.”
“Do you want me to get you off, then? Like this?” he said suddenly, voice low and rough in Draco’s ear, creating goosebumps. “Or do you think … I could return that favour now?”
Draco swallowed hard, his stomach in a knot. Harry’s name sat precariously at the tip of his tongue, careening maddeningly back and forth.
his throat, which made Malfoy gag finally and pull off. Harry opened his eyes in time to see a string of spit and come connecting Malfoy’s swollen lower lip and the head of his cock before he licked his lips and it disappeared.
advice, Potter,” Draco drawled, turning a raised eyebrow on him. “You walk around in ripped denims and washed-out T-shirts.”
to taste that flushed skin. Malfoy shivered and tightened his fingers; Harry felt sharp nails piercing him through the thin material of his shirt.
“Muggle band,” he explained. He pulled a glass jar from the back of his closet and brought it over to the bed. “You can sit down, you know.”
It's not something he'd been expecting and he looks at Pratchett without bothering to cover up his surprise.
was the one with friends he could trust, who cared about him so much they would swallow back their hatred just to give him a chance to be happy.
Unlike with Potter, it wasn’t difficult to find time to spend with Theo; the Slytherin common room had plenty of nooks and crannies, and with Blaise’s assurance he would keep Pansy from bothering them, Draco and Theo sat down after dinner in a shadowy corner to talk.
Draco shoved his shoulder. "Yes," he bit out, Harry positively beaming at him as he snatched at a bread roll. "
He felt clumsy and a little awkward as he pulled out, head catching on the reddened skin of Malfoy’s hole, and pushed back in. And he didn’t care that it was awkward and inexperienced. It felt like salvation, like the culmination of everything, all boiling down to this. His strokes were messy but enthusiastic, and he found a rhythm quickly that pulled little gasping whimpers from Malfoy and made Harry’s veins shiver with want. His awareness of the world around him shrank until the classroom didn’t exist anymore, and nor did the crumbling castle it stood inside or its mourning inhabitants — the only real thing was Malfoy: his warm, yielding body under Harry’s hands, the smell of his hair, the impossible clutch of his arse, the soft noises he made every time Harry filled him.
“You feel like you enjoyed fucking my mouth, Potter,” he said stiffly. “Don’t make it out to be more than it is.”
“I’m in love with him,” Harry said simply, without a trace of humour or guilt or ambivalence. His heart pounded with the admission, for he hadn’t said it out loud since it had occurred to him, but it felt right. It felt
that. Needless to say, she hadn’t appreciated his lashing out, and it had evolved into a full-blown row right in the middle of the Slytherin common room. Blaise, meanwhile, remained civil when Draco spoke to him, but showed no inclination towards spending any time together outside of necessity.
And Harry did, but even when he returned to Gryffindor Tower to find Ron and Ginny still awake and sitting around the fire — even when he joined them, reveling in the comfort and familiarity the company and the atmosphere afforded — he never
Hermione listened attentively, looking shocked sometimes and contemplative other times, but never upset. Never disappointed. It was this that reminded Harry why he’d decided to come to her in the first place.
Harry uses his knuckles instead of the bronze knocker. He waits three minutes, and then five minutes, and then he uses the stupid thing.
with the need to be close to Potter, as physically, intimately close as possible, as if he might disappear again to the Weasleys’ house and leave Draco to his cold, lonely bedroom once again, where the only memory of Potter’s warmth was a faint trace of his smell lingering on Draco’s pillows.
Draco stares at him, sitting with all his complicated emotions, waiting for further explanation that he doesn’t get and doesn’t know how to ask for.
He thought of talking to Hermione about it but decided not to, at least not yet, until he'd spoken to Malfoy first. After another day and then two passed in the same fashion, Harry realised he was going to need to pull some kind of sketchy manoeuvre and quite literally corner him.
, and it was so foreign on that ever-modest face that Draco was startled by the pulse of arousal it provoked.
When they rematerialised, Harry opened his eyes to find that Godric’s Hollow looked different than he remembered. Because of the daylight, probably — or perhaps the absence of looming fear and danger.
They sat in silence for several minutes following this confession, and it was Malfoy who finally broke it.
Of course, that hadn’t been why Draco had done it. He’d chickened out at the last second. He hadn’t stopped ruminating over the things he’d said — the things he’d
“Not sure,” he said, shrugging. “What I do know is that this wand doesn’t feel the same as the Hawthorne one. That one was … special. If I have that, and with some of my new — er — memories, I think I’ll be able to do it now. I really do.”
, made Draco swoon. He hated himself for it, and yet it was intoxicating. When Potter’s mouth finally opened, Draco felt himself respond like he was observing from outside his own body, astounded when the first touch of Potter’s tongue against his own drew a gasp from between his lips. He felt Potter smile in response to this, and for some reason unbeknownst to Draco in that moment, it made his head feel fuzzy with want.
He acquiesced, but even as he forced himself to join in on a conversation with Pansy and Blaise, Draco’s mind never strayed far from Potter. By the end of breakfast, he’d decided he needed to talk to him, and sooner rather than later. Not to apologise —
That he had a heretofore undiscovered willingness to try new things wasn't the only discovery Harry made about Goyle lately — he also realised Draco hadn't been kidding, and that Goyle clearly fancied Daphne Greengrass, whom he stared at just about all the time. She didn't seem to notice; Daphne was usually caught up with Tracey and Lavender and Parvati and often a few other girls as well, all of which giggled over people like Justin Finch-Fletchley and Anthony Goldstein and, to Harry's immense chagrin, himself. It surprised him to find that he felt sort of bad for Goyle, knowing the chances of him landing Daphne Greengrass, who was really quitepretty, were — to put it nicely — slim. Still, watching Gregory Goyle pine after someone gave him an element of humanity he'd been missing since Harry had first met him aboard the Hogwarts Express seven years ago.
They got their bags and swapped out their morning textbooks, and they were halfway to History of Magic when something invisible grabbed Draco’s arm. He stifled a scream, and as soon as he realised he wasn’t imagining it and it hadn’t been another clumsy moron running into him, a thrill of excitement made his body tingle from head to toe.
“Stop fucking with me, Malfoy,” he says into his ear. Draco shudders beneath him. “I’ll win that game.”
He pressed sucking kisses to the skin around his entrance, letting Draco anticipate what he surely knew was coming before finally tensing his tongue and pushing it gently inside his hole. Draco clenched around him, making soft, muffled sounds into his arm and pressing back into the sensation. Harry used his thumbs to keep him open, plunging his tongue in and out and punctuating it with sharp nips to his rim.
The humiliation clings to him all day and it's the first thing he remembers upon waking up Thursday morning.
“Fuck … you like that?” Potter’s voice was raspy, making Draco feel like he might crawl right out of his skin and scream if he were any more turned on. “You want me to fuck that pretty mouth of yours, Malfoy?”
The thought of a sixteen-year-old version of the madman who’d lived in his family home for a year made Draco feel sick to his stomach. How, he wondered vaguely, had Potter survived? Not just physically, but
"You know you can be really despicable sometimes," she says. There's hurt in her eyes, like he's disappointed her. There's no one else in the bloody
Having had quite enough of Harry’s particularly sarcastic brand of wit, he ignored this last and reached for one of his hands, removing it from his own hip and bringing it to his lips. It was extremely satisfying to watch the smirk disappear from Harry’s face when he sucked one of his fingers into his mouth.
to help you understand what’s going on in his head or what he wants. I don’t know him — I don’t know anything
Harry showered and brushed his teeth and got into bed in Andromeda's guest bedroom. He was half-asleep when Draco finally came into the room, took off his clothes, and got in beside him. Even in a strange bed in a home that wasn't theirs, it felt normal.
Theo shouting when we left, so if the whole bloody school doesn’t already know everything, they’re going to
Draco scowls. Harry has a knack for putting him on the spot, probably because he’s figured out it’s the only way to get Draco to talk. What he doesn’t know is that those preposterously green eyes usually have a lot to do with loosening Draco’s tongue.
Blaise’s fist tightened on the pestle for a moment and then he was setting it down on the tabletop, face once again impossible to read. Damn him, but he had his poker-face down to a goddamned art.
He goes to the supply shelf and takes down a vial of murtlap essence, dabbing his burnt hand with it.
It didn’t matter how many years passed since Harry got rid of the Dark Lord, or how long it had been since any
When he was younger, Draco had liked to amuse himself by imagining Potter had a tiny cock, something terribly embarrassing that would make up for all that undeserved fame and attention.
It wasn't until the middle of February that, one evening when most of the common room had filtered off to bed, he came over and stood in front of them, looking lost.
"When I was fucking her, you mean?" he says after a moment. Draco's pulse leaps and he's sure Harry can hear him breathing a little harder. It always takes him by surprise when Harry says things like that, and he imagines it always will. He nods, mostly because he can't find his voice suddenly. "Yeah, I did."
On the other side of the common room, Potter himself is sitting on the sill of one of the larger windows, laughing at something Weasley's saying. He's in his usual worn-looking tee and denims, eyes crinkled with mirth. One hand is wrapped around a box of Bertie Bott's. He keeps throwing the minuscule beans in the air and catching them without looking, utterly absent-minded, before tossing them deftly into his mouth.
Even Ron and Hermione — whose given names Draco had started using, Merlin help him — tried to convince him to attend the party in the Gryffindor common room afterwards, but Draco declined. It was with no ill will — he would never have begrudged Harry that celebration, and yet had no desire whatsoever to participate himself. The Gryffindors had actually begun getting used to Draco’s presence in their common room, but it still felt intrusive to be there when they were celebrating something so …
An hour later, settled into their familiar spots in front of the fire in the Gryffindor common room, Harry and Ron were trying to describe what had happened to Hermione so she could figure out what hex had been used.
!” he exclaimed hoarsely, eyes bulging in his head. An ancient-looking elf had appeared in the centre of the room, its skin so loose it seemed to be sagging right off its bones, but two clean, bright-white tufts of hair sprouted from its ears and its enormous eyes shone with the sort of happiness that somehow erased any physical unpleasantness. There was also, quite strangely, a rather large golden locket dangling from its scrawny neck.
at his new genitalia, let alone thinking about becoming aroused. And yet he’d been unable to escape the fact earlier that he
The feeling of that thick shaft piercing into him every time Harry pulled him relentlessly down onto it sent him into an orgasm within less than a minute, and Harry didn’t stop even though he surely felt Draco squirting all over his lap.
As they were passing Flitwick’s classroom in the Charms corridor, Harry saw students filing out the door with sour looks on their faces, and given that it was eighth-year Slytherins and Ravenclaws, he ascertained he would be wearing a similar expression when he left Charms tomorrow sagging under what he was certain would be another mountain of homework.
“I don’t … I don’t understand,” she said weakly. Draco bit his lip, wondering whether this had been a horrible,
After a couple seconds where Ron traced a finger around the rim of his glass and seemed to be working himself up to something, he finally said, “Do you remember the Mirror of Erised?”
He throws another hex and Potter blocks it, and then another, and another, sweating with effort, and somewhere in between them Potter gets in one of his own that knocks Draco off his feet. As he’s walking over — presumably to help Draco up, since he’s
After dinner, while Narcissa and Andromeda spent some time alone together, Harry and Draco took Teddy out in the backyard to play in the grass. It was a gorgeous night that still clung to summer, not even a hint of autumn in the air, and it smelled like the honeysuckle that was choking the yard. Teddy ambled around on his fat legs, tripping often and requiring Harry to run around after him helping him up. Draco seemed to like watching this.
"Yes," said Draco. "She showed up to take me to her home when I was released, I'd never even met her before. I only knew because she —"
“Can you do it?” he asks. He forces himself to keep eye contact with her; it’s uncomfortable to reveal the depth of his feelings for Harry, but he’s not ashamed of it, and he won’t act like he is. “I figured — you’re an Unspeakable — you might know of some way …”
With those words left ringing inside Draco’s head, Weasley finally left for good. And Draco, who would now be too late to go to class, returned to his dormitory to begin an internal debate.
One of England’s Chasers, Nerissa Murray, hosted a celebration at the enormous flat she shared with her girlfriend, and it was here that Harry was finally able to get Malfoy alone.
.” And to Harry’s utter astonishment, he saw that Malfoy’s steely grey eyes were now swimming with unshed tears. He dragged his arm across them almost defiantly, like even
go away? His face was getting hotter every second, and to make matters worse, the smell of Harry was making him unbearably randy. “Just an observation, that’s all.”
!” Draco broke off on a moan when Harry’s hand cupped him suddenly through his trousers, pressing up against his needy cunt.
he received the Kiss. Because if one thing was certain, it was that Potter would not be making a second trip to the Ministry to fight on the behalf of another Death Eater.
“All right.” Harry set his bottle down on the grass and pulled out his wand, motioning for Draco to do the same. “Let’s do it, then. Let’s try again.”
Ron was surprised but seemed relatively pleased to see Draco when he came out to the pitch to watch them fly, and the same went for Hermione when they all went inside later.
It was then that they also made a final decision: after the Hogwarts Express took them back to London tomorrow for the last time, Draco would go with him to Grimmauld Place.
“Yeah, you wish,” Harry laughed, and this brought a lovely, carefree smile onto her face that Harry never tired of seeing these days. Sometimes he even dared to believe those seemingly permanent dark circles under her eyes were beginning to fade away. “I had trouble sleeping last night. Didn’t feel like being in bed anymore, I guess.”
of such a thing, a hex that can change someone’s sex. It’s possible, of course, that it’s only Malfoy’s bone structure that’s changed, you know, I mean, I can’t possibly imagine there’s a spell in the
“Malfoy, I’m …” Potter choked out, his hips stuttering, clearly getting close. And while Draco had an inkling that Saint Potter was warning him so that Draco could pull off in time, Draco had no intention of doing anything of the sort. He wanted it. Merlin help him, he wanted it
Gryffindor — give me a break. If you were nearly sorted into Slytherin then I’m a Hufflepuff. And I am
“You really are incredible,” said Draco, biting back a moan as two of those dexterous fingers slipped inside of him. Harry fucked him with them slowly, carefully, seeking out his prostate and angling for it each time once he’d found it. Draco turned his face to press his forehead against the door, eyes still closed, nails scraping wood. “And I like that song.”
He led him over to the bed and Draco climbed on, hands going to his flies. Harry helped him out of the rest of his clothes and spread his legs, but for now he ignored his arse. Instead he bent over and laved his tongue over Draco's cock, making him arch and keen.
“Draco, does it have to do with Harry?” she says abruptly. Draco pauses with his cup in the air and blinks at her. “I thought so,” she goes on. “He hasn’t said it but I know you two have been fighting again. I can always tell because that truly boundless sarcasm of his reaches new heights, it’s so annoying. It gets to the point I can’t figure out when he’s being serious.” There’s thunder in her expression suddenly and Draco forces himself not to laugh. “D’you know he had dinner with Ron and me the other night and I asked him if he’d done anything really interesting in training yet, because he’s mostly been so bored with it lately, you know? And he tells me yes, something interesting finally happened, that two of the other trainees propositioned him for a threesome and he had to turn them down, and it wasn’t until the next day when I brought it up again that he told me he was joking, like I should’ve known. I mean, it’s out of control.”
The night is pleasantly cool and heavy with the scent of autumn: pumpkin and decaying leaves and somewhere in the distance, a campfire. Harry’s balcony is bewitched so that even though they can see the people on the footway some thirty feet below, laughing and talking and sipping steaming drinks, those people cannot see them. If they looked up, all they would see is an empty balcony.
“I was taking the piss, Potter,” he said, still not looking at him, feeling his blush creep down his neck and wishing he could just
“Very funny,” Draco drawled, and it struck him as endlessly amusing that they were capable of slipping into this familiar banter regardless of the situation. Harry must have been struck by it in the same way, because he was grinning in spite of his words. “Some time this century would be spectacular.”
,” Potter said, opening the bottle and taking a swig. He grimaced and handed the last of it over to Draco. “If I’d hand my wand in my hand rather than over
, Malfoy. Not the way they looked. It’s the same with you — he likes the way you make him feel. Not the way you look.”
“You told him I was your boyfriend,” Harry whispered, pulling back only enough so their eyes could meet. He could still feel Harry’s breath ghost across his lips. “Is that what you want?”
And then Harry was kissing him again, the salty taste of tears heavy on his tongue when Harry sucked it into his mouth. Draco melted into the distraction gratefully.
She’d been a saving grace during this whole thing, that much was undeniable. She might not have been all that helpful to talk to, but she
Quiet, introverted, and exasperatingly intelligent, Theodore Nott had never been one to stumble over his words, but least of all to say something so utterly and unbearably
He pulled out of the dive perhaps five feet from the ground in a manoeuvre that would have sent the stands into wild fits of cheering and Harry smiled just thinking about it, knowing that it was only ever during a Quidditch match that he
There was a spell they could perform. He would bleed heavily for about a week, and it would kill the fetus. Another week after that, they could administer the potion.
Harry hesitated. Ron gave him no reprieve; he merely stared, unforgiving, waiting for an answer Harry was so clearly desperate to avoid giving.
Harry rolled his eyes, but it wasn’t without a pleased grin. It was the first time he’d heard Malfoy make any sort of joke about the situation that wasn’t dark or scathing — self-deprecating, yes, but it wasn’t as angry as it might have been even a few days ago.
"It was a really decent thing to do," Ron explained when both Harry and Draco had given him amused looks. "He gets it, Goyle does. These essays are rubbish."
Their make-up seventh year has been like that so far: boring. Most of the time Draco has the sense to appreciate boredom over — you know, perpetual terror. Other times he feels so understimulated he starts resorting to things like stealing from Slughorn’s locked ingredients cupboard to make complicated, illicit potions, or writing long-winded theses on the mutable properties of moonstone, or … bugging Potter. That last is the most fun, obviously. Or it would be if it ever worked.

And then the thick head was pressing against his hole, stretched on just two fingers, and god, he was being
“Can I ask you something?” Potter’s voice ripped Draco almost violently out of his pessimistic musings. He turned to him owlishly, Draco’s eyes scanning Potter’s face before landing on that bright, mesmerising green and stopping there. “Why haven’t you asked me for your wand back?”
It seemed to Harry that he should have been able to see its shape beneath the skin of his chest, for it felt as though it had begun taking flying leaps in an attempt at escape.
“Okay, okay, okay!” Ron held his hands up in surrender, shuddering a bit and prompting another laugh from Harry. “Spare me the details, all I needed was a yes or no.”
“Yes,” Draco breathed, too mortified to make it any louder. Without any knickers on underneath his pyjama bottoms, the insides of his thighs were growing slick and wet with arousal.

“S’pose he’s right, though, isn’t he?” he said miserably, slumping back against his seat. “It’s me and Malfoy. We were gonna fight sooner or later.”
, though. I don't think anyone else is gonna use an Unforgivable on you, but still. It's getting a bit out of control, Malfoy."
“Brought you some pumpkin juice,” he said, handing over a bottle. “Nearly brought you a butterbeer again.”
He couldn’t have said whether whatever Potter was doing was proper form, for he had nothing to compare it to, but Draco didn’t need a reference point to know that tongue was relentlessly good. He alternated sucking Draco’s clit into his mouth with tonguing gently, teasingly around it, spending a lot of time laving over his labia, which were now swollen with blood, much the same as his stiff, throbbing clit. He could feel his
"You can't be serious, Potter!" Goyle yelled furiously. "You know he wouldn't! He was talking to me the whole time, that crazy bint's only hearing what she wants to hear!"

been absorbed in the film apparently, lets out a soft gasp that makes Harry painfully hard for him. He takes the choker between his teeth again and now Draco actually whines, shoving at Harry lightly.
“So, tell me, then, Potter. Besides a secret fetish for Slytherin arse, what is it you’d like me to know about you?”
She scooped up her book and, looking stubbornly determined, crossed the common room to where Malfoy was sitting. Harry and Ron both turned to watch, as did a few other people who'd noticed. Malfoy himself looked up only when Hermione actually sat down in the chair next to him, and he startled so badly Harry saw him drop his quill. Harry wondered privately whether this wasn't simply Hermione's way of trying to engage him, Potions being a very convenient excuse.
“Harry, stop!” Draco exclaimed, tugging at his arm and successfully pulling him back a foot, although Harry’s murderous glare never moved from Theo’s face.
Retrospectively, Draco knew that even eleven years after the fact, Halloween night had remained synonymous with the first fall of the Dark Lord in Lucius Malfoy’s eyes.
"So you decided that these things you feel you can't talk to him about, they outweighed the rest of it?"

“I see. Well …” She still looked a bit conflicted, eyeing him and then putting her hand on the doorknob. “All right. I’ll tell him you’re here, anyway, but he was really hurt, Malfoy. I don’t know if he’ll want to hear it.”
"Harry —" he starts, but Harry kisses him quiet and takes his hand off them, reaching around instead to Draco's arse and sliding his fingers over Draco's clenching hole. They're sticky and wet where they probe at him and Harry still manages to be gentle even when he foregoes just one finger, pressing in with two and burying them completely. Draco, who feels short of breath, digs his nails into Harry's shoulders and kisses him. It stings a little — he hasn't had sex in over two months, since two days before he'd shouted Harry out of his flat with furious tears in his eyes and a cruel assertion that he was miserable in this relationship — but he likes the sting, likes to have some sort of physical manifestation, some
instead of the other way round.” Whatever retort had been ready on Harry’s tongue died at these words, an iron band clamping down around his heart. There were, he saw, tears shimmering in Hermione’s eyes. “I knew if we told you what had happened you’d lose your mind trying to figure out who it was, and you’ve … you’ve been so unhappy, Harry … when Ron told me he thought he might’ve convinced Malfoy to talk to you …” She wiped beneath her eye, where a fat tear had rolled down onto her cheek. Having been wholly unprepared for this turn of events, Harry watched Hermione with a helpless feeling in his limbs.
To his credit, Weasley controlled the expressions that passed across his face. They were still there, but subdued. First shock, then disbelief. Shock again. His mouth opened and closed. More shock, and finally, some strange sort of tentative acceptance. “The Healers told you this?”
Twisting Potter’s hand a bit, Draco was finally able to make the words out. It sent a jolt of nausea through him.
He sits down next to Draco on the floor. He says nothing, only meets Draco’s eyes when he looks at him.
” cleaning them both of Potter’s mess, and the one Draco had left on Potter’s face. Potter tucked himself back into his jeans and did them back up, then grabbed for his glasses.
"Oh, I hate feeling sorry for people I don't like," said Hermione miserably. Ron put an arm across her shoulders and she leaned into him. Harry thought of the way he'd felt when Dumbledore had first begun introducing him to Tom Riddle's past and knew exactly what Hermione meant.
"That," Harry said, "and I just think it'd be really good to pick a name that doesn't have anything to do with whatever gender it ends up being. I mean, what's that got to do with anything?"
how she'd found out). He left only after Draco assured him he would get dressed and come to his office immediately, and even squeezed Draco’s shoulder in a gesture that was apparently supposed to be fatherly but ended up being nothing more than severely awkward.
The night of Christmas Eve came, and with it Harry’s mind wandered to a small parcel stored in his rucksack upstairs, beside his camp bed in Ron’s room. While Ron and Ginny had been called by Mrs Weasley to help with dinner, Harry pulled Hermione aside and showed her the necklace he’d gotten in Hogsmeade, with the miniature Snitch which, like a real one, would respond only to the first person to touch it. It was encased in glass like a fossil might have been, and would, according to the saleswitch, melt away at the tap of a wand. He told Hermione all of this and she put a hand to her heart.
to know. Now I won’t have to spend my life wondering whether he ever really loved me as more than an asset. I know he didn’t.”
it anymore, not with the mind healing — these days he wanted it simply because he enjoyed it, and Harry did too.
