"Thank you. I know you're mad at me…"
You do
"Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays," Fred sing-songed with a wide grin.
The stone hallway was dark and cold. The gentle slap, slap, of bare feet echoed softly. Breathing hard with anticipation, he could almost hear the ecstatic beat of his heart as the chained stone door loomed closer. As before, lust rose in him and he caressed the door possessively. Demon's chill laughter answered as before, but this time, it wasn't the only response.
They stepped off the stairs at the bottom and found themselves in a dungeon corridor, complete with torches set in brackets and black soot staining the wall above the yellow flames.
"But then the magical community got too close to the Muggles through the Muggleborns and that mess with the Muggles happened." Rowena sighed sadly, her eyes gazing into the distance. Salazar snorted at her while Draco looked almost desperately hopeful once again. "So much of our knowledge was lost and we were scattered for awhile. By the time the magical community had reestablished itself, there was a fear of Muggles and it translated to Muggleborns since many had forgotten or ignored why Muggleborns were so important in the first place."
Seraphim whirled and watched as four older teenagers stepped out of the shadows. They wore black and had sliver chains for belts and hanging from their pockets. Silver glinted in their lips and eyebrows. Dark makeup lined their eyes and their hair was spiked, the tips pink and blue. Seraphim felt his magic rise around him, pushing at the ten-foot limit, but unable to go past it.
"That's exactly how it is," Shadow countered, glaring. "Don't deny it. You've said it yourself. You deemed me still too sick. You wanted to protect me. That can't go on. I'm telling you right now. If I can't trust you to be completely honest and upfront with me concerning my condition and recovery, I will have to find a new doctor."
"Well, gee, I haven't been called that for a while," Corey said thoughtfully, rubbing his chin. He grinned down at the fuming Slytherin. "Brings back some good memories."
"That's probably for the best," Draco said softly, eyes on the very tense Shadow. "Seraphim probably wouldn't appreciate you hanging around. He doesn't trust people very easily."
"Shadow is fine. He's just exhausted and needs a few hours of sleep. The procedure was a success. The scar has been moved."
"I'm also Harry Potter. Shadow's history is fabricated, but it's not a complete lie. Severus adopted me this summer and we went through the Adoption Ritual that shared his blood with mine."
The weekend before Halloween, Shadow and Draco went down to Severus's quarters. Salazar was done making adjustments to Boy's mind after having to start over after the fiasco with Umbridge and the boggart. The alter was now ready for some positive interaction. Salazar coached Draco to try to get the alter talking about anything as long as it was a conversation. The key was to be patient and calm. Draco could never appear angry or violent in Boy's eyes or it would shatter the faint acceptance Boy had formed for another human being, possibly for good.
"No…" Draco murmured, distracted as the darker, golden skin of Harry's chest was laid bare. He bent forward and licked along the collarbone, up the shorter neck. "Taste the same… Feel the same…" His fingers quickly unbuttoned his pants, thanking Merlin that he hadn't bothered with underwear this morning. Skin on skin, Draco thrust firmly but gently against Harry's warm, soft stomach. "Soooo gooood," he practically slurred.
"We know for sure there are at least twenty-seven Death Eaters missing, but we cannot be certain they haven't been recruiting all this time," Minerva said solemnly as she looked around the room. "We will most likely be outnumbered, but we have the element of surprise. I want you to capture as many Death Eaters as you can. If you can't capture them, kill them. The first priority is to rescue Severus Snape and any other prisoners we may come across. Our second priority is to look for any information pertaining to Harry Potter. Retreat if things get too hot. I don't want any casualties. Understood?"
"You're not listening." Luna stomped her foot. "This isn't about you. This is about Neville right now."
Remus met her eyes steadily. ”It means that Neville will most likely still feel extremely anxious and fearful even though he is now free. His first emotional reaction to things is going to be fear for a while. He'll most likely have trust issues as well. It seems that the Death Eaters played some serious psychological games with him, trying to make him think they were the good guys and we were the bad guys. He's going to be messed up, but we'll get him through it. He's very strong."
Neville closed his eyes and took a deep breath. The idea of going before the Wizengamot frightened him, but the idea that Shadow could be hurt was worse. Shadow was the first person to see his pain, the first person to reach out to him. No one understood the impact that had on him.
"I… I just want to go home," Neville rasped, broken.
"We're going to finish this conversation later, Nev," Ginny told him firmly, her brown eyes capturing his. "Okay?"
"Did Sirius just adopt him?" Shadow asked, trying to distract himself.
The twins shared a glance and spoke as one. "Sorry, mate.”
"I don't know, Draco," Shadow drawled with mock concern. "I've heard they've upped their practices and have gotten a lot better. Chang is at the top of her game and the Keeper is tough to get past. Plus the whole school will be cheering for them."
"I'm sorry," Emmeline said regretfully. "China won't cooperate. We've tried every angle. I even requested permission to send someone to look physically. Unless Harry tells us specifically where he is or comes back on his own, we can't reach him."
"The first is this: People always find it easier to deal with problems that are not their own. The second is somewhat harder to accept. You cannot make anyone love you, and conversely you cannot stop someone from loving you."
"The Dark Lord made six Horcruxes," Harry said with complete honesty.
Shadow acknowledged and was once again reminded that this man always beat him at chess.
"Seraphim," Severus tried again. "I've come to take you somewhere warm. There will be food and no one will hurt you there."
Severus merely stared at them.
They made their way back to the bedroom. Seraphim shut the door and pulled the dresser in front of it. No one would get in while he slept. Draco stared at the dresser in consternation. How was he going to sneak out to talk to Severus now? But that was forgotten as Seraphim took his hand and led him to the bed. He felt his heart pick up speed and stared as Seraphim sat and tugged for him to do the same.
Salazar opened his mouth to respond, his face dark as a thundercloud, but Severus quickly intervened. "As enlightening as your different perspectives are, I'd appreciate an explanation of the situation before we debate which of you has a more valid view."
"I found these," Lucius said sweetly, gesturing gracefully. "Do they belong to you? One doesn't look so good."
"I can be disguised. And it's not like you're not wanted by those fools, either!" Sirius protested, scowling at them.
"No. I've been focusing on protecting the students."
Rogan stared open-mouthed as Shadow offered the crazy Ravenclaw a seat at the kitchen table with them. Miles and Lillian answered their friend's questioning gaze with shrugs. Luna smiled at Shadow, her blue eyes never moving from his face. Rogan doubted the girl even realized they were there.
woman was yelling something and banging on the door. Demon smiled, imagining killing them all, killing every human in this godforsaken world, and then destroying the world itself just to make sure the plagued species didn't come back to torment him and his Boy.
"Looks like we've been really lucky.” Shadow grinned. "The set-up with the twins worked like a charm, too. Rogan and his neutral, anti-Dark Lord group have accepted me. They'll open the way to others."
"You looked at me then with this
"I haven't seen it, but I'll keep my eyes open."
"I believe you," Charlie soothed. "But what kind of things did they ask?"
Noting this, Severus continued down the street. Most people didn't glance at them. Those that did, noted them and continued on. Only two people lingered to watch them pass. One of these was Cassandra Pucey, a soon to be 6th year Slytherin.
Remus let him leave, hoping he had gotten through to the teen.
Draco swung out, trying to keep Shadow away from him.
… Shadow sat up with a gasp that quickly turned into something else. He turned so that his head hung over the edge of the bed and vomited. The smell made him retch again. Sweating, whimpering, he crawled away to the other side of the bed.
"I wondered that myself." Severus hooked his hair behind his ear and leaned back, crossing his legs thoughtfully. "I spoke to Salazar and we theorize that because Demon was born from Voldemort he felt the Dark Lord's death. The shock of it rendered him unconscious, so to speak."
"What's up?" Fred asked groggily. George helped him sit up.
the teachers to disguise the fact that Umbridge was the real target. Plus, Severus wanted to examine anything they got out of Carrow's office, hoping it could give him a way to get at the vicious woman. The best part was, no one would suspect that they did anything. Everyone would think the twins had done it so they could have things to sell while they lived on the run.
be there, to
"Merlin," Draco groaned, hoarse and barely hanging on to his sanity, "
"So. What was that about earlier?" Shadow drawled after they slid down the slide.
"I don't know," the other man muttered and said something too quietly to hear. Shadow turned his head just enough to be able to read his lips.
Umbridge smiled out at them with honest delight. "These are very special quills. They are Blood Quills, cursed to bind a silencing spell to your blood to prevent you from speaking about them to anyone. You will do your lines - all one hundred - or the quill will write them for you…" She paused for effect. "…Double the amount I have assigned."
"Lion!" Boy said, louder, actually smiling.
"Sunlight. It causes skin irritation and often a rash. Direct sunlight will begin to burn the skin. It's a similar condition to what the vampires suffer," the mediwitch told her.
"Will you help me?" Draco was already looking back at the book, his finger moving again.
"About this dark and light plane," he prompted.
But the cold was what really hurt him, not the warmth. Warmth was good. It was all he had been able to think about for hours and hours as the snow and ice bit at him. It was what would make the pain stop. So why did it hurt? Confused, afraid to stay curled up with the flashbacks, he crawled out of his hole and into the sun. It stung and he cried. Why did it have to hurt him, too? Everything hurt him. Even the cold and the sun. There were no people and still it hurt. The magic was gone.
"Shadow?" Draco asked carefully, trying to establish eye contact.
"We shall see," Minerva laughed. She stood and gestured for Severus to precede her out of her room. "Why don't we go to the kitchen for a bite to eat? There is an Order meeting in an hour. It will be good to have you there. We need all the help we can get."
"Ron… I don't understand…"
He had never seen anything like it. One was a white-orange reef - the color of hot metal - and the other was bruise-purple. The first represented rage, the other represented ear and despair. From each reef, a single branch coiled upward into the conscious. These had a few fish swimming around them indicating that the mind did have a sense of these emotions in an elementary way.
"Well, there's something I've wanted to tell you for a while, but I wasn't sure how to say it, but it's about time it got said." Shadow could have hit himself. He sounded like an idiot! “First, I need to ask you to agree to a Wizard's Oath not to reveal to anyone what I'm about to tell you."
stability in his emotions, in his mind. As much as he hated to admit it, the therapy
"They're in a state of emergency. All Apprentices are to remain at home until further notice," Tonks said, sounding like she was quoting something. "Any new information?"
Septima walked into Ancient Runes silently. Her hazel eyes scanned the room. There were nine students, all Third-years except for Shadow Snape whom she had come to see. It wasn't hard to find the boy. He was different from his peers. It was in his body language and his strange eyes. A maturity and an intensity that even the older students didn't have.
Not getting an answer, he painfully sat up. Severus was quick to brace him. Harry took the robe Sirius handed him. Severus had already pulled on the one Remus provided. Harry was just tying the sash when he noticed everyone was staring at him. He looked up at Draco and shivered at the intense look in the blond's stormy eyes.
"Come on!" he cried and tugged at Luna's free hand.
"Godric!" Shadow hissed and allowed his arm to drop. "What do you think you're doing? What time is it?"
George said carefully, "We need to find Shadow."
"I think it will be fine.” Remus smiled gently at his charge. "He still needs to recover and any food we can get into him is a good thing."
Another hour later, at what felt like two thirty in the morning, all the Slytherins were exhausted. Shadow had them all sit in a semi-circle cross-legged in front of him. Draco joined the circle, also wanting to learn how to Occlude. Shadow took a deep breath and remembered how Severus had taught him. He vividly recalled the feel of Severus's mind, the soothing waves, the breathing exercises, and the sense of finding his center once he figured out what they were doing. It was the most incredible feeling and the memories of those lessons were some of his best.
Shutting the book, he forced himself to stop thinking about it. He'd deal with Lockhart later and enjoy it, getting worked up about it now wasn't productive. Taking deep, calming breaths, Draco closed his eyes and, when he opened them again, they returned to their normal light grey instead of dark and stormy.
"Shhh, you're okay. No one's going to hurt you. You're safe," Draco was murmuring in his ear.
"How'd you know I was the Slytherin representative?" Rogan asked, frowning. Only one member of the DA from each House was excused from signing the Secrecy Scroll. Shadow had been the Slytherin representative, but when he didn't come back this term, someone else had to take that position.
It was good to finally be home.
"Yes?" he asked, turning to see McNair shifting nervously behind him.
"Whatever Shadow decides, I'm sure will be best. Neither of you will let him down," Severus drawled. His black eyes measured Neville and the Gryffindor swallowed hard, going pale.
Draco laughed and fetched the robe.
in there."
"It seems to me that you've listed very good qualities. If you happen to meet such a person, why would you refuse them?"
After that disastrous Monday, Shadow was more withdrawn than ever before. He still did his homework and ran the DA meetings, but he was distant and pensive. People began to notice and worry.
Severus appeared, coming to search for the cause of his class' absence. Ron was just getting to his feet and looked deeply shaken. Blood coated his mouth and chin from his split lip and what looked to be a broken nose. His cheek was already swelling. Neville stood panting, still obviously furious, and was glaring at the redhead from within the two sets of restraining arms.
Shadow gasped, spinning around with his hand clutched over his racing heart. "Don't
Thursday found Shadow and Draco slipping into Rogan's room instead of attending the DA meeting. They were worried that Carrow's subdued behavior in class and in the halls meant that she was even worse in private. They'd slipped out of the Chamber while everyone else was at dinner to lessen the chance of being caught, but now they had nothing to do but wait for the Slytherins to return.
"So what do we do?" Draco asked, biting his lip in an uncharacteristic display of fear. What if Shadow never forgave him for not telling him about his eyes? What if Shadow used this stupid fight to push him away?
Draco stared into the green eyes of his friend and could almost feel the alter's guilt and sorrow. He'd had no idea just how much Seraphim worried about him. "I'm fine," he promised. He reached to wiped away the teen's tears without thinking and dropped his hand when the alter flinched away. "Really, Seph. I'm not hurt."
Immediately, Neville flushed bright red with fury. He leapt to his feet and grabbed her by the shoulders. "You won't tell anyone!"
A thick thread of glowing orange light snaked from Severus's wand and wound around their hands.
Severus and Remus were standing behind Harry to either side of Draco like good bodyguards. Both of them were under Polyjuice. Severus was a tall, blonde muscle head, while Remus was an older black man. They couldn't have picked disguises that looked more different if they'd tried, but both had a readiness in their posture that said they weren't to be messed with.
"Oh put a sock in it, Snivellus," Sirius scowled. The only thing keeping him in his seat was Remus' firm grip holding him down.
"Wait here for a minute, Hedwig? I'll be back with your reply shortly."
? Where had Severus
Seraphim paced and agitatedly ran his hands through his hair. Draco watched him silently. Every attempt at conversation Draco made was brushed off or met with a silent stare. Seraphim continued to pace, stopping to check the door several times. Once he even took a few practice swings with his knife. He calmed a bit when time passed and still no threat presented itself.
"I'm here… It's all right now," Neville said hopelessly. He grabbed his brother into a tight embrace and clawed onto the last of his self-control. Not yet, he couldn't break down yet.
Draco shook his head. He was supposed to plunge the fang down. Pierce the locket. He had to.
"My intention was not to lay my burden on your shoulders. It is in the past," Severus said softly. His emotions were gone and in their place was the open pool that had been such a comfort to Shadow in the past. "I am honored to have a second chance as a father. Thank you, Shadow."
"Thank you, Ginny," Shadow said warmly. "I know how hard that was, but you've really helped. We might have a chance now."
"Yay!" Marissa cheered and rushed toward the table.
Remus was bending over the still form on the rumbled bed. Severus stood at Remus’s back, peering over his shoulder. He was standing so rigidly that Draco thought he'd fall over if anyone pushed on his shoulder. Sirius was standing beside Draco, his presence somehow reminding him of the Pureblood standards of behavior and comforting him at the same time. Reluctantly, his eyes drifted to the last person in the room, dreading what he'd see.
Shadow felt tears burning his cheeks. No one had ever believed so strongly in him before. It was humbling and comforting. Maybe… just maybe… he could still play this off. If he could just pull himself together, he could test what Severus really thought about boys being together and still protect the secret he had been keeping for so long.
"Severus!" Draco said sharply. He grabbed Sirius hard by the shoulders. "Did he contact you? Did he say something about Shadow?"
"You couldn't find any weak points to hit?" Minerva asked.
Goyle raised his wand. "
"You fucking bastard," he hissed furiously. "You're fucked up, you know that? You're a fucking COWARD!"
He was further pleased when McGonagall seemed to immediately take his advice and move several feet backward. Seraphim relaxed marginally and edged backward as well, his wing still extended to force Draco backward. Since this was what he wanted, he moved readily. Seraphim didn't turn his back on McGonagall once. In fact, he didn't turn around until they were down the stairs and back on the second floor. Seraphim then turned and hurried back toward the entrance of the Chamber.
"The angel came and took me away. Mama and Papa are okay, right, Draco?" Marissa asked tearfully from behind Shadow, fear rising in her high voice like a wave as the words finally spilled free. "The angel took me away because he loves me. 'Cause God loves His children. God sent an angel for me, so I don't have'ta be hurted no more. Mama and Papa… They'll be happier without me there to get in the way. So they don't mind that the angel came to get me, right? The angel made me better. It didn't hurt anymore at all! And he… and he… He wants me. I felt it! He saved me and loves me so much. Mama and Papa don't mind, right, Draco? Shadow? They won't be mad? The angel won't leave me?"
"And he made you drink the potion?" Draco hissed, horrified.
Sirius leapt agilely over a pile of, what was in his opinion, crap. The maneuver would have been impressive if his trouser leg wasn't smoking due to the fiendfyre that he'd cast and had now gotten out of control. In front of him, Shadow was battling the Bloody Baron with flashy spells over a statue that was wearing a surprisingly plain looking diadem. The smoke was making things confused, which was good because they had an audience they hadn't expected.
again.
"Let them sleep," Shadow argued, getting to his feet.
anything? What the fuck was this interrogation all about then?"
The three wizards hurried after the goblin. At the end of a short tunnel, they came to another golden door. Bogrod gracefully spilled the Clankers into his palm. The four large golden disks glinted in the torchlight. Bogrod threw them up as he placed his free palm against the vault door. The disks clanked and clanged as they jumbled around each other.
"I'm prepared to help as much as I can," Draco answered, bowing in respect.
"I'm hardly power hungry!" Draco yelled, deeply insulted. "But even if I were, at least I'm not a bloody coward!"
Draco looked away again, making a third sandwich. "I can't really describe it. It was… frightening at first. The transformation is painful. He was frightened and screaming, but when it was complete… He was completely animal-like, intense, you know?" He brushed his bangs from his face nervously. "He has these huge white wings, beautiful but tragic. Some feathers are mangled and there's dry blood and old wounds on them. His eyes are so… wild and intense," he repeated lamely.
But Neville was not only Earth. He was also human. He was also a brother. His human mind knew the source of this magic and could not accept the Truth of the Earth. He staggered as he transformed from tree back to boy. It was painful. He hated the limits of this body. Hated its vulnerability and singleness. He ignored everything else and walked forward into the destroyed clearing.
"No. He told them they went off on their own, trusting nobody. It's not so unbelievable for Professor Snape to do such a thing." Remus smiled wryly, his eyes darkening to brown once more. "They questioned Draco more vigorously than they did Sirius, actually. It's not so far fetched for Siri to be clueless, but they expected Draco to know what's happening around him. They wanted to know everything they could about Shadow's transformation, his adoption, and any future plans they had made."
Draco swallowed hard, not sure what to say. "I overheard Greengrass talking to Bulstrode about Professor Firenze wanting to speak to Shadow and grew curious, so I went to see for myself. When I got there, the professor was holding Shadow's face and saying something. Shadow was upset. We went down to the Chamber together, but before he told me anything about what Professor Firenze wanted Longbottom showed up. He followed us to tell us Black had news. Weaselette followed
Draco stirred and opened his eyes. He felt sleepy still and suspected Professor Snape's healing draught had been mixed with sleep inducing ingredients. He turned over languidly, only to freeze, eyes going wide. Shadow stood beside his bed, looking down at him. He was sweaty and disheveled, but it was the look in his blue and green eyes that arrested him. They were utterly devastated. Draco sat up quickly, blushing with shame.
Seraphim scowled. "You brought me here!"
"Sounds good." Neville grinned and followed his brother outside.
"Good." Sirius twirled his wand around his fingers.
Alice stared at him, sobs making her shake. "Th-thank you."
Umbridge was walking to breakfast, still coldly furious about the week and a half she had been forced to remain in her quarters because someone
"Because that's not what they feel. You know that," Remus rebuked lightly. He gently ran his hands through Neville's thick, wavy brown hair, soothing him. "Could you stop kissing Ginny? Holding her? Getting to know her mind, body, and soul? She's not just your friend. You're in love with her."
Amalia literally jumped up and down with joy as she watched Tabby pull herself into a shaky crawling position for the first time.
"I think this group is important. It might even save our lives one day," Hermione said firmly. "Harry's getting training and so should we. If you can't deal with working with everyone here, then leave now. Those of us who are taking this seriously want to learn and don't have time to mess around."
Trembling, Seraphim pulled the drapes closed on the broken window, hoping it would keep the heat in. He moved over to the couch and pulled the blanket there around his shoulders. He staggered to the kitchen and grabbed a hand towel, wrapping up his hand. He basically collapsed into a chair at the kitchen table and cried out with relief as he got off his painful feet.
"This cloak should have disintegrated…" Griphook rasped in Harry's ear. Green eyes shifted to look over his shoulder at the goblin. Seeing the astounded expression on the goblin's face, he shrugged lightly. Griphook shook himself. The cloak wasn't important. They had a treasure to steal.
It was true, even if he couldn't deal with Draco and Shadow being together yet.
"You wanted to speak to me?" Shadow prompted.
"I don't know…"
The young boy's face paled, but he maintained his Slytherin mask.
"Was he doing things he had done before or is something new happening?"
Draco ran his hands through his hair with a sigh, knowing she was right, but that didn't change the fact he was busy. "We're really trying to figure this thing out, sweetie." He gestured to the damned snitch sitting innocently on the table in front of him.
Marissa followed happily since Shadow was creeping along and she thought it was another game. Shadow put a finger over his lips and winked at her.
"I had to lick it up. It burned and came back up again." The alter flinched, remembering that moment as if it happened yesterday. He ducked his head, hiding behind his dark, wavy bangs. "I'm sorry. Sorry, Uncle…" Crying now, Seraphim shook his head. "He stomped on me. Stomped again and again. Hurt.
happened to him. Kingsley described the teen's eyes turning an inhuman, killing-curse green and then displaying superhuman speed, strength, and phenomenal magical strength. Shadow also seemed not to recognize anyone and showed great antipathy toward everyone except Draco and Severus. He even flung Neville away, injuring him in the process, and it was well known that Shadow and Neville were close.
love me, you stupid prat!"
"It's no problem." Shadow smiled happily around at them. "I need the practice as much as you guys. See you tomorrow."
Draco and
Draco laughed and brought his hand up, cradling the back of Shadow's head. He was still shaking, but the absolute disgust slowly spilled from him as Shadow held him tight. "Thank Merlin."
"No. They are correct." Severus placed his hand on his son's shoulder.
Seraphim screeched at seeing the creature and attacked it with his bare hands. Omi screamed and disappeared, leaving Seraphim to fall to the floor.
"I'm fine," Harry answered automatically and grinned when Severus snorted. Sighing, he closed his eyes again. Confronting these things was always so much better in the dark. He was shocked to discover how desperately he wanted to talk about some things with his father, to have him help him work things out in his own head. "I'm a mess."
"Draco's missing. What if the Slytherins don't come now?" Neville frowned. "It was important that we all work together."
Shadow pushed him playfully. "Egotistical much?"
Shadow guessed that they had picked one speaker so as to prevent him from feeling ganged up on. Too late, he thought ruefully. "Fourteen," he answered evenly.
my fucking business!" Draco yelled back, silver eyes flashing.
"That's impossible," he whispered faintly.
Charlie looked up from the maps he was bent over. His frustration with all the interruptions evaporated like smoke, however, when he saw a small teenager standing in the doorway with Sturgis Podmore standing behind him, his face shinning with both excitement and awe. Only the Triad knew of Harry's existence as Shadow Snape, so the rest of the Order and the Wizarding World still thought Harry was dead or missing since that summer.
older, after all.
… How she missed him.
Severus moved reluctantly into the room, but he would not sit. "I am troubled to hear of your difficulty with the Order. I was not aware my son's circumstances had so negatively affected you."
"Better?" Remus asked very softly. He was crouched by the sofa Neville was laying on and gently carding a hand through the teen's sweat-soaked hair.
"Shadow isn't some weapon to be used against the Dark Lord, prophecy or not!" Neville snapped at her. "They need to fight this war for themselves. Shadow will do his part, but we can't just let him fight by himself or act like we don't have to do our best because he'll save us in the end. It doesn't work like that!"
"Come in," Umbridge called sweetly.
"Nothing's going to happen to us. We're ready. You're ready. We'll be fine."
"I believe you destroyed a second one in the graveyard," Severus offered. "I think Demon is just as destructive as a basilisk."
"Shut up, Ron," Ginny snapped. "Can't you think past that stupid House shit for five seconds! Slytherins aren't all evil. Even I can see that by this point."
“Hmmm," Severus sneered at the teen's wording and Harry laughed. "Fine," the man relented, pleased beyond measure that Harry could still laugh.
"You don't have to do this," Shadow repeated for about the tenth time. He was looking off to the side, not meeting anyone's eyes. It was obvious that he was embarrassed.
"Out," he repeated, unrelenting.
No one noticed Sirius missing.
"Yes, sir." Shadow sighed and reached for the scroll.
"Just after one in the morning. I had to wait until everyone else in your House was sleeping to be sure only you heard what I'm about to tell you," the phantom explained, impatiently brushing his shoulder-length brown hair out of his face. Usually the muscular teen had it pulled back in a ponytail or braid, but it hung loose now, giving the phantom the appearance of having just got out of bed himself.
Sirius stared dumbly for a moment, shocked by the competent and strong woman before him. He recovered quickly as a grin flashed across his face and he bowed low. "Of course, madam."
Neville turned a bit green. He backed away, shaking his head mutely.
"And Neville?" Harry pressed, still very worried about his brother.
Neville recoiled from the destructive magic. Earth was a balance of both death and creation, but he could not tolerate such pure destruction. Nothing living could. That was the point. There was no fighting it. This magic was Annihilation. Implacable. Unchangeable. There was nothing to do but retreat to where life could still exist.
"Did he hurt you?" Shadow rasped fearfully.
The man smiled when Neville finished the bowel, making the teen blush with shame. "Come now. Don't feel bad. Is it too cold in here?" The man cast a powerful Warming Charm on him, making Neville feel as if he were in a nice sauna. "There."
"Yeah," Shadow agreed, ducking his head with a deep frown.
"… it'll bite off her head and not just nip her in the ass!" Fred laughed, playfully hitting Shadows shoulder and lifting his eyebrows rapidly in a knowing leer. "Get us?"
“I caution you not to follow blindly. You are not Hufflepuffs. The Dark Lord's aims have been twisted by insanity. There is a cost, a very steep cost, to avoid death, to be brought back when your life has been taken, to fashion a whole new body when your own has been blasted away, and the Dark Lord has suffered in payment.
"What's so important about the locket?" George asked.
The sun was just breaking over the horizon as he slipped from the bed. He stepped quietly from the room and paced around the empty house. They had no electricity, no furniture - except for the kitchen table - but they did have working bathrooms and running water. For some reason, he found the open rooms comforting. He paced and thought, analyzing the situation as best he could.
"I do," Shadow said on a sigh. "I hate admitting it because… Well, it frightens me. But while I was watching him die slowly, I knew without a doubt how much of my life would be wrecked if Draco were to leave me. I need him. I depend on him. I want him to be happy. I like that I can fight with him, that he doesn't treat me differently because of my mental condition. And he's beautiful; I admire his strength. He makes me laugh, and he takes care of me."
"Charlie was telling me about that. Neville is my best friend. I think of him like a brother and his rescue is definitely on the top of my list. Are you paying attention to nature while you search? Neville is an Earth Elemental, and if he's unhappy or hurt, plant-life is affected around him. It could give us a clue as to where he is."
"Don't know. A while before I got here. Why?" Draco narrowed his eyes at the chubby Gryf. He still didn't like Longbottom much, but they had come to a sort of truce when it came to Shadow.
It wasn't until Saturday that Curtis's threat was revealed to have some truth to it. It was a Hogsmeade weekend and Miles had finally convinced Shadow to come to the village with them.
"What do we have here? Two kiddies out for walk? Isn't it past your bedtime?"
"She's definitely gone too far," the brunet agreed. "But we still can't do much against her." He sighed and looked again at Draco's battered features. Standing, he crossed the distance between them and knelt next to his Slytherin friend. Gently, Shadow touched the bruised skin and muttered a healing charm.
"There was a boat. There was a b-basin of potion on an island. The D-Dark Lord made Kreacher drink it…" The elf quaked from head to foot. "Kreacher drank, and as he drank, he saw terrible things… Kreacher's insides burned… Kreacher cried for Master Regulus to save him, he cried for his Mistress Black, but the Dark Lord only laughed… He made Kreacher drink all the potion and dropped a locket into the empty basin… He filled it with more potion. Then the Dark Lord sailed away and left Kreacher on the island."
"No two bodies can fit perfectly; there will always be arms and legs in the way, dissimilar curves, etc. Only the illusion of fitting perfectly can be granted and that is caused by a heightened sense of wellbeing and love for that person."
"What are we going to do?" Draco pressed, still following the man.
"I promised to keep it secret," Rowena repeated sorrowfully. "It is too powerful for just anyone to possess."
"Not really." Neville smiled wryly, self-hate in his eyes. "But I promise not to get upset over this in front of Shadow again. Even if you do k-kiss him. He really did look happy when you were d-dancing."
"Maybe," Shadow gasped, stars still going off behind his eyes. He grit his teeth and tried not to scream.
Shadow hunched over the piano's keys, his arms wrapped around his chest. Sweat slid down his face and dripped from his chin, splashing on a pure white key. Heat constricted his chest as he felt the tugging vacuum at the back of his mind awaken. Grunting, his two-colored eyes glowed with effort as he held to consciousness. Seph pulled restlessly at him, not quite exerting his full strength in trying to tug him under.
"Is it her?" Viktor asked urgently, anger sparking in his dark eyes, also remembering the last time Hermione had come to him with such an expression.
"WILL YOU TWO GET DOWN HERE, PLEASE?!" Mrs. Weasley bellowed up the stairs, done with the twins.
The being was kneeling in the rubble, its hair swaying passively, the dark eyes wide and unblinking. A small whimper was rising from its throat as the wings spread limply to either side. It had both arms wrapped around itself, but whether for comfort or warmth Draco didn't know.
Bundled in his pajamas with a blanket wrapped around him and hot chocolate warming his hands, he sat on the couch and prepared for another grueling therapy session. Severus had offered to let them postpone it for later that week, but as much as he hated it, Shadow hated being messed up more. He
For all of Draco’s life, his peers had been assigned to him by his father. They were comrades and acquaintances, but never true friends. He always had limits as to how far he could trust them because betrayal was certain if he showed weakness, if he slipped even a little bit away from upholding the Malfoy standards.
"I know that.” Harry shook his head. "I decided this before Draco's answer came." He sighed and ran his hands through his hair, ignoring the pain the move caused. "Look. There are many reasons why I am agreeing. I don't want to leave Hogwarts yet. I want to go back to school with Nev and Draco. I want to keep an eye on what's happening here, but I don't want to be Harry Potter while doing it. I always hated the fame and expectations being Harry Potter brought me. I am glad to finally be shedding it, but more than that…" He looked over at Severus, meeting his guarded dark eyes. "Severus, I've learned to depend on you. I trust you. You're a part of my life now and I wouldn't have it any other way. No matter what I choose, you're going to be there. Might as well as make it official, right?"
Draco nodded sadly. "Yes. Sometimes it's better than remembering."
"I hope you're right.” Shadow smiled ruefully. "It is a good plan."
They stopped at a grimy looking door, a dark brown in color. It had an immense iron lock, but it hung open. Severus turned the heavy door handle and pushed it open revealing a circular dungeon room. The walls were lined with benches that went up several rows. A single chair - the arms covered in heavy, lifeless silver chains - sat in the middle of the floor, center stage to all those seats.
Shadow and Remus spent the night squirreled away with Severus and his notes. Sirius was equally busy in the library and was growing ever more frustrated when his search turned up nothing useful. Neville and Draco remained in the sitting room with a Pensieve sitting on the coffee table between their two couches.
"That was…" Shadow took a deep breath. He reached up and wiped at his eyes, but he couldn't continue.
Hermione stood next to him, wringing her hands. "Malfoy was quiet most of last year. He didn't really bother us like he normally did, did he?"
She didn't expect the waiting to be so hard, though. Her arm was getting tired and the adrenaline was leaving her system, making her hand shake. Horrible sounds drifted through the thick stone walls, screams mostly. Every time the ground rumbled, she noticed the others sharing nervous looks.
Shadow took in the near standstill through dazed eyes. The room was buzzing with magic and clocks were breaking all around the room under the pressure. Ginny appeared and managed to take one of the three Death Eaters by surprise, felling him with a simple Stupefy. That wouldn't hold him for long, but it lasted long enough for Luna to knock out the remaining two.
Molly shooed everyone out and they made their way back downstairs, Arthur recommending hot chocolate for all of them. Hermione begged off, feeling tired, still not fully healed. Fred went up with her, but the others sat around the twinkling tree and drank cocoa, talking softly. Remus sat on the floor, his back against the couch with Tonks in his lap. Molly and Arthur sat next to each other, Molly's head on her husband's shoulder. Their children lay in a sprawled together in a heap, happy and content.
"Only those whom the prophecy speaks of can touch the orb once it is recorded," Severus admitted reluctantly. He knew the instant he did his son would want to go and destroy it.
The brunet smiled at the damage, making Draco narrow his eyes with renewed anger.
"Where is the second?"
more clearly, than she had in a
Present-time Draco smiled. "Emotional blackmail was often used to teach a lesson. I think it's because spoiled and aristocratic children tend not to respond to anything else. Certainly it worked. Within a few days, I could repeat the alphabet and recognize letters. In a month, I was writing both lower and upper case letters on command."
Severus began to explain the trial, leaving out nothing. His recitation was concise and it only took ten minutes. Minerva was pacing by the end like a caged lion. She was obviously unhappy.
"But the marks…" Shadow interrupted, a frown marring his brow.
"…shred their skins frequently," George grinned.
That stopped Sirius's laughter in its tracks. "Well, then they won't find out," he vowed.
. You'll not spread your filthy
"Why doesn't McGonagall do something about it? Umbridge is awful!"
Draco blushed and lifted a hand to tuck his the bangs behind his ear. He shot his love an evaluative glance. “Yeah, you did a great job.”
"I was… I opened my magic and let it take me away…" Neville spoke, still walking around the tree and touching along it's trunk. "For the first time, I was without fear because I couldn't afford to be afraid. Harry needed me… Then I found him and it was like… Like I grew out of the ground, like the roots of a tree absorbed me up and into it's body…. That's when I realized I was a tree and reversed the Animagus Transfiguration."
Luna laughed at his expression and stood. She turned in a circle, her robes swirling around her. "It's a beautiful day, isn't it?"
Shadow grimaced. "Fine. It's not like I get a say in the matter." He stood abruptly and left the table, stalking out of the room toward the entrance.
"What kind of things?" Severus asked carefully. It was vital that his voice was completely neutral. Otherwise Shadow would either shut down or explode. Still, the carefully voiced question made his son tremble and hug himself.
"Impossible!" Shadow yelled, his face turning an angry red. "No one could love me like that! I just don't want anyone touching me, okay?"
"Where are you going?" Draco finally asked as Harry tried to move past him. He refused to back down and kept his body blocking the doorway.
George saw that she was helping and darted for another door. He returned a few minutes later with Ginny. Hermione stared up at her with an open mouth. Ginny was a
He had allowed himself to be lulled back to sleep, satisfied with the death and pain he had inflicted in these half-dreams, but not this time. This time he was too
Dark obsidian eyes flashed up and acknowledged him. "I'll be right there."
The Lady's willowy form distorted with rage as Shadow summoned the diadem to him in the confusion. "The Diadem of Wisdom! Give it back!" she screeched, making the piles of lost treasures tremble dangerously around them.
The blond took it and drank it gratefully. "But what if we're detected?"
The little girl buried her face into his shoulder and clung to his neck. "Angel is s-s-scared! Are we in tr-tr-trouble? Are bad people coming to g-g-get us?" she stuttered fearfully. She couldn't imagine anything making the powerful Angel afraid, but it must be horrible.
Draco nodded and Severus said the Dark unlocking spell. He didn't hear the actual words. His vision narrowed until all that he could see was the locket as it slowly popped open. Invisible rain pelted upward at him, filled with pure Dark magic. He could feel it soaking into his skin and he went tense, a strange invasive pleasure making his muscles twitch.
Sirius threw the heavy box to the side. He'd gone through everything. It wasn't up here. "Where else could it be?" he growled, glaring at the trunks, boxes, and furniture all around him.
"You are obviously more in tune to Demon than you are admitting," Severus snarled after one of Shadow's more exasperating silences. "Merging is closer than you think and you need to be careful."
Sirius muttered but obediently turned his attention to Shadow like everyone else. What he heard blew him away. He was so shocked he couldn't even react for a second. Finally, he jumped to his feet. "WHAT? How could he… His
"Shadow." Draco pulled away and stared into his friend's eyes. "You aren't a monster. You're just…" His mouth quirked into a wry smile. "…complex, and I for one think that's not such a bad thing to be considering our options. And we're not nearly beaten yet."
"Calm down," Severus said gently, deeply concerned. Shadow seemed to be unraveling before his eyes.
"Remus, Sirius.” Harry smiled and gestured to Draco. "This is my friend, Draco Malfoy. Draco, you've met Remus Lupin. He's currently acting as my doctor. This is Sirius Black. My godfather. They stay here with Severus and me."
Silence met her declaration. She eyed both men. She was starting to think that it wasn't just Severus in on the conspiracy and that made her even angrier. "No. I think you both know where Potter is. I think he is close and reachable. I think you helped him construct this absurd cover about China, which Miss Granger has informed me has holes in it regarding the temple in which he says he is staying. This is too important to keep from me, Severus, Sirius. You know how much is riding on his safety, as well as our ability to aid and protect him. Things are going to get worse from here on out. He can no longer remain in hiding. Do you understand?"
get in here? Don't you know what this place is?" Ginny snapped back. "Maybe you
"You need to do so." Severus sat forward and stared intently at his charge. "Listen to me. This is important. I came to know you through these sessions. My expertise and experience has granted me the ability to facilitate your healing. It is in this capacity that I can most help you as your father. My position beside you is fixed. Nothing said in this room will change that. Do you understand?"
Shadow smiled at her, secrets in his eyes. "I guess we'll see in September.”
"Not really.” Draco shrugged and turned to face the keys. He lifted a hand and pushed a few down. The notes filled the room. "He's powerful and terrifying, and I'd hate to be the Dursleys, but… He only comes Out when you're broken. And I'm grateful for that. In any case, I don't plan on seeing you like that again. So… What's there to be scared of?"
"Show off," Ron muttered but tipped the cup back as his brothers did.
"He's not stupid. And Madam Longbottom isn't a pushover either. They'll be fine." Shadow ignored him and headed for the stairs. "Where are you going? Aren't you hungry?" Draco called after him.
. So scared. I was so
The strawberry-blonde nodded and held her wand more firmly, her blue eyes shining with determination to do better.
"Kreacher, sit up and tell me everything you know about that locket, everything about your orders. Maybe I can help restore the Black honor and return the locket."
Determined, Shadow knelt and pulled him half into his lap. "Draco. You did it. You did it; it's over."
"How do you know about that?" Charlie frowned. He had thought the situation was being kept under wraps.
Very carefully, Neville worked through his memories. He remembered brushing Ginny's hair by the fire after dinner. They talked softly of their classes, Carrow's terribly difficult Potions test, and the DA. She stood, kissed his cheek, and went up to bed. Then what?
Shadow sat heavily, returning to his place on the couch. He knew how deep the animosity between his godfather and Severus was. For his father to even hint that Sirius had been useful, or even necessary, showed just how badly things had gone.
Remus looked imploringly at the teen. "Don't take it too literally, Shadow. You certainly shouldn't be planning on confronting You-Know-Who on your own. The future is fluid and can't really be predicted accurately."
"I shouldn't hurt you, Shadow," he protested seriously, capturing his hand. "It shouldn't be like that."
Neville fidgeted, his face tight with unhappiness. "I was taught the basics by my grandmother, and when I turned eight, they sent me to a day school with other Wizarding children to help prepare me for Hogwarts. I don't know if that will be helpful."
"Nev!" Shadow jumped, startled. "What are you doing here?"
Draco chuckled and together they managed to get to their feet. He subtly cast cleaning charms on them and had to swallow his laughter as Shadow blushed red with shy embarrassment. Draco took a firm grip of his hand and savored his still fizzing nerves as they made their way to the kitchen. He couldn't conceal his grin, however, when he realized that Shadow was holding on just as tightly as he was.
The doors exploded and only Draco's spell kept them from being injured by the force of the debris. Glowing red eyes and fanged mouths filled Draco's vision as vampires stepped sensuously into the hall. Sirius bellowed a spell. Draco had no idea what he'd cast, but one vampire was flung against the wall. One of the girls screamed. More vampires and a few Death Eaters filled the doorway. Draco gritted his teeth and squared his stance. He aimed carefully, killing the farthest Death Eater on the right.
“Good." Neville smiled. "You're my brother and nothing can change that, right?"
Shadow laughed. "Draco didn't mention that."
"Nothing you can say will fix this. You can't do anything to stop Carrow."
"Those were my idea," Marissa admitted with a grin. "Sirius was the one to make the peas dance."
"Good morning, Shadow," Marissa called. She rubbed at her eyes sleepily and leaned against Sirius.
It was a beautiful Saturday afternoon. Most of Ginny's homework was done, she had Quidditch practice to look forward to tomorrow, and she was sitting by the lake with her boyfriend. The sun was warm, the breeze was cool. The sound of the sparkling blue water gently slapping against the bank lulled her into a tranquil place.
Bella was already writhing in pain by the time he reached the bottom of the stairs as he whispered a generalized Cruciatus curse. He needed to practice if he were to find the right combination of spells for his faithless little Severus Snape. In fact, Voldemort would create a new spell just to make sure Severus suffered the full extent of the Dark Lord's wrath. He grabbed one of the fools and drug him into the center of the room.
She heard the rustling of robes and stared in horror and awe as her Lord stood and walked down toward her, terrible magic swelling around him in a dark wave.
Shadow about jumped out of his skin when he heard the loud (to him) scrape of the door being pushed open. The half-open door let in dim orange light. It was like looking into the sun after so many long hours in the dark. A sharp outline of a figure blocked most of it, thankfully.
Eventually, Draco had the bath running and coaxed Seraphim into taking off his clothes. He frowned when he saw the discoloration of his nails, feet, and hands. He must have been frozen for hours last night. He moved to turn down the heat, knowing it would seem twice as hot to the chilled teen. He only hoped that he had defrosted enough by now that it wouldn't hurt too badly.
Augusta sniffed disdainfully, her opinion of his ability to manage the situation obvious, but she did as her grandson requested. She also cast another Stupefy on the unconscious boy just in case. "And just whom are you writing so furiously?" she asked archly.
Shadow laughed. "Have fun, but don't get in too much trouble. She's vicious and has a lot of power right now."
"I had to look twice to recognize you," Hermione admitted. "You did a good job. I don't sense magic, though."
Alone, Draco tried to open the door closest to him, but unlike the others his was locked. He grinned. "This has to be the one!" he said quietly and prepared to break in.
"No, Hermione. I wouldn't even want to. I've left that behind. This is who I am now," he told her softly.
"I do understand that," Harry said softly, lowering his head and fidgeting with his fingers. "I'm as protective of this house as you are, though I know you have no way of knowing that." He fell silent. Sighing, he lay his head back and stared at the ceiling. "You know, growing up, all I wanted was to get away from the Dursleys. I imagined having my own home, but I… I didn't really picture people in it. When I was younger - I guess until I was about six - I imagined my parents or some other family member rescuing me. That fantasy died when I got to school and saw how loving parents acted around their children. I realized that if anyone were coming, they would have by then. So the fantasy changed to a place of my own with no one else. That was my idea of paradise. It kept me going."
Sirius and Remus were speechless. What Shadow was describing was of the Darkest Arts. So Dark they weren't even sure it was possible, but the disbelief faded as fast as it was born. They knew Voldemort was capable of the most horrific things. Why should this be any different?
"That would be good," Shadow encouraged.
"I already knew that, Serpentine.” Shadow smiled. "You don't have to show me this."
"I see." Charlie crossed his arms and regarded the teenager solemnly. "Are you going to tell me the truth now regarding the creature you turned into and your confusion as to your identity in the Department of Mysteries? I would also like to know about the extreme power you displayed."
"It's not natural," Ron argued mutinously. "Harry's a Gryffindor and suddenly Snape adopts him - which by the way is CRAZY! Snape hates him! - and now he's Malfoy's best friend and treating us like
"There you are!"
"I've given it a lot of thought. I've talked to Neville and, even though he insists I shouldn't, I feel it's the best course of action for everyone involved. If you don't tell Ron and Hermione the truth, I'm going to."
"Severus?"
Shock, recognition, understanding, and then finally repulsion slid across Severus's open mind in answer. Black's mind was chaotic, spiking in bright spurts, eddying sullenly in between. Words, flavors, images flashed by even as the mangy cur tried to force him out of his mind.
Draco and Harry spun to see three lackeys come barreling toward them. Harry slashed out with his wand reflexively and their Dark spell splashed harmlessly against his shield and ricocheted into the wall. The wallpaper curled up and disintegrated, revealing smooth white stone underneath. Draco had a return curse on his lips, but he never uttered it. He watched in morbid fascination as the last guy went rigid, his mouth falling open as he screamed in agony.
Numbly, Hermione reached for the thick envelope. It read: To Hermione and Ron. "Oh my god," she breathed and quickly tore it open. Ron was practically pressed at her side, reading over her shoulder. Distantly, Hermione noted that the handwriting did look like Harry's.
Again Shadow nodded. Sirius gently took Marissa from him. The little girl waved at Shadow and said softly, "I'm glad you're okay, Shadow."
Shadow moved forward with great reluctance. Pity and curiosity lapped at his mind. He didn't want anything of theirs touching him, but he wasn't about to shut down his only way to get insight into their plans and attitudes.
They hallway branched right and left, rooms opening up on either side with large archways. Art began to decorate the hall; sculptures stood on marble half-pillars. A painting up ahead shook and rattled against the wall before falling completely off, the frame cracking almost in two at the impact on the hard floor.
"What did they do to him?" Draco asked hoarsely. His throat was sore from suppressing his emotions for so long.
Tonks jumped and hurried to do as she was told, leaving Moody to examine the room, muttering questions about how dark magic of this nature got into the house in the first place. Tonks moved to the girls' bedroom, knowing Molly would have gathered her boys in with her and Ginny there. The six teens were crowded into the room - standing, sitting in chairs, on the bed, wherever they could fit. Molly was standing by the door, facing it with her wand ready to defend her younger children plus Hermione.
Neville looked pale and was out of breath, but he was otherwise all right. "We'd better hurry. We have about four minutes until the Order starts showing up. What's your plan?"
Shadow considered returning to human form. He'd be able to restrain Neville and drag him back to the door, but he didn't want any record of Snape's son here tonight. Later he would be retrieving the prophecy and that would blow his cover as Shadow completely. Besides, whatever spell was on that veil that had Neville captivated could potentially effect him too once he transformed. Then they both would be lost.
Draco didn't say anything as he stood and went after his friend. Neville watched him go miserably. He wished he had never come. Remus put a warm hand on his shoulder, but it didn't make him feel better.
The excited shouts and loud cheers slowly tapered off as the Slytherins came upon the front doors. There was a large group of students blocking the way as they watched what was happening in the Entrance Hall.
"I know," Draco admitted and closed his eyes.
Moody didn't look up at his rescuer, Shadow noticed, turning instead to crouch over an injured Tonks. Remus was already waking up and getting unsteadily to his feet. Shacklebolt shouted what looked like questions at Severus. The Potions Master gave sneering, clipped responses. Shadow scowled at this. His father had
"Nev? You okay? It should be me freaking out over here," Shadow said playfully, but his eyes were tense with nervousness. "You don't have to go in with me."
Draco choked, eyes wide. Even Severus looked appalled.
The remaining forty-five minutes Shadow broke everyone into groups to research a defense related topic using the books provided by the room. During the next meeting, the groups would take turns presenting what they learned and how they thought it would or wouldn't be applicable in a battle.
"Yes, sir. He's senseless."
Draco screamed as one spell lashed his arm; his blood spilled to the floor.
The teen's face scrunched and Draco noticed a sheen of sweat on his face. He was about to reach out and shake his friend when Shadow gasped and sat up, clutching his chest tightly with one hand.
"What happened here?" McGonagall demanded.
Severus said.
"Where's Draco?" he asked softly. Neville couldn't speak or move. Seraphim backhanded him viciously across the face, and the teen fell with a startled cry. "WHERE IS HE?" he bellowed.
"He needs to see a doctor!" Augusta said shrilly. She yanked her hand away from her grandson and began to sharply straighten her clothes.
"Talk? Yes, of course, Severus! Let's talk. It's not like we haven't done ENOUGH OF THAT FOR A LIFETIME!" Shadow jumped to his feet, eyes wild. "I think the time for talk has long since passed, don't you? We should be doing something! We've been sitting on our asses for weeks and Tom's out there getting stronger! Hell, he could be at full strength again by this point! We're no closer to finding the Horcruxes than we were before! I'm the fucking Chosen One! I should be doing something more productive than playing war games with children and mind games with demented Ministry bitches!"
Harry nodded. "Any news about Neville?"
Sliding a glance first at his father and then Sirius, Shadow stepped up to Draco and kissed him, his hands sliding through the long bangs and into the now short black hair which tickled at his palms. Draco wrapped his arms around Shadow’s slender waist and held him there possessively. Sirius wolf-whistled and both teenagers flushed as they came apart.
Severus relented and a rare smile brushed his lips. "But considering your age, I think the marks are impressive no matter how you look at it. You did well and I'm proud of you."
Shadow said nothing to this, crossing his arms and staring moodily at the fire once more. When Severus merely stared at him for long minutes, the teen finally looked back with an annoyed glare. "You keep saying that relationships make people happy and healthy, but what happens when what you think is healthy turns out to only make your sickness worse?"
"I'll get the Headmistress," Hermione said before running from the room.
was being given such authority. "Is he related to the twins?"
"The final battle is upon us. I'm making Merlin's Brew for the Order members. We will need something to offset the balance. The Death Eaters will outnumber us greatly, and it grants a temporary increase in both physical prowess and mental acuity. "
"And Ron's accepted you now, so you could tell him, too," Ginny said gently.
Shadow gasped and sat up quickly, covered in sweat, the dream slowly falling away from him.
"I had a dream… I was dreaming of opening Demon's door. Of letting him go free to destroy everyone who hurt me. I didn't care at all about those who would be caught in the middle. In fact, it made me exhilarated to think of everyone fearing me."
when he was in more danger than ever before? Why not keep him hidden? No one knew the boy existed! Bringing him out now is illogical."
"I do," Shadow answered. He was able to ignore Ron's threatening posture for the moment because Neville was now standing next to him protectively. "That's why I'm answering you as much as I can, but there are just some things you're going to have to accept. I'm Shadow Snape. It's not a ruse or a cover. I really am Shadow. I'm happy being Shadow."
Harry nodded. "I know. I just don't know what I'm going to tell him. I don't want to
"Is Lockhart the only gay man you know?" Remus asked.
, but you don't see what's right in front of you! All you see is a lightning-shaped scar and the supposed obligations he should have to bear because of a prophecy! A prophecy I know, by the way, and let me tell you, it doesn't say anywhere in it that he has to enslave himself to the Wizarding world. He doesn't owe us his life or sanity!"
Shadow frowned in dismay. "Of course."
"No. It's okay," Miles insisted. "You've done a lot for us."
Draco couldn't believe how fast his friend moved. He had no time to react as his wand went flying. Then the other teen was on top of him. He screamed as the sudden weight bore down on his injured ribs.
Keeping that in mind, they practiced dueling a couple hours each day. Harry worked himself tirelessly and paid for it at night as his muscles cramped and spasmed. Draco said nothing about this, just laid with him and helped work out the kinks. He worked alongside Harry, dueling against several Order members, but didn't push himself to the brink like Harry did. He wisely took breaks and was therefore stronger come Saturday night than Harry who was wiped out.
Death Eaters were at Hogwarts. Dark creatures who were connected to the Earth with a unique bond were off their hunting grounds and converging at the school. He could feel the struggle as humans clashed with humans, magic vied against magic. Memories of Dark Ages filtered through his mind and he moaned his denial. Such times were so hard on the Earth, on every single life. He wouldn't stand by and let another Dark Age come to pass. He wouldn't let the world be at the mercy of the same people who held him in that cell, who tormented him body and mind.
working together. He smiled, but wiped his expression blank before stepping into the room. It wouldn't do for the two to become suspicious and destroy the good thing they had started.
Minerva lifted her eyebrow archly. "Don't be too sure that you won't be a Gryffindor yourself, young man. I see a lot of bravery in you."
." He paused, watching the effects of his words play out on his godfather's face. "Stop treating me like a child. I can make my own decisions. Okay?"
The Potions Master nodded and came to stand beside him. "Of course," he said, but his eyes flicked to Harry asking if he was sure. The teenager nodded once. Seeing this, Severus lifted his wand and put the tip gently over Harry, McGonagall, and Charlie's clasped right hands. "Will you, Minerva McGonagall and Charlie Weasley, keep the secret I am about to reveal to yourselves?"
"He must stay here. We can't have an impressionable boy striding around," Lucius warned.
The teen had one blue eye, the color of fire burning hot, and the other a lime green. Not the neon lime color of crayons but the actual rich color of the fruit. Both were beautiful, but she couldn't help the slight twist of unease in her gut. She banished it quickly. The old stories were all a bunch of nonsense, anyway.
Shadow felt his chest tighten. "Has he…?"
? Why didn't he try to run?"
"I will
Gently, lovingly, he brushed Shadow's curls away from his face and whispered softly, "Sweet dreams."
"Do you know the paths of which I speak?" Firenze asked softly, almost gently.
"It's not going
Severus considered this for a moment before answering, his fingers steepled his fingers under his chin thoughtfully. "It is true that your partner wouldn't completely understand what you have been through, but that does not have to be a disadvantage. Their inability to truly comprehend why you are the way you are can be a comfort. Imagine if they did go through what you did. Imagine dealing with someone very much like yourself. How would that help? A truly loving partner would be patient and willing to help you through things as much as they could."
"Dolores? Do you have proof that they were involved?" McGonagall asked casually.
Shadow covered his face, rubbing at it. Draco put an arm around his friend's shoulder and wished he knew what to say.
"No, Professor Umbridge. I have nothing to add to this discussion."
Draco smirked at him, vastly pleased, and fiddled with his bangs as he examined himself in the mirror. He still felt a pang, but it helped enormously that although he looked less like Narcissa, he also looked less like Lucius.
"I think you're not so far behind as you think," Neville said thoughtfully. "I think if you fall in love with someone, you'll be able to trust them even if you can't trust yourself. I mean, you never trusted L-L-Lockhart, but maybe you can trust someone else. Like I trust Ginny…" Neville trailed off, feeling understanding bloom. He trusted Ginny. He honestly
Charlie clapped his hands to get everyone's attention. "Okay, you guys. We have a lot to be thankful for and an Order member to remember. How about we all take the day off?"
"I will," the two adults chorused.
"It wouldn't be the first time I've watched you kill people, Father," Draco said icily. "What makes you think that would bother me?"
Draco had arrived shortly after Black in the middle of Longbottom's explanation. Lupin arrived now and pushed Severus out of the way. He wrapped the shaken teen in an embrace and whispered supportively into his ear. Longbottom shuddered and looked close to breaking down completely. Severus felt sympathy, but he couldn't have that. He had to know the rest.
Severus frowned, but he could understand Seraphim's point of view. Draco and he had stayed here several times and had been safe each time. He didn't understand that this was only because they hadn't stayed for a long period. He didn't understand how hard it would be to live in such an empty house. They couldn't keep stealing food. It would get them into trouble, not to mention the Wizarding world would find them eventually by following their trail. He had no idea how to make this damaged side of his son understand these complications, either.
"I-I'm sorry… I didn't mean to interrupt…" Neville trailed off in complete confusion.
"Cutting it a bit close, don't you think?" Draco hissed when they landed safely at the bottom of the slide. They had almost been caught, but they had dodged into the bathroom just as a talking trio had turned the corner into the hallway.
"Sorry. Just need to talk to Ron. I'll be quick," she said with a grin.
"Oh, Neville." Remus squeezed his shoulder. "I'm happy for you."
"Yes, Professor," Shadow agreed, his heart pounding. He could only think of one reason why Sirius would need to speak to him.
She beamed at him happily and opened her blanket to show them a smaller version of Draco's tattoo just under her collarbone. Shadow didn't see any teeth marks and felt the ice cold terror uncoil a bit from around his spine. He hadn't turned the little girl into a monster for the rest of her life. There was that, at least. Then he noticed how thin she was. He could see every rib, her stomach was concave, and her legs so very bony.
"Yeah. Mum said we're gonna go to St. Mungo's to visit Dad after lunch." George nodded. He stood, pulling Fred to his feet, who turned and gave a very deep bow as if Shadow were royalty.
"You're determined to suffer alone, aren't you," Draco snarled at his back.
