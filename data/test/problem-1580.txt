Harry sat down at the desk, his left side he would devote the drawers to all his student needs, blank parchment, black ink, and normal quills along with his textbooks. He kept a few defense books on the right for him to teach from. Hermione had insisted they also follow the curriculum to the letter, so the books would certainly help keep him on track. Harry also left some red ink and spellcheck and cheating detecting quills in the drawers on that side.
“For the crime of being a part of Voldemort’s Death Eaters, those who say she is guilty, please stand.”
Draco stood and was led out by his aurors and the witch who had originally fetched him. With a glance over his shoulder he saw a group of aurors leading his mum through the door that led to the holding cells.
He hoped desperately to be placed with Blaise, but he knew it was impossible. McGonagall had said that no one would be placed with anyone from their same original house. Could the sorting hat have made a mistake though, and placed him with Blaise anyway? He highly doubted it, things never went his way. It just wasn’t in the cards for him to be happy.
The Thursday to Saturday arrangement for his custody of Teddy changed to weekends only. They had fallen into a rhythm where Harry would pick up Teddy before dinner on Fridays and then keep him over the weekend. He and Andromeda would meet up for dinner on Sundays at the manor of all places. It was a good arrangement, Andie got to see her sister, Harry got to see his boyfriend and Teddy got to run around the manor grounds.
A ministry wizard stood and said, “Draco Malfoy, as you have been found guilty of the crime of being a Death Eater, you are sentenced to six months of probationary house arrest upon your completion of Hogwarts. During your time at Hogwarts, should you choose to visit Hogsmeade you are to be accompanied by an auror, as you will be on the Hogwarts express to return you home for holidays. After your house arrest you will remain on probation for a year with regular check ins from the Ministry. Do you understand.”
Draco scoffed and continued to make his way upstairs. Harry smiled, Draco was coming to movie night for him.
Narcissa was likely to get off without much more than some house arrest. There was actual evidence in her favor rather than little to none against her, as was the case with Draco.
Draco stood up and closed his laptop. He slipped it into his computer bag and threw the bag over his shoulder. As an afterthought he stuck in his notebook and a pencil- just incase. With a muttered goodbye in Ron’s general direction, he strode from the dorm, and allowed his legs to take him wherever they pleased.
“Father has already been on trial, Potter testified against him. About him getting the chamber opened in our second year. Him being one of those who attacked at the World Cup, returning when the Dark Lord was reborn, being in the department of mysteries, and calling the Dark Lord when Potter was at our house.” Draco said, and there was no animosity in the words. He wasn’t sure what he felt towards Potter, but he knew one thing for sure. He had let go of his hate he had once held.
Amycus Carrow strode out, perfectly at ease with the chains entrapping him. He settled himself into an adjacent chair.
They walked along in a companionable silence, eventually coming and stopping at a bookstore to let Teddy in from the cold. Harry lifted Teddy out of the stroller so he could look around for a bit, he sat on one of the cushy chairs and sat Teddy in his lap.
Occasionally they passed a professor who Jennifer pointed out and said what they usually taught if she knew them.
“I’m going to go get Blaise, there is absolutely no chance the two of us can get all of this unpacked on our own before midnight.” She darted out before Draco had the chance to even process her words.
“Sounds good.” Draco said with a nod as Harry turned back towards the coffee machine. Now was his chance, to ask the thing he had been wanting to since Harry had asked him to split the champagne bottle- was this a date? “Also…” He trailed off as Harry turned back around to look him in the eye. Draco knew it was just Harry being a polite and attentive conversationalist, but he still wished Harry hadn’t looked away from the brewing coffee. Those green eyes locked on his made Draco lose all of his nerve. “Never mind. It’s fine.” He finished lamely, and Harry looked a little disappointed.
The next group came over. “Today for your assessment you will be dueling your roommate, I expect you to use the most complex defensive spells you know. Like I said to the other group I ask that you do not use anything lethal, illegal, or a spell that could cause severe bodily harm.”
He practically ran all of the way back to his dorm room and was glad to find that when he shouldered the door open- careful not to jostle the still scaldingly hot coffee- he found that Ron was not there.
“I know he was marked, and doesn’t have a perfect past, but I don’t think that Draco Malfoy deserves a sentence in Azkaban. He deserves to finish the school year. As his roommate I have never felt uncomfortable sharing a space with him, as one of his teachers this year, he seems to show remorse and is one of the best students I have.” Harry finished and returned to his seat.
“No. The Malfoys out on the continent want nothing to do with us, and Mother’s only family is a sister she hasn’t seen in years.”
Pansy noticed Draco sitting on the couch furiously typing on his laptop. Harry knew that Draco hadn’t gotten as much sleep as he could lately with a paper due for one of his classes.
While I was proud of my last chapter I think I am more proud of how Tay and I’s chapters coordinated this week. Hope you like it please remember to leave comments and Kudos!!!
“Who else knows?” Ron asked, “I don’t want to screw up and blab it to someone who will tell the papers.”
Everyone filed into the Great Hall. Draco’s eyes widened to see the colors mixed together. Red, yellow, blue and even green at every table. Draco trailed behind Blaise and Pansy and sat between them. He stared into his empty plate. But he could see his reflection in the glass, so he redirected his gaze to the staff table. It was half empty, he counted and found five empty seats. Professor Sprout was there, as were Flitwick, Trelawney, Hagrid, McGonagall, Vector and Sinistra. Draco knew they needed a new teachers for potions, transfiguration, defense against the dark arts and muggle studies. But who would the final seat be occupied by.
All thoughts of the date he needed to plan went on the back burner as the tournament loomed before them. More than sixty schools would be attending this year, a higher turnout than ever before. Other colleges likely thought that they might just stand a chance now that the old coach was gone. Draco couldn’t help but wonder if that ideology held some merit.
Harry smiled at the auror as he passed. The auror gaped at Harry, would people never realize he was literally, just a normal person?
“Listen, Potter... Harry,” Draco began, and Harry turned around, looking him full in the face. His heart stuttered in his chest, but he managed to hold onto his courage. Harry’s eyes were soft, and so very kind, welcoming whatever it was that Draco intended to say. It was calming and in a sense made him braver. It was like the Gryffindor in Harry was rolling off him in waves and rubbing off onto Draco. “There’s something I need to say.”
“Thank you for being so awesome.” Harry said, leaning his face into Draco’s side so it came out muffled.
Draco watched it pranced around the room for a minute longer, in awe of its very existence and the mind of the boy beside him, before he waved his wand and made it vanish. He turned to Harry, beaming from ear to ear at the spectacular, wonderful being before him and whispered, “I did it.”
Draco was too shocked to cheer, to shocked to do anything more than gawk at the two as they took their places at the staff table.
Harry stayed with Draco and his friends for all of breakfast, laughing and smiling and joking with them. And Draco felt happier than he had felt in a long time. For the first time, he was content. His attention drifted across the room, to the table that used to belong to the Gryffindors. Weasley was sitting with Thomas and Finnegan at one of the table, and on the other end, Granger sat with Weasley’s sister and Longbottom. And, much to Draco’s surprise, Hermione seemed to be sitting awfully close to Longbottom, a little closer than a pair who were strictly friends would sit.
Pansy squealed excitedly and pulled Draco into a quick hug before hurrying back off in the direction of their dorm building. Hermione was in her dorm room, but sadly Harry was nowhere to be found. Hermione was being very closed lipped about the whole thing, and had vaguely said that Harry had gone off with Sirius and Remus somewhere. But Draco wasn’t one to pry, so he left it alone.
“My best friend is dating your best friend. Also you’ve befriended my roommate. That doesn’t make us friends.”
He reached for it now and fumbled to unwrap it. It was bizarre to say the least. Draco wasn’t quite sure what Harry’s angle on this was. What had inspired this gift? They were cuff links, that he was sure of, but what animal was this? Draco loved them. He had to keep himself from putting them on just then. It would have looked ridiculous, as he was wearing pajamas.
They ended up choosing an intense and hilarious new cooking show that was framed with a sports concept.
She shot him a grin and said, “Yeah, probably. So, worked things out with your roommate yet? By the looks of it, I would say not, unless he’s somewhere around here with more of your boxes?”
“Yes. We actually discussed it yesterday on our way down to the match, we were talking about Ginny and it just kind of came up.”
Suddenly the wand was gone. Draco opened his eyes to find that Ron was face to face with Harry now. Draco wasn’t sure whether Harry had pulled Ron away or Ron had simply decided to redirect his anger, but either way, his attention was now on Harry. “What’s wrong with you, huh? I come downstairs for some peace and quiet only for you to come down snogging Malfoy an hour later! Malfoy! Draco fucking Malfoy, Harry! What are you doing, having a laugh or something? Do you think this is funny?”
He returned to a higher altitude and looked around. He narrowly dodged a stray Bludger, which Hermione soon flew by to go and hit. Then he spotted the snitch again. This time hovering by the goalposts Ron was guarding.
“She was also there when Voldemort’s killing curse struck me for the second time. Contrary to popular belief, I actually did die when that curse struck. Just as I came back to this side of life, I heard Voldemort order someone to check and see if I was dead. The only thing I could think to do was lie there and hope that whoever checked was stupid enough not to check for my heartbeat. Then I felt these kind hands calmly check for my heartbeat, there was a second where I thought I was a goner. But then I hear these barely audible words in my ear ‘Is Draco alive? Is he in the castle?’ The last time I had seen Draco I had saved him from a fire, I assumed that as long as he wasn’t being too stupid or hadn’t gotten in Voldemort’s way he should still be alive, so I told her ‘yes.’
Hey everyone! Things are getting crazy on my end, so I’m proud to have this chapter out on time! Enjoy!
After a quick shower Harry went off to dinner in the Great Hall. He sat down next to Neville and across from Hermione, who was in mid rant about something with Ron.
“It’s fine.” Draco said, using his fingers to neaten Teddy’s hair, “This isn’t exactly disastrous. And it’s not like our little third wheel does much talking yet.”
It was usually a low scoring game since none of them were all that gifted when it came to carving pumpkins, especially when they only really had six minutes per pumpkin. But currently Draco was the reigning champion and he didn’t plan on losing now.
One memorable night Pansy and Hermione were headed back to campus after a date and passed the Rise and Grind just before closing, it was a Friday night so the place was open until midnight to try to catch some of the party crowds and hydrate them before everything got too wild.
“Er, yeah, sure.” Harry said, trailing behind Pansy as she hurried back to where Blaise and Daphne were already seated. Conveniently, Draco noticed that two seats had been left open. Draco narrowed his eyes at the back of Pansy’s head and as she resumed her original place, he could almost feel the smugness drifting off of her.
Draco’s stomach roiled as one of the higher up death eaters came in. He had four aurors surrounding his and was more heavily chained. Even so, he was unfazed and had a lazy, almost bored expression on his face. Draco shrunk back a little as Dolohov came nearer, in spite of himself.
Draco was extremely excited when Halloween arrived, despite the fact that with tennis and all of his class work, he hadn’t had any time to get himself a costume.
“What I did see Draco do that night was disarm Dumbledore, a fact that helped me overtake Voldemort last May. You see, the elder wand was loyal to Dumbledore up until that time. Late last April, I ended up disarming Draco, leading to me being able to defeat Voldemort even though he had an ‘unbeatable’ wand in his possession.” That bit, Draco had known, Potter had explained that to the Dark Lord in front of everyone, and then again during Defense Against the Dark Arts.
The day finally came. October thirty first. Halloween. The fourteenth anniversary of his dad’s death.
We’re getting down to the final countdown here! Only six chapters left! Thank you to everyone who has stuck with us throughout this journey.
“Okay ladies, what’ll you have?” Harry asked as Hermione and Pansy approached the counter, leaving Draco to work.
“It’s a type of muggle axe, when you bury the hatchet, metaphorically of course, it means to end a longstanding conflict of sorts.” Harry said calmly, trying his best not to sound condescending. He should have expected that Draco wouldn’t know the phrase. “Truce?”
Finally, when it neared lunchtime, Draco plucked up the courage to go and talk to Harry, console him if he could, maybe even get him to eat something. “Love? You okay? It’s almost lunch, I was gonna go down and get some food, do you want any?”
“Do you need me to pack for you?” Harry asked, his trunk filled, and his side of the room utterly bare.
Harry led the way across campus and into the city. They made a right and a left and a block later they were at a quaint coffee shop of a local chain called Rise and Grind Coffee.
Before Draco could ask what the hell that meant, the phone beeped and the line went dead. His father had hung up on him without so much as a goodbye. Draco had half a mind to call him back, he wanted to rage at him, but he was so tired and his mind was swimming from all of the alcohol in his system, so instead he left his phone on the desk, sat atop a wireless charger and laid down on his bed, not even bothering to draw back the covers.
Draco didn’t know what time it was when he woke up. All he knew was that it pitch black and someone was screaming. Thunder cascaded about and echoed off the walls, lightning flashed and the screaming- Potter’s screams- stopped abruptly. With the light, of the continued seconds of lightning, Draco craned his neck, just as Potter awoke from a nightmare.
But he couldn’t skip out on Defense Against the Dark Arts, it could be bad for his record, he didn’t need a detention. So, though Draco didn’t want to, he entered Defense Against the Dark Arts for class that Friday. And even worse, Harry would see through any lie he managed to concoct. There would definitely be a confrontation as a result, something Draco was desperate to steer clear of.
The Ministry witch nodded, “They haven’t got much evidence against her, but the Wizengamot members who are here today are the toughest of the bunch. They aren’t ones to let her off easy.”
For the purposes of the tryouts, two extra sets of hoops were placed on the field, “Weasley, Corner, and Macmillan you’re up. The rest of you divide into teams of three, and find a keeper, color the tails of your brooms to keep track of teams.”
Harry had completely forgotten about his early morning hallway duty that would extend through breakfast, which he had to eat at the staff table, for protocol or something.
Sorry about coming in and making my changes to the notes and stuff so late, I was out of town last weekend and will be again next week.
A dark haired girl appeared from the mob of eleven-year-olds and went nervously up to the hat. She sat down and Harry placed the hat on her head and it fell down over her eyes. A few seconds passed and it declared “SLYTHERIN!”
Draco conceded and they had a lovely breakfast up at the staff table. They then returned to their room for their bags and then went straight for the defense classroom.
No, he had touched Potter... and he hadn’t been disgusted by it. It hadn’t been to taunt or harm him either. What was wrong with him? Potter was his enemy, foe not friend.
“Yes, I taught him transfiguration for the first seven and now I am his Headmistress and the head of his house.” She said calmly.
“Well, I just hope that the new defense teacher won’t be out to kill anyone this year. We’ve had enough of that.” Neville said.
He had had a quiet and rather lovely Christmas with his mum. Spending so much time around her had renewed his fears regarding her trial. He knew she missed his father, but he hoped with everything he had that she would not join him in Azkaban.
He thought back to every single Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher he had ever had. Quirrell was dead. Lockhart was living in a hospital, with no memory of who he was, still just as conceded as ever. Lupin was dead, as was his girlfriend, or wife, whatever she was, leaving their son an orphan. The next one had been Moody, or rather, Barty Crouch Junior. Which one should he consider to be his actual teacher? Oh well, it didn’t matter anyhow, both of them were dead. Umbridge, the bitch, was to live out the rest of her days in Azkaban, though granted it was without the dementors. Snape was dead and so was Carrow. It was as though the position was cursed. Some people’s fates had taken a while to catch up with them, others had died on the job, but in the end, none were ‘living the dream’ as they would say.
"Great!" Harry said cheerily. "See you later mate." Harry said, nudging him slightly before walking off towards Ginny and Hermione who were staring at him, confused.
"Of course I knew. I'm not an idiot. I recognized your voice and you left your stupid glasses on your face." Draco said, rolling his eyes and pulling Harry's glasses off his face. Harry blushed red and watched Draco put on his glasses. He looked... Hot. Harry had always thought his glasses made him look a little geeky but Draco somehow managed to rock the style. "God you have dreadful eyesight." Draco said, taking the glasses back off and handing them to Harry who chuckled.
"You better not be talking about girls at all unless you're discussing me." Hermione said with a frown. Ron sighed.
"That's why I asked if you're okay Draco." Harry took a drag on his cigarette, loving the taste of blueberries on his tongue.
going to be an experiment. If you want something from this Draco. I mean it, I wouldn't bullshit you." Harry said. Draco knew he could trust his word. If you couldn't trust the Chosen One that would be pretty sad after all.
"It's what someone usually does when they're trying to get somewhere." Draco said, trying to play this off. He couldn't believe he hadn't noticed Harry. He
"I'm gay." Pansy was so startled she nearly crumbled the paper up into one big mess. Blaise on the other hand calmly looked to Draco and closed his book. Draco expected Blaise to swing at him or something. He even flinched a little.
"Harry Potter!" A voice boomed. Harry would recognize that voice anywhere. Draco stepped into the Great Hall smirking up a storm, pleased that everyone's eyes were on him.
"You're welcome." Draco muttered, putting the cigarette back to his lips anxiously. Why wouldn't Harry just leave? His presence made Draco slightly nauseous and uncomfortable.
Pansy was standing in front of Harry, smirking as if she knew something. "Can I do something for you Parkinson?"
This past month though had been the worst because not only had Draco been unable to get over his feelings for Harry but his emotions seemed to be working overdrive as Harry insisted that the two of them become friends. "It would be good for us I think." Harry kept saying.
"Fight me for the tower. If you win, I'll stop coming here. If I win, we share the tower." Draco's wand slid out of his sleeve and into his hand. "Do you agree?" Draco said nothing, just flicked his wrist and Harry's hand felt paralyzed, numb with cold. Harry looked down and although his hand looked fine, he couldn't move it to cast a spell. "What did you..."
"Just... just stop talking." Draco was now wishing he hadn't been so worried about Harry and whether or not he would see him tonight because honestly, Draco wished he could be anywhere else in the world right now.
"Okay, stop with the rambling. You're right. I shouldn't ask you to think." Harry opened his mouth to argue but Draco kept going. "I have a bottle of Firewhiskey with our names on it."
make me." Draco felt that familiar singe of Harry's magic. Draco wanted to say he didn't want Harry to take it back he just... He wanted to make sure that Harry was positive. He didn't want to hear Harry say I love you, only for him not to mean it in a couple days... Weeks... Months... Surely they wouldn't last that long. Harry would figure out he didn't like snogging Draco. Maybe he'd figure out he didn't like snogging boys at all and then... Then this will be over and Draco would be all alone again.
"I'm not your arch-nemesis. I'm your boyfriend." Draco said softly. Hearing Draco say this almost got Harry to stop crying.
"It's just something that people have told me over the years." Harry said. "Apparently my father was a... Bit of a bully but, he really liked my mum so he decided to change and that's what made her fall for him." Harry said with a smile. "I think they'd actually really understand us, probably better than most people." Draco almost felt like crying.
"Probably off brooding somewhere." Draco said. Harry snickered. "It's true. I brood in towers a lot."
"Shut up before I punch you in the gut." Draco said, rubbing his temples with is hands and closing his eyes. He could feel a migraine coming on. The scent of Harry's cologne overwhelmed Draco and he knew the idiot boy had stepped closer again. Didn't he realize that if he came any closer, Draco would kiss him again? When Draco opened his eyes, he was staring right into Harry's green irises. He looked completely determined.
"See you in class." Draco mumbled before walking swiftly past him and out the doors of the library. Slowly, Harry turned and walked over to his friends who were anxious to ask what he and Draco had talked about. Harry sat down at the table with them slowly and shrugged.
"Everyone, return your attention to your breakfast." McGonagall instructed but even as Harry and Draco parted from one another, they could feel everyone's attention squarely on them.
"I'm taking you back to the Gryffindor common room before you do something stupid." Hermione said. Ron pulled his arm out of her grasp though and faster than she or Harry could move, Ron had marched right over to the Slytherin's and was standing in front of them, glaring them down.
"I'll try not to Professor." Harry said with a cheeky grin. Draco rolled his eyes and Harry took a deep breath, holding his wand over Draco's outstretched palm. He moved his wrist, practically shouting
"Why should I? I meant it." Pansy said with a slight roll of her eyes. Draco knew she was partly lying which gave him hope. It was actually Blaise that Draco worried about the most. The older boy had become even more distant and restrained since Goyle had died. Draco had tried talking to him about it before but it was like... Draco could feel Blaise's magic leaking out of him in angry waves. Blaise wouldn't even be holding his wand and Draco would be singed by his magic. Sometimes a wizard can be... Just that powerful. Being around Voldemort had felt like that, only on a stronger level. Sometimes when Draco was around Voldemort he felt like he was being burned alive. Sometimes it would leave smoking holes in the clothes of his Death Eaters.
The door was open this time and When Harry stepped into the room, he found Draco sitting completely out of the window, his legs dangling out in open air. He was leaning over so far that Harry thought he might jump. Fear seized his heart for some reason. Harry quickly walked forward and grabbed the hood of Draco's robe. He didn't even look back at him. "Are you fuckin' insane?" Harry demanded.
"We don't know where your precious savior went." Pansy snapped back at them. "Now run along." Hermione saw that Draco was blank faced, staring off at nothing. It was the same dead expression Harry had. She swallowed hard.
"It's the hair." Draco said with a small cough. Harry took the cigarette from him and put it to his lips. Draco watched him inhale lightly, blowing smoke out his nose a little as he exhaled.
"Well my parents aren't going to be like yours." Draco snapped back. Harry sighed and Draco bit his tongue feeling like an idiot. Neither of them knew how Harry's parents might react to this. "I'm sorry. That was... Insensitive."
"He was a brave son of a bitch." Draco said, putting the cigarette to his lips. The lemon scent was comforting.
"I do. Watch." Draco said, his heart skipping a beat in his chest. "Harry Potter!" Draco shouted. The dark haired boy looked up wildly, startled by the sound of Draco's voice. Draco smirked and raised one hand in a slight wave. Harry blushed and Draco watched him swallow hard. Harry slowly raised his hand too and waved slightly. Draco just smirked and looked away. "See?" Draco really wanted to cross the courtyard and kiss his stupid lips and his stupid scar.
"Yeah, I agreed before I remembered what absolute fucking bastards the lot of them all. They act as if we're the ones... I mean it's not our fault Voldemort was from our house. Just because we're Slytherin doesn't mean we're bad." Pansy said. Blaise snickered.
"But do we have to announce it to your whole family? Blimey that's dramatic." Harry muttered. Ginny laughed and slowly let go of his hand, putting it on his shoulder instead.
"Well, let's go see shall we?" Harry nodded and Ginny leaned in to kiss his cheek one last time before the two of them slowly exited her room and headed downstairs.
"This isn't simple. It's a cure for Dragon Pox. I've never even seen someone with Dragon Pox." Harry said with a frown.
"No it's not." The voice of a small girl whined. "It's not fair! I don't want to be a Slytherin anymore! I don't want it!" The girl burst into a fresh wave of tears and Harry paused at the corner of the hallway, when he finally stumbled upon the scene. A tiny girl with brown hair, that seemed to be defying gravity, was crying into her hands, her Slytherin robe tossed onto the floor in a heap, looking like it had been stepped on several times over. That wasn't what made Harry stop though. What made him pause was the person she was talking to. Knelling on the ground next to her was the one and only, Draco Malfoy.
"There's giant spiders out there?" Draco said, looking startled by the notion. Harry looked at Draco funny.
"Last years Prefect from Ravenclaw?" She exclaimed. Draco hushed her. They were sitting out on the hill just outside of Hogwarts and other students were milling around in the grass, talking. Nobody was exactly near them but he didn't want to draw their attention.
again but Draco might have punched him or something. "After that... I should have left with the remaining students, Blaise did. I think he was too shell shocked to do anything else. But I needed to see if my parents were still... I mean Voldemort probably felt you destroy..." Harry's mouth felt dry. By destroying the diadem, Harry had alerted Voldemort to the fact that Draco had failed. If Voldemort wanted to, he could have just killed Draco's parents as soon as he felt the Horcrux fade. "So understand this Potter, I crossed that courtyard not to join Voldemort but because my parents were there. They were alive and if Voldemort was going to hurt them or try to kill us... I didn't want to have to watch them die or have them watch me... I would have rather it happen all at once."
"I'm fine." Harry said, clearly not fine since he was speaking through his teeth and his magic was burning a hole in his robe. "Come on 'Mione." Hermione slowly walked up towards her friend on the stairs, trying not to stare at Draco as Harry began to head to the top landing. Draco blushed all the way to his ears. Had Hermione heard anything of what they said? If she had, she gave no indication and as the stairs slid into place, Draco watched the two friends step up onto the third floor an continue on down the hallway.
"My fingers are numb which is a good start." Draco held his wand over his hand, muttering an undoing spell. "Try again." So Harry tried again and by what Draco assumed was the hundredth time, his hand finally felt completely numb and went limp against his wrist.
"He's not all he's cracked up to be." Ginny said. George, Ron, and Hermione snickered as Mrs. Weasley told them all to hush up and eat their food.
"I knew it was an acronym but I thought it stood for Brian Young and Owen Buntly." Harry looked at her confused. "You know, the inventors of the first singing fountain." Harry shrugged. She pulled her invitation back. "I thought it was strange that the Ravenclaws would mention them." Harry laughed lightly. Despite not wanting to go, Ron was adamant that he should.
"Malfoy, Potter!" The two boys looked towards the front of the Great Hall, their arms still wrapped around one another. The rest of the Hall was deadly quiet. "If you two are done making a scene, please return to your respectful tables if you would."
"Not here." Draco said in a hard voice. Harry's shoulder's fell a little. "Someone will see." Harry wanted to say,
"Which doesn't mean we're friends Harry. I keep away from you. You keep away from me. I think that would be best." Draco said.
Harry didn't even really know Draco. He only knew the brash, reckless side of him but there was obviously more to Draco than that.
"No. I'll just make sure Pansy's around. At the very least she'll pry him off me if he tries to beat me to a pulp." Draco said. Harry kissed his cheek.
"That wasn't what I was doing!" Draco snapped at him. Harry snickered and Draco kicked him. Blaise didn't seem to notice any of this as he rummaged through his drawers.
Draco was the one who found the threadbare Gryffindor and Slytherin flags and magically hung them to the walls. He was also the one who brought in the scratched, wobbly table, two old comfy armchairs and a dreadfully antique tea set that always sat on the table between the two chairs. "Are we moving in?" Harry had asked with a laugh, watching Draco rearrange the space to his liking.
"Shut up and kiss me." Draco said, which was something Harry also didn't need to be told to do because he was already leaning in. The moment the two of them kissed, there was a beat of silence that was immediately followed by a long, low wolf whistle. Pansy. That
because it makes me feel better about the fact that my boyfriend plays for both teams and could potentially leave me for literally anyone who suits his fancy and..." Draco would've continued but Harry chuckled.
"You? Studying?" Harry wasn't all that surprised honestly. Draco did have some of the best grades in their class. Harry was just being an ass to see if Draco would bite back with something but Draco just stared at him with dead eyes before slowly turning around. "That's it?" Harry said.
"Whatever. The bastard should have never showed his face. I don't trust what he told Harry, that he's done or tired or whatever bullshit." Ron scoffed and stood. Hermione sighed and stood as well, slowly trailing after him as Ron walked away.
." Draco said, waving his wand over the top of Harry's head. the spell washed over him and Harry immediately warmed. He smiled a little.
"If Ron were here, I'm sure he'd think I'd done something to you, slipped you a love potion or casted some sort of spell on you." Draco said watching Harry pick up a sandwich and bite into it.
"I'm going to be late for class." He said simply, turning away from Harry and heading out of their Charms class.
"W-where did you get Firewhiskey?" Harry said. It was his favorite thing to drink. It had actually been his first magical drink at Hogwarts. Maybe thats why he loved it so much.
at me like that." Draco snapped back at him. Harry sighed and with a sweep of his cloak, Draco disappeared down the stairs.
"Sorry, Ron caught me sneaking out." Draco flicked some ashes off his cigarette towards the corner of the room before putting it back to his lips. Harry dropped to the floor and sat next to Draco, shoulder to shoulder.
"What? I'm just saying what everyone is thinking." Ron snapped at her. "Right Harry? Back me up here." Ron looked to Harry who sighed heavily, running one hand through his hair. Why was Ron being difficult? Why couldn't he just grudgingly accept, like Harry had, that Malfoy and his friends were definitely not up to something for once this year. Then again, Harry hadn't told Ron or Hermione about his talk with Draco not two days ago up in the tower. He didn't see the point in telling them really.
"You do tend to ramble." Draco said. Harry sighed. "Alright, hit me with it." Draco said, trying to appear unfazed.
"What did you say?" Harry demanded. Pansy stood her ground. Even Blaise was so shocked by what she said that he had let go of her.
"Come to the tower tonight and find out." Draco said with a smirk, walking away. Harry found himself blushing a little and hoped other people weren't staring at them. They might start to wonder about the two of them and Harry didn't want rumors to start swirling around when he had barely begun to figure out his feelings on his own.
"Ah right, I forgot how fuckin noble you are. Silly me." He grumbled. "If Voldemort had tried to kill me... I wouldn't bother coming back." Draco said. Harry swallowed hard.
lie to us!" Hermione shouted. "Come back to Hogwarts right now or I'll make you Harry Potter! I'll drag you kicking and screaming." Hermione said, eyes bleary with tears.
"Why would I douse perfectly good cigarettes with a love potion?" Draco demanded, slowly tearing a roll into pieces and eating it.
"Well shit." Ron said. Mrs. Weasley glared at him. "Mum was really hopping you would join the family."
"Draco it's okay. He died remember?" Harry said. Oh. That's why Draco looked paler than usual, holding Harry's arm in a death grip. Harry turned to face Draco. There was another howl and Draco flinched.
"You were the one chugging firewhiskey. I think I should be asking you that. Why else would you kiss your arch-nemesis?" Harry said. Draco snorted.
"We'll just have to get her to leave." Ron said. Without waiting for a reply, Ron marched over to them. Draco saw them approach but didn't acknowledge their presence.
"I thought you kept better tabs on me than this Potter." Draco said. Harry's ears burned which could only mean he was blushing bright red. Harry hoped Draco couldn't tell in the dim lighting. Draco's eyes trailed back out the open window as he put the cigarette back to his lips. He put his head back on the stone wall behind him, one leg swinging lazily out in the open air. Harry wanted to tell him to stop, that he might fall but then he wondered why he would care about Draco falling. "Can I help you?" Draco asked, blowing smoke out the window before slowly shifting his gaze back to Harry who had been nervously shifting his weight around on the balls of his feet.
The Eighth Year Ravenclaws were throwing a party. Harry never pegged Reggie as a partier but he was apparently the one who was throwing it altogether. Only the eighth years had been told and the Ravenclaws had even gone so far as putting a binding spell on the invitations so only Eighth years could talk about it to other Eighth years. "How did they even do that?" Harry asked Luna.
"Oh my god will both of you shut up." Ron said. He was standing closer to them now with an expression that was a weird mix of anger and confusion. "What is this? Friendly banter?" Ron demanded. Draco shrugged.
"Yeah, I know and it's not even... I don't even really think it's Pansy he's mad at he just hates the whole of Slytherin House now." Harry said. Draco snorted and opened his book.
"If you haven't killed me in the past seven years Draco, I doubt you're going to do it now." Harry said.
"I never thought he would be able to." Draco muttered. "You're fucking Harry Potter. Some nasty, old wizard wouldn't be able to kill you. If anyone was going to do that, it would be me." Harry's lips twitched up in a slight smirk. Draco swallowed hard.
spiders. What the fuck does that even mean?" Draco said in disbelief. Ron almost laughed at the look on Draco's face.
"So it's a guy..." Neville said. "That significantly lowers the pool of people to choose from." Everyone arched an eyebrow at Neville. "Well first we've narrowed it down to the guys and there are significantly less guys at Hogwarts than there are girls and we can narrow it down further to that small group of people who have come out and there we have it." Neville said.
"Yeah, it'll be fun." He leaned in to kiss Draco but he put his hand on his shoulder and stopped him from coming closer. Harry paused.
started... Kissing like a week ago Ron. We're not doing anything up in that tower other than talking, smoking..."
"It's a miracle. You two didn't die." Harry said softly. "I don't think I should try to test our luck though." Harry said, standing and gathering his things.
"Oooo what a lovely smelling concoction!" The professor exclaimed, coming to their table and wafting some of the scent from the cauldron into her face. "Did you two add mint?" Draco nodded curtly. "Oh very clever." She leaned in over the cauldron a little more and whispered, "I don't like the smell of Dragon Pox Cure either." She smiled. "Great work you two." Harry grinned over at Draco as she walked away.
“Ah, yes, the matter of his actions during sixth year, I’ll let you know that he wasn’t the only person that almost killed someone that year. If you were to convict him of attempted murder you’d do well to convict myself as well. We were young and stupid, still are. He was coerced by Voldemort, his father was in prison, and Voldemort had taken up residence in his home. He hated that he was ordered to kill Dumbledore, the stress left him alone and unable to reach out for help. I witnessed him having a breakdown from the pressure he was feeling.”
Draco instead looked to his watch, which sat upon his nightstand. It was battered and cracked, but it was his. He picked it up, almost tenderly, and clasped it around his wrist.
Draco had not expected such a long answer, and could think of no appropriate response, so he merely nodded his head in vague agreement.
Draco was a little anxious about being alone with Harry, especially when there was going to be drinking involved. An entire bottle of champagne between the pair of them could go a long way if Draco let himself be carried away. If he let himself lose control, he might say something damning… something he wouldn’t be able to take back. But who was he to deny Harry? And anyway, he had no excuse to do so without Harry picking up on the fact that he was purposely avoiding him.
Draco smiled, then grabbed his bathroom bag and left the room, leaving Harry to finish the grading he had started the night before.
“I have no reason to object, though I expect a bit more of a formal greeting of your new boyfriend sometime in the future. Preferably the near future.” She smiled.
“Do you know what she’s saying?” Draco asked, desperate for anything that might indicate what would happen to his mother.
Draco was taking forever to pack the morning they had to leave. Harry had packed up everything from the bedroom and his classroom a few days before, leaving only the necessities out. It was oddly put together of him. Mature. Like he was an adult now. That was a scary thought.
The meeting was over just in time for a small late lunch and then Harry and Hermione set off to get their classroom ready for the new term.
As some of you have likely realized, we are reaching the end here. There are three chapters left; Appie’s chapter for this week and then the two epilogue chapters that will be coming out on Christmas! It’s crazy to think about (at least for me).
“It’s not for you, it’s for any nosy people that might see us and want to talk shit about me. I have to at least look good. I can’t believe you got the auror detail away for the day.”
“Seems is the keyword there. She’s still bitter that I wasn’t a girl. You know, she only wanted one daughter. Instead she ended up with six sons first. My younger sister was all she ever wanted, and she likes each of us less and less the further down the line you go. I bet she’s loving having Ginny as her only child now.”
“Well, it happened so recently and you had today to focus on, and I didn’t know how you would react, so I just kind of left it out of my letters.”
“A bit. But mostly because I’ve got an interesting lesson planned for the eighth years this morning.” Harry replied ominously.
He wondered how much Potter could actually see, without his glasses. He had heard that Potter was nearly blind without them, but he had made it to the window just fine. So perhaps that had simply been one of the many false rumors that had gone around about Harry over the years.
Draco directed this thoughts elsewhere and leaned into his boyfriend’s shoulder. They were sitting outside together beneath a great hanging willow. It offered them both privacy and a clear view of the lake and forest beyond. The sky was a bright, brilliant blue void of any clouds. And how was it that Draco had never noticed how lush and vibrant the grass was before? It was as though in these past few weeks the world had grown ten times more beautiful.
He landed in the atrium of the Ministry and made his way down to the courtrooms before anyone could spot him. At Draco’s trial it had helped that he had made an entrance, today it was important to actually be on time. It would hopefully make Draco worry less.
Harry had no idea what to do so he just let Draco squeeze his hand until the movie finished. Every so often Draco would let go for a few seconds to get his napkin and wipe butter and salt from the popcorn off his other hand, but he’d immediately return his hand to Harry’s. Once the final credits rolled Draco finally seemed to notice that he was still holding Harry’s hand.
She leaned forward, resting her clasped hands upon her desk. “So, with your trial coming up, how are you feeling?”
So, when Pansy arrived to drag Draco off to the party, he didn’t say a single word to Ron, who was lying in his bed, sending pictures of his forehead to some poor girl on Snapchat.
Harry led the students over to the side of the room which was allotted for practical magic. There were dueling mats with warded barriers that would prevent people from flying across the room and would alert Harry and Hermione if someone was seriously injured.
By the time they had reached the changing rooms, the rest of the team was already in their gray and purple Quidditch robes. The team went in to change and gathered in the middle for Draco to give them a pep talk.
“You’re late for work.” Pansy said. She sat up slightly and reached out to grab Draco’s hand in hers with a small squeeze. A way of saying
It was nice, having someone run their fingers through Draco’s hair gently. She wished she hadn't found out like this, but still, it felt good. Harriet was skilled with haircare apparently, more than anyone would have guessed based on the state of her own.
Ron didn’t respond, just tossed the paper back at her. It managed to hit her right in the middle of her forehead.
Draco was beyond screwed. She decided to play it cool, something she had learned to do over the many years spent with her father.
Evie was the most terrifying woman she had ever met. Short in both stature and temper, she held a fire in her eyes that could melt the arctic and enough ice in her veins to freeze over hell. She also just so happened to be the Head Healer in St. Mungos.
In the seat next to him, Harry stared at the wall and absent-mindedly fiddled with her hair. "How in bloody hell can you sit like that?" For good measure Ron gestured at her legs.
meant for it to go there,” he said, sounding incredibly proud. She huffed in annoyance. Ron was a keeper, that has more to do with hand eye coordination then being seeker. She knew of course arguing was a moot point, seeing as Ron was probably already aware of this and just trying to lighten the mood. Whether or not it worked was up for debate. Harry was definitely distracted from her intense want to pass out, even if only for a couple of seconds.
They had managed to apparate back to the ministry before four-thirty with three new cases to write up, four to close, and one to pass over to the improper use of magic office. Of all the days Harry could have used a slow day, the universe gave her one of the busiest in her career.
The blood seeping in between her fingers registered in her brain numbly, but it took her back hitting the marble floor for her nerves to start singing. Suddenly everything ached. The warm pools of blood trailing down her stomach, the bruises sure to bloom across her back from her fall, the sharp pain where her skin had been cut open. Where it still was.
“It's the curse of being in a happy marriage, you slowly morph into one being. Pretty soon you’ll have one best friend with two bodies.” Harry snorted as the two of them headed towards where it was safe to apparate.
Harriet opened the door on her second round of frantic knocking. (Her messy hair and crooked glasses and a baggy t-shirt and lightning shaped scar and emerald eyes and
"Right so-" She turned suddenly and now he was desperately dodging staff. Sharp was either weaving easily through the crowded and narrow hall or they were moving out of her way. Ron was not given such treatment. He nearly knocked over a wizard carrying a tray with a fizzy looking potion on it.
She can’t make up some other stupid excuse for how tired she was if Rodger confirmed she was here. She really needs to stop admitting things to him before she has coffee.
really worried.” He leaned forward now, coming even closer and Harry was burning. Her nails were digging into her inner arm. The sharp pain was grounding.
Harriet let go and gently led her inside but the embers didn't go out. She laced their fingers together and Draco burned with her.
She reached to grab her wand, which was next glasses, off the nightstand. She left them there and waved her wand lazily to check the time. It was hard to read without her glasses on, the number already smudgy in the dark without the help of the lens flairs and blur that came from her poor eyesight, but she managed to make out the faintly glowing numbers.
"Evie Sharp, Head Healer." When neither Harry nor Ron moved to shake her hand, she pulled it back. "Right," she said more to herself then to them, "let's get this going." Then Sharp spun on her heel, robes and hair fanning out behind her and marched off.
("Your hair is so much less- it's texture is so different from mine. I've been cutting my hair since I was a kid, Aunt Petunia refused to take me to get one. The first spell I wanted to learn was one for haircuts once I got to Hogwarts.")
The smoke and flames leaked through into her voice, and she knew he heard it. That edge, the mixture of anger and dejectedness and weariness she tried so hard to keep inside her. They stared into each other’s eyes and Harry knew he could tell she was lying. Ron muttered under his breath and rolled his chair back to his desk. She knew the day would come when he (or Hermione for that matter) would refuse to drop this. The day she would spill her guts. The day they would stare at their mess of a best friend and wonder why they even bothered to try.
“In a wine glass? My-my Draco, you’re taking this worse than I thought.” Draco gave a vague hand gesture she hoped conveyed something similar to ‘go away’. If Draco had succeeded at communicating what she wanted, Pansy gave no indication of it. Instead she sighed and sat down next to Draco.
“Finally...freedom!” He stretched his arms over his head and leaned back in his chair. Harry balled up an abandoned note card and chucked it at him. She ignored the “Oi!” from Ron as the paper hit him.
“Do you want to join me for dinner?” Harry nearly jumped, she had certainly not been expecting that. Ron wasn’t really the type to just gloss over her angry outbursts and move on. If anything, he was prone to getting angry right along with her.
When Draco was young, her mother would put her to bed with a reminder. It never changed from night to night, always a whispered bit of advice into her ear. It was a survival tactic, a habit, a coping mechanism. She would lose her mind if she had to spend another day throwing a pity party. She’d take any work she could get her hands on at this point, any source of normalcy she could steal. If she closed her eyes she could feel her mother’s cold breath against her ear,
He and Harry sat in one of the waiting rooms. Every time someone walked by Ron sat up straighter, trying to look more Auror-like, in case they were the staff member they were waiting on.
“Harriet Potter, the youngest Hogwarts seeker in a century everybody.” Ron looked like he was trying not to laugh as he spoke, louder than normal and in a poorly done American accent. She scoffed at him. Their desks, while side by side, were practically on top of each other, with only a half a foot between the ends of them at most. Picking up the paper, she aimed for his head and tossed it.
She had stopped casting spells over Draco’s head, simply running her fingers through it. Checking for something, Draco guessed. The length or layers or whatever. Draco only knew how to style her hair, she couldn't be expected to understand the specifics of what Harriet was doing.
(Even though Ron insisted he could handle the food this time, he spent a solid two minutes coughing after the first bite. Harry was unable to help during those two minutes, because she was laughing so hard her stomach hurt.)
(His footsteps sounded like Potter's. Draco was wearing her Slytherin uniform. Why hadn't Snape come to save her yet?)
She dyes her hair platinum even after her transition. Until she builds up the courage and doesn’t. Draco learns to regret it when she stops. She gets a reminder of why she did in the first place.
Draco hadn't thought about her father in a month. She was healing, she was getting better, she didn’t make impulsive and stupid decisions just to distance herself from him now. She wore her hair down without thought, stopped dying it. She could wear short sleeves again, see the ugly red mark of her skin and not flinch.
"It's- I just...my hair- you've- I remember, you cut your own and I- my…I-" She stumbled through her words, trying to voice her thoughts.
She couldn’t make sense of herself, but she was trying to explain it anyway. "...please." She finished weakly.
Either Draco’s breakdown was a lot less internal than she thought, or Evie was really good at reading her, because Evie's grip on her shoulder tightened reassuringly. She wasn’t sure which was worse.
. She felt buzzed with energy despite herself. While her exhaustion from yesterday was gone, she knew she couldn't just
" His voice was a mess of garbled noise and echos, but his words were somehow clear. She didn’t respond, just continued her painful crying quietly. He shoved her wand back into her hand.
The woman was short, her lime green robes seeming just slightly too large on her. "Sorry for the wait, I wanted to do this myself." She said as she continued to speed walk towards them. Coming to an abrupt halt a foot or two away, she shoved her hand out towards them.
Harry, with one leg thrown over the armrest, the other folded beneath her and half slumped over, looked appalled. "I could say the same to you!" She sat up slightly more as she spoke but made no move to change anything else.
Sometimes Draco wished she could go back to the summer she turned eleven. She was still Altas then, and was starting to feel wildly uncomfortable in her own body, but despite that it was one of the most carefree and happy times in her life. The excitement of getting ready to go to Hogwarts, of being sorted into her house (which would most definitely be Slytherin thank-you-very-much) , of making new friends, and of course meeting the famous and elusive Harriet Potter.
welcome back y'all!! i know not a lot of people have read this but those that left kudos and subscribed, thank you so much! this chapter isn't quite into the drarry part yet but don't worry it's coming soon ;)
“Nah, the paperwork will always have you trapped,” she said, trying to catch the paper as Ron threw it back at her. She missed.
Before she left she turned back to Evie and asked for her flask back. She was trying to joke, but it was forced and they both could tell.
It was a losing battle, Draco knew it was. “Shouldn’t you want me to be at work? Seeing as you’re my supervisor and all.” There was another thump as more files landed on her desk.
Sure enough, mere seconds later, her fireplace burst into life. Pansy emerged from the flames with the same air of confidence as a hunter finally catching its prey. Despite her supposed-to-be-comforting mind-healer robes, she looked murderous. Pansy rolled up the sleeves of her robes before crossing to stand directly opposite where Draco was slouched on the couch with her arms crossed angrily.
"I'd love to." Harriet said into Draco’s collarbone. She was warm where Draco wasn’t. Draco was being hugged by a fire and she thought for a minute she could feel the embers under her skin.
“I know you slept at your desk again.” He said it with a tired sigh, like he knew this wasn’t the last time he would have to have this conversation. “Roger told me,” he tacked on as an afterthought and
No questions about why she felt spikes of anxiousness and despair whenever some called her ‘young man’ or ‘boy’ came to her mind. Any sign of flaws were hidden behind the immaculate and vast walls of the Malfoy manor. Maybe she wasn’t all that happy then after all, but if she was she didn’t know.
this fic is actually just me furthering my "ron is a good friend, why yall hate on him so much" agenda
They sat like that, side by side, in silence for what felt like years. Pansy kept glancing at Draco, clearly trying to say something without having to use words. Both of them were bad with emotions but they were both even worse when it came to putting emotions into words.
Her shift at St. Mungo’s started in less than ten minutes, yet Draco was sitting on her couch reminiscing and regretting with a glass of firewhisky almost empty in her grasp. Pansy was bound to come hunt her down any second, she was a stickler for punctuality. Draco normally arrives at least an hour before she's actually supposed to be there, a fact that Pansy was
Draco tried not to show her surprise at this action on her face, numbly letting Pansy take the wine glass from her hand and setting it on the coffee table. Pansy leaned back on the couch, a somewhat saddened look on her face.
"Yeah," she chuckles awkwardly, "yeah okay." Harriet raises an eyebrow at her, a smirk dancing across her face. "Okay, yeah." She says it like a taunt, it's supposed to be a taunt.
Sleep used to come easily to her. Harry could remember how many times she had gratefully sunk into a bed and fell asleep once her head hit the pillow. Even when she was forced to sleep on the hard ground, or in her cramped cupboard, she could close her eyes and drift off quickly.
imma try to update sooner but god has cursed me for my hubris and my work is often left unfinished for long periods of time until I remember it existed
"Yeah?" Draco didn't sound as close to crying as she had an hour ago, but it still creeped into her tone.
“...Alright,” her eyes fell back onto the file still waiting to be filled on her desk, “ and what about my paperwork?” Ron was swaying back and forth on the balls of his feet now, like some kind of ginger, freckled, rocking chair. “It’ll still be there after you’ve slept a proper amount and actually eaten something.”
The old grandfather clock in her living room rang out seven times. It had been a Christmas present from her mother a few years back, right before they both left the Malfoy Manor behind for good.
Ron chuckled slightly. “We could ask ‘mione to invent one, she’d enjoy the challenge.” There was a pause. It was Harry who said what they were both thinking.
“Thanks.” she practically whispered to Ron. Thank Merlin that day was not today. He tilted his head in a form of acknowledgement as he waved his wand across his desk, sending his stack of papers to their respective files.
“You’ve been avoiding this all day Harry. I can’t just...not bring it up.” Ron wheeled his chair closer to her. There weren’t many other Aurors at their desks that were near them, but even so his voice was low and soft. He knew she hated things like this. Harry looked away from him and crossed her arms over her chest defensively.
Harry chuckled at that, then immediately shaped her hands over her mouth to silence it. As she did she waved her wand towards the witch and said a spell under her breath, clearly fighting not to laugh while doing so.
Draco wasn’t two steps into her office before Evie pounced on her. “Malfoy, what on earth are you doing here?” She practically tore the door off its hinges with her vigor. Draco, flask halfway to her mouth, paused.
The world seemed determined to force Harry through her sleep deprivation problem. Running on barely two hours of sleep wasn’t ideal for her, even less so when she and Ron have an active day of field work. Chasing after a perp felt more taxing when she had to fight to keep her eyes open seconds before. Despite the odds being stacked against her she managed to stay mostly awake for the entire day, excluding the nap she took during her lunch break instead of eating. Ron offered help by talking when it looked like she was nodding off.
“Go home,” she said, her voice forceful. She took a sip from the flask and grimaced, muttering under her breath about cheap vodka. Draco’s hand darted out to reclaim her flask but was met with air as her boss jumped back.
Ron let out a breathy laugh. Another healer walked by and he straightened up again, but they kept walking. He could feel Harry looking at him and knew she had judgmental laughter in her gaze. He turned back to look at her and was just about to comment 'How long could it possibly take to get one healer' when another staff member walked by. This time though, they headed straight for Ron and Harry.
Harry started again once order had been restored, “I was asked to come here to give my thoughts on Draco Malfoy, so I will do as such without interruptions if you please.
He took another step forward and stopped yet again. What was the point? Harry surely wouldn’t accept him. Draco knew who he was and he wasn’t worthy of Harry, not in the slightest. He was Draco Malfoy, a convicted criminal, a death eater, the son of a death eater... a coward. And yet, Harry had protected him anyway, been on his side anyway.
Harry turned over slowly, looking up at Draco with bleary eyes. Draco wondered if Harry had been crying. Draco waited for Harry’s response, the seconds dragging on into minutes and Draco began to fear that Harry wouldn’t respond at all.
“So from your references and your application I can tell you’re a good guy and that you want to work here. I have a good sense when it comes to trusting people. And honestly you’re the first person that’s applied that has previous work experience in the food business. So start by telling me about that.”
Harry sat up, it was Draco Malfoy. He was supposed to be roommates with his rival. The sorting hat definitely had a cruel sense of humor.
“I mean it’s not like we haven’t cohabitated before, and we’ve been together for nearly a year now, and I finished cleaning up the townhouse in the summer, it does get a bit lonely there sometimes, I just thought...” Harry rambled.
The four as a group made their way back to their dorms. The girls walked hand in hand in front of Harry and Draco, every so often Pansy would glance back behind herself at them, then whisper to Hermione and the two would giggle.
Harry had been completely oblivious to how soon the trial was, considering that he was speaking at it.
A few times over the past five months, Jess had offered to bring him and his mum to see his dad in Azkaban, but while his mum had gone, Draco had always declined. Until today. Draco had finally plucked up the courage to go and visit him.
“I might ask him out later this week.” Harry mumbled, then shoved a bite of pasta into his mouth to avoid saying any more.
It was like everything that had been pressing Draco down had lifted and he could finally move freely. The secret was out, everyone who he and Harry were together, and his mum hadn’t been sent to Azkaban. Draco could focus on the things that had been important to him before all of those horrible things had happened; his classes and Quidditch.
Well he supposed he did, but the prospect was a bit daunting. Malfoy liked him, he had written proof.
“Those who say guilty of attempted murder. Those who oppose. The opposition has it, Draco Malfoy is not guilty of three counts of attempted murder.” Draco finally released his breath. Maybe he would be alright after all.
Draco was about to turn away when his eyes caught on a startling pair of green eyes. They belonged to the same boy he had encountered a few other times since moving into his dorm. The boy had messy dark hair and was quite attractive. He was with that same girl as always and Draco idly wondered if they were a couple. It was surprising to find how much that thought upset him. He had barely even had a conversation with him. And he didn’t so much as know either of their names, so he really had no right to be jealous of her, especially when he wasn’t even sure if they were dating.
There was something enchanting about it all. Sure he could hear the sounds of the city a few streets over, but in that handful of blocks that were set aside for the fair, it felt like a little bubble of cider scented air and almost felt like the much smaller town Harry had come from.
Draco had absolutely no idea what that meant, but he resumed walking as he doubted Blaise and Neville would divulge anything of real use. They wished him a goodnight before vanishing into their own dorm room and leaving Draco to walk the rest of the way on his own. He had barely made it two steps when his phone began buzzing from inside his pocket. He pulled it out to see who was calling him at one in the morning, to find his father’s contact photo staring up at him.
“I like hearing your voice too mom. I like my classes just as much as the next person, but they’re a lot of work- more than I was expecting. But it’s manageable. I’m trying to stay ahead of it, and its going quite well so far. I’m happy with my decision to come here, and I’m making friends. I think you’d really like them.” Draco said as he stuffed his laptop back into its bag and slung it over a shoulder. He transferred the phone back into his hand as he strode down the path back towards the dorms so he could drop off the school stuff and pick up his tennis equipment. “But hey, listen, I’ve got tennis practice in twenty minutes, so I can’t talk long.”
The rest of the school year passed in a blur of spring rains, summer air, stolen moments and late nights prepping for N.E.W.T.S. Draco and Harry were busier than ever between their classes, lesson plans and Quidditch practices, they hardly had any time for themselves, let alone each other.
Hermione jetted off to her class and Harry texted Sirius to see if he was free to help grocery shop.
“Once you get it you can let it wander around the room, but if you get tired banish it. I will not be responsible for anyone collapsing from depleted magical energy in this class.” Harry said, glaring pointedly at Neville.
They rode in a comfortable silence watching the lights turn on in the city as the sun set. The lights that were in the trees lining the city streets turned on one by one as the light dimmed, and the band switched over to a slightly less specifically fall themed set.
“Oh god. When I was really little my next door neighbor and I would play princes together and pretended to rescue each other from a “tower” which was his backyard slide.”
He regretted not getting to the cultural clubs area that day, he’d wanted to see if there was an Indian cultural club. He’d always felt distanced from that part of his identity with his dad gone since he was little and the high school he went to wasn’t much for cultural clubs like that.
“Party in the eighth year common room!” Cried Ron and the sixteen students that had gathered to celebrate on the field dispersed to celebrate elsewhere.
I hope you liked it! Be sure to check out Appie’s chapter, and two more chapters will be out next week. Don’t forget to leave us comments and kudos.
Next was an easy win, with their pairing being Ardenth College. It was a mystery to how they’d made it as far as they did without being defeated. Draco didn’t even break a sweat against them. The semifinals had them up against Shade Creek College, whom they beat with only a slight effort on their part. Unsurprisingly, their rivals, Cadence University killed the Malcolm Institute for Architecture and Engineering, bumping them straight into the finals.
“He doesn’t like that I chose to go to school here and not somewhere more ‘prestigious.’ He also hates that I’m trying to get a degree in photography.”
Draco froze, still as a statue, as Potter stood and made his way over to the window. It wasn’t until he sat, that Draco noticed that Potter was shaking. Potter stared out the window for several long moments before rubbing his eyes and casting a silent charm. Draco could only guess what spell had been cast, Potter had gotten so good at the silent ones.
“Yeah. Tonight was my very bad attempt at trying to ask you out. I was just so nervous that you’d say no or I’d fuck up or something that I wasn’t really being specific. I forgot to even tell you what time.”
He had forced Draco to use the cruciatus on both of his parents. Then they had been forced to preform in upon him. For hours and hours the agony seemed to last and then-
He could tell some of the kids had heard of the Slytherin reputation. “No house is better than any other and you will have classes and be able to eat with friends from different houses.”
“Thank you, that will be all. We will now have a brief recess to discuss the verdict. We will reconvene in fifteen minutes.”
Hope you enjoyed! Remember to leave comments and kudos! We’re getting down to the final chapters here and there will be a lot of double updates coming up, so be on the lookout. :)
Before Harry knew what was happening Draco was kissing him. First tentatively, and then with passion. Then it was over and Draco had retreated to the bathroom.
Harry gasped in mock offense, “Are you implying that my date planning skills don’t meet your rich ass expectations?”
Sirius seemed to need the distraction too because he looked very concerned and tired when Harry had asked him about work that day. They parted ways after leaving the store, Sirius saying he needed to go back to the station and finish off some paperwork.
They got through the entire rest of the movie like that. Once it was over and the lights came back on and everyone started to get up and head upstairs, Draco felt like it was time for him to release Harry’s hand. The last thing he needed was for Pansy or Hermione to see them like that.
After Professor McGonagall introduced them to the students in the Great Hall Harry went to take his seat between Hermione and Hagrid’s currently vacated seat at the staff table, how strange that felt, and then he remembered he had something to do. He stood up awkwardly and headed into the chamber where the new first years had now gathered. Hermione gave him an odd look, but he didn’t say anything.
“Do you make a habit of insulting inanimate objects in public?” A voice asked and Draco’s head snapped up. He found Harry standing there, a few feet away from him. Just his luck.
Harry was silent for a moment, then he had an idea, “You think we could write each other over the holidays or something?”
Ron was standing on the dueling mat fooling around with cool dueling poses, none of which were the least bit practical.
At nine on the dot the Ministry witch in charge of the trial started through her spiel. Harry mostly tuned it out, it was pretty much just stuff for the records and he had heard a version of it at every trial he had attended thus far. After that was over the doors banged open and in came Malfoy. He was being escorted by a pair of aurors who stood at a respectable distance from him. Malfoy held his head high and sat in the designated chair. Chains came up and bound his arms and legs.
Harry nodded and headed to the door, almost running into Sirius who was bringing the microwave as the college did not provide those.
Harry got a call just as soon as he figured out how to fit all the groceries into their designated food storage shelf and fridge. It was a local number he thought he recognized so he answered it.
Holy crap this one’s a whopper! Almost 2000 words, and I did it in mainly one sitting. Tay and I couldn’t not include quidditch in this, so we had a lot of fun discussing who would be on the quidditch team.
“This is the part where we would normally go our separate ways.” Draco said, trying to fill the silence.
“Ron!” Draco exclaimed, then screamed when he received no response. Ron looked around, pulling the headphones off his head and ending that horrible sound. He brightened a little when he saw Draco and even more so as Draco invited him to join in on their little competition.
“Yes, and if you don’t mind, I will say my piece and take my leave. I have a one year old grandson at home that I should get back to.”
He jumped when he heard the sound of the compartment door sliding open. His eyes snapped up. There were Blaise and Pansy, standing awkwardly before him.
Harry wasn’t too worried about how Draco had done though, he had been at the top of the class most of the year.
But that was not a problem for now. He had to keep his thoughts to the present. A present in which he was standing beside Harry in the frigid air of the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom, trying to hold a conversation.
“Your drink will be right up.” Harry said gently as he turned away and stared at the coffee maker as it dripped fresh coffee into the pot.
Blaise nodded, “They’ve certainly got the experience and the skill. Otherwise how could they have broken into Gringotts and escaped on a dragon?”
Draco stepped out of the door and smiled. He was gorgeous, he wore a pale blue shirt, buttons done up and neatly pressed. He wore black slacks, his hair done to perfection.
The woman was so sweet, even letting them pick what they wanted to make. After much lighthearted debate among the three of them they decided on cutesy dinosaurs. The woman showed them how to shape the pieces of clay and slip and score them, then she sent them to work, each making two dinosaurs of their choosing. She moved back and forth between them, helping whenever was necessary as they laughed and compared their blobs.
It was well after ten by the time he went down to set up. He snagged the flowers from his classroom and went back up to the dorms.
He was home alone, well alone if he managed to forget about the auror that followed his every step. It was a different auror now than when he had first returned home. This one was a woman, young and far kinder. She had told him that Tonks had been her friend, that they had trained together and even been in the same year at Hogwarts. It had taken him a moment to realize that Tonks referred to his cousin, Nymphadora.
“And he was found guilty of being a death eater. But Potter also said my father didn’t fight in the battle of Hogwarts. He talked about how both of my parents were just looking for me.” Draco explained, “So he was only sentenced to fifteen years in Azkaban before parole, a life sentence, monthly visits allowed. It’ll be easier for him there without the dementors.”
“I was nervous because I sitting next to you.” Draco took a deep breath, “I like you. Like a lot. Like go on a date like you.”
Hermione was already asleep over on the next bed so Harry checked the lock on the door, turned off the lights and fell asleep quickly.
“Oh my, you’re Cissa’s son? I haven’t seen you since your mother sent me baby pictures. I’ve avoided the news like the plague this past year, but I do remember Harry mentioning your trial before. I’m glad to see you’re well.”
His whole head started to buzz, in time with the incessant noise. It was getting to him, making his skin crawl. Finally, he gave in to it. He stalked over to Potter’s side of the room and realized...
He supposed he hadn’t really been a child, well, ever. But he hadn’t thought of himself as an adult until now.
“I can’t- I can’t be sure.” But Draco was a coward, and he had never learned how to lie. Greyback was standing so close to him, staring at him, making him lose his nerve.
Hermione had written something on the whiteboard on the outside of their door. Gone to the club fair, meet up for lunch in the west dining hall. He also saw something stuck to the whiteboard, a sticky note saying that there was going to be a party down in the game room that night, advising anyone who wanted to steer clear to be in their dorms by eight o’clock and anyone attending to be there at eight thirty.
The final group only had three people, so Malfoy decided to put in someone else, “Granger, head up there.”
Harry rang the little bell next to the help wanted sign and out came a fatherly looking man with a green apron on over a Timber Coast hoodie and jeans. “Welcome to the Rise and Grind, how may I help you?” He said.
“I am doing nothing of the sort!” Draco said, indignation written all over his face. “I actually came here incase you were working at Rise and Grind.”
He took a moment to gather himself, before hurrying into the showers. He showered quickly before heading to the Great Hall for some dinner. Pansy, Daphne and Blaise were already there when he arrived. Draco sat down with them and immediately began to spoon greens onto his plate. He wasn’t hungry, his insides were still a mess of nerves, but he knew he needed to eat if he wanted to maintain his skill on the Quidditch pitch.
So that was how this was going to be? Harry smirked and said, “Well just that. Getting robes, what else would you do at a robe shop? I assume either she or Draco or Lucius needed new robes.”
“Ok, Mr. Longbottom, you’re up. Don’t look so worried, this is just like the DA, and since I’m assessing you, you will most likely win.”
“Can’t you just tell me what I got on the Defense exam already?” Draco asked, they’d already had this conversation a dozen times, though Harry had always managed to distract Draco from seeking his grade.
The Headmistress strode in and took a seat. Like with his mother, the chains stayed hidden, and didn’t wrap around her.
Tentatively he opened the door and crept inside. “Professor McGonagall, you wanted to see me?” He asked softly.
He put away his grading, which apparently would have to wait until tomorrow, turned out the light, and fell asleep before he could ponder what Draco had just said.
They chatted as they binged the episodes and drank. By ten o’clock all of Draco’s chocolates were gone and the snack mix bowl was half empty. They had drunk a decent amount of the champagne and had just gotten to the Halloween episode of the cooking show.
There were three shifts for night watch. The evening one extended from the first year’s eight thirty curfew to the eighth year’s eleven o’clock curfew, the prefects and head students covered that shift. The night one went from eleven to three, that one was the hardest to recover from. The last one went from three until the end of breakfast, the meal making up for the extra hour tacked onto the shift. Those two were covered by staff members, which meant Harry. Hermione was head girl, meaning she did the evening shift, but made up for it with more meal watches.
“I was under the impression that I could testify as I please. Therefore I will tell you that I do not believe Draco has committed any serious crimes.” The whole courtroom went up in utter tumult, Potter spoke over the noise and slowly it died away. “I was asked to come here to give my thoughts on Draco Malfoy, so I will do as such without interruptions if you please.” Leave it to Potter to turn an interrogation into some kind of speech. The ministry witch who had been doing all of the questioning thus far leaned back in her seat, nonplused. She waved for Potter to continue speaking.
But be warned, we are both pretty busy so it might be a bit before anything with that can actually happen.
“Wow.” Harry stood there in shock, pausing his work on the study nook he was wiping down, “If only we were allowed to be friends again back then. Who knows where we’d be now.”
He submitted his form, and then drew up a mock schedule for the rest of his week. It would be a bit tight, but once he dropped like two or three of the classes he’d be golden. He looked through some of the flyers he got from the club fair and decided that he’d join the school’s gay pride club at least, probably one of the sports clubs like indoor frisbee or something to make friends.
Hermione must have been tuned into Harry’s internal dialogue because she then said, “Harry, everyone else, including Ron, may be oblivious to the fact that you are not straight, but I figured it out back in fourth year, you had a crush on Krum and one on Cedric. Also it didn’t work out with Ginny and neither of you seemed bothered by it. Also, just for the record, I don’t care, you’re still you, Harry.”
Ron was going to be an auror. Neville had an apprenticeship with a herbologist. Pansy had something journalistic up her sleeve. Blaise already was getting a business up and running. Harry knew Draco hadn’t quite decided what to do yet. Harry took every opportunity to remind Draco that that was okay, every time Draco seemed to relax a little, so Harry assumed the reminders were helping.
When they pulled away, Pansy slipped a piece of paper into Hermione’s hand, “My number in case you want to go out sometime.”
“I, er, I can’t be the team captain, everyone hates me and- what about Potter or, or Weasley?” He asked, pleadingly.
“Yes, I taught him transfiguration for the first seven and now I am his Headmistress and the head of his house.” McGonagall answered coolly.
Harry went and joined his mother, aunt and cousin. A few minutes later they were joined by Sirius and Remus. The two cars caravanned over to the diner that James had always liked.
Once Draco had finished up his exams, there were only nine days left before Draco would ride the Hogwarts Express one final time. It felt strange to think about that, to think how he likely wouldn’t ever return to this place, this place that had raised him, and taught him and let him grow into himself.
Pansy came to the rescue, waltzing up to them and loudly saying, “Harry, could you come check over my analysis of our last auror report? I’m not sure if I got it entirely right.”
“Neither of them have ever shown the slightest inclination towards Quidditch or anything to do with it, I wouldn’t be surprised if neither of them knew all of the rules.” McGonagall said.
Harry smiled, “Quite right. Today we’re taking a bit of a break from the darker side of this class and performing the actual charm. Now, I doubt that any of us will ever encounter a dementor ever again, but it could be on the practical exam, it’s quite an uplifting charm, and we all need some of that right now. If you do encounter a dementor in the future, you’ll need this charm. I know many of you already can do it, or just need a bit more practice so hopefully this will be a pretty easy lesson. If you don’t get it today, first don’t feel bad it’s a pretty hard charm, and if you want more tips come see me or Hermione outside of class. And with that everyone over to the mats, let’s get started.”
“So, my uncles are ridiculous and gifted me a bottle of champagne to celebrate making it halfway through the semester. I was wondering if you wanted to come to my room and split it Friday night. You have your last exam that day too right?”
The rest of March and April passed with a blur. Draco had gone home for the Easter holidays and Harry had made a visit in the middle of the break, to fulfill that ‘proper meeting’ Narcissa had wanted. Going to the Manor was a bit daunting, but it was that or wait out the next eighteen months until Narcissa could leave, which was a terrible idea for many, many reasons.
He set an alarm on his wand and settled in for a quick nap. He had just gotten comfortable when Malfoy entered the room looking distressed.
“He’s right you know.” Said the female auror who had long bushy hair that reminded him vaguely of Hermione.
“Practical, yes, dueling, no.” Harry said, “You can either help or wait outside until class starts.”
The last question brought silence to the room, Malfoy had asked it. That was the first time he had spoken in class since that first day.
