Malfoy offered Harry his arm. “Off we go then,” he said with a dramatic sigh, “unless you want to stand around on my doorstep all day?”
“I feel like I don’t have to force myself to be someone I’m not when I’m around you, you know,” Potter mumbled, “you insult me far too much. No way I could be a hero with you constantly reminding me of my faults.”
For a mix of noble and selfish reasons, he would try to make it work with Ginny. Maybe this weekend with her family might just be enough to rekindle their stagnant romance. Harry very much doubted that it would, but he’d always hoped, and he always would.
I couldn't quite make myself happy with it, but I think it's because I've had to split it up because it just grew too long otherwise. So, let me know what you think about it.
Draco cursed himself for even suggesting that he meet with Potter for dinner. He wasn’t sure what had possessed him. It was a gamble, an attempt to bridge the rift between them but it had been a fool’s desire and he was regretting it immensely. He wondered what Potter would think of him, pacing the empty halls of the manor house, refusing to look any portrait in the eye? There were still rooms he’d rather not enter but that was between him and the hideously ornate wallpaper adorning every wall.
Harry shrugged, slipping out of his robes. He tossed it into the hall behind Draco where It crumpled on the floor, clearly in no mood to do entirely as he was told.
Harry felt guilt blossom in his stomach when he returned to Malfoy Manor. He’d had to leave Malfoy behind as he sniffed around the library for clues. He gave up after a few hours when he found nothing short of a lingering flicker of magic, too volatile to trace. He knocked on the door, irritable and ashamed of himself. He was Harry Potter for God’s sake, he was supposed to be unstoppable. What was he supposed to tell Malfoy?
Malfoy swallowed. “I…I uh,” he cleared his throat, “believe you me, Potter, you’re the last person I’d want round my house.”
Mr Weasley snorted, in the middle of slurping a particularly slippery kind of noodle. He hadn’t said much throughout the dinner. He was more reserved these days, though his eyes still lit up whenever there was something new to learn about the Muggle world.
Draco was at a loss for words. What was he supposed to say to that? He’d always thought Potter to be an arrogant bastard. Perhaps, maybe…maybe he’d been mistaken after all. It wasn’t as if he’d always been right before.
He followed Malfoy through the halls, eyes darting around as he tried not to remember how he was jostled down towards the dungeon.
“You ok?” Harry asked him, trying for serious again. Draco nodded. “I think we should close early for today.”
“I like it out here too,” she said, her arms wrapped around herself to block the slight chill. Harry smiled after he recovered from his surprise and patted the space next to him on the deck.
“Harry,” Draco reached an arm out before he realised what he was doing, recoiling to clasp his fingers on the table, “it’s been four days, soon to be five. That’s a working week. You can’t honestly be expecting people not to worry about you.”
“I’ll be there in a minute!” Came Blaise’s cry, then, “Draco, your stupid house-elf tried to steal my shoes again!”
Draco heard a ticking clock and the sound of his own breathing, but nothing human, just stale remnants, ghosts. He wrapped his arms around himself, conscious of the fact nobody was there to watch him.
“Right, sorry.” Harry worried his lower lip. “It’s just, you know why Ginny and I are, you know, and, of course, you don’t have to, but I thought—”
“Oh, look at the time, I’d best be going Potter.” Malfoy pushed away his chair, draining the last drops from his cup. He slammed his part of the bill down upon the table. His features softened slightly. “It was nice seeing you here, without all the fame that usually follows you.”
The waitress reappeared with a dainty teacup, placing it gently in front of Malfoy. She smiled as she provided the teapot too, tucked underneath a jolly looking patchwork tea cosy. It was the kind of thing they’d have back at the Burrow. Harry cringed, shrinking into himself.
He relaxed his arms around his Goddaughter, her very presence enough to make him forget his own fears. “I can’t promise that I’ll always get it right, Theodora,” Harry whispered, “but I’ll try, and you correct me whenever you need, ok, Ted?”
A clumpy piece of Carbonara smacked against his nose and Draco yelped. He narrowed his eyes when Harry started laughing, clamping a hand over his mouth.
Draco forced an uneasy smile, waiting until she’d disappeared out of view before he doubled over, gasping. He stood to his full height, staring down at his hand. It was shaking, ever so slightly, but noticeably nonetheless.
Malfoy manor sent shivers running down Harry’s spine. He’d promised himself he’d never come back there – too many unpleasant memories. Unpleasant didn’t really cover it, if he were being perfectly honest. ‘Unpleasant’ was better than the truth.
The Burrow was Ginny’s family. If Harry were to leave her, he hoped that he was wrong, but he feared they would abandon him, side with their daughter instead. He couldn’t lose his family. They were too important to him.
He watched as Potter’s green eyes fixated upon nothing. “I never liked the fame you know,” he said quietly, “you always had that wrong. I hated it.”
“You could’ve at least sent a letter!” There we go. “All I knew was that you’d apparated off somewhere, drunk, to Merlin only knows where, and—” she paused, anger fading into something thoughtful, “where did you go?”
Ron's support was quieter, but in that way, he was like their glue. Without him, they'd fall apart, as they did in the woods all those years ago. Harry had been most afraid of losing Ron over this, but as it turned out, he seemed to be the person most likely to stick around.
Grimmauld was the same as he’d left it, though the wine had been cleared from the table. Harry sighed, making his way over to the kitchen where he set about making himself a coffee. The kettle wheezed, vibrating slightly.
The two men watched her walk, though glide was probably a better word for it, to join Blaise at the gates, staring as they left without even a wave behind them.
“Under the stairs.” His voice was quiet now and he looked at the floor. “I didn’t even have a proper Birthday until I was eleven, and that was only thanks to Hagrid. Plus, Dudley ate the cake he’d brought me.”
He straightened his tie, sucking in a deep breath. He tried to keep his features blank. “Potter,” he said, “you’re late.”
Even if Harry could push his love deep down, sure, but he couldn’t quite shake how much he wanted to push him up against a wall, be pushed against a wall. He wasn’t fussy, but he wanted Draco, to taste him. He bet he tasted of something like cinnamon, all sweet and bitter, addictive. Harry almost groaned as he poured his drink, narrowly avoiding spilling it onto the countertop instead.
Draco licked his lips, clasping his hands together. “Do you think,” he squeezed his eyes shut, praying he didn’t sound too needy, “that you could teach me?”
Once inside, Malfoy leant back against the desk, shoving his hands deep into his pockets. He gestured for Harry to take the seat opposite.
Draco shrugged. “Force of habit.” Did Draco just half-apologise? “She leave you all alone, did she?”
It was Malfoy’s answering grin that sent Harry’s heart soaring. He felt safe here too, acknowledged for more than just the mantle thrust upon his shoulders.
Harry folded his arms, huffing a breath. “Next, you'll be telling me that Hobbits were real all along.”
Potter shrugged, shoving his hand into Draco’s. Potter’s palm was warm, calloused, intertwining snuggly with Draco’s. It felt nice, to have human contact again, even if it were Harry Potter of all people. Without fully comprehending what he was doing, Draco brushed his thumb across Potter’s smooth knuckles. He heard Potter hitch a breath and snapped to his senses, as if struck. He coughed lightly, feeling his own cheeks grow warm.
“It’s not important,” Harry mumbled. Except for the fact that it was. Shit, he'd always been bad with words.
“Sir?” a squeaky voice called out from behind him. Draco looked round to find his house-elf, Keesy, anxiously staring up at him in the doorway with her large blue eyes. He smiled softly, crouching down so that he was eye-level with her.
Potter swallowed, considering what Draco was asking. “No,” he admitted, “and I’d rather not talk about it now, either. I just want to be myself for once.”
Please do let me know what you think, I appreciate comments or kudos if you think it's deserving. Hope you're all doing well!
Draco nodded, worrying his lip.  Circe, he’d been so cruel. To think that he’d been jealous of a boy who didn’t even know what his own name meant. He wished, now more than any other time, that he hadn’t grown up in such a pureblood home, that he’d been exposed to more than just traditional values. Maybe if he’d been muggle-born, maybe if he’d been kinder, maybe if he’d learned how to cook…
Harry thought about it, considered telling her. But he shook his head. He couldn’t be sure. “No,” he said, “not yet.” 'Yet' was the keyword here.
“Of course,” Draco said, then wished he hadn’t. His voice had sounded so soft, it was almost sickening. There was no way Harry couldn’t be able to see right through him. Draco shook himself; this wasn’t about that, about him. This needed focus.
“I’ll be here when you get back,” Draco continued, “but they won’t. Not if you stay here without even a word.”
Harry could tell that Ron was about to deny it, but Hermione shoved past her husband and threw her arms around Harry’s neck.
“Merlin give me strength.” Draco pinched the bridge of his nose and turned his attention to the ceiling. He opened his eyes to find Potter furiously flicking through the pages of the book, a shit-eating grin plastered across his features.
“Oh, stop sulking Potter,” Malfoy chastised, like he was speaking to a petulant child in the middle of a meltdown, “you weren’t my first choice either.”
“Yeah,” Harry said, somewhat awkwardly, “I guess…it’s complicated. But he’s nothing like when we knew him before. I think he’s changed a lot.”
Draco wasn’t so sure. Still, with Harry’s arms, slipped down to squeeze his middle, he felt ready to believe him, just a little.
Hope you enjoyed it, please let me know what you think. I'm a simple writer, comments really help me keep going.
Draco looked up. “…It really did hurt.” Harry raised an eyebrow. “I’m being serious. Alright. Perhaps, I was a tad overdramatic,” Harry snorted, “but I implore you, it really did hurt.”
Potter was in a relationship. He was happily, incredibly happily by the looks of things, in love with Ginny Weasley. But…in the library, Draco was sure that there was something else, in the air, some cliched spark between them. Potter would never act on that of course, he was far too noble, Draco doubted he'd even felt it but the way his cheeks were flushed, his green eyes huge…Draco had promised himself this wouldn’t happen again. Not this quickly.
Draco scowled. “Give me that.” He lunged for the book, but Potter easily snatched it away, grinning like the idiot he was.
Harry blinked, dazed at the gravel beneath his feet. It had been a whirlwind, everything had happened so fast. He hadn’t even had time to register half of what Malfoy was suggesting he do.
The topic of conversation was inevitable, but Harry nonetheless found himself unprepared for just how quickly it arose. George brought it up first.
The girl nodded, biting her lip in what looked to be disappointment. Draco felt a little bad. It was his job to know things like this, to encourage readers to seek what they loved. He just found magic in muggle literature to be a little, well, he didn’t want to say offensive…
Harry shrugged, smiled, nodded. “Though,” he said, “I’m still not sure why you did challenge Buckbeak?”
Draco rolled his eyes. “I was a bratty thirteen-year-old. Not exactly one you’d call an evil mastermind.”
Harry nodded, biting his lower lip. Maybe there wasn’t a threat, in the three days he’d been here, Harry hadn’t noticed anything out of the ordinary, but maybe what Malfoy needed was security, something to make him feel safe. Harry knew what that was like.
Harry just stared. The light caught Malfoy’s blond hair as he furrowed his brow in concentration. It was like he was performing some important task. What a prick, always had to make a show of everything.
A pointed glare. “Isn’t it obvious?” Potter frowned, and Draco sighed, defeatedly. “Harry, you’d just effectively tamed a mythological beast in front of the entire class. Of course, I was going to try and do the same thing.”
“Oh Harry, dear,” Molly fussed, brushing stray hairs away from his eyes, “do you ever tidy your hair?”
“Your mental health is at risk,” Harry decided then that he’d make a leap to sit cross-legged on the desk, narrowly avoiding a collision with the computer monitor, “that counts as your safety.”
Another half-apology: not much happens in this chapter, plotwise, but I split it into two, and the next one is kinda plot-heavy. So, consider this a lighthearted break :)
“Ah yes Potter, because the ministry would just give into my demands for a bodyguard with absolutely no reservations.”
He led them down a side road aligned with trees, a sprinkling of autumn leaves coating the pathway.  “Just checking,” Potter said, “we
Potter ruffled his hair, desperately trying to disentangle the imaginary leaf. “Is it gone?” Draco nodded. Oh Merlin, it was happening again. Pansy would have a field day.
“Oh,” Harry said, scratching the back of his neck, “right.” He looked around him, trying to find, to be honest Draco wasn’t sure what he was trying to find. Harry’s cheeks were reddening fast, and he was knocking papers out of the way in his haste to find whatever he was looking for.
“However,” Draco said, standing to his feet and brushing himself down, “I’m going to bed. You should too. It’s late.”
Harry turned to look at her and the surprise must have registered in his expression because Hermione recoiled, her eyes wide.
Harry had been able to exist in front of Draco without the shining Potter armour, and Draco had relaxed, dropping much of his characteristic snobbery. At the library, he’d almost been able to forget the backdrop of the ‘death eater’ threat, now that the graffiti had been scrubbed clean and only a shadow remained. It felt like a dream, one Draco didn’t ever want to wake up from.
He was yanked forwards, eye’s popping as he fell flush against Harry’s chest. He looked up, skin burning.
Harry coughed, surprised and incredibly touched that she’d think to ask him. “Uh, yeah,” he said, “sophisticated. Theodora sounds amazing.”
Malfoy shuddered against Harry’s side, and he was once again reminded of the job he was supposed to be performing. Before Malfoy could ask what he was doing, Harry secured his grip on his arm, apparating them both away, both for the sake of Malfoy’s safety and his sanity.
Draco sent him a withering look and Harry grinned back. He squeezed Draco’s hand. “It’s done,” he said, “by the way.”
He winced, suddenly wishing he’d maybe sent a letter, at least. Just to let them all know he was alright.
Shacklebolt relaxed in triumph. He was a perceptive man, and he knew when he’d won. “Just until we find somebody more permanent and Malfoy’s settled in.”
Okkkk, cue the beginnings of a good old sexuality crisis. Still, Harry's getting there, slowly. Chapter 8 is giving me a hard time at the moment so it might be a little later than Wednesday but I'll try. Stick with me! The angst isn't too bad, I promise! >:)
She pulled back with a smile, her eyes crinkling just a little, at the corners. “How are you Harry?” her brow furrowed slightly. “You look tired.”
In red paint, dripping from the bottom of each letter, were scrawled the words Harry knew Malfoy never wanted to see or hear again. Someone had vandalised the library walls, someone who had found out where Malfoy was now working. The words
Harry choked on his drink to find Ginny standing in the kitchen doorway. “Fuck,” he said, hissing when he spilt his coffee. “Shit.”
The man had said thank you. Maybe he really had changed. Harry found himself suitably intrigued, wondering what brought about this drastic new Draco Malfoy. He told himself he didn’t want to know more about him, but memories of his sixth-year obsession washed over him and he knew that he would be lying to himself.
Hermione was a Godsend, really. She'd already known something had been up with their relationship and had listened to Harry as he blurted everything he'd been bottling up for months. Ron had been nothing but supportive, though he'd been a little awkward at first. He'd soon relaxed after George had intervened with a joke, characteristically inappropriate to the situation, and everyone, including both Harry and Ginny, had laughed. Throughout everything, Hermione kept a hand on his shoulder, silently infusing him with her all strength.
Draco remembered when his magic had first manifested. He’d been younger than most, an early indication of his aptitude for spell work. He’d been out in the gardens, cross-legged beneath the skirts of a rose bush. He wasn’t sure what he’d been thinking, but it was vaguely along the lines of preserving the beauty of his mother’s flowers, this particular plant had been cultivated over years of attentive gardening. There was one wilting flower, flaccid and mottled with dark bruises. Draco had simply wanted to make it better, make it look as dainty as the others. He’d watched as it had somehow perked itself upright, only bowing it’s neck under the weight of its new petals.
He shook himself, clearing his throat. “But,” he said, the girl immediately perking up, “we do have an extensive fantasy section.” He pointed. “Just over there.”
Harry perplexed even himself with that admission. Malfoy had changed a lot. He almost felt ashamed of their entire rivalry at school. Well, maybe not all of it.
Harry missed Malfoy. He told himself that he didn’t, but a part of him knew that he was lying. It was only two days, but Harry found himself wishing he could go back to that library.
Harry looked at him. His face curled into the most evil-looking smile Draco had seen since Pansy had found out he’d had a crush on Potter in Year Five.
Harry’s fingers tingled but he couldn’t give Malfoy the satisfaction. “It’s alright,” he forced himself to say.
“Alright,” Draco said, pinching the bridge of his nose, “that’s enough. Har—Potter didn’t come here to listen to your squabbling. It’s been lovely seeing you both, by which I mean awful, but—”
“Has he told you about his vinyl collection?” Harry rounded on him, brows quirking upwards. “He’s ever so proud, though he still hasn’t got anything to play them with.”
Draco gulped, checking behind him a second time. Harry was beginning to feel worried. “Yes, Harry I—”
“Alright Malfoy, confess.” Potter slid along the aisle, leaning against one of the bookcases Draco was currently rearranging. The weekend was over and that left Potter with the freedom to exercise his uncanny ability to interrupt whatever task Draco was undertaking. All the same, Draco’s breath hitched. Confess what? “How many times have you read this?” Potter was waving one of those terribly written romance novels.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Can you really blame me?” He shook his head. “It’s not my fault your thick Gryffindor skull was too preoccupied with ‘proving yourself worthy’ rather than ensuring your own safety.”
It was when he was sitting on the steps of the house, watching as the breeze filtered through the reeds that Hermione approached him. He didn’t hear her to begin with, so he didn’t have time to wipe away the dopey expression he wore across his face.
“Forget it. It’s fine.” Malfoy snatched the papers out of Harry’s hands, a faint blush creeping over his pale cheeks.
“I’m not touching your sweaty palm.” Harry frowned, wiping his hand against his trousers and extending it once again. He waved his fingers, beckoning to Draco. Defeated, but sort of in a good way, Draco reluctantly rose to his feet, placing his hand in Potter’s.
Potter shrugged. He didn’t say another word as Draco picked up what he needed, filing papers away into drawers. They locked up the doors to the library in silence, Draco feeling Potter’s eyes fixed on him for the whole time.
"Hermione's probably brought her here for a good reason. And, as I said, we've got blackmail over her. You should probably lower your wand, you don't want to give yourself away." Harry advised. Draco did so reluctantly. He still held a glare as they walked to the table.
"I still feel like i got waked with a broomstick repeatedly." Draco grumbled and Hermione rolled her eyes.
"Oh." Harry put down his toast. He was unsure how to feel. He and the two of them had been friends for forever and now he's been solely talking to the guy who'd bullied them for years. He felt guilty.
"Yeah, the bloke tried to hit me with a couple jinxes but I just used the defence spells you taught us. Then I jinxed him and he dropped his wand so I just punched him in the face. Then I ended up knocking him out cold." Ron said proudly.
"Terrible, yet not as bad as they could've been. I suppose it was as good as you'd expect, when your family is full of Death Eaters." Draco said it cooly, as though he could be talking of the weather. Didn't get cursed, nor did I see or hear people being tortured." Harry didn't know what to reply.
It was a weight being lifted from his chest. But there were still many other weights keeping him down.  The fire engulfed the book, as the pages became black and slowly fell into the bottom of the flames.
"Drink. You're probably dehydrated" Madam Pomfrey instructed. Harry chugged the cup of water, playing over in his mind what had happened. He gave a shiver that had nothing to do with him being cold.
"I-" Draco started, ruffling Harry's hair up. "-Am completely in love."  He told him with a sure smile. "With you I mean." Draco added, concerned he had not understood. Harry chuckled.
"That doesn't mean you have to cut him off completely!" Hermione said shrilly. "He's obviously hurt, have you looked at him?!"
"Well the Curse supposedly gives you your hearts desire when you cast it." Draco explained. Harry thought for a second. Realisation flooded through him. He did.
"I think my opinion of him has slightly shifted." Draco told him, as they walked past the pumpkin patch towards the Lake. Harry sighed.
"You haven't seen the Prophet yet, have you?" Hermione held the paper in her hand, a weary expression on her face. Harry froze.
"I'll be in the library with Ron." Hermione replied, gathering her things. And they parted ways, and although Harry still felt a weight in his chest, it seemed to have lightened from Hermione's acceptance.
Harry looked at Malfoy who had started to regain colour in his face and began to look more sprightly.
"I'm not allowed to disobey my father." Malfoy wiped the tears off his cheek angrily. "Else I'll no longer have the option to escape from him here."
"We support every decision you make. If you've thought through this and think it's something that should happen, then we'll help and support you with it." Hermione told him. Ron nodded at her words.
Draco turned to face him, a cold expression on his face. "You can't speak for all Slytherin's like that. You all think that my house is 'the bad house'  and none of you have even had more than one conversation with any of us! You know why we seem so mean? Because everyone else hates our house and no one even cares to know us personally before determining us as evil because we're in Slytherin! Do you know how lonely it is to be a Slytherin? And you all wonder why we're so mean to people in other houses."
"We're just glad you're alright." Hermione told him. "Also Harry, we brought your things for you... you left them at the table during breakfast.' Hermione set his bag down by his bed. Harry thanked her. Then he hesitated.
As the 31st  neared around the corner and Harry's panic grew. Time was going to fast and Harry yearned to slow it down.
"I'm really  sorry Harry, I can't come on your birthday. But I'll throw  your birthday Party the day before. It's just that Arthur is having problems at work..." Mrs Weasley frowned.
Harry knew he wouldnt be able to sleep, not with the burning of his scar and the sinking feeling in his stomach. As Ron left, Harry's mind strayed back to Draco.
He knew he wouldn't be able to get back to sleep so he carefully got out of bed, grabbed his invisibility cloak, and headed out to the grounds.
"Look, could you all please, just, look at this with an open mind. I wouldn't be doing this if I didn't completely trust him now."
"Their not my friends. They're more like... what's the word...? Followers, I'd say. They know me because they know my father. They follow me around and do what I ask, but I can't really tell them anything about me. I can't show vulnerability in front of them and I daresay that takes away the possibility of friendship altogether."
’I did this. To him. I did this. He never forgot. Never let go of any of it. I ripped that from him. He’s broken. I broke him. I never meant…I…’
Harry. So quiet and confident. Powerful in all the ways I admire most, not just the ways the world measures. Money? Money is great, but he has so much more than that. In the ancient world he would have been the soldier that became a king. A man who rises aloft on the wings of his own talent. A mind like a diamond and a heart of purest gold. If he had been Alexander, I would have been his Bagoas, quiet at his side, there to comfort him when he was tired of being a king, and only wanted to be a man.
“Okay. Cool. Thanks, Dean. I know this wasn’t a standard mission, so the extra effort is appreciated. Be there as soon as I put away a few things.”
He tried to keep the puppy dog eagerness from his voice, but he could see the ghost of Draco’s smirk in the half light from the window. Harry made himself comfortable, or at least as comfortable as he could be on the cool, hard stones of the castle floor.
I remember the Greek legend of Tantalus, who was punished by being imprisoned eternally just out of reach of sustenance. It’s only bad because I’m so close to all the things I want, but I can’t have them. All I get is two little pills a day to relieve stress, and they work okay, but not enough to make me stop hating this abysmal state of affairs!
He’s been paying attention. I laugh a little and run my hands through his hair, because I recognize little things that he didn’t do before. He learned them from me. The careful flick and swab of a tongue that has no intention of bringing orgasm quickly. The hand that is firm and cautious, never giving too much pleasure, almost distracting you from the soft suction of lips and the warmth of a lover’s mouth. These are my greatest arts, and he’s using them for my benefit.
In the chaos and mess and dust, much was unearthed and laid aside for storage or cleaning, but only one thing gave either of them a moment's worry. In the drawer of an old dresser, shoved beneath some old clothes that hadn't seen daylight in decades, Draco found a collection of Muggle photographs, several of which might have been considered scandalous had they ever found their way into the hands of people other than himself or Harry.
"Cissy is fine. She's in bed. The house-elves know to keep tabs on things if I step out now. Just…you know…this parenting thing is a bit harder than I'd imagined. There are…permutations…ramifications…situations I couldn't…who could imagine these things?! Too much! Too much! It was…it was horrible!"
“Okay. I’m…I’m not good at this, alright. Wanna Dark Lord topped off? They tell me I’m aces at that kind of thing. Need Quidditch tips? I’m all over it! Telling you anything like that…not so much. You want to try an easier question…something just a little less personal than that?”
This is a special gift fic for CALAMUS DRACO, who spotted an obscure literary reference in an earlier fic. This fic was based on a two word plot bunny of her choice...Sycophant Hex. In this case the story is told through the eyes of Ron and Hermione, and the H/D aspect is periphal and unfolding. Congrats Calamus!
But ‘just’ and ‘maybe’ aren’t enough to sleep on. They’re enough to leave me praying in the night, Harry’s breath on my neck, eyes closed while my head races with panic, wishing to God that Snape had given me stronger pills.
“Perfect?” I can’t help smirking when he realizes that he just folded completely and confessed everything in front of me.
“It was really you, wasn't it? The dreams? John's potions worked...but I was seeing you. The bottle...that was no vision. You manifested...in the real world. I was seeing you...not your son...when we kissed. It was you all along.”
The topic had remained a tense one, at least for Draco, who hadn’t really thought as far ahead as what actual sex would consist of. Mostly, he was certain that there would be Harry, and there would be himself of course, and there would be nudity, and then…well… it didn’t take all that long after reaching that point that his wank fantasies would culminate in orgasm. It hadn’t really been necessary to imagine more than a bit of rolling about to finish the job, but the reality of sleeping…or rather…not sleeping with Harry were coming faster than…faster than…well…faster than he did when thinking of Harry!
He was plagued by constant erections now, and wanking never really made his feeling of restless hunger go away. He went through the motions, and got the expected results, but it always seemed like a hollow victory, and the only pleasure in it was a temporary relief that faded much too quickly.
Minerva stifled a sigh, but it wasn’t a bad idea. An exchange of thoughts and experience might have its use, but Ronald Weasley was obviously looking for ammunition, hoping to rouse a few sympathizers or at least some information that would support his opinions. What Ronald didn’t know, was that Minerva had discreetly spoken with all the instructors who regularly worked with Draco, ever since the boy’s arrival. Of them all, only Harry had been troubled. She acquiesced pleasantly, already knowing the results that this would bring.
Draco nodded somberly. “Yes. I am sure I can handle this. I think it is a good start. Professor? If I may ask a question?”
Ron sighed relief. “The other Prefects. We’re the only ones who know about this. It’s been a perk of Prefects for who knows how many centuries, and if it were anybody but you, mate, they’d have to torture it out of me.”
That’s when he started with a few of the others. The irony was that, as fucking horrible to me as he was, half of Slytherin was jealous of the amount of time he’d spent with me, even if they didn’t know the details. They practically lined up to be used by him, but he never went so far with any of them. I half think he played around with the others just to make sure that I’d see him with other people, and suffer appropriately. We’d never even kissed. I watched him snog other people in public for the last few weeks of school, and I really think he just did it to rub salt in my wounds.
Draco looked at him like he was talking to a complete cretin. “For what you called me! What else? You said I was piss ignorant…and inhuman! I apologized, so should you.”
“Last night…I hadn’t taken my Calming Potion. Snape brought me some a couple days ago. Extra strength. I…I have anxiety attacks…when I get too stressed. I thought you’d show up sometime, just not that late. I kind of panicked when you showed up. I…haven’t been sleeping well…or eating much. Makes me kind of dizzy. I meant it when I said that wasn’t your fault. I know you didn’t know. But…Harry, about the wizard’s debt…I want to talk about that.”
These last few years had been the hardest, with one and then both the children at Hogwarts more and more, but that was no excuse for what he’d let himself become. Odd that, of all the people in the world, Draco Malfoy would be the one to prod Harry into action.
“Well, I suppose I could tolerate ice cream…as long as I can pick any flavor I want and you won’t make any faces over my choice. You have such plebian taste. Vanilla! Who goes to Fortescue’s and orders vanilla?”
Then the lithe blond slumped into the pool and leaned back against the steps, just laying there, eyes closed tightly. Draco finally sat up and put his head in his hands, pushing his hair back and out of his face. Sitting there, unaware that he was watched, Draco had no pretense, and no mask of emotionless indifference. Without an audience, Draco looked genuinely sad, uncertain, and restless.
“He’s on his hands and knees. I think he’s begging Harry for forgiveness. I’m pretty sure he’s crying, too.” Ron couldn’t turn his head away from the scene. It was like a train wreck; horrifying to behold, but impossible to ignore.
Harry stopped in mid-sentence. Left of the door and occupying one of John’s spare chairs, tea still in hand and eyes firmly fixed on Harry, Draco sat with a stricken look of sudden desperation. Harry floundered a moment, cursing himself for his own weakness. He really, really hadn’t planned on starting the day with this…situation.
That sentimentality had only served to lure Harry further into the web of Draco’s lust. A stupid, horny, teenage fly, trapped in the spider web of Draco’s need, eager to be sucked dry and left withered and empty as an object lesson to others. What a fool he’d been.
Though Harry did feel guilty about his useless godparenting, amongst other things, sitting next to Teddy as the kid swung his legs back and forth on the couch, Harry was struck by how peaceful it all seemed. Maybe not everything was as bad as he’d imagined.
“I was going to,” Malfoy said, then produced an evil smile, “but then you asked.” He closed the door abruptly in Harry’s face. He poked two fingers through the letterbox, his eye peering through the gap. “Give me five minutes.”
"Fine, fine." He concluded. He didn't want to argue with Draco anymore. It only showed him how much Draco had decided to give up; how soon Draco would be gone.
Malfoy reached his hand out towards Harry and Harry backed as far as he could until he hit the bookcase behind him, making a noise. Malfoy then grabbed the silky fabric of the cloak and yanked it off of Harry.
Ron stood there in shock for a split second before going after her, not bothering to dry his robes. The staircase slid him down three times before he just stood at the end, simply calling Hermione's name.
Malfoy looked at him with blank confusion for a few short seconds before beginning with a new sentence.
"It's not that we disprove of you building a friendship with him. We think it's great that that you're letting go of you're past with Malfoy-"
"C'mon, we'd better ge' a move on." Hagrid called. The three of them followed Hagrid into the forest. As the trees became closer and their surroundings darker, Harry noticed Draco's nervousness increase. He held out his hand. Draco looked warily at Hermione.
"Actually Hagrid, you don't have to make us tea, I think we should be heading out. We have some homework to get done." He didn't want to be rude, but he new that if they didn't leave then, they'd be there for hours and Harry really did have things he needed to get done.
Harry nodded. "Thank you, Luna. Now, I'm going to ask him to come out now. Please, just. Give him a chance? He wants to apologize."
"The only person I'll stand with is Potter." Malfoy spat before raising his wand to his father. Draco cast a stunning curse.
He studied Draco once more before he noticed Draco's fingers twitching. Then a moment later his eyes opened; gleaming silver looking at Harry.
Draco escaped to another room, narrowly dodging the green spells of light, making Harry's heart race. Then he realised Bellatrix  was no where to be seen anymore. But he had no time to linger on that, for another Death Eater had cornered up on him.
He nervously moved his hand on impulse towards Draco's. To his surprise Draco moved his hand closer to Harry's as well and lay his on top of Harry's softly. Draco didn't stray his eyes from the view in front of him, he only smiled and gave a soft chuckle.
"Mr. Potter." Snape's cold, black eyes bore down on him as Harry took his seat. "Pleasure of you to join us today."
"She wouldn't be able to do anything. She can only act with proof. Even if she shares her suspicions with V-voldemort, without proof no one would think anything of it. Draco is the least likely they'd expect to betray them. It's his persona."
"What curse should I cast on you now?" The Slytherin asked himself. His voice was husky and deep. "I think the Cruciatus curse would be fitting."
"Oh." Harry said, surprised by his sudden apology. "That's alright, Malfoy. I accept your apology, but I'm the one who cursed you...it's the least I can do."
"Come along, Potter." Draco spat. "You'll soon find out what happens to people who try to sneak around professor Umbridge." There was a smirk on his face.
"God, just stop arguing over this." Draco said and they both fell silent. "Just let me take it. It doesn't matter at this point. I'm already in pain, and I'm already dying."
Harry looked at Draco and he felt the odd urge to be closer to him. Harry didn't know why. He probably just wanted to comfort him but it felt different. He just wanted to be close to Draco, in his arms for a long time. His heart beat faster with every look Draco gave him and Harry couldn't explain it. It was like adrenaline and warmth, happiness and sadness, all at the same time, hitting him like an ocean wave, but also like the small laps the water gave at the shore of the lake.
Harry felt the burn of his own sickle in his pocket. Engraved in the side of it was the word 'yes.' Harry gave a breath of relief.
"Come lay with me." He whispered tiredly, a pleading expression on his face. Harry gave in without thought, as Draco positioned himself correctly in the bed. Harry drew the curtains around the four-poster bed and lay down beside Draco.
"You sacrificed something toxic from your life even though the dangerous temptation to keep it tried to hold you back.  That's really brave of you, and strong." Hermione told him.
“It wouldn’t be all that bad if you were to become friends,” she said. Harry could tell she was uneasy, but she was giving him her blessing and he honestly didn’t know how to thank her for that.
“What? No!” Merlin, Draco knew he’d been bad, but for Potter to believe that he’d been trying to make every person’s life as miserable as possible? He supposed it did make sense. Draco just wished it didn’t. “No,” he said again, “my father used it as an opportunity to attack Dumbledore’s judgement, yes. But, and as much as I didn’t like the big oaf – sorry – Hagrid, that was never my intention.”
“I can’t think why,” he said drily, “now go off and do whatever it is you usually do.” He waved a hand flippantly, gesturing to her to leave. She nodded hastily and began to scuttle off. “Oh, and Keesy,” Draco called after her, “I’ve told you before: there’s no need to call me Master.”
“Just let me finish.” Draco closed his eyes, sucking in a deep breath. “I’ve always been a coward, but never around you. You make me brave Harry. You make me feel...like I deserve to be loved, again.”
“I can’t,” he said, running a hand through his unruly hair, “Ginny and I are supposed to be visiting the Burrow this weekend.”
“That what?” Harry interrupted. “That I lived in a manor like you? Not all of us were that privileged Draco.”
Harry wasn’t sure how to respond to that. George nudged his sister in the ribs, grinning with a playful wink. “Oh, I bet there is, eh Gin?”
She pulled away after a few minutes, dragging her sleeve across her eyes. “You idiot!” she yelled at him. “You always think you’ll be better off alone, away from us! You had everybody worried sick!”
“My Father was obsessed with pure-blood lineage,” Draco corrected without emotion, “I was merely an insecure brat and my obsession was with pleasing him.”
Draco smiled after Keesy, watching as she scurried to perform her duties. Draco couldn’t have run faster from his own duties after the war ended. His arranged marriage with Astoria had been the last honourable act that he’d done for the Malfoy name, and even then their ‘arrangement’ had involved a very open marriage. Draco sighed, readjusting his shirt cuffs. Keesy was right to be worried he supposed. He’d been isolating himself for so long. He was stalked, by ghosts who had already long since moved on to a better haunt.
“Thanks,” the girl said, eyeing the pair a little confusedly. Nodding to Draco, “Hope you feel better.”
Ginny nodded, moving to get her coat. Harry sighed, closing his eyes softly. He didn’t open them until he heard the door click behind his partner. He couldn’t remember the last time they’d said goodbye to each other.
Harry pushed his chair back and walking around to place a gentle hand on Draco’s shoulder. “You’ll be ok?” he asked. “While I’m gone?”
He desperately yearned for what Potter had, not the title, not anymore: a family. He wanted what they had at the burrow, a family unit that seemed unflappable. He wanted his mother back, even some of the company she’d kept had sometimes been tolerable. He wanted what Potter had found; he craved that same love, acceptance.
Malfoy sighed, dropping his paper into his lap. “What is it, Potter?” Harry realised he’d been staring and dropped his eyes to his hands. “I can tell your desperate to ask questions.”
After a slightly awkward few minutes, Harry eventually took a seat next to Ron, and nobody seemed to question why he and Ginny sat at opposite ends of the table.
“I was famous,” he said slowly, “because my parents were killed. Despite what everyone seemed to think, it wasn’t exactly my proudest achievement.” He tried a wan smile, but it fell flat, the corners of his lips curving downwards.
Ok, so, I said every Sunday but I've had this chapter written for a while and I want to get it out there. I'm enjoying this too much.
He was currently leaning across the reception desk, a stupid smile spread over his lips as he watched Malfoy help a young child find their favourite book. He looked almost ethereal with his silver, thin-framed, round glasses and sharp suit. Harry had never felt this easy with Ginny. There was always something missing.
Sobered, he released Harry’s grip and cleared his throat, wiping his palm against his waistcoat. When he looked up, Harry was fixing him with a melting smile and Draco just about puddled, there and then.
He perked up the collar of his long coat in an attempt to keep out the cold, watching as his breath swirled around his head.
“It’s perfectly normal to feel panicked,” Harry said, facing whatever he was stirring again, which admittedly smelled divine. “I’d be more worried if you didn’t care.”
Harry nodded again, stretched and yawned. He started to gather up the plates still sitting on the table, preparing to set them next to the sink. As he walked past, he placed a hand on Draco’s shoulder, squeezing gently. “Thank you,” he said, and Draco practically fell to pieces, there and then.
He thought of the boy he once was, how he’d spent so much time concerned over what people would think, of pureblood ideals, Lucius’s ideals that he’d severed bonds between people he hadn’t even met. He loved Pansy, Blaise too, he always would, but he’d selected them based on lineage, because of how he thought people would look at him.
“Get out.” Malfoy’s eyes were shining. Harry nodded slowly. He’d overstepped. He didn’t say another word, knowing that nothing he could say would help rectify the situation. Keesy was staring at him from down the hall. He forced himself to smile at her, but he supposed it must’ve been more like a grimace.
Draco coughed again. “Yes but,” he could feel himself blushing, “you might as well stay where you are. It’s more convenient. For you.”
The first sip tingled on his lips but the moment he swallowed, his whole body was filled by a warmth he’d never felt before. “Woah,” he breathed.
Draco turned to Harry, now picking at his nails. “Harry,” he tried, firmer this time when he was met with no response, “Harry.”
Yet, now, Malfoy had thrown all of his caution firmly out of the window. There was no denying that the man was attractive. Harry would have to be blind not to see it, even if the man was a prat. Only, Harry didn’t like men in that way, did he? Hermione had asked him, and Harry knew the answer, just didn’t say it. He loved Ginny. At least he thought he did.
To anyone else, their comments would seem cruel, but this is what they’d become: fleeting touches and allusive banter.
"I'd, I'd like that. I can't say I know how it all works, or exactly what you're supposed to do with them, but yes, I'd like that."
They stared as blue-tinted clouds slowly tracked along the heavens, like the wake of a boat across the sea. Hermione’s eyes were bright with the hues of dwindling daylight.
As it happens, the universe is not so often inclined to force upon us what we truly need, and Harry Potter spared not a glance behind him.
Ginny’s eyes grew comically wide. “Not important? Of course it is! You’ve been gone for five days, Harry Potter, I—” she trailed off again, expression soft, “you could’ve been killed.”
He was never the boy who lived. He was the boy who hoped. That was how they’d defeated Voldemort, because they had hope. The Prophet never failed to miss that from their articles.
“Honestly, Potter, I did say five minutes.” Harry blushed, suspended above the ground in Malfoy’s arms.
Draco swallowed. “Oh?” he asked. He’d forgotten he’d pinned it up on the board as a kick-starter. He hoped it had made him sound at least slightly intelligent. “Did you understand any of it?”
Harry’s heart ached and he bundled the child into his arms, letting him sob against his chest. This was new to Harry, sure, but he would help, and support, in any way he could. Teddy mumbled something Harry couldn’t quite make out.
“His history?” Harry threw his arms above his head. “What about our history? This is Draco Malfoy we’re talking about here.”
“Blaise, darling,” Pansy called behind her, “come and see who just knocked on the door.” She turned back to Harry, sporting that disarming smile of hers. “Sorry Potter, we were just—”
He wondered if all that time spent around the dementors had somehow sucked a part of his soul away, purely by chance. Sometimes he would imagine that’s why he did what he did. It helped him sleep at night, whenever he felt he could sleep.
“Alright.” Draco sighed, standing to walk over to where a crystal decanter sat on a smooth mahogany table. He filled a glass with whiskey, not bothering to offer one to Harry. “Would you like to see your itinerary?”
He knew he needed to talk to Ginny. Well, he needed to talk to Hermione too, and Ron, and Draco. Really, he needed to talk to everyone, but he needed some time.
“Yeah Dad,” George chirped from behind, “besides, course Harry doesn’t use anything to style his hair. Look at it, it’s a bird’s nest.”
He wiped his eyes, sniffing as the kettle chimed. He hadn’t wanted to leave Draco. That had been obvious, but not for the reasons Draco thought. He’d said he wasn’t important.
“Is it your arrogance perhaps? No, I’d say it’s more to do with the nightmares you have. Do they keep you up all night? Does she have to sleep in a separate room?”
For a moment, Harry was incredibly tempted to say yes, but he knew he couldn’t and to be honest, he still wasn’t completely sure as to why Malfoy was asking him to join him in the first place.
“He tried to kill Dumbledore,” he said quietly. Without him really noticing, his hands curled into fists by his sides.
Malfoy stood up slowly. When he turned around his calm expression dissolved into a slight frown. He shoved his hands in his pockets, walking over to Harry somewhat tentatively.
He found him squinting at the board for book reviews, leaning forwards to get a better look at what was written. He looked strangely at ease here, and nothing at all like the man emblazoned over nearly every copy of the daily prophet.
Harry stared at the stern woman standing in the doorway. The woman who’d sacrificed her familial status for love. He smiled.
Harry’s head shot up and he tensed, immediately. He almost jerked away, but Draco held his hand in place. Every nerve was screaming at him to let go, to stop himself from letting Harry hold his hand, but Draco couldn’t hear them, for his heart was beating too loudly.
He looked up. His hand found its way to Harry’s pulse which he gently thumbed, without thinking. His cheeks burnt red when he noticed the lapse in his self-control, and he went to yank his hand away. He paused, just before he did.
“It’s nothing really, I doubt anybody else noticed,” Harry appreciated her attempts to console him, “but you and Ginny never seem to spend time together, and there’s always this tension between the two of you, like you’re, I don’t know, trapped.”
“Of course, he missed you!” she exclaimed, her bushy hair blocking Harry’s view as he squeezed her back. “We all have.”
Ginny nodded. “You always are,” she sighed, and Harry couldn’t tell whether she’d meant it as an insult or a backwards sort of compliment. She looked around her to the side and pulled out a chair, taking a seat. “We should talk.”
“Wanted to make it work,” Harry interrupted. “This isn’t just on you,” he told her, “I felt it was wrong too, but this was my happy ending. I had to make it work.”
He shouldn’t be this nervous. He was a Malfoy, for Merlin’s sake. It was just…after his father had been sent to Azkaban, he hadn’t had much in the way of social interaction.
“Mmm,” Potter said, nodding to where Draco sat hunched over in the desk chair, “I can see that you’re fine.” Draco shot him a glare.
“Potter,” Draco said, a little harshly, but he was being rather ridiculous, “you just told me that the—Mrs Weasley saw you as a son. That was before your relationship with Ginny started, am I correct?”
I might drop Chapter 4 too to keep the story going but we'll see! I've included one of my personal headcanons about George after the war and I hope you like the chapter!
Potter shrugged, shoving his hands deep into his pockets. “Yeah,” he said, kicking at the air, “it’s nice.”
“Gin, I’d say ‘I don’t love you’ is about as official as it gets.” He sucked in a breath, laughter dying, and Ginny winced. Way to ruin the mood, Potter. Though, to be fair, they were ‘officially’, as Ginny put it, breaking up. There wasn’t much of a mood to spoil in the first place.
“What is it?” He searched Malfoy’s pale features, somehow even paler than usual. “Malfoy, what’s wrong?”
Malfoy raised a brow. He looked like he was about to retort but he instead reached for the teapot in the centre of the table. Removing the cosy, he grabbed Harry’s cup, pouring the contents inside.
Potter snorted from behind, earning him a sharp elbow to the ribs, causing him to take a step backwards with a little ‘oof’.
“No but really, Harry, why you seem so worried,” she paused, heaving a preparatory sigh, “is it…does this have something to do with Ginny?”
It wasn’t too much later that Harry stumbled backwards, barely caught by Draco when the door he was leaning against was pulled inwards.
He’d told himself he wouldn’t think about it, but then, he couldn’t not think about it. His relationship with Ginny had collapsed, he was risking losing her, and he couldn’t have that happen again. Not with Draco. If he could build a friendship with Malfoy and keep it alive forever, well, he’d choose that over anything more and potentially losing him forever.
Draco visibly relaxed, releasing a shaky breath. “Um,” he said, “I’m not sure I can direct you to any specifically.” He’d never been a fan of books like that. They all tended to be hilariously inaccurate, all with the same stereotypical tropes and pointy hats. Though, thinking now of Professor McGonagall, perhaps the hats weren’t too far off reality.
Harry waited for Draco after potions class, pretending he needed to talk to Snape. It was the last class of the day and students rushed out of the day, all except Draco who was the last person done with his potion that day. Harry found that odd, considering Draco usually finished his potion the same time as Hermione.
. His best friend. He couldn't wrap his mind around it. Why couldn't he have shared this connection with a girl like Ginny or Cho or even Lavender Brown for heaven's sake?
"Of course, Professor." Draco nodded. He looked to Harry, and grabbed him roughly, forcing him through the hall. "There's no escaping, Potter."
The drawings inside were beautiful, but most of them were really sad. Harry was extremely impressed with them, though. All of the drawings moved on the pages. The first few drawings moved only in small, repetitive motions, but the farther in the sketch book Draco went, the more intricate the art's movement seemed to be.
"Wouldn't you like back up?" Draco had asked Umbridge before they left the office. "In case one of them tries anything?"
He looked at Draco, peacefully asleep. Harry felt like it was a crime to wake him up. He gently shook Draco, but Hermione simply cast Aguamenti, splashing water all over Draco's face.
"Your hair looks quite well." Harry told him, raising an eyebrow. His blond hair was more ruffled and unkept. It was unusual for Draco, who usually kept his hair neat and well trimmed, but Harry secretly thought it was hot.
They walked through Hogsmeade together, holding each other's hand. Harry half dared someone to say something, half was afraid of someone saying something. Thankfully, they went unnoticed except for a few passerbyers who looked curiously at them, and one person who just glared.
"So the Hogsmeade trip is this Saturday... Would you fancy going with me...? I'd be under disguise obviously."  Draco looked at Harry hopefully.
Harry was stiff, unable to move. His eyes were closed. The boy kicked him in the side repeatedly. He felt a cry in his throat but Harry couldn't move. Then the Slytherin kicked him in the nose and blood gushed on his face. He wished he would just pass out so he wouldn't have to be aware of what was happening. It reminded him of Dudley and Uncle Vernon. Then he felt pain in his arm, accompanied by a loud crack. He couldn't breathe through the pain.
Uncle Vernon would say. But Harry couldn't see how it could be wrong. Their lips fit together like pieces of a puzzle. Their hearts seemed to beat in sync. Harry just wanted to pull Draco closer. This wasn't wrong. This was beautiful. Sparks pulling them closer together. Connecting them.
"I saw it. Like I did with Ron's dad. Voldemort was torturing Sirius in the Department of Mysteries." Harry explained.
"Harry, do you think you can come to the Three Broomsticks at around midday? It's rather important." Hermione said, reading a letter she'd gotten from the mail at the table. It was Breakfast, and Harry had been giddy all morning, looking foward to spending the day with Draco.
"I think you're making it worse for yourself." Draco told him. "You should accept that this is a thing that's happening. There's no going around it and there's no avoiding it. So you just have to push through it."
"Yeh see, he's my brother. Half brother I mean. He didn' really want ter come... but I couldn' jus' leave em there..."
"He's not safe talking to me. If Umbridge finds out we're friends, that he betrayed his family. He'll have not only the Ministry's eyes on him, but the disapproval of his family and the cruelty of Voldemort to answer to. If Umbridge finds out he's screwed." Harry tried to explain, desperate for her to understand.
As he rest there, waiting for Malfoy, he was suddenly in a tiny, dark room. There was a blinding pain from where his scar was and he struggled to hold a gasp from the sudden sting.
"You've murdered me, Potter! I'm going to die because of you! You murderer! You did this to me and I'm going to make sure you pay!" Malfoy said as loud as he could without being heard by anyone outside of the room.
Draco watched him go from the door, waving when Harry looked behind to do the same. Draco closed the door and the manor, all at once, became silent.
Draco used his hand to gesture around the room with s sweep of his hand. “So,” he said, “what do you think?” He could scarcely believe that he was asking for Potter’s opinion.
Harry smiled down at him, something impossibly tender in his eyes. He brushed a lock of hair from Draco’s forehead, pulling him up to stand properly on his feet.
Malfoy paused, turned back to look at him with a tired smile. “Thank you,” he said, and Harry knew that he meant it.
Harry’s own fingers were wrapped around Draco’s wrist. He stared, dazed, lips parted, eyes wide behind his glasses. Slowly, he smoothed his fingers along Draco’s arm, until their fingertips rested palm to palm. Draco could only watch as Harry twisted his hand, fingers curling to slot between Draco’s.
Harry was clearly hurt, face crumpling. Draco looked away, unwilling to face why that might be just yet. He was perceptive, but he also understood people. If Harry really had started to feel something similar to Draco, and that was a humungous if, it needed to be clear and unconfused. He wasn’t a rebound. He couldn’t be, not for Potter.
Malfoy studied her curiously for a while but eventually nodded. “Very well.” Keesy nodded and hurried to the kitchens, sparing a quick glance for Harry.
Hermione laughed, a light sound, one that carried through the breeze. “The prophet would have a field day.”
He dived for Potter but apparently used just a little too much force because Potter lost his footing with a yelp, gripping onto Draco’s arms as they toppled backwards. They landed in a heap, Draco’s chin smacking into Potter’s chest. Immediately, Draco jolted his head up. Big mistake. Harry’s cheeks were flushed, his lips parted in surprise. His hands were still gripping Draco’s forearms, his dark hair wild. Their chests were pressed together, Draco’s heart beating fast enough that he was sure Potter could feel it. His breath hitched as he stared down at the man who lived.  Potter’s green eyes were blown wide, and Draco was swept away by the intensity of his gaze. Draco had always found Harry’s eyes, exquisitely beautiful, secretly, of course, but seeing them this close was something else entirely. Maybe Potter wasn’t the most attractive man on earth, but there was something about the way his eyes contrasted so vividly with the dark locks of his hair that made him inherently alluring. Draco supposed the appeal had something to do with Potter’s attitude as well, his loyalty to those he cared about, his dedication to his overwhelming sense of honour. Draco’s gaze dropped to Potter’s lips, and he decided that green eyes weren’t the only thing Potter had going for him. Something stirred in the pit of Draco’s stomach and, alarmed, he scrabbled away.
He’d only just found him, for Merlin’s sake. Of course, Malfoy had always been there, since year one, but Harry had found Draco, and had finally been able to call him by his forename. Malfoy didn’t define him, but Draco did, and Harry was starting to realise what that truly meant.
Potter flashed a shy smile. “You know,” he said, “Harry. Just Harry. Without the ‘Potter’, without the scar. Can’t we just pretend that I’m nobody for once?”
The door opened with a jarring click.  “Potter.” Malfoy stood in the doorway, an impeccably tailored suit, clinging to his lean figure. He held his head, high as always, blonde hair slicked back aside from the few strands sneaking over his eyebrows. Harry may have hated the man when he was younger, but he’d never been blind, despite what his prescription might tell you, and Malfoy, well, Malfoy looked good. The only thing that painted any picture other than flawless elegance were the dark circles under his eyes, stark against his pale skin.
“What?” Harry exclaimed. He placed a gentle hand on Malfoy’s shoulder, clapping him on the back. “I meant you, it’s a compliment.”
“Something wrong with it, Potter?” Draco was in no mood to be ridiculed, especially not by the precious chosen one.
He opened one eye, slowly, then the other. He’d tried to help last time, but he’d tried using magic and it hadn’t gone well. He wanted to learn this way, Harry’s way.
“She’s right.” Draco pushed the letter towards Harry. Harry sighed, running one hand through his tousled hair and taking the letter with the other.
“Nuhuh,” he felt strong arms wrap around his, guiding his hands in a circular movement, “you’re doing it wrong.” He could feel Harry’s breath, hot against the back of his neck. His ears were scalding, and he stared helplessly at the hands helping his own circle the pan. “Seriously Draco, have you never even stirred before?”
“We, I mean you,” Ginny continued, “you’re more like a brother to me now, though I did love you at the start. After the war, well, I think it put some things into perspective, for the both of us.”
“Then,” the little girl looked at both adults, eyes wide, “I’ll keep it. It’s the name my parents gave me, isn’t it?”
“Oh?” Harry said with a snarl, his anger bubbling over. “And why’s that?” He shouldn’t be letting Malfoy get to him, but he was being deliberately antagonising.
“Well, I for one,” Hermione interjected with a toss of her hair, “think it’s about time that the two of them matured past pubescent shouting matches.”
Draco cleared his throat, shuffling on his feet. “That will take you rather a long time to get back.”
Harry looked at her uncertain expression, though she was trying hard not to show it. “Yeah Mione. I’m sure.”
Harry sighed, turning around with one hand on his hip and the other pointing in Draco’s direction with a wooden spoon. “Draco, you’ve been threatened multiple times and they know where you work.” He folded his arms, tapping his foot impatiently. “It’s no wonder you were going to be on edge.”
He didn’t look up for the longest time. When he finally did, he was not prepared. Potter was staring at him with such a soft look on his face that Draco’s knees almost buckled.
“Yeah, uh,” he cleared his throat, “surprisingly fine, actually.” Harry blinked. It was going fine, wasn’t it? He would even go as far as to say well. Harry almost choked on his drink.
“Uh, hi,” Harry said, unsure what else to say. He waved slightly. He’d never been very good at interacting with house elves; his experience was very limited, and he’d never been comfortable with the conditions of their servitude. Especially not since Dobby. He’d freed Kreacher as soon as the war ended but the old elf still returned to skulk around Grimmauld Place every now and again. Harry always pretended not to notice him. Kreacher seemed to appreciate that, in his own way. Harry wasn’t sure what he’d do if he didn’t.
Ginny huffed a breath and rushed towards him, throwing her arms around his neck. He let out a little ‘oof’ sound, but his arms relaxed around her, squeezing her back.
Potter let go of Draco’s hand as soon as they’d arrived at their destination. Draco tried not to feel hurt when Potter wiped his hand against his trousers. His ministry uniform was tight-fitting, complimenting his toned physique beautifully. It might raise a few questions from Draco’s work, but he could cope. He was good at lying.
Potter couldn’t seem to hide his grin. “I just never would’ve imagined you’d end up a librarian, that’s all.”
Harry nodded slowly. “So naturally,” he said, “you turn to me.” He tossed his sweetest smile. “Your saviour.”
I enjoyed writing this chapter a lot actually, so I hope it's just as enjoyable to read. Thanks for your time, and as always, please don't hesitate to drop me a comment. Very much appreciated!
