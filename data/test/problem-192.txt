Gods, his eyes.
“Well… it turned out that neither of us were as, I guess, straight as we thought we were, you know.”
Harry seemed taken aback and seemed to realise he said something amiss. “I didn’t mean… I meant that you not wanting me dead can’t be the only reason… right?” he squirmed and pulled at his jumper sleeve in a nervous gesture. Draco’s guess was that even Harry didn’t understand his own stupid fucking question.
Harry couldn’t help but laugh as he held Draco by his face and planted a firm kiss on his lips.
“Next… I would start kissing you here” with his other hand he raised one of Draco’s hands up to his mouth. He kissed the back of Draco’s hand. “I would kiss you all over” Harry kissed every one of Draco’s knuckles, each of his fingers, pausing at the ring finger where the band he had placed all those years ago still rested. He left a lingering kiss on that finer and, making sure Draco was watching, he sucked that finger into his mouth at the same time as his other hand finally cupped Draco’s cock.
“The worst.” I winked at him.
I just spluttered at her in indignation.
I was frowning at the menu when I heard Harry chuckle and I looked up to see him looking at me with amusement.
Draco looked back scandalised.
“You look
He looked up at me and I notice I had been staring at him for a while. He grinned at me “is there something on my face Malfoy?”
“I will always find you, Draco.” Harry kissed Draco again, his lips, nose, temple, brow. “Always.”
He grinned at me. “No need to sound so enthusiastic Draco! I’ll see you at 5 then?”
In that moment Draco decided to just
I noticed Harry shiver as the night grew colder, so without thinking much I wrapped my arm around his shoulders as we walked. He let out a gentle sigh that I would have missed had we not been so close, and he put his arm around my waist and squeezed me to him. We walked like that in silence by the river until we reached a tiny little bridge. Without verbal agreement, we both stopped in the middle of the arch of the bridge and looked to the water, which made a gentle trickling sound and reflected the light of the streetlamps and the moon. It really was quite romantic.
“I love you.” Draco blurted for the first time. He immediately blushed, his ears flushing beautifully in pink. “I know you won’t remember, but –”
“In a way, yes we were” Draco said. “For a time, at least.”
By instinct Draco had erected walls in his mind to protect those memories, to keep them safe until he was alone and able to study them.
“Dreadful things I suppose.”
I nodded and we put our coats on before walking out. Harry had brought me to a small town that I assumed was still in Scotland. The streets were quiet as we walked through them, and made it to a small river that waded through the town. We talked more and shared other stories, even a bonkers one about Harry and Hermione rescuing that damnable Hippogriff of Hagrid’s back in third year and giving him over to Sirius Black for his escape. Coming from anyone else I wouldn’t have believed a single word, but knowing Harry and his penchant for being involved in highly improbable scenarios I knew it would be true.
Harry broke the kiss gently, pulling away with a last peck on the corner of Draco’s mouth.
Potter finally gabbed my hand, and laced his fingers with mine without saying a word. It gave me the strength I needed to carry on talking.
“Go” she said simply. “Go, now! I will sort everything out here.”
Those instincts couldn’t be ignored for long.
“Well… I mean, you know about my history is Rosmerta… it’s uncomfortable, you know.” I replied quietly.
He nodded again, so Harry set the film up and sat back to enjoy the film with his husband.
I was shocked to learn that –
Harry chuckled and said, “you’re so bossy sometimes, I fucking love it.” And
“I think you already know” he whispered. He kissed my cheek tenderly, stroked a lock of hair from my forehead and stepped away.
Comments and kudos are welcome
“I found out on my 11
“Is he alright?” He asked Dean.
His eyebrow popped up slightly in surprise. “Oh?”
Potter’s grin was nothing short of predatory in response.
“You” I blurted. I took a hasty sip of tea and coughed to avoid choking to death. “I mean you got to hear about my pitiful coming-out story, it’s only fair that I hear yours.”
“Exactly like a date.” He said firmly.
“I do, yes” I said as I finally made eye contact with a waiter and flagged him over.
“How did they react?” He asked quietly. I met his eyes and knew that if I didn’t want to say, he wouldn’t pressure me to tell him. I just knew that I could never speak about it again and he would never question it, and that made me feel safer and freer than I ever had before.
“Are you sure? We must be certain before we call the Dark Lord! Narcissa, Draco, come over and check for me.” He commanded.
But also, straight people got me thinking. A bushy haired one in particular. Was it true what she said about Harry pining?
“So why did you and Weaslette break up then?” I blurted without meaning to.
“See you at breakfast” Hermione said with a smirk, and gave Weasley a sharp look when he seemed inclined to protest.
Harry was rooted to the spot. Hermione called Malfoy
I didn’t think I would get this far so I asked the first thing that came to mind. “You mentioned that both you and the Weaslette weren’t straight, is that true?”
Harry was looking at Draco’s feet as he tried to think back. “All of it? What kind of question is that?”
, so tight, as he finally came.
“It’s ok Draco, don’t worry. It’s just… they’re not the nicest of people.” He said quietly.
I tried to wiggle out of the comfort of Harry’s arms, but he didn’t let me. “It’s done, Draco. It’s all over. The fact that you see sense now means more than anything you blindly believed as a kid.”
It took me a second to process that information. “Wait, what do you mean about finding out you were a wizard?”
“Beginning of sixth year” I replied. “You know… before everything.”
The trailed lazy patterns on each other’s skin as they both came down from their high, dropping lazy kisses on the other. Draco’s hand gripped Harry’s hair and pulled him up gently to kiss him softly on the lips. He pulled away slightly and looked into Harry’s eyes with a smile on his lips.
He snorted in amusement.
I ground myself harder against Harry and whimpered with need. He licked his way to my ear and tugged the lobe with his teeth, gently soothing it with his tongue. “Gods Draco… you’re beautiful, so beautiful…” I moaned and gripped his hair tighter still, keeping him there. “You feel amazing, I need you, I want you so bad…”
His smile was so pure my throat started burning. “I like you too Draco.” He whispered back to me. He moved his other hand to the nape of my neck and pulled my face to his. “I really like you, have been for a while.”
Oh fuck it. “You just have a bit of sauce right here” I said, and throwing caution to the wind I leaned towards him without warning and dabbing at an imaginary spot of sauce on his cheek with my napkin. I ran a finger along his jaw as I moved away and made eye contact with him, all the while feeling like the daredevil I truly am. “There you go, now you’re back to pretty” I kind-of joke.
His hand was resting tantalisingly close on his knee. Before I could think about it too much, I grabbed it in my hand. “I feel the same.”
Harry’s last words to him before they had both been Obliviated to forget their relationship. Their real relationship, mind you, one forged in love and care, not hate and envy like they had been at one time.
Everyone was only too happy to comply – our task was to have a fountain of wine sprout from our wands. The glee from my classmates was very palpable, and I spotted Blaise conjuring two goblets out of thin air for himself and Pansy before Flitwick went over to tell them off.
It had been an odd night – a really fucking weird evening. Not only had he attacked some of the Dark Lord’s strongest supporters, publicly declaring his allegiance to Harry Potter, but he had also left his mother behind. His chest constricted with a pang of anxiety and he couldn’t help a sob escaping, his lungs working at double, triple speed to supply oxygen to his brain. The walls started closing in, the weight of a cement block on his chest barely allowing him to breathe, all he could think of was his mother, what he had done to her, how she might
“That was quite the dramatic entrance you made” he whispered at me, giggling madly. “And a dramatic exit too, actually.”
Potter held the door open for me, so chivalrous of him, and together we started walking back to the castle. I noticed that he walked a lot slower than usual, normally he practically jogged everywhere, I guess because he felt his saviour instincts kick in? I don’t know, but who was I to complain about spending more time alone with him?!
I sat back down but didn’t meet his searching eyes. “I understand, we really don’t have to talk about this.”
It had been whilst he was under the Cruciatus curse that something in his mind
We were perfectly lined up, from our legs to our chests and it took me a bit too long to realise that we were snogging out in the open for anyone to see, but I couldn’t bring myself to care. This was what I had been fantasising about for a while and it was so amazing being with Harry finally, feeling his hard body pressed against mine, his breath on my lips and his fingers grasping my hips as if his life depended on it.
Harry gently pulled his fingers out of Draco and raised himself onto his knees. With a whisper he cast a lubricating charm and quickly lathered his cock, noticing how Draco followed his every move. Draco reached a hand over as if to grasp Harry’s cock, but with a growl Harry grabbed the hand and pinned it above Draco’s head. He guided his cock towards Draco’s entrance but paused before pushing in
They had sat by the Lake under the beech tree they had adopted as their own in the few months that they had been dating. It was on the far side of the Lake, hidden enough that no passing students or teachers could find either of them without physically standing in front of the boys.
One moment they were standing in the middle of the clearing, the next Draco was slammed against a tree trunk, Harry gripping his hips and then his thighs as he hoisted Draco up, Draco immediately wrapping his legs around Harry’s torso. It was a while before they both realised a need to breathe and with loud gasps their lips separated, Harry’s immediately tracing a familiar path along Draco’s jaw and down his neck. Draco moaned above him and buried his hair in Harry’s hair, sniffing his musk and drowning in a rush of pleasure, and kissed Harry’s hair reverently.
I still don’t know who was the first to move, or if we simply couldn’t help the obvious attraction between us, but the next thing I knew his wonderfully soft lips were on mine and I felt like I was flying. He grazed his tongue against my lips and I gasped in surprise. He took that opportunity to let his tongue into my mouth and grazed mine softly.
I think you already know.
“Great, Malfoy?” He scoffed. “It actually kind of was great” he said with a wink.
Draco simply grinned at Harry and leant over to kiss him. It started sweet and gentle, but soon it became a clash of tongues and teeth that had them both panting. Draco sucked Harry’s tongue into his mouth and opened his eyes to look into Harry’s.
“I was thinking, do you guys want to go down to the Three Broomsticks? Celebrate the weekend and all.” Weasley suggested the group, nodding his hello to Blaise and Pansy.
“Shhh they might hear you” Weasley whispered. “Goodnight you two, be good.” He said, presumably to Blaise and Pansy, who both snorted.
Harry gave a soft laugh. “I’ll get you one, drama queen.” He kissed Draco on the temple and stood up. “Yes, you are” he said in response to Draco’s thought-retort
“No, Hermione did just fine. It was… the memories came back a few months ago.” Draco said quietly, not quite ready on talking about how they came back.
Dean visibly relaxed, and picked Griphook up gently, following Harry into the tent where Harry was happy to hide for the rest of the night.
he dove right in, licking his opening firmly before sticking his tongue inside Draco’s arsehole as far as it would go and moaning. Draco’s arse fluttered around Harry’s tongue
“I… don’t know. I can’t be sure” Draco practically whispered, his eyes still searching Harry’s face, was he looking for something?
I could practically hear all the laments of his fan club from my room. I wondered briefly how it would feel like to care for their feelings, but I would lie if I admitted I gave a damn.
I imagine he remembered the same thing I did because he let out an unexpected bark of laughter. “You wish.”
Harry seemed to understand and took pity on me. “In case you’re wondering what the chili meter is, when you choose what you want to eat you can make it as spicy as you want. But you don’t really like spicy, do you?”
The bell rung in the distance and we both groaned at the same time.
“I didn’t realise I had to seduce my husband after 5 years” Harry asked, pretending to be shocked. “If I had known I would have done something completely different.” He rested a hand, almost accidentally, on Draco’s thigh.
“So what are you working on?” He asked, as if he hadn’t noticed all the books, scrolls and dictionaries on the table. I could only just stopped myself from rolling my eyes before I met his eyes.
I nodded, and in a blink of the eye I was tugged into pressing darkness by Harry.
Blaise snorted from the corner. “Eloquent as always, dear Draco.”
He huffed a laugh “have you been bottling that one in all this time?” He asked gently. I nodded slightly at him and he squeezed his arm around me again. It really felt nice.
“But I want to” he said quickly. “I mean, I’ve only talked about this with Ginny, Hermione and Ron, and they’re great but… well, they won’t understand as much as you, I guess.”
I glared at Harry. We stared at each other for exactly 3 seconds before we both burst out laughing.
Harry clearly did not feel the same.
Hoping for a glimpse of his cock, I grabbed the doorknob (oh my god, knob) and quickly opened the door before I could talk myself out of it. I looked into the room and saw that the curtains were wide open, and the moonlight was streaming in, straight to Harry’s bed. Where Harry sat up, looking straight at me.
I grabbed at my collar dramatically, pretending to clutch my pearls. “You wound me Potter!”
It was Christmas Eve when Voldemort had returned to the Manor and tortured Draco and his family out of anger, anger at letting Harry escape once more when his snake Nagini had failed to trap Harry and, presumably, Hermione, at Godric’s Hollow.
“Simply
“HARRY! You’re going to be late for class! Wake up!” Weasley was pounding at the door so hard it was a wonder it was still held on by the hinges.
“Do you want to head back? It’s gone 11” he asked me quietly.
I scoffed slightly and tried to hide my smile “We’ll be seeing each other soon, we’ve got Charms in…” I cast a quick Tempus and swore. “2 minutes, fuck I need to go.” I ran out of the door, forgetting to put any clothes on and went to my room, leaving Harry with his mouth hanging open.
Draco can't stop thinking of Harry's last words to him and goes to his room for a chat
“I mean I don’t know if I am gay.” He mumbled quietly. He seemed quite dejected, which actually pissed me off a bit.
“Merlin’s bollocks Pansy, I’m not changing my boxers!”
“So why don’t you like coming to the pub Malfoy?” He asked me, quietly so he wouldn’t be overheard. His consideration was actually endearing.
I smiled back and tried to ignore my heartbeat going mental against my ribs. “I did too, Harry.”
Draco took another small step forward. “Do you remember your classes? Quidditch? Do you remember who you studied with in the afternoons?”
“I didn’t say it was the weekend, just that we should celebrate it” he knocked his shoulder against hers and she started giggling. Really, what an adorably cute couple, would Potter and I be like that? Gods, I hope not. Though I kind of do if I’m honest.
“But…” I tried to speak but my scarf blocked out any words.
Harry’s eyes twinkled as he looked over at me and I rolled my eyes at him. He completed his order and we returned to the table with our drinks and cutlery. This was the first time I had ever had to pick up my own drink and cutlery in a ‘restaurant’, I still wasn’t convinced by this Nando’s.
“I’ve been wanting to do that all morning” Harry whispered against my mouth, lips moving gently against mine. We launched into a fresh attack, teeth smashing as we kissed as if our lives depended on it.
Fuck.
Under Harry’s touch Draco felt safer, but it still took a while for his panic attack to fade. He tried to slow his breaths as he tried not to think too much on why Harry was here in the first place. Was he here to ask Draco to leave, to go back? Would he wish for Draco to return to his sure death? Draco gasped and tried to force his mind away from that line of thought.
“Alright then, well I will leave it to it then guys.” Said the waiter, barely waiting for a response before he hurried off.
I think you already know.
Harry moved his head back to look into Draco’s eyes. Draco stoked a thumb over Harry’s cheekbone, and Harry’s face leant into the touch.
I smiled back. “May I ask who is the prat?”
He looked straight into my eyes. Damn these Gryffindors. “I really have Draco, but under different circumstances if I’m honest.” He scratched the back of his neck off-handily. “Though I’m glad we had this chat, I feel like I know you better already.”
“Do you guys want to say goodbye?” Hermione’s voice broke a little at the end of the sentence with a painful emotion. She hated the fact that she had been the one entrusted to perform the spell, but for her best friends she would do anything.
An arm wrapped around his waist and pulled Draco into a warm embrace, back against chest. A hand moves from his neck to his forehead, and Draco feels his head gently laid down on Harry’s shoulder, facing towards his neck, the sight so familiar his chest contracted and finally loosened. Slowly his breathing returned to normal, the fog cleared from his mind and as he opened his eyes he could see well enough, the light from the sunrise gently filtering through the trees.
We sat in silence again. Merlin, what was I thinking, coming here at midnight and just staring at Harry like a fucking weirdo? I was about to get up and run to my room when he reached over and grabbed my hand.
He looked away from his friends to their other companions and saw Dean help Griphook up into a sitting position. Harry went to them, hoping to forget the sight of his best friends and his childhood nemesis
“Sort out my room
So it took me a while to wrap my head around this chapter and honestly I'm not 100% sure about it, but hey! Let me know what your thoughts are :)
For the first time in months Draco cried. He cried with joy, knowing that there was someone out there that he loved, someone who
Dean looked at him with a grimace on his face. “We were caught by a band of snatchers, there were… there were four of us.” His voice broke slightly.
“And that’s in, you can be tucked in bed by 10 if you want to” Weasley finished.
because we couldn’t stop giggling. Harry couldn’t contain his laughter as I told him how it took a very confused and worried third year to mumble “your age” to the door for it to finally open.
Harry’s knuckles on his wand turned white in anger and he started raising it slowly, casually taking aim at Malfoy. Malfoy seemed to know something was going on in Harry’s mind though as he started turning to him. As he saw Harry’s wand taking aim at him, his eyes widened in shock, but before he could do anything a flurry of bushy hair ran and jumped into his arms.
“Thank you! She’s my pet ferret, her name is Lucy. You can’t tell from the tattoo, but her coat is pure white.”
“Yeah, you’ll be back hating each other’s guts” Pansy added with a smirk.
As we got to the edge of the village, I realised I hadn’t yet let go of Potter’s arm, so I quickly dropped it. He gave me a quizzical look, and I guess he saw the flush I could feel growing on my cheeks because he grinned at me and didn’t mention it. I quickly asked him how the Quidditch training had gone, and for the rest of the journey he excitedly told me how the Weaslette was managing the team. Even though I knew Potter and the Weaslette were broken up, sometimes I felt a slight twinge of jealousy that only Potter’s flirting could alleviate. I don’t know why, just call me a romantic.
I gulped and looked around. In normal circumstances I would have sat on his desk chair, but that had been long buried in what looked like half of Harry’s wardrobe. There were no other chairs, and I didn’t bother looking for any other excuses before I sat on the foot of Harry’s bed, facing him.
before another friend died because of him.
He shook his head slightly and looked at me. “My cousin’s nickname from his friends was Big D, that just reminded me.” He fell silent
“Yes I’m fine… better than fine actually. Thank you again for listening.”
“Why don’t you want to come Malfoy? You know we’re not going to kill you – probably” Weasley said, laughing at his own terrible joke.
Harry put Draco down gently and they both took a moment to rearrange themselves before going back, their eyes never leaving the other and ecstatic smiles were shared. With a nod, the couple began their trek back to the camp, hands held firmly together and a comfortable silence enveloping them. There was a lot they needed to talk about, a lot of time to make up for, but for now
“Merlin, I hope so” was that Hermione? “I was close to locking them both into a room until they talked, Harry has been pining since the start of term.”
that they would stay together, was met.
I cast a Tempus and swore.
“Er, I do.” I was so confused.
My mind went back to a time during the summer holiday that I snuck out of the Manor to go to London by myself. I wanted to get away from the drama, leave the trials behind and get away from father for one afternoon. I had gone to muggle London, and visited the British Museum and for hours I had wondered round looking at all the different ancient art pieces and the history behind them. I had ended up in front of The Discobolus, an ancient Roman statue of an athlete throwing a discus. I read its story, oh how a man called Hyacinth was accidentally killed by a discus thrown by his lover Apollo. I had stared for a long time at the statue and thought of the story it represented, the pain Apollo must have felt at accidentally killing his lover.
Harry laughed. “Oh I’m sorry love, I forgot. You look positively demonic when you sleep.”
Bellatrix rolled her eyes and walked past the wolf. She looked at Draco’s beloved and froze.
Harry realised with shock that Hermione was sobbing as she hugged Malfoy to herself, squeezing him so hard Harry was shocked to see Malfoy still standing. Clearly whatever feeling had taken Hermione over was reciprocated though, as Malfoy hugged her back and lifted her in his arms in an almost possessive hug.
Harry stayed quiet, but he reshuffled our hands so that our fingers entwined and he gripped it harder still. I almost didn’t dare to carry on, what if Harry would turn around and leave me, and never talk to me again?
Harry looked back on his and Draco’s history as he watched Draco sleep. It was never easy for them at first, their similar character traits making them prone to quick arguments. But with time and help from both their sets of friends, they got to understand each other in a way that neither had ever encountered and things moved quickly from there. Within a year they were living together, and by their third anniversary they were married. Both had changed a lot since they were kids, though their rivalry still existed, only now it was handled with love and laughter, not sneers and insults.
I started drifting back into fantasy land, where Potter and I did unspeakable things in the men’s room when I felt real-life Potter nudge me with his knee under the table. Holding back a happy sigh I looked at him questioningly.
“So… Harry doesn’t remember?” Draco asked, trying to sound casual. The image of Harry looking at him with such blatant distrust was burnt into his mind, more painful than he had imagined it would be.
“Draco, when you’re ready to order you go to the counter and order there. Do you know what you want?” he asked me again.
“May I take you to bed Mr Potter?” He asked Draco.
I rolled my eyes at him. “So you kissed one bloke and you’re having a whole big gay-crisis over it?”
, making Draco shudder and wrap his legs firmly around Harry’s head to keep him in place.
“What is this, Greyback? What right do you think you have to come to my home at this time?” His cold voice filled the room and Harry
Now, to knock or not to knock? Knocking could be loud, it might invite certain nosey arseholes where they don’t belong. But what if Harry didn’t appreciate midnight visitors? What if he was asleep – or worse, what if he was doing something that he didn’t want to be walked in on? But more importantly, did I really care if I walked in on Harry, presumably, naked? Or wanking? I guess I could pretend to be horrified.
The faint
“Good” he said and pulled away from me, grabbing my hand again and linking our fingers together. “Well if it’s all the same to you, I’d like to go back to our date, I’m starving.”
“Harry are you up already?! Let me in!” Weasley carried on with his foolish endeavour to break the door down.
Draco was trying very hard not to break apart as Hermione held him tightly. What the fuck had he done?! Not only had he publicly declared his allegiance to Harry Potter – in front of Voldemort’s strongest supporters, mind you, who were also his FAMILY
Harry struggled to keep on his feet as he, Hermione, Ron, Dean and Griphook were dragged, all tied together, into Malfoy Manor. He was trying to think quickly of a way to get out of here, get everyone out, without anyone dying. His chest was constricted with an anxiety he had felt once before, a lifetime ago, when another mistake had led to the death of his godfather. It couldn’t happen again, it won’t, he would
He spurted at that. “What, seriously? Never?”
“That’s a lovely tattoo” Harry said, as if he couldn’t help himself, and as the lady noticed what he meant she let out a laugh like a bird.
“Well I meant literally, you literally are a daft git”
Panting, Harry lifted off Draco and took in the glorious sight of his flustered husband. His silver/gold hair was ruffled and a blush had made its way to his ears. His pupils had practically swallowed the silver of his eyes and he stared at Harry reproachfully.
Potter grinned and held my stare “well at least I know my odds are high.” He murmured.
As we slowed down with our eating the conversation picked up. We talked about our different classes and shared stories and laughed together. I told Harry a story of how Pansy, Blaise and I had once tried to sneak into the Ravenclaw common room because we had heard that Terry Boot had smuggled a crate of Firewhiskey in, but we couldn’t get past the riddle the door sang to us,
I stared looking towards Harry’s door for a while before I turned to my own room and locked myself inside. All I could think of was the look in his eyes when he said those words.
Oh my God, a
“Father made it very clear that my unnatural tendencies, as he put it, should not get in the way of me fulfilling my duty. He said that under no circumstances am I allowed to pursue any unnatural relationships, and he has vowed to find me a wife by the summer. He believes he can ‘cure’ me, you see.” My throat started burning and I stopped myself from talking so I wouldn’t cry.
We looked at each other.
A sob threatened to make its way out of Draco’s throat as Ron’s arms surrounded him and Hermione and Draco finally sagged. The feeling of support from his friends was powerful and he felt safe for the first time in months. He let the tears fall as he soaked in the feeling of love from his friends.
He finally took his hand away from mine and I immediately missed the warmth. “Over the summer” he replied. “After the trials and everything life was so… overwhelming, you know? The media was practically stalking me, fans followed me everywhere. But for the first time I felt free, there wasn’t a freak trying to kill me for the first time in my life and I felt for the first time that I could actually breathe. So I started going out with my friends, we would Apparate to different towns and just go out for the day, or for dinner or clubbing. One night a few of us went clubbing to Manchester, and that was the first time I ever made out with a man.”
“But Professor, he’s no longer part of Slytherin!” Harry dared to say.
“Yeah he was, we only went out to muggle clubs, cause you know, all the media thing. None of us felt comfortable being followed around by journalists and photographers.”
His mind spun, searching for a way out, trying to work out a way to get his Love and his friends out of danger. He locked the panic away for now, he needed his mind clear if they were all going to make it out alive today.
Sharp claws grabbed him by the shoulder, a stench of blood, sweat and nightmares clouded his mind as Greyback dragged the group through the Manor into what looked like a sitting room.
“OK let me finish my drink and we can go” I said, smiling at him. I only had about half of my drink left, so I took the only reasonable action I could think of and chugged the thing down. Potter’s quiet chuckle made my stomach flip in a way that all the Firewhiskey I had drunk so far couldn’t. He was looking at me and I felt myself blush. There was something in his eyes, could it possibly be –
“I know what you mean” he finally said after a while, looking at the ground as he walked. “You know, before I came to Hogwarts, I went to a muggle primary school, and there was this kid who everyone thought was gay, I think his name was Mike. Anyways, he used to get picked on quite a bit in school. Other kids would call him ‘fag’, they would throw things at him and just torment him. My cousin Dudley was awful to him, and he would tell my uncle about the ‘pranks’ he would play on Mike. And my stupid uncle would encourage him! He would laugh at Dudley’s bullying, he used to say that ‘homos shouldn’t be allowed in public’ and that they got what they deserved.” He sounded so sad and bitter it broke my heart.
“Just slow down Potter, fuck I’m sorry I didn’t mean to fucking insult you”
“Well… I’m sure you don’t want to date a Death Eater, right? Maybe I shouldn’t have said anything to remind you –”
“What’s going on?” Said a voice that promised nothing but pain from the doorway.
“Don’t forget these!” Pansy yelled, and I turned around in time for a flying pair of boxers to hit me in the face, quickly followed by a neatly folded pair of socks.
We spent the remainder of the lesson practising, me calmly explaining exactly how to do the spell, him trying his best whilst his attention held and eventually managing to conjure a vinegar fountain. My fountain was popular amongst both the students and Flitwick, and when the bell rang for break, I was pleasantly tipsy.
He just laughed. “I’ll remember that for tonight then, I’ll make sure there’s plenty of fancy wine for my poncy prat. And I’ll just be kind of there.”
“I didn’t want you to be killed.” He instead said simply. Harry’s eyes glimmered with a feeling Draco couldn’t quite tell and he had to look away, their eye contact becoming too intense. He stood up and stretched his back, feeling it pop, before he turned once more towards Harry and saw him looking at him still. He raised his eyebrow in a silent question, not sure if he should talk.
About 6 minutes later I skidded in front of the Charms classroom and burst in through the door. Everyone turned to look at me, so I awkwardly mumbled an apology and went straight to the back of the class. I could hear my classmates snickering and I glanced at the desk where Harry normally sat and he beamed at me, motioning to the empty desk next to him. I hurried over and dived to the seat, hoping to hide my embarrassment as quickly as possible behind my textbook.
“I don’t know Malfoy, can’t say I have much experience in losing to Slytherin.”
Instantly, Draco’s arm burnt, and his Harry moaned on the floor. Draco knew that meant his scar had burnt too – Voldemort was on the way.
Talking about being ignorant, my father’s face bloomed to mind. “My father used to tell me elaborate stories in which the muggles were always the bad monsters. I believed that all muggles were evil, and they would kill wizards if they knew we existed. He was particularly fond of retelling witch hunt stories, muggles were always so cruel in those.”
But instead of breaking apart, Draco came alive. Memories of Harry, of his face, his smile, his lips on his. Their arms around each other, tumbling naked in sheets, making love in a vast pool with a mermaid on the window. So many memories flooded Draco that a sob escaped, making Voldemort lift the curse.
He looked at me a while longer and then turned to carry on walking to the castle, keeping that slow pace from before.
“Oh Draco, thank you so much for what you’ve done, you’ve saved our lives!” Hermione sobbed into Malfoy’s shoulder. He simply hugged her harder, letting out a shuddering breath as he squeezed his eyes shut.
“Harry? Draco? Where are you guys?” Hermione asked, sounding far too close for comfort.
“Draco…” he said.
“I’m… I’m sorry, Dean. Er… you can bring Griphook inside, there are plenty of beds where he can rest.”
Draco turned to his parents and raised his wand to them.
“Hey, hey, hey” Harry said, tugging us both to a stop and he turned me round to face him. “Don’t say that, how can a child ignore his parents?”
They started grinding against each other ruthlessly, the room filling with the sweet sound of Harry’s moans. Harry grabbed Draco’s arse cheeks in his hands and squeezed them before flipping them over once more, so he was on top again.
“Draco can you pass me my dictionary?” Asked Hermione, dragging me from my thoughts.
Harry moved over to Draco and crouched next to the sofa so he was on eye level with his husband. “Would you like a cup of tea, love?” He asked, gently stroking a lock of hair off of Draco’s face. Draco’s grey eyes met Harry’s, and he nodded sadly, with a dramatic pout and the cutest puppy eyes that a grown man should never make.
“I don’t see either of you boys practicing!” Said a high-pitched voice right behind me, and in my surprise I almost crushed little Professor Flitwick. “Careful Mr Malfoy, 10 points from Slytherin!”
Harry moaned at the brush of magic and tightened his grip on me. I couldn’t move even if I wanted to, and why the fuck would I move? I felt like I was literally in heaven.
“What kind of weird place did you bring me to, Potter?” I asked as I stood. What kind of fucked up restaurant made its customers queue up to order food to be brought to them to their table?! “Why are we queueing again?”
I groaned out and stayed silent, shutting my eyes for a few seconds. When I opened them I saw Harry looking at me, but staying silent. I appreciated the fact that he didn’t pressure me to talk, it was a tough subject. I sat up and moved to sit next to him, and leant against the headboard – the idea of looking into the eyes that pulled me out of that fire would be too much.
“Don’t worry about it.” I quickly said.
“That would be fair” he agreed.
Zabini laughed. “I’m glad someone learnt them. Well, have fun Potter, and don’t do anything I wouldn’t do Mr D.” He winked at me and returned to the dormitories.
Harry was gripping Draco’s jumper tight, his knuckles white. His eyes were squeezed shut against something and he swayed backwards slightly. Draco held him by his shoulders gently and give him space.
I held Potter’s stare. I could hear Weasley and Hermione quietly having their 273th daily catch up, so I knew they hadn’t heard my conversation with Potter.
Another voice was talking in the hallway, not whispering but talking quickly to Weasley. “For Gods’ sake Ronald you’ll disturb the whole castle! Harry!” She clearly moved closer to the door. “We’re going to class, see you there.”
“What for?” He asked me, frowning.
“Nothing to worry about chap, just get going.” Blaise said, wrapping me in my favourite fur-lined cloak and practically strangling me with my scarf. “Just have a wonderful time, let me walk you out.”
loved him back. Cried with grief, because he and the man he loved could not be together without fear of one of them dying. Cried with despair, as he thought of Harry almost dying at Voldemort’s hands, wondering where he was and if his injuries were life threatening.
I gave him a patented Malfoy glare and rolled up my sleeves. “Watch and learn Potter.”
“Ron, it’s Wednesday” Hermione snorted.
Draco moved slightly to sit facing Harry, pulling him away from a fresh bout of memories.
Silently we made our way to the boy’s dormitories. My room was further down the hall, past Harry’s, but once we reached his room, he made no move to let go of my hand until we reached my own room. We stopped walking when we got to my door, and turned to face each other. I wasn’t yet ready to let him go.
“Oh, I’m watching” he said with a smirk. “Don’t think there’s anything to learn from you though.”
Draco was rooted to the spot, staring at his mother. “Mother… what?” He asked, feeling dumb.
“And that’s what you love about me” Potter said, waggling his eyebrows.
I half rose off his bed, but his hand tightened on mine and pulled me back. “No, it’s OK Draco, I just don’t want to talk about Ginny, it’s not my place to out her.”
“I know” Draco replied with a grin. “Don’t take long.”
Harry pulled his face away from his husband to look down on him as he came, and pounded his arse in punishing strokes to drag out his orgasm. As Draco became limp in his arms, Harry let go and came, hard, into Draco, moaning loud enough for the neighbours to hear, loud enough for the both of them. He collapsed into Draco, who automatically moved his arms around Harry and gripped him possessively to his chest.
Familiarity definitely did
“So, Draco, to what do I owe this midnight pleasure?” he finally said, breaking the silence.
He turned to look at Ron, expecting to see the same look of shock and confusion in his eyes, but Harry was again stunned to see Ron not only look almost
“They do.” I said, rather sharply. He looked at me again.
As I helped myself to roast chicken and veggies, I couldn’t help but look up at Potter every so often. It wasn’t that our subtle flirting was anything new – we had been playfully flirting since the beginning of term. But today… he seemed more forward right? Him talking about his odds like that… I mean, of course his odds are high anyway, but Merlin! If he asked me to I would drop to my knees, whenever and wherever he wanted.
I summoned the blankets up to cover us both and gripped Harry close to me. I laid my face on his head and dropped a gentle kiss on his head, and let myself drift off back to sleep.
Harry grinned as Draco twisted his body slightly so both his legs came up on the sofa and he rested his feet on Harry’s lap. “I don’t need sugar in my tea, I’m sweet enough thank-you-very-much.” He said, wiggling his eyebrows at his husband as he automatically started rubbing Draco’s feet.
He just winked at me “we’ll work out the details tonight.” He grabbed his bag and walked off to class, leaving my heart beating madly in his wake.
We locked gazes and for a while we just stared into each other’s eyes. I felt like I was floating, yet tethered to this bed by his emerald eyes.
“Teasing my husband, what does it look like?” Harry offered a wicked grin, and licked Draco’s rim as soft as anything.
Draco closed his eyes to enjoy the foot rub for a few seconds, then opened his eyes and stared at Harry, his exhaustion palpable in his expression.
His answering smile was so full of happiness I couldn’t help grinning back. He leaned his face close to mine, our lips almost brushing together when he whispered, “my boyfriend” and kissed me, tentatively, as my eyes fell shut. He pulled away and it took me a second to pull myself together and open my eyes to look at him. I smiled at him and leant down to kiss him again.
The feeling of desperation threatened to overwhelm him. The sight of Harry raising a wand at him with white knuckles had been far more painful than any bout of Cruciatus curse had been, and yet not nearly enough for him to hate himself desperately for the position he had left his mother in. He knew she could take care of herself, she was an impressive duellist and so fucking smart – she knew how to hide in plain sight, how to walk in and out of rooms without being noticed. She was Draco’s hero… and he had left her to the wolves.
He faced his mother. He didn’t want to hurt her, but he needed to save his friends, his boyfriend. He couldn’t leave them to die.
“And secondly, I have never been to a restaurant with colourful menus.”
“I get it, I mean I’ve been there too” I looked at him sheepishly. “I’m gay, and I agree it’s definitely weird when you first start figuring it out. Everyone always talks about love and shit like it belongs only between a man and a woman, there’s no fairy tales of men falling in love.” Did I sound bitter? Merlin I fucking hoped not.
disturbing my beauty sleep.”
A silencing charm shut him up. Draco turned to see who had cast it.
Draco realised with another pang to his heart that Harry had carded his fingers through his hair, just like he had Before. He kept his eyes closed to enjoy the feeling for a few moments, hoping this wouldn’t be the last time but expecting it would be. He hoped to stay like this forever with Harry looking after him, but was not surprised when Harry gently pulled away, Draco relishing the fact that Harry hadn’t fully let him go yet.
We sat like that in silence for a while, and I was pleased to notice it wasn’t awkward at all. But then I started thinking about the reason why I came to Harry’s room in the first place and I tensed slightly.
“Good evening, is everything alright?” Said the waiter, and Draco realised with a start that this waiter was barely older than he himself. Harry just looked at me, looking concerned and as if he was trying to contain his laughter.
Yes, Harry thought irritably, he could remember some of his classes, and of course he could remember Quidditch, he won the Quidditch Cup that year! And of course he studied in the afternoons with Hermione every day in the common room and in the library…
Harry turned towards me and wrapped both arms around my waist as he looked into my eyes. He was only a few inches shorter than me, but the way he carried himself around made him seem taller and it was always a surprise to have to lean down to see him.
, it was time.
“How about The Incredibles?” I asked.
“Yeah, of course.” Potter scratched the back of his head awkwardly. “So… do you still want to come? I’ll buy you a drink?” He said, and he almost sounded hopeful.
The kiss was short, but everything Draco had hoped for. He drew his head back slightly so he could see the look on Harry’s face, to try to determine what he was thinking.
Harry Potter didn’t know he was a wizard, when the entire wizarding world knew his name? “That’s just… wow.” I really didn’t know what to say to that.
He nodded down at her and Ron let out a long breath.
“I can’t make that sort of promise, you know what I’m like.” He said, teasingly, to Draco. “But I can promise I will try not to be an insufferable saviour.”
I stared down to the ground and didn’t reply. Harry just pulled me into a hug, holding me tightly. “It’s not your fault, Draco. None of it was” he whispered into my ear. “Don’t blame yourself for your parents’ mistakes, they’re not yours to pay for.”
The sky had begun to lighten to a dull grey, though it barely filtered through the trees. Draco begun walking in no particular direction, following what looked like an animal trail, trying to organise his thoughts.
“Potter, take my son and GO!” She said loudly. She went to Draco and gave him a last, desperate hug.
“Harry… I’ve called you by that name for over a year now.”
“It’s your turn, Malfoy” Harry teased at me.
“I guess so? That was literally the first time he’s ever called me that.”
“Being a few minutes late to class won’t get you into much trouble.” He nudged my side and I flushed even more.
“Yeah come on grandma, live a little!” Pansy said, pinning my arms by my side in a ferocious hug. “Pleaaaaaaase!”
“So you’ve been waiting all this time for me to come along?” I really hoped I sounded as casual as him.
“So, Potter, you still don’t like it when Slytherin beats Gryffindor?” I asked cockily, looking at my nails as if I was above this conversation.
Potter actually stopped walking, so I stopped and watched him, wondering what he was thinking.
Harry and I walked with Weasley, Hermione, Pansy and Blaise, all of us definitely louder than usual and prone to giggles. We made our way to the courtyard without any incident, beyond Blaise and Pansy both flirting with a very attractive man in a painting from the 1600s. Though he was very flattered, the rest of us thought it prudent not to let those sorts of feelings fester. I grabbed a giggling Pansy and pulled her away as she pouted and blew kisses at the portrait.
“Good, then. I’ll Apparate us there, are you ready?”
spot, causing Draco to drop his head back into the pillows. Harry kissed down Draco’s neck as he pulled at Draco’s cock, twisting it just so at the tip as Draco liked it. As Harry sucked a love bite into life on Draco’s collarbone, Draco’s nails dug into Harry’s shoulders and his arse
He seemed a bit uncomfortable at the question, so I quickly backtracked. “No don’t say, this is clearly not appropriate, just forget I came here…”
Draco smirked.
I frowned a bit at that last part, who wouldn’t remember snogging the Saviour himself? “Was the bloke a muggle?”
“Graceful, Potter” I couldn’t help but tease.
I quickly checked that Harry was still sleeping, undisturbed by me. A quick Tempus told me it was nearly 6 in the morning, though the moonlight coming from the window distracted from the soon-to-come daybreak. As I waited for my heartrate to calm down I took my time in studying Harry’s sleeping form.
After a while I noticed I’d fallen silent, but Harry didn’t pressure me to talk. I felt lighter than I had felt in a long time, with a jolt I realised I hadn’t truly felt at ease since fourth year.
Draco has a very eventful morning-after
As Hermione’s robes whispered and she raised her wand, Harry closed his eyes and thought of Draco’s smile, how his lips felt on his, the smell and feel of him…
Fuck no. “Yeah, sure.”
“I thought we were going to be more subtle around them my love? I know they’re dying to shag but we don’t have to make them feel uncomfortable about it.” And with that my other best mate Blaise joined us, proving to me once and for all why I had felt the need to expand my group of friends away from wretched Slytherins. Now don’t get me wrong, I love being (having been?) a Slytherin, but Merlin what a bunch of self-serving twats. I hate my friends.
We finally made it to the courtyard where we got into a heated discussion of the realities of dating paintings when Harry tugged my arm to call my attention. I looked at him and he discretely cocked his head to the side, signalling a more secluded alcove where we could easily hide. I followed him there.
Harry stood up and waited for me to get up with him.
After months of practice they both walked in front of the wall 3 times until a door appeared, leading to a small room with a large bed. They had been spending days of their time in this room, getting to know each other and their bodies, learning everything there was to know of the other.
“That sounds great guys, but I need to finish my translation” I said, before popping broccoli in my mouth.
“I know you didn’t, sorry. I’m just confused and trying to make sense of everything.”
Harry reached his hand out and brushed a tear off Draco’s lashes. “I know, love. But your aunt and Voldemort can access our minds, this is the only way to keep you safe.”
Linda signed her farewells to Draco and was let out by Harry. Harry came back into the living room to see Draco rub his eyes with exhaustion, slumped back onto the sofa.
He left the room.
We were laying on our sides face to face, one of my arms slung over his waist. Harry’s face was just a few inches away from my neck, as if he had been sleeping with his face tucked there. One of his legs was between my own, the other flung around my hips, and both his arms were around my waist and clinging to me like Devil’s Snare. The bed covers were half-off the bed, and whereas I had sweated through my pyjamas, Harry was still in his boxers and his skin felt cold to the touch.
“Indeed. Can’t discount any blackmail material.” I gave him my most Malfoy-ish smirk I could muster and he laughed.
I sniffed a bit and pulled a handkerchief out of my pocket, separating fully from Harry so I could blow my nose. “I’m sorry” I mumbled.
“Wait, Draco.” Harry struggled to get up, but finally freed himself from his sheets. He walked up to me and stood in front of me, roughly a foot away. “I… had a nice night with you.” He rubbed the back of his neck. “Can I meet with you later?”
“I think I would like that very much.” I whispered.
Harry turned and walked back to his bed, and sat himself near the headboard. Putting his cup down on the bedside table, he pulled the covers up to cover his legs. He looked at me almost expectantly and said “would you like to sit?”
She simply raised an eyebrow in the most perfect arc I had ever witness (except maybe Headmistress McGonagall). “Underwear are clothes Draco, I didn’t think I would ever have to teach you that. Besides, don’t you want to impress Potter on your date?”
, he wanted to reply but didn’t dare. Of course Harry didn’t know, the spell still clouded his memories of them together, of the words they had whispered to each other for months, the promises they had made to each other.
Harry snorted. “Don’t worry Zabini, at least I learnt how to cast privacy charms.”
“What were we, then?” He whispered.
“Oh, wow” Harry whispered, his eyes snapping open and looking at Draco as if seeing him for the first time. “
Harry sighed and turned to Hermione.
Harry’s mouth went dry as something stirred in his mind, as it something was trying to break free. He swallowed thickly before he said anything.
The recovery also drained a lot of energy from Draco and to this day he was only able to remain energetic for a couple of hours at a time. He and Harry would utilise those periods effectively by either going out for long walks, runs, or quick trips around the country for lunch or dinner. Harry would keep a constant stream of conversation during the outings, talking as both himself and Draco, which amused Draco to no end. On occasion Harry would make a rather terrific imitation of Draco’s drawl, which always earned him an elbow to the ribs and a grin from his husband.
“We don’t need to go to the Three Broomsticks, we could go to the Hogs Head, or even go somewhere else, maybe to the Leaky, or even this place called The Horntail down in Edinburgh, have you been? It’s a really quite nice, and quite nice, or we don’t have to go out at all we could just –“
I saw him smile faintly as he picked up his own cup and took a sip. “I just know, Draco.”
The clock chime indicating midday resonated loudly in the quiet living room, indicating the end of the lesson.
Draco wanted so badly to say yes, to run into the tent and know that Harry won’t look at him suspiciously, that they would both hug and be reunited, the past few months apart nothing but a nightmare to put to bed.
I needn’t have worried though, his eyes glinted with amusement and he winked at me when I felt my flush extend to my ears.
Draco’s eyes narrowing would have sent a lesser man running to the hills, but not Harry. With a grin he leant down to Draco’s mouth and covered it with his own, kissing him fiercely as he pushed into Draco in one, long stroke. When he was fully inserted, he paused to let Draco get used to being so filled.
“Er, I guess I’ll see you later?” I mumbled, finally getting off the bed and moving to grab my clothes to leave.
“Yes, we would like to order.” I told the waiter confidently.
“Me too” Draco soon agreed. They looked at each other again and simultaneously leant to each other for one last, lingering kiss, before they separated.
I rolled my eyes, clearly my former house losing points wasn’t an issue for Harry.
As Harry pressed a kiss to Draco’s Adam’s apple, he also shifted his hips, aligning their cocks through their trousers and rutted against Draco. Earth-shattering moans filled the clearing and their grip on each other tightened to bruise.
Draco rolled his eyes at him.
Harry frowned. “What does that mean?” He felt like a fool for repeating the same question so many times. He still had a feeling like he had forgotten something very important.
So when Draco saw Harry he couldn’t help but study his eyes, his face, looking for a sign of recognition, a sign that he knew who Draco was and what they had been to each other. He dared not look into his mind, not with his crazy father and a wild wolf in the room.
“And that’s bad how?!” Even I could tell I sounded rude.
“My, my Mr Malfoy, you certainly have good taste! Of course, this spell can recognise the caster’s drinking preferences and casts accordingly. May I ask, what wine is this?”
Harry gently laid down his husband to their bed without breaking their kiss, but Draco was not happy with taking it slow. He practically ripped Harry’s shirt off, causing his glassed to fly away and managed to get his on t-shirt off with Harry’s help. He grabbed Harry by his hair and crushed their lips together in a frantic kiss, rolling them both over so Draco was straddling Harry.
He seemed to notice that. His hand went to my thigh and he squeezed it reassuringly before he grabbed my hand. “The teachers aren’t like that, you know” he whispered at me reassuringly.
When Pansy started riffling through my underwear I snapped my tether. I practically launched myself through the room and slammed that drawer shut.
(See the end of the chapter for
We chatted idly whilst watching the muggles around us until our food arrived. Harry had also ordered half a chicken with hot sauce, and a massive plate of chips, which he immediately attacked. I looked at my chicken and back at Harry, sceptical on the quality. Harry and I made eye contact and he raised a questioning eyebrow at my hesitation. Without comment, I picked up my knife and fork, and carefully cut off a piece of chicken breast. I sniffed it, which made Harry laugh, and quickly put the piece of chicken in my mouth.
I gulped. “I… don’t know.”
All he knew was that Draco’s eyes were of the exact same shade of grey that had been in his dreams the last few months, a colour that inexplicably brought comfort to Harry on the loneliest of nights when he was cold and hungry, the nights when they weight of the responsibilities on his shoulders was too much to bear. It was a subconscious comfort that he hadn’t realised he had been relying on until he met those eyes.
He turned to speak to Thomas and Finnigan, one of whom had somehow managed to conjure a tap-dancing fountain – though not before quickly refilling his goblet with my wine. With an almost-painful grin I turned back to Harry, who was staring at Flitwick’s retreating figure.
“Do your parents know?” He asked me quietly, bursting my happy bubble.
Draco narrowed his eyes.
I couldn’t help but smile. “It’s a vintage Bordeaux, from France. My mother’s favourite too.”
“Are you feeling better?” He asked me gently.
“The first time? So how many men have there been Potter?” I teased him, hoping my jealousy didn’t show through.
“Nonsense, Mr Potter. You can take the boy out of Slytherin, but you can’t take Slytherin out of the boy.” Flitwick beamed at me. “Mr Malfoy, would you be so kind as to help Mr Potter with the charm? He could do with your expertise.”
I could swear that he blushed a little, and he almost played it off by exaggeratedly fanning himself. “Malfoy, you sweet talker! Is this how you talk with all the boys or am I just that lucky?” He gave a really exaggerated gasp and threw me a mock glare.
“Actually, it was the wine that made it fun, you were just kind of there.” I couldn’t help but poke fun.
Draco turned his face towards Harry and gave him a needy kiss, biting his lip in earnest. His eyes bore into Harry’s, lust flooding out of them and into Harry’s chest.
I sagged slightly at his words and after a few seconds I hugged Harry back. We stood there together for a few minutes until I felt myself calm down. Harry was the first to pull back and for a brief second I thought he would call quits on our date, but he just smiled and gave me a lingering kiss on my lips.
“Which will be safer for us both, right Harry?” Draco asked me quietly.
“It’s the stuff of Gods, Draco. Trust me, you’ll love it.” He replies, not bothering to look up from the menu. I looked back down at the colourful menu, wondering what Harry was playing at in bringing me to a restaurant with colourful menus and décor. He
He laughed and blushed. “Yes, well, he really was the only guy I’ve been with. And I don’t mean been with, like in that way you know? Er, yeah, we just kissed.” He was scratching the back of his head, clearly uncomfortable and I felt rather bad for wanting to know literally everything else.
We ate mostly in silence, revelling in the flavours. The chatter from other patrons was persistent and I noticed that the queue of people waiting for a table was even longer than when we had arrived – clearly this Nando’s was very popular and even though I hated to admit it, it was already becoming one of my favourite restaurants.
Silence pressed heavy with their past and feelings, both known and unknown, on them both, until Harry broke it with one word, a question.
I glared at Pansy through the reflection in my mirror. Really, what was I thinking asking her for help in getting ready for my date with Harry when I was more than capable of getting presentable by myself.
By the time I finished relaying my order to him, it was out turn to order. We approached a lady at the counter with bright pink hair and covered in tattoos. As Harry gave her a table number (whatever that meant) and handed her a plastic card, she reached out with her arm and, beautifully tattooed on her forearm there was a ferret.
Harry didn’t know what to say.
“Erm… ok?” I said.
“There’s no need” Draco said. “We said everything we needed to last night.” He lifted Harry’s hand to his mouth and pressed a kiss to the back of his hand.
“Oh will you two just make out already!” And darling Pans joined us. She sat next to me and gave me a peck on the cheek, like the Judas she is.
Harry scoffed and squeezed my hand affectionately. “So what would you like to talk about then?” He asked.
” Growled the wolf. “Let’s not forget it was I who did the legwork.”
That night, after he had nursed his wounds and erected every safety ward he knew outside his bedroom door, Draco felt safe enough to examine the memories.
“Harry… I’m scared” he whispered. “I know it’s the right thing to do but… I would hate to die thinking of you as my enemy, I would almost rather keep the memories to help keep me strong.”
Hearing Potter’s barked laughter made me feel lighter, but nothing like when he grabbed my arm in an affectionate squeeze. “No one has said we can’t help our team train though.”
I swallowed hard, my heart seemed to be trying to jump out of my throat.
He fell silent again and I could feel I had touched a sore spot by the look of his face. “Sorry, Harry, it’s none of my business, just ignore –”
“Shut up” I mumbled back, though with no real bite. He shook with restrained laughter as Flitwick started talking about whatever the class was going to be about.
“That’s ok, anytime” he said smiling. “Though maybe next time it can wait ‘till morning?” He joked – or at least I hoped.
Harry shrugged his shoulders. “I remember him, he showed me to my vault when I turned 11.”
Boy, did I understand. “I know what you mean” I blurted before I realised.
Draco arched his back as Harry feasted, licking and slurping at Draco’s pucker. His silent moans were deafening in Harry’s mind as he wrapped his lips around the pucker and
“That’s a great idea, you guys know I can’t write a proper Transfiguration paper if I’m not buzzed” Blaise said, making Pansy laugh.
Every day they had an hour-long session with Linda, who was teaching them both sign language. Harry had been much more enthusiastic to learn than Draco, but they both diligently learned everything that Linda taught them, and Draco did all the reading she had recommended.
The most surprising change in this new life could be this new acceptance within the 8th year group that had come back. True, not many had bothered – most students had found jobs or apprenticeships, or had travelled abroad. Not everyone wanted to return to the castle haunted by the ghosts of their friends. But mother had insisted I return. With father in prison and the Malfoy name tainted, she said I wasn’t likely to get employed without any NEWTs.
We separated a few minutes later to gasp for breath, still clinging as if neither of us ever wanted to separate.
Instead, he shook his head. “Thank you, Hermione, but… I think it might be too soon you know? We just got reunited, I don’t think he’s ready yet.”
His friends stumbled around him, Griphook moaned in pain somewhere behind me, and Harry refused to meet Malfoy’s eyes, lest he recognised them.
of his friends Disapparating echoed in the hall as Harry grabbed Draco's hand. They met each other's eyes and Draco thought he saw something in Harry's, confusion and… comprehension?
“Is there something you want to talk about?” He asked quietly.
“Not tonight you don’t, tonight we part-ay!” Pansy said, elbowing me sharply so I almost choke to death on broccoli. And what a pathetic way to die that would be.
Being the architect of my own self destruction as I am, I ordered a fourth round of drinks. I was happily buzzed by now, listening to Potter, Weasley and Blaise argue about Quidditch and the Gryffindor and Ravenclaw game that was played the previous weekend. Blaise, being the loyal Slytherin that he was, insisted that there was no chance Slytherin would lose the cup with year, and Weasley’s hand gestures were becoming more and more erratic the more he drank and the more indignant he became.
Held in the warmth of Harry’s arms and listening to his breath as it steadied I was lulled into sleep.
It was when I noticed my fingers going numb with the cold that I realised we had been standing together for several minutes in silence. We both detangled from each other at the same time and, without talking, we turned to walk to the castle at the same time. I don’t know who reached out to whom first, but we held each other’s hand as we walked back. We stayed quiet all the way back to our common room, and when the portrait opened, I was relieved to not see anyone up. It wasn’t that I was ashamed of walking hand-in-hand with Harry, fuck no. I just wanted to treasure it for a while longer by myself.
He smiled at me “I believe I did, yes.”
And then I started talking. Quietly, I told him what it had been like, being arrested the day after the Battle of Hogwarts with both my parents, being held alone in the Ministry holding cells those few days until my charges were read out to me. Being placed under home arrest with my parents, my mother who was so calm and composed, but my father raging about the injustice of him being arrested. I told Harry what I had told no one, that seeing my father complaining at the audacity of the Ministry, and hearing his threats yelled out through the Manor, had made me finally lose my faith in my father. I told him how my father proved he felt no remorse at what he had done over the years, so when the trials came, and father was sentenced to life in prison I felt relief at finally being away from him.
Blaise just patted his shoulder. “Just kidding Potter, I don’t give a fuck what time you get back. Just be quiet, I don’t want any
I went back to those delicious lips and licked my way into his mouth again as we started slowly grinding together. My cock was achingly hard and protesting against my pants, but feeling Harry’s hardness against my hip made it all worth it. I broke our kiss just to sit up against him. I stared into his face as I re-positioned myself against him so we were perfectly lined up, and watched him groan deeply as his eyes rolled to the back of his head.
“Nice one Weasley” I rolled my eyes.
Linda laughed as she took Harry’s hand “Oh, I’m sure you two would manage.” She gave both Draco and Harry a twinkling look. “You two can already communicate so much without words, I’ve hardly ever seen a couple quite like you.”
A flash of grey crossed his mind and Harry’s eyes snapped up to meet Draco’s. Draco was looking at him intently, looking for a flash of something, some recognition that he had longed after for so long.
“Draco…” he whispered.
We stared at each other a moment longer.
Draco swallowed the lump in his throat, he didn’t want to waste time crying when he had Harry back in his arms. Instead, he replied “you did promise me you would, love.”
!” Blaise wiggled his eyebrows and bit his lip in a rather disturbing way.
to get back to, Draco took his punishment. And he knew they would be amazing, the feeling that had swooped in his heart as that unknown barrier came down left him no doubt that what had just been unlocked had been something special enough to lock away in the first place.
Draco took a small step forward. “What can you remember from sixth year, Harry?”
Draco jumped to action.
Harry looked back at Draco and they both nodded in agreement. He turned to look at Hermione and Pansy, the boys’ best friends and now their “Secret Keepers” – when the war ended, if both boys survived, it was the girls’ jobs to lift the spell and restore the memories. If one of them didn’t make it… well, they hadn’t really discussed that scenario, it was simply too painful to imagine.
Harry smiled gently at me and took my hand. “Do you want to go out for a walk before we head back?”
“So you kissed a bloke, that’s it?” I asked, really quite amused at the glare I got from him. “That’s great.”
Harry kept a gentle, teasing suction on Draco’s cock as he slowly fingered him, a second one soon joining in with the first. He teased Draco’s slit with his tongue at the same time as he found Draco’s prostrate which made Draco’s entire body jerk.
Harry sat quietly whilst I talked, simply listening to me and nodding to show he was paying attention. He did not interrupt me, but when the incident at Diagon Alley came up he gripped my hand so hard it almost hurt. I whispered how scared I was at the idea of leaving the Manor, and how I had begged my mother to stay home when she had insinuated us having a day trip to London for some shopping. At this, Harry reached his arm around me, and tucked me close to him in what felt like the warmest hug I had ever gotten.
