How is he supposed to know how to respond to that? For starters, he barely understands the answer himself. And secondly, he would really rather jump off the Astronomy tower than be here, discussing the complexities of his encounter with Death, with an eleven year old boy whom he has never met before. He looks perplexed and dissatisfied at Harry’s half answer and the expectation of a follow-up is weighing, so Harry inches away, towards the bottom of the steps. Today is not the day to ponder about whether he should be alive or not. What ifs are dangerous, he has learnt. He thinks it certainly feels like the right time to avert an existential crisis.
“Hi, Potter,” he replies breezily. He sounds unsurprised to see Harry. It is nothing like his venomous words of the other day.
They are soon moving through Hogsmeade and everywhere Harry turns, he catches glimpses and flashes of ghosts of a battle once fought. He looks to the Hogshead Inn, and a memory replays in his head of Aberforth hurrying him, Ron and Hermione inside in the dead of the night. It drifts away but the recollection of the blaring alarm still screeches. Over at the Three Broomsticks, the image of Malfoy striding through the pub purposefully, his mission: to Imperio Katie Bell, is stuck in his mind's eye. He almost thinks he can see that blonde head of hair now through the window panes, a look of terror painted upon his features. He squints, and it’s somebody else, laughing and punching their friend’s arm, expression liberated in joy.
This strikes a blow in Harry’s stomach. It is absolutely not a positive message, since he is pretty much being told to fuck off in more formal terms, but he is almost certain that everything Malfoy is saying is being filtered through that facade of his. Harry can see that he is angry- his flexing fists, his deep set brow and stormy eyes, they all reveal what Malfoy is trying to suppress- and Harry despises how he pretends otherwise.
Surely enough, as his fingernails get dirtier with soil, he loses himself in the rhythm of repotting. For all his awkwardness in their adolescence, Neville has grown into an astutely aware individual. He seems to sense Harry’s reluctance to speak, and respects it from a safe distance. The sun streams through the glass roof of the greenhouse, blocked only by the untamed ivy that rules the place, and not the other way around. Wood and earthy smells drift in and out of the open window. He likes it here.
He doesn’t move for a split second, and neither does the boy against him. There is one tense beat- the calm before the storm. They are simply frozen where they stand. Then Malfoy ruins it by shoving him right in the chest and, though it wasn’t particularly forceful, Harry feels the pain of it throughout his body.
Alas, he has no choice but to bury that pit somewhere where the sun doesn't shine as signs of the forthcoming day start to show themselves. This is primarily the ceasing of the snoring from his roommates, which, at an almost Ron-like level, blare out aggressively through the night. Anthony, in particular, is a powerhouse of noise once sleep takes him. For a boy who started out so quiet, he has proven to be rather raucous in his grandest moments.
“Professor, I-” he starts to explain, but loses his words. “I don’t know. He needs help. Now. I put him under a Stasis Charm, but I don’t think it will hold.”
“Oh yeah, that’s good,” he tries to conjure up something interesting to say and finds nothing except, “The weather is nice today.”
The following day refuses to bring Harry any clarity and he feels cheated. Why was the phrase ‘sleep on it’ ever invented if doing just that made his brain fuzzier than before?
Harry sighs, resigned. He would have assumed that the bastard would have gone to bed by now, even in spite of the fact that he wasn’t there when he left. They must be as insane as each other, to both be out at four in the morning. He feels a bit cheated, and more than a little pissed off. This was supposed to be
“Lemme get that,” says Ron and Hermione holds out her face in anticipation. For a moment, it seems like Ron is actually being a tentative boyfriend in helping her remove the stain, before he takes a particularly wet blob and smears it across her cheek. She gasps and smacks at him in mock horror, as Harry burrows into the warm couch cushions, enjoying the familiarity of the exchange.
Sunday had been terribly awkward. There exists a weird tension between the four of them which makes Harry want to tear out his hair. He could probably spare some. Truly, he swears it grows quicker than everyone else’s, probably in some sort of lifelong rebellion against the memory of Petunia, with her sharp jabs and scissors. Whenever he takes a
Despite this, the churning and uneasy feeling in his gut outweighs his head and he continues along behind it. It takes him around countless bends and turns and, with a small cry, he realises that they could possibly be entering the Forest. The trees have assuredly risen high enough to be those he remembers every night in his nightmares, and a fog is beginning to materialise near the ground. He can no longer see where the dark foliage meets the sinking clouds, instead it forms one lid to a glass which traps him in it’s vile grasp.
to be doing. The rest of Wizarding society would have Harry send Malfoy to jail if they got their way. They would stick him and Ginny in a house with a white picket fence, and at least one child on the way. He would also be in Auror training already, and though it felt like the best plan in the summer, before Kingsley passed the law that said they had to get their NEWTs first, he now can’t fathom anything worse.
This is what he keeps in mind as he scribbles something on a piece of paper haphazardly, his wizarding watch telling him that is three in the morning. The increasingly dark bags under his eyes were already rather telling, thank you.
“Ah but Harry, I think you’ve forgotten something,” she says cryptically. A joke is coming, he feels it. Whilst he can’t even really consider himself her friend, let alone someone he knows her tells, this tone of her voice- the one which poses itself exactly as if it is building up to a crescendo- gives away her punchline without her even needing to say it. He doesn’t have to be her bestest pal in the whole universe to recognise this.
Her eyes flash with anguish and he knows that she is remembering the pain of Bellatrix trying to split her mind open with Legilimency in a rabid, hungering fit of madness, peeling it apart like a wolf rips at the flesh of its fallen victim. At Malfoy Manor. Harry feels a little sick when he recalls how Malfoy had stood there- dark mark stark against his pale skin- with cold sweat and frightened eyes. And he had done nothing. Coward.
When he reaches the tower, he realises that he has absolutely no idea what he is going to say whether Malfoy is snogging someone or not. In his best case scenario, Malfoy has already left and spared him the dilemma. In the worst, he will be alone, and Harry has already established he doesn’t know how to handle Malfoy by himself. Either way, he is fucked, and now he is just stuck on the steps wondering why in the world he thought this was a good idea.
Harry’s heart is palpitating and a racing thrill runs through his stomach and lower. There is a smell swirling in his nostrils- something minty and fresh, and it’s not coming from him. He is flickering with tension, a smoldering flame.
When she says nothing, staring at Harry from his left hand side with those insightful brown eyes, he realises both Ron and Hermione are expecting him to answer. He doesn’t know quite what to do with this information.
He yanks his curtains shut in frustration, but trips over himself when he gets his feet stuck in the trailing fabric. As he lands on his arse, he hears Justin snickering next to him. He flips off the Hufflepuff and climbs onto his crisp and icy sheets, missing the undemanding company of his friends. Alone, he succumbs to the terrors of the night and the wind howls like packs of wolves outside. Malfoy's soft snores fill the barren room.
There is a hush of voices as Professor Mcgonagall briskly stands up to make her speech. Harry sincerely hopes there won’t be anymore mentions of death and destruction in this year’s edition. She cuts a stern figure in her swooping Headmaster’s robes but the hint of a smile on her thin lips informs Harry of her true sentiments towards the scene before her.
During his Defence lesson, the class morale had been significantly lower than normal, not excluding Harry. He had slumped over his desk and picked at his nails until they started to feel sore. This didn’t deter him, however. Rather, he just picked harder out of spite; he did this until they started to bleed, raw and stinging from his hate-fuelled attack. Their poor Professor had spent the entire lesson cracking jokes in an attempt to lighten the mood, but they fell upon deaf ears and cricket chirps. Even Hermione appeared to not be listening, her gaze uncharacteristically glassy. The saving grace was Neville, who had shyly cracked a grin and laughed, awkward and false, if only to appease their teacher’s ego. Where the students would be without his jovial attitude, Harry dreads to imagine.
- is in imminent peril, Harry backs towards the door, but is stopped by Justin’s clammy hand. He shakes his head, a plea in his face asking for Harry to stay. Hence, he sits down on his own bed and slips his shoes off.
. Then, just as he was about to make a mindless, empty comment about their Potions homework, Malfoy was nodding his head stiffly in an uncomfortable mixture of greeting and acknowledgement, before he strode away.
“Not particularly, Professor,” says Harry, hoping she won’t ask more. Of course, this time she does.
He lies like that for at least an hour, leaving it until the last conceivable minute before some divine will must manage to fire up a little energy in his muscles. Stroking the crinkled cotton of his duvet, he stands up and collects his Star Wars socks from off of the floorboards. They are a little dirty, but his new robes will do a decent job of covering his ankles up, and really, the only person who would notice such a thing would perhaps be Professor Flitwick with his small stature.
pressure. Pressure so great that Harry hadn’t even been aware he was suffocating under it until it was lifted from him, and he suddenly felt like he would drift off if nobody tied him down. The weight pushed him forward, into rash decisions and reckless behaviour. If he hadn’t gone ahead, he would have gone down.
“Harry! Answer it! The ringing doesn’t last forever!” Justin says sharply, shoving away the image of Malfoy listening in to some deep cavern at the back of his mind. His arms flail wildly in an exasperated manner like he thinks Harry is mentally deficient.
Time ticks as slowly as the earth spins, and the sense of embarrassment grows too much for even Harry to handle, although he is finding the whole thing incredibly amusing, in a strange,
“Uh…” Why is it that every time Malfoy opens his ugly mouth, Harry feels the metaphorical rug being pulled out from underneath him an inch more? Whatever workers run his colossal catastrophe of a brain must go on strike, because Harry has no idea how to answer that. This must be why he so elegantly says, “What?”
“As a matter of fact,” Malfoy starts to say, and Harry can’t believe there is more coming, “I would like to modify my previous statement. Any poison. I am not fussy at this stage.” He finishes the sentence with an offensive glower, as if to impress how frustrated he is with Harry for simply not being dull enough to ignore.
“Right, I’m off to breakfast. Meeting Hannah and Neville, I think,” grins Justin, “wish me luck in being the third-wheel.” he departs, putting on his tie hurriedly and both he and Harry are stunned by it’s sudden alterations. Instead of being striped in the individual house colours, their ties are now transformed into a light orange, with a brown bear in the centre of the Hogwarts crest. It looks out of place, surreal, and something flips in Harry’s stomach at the solidity of his house being abandoned.
It takes a long time for Harry to unthaw. His conversation with Erin fades into the background of his conscience; his mouth moves mechanically, abandoned by his brain, which has wandered off into an abyss of white hair and mottled bruises.
Two things happen next. A faint rosy flush begins to show up on Malfoy’s cheeks; he looks less like a broken China doll now, and more just like he is enjoying a deep sleep. It eases a tension that Harry hadn’t realised was there. He smiles, reassured.
“Hey, Harry! Care to join?” says Seamus cheekily, almost causing Harry’s body to go into some sort of cardiac arrest. Dean slaps him playfully on the chest in horror; Harry wishes he could get one in too, as revenge for the wobbly feeling that overcame him when Seamus opened his gob..
hiii hope you enjoy this! harry and draco get their first proper interaction and we learn a little about an issue harry is struggling with
The words run rampant around the empty room, hitting Harry again and again as they lap him. He can’t help but feel hurt by that. Whilst he was being arrogant beforehand, he didn’t think Malfoy would go as far as to say he would rather
uhhh... hello everyone! i would be seriously surprised if there was anyone still sticking with this story tbh after me abandoning it for like 5 months but im really ready to get back on track.. i already have another chapter written and ive found the motivation in me to write again. i'd love it if u stay around for the journey, because i promise it will be great (well i hope so)!!! im quite pleased with this chapter, so i hope you all enjoy (you might want to reread what has already happened if you've been waiting all this time)
Some of the ingredients spark a memory in his brain- Snape’s nasal voice coming in flashes- but his exhausted self can hardly stretch his brain back to his near-fight with Malfoy this afternoon. Asking himself to recall Hogwarts Potions lessons from years long gone is a step too far into the past. For now, he needs to focus on the present, and the messy scrawl of words that are directly in his grip, yet somehow so out of reach.
Again, she just giggles softly and continues with her craft. He studies her subtly, she has thick eyebrows and a nose ring- something he hasn’t seen since the punks that would cringe from Dudley’s bulbous figure at his old primary school. Weirdly, it looks soft on her, feminine and delicate, and he realises that it has a daisy gem on the hoop. Her small but straight nose is splattered with faint freckles, something he hadn’t noticed from afar. Ginny’s could be seen from Mars if you were looking, he’s sure.
Justin sighs, clearly relieved at Harry’s acceptance, and he feels guilty at his initial reaction. It is the cherry on top of the cake that the rock in his stomach plummets a little harder at Justin’s admittedly attractive smile.
Harry is pissed off by the wave of emotion that flares up at seeing Malfoy again. After an agonisingly long week of the furious desire to understand the meaning behind the ingredients, he thinks the list could now be scorched into his brain for the amount he has reread it. He even had had Hermione take a thorough look, pretending that it was something he had picked up from Justin. A sort of project that he and Harry were working on together. He had felt guilty at using Justin as an excuse but the embarrassment of the truth would have been too much to bear. Predictably, she had had no clue- something which infuriated her greatly- though was preening at Harry voluntarily doing work. Ron had practically had to restrain her from running to the library to start researching. On his part, Harry had had to bite down the comment that maybe he should let her go.
“OK, mate. Get off my woman now, or I may have to press charges.” says Ron, half kidding, half not. The alpha male in him has him cautiously watching Harry, before visibly shaking off the notion and returning to his conversation with Dean.
“What happened?” He sighs and tries to shrug off their perceptiveness, willing the unease it stirs in him to go away. That’s what comes with having people who are so close to you, he supposes. Sometimes he truly considers that they know him better than he does himself. Especially now has this become pertinent, with his relief at departing from Grimmauld intermixed with his terror in the face of Hogwarts, with his desire to be with his friends yet somehow completely apart from them, and with his inner conflict about everything Malfoy-related. Does he want to talk to him? Does he want to fight him? Does he want to forget him? Harry has no idea about any of it, but he’s sure Hermione and Ron do.
Curiosity piqued so high it makes his head feel like it is going to burst open, Harry is glued to the doorframe. Every now and then, Malfoy pauses in writing something down on the piece of paper in front of him to follow the next step in the brewing process. Without fail, each time he raises out of his chair to reach across to the cauldron, his glasses slide down and Harry can hear faint curses, of which he can relate. He never thought he would be able to say that- that him and Malfoy have something in common, even if it is something so inconsequential as greasy glasses.
During their adolescence, Malfoy had always been sort of predictable in that schoolboy bully manner of his. Before each fight, Harry could pretty much preempt how it would play out if he were lucky enough to not be blinded by the rage that Malfoy invoked in him.
Undoing the buckles, he reaches into the deep mess of his satchel, trying to deny how easy this motion has become. His fingers find the familiar scratchy parchment and he pulls them out fluidly in one move.
Harry peers around and tries to remember what everything looked like when he was eight inches shorter, with even more knobbly knees than he has now. Certainly Madame Malkins appeared much more intimidating than the short and greying witch she has become. He thinks of Malfoy, baby faced yet still so angular (how is that possible?), and almost feels nostalgic.
Harry turns to Malfoy to ask him where he thinks Zabini is going in the dead of night, but the twat has already gone.
with him that- whatever this is- it doesn’t matter. Sulkily, he shoves his head underneath his pillow, judging that it might be less bothersome that way.
“That’s not what this is,” defends Harry. Something in the other boy's words struck a nerve in him, even though it’s not entirely applicable to this situation. He isn’t lying when he says it’s more than just his admittedly existent Saviour complex.
Upon arrival, Harry squeezes Hermione’s fingers, seeking comfort. Every head in the pub twists to stare at Harry, gawking and judging like tourists at a zoo, who are trying to gage how to react to a particularly dangerous snake. Frankly, he’s a little surprised. Not to sound self-centred, but he had anticipated a screeching mass of both reporters, fans, and fundamentally anyone with a desire to use his fame for themselves. Instead, there is an awkward scrape of a chair in the silence, and slowly everyone begins to return to their conversation.
In a disconcerting twist of events, Malfoy is the only other person that confuses Harry as much as he does himself. It all used to be so simple.
Assuredly the opposite effect to what he intended, this mitigates some of Harry’s edginess. It is belittling in the most delicious way. What does it say about him, that he feels at more home with this version of Malfoy- conceited and disdainful- than the quiet and complacent one of the last few weeks? He hopes that he has said his last farewell to that boy, the one with the evermore hollowing eyes and unresponsive expressions, though he knows that this is unlikely. The rest of Hogwarts wants Malfoy to fade into oblivion, and perhaps the git even wants the same. With the way he has been acting, it is all too probable. Everyone, but Harry, it seems. There is too much he still needs to know, needs to settle.
“Oh yes, but I’m sure they won’t mind me shooting my shot whilst we’re here,” says Erin, “Anyways, I’m at home right now. Here’s my flatmates. Say hi, guys!” A clash of greetings boom from the speaker, a dozen voices all at once, and the volume makes Harry cringe. They sound friendly, and Harry wonders what it would be like to live normally like that: renting a flat with your mates, having a day job, doing the dishes together in the evening. Mundane things, but a merry life.
A heart bubble floats over from where the couple are still celebrating. It hovers above him and he stares at it for several moments, not expecting to feel so oddly touched by how close he has been permitted to get to this display of love. It is a rosy colour and glows ever so slightly, so that when Harry reaches up his hand to touch it, it leaves a blushing hue on his brown skin. Like an idiot, he gives it a prod and it disappears with a loud
Following his instincts, he wiggles his bony feet into a pair of socks and shoes, chucks on his robes and heads out of the dorm room, sick of its stagnant air. He thinks suddenly that it is a real testament to his dysfunctionality that he flits between such extremes. One day, he cannot leave the bed. The next, he cannot get into it. All he can do is cross his fingers and hope that at some point in the future, the
Malfoy just looks him up and down in assessment, seemingly unimpressed, before rolling his grey eyes and turning over. Harry stands dumbfounded at this rejection until it appears Malfoy has fallen asleep, breathing quiet but repetitive fucking sounds that make Harry want to throw him in the Black Lake. He’d fit in there. The Merfolk are an ugly bunch too.
“Ron, you didn’t really think that the workload would be light this year, did you? It’s the last year of NEWTs!” Hermione says, exasperated.
It is the weekend now, and this is always a tricky time for Harry. In theory, they should bring him freedom, a sense of relaxation and a chance to unwind. In reality, however, it is often the prime time for him to fester in a cloud of depression, for him to think about what he
In his mind’s eye, he envisages a peaceful scene, where he and Ron and Hermione cook dinner together after a draining day at work. Perhaps he will have a partner of his own, who holds his hand as he stirs the pot, and who teases him when the meal ultimately goes tits up. He no longer fears losing himself, and therefore doesn’t fear losing them either. It is a tender image- and he wants it so fucking
His angular nose scrunches with temper. The air grows denser, but it is different to when he was in the dorm room.
Searching along the banks of the Black Lake, he spots a sturdy oak tree and braces himself for the run towards it. His boots get muddy and he trips a little, but the speed of the wind catching his robes is an experience near enough to flying that it makes him grin. Probably looking like Hogwarts resident madman, Harry stretches his arms out in the fashion of an eagle, the same way he sat on Buckbeak all those years ago.
Actually, he is lying. It’s terribly awkward, and he only hopes that soon she will run off to find Dean, as the latest gossip tells, and by that he means Ron. Who told him this with a bucketful of bottled anger, an accusatory finger pointing at the wall for emphasis on the particularly harsh notes, and a chopstick funnelling Pad Thai into his mouth.
The corner of her lips upturn, as if she is trying not to agree, but soon she has returned to frowning at him in displeasure. Oh to have a Hermione-level of restraint, it must be so helpful. He drops the subject but keeps the picture of Malfoy on his pointed knees, whilst scrubbing a toilet, in the back of his mind for further amusement. Sue him.
They turn a corner together, and soon ascend a staircase. He considers that Malfoy could be leading him to his own murder, could open the door to a room with Harry’s coffin already nailed in place. What would Ron think about him following after Malfoy like this? Harry shakes the shame and pursues the more pressing issue.
As he creeps out of the room, on the lookout from any stray School Nurses, he decides to take a moment to rest against the wall. She hugs him from behind.
The door is heavy, the solid oak challenging him to turn back, and his hands are sweaty. Malfoy will be asleep anyway.
After the blur of people, deafening and relentless, at Platform 9 and 3/4, Harry is breathing heavily and alone in the first empty compartment that he had found. He’s not sure where Hermione and Ron are; he thinks he might have lost them in the crowd in his rush to get on the train.
But then, having wrestled with his thoughts through an unsatisfying, tiresome night, when it hits, it is with a pit straight to his stomach. The transition is overwhelming and he longs for sleep again. The stone in his belly refuses to budge, full of enmity at the idea of having to get up so prematurely. Why is it that just as he manages to sleep, the morning begins? It pisses him off to no end. This world is so deeply cruel and,
Rolling his eyes, Malfoy gestures to Harry’s general figure with exasperated hands. He says, bolder than Harry remembers him ever being before, “Potter, you literally broke into the Hospital Wing just to watch me.”
Harry is disgruntled. Surely he can’t be walking away from Harry now? Not after Harry has put so much on the line in revealing what he knows. It was risk, but he had assumed it would pay off.
Hermione peers through the archway that leads to the bar as Ron pays for their drinks. The galleons in Harry’s pockets suddenly feel uncomfortably heavy and he gets them out so that he doesn’t forget to pay Ron back. Whilst the Weasley’s have a tad more money in their Gringotts vaults these days, thanks to the roaring success of Weasley Wizard Wheezes and an overdue salary raise at the Ministry, Harry still has more gold than all of them combined. The guilt of it is an unwelcome burden, but he also knows to be gracious for his privilege.
Ah. Relationship drama, perhaps? Not every tear is a result of deep war trauma, Harry, he reminds himself. Most people have normal struggles, with normal lives and normal levels of misery. As opposed to the crippling anguish that causes his body and mind to collapse on an almost daily basis- that is. It is strangely humbling to put into perspective how ridiculous he is.
He decides now that he is going to make this weekend a good one. He will cling to this flicker of euphoria like it is his lifeline, because
“Well, perhaps if you had been using your eyes, you would have noticed that I was, in fact, not the one lurking at all,” says Malfoy, all hostile and bristled at the small insinuation behind Harry’s words. Harry waits for the jab at his shit eyesight. It never comes; he wishes it would.
When coming back to Hogwarts, Harry had made a promise to himself and to Cindy the spider that he would ignore Malfoy. Unexpectedly, Malfoy then turned that on its head by being so bloody distant. Chiming in with his happy eyes and boisterous beard, Hagrid had then advised him to treat him as a stranger. Harry had liked that. It was a nice sentiment. Helpful, in theory.
He has heard the tales of bloody victims, violent criminals and deafening screams which leave you with a ringing in your ears for weeks afterwards.
“Furthermore,” she pauses emphatically, “our additional year group, eighth year, will forgo the housing system once and for all. Eighth years, you are, from now on, one house. Please do not forget your duty to each other. You shall be sharing a new common room close to the greenhouses and your new dormitory arrangements will be assigned upon arrival. ”
“Sorry,” he says, and then he looks immediately pissed off to have apologised. All of this is gripping to Harry, whose brain still hasn’t decided whether it wants Malfoy to piss off the edge of the Earth, or whether it should attempt to try and figure him out. He concludes that there is probably a happy median, and he will find it even if it is the death of him because he can’t live in this unsure, confusing, indeterminable state of emotion.
Then, Malfoy whips his head around and says bluntly, “If you are sick again, I’m leaving,” and Harry temporarily forgets all about secrets and mystery.
“Oh really?” Harry laughs, “You’re an animal lover now? I’ll have to tell Hagrid. He’ll be overjoyed. Maybe he’ll even let you join in with feeding the Blast- ended Skrewts now and again.”
“Yeah. Do you know what happened?” Neville asks harmlessly, unaware that Harry’s heart beats faster at the question. He doesn’t, not really, but that hasn’t stopped him from speculating frantically. “I know I shouldn’t gossip but sometimes you just have to wonder. I hope he’s okay. It might sound a bit weird of me to say, but I do.”
has blotched the nib of a quill, and a splodge of ink prevents him from being able to decipher the last name. Harry rubs at it and the black begins to fade under the heat of his thumb.
you, Malfoy,” says Harry, narrowing his eyes and sitting down on the end of the bed. He meant it as a sort of display of power, to show his firmness and stability, but the close proximity between them instead makes him shrink back, unsettled. His stomach is both sinking and inflating with some kind of unnamed emotion. “I was just- uh- checking whether you had decided to die in your sleep. I didn’t save your life again for you to just get off that easy.”
Neither of them talk; Harry debates leaving. He is still standing, though fidgety is an understatement. Restlessly, he shifts his weight back and forth onto each leg, like each one contains a bomb which can’t be put down for too long, lest it explode.
He slides the note in between the closed curtains, head and heart pounding as one in a way which has nothing to do with his bloodstream.
“It’s not usually unstable,” mumbles Harry, confused at the direction that this conversation has gone in, and he grasps at an opportunity to gain back the upper-hand, “Only when I’m dealing with enormous tossers who still sleep with teddies at night.” He winces at his awful and ungraceful comeback.
Harry wonders in shock. He has not a single fucking clue what he will say if he is. When he scans his memory, he can’t recall ever having to deal with this before. Like all couples, Ron and Hermione have had a few tiffs, but never anything as significant as an actual break-up. Of course there was him and Ginny, but even Harry, for all his inadequacy at romance, knows it wouldn’t be smart to use how he handled that as any sort of example.
The gaps -the things that are missing- are more noticeable to Harry. They stand out in stark contrast to what he remembers from Diagon Alley during the war. On the wall of an alleyway leading away from the main street, he sees remnants of the Wanted posters that had firstly been up for the Death Eaters, and then for him. Gringotts, now standing tall and proud once more, crumbles before him again in his mind’s eye, as it had done on that fateful day of the Battle. He can almost hear the alarms blaring and the goblins crying out to each other as the Dragon shattered the building into ruin- at least, that is what he had assumed. At the time, it had felt like he would never get past the terror, the running, the fight. He had presumed that the destruction left behind would be the same.
He places it back onto the sheets meticulously, wanting Malfoy to pick up on it's deliberate arrangement when he returns. A sick and shameful part of him is thrilled at the argument that he knows they will have once Malfoy realises his careless mistake. He has always been able to rely on the twat for a brawl when he needs one most. And it is now, more than ever, that Harry desires these constants- even if it ends with him with a black eye, no matter how fucked up that makes him. It will only truly feel like Hogwarts again once he and Malfoy settle back into their rivalry.
When he gets back to the dorm-room, Malfoy is perched on his bed, writing something on a piece of parchment. His long legs are crossed and boots kicked off, the picture of relaxation. And one that Harry doesn’t wish to see. Clearly, he has not been anticipating any visitors- he is slouched, the epitome of casual. As such, Harry feels like he has seen a tortoise without it’s shell. Malfoy’s don’t
“For you, Harry.” And he chucks what Harry now realises is the Muggle phone onto his bed. It is a little irresponsible- Harry has to scramble to catch it- and he can't really comprehend how someone could be so careless with something so precious, and doubtlessly expensive. But then he remembers, a little bitterly, how wealthy Justin is; how quickly his things could be replaced if necessary. Justin may be one of the friendliest people that Harry has spoken to in a while, but they have lived vastly different lives. Is that a bad thing? He isn’t sure- a common motif.
“Oh, Justin. I’m so sorry,” says Hannah comfortingly, “You can come and stay with me or Neville during the holidays if you want somewhere to stay other than the castle.”
. “Forgive me, Potter, for being so bold, but I am curious. Is there any particular reason that you no longer have your eyes set on being an Auror?”
“Harry? Is that you?” says a female voice, high and breathy. After a moment, he realises that it is Erin. He hadn’t even considered that she might ring him, this wasn’t something he had prepared for. He feels caught off guard, but rolls with it. She just has that aura of ease which transcends space, reaches him even over however many miles they have between them.
Until it fucks you up forever, as Hermione had shown him. She had taken him to St Mungo’s Rehabilitation Ward with tears in her eyes after finding him unconscious on the bathroom floor, refusing to wake up even with the use of spells. The people there had shocked him back into reality, thank god. Even in the mess of a state he was in, he could still recognise how frightened the idea of a future like this made him.
“No domestics whilst I’m here, please. Or at least free me from being in the middle first,” Harry intervenes and the three of them share a laugh. It feels like those frost-bitten nights again, where they had had to huddle for warmth, and Ron and Hermione were still sorting their shit out as a couple. Mainly, it is a pleasant memory, one which reminds him of just how much they’ve been through together- so he lets the flashback wash over him gently before it rolls away to the back of his mind.
right out of his brain. Well, if Harry wanted Malfoy not to switch dormitories, he certainly has fucked himself over. Doubtlessly, he will wake up tomorrow morning to the news. In the midst the moment, he didn’t even consider this consequence, taunting the other boy senselessly. In fact, Harry isn’t even sure whether he was thinking at all.
“Whatever you say,” he finally looks at Harry, the cold and hard film over his gaze reminiscent of the trial, and that split second where he had turned to Harry amongst all the formalities. As he had then, now, Harry silently begs for him to break the eye contact- it’s too intense, too full of emotions that Harry cannot read. Thankfully, Malfoy grants his wish and he turns away, “I will be sleeping now, Potter.” And at that, he waves his wand, which Harry notices is different from the one he had owned throughout Hogwarts, and the curtains are spelled shut. For several beats, Harry just stares at the bed-frame, before aggressively pulling the duvet up around him and lying down, irked, on the sheets.
“I should find it surprising that you’re here. Funnily enough, I don’t,” Malfoy’s voice drones from across the room. He certainly doesn’t sound as aggravated as Harry had assumed he would be. Despite the ants crawling over Harry, an itch of shame and humiliation, there is another layer of emotion which flashes over him upon hearing him speak. Relief.
Observing the grounds, he feels disheartened. All around him are people doing what he cannot. There is a gift exchange in the distance, he sees someone’s boyfriend send up a flurry of shimmering pink bubbles in the shape of hearts into the air and a squeal of delight before the pair begin to kiss, embracing each other like it is their last breath. It must be their anniversary. On his other side, there is a group of first years playing tag. They have muddy knees and he can imagine the scolding they will get from their Professors as clear as day. One girl runs particularly hard, her feet hitting the ground like she is fighting it, and manages to tackle her friend, screaming “You’re it!” in peals of laughter. Rolling around in the earth, they get wonderfully dirty before collapsing in wheezes.
Had he been more careful, more thoughtful and measured in his clumsy movements, things might have followed according to plan. He could have slipped out, satiated and satisfied having seen that Malfoy is still around to torment the world for at least another day. On his way back to bed, he would have realised that Malfoy wasn’t staring at
“Malfoy, what happened?” he asks, throwing caution to the wind for this one moment. The wind catches it, whisking it away. There is no getting that back.
This same intuition tells him not to lift his head. However, some of the rot in his head must finally be spreading, because he completely misses the memo and rather, does just that.
Mcgonagall sighs into her tea; the Phoenixes scatter in opposite directions as her breath hits the surface. She huffs with amusement and strokes one with her fingertip, coaxing it out from the underside. As it moves, Harry spots an inscription in a loopy, flamboyant font which had escaped his notice until now.
Harry keeps quiet, mostly from having nothing to contribute, and partly because his head is still spinning. Suddenly, as if he hasn’t spent the last month being as stoic as possible, Malfoy speaks again in the middle of the silence. “I won’t ask you if you are alright, Potter, so don’t expect me to.”
He waits for Hermione to reply, in hope that he can keep any of this temporary interest at bay. Maybe it's just a case of being out of sight, out of mind. Or out of speech, out of mind. Whatever.
Speaking of rich bastards, he notices with discomfort another one on the opposite side of the room. He hasn’t said anything as of yet, hasn’t bothered to open that pretentious mouth of his- as if he would- but Harry knows that he is awake. How, you might ask?
Paralysed in his spot, it takes him a few fatigued seconds of recognition, but when it comes to him, he thinks that maybe it isn’t so surprising after all.
And so Harry forces himself up, grabbing some toast from the hovering plate, and just about makes it through the day.
Unable to contain it any longer, Harry yields to the belly laughter that has been brewing in him ever since they caught sight of Ron, and Hermione joins in, falling into his side.
Accidentally, he stumbles right into the Fat Friar when turning a sharp corner, and he spends the rest of the journey feeling like he just came from a snowstorm. The sensation is extremely unpleasant, and he finds himself shivering at every opportunity when he remembers hitting that large, cold belly.
No answer, not that he expected one. His stomach feels like it is trying to claw its way out of him and he feels like he is going to wretch. He puts his ear to Malfoy’s lips, waiting for a breath that never comes. All of his suffering has just come down to this moment- this crucifying pinnacle of horror. Malfoy’s unresponsive body, crippled and lifeless like a picked flower, in the same clearing where Harry had once been murdered, is a vision straight from his darkest nightmare.
As he walks down the steps from the entrance hall, a huddle of girls are crowded around their friend, whose shaking shoulders give the impression that she is sobbing deeply. He witnesses a brief moment of lunacy from himself in which he wants to ask them why she is crying- some perverse side of him needing others to be sharing his pain. It would make him feel less alone though it is a horrible idea, really. But then he notices one particularly sharp looking girl, dressed in a Ravenclaw tie, glaring daggers at a boy who is sheepishly smiling back from across the courtyard. The strength of her glower still manages to wither Harry’s insides, despite the fact that he isn’t even the poor lad on the receiving end. In the midst of a deep sob, the crying girl looks up to flip the boy off.
“I understand,” Harry smiles, “I had a similar issue in summer- unfortunately minus the boyfriend thing,” and his face flares with heat when he realises how that could be interpreted.
When he reaches for the knob to turn on the shower, it is cool to the touch and eases some of the taut tension in his hands. The water slides down his back euphorically, and Harry wonders how the majority of wizards can go weeks without this. Cleaning charms could never knead out the knots in his back like the kisses from the water droplets do. He revels in the stream pouring down on him, letting the glitter trickle into the drain and his exhausted limbs be alleviated. It is the simple things.
He is nearing a clearing, and realises upon further inspection that it is the same one in which he found Malfoy in the middle of the night, practising his strange spell. It looks vastly different to how it did then, with the silver beams creating an oasis of light for them. Now, the place has lost any ethereal quality that the night gave it, looking like any other muddy British path. It is almost impossible to combine the two images in his mind but, if he focuses, he can almost see Malfoy’s lithe form, wand poised, in the spot he had stood in then. Some things transcend reality.
“Fuck, I can’t find it!” Justin says manically and Harry takes the rod from him, so that he doesn’t need to worry about doing two things at once. Murmuring his gratitude, Justin wipes a bead of sweat from his forehead. For being buried under a lake, and encased in cool stone, the lab is proving to be unfairly hot.
“A bit of gratitude would be nice, maybe,” mutters Harry, ignoring the first part of Malfoy’s question.
“Hey, ‘Mione,” Ron reaches over Harry to poke at her with a wide cheesing grin plastered across his freckled visage, “You’ve got something on your face.”
As he watches the smile lines of Ron’s colossal grin melt his frown away, his annoyance fades. He vows to himself that he would take a thousand soppy glitter bombs if it were to make Ron forget about his own misgivings for even a moment. The bubbles glide above the two of them, ostentatiously pink and twinkling, and he lets his frustration fly away with them.
Somehow, he is now one step closer to solving this puzzle. Victory is so near he can practically smell it. Although, Harry reminds himself as he pulls his body up, he has had a whiff of it before. He isn’t a fan of the taste of the aftermath. Maybe he really should leave it alone this time. This could be personal, intrusive even. Does Harry honestly want to get caught up in Malfoy’s melancholy world?
of all people. His cheeks flush, feeling oddly like he has been called out- though for what, he is clueless. “That’s good, I guess.”
“Potter, I have no clue what you’re talking about,” he says in that posh drawl of his, looking straight past Harry rather than in his eyes. Harry realises he hasn’t heard his voice up until now, and it ignites something inside of him.
He feels a bit lost now, unsure whether to try and go back to sleep or not. Of course, it would be to no avail, but it is that effort that counts, right? He has lessons in the morning. With his Defence class at eight-thirty, it would probably be a smart idea to at least attempt a nap. But as Harry walks back into the room and spies Malfoy’s empty bed, sheets eerily untouched and gleaming in the moonlight, he recognises a lost cause immediately. Frankly, he cannot be bothered with the struggle of it.
Leaving, however, means going back to the dorm- means Justin, means confronting something that he isn’t ready to think about even slightly.
“Why are you looking at me like that? Enjoying the show?” he demands. Whether or not being snappy will cause his investigation into Malfoy to be sabotaged, Harry doesn’t know, but he glares back at him anyway, not in the mood to tolerate any of their habitual bullshit. His head feels like it is being pulverized in a grinder.
Harry thinks as Ron aims a spell at him, and he lets the familiar warmth in his belly spread to the tip of his fingers with satisfaction.
Malfoy coughs slightly, and whirls backwards with abruptness. His heeled boot stamps on Harry’s foot and he resists the urge to yelp.
There had been so much hope in him yesterday, but it was unrealistic and naive. As if one good day with Justin could fix all his problems- he scoffs at himself, what utter bullshit. This and the lack of manifestation from Malfoy’s dragon is proving him delusional.
As they approach their reassigned dormitories and common room, Harry observes the unfamiliar surroundings warily. It is situated in the opposite corridor of the one which leads to the greenhouses, and he has never once thought to walk down here. To be fair to him, he would not be alarmed to find out that this entire area has been fabricated using Wizard Space whilst the renovations are underway.
- but such a life feels overwhelmingly out of his reach. A blurry figment of a dream that isn’t his to have. Right now, as he stands alone in the bitter cold of the corridor, just him and the silvery light of the night sky, it seems infinite universes away. When he lets a teardrop fall, he holds himself bare to the moon and challenges her to judge him as pathetic. He likes to imagine that the way the light brightens for a second is her smiling down at him.
Some are dead, like Crabbe. Some are imprisoned, like Goyle. Many just risked the Minister’s wrath and stayed home. Pavarti says that Lavender outright refused to come, stating “Azkaban, Hogwarts. What difference does it make, they’d both be prisons to me.”
to say to each other, even though it was usually spewing with resentment and scathing insults. He found, however, that nothing was coming out. All he could do was stand there spluttering, like a fish out of water. Malfoy was biting on his lip awkwardly, as if he was having similar troubles, and Harry tried desperately to put together a sentence in his head. The only thing he was able to come up with was
Nevertheless, fatigue hits him, his body and mind not used to this setting, and he immediately knows he needs to leave. It wouldn’t do to have the amiable acquaintance, which he has managed to form with this sweet and pretty girl in the last few minutes, destroyed by his fucking trauma, and his fucking relentless sadness.
“My family are full of witches, did you know? That’s how I know these things.” she says seriously and he does a double take, thinking perhaps that she has caught onto him. There is a tense few seconds before she breaks character and laughs again. Her cheerful mood manages to make the heavy feeling that had been beginning to settle inside him again, dissipate.
Anthony stumbles in a bit later, and his hefty plods are a bit staggered. He could be drunk. Hermione would be appalled, considering that it is a Sunday night, but eighth year apparently does not seem to be bothered by such mundane structures any more. Almost every night, he hears Seamus and Dean go out to Hogsmeade as they stir up great noise in the common room; Merlin knows who else joins them. They tumble back into the room at ungodly hours, usually waking Harry from whatever pitiful excuse for sleep he is in. A lot of clinking of bottles, stifled giggles and a singing Seamus. Probably some snogging in between if it is just the two of them. Harry really is becoming less cool by the day. Premature ageing here we come, he thinks woefully.
, of all people- Harry will not allow these obstacles to surpass the friendship between the three of them, as he is a little scared he might have been beginning to do.
, of all people, really want to make out with someone at the Astronomy Tower though? The place has as much history for him as it does Harry.
For a moment, Harry has no clue what he is talking about. He has been so absorbed in his own humiliation that he altogether forgot that he has been made even more of a fool by the fact that he is sodden in gold glitter. Well, he could not have made a worse off-the-cuff decision if he had tried. As his favourite morning-mirror-pep-talk goes,
Mcgonagall chuckles, condescending in the way that older people inevitably are when someone young dares to feign maturity. Harry isn’t offended. He feels the same when, for example, he sees a third year boy trying to impress a girl with whatever prepubescent muscle he can find. It’s second hand embarrassment, mixed with a tinge of superiority- not that anybody would admit that out loud.
Shit. Harry forgot that Hogwarts is indeed in the midst of the vast and empty Scottish Highlands- at least that is what he thinks, its unplottable nature could presumably have it anywhere and he wouldn’t know- rather than central England. It has always felt so close to him no matter where he is, which is usually in the South, trapped its rich, snobby suburbs.
Still terrified, he watches Malfoy. His chest rises once, taking breathes far too shallow and sparse. Seeking some form of reassurance, he tries not to think too much about what he is doing, and places a hand onto the other boy’s chest. For far too long, he is stationary, as still as the windless air. When he finally exhales, Harry remembers that he is, in fact, a Wizard, and that he can actually do something about the chill which has settled over Malfoy’s body. He himself shivers too, though from the inside out.
“There.” she grins widely, all-teeth and eyes glinting, “Ahhh, perfect. As pretty as a picture, Harry.” he flutters his eyelashes stupidly, feeling simultaneously more light and free than ever, the weight that comes with being a wizard lifted from his chest for the time being.
“Alright, Potter,” Malfoy puts his slender hands in the air, “I believe you. Don’t get your panties in a twist.”
His voice is close to silent; there is a hint of fear and sadness woven in with his words. It is the oddest thing Harry has ever heard him say. If he hadn’t regarded him himself a few moments prior, Harry might have questioned whether it was even Malfoy lying in that bed, or some imposter.
“I wonder how Rosmerta is doing these days,” comments Hermione as the woman in question comes out of the kitchen and passes by their table, levitating four trays above her. “You know, apparently Malfoy wrote her an apology over the summer?”
Sometimes he doesn’t feel real. Ever since he saw a glimpse of the after-life, he has secretly harboured the frightening yet freeing thought that he is actually dead, and that this is all a figment of his imagination somehow. But no person in death could feel the rustle of the cotton so vividly as it brushes against his moving limbs, no person could recognise something as small as the vibration in the floorboard as Malfoy’s lightly steps out of the bathroom.
All week, he has been cradling his pillows and hoping that somehow, the date would never arrive. Alas, it crept up on him before he had even begun to come to terms with the idea of being a full time student once more. It is now, at the ungodly hour of five AM, that Harry is wishing desperately that his bed-sheets would swallow him up. He reckons that he could live quite pleasantly in the furrows of his duvet for the remainder of his life, should some god grant him this kindness.
“Malfoy, please,” stifles Harry, swallowing down a sob. Whispering, he says, “I can’t do this. Please.”
He finds it strange that back in Hogwarts, he is finding it easier to block out the memories of the battle itself. Rather, he is tantalised by nightmares, both in sleep and consciousness, of the run, the fleeing, the year prior where everything was bleak and wreaked with dread. He supposes perhaps it is because Hogwarts feels changed. Maybe Mcgonagall’s reforms were a helpful idea, after all.
. When he says that, he doesn’t mean that he got a low score on a test, or felt melancholy for an evening or two. No, not anything as superficial as that. They are so painful to live through that Harry almost reaches his breaking point.
Mcgonagall takes another patient sip and Harry feels embarrassed at his slowness. A cuckoo clock, which must be a new addition for he has never noticed it before, alerts the hour. In the silence of the room, every chime feels like a hammer in the icy fabric that has settled over him. He really wants to throw an object, preferably heavy, at the damn wooden bird, just to get it to stop laughing at him.
He stands back, giving Ron and Hermione a moment together, and also himself some distance from the sheer number of books. They make him feel guilty as he thinks of his distinct lack of homework with shame, and he tries to recount his own. After a quick scour of his memory, Harry concludes that it is extremely likely that he has only completed one set piece as of yet.
Harry peers at Hermione sitting opposite him, knowing from the scrutiny on her face that she is already making calculations in her mind as to what Mcgonagall might be about to say.
At that, Malfoy snorts involuntarily and then tries to redeem himself by playing it off like more of a scoff. It doesn’t work. He ducks his head and Harry sort of feels bad for embarrassing him.
Malfoy rolls his eyes and Harry gets the idea that he knew he was doing anything but sleeping. Then, faster than lightning, he throws a tiny piece of paper at Harry and stalks back to his own bed. It pokes him in the eye with the sharp corner and Harry scowls at his retreating back, judging it being purposeful.
Harry plays along, “That checks out then. Filch is...um... extremely hot.” His mouth feels dirty after saying it, and he scours the ground in case some water magically comes to him.
“Potter-” calls Malfoy, but it is too late. He hurls off of the Astronomy Tower, before collapsing onto the hard metal.
“I’m not!” But as he says it, the light in the bathroom flickers madly, before turning off. The slight smell of burning that wafts through the door really doesn’t help prove his point.
When he picks it up with a grin, he finds that he isn’t frightened by what could be written on it like he initially thought. It’s only Malfoy.
Harry wants to shout at the top of his lungs that he would rather Malfoy bully him all year long than be ignored. He would bet his life that that would have him running for the hills, however. “Yeah, I promise,” he says solemnly, but the falsity is dripping from each word.
. However, his will is ignored and it moves again, although slower than before. Obviously, it had previously misjudged how quick and attentive Harry is, and he tries not to be disgruntled by the fact that a puny ball of light is faster than him.
casual, he is sure of it. Despite the fact that he, of course, got the impression, when he last visited their most cosy and
“What? No!” exclaims Harry, “Does it matter? Can’t you just answer the question?” He feels frustration climb his spine; Malfoy is finally asking for answers he himself has been seeking.
With Sirius in mind and once he collects himself, he glances sorrowfully around at the room that had once belonged to his godfather. He had kept up the posters of the comically large-breasted women, despite their ludicrosity, as a nod to Sirius’ hatred of the house, and to all the rebellious attitudes he adopted whilst trapped within its walls. Somehow, it eases his occasional guilt when he remembers that he has taken up residence in a place that Sirius would have seen razed to the ground given the opportunity. He’s the sole leader of the revolt now; he would be betraying the cause in taking them down.
However, he had been pleased to note that Malfoy’s shoulders had been as stiff as stone on Sunday evening, back snapped straight, and clearly listening as Harry and Justin recounted the names of the returning students. He had clearly been trying to appear disinterested, but the distance he has been trying to set between himself and the rest of the school had shattered at the mention of Zabini.
It was about a week ago now that Harry had sat, chat, and threw up with Malfoy at the Astronomy Tower. Merlin, the memory of it makes him cringe,
doing?” He doesn’t know how it happens- it is a complete accident- but the air turns sour within seconds. He supposes it is their human instinct, to concede to their animosity, and yet he can’t help but feel like he has massively fucking let himself down.
, before screaming for Madam Pomfrey to drag him out of the infirmary by his ankles. Either that, or the second, worse option, which is that Malfoy will simply stare at him and ask him why in Merlin’s name he is there. To which, Harry will have no reply.
“Quite rubbish. Pomfrey has some vile tasting potions,” replies Malfoy, half-serious but clearly avoiding the seriousness at hand. He twists his skeletal fingers even harder now; Harry stares, in awe at this uncomfortable, openly flustered version of his longtime rival. Just as Harry thought would happen, Malfoy appears to notice his gaze and flushes deeply before stopping immediately.
“You what?” asks Malfoy, and the way he says it is empty, lacking. There should be at least a smidge of confusion in his voice- any other person would be perplexed by Harry’s erratic behaviour, but if there is any genuine feeling there, it is buried far too deep to be seen. The scornful wrinkles between his brows, however, are harsh, and certainly have no qualms about hiding. They make him look eerily like his father.
The tension in Malfoy’s body seems to triple tenfold. If Harry didn’t know the value of those parchments already from the reckless midnight Potions trips and the unorthodox spells being practised in the witching hours, the way that Malfoy stiffens now is a dead giveaway. He stalks towards Harry with a furrow in his pale brow. Harry gulps, considering that running might be his best chance of survival. However, with the fatigue in his legs from his solo escapade around Hogwarts, he probably would only make it as far as the end of this corridor before Malfoy
“No, no. Thank god,” he says with a profound sigh, “I might have, had my mum not found me an alternative. This. It’s called Asmandrius, and it acts similarly but the effects aren’t as drastic. It basically just dulls your senses once you are asleep, rather than actually sending you to sleep itself. It also meant that Elliot could wake me up if need be unlike Dreamless, which completely knocks you out. Might’ve freaked him out, y’know- to find his boyfriend practically like a corpse in the night.”
In the end, it is Harry who speaks, despite planning to leave after their short exchange shrivels into a pitiful non-existence. It doesn’t seem to be in his power to make the decision to slink away, however, so he prays to whoever is in charge that they be merciful and release him from their mocking grasp soon.
To Harry’s confusion, Malfoy hasn’t scampered off to God-knows-where this morning. Instead he has joined Harry, Justin and Anthony, the latter having made a great effort to integrate himself since Monday, in an early morning game of Exploding Snap. Well, he hasn’t so much
They chat aimlessly about nothing important, and it is brilliantly mundane. Hermione explains to them the benefits of studying an Arithmancy Masters, and Harry doesn’t even have to pretend to be interested, not when her face lights up so gleefully. It would be absurd to not want to listen.
“Do you hear that, Harry?” says Justin but Harry isn’t listening, not anymore. Some part of his brain, the bit which cares about his social life- his friends, his reputation- shuts off.
find himself getting punched. Then, he moves a fraction too much and it exposes his left forearm. The burn scars loom more ominous than the last time Harry saw them- the moon makes Malfoy even paler and they starkly contrast.
“But isn’t that a good thing?” he can practically hear Justin say. He doesn’t know what to tell imaginary Justin.
One of his biggest fears is losing Ron and Hermione. If they were to be taken away from him, a colossal part of him would go too. It is essential that he doesn’t fuck up this one
“That is so gross,” says Malfoy, coming to lean next to him. He is very close and Harry feels the proximity in every part of his body, even in spite of his exhaustion. Usually, everything about the boy yells coldness, a winter chill. But now, Harry finds he is just as warm as any other person- as Hermione, as Ginny- and the familiarity of a human body is comforting as the wind nips at his forehead.
Ron just shakes his head, looking embarrassed. Whether this is on Harry’s behalf, or because he doesn’t want to be spotted next to a human disco ball, Harry isn’t sure. “Didn’t work, mate. Must be some type of extra special, sticky love glitter.”
He turns his attention to the easy companionship of his friends around him instead, sick to death of thinking about Draco fucking Malfoy and his fucking family.
A middle aged witch comes in with a Kneazle perched on his shoulders. Briefly, she scans Harry and he cannot help but tense. Then, with a twinkle in her eye, she offers a small smile and sits in the booth behind Hermione and Harry. He needs to learn to trust strangers again, though it is easier said than done.
“At three AM?” Malfoy says and raises his thin eyebrow fractionally as if he considers Harry an utter imbecile. Even so, it is way too polite. Where is the
, Harry panics. He didn’t foresee this outcome in the dozens his mind hastily moved to create in the silence after he asked that stupid question- didn’t imagine that it could turn around on him somehow. Trust Malfoy to completely disregard his question and manage to yet again surprise Harry. Now, Harry stands here like a fish out of water, struggling to find an answer. He looks everywhere frantically, as if there might be a sign that says
“Of course. Sorry, dear,” and he mimes locking his lips with a theatrical flare, finishing the performance by pretending to throw the key away. The affection on Dean’s face as his smiles down at him is too much for Harry to bear; it reminds him of the doting couple that used to live down Privet Drive, the poor sods. It couldn’t have been much fun- what with the judgemental and intrusive collection of neighbours on the street. This is all very odd, he thinks.
A piece of Ron’s hair falls out when he scratches his head, and the petrified expression on his face is enough to send Hermione and Harry into fits. By the time he has finished laughing, he has a stitch in his side and feels like it is very possible that he could also have abs.
Maybe if he approaches it with the truth, Malfoy might not serve him up boiled for Fang’s dinner. “It’s not, but I want to know,” says Harry, on edge. He wraps his arms around his knees, noticing a significant gravy stain on his robes.
“Just having a browse, thank you,” Hermione answers politely when Harry doesn’t. Jenna nods her head in understanding and returns to counting the Sickles at the till.
That evening, Harry stalls his inevitable entrance to the dormitories for as long as possible. He clings to the sofa’s armrest, a ludicrous fear haunting him that he will be dragged through by some miserable soul. His fingers clench around the aged fabric; he grips it as if he were a newborn lamb on the verge of being ripped from its mother. He feels weak and childish. Age eighteen and he is frightened of a bedroom.
Sneaking into the Hospital Wing the same way he did before, he prepares himself for backlash. He took it earlier, he can take it again. There are too many rogue thoughts buzzing around in his head for him to not vocalise a few of them. Besides, this worked for them last time, in that after the notes came a week-long era of peace.
He stares at Harry abruptly and without hesitation. Strangely, he also flicks his gaze up and down Harry’s body, just once. Wherever his eyes travel, Harry senses a flutter of his jittery pulse follow. He doesn’t know what it means, but he feels mildly disturbed.
Either way, Malfoy’s attempts to hide himself from the rest of them are futile. Harry doesn’t need to see him physically as a mess to know that he isn’t quite right. He is erratic, yet subdued. Changed. Harry hates it. Something is up. Whether it is just the widespread trauma, ever so popular at the moment thanks to an especially evil Dark Lord, or something deeper, is a mystery to Harry.
At dinner that evening, Harry feels a vast stretch of distance between himself and the people around him. Their words and conversation all merge into one hum, which rings in his ears and grates at his skin, almost itchy in the sense that Harry has the inexplicable and demanding urge to scratch at his whole body. The only definitive syllables he can discern are those of Uncle Vernon. They pound at his head the entire meal; after a while, he acknowledges, without feeling, that he has dropped his spoon in his soup. He feels, but doesn’t see, Hermione’s watchful eyes. A prickling sensation alerts him that she is looking at him, and that he should probably act normal, and fucking eat his fucking dinner like a happy and functioning person- but he can’t bring himself to care.
Perhaps concluding that it is safe, he folds up the piece of paper on which he has been scrawling all evening, and places it in a side pocket on his satchel. Harry observes all this with hawk-eyes, despite his lids being heavy and threatening to drop closed.
Back in the castle, Ron races to his dormitory in shame. There are some spikey prickles on his head that indicate it is growing back already, so it won’t be long until whatever trick the man at the bar pulled is reversed. Hermione’s leading theory is that Bar-Man slipped something into his drink whilst he wasn’t paying attention. It is absolutely hilarious, of course- though not to Ron. Ginny almost fainted from laughter when she saw him.
“It was just from a nosebleed,” Jenna says from behind him, startling his lungs back into normalcy. Sympathetically, she takes the offending object from the stack and, with a flick of her wrist, vanishes it wandlessly. “Maybe we should have put this one away earlier. My apologies, Mr Potter.”
Harry is shocked. With the amount of people that were there, he is astounded that not a single person knows who they were. With a hint of sadness, he thinks that maybe they just don’t care, or even worse, believe that Malfoy deserves it. He isn’t sure how he feels about the boy anymore, his sentiments seemingly having evolved from their boyish hatred of the past, but nowhere near reaching civility. What he does know is that he no longer wants to see Malfoy beaten down. However, to be fair, he hasn’t a clue who the boys were either, but he would be happy to provide a Pensieve memory if asked.
When they eventually lock eyes, Harry thinks that maybe Malfoy wasn’t expecting him to ever look up. He feels a smidgen of conceit that he, for once, was able to perplex the other boy. Malfoy is fidgeting, seemingly uncomfortable all of a sudden. His fingers fiddle agitatedly with each other. Harry is sure that he is doing it subconsciously and would be mildly horrified to be seen doing something so
The looseness of the gown means that it has slipped even further; Harry swallows. Odd- his throat feels dry.
, Harry isn’t being dramatic. Would it be the worst thing in the world for a boy to get some good quality sleep once in a while?
It all changed in sixth year. Harry no longer had any grip on Malfoy. Even when he did, his firmness of mind was skewed astray by the opinions of others, like Ron and Hermione, yes, but also Remus and Mcgonagall. It is like that now, except his own mind and Malfoy’s bizarre fluctuating behaviour are now suddenly the saboteurs to him understanding the other boy. Still, his instincts do tell him that Malfoy isn’t set out to end the world singlehandedly in a fit of revenge for Voldemort and the ruined reputation of his family. Unfortunately for Malfoy, his instincts also tell him that it is essential he reads that parchment, and so that is what he shall do.
“Hey, Harry,” cheeps Neville joyfully as Justin nods to him with smiling crinkled eyes, a sandwich in his mouth. Hannah greets him with a warm expression and gestures for him to sit down next to her. He does so uncomfortably, but Hannah doesn’t seem to mind and just shuffles up to make more room for him. She has the kind of quiet and trustworthy smile that dispels all of your tension, fading all the aches and pressures- until you are just left with a tender happiness fluttering around your body. Her button nose wiggles and she clasps his knee quickly, addressing his arrival; he thinks contentedly that she is perfect in every way for Neville.
“Yeah, I don’t know. She seems to really like coming. And I like her coming” If Harry wasn’t becoming steadily more insane by the day, he could have sworn Ginny was blushing. A flushed pink is spreading across her face, reaching her ears. Interesting.
“Uh, Hello,” he says. It is so quiet he is afraid he may have to repeat himself, but Malfoy breathes deeply and Harry knows he heard him.
He slumps against the railing, succumbing to the cold in the space where the warmth of a body had once been.
The castle flashes before him as he runs. Stone walls and the bodies of students merge into one grey blur, unrecognisable. Someone calls at him as he dashes past but he doesn’t register it. It feels like hours before he stops, but when he physically does, his mind keeps going. It races forward, pulling at his head. He is in pieces; his legs and hands are shaking, and his mind is in a thousand different places at once. Uncle Vernon and every hateful comment he ever made is in all of them, however. He throws up.
“It’s lovely, isn’t it?” says Justin, noticing Harry’s eyeline, and detaching the ring from his hair “Elliot got it for me for my birthday earlier this year. Called it a promise ring, said that we would replace it with ‘the real thing’ in a couple of years.”
“He didn’t. He ran away and when I finally found him, he refused to talk to me,” admits Justin with affection in his eyes that Harry doesn't understand, “After a while, he came to his senses and just had one request: that I make him fly.”
It’s the question he has been dreading. The flutter in his stomach stops, but only to be replaced by it welling up, growing unbearably until it is close to bursting inside of him. Mentally, he has been begging her not to voice whatever queries she obviously has, and all this time his prayers have been answered. Then, he hears Hermione’s reprimanding tone in his mind,
Ron seems to decide that this reasoning is solid enough and downs half of his drink in one gulp. He shivers and scrunches his face at the taste. “Anything to forget the pain of losing Quidditch. Going bald is worth it.”
For his own sake, he should also drop this whole parchment thing. It is probably just a shopping list or notes for his new novel
When Malfoy opens his eyes, there is a softness to him that Harry has never once seen before. He suddenly finds it difficult to picture Malfoy being up to any evil deeds. To put it simply, he isn’t sure there is enough fight left in the other boy.
“Projects, yes. Because I know that you’re a good little pet Gryffindor who likes to save the day and take mercy on us bad guys. And I don’t want to owe you for anything more than I already do. It’s a burden I don’t care to carry.”
He never thought he would say it, but he misses Grimmauld Place for this reason. In all it’s grimness, Ron and Hermione were the sole flowers in the winter. Now it is spring; they still shine just as brightly in the field, but are admittedly easier to lose track of.
Veiled in soft green leather, the book is, at first glance, an unimpressive thing. He hopes that the contents prove the appearance wrong. The persistent need to know what Draco Mafoy is up to never seems to disappear, though Harry had hoped it would. Maybe some information in here will provide him with some peace of mind. Anything to stop him feeling so wrongfully interested.
Bizarrely, Harry realises that he doesn’t want to go home, back to the dingy and musty smelling rooms. He cringes at the thought. The house will probably lock him out in it’s everlasting grudge, and Kreacher will offer him a poorly made cup of tea as he perches on the pavement. There is a reason why he prepares his own beverages, and it’s not that he is protesting against the cruel treatment of house elves. Kreacher would smack him with the remains of Aunt Walburga and then bury him alive if he dare even suggest freeing him from his loyal duty.
so..... thoughts???? things WILL eventually come clear i promise but like as if draco will tell everything straight away we just know that boy loves his drama. i honestly wrote the last bit on a high at 3am so is it good? probably not? it’s purely just...maybe our boys are finally deciding to stop being stupid tho <3 also who else loves that draco is literally like you’re stupid and harry is just sitting there, heart eyes about his hair and smooth skin. me too bby me too. also i’m dying over the fact that we’re gonna reach 100k soon and they’re literally only just beginning to get onto speaking terms. talk about slow burn oops sorry baes
This irritates him to no extent; he wants to tear his hair out in irritation. If he has to think for one second more, he will...actually, he isn’t sure what he will do. Cry, perhaps? Now more than ever, he just wants to shut off for a while. His brain is pinching with how many thoughts and anxieties are running through his mind like it is a fucking marathon. As they go, they trample his chance of sleep into the ground with painful kicks to his head. Probably looking like a right idiot, he flicks his temple in the hope that it might trigger some sort of
How Malfoy manages to make Harry feel twelve again is unbeknownst to him. His steps are arrogant and large and Harry tries not to show how tired he is becoming by this chase. As casually as possible, he scurries alongside the other boy; a minor slash of irritation cuts through him when he realises how much shorter he is. Great. Mentally
A group of young teenagers walk past and upon regarding something, presumably him, they start to giggle. Only a select few are polite enough to stifle their laughter and even then, it is only once they see who he is. He sighs, resigned and fed up with the day.
FIRST OF ALL: PLEASE read the beginning of the end notes if u have any triggers and for content warning <3 stay safe
Lest allowing the thaw over his mind to creep to any other areas of his body, he cracks a grin and jokes, “Well, thanks, but you know I’m not technically a teenager anymore, Professor.” As quickly as snapping a biscuit, the tension breaks. As it happens, the saying ‘fake it til you make it’ works after all.
The cogs in his mind still only just processing the fact that he is being asked to get out of bed, Harry snaps, rather unfairly, “Yes alright, Ron! I get it. Can you just give me a second?”
Huffing and deflated from the rebuttal of his innovative suggestion, Ron slouches back and shrugs his shoulders. “I guess you’ll just have to be glittery until you use the showers then.” And this triggers something in Harry’s memory.
Finding that it doesn’t work, and rather just gives him a minor headache, he decides to get up. He realistically isn’t going to be sleeping tonight, as much as he craves the respite. Thank you, Justin, for that. Harry cringes and feels like sobbing when he remembers just how close he had been to nodding off. It seems Malfoy manages to plague him even in unconsciousness.
Harry is not quite sure how to react to the information. In many ways, he is prepared to leave behind the confinements and restrictive boundaries of a house. He has long felt that the segregation of students into only interacting with like-minded people enforces a culture which promotes cliquey attitudes. It is unsurprising that students don’t understand each other- they are forced apart. However, Gryffindor has also long been a key part of his identity. Ever since he was just a scrawny eleven year old wearing a Sorting Hat which threatened to fall down his face it was so large, his house has represented an immense portion of who he is. Without that, he feels even more lost in this castle of broken pieces, readily growing more foreign to him. He is, not to mention, disturbed at becoming one with the Slytherins- with Malfoy. Ugh. He makes a noise of distaste.
At the call of his name, Malfoy’s figure pauses. On the crown of his head, that divergent lock of hair still pokes out rebelliously and Harry is bothered by it. Without turning around, he calls back, sounding like he couldn’t be less interested in what Harry has to say.
Of course, it is indeed possible that the resulting potion from all these ingredients is harmless. Something for sleep, perhaps, or educational purposes. Merlin knows that half of Hogwarts are more than likely brewing Cheering Potions to get through the days. If Harry had the capability to successfully make one without poisoning himself in the process, he would absolutely be down in the doom and gloom of the dungeons with them. He even entertains the idea that it is just a madman’s ramblings, driven by the hour of the night and the pungent fumes coming from the cauldrons. As always, the odds are against Harry. It is all very probable that this is a mundane list, nothing out of the ordinary.
Goldstein flits in and out the dorm, cordial enough but not appearing to care for chatter. Sometimes Harry forgets that he even shares the room with him, as awful as that may seem, but the boy-
No. It is more akin to one of Uncle Vernon’s choice- sung by old English singers which he would have dug out with an exclamation that it was his father’s favourite. Aunt Petunia would’ve dutifully nodded along to the droning voice, dragging throughout the entire house. Then it would get stuck, and Vernon would spend the whole afternoon blasting the darned thing as it replayed the same tune. He would shout, splutter and shove at Harry until Harry couldn’t remember anything but the stupid sounds of the moment. All night the song would round in his head until it was almost painful. In retrospect, it was probably so because he had had nothing else to busy his mind in his plain and uneventful life.
Whilst Ron and Hermione can be overly inquiring, and too bloody observant for their own goods, he knows it ultimately is just because they love him as much as he does them. And he will be damned if he lets his damaged state of mind come between that. His utter lack of energy, the fact that he can only apparently find interest in the life and actions of
He sits unassumingly, knees drawn up against himself and eyes closed. If it weren’t for his irregular breathing, Harry would think him asleep. Thanks to the wind, his hair is in complete disarray, whipping madly at his high cheekbones. Harry almost feels guilty for disturbing him.
“There’s nobody like that. I thought we covered this, Erin. I was in London just for the summer, and I am genuinely just asking how you are!” he says, leaving out details about Grimmauld Place. It is probably best that she misunderstands him and the situation, in thinking that he was only there on holiday.
This is not unlike Hogwarts. He has come to recognise the castle as its own entity, regardless of the students inside. The sense of independence is something you have to respect and not fear.
Wandering on, he stops at a quieter spot underneath a shady tree and drops to rest against the trunk. Although he knows that he won’t be here long, Harry feels that if he returned home now, in this rare state of productivity, he would be letting himself down. There’s a girl about his age, with shoulder length brown hair which falls in waves, resting on her elbows a few feet away from him. She has a thick book out, and her mustard sandals are kicked off, discarded in the grass.
, Harry isn’t sure whether it is linked to anything, or if he is forming non-existent connections out of the madness of his mind. Merlin, maybe neither the spell, the potion, nor his silent demeanor have anything to do with each other. He feels as if he has dug himself into an abyss of which there is no way out, regardless of whether there is anything to discover in there or not.
Harry admits to not really knowing Anthony Goldstein and he and Justin converse easily and agreeably, snug in their billowing dens of linen. He had not expected it, remembering the snobby, upper-class boy of their youth. Now, it’s pleasant. It lights a glimmer of hope for the year he had thought would be filled with secluded nights, surrounded by people he doesn’t know, and doesn’t care to. Maybe he has found a companion here. He and Justin have spoken before, but only briefly, save that whole Parseltongue fiasco from second year. Harry notes absently that Justin is quite attractive when he smiles, all auburn curls and pearly teeth.
“Sorry, Ma’am.” Hermione mumbles respectfully, as Ron snickers in her ear. She swats at his ear and he lets out a dramatic moan.
There is little warning before Harry encounters the next shock of the day. All he sees is the light come to a standstill as they approach a clearing, which he quickly realises is not as foreign as he originally thought, and
“Well, that‘s what Fred and George once told me, so spread it at your own risk, I guess,” says Neville with a sad smile.
“Yes, Potter. Congratulations, it appears that you’ve finally managed to acquire the skill of listening. It really is rather useful,” says Malfoy, tone parched, and he rolls his eyes once again.
He makes a quick escape, rushing for the door. If Justin says anything else, Harry doesn’t stick around to hear.
Suddenly, Harry sees a flash of white in his peripheral vision. Malfoy is a few rows down, his body only just visible at the edge of the table. He is once again sat up straight, scribbling neatly on a piece of paper; his tidy pile is a massive contrast to Hermione’s own desk. His glasses are nowhere in sight. Oddly enough, Harry notices that he is tapping his legs obsessively. Is he anxious? Maybe he is just bored. It doesn’t matter- seeing Malfoy display any kind of outward emotion seems to ignite a mix of curiosity and relief in Harry.
Harry smiles at nothing in particular. As it grows brighter with the arrival of the night, the moonshine alights Malfoy’s hair, making it glow. It is reminiscent of the silver light from the spell that Malfoy has been practising. Though it has been a few weeks since he saw it last, the memory is still fresh in his mind. After having read that small introduction to
This has quite literally never happened before. Well not quite, he has certainly had fan-girls, and even a few fanboys, compliment his appearance. However, he has always regarded them as insubstantial. They wouldn’t think him so had he not been the ‘Saviour of the Wizarding World’, times two. Never has a person, with a lack of incentive or alternative intentions towards him, called him handsome. Not even Ginny counts, she had only done so when she had wanted something from him. He’s truly shell-shocked. And panicking.
And then, he notices that Malfoy’s eyes are wide, staring directly at Harry. Panicking, Harry grasps at his Cloak, needing to reassure himself that it is still in place.
Malfoy chuckles, and it is the kindest thing Harry has ever heard from his mouth. If somebody had told him all it would take is some measly vomit to chip away at Malfoy’s cold heart, Harry would have done it years ago. Maybe he could have been invited along to one of their house parties, where sickness was fruitful. “Nobody else is crazy enough to be out right now.”
“Yeah, maybe,” Harry says unconvinced and awkward. He doesn’t really fancy third wheeling for two weeks straight.
The walk back is silent, neither of them say a single word. There is no need, and frankly, Harry appreciates the space. It isn’t exactly friendly, but it is accepting. Between them is at least a metre, and Harry finds himself forgetting that Malfoy is there at times, with how quietly the boy treads. His walk is elegant and pacy, like the ground is coming up to meet his every step. Running alongside him, Harry has less gentility than a troll. He lumbers as fast as possible, determined to get the better of his fatigue tonight and to match the speed. Before now, he had never noticed how long Malfoy’s legs are, but then he supposes that he didn’t have any opportunities to walk besides him. Now it is all he can bloody think about; he laments his own stubby ones as Malfoy strides forward. Until they reach the common room, they stay like this. Blaise Zabini ruins it.
, and still manages to feel a flickering flame of anger. Dumbledore. Snape. They were supposed to protect him- he was supposed to be able to rely on them- but what good had they really done him in the end.
Visions of the last few weeks: a sallow expression, words, clipped and unimpassioned. The way that Malfoy never seems to let himself feel- never laughs, never loves, rarely even hates. Only when Harry forced him to. How he refused to follow up any leads that involved his attackers, didn’t seem to care. The brewing of a Potion suspiciously similar to the Draught of Living Death. Maybe Harry had been wrong all along; there was no mystery, only another war-trodden boy with a blue heart and his own closetful of ghosts.
satisfied and he opens his mouth to retort, but Malfoy cuts him off resolutely. “Go and bother someone else. I’m busy, Potter.”
Whipping out the Invisibility Cloak just before he reaches the door, he steels himself for what lies beyond it. He pushes it open, not ready but acknowledging that he likely never will be.
One time, he takes his satchel with him on an exceptionally blowy day. He bears it well for around twenty minutes, but when the wind causes his eyes to sting with tears, Harry seeks refuge.
He is so deeply stuck in a mine of confusion that he is no longer even sure whether he would rather Malfoy stay or go. Undeniably, Harry does seem to have a need to crack Malfoy’s aloof demeanor, for it reminds him of himself in a way- that numbness. It unsettles him out to see the same sentiment reflected in bloody Malfoy, of all people. He needs it gone- a spark of
Steel eyes are staring down at him, tearing him apart, and he seizes up again. A mixture of panic and something else indiscernible swirls in the thick iron of them. This close, Harry notices that Malfoy has a faint birthmark on his left eyebrow. Weird.
anyway pls pls pls leave comments and kudos and share because i’m not kidding when i say it motivates me so much more when i know people are enjoying it 🥺 thanks bbies
Whoever is on the other end of the line seems to respond with the same volume, if the tinny noise coming from the phone is any indication. Justin stands up and throws his hands in the air exasperatedly.
Another inch, or two. They are touching now, and Justin cradles Harry’s face, staring him straight in the eyes. Dryness causes Harry to lick his lips, feeling self-conscious and not wanting to be chapped. The action draws Justin’s attention away from his eyes and his gaze slips down. Harry shudders and leans in closer. His own lips are not as full as Justin’s, he realises.
He thinks back to last week, when Malfoy had mocked him for spewing over half the platform. When the git recovers, Harry has plenty of vengeful jabs in store. Idiots who administer litres of poisonous substance and almost die as a consequence deserve it. Idiots who practically give their rivals-turned-acquaintances heart attacks by doing said deed in their most feared location.
From the moment Hermione reminded him of the scheduled appointment this morning, for he would have forgotten otherwise, Harry has had a rather substantial ache brewing right behind his brows. It pickaxes at his head, digging into his skull with sharp jabs that make him visibly wince.
“It can’t be that bad,” offers Hermione, but as she says it, a pained snort escapes her. She and Harry glance at each other and he sees tears of laughter forming in her eyes.
He imagines the clicking of cameras as the team dismantles their brooms, the roaring of the crowds, like Fiendfyre. All around him are hundreds of hands and arms, grabbing for a piece of him, just so they can say that they have touched Harry Potter. He would practically be offering himself up on a platter, a fat suckling pig ready for the taking.
Later, after they have been for a stroll around the grounds, Justin departs from him to head for dinner. He had implored Harry to come with him, but Harry cannot stomach the idea of food presently. If someone were to ask why, he couldn’t give an answer that made the least bit of sense. He would expect to have an appetite after a day which, in the end, turned out to be rather active. However, he finds that as soon as his mind begins to close off for the day, as he knew it inevitably would, he can only think of one thing.
“Yeah,” Justin grins, “And then I made him fall on his arse. Unfortunately, I made a bit of a misjudgement. Do you want to see where he landed on me? I have a fucking bruise!” and he lifts his robe to show the three of them.
Then Harry’s suspicions about how deathly his stares are are confirmed when Malfoy looks at him, an unbothered, unfeeling mask on his face which Harry just wants to tear away in frustration, and his insides freeze. Malfoy’s right eye twitches a little, and he blinks slowly, before turning away. He gathers his books from his desk and leaves the room swiftly, not caring to say farewell to any of them.
Blushing at the thought, he moves beside Ron as they walk down the road, conscious of Ginny’s fiery gaze behind him. She had been the one to call time, after one particularly bad week in which Harry had refused to see her. It had been two months since the battle at that point. There was a wedge between them, which had been cruelly forged during his absence in seventh year, perhaps even before. No matter how forcefully either of them shoved at it, it prevailed- strong, solid and fixed.
Justin sighs a little and leaves too, closing the door gently behind him and whispering as he does, “See you, Harry.”
“They are on the whole. More than wizards, but his family are strict Christians. And mine are just full of arseholes,” and then, they all share a sympathetic laugh. Except Harry, who just sits there like an idiot, not quite understanding the full picture but feeling like he should be. Justin has been evicted from his house, but why? And what has he done to earn the disdain of his friend’s family? Sometimes Harry feels so stupid it almost makes him crawl under his bed in shame.
, and the delight in his chest makes him soar. Loughfowl, as in the very same name Malfoy scribbled on the second sheet of paper. Harry had cast it to the side, thinking nothing of it and sparing it no second glance. But here it is- the puzzle piece that Harry didn’t mean to find.
“Probably not,” replies Neville. There is a silhouette of ivy against his skin where the sun has kissed it. Twinkling under the luminescence, his brown eyes seem to gleam gold. It hits Harry that Neville deserved the blessing of the Sword of Gryffindor more than he himself ever did. He recognises it now in the richness of Neville’s stare and so he smiles, reeling with pride on the other boy’s behalf.
The jolting vibrations from the floorboards through his bed frame which were small now grow stronger, and Harry realises that Malfoy has put on those boots of his. He smiles minutely to himself at the memory of his lopsided figure hobbling down the entrance way, one foot displaying that loud lavender sock in all it’s grand purpleness.
He catches Harry’s eyes then, and a few lone tears begin to fall. Feeling like he has massively intruded and recognising that nobody-
They take a detour on their way back from the grounds to visit Hermione, who is so busy in the library that she doesn’t even take any notice of Harry’s current state. Her hair is pulled back into a low bun, but strands are flinging free by the second. He believes the whole style is dangerously close to imploding into a mass of curls any minute now, and so he stands a few steps back. Poor Ron is on the front-line, hugging her from behind.
He loves it, the freedom. It is infectious. Maybe- it is only a small chance, but just maybe, it could help him to stop regarding the place as his prison.
And on top of all that confusion, Harry doesn’t know how to proceed with finding out what Malfoy is up to- doesn’t know if he
Cindy watches mockingly from the comfort of her silken web, loaded with no burdens but that of her next meal. Nevertheless, Harry acknowledges that he would have still probably prevailed in finding a way to make this into a difficult task, had he been born a spider. He is just complicated like that, and Mcgonagall did always say that trouble followed him like a shadow.
It replays like a broken record, and not even one that Harry would have chosen- not one of the ones that he would have snuck onto the vinyl player on the rare occasions that the Dursley’s would take family days out, and Mrs Figg couldn’t take him. He had adored those- danced till the very roots of his bones were aching, in fact, no matter how much the recordings crackled.
Justin guffaws when the lights switch back to their dingy, normal colour upon his exit. Harry sighs and brushes his teeth even more vigorously.
“I didn’t mean to come here. I just...uh,” Harry fumbles for the right words, “ended up here, I guess. By chance.”
At this, Mcgonagall doesn’t appear to be surprised by any means. She simply nods and sets her drink down on the saucer in front of her with a measured
Justin just smirks a fraction, his thin lips curling at the corners and his eyes twinkling in amusement- but it isn't malicious, so Harry lets it go. “Look at us, eh, Harry? Can't handle a bit of sleep.”
Immediately, every corner of the room is filled with the buzz of animation and frenzied confusion. It only serves to increase in volume as friends begin to discuss what precisely this means. Harry thinks he has never seen Hermione so invested. Head lolling and eyes half-lidded, Ron, on his part, has the air of somebody who could drop dead in sleep at any second.
Malfoy hurries to the store cupboard, and stuffs a plethora of various ingredients into his leather satchel. His hair is ruffled and parting in waves, nothing like his usual combed style of the daytime. He pours the contents of the cauldron into an empty flask, before shoving that in his bag too. It seems to be heavy, and the glass jangles together noisily as he moves about.
Despite her obvious beauty, Harry feels a little uncomfortable, as if he’s playing a game that isn’t his. He shifts his legs and twiddles with his thumbs, and her face falls ever so slightly. They lie there together for a few idyllic minutes, her having moved back on her front and him leaning against the tree. A few leaves flitter into his lap and he tunes into the background noise of someone’s rap music being blasted somewhere near.
plot is building ;) still not giving much away but we have some more lovely draco-stalking time. but mainly i wanted this chapter to be about harry's relationships with people in his life- feel like its necessary.
Malfoy tilts his head, a shiver of a smirk on his lips. “So you admit it? You’ve been stalking me?” His voice is dripping with menacing tease.
sooo.... hope that was good? left everyone on a bit of a cliffhanger there! don't worry i wont take over a month to update this time, i promise. my mental health has been really bad recently and i have been really struggling to find motivation to do things like get dressed let alone write whole chapters of books. luckily, harry is my comfort character and i find a lot of joy in being able to express how i feel through him. its taken me a while to get here so i hope its okay? currently its 3am in the uk and ive written a lot of this very tired so i will go back and edit in this morning. i hope everyone is okay in these scary times (im still in shock... my exams have all been cancelled) and if anyone ever needs to chat, lemme know and we can exchange social medias etc x PLEASE LEAVE KUDOS AND COMMENTS BECAUSE I NEED THE MOTIVATION TO BE HONEST!!!!!! i love this story so much but #depression sometimes wins so yeah please be nice cos this takes a lot of my energy otherwise i will get sad lol anyway ok BYE love you all xoxooxo thanks for reading!
It has now been a few days since the incident in the common room. Harry cannot stop thinking about it for the life of him.The more he remembers about it, the more confused he becomes. What was Malfoy practising? Why was he so happy when he managed it? Why was he doing it in the middle of the night? Logically, if it had been something for class or study, he wouldn’t have waited till the shades of the night to do it. Also, logically, he wouldn’t have looked so fucking pleased. Nobody can look that delighted doing homework. Unless you’re Hermione, and even in her case, Harry thinks that it’s not so much for amusement, but rather an intense determination.
Unfairly, he feels a bit peeved- the words have dragged up what he is trying to bury under the hatchet. Like he has been done a grave injustice, Harry slams the book shut and shoves it back in his bag. He will read it another time. Who knows? It might not even be the same Loughfowl that Malfoy was writing about in the first place, and then he will just be wasting his own time like a fool-  precious time, which could be spent brooding in his bed instead. Important things, of course.
In a panic, Harry puts his ear up against the door, but abruptly comes to understand the mistake he has made.
In hindsight, Harry is not quite sure why he thought the best place to initiate his return to wizarding society would be the busiest and most well known street in Non-Muggle Britain. Diagon Alley, as always, is an eruption of colour, noise and smell. He gazes solemnly at Olivanders for a second, remembering the chilling emptiness of the shop the last time he had visited. Now, a pink haired teenager walks through the door, hand in hand with her younger sister and from the looks of it, a sparkling new wand. From further down the cobbled road, he can detect the whiff of the strawberry and peanut butter ice cream that he had once purchased from Florean Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlour with Ron and Hermione, and if he really strains his senses, the smoke of an explosion from Weasley Wizard Wheezes sifts through the air. He knows that, currently, Lee Jordan is running the shop completely singlehandedly, and he mentally sends him good fortune. Nervous first years and bubbling second years, eager to see their new-found best friends again, are flooding the streets with parents in one hand and bags of sweets in the other. However, as Ron had said there would be, he notes with sadness the significantly smaller than normal amount.
The next day finds Harry in Mcgonagall’s office. He had completely forgotten during the events of the previous day, but each Eighth year student has been called for a meeting, relating to careers and their dreadful ‘future prospects’. During the walk to breakfast, Ron, whose hair has nearly all grown back, was so nervous for his own that he began referring to Fred in the present tense. He had drawn back from the group upon realisation, clearly distraught by his own mistake. Hermione and Harry had been unsure what to do but were about to intervene nonetheless, when a whirlwind of red spared them the effort. Squeezing his shoulders and ruffling his hair, as if Ron were the younger sibling, Ginny managed to pep him back up.
She looks especially beautiful today, he thinks, as he registers her warm smile and eyes which twinkle brightly. Dressed in a light cotton trench coat, with a white blouse that compliments the depth of her dark skin, he wishes that he was deserving of her friendship. She reaches out a hand to him, and they are apparating to the Leaky Cauldron in a whirl of colour.
“The idea that just about anyone could read my mind is bloody terrifying. Wouldn’t want someone like Zabini digging around in there- not that he wouldn’t now, even if it’s illegal,” Ron says, “Shady git.” Harry snorts, thinking of Zabini’s mysterious poise and slippery manner, and deciding that- yes- it’s definitely an appropriate description.
too.” Justin gives him a look that makes his insides squirm. “If he was the guy of your dreams, he would deal with it.”
Except, it is- since most nights he can’t sleep thanks to Malfoy’s quiet, yet ear-splitting, huffs- so strangely vulnerable, so human.
soooo hope u liked that! just want to say thank you so much for reading, your comments are all so kind and they make me so happy. im actually quite surprised that so many of you are enjoying this story, so i hope i can deliver for you all. THIS TOOK ME SO LONG probs at least a good 30 hours.. im fine tho, just running on endless cups of tea. speaking of, i need to bring tea back into harrys life. its my coping mechanism and i like to imagine it is one of his only ones too. i hope this all makes sense to you all (or rather, doesn't, since it doesn't make sense to harry). this is all supposed to exploring how illogical the human mind can be sometimes and how lost u can feel in urself. love u all, hope ur well xxx
He thought that, in the worst case scenario, Malfoy would give him a blank, marble stare and leave. In the best, he would laugh, and potentially mock Harry. What he didn’t foresee was the undeniable anger in his voice.
Harry thinks she had the right idea; he imagines slapping his past self, the twat, for even considering coming to this cursed castle. Look where it has gotten him.
Pulled by some magnetic force, Harry moves a bit closer, to the end of the bed. He is careful about this, unlike he had been earlier with the Cloak. Every part of Malfoy’s body language, apart from his fingers, now stiff and motionless, yells of a spooked-cat. Harry doesn’t want him to run away. He himself does that often enough for the both of them.
. He’d rather take Zabini, with his smug arrogance and his twelve dozen mirrors, one hundred times over, than share his sleeping space with Malfoy. The boy might have been pardoned but his role in the death and destruction constantly rings in Harry's mind, no matter how much of a liking Witch Weekly takes to his
“You’re in love,” she states matter-of-factly, as if she hadn’t just said something most illogical and unfounded, “My name is Erin, by the way.” The daisy-chain is almost finished as she says this, and she smiles at it, as if she is keeping a secret that nobody else is aware of.
Currently, he is sitting on the Astronomy Tower. It isn’t as pleasant as he thought it would be; the long lengths of plank suddenly seem to accentuate how large the place is, and how little fills it.
It’s a horrific sentiment, Harry wants to block his ears and never hear of such things again. “No,” he mumbles, his stomach lurching.
“But it’s just Malfoy,” he groans, “You can’t say you don’t find the image of him wearing washing up gloves just a little bit funny.”
She makes a noise of agreement and smiles crookedly, her freckled nose twitching and teeth showing. “Yeah, Luna’s coming to watch so I need to get my A game on. Otherwise she’ll make some weird cryptic comment afterwards and I’ll wonder if it was an insult to my playing or not.” At this, she laughs lightly as they step into a cafe.
“Harry, if I get Malfoy in my dorm, please make sure my funeral is dignified. And that everyone cries loads. I want to know that I'm missed when I'm watching from up there. Also, tell Hermione she cannot date my brothers.” says Ron earnestly. He gulps and pats Harry’s shoulder before inching forward with all the bravery one would expect to find in a  Gryffindor. Unlike Harry, who knows he needs to move in order to find out his fate, but doesn't do anything to help accommodate this. Instead, he just stands frozen, like a deer in the headlights, rendered unable to spur his limbs into action. The idea that he could be sleeping, in close proximity, with complete strangers in the immediate future, as in tonight for Merlin’s sake, sends his mind into a wild hysteria.
At some point, Justin proves him right and does retire for the night. Harry is hyper-aware of the lack of others in the room. The chances are high that Malfoy is sleeping in another dorm-room by now, blissfully Harry-free. After his own embarrassing display of anger today, he would be surprised if he is ever even able to face the twat again with any bearing of pride. If their feud were a battle, Harry unquestionably lost the instant he let himself succumb to whatever monstrous fire they have unintentionally built between them. Until now, he has almost always held it together. Almost.
A light seems to swell before him- it must be bright because he can see it, even though his eyes are tightly shut and leaking. He opens them and, to his delight, sees the ball of silver from earlier. Granted, it could still be dark magic but he places some sense of faith in the beauty of the thing. It pulsates, as if agreeing.
“Got ‘em,” says Ron, arriving at their table. He places a Butterbeer in front of Hermione and Harry respectively, and with a wide grin, a Double Firewhiskey next to his own seat. “Had a run in with some dodgy looking bloke at the bar who told me that the Firewhiskey will make my hair fall out. Told him he sounded like a nutter, I did.” Still, Ron glanced at his tankard apprehensively.
, which Malfoy threw at him a week ago. It was probably their best example of communication as of yet.
His round cheeks, flushed with innocence, have clearly not yet seen the fumbling first use of a razor. Harry cannot believe that a child this bloody young can be so desensitised to the question, as if it is an everyday occurrence and not some freakish defiance of nature which still keeps Harry up at night.
Ron and Hermione walk closely together, their hands entwined as if they are one entity. He’s happy for them, he really is, but if they could save their affection for private so that Harry doesn’t have to plod alongside Ginny, as he is doing now, it would be most appreciated. Ginny’s long and auburn hair is swept into a ponytail, and he knows this means that she is going to Quidditch practise later. It’s something that he most admires about her. Her refusal to give into darkness- the way she throws it to one side like one of the Quaffles that she plays with.
However, Professor Caehorn, their new teacher for the subject, had posted last night that the Muggle Studies lesson is concessioned for the first week back at school. It’s Friday now and they have a free period. One being spent awkwardly in the dorm. Hermione and Ron are spending it with Ginny at breakfast. Harry is not, for obvious reasons. He would really rather not listen to his ex girlfriend talk about her new girlfriend, which he is sure Luna is, even if it hasn’t been explicitly stated. Even in his current state of being, he was apparently still able to muster up some complicated mix of misery and anger when he saw them holding hands at dinner the other evening. Ginny’s not his, not anymore, and perhaps never was- but to know that it could’ve been him, had he been able to get it together, hurts so much he sometimes feels like he can’t breathe.
When he returns to his dorm room, the corridor is filled with sounds of abrasive shouting. It rocks him, destroying the plan for a peaceful, crisis-free evening that he had laid out for himself on the route back from the library. Someone remind him why he came back to Hogwarts again?
With the magnitude of those silver eyes on him, Harry can’t help but remember the last time that he held eye contact with someone. It was about twenty minutes ago, he estimates- unless he really was sprinting through the castle for an hour- and has been firmly locked away in the back of his mind since then. Or so he thought. Now, plump lips hovering over his own is all he can think about, and he begs it to go away, panicked and frightened that he will be found out; Malfoy watches the whole debacle. With one hefty shove, he packs his approaching hysteria away for later. However, as hard as it was, the memory and images start to creep back in with every passing second. Emotions aren’t black and white, and he cannot just turn them on and off with a click of his fingers, as much as he enjoys kidding himself it is possible. Still, he tries.
His cowardice is becoming increasingly clear, but there is not enough shame in the world to spur him to action. Instead, he will just focus on his routines. He will go on walks. Yes, go on walks, maybe visit Hagrid, be subjected to listening to Ron and Hermione’s loving bickering like the proper third-wheel that he is. And he will do the mandatory things too, as unbearable as they are. He will eat three meals, leave the bed even when he doesn’t have to, get a good night's sleep,
The weather is stormy today, as are the people. Gloomily gathered above, the dark clouds cast a shadow over the grounds and the faces of the students alike. Everyone at Hogwarts seems to be in a strange, snappish mood, for Harry has witnessed countless fights all over the castle already, and it’s only noon. He had even been greeted with Ron and Hermione arguing when he arrived at breakfast, and to make it even more outlandish, the topic of controversy was simply whether they should do a couple costumes for Dean’s impending birthday party. Hermione was apparently abhorred when Ron suggested that she be the ‘sexy Healer’ to his ‘sick patient’, as Ron had later informed Harry. Privately, he is inclined to agree with her and thinks that Ron truly must be sick to have suggested such a thing. Though, he admits that the image is funny.
Harry shakes his head, feeling intrigued by the abandoned ones, “I think I’m gonna have a look at these.”
“Calm down, Potter. No need to look like a kicked puppy,” continues Malfoy, surprising Harry. He had begun to wonder whether that would be their parting words. “I’m sorry that I don’t fancy being another one of your projects. I just mean to say that sometimes it would be nice to not feel like I owe you.”
He would skip Malfoy, of course, who has steadily ignored all of them, much to Harry’s frustration. His stoic face and poised expressions seem to deliberately miss Harry’s gaze, turning from him whenever there is any chance of interaction. The snubbing annoys Harry to no end. Yes, he had promised himself before coming that he would dismiss Malfoy, no matter how many taunts he would throw at Harry. And it isn’t that Harry isn’t pleased to see the need for such measures proved unnecessary. Candidly, he hasn’t the energy- but to not even warrant one single insult? Harry can practically feel the bruise on his ego. His plan was to go on as he always has, but apparently he cannot pretend that everything is normal, because in a sane world, Draco Malfoy wouldn’t act as if Harry doesn’t exist, or rather that he does, but as just some irritating bug on his shoulder. In a sane world, Harry would mean something to Malfoy- even if that something is
“Maybe he isn’t then. The guy of my dreams,” says Justin, and he is staring at Harry with intensity. Staining his skin are the drying tracks from where his tears fell, running all the way down to his rounded chin. There is a pink flush rising high on his cheeks, which Harry is sure matches his own.
, and it wouldn’t do anybody any good to have Malfoy here to witness it. Stumbling backwards, Harry finds that he almost feels intoxicated. He lets his bed catch him as he falls back, and watches with a sick sensation in his stomach as Malfoy hurries away down the corridor. Again, he lost control of the conversation without even realising it. Why does he even try?
You know what? Good for him. It is probably more than he accomplished his entire four months at Grimmauld Place. Other than befriending Cindy and getting himself well-acquainted with the TV, that is. Important, adult things.
He bunked all of his lessons today, choosing to spend the day in the greenhouses. Neville needed help with a personal Herbology assignment, which he is hoping will push him over the edge just enough to get him accepted to an esteemed degree course in Wales. Harry seeks him out for his reliable, hands- on attitude.
Suddenly, Harry can’t take it anymore. His mind has been so mind-numbingly bored for so many months that he feels as if he is going into overdrive with expectation and information. “Sorry, what happened, Justin?” Harry inquires, feeling incredibly embarrassed in spite of their considerate and friendly faces, “You’ve been kicked out? How come?”
Malfoy is climbing out the bed, suddenly fully dressed despite never having left the spot to collect any clothes. Harry hasn’t heard a single shuffle, rustle or breath, either. Since yesterday’s incident, since Malfoy snapped at Harry- the first real sign of, well,
“Not ungrateful, no!” Harry desperately rushes to clarify, not eager to cause Justin any more distress. Without thinking, he grabs Justin’s hand, causing the boy’s eyebrows to raise, and pulls him back down next to him. His hand is warm, fingers knobbly, and Harry drops it, embarrassed. “That isn’t what I meant. I just meant to say...things might not be as bad as they seem. Nobody gives someone a wedding ring without caring for them first. I don’t think.”
“The one and only,” he says haughtily, staring at Harry with scrutinising judgement. His gaze flickers behind Harry, to the pool of bile on the planks, and his nose crinkles in disgust. Afraid it might cause him to be sick again, which would in turn elicit cruel teasing from Malfoy, Harry refuses to look at it. Instead, he just stares at the horizon. The moon is rising steadily over the mountains, her silver shadow beginning to cast over them. A creak of the floorboards causes Harry to look back at Malfoy, who is watching him with something indiscernible in his eyes. It makes Harry queasy all over again.
Last night, Harry experienced real, authentic humiliation when Anthony didn’t laugh at his awkward jibe about Voldemort being only a bit scarier than Justin in the morning. Even Justin had just chuckled uneasily rather than grant him the laugh he had been expecting. Thank Merlin for Ron and his warped sense of humour, something they can attribute to their delirious days on the run.
He runs to the Hospital Wing for the second time in the same day, clumsy and probably spotted at least once. How the Invisibility Cloak is supposed to hide a grown man is beyond him.
“Ron! Help!” says Harry with a grumble, thinking of all the looks he will get once back indoors. He doesn’t need any more attention drawn to him, and Hogwarts seems to be disturbingly bored with the lack of action in the school after such eventful years. It can be assured that a glimmering Harry Potter would not escape their notice.
Hands and bodies slam down on the carriage window, trying to grab his attention. Unofficial biographies written about his life are squished up against the glass and a head-shot of himself taken by Rita Skeeter in fourth year is leering at him menacingly. The noise is unlike anything he has ever heard before. Voice on voice upon voice overlap in an unsynchronised and roaring chorus, grating at his skin and mind with every relentless note. He squeezes his eyes shut and hopes that he can control himself in front of such a large crowd. The last thing he wants is to cause a spectacle and have himself plastered on the front page of the Daily Prophet. His recent absence from society has made them ravenous, practically foaming at the mouths for a chance at a piece of gossip on their hero.
. Feeling a tug in his stomach, he pushes the door open. A bell chimes somewhere as he enters the chilly room. Hermione follows a few moments later, and Harry faintly hears Ron mention that he is going into Zonkos, before dashing across the street.
helloooo hope this okay :) sorry if the pace seems at all slow but this will be a slow burner (because they are the best duh) and i want to explore everything in detail. this story will eventually become something over than just an eighth year story (hint hint: running away) so keep with me ;)
He takes Malfoy’s stiffness as an indication that he was, indeed, being a slimy git in some shape or form, and is trying to get Harry off his back with feeble insults. Well, he won’t stand for that.
The last part hits him where he is vulnerable. Harry is constantly lying- to himself, to his friends, to Malfoy, and he doesn’t even know how it happens, or when. It just does, and he is the saboteur in this shitty cycle.
hi hi hiiiii hope you enjoyed this one, i have lots of ideas and a plot that im very excited about to write so please stick with me as it all gets established :))))) this is a SLOWBURN so if that isnt your thing im sorry to disappoint but there wont be any proper good lovey-dovey fluff times between our two idiots for a little while.... but when it comes... itll be good i promise xoxo PLEASE LEAVE COMMENTS AND KUDOS AND SHARE ANYWHERE YOU LIKE :-DDD
Harry walks back to the dormitory with the note clutched tightly in his hand and doesn’t put it down until the next day. Malfoy thanked him, even after saying he would never do such a thing- he can’t believe it. Finally, he feels a sense of progress.
It hits him that whoever did this to Malfoy is still out there, and he promptly sets up a charm which will alert him if anyone is nearby. Hermione taught it to him, she teaches him everything he knows. He is useless without her. Where is she now?
And a second theory, worse yet, begins to brew and stew in his already bubbling brain. It is painful to consider, excruciating to contemplate. Certainly, though, it demands to be heard.
His spoon is cold against his thin fingers and he wishes he had some mittens. Or a self-heating spoon. That would be quite a luxury. He ponders whether Hermione could charm him one, but when he spots her snuggled into Ron’s shoulder like it is the happiest place on earth, he thinks that she is busy enough. Sighing, he shovels another mouthful of his soup with his regular, uncharmed spoon, only to find that it too has cooled immensely, thanks to Ron and his romantic snowflakes. He glares at it and pushes it away, having suddenly lost his appetite. Nobody pays his miniature tantrum any mind, and he judges it odd that he is always paid so much attention, yet simultaneously so little. Harry sometimes feels like he could stand on the table now and shout that he were to jump off the nearest mountain, and still nobody would discover him until they needed a good ol’ stare at or favour from their gracious Saviour, and couldn’t get it.
The sound persists and its volume is so overwhelming compared to the silence Harry which has become used to. Hiding in the space between his mattress and his pillow, he can ignore it no longer. It is ruining his depressive episode, for fucks sake.
Eventually, just to make this spectacular night even better, Justin betrays Harry in leaving him alone with Malfoy. He utters some excuse about needing to owl Elliot, but it’s all just words to Harry. As far as he is concerned, there has been some mighty treason committed this evening.
He startles upon his entrance to the common room, encountering a shocking sight. Dean and Seamus are heatedly making out on the sofa, entwined in each other’s grasp and clearly assuming that they are alone. Harry is confused. He thought that they were both straight. Up until recently, he had even thought that Ginny had been going out with Dean. All pointers say otherwise now, as Dean moves his hand up Seamus’ shirt and begins to lean over him, pinning him to the cushions. The room is silent other than the obscene noises of skin against skin, and lips against lips.
For the last four nights, he has awoken in a cold sweat, the ghost of Justin’s breath still tingling on his. Justin. Another
. He could lie and say that it was the fault of the other boy alone- that he came at Harry from nowhere, all soft lips, strong hands and bold movements. It would be in his best interests to do that, to go back to how it was before. It is as if Harry has been living with his curtains shut his whole life, existing in a hollow darkness but not knowing any different. But now, imagine that he has tripped, fallen head-first into these curtains. Picture the way they would open- just a glimpse- and a slither, only small, of golden light would burst into the room like a comet blazing through the sky. It would illuminate the spot on the wall opposite, a flowing outpour of energy never seen before. Would he just be able to just leave it at that? Keep them only half-open, doomed to never learn more, or even more torturous, dare to close them again?
For several tedious beats, Harry has to just stand there in anticipation as Malfoy basks in his joy. It must only be a few seconds but it creeps by painfully slowly. He is dressed in a thick winter cloak that looks incredibly warm and expensive, very on brand for a boy so spoiled, and Harry has to stop himself from using
Could it be Malfoy? Some part of him thinks it is undoubtedly so- the part which has been watching his every move, full of suspicion, full of distrust. The other part, the bit whose heart skipped in excitement when the boy spoke softly about tea, which felt the warmth of Malfoy’s humanity and the beginning of peace as they leaned over the railings at the Astronomy Tower together, says otherwise. He doesn’t know which to believe. One lives deep in their past, one in their future.
“I will, Professor. Thank you,” says Harry politely. As soon as the last letter leaves his lips, he runs out of the office, faster than he knew he was even capable of.
Finally, it is just about legible and his hands are still enough to discern the scrawl of his name. He scans the paper frantically, eyes scouring the blotted ink letters, with feverish urgency. He just needs to know now. Someone, some
, he offers himself as comfort, even though witnessing Malfoy in just a t-shirt and trousers is still enough to make him squirm uncomfortably.
The paper taunts him, hanging slightly out of the pocket as Malfoy leaves the room without any farewell. When Justin turns to ask Harry a question, he is met with Harry’s stare following the vision of the sheet, even after it is long gone.
Suddenly, the moon slides into the room. Silver hair is illuminated by the light emerging from the clouds; Malfoy looks otherworldly. “That’s something you’re never getting. Find it somewhere else.”
Trying to drown out the ringing in his ears, Harry curls in on himself and screws his eyes shut as tightly as he can.
Justin makes a sudden whiney noise at something Elliot says, and wipes vigorously at his eyes. He looks around in disbelief and snarls at the phone. Then, in an instant, his demeanour snaps from an all-consuming rage to a cold nothing. “Right then,” he says, chillingly calm, “Is that it?”
. As his clothes drop to the tiles, he redirects his gaze away from his body. It hurts so much he almost expects there to be bruises all up and down his skin. Just needing to assure himself that it isn’t, Harry takes a reluctant peek through his eyelids. There is nothing, as suspected, but he finds plenty of other issues with himself to compensate.
“To death by Slytherins!” Harry and Hermione repeat, clinking their own bottles against each other. It rings out loud in the common room, which has emptied out as the fire has died down, taking the light with them. Harry notices that Malfoy has disappeared. Theodore Nott glowers at them so hard that he looks as if he might break into two, and the three of them burst into laughter. Let him tell the rest of the snakes what they had drunk to, as if it will come as a surprise that they are full of hatred. It does tend to happen when you are on different sides of an all-consuming war.
“Anyways, you’re not fine either,” he states honestly. Malfoy looks affronted, and Harry shakes himself again. He needs to be at his premium; the other boy could leave at any moment and Harry would just be gaping like a fish out of water. “You’re not! Otherwise you wouldn’t be lurking up here for the second night in a row. Hypocrite.”
“Erin, I’m sorry but you’re mistaken,” he grumbles, “And possibly clinically insane. Go check yourself in right now.” At that, she barks a laugh which sounds like a peal of bells, and he cannot help but break his glower and join in. It’s contagious. He wonders what Ron and Hermione would think of him now and he decides that they’d be both proud and incredibly disturbed.
“Anyway, Malfoy, I could say the same to you. I’m not the only one in this conversation, you’re here too,” Harry says, and maybe it is too much for them to hold an actual conversation, maybe he needed to keep it flat. “What are
Gradually, he comes to a slow stop. There is a weird energy in the air, and he swears he can hear a faint tinkling sound ringing in the back of his head. The clouds seem to hang lower here, pressing down on him.
Once downstairs, he assembles the items he needs to take with him. He grabs his robes from where Hermione had set them out as a reminder the day prior. She seemed to be fretting that he might turn up in his carrot orange Chudley Cannon pyjamas. Seamus would have a field day.
Perhaps it’s Harry’s fault, since he has to be so fucking complicated- he wouldn’t be surprised if people are just scared shitless of pulling his trigger. He cannot find it in him to joke about the war itself. The thought of the battle, the fleeing, and the lives upon lives upon lives lost to what should’ve been his own fucking fight- they frighten him, make him lose grip of his own mind. But that last act- Harry killing Voldemort? It almost seems like a joke in itself. If he doesn’t make fun of it, of how terrifying the finality of that moment was, he might combust with the weight of it.
After Justin leaves, Harry keeps his eyes firmly shut in case the other boy is still lurking around. He doesn’t want to talk about what Justin just told him. If he does, he imagines that he would probably have to reveal that the knowledge that Malfoy is demanding to switch dorms indeed disturbs him. Consequently, Justin would require an explanation. Harry doesn’t have one, other than it pisses him off that Malfoy doesn’t want him around at all, not even to antagonise- and that is a rather shit and illogical excuse considering they are well known rivals.
He cannot give one, at least none that he deems legitimate enough to have warranted that gruesome outcome. And yet try as he might to forget it,  it still happened- Malfoy had almost bled out in the girl’s bathroom, blood pouring out of him like a flower opens its petals. The image of it makes him feel nauseous and the bubbling red liquid in the Pewter cauldron suddenly appears a lot more unappealing.
The singular thing in his mind now, other than bed, is Malfoy. Surprise surprise. He wants to know all the the comments left unsaid, all the emotions being hidden, so badly it alarms him a little.
Blatantly agitated, Malfoy spins back around, skinny frame fidgeting from side to side. He looks at Harry irritatedly, but he stops, and that is enough.
Something occurs to him. “What has Malfoy said in all this? Surely he knows them or at least has a clearer memory?”
It’s only the second night back at Hogwarts, Harry contemplates, but it feels like he has been here for years already. Preparing for bed is a little easier tonight, now that he has befriended Justin. They brush their teeth together in the bathroom, Justin admitting that he also prefers the Muggle way due to his heritage. There is an unsual moment when Justin compliments Harry's hair, leaving him flushing scarlet. “I’ve always thought that it looks quite artfully messy,” he says, looking at Harry with a sparkle in his eyes. The effect is ruined when Harry hears Malfoy snort at the comment as if it were the most ridiculous thing he has ever heard, walking past them to get something out of the cupboard.
Slowly taking off his hat, his blue eyes darting around to see who is watching, Ron reveals his very shiny, and very, very bald head.
Since then, things have been peculiar, to say the least. Because, for once in Harry’s entire existence, there seems to be a genuine sort of civility between them- not the fake kind, not the unspoken words and cold shoulders of the first few weeks. No, this time it feels real, of substance.
It’s a light and lofty corridor, and up ahead, there is a small archway which he assumes leads to their new rooms. Next to it, a sheet of paper floating with a suspended torch will dictate, he presumes, the rooming arrangements for their dorms. Whatever the outcome, he crosses his fingers in the hope that he and Ron will at least be bunked together. He digs his nails into his palms so deeply that it draws scant beads of blood. The intensity of anticipation treads on his chest, flattening the sense of calm he has managed to maintain for the majority of the evening. Fortuitously, as of yet he has coped with any invading flashbacks and memories quite well, but he is dreading the thought of going through the ordeal without his best friend, his rock, beside him. He gets the impression that he might permanently drift away into insanity if Ron isn’t there to ground him with his solid presence.
“I don’t believe you,” he mutters, deflated. It is the third time he has said it, he knows, and he feels like somebody’s parrot.
“Hey, guys. You, uh, having fun?” And he flinches at how awkward he sounds. Couldn’t he have just left them alone without saying anything? They seemed to be content enough to ignore his being- would have never known he was here. Stupid Harry.
Whoever the attacker was, they aren’t in sight. This makes him even more aware of the dark, all the opportunities it would give someone to hide. Somewhere far in the distance, a branch snaps and he whirls around. Logically, he knows it could just be an animal, but the terror that has struck his body tells him otherwise.
“It could be worse,” says Ron in a kind yet unhelpful manner, his eyebrows upturned and smiling at Harry weakly.
“Whereabouts?” asks Harry, rubbing at his cheek. When he pulls his hand away, it is bejewelled in gold sparkles and he groans. Switching to his other cheek, he does it again and receives the same distressing news when he once more brings back his hand. “Fuck. Ron, is it everywhere?”
It’s the silhouette of two birds, who dance together against this gilded backdrop, that he’s watching when he realises that the doorbell is ringing impatiently. He slings his satchel over his shoulder and prepares to meet Hermione and Ron for the coming day.
Seamus looks up from under Dean, shuffles a little bit so that he is sitting straighter- but other than that, makes no apparent movements to remove himself from his entangled state. He grins, face flushed red and hair askew. Dean is surprisingly bashful, for the broad and masculine guy that he is, twisting his head away from Harry. His attempts at covering up his embarrassment are futile- Harry can see the heat rushing across his dark skin. Or perhaps that is just a result of his, uh, predicament. It looks rather comfortable from where Harry is standing.
“What? Don’t bullshit, Malfoy! I saw it earlier!” Harry proclaims, frustrated. It’s not like he even particularly feels like fighting with Malfoy anymore, but the idea that he can be dismissed so easily doesn’t sit well with him.
He observes, disgusted yet intrigued, as her wand draws a substance, black and gloopy, out of Malfoy’s mouth. It seems to never cease, and Harry pales, imagining how it would feel to have that inside him. Sticky, like tar, and teeming with a dark aura that even him in all his blindness could spot from a mile away. Eventually, the last is trickling out, clutching the edge of Malfoy’s lips like he is the antidote. Mcgonagall swishes her wand and the goop gathers into a ball. She swiftly transfigures a nearby stone into a glass vial to contain it.
“So, Mr. Potter, I gather it is still your intention to enter Auror training after this academic year?” She asks with a sip of her tea. Her emerald green robes fall with authority as she lifts her arm, china cup in hand.
“Hey!” he pretends to be offended and shoves playfully at Justin’s side, “Speak for yourself. I’m a strong guy.”
“Harry, you do know what happens when a wizard loses or breaks their original wand, right?” she sniffs, glancing in at the small queue of customers waiting, “Because I would hope that you would recognise how horrible of a situation it is.”
, but rather is peering down at them from the quaint Mahogany desk next to his bed, face plastered with an unreadable expression that refuses to give anything away. Harry suspects it probably would say
Finally, heart hammering, he lifts his eyeline to meet Malfoy’s. Forget everything he has ever said- this wins first place by a landslide for the most difficult moment of his life. The weight of his head on his neck is heavier than a heart soaked in guilt.
In a state of shock and anxiety, he begins to question whether he did make up that encounter earlier, though he is certain he did. It was certainly Voldemort’s voice, and Harry dreads to think that he could ever return. Though he had watched his body fall, watched it crumple and give into the weight of holding pure evil, he has to admit the thought does plague him. In a world where the lines of science and magic are blurred, you can never feel complacent. Voldemort came back from near-death once before, and Harry isn’t definite that he couldn’t again. He also feels overwhelmingly guilty that he wasted so much time- was even worried that it was Malfoy himself who tried to kill him- when the boy in question had in fact been here, dying alone whilst he hugged a tree.
Harry squirms and wipes his hands on his trousers. “Definitely,” he replies, not breaking eye contact.
If only he weren’t a coward, then he would endeavour to talk to them about it all. But that’s a different life, and a different boy. He’s just Harry, who got lucky, and wishes that he hadn’t.
Once he notices Harry, Malfoy’s previously informal expression transforms rather magnificently into an stormy frown. Harry isn’t quite sure what he’s done, other than exist, but he supposes that could be enough to ignite Malfoy’s rage. Considering the usual aura of aloofness, Harry welcomes his fury like he is greeting an old friend. It is just his luck that it is as he thinks this that Malfoy’s countenance snaps back into the facade that Harry has come to know and
He waits for Justin to say something else, to slap him playfully and move to his respective bed. Any second now, they will break apart and resume their evenings, business as usual.
“Maybe he likes it, gives him more attention,” offers Harry halfheartedly, not really believing his own words as he reflects on Malfoy’s despondent, bizarre attitude.
brooding nocturnal stroll. No one had promised him that it would be free of other people, and yet he had naively presumed it would be. Trust Malfoy to ruin that for him. He frowns and almost groans aloud before he remembers the other boy’s presence. This bloody routine that seems to be forming, the one where Harry stumbles across Malfoy- it is really screwing with his head. At this point, he isn’t sure it is even accidental anymore.
Sighing, Justin places himself down on Harry’s bed, on his right side. There is no answer and Harry curses himself for being so blunt. Fate doesn’t exist, he concludes. He knows this because, if there was, surely Anthony would have walked through that door instead of Harry. And he would have done it a whole lot more stylishly and suave than Harry ever could. Justin runs a hand through his auburn hair, but his ring gets caught. It is made up of two simple silver bands, interlocking with each other in an embrace. Harry has often thought of rings as being garish things, overly expensive for what they are: just a few rocks that some guy baselessly deemed prettier than the other rocks, and metal. Observing this one though, he considers maybe he has been searching for beauty in the wrong places.
He remembers last night, as memory gushes into his mind along with full consciousness. How could he forget the way that Malfoy had been wrecked with sweat from brewing potions in the heat of the room? It was a shocking sight, so different to his usual appearance. Even at his worst- the trial, the war- Malfoy has never looked quite as willingly sloppy as he did then. It was apparent in the war and its aftermath that Malfoy knew he looked less than perfect, and was not pleased about the matter.
be giving Malfoy his own, complimentary setting. It’s unfair, and a clear demonstration of treachery from the castle- to make Harry have abhorrent thoughts about Malfoy and his fucking bone structure. Unbelievable.
“Did he? I’m surprised his conscience stretches that far. How did you hear about that, then?” he asks, as nonchalantly as possible.
And he doesn’t know how, or why, but the atmosphere shifts. It is only by a couple of centimetres, but Justin definitely moves closer. The air in the room has turned thick and oppressive; he begins to sweat a little, despite the Autumn chill.
Malfoy snorts and wraps his robes tighter around himself. They seem to swallow up his skinny frame, despite his considerable height. A clasp, detailed with the Malfoy family crest in opulent  jewels of green and white, sits in the middle and ties the winter cloak together. “What a lie. You’re about as fine as Filch is attractive.”
He looks Harry up and down once, assessing him as one might do a remarkably annoying child, proceeding to walk away only when Harry stares back at him blankly. Harry panics a bit, but watches his back and counts two steps in his head.
His future. It is such an unfamiliar thing, so estranged. He supposes that, in all honesty, he didn’t expect to have one up until a few months prior. And even afterwards, in the gloom of Grimmauld Place, most days he still felt like he was a second from withering away. Now, Harry isn’t yet sure whether he actually exists. How can somebody not present have a future?
also regarding corona, i hope everyone is safe and sound. i live in the uk and i feel like nothing is happening, its terrifying. sending everyone lots of love- if you ever need to chat let me know :) x
“Because that is a Vanishing charm, Ron, and I don’t know about you, but I feel like doing one on my own face would most likely be a bad plan!”
It might be ten minutes or twenty- possibly even an hour, time is fluid past a certain point in the night- when he hears the telling rustling of Justin climbing into bed. With his senses so cut off like this, he finds that he listens to every minute detail. Even if he didn’t know that Justin was the only one who would be getting into the bed beside him, he would be able to tell from the specific noise of his movements. Unlike Anthony, whose steps are heavy and indicate his girth, Justin moves like he is worried he will hurt the ground with the weight of his feet. Gentle and slow in pace. And, likewise, vastly different to Malfoy who, despite his newfound placidity, still travels swiftly and with certainty everywhere he goes. Malfoy doesn’t walk so much as
“Morning,” he breathes deeply, “I love days like this. Just makes you feel happy.” says Justin, returning the smile. He turns away from Harry to stare satisfactorily at the gently gleaming window frame. The paint is peeling a little around the edges, a formation of petal-like curls which are aglow with sunlight.
The statement hangs heavy in the air, and is only absolved by a shy breath from the boy in discussion.
He shuffles awkwardly on his feet as he clambers for something comforting to say. Nothing comes, so he asks what he really wants to know, “How come?”
It happens now. Mcgonagall narrows her eyes, and the slight raise in her eyebrows tells Harry she doesn’t deem his display particularly impressive.
Expecting her to walk back to the till, he turns away, but she comes to stand next to him. “I would recommend this one,” she indicates to a green, leather bound book in the basket, “It has a few torn pages, hence why it is cheap, but is otherwise in good condition. I’ve read it myself and found it to be a stimulating read.”
He isn’t sure how going back to the Potions lab could help him, but his intuition is leading him there, so he is following it. There isn’t much he trusts in this world, but his gut instinct is almost always right. The only advice he would take over it is Hermione’s, because he is certain that in her entire life, she is yet to be proven wrong.
Malfoy creeps away into the dead of night, a thin figure drowned by the shadows, and Harry stares at the empty space left behind until the Siren’s song of his bed cannot be resisted any longer, and he trudges off too, hoping that he doesn’t run into Malfoy in their dorm room.
Needing to escape the relentless moaning and dismal faces which were threatening to drag him into a scarily familiar depression, he had attempted to sneak away from his mates once the lesson had finished. Caught, Hermione had raised her eyebrow as he stumbled away, and he prayed that she wouldn’t question him. She seemed to sense his worries, in that wonderful Hermione way, and just smiled tightly. As she squeezed him goodbye, her earl grey scent relieved some of his tension.
As she embraces him in the hallway, her earl-grey scented perfume soothes an ache he didn’t even know he had and he releases a long sigh of contentment. When all goes to shit, one can always count on Hermione’s ability to spark a burst of motivation, even if it is brief. He doesn’t think that he would have ever made out of the cave, as he has taken to calling his bedroom in an attempt to force him to leave it, had it not been for her persistence. There is grace and excellence in being the bossiest one in the room, he ponders fondly.
He pointedly ignores the fact that he doesn’t even plan to interrogate Malfoy tonight, and rather, just itches to speak to- or
Harry isn’t sure how long he is there, but he can tell by the gradual changes to the mixture that it is sometime. The night dawns even closer, making it even harder to discern what is happening in the room as the shade of twilight grows. His brain is fried, and his limbs are numb, and this is partly why he cannot move from the spot, even if he wanted to. If Malfoy were to make sudden gestures to leave, he thinks he may just have to resign himself to getting caught.
About to leave, allowing himself a smidgen of disappointment, Harry turns away. However, the tinkle that he had thought he heard earlier rings louder, alarmingly so. It almost sounds... panicked? His eyes seek out the silver light and find it vibrating in the air. Sucking in a deep breath, he moves a step closer. The ball seems to take this as a sign and glows brighter still, and then zooms away around a nearby blackberry bush. Some peculiar force tells Harry to follow, and follow he does.
As he travels through his newfound passages, he wonders why Malfoy is in the Astronomy Tower of all places. These days, it pretty much has no function. Mcgonagall decided that lessons there wouldn’t continue, out of respect for Dumbledore. There are plenty of other towers available in the castle anyway, ones which don’t have associations with murdered headmasters. Formally, you can go up there upon request. However, it has become, despite Mcgonagall’s efforts to keep it bordered off, Hogwarts’s newest snogging spot.
Ron shoots them the finger. He doesn’t blame him. Poor Ron. They run after him amusedly, kicking the newly laid ginger path as they go.
He is surprised that Madam Pince hasn’t come hurtling round the corner with her finger already raised to her paper-thin lips, ordering Ron to shut his gob. She could be at dinner, it is around that time, but somehow Harry has the impression that she never eats and rather feeds on the fear of the first years that she terrifies.
CW/TW: descriptions of a near death experience, multiple mentions of suicide and PTSD/ anxiety attacks
“Nah,” he shakes his head again, “I’m sorry to break it to you. If it helps, I think it suits you.” He erupts into laughter when Harry glares at him, harbouring a secret plan that involves a whole army of heart bubbles and Ron also getting soaked in glitter.
“Still though, that’s tough, Justin. I’m sorry. I thought Muggles were generally quite accepting of you lot.” says Neville.
To Harry’s dismay, the moment is broken when the door creaks open, revealing Malfoy. His face blanches at the sight of them, and he doesn’t move for a moment.
It leads him around several trees, bushes, before Harry begins to wonder what he is doing. For somebody who has lived in the magical world for years, he is secretly still sometimes a little skeptical. Whether it is the magic itself or just his general distrust of his own brain is debatable. Whilst he had followed Snape’s Patronus back in the war, that was a legible thing, an obvious and undeniable piece of magic. A minute light ball, however, which could just as easily be a trick of his tired and anxious mind? He is not so sure.
Harry is more than a little interested. He wonders whether Justin would judge him if he asked for some too. It wouldn’t be like him to, but Harry really doesn’t like those moments of revelation- the ones where the other person sees through your shell, directly into the place where you are most vulnerable, and realises
“I know this is a bit of a stupid one but I’ve been meaning to get round to practising making a Asmandrius Potion. Want to help?” says Justin, “And then we can do something for you if you would like.”
, Hermione's voice whispers in his head and he feels like flipping it off. Alright, alright, he gets it.
“I, for one, would appreciate a lift in morale. Some of us are not especially eager to be returning, and I think it would help.” she says, looking pointedly at the two of them.
sooo.... how we feeling? honestly these chapters could be total shit and i wouldn't know because after a while i have no clue what i'm writing anymore. i hope not tho. basically things are really gonna kick off in the next chapter and im excited about it because i have so much plot planned which has been set out since like chapter three and setting it up has taken so longggggg. but i love slow burns with more detail so hopefully you guys do too (im sure you do, otherwise you probably would have quit this story by now)!!! also im sorry about the justin/harry moment.... i know you guys are here for drarry. but i wanted harry to have a bit of a gay realisation before anything happened because its realistic and gritty and the truth is that one day you just realise hey i think my friend is hot oh shit im bisexual....that is what is happening in a nutshell ahahahahaha!! because this story is so harry centric i didn't want his sexuality issues and internalised homophobia to JUST be all about draco- he has his own lil mind too <3
Harry takes his time preparing for bed. He shuffles around in the bathroom after shrugging on his newest jumper from Molly. The wool is somewhat itchy but he likes the way it warms his skin. Even agitation and the rash he feels forming are preferable to the detached state that had plagued him earlier that day, causing his body to lock and freeze. It reminds him of the lonesome months in Grimmauld place which he is trying so desperately hard to move on from, where he was incapable of understanding the needs of his mind and body. Letting himself decay.
“Who is in your dorm then, ‘Mione?” Harry asks, trying to bring his attention to more important matters than his upcoming death.
“It has been a difficult year, as we all know, and the hardships that we have all faced should bound us tighter than ever. Inter-house unity has never been so important in creating a more peaceful and accepting society. Let it be known that Hogwarts will not tolerate any prejudice towards any students, and this includes towards the members of Slytherin House,” Harry glances over at Malfoy, who is trying to seem disinterested at the speech as he stares at the ceiling. The fact that he is picking at his nails gives him away.
When he awakes, Hermione and Ron are shaking him, and he realises that he has managed to sleep the entire journey. Congratulations Harry, he thinks, consistently proving the impossible, possible.
“D-don’t let me stop you from your, uh, fun,” stutters Harry, repeating the same stupid sentiments as earlier. Seamus laughs but rapidly reenacts the lip-locking sequence when Dean looks daggers at him in warning. Couldn’t they just move to the dorm room? There is plenty of sweet, sweet privacy there, where upon their arrival, innocent eyes across the castle would be spared. Like Harry’s, for example.
Despite being pretty minor in the grand scale of things, this offer of companionship means the whole world to Harry. He has a friend- a real one- who isn’t just Ron or Hermione, and one who isn’t about to give up on him, or leave him. He hopes.
He wishes he could spare this same energy for Ron. Merlin knows the man deserves it, with everything he has to put up with in regards to Harry and his mood swings, let alone his own issues. Fred flashes before his eyes with a cheeky grin and his heart lurches. He wonders how many times a day Ron sees him. Beside Harry, laying on his back with his arms behind his head, Ron has his eyes closed, and Harry imagines sadly that he could be at this very moment. His ginger hair has created a halo of red around his face and looks like fire amongst the grass.
Remembering something that Dean had said, Harry is curious- was Malfoy not invited to this Slytherin meeting in Dean and Seamus’ dorm room? The question gnaws at him but he knows better than to ask. He is quite fond of his head, thanks.
“He’s a tosser. I know he wasn’t technically on the Dark side during the war, but he may well have been. It’s obvious the only reason his family didn’t dedicate themselves completely is due to some political power play. I’m all for forgiveness but he’s so smug, as if he’s a saint. It gets on my nerves.” Justin had said, justifiably in Harry’s opinion, and Malfoy had frozen solid. Harry had moved to change the subject as subtly as possible, in order to avoid a fight. Whilst he may have been itching for a go with Malfoy the day prior, he wouldn’t wish such a pathetic brawl on Justin. Those pointy elbows do look as if they could poke an eye out.
At the risk of sounding like a whining child, Harry is fed up. He is tired and extremely hungry, having missed dinner by now. When he focuses a little, he notices that his legs are marginally shaking. Whether that is from the intensity of his day or the running from Dean and Seamus, he isn’t sure. He wants to go to bed. The least Malfoy could do is answer his perfectly sane questions. And they
When Harry doesn’t offer any immediate response, he gives in and faces him again. He raises his eyebrow expectancy. It shows off his birthmark.
He finally breaks through Harry’s bodily barrier, only to spin around with his finger pointed in the air.
“Firstly, I’ll begin by mentioning that, as always, the Forbidden Forest is off limits to students and under no circumstances should you venture anywhere near its borders without the presence of a member of staff.” she says, and Harry feels as if she is directing her comment at his area of the Gryffindor table. Somewhere further down the bench, a student yawns exaggeratedly at the information, which is consistently annually repeated, and a chorus of giggles echoes throughout the otherwise silent hall.
