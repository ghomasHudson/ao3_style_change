much emphasis on family reputation, clearly it still meant something to pure and half-bloods, as Susan was probably the de facto leader of the first year Hufflepuffs by the time their first semester ended. Even muggleborns who didn’t quite get the whole bloodline business fell in line to her magnetic, burning personality, and with her very openly happy about the football club and welcoming Harry in every time he came to sit at the Hufflepuff table, he found himself branching out quickly.
“No, we still need two teams, but I had the

He was offering to be nice, forcibly, not because of an actual wish to play football with him.

And aside from the thousands of potential potions out there, there’s enough incidents in potions class alone that he could make it look like an accident and blame it on Neville if he really wanted to. He could probably even convince Neville it was his fault and have him confess even.” He pointed out, Blaise shrugging like it didn’t matter to him either way.
It sounded like he heard Snape inhale sharply, but the black spots were well and truly multiplying now so he couldn’t see the Potions professor at all to even confirm it was really him.

"Why don't we form our own team? I mean there has to be at least a football team's worth of muggleborns who'd be interested in this school, and Hogwarts has probably quadruple the amount of land you'd need for a football field—probably more to be honest." He suggested, and all three of them looked at him in surprise. Seamus and Draco seemed too taken off guard to be sure, but Dean lit up like a Christmas tree.

Annoyingly enough, sitting with Draco even protected him from getting failed for classwork as Draco’s potions were immaculate and always had been—

Blaise stiffened and then smoothed down the front of his robes once more.
And then there was a roar that almost made Harry pass out in terror, but his body pushed harder automatically as if it knew now was not the time to do anything but

and so it only took him a couple weeks to get very, very good at this. Even if he thought up a plan and a back-up, doing nothing for hours on end inevitably had his mind circling over his plots again and again, almost always coming up with something else he hadn’t thought of to prepare for, the result being
“Guys like you are hilarious—you need to pick on a couple first years to feel big huh?” He snarked, preparing for whatever curse was coming, needing to hold onto Draco tighter as the wrist in his hold attempted to break free for a brief second. “Give those back, jerk.”
to be helping him even if it made sense for him to get implicated in this or not. Because Gryffindors put friends before fear of danger at every opportunity, and Neville was a good guy who, while he was still afraid of Hagrid, still respected the groundskeeper enough to not want him to get arrested. Even Neville who was flat out petrified of what they were about to do, still considered a couple of detention in exchange for Hagrid’s continued freedom a fair price.
The Slytherins present, including Blaise even though he was the one who asked, were legitimately surprised Harry had an actual answer to that question… and what the answer was too.
All of it was gone now. He was not only pale, but pale enough that he definitely looked terminally ill and borderline grey in some places. He was sure his own disgust and uneasiness about his appearance did not help his pallor, but given that obtaining dreamless sleep potions and calming draughts was high on his list of to-dos, he didn’t expect that to change anytime soon.

Either way it was too late, and before he could get his mouth to say ‘
“That depends on what it is, because I’ll have you know the twins gave me a ‘get out of a prank’ pass and that’s mighty attractive.” He lied, just to tease Blaise because he wasn’t actually sure if the twins had a present somewhere in that pile, but it didn’t seem to matter.
And Harry actually liked Draco and would’ve walked away cold because of something less, but

in the direction of implying an invitation, he’d been shut down pretty swiftly. He knew Harry’s relatives didn’t like magic and he was actually hiding the fact he was writing to him at all from his family, so he got the message pretty quickly that his guardians wouldn’t let him go even if he had officially invited him.
With a sigh Nott collected his bag and walked off, and Blaise looked at Neville expectantly, who jumped and sat down in Nott's vacated seat quickly. He looked like he half wanted to say something as Nott walked away, but couldn’t quite manage it.
He was seriously starting to wonder if they were trying to outright kill him by locking him in a 40C outdoor building with an in-no-way-sufficient water supply for even a couple days. By the time the second night was halfway through, Harry realized they had

Eventually.
She’d almost forgotten that sliver of relief she’d felt, buried beneath everything else when she’d watched her cousin get sorted into Gryffindor instead, when she realized all that talent and power and legacy was not actually going to be the noose around her neck for the duration of her life until it wound too tight to breathe.
Hedwig didn’t respond—in fact after a brief pause she flew up to the rafters and seemed to hide behind one of the beams. He lifted his head to glare at her mildly.
That did however mean he was between Harry and a very shocked looking Dean, who seemed to freeze entirely, having no clue what he was supposed to do with a snake on the bench beside him. Harry thought both his and Draco’s painfully straight posture giving away that he wasn’t quite as comfortable as he was pretending to be was hilarious and let out a laugh.
It was as the blue mist was starting to fade and Harry sensed they were coming to an end of whatever she was doing, that she spoke again.
She lifted a brow, noting the color they were shining. “That’s part of the spellwork drill. These buttons are enchanted to reveal the level and type of magic you’re using on them.”
“So if I send a letter to him…?”
And a classmate who’d proven to love to talk to any and everybody many times—most of them were in this club because they’d been cornered by him at one point or another in the first place—so thankfully they were happy to just walk up to him and ask.
"Is that a muggle band?" Neville interrupted his thoughts by asking, and Harry blinked once before realizing he was talking about his shirt. Flying was a free-dress period and while most didn’t bother running up to change between their last class and this one, Harry had jumped at the chance to get out of the boring black robes like he did every day. He'd opted for a quarter-sleeve, deep red shirt with the band logo a black and clashing pink. He

, right? They were friends, he was… moderately confident to say that, even believe it most of the time.
“I got that feeling,” He sighed. Snape reputation was infamous, and Harry was making his rounds around the school like the social butterfly he decided he wanted to be and so he got a lot of details he kind of wished weren’t going to end up being true. Heck, even the Ravenclaws warned him Snape was a bully towards Gryffindors, and while they weren’t the sort to lambast someone with insults or speak back to a teacher because of injustice, their very serious, quietly hushed warnings spoke volumes.
"I don't think teal is my color." He intoned wryly, but he was smiling.
“Alright,” He allowed, not really sure what to make of that. It was weird enough to hear a Slytherin call a Gryffindor a coward, and he knew there had to be more to it, he just… wasn’t about to get into it today, nor was he about to pick her brain for details. He was sure that was a bad idea.

have a bit more time before they needed to be back at Hogwarts, and the letter in his pocket suddenly got a bit heavier as he remembered the other things he needed to ask. He could just hand the letter to Axeclaw and it would tell him about Dumbledore probably being the one to cast the mail ward and such, but everything else… he kind of needed an answer, and he wasn’t going to get another chance to speak face-to-face with the goblins until Christmas easily, if that since he wasn’t sure he’d be allowed to leave the castle without an adult
She only nodded, accepting this for once as a truth she didn’t need to question.
Also, he felt a little light-headed from having a wand pointed directly into his face. To say it didn’t bring up great memories was an understatement.
She hadn’t given it any thought since the first day of term when Severus had stormed off seeing the two young first years share their schedules, and then refuse to show up for meals for the entire next week. She’d thought he was being dramatic, honestly.
“It was a bit ‘o luck, winnin’ that hand, I’ll admit.” He relented. “An’ the Hog’s Head is a
Harry sighed, sliding his hand from just being a comforting gesture on his arm to wrapped firmly around his wrist, lifting it and pulling him forward a bit. Neville blinked in alarm, forgetting to be humiliated and shy as he looked up in panic—but Harry was just smiling his most non-threatening smile possible and lifted his hand up pointedly, revealing a spare shiny bracelet he’d slipped off his own wrist in his free hand.
It would also give him five weeks to position Montague exactly where he wanted him.
“Until next time, Mr. Monroe.”
It was indignant now, but Harry seemed to have passed whatever test the boy had posed and now he grinned widely in more reasonable greeting than his faked cold indifference. “I was merely missing my morning entertainment is all.”
“Okay
“I’ve only seen that mirror once and I don’t know how it works.” He defended, taking a calculated risk in revealing that. He didn’t know what Quirrell thought he’d be able to get something out of this mirror, but there had to be a reason, and he was banking on the fact he could bargain on it. “And also if I could get it, you’ll kill me the second you have it.”

"Ah, well… he's a Cerberus. But a lovely one!"

already plotting on how to get back here and figure out the growing list of questions he had. He did not think Hagrid was the person to answer any of them, and he didn’t even want to ask it to the goblin—Griphook—who’d escorted them down because too many questions and there was too much of a chance it’s be reported back to Dumbledore by Hagrid’s too-naïve nature. He still hadn’t even met the Headmaster yet and was not willing to leave anything to the chance that the mysterious man would somehow use it against him.

Harry pat his arm sadly, acknowledging there really wasn’t anything he could say to make it better.

With a silent sigh he pushed it from his mind and went about the rest of the day—school, chores, dinner, chores, cupboard. Like every other day, especially now that he was trying to avoid trouble, doubly so until the snake incident was put from their minds.

As it was he didn’t learn anything useful as most snakes were in the same boat: it was only the first day so most of their plans and plots hadn’t even taken form yet, much less been started. They couldn’t gossip about others plots if no one actually had them yet.
Or, he thought he was on quiet feet, but Neville seemed to hear him anyway.
But the Headmaster had given her

All of Slytherin wants to know if you’re dead but wouldn’t actually lower themselves to come on their own, so here I am. And since you’re awake and I know it before anyone else, I’m now atop the rumor mill: I’ve only got a couple hours to bank on this and daylight’s burning.” He brushed it off delicately.
late—he wanted to ask permission to perform a new spell from his joke book from McGonagall and she’d actually allowed him to do it which was awesome, except her only available office hours for his schedule today meant he was kind of hustling to get to his next class on the other side of the school. Hence the running with his bag slung round his shoulders and his book tucked tightly into his arms.
Also, he wanted to be able to congratulate Draco, or at least be there for him if it didn’t turn out so well once try-outs were done.
“Is this about what you mentioned earlier?” He asked curiously.
Her eyebrows slowly rose over the long silent minute she read the first paragraphs. Harry just waited patiently with a big grin on his face, waiting for her reaction.
“I’d like to hear your thoughts on it, if that’s okay?” He offered as an olive branch, and Neville frowned at him, not understanding. “I mean, not Draco or his family exactly but I guess sort of… everything?

He laughed it off though, either way.

progress Harry had made—learning to shut the hell up and just wait him out, and now Neville was very comfortable with taking all the time he needed to formulate his words without fear Harry was going to talk over him, safe in the knowledge Harry would sit there and wait until he was good and ready to speak.
Neville made a soft sound of distress beside him and Harry decided this was enough with a pointed roll of his eyes.

It was an awkward grip and he felt his heart lodge into his throat as the weightlessness of flying his own broom disappeared and then both of them were tumbling to the ground with an unhelpful broomstick between them.

Axeclaw stared.
Whether she was actually going to answer that or not, Harry didn’t know as the door opened again and Axeclaw returned pushing a small goblin-sized cart with several items laid out on it. With a sinking in his chest he did note the large silver dagger on a delicate silk cloth—he was starting to realize everything goblin-magic related required blood which was… well.

“Because we’re going to get caught, probably.” Harry said for what felt like the twentieth time, patting Draco on the shoulder a bit patronizingly because the boy was being dense. “And a Slytherin already sold us out to Snape, so they’ll probably do it again, so Snape will be the one to catch us. Probably.
for making Draco suffer.
Which is why he also had a note for Hagrid asking to come to tea later that afternoon, another letter to put in an order for any new Transfiguration texts Bethany’s Books got in this year, an order for more shampoos he really didn’t need from the hair shop in Contrair Alley, an order to sign up for the Daily Prophet, another order for the Quibbler at Luna’s recommendation, a letter for Osmias to let him know if he made any progress with his poison-detecting glasses, and an
He bit down hard on that thought, trying not to let it break him.
“We shouldn’t stand in the doorway ‘Arry, come on,” Hagrid chirped, guiding him with one huge hand down onto the street, Harry just gaping and looking every which way trying to take it all in at once.
telling the truth… and then that would mean…
It would’ve actually been pretty nice if the entire time Harry’s instincts weren’t screaming at him that he was missing something. If Mrs. Malfoy’s plentiful conversation didn’t ring every alarm bell in Harry’s head as he tried not to give too much away to the incredibly talented Slytherin woman. He
him to get involved was a lot easier. It was kind of a relief to just accompany others on their own plans that they’re in charge of, and that he could just enjoy the ride without thinking too hard on it.
Not that Harry was cocky or anything, he smirked to himself.
“Her aunt is Madam Amelia Bones—she’s the head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement in the Ministry, so it’d be easy to check something like that. Something weird she said, or I thought it was weird because she thought it important to bring up in the first place, was that Dumbledore was trying to get through your wards but couldn’t get past the goblins.”
And the culprit was decent to answer him properly this time. “The object is a magical artifact called the Philosopher’s Stone. It is capable of granting one immortal life, and turning anything it touches into gold. Truly a wonderful feat of Alchemy created by a dear friend of mine, Nicholas Flammel.” Dumbledore gave a weary sort of trite sigh. “As you can imagine many people have sought this stone over time, for various terrible purposes. After this event I have spoken at length with him, and he has agreed that the best thing to do is to destroy the stone so that no one will be tempted in such a way again. He has just enough time to get his affairs in order before its power wears off, but agreed that it is time.”
“And you can just fly whenever you like at your house?” He couldn’t help but ask, Draco pausing to smile widely. He was still puffing up his chest quite a bit but he’d relaxed over the course of the conversation and the ice cream and so smiling didn’t look so forced on him anymore.

"You don't dress like muggles—or anybody really." They chimed in between themselves, and Harry was surprised about the sudden change in topic. Especially from the twins, who were the first to totally and entirely accept his weird quirks without so much as an eyebrow or second glance other than appropriately appreciative. Not that they just didn’t comment or notice, they routinely complimented him if he had a new hair pin or band t-shirt they liked on, but other than that never really acknowledged his style choice. And everyone else either just thought he was weird and ignored it or were pureblood and assumed that was how muggles dressed.

And that Transfiguration book Draco had given him for Christmas last year that he wasn’t supposed to read out in public or have on him while at Hogwarts was a really interesting read.
I would tell that to his face if I weren’t sure he’d take it as a compliment.”
“Who is he? What happened to him?” He directed his questions at Axeclaw, very impressed with himself by how believable that sounded. Then again he really was feeling ill right then so sounding so desperate wasn’t that hard.

“You know, I think Harry was right about you.” He announced, in a rather disappointed tone that send a chill straight up the potion master’s spine.

Maybe this would be okay.

Even more so, because this Liliana Slytherin was written in pitch black, bolded ink, and not a drop of color anywhere to be seen.
take a wild guess and say it was probably related to Harry not getting away with it in some way. He sure as hell had not been acting like himself this summer nor in this talk in the alley today, so for some reason he wasn’t being allowed to be who he wanted to be or do what he wanted to do, and that was probably crushing him slowly.
, even from each other, but how much that had to hurt.
Harry couldn’t even begin to process that statement on top of everything else, so he shelved it.
Some would say it was almost like gloating, sitting with the house he’d just beaten as if shoving it in their faces. The Slytherin table was willing to give him this one though, because

Which, they did. Or, Harry did and Neville automatically copied although he looked blatantly nervous at what was about to happen.
What was weird was that he'd been pretty sure they weren't muggleborns--not that he would reject them if they weren't, but it was curious as to why they were interested in a muggle game then. Well, power to them for broadening their horizons, even if just to watch a bit.

He couldn’t erase a lifetime of prejudice in a couple weeks after all, not within himself and not in the wider school, definitely not in the upper years who’ve had quite a while to get entrenched in their ways. So, how to get on the lions’ good side?
He wandered deep into the vault in awe, his head on a swivel as he tried to take this all in.

Honestly, he had no idea what to make of this and he really didn’t want to get caught in the middle for any reason. This was uncharted territory for everyone and the one thing Slytherins didn’t like is the
academic things that would be hard to get through, but they were solid. A quick conversation with her, which Bethany was almost more than happy to have, and you could even get some tips on the particular chapters that would be most helpful if you were preparing specifically for the OWLs someday. She literally had them all memorized so it was actually insanely helpful if you could make it through the extremely rambling, rather academic-heavy conversations with her.
“How did you figure out the ward was there? Is there any way to remove it or alter it so I know where the letters are being sent now?”
Draco paused, his unnaturally symmetrical face frowning and still somehow looking graceful while he did it. "I don't know anything about the Muggle world," He said boldly, like it was something to be proud of; like also asking why he would have ever bothered to learn such a thing. Harry mentally rolled his eyes, but he always did like a challenge, and
“Debatable,” Harry immediately snarked back, before suddenly remembering his next summer plans and grimaced. “As it is I

Harry had no idea what was going on, but he did know this man would be only too happy to kill him. All logic and reasoning and motives aside, whether they made sense or not, Harry just shoved it all aside and kept his guard up. He had to figure out a way out of here, but even standing and free to look around the room, he saw no exit. The door he did see was wreathed in fire, and he instinctively knew not to touch the flame as it was absolutely not normal.
He didn’t know what expression he was wearing, but he suddenly realized Mr. Malfoy was smirking at him and he immediately dropped his attention back to the table where his family tree was written—or at least pretended to.

and it wasn’t one of Wood’s early Saturday morning practices, or even to attend the teams try outs in a couple weeks.
“Interesting time?” Was all Theo asked about it as they went.
He ground his teeth together but chose his words carefully anyway. “I didn’t know about the magical world before my letter because they hated it so much. So, when I went to Hogwarts it was kind of… ‘if I don’t talk about it, they won’t acknowledge it’, kind of thing. Only… when I got back this summer there was an… incident.”
“I mean he

“Um… Harry?” Neville mumbled nervously.
“He said he was trying to get in contact with me, though I wouldn’t know why. McGonagall can, so if it’s from Hogwarts then she could do it.” He tried to act clueless but she either she didn’t buy it or didn’t care, she just pressed a little harder.

“I understand.” He swore seriously, sensing how serious she herself was about this.
There was a third group though, which was where the likes of Hannah and others seemed to fall. They seemed hesitant to approach him, but once they did and he confirmed the rumor for them, they seemed to just gape a bit with wide eyes.
for what felt like the fortieth time this semester alone. There had to be a limit to how many times he could get properly riled up and distressed over the same old thing, but as of yet he didn’t know if he was even close to that limit. He could spend the next six and a half years of this boy’s tenure at Hogwarts routinely draining his liquor stash like clockwork in some horrific, endless cycle.
“Woah, what kind of spell is that?” Seamus perked up.
as Draco had advised was far easier said than done, especially coming from a spoiled boy whose parents loved him and had a vulturous bat as a godfather secretly tutoring him. There was the academic route, in which he could ‘change his mind’ and want to start publishing his Transfiguration work early, so he could get McGonagall to get him in contact with a publisher or editor of sorts. They might be interested in their client being emancipated, or at least be a willing go-between to a barrister…
reputation is the one that would take a hit—everyone knew Professor Snape was a strict old bat and that he was always more likely to say no than anything else, but if Draco went to Gryffindor for his help, that most certainly wouldn’t help his reputation amongst fellow snakes.
But he didn’t, because he thought he could get lost in the rhythmic routine of doing the same chores every day and if he got into the habit of just doing it all without complaint or reaction, it would be easier.
He wanted it again more than he’d ever wanted anything; wanted it like hunger and thirst and sleep.
Besides, Neville looked a little green around the gills at the prospect, so chatting with him to get his mind off their oncoming class what probably a better use of time than wondering how he was to fix a hundreds-year-old rivalry as an eleven-year-old. He was probably going to have

Her expression became neutral once more, and he wondered if she’d learned schooling your expression from him, or he’d perfected it by mimicking her.

“Don’t be thick Draco, of course we were.” She sniffed delicately. “I’m asking what you planned to do about it.”
Severus had gotten too close to the Dark when he was learning to balance between the two sides of the war and scared off his first love because of it—another red haired beauty with a Light personality who'd captivated a Grey soul and the mother of the boy Draco was now mesmerized by. Looking back at it now he wondered how he didn't notice Lily Evans' child standing in front of him before, but now that he knew he couldn't un-see a red-headed child rejecting a young Severus Snape because of his connections to the Dark. It had broken the young potions master and Severus had never recovered, especially since she died before they could ever reconcile. Not that they ever would've, as she'd gone and married someone more suited for the Light, and Severus' arch enemy at that.
“May I? I’m quite partial to sweets.” The headmaster asked, and while Harry thought it kind of weird and rude, even he couldn’t eat all those sweets so he just shrugged. He watched the wizened man pluck a jelly bean from a Bertie’s Box and hum to himself as he tasted it… “Ah. Earwax.”

"That's not comforting. You do realize you have a habit of naming harmless things ferocious names—like
pure of heart—or pure to what our hearts feel." He grinned widely with a light laugh of his own. "We kind of figured that's what you were going to say, which is why we asked. We could tell pretty quickly you were our kind of person and thought you might agree with our perspective."
“How far ahead are you reading to be able to know that, Draco?” Theo once again ignored them to turn back to the blond, who just shrugged.
Be it that his aunt and uncle ran up to them
They let his parents make the blunder and approved the will that way just so they could take the property the second they died. If they rejected Remus as his godfather because of what he was, they definitely knew he couldn’t inherit property and they’d done it anyway.
Harry realized too that Nott was already sitting at the table behind them, the seat next to him presumably where Blaise would’ve sat since they’d been assumed to partner up. Blaise looked at him and his pale blue eyes looked back, neither of them making much of an expression but something passing between them.
She raised one eyebrow pointedly.

“Stop that! No fighting—the Professor will be back any second now and you’ll be expelled before you even properly enter the building!” She scolded them, and Harry got the feeling she and McGonagall would get along famously.
But it was

“Yet? So there’s some interest?”
Her breath froze in his lungs, a fear she hadn’t felt in
Muggle logic of what cost what seemed to entirely fail in this world. For example a book at a normal Barnes & Noble could be 20-25 pounds, which would get you two, maybe three meals depending on what you ate if you were to eat out with that money instead. 10 kilos of candy could easily rake up to be in the 100 pounds area, and a quarter tone of paper was closer to 400 pounds. Those items weren’t equal in the Muggle world but could all be bought with one gold coin in this wizarding world… Harry was going to have to re-learn how to buy things because this just made no sense at all to him.
She’d had

“Congratulations again then, I look forward to beating you.”
as well had seemed like a sketchy idea, but it had also been the perfect cover. A large, slightly shaking crate making rattling, scratching sounds and smoking slightly was suspicious as hell, but luckily Hagrid had managed to stick to their cover story when Professor Sprout had seen him entering the Great Hall with it and asked what it was.
Draco shifted a bit under his expectant stare, clearing his throat in the only show of discomfort he was willing to show, otherwise keeping his chin up and face blank in a truly impressive regal mask. It was even more impressive given how most of the Gryffindor table was boring holes into him with their eyes—those closes to where Harry was having this confrontation falling quiet to eavesdrop shamelessly.
“But Gran gave it to me…” Neville mumbled slowly, fidgeting with the ball in his hands, his shoulders slumped. “She’s kinda scary but she means well… and she never actually gives presents other than birthday and holidays.”
Draco simply nodded once.
Failure
He admitted.
. In fact, the goblins charged a galleon fee for this service any time he used it, which would’ve been outrageous for a normal credit card except that Harry was intending to go on a big spending spree in only two or three shops—three galleons was a fine price for not having lug around muggle money possibly until he could get back to Gringotts and transfer it back. He didn’t need it at the Dursleys (

of all people, they'd likely just be killed outright, or worse, punished for it. They won't tell me I can't be friends with you and they won't abandon me, so the most logical choice is to become a predominantly light-sided family with a dark cover so that they would be more protected from him if the dark lord returns. Playing both sides only works if there's a level of trust on those sides, after all."
“Well you’ve
Harry opened his eyes, automatic despite no alarm and the early hour, and instantly felt disappointed.
He thinks to himself, and it’s not a bad idea. He planned to be friends with Draco no matter what house he was put in, but to actually
First years were given whatever rooms were available, but once settled this would be their space for the full seven years, so they were actually only four levels down since this was where last year's seventh years had left open, but Draco knew there were deeper levels closer to the lake floor that other years must've had. He kind of liked being mid-way because it was a nice view, and he didn't have to crane around a tall bush of seaweed to see out, nor was the sunlight threatening his area like it'd be closer to the surface.

After one last moment to gather himself he released the hug and stood back to offer Draco his most earnest smile, and was thankful when Draco seemed to accept it with a smile of his own. Seeming to remember his manners a bit too late, Harry looked at the Malfoy parents accompanying their son and flashed them a much more manufactured, but probably more convincing smile of politeness.

“…Mom?”
There was just… so
about both sports to be able to contribute, but quickly got outshone when he realized he was definitely not nearly as much as a diehard fan as they both were. Magic was still new enough to him that he was mostly interested in the prospect of quidditch: flying seemed like the most fantastic thing about the wizarding world so far, and just a little prompting got him promises from both of them that first years would have flying lessons eventually to see if they had any skill or passion for it.
He intoned clearly, and Harry jumped a bit as a huge black snake spun to life as if thread had materialized and wrapped around itself until suddenly it was a living, wriggling, breathing snake hissing wildly around at them in shock at its sudden existence.
“I can only imagine the din in Gryffindor’s dorm; perish the thought.” Blaise sniffed in distaste.
"Severus."
That seemed like it should’ve hurt a lot, getting slammed into the ground like that…
compare me to your mother,”
When Lily had been sorted, she'd looked back at him with an identical look that her son had just given his godson. Apologetic, comforting, encouraging, hopeful. Hopeful that despite being in warring houses they could still be friends.
Harry was more amused than anything as Draco pinched the bridge of his nose. Apparently this was not new and suddenly Harry had a better excuse as to why he’d been avoiding the Slytherin table than just his coping mechanisms. Even the most skeptical of snakes would have to concede him wanting to avoid Blaise’s complaining was probably justified.
Minerva felt her heart break, at least a little. At the same moment she was… oddly
Still, for the first day after the news had spread through the Hogwarts rumor mill, things had gone pretty smoothly if he did say so himself.
Only it didn’t burn, it felt slick and too hot.
“Underhanded popcorn.” Neville deadpanned, and Harry was so taken off guard by the abrupt shift in humor he deteriorated in breathless laughter.
“Oh sh-” Harry took off without even thinking, panicking and suddenly it felt like adrenaline made everything clear and he pressed forward to urge his broom faster and

she was going to give him an earful in the next life.
That was the only thing to be thankful about, because from how his whole body was numb and too hot, he realized this was probably it. He was already dead—the damage done from the blood loss and that hit were enough to kill him if someone didn’t find him soon, because from how his limbs were not responding he’d broken a lot of things and was not going to be able to fight back successfully even if he managed to summon the energy to try. Somehow his mind was cold and clinical as it reminded him how close the troll had come to killing him—this was stunningly
And he even struck up a conversation, which frankly made Harry’s day.
His wand he kept on him, at Hagrid’s instruction. The giant man’s reluctance to let go of the tiny pink umbrella he carried around with him despite technically having had his wand snapped for an undetermined reason years ago told Harry that if even Hagrid was disobeying orders to follow this rule, it was a rule worth following even at risk of what the Dursleys would do if they caught him. He’d leave it under the floorboards when he left the shed, but for now he’d get used to having it one him.
what it was, I could’ve sworn it was a bludger.” Harry snapped his fingers as if in realization, earning laughs from the Gryffindors present at least. Draco rolled his eyes and tapped on his notes even more urgently.
Harry made a show of tapping his chin trying to think, before he realized that he actually had no idea. Dean had nothing he wanted and maybe he was hanging out with the Slytherins too much, but something about that struck him as odd.
the one wearing it then,” Harry stuck his tongue out, and Draco rolled his eyes that time. His smile dropped and a more serious look adopting his features. "You said hand-me-downs…to be honest my parents were a little surprised to hear Hagrid say 'nasty muggles', when we met in the Alley you know. That's something a pureblood family, or even my parents before their new leaf would say. From your letters it doesn't sound like you like them at all…" He left the question hanging there and Harry felt his own smile slowly drop.
"I…" Harry was

As always.
“It means you have parents who love you, and who would protect you.” Harry snapped, something he’d almost forgotten bubbling up even though he knew it shouldn’t—not now. He hadn’t had real temper issues in months, and while the warmth that went to the very tips of his fingers as it flared back was familiar and
“What?” Draco seemed genuinely taken aback by his words, and Harry felt bad for even bringing it up.
Thankfully his dethroning of Montague had rattled Slytherin enough to pause a bit more when Harry was in the vicinity, regardless of what Flint was up to. They had to walk a fine line of course, but the less fights that got started the less grudges got started too—and long term that was a good thing.

It was only a little before two when he made it out into muggle London and traveled down several streets towards where Tom-the-toothless-bartender had pointed him: to a shopping district. His last order of business at Gringotts was to get a goblin equivalent of a debit card connected to the donation vault that would work in the muggle world—he wasn’t allowed to have one on his trust vault and the Monroe account had limited withdrawals for money until he was 17, and he didn’t want to take a boat load of money from his trust and change it all into physical muggle money that he may or may not use up.

Draco was actually a lot more fun, compared to last year where he’d shopped on his own following the advice he’d been given via letters. Now that he actually had a year of magical education under his belt to know generally what he needed and Draco beside him to discuss the pros and cons of some things versus others, the process was a lot more enjoyable, like they were actually hanging out instead of doing errands.

When he'd followed them into their chosen room that first night, Blaise had given him a pointedly raised eyebrow but didn't comment. Nott didn't even look at him but set about putting his things away, ignoring both his roommates with an impressive amount of calculated apathy. Nott in general was a little out of place as being from a dark family yet bunking with two now-grey families. One would think he'd choose the other room with two known dark heirs to be with his own alliance, so to speak, or at the very least in a quieter room as he seemed entirely withdrawn into himself and unwilling to speak to either of them and at least Crabbe and Goyle aren't talkers like he and Blaise were. Somehow though, he was here, and he kept to himself mostly, ignoring his roommates even as Draco found himself talking to Blaise more and more.
in the coming year.
“Oh yeah, and I also have a delivery for you from Greengrass. Do I want to know?” He didn’t sound amused as he slipped a simple envelope from his robe and passed it to him as they walked, and Harry, knowing immediately what it was, instantly slipped it into his bottomless bag for safe keeping, seeing the curious spark in Blaise’s eye.
Not to mention complicated.
It wasn’t until he hit the hard, yet somehow soft earth of the back yard and got a face full of bright green grass that he gathered some awareness, again the adrenaline filling in the gaps in his senses and putting things into clarity. Not the crystal clear vision he usually got when his heart started beating this fast, but awareness just enough not to be blind and deaf—which spoke to the state he was in right now.
This…
He realized, sitting up and pressing his palms flat to the cold, living ground beneath him as the world came in and out of focus for a nauseating second.

He hid it well though and once they’d gotten free of the annoying creature he’d bounced back, but Harry had noticed.

Mother says it’s because transfiguration can be dangerous when you’re learning it so she takes no nonsense, but Father thinks she’s just got a stick up her bum. Which, coming from my father means more than you think it would.”
He felt more open to talking when no one was pestering him about it, and despite his calm, cool, and collected act, Theo had been the one who’d almost fainted when he’d first spoken to the mantle snakes. Blaise was the one he was doing business with, but he knew Theo wanted an answer almost as bad. He was either just too respectful to pester him by asking, or he knew he had nothing to trade for that information and wasn’t even going to embarrass himself by trying.

He broke out of his thoughts to see Neville fully turned to face him now with concern, letter abandoned and he wondered what kind of expression he’d been wearing to earn that kind of reaction.

“While I think that’d be interesting, Pomfrey might throw a fit.” He grinned, and Neville nodded a bit too seriously.

At face value Harry might’ve called her out on changing the deal after it was made—she herself made a huge stink about not doing that from the start.
He walked in and a bell at the door alerted his entrance, and a man looked up from where he was writing something at a desk near the back. The shop consisted of plain tan walls and tiled floors, a long row of spinning black chairs on metal stands lined up on one wall and very muggle-looking eye charts on the other. It kind of gave a hair-dresser like vibe actually.

To be condemned to the island was an eternal sentence, and the sheer vastness of the mass graves beneath it’s foundation made for one of the most terrifying inferi pits in existence. Because you never walked free—people banished you to this isle and promptly forgot about you for good, ensuring that one day you would simply be part of the bones buried here and nothing more.

more for this than he was last year. Last year it hadn’t been so critical, so while he might’ve hesitated in doing bigger deals with the Grey than simple class notes, now he suddenly had a lot less hesitation, and what he thought might’ve been too expensive before suddenly seemed like a fair deal in comparison to the alternative.
The redhead blinked, taken a bit off guard at the sudden question. He
“Sissy?” She almost didn’t hear it, his voice all but broken from disuse—or many years of screaming and a damp, drafty cell slowly tearing away at it. But heard it she did, and yes… that was definitely him. He might’ve looked surprised even but he was visibly exhausted and beaten, and there was so little left of his face there probably wasn’t much there to form real expression anymore.
Harry just maturely stuck his tongue out at him before deciding to take a shot at the last remaining member of their breakfast group. “And how about you Nott? Any exciting plans for today?”
“Potter that’s just… how the
He had been the only person to enter this place in all his living memory so he knew he was generally safe here, but it’d be over before it started if Dudley got curious as to why he was in here if he so happened to spot him coming and going. Petunia would likely give her husband and son some reason like that he was getting to big for the cupboard and now he was out of the house for good, and probably make it very, very clear that Dudley was to never come in here lest he’d learn of that pesky thing she hated called ‘magic’.

He had no desire to see her suffer though either, hence the candy and the exploding snap plan. But he’d need some kind of plan to help her in a way that he knew he couldn’t be there for her, like setting her up with someone who’d enjoy her presence for who she was a bit more than Harry knew himself capable of. But he was scratching his head at the moment, making a mental note to befriend more Ravenclaws to see if he could find anyone. Maybe Lu could help, but
There was not a stray piece of paper in this entire place, zero bookshelves or excess banners or anything like that. There weren’t even curtains on the windows, just huge vaulted glass panes making up the wall that revealed, not the grounds, but the murky green of just beneath the surface of the Great Lake. Which was super cool in its own way, as a huge field of seaweed stretched out several dozen meters below the bay window seats with tasteful black cushions that which a very tempting studying spot.

That seemed like a poor idea when he could easily think of about five dozen things that could go wrong with that plan just off the top of his head.

after all and Transfiguration was just a means to an end. "To be totally honest I was trying to get on her good side—it was like a personal challenge. I didn't think that much of Transfiguration, but it seemed simple enough."
He resigned himself to this extremely awkward meeting. By the letter hidden in his robe pocket, he’d already kind of prepared what he was going to do in any case, might as well grit his teeth and just do it.
“Thank you sir.” Was all he said though, grabbing his trunk and following obediently, though he got super curious when Mr. Malfoy attempted to go back to the barrier. He couldn’t even wonder fully before the man touched the wall, and legitimate surprise flickered across his regal features. “Ah… doesn’t it close after the train leaves?” Harry asked curiously because he couldn’t help himself despite the awkward situation.
“We have people of all skill levels you know; it might be fun. Our next practice is in two weeks, right Lu?” He asked with almost clinical politeness towards the Ravenclaw, who nodded once with a look on his face that said he was agreeing with Neville right now. “You should come.” Harry offered the olive branch to Ron, who looked a bit surprised Harry had actually done that.
“Oh. Well… okay then, so long as you already know.” He shrugged, gesturing for him to continue.

Very quickly he managed to determine he was on a stone floor that still felt like Hogwarts although the room specifically was absolutely foreign. Fire burned in a ring around the room, and he saw no clear exits—not that he could get past the fire which burned so heartily it was probably magical and also likely a stupid idea to try and touch. For the contents in the room, most pertinently he sensed the presence of another person behind him almost immediately, but before he moved to give himself away he spared a second or two to observe the only other object in the room in front of him.

Harry slumped a bit in defeat, finally just giving in. If Dumbledore wanted to see him as some famous celebrity, then he could do that. Just like with Snape—if he knew how

“Minerva!”
“That you do. And also, I hope you don’t mind but I shared it with Professor Vector as well, so that she could double check the calculations for me. I was fairly certain of it myself, but having another pair of eyes on something so delicate is always a good tactic.”
“Of course, simply write to me with the name of the person who is to be added into the ward. Cost of an alteration to the ward is two sickles.”
He simply reacted when Quirrell obeyed some command and lurched forward, despite the fact he would not be able to breathe again.
“I know, Blaise misses me already. Tell him not to worry, I’ll be back to bother him in no time.”
He wondered, as he sat up with utter dread and dragged himself over to where he kept his ‘Dursley approved’ clothes in a basket—meaning Dudley’s filthy hand-me-downs. It was still too early for there to be much light to navigate by, but the clothes were ugly as a rule and he didn’t care to dress up for his relatives so it hardly matter what he pulled on anyway.

what he needed though, and took his third grocery-store purchase—thumb tacks—to cut and then pin two sheets of the large fabric to the floor, along the wall, and to the rafter crossbeam marking the start of ‘his’ area. He doubled up the fabric for further security just in case and because he had the extra material and thumb tacks, and by the end of it the two sheets overlapped in the middle directly behind the workbench blocking the entrance, but was a stretchy enough material that he could slip through carefully and cross between “rooms”.
“What are you playing at?” He demanded. The unspoken

“There’s probably more to say, honestly. They too, were aligned with the Malfoys before the start of this year and got called off—their parents are dark but I really wouldn’t worry too much about them. They do as they’re told and Draco’s told them to keep to themselves, which they have pretty well so far.” She leaned back, stretching a bit as she continued distractedly.

Wizards were gossip whores and prejudiced, traditional and gullible.
He scowled to himself, before quickly clearing his expression. He turned like nothing had happened and shoved it through the slot on his cupboard as he passed by its door without missing a step, returning to the kitchen and placing the mail in his uncle’s open hand as he bypassed the table and quickly resumed tending the cooking breakfast before someone got impatient. Given that Dudley was already at the table, he had able two minutes before he started complaining—maybe less really—and he wanted them on their good sides for the time being.

that bit of information was. Like the fact it was a piece of gossip seemed really out of place in amongst all the other earth-shattering emotions he had rocking through him right now that he was too stunned to even feel properly.

Also can I say I was startled and amused how those who routinely comment (thank you, love you all <3) seemed to switch on a dime and all wanted the Dursleys and Dobby dead after these past chapters? Because that was hilarious. But 12-year-old Harry, despite being messed up and traumatized from already killing someone sort-of-accidentally, is not a murderer at heart. Yet.

the wizarding world more than he did at this moment.
“Right.” He sighed, trying not to let his disappointment show too much. Draco had done him a favor, after all.
“Do you wish me to explain anything else?” Axeclaw prompted, probably hoping to distract him so he didn’t have a crying wizard in his office. For a goblin that could only really snarl, he certainly sounded awkward enough.
things Draco was glossing over quickly. It was rather amusing.
“Um… well, as you can probably imagine, Draco kind of… uh-”
It was totally furious and literally spitting mad, huge fangs bared in indignant rage at apparently being woken up. Looking closely though Harry saw its deep black scales had a very distinct blue shine to the light that he actually found incredibly beautiful.
"Have you
“That’s not proven yet!”
Still, he did not complain as eventually he found he liked pretty much having free reign of the kitchen, it easily becoming his safe place even from his relatives. Apparently, he was a good cook and two of the three loved to eat, so while their verbal abuse and the whacks on the back of his head were frequent and harsh, they kept him relatively uninjured so that he could keep working in the kitchen. If that was in any way related to his quickly growing skills at whipping up

the temper though. Gryffindor loves that you punched a Malfoy and the Slytherins are in hysterics that Weasley still has a lump on his head--they say Pomfrey said they should have their bruises healed on their own since it wasn't induced by magic, they’re relatively harmless aside from being a bit sore, and they deserved it for acting like children." Seamus explained cheerily—far too cheerily, in Harry’s opinion.
Make the cut, move on.
Not that Harry hadn’t fully instigated that confrontation, but so far as anyone could prove he’d been nothing but friendly.
He smiled at that.
“They’re not actually textbooks, not really. They’re his autobiographies of sorts, tales of his adventures if you actually believe any of it happened. Which, according to my father, most likely did not.”

But the thing was… the twins were very, very good at quidditch, mainly because their positions were all but designed for them. Beaters were a team within a team, and when you could practically read someone's mind then that team was a very, very good one.
… it was kind of old-lady-ish so I transfigured it a bit." Dumbledore choked again, this time on a piece of toast and Harry only paused a respectful amount of time to watch the teachers make sure their headmaster was still alive before getting bored with the rest of the students and continued the conversation. "I think the enchantments are the important part and seriously I never met the man but I don't think my dad had much style. I'm pretty sure he'd forgive me fixing it up a bit so I'd actually wear his gift."
It didn’t actually touch me, magically or otherwise.” Harry assured him, gripping his own rock cake a little harder. “It didn’t look like it even had a wand.”
His mother sighed, not in an annoyed way but a very put-upon type way. “Clearly we’ve failed you as parents if you’ve entirely overlooked every warning sign that boy just gave you. You’ll need to work on that if you want to make it farther as a Slytherin, dear.” She chided, and Draco frowned as he thought that over.
, it was like trying to lie to Snape but
“Lead the way,” Harry chimed in with a subdued tone, Sprout flashing him a reassuring grin which he accepted with his own show of warmth that at this point, Blaise had no idea if he could believe or not.
He was carefully saving his calming droughts so he hadn’t taken one that morning as they got onto the train for home. They would only last a couple weeks before their stasis charms wore off so it was kind of a use-them-or-lose-them situation but he knew he would definitely need them more with his relatives than on a train with his friends. The unfortunate result though was that he
Harry thought that was very nice of him, but probably a useless attempt.
“Except for my mother apparently who probably never took one. Or four.” Harry admitted.
Given the work outs Wood usually had lined up, in this state Harry feared he might legitimately might pass out rather than complete one of his captain’s regimes.
But it also meant Longsgate was probably unattended, and empty. And full of dangerous creatures of course but… that was good information to have. He didn’t know what he’d do with it, but he liked it a lot.
They didn’t
“Alright. I can do that.” He promised, and be it Draco seeing how eager he was to move on from this for a moment or not, he scoffed loudly—but his eyes glinted a bit.
By the time the new semester started, Harry had achieved three things.
Harry mentally sighed and switched tactics. “Do you have a television?” At the blank look he received he nodded once. “Well muggles have this thing called a television that they use for entertainment. What does the magical world do for fun then if they have no electricity and no television?”
It had startled him to turn a page in the latest journal he was reading through and see handwriting that clearly wasn’t Dell’s in the pages that clearly she kept very close to her throughout her life. From what he’d gathered of this William character, he wasn’t unlike Percy Weasley in how uptight he was

The only thought that really came to him was this strange curiosity at why the reaction had been so… well,
Dudley of course had a royal meltdown and Harry took the brunt of it, but he was for once on Petunia’s side in that he most certainly did not want Dudley messing with anything in that shed so he’d held firm despite a lot of cheap shots to his kidneys and things thrown at him that he then had to clean up when they broke. Petunia never gave either, which Harry was honestly surprised by; he must have really underestimated how much she hated magic. Either way, Dudley sulked up a royal storm

Ron stumbled back, not being prepared for Harry to whip around fast as lightning, and surprising both of them his hand found perfect purchase on the offender’s cheek to leave a sharp red mark. Rob grabbed at it in shock and whatever cry of indignation almost made it out of his mouth was drowned out by Harry advancing on him with vigor.

have helped settle him. He was a transfiguration prodigy, he came to accept this at some point of this prison sentence, and if he embraced that thought then he would use it to become stronger than he was now. He took so many notes and buffed out so many equations for potential new spells he’d lost count and used up several of the journals he’d been saving for next year, and even developed a plan.
“Yeah, I’m not interested in more fame. I’m totally fine keeping it just between you and I if that’s what you’re saying.” He perked up cheerily. “I know I need to be a better writer before doing anything official, anyway.”
He didn’t even have time
“Can I help you?”
And so… it was with an exceedingly heavy, yet proud heart that she rested a hand over the leaflet of papers she’d been given, and pondered what was in it.
The twins exchanged looks, realizing at once that they didn’t know.

“Yeah, pretty boring. Back to the muggle world after a year at Hogwarts was dull—I even did my homework and read ahead I was so bored!” Dean complained and Seamus laughed at him while Harry took notes that that was a very generic, believable thing to say, especially to purebloods who were predisposed to think muggles a bit dull no matter if they were Slytherins or not. People knew he was back with muggles and if Susan had been spreading the fact his wards were blocked to people it’d be even more believable.

The goblin paused, eyes narrowing. “Gringotts doesn’t make such mistakes. The statements were sent out.” His tone was ice cold and Harry realized his misstep.
“I mean he’s still going to be that captain, but I see your point.” Harry smirked.
Still, he had a

The same could not be said for Draco or Neville, who would be happy to help but would
Even an impossible enemy you understood was better than one you had no information on, so Draco was going to shut him mouth and watch for now until these two found some kind of agreement in how to proceed from here on out.
Seamus and a Ravenclaw muggleborn who'd seen their sign in the Great Hall and literally jumped from the Ravenclaw table to join them as soon as he saw them hanging it up on the door were only a couple seconds behind him but still too late and panting heavily as they came to a stop behind the smugly grinning red head.
“No way—I mean maybe if it’d gone like that, but I probably would’ve told Professor McGonagall too because she’d rip through a troll rather than let a Gryffindor get squished and I know like two spells.” He admitted, Madam Pomfrey’s eyebrows shooting up to her hairline at this confession. “But like no, Neville told me Hermione was crying in the girl’s bathroom because Ron was being a prick earlier so I brought her candy and was trying to get her to cheer up and then I turn around
The ones he wasn’t sure about were all the new ones on his hands. They were a solid pink, but seemingly to be fully healed. House elf magic seemed different than wizard magic, as Pomfrey could be more delicate when healing cuts than Dobby had been, but his understanding was that Pomfrey had taken longer. Dobby healed them with a snap, but it seemed they’d frozen as they were—gaping cuts had frozen over with a scar, so now that otherwise thin line it might’ve been even with muggle stitches was stuck as a semi- wide wedge cut from his skin since they hadn’t been treated otherwise before instantaneously healing.
She had a feeling this would be quite interesting.
So no… others might worry their master didn’t trust them for not revealing himself, but Severus was fairly certain he could get away with not only not recognizing it
“That’s right!” Harry agreed eagerly. “We all kind of know where our skill levels are and who we work well with, so I think if we just pick teams amongst ourselves it should work out fine. I don’t want to do team captains or anything as even that sounds like too much pressure.”
I don’t want to get snacks, I’m frankly not that hungry, but I
“That’s good. I was worried she had a blibbering humdinger bothering her.” Luna broke into his thoughts, and he looked over to see she was observing the same situation below them as Harry was.
If he could’ve possibly felt more unnerved and scared, he would’ve felt it seeing that damn freaking mirror. As it was, he couldn’t actually
He hadn’t given his parents much thought at all, to be honest. The lack of parents was an obstacle, the Dursleys were an enemy, and his missing godfather was a problem he would have to figure out.
"But your parents were wizards." Mrs. Malfoy cut off his wandering thoughts. Harry was not sure what being a pureblood was so important, but it was definitely important apparently. He shelved it, making a note to ask Draco later and get a

“So someone jinxed my broom. There were dozens of teachers in the stands, Dumbledore too, and all of Gryffindor would lose the game willingly then let me fall to my death. I trust the twins with my life especially, so while yes someone did something, I was not going to get hurt from it, Draco.”

Since clearly every Gryffindor around them was eavesdropping on this situation without even trying to be subtle, he enjoyed the way the twins almost choked on their food before sinking below the table to dissolve into giggles. Draco’s ears turned a soft pink, which had been Harry’s goal, but unfortunately he was too used to the teasing to be dissuaded from his mission.

I've never met them so how am I supposed to know if they were Gryffindor-ish or not?" He shrugged a bit helplessly, and only partially for show. "And besides, Draco is my friend and he was always going to be in Slytherin—you saw the hat take all of not-even-a-second to sort him." Cue eyes roll at Draco puffing his chest up smugly. He put a finger to his chin playfully and glanced up at the enchanted ceiling as if a thought were occurring to him. "Ah, but when I said I wanted to be with my friend the hat called me a Hufflepuff and sorted me into Gryffindor instead. It was rather rude, to be honest."

It was a bit belatedly as the names continued to branch at a slightly slower pace now, that he realized not all names were the same. Or, they weren’t being written in the same ink: some were so heavy handed they were almost too bold to properly read, others were so faded he could just barely make out what it was trying to say. His own name and several close by him were in clear pitch black, while most of the tree now that it was becoming more of a tree in fact, was written in dozens of different colors. Not only that, but each name had this little halo of color around it as if it were glowing, and the shimmering in it made him think if they turned the lights off, they really would start shining.

He wrapped his hands into his hair again and fought the urge to pull until his scalp bleed.
Tonight was not about Draco then, as his godson had bid him a good night and retreated instead of inviting him to the library or some other excuse to get away from his parents and talk potions. Lucius invited him for a night cap and as his glass was filled with 500 year scotch, Severus knew this was going to be a pivotal conversation—his old friend didn’t break out the good stuff for less than world dignitaries he was trying to win over, and Severus knew he himself did not make the cut. Which meant whatever he wanted from him, it was going to be bad.

He’d done it before, and it left a bitter taste in Narcissa’s mouth in particular as it’d been her family who’d suffered the most for his damned light-sided machinations.

Draco didn’t even bother that with a response, shoving past his roommate and towards his area of the room the second they got back to their dorm.

They continued to chat lightly about inconsequential things, and while the table in general was uncomfortable and slightly too tense to ignore, no one else said a thing about Harry’s presence for the rest of the meal.

So he slid a bit closer where they sat beside each other on the steps and hugged his friend again, burying himself into Draco’s neck and although the Slytherin startled at the sudden change, he automatically hugged him back anyway. Thankfully they were out of sight from most of the rest of the alley, because Harry wasn’t going to let go so quickly this time.

It made him feel hot and itchy and generally uncomfortable to be the center of all this…
bad at being a Slytherin that he needed to actively stoop to that level.
“That’s fine.” He agreed easily. “I can’t tell exactly how long it’ll take to find what we’re looking for.”
“I frankly don’t care who started it.” Harry replied in the same feigning polite tone Blaise had, and the tall Slytherin smirked down at him as he checked their potion’s consistency.
He did not answer her.
“Then how do wizards? For the cores of wands and such?”
“We cannot confirm nor deny that having easier access to you and your knowledge of Transfiguration may or may not be a solid reason for inviting you in the first place, so yeah you’ll likely be brought back.” Blaise smirked, and Harry flashed him a grin.

Draco looked furious, but Harry just loosened his grip on his wrist and used it to nudge him slightly.
Which was Zabini.
"Aw, I knew you loved me Blaise." Harry rolled his eyes, and Draco scoffed under his breath while Blaise grinned a bit maniacally. It was a startling expression on the previously composed Slytherin boy.

Draco, on the other hand, had gotten him a rather large, beautifully adorned book on Transfiguration that Harry got a feeling was not available in Hogwarts library considering the many warnings on the front page, and it just sent a thrill of excitement through him as the prospect of getting into this one.

"Uh… yeah. Thank you," Harry smiled in a daze, too shocked that…

He folded the letter back over so his response was on the inside and wrapped it in spare notebook paper, pinning it down with the wax seal he’d picked off the original letter and applying enough pressure that it stuck well enough and wrote “
I meet, not their reputations. That's how I became friends with you, and I hope to make many more friends this way as well, Draco. I'd hope you wouldn't try and sway me one way or the other, or judge me for liking people because of who they are and not their family name."
buy a ticket just in case for some reason he had to take the cloak off and got questioned, but as no one even knew he was there to ask to see it and no one bumped into him on accident, he wasn’t bothered once. In fact, he took a heavy nap and woke when he was almost there, which was awesome even if it did make him feel more tired and groggy than before if that was possible.

If it was personal… if it
He was terrified that Draco
"Well the next store is a bookshop and the one after sells ice cream. Books are boring and we don't have much time so how about some of that?"
Harry couldn’t really comprehend it either, but his body was moving before his mind even considered being confused about it or think longer than it took to recognize the monster
And well, this exercise might be mostly for Colin than anyone as a figure rose up beside him and he glanced over to see Luna copying his side-saddle posture, bare feet crossed at the ankles and swaying easily in the open air, dreamily observing the ground below them from the space directly beside him. If he thought he was at ease in the air, she looked like she was just casually chilling on a cloud rather than a piece of wood.
engage with a Zabini.
Draco had clearly heard from Blaise already that he was alive, and being raised in a magical family probably had more faith in magical healing than Harry himself did, so he wasn’t
“What about diagnostic spells? Like, I’ve seen some of my Slytherin friends do diagnostic spells to check if their food is poisoned—even at Hogwarts. Could you make glasses that would show if something is poisoned or warded or something?”
Knowledge was power, but only if you could use it like a weapon. Friends could take you places, but so long as you kept them at arm’s length—kept close to cash in favors on or cut ties with depending on where the most favorable wind was going that day. Sometimes you needed to take a risk, but only if the reward was worth it.
And he could take vengeance on the poppies for their judgement, picking them with a neat slice of a magical silver blade he kept on hand for dealing with particularly bratty plants and putting them into a vase where they’d wilt slowly over time in enchanted water. Their bright, beautiful red would be a great gift for Harry in the hospital wing. He was fairly certain red was Harry’s favorite color… if he had something like that, as Harry seemed to like a lot of color, all at once.
seemed like a very Slytherin thing, and that statement in particular had sounded like some kind of saying of theirs that he just wasn’t aware of. He kind of liked it though, and shelved it for more thought later.
The room was circular and spacious enough that each little pie-slice had enough room for the four-poster bed, the trunk at the foot of it, a desk, and a decent albeit small wardrobe. Some areas had windows above the desks, other had solid walls; Neville had taken the bed beside his so their desks were side-by-side, and both of them had windows on either side of their beds. Seamus, an Irish boy he’d met briefly the night before, got one window and some wall, while Dean, another acquaintance, and Ron Weasley himself both had walls. Dean was fine with this arrangement as he apparently brought several posters that needed to be hung and he’d need the real estate, while Ron on the far side of the room had mentioned he liked to sleep and ‘

would be an awkward conversation to have if he couldn’t think of a subtle way of phrasing that request.
, and he’d already known he had to do that, he just hadn’t written it down so clearly.
“Remember that time you called Malfoy a sell-out, and told everyone he was an arrogant brat?” Harry reminded him kindly. And then… after a second or two to let that reminder sink in, he dropped his smile and mustered up the coldest, most pissed off look he could muster. “Don’t do it again. How’d that Transfiguration essay go for you?”
But he
No duh Harry Potter would be the Light champion and Dumbledore’s little play thing. He really was just a child with a big, frankly unearned reputation that most of the wizarding world would fall beneath, and if there was one thing Dumbledore didn’t like, it was competition. So it was painfully obvious that Potter, a reasonably normal eleven-year-old, would fall under the headmaster’s manipulations and that was that. No Slytherin thought that

He should’ve been focusing on them, on outmaneuvering them, but just avoiding them to survive wasn’t a good plan.
, from the unpleasant information he thought he had?
since the extent of his sports career seemed to have been exclusively on a broom where gravity didn't come into play, were at very real disadvantages against people like Harry and Dean, who'd been active in this kind of exercise consistently for a long while now. Given that their 'club' had about seven members at this point, Harry wasn't exactly sure he was
faster than he was expecting, and he understandably freaked out, just barely keeping it together to not have the librarian kick him out before he marched quickly and quietly to the back corner of the library where old slightly-outdated encyclopedias lived. It was a rare day anyone came back here, so he knew he had a bit of privacy for the moment.
Claustrophobia.
Introducing the two was logical, as Harry had always been very vocal about inter-house relationships, more so than any other student or even any
His hair was probably a bloody mess—he’d brushed it and tried to wash it with his water bottle the best he could, but he hadn’t had a real shower in over a
