His first real glimpse of Volchii in the dampened light of day is underwhelming. To call it a town is to use the word in its loosest sense. It’s an insignificant blip on a map that shrinks even smaller under the leering gaze of the mountaintops in the near distance. A single street is lined with small, paneled buildings whose colors have faded from years of salt and snow, despite the Shield Charms. The air is a strange mixture of crispness from the cold and stale brininess from the gulf.
Potter sets his fork down on his empty plate before explaining. “A couple years back, Ron and George were looking to expand their opportunities, but didn’t have the funds or warm bodies to open another shop. I just put them in contact with Fee. I don’t know anything about how they did it. Why? Does it bother you?”
“What are you on about?” Draco manages, dropping his hands bonelessly at his sides.
“Oh, I’m full of surprises, Potter. Herman and I are good friends now,” Draco quips. “Is there a reason you don’t keep the same charms over your own house?”
He tilts his head back and scrubs his hands over his face. “Best case scenario for heat is”—Draco glances at his notes through his hands—“eight hours. Phoenix feathers are six hours, high temperature. Birds that literally set themselves on fire still need six hours to heat; what could an icy pack of ghost wolves need?”
Still ignorant of its dramatic relocation, Draco’s body aches for a warm bed and a deep, dreamless sleep as he and Potter hike upwards through the dense forest behind Potter’s cabin. The sound of Potter’s heavy footsteps is intrusive in the eerie quiet of the woods, accompanied only by the occasional fluttering of wings.
“Yes, Rory,” Draco croaks. “I’m sure we’ll be friends before you know it.”
Despite the afternoon hour, the sun hangs low in the sky, casting long shadows behind the spindly trees. A gentle wind persuades the pines to unfold their sagging branches and release their snowy burdens to the earth. It would be much easier to Apparate to Potter’s home, but there’s a soothing quality to the lonesome walk, all muted footprints and nature hushed by a blanket of snow. Shielded in his myriad charms, Draco can clear his head without fear of the cold while delaying the inevitable a little while longer.
“Just beginning to? Really?”
“I am ridiculous. You should try it sometime,” Harry says with a grin. Draco can only roll his eyes. “Anyway… Maybe we’ll get to a blended core before you have to leave. I think you’d be good at them.”
“How could I forget? Nearly burned my face off,” Draco laments, somewhat mockingly. He turns to face Harry, finding him closer than expected.
Occasionally, the car pitches forward whenever Potter wrestles with a stick that protrudes from the floor between them. Compared to the plane, however, the ride is quite pleasant. They proceed wordlessly down a narrow, unlit road surrounded by trees on both sides. Unable to bear the uncomfortable silence, a question leaps from Draco’s lips.
In the welcoming warmth of Potter’s cabin, they kick their dripping boots off at the door and shed their extra layers. Potter drops his coat and scarf on the floor and summons a fire to the hearth while Draco hangs his jacket on the hooks behind the door. Feeling a bit like an intruder, Draco stands awkwardly in the living room as Potter turns on the television and ambles into the kitchen.
“So, you know about the properties of wood, and that’s important. But when you’re going to actually make a wand, you need to be able to pick a tree that’s willing and able to be used. You use diagnostic charms in Healing, right?”
Unfortunately, Potter chooses not to engage and says, “I don’t live in Seldovia. It’s just the closest place to land a plane. We’re going to Volchii.”
“We still have to work together, remember?” Draco reminds them, just as much for himself as for Potter.
four blankets. The wool is rough under his fingertips but warm. The lights are out, but the brightness of the nearly full moon casts a milky glow across the room. It highlights his bag on the desk, his wand on the bedside table. An icy breeze blows through the wide-open window; he must have left it open last night when he couldn’t sleep.
The irresistible enticement of rattling Potter vanishes, and Draco seethes with every malicious word that Potter spits at him. Draco is not supposed to be working under Harry Potter to complete his schooling. It’s not his fault that Sam Volkov is dead. The single advantage to studying on another continent was that no one here would know his name. They would know he was a student from Europe and form any subsequent judgments for themselves, untainted by the press or his teenaged decisions birthed from fear and ignorance.
“Why does it bother you so much?”
“Who said I’m wasting a question? Are you imposing a limit?”
Draco scoffs and shovels a potato into his mouth. It burns his tongue, provoking a prickle of tears, which Draco is quick to blink away.
Draco clenches his jaw. “No. I suppose not.”
at it. And don’t worry, your secret’s safe with me,” Harry says and wriggles his eyebrows. “I’ve got a few books on the process that lay out the different cores and wand materials, how the combination affects timing and whatever. I think it’s boring, but if you’re interested—”
Harry’s eyes are playful as he tosses his coat on the hook at the door and walks towards a cabinet. Though the shelves are littered with books, bottles, and stray sheets of parchment, Harry reaches for a corked, crimson bottle without ponderance or delay.
“Hm?”
“So, I quit. Made everyone mad. But every time I tried to say anything, or explain myself, it felt like they were just… smoothing me over.” Harry coasts his hand over an invisible current. “Ironing out the wrinkles until they saw what they wanted to see. Merlin forbid I
“And the eternal state of darkness?”
After half a dozen attempts, Draco still hasn’t
“Excuse me, I’m sorry. I must be mistaken. I’m, er—”
“No more dangerous than the Bloody Baron. For now,” Potter smirks, a teasing sparkle in his eye.
If he were to pry his eyes open, turn to the window at his right, and wipe the fog from the glass, Draco would see the expanse of snow-covered treetops whose bristly limbs stretch skyward to nearly graze the bottom of the plane. He would stare, mouth agape, at the deep lavender clouds highlighted in gold by the last hint of the sinking sun. He would feel a bit insignificant under the long shadows of the alpenglow-soaked mountains in the distance.
“So… you slept out here?” Potter breaks the silence.
Once inside the visitor’s center, Draco glances around the grungy white room, squinting his eyes against the harsh fluorescent lighting. A young woman leans on the desk, picking at the end of her long, blonde braid and flipping through a magazine. Draco turns away to face the window and covertly removes a journal from his bottomless shoulder bag to review his notes in an attempt to soothe his nerves.
“We’re not going to Seldovia.”
May clicks her tongue against her crooked teeth. “We all have our own herds of goats, Draco, myself included.” Her callused palm is rough as she pats Draco’s cheek before resuming her position on the stool, guarding the wolf. Draco turns to Harry for an explanation of May’s herd of goats, but Harry only shrugs, dismissing it as a mysterious May-ism.
“Couldn’t sleep. Went out for a run.”
“I need a minute.” Draco folds over, resting his hands on his thighs to ease the painful stitch in his side.
“Thanks. That’s pretty handy; I may need to keep you around.” Harry lingers at Draco’s side for a moment, resting his hand on the kitchen table. His brow knits in concentration before he reaches forward and rubs his thumb across Draco’s cheek. The air in Draco’s lungs abandons him, and a rush of blood fills his ears. “You’ve a bit of ink.” Harry attempts a chuckle, but a seriousness in his eyes betrays his easy demeanor. “Er, well, I think I’ve made it worse.”
“You’re so pleasant in the mornings. Don’t let anyone else convince you otherwise,” Harry teases and ambles towards the coffee pot in the corner of the kitchen. “You know how to make coffee?”
“I’m not worried about her walking out of the clinic. It’s after she leaves that troubles me,” May warns before taking a sip from the steaming cup. She grimaces before summoning a bottle of vodka from a far shelf, tipping the clear liquid into her hot chocolate.
“Great, so think of it like a diagnostic for the tree,” Potter continues. “The tree has to be both
Draco nods, relaxing as the familiar pathways of charms cycle through his head.
“Shut up, Malfoy,” he says, turning from the sink and standing inches from Draco’s face. Draco stands straighter, relishing the fact that he hasn’t lost his height advantage. This close, the air crackles with Potter’s magic, the thrumming of electricity before a lightning strike in a thunderous sky.
Harry ambles towards the piles of records on the living room floor and shuffles the sleeves around. He releases a satisfied, “Ah!” when he plucks an orange one from the heap. Wandlessly, he levitates it towards the ever-growing stack of records in the corner, where they wait their turn in line.
you ask?” The faintest of crow’s feet emerge near Harry’s eyes with his mocking grin. “Some cores are more stable than others; you know that. And some are pricklier, untamable, even, but really suited to specific practices. He thought,
“It’s also well-suited to wordless magic. Pine is partial to individualists, and it’s moldable, flexible in its use of new magic. Aspen—"
Now, Draco proceeds toward the strip of grey concrete buildings that line the landing strip, perfectly square and equally spaced apart. The precision settles the unease in Draco’s gut in the same way an organized drawer of socks makes him preen.
“I also snuck into the Slytherin common room in second year, but your
headline about Draco fucking off to France and his unrepentant revelries to push him over the edge.
The worn leather booths and stools are oddly full, despite the early hour. A wall of chalkboards frames the bar, their seemingly handwritten contents shifting from chalky portraits of the customers in front of them to insults directed towards the staff. Drinks stir themselves as the bartender chats with a family in a corner booth. Busts of deer and bears and other animals are mounted on the walls, tracking the plates of food that float from the kitchen and snarling if someone gets too close.
“It’s ‘cause you know I’m right,” Harry says as he sets the bottle on his workbench, uncorks the stopper, and levitates a single, glimmering feather. With an outstretched hand, he lets it hover a moment before allowing it to sink to the cluttered work surface.
Draco bristles at the question, but forces a moment’s pause with a deliberate inhale.
“Thanks for the hot chocolate. And sorry about your shirt.” Draco rubs the fabric between his fingers, holding it away from his chest to show off the stains.
“Nothing.”
Draco raises his eyebrows in a silent admission of approval and follows Potter through the shields.
“Did you see her?” Draco asks. “The wolf from the clinic?”
“Be right back,” Harry calls over his shoulder.
An uncomfortable silence lingers as Potter stands by the door. Despite his vulnerable position in the chair, Draco stiffens his spine and settles a determined gaze on Potter, allowing the unease to mellow.
“Today’s a warm day,” Potter explains as he makes his way down the front porch steps. Draco, wrapped in a double layer of coats and a wool hat, is very much uninterested in discovering what qualifies as a
“I tell no lies,” Draco laughs, encouraged by her reaction. He continues tentatively, “When I was a child, we had peacocks. I know, I know, it is ridiculous, but so was my family. We won’t even go there. Anyway, a pack of peacocks—”
Wrapped in layers and a robust Heating Charm, Draco exits the house in front of Potter, who looks a bit underdressed for the weather. He’s clad in a checkered flannel and blue jeans with his long hair peeking out from underneath a crimson and gold knit beanie as he strides confidently past Draco and out the door.
Draco leans forward to grip the window frame and changes tactics. “Then go,” he hisses. “And be sure to tell St. Mungo’s, and the Ministry, and everyone else who was invested in getting me here that you won’t do it. Tell them you’re afraid or that you’re too good to let Draco
"Oh I'm sorry Blaise, I didn't realise you missed me so!" Draco sneered, rolling his eyes at his friend.
But, he couldn't.
The Headmistress ended her speech. "And now I won't keep you waiting any longer, thank you!" She said, voice rising slightly in volume at the end.
He glanced back at his enemy, only to see his lip quivering ever so slightly, hand fidgeting with the edge of his robe. It was a nervous habit. How he knew that, Harry did not know. It frightened him slightly that he knew this, but the Chosen One quickly dispersed of the thought and rested his head against the cool glass of the window. The compartment was now so silent that you would hear a pin drop, no conversation had spread between the three since Malfoy's arrival. Harry sighed again, closing his eyes against the glass, savouring in its coolness.
'Since when did anything ever go in my favour though?' Draco thought venomously.
Now however, as we filed out of the Great Hall, following the Headmistress, it was all that I could think about. I wondered who I would be in a dorm with, how many people, whether I'd know any of them or not. It was exciting and slightly terrifying all at once.
How could he possibly have been so wrong?
Draco had planned it, knew what he would say and how he would say it. Needless to say, his plan was completely abandoned and thrown out the window along with all his other preparations. Instead, he blurted out over the silence;
Harry's POV
Now, Draco stepped stealthily onto the train. He threw his suitcase under the seat of the nearest compartment and moved away to get changed into his robes early.
It was the summer before sixth year, when Dumbledore was still alive. The Malfoys had been at dinner, silent as usual in an empty house for the first time in a very long while. Draco had been toying with the idea of telling his parents about his newly discovered sexuality for months. He'd only come to terms with it earlier on in the year. It even excited him slightly.
"Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy" she indicated a door near the end of the long room. Was it just me, or had she just smirked as she read our names?
------
He thought over the expressions he had momentarily seen in Draco's face. Longing. Hurt. Sadness. Did that mean he'd wanted to say yes? Was he, too, tired of this feud between them? If he was tired of it, why did he not agree to put the past behind them? Harry sighed to himself as he fought to gather his thoughts. Draco had definitely changed since the war, that much was obvious. He was thinner for a start, whip like and fearful. He kept touching his arm - the one with the Mark - almost disgustedly, as if the very thought of it being there made him sick.
Behind him, there was a thud, then the sound of papers scattering in the floor.
I noticed that Headmistress McGonagall skipped around the subject of the war, which I was thankful for. There was no way I wanted to be reminded of that fucking battlefield anymore than I already was, plus the new first years didn't need to know the details. When she had spoken about the new arrangements for eighth years, I was intrigued.
'Oh. Oh Shit'
By the end of the Sorting, Slytherin had gained a few new members. Draco noted with a kind of relieved sadness that there were no longer empty spaces at any of the tables were those who had died in the war had once sat. He decided not to dwell on the subject.
"Malfoy" I groaned.
I moved to my case and began unpacking too. There was more room in here compared to the usual dorms, but I could understand why there weren't as many people per room here. It was nice to have some silence for once. I glanced up at my new roommate once as I lifted books and clothes from my case. His hands shook slightly as he moved them. I wondered about that as I finished with the case and slid it beneath the bed. Why would his hands be shaking? Was something wrong?
I wondered who I would be paired up with, and when McGonagall read out my name, I didn't even look about to realise that there was only one other male still here.
Or attempted to, in his case. 'I wish I found it that easy, none of them seem to bothered by it, they've all moved on, why can't I?'
Since then, he had not spoken to either of his parents, and they had made no attempt to speak with him. All they had exchanged were a few glares that would have killed their son on the spot had it been possible.
The only problem was, he didn't really know how they would take it. Obviously, since he was their son, nothing too bad would happen, right?
Parkinson chuckled anyway, finding joy in his discomfort. She leaned towards them again "Did you hear who they've got teaching Potions now?" She asked with a grin. Of course Pansy would have the latest gossip. But how much of whatever she had to say would be true?
"Yeah, fine, just fell asleep" Harry stretched, yawning, keeping up the act as well as he could as his heart hammered against his ribs, threatening to break loose. Ron nodded, offering a small smile, before resting his head on Hermione's shoulder again.
No words were spoken, there was no movement. The younger Malfoy fought to keep his hands from fidgeting as he tried with all of his strength not to run form the room right then.
She's been incredibly, uncharacteristically silent since Draco had taken his seat. He glanced,her way to see the woman gazing almost longingly at the Gryffindor table, at Hermione.
The sides were lined with fully stocked bookcases and desks for a more private studying area. I loved it already. It felt cosy, like the Burrow in a way, but more spread out.
I had found myself paying more attention than ever before during the Headmistresses speech. Usually, I zoned out after the first few minutes, but this time was different due to what was being said.
He could hear the far off voices of his parents, could see the moonlight drifting across the table, telling him it had been a few hours at the most. It had felt like so much longer.
"I will get you, Harry Potter" The words were hissed in Parseltongue, writhing like a snake through the air towards Harry.
He joined the procession and made his way into the Great Hall, finding his usual seat between Blaise and Pansy, facing the other tables.
He'd always thought of her as a sister. With her as his girlfriend, he just didn't feel right. So, he'd broken it off, much to her disappointment. She had understood - of course she did - and had spoken a couple of times to Harry to prove she didn't hold it against him.
He frowned at himself in the window. What the bloody hell was that thought about? Star like eyes? Silver diamonds? No. Malfoy's eyes were like ash, boring, dark and grey. Harry narrowed his own eyes. It was too early for these thoughts, he'd dwell on them later if he could be bothered. Now, he just wanted to sleep.
The words were cool, forcefully calm, hiding the eruption of anger dancing just beneath the surface of Lucius's porcelain skin. The question was rhetorical of course, Draco knew enough not to answer, Lucius had heard him perfectly well. The silence of a few seconds before had been words enough.
~~~~~~
"Merlins sake Pansy! Stop drooling over bloody Granger!" Draco said quietly to her, laughing delightedly as she turned towards him, a panicked expression on her face. Pansy had recently began crushing on Granger, despite the fact that she was taken by the Weasel. She rolled her eyes "Fuck off Draco" she spat, a smile tracing her lips as she turned back towards their own table.
------
Signs of the war lay around him in the faded scorchmarks and uneven surface of the ground. Draco didn't want to think about that day, but it seemed his mind couldn't help but wander.
Draco's POV
TRIGGER WARNING: ABUSE
Hermione had been placed with Parvati and Pansy.
'Merlin he's so fucking hot'
Minutes later, a flash of movement outside of the compartment caught Harry's eye. A slice of platinum pale hair and eyes just as devoid of colour. Malfoy. As Harry looked up, he saw the edges of the Slytherin's robes disappear past the door. Seconds later, he returned, flinging the glass entrance open with one slender fingered hand.
He launched into conversation about who he thought the new teachers would be. I listened as he spoke and took over half way through with my own theories.
It was as if he couldn't help but look at the Malfoy, the man he had hated for as long as he could remember. It didn't make any sense to Harry whatsoever. Sure, he'd looked at Draco often enough before, but back then he had been looking for suspicious signs.
Harry's eyes widened in surprise 'That's it? No scathing comment?' Nothing came, Malfoy sat in silence, robes pulled about himself as if he was freezing. Harry looked his enemy up and down. He was paler than ever, purely skin and bones. His robes were pristine, devoid of creases, their green edges practically shimmering in their cleanliness. His hair was slicked back in its usual gelled way. But. Something had definitely changed with the Slytherin Prince. He looked almost broken.
'It just HAD to be fucking Potter'
Draco had come out to his father - no, Lucius - as gay long ago, years ago, and had never had a proper conversation with either him or his mother since. At the time, he'd believed they'd accept him as who he was, even if it did contradict their strict Pureblood beliefs. He'd been so sure that his parents would accept him, that Draco hadn't even been nervous about telling them. He knew that they loved him more than anything, and was almost certain that this new development wouldn't change their minds towards him in the slightest.
The Headmistress eventually stopped, in front of a portrait I'd never seen before near the Gryffindor tower. Judging by the looks of confusion from the other students clustered around me, they'd never noticed it either. The portrait showed a storm swept field, lightning danced over the dark trees in its background. In the forefront there was a man with piercing light brown eyes. He wore a creaseless suit and sat up straight, as if he'd been called to attention or something. A muggle pipe sat on his lips, which was strange since he was surely a wizard. He watched us all without a word, one eyebrow raised. His left hand stroked the stubble adorning his chin. He looked as if he was deep in thought.
The Slytherin pulled himself up into one of the last carriages in the procession. He was alone, thank merlin. Draco turned to the door and slammed it shut, something you weren't supposed to do unless the carriage was full. He needed this time alone, to think in the silence.
Images flashed through my mind, each bringing with them an avalanche of feelings so heavy I couldn't breathe. My eyes widened, everything around me seemed dimmed, tarnished by the war that once again raged around me. I forced my head up, locking into small, minute details on the ground, my suitcase, my hands. Anything to take me mind off of the raging floods coursing through my brain.
Death Eaters, headed by a tall shape with a shaven head, eyes that were more like slits in his skins, pupils that were simply lines of an impenetrable black, the eyes of a snake.
He grimaced, banishing the thoughts from his mind and climbed up into a carriage with Ron and Hermione. Neville sat across from them with his toad. Luna was staring out across the lake from the window, in her own world it appeared. It almost seemed like he was back in first year again, going to the castle for the first time ever.
Maybe he wouldn't be in this situation now, conflicted between two opposing sides.
"Never better, honestly, I'm just glad it's all over." He answered truthfully. The four nodded, replying with comments like "Same here mate" and "Me too" before launching back into their excited talk. It seemed that, like him, they had put the war behind them, pushing its grasping claws out of their thoughts.
Harry wasn't fine, not in the slightest.
The common room was packed, but that was to be expected. Everyone was sitting in a cluster, chattering among themselves. There weren't really any distinct groups that I could pick out, but I noticed Ron and Hermione sitting on the bean bag chairs, talking to a Hufflepuff girl I'd never seen before.
The aristocrat glared at the ceiling of the carriage as if he could melt it with his eyes. It all just wasn't fair. He never asked to be born into a family who had sided with the Dark Lord, he never asked to be tortured and beaten into submission, he'd also never asked to find a fucker like Potter attractive.
"What do you want, Potter?" He tried his best to keep his voice malicious, as much as it pained him to do so. The Slytherin Prince's self control withered as he stared into those twin meadows, oh how easy it would be to lose himself within their depths.
The two were inseparable now, scarcely seen without each other. Harry had been surprised at first when they'd told him about their relationship, but he supposed it did make a lot of sense. As he thought back to Remus's reaction to finding Sirius hadn't murdered Peter, to discovering he was innocent, the relationship seemed more plausible than ever. Of course, he wasn't really well known for being observant, was he?
He looked up again, seeing Draco glance at him, a blush rising on his pale face. What was his problem? Harry turned back to the window, still breathing slowly and deeply. Not long to go now.
"Shove off Pansy, as if she'd be allowed to teach after being in Azkaban!" He scoffed incredulously. Pansy opened her mouth to answer when a sudden hush settled over the hall.
Hermione helpfully informed me that it meant 'Wolf' in Latin as the portrait swung open and we entered the room.
These new dorms would most likely be sorted by gender, rather than by house. There were usually six to eight students per dorm, so the chances of being paired with Potter were decidedly low.
Ron. Hermione. Neville. Luna. Arthur. Molly.
Draco was broken beyond repair, his spirit snapped and obliterated by the last few years of his pathetic excuse for a life. He had no fight left. Those who had known him would have noticed subtle changes in the blonde. But, pretty much e everyone who had known him was dead, or worse, in Azkaban. All except from Pansy and Blaise, both of which had survived through some miracle or another.
When it came to Harry's turn, he was hesitant on what to say. 'It's not like I can just bring up these stupid nightmares' he thought wryly. Instead, he began a tale of what had been happening at Grimmauld Place. He, Sirius and Remus were working to rid the dank old house of centuries of dark magic.
Curses flew over his head, around him from every angle.
Harry had to admit, it felt great to talk to them all again, to laugh like old times. He found himself greatly enjoying their company and relaxed completely as the carriage trundled onwards towards the towering, overshadowed outline of the castle.
Just the thought of Harry sent his mind into turmoil, turned his thoughts to mush. It was outrageous. No one should be able to have such an effect in him, no one deserved that kind of power. It took every shred of Draco's collective willpower to turn his glare to Potter, to reel in his emotions and face what was before him, stony faced.
"Hi! It's so nice to meet you" She beamed, holding out her hand for me to shake. I took it, grinning at her as she turned back to Hermione once more. I couldn't place where I'd seen her before, but something about her......
Harry's POV
He didn't know exactly how long it took for him to slip peacefully into the oblivion of unconsciousness, but once he did, Harry was visited by the nightmares he had come to expect. He really wouldn't have fallen asleep right there, in the middle of the day, with other people present. But, he'd just been so tired.....
-------
His thoughts evaporated suddenly as the green eyed boy he'd watched almost obsessively over the past eight years laughed, light glinting over the emerald green pools of his eyes. Such stunning eyes. The ruffled bird's nest that was  Potter's hair looked as adorable as ever as he threw his head back in laughter.
Ginny.
But he couldn't.
Since he was alone, Draco dropped his usual straight posture, the mask he kept firmly attached to his face discarded for later use. He slumped down on one of the seats, lying with his face to the ceiling, eyebrows scrunched together.
After a while, before the train went into motion, Ron and Hermione walked past, then turned back upon seeing him and came in. "Harry mate! We were lookin' for you!" Ron beamed, a smile etched on his freckled face. Harry stood with a grin, wrapping his friends in a hug. "How are you Harry?" Hermione asked, hair wild as ever.
Harry shook his head, leaning back. "Just a pretty well-trained bird."
Ron snorted. Head hanging, he gave it an almost mocking shake. "No way." Ron peered up at Harry with just his eyes. "Have you been disappearing to 'study' with him, then?"
"What, because you haven't horded enough of them yourself, James?" Lily asked from the other side of the table, pointing at him with her own chip.
"Your silence is very telling."
"Touching?"
Harry grinned, shrugged, and opened the door, stepping aside to allow Draco to pass before him. "From experience, Dot, Von can make a dress out of a potato sack. I think we'll be fine."
Harry opened his mouth to reply but paused. Was that why? No, not really. It had mostly been because to accompany Ron and Hermione on what had clearly been Ron's awkward attempt at asking Hermione on a date was nothing short of ludicrously obtuse of him. It didn't matter that Ron's attempt dissolved into an argument of sorts, as it so often did between the two of them. Harry had decided months ago that arguing was their warped version of flirting. Every act of flirtation had to be accompanied by such an exchange or else it would have been far too discomforting; Ron would have blushed beetroot red, and Hermione would have stuttered and spoken too much, and it would fall to Harry to save the moment and change the subject.
Draco stared, and he couldn't look away. As he watched, and as Harry raked a hand through his hair, in spite of himself Draco's hand twitched around his camera. It was those moments, those everyday actions, that Draco loved. It was what he couldn't help but long to capture, even if his morals demanded he recoil from such an inclination.
in Draco's voice wouldn't leave him. Seated at the end of the couch, hands wedged between his knees and eyes trained upon the carpet before him, Harry scrambled to make sense of it all, to connect the pieces of the jigsaw, but nothing would fit.
"You and me both."
"With a certain someone."
"We've got wards set up around the house," James had said the first day Harry had returned from the hospital. "Extra ones on top of the old ones."
"Sorry," Harry found himself mumbling, dropping his gaze towards his lap and the crumpled jeans resting in his limp clasp. His eyes stung a little, the spell that let him see without his glasses objecting to its long-term use, but he didn't care. Besides, the stinging… for some reason, Harry didn't think the twinging in his eyes was entirely because of the spell. Sniffing didn't alleviate it in the slightest.
"Of course. You keep telling yourself that."
Draco's frown became a glare, but he didn't protest. He couldn't, not with Dimitri – oblivious but surprisingly perceptive Dimitri – in the room to pick up on any whisper of suspicious suggestion. Dimitri was remarkably sharp-eared when it came to magical slips-of-the-tongue.
"Yes."
Draco chased perfection with the compulsiveness of a niffler seeking gold.
Shaken from his thoughts, Draco watched but barely saw a pair of woman stalk past him, caught in the throes of avid but muted conversation. He shook his head. "No. Of course not."
"I've got a change-out for you," Von said as they strode down the narrow hallway, skirting past and dodging around the crew members that darted about like scurrying ants. "Dot will probably want to see you before you head off to wherever you're going afterwards, but I'll make sure there's a car waiting for when you're ready."
"Ron," Granger said before Harry could reply. "Try and show a little propriety."
The world really did need to move on. Harry's absence in the past year more than proved that they were capable of surviving without him.
"You'd be surprised," Draco said, smile still widening. "There are some who consider their magical education to be a chore rather than a privilege."
"You're sitting on me, Potter."
Harry didn't know. He wasn't sure, and the unfamiliarity of not knowing left him feeling oddly exposed in a way that he hadn't felt since his first casting had demanded he take his shirt off. Not since his first assessor had told him he was 'too fat' and 'should probably work out more', and his first rejection notice had given him a thorough rundown of exactly why he wasn't good enough for the job. Not even when someone had stalked him with a camera for a time and sold some grainy but distinct enough photos to a magazine that had impeded any job offers for a solid month.
"Oh." Harry blinked lazily. "That's good, then."
"Can I have that back, please?" he asked.
But even so.
"Are you worried about me? Really?"
"Are you alright? You look exhausted."
Or the way he would glance towards Harry.
"Thanks," Harry said. "Apparently green's my colour?"
Harry didn't really understand Draco. Why he'd been at the club. Why he'd asked those questions in particular. Why he'd cared enough to Apparate Harry away from it all and to his very own apartment. He was still thinking that as he rolled onto his side, pressed his face into the pillow and fell to sleep to the scent of Draco on its cover.
"I'm not saying there's anything wrong with the direction of your decision. Just that you should focus on issues closer to home first if you wanted to publicly kick up a fuss."
Like Ginny's flying.
"The fact that you sound so happy saying that is very disturbing, Draco."
"We're in London already. We may as well make the most of it." Draco's hand brushed Harry's once more, then shifted to slip into a handhold. In the darkness of the room, it would have been adequately hidden, but Harry couldn't help glancing over his shoulder nonetheless.
"I mean," Harry felt the hitch of Draco's swallow more than he heard it, "that what you're going through, and your struggle? I could be constituted the same in my prejudice, only in a different area."
"Pureblood prejudice against Muggles is different to Muggle prejudice against gays?"
"Thank you, Jackie. It's very gracious of you."
"If you could play anything but a seeker in quidditch, what would you play?"
"No, I'm alright, thanks," Harry said, looping a ring of red onion around his fork instead.
"Your dad?"
, in her role of an official gossipmonger, and in her own skill. She'd always been confident, had always spoken her thoughts, but Draco thought she'd grown into herself since the war. Necessity had demanded she abandon the pieces of herself that luxury had until then allowed her to hold onto. That evolution hadn't been entirely apparent when she'd visited Draco over the past couple of years, but it was starkly so when he watched her across the table. Pansy didn't simply survive. She lived to her fullest.
"You're going abroad?"
Harry glanced up at him, pausing in his folding. "Just the stuff for
"But you didn't tell the whole truth."
Lowering his gaze, Draco tucked his chin and started up the steps into the foyer. A heavy weight sat with him just as it had for days, making his feet just a little heavier than they should have been; he couldn't tell Harry, because in such a short time, Draco had come to understood how Harry would respond. He knew Harry would take it as an obligation, that he'd accept Draco because acceptance of duty for someone else, regardless of what that duty was, was what he did.
Harry punched Sirius' shoulder in return. "I do not!"
"Right-o, so the research report that I mentioned on Monday – we'll be beginning that today." Gesturing to a standing table positioned along the side of the room, a table Harry had barely noticed when he'd entered, he beamed at the class. "Samples are one to a pair. I need a full analysis of the ingredients within the sample, but independent fifty-inch reports from the both of you. The proceeding potion you'll be brewing between you, though – that will be a joint effort. Understood?"
Draco regarded him with narrowed eyes. He'd been wary of Ipetsky for a long time, as a competitor, if nothing else, but his awareness of the man had reached new heights since he'd first heard Harry mention him a week before. 'Friendly' didn't entail call after incessant call when those calls were clearly being ignored. It didn't step beyond the professional boundary of photographer and model that was supposed to be kept, a boundary that Draco was himself morally grappling with of late. It certainly didn't involve intruding upon a private sitting as though it had every right to do so.
He always had. Always, and he hadn't even realised it. He'd sought to be the best, the most respected, the most well-behaved son of any of his parents' friends, and he had been. He'd sought to be the loudest, the most headstrong, and the leader of every game that he and his friends played, because that was the top position and top was his.
Draco didn't reply, but he didn't need to. Harry saw it in the tightness of his shoulders and chided himself a little for presuming Ron wasn't retaliating. He'd said that 'Slytherins' were all gits. Harry had believed him to an extent, but… maybe he shouldn't have. Was it any worse than what Draco had said?
Draco stopped his fiddling, the mug's scraping silenced. He didn't need to answer.
Harry's shoulders hunched towards his ears. He didn't know what it was about the room, about the 'romantic' setting as it was – which it still definitely was – and the portraits that asked too many questions and encouraged too enthusiastically. For whatever reason, the words had spilled from Harry's lips in a relentless torrent that he hadn't a hope of withholding. He'd spoken more in the past hour – hours? - than he thought he'd done the whole year before that, and that was even counting the tedium of equally relentless interviews he'd been forced into. The
Frowning, apparently unaware of the effect he'd had upon Harry as he eyed the wine of his cup, Draco muttered something to himself before replying. "I'll most likely take the job. After this shoot finishes up – well, suffice it to say that it will be an uncomfortable city to live in for a time. For me, anyway."
Even as he said it, Harry didn't think it meant quite what it used to. Spinning the flower between his own fingers, Harry thought Malfoy probably thought as much too. For whatever reason, despite the darkness painting the walls, when Malfoy took Harry's hand, the room felt just a little brighter.
"I want you," Draco found himself saying. "How can you not realise that? I've wanted you for years, even if I've only just recently realised it. I –" His voice caught, and Draco growled in frustration for his sudden unintelligibility. "I want to be with you. I asked you to come with me, here, because I want you to – to be –"
The sun hadn't quite risen. Eyes cracking open, squinting through the skewed lenses of his glasses, the still-frosted window bared at his side was only faintly illuminated by a hazy grey dawn. For a moment, Harry stared in groggy lethargy, sleep-addled mind flicking through the list of acknowledgements that it had taken to conducting in his months on the run with Hermione and Ron.
, he thought, hunching around the side of the mattress.
"No," Pansy agreed. "But you could do both."
Harry smiled as he wandered behind them alongside Draco, though he listened with only half an ear. They did have to leave early, and Pansy's reminder might have dampened the mood a little, but…
Harry's scan jerked to a stop. Draco was half a room away, just as exhausted as the rest of them. Maybe even more given that, just like Harry he'd barely slept in the past week. Haggard. Pale. Shadows under his eyes. Harry caught his eyes, held it, and –
"Sleeping," Lily said, hugging Harry towards her and dropping her forehead towards his own. "He's just sleeping."
Not even a flicker of embarrassment remained, swept aside in the wake of his dazed aftermath. His breath was still were heavy, his lips a little sore not unfamiliarly so yet still somehow different to the effect of Ginny's kisses. His body felt heavy too, blissfully relaxed and comfortable in a way he hadn't felt for weeks. Not since Draco had last given him the benefit of his lap. It felt like a long time ago since Pansy had walked in on them, since Harry had been left stupefied in Draco's wake as he swept from the alcove in a fit of mortification.
Considering how many such letters Draco received – and almost every day, at that – they were remarkably similar. He was hated. He was a murderer. He'd hurt people, killed people, and some even accused him of killing their loved ones directly.
"Blimey…"
Her leg stilled from its jiggling, and Harry felt himself freeze along with it. As Gertrude stared at him, her gaze intent and abruptly absent of the bright bubbliness that Harry had beheld from so many interviewers, he felt the hairs rise on the back of his neck.
The edge of suspicion faded almost instantly as he met Harry's gaze, however. To the chorus of voices playing around them, he leant slightly across the table and extended his hand. Harry reached for it and grasped it almost desperately, even as James' hand thumping into the back of his chair with an overloud "I'm his father, it's my job!"
When Ron had found out, he'd been wrought with bystander horror. "I'll come and rescue you or something," he'd said over the phone. "Kidnapping style or something. In the middle of the interview. Just – I dunno, bugger off somewhere and hide until the hype dies down and Dot comes to her senses about who she'll approve to do the interviews and pictures."
Jackie grinned through a mouthful. "Brain food."
Draco cut himself off as a librarian chose that moment to slip around the nearest shelf and file an armful of books away. Draco watched the woman until she finished, disappearing around the corner, before turning back to Harry. "Show me another?"
"Right," Malfoy said. "Of course. I suppose that makes… sense."
Disregarding the last of his contemplations, Harry dove into the dry, crinkled pages of monotonous boredom. What better way was there to enjoy an afternoon?
"I –" Pansy paused, cutting herself off. Her lips still parted, Draco saw her pick at her teeth with her tongue as though pondering continuation before doing so. "I wish it was otherwise, Draco. For you. I really do. It's a difficult situation you've found yourself in, but," raising a hand, she pressed it against the side of his head in a brief, surprisingly affectionate pat, "I wish you all the best."
"Oh, my mistake. From experience, that seems to be what it sounded like."
"Still. Slacker."
Malfoy rolled his eyes. The gesture was so unexpected, so unseen of him that year until that moment, that Harry almost started. "Whatever. Look, are we going to actually do some work, or not?"
Without Draco, Jackie, and Jill, without Sirius and Remus back just yet, the room felt unexpectedly hollow. Flopped back on his pillow, fighting then failing to suppress a yawn, Harry glanced to his parents. Only to find them both watching him keenly.
"Have you got anything better to do with yourself?"
Draco leant back into him, pressing a kiss upon his forehead as he did so. Harry didn't think he would ever grow used to such touches; his skin seemed to tingle with delight at the brush of Draco's lips.
Did he want to go back upstairs? Yes. Of course he did.
"Not with glasses on."
"I think he'll be fine," Harry finally said. "And if he isn't, I'll work it out somehow."
"I'm not kicking up a fuss. I'm aiming to remain totally unbiased and informative."
But it didn't feel like such a bad thing. There was no animosity anymore. If expensive clothes were something someone like Draco clung to, he could wear them. It didn't bother Harry, had nothing to do with him, and there wasn't really any reason to point it out.
"Unlikely," Sirius muttered.
Draco might have been almost pretty, but he was too sharp for pretty. He was tall, if not quite as impressively so as the gorillas, and carried an air of confidence to him that bordered upon – or perhaps leapt over the border of – blatant arrogance.
Harry slowly turned towards him. The dormitory was dark, but the pale glow of the frost, cast awash in almost luminescent white from the backdrop of moonlight, was illuminating enough to see by. Draco sat against the window, his head still rocked backwards, and his legs extended before him. With his ankles crossed, his hands held loosely in his lap, and eyes heavy lidded as they stared up at the dark ceiling, he was the picture of lazy relaxation. It was a sharp contrast to the words that spilled from his mouth, rough and coarse in more than just tone.
"Jackie, get off your high horse. I just forgot."
Harry groaned, a little more dramatically than was necessary, and allowed himself to be pulled in Draco's wake. He wouldn't really protest. Not when Draco was visibly attempting to clamber from an abruptly horrified mood. Instead, he trudged in Draco's footsteps and only cast a single wistful glance over his shoulder at the world he was leaving behind.
Arranging the seats in the corner Jackie had chosen, Harry assumed the one at her side. "You couldn't wait?" he asked.
For one suspended moment, the class swirling around their frozen quartet as everyone made their way to the samples table, no one spoke. Then Parkinson snorted, Zabini snickered, and Malfoy cleared his throat.
he wondered, cursing himself just as he had as a boy but unable to stop staring. The colours, the flecking, that they somehow seemed brighter and bigger and infinitely more captivating than he remembered. Was he using a charm? Curse him if he was, for that was underhanded play. Or was it just because he wasn't wearing glasses?
"Do you care for him?"
The thought came out of nowhere, but when it rose, it settled firmly and comfortably in Draco's mind. It was true. So true that it almost stung, and Draco couldn't believe he'd only just realised it as a tangible thought.
"Hippogriffs exist," Draco said. "They're real, and yes, though griffins were traditionally the more common eagle-cross, someone took it upon themselves to broaden the hybrid speciation variety. Horses were the only one that stuck."
He did well. This was something that Harry knew he could do.
"To be fair, Hermione, I doubt anyone's really going to tell Harry-bloody-Potter he needs to learn more about Defence Against the Dark Arts."
"I don't like him!" Harry barely realised he was shouting, but it didn't matter. Hands falling to clutch instead at his knees, he stared up at the five women with nothing short of desperation. "I don't! I can't! After everything, it's impossible. I – we have always, always fought, and he gets on my every goddamn nerve, and he – he fought on the other side of the war! I don't like him! Not even a little bit, I swear!"
Harry started at her, then glanced at Ron. In the relative quietness of the corridor, removed from students and staff but for the distant murmur of voices, both Hogwarts students seemed suddenly uncomfortable. "This is a whole-school tradition you've got going or something? Calling it that?"
And now Harry's parents were telling him that they'd rented a house?
"You look like shit."
It was so like Dot. Efficient, more than capable of setting aside any personal feelings for the most pressing matters. Harry had mentioned nearly three weeks before in a sporadic phone call that he and Draco were considering making their way home, but it had been far from definite. Yet despite that spontaneity, Dot had risen to the play as she always did.
Not anymore. It seemed perfectly suitable for him these days.
"Maybe not so impossibly," Pansy said with a sigh. She shook her head, turning and propping herself against the side of the table as though defeated. "It was always that way with you two, you know? If you didn't hate one another then you were bound to go in the complete opposite direction."
The modelling industry could be brutal, and not just for photographers, though Draco had experienced more than his fair share of back-breaking hours, time spent editing and stylising shots that was ultimately rejected, and overall dissatisfaction when he couldn't achieve what he wanted just right.
Both man and woman had no such restraint in masking their own derision. The woman glared, propping a hand on her hip, her overlong nails curling into claws as they did so, while the man smiled in a way that looked more like a snarl. "Exactly. You shouldn't have been given the job."
"Then you have too much faith in me."
Harry raised an eyebrow. "How do you figure? I get that you were dealing with it yourself and all, but you still didn't tell me. And what about summer last year when you said you were sick for a whole week when you really just stole a dog and wanted to stay home with it but knew it was wrong so didn't -"
Falling prey to the urge to do so, Harry finally raised a hand to the side of Draco's face. He almost expected Draco to pull away from him, to flinch as though repulsed or to frown with a bout of confusion, but he didn't. Instead, his eyes widened, lips parting and breath hissing with a sharp inhalation.
Any urge to ask that may have arisen at that moment was further quelled when, at the touch of Draco's wand, the bricks rippled. They clinked. They grinded. A rumble seemed to shudder through the ground. Then, with a cracking slide, the wall split to reveal a perfectly formed archway.
"Oh, I know," Blaise said, grin widening.
"Are you belittling me? Seriously? Now?"
A presentation, hours of work, and an exhibition at the end of it all. It all seemed like a whole lot of unnecessary work in Harry's opinion. Granted, C&C was far from being a taxing unit, and he was up for anything novel, anything to serve as a break from the daily monotony, but simply having his workload added to was… kind of depressing.
"After last night." Draco spoke quietly enough that eavesdroppers wouldn't be able to catch a word without the use of magic, but Harry heard him nonetheless. "Are you alright?"
Harry had been outcast since his first year in high school. At twelve, he'd come out to his parents, and the secret had somehow slipped into the ears of his classmates. School life took a turn when so many looked at him like he was disgusting, or strange, or as though he might contaminate them if he stood too close. And it might have hurt –
Draco gave a tight shrug. "I don't. She's always been good to me, or at least she has been since I've actually been allowed to see her. She's always resented my father, though, blaming him for getting my mother caught up in the wrong side of a war."
"What, so you're a poet now? I'd never have thought it of you given how adamantly you've avoided books for most of your school career."
A/N: Thank you to the lovely people who read and commented last chapter! I am so unutterably grateful! Sorry that it's a little bit late this week; hopefully I'll get back on track for next chapter. See you next time!
"What did she mean?"
"And then afterwards, we'll go into your life and career as the Saviour of the Wizarding world and beyond. The post-war rebound, deciding not to return to school, how you got into modelling…"
"Right. And did he…?" Draco waited as Harry fought to force the words out. "Did he… Apparate with you? He did magic, right?"
"I know, right?" Harry agreed.
"What, ensuring your own devastating attractiveness isn't a princess' style?"
"Fucking Death Eater scum," he muttered before striding away in the opposite direction to Draco, shoulders rigid with tension.
A little more hesitantly, Harry nodded again.
"Do they know this kid?" James asked, planting himself next to him. He seemed taller than usual, but that was likely due to his looming as he stared down at him Harry. "Will they tell me who he is? Will Jill give me an accurate description?"
"What?" Jackie shouted back.
"Frankness? Well, that's one way of putting it that I haven't heard before." Pansy shook her head, her immaculate curtain of hair swishing around her chin. "You must be happy to be finally rid of him, Dimitri."
Harry, realising Blaise's slip far less resignedly than Draco, darted forwards before Jackie could reach for the handful of silver sickles and golden galleons that Blaise was sifting through. "Wrong coins there, Blaise. Seriously, why do you even carry them with you?"
"Very Muggle."
Even if Draco hadn't recognised the words as Harry's, he thought he would have known it was him. The way the fury, the hatred, the aggression, immediately vanished from the burly man like water swiped from a window could have it be no one else. Still, Draco was more than a little surprised when, with a compulsive step backwards, the man seemed to disregard Draco entirely. Draco nearly tumbled to the floor as his collar was abruptly released
It still didn't make the prospect of eventually introducing Draco to his parents any better, though. Which would happen, surely. After all, Harry supposed Draco was in for the long haul – wasn't he?
. Lily, what -?"
"Just leave it," James said as she rose to her feet.
The tutting and compassion:
Draco blinked. "But it's what you are," he said blankly.
Draco was scared, but certainly not enough to withhold a reply. "You clearly think I'm more intimidated than I am, then," he managed, breathless. "What are you going to do, punch me?"
Draco smirked. "Then don't give me your words to use."
Harry almost winced again. He was hardly the poster boy of the school. Far from it, in fact, given that most of his classmates all but hated him. He didn't think that his greeting of their visitors was exactly a good way to start things, nor that he'd done a particularly good job of presenting himself. He had no particular loyalty for his school but good impressions mattered even on an individual level.
actually is. That same mystical draw is still there, albeit muted beneath this hardened and unfamiliar exterior.
“And on the full moon?”
Harry? You finally find yourself a man?”
“It’s not possible,” Harry says over the volume of a hockey game later that night. He sits cross-legged on the couch while Draco watches intently from the armchair. Despite Draco’s years as a Seeker, he has trouble tracking the tiny puck on the screen.
“How do you find your own thoughts in this mess?” Draco asks through a yawn as he surveys the workshop with a mixture of curiosity and distaste.
“Hey! Perk up, buttercup. I won’t take any attitude from you, young man. Too early for that shit.” Rory’s eyes brighten when they fall on Draco. “Who’s the
“Yes, obviously.” Draco narrows his eyes. “I’ve a peculiar feeling that was a rhetorical question.”
Draco isn’t sure whether his taste buds are skewed by the fact that all he’s eaten in two days is some mixed nuts and coconut flakes, or if the bizarre meal is actually delicious. For the time being, he doesn’t care. It takes every ounce of self-control to swallow a moan as he sinks his teeth into the flaky, buttery, gravy-soaked biscuit imposter.
“I hope you don’t have fleas,” Draco mumbles, but doesn’t remove his hand.
anything from the trees or the charms he’s cast. Interpreting the patterns and colors is easy, once he recognizes what he’s looking for. There isn’t much left to guesswork. Though Potter’s comparison to a patient’s presentation seems appropriate, a tree can’t talk. A tree can’t breathe. As long as the tree isn’t visibly dying, he’s not sure what else could deter him from the results of the charms.
“Why are you telling me this?”
over her Disillusionment Charm, revealing the hidden shelves of wizarding products. She circles the checkout counter and leans on her elbows, resting her chin in her palms to stare questioningly at Draco.
Draco lifts his left hand and frowns at the coating of ink that seeps into the lines of his outer palm. Frustrated, he lays the quill on the table and rests his face in his hands, speaking his thoughts out loud.
Finding his composure, Draco recites his explanation in an exasperated drone, “I’m a medical student. I’m studying healing and magical theory in London, but this is my last semester. I’m here to study wandmaking so I can apply the knowledge to healing techniques. I’m studying under Harry Potter. Apparently.”
“Morning, Rory,” Potter grumbles.
“Again, with this
“You asked about the last time I went somewhere warm,” Harry says, stopping again to look back at Draco. “It was right after Sam died. Morocco.”
“What devious things have you done since school?” Harry asks, and Draco sneers at the question. “And before you start—Draco, wait. Don’t walk away, Draco; I don’t mean it like that. Just for fun. Promise.”
“It took her
Fee. So I must tell you: I am terrified of peacocks,” he confesses and immediately curses his loose tongue. Control over his narrative for the first time in his life, and he chooses fear of peacocks?
“What’s this?”
Draco only hesitates a moment before wrapping his gloved hand around Harry’s forearm, and Harry doesn’t wait to call on the twist of Apparition. Through the blur, it’s Harry’s image that remains perfectly clear.
“Good for you, I suppose.” Draco rolls his eyes at the futility in this conversation and leans his hip against the countertop. “And the Puking Pastilles?”
A handful of patrons raise mugs or glasses in greeting to Potter as he walks across the room. It’s not a reverent greeting or one laced with celebrity, but how one would greet a friend who’s passing through. Potter waves back and smiles before taking a corner booth underneath a mounted moose bust. Draco hesitates a moment, stunned by the size of the antlers, before taking a seat on the other side of the table.
Harry found himself turning to Draco almost periodically as the train shuddered forwards.
No matter what, he couldn't subject the blundering idiot to the endless insults they would receive, even a simple friendship could endanger them all. He wouldn't do that to Potter. As well as this, despite everything, his loyalties still lay with the Malfoys. He couldn't disgrace his family like this, he'd done it enough already. Being homosexual was one thing, but becoming affiliated with The Boy Who Lived? That was treason.
He sank against the glass of the compartment door, pressing himself as far away from Potter as he possibly could, fighting to keep the tears of despair in his eyes.
"Shove it Malfoy, you're not wanted here" Ron snarled, tensing as the pale man looked at them all. It was obvious he was expecting a fight, nothing nice ever came from Malfoy's presence. 'He did help me in the war though, maybe things will be different now?' Harry thought to himself, biting back a sharp comment. This year, he was looking for a fresh start.
He was standing there, by the door. Malfoy.
All I know is, I woke up to the sound of screaming.
"Let's put all this behind us"
Harry thought for a moment, then replied "Lets put all this behind us Malfoy. I don't want to be at each other throats anymore."
Hogwarts wasn't too far away.
"Fine thanks 'Mione. I got here early, so I thought I might as well find us a carriage" Harry grinned, sitting again. He noticed with glee that his friends were clasping each other's hands 'Finally' he thought to himself as they sat beside him.
'She looks so familiar'
"I'm tired of us being at each others throats all the time" I stated.
"Crucio."
My friends had noticed - of course they had - and had questioned me on it, but of course, I said I'd be fine and began to focus on the intricate designs adorning the path that we walked along, looking anywhere but the scorch marks I could see out of the corner of my eye. I'd never been happier to enter the Great Hall.
'Wait a minute. I'm worried about a Malfoy?'
Eventually, the train stopped, coming to a halt at the near deserted station. Harry caught sight of Hagrid from the window, standing stoic and proud with his lantern held high before him.
Ron, Hermione and Draco were staring at him, confusion on their faces. Draco quickly averted his eyes, seemingly finding intense interest in the corridor once more.
It seemed odd that they would put us somewhere different, but I supposed it was to stop over-crowding or something. I hadn't really thought on it for too long.
He managed to sit up, crying out in a cracked, harsh voice that was not his own as soon as he made that slight movement. His skin felt as if it was crawling, boiling all over with throbbing pain. The Mark on his arm bubbled, almost as if it was enjoying his pain, savouring it. He grimaced as he eventually did sit up, wincing as his joints groaned at the small movement. His head pounded as he stood shakily, stumbling backwards a few steps before shuddering upright.
Harry jolted into consciousness, eyes wide with alarm, the cries of the dead ringing in his ears. He realised where he was and sank his head into his hands, feigning rubbing sleep from his eyes to give himself a moment to calm down.
She was silent for a few seconds, then suddenly seemed to regain her composure. "Like you can talk anyway, how long has it been now since a certain Golden Boy has caught your eye?" Pansy grinned evilly at his embarrassment. Crimson crept across his pale cheeks "Oh bugger off Pansy." He scowled. This was not a laughing matter.
~~~~~~
He ran from the compartment, his face burning with embarrassment, just as it had been for the past half hour. As it had been since Potter had stretched, showing his tanned, toned body previously hidden beneath his robes.
Not anymore, not this time, and never again.
Just as Voldemort stood above him, eyes red and boring straight through Harry's skull. In his hand, he held the elder wand. A slim line of bone that fit The Dark Lord's hand comfortably.
Malfoy stood, brushed the creases from his robes, adjusted his collar and expertly gelled back hair. He flung the door open with all the swagger of his heritage and stepped nimbly down the stairs. Already, his mask had slid up onto his face; a sneer that almost dared those around him to provoke him.
Draco brooded over this as he swept back towards his chosen compartment, lost in his thoughts. He walked straight past it at first he was so lost in his thoughts. He backtracked a little as soon as he realised it was behind him and could only just mask his horror as he saw The Golden Trio inside.
"You are what?"
Harry knew he hadn't wanted it, he understood how much Draco had pleaded to be spared from it. The thought made anger rise like fire within himself once more.
Then, he was unconscious. Pure, blissful, painless nothingness. An escape from the burning that was his world, escape from the family he could no longer face. 'Hopefully' he'd thought to himself 'I'll die here, maybe now my luck will turn.'
The castle had been rebuilt since the battle. Any signs of damage were hidden from view, the worst pieces re-constructed. There were scars that detailed where the battle had taken place and as Draco surveyed the few he could see, images flew through his mind.
"Don't even get me started mate! Just my luck to be put with those two bloody lovebirds" he indicated Dean and Seamus, holding hands as they spoke to a Ravenclaw on one of the couches. "Who'd you end up with?" He asked, turning away from the couches.
Hi! How's this chapter? Please leave comments and votes, it's much appreciated! Thank you everyone who's read this so far, it mean a lot.
Instead, he barked some sharp comment and sat down, not even paying attention to whatever the Weasels reply was. He was too focused on keeping his gaze away from Harry's. He didn't want to speak of what happened at the battle. He couldn't conjure a single logical explanation for his actions, the only reason he had done it was because it had felt right.
They took turns, giving brief descriptions of what surprising things had happened to them throughout the long months after the war.
Harry's POV
Malfoy's eyebrow rose, his expression flickered from neutral to hurt, to longing and back to its stone cold resting place. "As if Potter. That can't happen." There was a slight hitch in the blonde's voice that made Harry's heart skip a beat as he once again sat back, ignoring the looks of surprise on his best friend's faces. He felt more saddened by that reply than he would have thought possible.
He couldn't think about these things just now, they could make him lose his signature Malfoy cool, and that was something he just could not allow.
As if he could feel Harry's gaze upon him Malfoy turned and directed that frozen glare straight into the emerald pools of Harry's eyes. "What're you looking at Potter?" Came the slow, calculative drawl.
I made my way around the room, entering the small bathroom complete with shower, sink and toilet. I caught sight of my shockingly green eyes and ruffled hair as I turned back out.
"Stupid bloody Potter" he muttered to himself.
"You alright mate?" Ron asked, worry evident in his narrowed eyes. His expression mirrored Hermione's beside him.
He remembered what it had been like, seeing the huge man for the first time. He smiled as memories flitted across his mind. He was brought back by Ron telling him to "Get a move on" and quickly rose to grab his things. His friends were just exiting the compartment, probably going to get a carriage.
"Oi! Harry mate, are you even listenin'?" Ron asked, waving his hand in front of a dazed Harry's face. "What? Eh-yeah, sorry, just tired" he said, blinking a few times to clear his head. A heartbeat later, the chatter resumed between the three, as enthusiastic as ever. Harry shoved all thoughts from his mind, happy to be back with his friends and focusing on not zoning out again.
He listened intently as Neville told a story about how he'd discovered a new species of plant on a nature walk over the summer, grinning as the man explained how he'd only found it after sliding down a hill. The whole carriage burst out laughing at that, adding on their own stories after Neville had finished.
~~~~~~
The difference was in the jittering of his hands, the rabbit-in-the-headlights look to his eyes, the paper thin complexion of his skin. Draco had noticed these changes, but he doubted others would. No one had really cared about him since he had failed his Task. That summer hadn't been uplifting either, oh no, why would it have been? It wasn't like he deserved any happiness after what he'd done.
"No clue mate, 's been there since I got here" Harry replied. The bag was made from green leather, patterned with what looked like a snake on its surface. Again, Harry felt as if he should know who it belonged to. He had seen it before, it was definitely someone in his years suitcase.
Draco directed his silver eyed glare out into the corridor, sifting through his thoughts in an attempt to group them into appropriate packages he could actually deal with. Draco could feel eyes on him, just one pair. Harry's eyes. He tensed without really acknowledging it.
Wait. What?
As if Potter would understand that.
A feat much easier said than done.
"How'd you like the rooms?" I asked him, smirking.
The trio made light conversation with one another as the train whistled into motion, pulling away from the station like a bird taking off from a branch. The comforting rhythm of the train settled over the three, instantly relaxing them as they spoke.
Almost.
Draco glanced up once at the Gryffindor table, locking eyes momentarily with Harry before quickly averting his gaze. He refused to think about that insufferable git just now. He sighed into his plate as he piled it with the many delicacies on the table.
Ron laughed "Should'a expected that, really" he smirked at my glower. "Bloody Malfoy, that's karma for pulling that stunt on the train" he paused. "Why'd you do it anyway? You really want to be friendly with that moron?"
"Uh, sorry, what?" I stuttered, blinking a few times to re-orient myself.
The Slytherin only half listened as a hush once more settled like a thick blanket over the hall and Professor - No, she was Headmistress now - McGonagall began to speak. He picked out a few key details as she spoke, but most of it was the same as always and directed mostly towards the new first years. Draco listened intently however to the small piece of information she gave to the eighth years.
Merlin, how wrong he'd been.
Draco blanched suddenly. He'd thought he was over that stupid crush. He could not be gay for Potter, no matter what the evidence told him. Draco did what a Malfoy does best. He swallowed his conflicted feelings and pulled the compartment door open in a wild flurry. He almost lost his nerve as three sets of piercing eyes shot in his direction.
"T-thanks Potter" came the quiet voice, holding only a trace of the usual venom.
"Oh Harry! This is Juniper." She said, grinning at the girl next to her.
What was he looking for now?
He grinned, teeth almost razor like, inhuman.
Ok, I decided to try first person. Please let me know if you prefer third person or if there are any mistakes!
'Keep up the mask. Don't let it slip. Don't let him see beneath it' Draco fought a small internal battle to keep himself expressionless, although he could tell he hadn't been entirely successful as Potter's eyes clouded with concern. "As if Potter. That can't happen." he sneered, internally screaming at himself, hating himself more than ever as stupid, beautiful, loyal Potter's face contorted into an expression of deep hurt and sadness.
Then came the words, those words he'd longed to hear since first year from the boy he'd adored for as long as he could recall. The Golden Boy wanted to put the past behind them. He wanted a fresh start. 'Potter, don't you know how much I've wanted this?'' Draco yearned to scream this at that stupid sod. He wanted so badly to nod, to agree, to express his intense desire to start afresh.
The noise reverberated through the dining hall, straight through Draco as the hesitant smile slid from his face. There was silence. A rising tide of fury boiling from where his father sat. His mother had simply frozen, her lip curled slightly in a mixture of surprise and disgust. She had always been gifted at hiding her feelings, more so than Lucius had ever been.
They all died, all of them. He was the only one left.
"This year, due to the terrible misfortunes of the last which I'm sure you are all quite aware of, we have invited the previous seventh years back for an eighth year. They will be acting as normal students and will not be excused from any of the usual school activities."
Her eyes flicked almost unnoticeably towards The Golden Trio.
The train was already busy, filled to the brim with excited students eager to begin their year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry looked into each compartment he passed, smiling as memories of all his previous years sitting there flashed through his mind. Memories of buying the entire sweet trolley to share with a lanky, ginger haired boy. Memories of a bushy haired girl looking for a toad and fixing Harry's glasses. Memories of happiness shared with his two best friends.
Pansy paid him no heed, carrying on as if he'd never spoken in the first place. "There's rumours. Apparently, she's been to Azkaban!" She positively beamed, ecstatic to have uncovered such a priceless piece of information.
Wrong, wrong, wrong.
He'd said it so fast, he'd tripped over the words. Malfoys don't stutter, Malfoys think before they speak, Malfoys plan what they're going to say before they say it and stick to the plan. It felt good to finally get the words out though, words that had toiled inside him like a waiting storm for as long as he could remember. For the first few seconds, he felt feather light.
Ron had been paired with Dean and Seamus.
'Finally!' I thought. Now, I had a chance to end this stupid rivalry between us. Malfoy would have no choice now, he'd have to speak to me. I started towards our room and entered through the dark wooden door. The door knob was cold in my hand as I turned it. The door opened inwards, releasing the delicious scent of vanilla. The room was decorated plainly with Gryffindor and Slytherin colours, occasionally even mixing them together. I wrinkled my nose at that. Two four poster beds sat to the right hand side, a long, rectangular mirror with a ledge between them. One of the beds, obviously Malfoys, had a green duvet and pillow with silver lining. I snorted. Typical Slytherins, they just had to go over the top with detail. The other bed had a plain red duvet, much better.
Bodies fell around him, protecting the defenceless, wandless Chosen One for all they were worth. Each one fell, each one crumpled.
He frowned down at it even as he nodded along to whatever Ron was saying. He'd been over to the Burrow a few times over the holiday. Each time had been great, though a little awkward after the breakup with Ginny.
I walked over and sat down next to Ron on a red beanbag.
Unlike Draco, Blaise seemed unable to conceal his feelings, at least, not in his eyes anyway. Blaise's eyes were always full of emotion, even when his face was set in stone.
Draco turned away. Wishing right there and then he would die, would just spontaneously combust on the spot. Anything to stop the guilt that now wracked him. He had caused that look of hurt, of sadness. All because of this fucking thing on his arm. His Merlin-awful parents, his pathetic excuse of a family. And him, a pathetic excuse for a Malfoy.
"Have a bloody guess Potter! I have to share a room with the likes of you, why the hell would I be happy about that?" He snorted, eyes flashing dangerously as he threw open his suitcase and began to unpack.
All at once, the fight seemed to evaporate from the blonde and he slumped into the seat closest to the door, furthest away from the Trio. "Whatever Weasel, everywhere else is full now anyway." he spat, kicking the suitcase towards himself and turning his icy gaze to the corridor outside.
"Lupus"
Malfoy looked more muscular than before, his face angular and lean like the rest of him. His eyes as star-like as ever. Shining like silver diamonds.
It all seemed like so long ago now.
Then, the pain hit.
Immediately, Ron and Hermione's chatter stopped. Three pairs of eyes pointed glares at the newcomer in almost perfect synchronisation.
"Fuck up, Scarface" he sneered, shooting me a glare as he went over to his bed to unpack. Whatever had been wrong with him on the train seemed to be long gone now. The look of despair had been replaced by his usual don't-mess-with-me expression that I'd come to associate with with Malfoys.
I remembered suddenly that I didn't want to keep being mean to him and tried to hide the scowl that seemed to automatically take over my features. Malfoy looked as if he would rather be thrown off of the Astronomy Tower than stand there. He shot me a withering look.
Harry zoned out, the same thought repeating again and again in his mind, accompanied by snapshot images of that dreadful day.
It was his fault Draco had gotten the Mark in the first place. Hell, the whole bloody thing was his fault. A lump rose in his throat. 'Don't break down, not here, not now. Stay strong.' He silently willed himself. There was no way he was saddling Ron and Hermione with his stupid feelings, not after all they'd endured for him.
Harry only half listened as Ron told him and Hermione about the latest Quidditch matches. The Chudley Cannons had won their last match three to nil, and had another at some point later on in the week. He was really thinking about that stupid green leather suitcase. Who did it belong to? Why was there no one with it?
The Slytherin Prince slid into platform 9 and 3/4 wordlessly, unnoticed by anyone. He'd become adept at keeping to the shadows, but that did not mean he was proud of it. His suitcase was clutched tightly in his left hand, knuckles white from fear.
“Helps with the salty air from the gulf, too, but it still lets the wildlife come and go. Took a few tries, but we finally figured it out.”
With each whispered word, the tree emanates a pulse of golden light, and its leaves tremble in a phantom breeze. Timid confidence surfaces above Draco’s anxiety, stilling the crash of waves to calmer waters.
“All right, how long to get to Volchii?”
“Explain, Potter.”
“What about you?” Harry settles on the stool across from Draco.
Potter narrows his eyes before he shrugs, turning to grab a greasy paper bag from the bench inside the workshop. He shoves the bag into Draco’s chest as he steps outside, closing the door behind him.
“Pretty amazing, isn’t it?” Potter asks when he realizes Draco’s stopped.
“McGonagall helped?”
“Ah, yes. Mortal peril, your favorite pastime: reduced to a fond memory.”
“Yes, no need to continue. I’d like to see them,” Draco affirms. He pauses only briefly before curiosity overwhelms his self-control. “So, why do this if you think it’s so boring?”
“That’s what fur is for.” Harry laughs and shakes his hair out, splattering droplets across the kitchen floor.
Harry laughs, and his arm shakes with his uneven breaths. Draco adjusts his grip and narrows his gaze at Harry, a warning to keep still.
Draco earned good marks; that’s undeniable. But any elation in his success had quickly deflated whenever a patient declined his care or demanded to see his forearm. His shoulder still twinges at the memory of a particularly nasty Stinging Hex he’d caught from a demented ex-Auror last semester.
Harry Potter is standing in front of him, halfway around the world, wearing an ungodly checkered coat and mumbling about wheel chains. The ridiculousness of it all almost makes Draco laugh, but his voice fails him, an immobile lump at the base of his throat.
Between his musings, he had formed a long list of worst-case scenarios and possible solutions for good measure.
“I remember.”
“How’s the core?” Draco asks softly, turning to Harry.
Instead, Draco clamps his eyes shut, wrings his hands in his lap, and focuses on the conscious effort required to fill his lungs with the bitter cold air. He sees nothing but the teasing hint of light visible from the inside of his eyelids.
“Meg was right; hanging on to that shit is too much work,” Harry says concretely. “Not to mention, I don’t really like to think about the past much. I’d think if anyone would understand that, it would be you.”
“Not true.” Harry distorts his voice, reminiscent of a deranged house-elf, to continue, “The words are out in the world, ne’er to be forgotten.”
he is…” Draco scowls because, of course, Potter would have told them all about his heroism and selflessness and bravery. They probably think he shits Galleons.
“Of course wizards can still get heart disease. We’re not elves, Potter.”
“Well, that’s pretty clear, Potter,” Draco mutters. He wills his face into an expression of apathy and hopes the heat in his cheeks doesn’t betray the panic that bubbles in his chest.
It’s a strange feeling, aimlessly following Potter into the wilderness. It stirs memories of a haunting figure and a dying unicorn in the Forbidden Forest, putting Draco’s nerves on edge.
Why is it that even after all of these years, Potter is still capable of completely derailing Draco’s judgment, simply by existing? He’s hardly said a word to Draco since he arrived, and yet he has Draco re-mapping his entire life to avoid studying with the prick for a few months.
Harry rises from the couch and practically skips over the wooden floorboards towards the back of the hall. His joggers stretch over his bum, drawing Draco’s line of sight.
“Gaps?” Draco interrupts.
“Fair enough.” Harry shrugs. “Although I believe I’ve just received two compliments in one morning. Are you feeling okay?” Harry lightly brushes Draco’s calf as he swings his legs under the table. It makes Draco’s skin burn, but he pointedly attributes it to the heat of the room.
“But it says it’s half four.”
Draco wonders how intoxicated Muggles would get all the way out here without getting mauled by a bear. He thinks it best not to argue, so he takes Fee’s hand and answers, “Draco.”
“Sure?” Draco was honest, painfully so, and all Potter thought it warranted was
“Put your wand down, Malfoy,” Potter laughs. “It’ll be fine, trust me.”
“I’ll do no such—”
“Do you know how to put a seatbelt on?” Potter asks, clearly annoyed.
“I don’t see it… We don’t even know what temperature or what tree would be optimal to begin with. How do we even think about meddling with alterations?”
at her lavender robes.
“I see your rebellious ways have waned a tad since school.”
“Done. That’s pathetic, by the way. They’re from Liverpool, you know?”
“I think you’ve got the wood collection down. Next step is the core, which is kind of one step, but also kind of two,” Harry explains as he snaps his finger, kindling the fire under the cauldron. The flames spark and dance at the encouragement of his magic, engulfing the iron in a fiery crown.
Draco exhales a cloud of breath. “Actually, it is. But why go to all the trouble and still let snow in?”
“It won’t bite,” Potter scoffs. He leans back to allow a waitress to direct a hovering set of paper placemats and napkin-wrapped silverware onto the table.
“Let me finish; I’m just getting started. I know you were too afraid to look me in the face when you returned my wand.” The heated glow of Potter’s cheeks and clench of his fists is all the incentive Draco needs to press on. “I know you dropped out of Auror training and all about how you mucked it up with the Weasley girl before you fucked off to the edge of the world.” Draco holds firm, despite Ginny never really talking about Potter since she started dating Pansy several years back. In fact, Draco had no idea she’d visited him over Christmas.
“Hello, Harry and Draco! Rory got some fireworks from Juneau today. Come see! We’ve got hot chocolate.”
“What kind of mess do you think she’s talking about?” Draco asks, his mind supplying him with a plethora of unpleasant possibilities.
“The Beatles? No?” Harry asks with eyebrows raised.
“Well, we can’t all be impulsive Gryffindors with impeccable gut instincts, can we?” Draco asks as Harry meets his gaze. Caught staring, Draco coughs and continues, “Some of us like to ask
Gryffindor in the best way he knows how.
“I’m sure you would’ve been fine without me.”
“What do you mean
Draco can only stand, dumbfounded and tightly gripping the spirals of his journal. Panic starts to stir in his chest, drawing forth a cold sweat on his brow.
“Merlin, no.” Potter actually laughs at the suggestion. He clears his throat before explaining, “This is the student I was telling you about. Rory, meet Draco Malfoy.”
“Morning,” Potter mutters.
She circles the counter and hops up to sit next to the register, showing off the holes in her jeans.
“Thanks. I like to teach, so it’s good to hear that I’m
Draco shoves his hands in the pockets of his coat and glances at Volchii’s main street. Their argument has drawn a bit of attention. A handful of spectators unashamedly gawk at the small-town spectacle, their faces shrouded behind their visible puffs of breath.
Out of the corner of his eye, a set of headlights grows brighter through a shower of snow flurries as they creep their way up the airport access road. The vehicle stops in front of the building, casting a blinding glare across the window. Draco looks around and finds himself alone in the so-called
The smile that Potter flashes him nearly makes Draco lose his breath. Draco forgot just how charming that smile used to be, how magnetic of a force
It’s a casual touch and means nothing, especially since Harry doesn’t look like Harry. But the contact makes Draco’s heart leap nonetheless.
Potter doesn’t speak another word as he reaches across the car to pull the opposite door handle. The door falls open, and Potter turns to look at Draco with a defeated expression. Draco doesn’t move, putting forth every effort to project confidence as his nervous system frantically debates the merits of getting in the car versus spending the night on the icy pavement. Impatient, Potter widens his eyes and cocks an eyebrow, challenging Draco to turn down the invitation. Far too proud when it comes to Potter, Draco sighs and knows he can’t turn back now.
Harry kicks at a stick and sends it tumbling down the mountainside. “Umm, one ingredient. One line of a recipe.”
“Did you bring anything less… formal?” Potter asks as he casts the charm over Draco’s loafers.
No, it’s not the work that will be a problem.
“May? Is everything all right?”
“Is there a use for a
His responses to the uncontrollable.
Oddly enough, Draco feels comfortable around this girl who had a wand pointed at his face not five minutes ago. Perhaps she does emit a
“Potter and I are… not new acquaintances,” Draco says as he pushes off the counter. “Why am I telling you this anyway?”
or some shit. Anyway, it’s a lot of roast beef.”
Potter chuckles and runs a hand through his hair. “It’s hockey. Like Muggle Quidditch.”
for wands.”
“I don’t think that’s true, but I don’t have the energy or will to argue about it.”
Draco nods and takes a deep breath, kindling his confidence. He proceeds seamlessly through the extraction charms and ends with a handful of solid pieces, pulsing with magic.
be done, and Draco is perfectly equipped to complete it. However, the idea of who he must complete it
Harry grimaces. “No. And it wasn’t for lack of trying.”
“I know, I know. Calm down,” Harry says and leans against the workbench. He crosses his arms, stretching the fabric of his shirt over his broad shoulders. “But, honestly, the details like this aren’t easy for me. You may be surprised to hear this, but patience doesn’t come naturally to me.”
“Well, good morning, darlin’. You look like you’re in a mood.” A plump and cheery middle-aged bartender shuffles towards their booth. Crow’s feet rest at the corners of their warm brown eyes, and their salt and pepper hair is pulled back into a low braid at the base of their neck. A frayed and stained apron covers their green button-down shirt and blue jeans.
“You can start by lowering your wand,” Draco says, raising his hands in surrender. “Is this how you greet customers on this continent?”
“It’s a simple question. And I told you why I’m here; it’s only fair that you offer the same honesty,” he points out, willing his face into the perfect picture of serenity as his heart races behind his ribs.
"It tastes disgusting," Draco said. "Yet also somehow delicious."
A/N: So, I was going to wait a little longer to post this chapter, make it a regular with another week, but it feels too much like the second half of Chapter 10 for me to wait that long. So, have it a little early! Hope you enjoy.
Draco scowled. He was in a bad enough mood as it was. The pain of his bruised belly had eased somewhat throughout the day, but a knotted ball of malcontent in his belly had replaced it. Fucking Ipetsky. Fuck him and all of his skills as a photographer. Draco didn't even know the man, but he hated him, and a part of him knew it wasn't solely because of his interpretation of Harry's barely perceivable response.
Draco peered down at him, eyeing him with a slight frown even as his hand began a gentle caress through Harry's hair. "Meaning what?"
"Are you enjoying your holiday?"
"If you'll follow me this way, then," Clementine said, breaking into his thoughts. "Despite any inclinations we might share for talking the morning away, time waits for no witch."
Silence met his words. Silence that extended for so long, so uncharacteristic of what Harry had grown to know of Draco, that he opened his eyes once more. When he did, it was to find Draco regarding him with a slight frown that was far from unfamiliar to Harry. The frown of interest, consideration, and calculation. The only difference between this and every other time that Draco had worn such an expression when Harry was performing a magic trick was the dawning sense of… wonder?
The flame above his palm disappeared, but it didn't matter. The sound of faintly squeaking hinges that replaced it had never sounded so beautiful.
But the rest…
"He's too indignant to hear you," Hermione said, smirking at Harry. She did drop her hand to rest atop his socked feet in a somewhat affectionate manner, however.
In the warm company of his two best friends, though, he could hide those fears. He could admit that he was sad but also excited. That he would definitely be returning and no, Jackie was not abruptly entitled to all of his belongings. He almost believed himself, too.
"Right. Want me to call you back?"
"'Not really' my arse," Harry said shaking his head, but he let it slide.
His nerves were so tightly strung, his senses so pricked and attentive, that Draco nearly tore his wand out of his pocket as the tall bald man extracted his own. He was relieved that he managed not to as the man simply conjured a pair of chairs that looked distinctly more comfortable than Draco and Pansy's.
It wasn't the first time they'd shared a bed. What had become a habit of sharing Draco's seat directly had evolved into sharing a mattress, sharing space, sharing the protective cocoon of the canopy curtains and their Silencing Charm that no one else in the dormitory seemed to make use of anymore. But this was different. Very different
"I don't know, maybe 'cause my eyesight is 'so bad'?"
Draco glanced up at him and his smile returned. It was even a little wider this time. He fell back to his meal a moment later, humming contentedly to himself with each bite as though he was reassessing his judgement with every mouthful.
Harry had learnt from experience. He'd learnt that it was necessary to dance and dodge his way through every interview, every attack from the paparazzi with their vehement questions flung his way. He'd learnt to keep an eye on any public room he attended, to be wary of eavesdroppers, because more than one story had been snatched unwittingly from him for such carelessness.
Jill left with a wave, Abel on her heels, and with a nudge, Jackie urged Harry into motion. Dragging a pair of chairs after him, they tucked their seats in the corner.
"Do you…?"
Except that she wasn't.
Draco, the bastard, smirked. "
His jerking hips and riding motion had abruptly stopped, but though Harry swam through a haze of pleasure, he was all too aware of Draco still thrusting beneath him with increasingly erratic jerks. Thrusts that pushed into him, grazing across the quivering mass of sensations and sparking them alight in an almost painful clamour. Steadying himself with one hand on Draco's chest, gasping in a desperate bid for breath that seemed to have abandoned him, Harry opened his eyes to the sight of Draco's flushed face, his eyes still open and fixed upon Harry's but expression wrought in a mask of his own pleasure that Harry had never seen before but knew instinctively. Even through the buffeting aftermath of orgasm, the stuttering hitch of his heartbeat and the unexpected heaviness of his limbs, Harry reasserted himself enough to push back further onto Draco just a little more, to push him just enough.
answer, his pause grew a little longer.
It was strange, because such attempts always happened near
"How the bloody hell are you starving after eating your weight in jellybeans?"
"Worried. Yeah, I got that, Mum."
capable." With a raise of his hand and an age-old flourish, Harry produced a handkerchief from thin air and snapped it in Draco's face. It was a simple trick, one he hadn't used in years, but muscle memory flowing into action without a hitch. Draco flinched away from him, eyes widening.
What had gone wrong, Harry didn't know. What he'd said that had apparently upset Draco so badly, he couldn't discern. Harry was left to follow after Draco, to stare at the tight line of Draco's shoulders and feel disappointment and confusion deteriorate into annoyance and aggravation with each step. Even worse was that Draco didn't reply. That in itself was uncharacteristic of him. Draco always rose to the challenge.
Maybe that was it? Draco could stop at anytime, but it wouldn't be that bad. It wouldn't end anything else. It wouldn't
"But?" Calliope prompted.
It was all just practice. All simply sleight of hand, tricks of the light, and habit so ingrained that sometimes Harry didn't even realise he did it. He barely thought of the
Right then, abusing the likely disgruntled Malfoy to the best of his incapacitated ability, Harry was more than happy to stay put. He was… surprisingly comfortable. Almost comfortable enough to sleep. Curling in upon himself, legs unconsciously tucking, Harry decided that was a very good idea.
"After exams, maybe. With everyone being as stressed as they are, I can't imagine the atmosphere would be conducive to open-mindedness. Maybe directly in the aftermath, when the entirety of our grade is riding on a euphoric, liberated high."
Draco barely noticed it leave. He regarded the letter distastefully for a moment, considered exploding his table in an effort to avoid what was to come, then revised his decision. He'd only just managed to toss a Muffling Charm at the door, the windows, the walls, when the letter began to shudder, steam and hiss, and he snapped the wax seal.
Hermione opened her mouth to reply, but before she could, a ping sounded from Harry's microwave and seemingly in the same second Ginny was draping herself over the back of the couch once more, cradling her steaming bowl in hand. She grinned wolfishly again as she stuck her fork into the salad. "You'll never guess, Harry."
"Not fussy?" the girl said, her nostrils flaring slightly.
That no one in the room so much as twitched was very telling.
"You've had a good day today. Don't spoil it."
Harry paused in step at the top of the stairwell and took the proffered shake. Ron followed Hermione's lead a moment later. "Harry," he said.
"So, you actually like Potions? It's not just because it was taken by Snape?"
"Yes. So don't mess it up. Show them what you've got."
Pansy clicked her tongue sharply. "There are a few hopefuls. Some even have sufficient experience. But nothing particularly standout, and you know how much I like standouts."
"The Apparation, the tricks, the sleight of hand that was always more than that." Draco shook his head. "I should have pieced it together before this. The powder was a nice touch by the way."
Draco laughed. The sound was a little exasperated, a little breathless, and felt infinitely better to Harry's ears than the detached, flat words he'd voiced in their brief period of separation. As did the way Draco tightened his arms even further and returned his forehead to Harry's shoulder.
would be boring. The show with the magician guy will be awesome. Even better if you challenge him to a trick-off."
"Are you -?"
"I've always found to be, yes," Pansy replied, flashing a smirk over her shoulder. "This is the difference between the good and the best in the industry."
"Don't you?"
"Wait, so –?"
"Will you be alright to Apparate home by yourself?" Draco asked as they drew into the quiet seclusion of a building's shadow.
"I don't care." Draco nudged his shoulder against Harry's. "Really, Harry, I don't. It doesn't concern me."
"Lily, I –"
"Shut up, you wanker," he muttered, and Draco laughed. It was wonderfully pleasant to hear when it happened so rarely of late, and Harry found he didn't even care that it was at his expense.
"Don't give me away, Sirius," Harry called back. "Go back to playing with your nephew."
Draco stayed frozen. A moment of tension, uncomfortable to sit upon – or maybe the discomfort came from Harry; he couldn't be sure – seized him momentarily before Harry felt a slow, long inhalation vibrate through his shoulder.
"Does Ipetsky know?"
"Really? I bet you're incredible. You've got the hands for it."
"How long ago was this?" Harry was surprised he hadn't heard of it, especially if it was only fairly recent.
"Thanks," Harry said with a smirk.
Draco sat up from his textbook. He lowered his quill, frowned at the wrap with lips drawing to the side, before plucking it from Harry's hand. At the same time, he reached his other hand towards him, hooking his arm around Harry's waist and pulling him towards him.
Michael Corner, who had loudly exclaimed from his old Hufflepuff table that 'nothing and no one could tell him what to do', and that he saw attendance was a show of disloyalty for anyone to have abandoned Hogwarts that year. The Patil twins, shoulder to shoulder, hard-faced in a way that Harry had never seen of them before. Terry Boot and Sue Li, Susan Bones and Justin Finch-Fletchley. So many were in company that Harry hadn't expected more for their number than for who they were.
"Can I see you tomorrow?" Harry found himself asking, just as he had each preceding day when they parted. He'd stopped feeling quite so embarrassed after the first three times.
"You'll come back, though," Jill said before Jackie could utter with continued vehemence. She gave Harry a gentle squeeze. "Even with everything you're going to learn and everyone who'll be learning with you, you'll still come back to us, won't you?"
"Nothing much," Harry said. "It's just…"
"No, it's not," Draco said. "What if it's because of me that she knew where you were at all? It's possible. She
Cruciatus
Frowning, Harry nodded.
"I'm thinking something with lots of chocolate and a potential food baby in the making."
"Not real magic."
She had him on that. Out of everyone, despite her gentleness, Jill had been through many a social battle and knew how to take kindness and amicability with a grain of salt. She knew only too well how others could treat people like herself, like Harry and Jackie, and she would never put herself in a situation that deliberately tempted such a risk. Harry could only concede to her decision. Where her receptiveness to Blaise's company had come from Harry didn't know, but when he considered it… he supposed that Jill had been smiling a lot that evening. Maybe he'd missed something, being so caught up in his own love story.
Draco didn't reply.
Harry blinked. Then he almost snorted at himself and his train of thought. Ginny and her suggestions were putting ideas into his head. As if he hadn't been contemplating Draco and the strangeness of their relationship, of Draco's shoot, and of the words that continued to echo in his mind enough already. He truly hadn't considered the prospect as more than a passing thought, a recognition of attractiveness, until Ginny had elaborated on it. But when he thought about it…
The lines of muscle in his back were loose but still dense, distinct enough that Harry's fingers had something to cling to.
"You're fat."
What was he doing? Who was he with? What was he thinking? Harry had never considered Draco in such a light before, but then, he'd never had the need to. They'd always been at verbal – and sometimes physical – blows, or it had been… something else. Something more than that, an unexpected relief and comfort that Harry had found in the most unlikely of places, and then something else again.
When they finally pulled apart, icy air flooding the narrow space between them, Harry couldn't quite bring himself to step back. Draco didn't move immediately either, his hand clasping Harry's, and Harry thought that his grasp was infinitely warmer than the knitted gloves that covered his fingers.
he thought. Pleaded. Begged of himself, or someone, anyone.
"And make sure to call me this time."
He wasn't worth the air he breathed, and so on and so forth.
Draco laughed. Not a smirk but a proper laugh, eyes crinkling and teeth flashing. "It would be my pleasure."
Not even stupidly good-looking ones, with perfectly coifed hair, and aquiline features, and a certain way of holding their chin that made them look somehow regal. Draco was still a prat.
Harry smiled as James fumbled through unnecessary gratitude and platitudes, assurances that "yes, dear, you're wonderful" and "yes, I'm a terrible influence". Shaking his head, he tugged the last knot of his laces and straightened, slinging his bag from its seat beside the doorway as he did so.
Harry should have been offended. A part of him even was a little, though that part was lost before the bland, forward manner of the woman seated across from him as she raised a hand and adjusted the wire frames of her thin, rectangular glasses. "I, um…" He began, then shrugged awkwardly. "Well, I can't say I exactly have much interest in it. I don't ask for the interviews, and the photographers just seem to find me, so…"
"You sure sound like it," Harry muttered, ducking his head to avoid the frown Von shot him. He couldn't begrudge him his resentment. Not really. If Harry could have his way, he'd demand Von be his sole stylist all the time. Even after years of exposure, it was a still a little bit disconcerting to have strangers fussing over him with clinical proficiency.
"I'm not so sure about that," Draco said, pinning Harry with a stare. Surely he couldn't be
The Hogwarts uniforms, though – there was apparently some meaning behind the colour discrepancy. Ron and Hermione wore red and yellow – or gold, as Ron had said, though the distinction was miniscule at best – which likely meant something too.
"What, because it's so hard to make it over the Channel? I just caught an earlier trip."
Harry listened as Ron continued in an over-bright tone. He thanked him silently, just as he always did of his friends, that they were so removed from the mania that was Harry Potter. In the craze that had afflicted his world, it was exactly what he needed.
"Keep an ear out," Harry said, then turned on his heel and dove back into the riot of students. He fought the urge to glance over his shoulder as he made his way back to his friends to be met by their open surprise. In Ron's case, it was open-mouthed surprise.
"Thank you," Harry said.
With a trembling hand, Harry clamped his fingers over the slice running down his arm. It stung, throbbing with his heartbeat. Warm blood pumped from the wound, and that was terrifying in a whole new way. What if he kept bleeding? What if the cut got infected? Lip trembling despite his teeth clamping into it, Harry stared down at his arm turned invisible in the darkness.
"Is that why you decided not to go to Hogsmeade today?"
"You have a lot of confidence in him," Draco said.
For a moment Harry hadn't the foggiest idea what Draco was talking about. Then understanding dawned. "Draco, that's different."
"Hey, I grew up with Dad –"
"Oh, I caught you before you left? That's good."
"Or is this an outlet for you losing your shit?"
"Yes. Yes, it's probably good timing, though I'll admit a part of me begrudges the opportunities missed. But those opportunities will just as likely put you unfavourably in the spotlight and potentially lead to incidents that are better avoided. You're right; Chosen One Fever lingers at the moment."
"That's what you're worried about? With all the feelings and whatnot. Does it help?" Ron didn't wait for Harry to reply before hastening into further assurances. "Because you know everyone would be totally supporting you to get over that weird Muggle mentality. All of us, and especially Ginny, even if she used to date you."
"You decided, you mean."
"Yes, he did."
Had he flown or taken a portkey, as he'd said he would?
Yet Harry didn't dwell on that. He couldn't bring himself to, what with the prickle that still itched his skin and the pervasive need to turn towards Draco, to touch him, to express somehow how what he'd said meant something. Something big yet inexplicable. Something that was different to how it felt when Jackie spoke in their defence, or Jill stepped in, or his parents seethed and defended in the face of family and strangers alike.
. He tightened his arms around himself. Why did space and aloneness hit him so hard lately? It was so stupid of him.
"Nothing bad."
"No," he muttered, plucking at a blade of grass. "Not this year."
"Yeah. I know. You've told me."
There was only so much avoiding and evading he could take. Harry just wanted a break.
Harry swallowed again. He knew his own cheeks were flushed, and likely even more than Draco's. Was he nervous? Undoubtedly. But he intended to go through with their plans for that night nonetheless. That was, unless, "Do you want me to stop?"
"You could say that. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is still fresh enough in many peoples' minds today and drives many Muggle-Wizarding relations. I believe it's responsible for a good portion of the Secrecy Act Amendments, for that matter."
Which was why it was strange when his mouth opened and words started spilling forth.
Another whimper passed through his fingers, and Harry couldn't even think to stifle it properly. He didn't care, was too fixated upon the image from a horror movie that was so present, so real, he swore he could smell the blood and rotting skin itself. Or at least he didn't care until the creak of movement across the room drew his attention.
"What are you talking about?" Harry had tried to ask, though his voice was almost lost beneath its own feebleness.
They were led into a back room with a bar as thinly veiled with smoke as the foyer. Crystal glasses clinked as drinks were offered 'as befit the tour' though with the exclusion of certain minors, much to Blaise's muffled protestations. Another corridor, a glimpse into a room of props and displays, the tour guide's sweeping flourish as he bared an elaborately painted box that had once held women as they were 'cut into pieces'. Pansy liked that one in particular.
"You could say that," Harry murmured. He closed his eyes when Simon, cigarette captured between his fingers, reached towards him and grazed a finger down the side of his face. The smell of smoke wasn't particularly tasteful, but Harry could overlook it.
Not even Draco believed his own thoughts. He doubted he would have been particularly convincing to anyone if they asked how he felt about Harry's defensiveness. Draco could defend himself, had clawed his way into becoming a photographer in a hateful world, and he could stand on his own two feet. But he didn't think he could convincingly deny that Harry standing up for him – it really meant something. It meant something bigger than Draco knew what to make of.
Jackie had exhausted every jellybean in her inventory by the time they clambered from the car. "Finally, freedom!" she shouted, though her voice was almost lost beneath the sound of the city.
. Just like that. It was so typical of Harry, to notice and immediately step in, that Draco almost laughed. A sound that definitely wasn't a laugh slipped from his lips, and his embarrassment only hitched further.
"Is that the one with the woman and her baby?" Pansy asked.
Jill nodded. "Sure. Abel could probably use the company if you're all working in pairs, anyway."
Soft touches that tightened until they were practically clinging. Gentle, almost awed kisses that became heavier, thicker, wet and a mess of tongue and sucking lips. Harry had kissed people before, had shared many kisses, and yet this felt somehow different. The experience lay on a bed of routine, of habitual contact, and played practiced chords while somehow producing a tune that sounded entirely different.
"Oh." Harry blinked, but it didn't help much. "That's good. I think I'm drunk."
He really was interested. Harry's hold tightened on his bag as he coaxed himself to loosen his hold on that rather surprising discovery. "Since I was a kid," he said, deliberately failing to admit that he'd ceased any kind of practise years ago.
"And nice to you," Jackie reminded her. Jill only smiled.
That same flush of chilling not-quite anger cascaded through Harry when he'd seen Draco being beaten to a pulp. When he'd caught sight of the witch and wizard tearing him bloody not with their wands but with their fists, like primal beasts thirsting for the scent and the taste of blood. Harry hadn't used an aggressive or even defensive spell for a long time, but magic rose at his beck and call instantly and leapt forth.
"Jackie, I literally just saw you for the first time today about ten minutes ago."
"Hm." Dimitri drew his gaze up and down Draco once more. From anyone else, Draco might have found such assessment disconcerting or even solicitous, but Dimitri was purely thoughtful. "You've got the look for it, certainly."
Harry nodded.
Harry shrugged. "There's not a whole lot of space anywhere else." Sliding a leg over the bench, he spared a glance for Zabini at his other side. "Unless you object?"
"How did you know?" he asked quietly.
"They're Muggles, Draco. Muggles."
Which he was, Draco supposed. More at home than he'd been in a whole year.
"Yes?" Draco asked, pausing alongside him and cocking his head.
"Harry! Fuck, Harry, are you -? Talk to me, stay awake, are you -?"
Harry rolled his eyes. "You don't need to be so skeptical. He's a top bloke."
"Oh, for goodness sake, James, let him through," Lily said from behind him. A moment later and she appeared at his shoulder, her smile calm and easy in a way that James could never manage. Harry's father had always worn his heart on his sleeve. "Can we talk to you for a minute, sweetheart?"
he was seeing.
"You kind of sulk," Remus said from his side, nibbling through his own chip-sandwich.
"I know you have," Harry had replied. "This is the third time you've asked me."
Remus chuckled, squeezing his fingers. "Yes, it certainly could have."
It wasn't the first time she'd said those words, totally unrelated to the conversation at hand. It was closer to the tenth repeat. Harry ignored her just as he had the previous nine times, and so did everyone else. "Jill says that, but she's got a weird habit of always ordering a pepperoni pizza," he told Blaise. "I don't know why."
It was all Draco's fault. Again. And Harry would act just as he had – again – in a heartbeat. He wasn't sure if it was a good thing or not that he would, but his decisiveness? That was unshakeable.
Draco was silent for a beat before, "No."
"But I mean it. Seriously, do you have any idea how many times I would have killed to have a spell to clean up mess? Especially stuff I, you know, didn't want my mum seeing."
"That wasn't exactly what I was talking about," Draco interrupted him again. "But no. Thank you anyway, but no. It's fine."
"Does Mal –
But by half a week, the safe isolation of his flat had grown stifling. There was only so much daytime television he could watch, only so many books he could flick through, and only so much time he could spent in front of his clunky but serviceable computer in the throes of editing. Draco needed to get out – to the dark rooms of Building Eight, or to the mall rich with Muggles and supermarkets. Even to the footpath outside so that he could breathe the outside air from more than the living room window.
With a flick of his wrist, Harry set to spinning his pen between his fingers in a flying pattern that Draco had once called magic. It wasn't, merely took practice and dexterity, but Harry made a point of performing whenever he had the chance.
"Unless you –" Jackie began.
"Jackie's actually allergic to reading anything but gore," he said lightly. "I worked that out years ago."
"But then how -? How are you going to get -?" Harry cut himself off with a shake of his head. Why did he care? It shouldn't concern him with what Draco was doing here. It shouldn't be his problem if he'd missed his bus and may not have any way of returning to his school. Harry didn't know exactly where Hogwarts was, except that it was over the Scottish border. That was at least a decent length drive away, wasn't it?
Discomforted though he was, Harry couldn't help but smile slightly at Draco's use of his name. Would that ever not feel weird? Or would it fade when his own lingering feelings of weirdness over using Draco's name did?
It was neglect. It was abandonment. Blaise had it, had been utterly self-sufficient in the face of his mother's careless pursuit of her own endeavours, but he'd at least had the provisions to presentably support himself. House elves were a part and parcel of pureblood households. Harry had the same feeling as Blaise, but he wore the signs of that neglect in his clothing, his emaciation, and in the way he all but jumped when Malkin addressed him.
He was quite well and truly whipped. It was a good thing, then, that Draco had, for whatever reason, silently accepted their abrupt promotion into boyfriends. The suddenness, the unexpectedness, and the sheer wonder of that fact still left Harry floored sometimes, and never more so than when Draco reached for his hand and clasped it in his own.
's headquarters. The hallways were wide and sleek, the elevator just as much and large enough to avoid more than the occasional brushing of shoulders with other passengers. The prevalence of windows, providing frequent panoramic views of the lake and the township at the bottom of the cliff the hotel-office perched upon, made those hallways seem larger still. Even the dining area – an actual dining area that looked more like a restaurant than a cafeteria – hosted a wall made purely of glass much like the reception several storeys above. It must have been magically insulated, for despite the winter that lightly frosted the windows, the restaurant wasn't cold, but that was the only artificiality about the room. The sight beyond was entirely real.
Just as much, the questions were horrible in that Harry relieved each moment he never wanted to consider again. How terrified he'd been, and how the terror hadn't quite left him. How he'd thought he was going to die, that he would never escape and that Bellatrix would kill him. That he'd never be able to see his family and friends again, never get to apologise for being an utter jerk as the last thing his parents had seen of him.
still seemed to treat his words like nuggets of gold, even months after the war.
Readying himself in the studio, the company of only his two designated crewman that he'd barely bothered to learn the names of in dutiful attendance, Draco felt the tension that always gripped him slowly, incrementally easing from his shoulders. Even walking through
"And you're going with…?"
"Actually, you can't. I don't know the science behind it but I'm pretty sure there's something in the genes that stops it. The chromosome numbers or something. I did actually learn something in fifth form science, you know. Besides, you're forgetting the mechanics of it, because I'm pretty sure when you compare a horse and a bloody bird –"
he thought, almost shivering at the foreboding that settled a little more heavily in his gut.
Glancing towards Draco, his reply died on his lips as he watched Draco draw alongside the table. He placed his own lunch on the table before fiddling briefly with the camera hanging around his neck and take a slight step towards the window. Impassivity swirled in a juxtaposing mix with his concentration, the slight crease on his brow that Harry had witnessed throughout the shooting that day and then before, with his own shoots, the only interruption of his mask. He watched as Draco took a handful of snaps before lowering the camera and frowning instead down at the screen as he flicked through it.
Harry laughed into the fold of his arms, but it didn't last long, sighing into silence almost immediately. Maybe he was a feeling down that evening, but he wouldn't distract Draco to alleviate it a little. Priorities lay where they did, and since Harry had come to properly understand just what kind of distraction climbing into Draco's lap created – it wasn't fair. "Yeah, well, sitting in your way and distracting you won't make it any easier for you."
"You've got to be kidding me," Harry said, turning to each of his parents, each of his uncles, in turn. "All of this. Everything that's been… that you've… and that I've…"
Harry didn't move. He couldn't reach for it even as the dryness of his tongue demanded it of him, pleaded that he reach for the water. He couldn't look away from her, standing over him, her hands planted on her hips, and all but glaring.
Dot was a short woman. Short, thin and spindly like a cricket, yet emanating ferocity. The lines upon her face demanded respect and recognition rather than skepticism for her age, and the grey touching her hair was more a regal crown than a symbol of deterioration. Dot was, in short, a force to be reckoned with, and every aspect of her, from her severe bun to the fitted suit she always wore, emphasised just that.
