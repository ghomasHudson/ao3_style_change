"I'm… busy," Draco said, deciding to ignore the fact that Weasley was now talking about him as if he wasn't there. "I have more important things to do than watch people who don't want my help." He sniffed as if he had really been offended.
"Shall we go up?" Weasley asked and Harry nodded.
"He's not."
was the cause of all their problems.
"Who'd want to kill Slughorn," George answered, his face contorting as if he couldn't imagine someone going through all that effort on Slughorn. Harry couldn’t exactly blame him.
At all.
"It's this room that can be anything you want it to be," Lovegood answered, her eyes drifting dreamily. "One time, I was in desperate need of a nap-."
"Draco," Lupin turned to him, wearing that same determined expression he'd worn when he'd been saying he was only trying to help. And again, Draco didn't know what to do. He couldn't actually
Severus was, in Harry's opinion, being overly sensitive when it came to Lucius. It would've been better if they could've relied on Lucius, but Severus was firm that he not know anything, and it wasn't Harry's place to go against him, no matter how much he disapproved.
"Do you have a deadline, Severus?" Dumbledore asked, and still he didn't sound particularly concerned.
"Because I didn't have anywhere to go." Another lie, but the truth came with too many questions and too many answers that Harry couldn’t know. Harry just sighed and turned away.
“What about Harry and me?” Draco asked. He leaned his elbows onto the table, his chin tilted up towards where Woods was standing across the room. “Couldn’t you put me on the stand to talk about us?”
"Well," Potter said, stretching his arms forward and up and then standing. "This was exciting and all, but I do have other things to be doing…" Draco stood to follow him, having no intention of staying in that office with Remus Lupin and Dumbledore by himself.
Did I say two weeks... I meant three. *sigh*
"Harry," Granger interrupted again. "We're just trying to help. You have to know Malfoy isn't good for you." Harry laughed at her, low and bitter, and Granger flinched. Good.
"My boy-."
When they'd been in the library last night, and for once they'd both been studying, Draco had tried to ask what Harry's problem was, but he had made it very clear he wasn't about to talk about it. And as much as it bothered Draco, the dark look in the back of Harry's eyes told him not to push his luck.
"Hmm."
Lucius' eyes flicked up to his, his grey eyes catching Severus'. And it was so different from last time, when he'd been drunk and in the throws of passion. Lucius looked… affectionate.
"I don't care about any of that," he repeated, and he felt like he was on the edge of a cliff, getting ready to jump and having no idea whether Harry would be there to catch him or not. "I love you, and I want you. Not Blaise."
"Mr. Malfoy, are you su—"
It didn't take much longer to reach the surface after that, Squid and Horcrux free. They collapsed onto the Lakeside, the first year Slytherin sprawled between them, shaking and crying and muttering as Lucius stroked down her back soothingly. Sprout was there in the next second, casting a drying spell on them and yanking the Slytherin up toward her as Severus exchanged a look with Lucius.
part?" Malfoy scowled at him; Harry turned back to him, tilting his head curiously.
"You can’t blame Harry for Sirius' death," Draco said, his voice slow, angry.
"And the staring, what was that about?"
It was more comforting that he was willing to admit, but it was also scarier. Scary enough that he had to bite his lip and turn away before the promise could slip past. Draco just sighed and let him go when he moved away.
have been so attractive.
Draco hung his head, sitting in the chair Severus had put beside the bed. Severus had barely said anything to him, merely looking over Harry's wounds, forcing a potion down his throat, and telling Draco that he would be fine before looking over Draco himself—as if he mattered after what he'd done.
Madame Pomfrey's eyes had widened when she'd seen him. She'd pointed her wand at him, reaching between his legs to assess the damage and he'd lost it. He'd screamed—not sane screaming either. Horrible, disembodied screaming that came from deep in his chest and echoed through the infirmary and down the hall. Severus had taken him away immediately, glaring at Pomfrey as if the whole thing had been her fault. He'd calmed down as soon as they made it to Severus' private rooms, breathing the familiar scent and pushing the pain away as Severus examined him while touching him as little as possible.
been a while since he'd had water. He was sure it was just a sugar imbalance.
Harry bit his lip, sliding onto the couch next to Draco. As if it wasn't enough to have to be here, now he had to remember the one thing he promised himself he'd forget. But looking at Draco's face, the eyes cold and turned away from him, it was impossible to ignore.
He hadn't been able to take it. He'd been weak, and he'd begged Cedric to forgive him as he'd drawn the cutting curse across his wrists. He'd been drowning for so long, and he was so tired of trying to stay above the water.
"Ouch," the man laughed, stalking closer.
to be doing over the school year, the things he’d agreed to just by being here, just by letting Dumbledore into his house. Harry would never want someone like Draco to take his virginity.
a good reason; he knew he did. He'd thought it through. But suddenly looking into Severus' dark eyes, it didn't seem near good enough. "You were running the school, and I needed to hurry, and I didn't want to leave Draco here during a full moon without one of us nearby."
"Then why are we here?" Harry asked, his voice unintentionally sharp.
"Why would he know something like that?" Lucius sighed, standing to the side as Severus knocked on Lupin's door for the second time. They waited another couple of minutes before Severus pulled out his wand.
Harry's body tightened, and he cried out, cum shooting down Draco's throat without warning. Luckily, Draco didn't seem too surprised. He just swallowed calmly, before sitting up and looking down at Harry with an unreadable expression.
"Why does…?" Draco trailed off, staring. And then the anger broke in him. It broke and flew out of him with a strangled blast of magic that sailed through his skin. He knew Harry felt his wild magic, but he didn't bother to move. "Why wouldn't it matter? Why wouldn't the fact that you just walked up to Lord Voldemort and asked to die as if you didn't care whether you lived or died matter, huh? As if you-."
Harry paced in front of the Slytherin dorm. It was the middle of the night, and he was under his invisibility cloak, but he still felt like he was taking some horrible leap forward. He knew Draco was inside, he even knew which room. He'd only checked the Maurader's map a hundred times on his way down here. But he couldn’t strike up the courage to go in. He didn't even know why he kept coming down here.
Eventually, they started walking out of the library and down the corridors. Granger led him up the stairs, stopping at the 7th floor, leading him down an ill-used corridor. Draco stopped when he saw a door that hadn't been there the last time he'd been here. Granger knocked on the door without hesitation and it opened to reveal Harry. Harry’s eyes slid past Hermione to lock with Draco's and then he blushed and turned abruptly away.
“Yes,” Severus answered, and Lucius hated the way he said it. He had thought they were passed this. This… mistrust. He had asked Severus to marry him for Merlin’s sake. And even though Severus had said yes, he hadn’t meant it. That much was clear to Lucius now.  He just wished he understood why.
Harry sat at breakfast the next morning, listening to Hermione read the
Granger eyed Harry for half a second before her wand snapped out. Draco didn't even see Harry move, but he must have or the shield charm wouldn't have worked against Granger's disarming charm. And then Harry's wand was flicking, graceful and easy, and Granger's wand was flying through the air and landing in Harry's palm with a smack. He spent a long second looking at it before he tossed it back to her and turned toward his seat.
"He's sleepin'," he said after a minute. It took Draco a moment to fully process what he was looking at, and when he did, he realized how stupid he'd been to go along with coming into the depths of the forest with a crazy half-giant who was determined to get them all killed. He should have drug Harry back up to the castle kicking and screaming.
"Ok," Harry answered, his hands wrapping around Malfoy's arse, rocking him forward and back and forward again, increasing the pressure and the friction. Malfoy had a wonderful arse. "I want to be inside you," he said, only half aware that the words were leavng his mouth.
"Lucius."
if there were exceptions, would it? Don't you know anything."
Severus clenched, unclenched, wiggled and moved away. It had been a long time since anything had gone up there. It had been a long time since he'd
"Hmm." Parkinson smirked widely, looking down at Harry with an expression that
"Just what, Hermione?" he asked. "Just someone
"Frankly, no," he said, and Draco scowled. "Not when you've been saying the same thing all morning."
act like this, and he certainly didn't look at Harry like
"There will be no need—"
He lasted until dinner, stewing over what Hagrid had told him and telling himself that he must have gotten it wrong. Then he'd caught Draco looking at him again, guilty silver-gray eyes locked on Harry's face, and he'd snapped. He'd glared back and felt a horrible kind of satisfaction when Draco paled, turning his head away with a flinch. He sat at the Slytherin table for another minute or so before finally just getting up and leaving the Great Hall completely.
“Wait,” Potter called. Draco hesitated, almost biting his lip as Potter’s hand reached out and then fell back down. "I…"
they?” Draco answered. “This is no place for one of
"Don't you have anywhere better to be?" he said, raising an eyebrow. "Maybe bowing and scraping to Dumbledore? He does, after all, hold your leash now, doesn't he?"
"Can I do something for you, Snape?"
"The Ministry is at your back, you have a rogue werewolf as a student, you're a known Death Eater, and you have a known Death Eater on your staff. There's no Dumbledore to protect you anymore," Lupin said, and Harry resisted the urge to snort. As if Dumbledore had done much of that for any of them.
"That's not good enough." He narrowed his eyes, his hand clenching almost painfully around Harry's. "I'm staying."
"But Voldemort isn't trying to read my thoughts, he—" Harry started to protest.
Harry stared at him, because that… that was too far. Harry would never—had never used his scar to… He hated when people admired him for it; he hated when people only liked him for it. It had been one of the few things about Malfoy he truly respected. And Malfoy must have seen on his face that he'd taken his taunting a step too far past their invisible line, because his eyes flickered, and there was a touch of regret, quickly swept away, gone so fast Harry could have imagined it.
And Draco was tired of it.
Lucius had lost his robes as they entered the lake, the current dragging on them too much for him to make decent progress. Severus had followed his example soon after, leaving them both in shirts and trousers. Sprout and the three students were still in their pajamas, floating as they made their way through the murky waters of the Black Lake.
"So, I was wondering if you," she said, blushing intensely, "maybe you wanted to go with me?" He stared. Go with her where? But she was looking at him expectantly and he
"Hmmph." She sniffed again, taking a long drink of tea before answering. "Take him if you think it's best."
"Zabini," Harry said, not bothering to look away from Draco. "You mind if I talk to Draco," and the way he said it send a shiver down Draco's spine. He said it like Blaise didn't really have a choice, like Draco was
Lucius pinched the bridge of his nose once they disappeared inside the oak doors of the front hall. Honestly, he had no idea how Severus had ever managed to get the brat to do anything. It was as if he had a natural inclination to misbehave. He glanced up the steps, smiling slightly as he saw a light that had to be Draco and Harry pass by one of the windows.
He had just saved The Sorcerer's Stone. Well, it hadn't even been him. He hadn't wanted to go, Hermione and Ron had dragged him along, telling how bloody important the thing was. Apparently, they had been researching Nicolas Flamel behind his back—even though he'd said he wanted nothing to do with it. So, there he was, laying in an infirmary bed with a broken arm and he was sure a couple broken ribs but that was nothing compared to the pain in his head. He wasn't sure how he'd kept himself conscious; he'd just known he couldn't fall asleep, not with the walls barring down and Professor Quirrell’s eyes staring accusingly at him.
"Why can't Dumbledore teach Harry?" Sirius Black said. "Why you two?"
"Harry," Draco said. "Tell me what you saw."
allies now."
"I don't think that's a good idea," Harry interrupted. He knew what Draco would ask. He knew because he wanted it himself—had been wanting it for the past week. But he couldn't, he couldn't control himself when they were both fully clothed and standing far enough away that it should never have been a problem.
"Father," Draco stepped forward, but his father simply held up a hand, and he immediately fell silent.
"And I expect Potter won't want anything to do with me either." Draco nodded, straightening his back with a humorless chuckle. "Not that I could blame him."
"Why would Harry—"
"I…" Harry's voice was barely a whisper of breath, his wand lowering down to his side as the witch stepped forward.
“Did you talk to any adult about your fear?”
"Yeah," Harry said, ignoring him.
"Alright," Harry repeated, and he was following Malfoy down the street.
"What power?" Harry asked, feeling the sudden urge to run screaming from the room. He couldn't do this. He wasn't special or particularly talented. How was he supposed to face Lord Voldemort and
"Mm-hmm," Hermione said. She pushed open a door and ushered Harry and Draco through. Ron and Ginny were waiting for them, sitting on the bed with a plate of sandwiches between them.
in your precious order."
Nott sneered at him, rising to his feet as gracefully as he could when he'd been outsmarted and turned on his heel, marching out the door with all the sullenness of a teenage boy. Severus watched him go, and then sighed. He knew it wouldn't be the end of it; Nott would think of something else, or the Dark Lord would command him to do something else. He should speak to Lucius about what to do with the Ministry.
Harry blinked, blushed, and dropped his eyes again. Draco's hand twitched, wanting so badly to reach out and brush the fringe out of Harry's face. Draco's eyes dropped to Harry's lips; he wanted—
Now he was almost 11. He had to be, he could feel the change in his bones. He wasn't exactly sure what it meant but he knew that something was coming.
"No, but I was on patrol," Lupin answered, his voice low, confused. Harry refused to fall for it.
Draco stepped out of the Great Hall, ignoring the glares from the Slytherin table as he did. Almost three weeks of silence when he'd walked into a room, of glares and fearful looks. As he moved down the corridors, he continued to ignore the way people moved away from him. He supposed he'd better just get used to it.
“Doesn’t everyone?” he answered, staring out the window of her office. He had to admit that she had a somewhat decent view. It overlooked the center of St. Mungo’s; the courtyard already filling with leaves and cold.
Harry's mind, he would never be able to stop the Dark Lord once he got it in his mind. "You can't leave. You… Yo-you can't." He realized he was crying. Not just crying, sniveling with sobs wracking through his body.
"Harry, mate," Ron nudged him, breaking Harry out of his thoughts. "Time to head down." Harry nodded, and they made their way to the quidditch pitch for practice with the rest of the team. Everyone else was bustling around, preparing for the practice while the twins were making fun of Ron, but Harry was in a daze, his mind back on the dining hall and Malfoy’s dark eyed glare.
“And how does that excuse this?” Draco snapped at him, watching as Lupin’s eyes widened as he stared back at Draco with a look too close to remorse to be comfortable. They were almost to the entry hall, and he could just barely smell the smoke of the Fiendfire; he could hear it crackling behind them, though he was sure they were in no danger from it anymore.
The DA members left the last meeting before Christmas break in twos and threes, leaving Hermione, Ron, Harry, Cho, and her friend in the room. December had arrived with little improvement in Harry's mood. He couldn't even look forward to the DA meetings without feeling a twinge of emptiness that Draco no longer came.
"What was he telling you?" Draco answered, and Harry looked over his shoulder, reminding him that they were still standing in the middle of the corridor, Draco still gripping his arm tightly.
"Draco," Harry called frantically, "Draco, wake up!" Draco jerked awake, flinging himself away from Harry and bring his hands up to smack Harry across the face and chest.
"I should go," Draco said. They had stopped walking, standing awkwardly in the middle of the hall and it was a simple thing for Draco to take a step back and turn away from them. He didn't know what he was doing, hanging around the three of them and laughing and letting himself forgetting everything he was supposed to be doing, everything that had happened over the summer. He'd told himself to stay away from Severus because he knew him too well; he should have been doing the same thing to Harry, not—
"Oh."
"I'm still confused as to what he's been accused of?" McGonagall interrupted.
Harry knew he looked scary. Less because he
“To die?” Draco snapped. “That doesn’t even-.”
His legs were crossed under him, his shoes abandoned on the floor. He wasn't even wearing robes today, because apparently the Dark Arts Retrieval Department had a much less strict dress policy than the Auror Department. Which didn't make sense, but Harry was done arguing with Malfoy about it.
"I…" Harry tried, but his voice broke on the word, and he felt pathetic and weak, and he
"Why?" Draco asked suddenly, not bothering to lift his face from between his hands. "Why couldn't the Dark Lord just leave it alone? Why attack a baby?"
"He'll come around," Lucius said, though Draco didn't know if he was talking to him or himself.
Lucius didn't
Malfoy released his hair, leaning back up and pressing his lips against Harry's again with a vengeance. Harry could taste the wine on his tongue, slightly bitter, obviously expensive. He moaned loudly as Malfoy pressed his thigh between Harry's legs, grinding against his crotch.
"Why would he think that?"
Then again, he really shouldn't have been surprised when he stepped into the corridor and ran into the two Weasley twins. The one on the left frowned at him while the one on the right scowled at him, and Draco was left wondering how he could get away.
Blaise could already feel the dejavu of last year in his bones. How the two of them had fought and fought and fought but apparently been pining the whole time. It made him want to throw up in his mouth. Honestly.
"It was his
Maybe because Harry wasn’t good at anything else.
Fortunately, he heard a loud grunt from below him and managed to grab the Thestral's neck before he fell. As he looked back at Luna's wide-eyed expression, everything came rushing back to him.
He felt Severus tense above him before relaxing, letting his leg drop down and laying to the side, his arm draping across Lucius’ stomach as if he couldn’t not be touching him. Lucius raised his hand, brushing his fingers along the Malfoy ring that sat on Severus’ finger.
He heard a strangled shout and knew Severus had seen him, but he could tell by the look in Voldemort's eyes that it was too late. He could hear Severus running, screaming. He could feel Draco fighting against him. Harry closed his eyes and relaxed against the rasping sound of Voldemort's voice.
warn you that I was coming," Dumbledore said, his voice light and cheery as if oblivious to Vernon's turmoil. "However, it's no matter, Harry, are you quite ready?"
"What?"
Care of Magical Creatures. Not because of any true dislike of the subject but because he was obligated to hate it due to the oaf that taught it most days. Besides, it was one of the classes he'd always shared with Potter, so it was always a class he was required to be foul in.
"No one's asking you to-."
It had been a struggle to get Harry to pick ten pieces of candy. He’d had to suggest something more than once, and they’d been there for more than an hour, when Harry had finally looked at him—only four pieces in his bag—his green eyes wide and uncertain, and Draco had taken pity on him. He’d asked what flavors Harry liked, what textures, leading him around the store based on his answer. It had still been painful, but it had been good—for both of them.
"W-what do you mean?" Neville asked, his eyes wide as he stared at Blaise. Blaise snorted scornfully before turning back to his pheasant.
going to be teaching it?" Draco asked quietly. The rest of the group ignored them, now talking about where they should meet and how often.
Draco gave one last suck against Harry's neck before soothing the skin with his tongue and pulling away, never stopping his hips or his hands. Harry moaned, knowing he would have a love bite there and
"Back when I was in school," Lupin answered, and Draco knew that it was the exact question he'd been waiting for Draco to ask. "It was before Wolfsbane had been invented. Me and a group of my friends, who were Animagus, would go out into the woods on a full moon and run like we just did. We called ourselves the Marauders."
Malfoy. He wanted Malfoy to
Harry felt like cold water had been dumped on him. It was like Dumbledore know. Fingers intwined with his, squeezing his hand in a way that shot warmth through his arm. Draco’s gaze were still focused on Dumbledore, his silver-grey eyes almost challenging, and Harry realized they did know. Both of them.
"Oh," Malfoy answered, his voice low, intense, grey eyes sharp on Harry's face. His lips curved up, eyes crinkling as he smiled, and for some reason, Harry
"Funny isn't it," Harry said, tilting his head and letting his blazing emerald eyes match Draco's glare. "You're jealous of Cho, Cho's jealous of Hermione, Hermione says we should just all talk to each other, but when I try, you just sneer at me."
"Draco," Lupin's voice sounded. It was quiet, reserved and yet it still sent a chill down Draco's spine that made him want to growl and pounce on the older werewolf. "The wolfsbane potion is the safest option."
"Malfoy," he said, eyes narrowed defensively. "What are you doing here?"
But this wasn't supposed to happen. He wasn't supposed to care. He was supposed to be able to stand there and not care about those emerald eyes that burned through him, about that raven hair that never laid flat. He was supposed to move on with his life. He had worked all summer to move on with his life. He had told Harry no, so that he could move on with his life. He knew, he knew if he wanted to survive this, he couldn't afford to
He remembered when Ron, Dracona, and him had been in Auror school, when Dracona and him had fought so much the instructors had had to pull them apart every other week. When Hermione had first started to get to know Dracona and become her friend and had scowled and scolded the three of them until they would all shut up and stand to be in the same room just for her.
"You're not helping," she answered, and he just shrugged at her.
But he was
"Of course," Lucius said instead, his face betraying none of that.
"Made of glass?" Draco guessed, Harry's earlier words coming back to him. And it suddenly made sense why his apology had bothered Harry so much. Harry just stared at him; dark green eyes unreadable.
“Where were you?” he asked, and Draco froze in his tracks, eyes wide. Lucius doesn’t miss the way he almost inched his way to hide behind Harry—as if Lucius wouldn’t just chew the both of them out.
"I'm think going to go," Harry said, standing abruptly. Everyone’s eyes turned toward him, but he just turned his head as he headed for the door.
"We don't know, Draco said—"
He shoved open the doors of the great hall, feeling satisfied at the loud bang that sounded as he ran through them and out into the open air. Taking the night air in through one deep lungful after another, he sprinted across the grounds of Hogwarts and crossed into the Forbidden Forest without hesitation.
"Oh?" Lucius set his tea down, leaning forward to listen better. He figured this was a monumental day indeed, Harry Potter asking for advice. He wondered when the last time the boy had truly let himself acknowledge that he needed help was. It couldn't have been any time soon if the pained expression on the boy's face was anything to go by.
"I don't know,
It took Draco longer than he thought possible to get away from Umbridge. She talked about Defense of Dark Arts and how it should be taught. She talked about the change she wanted in the Ministry. She talked about Draco's father. She complained about Potter.
"Does it?" Weasley snapped. "It's got to be illegal, having a werewolf in the school! And another student running around in the woods with him, unsupervised. It's wrong."
“Emotions are what keep us human,” she said. “They keep us alive.”
"Good morning," Lucius smiled thinly, looking a little too pleased with himself. Severus just rolled his eyes as he followed him into the room.
"Stop trying to analyze me," Draco said, glaring, and Blaise finally held up his hands as if he was surrendering.
Draco answered. "You see danger and you run into. But I'm not like that. I don't
No, he had made them stop in the middle of the street while Draco talked him down.
"I require one last task of you," Voldemort said, stepping around Harry and closer to Severus.
Lucius pressed the back of his head against the floor, feeling the length of his body pressing against Severus’, and it hurt, and it felt so erotically
Severus leaned over his desk as the Floo closed. He supposed it had been foolish of him to truly believe that Nott wouldn't tell anyone about Draco's curse simply because Severus had momentarily scared him. Still, telling the Ministry was a big move.
," Ron's voice sounded in Harry's ear, his wand flashing in Harry's face, and Harry's spell was blocked.
“Do what?” Draco answered, his eyes flicking down to the way Harry flung his robe to the ground, already reaching for the hem of his shirt.
"Drop it," Harry snapped, his voice harsh. But when he turned his head to look at Draco, his emerald eyes were full of pain.
Weasley, the girl one, had sat down with her boyfriend, Dean Thomas, not long after they had, and Harry had reacted almost the same as he had when they'd been at the party. He'd started and then stared, and it had send Draco's belly boiling and bursting, and then as if all that wasn’t bad enough, he had felt guilty for being jealous. He should be allowed to be jealous of his boyfriend.
By the time he finally returned him to Hogwarts, after his uncle was done with him, after the three days had passed, and everyone around him was so happy. So easy going. And he was just too tired to care anymore. So tired and sore and done pretending to be fine when he wasn't. He could feel the marks his uncle had left on his body--inside his body-- every time he moved, and he hated it. He hated how he felt dirty because of something his uncle had done to him. He hated how he couldn't even let Professor Snape look at him for fear of what he would see.
"Of course not," Draco said, throwing scorn into his voice and ignoring the twinge of guilt when he thought of the way Harry had looked at him all week, the way Harry had turned his head away every time Draco had insulted him. "I never cared about him. I'm just glad he’s not following me around like a lost dog anymore."
he realized just what Draco was trying to say, how Draco was lying so he wouldn’t take the blame.
Harry sat behind his desk, looking across at the mountain of paperwork that had been piling up since he'd started working with Malfoy. He'd never seemed able to focus long enough to get anything done when he was there, looking tall and lean and attractive with his long legs folded under him as he balanced precariously on Harry's desk.
He heard Lupin call after him, but Severus must have done something because the room was quiet behind him, allowing Harry to slip out and go back down the stairs. He moved away from Severus' office, heading for the library without really thinking about it. He had already wasted enough time, time spent with Draco, talking to Lucius, watching Severus, and dragging Lupin around. He paused outside the library, pulling his wand out of the sheath along his waist. He was allowed a lot of freedom inside Hogwarts, but that freedom did not extend to the library.
"It's not funny, Hermione!" Harry said.
that look.
"What are you talking about, Malfoy?" Harry answered.
"I care about him too," Lucius snapped back, and something in his voice quieted Severus. Maybe because it was the truth. It surprised Lucius how very much it was the truth. It surprised him that he had been every bit as worried about Harry as he had when he'd found Draco bleeding on the floor of their mansion after the werewolf attack. He had known he cared about the boy, but he hadn't known he loved him as if he were his own child.
"I don't know," Harry sighed and the cloth on his forehead disappeared. There was the sound of dripping water and then a freshly dampened cloth was placed on his head. Severus resisted the urge to moan at the feeling against his burning mind. "I wasn't here when you got back. You should have called."
to say it. He
"Just let it, Ron," Harry interrupted. He shifted uncomfortably, both Granger and Weasley staring at him as if he’d lost his mind.
"Harry! Ron!" Hermione's voice interrupted him. They turned to see her come running up to them, her hair flying behind her. "He didn't do it. It wasn’t him."
Draco felt his ears pop as they returned to Severus' office. Harry was on the ground, holding one knee as if he had hit it on something. It was entirely possible he had. Severus was rubbing a welt on his wrist that could only have been caused by a stinging hex. And Draco… Draco hadn't moved physically but he felt like shards of broken glass had taken up residence in his chest making it horribly impossible to breathe. Draco closed his eyes, bringing his feet up and underneath himself as Severus began to tell Potter that it hadn't been that bad for a first attempt, and Potter picked himself up off the floor.
"Greyback was tearing her to pieces by the time I got downstairs to you," his father said, and there was no emotion in his voice. There was
"Yes?" Lupin asked, raising an eyebrow as if he couldn't imagine what Lucius could want.
"That's not a question I know how to answer, Lucius." Severus said, his voice just as quiet.
frantic." Though Harry noticed he didn't contradict anything else she had said.
"He should talk to Lupin before it becomes too much for him," Severus said, and Lucius scowled at him, lips turning down sharply.
"He's in Azkaban now," Severus answered. "Awaiting trial with the other Death Eaters.”
to lose Harry, and he was only just beginning to realize how real a possibility that was.
to do something about it.
And it pissed him off even more that he didn't have a right to understand.
"But how do we know if it actually did or not?"
“Lupin was… He was… different. That was the year Severus and I had a falling out, and Lupin made me feel as if everything was
The rest of the day was normal. Or as normal as Harry's day could have been with Ron in the infirmary, Hermione looking as if she was about to start crying, and Draco casting him nervous looks every few minutes—because Harry needed more confirmation about who had poisoned Slughorn's mead. Every time Draco looked at him, only to turn away when Harry even shifted, a pang of fiery anger ran straight through him.
"What are you-?" Harry asked, scrambling after him in a way he was sure was entirely undignified. But Malfoy was walking toward his desk without asking him and
"You know what I'm talking about," he answered, stepping just a little too close to Harry. "You had plenty of chances to tell me and you didn't."
"I'm not afraid of you."
He heard a startled yelp, and then Weasley was covering his mouth, gagging once before spitting a rather large slug out onto the palm of his hand. And he was pale and shaking as he let out a loud whimper before racing down the hall in the opposite direction as Harry, already gagging again, and Harry figured if nothing else, the spell would keep him from talking about things he knew nothing about.
"Then, why…" Harry blinked up at him.
throwing it. He was doing up the last piece of his robes when Malfoy's sleepy voice interrupted him.
"Let's just have a drink, Horace," Dumbledore asked, his eyes sparkling with mischief. "For old time's sake?"
"Harry Potter," the woman said, looking straight at him. He tried to move toward her, but Dracona was suddenly in the way. He could see her lips moving, but he couldn't hear her, couldn't focus on her past the shimmering light in the woman's beautiful dark eyes.
"I'm going for help!" another, different voice, yelled. Footsteps running from the room, but Harry couldn’t focus past what he’d just seen.
"Let me go!" Draco yelled, still struggling against Harry’s hold on him. "Let me go!"
"You'd be fine-," Harry started to argue, but Draco was already talking over him.
Harry immediately began to bustle around, checking a piece of parchment that looked suspiciously like a map and then sending people out in threes and fours. Eventually, it was only Draco, Granger, Weasley, and Harry left alone in the room.
"That seems like a confirmation to me," Granger said. "Maybe Ginny was more convincing than she thought."
"Harry?" Luna asked, her voice quiet and curious behind him. "What
"She was a nice girl but she wasn't always a good girl," Bisham sighed. "I know she was having an affair of some sort. Some older man, someone she wasn't supposed to be seeing."

"Why?" Draco asked, eyes narrowing.
her there to cry, and he realized with a shock that he didn’t particularly want to.
had put that look on his face.
"I don't know. I don't trust it to be left alone."
"You wanted to see me, Headmistress?" Snape asked, taking in the scene before him without so much as blinking an eye.
"Draco," a voice said, and he tried to open his eyes, hissing as the light stabbed him through the iris'. That
"That's enough," Lucius said, conveniently ignoring the fact he was talking to himself. He turned to the gargoyle and spoke the password, watching the way it leaped to life, twisting around to show Lucius the hidden staircase. He climbed up as quickly as he could, his anger and annoyance driving him as they hadn't in a very long time.
"I…" and still he hesitated. And it burned Draco up. There weren't words for how it burned Draco up. Sure, Harry had told him a lot—probably more than he'd ever told anyone—Draco
"Why are you telling me this?"
"Where's the proof You-Know-Who's back?" a blond boy asked. Smith maybe? Anyone who asked such a stupid question didn't deserve for Draco to be sure of their name.
"Alright, then?" Zabini answered, his voice a loud echoing whine next them. "Alright
"Ginny Weasley," Blaise said, the realization coming quick and easy, and when had he been paying such close attention to Luna Lovegood? "I see the way you look at her." Luna just shrugged at him.
trying. He
"Mr. Potter," that shrill girly voice snapped him back to the present. He turned to find himself facing Umbridge. Her frog face was set in lines of glee as if she couldn’t be happier to have an accuse to stop him. "What are you doing wandering the halls?" she asked.
Besides, that wasn’t the kind of hurt they were talking about.
He remembered his father's face when Voldemort had found out he'd failed at the department of mysteries. He remembered his father limping for days afterward, wincing when he moved. He remembered his mother setting out the pain potions after the torture sessions. He remembered the both of them being careful not to mention anything to him, but he knew.
"Why didn't you tell me sooner?"
"Draco," Harry whispered, reaching out to touch him. Draco immediately jumped up, flinching away from his touch with such fear in his eyes that Harry couldn't help but feel stung. "Draco, it's me," Harry whispered softly.
"I'd seen it before," Harry answered. "It was in one of the memories Dumbledore showed me before he died. One of the founding artifacts that Tom Riddle stole."
"Not safe! How can you expect me to stay here while you-?"
Lucius stared at him for a long minute, his eyes wide and his mouth half open as if he would argue before he suddenly lunged across the space between them. Lucius was everywhere, Lucius’ legs against him, Lucius’s hands cupping his, Lucius fitting the ring onto finger, Lucius’ lips against his, Lucius’ fingers working his way down the buttons of his robes, Lucius’ mouth under his chin, Lucius’ tongue brushing along his pulse point, Lucius’ voice raw in a way he’d never heard before.
. He could hear Granger and Weasley’s words echoing in his head, and he wanted to
"Is it true," asked a new girl, drawing Harry's gaze, "that you can produce a Patronus?" Draco sat back as the group began to talk about Harry's achievements while he grew more and more uncomfortable looking. Draco inspected his fingernails, for the most part not taking part in the conversation until—
"What are wrackspurts?"
Draco had returned. Draco had returned and suddenly that was all that mattered to him.
And he remembered the look on his mother's face when Voldemort asked a price his parents weren't willing to pay. They both knew Draco wouldn't succeed if they sent him to Hogwarts on an assassination. And so they switched, turned around, did a 180 on whose side they were on.
"It hurts to see them together," he muttered.
"I just—" he sighed, cutting himself off. He bit his lip, his hand slipping off Draco’s thigh. "I don't really know what we are, Draco."
Severus snapped. Draco flinched, his hands tensing on his knees. There was a tense silence in which Draco was able to hear every beat of his heart. Severus was most of the reason why Draco himself was terrified to say the Dark Lord's name aloud. Something about it had scared Severus badly enough that he always reacted this way and whatever was enough to scare Severus that bad wasn't something Draco felt he was qualified to deal with. Harry, however, set his teeth and glared at Severus, unwilling to back down.
. He felt like smacking himself. How could he have been such an idiot? Draco was probably being tortured by Voldemort right now and he'd been sulking because he had thought...
long since he'd had it.
"Why didn't you slap the bint?" he asked.
"Well…" Draco hesitated, shivering at the memory of their first year in this forest—at the cloaked figure leaning over the fallen unicorn. He quickly shoved the memory away and turned back to Potter, feeling silly though not sure why. He had every reason to be nervous in the forest, just because Potter was crazy didn't mean
They were sprawled across the bed, completely naked, Lucius’ head cradled across Severus chest, his hair a tangled mess around their bodies. They were both relaxed, comfortable, waiting for the other to be ready for the next round.
"What?" Harry answered.
"And why not," Lucius snapped. "Why is now better than then?" He sneered, his fingers tightening dangerously around his tea cup.
Hogwarts receives an unwelcome visitor.
"He's happy. He's really happy."
"Engaged," Harry answered.
"Who?" the house elf asked, her eyes narrowing suspiciously.
"Aren't you the least bit nervous when you come in here?" Draco asked.
He watched Potter, Granger, and Weasley walk down the path with the other Gryffindors, stopping in front of Professor Grubbly-Plank. She was the Professor hired to replace Hagrid while he was off failing at his Order business. Of course, that didn't make Draco
"We're going to spend this lesson with Professor Snape trying to pierce your mind," Draco said. "Now, if you've been practicing all the techniques we've been working on, it should go well." He paused. "Have you had any dreams recently?" Harry bit his lip, and Draco checked his sigh of frustration. It's true, they were making some progress, but it was also true that they weren't making near enough.
“I never thought I’d see the day Lucius Malfoy asked me for help,” Kingsley Shacklebolt said, and Lucius tightened his fingers around the head of his cane, refusing to move from his spot in the alley. “What was it you called me during the first war?” Shacklebot asked. “A blood traitor?” Lucius smiled grimly; he was actually pretty sure he’d used stronger language.
He blinked again and then just stared. What was his name doing down here? He reached out, his fingers instinctively outstretched for the glowing sphere.
, dressed in black dress robes with his green eyes bright. He looked beautiful.
"I…" Severus tightened his hand on his wand. "I never hated you."
"Lord Voldemort… He sent a summons last night. I assumed Severus had gone, but he's not returned…"
"Harry," Severus leaned forward. "You need to talk-."
"I- yes, of course." Lucius stepped back and turned heading back the way he'd come. He could feel the boy's eyes on his back as he retreating away from Severus' door, still thinking about what Harry Potter had said about his son.
"Why do you hide your emotions from me?"
The trial....
"There's no hidden ice."
It didn't get any better as the year passed. The dark-haired boy continued to follow the redhead around, and gradually, began to be bullied by others. He stopped the Slytherins from bullying the dark-haired boy, but there was nothing he could do to stop the Gryffindors.
There was a long silence where neither of them spoke, and Dumbledore still wasn't looking at him, and yet Severus didn't quite feel like leaving. This might be his last chance to see the man alive, to ask any questions and yell about all the things he hated about him. He opened his mouth and then closed it when Dumbledore looked at him, his smile gone along with the twinkle from his eyes. And Severus just couldn't; Dumbledore may seem as if he didn't care about his death, but no one was that accepting, and Severus wasn't cold enough to deny Dumbledore the chance to grieve.
"Oh, ok. That sounds… good, I guess."
"Nothing, sir," Harry answered. Slughorn’s eyes flicked across Harry’s face, focusing first on his scar and then roaming over the rest of his face.
"Maybe the poison wasn't meant for Ron at all," Fred said. "Maybe it was meant for Harry, and Ron just got the wrong glass."
Blaise didn't like it. He didn't like the way they just waltzed into Gringotts with Bellatrix
He was perched on the arm of Severus' chair—drinking tea and pretending as if he wasn't trying to be sexy while Severus pretended he wasn't interested—when the knock on the door sounded. He exchanged a look with Severus and then sighed. He supposed they couldn't ignore the world forever.
"No," and Draco was standing too, moving much too close. And Harry could feel Draco's breath flick across his cheekbone as he took another step forward. And he was shivering, and it wasn't from fear, and he should have been wishing Draco would back away, but he was wishing Draco would come closer. And he was wishing Draco would put his arms around him as he'd done when they'd been in the room of requirement.
"Where have you been?" Harry asked. They stared at him for a long minute before Hermione spoke.
"That wasn't the impression I got when you followed us to the Hog's Head," Granger answered, "but hey, maybe Ron is right for once in his life." Draco rolled his eyes and Granger's lips twitched.
"He's been released," Madame Pomfrey said, looking up from the bed she was making to cast Harry a quizzical look. "Didn't he tell you?"
Draco has a nightmare that leaves Harry reeling while Lucius finds Hogwarts has an unexpected visitor.
"I could at least get the Order off your back, and maybe stop some of the rumors about Draco being out of control. At the very least, with an older werewolf here, the Order will have to admit that he's more in control. I'd like to help you if you'll just let me."
The wave of possessiveness that surged through Draco was so strong he almost gasped. If he hadn't been in front of the weasel and Mudblood, he might have. But looking at Harry, he found he didn't-couldn't step back from this. Not while Harry was standing there looking as if the world was collapsing around him, and he had no choice but to deal with it alone.
He opened the cabinet, his hands sliding over the smooth wood. It was probably his own fault he couldn't get the cabinet to work. He was afraid of what would happen when he did. As bad as things were now, they were nothing compared to how bad things would get when he'd managed to get the cabinet up and running. Still, he was running out of time. His poison trick wouldn't hold Nott at bay for long.
“I’m not sure,” Severus answered. “Official, they’d have to work very hard to convict someone who helped defeat Voldemort.”
“I know you think—”
"He certainly seemed like it."
"Just how long
"Harry… I—" He tried to step away, but Harry just clutched at him, refusing to be pushed aside so easily.
Even McGonagall had come to him, pressing a hand down on his shoulder and telling him he could always come to her if someone gave him trouble and his father was busy. He felt like asking he if that only applied to Werewolf problems or if the Gryffindors teased him for doing his homework he could complain to her too.
"Of course, I do," Draco turned back to him, eyes flashing the same way they did when someone had insulted his very name. "Why would you ask that?"
Draco came back a few minutes after he'd left. Lucius hadn't heard anything that was said between him and Potter, but he could tell from the expression on Draco's face that it hadn't gone well. He could probably guess why. He'd gotten to know Potter well over the past four days of Draco being in the forest.
"I need your help," Harry said.
Harry understood self-loathing. He understood more than he was willing to admit, so looking back at Draco, it was easy to understand exactly what was going on inside his head. It was easy to see his muscles bunch and his breath constrict and know he was about to run.
"I still feel as if I'm missing something," Severus said. "Harry was too deliberate in the way he had the Dark Lord kill him. It was as if..." he trailed off, frowning.
"Very good, Nott." Umbridge said, nodded in satisfaction. Then she turned her beady eyes on Harry, focusing on him with a disturbing intensity. "So," she said. "You thought you could trick me, did you? Sending people to keep me occupied, as if I don't see right through the tricks of a Weasley! And then that mess with the Slytherin commons, thanks to Miss Parkinson it was only to easy to catch one and all of you." She laughed heartily. "Yet, I'm curious, Mr. Potter, what exactly were you doing in the Slytherin common room? Clearly, it was important that you got inside but for what purpose? What do you know about Mr. Malfoy's disappearance? How is it connected to Dumbledore? Did he make Mr. Malfoy disappear to make it look like He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was active and back again
"Harry!" a voice called behind him. He froze at the sound, his lips twisting in disgust before he could really stop them. There were only a few people who called him by that name, and even fewer who he tolerated to do so. Remus Lupin was not one of them. He turned to face the other man, narrowing his eyes to stare at the innocent expression. "What are you doing wandering around so late?"
"I've told you, Lucius," Harry sighed, finally setting his teacup down with a clatter. "I don't care about your relationship problems. Just go talk to Severus."
Harry opened his eyes to look past Cho and locked eyes with Draco. He was watched the two of them with shaded silver-gray eyes. He blinked and suddenly it was Draco he was kissing, backed up against a wall, his hands pinned above his head, his mouth being ravaged. He knew Cho was watching and he didn't care. He just didn't want Draco to stop.
"Exactly," he snapped back. "If you don't know why I'm here, how did you know I'd
"I take it you knew the same way Umbridge did,” he asked.
"They must have gone the wrong way!" Granger answered, heading toward the door as if she would leave.
"Professor Malfoy!" one of the student let out a loud cry, clinging desperately to Lucius' robes even as they shoved against the current. And Lucius was holding them above the current now, his grey eyes steady on Severus' back.
"Harry doesn't knock like that," he answered. "Besides, he would have just come in."
"Harry-," Draco tried, but Harry shoved him, his hand connecting sharply with Draco's shoulder, sending him tumbling into a wall. And it shouldn't have sent a spike of arousal, of want through him, but it did. It made him want to grab Harry and drag him forward and show him just how wrong he was about anyone possibly being better for Draco than him.
Finally, Dumbledore arrived, almost appearing in the infirmary as if he'd been there all along. Though Professor Snape just made an impatient gesture shooing him around the door and out. He blinked after them, wanting to know what had happened. What had happened to Professor Quirrell? Had he, had he really…?
" Smith opened his mouth to say something, but Draco's glare silenced him. Harry ordered them all into pairs, leaving Neville and Draco standing in the middle of the room. Draco's upper lip curled, but Harry spoke before he could.
terrifying idea.
shagging Pansy. The only person he was ‘jumping in the corridors’ was you," she finished, eyes shining with mirth.
Thank you for all your comments!
"Because you will be accompanying the Weasley's for the holidays."
"I just want it to stop."
"What?"
Severus was sitting behind his desk, feeling frustrated as Lucius stood between Severus and Lupin, his lips pressed tight with suppressed annoyance. Lupin was standing in the corner away from the two of them, looking tired and irritated. They'd been arguing for hours, and they still had nothing.
“Potter did seem to be much more comfortable around Professor Snape than anyone else,” McGonagall said, and Jones hummed. Harry thought it was supposed to be a sound of affirmation, but it sounded more like a sound of scorn.
at anyone else wrong?"
"It may be illegal," the witch said. "But that doesn't make it any less fun."
"I can't come either," Draco interrupted, and Harry got the feeling it was to get Slughorn to stop talking just as much as anything else.
"Draco needs his wounds treated," he whispered.
"They're staring because you were at the ministry too," Harry answered, shifting uncomfortably.
And wasn't it Draco's fault that Harry was looking in her direction at all? Hadn't he been the one to pull away enough that Harry had time to look at someone else?
"So, you're not actually friends with Moaning Myrtle?"
"Severus hates
"He's busy talking to that Gryffindor again."
"Sure," Lovegood said lightly, jumping up from her seat and slapping her magazine closed.
matter. He didn't care. He was in love with Harry, and as terrifying as that was, he couldn't imagine himself running away from this.
"And is that what you wanted to say?" Severus asked, and Harry turned his face away, because he hadn't thought to ask himself that. And the truth was that it hadn't been what he wanted to say. But it had been what he was capable of saying.
"I always did wonder how you seemed to be top of the year when you never pay attention in class," Draco said finally, and Harry raised an eyebrow, lips twitching again.
"He still hasn't returned from his change. And I've barely seen Potter either."
And now it was as if neither of them knew how to start again. It should have been easy. Draco
, even playful, but Draco had seen him switch from friendly to defensive in a heartbeat. Unfortunately, he was so focused on not saying the words that he didn't think about what actually came out of his mouth.
(See the end of the chapter for
"We need to talk," Blaise said, shifting so he was back in front of the other boy.
"Why else would you stay with me?" Harry asked, and Draco eyes flashed at him, confusion turning to anger.
Draco's eyes popped open, and he looked down, taking in the raven spotted bobcat resting against his chest. His very naked chest. He flushed bright red, looking down at himself. His clothes; what happened to his clothes?
"No, thank you," he answered. She hummed before coming back over and setting the tea in front of him. He murmured a thank you, picking up the teacup and lifting it to his lips.
"No, I…" Harry trailed off, and he suddenly remembered what Hermione had told him—about how Malfoy had
angry. He didn't have to push or pretend as he stared at Lupin and that felt... freeing.
And somehow only
"Draco?" Harry's voice sounded in the small room.
"Hey," he answered, waving at her. And he looked like a total idiot.
"Well," Lucius stood from his chair in front of the headmaster's desk. "Until you do, I'll not be telling you anything else I know. Have a good day, headmaster." Sneering, he departed.
"Can I help you with something?" he asked, closing the room to his private rooms behind him.
"I wasn't trying to—"
Harry was standing in front of the dragon for the Triwizard's tournament, wishing he was anywhere else and trying desperately not to be afraid…. He was in front of an enchanted mirror, two people waving at him. There was such hope shinning on his face that they could only be his parents…. He was laying atop Cedric Diggory, looking into blank dead eyes and
Hermione and Ron weren't helpful. Ron wanted to blame everything on Snape and Draco, but Harry
"So, then why didn't you just keep walking. Or turn the other eye," he asked. Potter was silent, just continuing to stare at up him. "Does it have something to do with the way you talked to them? Has someone hurt you?"
"Come in," he called, and Remus Lupin immediately stepped into the room, casting a weary eye around.
"Succubus magic is illegal," she heard the words coming out of her mouth, and she knew how ridiculous she sounded, but she couldn't stop herself. The witch threw back her head and laughed loudly, looking completely unconcerned as the three robed figures around her skittered away nervously. And Dracona realized with a start that they must all be men. There was no other way she could be controlling them. Controlling Harry.
"You don't call them by their first names?"
"Thank you, Sirius." Harry smiled at him, ignoring Draco's snort. Sirius flicked his eyes to Draco with renewed annoyance before beaming at Harry. He looked uncertain for a moment, and then he smiled one last time and stepped into the kitchen. Harry let out a breath, just realizing how much tension he had been holding. It shouldn't have been this difficult to come and live with his godfather for the first time.
His eyes lit up to pure molten silver filled with joy and something Harry would have said was adoration if he didn't know better. And Draco's lips were curled up into the widest smile he'd ever seen, much less directed at him. And then he was lowering his head, his lips hovering an inch from Harry's, hesitating.
Then Draco was kissing him, and Harry made a startled noise in the back of his throat. He almost jerked his head back, but Draco's hand was on the back of his neck, holding him in place. His mouth was gentle, putting a bare amount of pressure on his as Harry relaxed against the kiss.
Unfortunately, he had come to
"Oh, I think I know exactly what you two were doing," Black answered, his voice hard and full of shock, and Draco would have laughed at Black's expression if he didn't feel like killing himself for letting them get caught like this.
"What are you doing?" Harry blinked, looking up into silver-gray eyes.
“So,” Jones said, tapping a finger against the wood of the stand. “It’s fair to say that Potter was in a delicate state of mind when he met Severus Snape?”
"How should I know?" he answered, savagely stabbing a piece of turkey onto his plate. She eyed him warily but didn't say anything else. His eyes flicked over to Pansy Parkinson, who was whispering frantically to the boy next to her. In fact, the whole Slytherin table was a mass of whispering bodies, all hunched over each other as if there was some great secret. Harry rolled his eyes and turned to his breakfast, it was just like Draco to cause some great splash like this.
He frowned after them, wondering at their behavior. But just shook himself and continued toward his room. Hopefully, they wouldn't spread stories about the way he looked around the castle.
"Whatever, Potter," Draco sighed, rolling his eyes in a show of how put upon he was, "let's just go."
"Don't change the subject, Potter. Why did you help Draco?"
"That's right," Theodore smiled widely. "Everyone knows now."
"Of course," Blaise answered. "I think she posed for a couple of magazines last week and gave an interview. Something about them believing she was the most beautiful witch alive."
"Why would I want to go back?"
"So, then why do it that way?"
Then the students exploded in noise, people pushing their way forward to try and see, others just asking what was going on, others protesting, others exclaiming in excitement. And Harry had his mouth half open in shock as if he already knew what was going on.
He should just trust his father, shouldn’t he? He should just trust himself. But then even his own conscience was telling him that he couldn't handle his werewolf side on his own anymore. Besides, the fact that Severus had agreed with him. And if Severus had suggested reaching out to Lupin then Draco could only assume that it was serious.
"Harry," Hermione said from a little bit behind them. "Maybe it wasn't Voldemort. Maybe it was just…" She trailed off as she caught sight of his face.
"Can we have sex?" Harry said, the words coming out in a tumble, and Draco stared at him for a long minute before answering.
"I won't-," Dracona had started, shaking her head, denying what they both knew was going to happen.
"You know what I'm doing," Lucius answered, and he stepped forward again. His hand was still on Dumbledore's desk, his other reaching out and taking hold of Severus' shoulder with a firm grip. Severus stared, refusing to respond to Lucius' advances but still unable to pull away.
"About how I hadn't thought my plan through," Nott continued. "And I wanted you to know, I have now. And if you don't do exactly what I want, I could do a lot worse than just expose some werewolf."
"Get out of the way, Harry," Sirius gave him a shove, but Harry wouldn't budge. Draco took three long strides and planted himself in front of his Godfather.
that to her. He was just surprised Scrimgeour had sent her instead of coming himself, though maybe he was still too busy finding ways to kick Severus out after Draco's secret had been revealed.
"Draco, darling," Pansy called. He sighed, of course, he was never so lucky. "Why were you out so late?"
He sighed, running his hands along the wood. Part of him wished he'd never seen it.
Draco squeezed Harry's hand again, his eyes flicking toward Severus before returning to him, and Harry knew what he was going to say before he said it.
Thanks you for commenting, my lovelies!
"Someone went into her room," Malfoy muttered, already running toward the inn doors, and Harry blinked once, twice, staring after him and wondering what the Hell he was talking about. "Potter!" Malfoy called over his shoulder, sounding exasperated; Harry jumped, looking up at Jasmine's shared room with her lover to see the light on, a shape moving around on the inside, and he remembered abruptly that they still had a job to do.
could still manage to relax Harry if no one else could.
Either way, he didn't care. He was just so tired. And caring made him hurt, deep down in his bones. And when he hurt, it made him even more tired. And he was just so tired of being tired.
"You'll what?" Lupin interrupted, his voice full of anger and blame and madness. "You'll actually do something to save him, will you?" Lupin shook Draco hard enough to make his teeth rattle. Harry just stared back at him, his eyebrows furrowed, shaking his head, and it was painfully obviously he didn't have any idea what Lupin was talking about.
them?" Severus answered, warming to the idea. "They could have encountered a Death Eater while in Hogsmeade, and
two trainees had managed to break the dueling mat without casting a spell.
"Well," he said, shifting his back against the couch. "She was crying and wanted to talk—"
"What? What's happened?" Nymphadora asked, leaning over him with a motherly air.
"I haven't talked to Draco since Hogsmeade."
"Oh," Lupin's eyes widened, and he sat down. "Tell me how I can help."
Harry stared at it, entranced, watching as the shawl draped figure of Sibyll Trelawney spoke.
"Shouldn't you be doing homework?" he asked finally, Harry's gaze reaching the point where it was uncomfortable on his skin.
"No, Mr. Malfoy," Dumbledore answered, scribbling something down on a piece of paper. "Now, I want you to memorize this." He handed the paper to Draco.
She'd healed his ribs and arms easily but there was no cure for the pain in his head. Ron and Hermione had made it to the infirmary about half an hour before Harry had arrived. Ron was in the bed next to his, and Harry kept hoping Hermione would understand his silent hint to not come near him.
"Draco, wait," Potter called, his hand closing around Draco's elbow and making it so hard to walk away. Draco forced himself to stay turned away, trying desperately to ignore the spark of heat that Harry's hand on his arm was doing to his libido.
"Look, Potter, you don't have to say anything," and he sounded so… "You've made it very clear how you feel about our relationship," when had Harry done that? Sure, he'd thought… but now that he knew… "I wouldn't want to make you want to do anything you don't want to-,"
"Sugar?"
Draco stumbled into Harry’s room, lugging Harry in behind him and trying desperately to stifle his laughter. It shouldn’t have been funny—the way Harry was able to push Lucius’ buttons. The way Harry was able to look Lucius in the eye with that defiant edge in his voice.
"What do you mean?"
"Um." Harry rubbed the back of his neck, looking uncomfortable. "It's called the room of requirement. It'll change itself to be anything you want."
He had no excuse for his silence.
“You’ve finished the herbology essay, right,” Blaise asked, pointing down at the parchment in front of him. “Could you help me with mine. I’m having trouble with this one part.” Which Luna knew was a blatant lie. Blaise wasn’t having trouble; he was just deliberately not doing it, but then, if that was the way he chose to talk to Neville, then she wasn’t about to rat him out.
"I'll be going back now," Professor Snape had said the morning he'd been preparing to leave.
Needless to say, with all the time Harry had been spending with Lucius, Severus
"Be less articulate," Draco muttered under his breath. Harry's gaze flicked to his face, green eyes flashing in the moonlight. Draco looked away quickly, ignoring the heat that pooled in his stomach.
"Severus," Potter said, his voice quiet and yet still managing to echo through the room. And Lucius looked over, still lost in the look Potter was giving Severus. "What did Voldemort tell you to do?"
"Forgive me for believing you had some kind of plan worked out in regards to defeating Lord Voldemort," Lucius answered. "Perhaps if that's not the case I'd better try my luck with the giants, or would you suggest the vampires? Oh, my mistake, Lord Voldemort has already recruited both of them."
Harry's head whipped around to stare at him, green eyes wide and full of open surprise, and Draco was backtracking before he could stop himself.
“Really?” he said anyway, and Draco skimmed his fingers down his neck in answer, cupping his neck to pull him in for a kiss.
lie to get the prophecy.
"What's through there?" Potter asked, his voice low, suspicious.
"Harry might very well have saved your worthless father," he said. "A strange way to thank him."
“You’ve said that before,” Harry sat down hard, exhaling as if Draco had just punched him. “I didn’t think you meant it.”
. He still didn't exactly see what Draco saw in him, but he supposed it wasn't his place to approve.
about it all?
“But Severus—”
“Lucius told me you went to see Lupin,” Harry said, still not turning.
"Yes?"
"Really," he said. "First back at the house and now this. You're acting like you think I'm weak. I don’t need you to protect me at all costs." Draco just looked at him, his jaw clenched so tight, Harry could hear his teeth begin to grind together. Then he turned on his heel and began to march across the hall, heading for the bedroom door he'd stayed in when he was there during Christmas.
“What are you doing?” he asked.
" he said, and when he pushed again, this time Draco actually pulled away, raising his head to look up at Harry's face. "Please, stop."
"What? Has Snape done something?" Harry answered quickly, and the beating of his heart was so loud he wondered if Hagrid could hear it. Maybe he'd been wrong. Maybe…
There were a couple of close calls, but every time Draco started to turn around, he had a telling tilt of his head that gave him away, and Harry was able to scramble back.
"It wasn't your business," Harry interrupted, his voice rough as he spoke over Lupin, and Draco almost winced at the sound. He sounded terrible—as if he was somewhere between pained and angry, and he hadn't bothered to speak in days. And Draco wondered abruptly if Harry had been hurt during his little adventure.
"I don't want to feel like this," Harry said, and there was that tone again. Severus stared at the new blood oozing from the thick cut for half a second before he sighed, pulling out his wand and healing it with a touch of his wand. He should have seen the signs; sure, he'd had his own problems, but he should have known how much Harry was struggling; there had been plenty of signs.
"We can't go back," Granger said, turning to look at Blaise with an exasperated look. "Malfoy and Harry have already been missing 2 days. Aren't you curious where they are?"
"This needed to be done or your wounds might reopen and infect themselves," Potter murmured, his eyes locked on the compress in his hands. "I'm sure Severus would have done it, but he's still gone, and I don't fancy a lecture on his return."
He'd been heading to the room of requirement, looking to start searching for the diadem. If Draco hadn't interrupted him, he would probably have already found the thing—it wasn't as if he'd
"We are here," Potter repeated, rolling his eyes and gesturing to the small clearing. Draco just looked at it.
"So…?"
“He tried to set me up with Harry knowing he was with Malfoy,” Ginny snapped. “And when that didn’t work, he told the whole school that Malfoy was a werewolf just to spite them. I wouldn’t exactly call that upstanding behavior.”
"We require a free-thinking environment down in Dark Arts Retrieval," Malfoy had said, and he'd looked entirely too pleased with himself. "They don't much care what we dress like as long as we get things done." Harry hadn't said anything to that, hadn't known what to say, had been pretty sure that Malfoy was screwing with him.
"Really? Because I was under the distinct impression that you were the one who convinced him of this plan."
(See the end of the chapter for
"You made it my business when you asked me for help."
about it.
"I don't hate you, Potter," he answered, his grey eyes steady on Harry's face. "I'm not sure I ever did. I was jealous of you, and I was foolish in how I showed it, but I didn't hate you. When my supervisor said I was assigned to you, I figured why not," Malfoy shrugged. "At least, it was a chance to get past all the bad, right?"
"What?" Harry started, surprised the boy had actually spoken.
"Blaise?" he stopped suddenly, Luna's voice echoing down the corridor as she stopped in front of him. She was just inside the line of his light, her blonde hair flashing.
"Potter," Severus said,his voice containing that ordering tone that Harry didn't know why he bothered with. It wasn't like Harry particularly cared to listen to him if he didn't want to. "Stay with Draco," Harry sighed heavily, letting it be known how much he was being put upon, but nodded and Severus let go of the back of shirt. He followed Senior Malfoy out of the infirmary, closing the door behind them. Harry plopped himself down on a bed, reaching across to snatch a grape from one of the plates he'd brought.
kept his eyes away from Harry. "You'll be spending the holiday with Sirius—"
. Where before he had been nothing but panicked and on the edge of repulsed, now he could only think of Draco, of Draco and his hands, and the way he tugged just right, moving down to circle Harry's balls, and Harry cried out as he came, his hand tightening around them and barely noticing as Draco came soon after.
“I simple yes or no will do,” Woods answered, and Harry bit his lip to hide his smile of satisfaction as Weasley’s face went bright red.
"Now, Harry," Draco said, grabbing his sleeve and yanking. Harry stumbled, and Draco lost his balance with him, his broken ankle colliding painfully with the ground. Draco let out a strangle yell before collapsing onto his butt. He glared up at Harry, hoping his indignation was showing quite clearly.
Suddenly, a streetlamp in front of the house went out, making Harry jump. A figure was walking up to his house. He was tall with a long cloak billowing out behind him and silvery hair hanging down his back and reflecting the moon away from him. Harry's eyes widened, he hadn't really expected Dumbledore to show. Turning, Harry scooped up his trunk and banged down the stairs, arriving at the bottom just in time to hear the doorbell.
"It's been almost three weeks," Lucius said, his hand tight around the top of his walking stick. "We should have a solution by now."
“I don’t know what Lupin told you about that year, but I doubt he told you the full story,” Harry said, his eyes cast on Lupin, his voice tight. “Not if he wanted you to trust him.”
"We'll know!" Blaise snapped, and Nott's smiled just widened.
"We need to go," Luna said, and Harry suddenly realized it was her who was holding him up. He heard himself whimper, the cold hopelessness that urged him to just
To Draco's credit he didn't make them wait for him to get dressed or anything, he just grabbed Harry's wrist again and led him straight out of the Slytherin commons and toward the Headmaster's rooms.
Warning: minor smut
Finally,
"Can't you see why we're worried?" Weasley insisted. No. No, he really couldn't. They weren't friends. They hadn't been for a long time. Even before Harry had started playing them for all they were worth, they hadn't been friends. They were only interested in him because of his name. His name and his scar, just like everyone else. He saw it in their eyes then, and he saw it in their eyes now.
"Harry," Ginny said. She clasped her hands together, looking at him through wide eyes. "I didn't mean to—"
"There's nothing to tell."
"Aren't you supposed to be smart or something?" he asked.
Harry was done talking. Topic closed. Maybe for the day. Maybe forever. Draco let it sit for a long minute, debating how to answer. He could tell from the way he'd talked at him instead of to him, that Harry didn't want an answer, if he even wanted an acknowledgement. But Draco couldn't just leave it without saying something to let him know it was alright, that he still had Draco.
"Why don't you ask him?" Dumbledore insisted. "Wouldn't want to assume wrong, now would you?" The house elf's eyes narrowed again, and she slammed the door, leaving Harry unsure if that was a yes or a no.
"Lucius?" his mother poked her head out of her study, fixing her pale eyes on them. "What's going on?"
"I don't think—" Harry tried again.
"I've been dreaming of that corridor for months and—” Potter answered, watching Severus' face with satisfaction.
"I'm sorry?"
"Why what?" Harry asked, though he
Lucius answered, but Lupin just waved his hand and started walking away.
eavesdrop, if they caught him…
"Harry Potter!" Harry jumped, Draco's hand sliding off his back as he turned to face Luna Lovegood. She stopped right in front of them, her eyes flashing with the closest thing to anger Draco had ever seen in her.
giants are, Harry?" Draco asked, feeling as if he could be banging his head against a wall for all good it was going to do. "You could get seriously injured."
"I am not," Harry snapped, locking dark green eyes on Draco in a glare.
"I think I'll leave now," Severus answered, standing with his usual lack of grace and crossing the room with long quick strides. And suddenly Lucius wanted to
"You have no idea how much I wish it didn't take a war and a Dark Lord and my mother dying for me to realize just how wrong my father had been," Malfoy answered, his voice barely a whisper of a breath between them now, and he was looking down, his grey eyes right on Harry's own lips, "No, idea," Malfoy managed, and Harry could just see the beginning of a blush across his cheeks, and it shouldn't have made him want to kiss Malfoy more, especially since he wouldn't have even thought up until that point that Malfoy
"I…" Ron's face died down as soon as he saw the confusion written across Hermione's. "Never mind," he said sullenly.
"Don't pull that shite with me," Draco snapped, and Harry looked up, green eyes startled as they locked with Draco's. But Draco was done. He was done being careful and considerate, and he wanted answers. He wanted answers that Harry was going to give him. He stepped forward, still several feet away and yet knowing he was a close as Harry could be comfortable with.
"I was waiting for Severus."
Malfoy let out a husky shout as his knuckles collided with Harry's jaw, sending them both stumbling across the corridor. He took a single step forward and punched him again. Harry had no idea where Malfoy's wand was, didn't really know why he hadn't drawn it. Though he got the feeling that, like him, Malfoy
"Draco?" Harry said, reaching out for his arm. "What's going on?"
"How fascinating," Draco answered. "Run along to Potter and tell him I am no longer interested." Instead of leaving, Granger stepped closer and slipped into the seat across from him. "That seat's taken," he said. She, of course, ignored him.
"Really?" Severus answered, and his eyebrows raised in that disbelieving way that Harry hated. And he really just wanted to be left alone, but somehow, he knew that Severus wasn't going to do that. Not this time. No matter how hard Harry pushed.
"Harry Potter can't die," the voice said. Was that his name? Harry Potter. It sounded right, bouncing around in his skull with a meaning. "That's just not how it's supposed to happen. You're supposed to do stupid things and- and be hurt," the voice broke, sending a different kind of pain lacing through his chest. He didn't
The door suddenly banged open, making Harry and Draco jump while Severus just looked calmly over as if him pointing his wand as Harry Potter while Draco Malfoy stood watching was normal in everyday circles.
He lifted his head to look around them. They weren’t in the clearing anymore. They weren’t usually when he woke up these days. He could tell they were deeper into the woods, the light filtering past the tree canopy. He wondered where exactly they were, how they’d ended up there, if he’d tried to hurt Harry.
"I'm not sure,” Lucius’ eyes flickered, and Severus knew he was lying though he said nothing as Lucius continued. “By the time I was downstairs, Greyback and Narcissa were both dead and Draco was laying on the floor like-," Lucius stopped suddenly, turning fully away from Severus as if he couldn't bear the thought of anyone looking on him in his moment of weakness.
They were standing in the middle of Harry's room, their robes on the floor, Draco's shirt having followed sometime after. They were standing apart from each other, only their mouths touching as they continued to kiss, over and over and over. And Draco could feel himself growing hard, the frustration, the need to touch and be touched burning through him.
"You're on probation!"
"You little-," Weasley said, but Granger put her hand on his arm, frowning at Harry and Draco with a strange look on her face. Draco had to hold himself back. He had to tell himself it wouldn't help either himself or Harry if he drew his wand and cursed either Weasley or Granger, but he wanted to. He wanted to cross the distance and- He blinked, stopping that train of thought before it could fully manifest.
"That's what Blaise told you?" Draco asked, forgoing the obvious questions and figuring he could ask them all later. There were more important things.
"McLaggen was being an idiot apparently," Weasley said, and when Draco looked over at him, he was frowning, his eyes dark with something close to understanding. "Harry took a Bludger to the head. Pomfrey said he'd cracked his skull, though it was an easy heal."
been because of what happened to Harry. But it also hadn't been. Draco had been against the Dark Lord longer than he had cared what Harry's first name was, he just hadn't had the courage to admit it until he'd seen Harry writhing on the floor with the glowing red eyes of Lord Voldemort. "This isn't about him, Severus. This is about me."
"Why don't you just go talk to him? Isn't he like a first-year or something. He'll think it's a blessing from the universe."
When they’d let out, Woods hadn’t said much besides that they’d done a good job, and the tomorrow would tell. Then both she and Lucius had disappeared. Harry hadn’t seen them again until he and Draco had walked into the court room this morning, waiting for the Wizengamot to come in and announce their decision.
"I think that's all for today," Severus said, clearing his throat. Draco didn't miss the way he shivered when Potter spoke.
“Look, Draco,” Blaise said, his dark eyes locked on Draco’s. “I just wanted to say that I’ll help however I can. And as much as I didn’t like Potter before, I think I get it now.”
"Really," Harry answered, pressing forward to kiss him again.
"I…" He hesitated, biting down hard on his lip. He tasted blood on the tip of his tongue and immediately stopped. Malfoy's did
"Draco?" Lupin's voice echoed along the stone corridor, making Draco turn around and snarl at him, his teeth bared in a feral sort of way that he made a note to be embarrassed about later. Lupin just stared at him, his shoulders tensing as if he too were holding himself back. "What are you still doing at the castle?"
"Tell me, Lucius," Harry frowned at him. "Have you told him how you feel?"
"That can't be a true memory," Draco whispered, seconds after they'd dropped out of Slughorn's memory. He looked up, his eyes meeting Dumbledore's easily. "Slughorn tampered with it, didn't he?"
standing beside Draco, across from Blaise, as if he'd been there the whole time, as if Draco hadn't been in the middle of a conversation, as if they hadn't been Not Talking in class minutes before.
"Johnson!" Harry answered, feeling numb and disbelieving.
"Get out, Potter," he said. "And if I hear you've been telling tales, you'll regret it." Harry's eyes widened in shock, and he probably spent too long staring at Snape, because after a minute the professor opened his eyes and sneered. "Why are you still here? Would you like me to give you a weeks' worth of detentions, Potter, for gaping like a fool?"
"You're asking for my help?" Lucius asked, and Severus had to resist the temptation to roll his eyes.
"But Harry also said the bottle was supposed to be a gift to Dumbledore, so maybe it was meant for him," Ginny said.
and you're just now telling us?"
"Then stay here. I guess I'll hear what happened to the rogue werewolf in the morning, won't I?"
How convenient.
“Uh,” he answered. “Hullo.”
"Good luck," Draco called, and Harry hesitated with his hand on the door, looking back at Draco with a furrowed brow and sad green eyes.
He could remember bits and pieces of what had happened. Mostly it was all a big blur, as it usually was when he transformed. But he did remember Harry's Animagus form yowling in pain, Harry's shouted spell, Blaise and Granger's Stupefy.
There were voices around him, echoing along the corridors, but Harry was wrapping his arms around himself, trying to breath normally around the tightness in his chest.
"Harry," Draco said, shifting in his chair, and wincing quietly. "I knew what I was signing up for."
"So," McGonagall asked, her lips pressed together, expression stern, eyes gleaming. "You're saying if we raise our children the way the ministry wants us to raise them, they'll grow up to be inflexible and barbaric."
Draco moved over to the large black cabinet, running his hands along the sides before wrenching the door open and staring into it. It seemed as if the magic was still pulsing through the wood, strong and intact, but one could never truly tell.
it when Malfoy was being forceful. He was so sick.
"I- he… He knows I'm… I'm in love with you, Lucius," Severus said, his voice so soft Lucius was sure he had misheard. As it was, he could only stare, uncomprehendingly at the man before him, feeling utterly lost. And then he was talking again, leaving Lucius behind in the turmoil of his mind. "He knew he could manipulate me with it, so he did. He told me that I was to kill Albus Dumbledore or he would kill you," Severus eyes snapped open, looking straight at Lucius and asking him to understand, begging him. Lucius just stared back, feeling completely overwhelmed.
"Mr. Potter," Umbridge said, having finally arrived at the scene. She began to question him, though most of his words were lost to Draco. He held out the paper to her and Draco's eyes widened, sensing an incoming disaster. He flicked his wand under the table as the entire great hall fell silent in anticipation of the incoming argument. "Are you trying to make me seem like a fool, Mr. Potter?" Umbridge snapped. "This is blank. There is no interview here."
~~fin~~
And then he remembered Draco's face, his disapproval and anger when Dumbledore manipulated him. Draco's voice echoing through his head, 'You deserve to be happy. You.' telling him how it wasn't his job to save the world, telling him how he always ran into danger and never considered the consequences. Draco looking at him with poorly concealed concern and telling him to be careful.
But he didn’t know how. It had always been Draco who made the first move. It had always been Draco who encouraged. As idiotic as he knew it sounded, Harry wasn’t even sure if he was allowed. He knew
“So?” Draco asked when it was clear Harry wasn’t going to say anything without prompting.
"Who indeed?" Blaise raised an eyebrow, poking his pheasant with the tongs of his fork. "Even if they all had to end so tragically." Slughorn laughed, but Harry himself found himself just staring at Blaise. His attitude seemed strange to Harry; he didn't seem to have any fondness for his mother, nor though did he seem to have any scorn. It was as if he didn't care either way. It was an indifference toward his family that Harry just couldn't understand.
"Your hair is down," he said. This was one of the few times Lucius had let his hair down, and it was falling in waves around his face and down his back, probably becoming a big tangled mess that he'd have to sort out later. A sure sign something had happened to make Lucius upset.
"You're not going to apologize," Lucius asked, following the billowing cloak Severus always caused as he walked. "These things usually go both ways, you know."
Lucius saves the day. Almost.
"It doesn't," Draco soothed.
"Really?" Harry snorted, his eyes never leaving Severus' face. "I find it easy. Perhaps you should try it before you doom yourself to an eternity of unrequited love with Lucius Malfoy."
“I needed to know,” Draco answered, his voice just as dark, angry. And Harry felt a savage kind of satisfaction shoot through him.
"You need to relax," Draco said.
"Wait!" Harry said, stepped toward him, but Draco backed away. "Draco, I didn’t mean—"
"Yes, Professor," Harry answered and Draco snorted. Harry threw him a dirty look when Dumbledore wasn't looking.
"I know a good place not fair from here," he said. "We could walk if you'd like."
he yelled, sending the ball of green energy hurling through the air toward the Dark Lord. Who was no longer there. Harry stared at him, eyes wide and full of horror but he simply couldn't bring himself to regret his actions, no matter what Harry might think of him.
"I think Severus is glad you didn't die," Harry interrupted, plucking another grape and studying it.
It wasn't as if he'd never been interested in boys before, but this was Potter not just
"Yes, they were very close in school."
Harry spent most of lunch tracking down the Grey Lady. His stomach felt hollow, his hands shaking as he moved through the corridors of Hogwarts. He couldn't remember the last time he'd eaten a full meal. It wasn't yesterday; maybe the day before…? He was sure he'd had a snack before he went to bed last night.
It seemed like it lasted forever; Harry curled into himself, shaking and crying out and Draco could do nothing but stand there and stare. Eventually, it stopped. Harry's body gradually relaxing as he pulled his hands away from his face, his eyes hazy with residual pain.
"I think that's Harry's choice," Draco snapped, raising his chin before he could stop himself.
Draco’s eyes were hooded, his face pale, sweaty. He looked on the verge of passing out. And Harry wondered for the millionth time what the point of coming here had been.
"We've been on Prefect duty?"
"A good boyfriend would help me when I asked."
"And what about Draco?"
They searched for what felt like hours. They looked through pile after pile after pile. Draco could feel Harry get more frustrated every time they came up empty handed. He could tell Harry was reaching his breaking point as they worked their way down the rows and still had nothing to show for it. After Harry let out a loud groan and threw down the necklace he'd been holding, Draco called a stop.
"I-," he started. Harry's eyes narrowed further, and he switched tracks. "How did you know how to do that?"
He knew his father had pulled a lot of strings to get this to happen. To get a prisoner out of Azkaban if only for a few minutes, if only to talk to a young, confused werewolf. Draco took a breath before he pushed the door open, shutting it firmly behind him.
“And did he? Have a connection with the boy.”
"Just give him a
"Because, once again, we are one staff member short." Dumbledore answered, which only made Draco narrow his eyes further. He was hiding something. Dumbledore was always hiding something. Draco flicked his eyes toward Harry, who looked just as confused and he had to bite the inside of his cheek to keep from hexing Dumbledore. He could understand keeping information from him. Hell, he could even agree with it, it wasn't as if he'd been the best Order member this summer, but he had thought they had all agreed that Harry had earned the right to know the truth of things.
And then he was pushing in, and Harry was pushing against him, and Draco had his face buried in Harry's neck, and that was most definitely his excuse for why he didn't see Sirius Black until he cleared his throat. Draco wrenched his head up, staring over at the man while Harry tensed against him. He stepped to the side, shielding Harry's naked lower half from Black's view as he continued to glower at them.
"What?" he answered, jerking away before Harry could touch him. His hand dropped, hurt flashing across his face. "How would I know?"
"Ah, Professor Snape," she said, looking up when her door opened. "Very good, Mr. Nott. Oh, and Mr. Malfoy too, Very good, very good."
The goblin turned on his heel, leading them deeper in. He stopped before a large cavern, eyeing them darkly for a long minute before gesturing around the next corner. Luna frowned at him as if even she sensed something wrong.
"You know what I mean," Lupin answered, his smile tightening just a little too much to be comfortable. Harry wasted half a second wondering why the man bothered; it wasn't as if he was fooling anymore.
"Harry?" Granger interrupted, suddenly right there. "Everything all right?" She placed a hand on his shoulder, and Harry jerked away from her.
"Yes, well. Voldemort didn't know you." He turned to Harry. "would possess the 'power the Dark Lord knows not'—"
"Well," Dumbledore said, his voice was quiet and yet it still managed to echo around and drill into Severus. The old man had always managed to look down on him, to judge him for his mistakes. He had hated him for as long as he could remember. "This is it, Severus."
"Anything for you, lover," Malfoy smiled against his ear and Harry shivered again. Draco slinked down Harry's body until he was aligned with his open groin. Harry groaned when he nuzzled it and felt Draco’s smile. He carefully pulled Harry's pants down to expose his erect penis. And then he just looked at it.
"It was no big deal." He tried to pull his hands away, but Draco kept his grip firm. "I'm just reading his mood or whatever and—"
"Because Mr. Malfoy is part of what I need to tell Potter."
"I'm not hungry."
"We should get lunch," Draco said as they stepped out of the Potions classroom. Harry threw him a strange surprised look before his eyes focused back on the students all around them, the ones who were heading toward the Great Hall.
“Like it's some big secret?" Draco answered, and Potter blinked, blushed, and dropped his eyes.
was going to fix that. And Lucius was still teaching potions, having become a better head of Slytherin house than Severus had ever been.
It had been a week before Severus spoke again. He knew Severus wasn't mad. He knew Severus was in as much pain as him, but he simply couldn't bring himself to break the silence anymore than Severus apparently could. Something inside him was broken; the same thing that kept leaking inside him. The same think that had made it impossible to cry when Cedric had.
"And…?"
him to hex her until she couldn’t use her hands again.
"Well," Moody answered, "better get him up, we need to be heading to St. Mungo's if we're going."
"I'm sorry," she hiccupped, wiping her eyes, "I just—"
"Yes, sir," he answered. He stood and hesitated, waiting for Draco to rise before standing himself. “Sir, am I allowed to tell Ron and Hermione everything you've told me?" Draco tensed, but he kept his eyes on Dumbledore.
"The room of what? Wait—a what?" Zabini asked, sounding annoyed. Annoyed and confused. Harry probably took too much pleasure out of that.
"You've told him nothing?" Severus asked.
"No. No, it has to do with Draco…" Lucius sighed, took a drink of tea and then sighed again. Severus opened his mouth in the following silence and then apparently decided it would be better to just let Lucius talk when he was ready, for he closed his mouth and took a drink of his own tea, scowling probably at the amount of sugar he'd put in.
After a minute, the sound stopped, and he cautiously uncovered his ears, watching as everyone else did the same. Harry was the only one who hadn't moved, staring into the cauldron with that unreadable expression of his.
"Well, you didn't want to know at the time, did you?" Severus answered, his dark eyes flicking to Lucius and then away. He glared at his window as if
"What did my father want?" the voice sounded across the corridor, loud and demanding and altogether too familiar. Harry looked up, meeting Draco's silver-grey eyes easier than he should have been able to.
Severus suddenly felt very angry. Horribly righteous anger for whoever had pushed Harry so close to the edge. And yet, he was also relieved; the past few years, he had started thinking Harry couldn't feel anything as mundane as hurt.
Harry gulped, irrational panic shooting through him. What if Malfoy was so disgusted, he leaves? Then Draco looked up at him and smiled pleasantly. He licked a clean stripe up Harry's length, making Harry shudder as his silver-grey eyes never left Harry’s.
for help with your problems.”
"Draco," Harry said, recovering before Blaise.
chest. He simply couldn't see Voldemort's eyes in Harry's face.
"To be mated to Harry Potter. I pity you," he said, the same pity in his voice as when he'd first told Draco they were mated. And Draco suddenly understood why. He'd thought it had just been for Draco, because Draco didn't want to accept it, but it had been because
"I don't think anyone understood Dumbledore," Draco said, moving to stand at the railing beside Harry. He was still too far away, restraining the anger he could still feel bubbling beneath the surface.
"But-," Draco looked back at the castle. He could still feel the siren going off in his head, but now that it wasn't dominating his other senses, he could feel something else. A faint scent to the wind, a scent of death and darkness. He looked up and the customary shimmer that covered Hogwarts was gone. The wards had come down, that was why the sirens had sounded. He looked at Harry, eyes narrowing. Suddenly, the conversation he'd overheard made a lot more sense.
"Harry Potter," Harry said, his eyes narrowing as the wizard just continuing staring as if he'd never heard the name Harry Potter before. It was an… interesting reaction. "Blaise Zabini, and Luna Lovegood."
"There are many ways to practice Occlumency," Severus said. "The way Mr. Malfoy employs Occlumency is indeed the most effective but also takes the most time to master. You, however, do not have the self-discipline or the cunning to use such a technique. You will need to rely on brute Gryffindor strength alone."
"But how do you
"Potter—" Draco stepped forward.
And then suddenly there were Death Eaters all around, outnumbering them. They circled around, blocking them in as if they'd been standing there the whole time. Harry realized by the smirk on Malfoy’s face that this was exactly what was happening.
"See you later," Potter muttered and then was gone out the door. Draco just sighed, a long drawn out sound as he looked after him. It struck Blaise through the gut; he'd never heard Draco sound like that. He'd never seen Draco look after someone like that. Not in the long years they'd been in Hogwarts together. And he couldn't stop himself from wishing it wasn't
Harry shook his head, staring at Draco as if he’d lost his mind, dark hair falling over his glasses. He was still holding the Honeydukes bag as the portrait swung shut behind him. And Draco couldn’t help but laugh again at the memory of the way Lucius had stared when Harry had told him they were late because they’d been buying candy.
"Can you not call him that?" she answered, crossing the empty classroom to sit beside him.
Lovegood was already moving off to the left, and Draco could only hope that she was actually looking for the right thing. Harry looked at him once before heading to a different towering pile of junk. Draco followed him purely on principle.
"I…" Harry answered, turning away from Sirius Black. "I told him you were here but he… he didn't believe me, he said…"
"Thank you, Draco," Dumbledore said. "Now, I think you should be heading down to the infirmary. I'll call up Severus—"
And, of course, Severus had taught him that the best way to destroy a dark artifact was with Basilisk venom. After that realization, it was only a matter of directing the Basilisk in the right direction and then placing the little black book into his mouth before he bit down. Neither the Basilisk nor Tom Riddle saw it coming until Tom Riddle was crumbling to dust and the Basilisk was free to do as he desired.
"Oh, I try," Slughorn said, smiling in a rather self-satisfied way. He stood, pointing out several photographs lined up along his cabinet. "All ex-students. All signed. You'll notice Barnabas Cuffe, editor of the
. It was easy to find Malfoy's office once he was at the Department of Dark Art Retrieval. Malfoy had a large black sign along his door, painted in black script letters, his door shut tightly. Harry ignored the woman who gawking at him, her hands shoved into the pockets of a bright yellow dress and shoved the door to Malfoy's office open.
"Well." Draco's lips twisted, leaving Harry to the conclusion that Draco was a much better sneerier than Ron could ever be. "I admit it's nothing to what Harry's been doing this year but then he has had Severus' old potion's book."
He found he wasn't the only one perplexed, both Ginny and Neville stared at Blaise with a fixed kind of fascination throughout his conversation with Slughorn. That was until Slughorn turned toward Neville and started asking about his parents.
“I’m leaving,” he said, standing abruptly, the edge of his thigh brushing the chess board between them, and the rook that was sitting just on the edge of the board fell. He flinched when it hit the ground, the sound louder than it should have been, and Severus was still just staring at him as if he’d been expecting him to run away from the beginning.
"Stop doing that," Harry snapped, throwing his paperwork across the desk in favor of glaring at Malfoy. Malfoy, who was sitting on the edge of
"You mean you could blackmail and pay people off."
"Be quiet, Harry," Dumbledore murmured, looking intently as Draco. "Or I am afraid you will have to leave my office." All eyes were on Dumbledore now, waiting for his next move. Waiting to see whether he would dispute Draco's charges or be forced to admit to them.
"Harry!" a high-pitched girls' voice called as soon as Potter stepped inside. She swooped down from the ceiling dressed in Ravenclaw school robes and pigtails. Her smile was wide and just a little manic as she stared at Potter, but he just nodded to her.
"What do you want me to say?" Draco answered, his voice so low Harry almost missed it. "What
, exactly? His affair with Blaise? Draco turned the words over in him mind for a moment before frowning.
