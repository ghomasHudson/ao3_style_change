It wasn't with great difficulty that Draco chose to contact his former Mind Healer. Draco quite liked her, and he had to admit that she'd helped him a bit. Of course, he was by no means "fixed," but he'd still made a vast improvement. She was patient, compassionate, and never patronizing, but most importantly, she held patient confidentiality in the highest regard and didn't give a rat’s arse who you were. If you needed help, she was there to give it.
“Right,” said Harry, remembering their accidental visit during fifth year, “But for natural problems…there’s nothing?”
She pulled him over to a surprisingly impressive drinks station, one of the low study tables transfigured into a wide table that held all sorts of beverages. Butterbeer, firewhiskey, eggnog, some sort of punch (undeniably spiked), and even water were all laid out haphazardly, ready for the taking.
“I was born in the U.S.. In the state of Colorado, to be exact. I'm a Muggleborn, so you can imagine how shocked my conservative, Catholic Mexican parents were when we found out I had magic,” Estrada grinned. “I went to Ilvermorny and decided to study medicine sometime during that. I went to a Wizarding med school in the U.S., but wanted to come to London to do my residency and actually practice. Which is...what I'm doing now.”
Draco pushed his tongue eagerly into Harry’s mouth and Harry responded back in kind, feeling lightheaded in the best kind of way. Harry wanted him desperately, and being pressed up against Draco’s lean body and feeling his hot, heavy breaths against his mouth just made Harry want him more. Harry pulled away, his hand still on Draco’s face, tracing his bottom lip with his thumb.
Sorry this is so late, a lot is happening in my life. I've never written Luna before this fic so if she's OOC I apologize. Thanks for being patient, and thanks for all the comments/subs/kudos ❤
Draco glanced nervously at Granger and Weasley. They were talking amongst themselves, heads bent towards each other. Potter saw him looking, and Draco couldn’t hide the worry on his face.
“They’re from his snake,” Harry said before Draco had to ask. Draco didn’t have to ask whose snake, either. He saw it vividly in his mind, slithering towards the professor the Dark Lord had murdered on his family’s table. It must’ve shown on his face, because Harry whispered, “Draco?”
“All I’m saying is, I haven’t seen aggression like that in ages, and I’m in university,” Samuel said, lifting his hands, a smile playing on his lips. “So
It was only two PM, but Draco had been at work for nine hours already. He wondered if he could leave early. He’d already finished with his rounds, after all, and he had tomorrow off, barring emergencies. He could feel himself crashing, the caffeine only leaving him with a headache and tired eyes.
Blaise’s laughter suddenly broke off; he was now staring at Harry with an unsettling intensity. “This ‘someone’ better be who I think it is, because if not, Potter, I’ll personally dismember you and dump your remains in the River Thames.”
Draco would never get over the way Leo said ‘Potter’; it was so appallingly American. He had to laugh.
He checked his watch. With a start, he realized he was fifteen minutes late. It’d taken him longer than he expected to summon the energy to get up from the couch and find clean clothes.
“And obviously, I chose to go back, but sometimes…it feels like I should have stayed,” Harry finished quietly.
And then Harry and Malfoy were left alone once again. Luckily, this time, they were pissed. Well, Harry was, anyway. But Malfoy had to be too, right? He looked happy for once (sorry, that was a shite thing to say). Harry soon realized that he was thinking too much, and Malfoy’s gaze was wandering to the other side of the bar.
Malfoy unzipped Harry’s trousers, finally letting Harry's throbbing cock out in the open. Hard and swollen, Harry gasped as Malfoy took it in his palm. God, he was so fucking hot; that masculine yet graceful hand taking control, its arm covered in dark ink. Malfoy expertly slid the pre-come over Harry’s cock, and even that was heaven to Harry.
Draco snaked forward until their noses were inches apart; his pale face came in focus and it was smirking haughtily.
"Ruminating on it," Draco responded, looking him square in the eye, his face bland. "Using unhealthy coping methods as a pretense for moving on when you haven't gotten to the source."
He’d taken the other two pills the next day while Ginny was in the shower. The day after that, he dutifully went to see Wolff, pretended everything was Going Great, and made a stop at Johnny’s to smoke a spliff with him before heading back home.
After group was over, Harry bid goodbye to Samuel and hung back outside, waiting against one of the brick walls of the library exterior. A few moments later, Draco exited the building, Cait in tow.
“Mine were acceptable,” Pansy said, and Draco fought not to roll his eyes. “Did something happen, Draco? Over the holidays?”
“Thank you, Healer Estrada,” Draco said, though a smile tugged at his lips. “I’m assuming you’ve gone to check in on Potter?”
Pansy and Patil had recently struck up an unlikely friendship, sparked by their mutual adoration for certain magical creatures.
“Insomnia is another common symptom of substance withdrawal,” Malfoy explained. “You have to tell me everything, Potter. Every little thing may count.”
“Nothing – your eyes are just a bit red,” she commented, cocking her head and giving him a sad smile. “Good session today?”
“God, believe me, I haven’t,” Harry said, coming ever closer. “I know you find this hard to believe, but I really like you, Draco.”
He didn’t want to worry her. It’d hurt him to see her worried; she was one of the strongest people he knew.
It didn’t matter much after the Easter holidays when he was forced to stay in the Manor. He felt sick just thinking about that time, how the days crawled past, how his mother had tried her best to comfort him when she herself was near breaking point, how
PS do British people call weed "weed"? I know spliff is used instead of joint, but what about weed itself? That said, lots more drug talk in this one! Be careful my pals
Surprised by Potter’s bluntness, Draco could only nod. He finished chewing and swallowed, trying his best to choose his next words carefully.
“You’ve got enough on your mind right now, Potter,” Draco said sternly, “And more than enough to keep you busy. You’ve got to focus all of your energies on – “
“No, I want to too,” Harry finally said, dilated eyes meeting Draco’s own. “I’m - let’s. Please. Just – fuck, Draco, fuck me.”
He checked his watch again as he spoke; if he left in six minutes, he would have fifteen to get ready, and five to get to the restaurant. He wondered what he would wear; he’d never been to the restaurant Potter had suggested, and he didn’t want to appear underdressed…Muggle clothing was the obvious choice, but what, exactly…
But it did, another part of him argued. He wanted so desperately to know what he was doing here, amongst Muggles, after he had slinked into anonymity after the trials.
And all this on top of a complicated rivalry that spanned over six years. Draco didn’t know what to think.
Harry was already completely hard, leaking slightly with pre-come. Draco licked his lips and bent down close.
“If I were to believe what Ms. Skeeter has written, I would think that you and Healer Malfoy have had a turbulent relationship ever since you were children.”
Potter was gritting his teeth and avoiding Draco’s gaze. Draco was taken aback – out of everything he had guessed, this was not one of them. Shock quickly turned to confusion.
It was harder to get used to the fact that he and P- Harry were kissing in the first place. That he and Harry had crossed the line of friendship into some unknown territory.
"Yes, of course. You won’t be able to stay here forever, though, just so you know. Will this room be acceptable? We could move you upstairs to the more long-term -"
Hermione sighed. “I didn’t think she’d be able to come so early, with both her and Blaise so busy –”
Harry’s hand fell back down to his side. It was only then that Draco realized he was half-hard, his erection pushing uncomfortably against his trousers. He flushed and hoped Harry didn’t notice.
Ginny. They resumed things after the war, but it felt wrong. Forced. He was alive, sure, but not in the way he was before. He often wondered if he’d come back wrong after dying.
How could he have let this happen to himself? Although, he thought, some part of him had wanted this, right? Fine, he was in trouble last night – he could admit that. But he didn’t need to stay here and “recover.” He just needed to get back on his feet and get out as soon as possible. He felt nauseous just thinking about the media getting ahold of this – Harry Potter reemerges in St. Mungo’s after…how many years was it now?
“Sort of,” Potter answered. He shoved his glasses back on and bit his lip. “Maybe not in so many words.”
“Oh yeah, er, I think we have it somewhere…” Harry was trailing off, looking at the sea of boxes before him. “Draco? D’you know where we put the Floo powder?”
He took off his glasses and tossed them onto his bedside table, his cock hardening as he watched Draco take off his trousers and climb onto the bed. His erection only grew as Draco came closer self-assuredly, that gorgeous smirk on his face.
Satisfied, Draco stuck his wand in his pocket and opened his door. He was immediately welcomed by the slightly interested (or rather interested, by their standards) face of Ira White. Ira, head of the Aletta Wellensly ward of the same department, was lanky, as blond as Draco, and genderfluid.
“Really,” Potter said. “I was just following instructions Sn- someone had written in the textbook before me. I never knew what I was doing.”
“I’m glad your standards were that low,” Draco said, “Because if they weren’t, I’m not sure we could have.”
didn’t like. He still looked at Draco with that strange, worried, confused expression, and he still tried to get Draco to talk to him. And really, Potter should feel lucky that he’d gotten any information out of Draco at all. It was no easy feat – Pansy and Astoria could attest to that.
But then Potter became defensive. “Why? I’m sure you Slytherins don’t cozy up and spill all your feelings to each other, so why should we?”
the abandoned loo that Moaning Myrtle occupied but shouldn’t the elves clean it properly anyway? Or they could at least do a better job of it.
Harry was one hundred percent convinced that Draco Malfoy worried too much for his own good. He probably even
Which led him right back to the question which had been bothering Draco since Potter had first cornered him in the bathroom: what was Potter doing hanging around him? Surely, he had better things to do, better people to spend time with. Maybe it was that Draco was just so pathetic and pitiful that Potter felt a moral obligation to help him. It didn’t make sense no matter how Draco put it, but he
Draco resumed his attention to Harry, who was still lying, vulnerable, breathless, ready beneath him.
“No,” Draco said immediately, looking at Potter’s hand with distaste. “I’m fine. I just need…a moment to collect myself.”
A knock at the door made Draco jump. He spared a glance in the mirror and quickly flattened his hair. And then he realized he was still wearing his pajamas. They were fine for himself and for his home, but for Harry? He agonized over it for a few moments before giving up and going to answer the door, already embarrassed.
“This is nice, Draco,” Harry told him appreciatively, his green eyes once again sweeping the room. “That one’s vanilla, the other mocha. Hope you like one of them, I wasn’t sure what to get.”
“Potter again, huh?” Harry questioned, but he accepted Draco’s request, drawing his fingers away. “Fine,
“Hasn’t done anything wrong?” Pansy repeated with a scoff. “Don’t make me laugh. Your entire relationship was built on him wronging you.”
Harry melted instantly, feeling light-headed as he watched Draco suck his finger, his eyes glued to Harry’s own. He could barely bite down a moan as he continued his exploration of Draco’s bare torso and sure enough, he found his way back to Draco’s left forearm. It was mesmerizing,
“Oh.” Malfoy seemed troubled. He turned to the girl, Betty. “Inform Miss Granger and Mr. Weasley that Potter has woken up. I believe they went home for the night so you’ll have to fire-call them.”
Malfoy’s breaths were hot against Harry’s face as he went to suck on Malfoy’s neck, his own heart thudding loudly under his chest. He heard Malfoy give a little sigh as he did, making Harry’s cock twitch. Harry bit tentatively into the soft skin and Malfoy gave a little
He loved Pansy and always would – they were childhood friends, after all – but conversations with her went one of two ways these days, gossip about classmates he could care less about, or his ‘path of self-destruction,’ which he wanted to avoid for obvious reasons.
“I agree,” said Harry, who was still cringing in his seat. “Think you should discontinue that, er, other one.”
“I don’t know what to expect, Healer you with all the reassuring words and kind smiles versus rude you who really just gets off on insulting me. And fucking me,” Harry added thoughtfully.
Draco worked on his Defense Against the Dark Arts assignment for an hour before he fell asleep, the Dark Lord tainting his hazy dreams.
She didn’t ask it cruelly; she merely asked it. Draco looked over at Astoria in surprise, and she looked back at him evenly. Damn the
"He was found overdosed on a combination of potions and alcohol - he's been stabilized since, but he needs guidance. I know you have experience with addicts…and of course, war trauma."
“And you look better now than you did at the beginning of the year,” continued Harry. “I mean, er, even more fit.”
Draco shot Ira a silencing glare. Eternally grateful that no one was in the break room but them, he gritted out, "If you'd like to take a walk over to your office, we can continue this conversation there. Otherwise, please stop talking."
Draco was good at staying inside his head and bottling everything up, and Pansy knew this. She worried, and Draco wished she wouldn’t. She kept telling him that she was always there if he needed to talk, as if she’d never told him that before. But even if he did want to talk, what would he say? That he was as depressed as ever but talking to Potter made him feel a bit more normal, at least for a little while? And now that Potter was back to (rightfully) treating him like he didn’t exist, Draco had nothing to relieve him from the numbness and despair that overtook him?
“Yes, of course,” she said, nodding. She came out from behind her hostess stand and began walking into the dining room. “If you’d follow me, sir.”
Draco tensed; Weasley’s voice served as a reminder of the outside world, so different from this strange limbo consisting of him, Potter, and the balcony. It reminded him that he wasn’t wanted - that he was undesirable and wrong and Potter was everything but.
They were sat in the abandoned History of Magic classroom; Binns didn’t have any more classes for the day and had retired to his office. And, even if Binns did happen to come back inside the classroom, he wasn’t exactly the most observant professor in the school.
Harry nodded, and Malfoy performed the Disillusionment Charm. As soon as the egg-feeling was gone, Harry turned away and made for the door. Malfoy, apparently too taken-aback to respond immediately, only moved when Harry had already left the office.
“Why?” he challenged, suddenly annoyed. “If I can’t joke about it, what the fuck else am I supposed to do?”
“There were two ingredients that had the potential to be deadly when mixed,” Hermione explained. “I’m sure that’s why they had to perform the cleansing procedure.”
They moved to the sitting room after breakfast, Kreacher dutifully cleaning up after them. Harry stuffed his hands nervously in his pockets and watched Draco, working his bottom lip and wondering what to do. Draco himself was walking slowly around the room, studying everything with great intensity.
After climbing up too many stairs, Harry pushed open the door at the top of the tower. Draco watched him look around before turning to Draco.
Cursing softly, he let it fall to the ground in order to examine his fingers. That’s what he got for staying in his head. Draco Vanished the cigarette and stood, brushing himself off. He turned and was greeted by a familiar sight.
And here ends part one. I wonder if I'll be able to tie the entire story up nicely and have fourteen chapters in part two as well. Fingers crossed?
It was ridiculous, he knew, but he was a ridiculous person. Pansy had told him just how ridiculous he was being when he explained his predicament, and urged him to ask Harry as soon as he could. He agreed, knowing he shouldn’t put off answering his mother any longer.
and the rest of the Death Eaters were trying to kill you over and over again. It was a noble cause, but me? It was just so
What worried him more was the upcoming winter holidays. He wasn’t sure if he should go home or stay at Hogwarts. The Manor didn’t feel the same after the Dark Lord had occupied it; Draco didn’t know if it ever would. It was harder to forget the war when he was there, harder to shake off the nightmares, harder to feel like there was a point to living.
“You’re welcome, Potter,” said Malfoy before turning to leave the room. He opened the door and said, “Oh. Ginevra. It’s good to see you.”
“I always knew,” Harry insisted, “Some part of me, at least. It was buried underneath all the other shit I had to worry about. I just couldn’t put a name to it until two days ago.”
Draco watched as Potter sat in a chair, his shoulders tense, and something like affection tugged at Draco’s heart. He shook it off and returned to his task of making drinks.
“She doesn’t get out much,” Malfoy answered. His grey eyes were on Kathy. “I think it’s the opposite with her. If she stays in the house, it’s like nothing’s changed outside.”
Harry scrambled out of bed and rushed to his desk, grabbing the closest parchment and quill he could find. He scrawled a quick message –
He imagined what their faces would look like if they found out. As if being a mental Death Eater wasn’t enough, he was also…
Potter made like he was going to retort but sighed and shook his head instead. Running a hand through his dark hair, he said, “Can you believe we’re still relying on house stereotypes, Malfoy? Feels just like old times. But anyway, Hermione and Ron spent the last few years trying to get me to talk about my feelings, and now that I finally want to, they’re too busy shagging to even notice.”
The fact that Potter was showing real emotion sent a strange thrill through Draco. The fool Gryffindor was gritting his teeth and looking around as if
Draco froze. Panic took over him as he frantically wondered what Harry was going to say. What was it? Why was he being so serious?
“Oh, so there’s feelings attached?” Ira asked, leaning closer and voice changing. “It wasn’t just pure filth?”
wanted to leave St. Mungo’s and take a walk like he said he did, he would have to build up the strength for it, both mentally and physically.
“Ginny’s also told us that you were thinking of going outside. Did that…ever happen?” asked Hermione in a small voice.
Draco had already nervously thrown up the breakfast he had eaten under Harry’s watchful gaze. Luckily, his boyfriend was too busy cleaning his own room in suspense of Weasley coming back to Hogwarts today, along with the rest of the students. This left Draco alone to do as he wished, telling Harry that he’d be cleaning his own room too.
He got out of bed and shoved his glasses on, nerves driving him quickly out of the bedroom. He padded down the hallway and stairs, keeping an eye out for a head of white-blond hair.
“Yes, well, he is very capable, both as a leader and a Healer. Healer-in-Training Burke,” Mitchell said, extending a hand towards Betty, “can testify to this, I’m sure.”
“Oh, I saw him. He looked incredible, naturally. Better, really, in every shape of the word. I was hoping to just get him out of my system, but the opposite happened.”
he feel better after sleeping in his bed for the first time in two nights. It was a step up from his desk, and Draco woke up feeling relatively refreshed considering he’d only slept four hours. And it was only ten – excellent. He had enough time to shower and make a quick breakfast before heading back to work.
“Wha – Potter, what are you doing?” Draco hissed, though he allowed himself to be taken down the hall.
"Apologies, Master Harry," Kreacher bowed, shooting a glare at Hermione. "I informed the Mu - Mistress Granger that you were preoccupied -"
Draco paused. “He did seem rather…irritated this morning, but his mood improved considerably once we’d begun talking about his discharge. By the time Ginevra Weasley arrived and he got his wand back, he seemed to be in good spirits.”
The owl fluttered its wings and took off through Draco’s window, leaving him to lean back in his chair and contemplate further.
When he’d finished his tea and toast, Draco gathered his things and Apparated back to his office, feeling slightly more prepared for what was in store for today.
Draco crossed his arms and observed his coworkers at work. Leonel was deep in thought, his eyebrows furrowed and hand on his face. Betty was nibbling her lip, her forehead pinched in concentration as she scribbled on her own notepad.
“How do you always look so good, Potter,” Draco asked as he bent forward, his breath tickling Harry’s ear. “Even when you throw on week-old clothes, you still look so
“Apology accepted, Potter,” Draco said uncomfortably. “It's hardly the worst I've been treated by a patient.”
When he didn’t see any of them, he headed to the bar and ordered a gin and tonic. Stirring and sipping absentmindedly, he leaned against the bar and people-watched. He was in the middle of watching two young witches giggling and falling over each other when he felt someone come up beside him.
She turned and came over, a cup of coffee in her hand. She glanced at Harry for a second before addressing Damien.
But he was interrupted by a knock at the door. It opened a second later and in came someone Harry didn’t know. She was tall – her heels adding to her height, and had a well-practiced smile.
“Oh, look at the time! I promised Daddy that I’d help him plant new Snargaluff. I’m so sorry, Harry, but I’ve got to go.”
It was strange not sitting with Harry at dinnertime. The Great Hall had been reverted back to its original layout; all four tables back where they should be. Draco sat with the other Slytherins at one end, and Harry with his Gryffindors were at the other. He felt vaguely lost.
Once he thought Harry was ready for another, he put a second finger in, and then a third. After some more pumping, Draco spoke.
They only waited for a minute and a half when Potter’s body tightened and clenched, his back going stiff and lifting several centimeters off the bed as he writhed. He yelled out, his hand curled into fist and face scrunched in pain.
Draco swallowed thickly. His skin tingled at the thought of another man touching him – he hadn’t pulled since they’d broken up, and if it was Leo himself who broke the spell…
“It’s morally wrong,” Draco explained, answering Ira’s silent question. “I’ve a duty to heal him and nothing more. It would be wrong to take advantage of him.”
“The one and only,” Draco said bitterly, and finally sat down in the chair across from Ira. He slumped in his seat and pressed a hand to his face. “What the fuck am I meant to do, Ira?”
“What if you can’t help? I know you can’t even conceive of it – the thought doesn’t even cross your idiot hero brain, but you can’t fix everything.”
Draco watched Leonel as he concentrated on the television. Leo was enraptured, his eyes glued to the screen, his chin dug into the palm of his hand. Draco could barely bite down his smile as he stared at the other man, enjoying the now rare sight of Leo relaxing at home.
Estrada looked away again, avoiding Harry’s eyes. The same as before – something tugged at Harry. What was it?
Draco pressed his soft lips to Harry’s neck before sucking gently, swirling his tongue and eliciting a soft moan from Harry. He held onto Draco tighter, fingers pressing into the other man’s back as Harry felt himself yielding and his cock hardening. Draco trailed his tongue up the side of Harry’s neck and Harry shuddered.
“Could you classify those potions and take a look at those ingredients? See if anything reacted badly with another?”
“Yeah, I thought it would be,” Leo went on since Draco refused to speak. “No worries. I think some part of me always knew that we were finished for good.”
And then he was sobbing. The tears ran faster and heavier down his face and he was gasping for breaths that didn’t come; he clutched onto Potter, who held back just as tightly and didn’t make a sound.
He led them into the bedroom he'd been using - one that hadn’t been personalized. For a while he debated upon sleeping in Sirius' old room but he couldn't bear it. The thought of displacing any of Sirius' things (any more than they already had been) made Harry’s stomach turn.
Harry finally did stop, backing away with a smile that told him that he was very proud of himself. Draco shuddered.
Leo was right, wasn't he? Just because they weren't dating didn't mean they couldn't fuck. People did it all the time - casual sex, no strings attached.
Kathy nodded. She had heard similar things from Malfoy before, evidently. Harry wondered how long Malfoy had been coming to the meetings. He’d have to ask Samuel later.
Weeks passed, then months. Draco wasn’t sure if he was losing weight – he knew he was only seeing a distorted image of himself. Still, he studied his reflection any chance he got. Touching, squeezing, grasping his skin, his
Harry blinked, genuinely surprised at both himself and Draco. He didn’t realize it before, but yes, he really did want to spend time with Draco, Ron, and Hermione as a group.
Harry nearly laughed from the absurdity of it all, but instead replied, “I'll admit it wasn't one of your best ideas.”
“Don’t get me wrong, group helped too. A lot. I’ve made some good friends there, I think, and everyone’s been so nice. But Draco…he understands in a way no one else does. I mean, you obviously do too,” he added quickly, not wanting them to get the wrong idea, “But I just don’t want to keep bothering you-“
“Since Ginny is back in town, we were thinking of going out tonight,” Granger explained. “You know, to let off some steam. Would you like to join us?”
She proceeded to perform diagnostic spells and wrote the results on his chart at the foot of his bed. Harry shrugged in place of a real answer. He wasn't sure if she saw him.
Draco had to refrain from rolling his eyes once again – where’d Harry even learn these awful lines? – and instead took a disinterested sip of his decaf.
Hermione took hold of Harry’s hand and looked him in the eye. “You’ll get through this. We’ll be here no matter what and help you however you want us to.”
He wondered what Potter was doing here at six o’clock on a Saturday morning, staring right at Draco when he hadn’t looked at him fully in weeks. He was standing a few feet away from Draco, his wand and some parchment clutched in his hands.
“Looking for you.” Potter’s answer was immediate, which surprised Draco almost as much as the answer itself.
And without another word, Draco left the bathroom, going as fast as he could without actually running, leaving Potter gaping and still kneeling on the dirty, tiled floor.
Harry wanted to kiss Malfoy again but he didn’t know if he could. But fuck it – the exhilaration, endorphins, and alcohol all culminated into him being someone he hadn’t been in a while: reckless.
Draco could hear Potter calling out to him but he didn’t stop; his legs were moving on their own accord, his flight or fight instincts having kicked in.
“Not that I know of,” Ron said, pausing now too to match Harry’s gaze. He was frowning. “I never even thought about it before, honestly. Maybe it just never occurred to the people who made St. Mungo’s however long ago.”
Harry then realized why Draco was so shocked - he had just spoken about how he could hardly bear to go to the Manor, his old home. He got panic attacks from finding old letters, while Harry welcomed reminders of the people who once lived here. Sure, this place reminded Harry of bad times, but of good ones too. Besides, what other home did he have? (Well Hogwarts, but he couldn’t bloody well live there).
Draco pushed Harry to the ground, where he looked up at Draco with shining eyes. Draco leaned down, his cock hard, and he kissed Harry again. His hand moved down Harry’s torso and found his cock; with a thrill he realized that Harry was just as hard as he was. Harry let out a low moan as Draco stroked it through Harry’s trousers, which reminded Draco of where they were.
Harry scoffed. “What did he need you for, anyway? He just worked for Voldemort until it wasn’t convenient anymore. Then he just ran away cos he's a coward," Harry told the card feverishly. "I was actually fighting against Voldemort, I
“I understand it’s none of my business,” Blaise said, tightening his tie sharply, “But I’m curious, and you have woken me up once or twice.”
Thankfully, Johnny said nothing more of Harry’s abrupt disappearance and began rummaging around on his filthy table. “Sure, yeah. Just got a new shipment of Xanax today, actually. How much?”
“I know,” Draco murmured, crawling over to cup Harry’s face in his hand. Harry shivered. “And we can continue, or we can move on.”
“I’m surprised at you. Didn’t Granger start that pro-elf group back at school? SICK, or SPIT, or something?”
Potter kissed enthusiastically, passionately, just like Draco always imagined he would. Draco kissed back, open-mouthed, trying to put as much feeling into it as possible; he rested his hands tentatively on Potter’s chest, the cloth soft underneath his fingers and palms. Potter was warm and he felt good, tasted good, and he forgot what they were even arguing about a few minutes ago.
Harry took Draco's face in his hands, making him look him in the eyes, feeling Draco’s sticky tears trickle through his own fingers. Draco looked like he'd seen a ghost and Harry wanted to undo it.
Draco finished right after, his fingernails clawing into Harry's lower back and seemingly staying quiet only with great effort. Slowly, he pulled out of Harry, leaving him sticky and dripping.
“Wouldn’t it be better to just get it over with instead of rushing to get a terrible job done in a week?”
They lapsed into a comfortable silence, enjoying the quiet and each other’s company (although Draco couldn’t speak for Potter, he somehow didn’t think it was a far-fetched assumption). Suddenly, the sound of Weasley’s voice carried from inside the Room out onto the balcony. It sounded like he was drunkenly calling for Potter.
"Hermione – er, what're you doing here?" he asked nervously, pulling the blankets up to cover his bare chest, though this was the same Hermione who'd saved his life and had to see him shirtless to do so.
Her voice was thick, but there were no tears. Ginny was still a woman who was rarely weepy, and yet, Harry had seen her cry twice in the past week. Because of him.
“It’s different, Potter,” Draco said, all the energy gone out of his voice, “And you know it. This is…intentional.”
It would be so goddamn easy. He could put on the Cloak and just walk out of St. Mungo's. Maybe even sneak into fucking Malfoy's office to get his wand back so he could just Apparate home. He didn't think he could walk all the way back, and he had no money on him, Muggle or Wizarding.
Draco stopped short, skidding to a halt in the corridor. Potter paused and glanced back at him curiously.
He trailed off, unsure of how to explain it. Betty let go of the braid and it swung away, returning to its place behind her back. She chewed on her bottom lip nervously.
When he walked into the kitchen, he saw Malfoy at the sink, pouring water into one of Harry’s glasses. It was unbelievable just how breathtaking the sight was, because it really was just Malfoy in his crisp, white button-up and (fairly) tight black trousers standing in Harry’s kitchen.
He glanced up, chewing his bottom lip in nervousness. Malfoy had a peculiar expression on his face, and when he met Harry’s eyes, there was a flicker of a smile. It changed his face completely for a split second.
Wolff sat down in her seat across from Harry. He couldn't easily identify her age; she could have been anywhere from 35 to 45 years of age. Her face was lined faintly, and there were grey strands of hair in between the hazelnut. Her brown eyes were soft as they regarded him.
“No,” Draco said quickly, and Leo’s grin only grew. The bastard. “I’m just…supposed to be meeting someone.”
“Of course,” Leonel said. “All the patients are doing fine. Not too many today. And anyway, I was actually about to leave – unless there’s anything else you need me to do?”
Astoria’s voice grew soft. “What if Pomfrey didn’t tell her? You’re a legal adult; she’s not required to.”
“You already know a lot about me, don’t you? By the way, some constructive criticism: you could share more, y’know. I, for one, would like to get to know you more, at least.”
Once he was done, he rolled up his sleeves and turned on the tap to wash his face off. He felt numb, which was something that happened whenever he had a violent crying session (though luckily they didn’t happen often). He thought he preferred it to sobbing uncontrollably, but it was still peculiar going from feeling such strong emotion to none at all so quickly. Draco turned the knob.
Everyone he used to be close with were gone. Pansy and his mother had left the country, and Draco missed them terribly. He even missed his father some days. Growing up, Draco was never alone – he always had company, whether it was his parents, their many guests, or the parade of house-elves in their employ.
So was he just supposed to ignore the fact that they had gotten each other off not five minutes ago? He didn’t really remember how this worked – this pulling thing.
Potter didn’t listen to him and stayed where he was, dark eyebrows furrowed again. Draco sat himself up wearily.
Mostly, it was Harry. Merlin help him, it was always Harry. Draco was sure that if he knew Harry was staying at Hogwarts,
Harry nodded as Hermione released him and wiped her eyes. She stayed sat on the bed as Ron swept her hair away from her tear-streaked face.
The iconic theme song began playing as the yellow words flew onto the screen. Harry leaned forward eagerly, ignoring Draco’s whine about it being too loud.
Hermione looked apologetic, Ron frustrated, Malfoy surprised, and the American Healer (what was his name?) was simply stunned.
“I fell yesterday,” Harry said. “I wasn’t watching where I was going and I tripped up the stairs to my house. It felt like – like the pathetic end to a pathetic day. I dunno. But, er, anyway, I got inside and I checked to see the damage to my knee, to see if I got cut or anything. I didn’t, and…I was actually disappointed.” He tried to laugh, but what came out of his mouth sounded forced and wrong. “I was disappointed to see that I wasn’t bleeding.”
Though he didn’t quite understand her nervousness around him, he much preferred it to the hatred or fear that some bore towards him.
Potter frowned. He opened his mouth, closed it again, and then said, “And what about the, er, making yourself…y’know…”
The two turned and left without any preamble, four pairs of eyes glued to their backs. They turned back to their original positions.
Embarrassed, Draco tried to backtrack. “I mean, of course, it’s completely fine if we aren’t, I was just wondering - “
“Obviously, stopping the intake of all of these drugs would be the opposite of beneficial, so we’ve been cleansing your bloodstream of all the alcohol and potions that are present in this moment. It won’t take away years of damage, but it
Potter pulled on Draco’s arm again. Draco fought before submitting, letting himself be forced down from the one step he’d climbed and turned to face Potter. He slowly released his grip on Draco.
“Oh, come on, Harry, you’re not that daft,” Ginny rolled her eyes. “It has everything to do with now. Some part of you has
Her voice was softer now, and Harry breathed a sigh of relief. He looked up to say something, but as soon as he did so, Hermione straightened up and said firmly, "But Harry Potter, if I ever see you with any drugs at all, I'll march you to Dr. Wolff's office myself."
Draco thought that perhaps he’d made a garbled choking noise, but really, who could fault him? It wasn’t as if Harry bloody Potter played with his hair every day.
“Oh, I wouldn’t tell anyone. It’s just, you know, I’m ridiculously bored after submitting my new potions in for approval by the Ministry. I’ve nothing to do.”
“Draco, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to make you upset. I was just surprised,” she said in a lower voice, uncharacteristically gentle. “You can still tell me anything, you know.”
“Say no more,” Blaise said. “I understand. Well, regardless, I recommend you tell Pansy soon if she doesn’t know already, because if she finds out that you’ve been seeing someone without her knowledge, she’ll be mad at you all over again.”
In all his panic, Draco had nearly forgotten what had even caused this mess. As the truth settled in his chest like a cold, heavy rock, he found that he really just wanted to be asleep again. But Potter was here now, and Draco didn’t think he could sleep more even if he tried.
Leonel’s dark curls were swept back out of his face, save for the loose coil that never obeyed like the others did. He was clean-shaven and smelled discreetly like his American cologne. Draco had always preferred him with a beard, but Leonel liked to be shaved for work. And, well, he was fit either way.
“He almost killed one of my best friends,” Harry said hollowly. He blinked, looked at Estrada, and scowled. “What am I even doing here?”
“Forgive me, I’m just having a hard time believing that Granger and Weasley would push you aside so easily. I mean, if
“Now there’s ambition for you.” She studied him seriously for a moment when he didn’t respond. “Well, alright. I’m glad things are going well with you and Potter. This friendship is an improvement over you pining away after him, day after day.”
"You lot are living relatively normal lives," Harry said incredulously. "I mean, as far as I know, you've got careers and family and partners –“
It was still lit in their room and Draco sat down on his four-poster bed, relishing the silence and privacy. His habit was one that required privacy, after all. It was hard with Pansy’s watchful eye, but he was careful. He hardly went right after meals; he almost always ensures that he spends at least an hour with Pansy and Blaise after dinners before going to the loo. Lunch on weekdays was easier in that respect, with their differing school schedules and the chaos that came with the entire school bustling about.
Harry’s face warmed. “Great. But that doesn’t answer my question. Why was he looking at us like that?”
Pansy raised her eyebrows at Draco when he returned to the Slytherin common room later that evening. She had been reading in an arm chair in a secluded corner. He sat down next to her and she put her book down on the arm rest.
Weasley’s hard stare had never left Draco; only when Potter began walking did she tear her gaze away and turn her back on the two Slytherins.
I really struggled with this chapter. Like going back and forth wondering if it was right or wrong or good or bad or if it fit or if it was out of place but I still don't know! Let me know what you think, I would really truly appreciate it
“Now we only have our final papers left,” Draco said, gathering his notes and placing them neatly in his bag. “For this class, at least.”
The portrait swung open, the lady in the portrait hardly paying him any mind, and Harry looked back to where Draco was before climbing through. Draco followed nervously, unsure of what to expect.
For the rest of the day, Draco’s mind drifted back to Ginevra’s letter. He couldn’t help but entertain the idea of having lunch with Potter (and her). It
“Fine,” Draco said, averting his gaze once again. “But if any one of us dies, you’ll be held responsible.”
“Harry! Draco!” cut in Kathy, aghast. “I am all for getting your feelings and emotions out but this is completely counterproductive and unsuitable for this environment! I suggest you rein it in if you’d like to continue participating in group. If not, I’ll have to ask you to leave.”
mesmerizing even though Harry’s seen it several times now. The markings were so beautiful, so intricate, and Harry felt he could run his fingers over it forever.
He looked down at his watch then, and glanced towards the room only to meet Sam’s eyes. The other man raised his eyebrows and Harry gave a little shrug. He looked nervously towards Draco, whose face was impassive, and by the time Harry looked back, Sam had gone.
“I’ve brought you a clean set of hospital robes, Mr. Potter,” Betty said as she set it down carefully at the foot of his bed. She then placed a plastic bag on top – there was something in it. His hoodie, probably. “You can put the clothing you’re wearing in there for now.”
"I'm sorry," Harry said after a few moments of silence. "I just - I don't know how it got this far. None of this feels real. I've almost...forgotten..."
“I was there. That night,” Potter said, his eyes meeting Draco’s own. “With Dumbledore. I saw you lower your wand.”
He smoothed his hair down and took out the spare robes he kept in his office. He quickly replaced his wrinkled robes with the fresh ones.
“Alright, I won’t,” Draco said. “It’ll be up to you, then. I know Estrada well, and I know he’d be receptive to the idea.”
mention the attempted murder, right?” Draco asked. His fingers shook as he lifted the cigarette to his mouth, and he doubted it was because of the cold. “I think that might trump torture.”
“Thanks,” said Draco. He picked up a plate and began spooning food onto it, his mouth watering. “You’re a life-saver, Leo. I haven’t eaten since lunch.”
hint of this whatsoever – so when I just walked in on the two of you in bed together I didn’t know what to think!”
would eat this up, aren’t you?” Draco asked, swallowing tightly and trying to focus. Potter was now swirling disconcertingly above Draco, and it didn’t help matters in the slightest. “It’s not everyday they see their hero playing with a Death Eater’s hair.”
Draco yawned, exhausted despite having slept for so long. He realized he was still completely naked and dug around the foot of his bed for his underwear. After getting them on, he turned to look at Harry, who was sleeping peacefully beside him. Draco gazed at him fondly, the usual warmth he felt now tinged by guilt and sadness.
It was only when he looked into the mirror that he saw that his nose was bleeding. He touched a finger to it and looked down at it in slight surprise. He'd never seen that before.
Draco nodded, feeling entirely insufficient. Harry ran a hand through his hair. He looked so exhausted – the kind that went past not getting enough sleep.
He hardly registered the sound of footsteps coming up behind him. It was only when he’d stopped long enough to lean against the dirty stall and pant that he saw Potter kneeling beside him, his blurry face etched with worry. Draco gave a weak chuckle and closed his eyes, his head pounding and the taste of vomit strong in his mouth.
Harry went on sucking and Draco closed his eyes, consumed by pleasure. He kept on going, trying different techniques as Draco made small sounds of contentment.
“I don’t know about nice,” Leo put in. “Definitely interesting. I just don’t think he ever warmed up to me the way he did to you two.”
Harry gritted his teeth. So Hermione would try to pass it off as him not being clear-headed as well?
“You’re not bad,” Potter nearly growled. “You were put in difficult situations and forced to do difficult things. It was all out of your control.”
“No, no it’s not an escapade,” Harry sputtered. “I swear. Draco, I uh, don’t really know…I mean, what I mean is, it meant more to me than that. You mean more to me…than that.”
Pansy didn’t say anything for a bit. Draco wondered if the others in the room were staring at them. His cheeks burned, but he didn’t move. He just kept staring at Pansy, who stared back. Finally, she spoke in a cool, even voice as she picked up her book.
“And nobody will know you’re here, either. Healer White and I will make sure nobody outside of this department knows, alright?”
Harry sighed, vaguely relieved that he had gotten here. Although he didn’t remember much of the past few days, he did remember that he had really wanted (needed?) to get to St Mungo’s.
Harry Apparated to the outside of the Muggle pub they frequented – “they” being some variation of the old members of Dumbledore’s Army (something that felt like ancient history to Harry). They tried to meet up once a month; attendance had been higher immediately after the war. Over the years, only a few of them continued to come regularly.
Draco wondered if it was worth the risk to confide in Ira. They were relatively trustworthy, yes, but
“Did you tell Healer Estrada or Trainee Healer Burke about this when they came in to check on you earlier today?”
“So do I,” Harry admitted. “I should have told you earlier that something was up…you’re my closest friends but I don’t show it enough.”
“Draco, I…” Harry began, running a hand through his hair. He was nervous all over again, remembering the moment they’d had before Hermione and Ron had arrived and wanting to know what it meant. “Do you…”
“We’re happy for you too, Harry,” Hermione said, and when Harry raised his eyebrow at her, she grimaced. “I mean, well, I’m sorry we didn’t react so well. I was just so surprised – I mean there was
Pansy stood and walked around the table to reach Draco. She looked at him evenly with pursed lips, like she already knew what to expect from him.
“Well, on Christmas Eve, I got attacked by Nagini, who was hiding in a corpse, by the way, and my wand broke. So I was out of commission the next few days.”
Harry wrote Ginny an owl on Monday evening, asking if he could come over whenever convenient. She wrote back with a note saying
He flushed but didn’t look away. Harry’s full lips were still shiny with moisture, and Draco couldn’t help but stare at them. He wondered what it would feel like to kiss those lips. To kiss Harry.
) and he ran his hands over Draco’s chest, skimming over everything in his reach, marveling at just how
“Blaise is going back to New Zealand tonight and I wanted you two to properly meet,” Ginny explained, her voice firm. “You’re both very important to me and I can’t have the two of you at each other’s throats forever.”
will be here. Hermione’s going to her parents’ home for the first bit, and then she’s going to spend the rest of the time at the Burrow.”
“Come, Betty,” said Ira, standing and placing a hand on her shoulder. When she looked up at them with confusion, they said, “We’ll go get you another drink.”
and turned so he was facing Harry, his face screwed up, apparently annoyed at being woken up. He frowned (pouted?) at Harry.
“Well, Ron and Hermione asked me what I was doing for winter break, and when I told them I didn’t know until I asked you, they were surprised to say the least.” Harry paused, a slight grimace on his face. “So they asked why it mattered so much if you were staying or not, and since I didn’t have a good enough answer, they kept asking. And then, y’know, short temper and all that…so I told them that, funnily enough, I cared where my boyfriend was going to be for two weeks, and if I could, I’d like to be with him during that time.” Harry paused again. “That got them quiet, but it also got half the common room quiet as well.”
A light cough snapped him out of his daze. Harry looked up and his eyes widened in surprise; Malfoy was standing next to him. He wondered when they had last stood so close.
He watched as Draco watched 12 Grimmauld Place appear. His lips parted, his eyes enraptured as finally the old house settled in between the two Muggle ones.
“Fine.” He kicked a rock near his feet; it flew into the lake with a loud splash. “Ron and Hermione still aren’t convinced that we should be friends.”
It wasn’t until the next morning that Malfoy came back with openings for an appointment with Dr. Wolff.
“I know that,” she snapped harshly – on the defensive again. “You think I don’t? I mean it, though. I’ll chain myself to him if it means it’ll stop him from using.”
Harry was interested in hearing more, but the heat of Draco’s gaze was enough to drive his curiosity away (for the time being, at least).
“Doesn’t matter,” said Draco. He pulled Harry over to him by his cloak and undid the clasp. “I’m just glad they didn’t see this; I don’t think I would have survived if you had to take time to discuss that, too.”
“I realized I’d forgotten my favorite quill here, and doing research feels quite different without it,” Luna said, now threading her fingers through Ginny’s long locks. Ginny blushed deeper. “But I regret interrupting your conversation. Harry, are you feeling better? Ginny can always make me feel better when I’m not feeling well.”

Yes, he desperately wanted to be closer to Potter. He missed the inconsistent, borderline uncomfortable conversations and the way Potter ran his hand through his thick, messy hair and how he helped Draco forget how much he hated himself and living, even if it was just for a bit.
“Mr. Potter, please,” Estrada finally spoke. His voice wavered slightly, but he stood his ground. “You know that he’s changed. He’s been redeeming himself for years and he’s proved himself to be a good man. He wouldn’t be a Healer otherwise. And I
He was definitely nervous now. The last time Harry had that look on his face, he’d told Draco that he died.
Draco hesitantly moved closer and reached out to place a hand on Harry’s tense shoulder. There was a blur of motion as Harry turned and embraced Draco, holding onto him as if his life depended on it. Draco was surprised into not moving before remembering himself; he wrapped his arms tightly around Harry.
Draco snorted into his drink before having some more. He savored the sweetness and the tartness that intermingled in his mouth, and the slight aftertaste of alcohol that lingered afterwards. He took another drink, his eyes once again falling on Potter. He’d never seen Potter drunk before, and it was almost surreal. It seemed not so long ago that they were both boys engaged in petty school rivalries, and now –
“Yes?” he stopped in front of the closed door and directed his gaze at Potter, who was wringing his hands in his lap.
“No, everything’s fine, everyone was perfectly civil, don’t worry,” Draco said, taking her wand arm and pulling gently. “Come on, let’s go.”
“Maybe they’re right,” Draco said slowly, avoiding eye contact. “Maybe we can’t be friends, given our past. It’s just too messy and I’m too bad and wrong and I’m sorry-“
“Stop,” Harry growled. “You weren’t one by force. It wasn’t like your life ambition was to be a fucking Death Eater, you weren’t – I dunno –
Draco crawled over to him until his face was level with Harry’s pelvis. He pulled down Harry’s sweatpants with force, impatient and irritated from being interrupted twice now. He pushed down Harry’s pants – finally – and pulled them off, tossing them to the side.
Hermione was looking at him with concern in her eyes. Even Ron looked worried, all the tension in his body gone.
He quickly tidied up, sending things back to where they belonged – dirty robes, old socks, empty mugs and dishes. He made his bed haphazardly, grunting in frustration when one of his pillows fell off to the side.
I keep worrying that I'm recycling dialogue/situations from my other eighth-year fic but I think I'm alright. It's definitely been a while since I've looked at it though, so who knows.
“It’s been a while since I’ve been in here,” Harry said, glancing around the room. “You said Zabini was going to be gone the entire day?”
Draco dug his hands into Leo’s shoulders and screwed his eyes shut as Leo swirled his tongue around Draco’s cock, his own hands grasping Draco’s thighs. Leonel sucked him off like an expert, taking him whole and sucking hard and licking and swirling and –
“There’s all sorts of groups,” said Harry. “For people with addictions to alcohol or Muggle drugs, for people who are grieving…for people with mental illnesses.”
It was with a strong sense of déjà vu that Draco was stopped on the staircase, though this time he’d gone up far enough to be concealed by the curve of it.
“I’m glad you know you’re mental already,” said the mirror. “I didn’t want to be the one to break it to you.”
“Yeah, I would,” he answered with a grin. “Owl me, yeah? I reckon your schedule is a bit more demanding than mine.”
“No one will see you,” White said, voice gentler than Harry had ever heard it. “And anyways, they’re false windows. Nothing out there but brick.”
Draco looked up at Harry, expecting to see revulsion (at worst) or tolerance (at best) on his handsome face. Instead, as Harry’s eyes ran up and down Draco’s frame, the only way Draco could describe the expression on his face was wonder. Draco felt his face heat up.
The two pairs both slowed as they approached each other, coming to a full stop a few feet away from each other. Potter was dressed warmly in what looked to be a handknit jumper with a large ‘H’ on it and a black beanie pulled over his head. Ginevra Weasley stood next to him, her arms crossed and looking ready for a fight in a thick scarf and a matching jumper marked with a ‘G.’
Potter stared, as if he was trying to figure Draco out. The intensity of his gaze made Draco uncomfortable, and it made him remember the last time they had this much eye contact – seven months ago in the Manor. Draco felt simultaneously ill and aroused, making him even more disgusted in himself.
They all sat in silence for a bit, Harry still staring at the opposite wall for fear of breaking down (he would not let that happen – he couldn’t). Finally, Hermione cleared her throat.
“Well, there’s the common denominator.” At Potter’s questioning look, Draco said, “You also told me while you were drunk, remember?”
“You haven’t seen any bottles, have you? I’m fine,” Harry said truthfully. “I’ve…been sleeping loads better…since you.”
The scratchy kind of sore that made him wince with every swallow, the kind that came with shoving your fingers down your throat and retching up food that was meant to stay down. But if this was the price he had to pay to feel empty, he’d pay it over and over again. And he did.
Slowly, he said, “We have to do this right. If anything happens – anything – I’ll never forgive myself.”
“Ginevra Weasley,” Draco answered. “However, I decided not to attempt to call her as her work requires her to travel extensively.”
He received a visceral reaction from Harry at those last two words; a startled blink of the eyes and a quick, sharp breath in. Draco relaxed in his chair, satisfied.
Spidery letters floated out of her wand and into the air, identifying what foreign chemicals were in his system. Betty gaped, and Draco didn’t blame her – the list was extensive and rather worrying. A good number of the potions induced sleep. Draco tried to ignore the sickening thought that rushed to the forefront of his mind – had Potter tried to commit suicide?
The guilt was short-lived and lessened as time went on; they sat and ate in silence as they watched two more hours of reruns. It
“So are the potion levels,” said Leonel, frowning at the red swirling shapes in front of him. “I’ll have to determine what potions are in his system.”
“Careful, Pansy,” Draco drawled, sparing a glance at her. “One might think you’re jealous of the Weaslette.”
Speaking of which, it was almost time. He and Harry had decided to take a walk down to the station so they could greet their respective friends. Harry would be here any minute.
“Well,” said Draco hesitantly, “I understand if you feel indebted to me after so generously gracing you with my presence.”
“Consider yourself lucky,” Draco sighed. “I’ll have to go back work soon, just in time for the holiday season.”
Harry nodded, his face feeling like it was on fire. He tried to bite down a smile and failed. He glanced over at Draco, whose face was colored a light pink. Samuel smiled as well.
Draco caught Ira looking at him carefully, and so he chose to take a drink instead of answering her.
spent so much time complaining about my own problems and never spent any time on yours. It was unfair and selfish and I’m sorry.”
“Er, sure,” Harry said nervously. He avoided Malfoy’s gaze at all costs as he looked around vaguely, not really making eye contact with anyone. “Well, my name’s Harry. I found out about this group pretty recently, although I’ve lived in this area for a few years now. I’m, er, looking forward to it and to getting help and all that…”
He entered Draco easily, but Draco still winced as Harry’s cock pushed into his arsehole. He relaxed as Harry pulled back slowly; Draco mourned the fact that he couldn’t see Harry’s face as he did so. His head was bowed, looking down and focusing on what he was doing, his chest rising and falling lightly. Draco was about to ask what was wrong when Harry thrust into Draco again, harder and faster than the first. This time, Draco couldn’t contain the low moan and it escaped, deafening in an otherwise silent room.
This time, Harry did spit out his drink. It dribbled pathetically down his chin and onto his shirt. Harry grabbed some napkins and dabbed at the front of it, his mind still on the ridiculous question Malfoy had just asked.
“You already know the answer to that. You begged me to meet the visionary Hermione Granger a few times, remember?”
Harry let out the heavy breath he’d apparently been holding and wiped his palms on his jeans. What was Malfoy playing at? He’d been completely closed off this morning, not wanting to speak to Harry in the slightest, but then he’d gone and went all soft on Harry, telling him he could talk to him at any time?
"Just thinking about how I'm fucked up," Harry said after a few tense moments of silence. "So just the usual."
“Look,” Harry said. “I know my limits. I know what I can talk about. I know what I want to tell you – and there’s a lot, to be honest. I…feel like I can tell you anything.”
“That’s the third time you’ve checked your watch since I’ve walked in here,” Leo said impatiently, “And that was only five minutes ago. What is it? Am I boring you?”
Draco left about half an hour later, thanking Ron and Hermione for the meal and their hospitality, allowing Harry, Hermione, and Ron to talk candidly. Harry was a bit sad to see Draco go, but knew it was for the best – spending three straight days together was a bit extreme, and could there really be too much of a good thing?
“It matters cos you can’t even stand up, you git,” Potter ground out. “Now come on. We’re either going to Pomfrey or to get food, so choose one.”
Harry nodded. He was surprisingly relieved that he could stay at St Mungo’s longer. He didn’t think he could do it on his own yet.
"Your vitals are excellent," Betty remarked as she let the clipboard swing back down and walked closer to him. She hugged her arms to her chest. "Mr. Potter? How are you?"
He retrieved his glasses and shoved them on as Draco gingerly slid a long-sleeved shirt off its hanger. He watched as Draco got dressed and combed his fingers through his hair. Harry realized belatedly that Draco always wore long sleeves around Hermione and Ron. And come to think of it, had he ever pushed them up in group before?
“Wonderful,” said Malfoy, clasping his hands together like the insufferable prat he was. “Potter, this is the final step of the cleansing procedure and will be much gentler than the past two were. All we must do is administer two potions and perform a spell to make them interact like we’d like them to.”
“They’re brilliant. There’s Ron, who I’ve known him since I was eleven. He’s the funniest bloke I know and dead loyal. We used to mess around in school all the time…and there’s Hermione, who’s his wife, and I’ve known her just as long. She’s so clever and brave and I dunno what I’d do without her.”
Samuel simply shook his head. “You’re a complicated man, Harry. I feel like the more I learn about you, the less I know.”
Draco’s gaze predictably fell on Potter at one point; he sipped at his drink as he watched Potter talk to the girl Weasley. Her brother and Granger were nowhere to be found, and Draco was reminded of Potter’s words and blanched.
“Listen, mate,” Ron said quietly, his eyes glancing over to the bedroom. “I’m uh.” He scratched his head. “Thinking about proposing to Hermione.”
“So I wanted to tell you that I spoke to Ron and Hermione. I apologized for being distant and said that I should have just opened up to them earlier,” Harry took a deep breath, “And then I told them that I’m bisexual and I was seeing someone.”
on his plate, but her interrogations had lessened greatly. She still regarded him with either sadness or anger, but she kept her mouth shut more often than not.
The world was still spinning, albeit less so now, and all Draco really wanted was to lie down. He felt like absolute rubbish; his entire body was aching and he knew that he would only feel worse tomorrow morning, which didn’t improve his already low spirits.
“Speak of the devil,” Astoria said lowly and nodded her head at the two figures coming towards them.
The silky way his name slid out of Draco’s mouth went straight to Harry’s cock, and he sucked harder, deeper, wanting to give Draco every bit of pleasure possible. This just made Draco demanding; the hand in Harry’s hair now took hold of the back of his head and forced Harry down on Draco’s cock. Harry nearly gagged on the force and surprise of it but quickly recovered, up for the challenge. He took Draco whole and sucked hard, making Draco writhe and moan deliciously.
They parted and Harry took in the sight of Draco just centimeters away from him, his grey eyes vibrant and his lips swollen and pink.
He was holding the same papers he had had earlier that day. Betty was at his heels, carrying what looked like a hospital gown.
He cut off Harry’s response by kissing him hard on the mouth. Harry gave a moan and Draco had to hear more. He began trailing down Harry’s body, kissing and sucking and licking everywhere he went - Harry’s collarbone, his chest, nipples, abdomen. That oval scar. Harry shuddered.
Draco had filled out paperwork for a patient that would be discharged later that day – a young woman who’d been brought in late last night. Her friend had supposedly been “helping her” by spiking her drink Befuddlement Draught. She defended herself, saying she just wanted to push her in the right direction, though instead of a push, she’d given her friend a shove.
Draco looked wary but released him. Harry was relieved he didn’t have to say anything else when Noc flew back in, swooping onto Harry’s pillow once more. He unattached the scroll and read Ron’s note:
Potter flinched, just slightly. Draco would have missed it if he blinked. It felt like a dagger was slowly being wedged into his heart, and he only had himself to blame.
Potter blinked before he hurried inside, closing the door behind him as if he were afraid Draco would change his mind. Which to be fair, Draco was very close to doing so.
He kept his head down as he walked through the corridors, wanting to be invisible. He was still in denial of the burning sensation in his eyes, half-hoping that if he ignored it long enough, it’d go away. Of course, that wasn’t how it worked.
“And then,” Harry continued, more nervous than before, “That day after Potions, when I tried to get you to talk to me-“
Draco scoffed. “Hello, Potter, I know I’m not obligated to care for you anymore but here I am anyway? Oh, and I know you think I hate you and perhaps you hate me all over again too, but the truth is I’ve just fancied you since I was a teenager and still do today which is fucked up in several ways.”
He felt like crying when Harry’s lips pressed onto his own. Draco’s face burned as he opened his mouth and Harry did the same. They kissed slowly, carefully, like they were testing the waters. Uncharted territory. Harry’s lips were slightly chapped but still so soft, so perfect. He could get lost kissing Harry like this.
"If it's such a chore then just stop," Draco snarled. "Find someone else to help and just leave me alone."
His breath smelled rancid and his arse was exceptionally sore, but Draco stayed. He rolled onto his side and watched Leonel sleep, feeling an ache settle in his chest.
They finished up the breathing exercise, Harry continually finding it harder to concentrate on nothing with Draco’s thigh pressed against his own.
“We gave each other handjobs in a public loo," Harry said very quickly, his face heating up an extraordinary amount.
They parted and finished their butterbeers in comfortable silence. When they went to bed ten minutes later, they lay in the dark and cuddled up against each other, and Draco said so quietly Harry almost missed it, “I’ve been sleeping better, too.”
“The Muggles have a term for it, did you know? The Florence Nightingale Effect. It’s when patients think they’ve developed romantic feelings for their caretaker, given their vulnerable state and gratitude towards the caretaker. But it’s not real, Harry.”
“I’m fine,” Potter said a touch impatiently. “I don’t want to talk about that right now. I need – I need a distraction.”
So naturally, he shouldn’t have been surprised when he fell to the floor simply after being hit by a moderate stinging hex, but he was.
He winced and rubbed at it. “Hello, Blaise. Will we have the pleasure of seeing your plus one more often, then?”
“I’m the happiest I’ve been in a while, Pansy,” Draco said truthfully. “Really. And even though being around Weasley and Granger brings up things I don’t want to think about, Potter makes it worth it.”
“Of course I did,” Hermione answered without shame. She finally wiped her tears away brusquely. “She has a right to know that you’re in hospital, and I figured she might be able to convince you.”
believe,” Draco said. He paused, then said, “I could make a literal hat that says ‘Healer hat’ just to clarify, if you’d like. I’ll wear it every time I say something not-mean.”
Harry forced himself to face his friends. He wondered if they would look down on him or hate him or feel like they didn't even know him. Hermione's eyes were wide and her brows were furrowed, her mind probably working a kilometer a minute. Ron, however, simply looked stunned. His mouth was working, but nothing came out of it.
“I hate it, Hermione thinks-“ Potter stopped himself abruptly. Draco looked over. His hair was mussed – he must have been running his hand through it. “Anyway, er, sorry. Pissed.”
But the truth was that there were only so many times Harry could express how lost and angry and paranoid he was before his friends got sick of it. There were only so many things they could say to comfort him before he turned to other "solutions." God, what was wrong with him?
He watched impatiently as Harry pulled off his gloves, throwing them on top of the now closed trunk. As soon as Harry was close enough, Draco reached out and ran his hands through the hair Draco was so (begrudgingly) fond of. Harry’s mouth curved into a smile as he let his school cloak fall to the floor and kicked off his shoes.
Something about the nervous way Potter said it, accompanied by those wide green eyes made Draco’s heart skip a beat.
He couldn’t stop thinking about the conversations with Potter. The way he was talking to Draco was puzzling and strange, and Draco didn’t know how to feel about it. What was Potter playing at? Why did he keep talking to Draco, voluntarily choosing to spend time with him when before, Potter wouldn’t give him the time of day (rightfully so)?
“Er, sorry,” Harry said meekly. So it was true. Malfoy’s gay. “I mean – er, if it helps – I like blokes too. And birds. And everyone.”
“What? It’s a compliment. You could’ve become a songwriter, really,” Harry went on, a smile on his face. “You had so much talent at age fifteen.”
But now Harry had Draco. Beautiful, clever, funny Draco, who he had more in common with than he’d ever expected, who he always felt comfortable around, who he could be
“Me too,” said Draco. “I mean, if you’ll stay, I will too. I’d – I miss my mother, but I don’t think I’m ready to go back there yet.”
If Malfoy was going to say something then, Harry wouldn’t know; a young female server approached them with a smile plastered on her face.
. If Harry was planning on keeping this up all throughout dinner, he didn’t know if he could survive. It’d been ages since he’d been shagged – the last time having been Leo – and he was already feeling antsy.
And then Ginny flushed. Harry watched his money, his habit, his livelihood swirl away and disappear from sight.
Leonel looked exceptionally handsome today. Draco hadn’t seen him all day and would rather have not seen him at all, considering the state Draco was in – both physically and mentally.
“It’s your fault,” Draco said. Harry smiled broader. Draco tried again, pointedly not looking at Harry, “I just didn’t want to say no. That’d be rude, considering you’re the host and all.”
“Horrible,” Harry said, his voice hardening. “They’re what Voldemort used to stay alive. He’d take objects and put pieces of his soul in them so he couldn’t really die.”
There was a sound of a door opening, and Harry glanced over a moment, bored. He quickly did a double-take, however, because he could hardly believe what he was seeing.
Draco wasn’t exactly in a rush to go off shouting about it from the rooftops, either. He still had shame, hot and pervasive, dripping over him, courtesy of his father.
Draco made to deny it, but Harry captured Draco’s lips with his own. Harry kissed him enthusiastically, a low hum coming from him as his hands ran across Draco’s chest once more. Harry pulled away and looked down. Draco followed his gaze. His fingers were close to one of the Sectumsempra scars.
Confrontation really didn’t work well with Draco. It just made him irritable (or rather, more irritable than usual) and uncomfortable. His heart thudded as he gathered the nerve to speak.
” Malfoy cut across him sternly, his face twitching momentarily from its usual expressionlessness, “You do. The first step is acceptance, Potter, and you’ll soon complete it.”
“Alright,” Harry said once the Weasleys had Flooed away (they’d generously brought their own and left some with Harry and Draco – “it’s a housewarming gift”), “They’re gone.”
“All the time,” Potter said, his voice low. He seemed lost in thought, his eyes distant. “I’m just – they’re still not stopping. How long are they supposed to last?”
already – there was no need for divination. But did he actually like Leonel enough to start a relationship again? Or would they just shag and go back to normal? Was he using Leonel to forget about Potter? Because Draco
Only Blaise sat next to him now. Pansy, too, had returned to Hogwarts, but she didn’t make it into Potions after the OWLs. Blaise was seated next to Draco, gazing at nothing in particular with a bored expression on his handsome face. Draco figured bored was better than anxious, which is what Draco was. Extremely anxious.
He had his answer already. He’d been imagining leaving this damned place for the past two weeks, and he’d known for a while that he only wanted Ginny with him when he left. Less chance of attracting attention that way, and less people fretting over him.
Draco chanced a look at Potter. He really did look handsome, even though his hair was a mess (as usual) and his tie was done sloppily. He was at ease, turned slightly towards Draco in his chair. Draco realized that his own body language was in sharp contrast with Potter’s; he was sitting rigidly in his chair and facing the desk. With great effort, he marginally lowered his tense shoulders.
“Vegetables, Harry!” she said, throwing up her arms. “That’s all I asked for! You were out for a full hour and couldn’t remember the one thing I’d asked you to get?”
Ginny cried out in frustration, bringing her hands up to her face, wand still clenched in one of them, and pulled back from Harry.
“I’m kidding, Malfoy,” Weasley said. He turned serious; it was off-putting. “Harry’s right - we’re not kids anymore.”
They situated themselves on the new couch; Draco poured their wine as Leonel flicked through the channels. He settled on some type of true crime show.
"That's fine, Draco,” Potter said, his voice becoming softer. He looked down at the parchment and asked tentatively, “Are you sure you trust me with this?"
“That may be true,” she said slowly, “But he was still so awful to us – all of us – even before he became a Death Eater.”
Maybe it was Ginny, maybe it was her bullshit words, maybe it was her yelling, or maybe it was his pounding headache. And it could have been a dozen other things but that didn’t really matter right now because he felt himself fall apart.
Harry was still fatigued most of the time, sometimes feeling as though he might pass out any second. The worst was when he’d get shooting pains throughout his body – starting from the back of his head and running down his neck and spine. What had started as simple headaches evolved into these debilitating pains that sometimes didn’t allow him to do anything but lie on his back and wait for them to end. He’d asked Malfoy about it yesterday morning, and he told Harry that they were called waves, which was an incredibly misleading name in Harry’s opinion.
On the other hand, his mother was there. He knew she was lonely with only the house elves for company, and he hated that he couldn’t be there for her. She had asked if he knew what he was doing for break in her most recent letter. He hadn’t replied yet.
He sometimes wondered what Draco was thinking about so intensely. It was hard to tell, but Harry had to assume it was about him. Sometimes Harry just wanted to grab Draco by the shoulders and shake him, perhaps yell that he was certain about wanting to start a relationship with him and to stop bloody worrying for once. But, alas, he didn’t know how Draco would react to that and he wasn’t too keen on finding out.
Draco woke up with a pounding headache. He opened his eyes and was momentarily disarmed. This wasn’t his bed. Where was he?
Harry looked around him for any sort of communication device, thinking about how much easier this would all be if he just had his wand. Finally, he found a small, glowing button on one end of the headboard. Somehow, Harry felt that this was the one, and he pressed it.
Maybe he just wanted to be reckless. Maybe he wanted to feel something other than panic and anger or
need to get to work,” he said as he scrambled to stand and put on his coat. Potter’s brows were furrowed as he watched Draco pull it on. “I didn’t realize how much time had passed. But I…” He hesitated for just a second. “But I’d like to do this again. If you would.”
Harry stuffed the piece of paper in the pocket of his hoodie and wiped his hands on his jeans. He then took hold of the doorknob and turned.
“Right,” Draco said. He cleared his throat. If he didn’t say it now, he feared he never would. “Still, I’d like to apologize to you both for the way I treated you. There’s no excusing the things I said and did, and I feel terrible about it. I hope you can find some way to forgive me someday, but if not, I understand completely.”
“You don’t believe in the meaning,” Harry said, and he placed his hand on Draco’s arm once more. Draco winced but didn’t shake him off. “I don’t think you ever really did. I’m not defending Voldemort, Draco, I’m defending you. It
“Oho! I see you and Mr. Malfoy continue to make quite a team!” Professor Slughorn beamed as he peered into their cauldron. “Very well done!”
He didn’t have a chance to say anything else before both men heard someone call Draco’s name and the door creak open.
This was apparently not what Ira had expected, because the smirk on their face fell. They took their long legs off the desk and looked at Draco curiously.
“I’ll see you later,” Harry said, already standing and making his way to Johnny’s front door. “Have a good night, Johnny.”
“I do,” Harry said, and chewed his lip. “It’s just – I’m sure you get tired of me being pathetic and all that – I do, at least. And you two are doing so well, I don’t want to…bring you down, or anything.”
Harry’s hands roamed – from Malfoy’s cheeks to his hair to his back. Wanting more, Harry pushed him up against the wall, firmly placing his knee between Malfoy’s legs to keep him there. Kissing Malfoy was like something Harry’d never felt before – intoxicating, drawing Harry in and holding him tight. He finally understood the allure of snogging, Malfoy’s scent and feel enveloping him.
Walking into the room was a man Harry hadn’t seen since he was eighteen years old. He didn’t look much different; he had the same pointy features, pale skin, and white-blond hair. But his hair
He'd apparently left his cell phone back at his flat, which was fine. As soon as he got back home, he could text one of his plugs and pick it up or even just walk to the supermarket and buy a drink and –
It was three years later when he truly understood what his parents had been speaking about. It was the day he realized what he’d been thinking when he looked at other boys and just how wrong it was. He felt dirty and shameful, like he’d let his parents down again.
Pansy’s face flushed slightly. “Regardless of my feelings toward Potter, you’re my best friend, Draco. You can tell me anything, even if you think I won’t like it.”
“I know,” he said excitedly, eyes bright behind his glasses. “We can all go see the match together next week. Hufflepuff versus Ravenclaw. What do you think?”
He felt a bit surprised that he could say all that without stumbling over the words and took another drink to celebrate.
“Don’t call me that, you bint,” Daphne growled, but Astoria had already gone ahead and snuck her arm through Draco’s own.
“You can’t just ask things like that and then drop it! If you don’t like the fact that I’m gay, then just say it,” Draco demanded, feeling his face go hot.
Harry was on his knees in front of him. He lifted a hand and murmured a Summoning spell; the small bottle of lube came flying from one of the boxes in the room, and Harry caught it easily. Draco watched as Harry began slicking the lube across his fingers and his cock, his entire body thrumming with want. Finally, Harry met Draco’s eyes.
Draco was trembling by the time he reached Potter's dormitory, letter in his hand. They haven’t spoken since their fight in Draco’s dorm two days ago; Potter had barely looked at him since then.
Harry’s hand moved up to caress Draco’s face gently. Draco closed his eyes at the touch, and a second later, Harry’s warm lips were on his own. Draco kissed back though his chest was heavy and he couldn’t get the image of Harry’s dejected face out of his head.
For a while he’d taken to visiting Muggle bars and clubs. He’d get drunk enough to forget how much he didn’t want to be alive, and he might have pick someone up along the way. He was irresponsible, he knew, and he was an inconsiderate git. He’d hardly remember having sex with whoever it was, but he’d always leave before they woke up.
The next afternoon found Draco in the library with Pansy, doing Arithmancy homework. Books were laid across the five-person table they occupied; parchment, quills, and inkwells surrounded them as well. Pansy was resting her head on her propped-up hand, flipping lazily through a textbook with her free one. Draco was scanning through old notes, trying to find a solution to their problem. Pansy sighed.
“Years,” confirmed Harry gravely. “My memory’s still hazy for the past…well, a long time, and I honestly can’t remember the last time. Don’t kill me, but when did we break things off?”
When they’d left an hour later, Draco had finished a bowl of soup and had even poked a bit at some steamed vegetables and chicken. When he’d first taken a bite of the chicken, Potter looked at Draco like he’d hung the moon, which was frankly quite ridiculous since
Harry could see the pain in Hermione’s and Ron’s eyes, but he pushed forward, needing to get it all out. If he didn’t do it now, he feared he never would.
“Exactly,” Draco said, happy to have been proven right. But then, “I forbid you from telling them about any of my – my
“They’re Aurors, actually,” Leo answered. He nodded towards Betty. “That’s why we think someone intentionally poisoned him with an intent to harm, or worse.”
“That’s ridiculous. And why are you even talking about it now? We’ve been split for ages.” Draco crossed his arms, feeling supremely uncomfortable. For a horrible moment, he thought that Ira and Betty had somehow found out about what happened yesterday – that confusing moment.
Draco didn’t know what he’d done. Potter was obviously acting more coldly toward him, but Draco didn’t know why. Even when Potter was doing poorly, he’d still talk to him. Perhaps a bit more shortly, but he still spoke.
. He’d since stopped this habit, too, but only after Ron had a serious talk with him. He was careful to only drink socially instead of drinking to forget how much he wanted to die.
Blaise was out for the day, undoubtedly with the youngest Weasley, so he invited Harry over. They’d been able to spend a longer time together than usual the day before in the History of Magic room, and Draco hoped they could break their record today, especially since it was a Saturday.
“Thanks.” Harry shot him a grin and came inside, his gaze wandering around the flat before finally landing on Draco. He looked Draco up and down and smiled, “Hope I didn’t wake you up?”
He felt himself getting closer and closer to the edge, felt it deep in his body and Draco opened his eyes, wanting to look at Harry and oh fuck, he was beautiful, so beautiful, sucking and licking Draco-
Potter was gazing at him with such intensity it made Draco flush. What was this prat playing at? Why did he even care what Draco did?”
Harry took a deep breath and watched Ron and Hermione's faces, waiting for them to say something. Ron's face was pale and he looked uncomfortable; Hermione was pursing her lips and studying Harry right back.
They were both breathing hard with their eyes trained on each other. Potter seemed to be considering something, deciding if he should say whatever he wanted to.
By then, Harry was desperate and pleading. "Please please just put it inside me, I need you now, Draco, god -"
“Good work, Potter,” Draco said clearly, nodding approvingly. He then addressed Leonel. “Now we just need to make sure it works. He should feel it in his system soon, perhaps a minute or two.”
Draco had a few bites in between pushing food back and forth on his plate. He could feel Harry’s eyes on him every so often, but he didn’t say anything, thank Salazar. He honestly didn’t know if Harry was biting his tongue on Draco barely eating or his…revelation, but he was thankful nevertheless.
Draco reached across the table for Harry's hand, and Harry let him take it. Draco curled his fingers around it, and Harry felt as if Draco's serenity was spreading through Harry's body. He took a deep breath and gazed evenly into Draco’s eyes.
Harry beamed at him, taking his hand once more underneath the table. Hermione made a little sobbing noise while Ron said smilingly, “Thanks, Malfoy.”
Draco let out a shaky breath as he read over the letter for the third time. He then hurried back to the bathroom so he could make sure he looked decent.
Draco searched the area for his wand, which he had taken out of his pocket, along with his pack of smokes, at some point last night. He found it tucked underneath a pillow and cast a
“Please, Draco,” Harry pleaded, coming closer to him. “I’m fucking stupid. Forget what I said earlier. Please don’t...”
Draco heard Weasley tell his girlfriend that there was still time left for Harry to change his mind as he passed them and hurried to catch up with Harry.
The corners of Malfoy’s mouth turned up. “That’s very kind of you, Potter, but I assure you that I’m perfectly content with water.”
Harry approached Draco and tugged on his shirt insistently. His lips ghosted against Draco’s neck; Draco shivered.
“But really, our success is all due to you,” grinned George. He lifted his own pint and took a swig.
Draco cast the spell, and relief washed over Harry’s features as he examined himself once more. Harry looked up, his mouth open to speak, when his eyes landed on Draco’s wand.
Draco looked at Harry, who was chewing his bottom lip just a touch too aggressively. But he was quiet and thinking over Draco’s words instead of immediately refuting them, which was progress.
Draco nodded. “You really can talk to me anytime. And I…honestly felt guilty that we’ve spent so much time – that
"I don't...not since the last time Hermione and Ron tried to get me to stop. I only made it a few days..."
After breakfast, Draco went to drop off his mother’s wand in his dormitory and take a shower (much to the relief of Pansy). The hot water and clean clothes were, truthfully, a soothing relief after all the activity from the previous night.
“Yes, I can understand that,” Draco nodded. “I will come collect you five minutes to ten on Monday morning.”
Harry reveled in the fact that this was truly happening, that his life had really taken this big of a turn. It simultaneously felt like his first meeting at group had been a day ago and a lifetime ago; he never could have imagined that
And to think, Draco had kept his own sexuality a secret – a heavy, dark knot in the pit of his stomach for five years. Meanwhile Harry seemed to have figured himself out in twenty-four hours.
Harry’s eyebrows drew together, and then he froze momentarily before a sly smile began to grow on his face. Draco froze too, because he knew exactly what that expression meant.
“Yeah,” Weasley added, recovering from his shock. “I doubt we’ll ever be best mates, Malfoy, but I appreciate it. And if Harry likes you, I guess you can’t be all that bad.”
His empty stomach churning, he wiped his mouth and hung at the edge of his bed, unwilling to show his face to any of the five people in the room. His weak gasps of breath came ragged and irregular and his chest moved with them, his hands gripping the edge of the hospital bed as he stared into his vomit.
“Don’t,” Harry said quickly. He hadn’t expected this, and he didn’t know why he was trying to tell Malfoy that he wasn’t a complete prat when that’s exactly what he was. “Like I said, hardly anyone knew, and you couldn’t have known.”
“Sorry to disappoint,” Harry responded, dropping his watch back on the bedside table and rolling to lie face-to-face with Draco.
Draco gave a ragged gasp as he drew out and back in again, his hands gripping Harry tighter than ever.
“No, you were right. I know he’s changed,” Harry said truthfully. “But then I think about everything he’s said and done and I just – it’s a bit confusing going from thinking you know someone to realizing you don’t know them at all, and you haven’t for years.”
It looked like Estrada suddenly realized who he was talking to again, someone who really didn’t need examples of major events during the War, for he trailed off and went silent. Harry was equal parts appreciative and annoyed. He wasn’t
He made his way there, trying his best to avoid stony gazes and rigid shoulders. Draco clumsily opened the door to the balcony and stepped outside. He shivered as he looked down, white fingers gripping the railing tight. Seven floors up. He wondered how long it would take to meet the ground from here.
They made their way to Potter’s room. Draco lightly knocked on the door before opening the door and peering in. Potter looked about the same as he did yesterday, though perhaps he had some more color in his face. Draco let Ira in.
Draco hesitantly ran a hand up Harry's arm; it felt good under the layer of cloth that covered it. He gripped onto his bicep, fingers curling into the muscle there. Harry nudged open Draco’s mouth with his own and slipped his tongue inside. A thrill ran through Draco’s body. No, he definitely couldn’t get tired of this.
Draco didn’t know what to say. The arguing? The fact that he’s Draco Malfoy? The fact that it was Harry Potter who was kissing him, someone who didn’t even like blokes (to Draco’s knowledge, anyway. Or did he actually? Or was this just an experiment?).
“And this,” said Malfoy, pulling out yet another piece of parchment and handing it to Harry, “Is a list of resources for you. You can contact Healer Wolff or myself at any time, day or night. The addresses I included there are our work addresses, but if need be, an owl will be able to locate us at our homes. I’ve also included some other reputable Mind Healers if things don’t work out with Healer Wolff.”
Harry Apparated them a short walk away from the Burrow. Draco walked rigidly, looking this way and that as they made their way to the door.
Draco had to fight not to roll his eyes. He really couldn’t care less how Blaise’s mother reacted to him dating the youngest Weasley. What business was it of his, anyways? Astoria kicked his foot.
“Yes.” Granger sighed. “I wish I had the exact details down…how I didn’t think to remember everything before…”
They were walking back to the castle after the game. Granger and Weasley were with a larger group further back, leaving the two to talk privately. Every time their elbows bumped, a small thrill went through Draco. If it wasn’t obvious before, Draco had it bad.
“C’mon,” he mumbled, taking Draco’s hand and leading him over to one of the beds. “Go ahead, I just need to put this away.”
Draco flinched and said lowly, “I thought they deserved to die. At first. I wasn’t clever enough to think for myself, to say,
Harry took it from him and drank it down in one swallow. If this was the closest he could get to what he really needed – no,
“On your back,” Harry told him, and Draco obeyed, switching spots with Harry and drawing his legs up.
Well, he never really had much time to be a regular person, did he? Harry’s thoughts turned bitter, and it must have showed on his face, for Wolff frowned.
“I’m staying as well,” Draco answered, thankful for Potter for picking up the conversation again, and then immediately felt uneasy again because he didn’t exactly feel like discussing
“I’m fine,” he lied and he reached for the whisky again. This time, Harry didn’t stop him, and he took several large gulps. He put the bottle down, gasping for breath and savoring the burn down his throat.
Draco couldn’t help but stare. He couldn’t believe someone so wholesome and good could exist in this shit world. Potter cocked his head, but Draco didn’t stop. He wanted so badly to take that beautiful face in his hands and kiss Potter right then and there, but then he would most certainly get punched.
He wrapped his lips around Harry’s cock, slowly fitting more and more of it inside his mouth. He heard Harry gasp in surprise, and out of the corner of his eye, his hands grip the sheets.
He cocked his head as he studied Potter’s face. What kind of distraction did he need? Salazar knew he looked tired, though tired wasn’t even the right word for it. His exhaustion seemed to be bone-deep, permeating his entire being.
“I love you too, you big sap,” Draco said, inching closer to wrap his arms around Harry’s slick body. He rested his head on Harry’s chest and closed his eyes once more.
“You then quit training mid-2000, and began taking additional potions around 2001. This then takes us to spring of 2004 – last year – when alcohol also became a prominent part of your life. Is that also correct?”
“I’m sorry for – today, for being so-” Draco couldn’t even find a word to fit his ever-changing moods, his temper, his aggression. He didn’t even know if he was making sense, he was so exhausted.
Draco didn’t know what to say. What could one possibly say to something like this? He thought about this cousin of Harry’s, this aunt and uncle. He felt anger rise within him; how could they be so cruel to a child, to Harry? He wanted to find them, hunt them down, make them pay for what he did. His grip on Harry’s hand tightened.
“Come on. Group hug,” Hermione said, and when the boys didn’t move, she said again sternly, “Group hug.”
Draco stood, yawning as he did so, and pulled his Healer’s robes on over his white Muggle button-up and black trousers. He walked stiffly out of his office and made his way to the employee lounge on the eastern side of the floor.
the Blacks didn’t keep a VCR in their sitting room,” he said, nodding his head towards the dusty VCR that indeed sat underneath an outdated television.
Draco fell silent. Was Potter mad? Upset? Irritated, most likely, if the look on his face told Draco anything.
tear up. He focused on his cappuccino and sandwich instead of on Ira, and suddenly realized that he wasn’t hungry anymore.
“I saw her…after the War. And she helped me,” Draco rambled. “I’m functioning now. Perhaps I’m still not a ‘normal’ person, but I can do normal things. As you can obviously tell. But I think…if you go to every appointment and listen to her and take her advice, she can really help you.”
“I had a talk with her,” Draco said gently. “She admits she was wrong. You were right – she was just worried about me.”
“Stop,” Harry said, finally speaking. “I don’t - I don’t tell people, and this is why. I’m not the same kid in the cupboard. I have people who love me now, and I just have to remember that I’m not in that situation anymore.”
He walked away and began putting the books back in their rightful places. It took him quite a while; he couldn’t figure out which section one certain book belonged to. He ended up having to ask Madam Pince about it, who was unsurprisingly displeased. Draco waited patiently as she examined the inside covers and muttered under her breath about how irresponsible students shouldn’t be taking books if they couldn’t even put them back correctly.
Draco inhaled shakily. “Maybe. But right now, I really need to be alone, and I need you to respect that.”
“Secondly, Harry,” Hermione said clearly, her voice high, “Since when have you and Malfoy been, um, boyfriends?”
She continued to guide them until they had taken a total of four breaths. Harry opened his eyes prematurely. Malfoy sat there, eyes closed and back straight as he breathed. Harry didn’t think he had ever seen Malfoy look so peaceful.
Draco spent the next half hour researching poisons in his book collection before going to Ira’s to ask about it.
He looked at his reflection; his eyes were bloodshot but at least his nose wasn’t bleeding this time.
for a stomach; if he didn’t, it would be concave, only emphasizing  his bony ribs. Thin, raised lines marred his chest, a  souvenir  of his fight with Harry. And worst of all, the Dark Mark on his left forearm. It was faded to a light red , sure, but it still stood out against his pale skin, seeming to scream,
Should he? Harry hadn't even begun to wrap his head around it himself, and he wasn't sure if he could manage to talk about it without making something explode.
Harry looked away, afraid he was going to start crying. Hermione must have sensed this, because she gripped his arm tighter.
And then he caught Leo and Betty staring at the two of them. With a panic, Draco turned to Ira and asked, “How loudly was I speaking just then?”
“You seemed to think I was repulsed by your, um…” Draco trailed off. He didn’t want to say ‘crush,’ he
“I’ll adapt quickly,” Pansy said, her eyes narrowed. She looked at them for another moment, then said, “Merlin, the way you two look at each other. Get a room, honestly.”
Harry pulled on the hospital gown again with a scowl, feeling ridiculous. Madam Pomphrey never made him wear such foolish clothing, and he hadn’t made a trip to St. Mungo’s since his Auror days.
Sticking two fingers in his mouth, he disturbed the uvula until he threw up the contents of his stomach. He did the same thing a few more times until only saliva and acid came up. Satisfied, he stood back up, spat into the toilet, and wiped his hands with some toilet paper.
“Well,” Leonel said, his voice soft. “You can go home, if you want. I’ll cover for you, and Selina has morning shift too. You don’t have anything scheduled that we can’t do, right?”
Draco stopped dead in his tracks, a resolute crunch of the ice only exaggerating his point. Harry was looking at him hopefully.
“Fix it?” Harry repeated incredulously. “No, Draco, this is good! It’s good that you’re eating; you don’t need to fix anything!”
“Really, Potter, it’s flattering that you pay that much attention to me,” he said, rolling his eyes at Potter before starting up the stairs again.
Draco’s breath caught in his throat. A year ago, he would have pulled Leonel into his office where they’d have sex, rough and quick. But now, he didn’t know what to do.
Harry gritted his teeth at the mention of Estrada. He'd like the bloke fine before he learned that he'd shagged Malfoy. And it was true - what was he compared to Estrada? Malfoy probably thought Harry pathetic and decidedly unattractive.
“Takes one to know one, apparently. Oh – but don’t worry, Potter, I can confirm that you’re essentially the same person you were at fifteen – angry, incoherent, pigheaded,” Malfoy listed, counting them off on his thin fingers. There was a mean sneer on his face. “Congratulations on not having grown at all these past few years.”
“Are you sure it isn’t because you love to overshare?” Draco asked quietly, his eyes avoiding Harry’s.
He glanced at Malfoy, trying to be discreet. He was sitting there, eyes on Kathy, and Harry resisted the urge to go over there and start interrogating him. It wasn’t his business, Harry tried to reason with himself. Malfoy could do whatever the hell he liked, and it didn’t concern him at all.
“You’re right,” Harry said, sitting up with a smile. He looked down at himself, partially covered by blankets. “I need clothes.”
“Yeah. Anyway, this is the bedroom, as you can see,” Harry said, gesturing around him. “Don’t mind the mess.”
Draco sighed. The anxiety that had been wrapping his chest and stomach in knots loosened its hold, and Draco felt like he could breathe a bit easier.
“No,” Draco managed to say. He cleared his throat. “I’m glad you did. I just wasn’t expecting it, what with....”
sleeping better now – being able to fall asleep relatively quickly and be uninterrupted until he woke – but it was still very early for him. His sleep schedule was all sorts of fucked before, and for good reason too. He just wondered when the real nightmares would come back.
“Muggles are wonderful, aren’t they?” she said admiringly. Luna picked up a package of vegan sausage from the meat counter, showing it to Harry. He nodded, and she put it back. “They can make anything vegan. I wish more magic folk cared about the welfare of creatures.”
it’ll never happen, but it wouldn’t be…right to be with you and not be fully devoted to you. But I also truly believe that we’re better as friends. And colleagues, of course.”
“I don’t have the energy for it, Malfoy. I really don’t,” Potter said when Draco gave him a doubtful look.
He wanted to stand up and walk away, but he still felt a bit too wobbly to do so. Potter already knew this and studied him, looking him up and down. Draco flushed just a bit at the intensity of his gaze.
The words stung even if Draco knew what he meant. It must’ve shown on his face, because Potter quickly added, “You look ill. Worse than you did in sixth year.”
“Of course I do,” Harry sighed. “He wrote me a letter on Christmas Eve and I responded, of course, but it’s still not the same as it used to be. He feels so far away now. He doesn’t even know we’re dating,” he added almost as an afterthought.
Once Harry had shut the door closed behind him, he walked over to a more secluded area, already withdrawing the little bag out of his pocket. Once he was satisfied he wouldn’t be seen, he opened the bag up. His hands shook as he took out two of the little pills.
In fact, it almost seemed like Pansy was drawing away from him. She still forced Draco into the Great Hall whenever she could, having him sit down next to her and put
Potter sputtered a bit more before saying, “Look, never mind. We’ve gotten way off-track. And I don’t want to do that anymore.” At Draco’s questioning look, Harry sighed and said, “I don’t want to get Ginny and myself drunk just so I can talk to her about all that. It’s – it’s pathetic.”
“I’m not really sure,” Harry said, his voice slightly muffled. “I mean, I was obsessed with you during sixth year, and I think your, er, appearance might’ve been part of that. But there’d been people before you…but I think what really did it was seeing Charlie during the summer. I’d met him before, but then…revisiting that feeling of
He steeled himself outside of Potter’s door. He was still unsure of how to act around him; Potter was like a stranger to him now. He’d always sort of been one, but he was much easier to read when he was a teenager. Now that he was coming off potions and alcohol, the withdrawals were making him irritable, unstable, and moody. Most cases that came through Draco’s department were fairly straightforward, but addiction was a completely different matter.
Draco didn’t remember the last time he had allowed himself to cry so openly – it must’ve been ages ago considering just how strongly he was currently weeping. He screwed his eyes shut and burrowed his face in Potter’s shoulder, too overcome by sadness to think too carefully about what he was doing.
Draco gave. Draco responded readily, his hand still on Harry's cheek as he melted into the kiss, persuading Harry's mouth open. Harry was sure Draco could feel his erection through his pants but found that he couldn't care less.
He was reaching breaking point, Draco knew. He opened his eyes and looked up at Harry – so fit, gorgeous beyond imagination, and all his, just Draco’s –
“Officially, today, I reckon,” Harry answered, frowning over at Draco. He nodded in agreement. “But we’ve been er, involved for a little longer.”
“Well,” Draco said hesitantly, “I suppose that after everything, an actual conversation is long overdue.”
They continued talking and teasing each other throughout breakfast. At one point, Draco realized with a jolt that this was almost normal. In fact, it might have been completely normal. They hadn’t managed to speak like this for an extended period of time since the beginning of sixth year, before everything went to hell.
with a lazy flick of his wand; there was still plenty of time before breakfast. He took another drag, and thought about how much he was dreading the upcoming day (the usual amount). His thoughts were interrupted by the sound of footsteps that were much too close for his liking.
that he hadn’t gotten around to binning yet; if he remembered correctly, there was a mention of Potter in it…
want? Are you wholly prepared for a new relationship? Because that’s what you’ll be getting if you continue heading down this road. I’m not really one for a quick fuck.”
“Right,” he said. And then he realized his problem. Apparently talking about trauma made Harry lose his erection. He said shamefully, “But I, er, kind of lost it.”
“Oh, I’ve waited so long for this,” Harry breathed, eyes fluttering closed as he leaned his head back against the pillow.
“I dropped whatever it was Pansy said to you in the library,” Draco reasoned, “Even though I’m still curious. So now I’m asking you to leave this.”
Draco knelt down on his knees, slowly kissing a path down Harry’s stomach and pulling his sweatpants down gently. He tasted slightly of sweat – an aftereffect of them having recently moved all of their furniture into their flat. Draco had his hands on Harry’s pants, about to pull them down to –
“I’ve been doing some more research,” she told him. “The more I know about you, the better I can treat you.”
In terms of low points in his life, Harry thought he had to rate that one in the top five. Harry still remembered with a gut-wrenching clarity the way Malfoy had looked at him after his outburst. The shock on his face said it all, and as if it couldn’t get worse, Malfoy had dismissed his feelings entirely. He could only imagine what Malfoy was thinking. Was he repulsed? Or did he find it hilarious?
the one who told me that we can’t start a relationship or whatever, but here he is, sending me these
Draco was nearly always amused by the contrast between the two of them – Betty with her soft voice and posh English accent, and Leo with his warm, open voice and unabashedly American accent. How Leonel seemed to grow bolder in Draco’s presence, and Betty more timid. Their only real similarities were their ink black hair and the passion they had for their work.
,” Draco hissed. He slunk back down and laid in bed next to Harry. “Fuck you, Potter, for making me go through that.”
Harry was taken aback by her immediacy and bluntness. He hadn't even finished what he was saying, but Ginny had already crossed her arms.
don’t tell anyone, because it’s supposed to be kept under wraps. The last thing we need here is a team of
. I was too busy trying not to get killed by Voldemort for a good part of my life, and then…well really, I reckon I just like drugs.”
When Harry got home that evening, he sat on the couch in the living room for a bit just to think. Kreacher asked if he could get Harry anything, anything at all, but Harry declined. He had to review what had happened. He needed to remember every detail. He just had to think.
The cleansing was over and done with in fifteen minutes, and the two Healers took their leave shortly after they’d finished. Once the door was shut, Harry went to pick up the business card Malfoy had given him the day before. Luckily, Malfoy hadn’t seen it on the ground, or if he had, he didn’t comment on it.
Draco flushed when he realized Potter had caught him staring; he looked away quickly and tried to think of the last thing Astoria had said. When his fuzzy brain couldn’t manage it, he came up with the next best thing.
It seemed to be the same with many others as well. Draco, for one, and many members of group were also doing well – Sam, Cait, Damien. And unsurprisingly, Hermione and Ron were also doing wonderfully, what with being recently engaged and all.
Harry simply gasped in response. Draco’s fingers dug into Harry, and he thrusted harder, finally getting what his body had yearned for.
“Oh. Well, I’ve been sort of struggling to deal with things,” Harry said, panicking a little. Once again, it occurred to him just how hard it would be to explain his problems to Muggles. He continued, deciding to leave things ambiguous. “Things that happened in the past. I still get nightmares and I’ve got some – er, anger issues. Control issues. For a while I just tried to ignore it, self-medicating, I guess, but I’m not doing that anymore. So now I’m here to, er, help myself. The right way.”
“I’ve never told anyone that, you know. Ron and Hermione know bits and pieces of it, but they don’t know…that part.”
“That was pretty tame, honestly. It actually got physical a few times,” Harry said, wincing as he remembered their disastrous fight in sixth year. “More than a few times, actually.”
“Well, that’s fine too, then! So we won’t take it as slowly as we ‘should’ – so what? We’ve done everything else correctly, we waited a year, you’re not my Healer anymore, I’m in a good place, a really good place now, and I
Harry listened, enraptured, able to tell just from Malfoy’s voice how much he cared about his work. Harry felt a twang of jealousy at that, wondering what it felt like to be that passionate about something. He watched as Malfoy’s expressions changed as he spoke of the different cases he’d had over the past week.
He handed the empty bottle back to Estrada, who took it from him, closed it, and put it in his pocket. Harry regarded him for a moment, and then said, "Harry's fine."
“I reckon there’s more to let out,” he laughed weakly. He ran a hand through his greasy hair and said, “Fuck...how did this even happen?"
“Just one of them?” Draco asked, flabbergasted. “Is this how you got away with breaking so many rules the past six years? Maybe you’re not as saint-like as I had thought.”
Harry snapped out of it. Why was he thinking so much on it? It didn’t concern him. Course, he always did have a habit of sticking his nose where it didn’t belong.
“I think we all know what I’m doing,” Harry said, his voice tight. “So just – get whatever you came here for and
“Cos he is,” Harry cut in. “Just cos he doesn’t deserve to be in Azkaban doesn’t mean he’s not a wanker anymore.”
“But.” Potter’s shoulders drooped. He uncrossed his arms. “I – we saved each other – we helped each other. Doesn’t that mean anything?”
He wanted to run. That was Draco’s first instinct. Run like a bloody coward – Potter was right about that – in that moment, that’s all Draco wanted to do. It was almost like Potter had sensed it, for he took this moment to turn back round. He crossed his arms tightly and looked at Draco, a bitter smile on his face.
“I’m sorry for losing my temper like that. I shouldn’t have said those things to you. And I know he deserves to be in there, but he’s still my father,” Draco said, forcing calm into his shaky voice. Both Granger and Weasley looked surprised. He turned to Harry. ”If you’d like me to be here, I’ll stay.”
He never would’ve dreamed Draco to be so wonderfully vocal during sex – it made Harry’s heart flutter with a strange affection.
Potter may as well have punched him in the stomach or slapped him in the face. The shock of what he’d said was visceral. Draco wasn’t trying to kill himself; it wasn’t true, it was just…
Draco woke up hugely disoriented the next morning. He vaguely remembered doing paperwork, going to lounge,
“Vanilla’s great.” Draco took the one Harry had pointed to first and took a deep drink. “That’s perfect. Thanks.”
“I just needed a break,” Potter said, though he didn’t sound too sure of it himself. “I love them and all, but…it’s a lot. It’s all – everything’s a lot.”
is ruthless, even towards their so-called Savior. And really, you didn’t miss much. Just a few articles insinuating I’d
But it wasn’t Draco’s fault. Potter was handsome in an unconventional way with his untamable hair and the curve of his nose and his unusually bright green eyes and the way they contrasted with his dark skin. He was simply mesmerizing. Draco had been mesmerized ever since he’d met the prat and he doubted that it would ever stop. Draco was certain he could still recall all the quirks and habits of Potter’s that he’d picked up on during Hogwarts. Even now, Draco was committing the sight of a sleepy Harry Potter in a loose shirt and sweatpants to memory.
No, that was mental. He knew that. How would he even get home? He wasn’t even sure how he’d gotten to St. Mungo’s in the first place. He had no memory of that night, and it wasn’t uncommon. Blacking out was easy when you mixed benzos and alcohol, which Harry had learned for the first time over a year ago.
He was suddenly struck by the absurd thought of this perhaps being a normal, regular thing – Draco getting a drink for Harry in his kitchen, leaning against the counter and looking effortlessly gorgeous. Harry wanted to see this sight every day, he wanted it to be commonplace and simply a part of his life
Harry shook his head. “I tried to – er, I was in police training for a bit, but that didn’t work out.”
This is when he slowly slid his mouth off Harry’s cock, letting his tongue slide all the way up as he did so.
Sorry I'm slacking so much, lots of stuff going on, ha ha ha. Also - I'm obviously not a medical professional so sorry if I make any horrible mistakes.
It had to have been before Ron had given him a stern talk about Not Drinking to Relieve the Pain of Existence, because Harry was now very careful when drinking while in pleasant company. He didn’t want to end up completely sloshed and yelling about how he wanted to die in front of old classmates.
Kathy’s voice had adopted a calming tone; less enthusiastic and overly cheery, more gentle and soothing. Harry followed her instructions, wondering why he had to do such a thing.
He loosened his grip, surprised at himself. The cigarette was on the ground, nearly broken in half. Draco stared at it for a moment, then at Harry. He looked nervous, tentative, and almost ashamed.
“Please shut up,” Harry said loudly, causing the three of them to stop talking and look at him with varying degrees of indignation. “I deserved that, alright? Thanks for the concern, Draco, and Ron, I’m still annoyed at you. And I’m fine, Hermione, I just feel like a right idiot. Where’s Ginny?”
Harry resisted the urge to laugh. He felt anxious all the time, except perhaps when he was on calming potions.
It was true. Hermione was still upset about his escapades featuring illegal Muggle drugs and he had no doubt she would strong-arm him into staying. And he didn't want to disappoint her for the thousandth time.
“I fancy you, Draco Malfoy. Not just when I’m sloshed, but always. And, er, I’m hoping you’ll let me kiss you even though I have morning breath.”
“No, I can’t,” Harry said, suddenly sounding very tired. He looked up, finally meeting Draco’s eyes. Merlin, it hurt seeing Harry like this. So dejected – so beaten down. “I can’t forget any of it. It – it
Draco dropped the paper into the toilet and flushed, watching the partly digested food swirl out of sight.
They both stood up, and Wolff began escorting Harry to her fireplace when he stopped suddenly. He turned to face her, and she looked at him expectantly.
Harry enveloped Draco in a hug as soon as they stumbled out into the house, burying his face in Draco’s neck. He still couldn’t quite place his scent, but it was soothing.
“All right, Scarhead, what about you?” Draco returned, and Harry laughed – he well and truly felt like he was a teenager again.
“And of course, you were in Gryffindor,” Betty went on, apparently oblivious to or ignoring his visual inspection of her. “By the time I got to Hogwarts, you were in fifth year and Umbridge was in charge. I was so disappointed – I’d heard all these wonderful things about Headmaster Dumbledore and just to have him disappear…and then…”
,” Malfoy rolled his eyes. Harry wondered if he was this much of a dick to all of his patients. “Your vitals are still stable, and your body is nearly rid of all the foreign bodies. Of course, we’ll be administering a very weak Calming Potion to you tonight; it’ll ease your body and mind, and hopefully help you to sleep. You
“I shouldn’t have said that to you,” he said quickly. “I apologize for my inappropriate conduct. If there’s anything else I can do for you…?”
He opened his eyes and blinked at Malfoy, who was now sitting on the floor with him, looking strange and out-of-place in his lime green robes and in Harry’s flat. Malfoy was staring at him, grey eyes intense as they regarded Harry carefully.
“But it’s also…hard to believe I made it 22 years. I don’t really like reflecting on the past but birthdays sort of force you to, don’t they? So I’ve got to think about all my mistakes and doubts and failures and all that,
Harry wasn’t sure what he had expected, but Malfoy’s office surprised Harry all the same. The walls were a spotless white and a small window provided the same view Harry had in his room. A sleek desk sat in the middle of the room, a little less organized than Harry would have figured it would be. There were three chairs in the office, one of which was Malfoy’s, and two plainer ones for guests. A bare coat rack stood in the corner, and next to it was the fireplace. A fire was already going, making the office a touch too warm.
Group started then, and Harry chanced making eye contact with Draco. The slightest quirk of the lips betrayed Draco’s usual cool exterior. Harry could barely bite down a smile as he focused his attention on Kathy.
“Harry, Merlin, yes,” Draco breathed, hardly aware of what he was saying. All he knew was that he felt incredible, and it was because Harry Potter was sucking his cock like it was the only thing that mattered in the world. “Yes, please, Harry, please…”
Well, sort of. He had a few guesses. 1) He wanted to see himself suffer. 2) He wanted a reminder that this was real, he was real. 3) No, that was it.
With their lapse in silence, Harry could now hear distinct woops, laughs, and yells over the music and Malfoy’s smooth, sensuous voice. (Where the fuck did that come from?)
At break, Draco approached Samuel and Harry. He nodded his head at them in greeting. Harry mirrored him, his eyes taking in the snug turtleneck underneath his coat, lightly tousled hair, and the heavy bags under his eyes. Harry wanted to kiss him.
“That’s you,” Draco said, his hands on Harry’s chest again; he couldn’t stop touching him, like he needed to believe this was real.
Harry traced it with his fingers, making chills run down Draco’s back. He gently pushed Draco back onto the bed and began pressing kisses everywhere - Draco’s neck, collarbone, chest, scars, stomach.
Ron froze mid-bite and shook his head before saying, “I swear, something happened to you two when you were dating. Some sort of bi curse.”
Abigail made a face. “I’ve only slept eight hours in the past three nights. But it’s nearly the weekend, so I think I might be able to catch up a bit.”
He was both surprised and unsurprised to know that they wanted his permission, and from Ginny, no less. He was strangely touched but a bit hurt that they felt they couldn’t just talk to him.
Draco continued, and he felt one of Harry’s hands grasp at his hair. Harry tugged, and Draco gave a muffled noise of surprised pleasure. Draco went on doing that thing Harry liked so much, and Harry’s fingers twisted in his hair. He felt Harry’s body tense further.
Draco jumped and went to the door. When he opened it, Harry’s hand was raised like he was just about to knock again.
“I know,” Draco said quickly, not wanting to think of it. He very much knew that Abbott’s mother had been killed a few years ago by Death Eaters. “I don’t blame them.”
Harry nodded once more and laid back down, the entire back of his shirt soaked in sweat. He really needed Ginny to bring him another change of clothes.
“I mean, God, obviously the others help too, but with them, I feel like I just bring them down. Like they’re doing so well and whenever I show up and whine about my life I just make it worse for them. But you make it feel like I can tell you anything and you won’t judge me for it or overreact or look at me with pity. I don’t – am I making any sense?”
“I bet you’re having a good laugh, aren’t you, Malfoy?” Potter goaded weakly as he lay back on his bed. He closed his eyes. “This must be bloody hilarious.”
But then Potter fell silent, his gaze once again set firmly on the fireplace. Draco sat and watched him for a few moments before catching his attention.
Harry smiled and leaned in; Draco met him halfway. Pleasure drifted through his entire body at Harry's touch. He didn’t think he could ever tire of this feeling.
“I’m glad to see your ego hasn’t deflated at all,” Draco said wryly, though he thought Potter’s enthusiasm was, for lack of a better word, adorable. He loved seeing Potter drunk. He loved being drunk.
“No, it’s nice,” Harry said truthfully. “There’s nothing to do here. At least in Muggle hospitals they have tellys.”
and have people look at you with pity because they can’t do anything else? Because they can’t even begin to understand and the best they can do is say ‘I’m sorry’? Because I’d really rather not, but you’re welcome to. By all means, Potter, go ahead.”
“It’s alright, Harry,” Ginny said in a soothing voice. “Tell me what’s wrong. We can talk through it together.”
He was on his way to do one final check on the witch in question when one of the Healers in his department stopped him.
Draco looked at him in shock. He felt excitement and nerves all at once, but Harry seemed more distraught than anything.
“I’m just wondering if you still stand by that decision,” Harry said, his lips quirking into a smile. He wanted to open his eyes to see Draco flush, but he was much too comfortable for that. “Like, if it was still worth all the effort to make them.”
“I see your detecting skills have gone unused,” said a familiar voice. “I expected better from you, Malfoy.”
He sighed and lay down on the bed, rubbing his forehead. The headache was coming back and he was feeling a bit drained – maybe realizing that you’ve fucked your life up did that to you.
"We did sort of have a three-day sleepover where we had sex and did other intimate things, so, I think so?"
They spent the rest of break chatting. It turned out Samuel was indeed a year younger than Harry at twenty-one years old. Harry also learned that he was an international relations student at London Metropolitan University. Harry kept the conversation directed towards Samuel; he wasn’t sure how to explain that he dropped out of school before the age of seventeen to kill a Dark Lord, and has since been rather lost.
“I mean, yes, he saved the world and all that rot but you can’t just forget what he’s done before he killed…Him.” She paused, biting her lip. “You two have got a long, complicated past, and I feel like you might be ignoring it, or ignoring what he’s done to you at least, and just seeing this idealized version of him instead.”
“Course I do. I probably heard him insult my dead parents or Hermione or you lot at least once a week for six years straight, save holidays.”
“Hey, I just wanted to say thanks again,” Samuel said kindly. “Are you new here? I don’t recognize you, and I like to think I’m pretty good with faces.”
He poked at his warm porridge with the plastic spoon and knew he wouldn’t be eating any of it. Even if he wanted to, he didn’t think his stomach could manage it.
He found it underneath an old mug of coffee, slightly stained and crumpled. Draco withdrew the newspaper and flipped through it until he’d located the article he had only skimmed through before.
Draco kissed him, overcome with affection. It was still hard to believe that Harry, the famed Chosen One, wanted him, someone known for being a cowardly, arrogant Death Eater.
“He’s still a prat,” Ron said defensively, “But he’s not that bad. And it’s not like we went out looking for him, he just came along with Ginny and Blaise one day and we happened to get on…”
It’s true; Harry had been purposefully evasive. Relationships were about giving and getting, right? One person couldn’t just work for it. He’d learned that from Ginny.
“I thought, it might remind me that this is real. That I’m real. Sometimes I feel disconnected. Or maybe, I think, I deserved it. I wanted to see myself bleed.”
Harry shuddered and cursed under his breath. Encouraged, Draco continued to work Harry open, lapping and teasing. Draco's hands were now gripping Harry's arse tight; his fingertips pressing deep into the skin. When Harry subconsciously pressed his arse into Draco's face, Draco retaliated by sticking his tongue inside.
That time Draco could blame it on the Dark Lord. It was out of fear for the lives of his family that he couldn’t utter a word about what he had to do. That time, it was clear who the guilty party was.
Please let me know what you thought. Twice I got really close to deleting the second half of the chapter cause I didn't like where it was going, but I also didn't want to erase all the progress I'd made for the first time in months. I don't hate it, but I admittedly don't love it uwu there's always ways to improve
Draco woke up late Saturday morning to an apparently empty dorm. He reflected that he had been sleeping much better lately, having been able to sleep for longer amounts of time and with fewer interruptions. Draco laid there with these pleasant revelations for a few minutes before throwing back the curtain that surrounded his bed.
“I’m just thinking about the last time we were here,” Harry said, and relished in how Draco’s cheeks flushed pink, “And how it all began.”
Potter was sat in front of him, staring at him with green eyes that were shockingly different from Leo's.
Draco stopped for a millisecond – pleasure and arousal and anxiety running through him all at once - and then pulled back fully, looking Harry in the eyes.
"I never asked for this!" Draco exploded. "I never asked for you to - to save me or whatever it is you're doing."
“Six quid for you,” said Johnny. He shook out four of the pills and transferred them to a smaller bag.
Draco’s eyes flicked downward, positioning himself, before they met Harry’s gaze once more. Harry felt him put another finger in, and though it was still a tight squeeze, Harry reveled in the feeling.
“I dunno,” he said. “Maybe. But even if they did, I’d still be worried that someone would recognize me.”
“Never mind,” Draco said. “Professor Snape came and fixed me, and now I’m sitting here with you, alive. So drop it.”
“How did you two meet, anyway? I mean, y’know, in recent terms?” Ron asked, his ears still quite red. “Cos you never mentioned him.”
When they’d run out of air, they parted though their hands remained where they were. Draco’s breaths were heavy as he stared up at Leo and became aware of his growing erection. He took his hands back and glanced away, embarrassed, and felt his face and neck go hot.
"Seeing as it's my house," Harry finished for him. He walked towards the two of them. "Good morning."
Harry’s breath caught in his throat. Harry’d done this to him. He’d sliced him open and stood helpless as he bled everywhere. Harry traced one of the scars with a trembling finger, which ran from a collarbone down to his bellybutton. Draco watched, his hair falling in his eyes, expression indiscernible. Finally, he took Harry’s hand and lowered it, his mouth set in a frown.
“Because I made his life hell,” Draco retorted. “You don’t get to conveniently forget everything I’d done to him, especially when I was always worse to him.”
They parted ways before entering the Hall, promising to meet up again later on. It was a Saturday, and that meant time to relax (or in their case, fuck). It made Draco feel giddy but also rather foolish – like it still wasn’t real, like it was still impossible that Harry Potter would give someone like him the time of day.
"Must you?" Draco replied, smirked as his eyes raked over Harry's body. He ran a finger over the scar on his chest, and Harry shivered.
your family," Ginny said, and sounded slightly hurt. "Even if, y'know, we didn't get married like Mum wanted us to."
“Right back at you, mate,” Samuel said kindly, grinning widely. “You’re cool too, even if you’re…mysterious an’ all that.”
A loud noise came from the living room and both Harry and Draco jumped and snatched their hands back. Harry could only glance at Draco’s alarmed face for a second before he was jumped on by Hermione and Ron.
, something he wasn’t supposed to do. It felt like his own, private rebellion, and who better to do that with than Harry Potter?
Warmth spread through Draco, and he wished he could stay here forever. He knew better than that, though.
Harry felt like crying and laughing at the same time and was overwhelmed with the desire to hold Draco and never let go. Draco stared blankly at him, his face white.
“Formal as always,” smiled Cait, who didn’t seem at all discouraged by Malfoy snapping at her. She then rounded on Harry, her dark brown eyes glittering. “Unlike you. But you went to the same school?”
“Nowhere in particular,” Draco said, wondering why he was being evasive. It was like he wanted to keep his conversation with Potter private.
know that you two dating was the most exciting thing to happen to St. Mungo’s staff. Most likely in the entire history of this fine establishment.”
“It’s such a turn-on when you use my surname,” Draco confessed, his eyes dark as he stared down at Harry. “You can’t imagine how fucking
Draco smirked and said, “I suppose we are. Well…although I do very much love borrowing your clothes, I miss having my own. Perhaps we could go over to my flat for a bit.”
He began to walk away, heading in the direction of the eighth-year dorms. Astoria followed him and caught up, coming to walk by his side.
He stood up shakily, grabbed his wand, and thought about the address of a residence he hadn’t been to in a good while. Harry spun into darkness and reemerged on a Muggle street, which was thankfully empty. He stowed his wand, distractedly chastising himself for being so careless, and hurried over to a small, familiar house.
Draco was almost glad that Potter’s back was turned on him, for he was certain he looked like a complete fool with his mouth hanging open.
“I’m very talented at sicking up. Although,” Draco continued despite knowing very well that he should stop, “I have to say I prefer doing it myself. Or rather, making the choice myself.
Their ten minutes was up, and Kathy ushered them back to their seats. Samuel nodded before going back to his seat; Harry sat down, feeling rather pleased with himself. It wasn’t easy making friends; in the Wizarding world, people were too awestruck to actually
“Butterbeer, please,” Leo was saying to the bartender. Once he’d gotten it, he smiled and turned towards Draco. “Hey, boss.”
Harry’s eyes darted away again, finding their way back to Kathy before Malfoy could catch him staring. She had put her clipboard down and was gazing around the room.
He and Pansy had drifted off after the war and trials. Draco had chosen to return to Hogwarts and work on becoming a Healer, while Pansy left for Spain to escape. They still wrote at the time, however, and became each other’s only confidants. With his father in Azkaban and his mother cooped up in the Manor, it was up to Draco to repair the image of the Malfoy name, if such a thing were even possible.
Draco wanted to kiss Harry desperately, but Astoria, let alone the entire student body, were right there. It had felt torturous having to be apart from Harry, though it hadn’t even been a while day. He hoped Harry missed him even half as much.
He brandished his left forearm then, his face burning up as he pulled his sleeve back and Potter looked down at the faded red Mark impassively. Draco’s heart was still racing as he pushed the sleeve back down and lowered his arms.
“I said it was strong, didn’t I?” Harry picked his up and Malfoy did too, albeit reluctantly. “Cheers.”
“You’re so brave,” Draco said softly. Harry buried his face in Draco’s shoulder; Draco thought he might have shaken his head. “I can’t – I can’t even begin to imagine what you’ve gone through, but I’m so glad you’re here. Alive. You’re a
“More than you’d like,” confessed Potter. “I know what went on the night Dumbledore died, and I know that Voldemort made you torture people.”
It smelled delicious, and even though Harry had offered to help, Draco insisted that he just sit down and wait.
He didn’t remember much besides falling and the overwhelming smell of blood. He knew Harry remembered more, and that he was remembering it right now, judging by how tense he was.
“But tell me about yourself, Harry,” Samuel said, surprising him. When he grimaced, Samuel frowned apologetically. “Just a little? I feel like I hardly know you.”
The question caught Draco off guard, and he shifted in his seat before glancing tentatively over at Potter. Potter wasn’t looking at him, though; he was facing the fire, his expression stony.
Draco felt even guiltier at the thought – conspiring to get his boyfriend drunk just so he could talk to him? That couldn’t be the sign of a healthy relationship, could it?
Harry had immediately gone for the shower and put on a change of clothes, not knowing if Ginny even knew what weed smelled like but also not wanting to take any chances. When he had emerged from the bathroom, hair wet and heart pounding, Ginny frowned at him.
“He – well, we had, er, an argument a few days ago,” Harry said nervously, looking away. “So it’s been a bit
He couldn’t argue with her, a near ghost of what she had been before the Dark Lord had wreaked havoc on the world, and in his family.
Draco walked inside, forcing his face to be as impassive as possible. Potter stared at Draco with the same defiant look he had given him when Draco had first walked into his hospital room, daring him to say something.
Hermione gave him a one-armed hug and sat down as well. "We're so sorry we haven't been able to visit, Harry."
She placed a bowl of porridge, an orange, and a glass of pumpkin juice on the tray that was now floating above Harry’s lap.
Harry had already tossed off his glasses and shirt by the time they’d gotten to the bedroom. He sat down on the still sheet-less bed and looked at Draco expectantly. Draco took in the gorgeous sight, eyes bright and unobscured by those ugly (yet endearing) glasses, his slightly dark skin that contrasted so deeply against Draco’s own, and the visible bulge underneath the grey sweatpants.
“Mental, your lot. Completely mental. Who thinks it’s acceptable to just barge into somebody’s home unannounced? And then
He lifted his shirt and examined his body at all angles. He ran his free hand down his stomach, cursing himself for eating too much at dinner. He felt like there was still more food that he could get out, but it was pointless now. He’d waited much too long, and he didn’t fancy going down to Myrtle’s loo all over again anyway.
“Calmer,” Harry said truthfully. He stared at the water droplets on his glass as he spoke. “I’m just…embarrassed, mostly. I hate hurting Ginny like that, just knowing I’ve done that, making her so upset, it’s...”
Malfoy’s gaze lingered on Harry for another moment, his expression still impossible to read, before it moved to rest on the current speaker.
“He spent the night,” Harry said, his face flushing as he thought back to those three blissful days. “Several nights. We talked…and…yeah.”
Part of Draco wanted to leave right there – he didn’t have to take this – but part of him was just as stubborn as Harry was.
“Pansy thinks it’s impossible too,” Draco sighed. He felt his irritation rise. “Like I’m just ignoring or forgetting everything that’s happened before. But I’m not.”
“No, no, I wasn’t,” Draco said quickly. He frowned down at his untouched latte. “I was just surprised. I would’ve never thought that you’d…I
Leo came closer. Draco held his breath as Leonel took the glass out of his hands and set it on the coffee table. He parted Draco’s legs and crawled on top of him so they’d be face to face.
Estrada’s entire body had tensed up and the open expression on his face had turned to one of mild fear. Harry couldn’t find it in him to feel too badly about it; in fact, he wasn’t feel much of anything at the moment.
“But it’s not just the nightmares, is it?” Draco asked quietly. “You’ve mentioned other things. The – the abuse. Why it didn’t work with Ginny Weasley. And I remember…you said something about how you can’t get what happened out of your head. Like – you can’t forget.”
The rest of their dinner went relatively normally; Harry asked Draco about work, and Draco asked Harry the same (or the closest thing Harry had to it, anyway). The way Draco asked made Harry think he might have been following the press surrounding him, but Harry said nothing about it. He simply told Draco about how he’d joined a few wizarding organizations that focused on mental health awareness and potion addiction. He rarely liked using his fame to his advantage, but this was for a good cause – and one that was close to him as well. And besides, it’s not like he had anything better to do.
“I want you to be happy, Draco,” she said. “I don’t want you to hang around these people if they aren’t making you happy. You come first.”
Betty gave him a sympathetic smile and nodded as well. "Alright. Is there anything else I can do for you?"
A few seconds later, Draco was brushing himself off in Wolff's beige office. Julia Wolff sat at her desk, a calm, welcoming expression on her distinctly Germanic face. She smiled at Draco.
he was so hot Draco Malfoy was sucking him off right now he was so beautiful and he felt so good his mouth his lips his teeth his tongue.
“Excellent.” Draco smiled a bit. “Now, Potter, this may burn a bit, but I assure you that it’s beneficial. Do you understand?”
The class shifted as students found their respective partners; the sound of friendly conversation and flipping textbooks soon filled the room. Draco had been so busy cursing his situation that he didn’t notice Blaise had already left and Potter had taken his place.
Draco stared at it, unable to think of anything to say. He didn’t want to have to take it; Potter shouldn’t have to be uncomfortable just because of his forgetfulness. But he did know that he was cold, and Potter was offering, and the scarf would surely smell like him…
“Well,” she said cautiously. It was clear she hadn’t told this story before. “Harry taking potions isn’t anything new. He started taking Dreamless Sleep shortly after the war ended. But it was still an approved amount back then, and he only took it when necessary. But when he started training as an Auror, it got worse.”
He knew, of course, the reason for feeling so poorly. It’d been looming over his head the past week, tormenting and taunting him from the back of his mind. And the past few nights, he’d been having nightmares about it, the same exact scene playing over and over again.
“Ask him next time. Tell him you’d feel more comfortable around him if you were more familiar with him. Or I can talk to him for you.”
Harry wasn’t sure if he should stand; he wasn’t particularly hungry. Before he could decide, he saw that Samuel was walking towards him. Harry stood up.
A positively pink Draco was frozen underneath the covers as a bewildered Hermione Granger stood in the doorway with her hands covering her mouth. Kreacher stood behind her – the obvious source of the muttering.
Betty seemed to read his mind, and asked, "Would you be able to talk about it with your friends, if not with me?"
He felt so pathetic. He was just a sad excuse of a person, unable to function without the help of a few substances. He didn't know how people did it without them.
But maybe Draco was looking at it all wrong. Maybe Draco had nothing to do with Potter’s change in mood. He
It was 4 pm by the time Draco felt confident that they were doing all they could for Douglas and that he could move on to other patients and do his rounds. He saved Potter for last – because of nerves, perhaps? Or maybe because Draco wanted to spend more time with him.
“Can I tell them?” Harry asked Draco, who nodded curtly. He then said to his two best friends, “At group.”
“There’s no excuse for it, I know that. He was shitty and hateful and really fucking prejudiced,” Harry said, his voice still low. Hermione didn’t look up. “I won’t ever forget. I couldn’t, even if I wanted to. But he’s changed, he’s really changed. He’s practically been living as a Muggle these past four years. Muggle jobs, Muggle flat, hell, Muggle group. He knows he’s done wrong – he feels really badly about it.”
The two of them loitered in a relatively quiet corner for a good hour, drinking and chatting and people-watching. They laughed at Blaise chatting up some Ravenclaw girl Draco barely recognized, and at Pansy and Daphne dancing unabashedly with what looked like a pair of Gryffindor seventh years.
“It was still wrong of me to make wild assumptions of your life and spread them to anyone who would listen,” Malfoy said and crossed his arms.
Despite himself, Draco smiled. He was glad he wasn’t the only one who was immune to Potter worship. Though he wasn’t exactly sure if he could say that about himself anymore.
Harry wondered if Ginny had said anything to Ron, but judging by the way he was greeted when he walked in (normally), he figured she hadn’t.
Harry stared at a corner of the room because eye contact was difficult. He sat there wringing his hands, wondering how to proceed. He forced himself to stop moving his hands.
Harry was surprised by Estrada calling Malfoy by his first name. Not the Head Healer, and not even Healer Malfoy. Just 'Draco.'
Draco continued to guide him, now thrusting his hips forward in time with the rest of their movements.
“Sorry,” he mumbled. He watched as she wiped fresh tears away, her brown eyes red. “I should have warned you before all that.”
Fourteen hours wasn’t even that much compared to some days, but all Draco wanted to do was go home, change out of his robes, and collapse into bed. He did
“Because it’s important,” Draco finished. He turned back around to face Harry, a completely defeated expression his face.
Draco hanging his Healers robes on Harry’s coat hanger was truly the least of his worries right now.
Draco knew Harry could find him anywhere (though he still didn’t know how Harry managed to do so), but he made his way to the lake after revising with Pansy and Blaise in the library. Draco sat himself down and pulled out a cigarette.
He swallowed thickly and took off his glasses to wipe away the moisture from his face, feeling like an overlarge toddler. He let go of Ginny and sat up straight, finding it difficult to look her in the eyes.
“You like that, Potter?” came Draco’s breathy voice, and it just made Harry suck more desperately. “You like it when I fuck your face?”
“After we’ve completed the cleansing procedure, we’ll focus on the psychological effects of your addiction.” Malfoy said, seeming to sense that Harry was about to interrupt with a denial. “It’s nothing to be ashamed of. The Healers at St. Mungo’s are completely prepared to treat you both physically and mentally through outsourcing. There’ve been changes made in the recent years so we’re better able to treat our patients and fulfill all their needs. You are not the first to come here needing addiction treatment, Potter, and you won’t be the last.”
“Oh,” frowned Harry. “I just – you were there when I had to rehash my brilliant upbringing, weren’t you? That day at group? Yeah.”
The two of them began walking to room fourteen while Betty caught Draco up on other happenings in the Ward while he had been absent. Everyone seemed to be doing well, especially one patient who’d been bitten on the arm by a Venomous Tentacula a day before.
“Now hold your breath…one…two…three…four…five…six…seven. Exhale completely through your mouth. One…two…three…four…five…six…seven…eight.”
He had apparently chosen to keep his hair at the length it had grown into during his absent year – it nearly reached his shoulders. Who’d have thought perpetually messy hair looked better longer? He had also filled out his robes better than he ever had in all his years of schooling – Draco would know, he had spent six consecutive years glaring at his classmate. Potter laughed at something Weasley said.
He raised his wand and preformed the spells that had become so familiar to Harry the last two weeks. It was strange to think that it was (hopefully) the last time Malfoy would cast these spells on him. Harry watched Malfoy’s look of concentration, studying the furrow of his brow and the way a strand of white-blond hair fell in his eyes.
“I forgot you’ve seen it before. I mean, you’ve even touched it before,” Potter said conversationally. He put it down on the table and went back to gripping his tea.
Potter’s expression was indiscernible and Draco wanted to disappear, but then he finally said, “Thanks, Malfoy.”
Draco heard a light knock on the door and he opened it. Harry stood outside, looking absolutely gorgeous in his black hoodie. It shouldn’t have been allowed, how good the man looked in simple Muggle clothing.
Nowadays, he saw himself in the lime green robes more than anything, so it was a bit of a boost to his self-esteem when he wore Muggle clothing. He chose a simple fitted black T-shirt accompanied by a grey zip-up, and his favorite jeans that made his arse look incredible (in his humble opinion). He swept his hair out of his face even though it would get messed up from Apparition anyway.
“Yeah, well, I do,” Ron said uncomfortable. He turned to speak to Harry again. “Point is you should stay here so you can do it properly. Then you can leave.”
"You were probably thinking something like 'I've never seen such a fit American before, I need his cock up my arse right now,'" Ira said with a smirk.
“That’s the weird thing about war, isn’t it?” Ron joked, and Hermione glared at him (albeit lovingly).
Ginny’s face went from suspicious to scared to angry in a matter of seconds, her eyes wide and mouth open.
Even though winter was typically the second-hardest season for Harry (the first being summer, for obvious reasons), this winter was turning out to be pleasant.
And then Harry realized that he was shirtless, wearing only pants - too panicked to put on clothing before rushing out the room.
It was him, after all, who was too scared to draw attention to himself, especially near Harry. These bitter thoughts didn’t leave his mind, but bounced around in his head, taunting him.
