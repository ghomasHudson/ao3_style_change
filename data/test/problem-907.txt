Like now, he’d supposed. “Fine, let’s see what you’ve got,” Draco sighed, there was no telling what he’d have to put up with when it came to Acelin. Still, he smiled fondly at his bird before looking down at his talons, fully expecting to see a letter in his clutch. When he didn’t see one though, he groaned dramatically and sent a pointed look at the flying menace resting on his shoulder. “Nothing, you knocked me down only to show me you have nothing to give me?”
He heard a faint whispering, but in his reduced state he couldn’t make out the words. It sounded eerie, and wrong. He felt the magic from earlier tug at him, and then a presence seemingly looked him over for a fraction of a second. As this happened Draco pathetically tried to raise his Occlumency shields higher.
By Halloween Draco was feeling much better. He had caught up with all of his assignments, and even scored well on his history exam. Most fortunately, Draco’s anxiety did not harm his academics. In fact, he spent more time studying and doing schoolwork in an effort to avoid people, so he wouldn’t be surprised if he surpassed Granger in scores soon.
Flint gave the blond haired girl a questioning glance, but answered her question nonetheless. “Yes. He’d be Seeker even if he was awful, just because of his father’s money. Luckily, he’d have been Seeker even without the money- he’s actually rather decent.”
“What in Merlin’s name were you thinking,” Lucius Malfoy hissed. His grip was still ironclad on Draco’s shoulder.
Upon realizing this, Draco immediately switched to the defensive. She had seemed awfully curious about the diary, and Draco couldn't afford to let anyone know about what it could actually do. “Yes. But who’s to say it wasn’t a rhetorical question? Small talk, and all that,” Daphne said, letting out a huff of laughter.
Ginny hesitated, but let him lead her away. Before they left, Astoria stepped up and called out towards the two Gryffindors. “Thank you for...for defending me, and my other housemates.”
“No thank you, Severus. I’ll get more rest, I promise. Now, can I please be dismissed, "professor"?  Draco teased. “Pansy and Blaise are probably driving the other Slytherins mad right now.”
“There you have it, Mr. Malfoy. You were feeling unwell, and you left the hall early- most likely to go to the hospital wing. I’d assume Miss Greengrass saw you struggling and decided to help you. You two are close, aren’t you?” Draco nodded, and Dumbledore smiled serenely. “Excellent. I’d assume that she was attacked along the way to catch up to you, and perhaps, you were attacked too?”
Severus was hesitant to let the boy leave- he wanted to figure out what was actually causing him so much distress. Knowing he wouldn’t get anything out of him today though, he said “Fine. You’re dismissed. But do keep to that promise; I wasn’t kidding about the theory work.”
His father hadn’t been around much either, staying out late at the ministry or taking to his office almost as soon as he got home. He had, however, surprised Draco a week or two into the break with the promise of a new broom. Draco had gotten nearly perfect scores on his exams, only beaten just barely by that muggleborn girl.
“Look, Mr. Malfoy, I understand this is hard for you. A close friend of yours was just the victim of a tragic incident, and you may be a victim yourself. But you must remain calm, and avoid jumping to outrageous conclusions. A second-year like yourself played no part in this incident, I assure you of that. Therefore, there is no need for you to feel guilty about this whole event- it wasn’t your fault.”

But Severus wasn’t a normal person, much less a normal adult. He’d been trained to seek out lies, and being a Hogwarts professor had only helped him to stay in practice. Especially when dealing with sneaky Slytherins, creative Ravenclaws, stubborn Gryffindors, and loyal Hufflepuffs.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco's eyes widened only slightly. The Dark Lord really did trust and value his father then. So, if he trusted Draco to that same degree...perhaps he wouldn’t need to take the mark to be a Deatheater. The Dark Lord would trust him so much that he wouldn’t need to take the mark.  Maybe he’d even be so close to the Lord that he wouldn’t have to kill unless it was to protect him from a direct attack.
That wouldn’t have concerned him normally, but with how tired he was he definitely should not have felt that clear minded. Shrugging it off, Draco placed the quill and ink off to the side and pulled the diary closer to him. He then laid down on the sofa and let sleep embrace him.
It was a good relationship. But Draco knew he’d always be divided from his friends in a way nobody else would. He had to put his friends in fourth place. Always.
“Family heirloom,” Draco responded- his voice equally casual. Draco looked up from his book momentarily, and saw Blaise open his mouth to refute his statement. He couldn’t let them figure this out. He hated to show weakness, even if it was made up, but he had to do this.
He refrained from writing a lot in the diary during the next few days. Riddle didn’t seem to mind much. He just seemed to want to know about Draco’s day more often than not. After exchanging slight pleasantries, Riddle would usually end the conversation and bid Draco goodnight. Draco wasn’t going to complain about that outcome.
Granger looked up at him, the worry in her eyes replaced with irritation. “Malfoy. How can we help you?” Granger asked, false politeness in her voice.
________________________________________________________________________________________________
Draco was very diligent, and he would never stay up as late as he had knowing he’d have classes in the morning- the exception being he was working on assignments or studying for an exam. Weekends were the obvious inconsistency, as Draco could spend hours staying up in the common room with the other Slytherins.
Draco knew he wouldn’t have much time, the twins were trying to get to him after all. Ginerva Weasley had taken to yelling at Crabbe and Goyle, and so Draco chose that moment to pull the diary from his robes, and quickly draw his wand. He cast the spell, concentrating on Ginevra’s trunk and the diary simultaneously.
With hesitation, she answered him, “I looked at it. I know I shouldn’t have, but I needed answers.”
Draco was lucky for a while, as he saw nobody in sight. ‘They must be at the feast still.’ But soon enough, his luck wore off. Draco heard three voices around the next corridor, and came to an abrupt halt. He recognized those voices...of all the times to run into Potter and his gang.
As a result, Draco really tried to be there for his mother. He understood how much he meant to her, and didn’t want to disappoint,-or hurt- her by being absent.
“You’re saying you want theory work? For a week?” Snape said, raising an eyebrow. Draco nodded vigorously in response to that.
‘They must have reported this by now,’ thought Draco solemnly. ‘Very well. I must not be that far from Dumbledore’s office.’
“Draco, what do you think Zarcharias Smith would say about joining us at the Slytherin table?” Pansy asked, abruptly startling Draco out of his thoughts.
Instead, Draco was greeted by a shimmering of ink on the once blank parchment. Words started to form, and Draco held the diary out towards the fire to see them more clearly.
So, when his friends didn’t fuss over him like they normally would’ve...Draco felt...something. Anger? No. He knew what it was. What a ridiculous thing to feel hurt about. He scolded himself for feeling this way. Draco knew better than to feel sad over something so pointless. He should’ve expected it anyways. Why didn’t he?
Nonetheless, Draco answered the Dark Lords questions- every one of them. He told him about his magical expertise, his immense loathing for Harry Potter and his friends, and his family. He didn't realize how much time was flying by, and was only aware of it when he heard a muttering from the other side of the room.
He felt drained. The pain he once felt gave way to a numbness. And the numbing feeling made him relaxed. He lay back down and closed his eyes- feeling sleep wash over him.
“Of course. I need to know who has the diary in their possession, don’t I? If, say, Dumbledore had the diary, I would need to know that to stay safe, wouldn’t I?” Riddle mused.
“Draco. I need to remind you to complete the task quickly. Do you have a plan yet?” Lucius said this with firm eyes, and a rigid posture.
“Mother, I apologize for shaming the family name. I’m sure father told you about what I’d done, and I-“ He was stopped when a comforting hand was placed on his shoulder. It was quite unlike the way his father's hand had gripped him earlier, but the area was indeed slightly bruised, and he winced nonetheless.
As luck would have it, Snape chose that moment to enter the classroom. He immediately turned his attention on Potter, and Potter scowled in return. “Mr. Potter. Take a seat.”
Bad decision, he’d soon discovered. Talking about Potter only resulted in his father lecturing him once more on social connections and the like- fueling his rage further. Before he could throw in another retort a man with a haggled demeanor and black hair stepped up behind the counter. “Ah, Mr. Borgin,” Lucius said, lifting his voice and portraying his perfect pureblood mask once more, the reprimanding tone he used only seconds before gone without a trace.
Once class ended Snape attempted to corner him, but Draco slipped away before he could do so. He didn’t need another person questioning him on his tired demeanor. He knew he'd need to talk with Snape soon, but now was not the time.
“Ah, the Hand of Glory!” Mr. Borgin proclaimed, bustling over to the youngest Malfoy and completely forgetting his previous client with the hope of making a sale. His shopkeeper persona came on in full force as he explained the hands' purpose. Draco had to admit, this man was oddly good at exaggerating the effects of the product, and a much better businessman than he’d assumed. He supposed this was why his father respected him.
And with that, Draco shoved the diary into his bag and made his way to the Great Hall. He would eat dinner, and after that work on Transfiguration homework. Then he would go to his dorm early, and actually open the diary. Then he would write in it, and everything would be fine. He would obey the Dark Lord’s commands. And he would do this all on his own. He would do this for his family; for his father.
Once the potions were consumed he made his way down to the library. He had some time before breakfast, and he intended to spend that time in the quiet, dim library. It always eased him, what with its peaceful tranquility and the soft thrum of ancient magic embedded in the room. The Manor itself was ancient, but the library was the oldest room in the house.
Draco honestly expected the younger Gryffindor to back down at that point, but she stood her ground. It gave him enough time to send a jinx of his own at the older student, who grumbled in surprise as his hand was struck with a sharp pain and his wand clattered to the ground.
Before he could be bombarded, Draco tugged the curtains away and stepped out of bed. “Don’t bother. I’m up.”
Draco sighed, and he turned away from his mother. It was so easy to believe her. She was logical- her reasons were valid. And yes, he’d certainly done nothing like Sirius Black, or even Andromeda Black, had done. He hadn’t painfully shamed the family, but he’d still shamed it. Narcissa just couldn’t admit his faults, but Lucius could. And if his father had said he’d shamed the family- then he had.
Draco stopped his frantic scanning of the books pages as he heard a slight clicking noise from behind him. He sighed under his breath and averted his eyes from the book. “You know you’d be far more quiet if you casted a muffliato on your heels mother,” Draco said.
Draco waited at the entrance of the great hall with Daphne and Theodore. The feast had ended, and Daphne was scanning the sea of students for her younger sister- Astoria. Astoria had gotten separated from her sister as soon as Dumbledore released everyone from the great hall. And Daphne wasn’t about to leave her first year Slytherin sister behind.
Potter grit his teeth and sulkily walked over to Draco. He set his bag down and took a seat before continuing to fire an angry glare at Snape.
Still, just thinking about all the stories he'd heard about Knockturn Alley really did excite him. More importantly, this trip was going to turn out to be one of the best yet- not only did he get to accompany his father on an important errand (whatever it may be), he was also going into Knockturn Alley and, almost certainly, he would be getting his new broom as well. Draco smiled gleefully with his next thought, ‘I suppose the good thing about going shopping for my supplies  later in the month means I have a better chance of not running into Potter and his sidekicks.’ Yes, the prospect of this shopping trip seemed to get better and better.
Yet, even with the darkness surrounding him, Draco could clearly see his hand wave dully across his face. He also felt like he was floating, and when he slowly sat up and looked around him he realized he “was” in a pool of water.
He could do this. His father may not like the Weasleys but...he wouldn’t seriously hurt them. Not only that, but if this object was really dangerous he wouldn’t have gotten Draco involved at all- much less give him the dangerous object. And he was a supporter of his father’s beliefs, therefore a supporter of the Dark Lord. So, the diary couldn’t actually hurt him. There was too much evidence to support that.
When it was really cold- usually during winter- it wasn’t unusual to see a Slytherin or two curled up asleep in front of the fireplace on one of the sofas, seeking some warmth. Of course, the upper years had mastered especially powerful warming charms so they didn’t rely on the fireplaces that much, but they were a nice touch.
That didn’t stop Millicent or Daphne though, who both continued to look at him uncertainly. “No. You had it in Potter’s compartment and not at all on the way back. I remember that cause’ it had a creepy feeling to it,” Vincent said, looking up from his parchment. Goyle blinked for a second, then nodded vigorously.
Yet, the whole point of this was that his friends felt similarly. They must, because they’re Slytherins as well. And they understood family and purpose. He knew they wouldn’t hesitate to leave him if his reputation dropped dramatically, or if their parents ordered them to.
Draco shook his head, “The feast was fine.” At this point, Draco’s memory blanked. He paused for a second longer, before stating something he knew to be true. “I wasn’t feeling well.”
With that plea he turned to stare longingly at the ring. If it really wasn't a scam, a pretty thing with false promises...he could potentially change the future, whatever it was supposed to look like for him, and maybe...just maybe. ‘Maybe I can finally be just as great. I can be recognized.’ It was a long shot. But he had to take it, it just felt...right.
Draco's father nodded in acceptance. “I ask you to complete your first task in becoming a Deatheater.” At Dracos shock he paused. His son knew he had been a Deatheater, that he was one, but he believed the Dark Lord to be dead. Harry Potter's existence had been enough proof for him.
“In case you’ve forgotten this is a partnered brewing session, and I know how dreadful you are in this class. You need to do something to get credit, and I won’t have your idiocy mucking up the potion. Plus, I don’t feel like getting the ingredients,” Draco shrugged. He slowly started to tidy up their workstation (even though it was practically spotless already), and Potter just rolled his eyes at him.
Draco was mid way through his steak and kidney pie when the whispers started. He didn’t pay them much attention- he never really did- but Pansy was the opposite. Pansy was a gossiper, and she had no trouble admitting it. In fact, she was happy to give up any information she had on anyone...so long as people paid the right price.
With that the diary absorbed the ink as it usually did, but this time there was no response. Instead, Draco just felt the world get distorted, and he realized he couldn’t seem to move his fingers anymore. His vision was blurring, and he felt as though he should just close his eyes and rest. He did just that, but was met with a falling sensation rather than the comfort of his bed.
When the trio reached the Great Hall Draco made his way over to Blaise and Theo. The three boys started to talk about the upcoming quidditch game, and Draco loaded his plate with delicious foods. Absently, he noted that Crabbe and Goyle began to wolf down their already served portions while Pansy looked on in disgust.
“I let it slide in Borgin and Burkes, when you interrupted me and started talking foolishly. But then, not only do you cause a scene in the middle of a bookstore, but you embarrass the family name by attacking me in public.”
Which, quite frankly, didn’t make any sense to Draco. Why would the Dark Lord be more interested in a second year Slytherin than the person who killed him? Or, for that matter, one of the most powerful wizards in existence?
As he closed his bedroom door behind him he took a second to compose himself. He had to get himself together, and the first task in doing so was to discard of the cursed ring. Looking down at his hand he saw the shining stone twinkle up at him innocently, and he snarled at that. This thing was probably a fraud, no wizard or witch in history had been able to travel into the future, or create an artifact that could do so. Nor had any invention for glimpses into the future been made, so this ring theoretically shouldn’t exist- and it didn’t. It was a joke; similar to something you would buy at Zonkos.
At first he didn’t think anything would happen. The words had blinked back at him for a fraction of a second before they were absorbed by the parchment. Draco held his breath, expecting a voice to whisper through his mind, or possibly a vision to appear before him. Neither happened.
Once he was settled, Dumbledore vanished the glass and strode past him. “I do believe we should have this conversation in my office, Mr. Malfoy.” Draco dumbly nodded. Dumbledore gave him a curt smile and stepped up to the gargoyle, leaning into the creepy thing. Whispering the password, Draco realized that Dumbledore really didn’t trust him. ‘Good. He shouldn’t.’
Draco saw her staring at him- in that same determined way- before his vision started to blur as well. He fought against the feeling all he could, ‘I won’t cause a scene in the Great Hall, damn it!” But that just resulted in sharp pain. He winced, but continued to fight. Eventually the pain was too harsh, and the sickly feeling too overwhelming. Draco gave in.
Draco didn’t know what he’d been expecting from Tom Riddle- the Dark Lord- when he’d agreed to meet him, but a charming Slytherin 7th year was not it. Nonetheless, he followed the boy through the murky liquid and eventually to a shore.
“I was saving your sister from these bloody snakes!” Mclaggen proclaimed. Fred Weasley looked at the Slytherins with anger for a split second before he turned to his sibling.
He cursed under his breath, and he cast a quick ‘Tempus’ spell. Upon seeing the time Draco groaned- classes were going to be a pain. With a final goodbye to Tom Riddle, Draco closed the diary gently and immediately felt a wave of exhaustion fall upon him. Strangely, he felt sharper- like he could see things clearer, and actually make sense of things.
Draco stopped writing in the diary for a few days after that first experience. If writing in it would constantly wear him out, then he needed to regain some strength before writing in it again so he’d still be of use to the Dark Lord. Plus, exhaustion really wasn’t a good look on him- and if he continued to look tired his friends would become suspicious.
Looking back around he realized the trio were looking up at Lucius Malfoy in surprise, before looking down at Draco’s hand. ‘Shite, they must have noticed the ring, though, I don’t understand how you couldn’t notice it with it glowing like that.” Draco inwardly cringed. This wasn’t going to end well.
Draco shrugged. ‘Two can play this game. I’ll just act calm too...even if he's far better at acting that part than I am.’ He cleared his throat, “Just assignments. I’ve been doing some extra research too...stuff my father wanted me to look into. And of course I have a social life to maintain.”
“But mother, I defied father, and I acted unlike a pureblood,” Draco tried to reason with her. She was very smart, but she often gave him the benefit of the doubt too much.
Unbeknownst to Draco, the compartment door had been opened, and none other than Fred and George Weasley had stepped into the compartment. The twins were fighting with Crabbe and Goyle to get to Draco. But Draco’s lackeys weren’t about to give up that easily.
Normally, Ginny wouldn’t have been strong enough to push the third year away like that. But he was taken by surprise, and that gave her an advantage. “She wasn’t doing anything to me! She just looked lost so I separated from the Gryffindors to help her!” Ginny shouted.
They didn’t have a reason too though. Draco wouldn’t dare to cry, and especially not in public. Lucius made it very known that that wasn’t something a pureblood heir did. Instead, Lucius taught him how to suppress those feelings, and now, Draco didn’t think he "could" cry. Perhaps tear up if he was in severe pain, but never cry. And certainly never cry over something emotional, or as silly as "his feelings getting hurt".
It had been some time after the whole “incident” that Lucius had finally approached him one on one. It was two days before he would go back to Hogwarts, and he was still trying to find a ritual to appease Lucius. Unfortunately, he couldn’t seem to find one that matched a situation similar to his. ‘But there has to be one, I just haven’t found the right book yet.’
At his friend’s smirk Draco set his fork down and looked at her inquisitively. “I assume this has to do with the whispers?”
Draco perked up at that. He hoped he knew what the Slytherin was implying. “You’ll let me help you now?”
“Well, well, well- Arthur Weasley,” Lucius smirked.
Eventually, the feeling was swept away. It was a slow process, but soon enough Draco felt the lethargy melt and give way to clarity once more. When Draco opened his eyes he saw nothing. A plain black canvas that seemed to have depth, and that reminded him of a night sky without the moon or stars.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
As he watched his father walk over to his mother, he nodded determinedly and made his way back to the compartment. As he sat down in the seat closest to the window he scanned the crowd rapidly. No sign of the Weasleys. ‘Though, they are usually late,’ He thought.
Crimson. Crimson liquid trickled from his palm. He’d gripped the wall too hard and cut himself on the jagged stone. He didn’t care. All Draco saw at that moment was the vibrant substance tracing the center of his palm, and flowing in a little river down his wrist. It stained his white shirt, leaving a little drop of red that slowly expanded by the minute. Red...Daphne...red.
“Eloquently put,” was Daphne's snarky reply. Draco just continued to sulk all the way to the library as Daphne tried to contain her bubbly laughter. She came off as serious and studious most of the time, and she was. But when she wasn’t playing student or detective, she was a really thoughtful and buoyant person.
But Pansy was also a Slytherin. She protected other Slytherins, and she didn’t stab other Slytherin’s in the back. She also let information slip to certain Slytherins free of charge. Draco was one of those Slytherins, much to his delight.
“Oh really, and what are you so "preoccupied" with then?” Severus questioned. Draco really hated that his godfather was so Slytherin sometimes- the calmness he wore right now made Draco jealous.
Dumbledore sighed, an old and weary sigh, and held his hand out for Draco. Draco softly placed the back of his hand against Dumbledore’s, albeit highly hesitant to do so. Dumbledore examined his palm before taking out his wand and clearing away the blood, revealing the deep scratches underneath. Draco saw the blood clear from his other hand as well, though that one didn’t appear to be injured.
So sorry this chapter took as long as it did to update; life’s just been hectic. But I hope you enjoyed this chapter, and I can’t wait to start working on the next one! As always, thank you for the nice comments and the kudos- I really do appreciate it. Constructive criticism is always appreciated~ have a great day!
When the potion’s master did reappear, he held out an opened bottle filled with a dull purple liquid for Draco to take. Under normal circumstances, Draco would’ve asked what the potion was. Under normal circumstances, he wouldn’t have needed to ask because he’d know that it was a simple potion, really. Dreamless sleep was easily identifiable, and Draco was familiar with it. These weren’t normal circumstances.
But when Draco looked back at Astoria she seemed to be rather calm. Her shoulders, once tense, were slack with relief. And she wore a small smile on her face. And when Theodore clapped him on the shoulder and announced that they too should head back to their dorm, well, Draco almost felt bad for giving the Weasley girl that diary.
And it did work. Draco looked around at everyone else and saw them look away from him, or lower their head in an apologetic gesture. And that was the end of the conversation. Everyone either stood up and went to bed, or silently worked on their own assignments.
Draco couldn’t care. He was confused and scared, and tired. And, unfortunately, he wasn’t an idiot. Blood on his hands, then Daphne. His general location. The fog in his brain. They added up to one conclusion. The blood on his hands wasn’t his- not at the beginning at least; he was pretty certain he’d bled somewhere in his ferocious moment of collapse.
“Lucius, perhaps we should discuss this matter privately after dinner, hmm?” Narcissa quipped, never breaking eye contact with her husband- instead narrowing her eyes further, hoping to get her point across.
Draco closed the wounds at the human’s neck and wrist and carried him to a guest room to recover, he'd let Harry overindulge and Oliver could hardly stand himself up. When Draco returned to his chambers Harry was sleeping once again, but Draco was bored and the night was still young, not even midnight, so he shook Harry awake. Harry grumbled, but rolled over to look at Draco hovering over him with his knees on either side of Harry's hips.
Draco could hear his destination before he saw it, and he slowed his run. Harry dropped down from the canopy above him, landing on the balls of his feet directly beside him. "Where are we going?" Harry asked with curious excitement.
Harry wrinkled his nose. "He's scared. I can smell it." Draco grinned, his new one was such a quick learner.
“You said you would teach me.” Harry replied with slight indignation.
Harry released his grasp and knelt to lick the wound at Draco's groin closed, he was sure the vampire would be displeased if the bite was left to heal on its own and mark his skin. Draco held up his hand. "No, leave it."
“Why do i feel this way?” Harry lamented, “the blood consumes me, but the more I drink the hungrier I feel. I must being going mad.”
"Are you ready, Harry?" He murmured with his lips ghosting against Harry's ear. Harry would have blushed at the touch had he been freshly fed, and he nodded at Draco.
“Harry.” Draco murmured to himself. “I’d like to be your friend Harry.”
The stag’s scent still lingered in the meadow and Harry breathed it in deeply. He followed the animal’s trail until he spotted it near the edge of the forest. The stag stopped abruptly and flicked its ears in Harry’s direction. It could sense him. Suddenly, Harry leapt through the air, launching himself at the huge stag. He knocked the animal to the ground and growled as he sank his teeth into it’s neck. Blood filled his mouth and Harry retched, the taste was foul and gamey. The hunger raged inside of him, unsatisfied, and he ripped the animal to pieces.
"Because secrecy is of the utmost importance. Your family can never see you again. Do you understand me?"
"Would it kill us?" Harry asked him plainly. "The sun?"
Hi! I’m sorry sorry this is literally a month late. I’d give you an excuse but really I just have a touch of the depression and couldn’t write, whoops. Anyway please enjoy this chapter and please don’t hate me and there’s more coming but I don’t know when.
“My entire staff is human, and if you eat them I will be very angry with you. Restraint, Harry.”
An eerie calm possessed Lavender, she rested her head on her shoulder revealing the pulsing point in her neck. Harry inhaled a deep breath through his nose. The scent of Lavender’s blood burned, white hot, in his lungs and his rapid heartbeat quickened. There was a pause as Harry considered this moment. Only a few hours ago the burning in his chest would have made him savage, but it was different now. He could smell subtleties in the blood like he hadn’t before, Lavender’s smelled particularly of citrus and Harry wondered if it would taste that way too. After another deep inhale, Harry bore his fangs and pierced the small beating heart in the girl’s neck.
“That was ... incredible, Draco. Her blood, I’ve never tasted anything like it. But, it wasn’t just the blood, I could feel her emotions when I drank, I could feed them and change them. How?”
"Not truly. I know I was born in France in June of 1416, and I know the names and titles of my family at the time. I only know any of that because my family was from great wealth and they were able to keep records of that sort of thing. But there are no images that live in my mind from that time, no voices of people long dead."
"Drink," Draco said, offering his wrist to Harry. Harry's breath quickened and he pulled Draco's wrist to his lips without hesitation. Draco's blood poured into his mouth and it set his senses on fire. It was unlike anything Harry had ever experienced and he found himself engulfed in hedonistic pleasure. He
Draco, who had been nearly forgotten in all this, watched in rapture. His new one, still feral just the day before, was now a sight to behold, it was as if he had been born to be a vampire. Draco had never seen a new one compell a human so easily, nevertheless on their first try. If he wasn’t wholly enamored with Harry before, he certainly was now.
Harry stood reluctantly and crossed the room to see himself. He was still surprised by every movement he made, so precise and quick. Harry stared at his reflection in the mirror and solid black eyes stared back. He ran his fingers across his face and traced the sharp lines framed by black curls formed in perfect spirals. His muscles were solid like rock, but his skin was smooth and velvet soft. He pulled back his upper lip and touched his finger to the tip of a fang, it pierced the skin and a small drop of blood welled on his fingertip, the wound closed in an instant. He still looked like himself, but the perfection and paleness of the face in the mirror created an uncanny effect. It was obvious now, he wasn’t human anymore. Harry ripped his eyes away from his reflection and returned to bed.
"And when you drink from me?" Draco asked.
Harry couldn't watch any longer and he glanced across the windows searching for one last face. His heart finally broke into a million pieces when he saw his little sister, crying into her pillow. Ginny, Harry would miss the most of all. He tried to remember a time once when they were very small, thier mother had baked pumpkin scones, his favorite treat. He tried to sneak the last one and Percy caught him, saying the last treat should be for a real Weasley, pulling at Harry's curly black hair that stood out so sorely from the rest of his family's red heads. Harry had cried and cried, he knew he wasn’t
Draco smiled. “Yes, that never really goes away. I’ve been hungry for a very, very long time. Soon you will be able to be sated for a time, though.”
"To what do I owe this interruption?" Draco smiled at Harry as he tossed aside the journal in his hands.
He pressed Harry's hand against the thrumming pulse in his groin. "Here."
Harry admired Draco for a few silent moments. He'd never seen the vampire look quite so casual. He was dressed in dark grey wool slacks with a slim cut leg; a linen shirt with billowing sleeves and a wide, open neck was tucked loosely into his waistband. The clothes were a mixture of all the wrong times, and they fit Draco perfectly. Two strands of his silvery blonde hair hung down in front of his face, the rest was tied back at the base of his neck. Harry noticed that Draco wore most of his vampire features, but boasted his grey eyes, onyx orbs tucked away. Absentmindedly Draco reached up, brushing a strand of hair away from his face, behind his ear where Harry was shocked to see a single, silver earring. Harry found himself blushing, the blood he'd drank like wine reddened his cheeks and he quickly looked away.
Harry turned the book in his hands over gingerly, noticing how soft and worn leather was, how thin and fragile the pages were. "That one is the one I have been looking for." Draco told him.
Harry laid still for a moment, shocks of ecstasy reverberated through him. When Draco released his bite Harry turned to face him. Suddenly feeling bold, Harry rolled atop Draco, straddling his hips and staring down at him. Pitch eyes met and bored into one another. Harry reached out and brushed a strand of long silvery hair out of Draco's eyes, he could hear Draco's pulse quicken at the touch.
"Did you forget nearly draining me of blood in the tub just a few hours ago?"
"Are you hungry Harry?" Pansy asked. She led him to a corner where a young woman lay dazed on a burgundy chaise. "This one looks delicious.”
It was so long ago now, if the memories weren't crystal clear he could almost forget the feeling. Tomas made Draco drink from him for as long as his family served him, though the ancient vampire never drank from Draco. Their bond was one sided; Tomas could sense Draco's emotions and thoughts, he could even bend his will, but Draco felt nothing of Tomas, nothing but binding loyalty. It made defying him nearly impossible, it made running from him, hiding from him, even harder.
"What happened to them?" Harry asked, he seemed to be possessed by his own curiosity.
The pair finally pulled apart when Draco was approached by another old friend. Harry once again found himself standing awkwardly to the side of Draco's conversation when he felt a cold hand grasp his own. He turned to see Pansy standing beside him, gleaming up at him, her eyes playful.
Harry stifled a groan and rolled his eyes.
Harry took the garments into his hands. The fabric was decadently soft against his skin. He started to unbutton his night shirt but hesitated when he felt Draco’s eyes on him.
Draco bristled at Pansy's change in demeanor. "This is Harry, he is a very close companion of mine. I ask that you play nice."
Draco would be the last to deny he was materialistic, and for a moment he relished in the awe on Harry’s face. “It’s not much considering it took me four hundred years to collect,” Draco chuckled with faux humility.
He recalled his night with Pansy in the lounge in perfect detail. It had been magnificent, and Harry couldn't remember a time in his life when he'd felt so carefree, so fulfilled. He thought his memories of the lounge ought to be clouded with guilt, but they just made his mouth water. There was no shame left for him to feel now. He missed that too. Harry thought of the family he'd left behind and his heart ached with grief and rage, his feelings unbridled like never before. So this still remained, Harry thought. And just like everything else in his vampire body, these feeling were perfect, pure and raw. Harry felt as if they would break him in half.
“What are you?” Harry asked.
“My friend here is hungry, Lavender. Please feed him.” Draco told her softly.
"That's not possible, Harry." Draco replied. "I'm sorry."
Draco was lost in the past now, Harry could see his eyes flitting through the vivid memories. "We served Tomas for just twenty years before my family's demise. I failed him, and he tortured my parents for days to punish me before he finally killed them. I knew he would torture and kill me next but in the last moments I was able to somehow break free and I ran. I ran as fast and as far as I could. I hid from Tomas for a century."
A rare Draco POV
It had been months since he'd seen his own eyes in the mirror, he'd grown so used to seeing dark black voids. Still his eyes were different now, brighter and clearer, an unnatural emerald green. Everyone always told him his eyes were just like his mother's, his real mother's, but he couldn't remember her at all. When he imagined his mother's eyes they were pale blue framed by ginger. Harry stared at himself, unable to break away from his own gaze. He didn't understand how his eyes had changed, he was so bewildered he was speechless.
It seemed to take ages before the valet returned with a knock at the door. "Your bath is ready, sir."
"Fine." And in an instant the playful tone returned to her voice. "Come, lets dance. Bring your
Harry's gaze met the throbbing member sat between hummingbird pulses and his black eyes flashed. He released his bite and sent trailing licks and sloppy kisses toward the base of Draco's cock. He ran his tongue up the length and Draco's hips ratcheted up from the bed, a strangled moan could be heard when Harry's wet mouth wrapped itself around him. Harry swallowed his generous length effortlessly. Draco fingers found themselves wrapped tightly in Harry's dark curls, gently working his head up and down his length. Harry twirled his tongue around the velvet head of Draco's cock and hummed around his pale shaft. The vibrations sent Draco keeling. Harry pulled away with a wet pop, and wrapped his hand around Draco, staring at his black eyes as he worked him over the edge. Draco came with a gasp, his seed splashed onto Harry's hands and mixed with the blood that painted the inside of his thighs.
”And I will, but there are some things that cannot be taught, a fact you must accept if you wish to survive this new life.” Draco said sternly. “Now, if you are through acting like a child, it is nearly sunset and there’s somewhere I’d like us to be tonight.”
"Yes, that would be- um. Yes, please." Harry stumbled over his words. "Thank you."
"I do." Oliver answered.
In the center of the bathroom was a claw foot tub, large enough for four people to soak in comfortably. Draco dropped his robe and eased himself into the steaming water. Harry inhaled the scents of salts and oils that turned the water milky beneath the hot steam, they were warm and woody, it made Harry relax into a heavy calm. He stripped off his trousers and pants and followed Draco into the tub, sitting across from him and tangling their legs together.
Draco passed him the cup of hawthorn berry tea, the new one took it from his hands and sniffed it, then wrinkled his nose. “Drink,” Draco urged him.
"That's my home." He said. The familiar scent of the air around him assaulted his senses, the rushing water of the creek that split the land and the damp earth sent Harry back in time to frosted glass memories. The images were just out of arm's reach. It was his last day here, and he was crossing the creek and grudgingly heading into the forest after a fight with his brother, Ronald. They had been building another house on the property for Ronald and his new wife, Hermione, to make thier home. It was a stupid fight, Harry couldn't remember what it was even about. Maybe the timber he'd brought in that morning? It had just been weeks but the memory felt a century old. It seemed so strange he didn't know that would be the last time he left, never to return. Not really.
The room was still and quiet for a moment and Harry poured into Lavender’s eyes. He released all of the tension in his body and fed her soothing reassurance. The sensation visibly washed over Lavender, her shoulders fell, her clenched fists opened and her rapid breathing slowed.
”Take a seat, please.” She sat hesitantly and glanced at Harry, a glimmmer of apprehension in her eyes.
"No." Draco said. He lifted his hips just slightly from the bed and slipped his pants off with ease. His erection sprung free and laid heavily against his naked stomach.
At the top of the stairs Pansy broke the stony silence. "This is where the party really is, you won't find any stuffy socialites up here."
Like he did with all things, Draco took his time. Their lips passed across each other slowly, the tip of Draco's tongue danced softly over Harry's. Harry found himself melting into the embrace. His hand, still pressed beneath Draco's shirt snaked down the vampire's abdomen, exploring his strong, slender form. A purr came from Draco's chest and the kiss deepened, a new hunger ignited by Harry's touch. He held Harry against him tightly, their tongues tangled together wildly. Harry nipped at Draco's lip and his fangs pierced the soft, pink skin, drawing blood.
Harry had never seen the look that was on Draco's face now, it seemed vengeful, as if he was reliving the moment he drove that stake through Tomas's heart. Draco's eyes turned black and Harry could feel the centuries old rage burning off of him. His every muscle was tense and trembling, a low growl escaped from his throat. "Draco?" Harry spoke softly.
It was quiet and Draco rose to his feet, extending his hand to Harry. He took it in his, and stood with Draco, looking up into his black eyes as he tried to translate the look on his face. Draco seemed to compose himself and a small smile crossed his lips. "A story for another time, I think." His polite words came across slightly detached. "It's been a very long night." Silently the two entered the house where Draco parted from Harry and headed to his room alone, the air behind him oozed of the same discomforting raw emotion that wracked Harry.
"You look sinful." Draco mused. Harry's hair was mussed, the curls a wild tangle on his head. His fly was open, trousers and pants pulled down low around his hips. Blood ran from the corners of his mouth, and a bleeding crimson bite marked his neck. He was debauched. The blood between them was growing sticky as it dried and Harry longed for a hot bath.
“You were just born, new one. The hunger will ease, I promise, but you’re in a phase of transition and your body needs blood more now than it ever will again.”
If you are returning to this story please note that I’ve made an edit to a previous chapter and removed a kiss, so as of yet Harry and Draco have not kissed.
“You’ve just been born,” Draco replied. “Stay with me and I’ll teach you everything you need. You don’t have to be an animal Harry. Would you like that?”
Harry sucked in a deep breath, he could smell musty, wet earth and coppery blood all around him. The scents were so strong they seemed to be infused with the very cells that made his body. He held his breath for a moment and focused on what he could hear. The faint ticking of insect legs across a fallen log, damp leaves dropping onto the forest floor, wind ghosting through the trees. One sound in particular stopped his racing thoughts, a rapid thrumming that filled his ears. Harry listened intently before he realized the sound was coming from him, he placed a hand on his chest and felt his own heart beating like a hummingbird’s. He couldn’t understand what was happening to him. Harry then turned his attention to the way his body felt. His muscles were wound tight like loaded springs. He could feel the humidity in the air like raindrops, and his skin itched where the filtered sunlight touched it. He catalogued each new sensation as they came and then he felt it. Hunger like Harry had never felt in his life. Hunger that was knitted into his every fiber. Everything left him then. There was no more human thought or emotion, only hunger.
"That's alright." Harry said, not sure what else he could say, certainly not that he'd missed him.
Without warning, Draco sank his teeth into the mark on Harry's neck and he drank. Harry keened as pleasure collapsed on top of him, the sensation was almost crushing. The ache in Harry's loin grew more still and he whined. Draco seemed to read his mind and unbuttoned Harry's trousers, slipping his hand below his waistband without hesitation. Slender fingers wrapped around Harry's length, sat heavily in Draco's palm. Harry cried out as Draco's hand moved artfully. He arched his back and felt Draco's hardness pressing against him. The touch sent a thrill up his spine.
Draco smiled. "He's not one to mince words, is he? He's worked with me for a very long time. And his father before him. You trust your father, yes?"
“You don’t have to be afraid, Harry. It’s really quite wonderful, being a vampire.” Draco said. “Everything is heightened. Everything is better. Our senses are perfect, our bodies are strong and fast and protected from disease. Your life can be one of eternal pleasure if that is what you wish. That feeling you get, the thrill when you drink the blood, that can be how you feel always. I can show you.”
"Um- it's just, it's been days since you've come out..."
"Because I beat him, Harry. I won. I drove a stake into his heart and I buried his body intact, for him to starve and petrify in the ground. Death would have been a mercy that creature did not deserve." Draco began to recite another passsage from his journals, "
He'd thought of Tomas more in the last few weeks than he had in decades. Reminders of his first years as a vampire always ignited a spark under centuries old, unbridled rage. The feelings were as fresh as they day they happened, and Draco cursed his eternal memory. He felt his eyes shifting and growled. It was distasteful to lose control like this, he was not an animal. Draco held his breath and closed his eyes, he thought of Harry in the tub, electric green eyes winking at him. He exhaled when he felt his pupils swallow the darkness. Draco looked at his reflection in the window and was pleased when pale grey eyes looked back at him.
Harry laid mangled on the damp forest floor. His right arm was torn to shreds, his left leg broken with jagged bone protruding through his flesh. A gaping wound where his neck met his shoulder created a crimson pool beneath his head. But his injuries were nothing compared to the sensation that enveloped him. Fire. Liquid fire was coursing through his veins and the pain was all encompassing. He wanted to thrash against it, to scream until his throat ran dry, but he was paralyzed in agony. He wished for death to come quickly and end this suffering. He could feel his heart pounding in chest erratically, the rhythm grew more and more irregular with each passing minute. Finally his pulse weakened and slowed and he could feel himself slipping away.
Draco paused his words and looked at Harry, he was enraptured by his story so Draco continued on. "So we were turned, and my family joined the vampires. The one who turned us had many names in his life, he was older then than I am now. I knew him only as Tomas. He'd lived long enough to remember when vampires didn't have to hide and he longed for that time. He believed that humans were fodder for us, that it was foolish to ever allow ourselves to be driven to the shadows by them. He tried to create an army. Many old vampires joined his cause, and he turned the humans he deemed worthy, the ones who could aid him."
He gestured at the tacky scarlet blood that painted their bodies then untangled himself from Harry and climbed out of bed. He draped a silk robe over his shoulders and loosely tied it closed as he crossed the room to ring the sprung bell mounted next to his door. Just moments after he rang there was a knock on the door. Draco opened it to a valet on the other side.
"Anything you want, Harry." Draco stripped his riding clothes off and Harry did the same. There was a misty fog hanging low over the water, illuminated by the moonlight, their pale reflections were cast like statues in the water. Draco glanced over Harry's naked form in the silvery light, a perfect apparition, then he dove into the frigid water. He gasped at the cold and felt his nerves come alive, and Gods, he loved being a vampire. The water shifted next to him and he opened his eyes, Harry was beside him, his hair floating around his face like a dark halo.
“More?” The new one asked, he looked startled by the sound of his own voice.
Lost moments melted in and out of his consciousness. Daphne's lips colliding with his. Wet bodies touching. Mud caked under his fingernails. Cornflower blonde hair, knotted in his hands. The sound of panting beneath him. A hot coil in his abdomen, released with a husky groan. Dressing in a hurry, and running home. Shame. Days spent avoiding her around every turn. Shame. Girls giggling and gossiping when he passed. Shame. Daphne throwing horse shit at him in the middle of the market. Shame.
"Harry," Draco whispered to him. "It's time for us to take our leave."
"You never let me have any fun." Pansy pouted.
In an instant Draco's demeanor changed as he was transported back into the present. He blinked and his eyes were silver. "My apologies. I don't revisit those memories often, I seem to find myself lost in them."
Silently the two approached the house in the darkness, Draco gestured to a tree that grew beside the house, nearly as tall as the tower of additions to the cottage that had been built over generations. They climbed the tree with grace and ease, and sat perfectly still, hidden in the thick leaves. Harry could see right into the windows of his house, there were lit candles in nearly every room, and a fire was burning in the fireplace. He breathed in the scent of smoke billowing from the stone chimney.
A few moments later a human girl entered the room. She had olive skin and dark, chestnut colored hair, curled in spirals and pinned behind her head. Lavender wore a a pale green dress adorned in white bows and delicate lace, the tightly laced bodice narrowed her waist and pushed her breasts high into two soft curves. She was a pretty girl, but there was nothing more enticing about her than the smell of blood pulsing in her veins. Harry growled lowly at the stench that drove him so mad and prepared to lunge at her when Draco stopped him with an outstretched hand. Draco stared into Lavender’s eyes with his black ones and her eyes glazed.
Harry closed his eyes and tilted his head back to dip his curls in the water. He let the warmth wrap around him while he mulled over Draco's words. He searched for the tie between them, reaching for the subtle notes of Draco's emotion. It was muted but it was there, and he felt the tie hungering for Draco's blood. Harry sat up and scooted himself across the tub, reaching for Draco's wrist. Blackness engulfed both of their eyes and when Draco nodded Harry sank his fangs into silky, alabaster flesh. Draco's blood spilled in Harry's mouth and the tie between them burned.
“I’ve seen it all before, Harry,” Draco reminded him, and Harry shamefully recalled his stark nakedness when he woke in Draco’s guest chambers that first night.
"I'm hungry, Draco." Harry mumbled into Draco's skin.
"Of course, sir." The valet nodded and pulled the door closed as he left. After that followed the sounds of servants flitting up and down the servants stairs, in and out of the bathroom through a door in the hall. Draco came back to bed and Harry laid across his lap, listening to the hustle and bustle of the staff filling the tub in the en suite bathroom.
Behind him Harry finally stirred and Draco was shocked to find he was relieved, he was growing anxious with just his memories to keep him company. Harry reached across the bed with a sleepy sound and Draco crossed the room to meet him. Harry pressed his face into Draco's chest as he laid down and inhaled his scent.
Harry quickly pulled on his new clothes, and stepped in front of a tall standing mirror. His black trousers were slim in the leg and fit him perfectly, the white button shirt was crisp and precisely pressed. Over his shirt he wore a dark crimson vest, embroidered with black design. Finally, he wore a black single-breasted dinner jacket. Harry was shocked at the man before him the mirror. His sharp yet androgynous vampire features were made more masculine by the cut and style of his garb, and his pale face was frame beautifully by his black curls and black jacket. He turned to Draco to find him beaming.
The door opened slowly, cautiously. Draco glanced up and inhaled sharply, his eyes darkened for an imperceptible second. A young man, maybe twenty years old, stood in his door. He was tall and lanky, but his build was strong. Draco recognized him as Oliver Wood. His gardener's son. His family had been working for Draco since he'd built this manor over a century ago. They had never wanted for anything since then, and they were completely faithful to Draco. Oliver had just started working for him, he'd recently married and his wife was expecting from what Draco heard. Draco had always paid for Oliver's comfortable way of life, but he was an adult now. Draco's generosity was not endless and Oliver would have to work too if he wanted his own family lavished in wealth.
Draco Malfoy scowled at the letter in his hand and tossed it onto the table beside him with a sigh. He’d heard rumors over the last few nights of animal attacks at the nearby farms and was suspicious of the predator that was terrorizing the area. At first he believed it could be a wolf gone rabid or something of the sort, but the missive delivered to him this morning proved that to be false. An entire village was slaughtered in the night, just twenty kilometers outside of London. This was the work of another vampire, of that Draco was certain, and it was nearing closer to him and his home every night. This vampire must be newly turned, he thought, no one else would be so obvious in their killing.
Blood pooled in Harry’s mouth and it was the most decadent thing he’d ever eaten.  Lavender was sweet and tart, she tasted like oranges in the summertime. Harry breathed in the scent on her skin just the same  as he drank from her neck; he sighed in contentment, and Lavender sighed too. As he drank, Harry listened to the thumping of her heart, when it began to slow he pulled away, licking his lips. He then drew Lavender to his chest, and closed the wound at her throat with a pass of his tongue, all the while soaking in her summery scent.
Draco snorted. "Surely there are some snacks wandering around that you can toy with."
Draco's face lit up at the sight of her, a glowing smile spread across his face.
"Draco! You came!" The woman crossed the room in a flash and pulled Draco into a familiar hug. "It's been too long, dear friend."
Shallow pants left Harry's lungs as Draco worked his member, his jaws still locked tight around Harry's neck. Harry felt himself fall over the cliff before he realized it was even there, and his climax hit him like he was crashing into stone. His muscles coiled and he spilled over Draco's hand. Draco made an approving sound. He seemed to be as lost in Harry's blood as Harry was in his touch.
"Send up a snack, please." Draco requested through the closed door. "Not, Lavender." He added, somewhat coldly. Draco was growing tired of her citrus flavor, he found it didn't complement the chill in the autumn air.
A few minutes later the human returned, this time carrying a silver tray, atop it were four crystal glasses, each one brimming with blood. Harry took the tray from his grasp and guzzled down the first glass, he hardly even noticed when the groundskeeper scurried out the front door. The blood sated his hunger well, but still he was discontent. With freshly-fed clarity he realized that he was lonely, that he was missing Draco.
“Oh, and Harry, if you kill any of my staff I won’t hesitate to drive a stake through your heart and chop off your head. Be a good boy.” The bedroom door slammed shut and Harry was left alone with his hunger once again.
The door of the tavern swung open with a creak and Draco cringed at the sound, sure the new one would be alerted of his presence here. But the new one was occupied, he was drinking from one human and held another by his throat, he didn’t even look up at the source of the sound. Draco took in the scene, ten bodies were torn apart and strewn across the tavern, the two in the new one’s arms were the last alive. Draco scowled at the mess he would have to clean up and he turned his attention back to the new one, drawing a wooden stake from inside his cloak. The new one finished off the first human he held and dropped his lifeless body, and he started in on the next one, draining him faster than Draco had ever seen. He had to act while the new one was still distracted so he launched the wooden stake at the new one. The stake flew through the air and pierced his heart in the center of his chest.
"Reminiscing, I suppose." Draco sighed and gestured to the pile of journals beneath him. He picked one up and tossed it to Harry, who caught it before he realized it was even in the air. Harry thumbed open the pages, the writing was a thin, loopy scrawl and he couldn't understand a single word. He ducked his head, embarrassed.
"What happened to him? Why didn't you have to keep hiding?"
“How are you feeling?” Draco asked him.
"Remove your shirt." Draco said to Oliver, he hesitated. Draco let his eyes darken and stared at Oliver, then repeated himself with honeyed words. "
Sheepishly, Harry undressed, avoiding Draco’s eyes as he did. When Harry dropped his trousers and kicked them aside Draco gripped his shoulders and took him in one time, up and down. “You really are quite stunning, Harry. Now, get dressed.”
Draco sat up against the headboard and Harry laid beside him, resting his head on Draco's hip.
There was a second when Harry stilled and stiffened, taken aback by the unexpected kiss, but as quickly as the hesitation came it went and Harry eased into Draco's touch. He parted his lips, eagerly welcoming the slip of Draco's tongue. Draco's hand slipped around the nape Harry's neck, holding them together with gentle firmness.
Draco carded his fingers through Harry's messy hair, "I could go for a soak, I think."
The new one’s features were pure vampire, he didn’t yet know how to shift his face into something more human. His nose and jaw were angular and the voids of his black eyes were framed with sharp, high cheekbones. The perfect Cupid’s bow of his upper lip was stretched, his lips pulled back to reveal needle sharp canines. The muscles in the new one’s body rippled with tension. He crouched on the bed, resting his weight on the balls of his feet and cocked his head to the side as he stared at Draco with both curiosity and confusion.
"A vampire's blood is a very powerful thing, Harry." Draco explained. "A tie, like you said, is formed when we share our blood. It will fade in time if the bond isn't fed, but if it is the tie will turn to steel."
He approached the two, nestled together in the corner, and with measured caution placed a hand on Harry’s shoulder. Harry looked up at him, his black eyes were blissful. Draco pressed a hand against Harry’s face, and murmured to him, “who knew you could be so impressive?” Harry’s cheeks flushed pink with Lavender’s blood and he stood to meet Draco’s gaze.
”Enough.” Draco interrupted with a coy smile. “It is a surprise, one I’m quite sure you’ll enjoy. Don’t you trust me, Harry.”
Harry hummed an affirtive sound in response and Pansy rolled her eyes, clearly even more bored by Harry than she was mingling downstairs. She dragged Harry through the hallway, passing a dozen bedrooms with their doors open wide. Harry was shocked to see inside each one, naked vampires were tangled in the sheets, shamelessly exploring each other behind open doors. Pansy giggled at the slack jawed look on Harry's face, his discomfort providing her much desired entertainment. She stopped at the only closed door in the hallway, swinging it open unceremoniously, revealing a dimly lit lounge.
The next hours passed slowly as Harry and Draco waited for nightfall. Harry paced and explored the manor, trying to distract himself, but still the minutes moved like molasses. Finally, sunset came and went and he and Draco ventured together into the twilight. Harry had made the trip from his small village to London just once, when his two oldest brothers left the farm to go work in the city. It had taken them half a day then, and it had seemed like forever. But tonight the two vampires made the trip on foot in just a few hours, blurring through the country side and forests. Harry halted to a stop at the edge of a thick wood, and pointed to the ramshackle cottage on a hill above the fields.
A possessive knot formed in Draco's chest as he took in Harry's perfect body, weightlessly moving in the water. He swam closer to the vampire and tangled his limbs in Harry's, locking their lips together as they floated in the depths of that icy, crystal pool. He felt the tie between them tighten and his mouth watered when he thought of Harry's blood. He couldn't help it this time when his eyes turned black. He knew he was doomed by Harry, that he could not deny him. He would find himself one day with their souls ensnared together. He feared it and yearned for it all the same.
His stone face showed no emotion when he turned to Draco, and his voice was cutting like glass when he spoke. "We should leave. Now."
Draco rose from his spot and crossed the room to Harry, who had taken a seat on the edge of his bed. He sat beside him and took Harry's hands, planting a kiss on each palm. "I've missed you." He murmured at him.
Draco paused and contemplated, then started again. "Tell me, Harry. How does it feel when you drink from a human?"
Harry circled the room and stopped to admire all of the beautiful things that caught his eye. After a few minutes Draco cleared his throat. “Harry, dear. You quite literally have all of the time in the world to look through my things, but right now we have somewhere to be.”
“Hungry,” Harry growled.
The new one cocked his head again at Draco’s words. The mention of blood had his interest. Draco watched him swallow the rest of the tea in a single gulp, then he stared back at Draco, licking his lips at the promise of blood. Draco went to get a glass of blood from the hall and returned before the new one had time to run. He handed him the glass and the vampire sucked it down greedily.
Harry scoffed. "Secrecy? Where was the concern for secrecy when Pansy held a party of fifty vampires staffed by human attendants? And what about you, Draco! Everyone who works in this house is human. You told me yourself."
Harry wondered if he could reach the door before Draco. Lavender’s blood had woken his hunger more still than before and he wanted seconds. And thirds. Draco’s staff would surely be easy to pick off and devour if he could get past the vampire. Draco seemed to be reading his thoughts, though.
"Please, Draco. They'll never tell, I promise." Harry begged him. "Please let me see them. Just once more?"
“Same as you are now, Harry,” Draco paused as he met Harry’s eyes with his own. “Vampire.”
Harry’s face lit up at the prospect of leaving the house for the first time. “Where are we going? Will there be other vampires? Will there be humans to drink from? Can we-“
"We won't stop looking." Fred said, and George nodded.
"We're nearly there, just a few more minutes. I swear it." Draco said as he took Harry's hands into his own.
“Hawthorn berries.” Draco explained, “The tree is poisonous to us. The tea won’t hurt you though, just weaken you a bit so you can be subdued if need be. Finish the tea and you can have some blood”
Draco paused as he mulled over his thoughts. He seemed to do that a lot, Harry noticed. He was never in a hurry.
Despite the blackness, Draco could see Harry roll his eyes at him. Harry traced his fingers over the pulse in Oliver's neck and he flinched, Harry's smile flashed needle sharp fangs.
"Look," Draco gestured at the large ornamental golden mirror that hung on the far wall of the room. Harry turned around and peered at his reflection. He too gasped when he met his own his eyes and vibrant green orbs stared back at him.
Emotion boiled inside of Harry and he feared his grief and sadness and anger would turn him rabid. He didn't wait for Draco as he dropped from his branch and fled for the woods. They raced back to the manor, faster even than they had the way there as Harry tried to outrun his feelings. He finally collapsed in sorrow on the front lawn, overcome by the perfect, painful new memories he'd painted in his mind.
Want more from Draco? Pls enjoy 😊
With a small smirk Draco met Harry's eyes once more before he opened the doors. Harry gasped. Behind them was a grand ballroom, massive and round, with windows that stretched ceiling to parquet floor. Atop the gleaming golden starburst laid in the flooring was a party, the most extravagant party Harry had ever seen. Vampires filled the room, dancing and laughing, their clear voices carrying across the room like a symphony. Harry was frozen in the doorway, there were dozens of party goers and he was suddenly overwhelmed by the crowd of living statues. Draco's grip on Harry's hand tightened and he led him into the room. Harry followed with measured footsteps, eyes flitting from face to perfect face. Some of the vampires wore their human masks, but many boasted black eyes and crystal-cut faces. Every one of them was dressed in luxurious fabrics and glittering jewels; Harry noticed that their styles ranged from new to old, but all of them looked flawless, even in fashion dated a century.
“There are others here?” Harry asked with excitement as he thought of all the blood.
Harry mapped the lines of muscle chiseled into Draco's chest with feather light touches. He traced Draco's form with black eyes, stopping just where his cotton drawers began. He didn't allow himself to imagine what was hidden beneath the soft fabric. A foggy memory came to him like an apparition. He was sixteen and he was walking with a girl from his village home from the market in the small neighboring town.
Even from outside he could hear thier voices perfectly. And thier beating hearts. Harry drove that thought from his mind when he spotted his mother sitting at the kitchen table, her head in her hands. Her long red hair fell around her face. Beside her sat his father with his arm wrapped around her shaking shoulders. Harry's heart ached when he realized she was crying. Was she crying for him? Raised voices in the living room piqued Harry's interest, and his eyes flitted to another window. All of his brothers were gathered together, even Bill and Charlie had come back from London.
”Can you smell that, Harry?” Draco asked. “She’s afraid. They taste off when they’re afraid. But, humans are so easily...manipulated. Look into her eyes and tell her she has nothing to fear, make her feel it, Harry.”
Harry gasped and pulled away from the kiss. His lips were smeared red with Draco's blood, he swept his tongue across them and savored the taste. Draco stared at the sight before him and his eyes blackened, he drew his wrist to his mouth and sank his teeth in, opening the pulsing vessels.
"The same but tenfold, like lightning striking a tree. And after the tie lingers. Even now I can feel you."
"I want to see my family." Harry said.
Harry pulled his hand away from the light once more and shuddered as he watched the embers cool and turn back to velvet stone. He tried to remember what the sun had felt like before, that warm and comforting glow, but the feeling was so muted by the memory of human senses, his mind reached for the ghost of a feeling and was left with empty hands. He wished he could remember his family with vampire clarity, he felt haunted by them too.
Harry and Draco crossed through the foyer, Harry tried to stop and admire the art that decorated the loomingly tall walls but Draco pulled him along by the hand, his grip firm and steady. Draco stopped before a set of solid wooden doors and drank in Harry once, up and down.
"It won't hurt much, I swear it" Draco could hear Harry whisper into Oliver's ear before he bit into his neck. Oliver's entire body tensed at the shock of the bite, Harry wrinkled his nose at the taste at first. Oliver was still scared. In an instant though his tension eased, Draco could see that Harry was connected with him, that he was molding his emotions like clay. A soft moan escaped Oliver's throat and Harry purred when the flavor of his blood brightened, the fear leaving him.
________________________________________________________________________________________________
As Draco made to do exactly that, he realized with a jolt he was actually closer to Potter now as the line had moved up considerably from moments before. ‘No matter, I can still get out of here unnoticed, surely.’ Yet, Draco should’ve realized it wouldn’t be that easy- things involving “The Boy who Lived” never were. For the first time since stepping into the shop Draco finally realized just what that line was for. Because, in what appeared to be two swift steps, Gilderoy Lockhart himself strode up to Harry Potter and pushed him up to the front of the line, exclaiming that Potter was the lucky recipient of Lockhart’s generosity. And, as much as Draco wanted to look away, he couldn’t.
Draco didn’t give him time to finish, “I’m not. I’m sure you saw her already- Potter and his gang reported it, right? And...and… she was there, in water. There was a message behind her!”
He found the Weaslette’s compartment easily. And things were going perfectly fine until he stepped into the compartment; Potters name on his tongue. What stripped him of his words was the compartment’s inhabitants. Or, rather, the lack of inhabitants.
“No Fred. The Slytherins didn’t do anything at all. They were just defending one of their own,” she said calmly. Fred nodded at her before turning to Mclaggen and glaring at him.
Draco nodded warily. He trusted his father, and if he said the Dark Lord would return...then he would. The thought of becoming a Deatheater sounded terrifying, and Draco didn’t think he could kill anyone. Not even a Mudblood- not when he might know them. And if he had to fight against Potter, well, he wanted to win. But did he want him dead?
He took a deep breath, then he spoke,” Headmaster Dumbledore, I’m the one responsible for Daphne Greengrass’s murder.”
Of course, life wouldn’t be that nice to Draco- he had to have a complicated day after all. So it was no wonder that Draco was detesting potions that morning, because he'd have to deal with Potter, the other lousy Gryffindors, and his watchful godfather.
As expected, the school owl had his school supplies letter, which Draco had eagerly opened before running to his parents with the news. The prospect of the trip with his father had only seemed closer then, and Draco was too excited to think of much else for the rest of the following weeks. Now, as he and his father stood in the entryway to Knockturn Alley, Draco was feeling a bit off.
It had been two weeks since that incident. Draco had reluctantly confessed his worries to the only person he could- Tom Riddle. Riddle dismissed it, telling him that school was just getting to him. Draco numbly accepted it.
‘It’s done. I did it,’ Draco thought. His shoulders slumped down in relaxation. He didn’t feel that heavy pressure of the diary, or his father’s command, anymore. He had succeeded. And now, he just had a welcoming feast to attend, and to enjoy.
Draco stormed down the train and to the changing compartments before briskly opening one and sliding in. After locking the door, Draco unwrapped his neatly folded robes. He hesitated before gently picking up the diary and putting it off to the side. That book had given him enough trouble already, and he’d be glad to get rid of it.
As he turned back to his mother he put on a false smile, letting his shoulders relax and seeming relieved. Narcissa’s brows scrunched together in concern before she pursed her lips together and exhaled. “Right, well. Now that that’s settled have Dobby put these dusty books away. Surely you have some schoolwork to complete?” Narcissa said, a false cheerfulness in her voice.
When they stepped into the hut Riddle gestured for Draco to have a seat on the black bed. Everything here seemed to lack color except for Draco and Riddle, and the objects were simply defined by depth and shading. It was like being in a strange monochromatic portrait.
Arthur looked on coldly. “Lucius,” he nodded. Draco stared at the interaction in disbelief, he had known his father didn’t care for the Weasleys, but he didn’t know the feelings of mutual hatred were this strong.
Fred looked surprised, but nodded back at her. “Sorry for my housemate’s idiocy,” he said with a small smile. Ginevra Weasley just looked back at the group of green clad students and offered a small, but warm, smile of her own.
Draco's eyes widened and his lips curved upwards in delight; he hadn’t been to Knockturn alley before, only peered into the alley from the street that adjoined Diagon. His mother never let him down there, no matter how much he’d pleaded.
Draco didn't want to know what Tom Riddle was implying. But he did have an idea of what he’d be getting into when he started this. And unless he wanted to disappoint his father and displease the Dark Lord...he had no choice but to do as Riddle said.
Huffing in irritation Draco took out his wand and cast a glamour over his face; it wouldn’t last long, but it would cover the bags under his eyes. As he tucked his wand into one of his robe’s pockets, he felt a momentary second of...hesitation? He supposed he shouldn’t feel right in giving the book off to someone else in the first place- especially after he knew what the thing had done to him first hand. But that wasn’t what made him feel hesitant. Weasley deserved to suffer after taking away Draco’s chance at friendship with Potter. And the best way to hurt him would be to hurt his family.
Draco cut her off, “Won’t be able to receive a high enough mark to make up for the bad one. I get it. But Vincent usually works with Gregory so I don’t see why you’re so worried.”
When his bedroom door closed Draco stared at the diary intently. He reached over to it and tentatively picked it up. It felt...encased in magic. Dark magic that wanted to get out. Draco felt slightly nauseous as he felt the magic squirm under his hands. The thing felt alive.
The scene before him was too ludicrous. Potter looked highly uncomfortable with the whole thing; which did surprise Draco as he figured Potter would’ve loved being in the spotlight like that. ‘Maybe because he has to share?’ Draco speculated. Though, Draco considered, he would probably be most uncomfortable with being that close to Lockhart too. ‘I guess Potter and I have something in common.’ Draco softy laughed at that notion.
The next day Draco decided to study in the library. He didn’t want to be interrogated again, and he really did need to finish his reading. And he was uninterrupted for quite some time, but then a finger tapped in the center of his book, grabbing his attention. When he looked up, he found Daphne Greengrass hovering above him.
Draco did suppose he’d miss the library when he got back to Hogwarts. The Hogwarts library was almost always occupied, and all the interesting books were hidden away in the restricted section. Well, the astronomy tower is usually empty, and it has a nice enough view. I should be able to get some peace there.
‘I’m quite curious to see how Hogwarts has changed since my time. Let’s start there- with your time at school.’
Narcissa’s brows furrowed, but eventually she relented. As soon as she looked back at her son, his pleading expression still in place, Lucius knew he had won. Narcissa sighed, “All right, but no secondary trips as you promised. Borgin and Burkes is usually pretty empty around this time of year, so I doubt you’ll run into any trouble.”
“I wasn’t aware this was a formal conversation Draco. I believed we were talking godfather to godson,” Snape said, raising an eyebrow at the blond.
Dumbledore nodded encouragingly; he knew Draco understood now. Regretfully, Draco did. There was a mountain of evidence, and it all proved that he hadn't done anything to Daphne.
“Mr. Malfoy, stay back,” Snape’s cutting voice stopped Draco in his tracks. Potions was over, and Draco had been hoping to avoid the professor for a little longer by sneaking out of the class amidst the other Slytherins. ‘Damn Snape and his observational skills. The man’s far too astute sometimes.’
A cold breeze seemed to drift around the Slytherin dorm room. The chill was strong; and even though the fire blazed warmly Draco couldn’t seem to escape the cold. He stared down at his hands and saw them slightly shaking. At least the cold gave him an excuse for the small tremors.
Arthur’s face tightened for a second, before he opened his mouth to no doubt throw a biting insult back. He never got the chance to do so though, because at that moment two things happened in quick succession.
“I’m glad you are so passionate about this. It shows how much you care for your future, and your father,” Severus added that last part as an afterthought. He’d clearly assumed his father’s research was something pureblood related.
Lucius nodded swiftly at his son and narrowed his eyes a fraction before striding towards the manors gate. “Do control that habit, it will only cause you more trouble in the future. And Draco?” Lucius stopped and turned his head around to look at his son. “Remember your title, and remember what that means.”
Draco sighed and started making his way toward the Slytherin common room when he saw someone.
Harry was glad he could no longer smell the intoxicating aroma, and was even more relieved when the bell rang.
He stomped into the changing rooms and started to pull on his quidditch robes. He dressed rather clumsily, his mind elsewhere...
The bed next to him squeaked. He looked over as he saw a blurry Ron hopping off his bed, which was really weird, considering that Ron was NOT a morning person. Harry felt around for his glasses on the bedside table to his left and grasped them, placing them on his face.
She scanned the Ravenclaw table and found Iris sitting next to a blonde who was chattering profusely at her. Pansy caught Iris’s eye and she said something to the blonde, stood up, and walked over.
“Why are you staring at them Pansy?” Draco said, smirking.
Hermione flipped it over. “It’s addressed to me from Iris!” She unfolded the letter and read aloud, “I convinced Pansy and Draco to come with me to the library to study! You three should meet us there!”
Draco pulled Harry close and kissed him. It was soft and slow, sweet and full of emotion. It somehow meant so much more than their other kisses; they somehow conveyed a million words with one beautiful kiss.
They ignored her scolding, as usual, and began to pile their plates high with food.
"Oh Draco, I'm sorry." She said, trying to calm her face. "But, like, oh my god! Harry Potter! You!" She burst into another fit of giggles.
Harry did not want to play against Malfoy, and he certainly did not want to accidentally get lost in those eyes... those liquid silver, shining eyes, those eyes with so much depth, those eyes that had hints of blue and green when in direct sunlight... he quite literally smacked himself in the face.
"Erm..." Harry said, slightly embarrassed by his mess and fashion choices. "Yeah?"
Draco watched as Harry broke the petals in fourths (to release their aroma and properly infuse the potion) and held out his hand for them.
“You’re right. I’m sorry. But you do need to go down to breakfast.”
Harry was shaken awake that morning. Quite forcefully, Harry might add. "Wha-who-what?" Harry said, surprised to see his favorite bushy haired friend standing over him.
She gave him a knowing look. “Please, let me help you with your... essay.” She winked.
“I, unlike Potter, do not faint at every slight mishap. Malfoys don’t faint-I mean-I don’t faint. It’s unbecoming of someone like me.”
He came out into the common room and was greeted by clapping from Hermione and joking wolf-whistles from Ron.
Draco looked up from his potion book, and glanced at the ingredients Harry had brought over.
Pansy smirked and said, "Just alright, huh." Then an idea seemed to have sparked in her head. "You know what? I'm going to go talk to them. We are all going to be great friends."
His hair was as messy as always, and his shirt was very unprofessionally untucked. Some old part of him wanted to make fun of him about it, but this uncovered part of him couldn’t help finding it just... 𝑎𝑑𝑜𝑟𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒. And he couldn’t stop his eyes from raking down his body to his legs, which surprised him by being strong and sculpted underneath a pair of tighter than usual jeans.
He glanced up at Harry, who was smiling too. He looked around the room, but it seemed like they were the only ones with spiraled smoke coming out of their cauldron.
Draco was practically skipping down to the dungeons when Pansy caught up with him. He stopped walking so giddily at once and cleared his throat.
Often to find silver eyes already looking in his direction.
She winked and said “Go on without me, I’ll catch up.” And started talking with Professor Vector.
“Err-yah. I’m fine I guess?” Harry said, his eyes narrowing in suspicion.
Pansy skipped down the corridor, giddy that Draco had found his man. She very well knew that it was after curfew, but she didn't care. She started to whistle a tune of a song that was in her head, but that she couldn't quite place.
“Sure, why not?”
“Erm, hello Pansy.” Draco said in a voice that was huskier than normal, and that Pansy desperately wished she could unhear.
He rolled his eyes at her but put the apple on a plate, grabbed a bowl, scooped it full of porridge, cast a spell to cut the apple into thin slices, and placed them on the porridge.
“Race ya to the Great Hall!” Ron shouted.
Her friend Penny was sitting next to her on the couch, and she looked up from her own book at Iris in annoyance. “Stop making that sound! I’m trying to read! It’s the climax of the book!” Then she scanned Iris’s expression, and the irritation faded from her face. “What’s wrong?”
“Oh Draco! You don’t need to feel bad about it!
He mumbled the password to the Painted Lady. (𝐬𝗼𝐫𝐫𝐲 𝐈 𝐣𝐮𝐬𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐤 𝐢𝐭'𝐬 𝐫𝐮𝐝𝐞 𝐭𝗼 𝐜𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐡𝐞𝐫 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐅𝐚𝐭 𝐋𝐚𝐝𝐲) She glanced at him knowingly as he stumbled inside.
“Yeah, I guess. Sorry about—before.”
“Well this isn’t school grounds, is it?”
Hermione, upon seeing his poor excuse for a knot, sniffed and went over to re-tie it. Once she decided it was acceptable, she clapped her hands and smiled brightly. “Shall we?”
They exited the castle, Harry wiping his sweaty palms on his jeans. They walked with long strides down the hill, and apparated to the Three Broomsticks once they were outside of the Hogwarts boundaries.
They smiled.
ℙ𝕒𝕟𝕤𝕪 ℙ𝕆𝕍
He practically ran back towards the shelves, embarrassed by himself. What was he thinking!? Apologizing to Malfoy? Ugh. He wished he could facepalm without being too obvious. He grabbed a few rose petals and stems and headed back toward the table.
"Pansy actually. She's not the absolute worst it turns out." Ron said, going over to his trunk and kneeling down by it.
Harry was shocked! DRACO FREAKING MALFOY was KISSING HIM! He was stunned, and just stood there, his eyes wide open in shock.
"What! No! I can just wear my robes!"
“We have Charms first, and Flitwick’s classroom is just across the hall.” Hermione said.
“And I don’t believe we’ve met!” Dean said good-naturedly to Iris.
He gasped exaggeratedly, and dived in the opposite direction. Malfoy saw and sped after him. He pulled out of it, and smirked when he saw that the snitch has disappeared again.
The friends go to the library and snuggle
He also wanted to feel the warm sun on his pale skin this morning, so he grabbed a green apple, like always, and set out toward the lake with Pansy.
Iris.
“Oh Draco, you’ve fallen for him. Hard.” She said, a playful smile tugging at her lips.
She draped them almost lovingly across the back of a chair. Then she opened a drawer underneath the hanging space and selected a pair of black skinny jeans.
Hermione raised an eyebrow and glared at him suspiciously. “You are not getting out of this Harry. You ARE telling us after dinner.” She stated sternly, stabbing a green bean with her fork.
She gave him an odd look and continued blabbering on about something he just couldn’t focus on.
Draco was thinking similar thoughts, how this was the first time he had really seen Potter decently groomed since sixth year!
Draco took notes diligently, and read his chapters quickly, eyes flicking about the page, but Harry only took minimal notes and seemed to zone out several times while looking at his textbook.
“DRACO!” Pansy burst out. This earned glances from the Ravenclaws. She lowered her voice down so only their table could hear. “I’m gay!”
He looked at her, the best (female) friend he’d had for so many years. The one he could always rely on. He decided to tell her.
“Well it’s just my parents. I’m sure a lot of owls will be going home tonight with news, and word will travel. My mom is a hopeless gossip; she will no doubt ask all the other parents if I made any progress with Draco, and when she hears—I don’t know. It’s fine. I’m an adult anyway, I can just move out.”
"You really need to clean out your trunk, Harry. And you have nothing to wear! Except this gray t-shirt and old pair of jeans... now that I think about it Harry, is that all you have ever worn besides school robes?"
It was a group of three seventh year Ravenclaws that Pansy recognized. Two boys she didn’t know the names of, and one girl that she did.
“Amortentia!? That’s preposterous! Absurd!” She exclaimed, incredulous.
“Captains shake hands.” Madam Hooch boomed. “Mount your brooms. On my whistle, three... two... one...” her whistle sounded, loud and clear.
That evening, Draco skipped dinner, unable to look at Potter after what had happened in potions today.
Ginny was giving them all a pep talk, as usual, and she was much better at it than Harry ever was.
He urged his broom back closer to the pitch, and started looking around for the snitch.
They found a nice tree and sat under it, relaxing on the cool grass. Hermione brought some books out, as nothing was better than getting lost in a book. (To her anyway.) Ron had brought some sweets that seemed to always occupy the pockets of his robes and a pocket chess set. Harry didn’t bring anything, but was holding the fruit for all of them.
Ron plopped down on a loveseat and slammed his bag on the table, yanking out individual sheets of wrinkled parchment and his school books like they have wronged him.
Draco swore, his eyes darting around the corridor, and was relieved to see no one there.
Penny sat back down on the couch and took the bookmark out of her book, her right thumb finding her way to her mouth to tap against her two front teeth as her eyes flicked across the page, a habit she had when she was focused.
“Draco?” A feminine voice asked—Pansy. “I’m worried about you, are you alright?”
Oh. OH! Oh no.
She hopped up the stairs two at a time, almost falling for the trick step but catching herself just in time.
Pansy just mumbled something he couldn’t hear and rubbed her thumb on the rim of her bottle.
“Um, sure?” Harry responded.
Just a few minutes until they would be on brooms, competing to be the first to grasp a tiny golden ball.
Holy Merlin. Oh gosh. Oh no. No no no. His cheeks ignited, and he glanced at Draco, who was also flushed.
They were touching everywhere from their shoulders to their hips, where Draco’s legs angled away so he could cross them. Harry felt flustered that they were so close so naturally, that is was completely normal for them to touch like friends, like lovers. After a few seconds though, he got over the shock of the realization and relaxed, and began to feel warm and fuzzy. He snuggled closer, and Draco let out a small smile.
“Are you alright?” Draco asked, and flinched. “I mean... stop being such a clumsy git! I don’t want your blood messing up our potion.” But he flinched again, the insult sounding forced even to Harry.
Harry tuned the commentary out with a chuckle. He scanned the field. He saw a glint of gold! But it’s all the way at the other end of the pitch. And about three feet in front of it, was Malfoy.
“Yeah. Beautiful.” But really the most beautiful thing was the person next to him, Harry thought, staring into his eyes.
Draco stopped and turned around. “Po-Harry, would you like me to walk you to your common room?”
“Really Ron? You haven’t noticed? It’s obviously a boy.” She said matter-of-factly.
“Oh! Iris really!? I would love to!” Pansy said, beaming.
Then Draco 𝑆𝑀𝐼𝐿𝐸𝐷. His face transformed into something so happy and perfect, his straight and brilliantly white teeth shining, outlined by the soft pink lips that occupied many a dream of Harry’s.
The couples found spots spread out on the grass, facing the lake and the stunning sunset.
The common room was full of people playing exploding snap, laughing, and generally making a ruckus so they headed up to the boys’ dormitories.
He in fact spotted the Golden Boy in the spot where he had wanted to sit.
He looked up and smiled at her. “Thanks Mione!”
“I couldn’t see.” Draco said. “He blushed when we made eye contact after we smelled it, but I don’t know what that means exactly, maybe there’s someone—“
She, Iris, and Draco went to browse the bookshelves, as they had already done their homework.
“I guess so!” Draco laughed, but then his face turned solemn. “I’m sorry I had to say all of that stuff, Harry.”
A giant, jolly laugh erupted from the end of the staff table, dishes shaking as Hagrid slammed his dustbin-sized hand into the table as he wheezed. “Ya owe me three galleons, Horace!” He shouted down the table at Slughorn.
A smile found its way onto his face as he said, "Thanks Pans. How are you so good at that?" He said with a chuckle.
Ron looked at him like he had gone mad, but went back to looking at his textbook.
Harry glared at him and stomped over, Draco striding over to meet him in the middle. “I can fight my own battles!” Harry spat, making his hands into fists. Draco grabbed his tie and pulled him an inch away from his face, still scowling.
“Alrighty then.” Ron chuckled.
“Absolutely not.”
Malfoy’s glances at Harry. His neat handwriting as he copied the board, his face in a cute focused expression.
Harry hadn’t noticed him yet, and was still kicking that quill and humming, 𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑎𝑧𝑎𝑟 ℎ𝑒 𝑤𝑎𝑠 𝑠𝑜 𝐶𝑈𝑇𝐸 Draco thought. And he just couldn’t handle it for one more second.
They stopped running when they got to the Hall, Hermione chiding them as they headed to their seats at the Gryffindor table.
They dashed out of the hall, hand in hand as they turned corridor after corridor. Once they decided they had gone far enough, they slid down against the wall, collapsing from relief and exhaustion.
Draco Malfoy was more hesitant to come back to Hogwarts, but he wanted to see his friends and he needed excellent N.E.W.T.S. for a career worthy of a Malfoy. It was also a way to escape his house, with the terrible memories of being forced into service and the Dark Lord himself sitting in his dining room haunting him.
“Well who is it? I couldn’t really hear through the door.” Ron asked.
“Good, good.”
Oops. He’d been just a tad too obvious.
She frowned, but then got a mischievous smirk on her face. “Well who is it?” She inquired, one eyebrow high and arched.
Iris summoned two more sheets of parchment and wrote a response to Pansy:
"Does Seamus have any button up shirts?"
Hermione narrowed her eyes at him, scanning his face almost android-like, and zoned in on his bruised lips. She raised a suspicious eyebrow.
Then Hermione dashed down from her dormitory, and said, “Sorry, just doing some last-minute studying for today’s transfiguration exam!”
“Transfiguration exam!?” Harry and Ron simultaneously exclaimed.
Things are getting pretty cRaZy... lets just say we see some characteristic spiraling smoke...
He half-heartedly tried to pay attention, taking a few notes and listening to most of what Flitwick said.
“Wha-who? What.... no..... pffsh.... nah...”
Harry did not think the outfit was perfect, he hardly ever dressed formal if not in school robes and was not used to it. But he had to admit that it was not awful.
Pansy’s first two classes of the day went by too fast for her liking, and before she knew it, she was walking into the Great Hall for lunch. Draco was technically with her, but for all the words he said he could have just as well not been.
"Just search his trunk." Dean said. "And can you pull our curtains closed again?"
It was Monday morning in the Great Hall, and the trio was tired and groggy.
ℙ𝕒𝕟𝕤𝕪 ℙ𝕆𝕍
“Aw Pans! Why didn’t you tell me sooner!” Draco said smiling.
Pansy groaned and said exasperatedly, “You didn’t hear anything I just said. Did you.”
The three of them walked down to the Great Hall and found seats at the Gryffindor table. Everyone joined them as if they had always been doing so, and Harry shared the plan.
They walked over and sat down, Harry, Ron, and Hermione already being there.
A Gryffindor match against Slytherin, what will happen between the opposing seekers?
Our favorite five go to the Three Broomsticks. (Sorry I'm super bad at summaries.)
"Draco Malfoy, embarrassed, without a single hint of composure? What happen-OH!" She squeaked, her eyes darting to his slightly swollen lips. She giggled. She couldn't stop giggling, in fact.
Harry sighed, not very hungry anymore, and happened to glance up at the Slytherin table. He should really pick a seat facing away from it in the future.
Iris grinned. She would be seeing Pansy so soon! And she would love to see Hermione too, she was super smart and witty, and agreed with all of her opinions on books. And she could count on her to make the knuckleheads by the names of Harry and Ron come, as they try to avoid the library at all costs.
Hermione narrowed her eyes at him, irritated. She threw everything back into the trunk except the jeans. She stared down at them in dismay, before pulling out her wand. She lightened them in patches and by the end, they were looking fashionably faded. She performed tiny abrasive spells and soon the jeans were carefully distressed.
Pansy and Iris were having a great time, once the conversation started it didn’t stop, easily joking and talking about so many subjects.
Draco chuckled quietly at that, and scooted back over to Harry. “Thanks.” Draco said softly. Harry rested his head on Draco’s shoulder, and he rested his head on Harry’s. They sat like that for a few minutes, fingers intertwined, but got simply too drowsy to stay upright for much longer.
ℙ𝕒𝕟𝕤𝕪 ℙ𝕆𝕍
“Erm, good I guess, you?” Draco said awkwardly.
They were sitting in awkward silence until Madam Rosemerta made her way over. “Would you like anything to drink?” She raised a questioning eyebrow at the five of them sitting at the same table, but didn’t say anything about it.
“Well at least my dad’s still alive! How many dads have you lost? Let me count!”
They got to the grand entrance, and zipped to the Slytherin house table, eyes down.
He chuckled. “I'm FINE Pansy. I just needed some time to think.” 𝐴𝑏𝑜𝑢𝑡 𝐻𝐴𝑅𝑅𝑌... 𝐻𝑖𝑠 𝑏𝑟𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑡 𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑛 𝑒𝑦𝑒𝑠, ℎ𝑖𝑠 𝑡𝑜𝑢𝑠𝑙𝑒𝑑 ℎ𝑎𝑖𝑟--
Harry frowned slightly, still rubbing the mark with his thumb, thinking. But then he smiled softly, and looked over at Draco, and when their eyes met, his entire face broke into an accepting grin.
He flopped down on the couch and sighed, cheeks flushed and lips slightly bruised.
“See you guys later!” Iris said, slinging her bag over her shoulder and slipping out the door.
Iris blushed and tugged at her sleeve, whispering, “Let’s just let them be!” But Pansy responded, “Go ahead, I need to tell them off.” Iris rolled her eyes at her, but let go and started back towards the castle.
He got dressed sluggishly, slumping down to the common room.
The Ravenclaws found a table and sat down.
"Perfect." Hermione said.
Hermione mumbled something under her breath that sounded a lot like, "The correct word would be 'well'."
He pulled on his shirt and jeans rather reluctantly, thinking them both a little too tight. He tied on his tie rather sloppily, his hands shaking.
“I think that you should come sit with me at the Slytherin table.”
They floated over and landed on the coffee table. She wrote out a letter to Pansy and sealed it. “Can I use Hermes? I don’t want to go all the way to the owlry.”
“Harry. You literally watched him for hours into the night on the map.” Ron said, and Hermione nodded.
He and Ginny were really close, but they both had admitted that they loved each other more like siblings. And they were okay with that.
“Actually I would like a Firewhiskey.” Draco said.
“Yeah. Fine.” He grimaced, but then plastered on a cheery smile. “Let’s go eat some pancakes!”
He heard a familiar, but out of context, voice boom out from the commentator’s podium. Seamus!
Harry put his head in his hands and groaned.
It was pale pink, with a mother-of-pearl sheen. It was just as it was supposed to be, thanks to him, and actually quite beautiful. His quill worked fast to scribble down the appearance, because frankly he just couldn't wait to smell it.
“I have liked you for a while now.” Iris whispered, but it carried in the silence.
The trio was now sitting in their common room chatting, when a tawny owl swooped in through an open window and landed on the side table next to Hermione. She untied the letter and gave him a pat on the head, which earned an appreciative hoot, before he flew back out of the window.
“Would you mind if everyone came along?” Hermione asked hopefully.
Hermione murmured something that sounded suspiciously like, “𝐷𝑜 you ℎ𝑎𝑣𝑒...”
Draco scowled at her, and covered his mouth with his hand. "Pansy, really? Now?"
"I don't think that's such a good idea Mione!" Harry said urgently.
“Yes. You have forgotten the rose thorns and petals.” He said, his mercury eyes staring into Harry’s.
"It's not that gross Harry." Hermione sniffed. "But we will stop." But then she winked at Ron as if to say 'for now'. Ron guffawed stupidly and giggled like a little girl.
Ugh. He had been falling for ages. Gosh dangit. He asked Pansy if they could go inside.
Granger got there before Weasley and Potter, he wondered where they were. Wait, why did he care again? This was all just so confusing.
Hermione rolled her eyes at Harry. “Just focus on the game Harry. Just only look at the snitch, and you’ll be fine.” But the barely suppressed giggle and the look that said you-just-can’t-keep-your-eyes-off-him-can-you told him that Hermione was indeed making fun of him.
Iris tied the letter to his foot and said “Slytherin common room, Pansy Parkinson,” while looking him directly in the eyes. He hooted in understanding and flew out of an open window across from them.
"Oh gee... I don't know. We didn't... talk about it." Harry said, embarrassed. In truth, Harry wanted more than anything to date the beautiful blonde, but he would never say that aloud.
DADA: with Malfoy
“Of course! They can’t just cancel classes because of two students!” Hermione said, rolling her eyes.
“What is it Malfoy, sad that your daddy’s in prison?” Draco stood up.
༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄
Harry couldn’t focus on this lesson either, which Hermione would probably scold him for.
EEEEEE! I can't believe it's over! Thank you to everyone who has been reading, giving kudos, and commenting, it means so much!!!
༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄
She pulled them open and found Dean and Seamus snuggling and asleep, but thankfully still fully clothed.
Professor Slughorn went around helping the students who didn’t quite get it, and eventually the whole room was tinged with light smoke.
Harry kept playing last class over in his mind as he headed up to the East Tower for charms.
"Harry... did you just... kiss someone?"
"Nothing." Draco said too quickly.
Harry was rather happy with the events of the evening; their friend groups got along surprisingly well, Pansy talked to the girl she liked, and let’s just say he was not mad about what happened after, either.
"Pansy!" He whisper-yelled. "Not. Here!"
But Harry couldn’t pay attention, his mind repeating over and over 𝑗𝑢𝑠𝑡 𝑓𝑜𝑐𝑢𝑠 𝑜𝑛 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑠𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑐ℎ... 𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝑠𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑐ℎ 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑠𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑐ℎ 𝑎𝑙𝑜𝑛𝑒, 𝑛𝑜𝑡 𝑀𝑎𝑙𝑓𝑜𝑦 𝑎𝑛𝑑--𝑛𝑜 𝑛𝑜 𝑛𝑜 𝑗𝑢𝑠𝑡 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑠𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑐ℎ...
Pansy yawned loudly, which caused Draco and Harry to look over, slightly surprised that they weren’t alone. But her yawn caused a chain reaction, and soon Ron was yawning enormously, and everyone shifted to get comfier.
“Sure!” Pansy said, trying to sound excited, but her brow was creased.
Harry seriously doubted that, but rolled his eyes and said, "How in the name of Merlin did you arrange that?"
༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄
Five minutes later, the Hall was packed of students eating, laughing, and yelling; the usual. Iris looked over at the Slytherin table, her eyes finding Draco and following his gaze, right over to Harry. Draco gave a small nod.
Just then, Ron and Hermione burst in through the portrait hole, giggling profusely. They spotted Harry on the couch and plopped down next to him.
Dean caught Seamus’ eye and winked, and Seamus went an even deeper red, his ears and neck joining in the flush of blood. The entire stadium erupted in snickers.
Draco started to grab an apple, as usual, but Pansy said sternly, “You cannot just have an apple for breakfast every morning! You’re going to faint and fall off your broom from lack of protein!”
“Yes, I’m fine Pansy. Leave me alone.”
“What? No!”
Ron and Hermione stood up. “Hey Harry, is it alright if we meet you in the common room? We want to stop by the library.” Hermione said.
“Well, it’s Dr-“
"Ugh Pansy, please do not say you!"
"I am not wearing those Mione." Harry stated.
He gave her an apologetic look and said, “Sorry, I must have zoned out. What was the question?”
Draco snapped his head up, towards Pansy but away from the apple, and suddenly everything seemed duller. The colors less vibrant, everything dimmed in comparison to that shiny green apple. He shook his head vigorously, trying to clear it.
“Yes Harry, you’ve been acting strange lately. What’s up?” Hermione said with concern in her eyes.
Harry scowled up at the pair, and Draco felt a pang in his stomach, from what he did not know. He was probably just hungry.
Pansy turned around to see Loony—Luna Lovegood arm-in-arm with the Weaslette—Ginny that is.
Harry blushed furiously and looked at his hands, which were practically strangling each other in his lap.
She smiled brightly and sat down. He stuck his spoon into the porridge, and put it in his mouth reluctantly, only to find that it was actually quite delicious. He scarfed up the entire bowl.
A dreamy voice from behind them sang, “Oh hi Iris! Are we allowed to sit here now?”
"WOAH MATE!" Ron said, throwing the nearest object, which happened to be a rather heavy book that landed with a tremendous thud. "DID YOU KISS MALFOY!?"
He narrowed his eyes at her, scowling, looked at his plate, and took a bite of the sausage. Too greasy. He tried to spell away more, but it was no use. He sighed and put his fork down.
Classes went by far too slow for Harry. He was anxious to see Draco and all of his other friends; that afternoon's lunch was the most fun he had had in ages, and he couldn’t wait to experience that again.
“You know, Harry, I haven’t seen Draco bully a single student this year. He’s changed. And before that, I think that all that was just what his dad forced upon him, and what he had grown up being told was okay.” Ron glanced at her, hesitated, but then nodded.
Arithmancy- not with Potter, thank Salazar.
What was he thinking!? He must just be a little jumbled in the head after all the trauma he had endured. But he looked across the lake at Malfoy, he just couldn’t help it, and was surprised to find his silver eyes staring back at his emerald ones.
She walked out of the door and skipped down towards the library.
"Guess what we are doing this evening!" She said excitedly.
“Josh? Oh.” She blushed again. She couldn’t stop her eyes from drifting back to the table of Ravenclaws. Hermione followed her eyes and raised an eyebrow at Pansy. Pansy shot her a panicked look so Hermione just took another sip of Butterbeer.
Draco did NOT want to go to breakfast that morning, and put up quite the fight. But Pansy decided to be his 𝑚𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟, and was forcing him to go down.
They got there just in time and slid into seats near the back.
He spotted Ginny land and Luna run up to her and engulf her in a embrace that practically knocked Ginny over. They laughed happily, the joy as they looked into each other’s eyes palpable.
Harry looked behind him discreetly. (Not discreetly, in fact it was pretty obvious.) There was no one behind him.
“After classes today, want to meet me by the lake?”
She knelt down by the foot of his bed and opened the trunk. She took out the first layer of stuff, and let out a gasp of delight. She pulled out a royal blue button-up. She placed the rest of the stuff back in the trunk and stood up.
It felt like where she was meant to be.
He wondered if they were dating. Probably. That would be just his luck, wouldn’t it.
“Josh and Chris must have gone back up to the castle.” Iris said, turning back to Pansy.
Hermione and Ron stood in the opening, suspicious looks on their faces. "What do you want Pansy," Hermione snapped.
“It’s ok Hermione. It isn’t your fault.”
“Sure.” Harry said, sadly thinking that he couldn’t be more alone than he already was.
“Please.” Iris pleaded.
Weasley took the farther away one and looked at me with disgust, but then his eyes widened a bit and he smirked at Harry and gestured slightly with his head towards Draco.
They arrived at the common room rather soon, too soon in Harry's opinion.
Ron said something and Hermione burst out laughing, joking and playfully shoving Ron, all with a huge smile on her face, but stopped abruptly and looked towards Professor Flitwick when the bell rang.
He coughed again. “I mean—Dean has the quaffle, and he is flying back to the Slytherin posts...”
"Nope! Us!"
He looked at Pansy to find that she had a giant smirk on her face, and an arched eyebrow.
He did his absolute best not to look at the Slytherin table. 𝐷𝑜𝑛’𝑡 𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑘 𝑎𝑡 ℎ𝑖𝑚 𝑤ℎ𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟 𝑦𝑜𝑢 𝑑𝑜... 𝐷𝑜𝑛’𝑡 𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑘 𝑎𝑡 𝐷𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑜... 𝐾𝑒𝑒𝑝 𝑦𝑜𝑢𝑟 𝑒𝑦𝑒𝑠 𝑜𝑛 𝑦𝑜𝑢𝑟 𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒... 𝐷𝑜𝑛’𝑡 𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑘... was running through his mind in a constant loop.
But the fire was warm, and the chair was soft. She felt... cozy. She shook her head.
She smirked playfully. "Maybe I should choose your outfits for all of the rest of your dates then."
“Why don’t you just ask him out?” Ron said, only slightly and jokingly making fun of him.
Seeing his expression, she said, “Well go get him! I’ll be your wing-woman, two steps behind you, here if you need me.”
They arrived at the library to find Draco, Pansy, and Iris already there. “We’ve been waiting for you!” Pansy said good-naturedly.
"Well first of all only seventh and eighth years are allowed in Hogsmeade outside of I happen to know that both Honeydukes AND Zonko's are having crazy sales tomorrow! Nobody would come to the Three Broomsticks when they could get such good deals!"
He ticked them off on his fingers dramatically. “Your actual dad, too weak to even fight long enough to let his family escape, that shame-of-the-family madman Sirius Black, lunatic Dumb-as-a-door himself, then that werewolf Lupin!”
“Oh it’s nothing.” He said, trying to keep his voice steady but unable to meet their eyes. He looked down at his plate and shoveled in a bite of mashed potatoes that was much too large so he wouldn’t have to talk anymore.
“Yeah she’s quite nice actually, once you get to know her, I think she’s just insecure, and was protecting Draco..."
Harry ran his finger along the faded black of the skull and the snake, Draco shaking slightly at his touch. His eyebrows were drawn together, afraid of being judged, of being pushed away because of the sins of his past.
As he was setting them down, he pricked himself on one of the thorns, deep ruby blood oozing out of the tip of his finger. “Ah!” He exclaimed, wiping the blood on his robes.
Draco and Harry tried to keep up the bickering facade in classes and in the corridors. They invented a little game of creating insults that meant other things, trying to get the other to break character and laugh.
“If you would grab the ingredients Potter, I’ll make the potion.”
Ron opened the door and pleasantly warm air smelling of Butterbeer wafted over them. They stepped inside and Harry scanned the room, eyes landing on a table in the far left corner.
“Ooh! Tell me all about them!” Penny said, her eyes lighting up as she snatched her bookmark from the coffee table and put it in her book, setting it down on the table to give Iris her full attention.
He looked back at Harry, only to find the bright green eyes staring right into his own. They maintained eye contact for a few seconds, but then blushed and hastily looked away.
Draco walked back towards Harry and started to walk up to Gryffindor house. Harry reached for Draco’s hand and intertwined their fingers.
Just then, the bell rang announcing five minutes before first class, and they could hear the muffled sounds of everyone in the Hall scrambling to grab their stuff and get to class.
“We should probably go too.” Pansy said.
Draco did not pull away.
However, they decided it was best to keep their friendship a secret; they all hated to imagine the rumors that would circulate, evil Death Eater’s son with the Golden Boy, etc. Because of this, they could only meet up in the evenings or in places they knew to be deserted.
𝕊𝕠𝕣𝕣𝕪 𝕥𝕙𝕚𝕤 𝕡𝕒𝕣𝕥 𝕚𝕤 𝕘𝕠𝕚𝕟𝕘 𝕥𝕠 𝕓𝕖 𝕗𝕣𝕠𝕞 𝕓𝕠𝕥𝕙 𝕡𝕠𝕚𝕟𝕥𝕤 𝕠𝕗 𝕧𝕚𝕖𝕨
They exited the common room and headed towards the library.
She had just grabbed a small scoop of hash browns, a strip of bacon, a muffin, and a handful of cherries.
“Hey! Do not call me that. I just care about you!”
He rolled his eyes at her. “Fine.” He said, but didn’t continue.
“Uhm... yes?” She asked like it was a question. She cringed. “Yes. I am Pansy. And you are Iris, right?”
Draco and Pansy found a table in the corner. It seemed clean enough, and was one of the less rickety ones.
༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄
“See you later, Harry!” Hermione said and Ron winked at him.
“Double potions first thing in the morning!” Ron exclaimed, and shoved in a large bite of scrambled eggs. “Thish. Ish.” He swallowed. “Bloody ridiculous! At least Slughorn’s not as bad as... oh.”
Hermione laughed. "That's great Harry." Hermione said with a big smile. "Also we never went over the fact that he likes you back!?"
Draco swore and flew higher and higher, blushing furiously. Ugh! How could he have let that slip so drastically! Number one he was nice to Harry, number two he was nice to Ron—eww, number three he meant the stupid Gryffindor version, which just, ugh.
They walked back out, when Pansy heard a moan from the alley across from them.
“Yeah.” Ron rubbed his thumb on hers and let go to encircle her waist with his arm. Hermione mirrored the action and smiled, and they walked across the hall together.
“What?”
He didn’t so much mind it, and he often felt bad about it himself, even if he didn’t have a choice in the matter. It was just he often felt even more lonely than usual, especially with Potter teasing him less and less.
“What? Draco? When did you get here?”
They got to the Transfiguration classroom and found seats.
But Harry couldn’t bear to break away so he stood up while bending over, Draco following. He stumbled backwards toward the door, almost tripping over a chair. He fumbled for the knob, turned it hastily, pushed open the door with his back, and grabbed the frame above him for support, stepping blindly down the two steps.
And MERLIN. It. Was. HO- No. No no no no no. He was not just about to say hot. He must just still be hungry. He did not feel that way about fudging ‘Saint Potter.’ No way.
“My name’s Iris. Nice to meet you!” Iris said shyly but kindly.
“Where are you going Mione?” Ron asked.
He kept backing up until he met another shop, sliding against the bricks until they found an alley and stepped inside, Draco pushing Harry against the wall.
He sat in one corner, and Draco came in a moment later and took the other, and Harry was grateful.
She smiled down at the letter, set it down on the table, and stood up.
A cool wind swept over them and Iris shivered. Pansy stepped closer and put her arm around Iris to share heat. Delightful tingles spread from where they touched.
༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄
“To go meet them of course!”
Iris could have sworn actual hurt flashed across Harry’s face, and he jumped away from the table in anger. 𝑊𝑎𝑠 𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑠 𝑜𝑘? Iris thought to herself. 𝐼 𝑡ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ𝑡 𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑦 𝑎𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑑 𝑜𝑛 𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑠! 𝑇ℎ𝑖𝑠 𝑠𝑒𝑒𝑚𝑠 𝑎 𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑡𝑙𝑒 𝑡𝑜𝑜 ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑠ℎ...
He also saw Hermione look at him slightly disgusted, and say something he couldn’t hear, but from Ron’s face he could tell that she was not very approving of his heaping plate.
Draco let go of his book and let his palm lay open-faced on his thigh. Harry moved his thumb up and down his wrist in small strokes, and without really meaning to, his strokes got higher and higher, brushing the skin just under the cuff of his sleeve, and Draco jerked away as if he had been burned.
Ron and Hermione were on one side, and from left to right on the other was Iris, Pansy, Draco, and Harry. As the hall filled and people found seats closer and closer to the six of them, they began to get more nervous.
Draco pulled out a book and read for a while, trying to take his mind off Harry. Just then Pansy burst through the passage.
She gave him a giant, giddy grin and said, “Well go for it! Did you happen to see what he what he smelled in the potion? That way we’ll know how to attract him... or who to eliminate.” She said, a huge mischievous grin consuming her features.
He slammed Harry against the wall and kissed him. It was rough and desperate, full of years of pent up feelings. Desperate to feel a response. Desperate to know that Harry liked him back.
“I have no idea-“
“It’s Draco Malfoy!” She squeaked excitedly, her whole face conspiratorial and giddy.
But then Harry said “Hey, Draco...” winked, and bit his bottom lip so seductively that Draco choked, dropped his hand, and stopped racing towards the snitch.
“Sure!” She jumped up and disappeared down the spiral staircase in the middle of the room. Iris barely had time to read another paragraph of her book before Penny came bounding back up the stairs surprisingly soon, a chipper looking tawny owl perched on her sleeve.
And kissed him. Draco melted into it and started kissing back immediately. Passionately. Their hands found each other’s hair and intertwined themselves in it, deepening the kiss. Draco’s hair was impossibly soft. Harry could taste Draco, he was slightly sweet, almost like apples. Harry was SO sweet, deep and rich with an undertone of treacle.
“OH MY GOSH IRIS! What a catch!” Penny interrupted excitedly. “Then what’s the problem? And may I ask who?”
Draco looked after them until the door swung shut, then he couldn’t stand one more second of his mouth not on Harry’s.
Draco coughed and said, "Erm, well, goodnight then, Harry."
"What's got you so happy?" Pansy said with a smirk.
He somehow ended up in his dormitory who knows how long later, dazed and slightly confused.
Harry choked, and had a tremendous coughing fit. Ron slapped him on the back, hard.
“What!? Is that even allowed?” Iris said incredulously.
She threw shirts, ties, robes, belts, dress robes, and many things that Draco couldn't identify because they were flying onto his bed and covered by another item of clothing. It was an apparel hurricane.
༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄
“Well I just caught you staring at Potter, and I asked if you liked him.” She said matter-of-factly.
“This whole time? I never left...”
He went to sleep that evening trying to think of conversation topics, how he should act, what he should get to drink, overthinking everything.
Pansy got this goofy grin on her face and prodded, “Is it a giirrlll!?” She poked him in the side and giggled.
“Pretty sunset, huh?” Draco said, but he was looking at Harry.
That night, they both went to sleep dreaming about each other.
Hermione plucked an old looking book from the shelf with a triumphant look. She practically marched over to Ron and sat down next to him, blowing off the dust and opening the faded cover hungrily.
On Parkinson, and 𝐷𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑜.
Draco looked skeptical, but had to agree that Hogwarts students couldn't resist candy and joke supplies.
“Will this table be fine, Potter?” Draco said.
The match had ended quite quickly, so there were still a good number of classes left.
It looked to be a small tube of chapstick, the label bright green. He couldn’t look away as Draco swiped it across his top and bottom lip, rubbing it twice on a very small chapped spot.
Harry circled the pitch, specifically avoiding looking at the opposing seeker.
He had gotten very slightly taller, and more muscled, his hair as crazy as ever, but it was clean. His emerald eyes were as vibrant as ever, and for the split second their eyes had met, the intensity of them had burned.
Ron snarled. "No. Way. In. Hell. would I be friends with you two!"
Frick. What was he going to do? He groaned and massaged his temples.
He laughed. He sighed. He looked up into those eyes, those kind eyes, those eyes filled with actual interest and excitement, the eyes of a girl who had stayed friends with him through everything. He broke down.
Unburdened by all that was being forced upon him, his sharp features were more relaxed, his face peaceful as he stared out at the water.
He did have an essay, but really he just couldn’t STAND looking at Potter for one more second.
Hermione found Ron and hugged him too, and then they started walking towards Harry.
He looked at her, eyes pleading. “Hermioneee...”
He shot her a yeah-sure-it’s-a-girl-Pansy-have-you-even-met-me look and rolled his eyes again.
“Haha yeah... the homework...” He said, wincing and rubbing his head where he had hit it on the desk, and glancing at Hermione.
Two of Harry’s fingers brushed Draco’s palm as Harry set the petals in his hand.
Hermione smiled brightly. "That's perfect Nev! It really is best to match warmer colors with a blue toned shirt."
“Really. It’s alright.” Draco smiled back.
Draco ran out of the classroom and towards Arithmancy as soon as the bell rang.
“I love you too.”
“Oh lay off it will you.” Draco said, glaring coldly, annoyed.
Ron rolled his eyes at her but shrugged as if to suggest she was not wrong.
Harry bent down and took a whiff of the potion at Slughorn’s words.
“Umm... Draco?” Pansy asked, her eyes questioning.
“Hey! It’s the whole gang! How are you guys?” Seamus said cheerfully, looking at Iris, Pansy, and Draco.
“Yah, sorry Harry. But still...”
"It was, erm... alright." Draco said, averting his eyes. It was so much more than alright. It was everything he ever could have wanted. But he did not say that out loud. He blushed.
Harry cringed. But he couldn’t stop thinking about Draco’s lips, how 𝑠𝑜𝑓𝑡 and 𝑝𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑝... oh my gosh. He groaned inwardly.
Neville beamed at her, proud of himself. Ron nodded at him, surprised but impressed.
Iris Damcott. A beautiful, intelligent Ravenclaw with long, thick, dark, 𝑏𝑒𝑎𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑓𝑢𝑙 hair, large, chocolate eyes framed by thick lashes, perfectly smooth caramel skin, full lips...
His stomach growling angrily, he headed down to the dungeons, murmuring the password and slipping inside the Slytherin common room.
He grinned at her stupidity and fumbled around in his bag for a quill and ink.
Draco felt confused.
She had a book in her lap, but was looking forward unfocused, playing with and cleaning her nails with her others, fiddling and tapping.
Harry grinned at him, visibly relaxing, and pulled Ron into a hug. “Thanks Ron. That means a lot.” He said, glad that Ron was still here for him.
"We need your help with something." She said, standing over them. Dean awoke first and gasped when he saw Hermione. "Jeez Mione what is it?"
He scowled at her, and went back to looking at his knees.
Draco blushed and twiddled his thumbs.
Ron and Harry looked down at their plates, but were startled out of their daze when Hermione exclaimed, “Oh no! Class starts in two minutes!”
“Erm... Pansy Parkinson.”
Pansy caught him blushing and smirked, but let it slide.
Draco got lost in the making of the complex potion, a bead of sweat on his forehead as he added meticulous amounts of powder. He stirred in a complicated pattern, and smiled when the potion got shinier.
༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄
“Now the last ingredient, pearl dust.” He sprinkled it in, and gave a final clockwise stir, and let out a relieved sigh and a huge grin as the potion started giving off spiraling light-colored smoke.
His eyes widened and he gasped, “No! Really Harry? You’re straight, aren’t you?”
“...do you?” Pansy asked, and Draco sensed he should have been listening for a while now. He took a guess.
𝑫𝒓𝒂𝒄𝒐 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝑰 𝒘𝒐𝒖𝒍𝒅 𝒍𝒐𝒗𝒆 𝒕𝒐 𝒄𝒐𝒎𝒆! 𝑰 𝒄𝒂𝒏’𝒕 𝒘𝒂𝒊𝒕 𝒕𝒐 𝒔𝒆𝒆 𝒚𝒐𝒖! 𝑪𝒂𝒏 𝒘𝒆 𝒊𝒏𝒗𝒊𝒕𝒆 𝑯𝒂𝒓𝒓𝒚, 𝑹𝒐𝒏, 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝑯𝒆𝒓𝒎𝒊𝒐𝒏𝒆 𝒕𝒐𝒐? 𝑫𝒓𝒂𝒄𝒐 𝒊𝒔 𝒑𝒓𝒂𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒄𝒂𝒍𝒍𝒚 𝒍𝒐𝒔𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒉𝒊𝒔 𝒎𝒊𝒏𝒅!
“You think so?” Draco asked sheepishly, not daring to hope.
Charms- with Potter
“Wha-oh. Draco!” Harry looked at Draco, concern covering his entire face.
“REALLY!? I fricken knew it! You’ve been ‘complaining’ about perfect ’Saint Potter’ for years!”
This made Ron's mouth drop open, staring stupidly at her, and made Harry made a terribly exaggerated gagging and retching noise, pretending to vomit.
Madam Rosemerta nodded and walked away, heels clicking on the stone floor.
Harry sat up and rubbed his eyes. "What?" He said, annoyed for being woke up so early.
Pansy hurried to catch up, meeting him on the stairs. "Oh Draco I'm sorry. I'm happy for you, I really am!" Then she got a mischievous look on her face. "How was it?"
Draco had kissed people, but never anything like this. 𝐺𝑜𝑠ℎ nothing like this. Nothing so passionate. Nothing that filled his entire body with thrill and euphoria. It was perfect.
How did you like this one? Please tell me any suggestions!
Harry couldn’t really focus on the lesson, instead his eyes kept straying to a certain blonde.
༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄
But Malfoy could never like him back. Malfoy HATED Harry! And Harry hated Malfoy! He had done so much to show that! He stalked him endlessly on the map, he had house elves just follow him around, he was just suspicious! With good reason! He hated Malfoy. Or at least he thought he did...
𝕀𝕣𝕚𝕤 ℙ𝕆𝕍
She ignored him and threw another item out of the closet. She emerged from the closet, her eyes victorious and her smile maniacal. She held an emerald green button-up, a simple black woven-leather belt with a silver buckle, and a black tie with silver accents.
Then Harry reached for an apple, almost identical to his own, out of a small pile of fruit. He watched as Harry broke off a piece of the apple and HOLY MERLIN.
Herbology: not with Malfoy, thank Merlin.
Seamus rubbed his eyes and yawned. He mumbled something incoherent and laid his head down on Dean's chest.
“Who is it! Do I know him? Spill Draco the suspense is killing me!” She said, turning on to her stomach and facing Draco, her legs doing the stereotypical gossip-girl swing, her chin resting on her fists.
“Alright now, partners. Yes... Granger with Parkinson, Weasley with Zabini, Mr Malfoy with Harry...” he paired Ernie with a Ravenclaw, and rattled off a few more names. “Get to work!”
But he was going very slow, and kicking what looked to be part of a broken quill as he walked. His hands were in his pockets and he was humming softly.
But he had smiled back... hadn’t he?
"Night." Harry stammered, looking at his feet.
Iris was quite antsy, her relationship with Pansy didn’t need to be as secret as Draco and Harry’s, but Pansy didn’t want word spreading because her family was quite old fashioned and homophobic. Even if they could be accepting for once, Iris was half-blood, and Pansy was certain that her parents would never get over that. She was anxious to see her.
Harry sat up fast, scrambling away from Draco, but the damage was done.
༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄
“You aren’t supposed to get drunk on school grounds!” Pansy said, teasing him.
He glanced around at their surprised faces. "What, you think I could sleep through all of that? Or is it that I might be able to match clothing?"
“Yeah mate.” Ron said, chuckling. “We’re dying to know who it is.”
Harry scooted closer to the blonde and brushed his hand against Draco’s. It was freezing! But that just made him want to warm them with his own. He intertwined their fingers.
He looked at Harry, and blushed, the color blossoming all across his face and down his neck.
“No reason, hmm?” Hermione teased.
“Ugh. Potty, Granger, and Weasel have taken our spot.” Pansy spat. “Let’s find somewhere else, shall we Draco? Somewhere... FAR away?”
Harry pinched the bridge of his nose.
But Potter could never like him back. They hated each other! Always had! Draco had gone to such lengths just to display his hatred! He climbed a tree, he complained about how terribly perfect he was constantly, he spent hours making pins with Potter's face on them, he made snide remarks in the corridors every chance he got-
“Alright...” Draco said, still suspicious.
“Uh huh. Sure.”
Hermione looked as if she was about to burst, giddy with whatever news she was about to tell him.
Pansy looked very confused, but shook her head and said, “Well then, off to the Gryffindor table?”
Harry ate his food solemnly, hardly noticing the taste. Everyone was so happy! Hermione laughing with Ron, Dean and Seamus doing a bit for two other Gryffindors, Luna smiling at Ginny from the Ravenclaw table, Pansy giggling at something Draco said.
This was exactly the problem! If he got distracted, he would lose the snitch to Malfoy and he would never hear the end of it! Get distracted by his whole body really... his paper white skin, his pale blond hair—perfectly styled yet somehow still so soft looking, his tall, lean figure, the hardened abs he could see when his shirt was pulled against him by the wind while racing by on a broom, the competitiveness in his eyes, his 𝑎𝑟𝑠𝑒...
"Yes." Pansy said, acknowledging her with a nod. "Now I happen to know the Draco likes Harry very much, so I thought we should all hang out together! Join our friend groups! Make it easier for the couple!"
༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄༄
Harry blushed and mumbled something incoherent.
He grabbed the stick out of the honey pot and dripped a golden swirl of honey on top of the apples, and sprinkled a dash of cinnamon.
“Drunken sex in an alley is not very becoming you know.” She said sternly.
“Sorry Harry. I just had to think it through. I support you in every way and I’m sure my family will too.” Ron said with a shy smile.
Draco rolled his eyes at Harry, and flew away from him. Harry zoomed up high again, facing the Gryffindor goal posts.
He found Draco and was surprised to see his gray eyes already staring into his own. Draco’s look of not-unpleasant-really-but-something-Harry-just-could-not-place to a rather forced looking sneer. Harry looked back down at his two bites left of a sandwich, his face burning.
Draco chuckled. "A vampire's bites are a bit more lasting, but they will heal." He began attentively licking each wound closed, they sealed themselves without a trace with each pass of his tongue. Draco left just one mark unhealed, at the hollow of Harry's neck. Harry then tended to the bites he'd left on Draco, pausing now and again to admire the vampire's body.
Harry’s black eyes widened. A flurry of thoughts scattered in his brain trying to make sense of everything that had happened to him.
The two walked hand in hand to Draco’s bedroom. The room sat at the end of a long hallway, bordered with floor to ceiling French windows, which were draped in thick emerald curtains embroidered with silver threads to block out the sun. At the end of the hall was set of heavy wooden double doors adorned with silver handles. Draco dropped Harry’s hand when they met the doorway and he pulled a small, shining key from his pocket. In a movement so fast Harry would have missed it were he human, Draco unlocked the door and swung it open wide, ushering Harry inside.
"Drink from me, Harry." Draco said. His voice was exacting. Harry leaned forward to clasp his teeth into Draco's neck, when a hand met his chest and stilled him.
Harry turned his head towards the voice and met Draco's gaze with glazed black eyes. It was clear he'd over-indulged, Pansy ever the bad influence. Draco chuckled, and scooped Harry into his arms. He planted a kiss on Pansy's forehead before he carried his drunken new one out to the carriage where Harry dozed in his lap the whole way home.
“You won’t get through me. I am stronger than you and I am faster than you. My senses are keener. I wouldn’t even consider it if I were you.”
It was a strange feeling, the wispy memory of shame. The images that flitted through his mind used to electrocute Harry with the feeling, now it felt like witnessing someone else's embarrassing blunder. It was the first and only time he'd laid with someone, and it had felt so very wrong. The memory was too fragmented to cause him shame now, but still he wouldn't miss this one when it disappeared altogether. He might even like to replace it with a new one. He imagined that if his next first time was with Draco it would be perfect. He would preserve it in his memories for the rest of time.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry lost track of time while they drank from one another. He had no idea how long they rolled around in the sheets feeding on each other's blood. No matter how much they drank neither of them wilted or tired, they could have gone on forever, laying in Draco's bed, sharing blood. When they finally parted and Harry came to they were both painted crimson, bite marks littered his now naked torso.
Harry glanced back at Draco with worry in his dark eyes, he'd always been a terrible dancer, and now Pansy had him set on edge. He was sure he'd embarrass himself, and he really didn't want to embarrass Draco. Draco felt Harry's worry and wrapped an arm around his waist, pressing him into his side.
It was clear there wouldn't be any arguing, Draco was determined to have fun, so Harry allowed himself to be led to the center of the ballroom, Draco's hand never leaving his side. Draco turned to face Harry and pulled him into the dance. The quartet was playing a waltz, and Draco led the pair with ease. Harry had never learned to properly dance, and yet the movements came to him like a second nature, mirroring Draco's steps like a master. He shouldn't have been surprised, his body moved with precision in everthing now, he practically glided across the slick wood floor. The two of them danced together for several numbers, and Harry realized Draco was right, he was having fun.
"It's surreal." Harry answered. "It's as if a tie is formed when I drink from them. I can feel their emotions, I can even mold them sometimes."
Harry laughed and Draco beamed at him. "I swear it's as if you read my thoughts sometimes, Draco." Harry said.

"I will take you. But they are not to see you. You are not to speak with them. We will go so you can say goodbye to your old life, and then you will move on."
"You are at peace." Draco answered his unspoken question. "A vampire must be able to swallow their everlasting hunger to stamp out the blackness in their eyes. Even still there are times that I can't control mine, and some vampires are never able to. I spent months when I was first turned, meditating with Tomas, before I could do it."
"My friend here is going to drink from you now." Harry nearly jumped up and Oliver tensed when he saw his face. Harry's features were angular and inhuman. His black eyes were soulless. Draco grinned as he chastised his new one, "behave yourself, Harry."
He gestured to a set of clothing laid out on a chaise lounge tucked into the corner. “For you.”
"How can I help you, Master Malfoy?" The man asked.
“Look,” Draco gestured to a mirror hung on the wall.
Harry was thankful Ronald had Hermione, ever the realist, to bring the dreamer back to Earth sometimes. He knew Ronald would never stop searching for him, that was the kind of brother he was. They were joined at the hip, nearly inseparable for as long as he could remember. His father used to joke that Harry and Ronald were twins like Fred and George, separated at birth and reunited. Ronald would wait a lifetime for his brother to come home, and he would be let down, again and again.
"What does it say?" Harry asked.
Harry's attention was torn from the crowd by a woman's voice, musical yet cutting.
Harry glanced at the door again, his mouth watering. “There’s more blood. I can smell it.”
Harry hesitated, unsure of Draco’s meaning. How could he dispel the girl’s fear? He was about to feed from her after all, fear seemed only natural. He studied her for a moment, her back was rigid and she wrung her hands in her lap, her eyes flitted around the room, from Draco to Harry and then to the door. Harry crouched before the girl and set his hands on either arm of the chair, blocking her in. He met her eyes and she froze, transfixed by his black gaze.
Draco hummed approval at the words. He moved his grip up Harry's wrists and rested his fingertips where he could feel his rapid pulse. Then Draco drew one of Harry's hands to his own chest, resting it on the exposed skin. Harry could feel Draco's heart thrumming away in his rib cage and his own heart seemed to jump into his throat. He pressed his palm firmly against Draco's hard chest, resisting the aching desire to slide his hand further under his shirt and explore the expanse of velvet skin beneath it.
"Perhaps, in time. I've never experienced it myself." Draco smiled at him. "I met a pair of twins in India once, nearly a century ago. They'd been sharing their blood for as long as they'd been turned, they said it was as if they were a single soul sharing two bodies."
”I feel different,” Harry said, he had no other words to describe his current state.
"Is that true? Are you scared, Oliver?" Oliver nodded, his eyes fixed on his lap.
“Since you aren’t alive, I imagine you don’t get bored here. I mean, a person who is alive would be driven to insanity in a place like this...right? Dismissing the other concerns, of course,” Draco mumbled. He tended to voice his theories aloud a lot.
Eventually, after hours of lying in bed pretending to be asleep, he heard the breaths of his dorm mates slow. He knew they were all asleep now, and that it was time. Since making his decision in the library Draco seemed to feel the diary growing more and more excited; as if it knew it would soon be used.
This time, Draco startled. A flush of panic overwhelmed him. She had...noticed? It was confirmed then- Draco still had to deal with the aftermath of the whole ring fiasco.
“I think you’d better head to the dorms. We don’t want points taken away this early on, yeah? And remember who my brother happens to be McLaggen. Oh, right. A prefect,” Fred Weasley growled.
Everything else was a complete blur for Draco. Snape had wanted to interrogate him the moment they landed in his office, but Draco just sent him a tired look and the elder ceased speaking immediately. Draco knew that he’d be questioned first thing in the morning, but for now, he was given what he wanted- silence.
“There. Now we’re even. You don’t tell Snape about that punch, and I won’t tell Mcgonagall about the harassment. Got it?” Fred grumbled.
Daphne nodded. “Astoria realized how important that heirloom was to you and decided to ask Ginevra about it, since she was in Potter’s compartment when you were,” Daphne said in a playful tone.
Daphne stepped up to defend her sister, but before she had time to cast any spells at the Gryffindor the little figure pushed the older student out of the way. Draco faltered for a moment- that was Ginevra Weasley. A Gryffindor Weasley defending a pure blooded Slytherin.
Omg I'm so happy to finally update this!!! I apologize for leaving things off as I did, and for not updating, but life got rough. I needed to concentrate on school and everything- but I'm back now, and I should be more consistent with updates. At the least, I won't go months without updating again. Anyways, I hope you enjoy reading this chapter. As always, constructive criticism is appreciated, and I hope everyone has a wonderful day/night!
In an effort to apologize to his father Draco accepts the task Lucius presents to him. He just doesn’t understand why a Weasley would need to be involved.
But it was possible. Astoria stepped up to the table and laid the black diary on it gently. “I wanted to thank Ginevra again for defending me after the feast. For a Gryfindor, she isn’t all that bad. And I just thought I’d give her a small gift along with my thank you. When I mentioned you losing your book- a powerful book- she said that she’d found it in her trunk funnily enough,” Astoria explained.
Draco would agree with his father. He shouldn’t be walking to the guillotine. Yet, Daphne was one of his own- a Slytherin. He couldn’t live with that truth for the rest of his life...the truth that he had...that he’d- Draco blanched.
What worried him was the piercing headache. His head throbbed, and it felt like the time he’d had a migraine. Of course, that time his mother had simply cooed at him as she slipped a potion down Dracos throat, and sure enough his migraine was gone soon after. Now, he didn’t have a potion near him- and he didn’t feel like he could do anything, much less summon his mother or even Dobby.
I’m just drifting off to sleep when Draco sneezes and my nerves must be frayed from my years with the aurors because I lurch away from him. But the bed is far too small for two people and I end up thwacking my head on the floor, half tangled in sheets, and Draco leaning over me, heaving with laughter. I groan, rubbing my head.
“Sorry, I wanted to last longer. Sorry,” he pants out before pulling my lips to his. I cum while we kiss, well it’s more like panting into each other’s mouth. The waves slam through me as I spill into his still spasming arse then collapse against him. We stand there in that not very comfortable position, catching our breath and letting the sweat cool on our bodies.
“Then we have a full bottle at home that will do.” He pulls away and grins at me. God that black lipstick is gorgeous.
When Weasley, Hermione, and Rose arrive, Harry and I each have a twin. Albus, who I have, is refusing to finish his bottle and James is in Harry’s arms, staring at the TV with Harry. And I swear, if I wasn't annoyed with Albus at the moment, I’d be laughing at Harry and James. They’re both giving the football game on the TV matching open-mouthed, blank stares. As soon as the Weasleys are through the floo, Scorpius is dragging Rose and Weasley outside with a very unbalanced Lily toddling after them. Weasley sends us an apologetic smile but leaves his wife with us anyway. A pregnant Hermione kisses Harry and I on the cheek before taking James and sending Harry straight outside saying, “I think Ron has some complaining to do and so do I so shoo!” She immediately plops down on the sofa beside me and groans.
“Well, no, but we are! Together! Forever! I can’t believe it really. That you’re mine.” I press my lips to the soft skin between his eyebrows.
“Okay!” He smiles and bounds away and I wandlessly spell away the broken mug. Harry smiles and moves to snake his arms around my waist. The crying upstairs gets marginally louder and I groan as Harry chuckles.
“I’d burn.”
“I’m not done yet,” I say into his thigh. I take his thighs and push them up so that I have access to his beautiful arsehole, tightly furled and winking at me. My mouth waters.
“Oh, darling, your poor cock!” she snorts, “I’d say we both need some cock. Just one night and I’d be happy.”
“Ah! Mr. Potter!” He greats me with a handshake and a pat on the back.
“You’ll regret it when we have to wake up for the twins in a few hours and I don't want to deal with that.” He suddenly hoists me up bridal style, making me squeal. “So bedtime!” I lean my head on his shoulder and breathe him in. He smells like cheap cologne and bread from his bakery. Yup! Harry Potter, savior of the wizarding world, and the chosen one is a baker! And a damn good one. In fact, he won some sort of best baker shit just a little while ago. Harry always smells like bread. Even when we’re on vacation for a week. I press my nose into that smell and let it fill my whole body. I don't remember falling asleep, but when I wake up, it's in bed to the sound of two screaming babies.
“As per usual.”
“God we’re good at that,” He mumbles tiredly into my chest.
“Duty calls!” he mumbles against my temple. I groan into his bare chest. I really just want a good blowjob and a nap.
“It's a nightshirt, brute.” I laugh at him as I unbutton it myself, he tugs it over my head and promptly starts nipping at my nipple, making me whimper. “But I wouldn’t expect you to know the difference.” He pays no attention to my jibe and makes his way down my front with more biting kisses. His hands move down to clutch at my thighs while my hands move to pull at his wild curls.
“Yes please. Put it in me,” he wines, pulling me down by my hair to shove his tongue in my mouth. I wipe my hand on a towel on the vanity before separating my lips from Draco’s to yank off my trousers and pants. Draco wraps a hand around my now exposed length and gives me a few delicious tugs. I pull his legs so that his bum is just off the vanity and pull one up over my shoulder. He’s breathing heavily and his face down to his cock is flushed soft pink. I’ve never been more in love with him. I lean down to kiss his neck gently.
“Do you want me, Harry,” I whisper. His piercing eyes snap to mine. “Do you want this arse?” I turn and spread my arse cheeks for him. One thing that I’ve learned after being married to Harry for nearly 10 years is that he is downright filthy and four kids have done nothing to dampen that.
“Want you, Harry. It’s been so long. Want you so bad.” I let go of my arse cheek to pull at my throbbing cock. That’s when Harry’s calloused hands turn me around by the waist to bite at my mouth.
“At least one more time, sir.” He pulls back the curtain and leads me into a dark room and through a maze of tables each with a single candle and one or two occupants to my usual table in the center of the room with a perfect view of the empty stage. “Shall I get you your usual beverage?” I nod. “Your favorite act will be out soon.” Soon after he’s left, my drink, one finger of expensive whiskey, arrives and the stage lights come on. A woman comes out wearing a very small bikini thing and monstrous heels. I haven't seen her here yet so she must be new. Sensual music comes on and she starts to dance, teasing the now loud audience by slipping her fingertips into the bikini bottoms. And I’m bored. I know I shouldn’t be because there’s a very pretty lady in front of me dancing in almost nothing, but I know it’s nothing compared to what's coming.
The building is very nondescript. It’s a simple brick building squished between two other simple brick buildings with blacked out windows, a dark, heavy door, and a sign above it that reads “the Den”. When I walk in, David, an older man with a crisp suit and glossy, black hair is standing in front of a velvet curtain.
“Oh desperately,” she answers with a very fake sob. “This kid is ruining my life and it’s not even here yet!”
I steady my cock with one hand and press the tip into him. He’s so tight and hot and slick around me. He gasps and pulls me closer to his warm body, wrapping the leg not on my shoulder around my waist. I push into him in a slow, continuous slide until I bottom out. I pause to let him adjust. Oh, Merlin, he’s tight. Draco clutches at my shoulder blade and pants into my neck and starts to rotate his hips.
“God, Draco, you’re so tight. So good. So fucking good. Can’t believe you're mine. Fuck.” He rams me into the wall and I’m so glad we moved out of our old apartment in London. There we had to constantly be checking our silencing spells, but here there's no one around for at least a mile.
“Merlin, Harry!” I groan when he bites hard into the crook of my neck and sucks. I slot my thigh in between his and feel him already half-hard against me. He bites a trail up my neck so that he can properly sink his tongue into my mouth. Kissing Harry is a ride. He can be very gentle or, like now, he’s ferocious. I feel as if I need to hold onto something. Like I’m going to fall off the edge of a cliff. He’s clutching at my waist and back as he ravages my mouth, continuously sliding from my hips to my back and slipping his fingers just under my t-shirt and the band of my trousers and pants before moving back. I press my thigh against his hardness again before removing my hand from his hair and snaking it between us to unfasten his trousers and slip my hand into his pants. He pulls his mouth away from mine and buries his face in my neck when I start to stroke him slowly.
“Ugh sex sounds great right about now. I haven't had a moment alone with Harry, when we both aren't knackered, since these little snots were born.” I shove the nipple of the bottle into Ablus’ mouth again and he finally, finally, gets the hint and starts to drink. “Scorp interrupted an amazing blowjob yesterday morning by breaking a mug. We didn’t even get to finish!”
“I wanted to take care of Lily and make you and Daddy coffee so you could sleep,” he whispers. “But I dropped the cup and Lily started crying and I’m sorry, Papa!” He tears trickle down his cheeks and Harry locks eyes with me. How did we manage to get such a perfect son?
“Well, guess what?” He hangs his head over mine, bed messed blond hair framing his face and a mischievous grin glinting in the moonlight. “We’re married so you’re stuck with me!”
“Yes, that sounds good! We’ll have to run it by the men first.” Hermione scoffs with a smile. “I’m very certain that neither of them will say no.”
“Who is it?” Draco calls from within.
“And then we’ll go home and do mundane husband stuff for the rest of our screwed up lives.” Draco’s hand, which was slowly rubbing my chest, moves to cup my face.
“God you’re beautiful,” he groans and takes me in his mouth. It’s hot and wet and he’s so perfect with his mouth wrapped around me and his golden skin and dark curls. He sucks hard and swishes his tongue with no rhythm and god how is he so fucking good. I throw my head back and press a hand to my lips to stop any sound from escaping when he takes me in deep and squeezes me with his throat. I’m there. I’m right there. I’m panting into my hand and I’m going to cum. I can feel the heat start to build in my core and then there's a crash and a shriek. Harry pulls off my cock and mirrors my wide eyed look of surprise and slight horror before we both spring up. Harry has the foresight to throw me my nightshirt before bolting out the door with me quick on his heels while pulling the nightshirt over my head frantically.
Draco scowled and then stepped closer to the two girls. They both stood up in turn. “My hand is fine, just a...stinging hex. As for my father...one should always respect their parents. Though, I’d understand why you both wouldn’t get that, seeing as your parents aren’t deserving of respect in the first place.”
Sighing in relief, Draco urged Dumbledore to continue. “As I understand it, Mr. Malfoy, you left the Great Hall early?” Draco nodded timidly. “Could you please tell me why you left early? Were you not enjoying the feast?”
And yet, the whole task itself wasn’t upsetting Draco. It was the diary itself. After he’d quickly shoved the book into his bedside table’s drawer, he’d immediately felt a surge of sharp relief. His nausea lessened considerably, and he felt at ease once more.
Draco’s face paled slightly, and he looked genuinely scared. Then, he quickly tried to stifle a laugh. “You’re threatening me with theory work?”
Draco made a decision.
This caution though is what saved Draco moments later when his father's question pulled him out of his captivation. If he hadn’t been alert enough to register the question, well...the outcome didn’t look pretty. “Draco, what else is left on the list?”
“Tell me what I must do.”
His nose scrunched up in thought before he decided that he’d had to have petrified Daphne some way. “Well then, sir, if she wasn’t killed...I must’ve petrified her then.”
Clearing his throat, Severus spoke, “Thank you, Albus, for your assistance. I do believe I can handle matters from here. Trust that I will take the appropriate actions from this point forth. Mr. Malfoy, let’s be on our way.”
Draco heard his heartbeat in his ears- it was loud, and ringing. He couldn’t breath, and he seriously felt like he was going insane. Slowly, Draco managed to pack his essay up, and he (thankfully) found that his bag was next to him so he could put his things away. Doing this caught the other’s attention.
Riddle looked at him curiously, and then smirked. He released his hold on Draco and stepped back. “You were honest. I will never trust you completely Draco Malfoy, for I am no fool either. People do things that will benefit themselves, and if that means betraying others then so be it. However, you are a perfect candidate, and so, I will allow your help.”
Once he felt better, he pushed off the wall and slowly made his way to the infirmary.  He cradled his hand protectively, and looked around for any passerby. He didn’t want to be seen like this.
Lucius returned his son’s ire with full force, “I would have thought you’d be ashamed that a girl of no wizard family beat you in every exam.” With this, Draco finally backed down. His father was entirely correct. He should’ve been top of his year, with excelling marks, and instead a girl with not even so much as a lick of pureblood status as he had beat him. His ears and cheeks warmed up in embarrassment, and he could've sworn he heard a silent jeer from the back of the shop. ‘Great,’ he glowered, ‘Now even the other employees know of my mishaps.’
“For a Slytherin you’re terribly positive.” Daphne sent him a look of pretend annoyance, but instead just seemed to silently consider that remark.
Groaning, Draco struggled to sit up. His head throbbed, but honestly, Draco couldn’t care. The moral thing to do now would be to turn himself in. The thought terrified him.
The ring itself was beautiful, and when it shone in the sunlight you couldn't help but be entranced. Which was exactly how Draco was for most of the day. He stared at the opulent ring in awe, loving how it seemed to dance with the sun's rays. He couldn't even concentrate on his supplies shopping he was so mesmerized. It seemed the only thing to bring him out of this state was the feeling of caution he had carried with him the rest of the trip. For, if his father found out what stunt he had pulled in Borgin and Burkes, he would surely confiscate the ring and return it to that dinghy shop.
Tremors ran along Draco’s body, coursing through him like an earthquake, and shaking him to his very core. A shaky hand gripped his hair, ran along through it, and gripped it harder. He had to get a hold of himself.
Still, through that fear of being caught and blamed, Draco felt angry. Daphne, though her curiosity was highly inconvenient-  and even annoying sometimes- didn’t deserve...she didn't deserve…
Quickly, Draco had looked up from the table to meet his father's neutral grey eyes, the ones he was quite proud to say were very much resembling of his own. “Yes father, I believe it should get here soon,” he’d answered.
It was at this point that the headmaster and potions professor made their appearance. Severus looked relieved upon seeing the boy; nobody had been able to find him for hours, and he was worried that Draco had succumbed to the same fate as Miss Greengrass. He didn’t think he could live with himself if two of his Slytherins had been harmed so severely in one night when he was supposed to be protecting them. And Draco...his godson....couldn’t be harmed. He was meant to protect him for Lucius, and Narcissa. And...because he cared for the boy, quite dearly actually.
“Granger,” he sneered. “Have Potter and Weasley finally realized how annoying your presence is? Finally abandoned you?”
There appeared to be an almost...gloomy atmosphere about the place. And Draco could’ve sworn he’d seen a vampire (at least from what he’d imagined a vampire would look like based off the details in a book he had read) lurking in the shadows of one of the nearby shops. He himself seemed to feel weighed down by the change in the atmosphere, like a weight of dread was encasing him.
Red on his fingers. Red behind Daphne.
“You don’t know much about these Slytherins yet,” the older student sneered, “but you can’t trust them. The little snake would've jinxed you as soon as she got the chance!”
Ginevra Weasley was scrambling along with her mother. When they made it to the train she handed a dull, navy blue trunk to her brother- the oldest one, Draco believed. ‘Well then, now that that’s settled. I just have to wait.’
Draco spluttered, he wouldn’t dare to defy his father- especially not in public. And he’d have no reason to defy him, surely. His father had always wanted the best for him, and had raised him to live up to the family name. He knew his place in society, and he knew what was expected of him because of it.
As he’d pondered this, Madam Pomfrey had retrieved a Pepper-up potion and shoved it in Draco’s hands. Draco nodded at her in thanks and took the potion, immediately feeling the build up of heat being released from his ears. He stayed in the hospital wing for a moment longer, and when the potion's side effects had dulled- and he felt the drowsiness seep away- he had given the empty bottle back to Madam Pomfrey and headed to the Great Hall.
“Fawkes?” Draco uttered; his voice was quiet and raspy. Dumbledore nodded, and the phoenix swooped over his head before landing on his shoulder. The bird, Fawkes, then tucked his head under his wing momentarily in a little bowing gesture. Draco couldn’t help but be awed by the creature. Sure, he’d seen a phoenix or two before, but they always left him feeling light and free. They truly were beautiful.
Yes, this could work. Draco gulped, “Then all I need to do is give this diary to the Weasley then? Couldn’t I simply give it to Potter himself? That’s who the Dark Lord wants.”
Yet, he did eventually do it. One thought of his father’s furious face and his mother’s disappointed gaze gave him a rush of motivation. He opened the diary and let his fingers graze over the pages. Redipping his quill in the ink he pressed the tip of the quill to the parchment, and his breath hitched as he wrote out a simple greeting.
Still, Draco had a mischievous thing called pride. And, though he wouldn’t do anything brash, he wasn’t going to fully submit either. “I only stated the truth,” Draco spit out.
Draco opened his mouth to counteract Dumbledore once more, but abruptly stopped when the man’s words registered. “After...Daphne,” he mumbled.
Lucius hummed, and he stepped ever closer to Draco's bed. “I understand you’ve been trying to apologize using a pureblood custom?”
He read it, but couldn’t remember writing it. Any of it. The wording sounded like his- maybe a bit more sophisticated- but that wasn’t too noticeable. Looking around, Draco realized everyone seemed perfectly normal; he was the only one out of sorts.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
Ironically enough, Dumbledore’s words made him feel guiltier. He knew talking to the man was a mistake because Dumbledore just didn’t get it. He didn’t allow Draco to mention his distorted memories, and he wouldn’t listen now. He had been entirely dismissed.
A slight clapping made Draco startle out of his concentration. He’d been about to continue reading, but the noise had made him forget about his book entirely. When he looked up his father was standing in his doorway, an amused smile on his face as he applauded his son.
Draco’s brows furrowed as he bit his lower lip slightly. He hesitated, but continued the conversation.
“I don’t know Lucius…” Narcissa worried. She often didn’t express her concern over many things, but when it came to her son, she was the typical protective mother.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
“I don’t know Goyle. I think I lost it in on the way to the castle,” Draco lied. There was no point denying the diary’s existence. If he did that he’d only look more suspicious. Goyle nodded and didn’t question him further.
———————————————————————————————————----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“And it’s colorless? And you can’t...feel anything?”
“Your wandless magic has improved,” Lucius stated. Draco perked up; coming from his father that was practically a compliment.
“Understandable, you won't find anything in any book. Certain customs are passed down orally from generation to generation. It’s considered too basic to have to explain it in any book.” Lucius waved his hand flippantly in an unconcerned manner, brushing the matter aside. “Seeing as your mother and I have yet to teach you this custom, it would make sense that you did not know it.”
He lit the lantern with a wave of his hand, and he shut the curtains around his bed. This time he disregarded his hesitation, and started to write.
He thought he had no energy to be upset. In reality, that changed when the classroom door opened once more and the Gryffindor students trailed in. They were as loud as ever, and they scrambled to get into a seat and pull their potions’ texts out.
Lucius smiled softly- but the way in which he did so made the smile look more disconcerting than his smirk ever had. Draco suppressed a shiver. “Draco, I can't tell you much about this task. You’ll know more once it's completed. But this diary is extremely important, and it was entrusted to me by the Dark Lord himself.”
To be honest, he’d sort of expected worse. To feel ill maybe- possibly even having constant nightmares. But that wasn’t the case. Draco felt tremendously tired, but the Pepper up potion should clear that up swiftly. And he had slept rather soundly too. No nightmares, no nothing.
Granger startled. But then she relaxed as she proudly lifted her chin up and glared at the trio of Slytherins. “How’s your hand Malfoy?”
But his mother was clearly sleeping in this morning, as she wasn't in the library. And Draco had the opportunity to relax. ‘Good, I need it after that horrid night.’
“I’m guessing you have questions?” Tom Riddle asked, giving Draco a charming smile. Draco nodded slowly. “Then ask away Draco, we’re meant to be friends aren’t we?”
At his core, Draco knew. Draco was the culprit, even if he didn’t remember how he’d harmed Daphne, or why he’d harmed her. Normally, Draco didn’t care to “follow his instincts, and trust his heart.” No, he’d much prefer to trust his knowledge. Jumping right into things because of an instinct was a Gryffindor tendency, and Draco Malfoy was no Gryffindor. But now, when there were only obscure facts to latch on to, Draco was left with only his feelings. So he knew that he’d done this, and he also knew that just because he was trusting his heart right now, he still wasn’t a Gryffindor. Because Gryffindors were the heroes, weren’t they? And heroes don't hurt the people they love.
“Look at me,”  Lucius snarled as he forced his son’s head upwards, so that his icy gaze was looking into Draco’s widened eyes. “Pathetic.”
Draco chuckled before giving him a curt nod, and the two exchanged goodbyes before the Slytherin walked out of the potion’s classroom. Severus sighed once the heavy classroom door had closed. “Lucius, what in Merlin’s name are you doing to your son?”
Narcissa narrowed her eyes at that, but before he could ponder it further she spoke. “Lucius is a fool. You have not shamed the family name, you only embarrassed your father. Unfortunately, he gets rather offended when he’s embarrassed- and acts like a child.” She added that last part on absentmindedly, but her tone was sharp nonetheless.
“Draco, compose yourself at once,” said Lucius. Though, it was in a less biting tone than usual. Draco guessed he’d understood where his son was coming from. It was his first trip to Knockturn alley after all.
Anulo Fatum
His plan was perfect. He would go find a compartment with Vincent, Gregory, Pansy, and Blaise. Then he would chat with them for a bit before leaving to go change into his Hogwarts robes. Afterwards, he would drag Vincent and Gregory to Potter’s compartment- where the Weaslette would surely be- and have them pick a fight with Potter and Weasley. Granger would attempt to stop anyone from breaking any rules, and the Weasley girl would be watching the altercation closely to ensure her brother and friends wouldn’t be hurt. He would take that time to pull the diary out from his robes and spell it into the first year’s trunk.
Draco promptly removed the ring from his finger and was mildly surprised to see that the ring hadn’t left a mark behind. With how badly it was burning earlier, Draco was sure the spot would at least be red. ‘Though, my magic could’ve already healed my hand if damage had been done,’ Draco mused. Summoning his magic forth, Draco called for his primary house elf, “Dobby.”
Once the instructions for brewing the potion were on the blackboard Draco turned to look at the menace next to him. “You fetch the ingredients Potter, surely you can’t mess up a task that simple.”
Draco’s plan was flawless. What he didn’t expect was for Givervra Weasley to be so open minded- especially towards Slytherins. Because of that, he’s back to square one with only one decision left.
