“I'm not the one to do things like that,” Harry stated, rolling his eyes. “I wouldn't ask if I didn't genuinely want to know these things. Didn't I JUST say that I think we should be friends?”
Harry smiled at the both of them. “Listen, I don't care which of you does it, but would one of you pop in and wake us at 6 AM? Er, best make that half 5. I want us both to have plenty of time to sneak back to our dorms before anyone else wakes up and notices we're gone.”
He furtively rushed to Knockturn Alley, looking over his shoulder several times to make sure his mother wasn't following him. Thankfully, he made it to Borgin and Burkes without his mother catching him. Mr. Borgin wasn't exactly happy to see him, but since Draco's family had spent a lot in his shop, he did his best to seem eager to help.
?!” Ron asked with a groan of disgust. Then he sighed in acceptance. “Yeah, I sort of thought things might be leading in that direction, considering how obsessed you've been over him. Then the way you couldn't keep your eyes off him all night! Let's just pray that you'll feel differently in the morning when the Lust Potion has worn off...”
Harry smiled so brightly that it was nearly blinding and kissed Draco again, irregardless of that fact that he was in front of Draco's parents. Then he sang the song Draco had been singing, soft but determined.
“Something wrong Potter?” Draco asked with a smug smirk. He could clearly afford to buy his own drinks, but it amused him to be a pest. He'd probably generously offer to buy a round in a minute anyway.
Rather than explain what must be obvious by this point, Harry simply pulled the long and semi erect shaft out through the opening in the silk black pants that were as soft as a cloud. He gave it a few good tugs to help it finish getting hard, and then dove right into a task he had NEVER even considered trying before. Both his head and his hands bobbed back and forth with a firm and somewhat rough pressure.
This unsurprisingly provoked a loud cheer that circled around the place at least twice before dying down. As the waitresses were busy grabbing bottles and glasses for everyone, a woman whose job was to entertain the guests got up on the bar and grabbed all their attention by swaying her body suggestively.
Draco was utterly shocked the next morning for several reasons. For one, he'd actually slept through the night. For two, Harry was still in his arms – and they were snuggled up like cherished lovers. Finally, two house elves were staring at him expectantly – one of which was his father's old elf Dobby.
All the anger that Draco'd still had inside him even a moment ago died completely. “Erm... Is that a proposal?”
Harry looked at Draco, tilting his head curiously. Draco gave him a small smile that was shockingly shy – considering how confident he usually was. Harry tentatively returned the smile.
But as he sat here, he realized that he didn't want to do that. If Harry won, he wanted to be a part of it, no matter how small. Even just a bystander. On the other hand, if the Dark Lord won, he could claim that he'd been in the castle trying his best to capture Harry, and Greg would be able to verify that they had indeed stayed behind to do just that. No one would need to know that he had changed his allegiance so completely.
He shook his head. “Nope, it was to give a girl in this class a sincere compliment.”
For better or for worse, Dumbledore took the blame for Harry and left the school via Phoenix magic. Thus, Harry was left wondering about many things. Such as how much blame Cho had for her friend snitching. And more importantly, just exactly HOW mad was he at Draco?!
Blaise sighed as if trying to gather up and maintain the patience of a saint. “Look Weasley, it's harmless. It'll only last until they feel better. Don't you want your best friend to feel better?”
Draco harrumphed a laugh. “You care about me saying Mudblood when I'm about to kill you?”
important things...
But rather than take this seriously, Draco simply snogged the breath right out of Harry's lungs. Harry's brain immediately went blank. Before he could even attempt to remember why he was so mad, he caved in and gave Draco every bit as good as he got.
Harry rubbed his temples and sighed. “Look, all I did was what
Draco let out a heavy sigh. “Look, I hope you know I have nothing against you, but if I'm required to marry you, I probably won't visit you more often than strictly necessary to create those Heirs we're supposed to have.”
“No! I think I'm missing half my outfit!” Ron protested.
Harry gasped in shock when Draco replaced his fingers with his tongue. He licked a path from Harry's bellybutton on up to his left nipple. The motion of his tongue was fluttery light and left a faint, moist trail that Draco gently blew on.
Then all their attention turned to a woman floating upside down over the table. She had displeased the Dark Lord by not only teaching Muggle Studies at Hogwarts, but also by writing an article for the Daily Prophet encouraging the Wizarding World to not just accept and tolerate muggleborns (and even muggles), but ALSO marry them and have children.
Harry pushed his chair back an inch or so to give them a bit of space, and then exhaled a heavy sigh. “Listen... I... I don't really know what to think about that. I'm NOT trying to be an arsehole or make you feel bad, I just... I don't know...” he gave up trying to explain with a shake of his head. “I don't think I should ask you any more questions. CLEARLY you really DO have a lot of ammunition that could be used against you, and I don't want to use – I don't want YOU to think I'm going to use it against you.” He ran a hand through his perpetually messy hair.
She handed the microphone off to Cho, who sang a song called
Blaise pulled a vial of potion out of his pocket and held it up for Ron to see. “This is completely harmless. I wouldn't give it to Draco if it weren't. I'll take an unbreakable vow that it's harmless if you don't believe me – but as I said, no one needs trouble this year.”
Harry gave a polite smile to the man that insisted on giving him a pint of ale.
Harry squeezed Draco's hand before taking off at a run to go help out if necessary.
Harry was moaning and rubbing Draco's back encouragingly. Pleased that things seemed to be going in the right direction, Draco kept pushing his luck. He worked open Harry's trousers and pants until he could work that thick and puffy shaft with his hands and mouth. Harry gasped and arched his back as this never before experienced sensation made his mind practically explode from the pleasure. Just when he was getting close to orgasm, Draco shifted his mouth again.
Harry looked strangely sheepish and muttered: “Malfoy...”
Pansy joined him for a little dance during the pause in the singing. Then waited so she could dance with him again during then next – longer – break.
“Don't go just yet! I've been trying for ages to figure out how to ask you something, but I think that no matter how I ask it, you'll get mad at me,” Harry rambled on.
Draco had been vaguely stomping toward Slytherin House while hoping that the coast would clear enough for him to get back to that infernal cabinet. Suddenly, invisible hands had grabbed him and hauled him into an empty classroom. Now that the door was locked and Harry had pulled off his cloak, Draco was hoping they might have a fun diversion from his problems.
Harry hummed in understanding and held his breath as he mentally prepared for the second half of his dare. When it happened, it was hot and acrid, but not enough to make him gag. In fact, it was sort of salty with a hint of something undefinable that Harry inexplicably liked. He kept sucking and swallowing until every last drop was gone. Then he probed the puffy little slit with his tongue in a search for more.
Amanda was obviously torn on how to react. She quickly set aside her misgivings (and the star-struck staring at Harry) and gave Draco a reassuring smile. “I know you meant no harm, luv. I remember how courteous you were to my parents when you met them.”
Harry was inexplicably fascinated to see that Ernie and Padma were still at it, and Terry was positively SEETHING as he watched them. Clearly, he had been hoping for that dare. Harry also had to guess that Ron's dare had been written be Ernie – as only a Hufflepuff – or maybe a girl in general – would have come up with such fluffy dare.
“Then, that means the moderates are far more likely to win,” Hermione points out. “They’ll look reasonable next to the extremists and garner more votes.”
“Hence, I only call Critter in our dorm, the corner of the library no one can see, and the Come and Go Room.”
“Thank you,” Draco smiles at him. He holds out an arm for Hari to take. Hari allows himself to be escorted to a carriage and politely helped in. Draco takes the seat directly next to him and, while the carriages usually wait to have four to six people, it leaves immediately.
“Hermione doesn’t know she can call you yet,” Hari explains. “I’ll let her know you’d like her to.”
“Told you so,” Hari grumbles. Draco pouts, but then grins and rushes to greet the others.
“Ugh,” Hermione groans when they land, stumbling. Hari’s grip on her hand is the only thing that keeps her from falling over.
“Hari, are you ready?” Draco pokes his head in the door. “Hermione should be here any second.”
“Okay, I have the notes for Professor McGonagall, let’s get through that first,” Draco slides out a heavily notated sheet of parchment and stacks two more behind it, “then we do translating for Latin, and the problems for Runes. We’ll read Herbology first, then Beasts.” Beasts is one they can usually get away with doing the minimum of the reading for. “We discuss Muggle Studies last.”
“She’s been here a year! Why wouldn’t he have tested her last year?” Pansy grumbles.
“I’d come closer to mock you better,” Hari says conversationally, “but I imagine the stench coming off you would render me unable to smell ever again. Is it true you turn into a rat? Well, they say your animagus form speaks to who you are as a person, so I guess it makes sense. Only a rat could turn on its family like you did.” Hari turns his nose up, glaring at Pettigrew. “And you imagined I would just cave? Be so emotional over seeing you again that I’d forgive you? You cost me my parents! I’ll never forgive that!”
“Narcissa suggested it,” Hari tells her, “she thought you’d like to get to watch since you want to be Minister someday.”
“Master Hari!” Critter appears, “you is being at home!” The little elf’s ears wiggle in excitement and Hari giggles, then starts laughing outright.
“Why does everyone insist on picking me up?”
Draco seems pleased with Hari’s soft responses to each little movement and pulls back a little.
“Just bring me,” Draco decides, “every time. That’ll solve everything.” Hari laughs a little at this. Draco starts to run his fingers through Hari’s hair. The movement is repetitive and soothing, like being petted as Beau or Ajay. A soft rumble rolls through Hari’s chest and Draco freezes for a moment.
“Yes, well, my love life is much more boring. I’m not even sure I like him and I haven’t seen any signs he likes me.”
“We have plenty of budget,” Hari chuckles, “the numbers Dumbledore has been giving you are fudged. Hogwarts has plenty of money—enough for every class in the original charter and more.”
“Which classes did you choose, Hermione?” Blaise asks.
“That’s exactly it!” Blaise crows. “It’s like he was born to this.”
“Let’s get something to eat,” Sirius suggests. “We can do the other Potter properties later.” At the end of the night, Draco is protecting Potter Manor, Daphne has Potter Cottage, Blaise has the Potter Minor Manor, and Pansy is keeping Lion’s Den, one of Hari’s Gryffindor properties that hasn’t fallen into disrepair.
“I know,” Hari smiles and snuggles his face into Draco’s neck. “You’ll never leave me.”
Since so many people wanted to see the schedule, I've posted it on tumblr. It's fully explained on there.
“Well, there’s the places people normally go to, like Zonko’s and The Three Broomsticks and such,” Draco smirks, “and then there’s the places we’ll go.”
“I doubt it,” Daphne says, “there’s a lot more moderates out there than admit to being moderate. And maybe my father didn’t vote with you, but I’m sure Lord Malfoy did.”
“No,” Hari shakes his head and Draco wraps him up from behind. “He just tried to talk to me. I didn’t give him a chance to try anything before petrifying him.”
“I bet my father loved that!” Hari stares at her, wide eyed.
Professor McGonagall finishes making the speech about the changes the school will be facing this new year as Hari takes his seat next to Draco. With Daphne on his other side, he instantly feels more secure.
“We can make out later,” Hari promises. Draco thinks about this for a second, then his pout deepens.
“Well, I’m not certain I’m pleased that there’s someone out there trying to get my daughter, but I’ll trust you to protect our house as best you can.”
“Hem, hem.” All eyes turn to the Ministry section, glaring at some witch in all pink.
Hari starts to wander through the building. From what he’d read on Family Suites in the Charter, they almost always are near the student’s dorm. Only Crabbe, Goyle, Millicent, and Tracey won’t have theirs available to them. Of course, students would still have the option of using the general dormitory, but how could you say no to having a private room? Well, that, and they were originally developed for the safety of the family Heir, so you really couldn’t say no at one point.
Pansy stands with a long-suffering sigh, “I’ll go collect the little Prince.”
“I want to make out now, though.”
“It wasn’t that difficult,” Draco brushes it off. Hari stares him down. “Fine, I bribed Hagrid.”
“I don’t know,” Draco shrugs, “I don’t even know if he likes me back.”
“No need,” Hari grins, “we’re all hungry. Let’s go get lunch. You can eat with us.” They get to the Heir’s Lounge to find the others have already arrived.
“There you are,” Narcissa smiles at the group. The children take their seats around the table, but Draco has yet to put Beau down, so Hari can’t turn back. He gives a slight, irritated yowl of displeasure.
“Well, yeah, but that doesn’t mean—“
“Is there anyone at the school who can do the test?” Hermione asks.
“A more relaxed area for us, then?” Hari smirks.
“Perfect.” Hari approaches the desk and pulls back the massive chair. It looks comfortable and inviting and Hari almost gives into the temptation to sit in it. The desk itself has an open area for writing, notches to keep extra pages or books on either side, and divots directly in the wood for quills and an inkpot.
“Thank you,” Hari replies, “For being patient and letting me work through that.”
His lips are soft and definitely not chapped. They press gently but insistently against Hari’s, coaxing him forward and into Draco.
Let me know your thoughts!
“Teenage boy appetite equals voracious appetite,” Draco points out and Hari tilts his head.
“And I’ve heard you every time,” Blaise says, “I just didn’t believe you at first.”
“Okay,” Hari replies warily. Draco reaches out and fingers the curl in front of Hari’s ear left out of the intricate bun.
“I was taken directly from the arms of my legal guardian and placed on the doorstep wrapped in a thin blanket and left with a letter. No heating, shielding, or disillusionment charms were placed to ensure my safety. The belief of the person who placed me there was that blood wards enacted by my
“Are there no primary schools for you?”
Ayyy another chapter! Stuff has happened in my writing! I think I might actually be able to wrap up book three pretty soon, but it will definitely be pushing at least 70k. I'm pleased with that :D    I'm also excited to start book four because, well, Umbridge, right?
“Either way, Miss Monroe was kind in offering her help and someday, I hope to repay her in kind.” Hari pushes open the door to the clothing shop. “Besides, there are other reasons she could need to contact me.”
“I guess you’re right.”
“Isn’t it?” Another agrees, “Even with the addition of WizCul, it’s so much better than previous years. I don’t feel so overwhelmed.”
“Where do I get the paperwork to request a new port-key?”
“’Mione, why are you taking Muggle Studies?”
“You and I,” Draco gestures between them, then yanks Hari into his lap, “are already doing our part.”
“But what about bedclothes?” Draco whispers, like spending one night without pajamas will kill him.
“That’d be your mother’s influence,” Hari grins brightly and they both laugh a little.
But he comes right back, pressing just a little harder and teasing Hari’s lips with his tongue. Hari parts willingly, allowing Draco’s flavor to flow into him.
“It’s a wix town, Hari,” Draco sighs, “people come from all over to shop here. There’s not exactly a lot of places for wix to shop at, anyway.”
“Yes, Master Hari, on both floors.”
“Alright, then.”
They pass the rest of the meal in relative silence. As they’re rising to leave for their dormitories, the cold that had been seeping through the stones starts to fade. Hari looks outside and watches the Dementors leave.
“Hari!” Draco shrieks when Hari walks in the door. Hari winces at the sudden noise, but takes the hug without complaint. “I got you the best birthday present ever.”
“How about this,” Pansy starts, “we almost never see the two of you apart. One of us can go over there and talk to him, see how the conversation goes, see if we can feel him out.”
“During those ten years, I acted as a house elf, working non-stop to ensure their home was perfect. I kept the garden and the lawn, cleaned the house, made all the food, and was never allowed a single bite. Starvation keeps you weak and docile. With a child, it is easy to explain away as ‘picky eating’.
“I understand,” Draco smiles. “Go, be the badass Lord you are. Then come back and promise to show me the memory in a Pensieve later.”
“I will be calling the next witnesses in the order they discovered the crimes,” Master Tomeaxe declares, then calls Pansy to the floor.
“Are you ready for the ball tomorrow?” Daphne finally asks. Hari groans.
Hari gets three slices to start. And then has to go back for two more. It’s just really good, okay?
“We need your input on which students are scions and which aren’t,” he calls. Hari changes back and walks out next to him.
Critter’s ears droop, “okay, Master Hari.”
“Thank you.” Hari rises with the others and they wish him goodnight.
“Both of whom only have good things to say about you,” he assures her and extends his hand. After the general niceties are out of the way, the chime rings through the Ministry.
“That’s one way to say it,” she shakes her head, “I can’t decide if floo was better or not.”
“Hari!” Hermione yelps when he walks into the room. She jumps up from straightening the pile of gifts on the middle of Draco’s bed. “Happy Birthday!”
Thank you, everyone, for your support. I haven't said it yet, but I'll say it now--I love every one of you. Your comments and kudos mean so, so much to me. They really do keep me going on hard days. And all your support just from last night means the world to me. Thank you, again.
“What actually happened?” Pansy asks. “Because Luna wouldn’t tell us anything.”
His sitting room is decorated much like the one at home, all dark woods and vibrant cobalt. The study room is simple, with a stand for his class books and a desk to work at in the same woods as the other furniture. The desk is large and nice, with indents for his inkpot and quills, and a cushioned seat. His bathroom is soothing grays with accents of blue. His bedroom, however, is the nicest of all. It is a deep navy with tapestries and furs strewn around to bring warmth. Fur blankets cover the bed and the pillows pile up half-way down it.
“Very well,” Professor McGonagall nods. It seems this wasn’t quite the answer she was looking for.
Hari lets a beat pass once the new seat has shone for everyone to see, then starts towards it. Up the stairs on the left of the center column, away from the Ministry and surrounded by Nobility. It may have made waves it he’d chosen to walk up the right side, but this way is traditional for a new Lord and he’s not sure he likes the looks on the faces of the wix in the smallest section.
“Right,” Hermione nods and stands, scooping up her shoes. “Thank you, Lady Malfoy. I’ll see you at the train, Hari, Draco.” She steps to the middle of the floor and traces a finger along one of her bracelets. “The Grange.” With that, she’s gone.
“Though, I’m not sure the jewelry will really blend with my appearance.” She looks down at her muggle clothes doubtfully.
“Who do you think it is?” The Lord nearest him leans in and murmurs. Lord Macmillan, if Hari remembers correctly. Hari studies his face for a moment.
“Critter will be back with afternoon tea,” Critter confirms and vanishes, coming back only minutes later with piping hot tea and biscuits.
“Dray. C’mon. I can walk and we’re going to the same place.”
Hermione sighs, “I shouldn’t. It’s tempting, but I can come back and explore the library another time. After all,” she smirks at him, “you gave me a port-key.”
Applause echoes again and he trots back proudly. Draco scoops him up and he lets out a rumbling purr.
“Put up with me for a moment, I’m going to give you a bunch of compliments.”
“We can have children with both our DNA,” Hari gasps, eyes wide. “And we don’t need a surrogate mother?”
“Um, because you’re a good person?” Blaise guesses.
“I believe I will review on my own, Lord Potter. I apologize again.” He retakes his seat.
, Hari thinks in her direction. “If you’ll excuse me, I don’t want to keep my friends waiting.”
She nods slowly, “that’s acceptable.”
A thin book floats in front of Hari’s face and he almost walks into it. To his right, Lucius is smirking at him.
“I don’t know if I could stand seeing my reflection in everything all the time, but yes, this is nice,” Hari admits.
He opens it to reveal a thin silver chain, encrusted all along in diamonds. The charm on the end is small and simple, but clearly engraved with the Malfoy crest. Circling it are even more diamonds.
“Perhaps that is something that could be left to the Heads of Houses?” Hari offers. “I hesitate to pair them up before they arrive at Hogwarts. There is too much likelihood of personalities clashing. Instead, why not wait two weeks to let them adjust somewhat, and then assign pairs. They can do their work for wizarding culture together.”
This one's coming pretty late in the day and I'm sorry for that, but getting the new chapter as good as possible I believe to be a valid reason. Anyway, it's been a long day and I hope to get so much more writing done tomorrow. Oh, I should ask, though. Would anyone like me to add a link or something like that so you all can see the new class schedule I designed?
“This,” he tells her, “is a Northern Saw-whet Owl. They make a distinctive call and are one of the smaller owls. I just thought he was cute.” He hands the little thing to Hermione, who seems to be tearing up. “Sorry I didn’t give him to you sooner.”
“Yes,” Hari says slowly, “but I’m not certain she would have been comfortable with this. I mean, homes like this are pretty rare in the muggle world.”
“Everyone got it?” Draco asks. There’s affirmatives all around and the others pack up. “Let’s go, then. Bedtime.”
“Well, he wasn’t known for being the intelligent one.”
“I know,” Hari smirks.
Hari catches Draco’s hand before he can go to his own room and drags him into the Potter Suite.
“About that charm,” Hari shifts uncomfortably, “who should be Secret Keeper?”
“It is,” Hari nudges her forward slightly, “keep looking, there’s more.”
“These are just suggestions, you’d probably know better than I, but light things like tea and biscuits and fruits and little sweets, with possibly warm milk or hot chocolate for those having trouble sleeping?”
“Master Hari will call for Critter if he is wanting anything,” Critter orders.
“I would love to date you, Draco.”
Hari sighs, relieved, and they dig into the food.
They dig into their desserts, chatting quietly.
Aaaand I'm back. Sorry, that was what, three days? Today being the fourth? Whoops. Okay, but I don't really feel too bad about that. This miss was mostly because of writer's block, which I mentioned before. On the upside, I just wrote an entire chapter in about an hour and a half. And I have ideas for the next chapter and how the last few of the book will go. The best news? This fic has officially broken the 60k mark, reaching just shy of 65k. It's officially the longest of the series!
The group laughs and Draco explains, “that class is kind of known to be a joke. None of the information is accurate. You’ll likely have a lot of trouble separating what you know from the lies they want you to know.”
“Well,” Pansy grimaces, “that’s not entirely wrong, either. We do usually have tutors from age five on who instruct us in all the theory they can, as well as writing, reading, arithmetic, history, and government. And etiquette.” The whole group winces at that.
“Two way mirrors would work,” Draco muses, “but those are pretty rare.”
Hari takes in the brilliance of the cream colored marble walls, detailed with golden patterns. The chandelier is gold with dangling crystals and the furniture is a warm, dark wood. The only non-neutral color in the room is the cobalt of the vases and carpeting. There’s three sets of doors, one in either direction and one straight ahead. Two grand staircases wrap around the third doors.
“If this is the guest rooms, imagine the Family’s rooms,” Pansy whispers.
“Subtly,” Hari grumbles, “I don’t want him feeling bad that I can’t understand how he’s pronouncing the cat’s name.”
“I adore your smile. You always look so free and happy, it’s breathtaking.
“Yes,” Draco turns to her, gratefulness resounding in his voice. “Thank you.”
Their conversation drifts as the food comes out, wandering between subjects. All in all, the night ends up going very well. The dessert Draco chooses is crème brulee topped with raspberries and Hari, who’s never had that before in his life, practically falls in love.
“Well, of course I did not make this up!” She gasps as if horribly offended. It’s not difficult to see that she’s actually just angry at being called out. “That book is old knowledge and has since been proven false. Why, just look at the statistics.”
“That was brilliant, Hari,” Hermione tells him with wide eyes.
“If it means I get my way,” he makes direct eye contact with Hari, “I don’t care.”
“I recognize that you do not follow the traditions of the wix world and that is, of course, your choice. However, it is basic human decency to apologize when you cause someone else injury or inconvenience.” Hari glares at her, “and considering you just bodily slammed me into the wall, I would consider that personal injury.”
“Bleeding heart,” Draco teases and they wade into the racks of clothing. In the end, they don’t buy anything from there, but decide that they’ll come back when winter gets closer. At six, they make their way into the restaurant Draco had pointed out.
“To begin today’s session, we will be reviewing nominations for Chief Warlock,” Minister Fudge announces. Hari rolls his eyes.
That could, honestly, go one of two ways. Either nothing will happen at all or what happens will be so minor, it’s nothing to worry over. Well, or Luna could have a warped sense of danger like Hagrid does. Hari shudders when he imagines some of the creatures in the Care class and is glad, once again, that he’d chosen not to take it.
“Am I?”
“I know,” Draco whines. “That’s why I’m—“
“Lord Potter, please, just see my side of it,” he begs.
“No,” Hari shakes his head, “it’s not small, but it’s no manor. There’s not a lot of open space in London, if there is any at all. So houses that are very nice and expensive, sometimes aren’t as large.”
The Lords and Ladies nearby are looking on with interest. Umbridge is turning bright red. For the second time in as many meetings, Hari is making her look uncultured and unknowledgeable.
Hari and Hermione clasp hands and repeat the process once more, sealing away the location of Hermione’s home within Hari’s mind.
“What are you going to do about it?” Blaise asks.
“It’s a case or session or legal proceeding that does not allow the public in,” Draco says, “but there have to be witnesses to just about everything the Wizengamot does, so even if the public is barred, members of a certain ranking within their House are allowed in.”
“What?” Draco’s eyes are wide.
, the top boldly asymmetrical and a striking cobalt with matching shoes and black bottoms, all stitched in gold. Hermione is wearing a set of A-line closed robes with a high collar and elegantly fit-to-flare bell sleeves in a smooth cream with all gold and cobalt jewelry. Draco had warned him that as his first formal event after taking his seat, Hari would need to make a statement. Hari holds his hand out for Lady Longbottom to shake, the henna on his hands travelling from the back to his palms in an almost lacey design his father had apparently worn often.
It's going to be a long time before there's any update to this fic. I actually started this fic at the beginning of a major depressive episode. It feels more like I disassociated for a solid month/month and a half. I remember next to nothing of that time. This was about a year and a half ago now, and I'm doing much better. But I'm presented with a problem: I don't remember writing this. I don't remember the process of writing it or
“I’ve heard of her,” Lady Zabini perks up, “she serves as an interrogator for trials. She’s always keen on ensuring everyone has a fair trial.”
“Yes, Critter,” Hari smiles at the little elf, “we’re here for dinner. Could you have it ready in about a half an hour? I need you to let Lord Malfoy that we will not be dining with them tonight.”
“I believe you’ll be finding out in just a minute, Minister Fudge,” Hari smiles sweetly. Time to play up the innocent act once more. “However, I will say that I chose someone I believe is capable of maintaining neutrality, a trait I believe to be important in such a position.”
“Actually, that’d probably make it worse,” Hermione counters.
“You’re going to love this,” he promises. “Go ahead, open.”
“And jewelry shopping,” Hari nods, “it needs to be something she can wear every day, like the ones for Potter Manor and Grimmauld Place.”
“When two women want to have a child, one woman provides an egg from which genetic material is removed. It is then placed within the egg in the uterus of the other woman and they have a child that way. For men, it’s almost the same process.
“I’ve done it to almost every teacher I can,” Hari defends, “if I have a free hour during their class time, I sneak in to watch. You’re doing spectacularly, by the way. Even outside this room, I hear wonderful things about you and your teaching. Primarily for the older years, but even the firsties say you’re not as bad as they’d been told to expect.”
Minister Fudge holds in an angry shout and orders the Aurors who were coming in to inform the department that Dumbledore is on the ‘most wanted’ list. He turns to Hari.
Bill Weasley’s testimony is interesting and definitely has everyone’s attention, as he is the only one who had truly seen the conditions Hari had lived in. He receives so many questions, Master Tomeaxe has to cut them off to prevent accidentally revealing Hari’s identity.
“Would you prefer a privacy screen be placed between the Wizengamot and the floor?” Dumbledore asks. Hari nods subtly and Master Tomeaxe agrees.
“Which would mean she had thirty-eight votes,” Hari hums.
“Alright, see you then,” Hermione agrees. Draco holds out his hand and announces the key-word for his port-key.
“Would you like to come back with me?” The cat meows and rubs their cheeks together. Hari glances to Critter. “Could I see Galeru now?”
Draco pouts at his words, “when will I get to do a cool ritual with Hari?”
Finally, they settle in to discuss how formal address and treatment should occur in Hogwarts. It almost turns into a screaming match, but Hari manages to find the middle ground just in the nick of time.
“He is,” Blaise confirms, but he looks unsure.
“Quite true,” Hermione smiles, “I find myself second guessing my work far less.”
“As you must call me Theo,” he smiles back, “may I sit with you?”
“Lord Potter,” Lucius snaps, “your opinions?” Lucius is glaring slightly at him. Hari tries not to wince. He has no clue who was being discussed.
The group eats while simultaneously complaining about the mistreatment of their children. After eating, they create plans for the new dormitory arrangements and draft the letter that would be included in letters to scions.
Sure enough, Madam Bones makes it into the top ten, if only by grace of Hari’s mass amount of titles. Thankfully, all votes are anonymous, so no one can tell who he voted for.
The spokeself studies him for a minute, “we elveses are understanding. May we elveses monitor students to help when needed?”
Hari smiles nervously and sets his hand in Draco’s, letting him lead them to the floor and into the dance. He’s never followed before, but knowing the steps to lead makes it somewhat easier.
“We can tell,” the single Hufflepuff grins. “Plus, I like that my partner for WizCul is from Slytherin. Inter-House unity and mixing blood and mixing titles. It’s splendid.”
“Thank goodness they got rid of Divination,” Draco shudders, “it’s such a flimsy class.”
? I’m not certain I’ll always be able to come and see you before an event, so it’d be best to have some formal wear on standby.”
“Good to see you, Lord Potter,” Lady Longbottom replies, she and her heir bowing.
“I, Hermione Jean Granger, hear this call and do joyfully respond. I rise to join your House and protection,” she recites. Hari carefully starts pulling her up to her feet.
“I don’t like it,” Draco pouts.
“A few of the questions I asked happen to be on that test,” Draco says, “She answered as a Seer would. That doesn’t mean she is, but it makes it more likely. At the very least, she should be tested.”
“The bill has been discarded,” Dumbledore announces and Umbridge mutters angrily in her seat. Hari glances at her, irritated, but turns back to Dumbledore. It’s already almost twelve-thirty, the silly woman managed to talk for over two hours about her lies, and Hari wants lunch.
“You don’t.”
“You should stay down here, I’ll need to remind you of the location after I do it,” Hari warns.
“How about an overview of some of the changes you would like to make, then we can be more in-depth?” Lady Longbottom suggests.
Each of the nominees are called forward to give short speeches. There are a few who speak as if they are neutral, attempting to appeal to both sides of the room, but anyone who knows them knows their true standings. Very few people in the room are actually neutral on any subjects. There are, though, two others who manage to be honestly neutral. Though the most interesting speeches are the ones given by those who are nearly extremists.
“Alright, then,” Hari holds out his hand for her to take, “
“If I leave you lot here, you won’t destroy my house, will you?” Sirius gives the small group a once-over. Draco freezes with two biscuits stuffed into his mouth, looking up guiltily. Sirius starts to laugh and soon enough, they all are. Except for Draco, who starts choking. After clearing that up, Sirius, Hari, and Hermione floo to the Granger House.
“If a student isn’t a scion but has indicated it on their letter, you will know as soon as the scions see their dormitory,” Hari assures her, “they won’t let someone get away with lying about a title. That approaches line theft pretty narrowly.”
“Potions ingredients and dueling robes,” Pansy says. “I’m looking forward to Dueling.”
“I hereby claim the title Lord Hari James Potter, Lord of House Potter. So mote it be.” He has to introduce each house separately, as well as his position as Hogwarts’ Heir. So he’ll have to do this seven times. The Potter seat glows and the crest appears in front of Hari in stunning blue magic for just a moment. He’s been accepted. Several people sit back in their seats, seemingly believing he’s done.
“I suppose we could ask the Williamsons if we could hold dinner at their home next week,” Mrs. Granger muses. “George!” Mr. Granger thuds down the stairs and eyes Sirius warily. “There’s a dangerous wizard on the loose. Hari wants to charm our house so that everyone will forget our address to protect Hermione.”
Before they leave, Hari makes sure to explain how to call Critter.
The fifth year holding Hari lifts the little stone engraved with his name and calls, “his name’s Beau.”
“I hadn’t thought of it like that, but I suppose.”
Master Tomeaxe steps back to the center and bows, “May your gold have grown.”
extreme with only two moderates who made it through?”
Hermione gives him books. One is on the etymology of tigers, one of rusty spotted cats, and one is about holiday celebrations in Bengal. Hari actually tears up at the third. Draco lets them hug for a while longer than he had with Blaise before coughing.
There’s only ten questions for Runes, as is typical for this book. They power through the questions as a group, still having to rely on themselves to get the actual drawing correct.
“None of you know how to perform it, so it can’t be me. I have to cast the spell,” Sirius scans over the group, “not someone obvious, so I’d say Hermione.”
“She needs clothing to wear to sit in the gallery at the Wizengamot,” Hari says.
Hermione pales, “he had a meeting last year with Professor McGonagall about how he needs to do better or he may be kicked out of Hogwarts.”
“I see that it is now the usual time for a lunch recess,” Master Tomeaxe. “I will call my next witness after the break. May your gold ever grow.”
“No. Not at all.” Hari lets out a sigh of relief. Flipping between two extreme personalities will cause him to be viewed as a wild-card. It will make it hard for people to prepare to face him, not knowing which persona he’ll walk in as on any given day.
“You look stunning tonight, Hari,” Draco starts, taking up a bite-sized chocolate piece. “And your hands are gorgeous. Sirius outdid himself tonight.”
“I will think on your position,” Lord Macmillan replies. Translation: Hari has a point and he’s not yet willing to admit it.
Sure enough, he’s groaning over the tedious questions an hour later.
“I can do that,” Hermione nods.
“Switch,” Draco raises an eyebrow, “you picked that out for yourself, right?”
“Hari,” Draco’s voice is smooth as he extends his right hand, “could I have this dance?”
“It’s actually interesting you hadn’t heard. Since claiming my titles, I am Heir Hogwarts,” Hari smiles innocently at her, “as such, I can take over the duties of Headmaster as ours seems… indisposed.”
Hari nods at this. Slytherin, he knows from experience, can be a pretty judgmental place. He wouldn’t want to be the one that judgment is directed at. Thankfully, Hari is a Lord. That alone protects him from any and all judgment the other students could pile on him.
“There’s a dangerous wizard who has escaped police custody,” Hari jumps in, “One of our friends was crucial in his initial arrest. We’re putting wards at all our houses.”
“Now,” Narcissa rises and speaks in her ‘Healer’ voice, “they may be quick to get sore tomorrow, so here’s a pain potion. Take it when you get up, don’t try to tough it out. Your feet and your gait are important. Take it a bit easier than normal so the soreness won’t last any longer than tomorrow. After that, they should be back entirely to normal. Muscles are fickle, though, so if they’re still sore, let one of us know as soon as you can.”
“Is Hermione spending the night with you?”
They end up kissing for somewhere around fifteen minutes before the sound of footsteps outside makes them pull apart. Best to make sure they don’t get caught, at the very least. They make their way back to the R.O.R, where the group laughs at them as they walk in. Blaise makes sure to cat call, as well. Hari snarls at him. He’s loving this ‘ability to make animalistic noises while human’ thing and making the best of it.
Anyway. Plot is happening in the story. One enemy has been handled for book three. Time to deal with the other... Hopefully soon. I feel like I'm getting to the point I can start wrapping book three up. Part of the plot might end up spilling over into book four, just because of how it lines up. Maybe. I should stop rambling about it and just write it.
“I look forward to speaking more with her,” Theo says amicably, “she is quite intelligent.”
“Come on,” Draco grins at her, “we’re taking you to Mr. Lazwell. He makes the best robes in all of Britain.”
“Hello, handsome,” a tall fifth year scoops him up, “did you get a collar?”
“You weren’t looking for it,” Draco replies with a little shrug. “And we’re young. Besides, they act no differently than any other couple and since everyone wears robes, you wouldn’t have noticed from behind without really looking. We’ve kept you pretty distracted, too, always rushing you around.”
“I love it,” Hari smiles at Lucius and Narcissa, “thank you.”
“What’d you do to get the carriage to do that?” Hari asks softly, smirking at Draco.
“I also think someone is bullying her,” Hari adds before Draco can stop him.
Hari sets down his mug and reaches out with his other hand. The tray vanishes from between them, Critter seemingly knowing they’re already done with it.
“Oh, wonderful,” Draco grumbles. “Can we just gorge ourselves on dessert instead of a real dinner?”
“Is it bad I’m almost disappointed I didn’t get to follow through?” Hari asks.
“Of course.” An extra spot is made at the table.
“Minister, do you intend to deny Lord Potter his legal right to sit on this body?” Lucius is standing, eyes slightly narrowed. It is an intimidating look.
“Probably,” Draco sighs, “I probably would’ve gotten it by the end of the day.”
“Maybe not all of them,” Hari giggles and winks, “you’re the chef around here, after all. And an incredibly good one, at that.” Critter positively beams at that.
“Not like the rest of our House,” Hari grouses.
“What truly shows Lord Potter’s strength, however, was that when I became visibly upset after viewing his memories, he strove to comfort me. He hugged me and assured me he was alright, that what I had seen was just a memory. Despite having just re-lived those memories himself, he was able to pull himself together to cater to my emotional needs. This action made me want to break down further, because he is such a sweet, caring person and it made what was done to him just that much worse in my eyes.
“Which is why you offered her your contact information,” Draco assumes.
“I did, Critter, thank you.”
“According to Father, this is where he gets some of the incredibly rare books for our library,” Draco murmurs. “But it’s also got a nice little fiction section, so let’s go each pick out a book.”
“Heir Malfoy, I’m aware you’re prone to fits of hysteria, but can you perhaps not spill blood everywhere?” Professor Snape glares at him.
“Good. Critter will be keeping Master Hari’s study and room ready for him,” Critter says, walking with them to the entrance hall, “and preparing Miss Hermione’s room.”
Pansy rolls her eyes, “there’s no rule against it. It’s more of a ‘I don’t want everyone to think my child is spoiled’ thing. Even though we are all definitely spoiled and everyone knows it. So, if you summon him, do it out of sight of other students.”
“Fortescue’s and the trunk shop,” Draco says, “which first?”
“’Mione, what book was that?”
“Unfortunately,” Lucius agrees.
I'm back and I'm writing, so let's do this. Also, I put up a link to the schedule I wrote up in the end notes to chapter 13, for everyone who requested it.
They arrive at Mr. Lazwell’s still ribbing each other and the old man looks on amused. Hermione suddenly freezes as she looks around the store. She tugs on the sleeve of Hari’s robe.
“I would like to apologize for selling them, in that case,” she bows neatly, “I was unaware that you disapproved of them. I will pull them from my shelves with all due haste. If you would like, I can pass the word around to the more reputable shops? Ones with discreet owners.”
Draco’s gift is a small envelope which confuses Hari at first.
“I’m sure you’ve all noticed Mrs. Andromeda Tonks,” Hari gestures to the new teacher. “She will be teaching the new Wizarding Culture class. There will be a tiered program to ensure that each grade level currently attending receives the class. This will take three years, after which, she will be teaching a government and politics class.”
“I don’t want to go to Azkaban,” the wizard growls. Hari lets out a real growl that has the man shaking.
“We don’t get a lot of visitors,” Hermione says, “and nearly everyone who knocks on our door is a solicitor.”
“Wonderful,” Hari smiles at him. “Goodbye for now, Critter.”
“Yes, Heir Hogwarts!” the spokeself cries, “Filchie is taking away from the work of the elveses.”
So they fill her in on the night they got together, taking their time, but skimming past the kiss as quickly as possible. There’s still lots of blushing and avoiding eye contact and squealing friends involved, though. By the time the whole story has been told, the group is a mess of giggles and happy congratulations. Then, a chill washes over the train.
“I don’t care,” Draco informs him happily and finishes loading their plates. “Now eat.”
“One day, you will,” Draco assures him. “It doesn’t have to be today. But I wanted you to know. You seemed so scared, every time you thought of this conversation, and I never want you to be scared.” Draco pours both of them mugs of hot chocolate and presses one into Hari’s hands. Hari smiles slightly at him and watches Draco practically melt; his whole mask has been dismantled. He wants Hari to see everything.
Blaise laughs at that, “No, they’ll never let us change those. They’ll claim we’re pushing our agenda on the youth. Instead, our private tutoring takes the form of a few families all paying the same tutor to teach their children together. For us, there was, I think, ten in the class?”
The next bit of legislation is an amendment to an already tedious law. The amendment doesn’t really change anything as far as Hari can tell and Lucius had agreed. Hari has already decided not to vote for it. Despite all this, the presenter talks for his whole allotted hour and a half. Someone presents an hour long counterargument.
“You’d think,” Hari huffs.
Theo finishes the last of his ice cream—he’d clearly been there longer than them—and stands. “I’ll be sure to tell my father. It was nice seeing you all.” He slips away into the Alley.
The meal today, unlike the classic English lunch from last time, is an Indian chicken curry with rice, naan, and samosas. There’s kulfi for dessert, the frozen treat kept cool under a stasis charm. It’s the first time Hari’s had any Indian foods—the Dursleys insisted on bland, ‘normal’ foods at all times.
“You are? What for?”
“That only makes me feel slightly better,” Daphne sighs.
“Manja,” Draco mutters, “well, let’s break it down a little. House elves sometimes have trouble with certain words, but they’re usually similar.”
He pats Draco’s arm, “let me up, Dray.” Draco lets go and Hari practically throws himself into Hermione’s arms, stealing her up into a bone-crushing hug.
“Hey, where’s Draco?” Blaise asks. Hari shoots him a dry look.
“Okay,” Hari nods slowly, breathing slightly shallow, “I can do that.” So he says, but his mind is swirling. Daphne takes his arm again and carefully guides him back inside, whispering reminders to breathe. Draco’s dance with Hermione is done and they should be looking for Hari just about now.
“Where were your shoes yesterday?” Hari asks and Hermione almost bruises his ribs when she elbows him to get him not to, but he does anyway.
“I suppose it’s a good thing I have access to all my vaults now, isn’t it?” Hari smirks cheekily at her and she laughs.
“I’ll see you tomorrow, Lord Potter, and do call me Luna, won’t you? Or Loony, most people do.”
“Seconded,” Lord Nott says.
“I think Sirius has a set,” Hari points out, “maybe he’d give it to us? Or tell us how to make them. Or make us a set.”
“Have a wonderful day, Miss Monroe,” Hari nods politely, “and thank you for your services.”
“Oh,” Hermione coos, “I just don’t know yet. But he’s so gorgeous, it will have to be a perfect name.”
“And the note on their ability to turn people without the full moon,” Lord Greengrass says.
“Have you informed the parents of this decision?” Hari asks, voice innocently curious. “I’m interested as to how Lord Malfoy, Lord Nott, Lord Flint, Lady Longbottom, and Lady Bulstrode will feel about this. You did, of course, make sure to let the Board know of your decision, didn’t you? It was just the Headmaster—myself—you overlooked?”
He leaps onto the starting platform and, coiling his muscles, he takes off. The course pushes his balance and coordination primarily, speed not as much a concern in this form. If he were Beau, he would be leaping as quickly as he could, the platforms trying to throw him off if he didn’t move fast enough. But tigers are known for creeping, for ambushing, so instead it shrinks and forces him to adapt to rougher angles and bad footing. He leaps around for nearly an hour before the door opens and Professor Snape peeks in.
“The Family wing be having nine suites,” Critter announces. “Four for children, one for the Lord and Lady, and four for extra family.” Extended, Hari realizes, so when children age out of living here, they don’t have to move out entirely. “Eight suites is being on this floor. The Lord and Lady’s suite is being on the next floor with the nursery, classroom, and studies.”
“After the study, Critter be showing Master Hari the creatures,” Critter informs him. “And taking Master Hari to his almost-familiar.”
“I hear you have joined Lord Potter’s House.”
“Come, Narcissa and Draco should already be at home.” Hari nods and lets Lucius lead him to the nearest apparition point. The crowd of Lords and Ladies there waiting to get home part to let him through. Hari nods to as many as he physically can without looking like a bobble head. An instant later, he feels as if he’s being pressed through a tube and they’re outside Malfoy Manor.
“What did that mean?” Blaise asks when they land.
He leans in cautiously, giving Hari plenty of time to back away, but Hari doesn’t, instead allowing his eyes to fall shut and his chin to lift towards Draco.
“I will be finding time to speak with you on how to arrange long-brewing potions,” Professor Snape adds. Hari nods in agreement. There’s many ways they could go about it, but none of them are particularly sound.
“They saved everything,” Hari defends himself. “It’s all useful.”
“We are,” Lord Travers says slowly, “but not enough to manage everything.”
“Lord Potter is the opposite of this. He came in, not wanting to tell us what had happened not for fear of making his own situation worse, but because he was concerned it would upset us. My son, Draco, had to speak for him because he had been taught all his life not to speak of it.
“Critter is being happy to be taking care of Miss Hermione,” Critter tells her and pats her shoulders awkwardly.
“And Lord Potter could afford to purchase a new outfit for all of you every day from my shop and still be one of the richest wix in Europe,” Mr. Lazwell declares. Then, he drops into a smooth bow.
“No. You’ll disappear again.” Narcissa peeks out of one of the rooms at the sound of them arguing and has to stifle a laugh. Hari shoots her a pleading look.
“Critter is being happy to help! Critter is also being happy that Master Hari is coming tomorrow. Will Master Hari be wanting lunch or dinner?”
“I’m coming with,” Hari announces and follows Remus out of the compartment.
“What do you mean?”
“I never got an answer,” Hari raises an eyebrow, “would you like one of the upstairs studies?” Hermione shifts nervously. “How about this, you can have one of the studies until you’ve married and gotten your own house with its own study in it.”
“If he’s here in person,” Hari smiles, “he has to be around the Dementors and see the effects they’re having. Maybe a tour around the grounds and a chat with one of them will do him some good.”
“I can’t believe someone saw him,” Draco says softly.
“I hereby claim the title Lord Hari James Potter, Duke of Slytherin, by Right of Conquest. So mote it be.” There’s whispering this time, people wondering how he could possibly have inherited both, but the magic accepts him, so they have no way of arguing.
“It’s at the Department of Magical Transportation,” Lucius says, “you can send an owl for it, or a house elf.”
“I anticipate the possibility,” Hari sighs.
“What?” Hari asks.
Center, sixth row, nine seats in. Where the Gryffindor and Slytherin seats had been. Instead, there is now a chair nearly as extravagant as Merlin and Arthur’s thrones. The seats for every house he claimed have combined to make it so. Because of this, the layout of the room has changed, seats shifting to fill in the gaps his Claims have made where the seats vanished to combine.
“Hey,” Hari takes his seat on Draco’s lap again and leans forward, searching out her eyes. “You always downplay your knowledge. That’s how I know. If you think you can help a little, you’ll be able to help a lot.” Hari glances up at the trunks, then hops up with a grin and brings down a tube of henna. “Here, give me your hand.”
“Thank you, Lady Longbottom,” Hari replies and they clasp wrists.
“We is going to the other doors now, Master Hari,” Critter tells them and takes them to the doors between the two stairways. Once opened, they reveal a large, open library, nearly three stories tall. The center is entirely open and there’s balconies wrapping around each level to provide safe access to all the books. There’s plush carpeting everywhere and plenty of chairs, couches, desks, and window seats to spend a lifetime in the room without ever leaving. Critter lets them look for a few minutes, then says, “Would Master Hari be wanting to see the upstairs?”
“Why?”
This chapter has the introduction of a new friend!! :D
“That he’s an idiot for putting Dementors in a school where there’s children who are defenseless against them,” Hari snarls, “and that he’d better get rid of them or come see me as soon as he gets the letter.”
“Remember to set your alarms!” Pansy adds when Hermione breaks off from the group.
“I wouldn’t claw you,” Hari straightens his robes, “not intentionally. But instincts are a thing and emotions are dampened in animagus form. So don’t bank on it. Beau very well might claw you if you don’t let him down. And really, wrap my paws and cuddle me more? Beau would just bite you, dummy.” Hari pushes Draco’s shoulder gently and takes his seat next to him.
“Of course.”
“Hari petrified him within seconds, did he not?” Luna asks innocently. “There was nothing to worry about because Wormtail is weak.”
“It’s fine,” he promises, “you would’ve gotten it by the end of the day.”
“Hari got me an owl! He’s so tiny and cute! I named him Uluka,” Hermione informs them.
“I doubt that,” Draco shakes his head, “didn’t you see the antiques section? Plus, that was such a small shelf of the massive shop. I would bet they only bring a fraction of her income. She won’t need to reach out.”
“We think we met a Seer,” Draco announces and Professor Snape automatically steps back to let them in.
“Essentially,” Draco nods.
“Yeah,” Draco smiles tightly, “see you there.” Hari leads Hermione out the Manor to the front gates, where Narcissa is waiting.
Hari smirks, “thank you, again, in that case.”
“This is the ballroom Mother was telling me about,” Blaise says, “She always claimed the Potter ballroom was the grandest she had ever seen. I thought she was exaggerating it’s beauty when she described it. She didn’t even do it justice.”
“It is,” Hari agrees.
Hari is standing close to Draco, calmly tucked under his arm and clutching Draco’s waist. A little smile curls his lips when Draco leans down and presses a soft kiss to Hari’s temple. They scan the platform together, looking for the others.
“If you believe yourselves strong enough to punish one of your own appropriately for these crimes, then by all means, vote down my request,” Master Tomeaxe says casually, “but I sincerely doubt you will be able to place your dear Chief Warlock Dumbledore into Azkaban where he belongs.”
“I am,” Hari nods.
“I plan to work in that study,” Hari tells Critter, “so I will see you very soon.”
“I know, I’m just nervous,” Hari replies. Draco tugs him in a little closer.
All of it makes Draco want to wrap Hari in cotton wool and hide him away from the world. He’s too pure and sweet and innocent to have to face all this and bear the evil.
They stroll slowly through the town, agreeing as they pass Honeyduke’s that they’ll be back for a visit. The shop has the sweetest scents drifting out—all sugar and chocolate and they’re both intoxicated by it. They make it past the little shopping center and walk through a small patch of houses before reaching their destination.
“The reason I was placed with these people was the misguided belief that Tom Riddle, also known as Voldemort, would be returning. Held within my scar was a scrap of his soul, a Horcrux. Riddle had created six. He was attempting to return. However, one visit to the goblins and we knew the location and safest destruction method for each. They were all destroyed in mere months.
“It’s not… evil or anything like that?”
“Yes, thank you, Critter,” Hari smiles at the house elf.
“Great,” Hari sighs, “well, we should get back. It’s homework time.”
“My life has no meaning!” Draco pokes at the tip of the spear as if testing it’s sharpness. Hari sighs.
Blaise talks about how hard it was to realize what had happened and how powerless he’d felt—something no one in the room ever anticipated hearing from an Heir.
“Are you looking for someone?”
Hari scampers out to find Lucius, whom he hasn’t spoken to since early this morning.
Let me know your thoughts!
Critter appears, “Master Hari is calling?”
“All valid reasons,” Lady Bulstrode nods, “but how is he unnecessary?”
“Hey,” Draco rubs his shoulder a little, pocketing the book. “It’s okay.”
“Lord Hari James Potter.”
“I kind of just left after suggesting her and getting Lucius to agree.” Hari waits for Daphne to start to collecting herself, “why is this funny?”
“Probably between twelve to fifteen.” Hari nods shortly.
“Reservation for Malfoy,” Draco tells the wizard at the entrance.
Hari scans the room for Daphne. He needs to talk to her about this. Yes, she’d promised that same-sex couples weren’t looked down on, but to see it… that’s something entirely different.
Hermione cradles the bird carefully in one hand and draws a book out of her bag, flipping through it almost frantically. Finally, she taps her finger against a word.
Seamus shook his head a couple of times, as if trying to rid himself of cobwebs. “That's... alright... I had no fecking idea what a powerful curse that was! I was screamin' at meself in me head that I don't wanna to look at Harry at the moment, much less tickle him, and me hand didn't care. It moved on its own!”
Harry glared at them. “Oh you got away with plenty! I'm STILL shocked that Minerva didn't expel the lot of you!”
The next time he saw Draco was on the Hogwarts' Express, and he was still so angry at the slimy git that he felt justified hexing him and his henchmen unconscious, and then leaving them laying there – definitely worse for the hexes – for the rest of the trip. In fact, his last sight of Draco was still unconscious as everyone else disembarked. For all he cared, the bastard could lay there forever.
“What the fuck are you doing?!” Draco demanded, holding his wand at the ready to hex Harry. To his utter shock, Harry dropped to his knees and looked up at Draco with such pleading in his eyes that Draco forgot all about his plan to hex the infuriating git. “Er...”
“Fine,” Terry agreed mildly. “Those are the rules then. Let's play a game, shall we? Everyone who wants to participate will take a slip and write a dare on it. The dare can be anything that won't get anyone expelled – or hurt them – and should not be anything you personally would not want to do. Thus, I personally will not be daring anyone to kiss any spiders – and if anyone uses that and I somehow get stuck with it, I'm hexing you all as unpleasantly as I can think up just as soon as I've finished kissing the bloody spider.”
Sure, Draco would be punished most severely, but he'd also have hope that Harry was out there and could eventually do something to defeat the Dark Lord. At this point, there was no illusion any longer that Draco had any sort of future should Voldemort remain in power. At best, he'd be free in name only, so long as he followed the Lord's every command – likely as an enforcer, as he was being groomed to be.
Ron couldn't help but smirk in amusement. “Are you saying you want our best mates to beat each other up?”
Rather than panic or try to talk some sense into the man, Draco simply narrowed his eyes, grabbed the offending hand, and performed a lightning fast move that ended with the man half bent over with his arm behind his back.
Draco nearly blushed and hid his face in the pillow to hide it. “Thanks... That means a lot to me.”
Never in Harry's life had he been so happy to hear footsteps coming when he was trying to sneak around. He carefully set Draco on the floor in front of the common room entrance, and then stepped off to the side so that he wouldn't be bumped into or tripped over by whoever was coming. His heart sank for a moment when he realized that it was Snape, but then felt grateful again when Snape immediately rushed to check on Draco.
“Draco, probably,” Astoria replied.
Draco couldn't decide whether to be happy or angry when he saw Harry enter the Great Hall for the feast after all. He decided to focus on telling everyone how he'd broken Harry's nose. It was strangely satisfying to relive that glorious moment over and over as he told the story several times. But then Dumbledore stood up to make a few announcements and Draco felt that he'd show less emotion or anything telling if he concentrated on making his fork hover over the table.
Harry spun to face him and crossed his arms over his chest. “You'll WHAT?” He asked in a tone of definite challenge.
Harry waited to see if the vial had contained a poison or other potion. He happened to have a Bezoar on him, so he was confident that Draco wouldn't die, and also, Auror or not, he'd promptly arrest her in that instance. But after several long and tense moments, in which Draco looked almost pleased as he drained his mug, there was no sigh of poison, so Harry relaxed.
“Wha...?” Harry had to turn this information over in his mind a bit before it made sense. “You... You want to BE with me?”
Harry shrugged. “Perhaps not technically, but since the ONLY way that situation would work in their favor would be if their entire Year links hands and carries that flag out together, I'll consider anything else as not following the first rule of working together with their Housemates.”
Except this time, he was just a bit cranky from his Mark hurting, and Madam Malkin kept unknowingly pricking his Mark with her pins. “Watch where you're sticking that pin, will you?!” He yelled after the third time, immediately walking over to a full length mirror simply to get out of her grasp.
The door opened, prompting Narcissa to sit up and glamour them both perfect as Pansy rushed across the ward towards them. “Oh Draco!” She cried as she flung her arms around him. “When I heard what happened! That bloody arsehole! Do you know what his punishment is? It's nothing! A slap on the wrist! He has detention with Professor Snape until the end of the year! Of all the–”
Plainly surprised despite having ordered no less, Voldemort turned to Dolohov. “Is he?”
Lucius and Narcissa were alerted when Draco came home, and after giving him a few minutes to rant, decided to pop into the Crystal Room and see if they could help solve whatever Draco was having a problem with.
Biting his lip, Harry decided to keep an eye on them and simply wait until the potion wore off.
The woman grinned at them becomingly. “This here is a weak lust potion. A single drop of it – which only costs a Galleon – makes you a little horny and in the mood to grope your dance partner. It's much the same as a few shots of Firewhiskey in that aspect, but it's quicker and doesn't make you drunk, so it's possible to actually dance all night if you want.”
They all held their breath as they waited to see if the spell would actually work the way it was intended to. Just when it seemed like they might pass out from the lack of oxygen, a glowing orb emerged from the portal, followed by another. And then another. And finally a last orb before the portal closed.
“Oh calm your tits, love!” Senior Auror Ginger ordered with an amused grin. “I can and WILL be in here whenever I feel it's necessary. For example, had I actually managed to catch you BEFORE you got dressed, I could have told you not to bother. I'm going to give you each a flask of Polyjuice Potion – it's already got bits of random muggles in it – and once you've taken it and transformed, you're going to have to change into different kit.”
He gave her a faint smile that still probably looked at least a little drunk. “Well, so there was a person – I don't want to say who – who came across me shortly after the fuzzy spell wore off. He seemed to have a bit of self control in that he didn't immediately hold out his hands and try to tickle me in the corridor. On the other hand, he – despite being rather confused by why he wanted to tickle me – cast a Petrificus Totalus on me, then levitated me to a nearby classroom.”
“In that case, I should probably go home and sleep off this potion before I blurt out anything worse.”
“You were? Why?” Harry wondered, half afraid that Draco was giving up on him already.
Deciding that Harry was being genuinely concerned – as opposed to not caring or trying to get one over on him somehow – Draco relaxed just a tiny bit. He turned so that he was facing Harry as he leaned against the wall again.
Several minutes passed like this before Harry pulled back just enough to kiss Draco. That kiss led to another, which led to another, until they were laying on the plush cushions, completely naked and stroking each other everywhere. Draco took a long time working Harry open, his hands doing a thorough job even as they both kept on kissing.
Draco smiled and shook his head at her. “Whatever luv. I'm done now, yeah?”
Draco Apparated directly to the Crystal Room in Malfoy Manor so that he could take his anger out on every shard of crystal there. He roared and shattered things by hand – by throwing them – and also by casting spells to blast or otherwise destroy things. All the while, he muttered things like: “How dare that Harry buggering Potter!”
He moaned into the bed. “That feels... surprisingly good...”
The utterly fantastic little ripples made Draco's whole body shiver even as a storm seemed to be gathering at the base of his spine. With a roar, he dug his fingers into Harry's hips and surrendered to the climax sweeping him away. The whole world went white for a few seconds, and then Draco collapsed onto Harry, feeling like he'd be perfectly comfortable going right to sleep with Harry as his bed.
“Blimey mate, you're that famous bloke!” Ron blurted out, and then frowned when it occurred to him that his voice sounded very wrong. Both of them jumped to their feet and practically leapt on the counter in their haste to see what they looked like. “I'M A BLOODY GIRL!!!”
Harry chuckled as he finished up the explanation. “We're going to do this in two distinct stages. The first stage will be the Fourth Years. They'll be able to work their way through the Maze at their own pace, and once a team has successfully brought me the flag, a few things will be added to bring the Challenge up the the Sixth Years level, not to mention, the Flag will be reexamined for tampering and placed back in the center of the Maze. Any questions?”
Draco did not know how to take this news, looking baffled and – to Harry's extreme dislike – seemed to be on the verge of asking if he could help.
“If he's a muggle, then how do YOU know him?” Harry wondered.
“Zabini???”
Blaise shrugged. “Just that your broody bastard and my favorite arsehole have BOTH been driving everyone mad this year, and I think I have an idea to help them both feel better.”
Sighing, he eventually drifted off to sleep.
The entire family migrated out to their backyard and waited for Neville to finish gathering up and arranging some brush and trimmings left over from his spring pruning efforts. Soon, there was a nice blaze going and everyone couldn't help but relax just by looking at it.
Harry snorted in disbelief. “RIIIGHT! That's why you're always trying to bully and annoy me.”
to let him change positions again.
With a mouth on his shaft.
Scratching his cheek, Harry nudged Hermione with his elbow. “Why would Soulmates need to write to each other on their arms?”
Draco squinted his eyes in thought. “Hmm... I think you might be right. Now I'm going to have to COMPLETELY rethink my final exams from here on out.”
“THAT'S
There was silence as all three of them couldn't help but wonder if Harry would accept that as final, or if he'd try to argue.
He'd tried to tell Draco a couple of times that he thought he might actually love him, but each time, he'd been rejected before he could even finish his sentence. It had hurt and he'd done his best to forget about Draco and move on, but now...
Draco cast his school robes aside but left all the rest of his clothes on. He then rolled up his sleeves, exposing his smooth and creamy arms up to his elbows. After that, he slowly climbed onto the bed with Harry, his eyes roaming all over in clear indecision as to where to start.
“To have fun. To
Lucius searched her eyes for answers and she smiled at him. Smiling very faintly in return, he patted Draco – who was currently resting his head on Harry's shoulder – on the back. “I had no idea, son. Congratulations.”
Lily2 took over the explanation. “It was a spell we found in a book rumored to be written by Merlin himself.”
She nodded in agreement, a rather fierce expression on her face.
Narcissa laughed softly. “Your father purposely wrote the time on the invitation for ten minutes earlier than intended, so that our guest would hopefully be on time.”
Harry and Draco got out of bed reluctantly. Both held hands without even realizing it until they were out of bed (they'd slipped off the end rather than one of the sides), then their hands gently slipped apart like a caress. Draco promptly cast dressing spells that had his clothes flying onto him in an instant.
In desperation, whenever he needed a break, Draco took to using things hidden in the room – such as a magnificent piano that insulted the player whenever they missed a note – to relieve his stress. In one moment of pure madness, Draco dressed up in a gaudy Victorian whore's costume and sang and danced his little black heart out.
“Come on, Malfoy! At least prove to me that you didn't go to somewhere other than the Leaky – which I already checked – to let people give you nasty drugs and poisons again!”
Hermione smiled at him adoringly. “Exactly!”
“Are you dating her?” Harry asked as he entered the loo. He immediately leaned against the door so that no one else could come in and Draco couldn't escape.
It was at that moment that Snape burst onto the scene, and after a little pathetic begging from Dumbledore, simply cast the Unforgivable Killing Curse. He was so clearly in command (being the Dark Lord's favorite minion, more or less) that not even Greyback nor Dolohov tried to protest.
Thus, he was utterly grateful to Hermione for having an alarm charm set to go off every hour so that she could pop in from her Prefect duties in order to keep him nice and fuzzy looking. All in all, things were going well, even though Ron gad to cast spells on himself and the other boys in the dorm each morning to curb the urge to tickle him – at least until Harry got dressed and Hermione was able to spell him again.
A soft sound like a laugh emerged from under the covers. “Breakfast in bed, Potter? Aren't I the lucky one?”
When Harry arrived in front of Draco, Lucius was trying to protect his son with his very body, but Narcissa was smiling softly at Harry, her hand gently tugging Lucius away. Harry stopped short, simply staring at Draco for a long moment. Draco simply stared at Harry in return. So much he wanted to say, but none of the words would form in his utterly bone dry mouth.
Harry grinned at her. “So much better than boring paper tests, yeah?”
The Patil twins did an interesting mashup of
“Up yours, wanker!” Harry exclaimed with a glare. “My friends happened to have excellent manners!”
“Oh DRACO luv! Get your fit arse up here!”
Draco waved that away. “That has nothing to do with you. I've just been busy trying to get my arse in better shape.”
“Because you OWE me a dare!” Pansy gloated confidently.
Harry nervously ran a hand through his hair. “Erm... I should probably go. I've got LOADS of stairs to run up before curfew.”
“Hey there, luv. How would you like to lick a drop of Lust off my clit?”
Months passed. Harry had a horrifying vision in which he was a giant snake that bit Arthur Weasley. After making a fuss until everyone believed him – thereby saving Arthur's life – Harry spent the entire Christmas hols at Grimmauld place with Sirius and the Weasleys. Just before it was time to go back, Snape showed up with unpleasant news.
Draco felt like he was running for hours or even days. Somehow, he managed to keep going rather faster than he thought possible, even when his body – which had not been exercised very much this year – protested this unreasonable demand on it so suddenly. Through the pain knifing through him, Draco ran and ran and ran until finally, he reached the gates. There was a spot just outside the school grounds that seemed to glow in his vision like a beacon, as if it was saying that if he just reached that spot, he would be safe.
Draco shrugged. “He came to our Manor and not even my mother objected, so what did he care about my age?”
Draco held out his hand and waited patiently. Harry hesitated, and then placed his hand in Draco's who tugged him into his arms and held him tight. “Is there anything I can do to help you feel better?”
Chuckling, Harry kissed his husband, and then turned to find that Ravenclaw was currently closing in on the center of the Maze. “Good thing I have recording spells on every student – so that I can review them all individually to be certain I don't miss anything they did.”
Draco sighed and gripped the book tightly. He LONGED to strangle it! “WHAT ABOUT MUGGLES?!?!”
Then he tilted his head toward the trays that had been set on separate desks. Grabbing his wand, he magicked the desks so that they were right next to each other. The boys sat and busied themselves eating and just basically enjoying the quiet time together.
This time when Draco tickled Harry's neck with his tongue, it actually made Harry laugh. Soft closed mouth giggles that made his chest and stomach move but not to the point where he was squirming or trying to get away. Draco alternated the tickling with unexpected bite to the nape of Harry's neck. At the same time, his hand drew long lines down Harry's spine.
Meanwhile, Wormtail had been sent to the dungeon to investigate a strange sound, and had called a report up the stairs that nothing was wrong.
Rather than state the obvious – not even in a snarky or sarcastic way as was called for – Harry chose to roll his eyes. “I was trying to decide what curse to use on Malfoy, sir.”
“Eat up mate!” Ron insisted. “Say... why were you late anyway? I thought you had an excellent Alarm Charm set so that you WOULDN'T be late.”
Before his parents could protest or attempt to stop him, Draco Apparated straight to Harry's flat.
“Aww,” the crowd lamented in disappointment, but then dispersed to go dance or find other people to exchange body shots with. Harry decided to be opportunistic and sat in Draco's newly vacated – and still wonderfully warm – chair.
,” Pansy insisted, pointing to Blaise to start it up.
Amanda hummed and gave him a sweet kiss before holding out her hand. “Chocolate?”
“But we won't lie and say we haven't
Ron was definitely intrigued at this point. “So what DO you have in mind?”
He raised his wand to cast a Finite Incantatum, only for there to come a loud bang as the door that to his office had burst open to reveal Draco Malfoy rushing in. He stopped short, his sentence cutting itself off in surprise and shock.
Since he couldn't quite reach Harry without bending over in an undignified manner, he cast a light tickling spell all over his body. Harry was laughing so hard now that he was gasping for breath and rolling back and forth in an attempt to escape.
This took Snape aback for a moment. “Such impertinence! Ten points from Gryff –” He turned to look toward the giant hourglasses on the walls and gave a sneering smile. “Ah, I see there are no longer any points left in the Gryffindor hourglass to take away. In that case, Potter, we will simply have to –”
“I care!” Harry protested, and then grinned. “I just don't have any choice in the matter. I always wondered what it would be like to have hair that looked sleek and shiny and perfect.”
Ron ran a hand through his hair and blew out a sigh. “Yeah, she is pretty ride or die. She DID get us out of Gringott's by stealing a dragon. Hopefully getting an eyeful of some other naked woman's body won't upset her too bad.” At this point, he was trying to figure out how to hook up his bra, which thankfully had a front closure.
“WE ARE
“Mum! Dad! I can explain!”
Draco hung his head for a moment, giving in because he knew that she'd just keep using deadlier and deadlier ammunition if he resisted. “Yeah, alright, you bloody cow! See if I buy you anything for Christmas!”
“How do you mean?” Draco asked with a frown.
Considering it was during the day, he didn't think he'd get a reply.
That said, something had been bugging him for a while now. When Bella led all the Death Eaters out on a mission to cause mayhem, and the Dark Lord was off looking for something, Draco decided to take a tiny risk. He joined his mother for tea, casting privacy spells around them the moment the elves had served them and been dismissed.
Unfortunately – as it meant no kissing – their next interaction was when Umbridge was inspecting Grubbily-Plank's class. Draco had complained about getting slashed by a Hippogriff, and Harry'd earned yet another detention by pointing out that it had happened: “Only because he's too stupid to listen to what Hagrid told him to do.”
Harry had been more or less ignoring the Karaoke, but suddenly a rather heavy beat started, and a trio of girls banged their heads until it was time for them to sing. The reason this caught Harry's attention was because they were singing in Japanese and the only part he could understand was when they said: “
couldn't hold me back!”
has been a perfect gentleman, insisting that we mostly wait for our wedding night.”
Terry took this as the actual question and explained that: “Any dare written on one of these slips and then given to the person you wish to dare is magically BOUND to do the dare. They CAN'T chicken out!”
Albus gestured to his twin brother and Scorpius. “Well, his, James' and mine.”
. Draco couldn't help but snicker to himself because there was NO WAY he was going to make such a fool of himself by singing such an insipid song. IF he became obligated to sing – and the look on Pansy's face make it clear that he probably would be – he was going to choose a song that he sounded good singing and he was going to be stone cold sober as he sang it!
His left arm was bent at an awkward angle and his sleeve had landed in a way that caught her attention. She gently pulled it up and pressed her fingers to his wrist as if checking his pulse. Chances were very good that she'd seen their last messages to each other because she gasped ever so slightly and breathed out: “Oh my darling boy.” She patted Harry on the cheek twice as if trying to be absolutely certain, but really trying to comfort him.
Voldemort was quite pleased to be able to send off a party to raid the place and 'pay his respects to the happy couple.' Thankfully, Draco and his parents were still in a sort of limbo in which they were considered some of the higher ranking Death Eaters, and yet... weren't. Thus, they were all kept home for this mission, especially since Lucius' wand had been destroyed when the Dark Lord had tried to use it to kill Harry a week ago.
Harry suddenly looked enlightened. “Oh! Yeah... I suppose Voldemort might hurt you to get to me.”
Ron snorted in amusement. “There's no one surefire technique! For example, that man over there has decided to simply stand there wearing very little until someone takes an interest in him.”
Draco couldn't help but be drawn to the action, watching said hair nearly crackle from magic as it resisted even an unconscious attempt to tame it. “I love how your hair always looks like you just fell out of bed.”
But Harry cut her off. “I already know that he'll tell me to keep on living my life the best I can despite the curse. It's what Madam Pomfrey told me, and you KNOW she's the type to keep a person in hospital until they've been cured. But Dumbledore told her that since there are ways to manage this curse, I have to keep on going as long as I can.”
With a sigh, he and Ron took a swig and hastily set the flasks down on the counter so that they could fall to their hands and knees and try not to cry from the hot searing pain. When they were finally done and could breathe again, they looked at each other. With a gasp of shock, Harry realized that Ron was now a petite and
Having arrived at the bottom of the stairs, he paused a moment as he cast a spell to fling open the large ballroom doors and enter. Then he summoned his guitar and strummed it as he sort of waltzed around the room.
Not too far in, just far enough not to be seen, Harry stopped and gestured to a grass and leaf covered area that looked relatively soft. “Here?”
Deciding to go their separate ways before someone came along and caught them acting shady together, both boys rushed off in different directions that eventually led to the Great Hall. To his dismay, Ron was only a minute or so later than Harry and Hermione, who were just sitting down when he entered the Hall. He'd planned to be at least 20 minutes earlier than them so that he could be mostly full when they started on their homework chatter, which would help him feel nice and lethargic and not pay any attention to them in the slightest.
Harry laughed. “Well I didn't think it would be a good idea to make the Maze up of nothing but dangerous magical creatures that the students had to defeat, and so the challenges require a little bit of everything.”
!” The Entertainer sang out happily. “A quick reminder of the rules: First and most importantly, NO means NO! DON'T push it! Secondly, ANY body part may touch ANY body part so long as it's part of a legitimate body shot! If the contact becomes excessive, the offenders will be evicted with orders to just find a bed and shag already! And last... nudity is allowed but WE'RE not bloody responsible for your clothes! So charm them to go home if you're worried about losing them! Alright then my lovelies! Let the fun begin!”
“Hmph!” Draco harrumphed before beckoning the Potion Seller over. “It seems my...
Chuckling, Harry shook his head and refused to say anything more as he resumed his journey to the loo.
The next time Harry got a close up view of Draco was when their teams were scheduled to play against each other. Slytherin had taken every unfair advantage it could get, and Harry stared at Draco suspiciously. Draco stood on his side of the initial team gathering, his white-blond hair gleaming in the sunlight, which also highlighted his crown-shaped badge that said: Weasley is our King.
Laughing, and promising not to tattle on James2 to Draco for swearing, Prongs, Padfoot, and Moony answered that question with every detail. Teddy and a couple of the others were ALSO listening in intently, all of them lamenting the fact that they had promised not to pull any more pranks.
Still Draco
Chuckling, Harry set about licking just about every part of Draco's body. He eventually settled between Draco's legs so that he could rim him and work him open. Draco did his best to relax and simply enjoy the pleasure, but Harry soon made that impossible, making him thrash back and forth and
His eyes bugged clear out of his head as he read the somewhat fancy script.
trying to get away. I well know that you could hex me within an inch of my life if you
“Horny?” The woman asked with a smirk. “Enjoy!” She bade as she smacked Ron on the arse and turned to sell some drops to others.
Pansy: “What are you waiting for? So love me like you do, love love me like you do, love me like you do, love love me like you do, touch me like you do, touch touch me like you do...” At this point, they were looking at each other and about to dance a simple yet sexy waltz. They sang the next line together: “What are you waiting for?!”
Draco didn't say anything and Harry almost thought he fell back asleep, except that he started to fidget. After shifting a couple of times didn't solve the problem, Draco sighed in aggravation, slipped out of bed, and marched to the bathroom. A minute later, he returned to bed and nested in the bedding again.
Snape quickly and repeatedly cast a spell that seemed to stop Draco from actually dying, followed by fixing him up, followed by returning him to his body. Even so, Draco was still about half out of it. He couldn't even protest when Snape lifted him up and helped him toward the door, saying something like: “You need the hospital.”
Harry was stunned to see a rather cozy little area off to the side. It had a bunch of plush cushions and was romantically lit by a bevy of candles. Good thing the castle was basically fireproof!
Tonight was different. Tonight... everyone seemed to be flocking to Draco instead. But it wasn't a good thing, even though it looked like it on the surface. See, Draco hadn't been out of his Manor since having all the charges against him dismissed. So tonight when he showed up at the Leaky looking miserable and depressed, Harry was concerned but didn't think anything of it when people flocked to him to give him drinks to congratulate him on managing to avoid punishment.
Astoria immediately sat on his lap, stroking his bare chest while kissing him. “Are you saying that
Draco managed to delay answering long enough to drink a good quarter to third of the bottle – before Harry grew concerned and took the bottle away from him. “It makes me sad because as much as I want you happy, I want you happy with ME...”
“When he tells me that he's okay with letting people know, and not a moment before,” Draco informed her firmly, giving her a kiss when she pouted in disappointment.
Harry shrugged, looking at Ron before tilting his head so that the water could get his hair wet. “I'm fine.”
“Nobody's wearing much...” Ron whispered. To be honest, he was the youngest of so many sons that he'd seen more than his fair share of male nudity. Thus that didn't really bother him, it's just that he wasn't sure if he had what it took to fit in with this crowd.
Draco growled menacingly. “Harry, my heart, I'm bloody starving and if you don't sit back down and start this meal – this instant – I'll–”
Draco grinned. “Mmm... tempting, very tempting...”
Harry kissed him. “I wanted to try it on my own for the first time at the very least. If I do this again next year, I'd LOVE for everyone to give me their thoughts on what worked and what didn't.”
Narcissa stood up. “I'll go too. Please, my love, please just rest and get better as soon as possible.”
I stay right where I am until you're done with me?”
“Better than what?!” Pansy asked incredulously.
Harry handed him his plate of breakfast. “So... what was your fight about?”
Greg – or at least he thought it was Greg, he wasn't sure which girl was which, to be honest – giggled despite his deep wish not to call attention to himself, then blushed when Harry turned to look at him. Draco took advantage of the momentary distraction to push past Harry and rush off to a nearby hiding place to wait for Harry to move along. Soon enough, he was safely ensconced in the Room of Hidden Things, once again trying everything he could think of to fix this bloody aggravating cabinet.
Slumping in utter defeat, Draco muttered. “I had a fight with my parents and I'm so fucking tired of trying to live up to everyone's expectations that I... just... wanted it to end...”
The next night he got the usual hello, followed by something new he couldn't read, and so, he decided to just ignore the writing. For a year or so, he kept his sleeves firmly down and never even dared to look at his arm when he was in the shower.
Draco rolled his eyes so hard that his head followed along. “Oh come now, I'm of age, surely even YOU aren't so old that you can't figure that out on your own.”
Or he was, until Draco caught him coming up out of the dungeons. Harry had no idea how long he'd been caught in Snape's memories, but judging by the look on Draco's face, it was more than the hour the fuzzy spell lasted. Hermione told him later that she'd run across Snape and been told he'd been let go early, and so, hadn't bothered to come looking for him – assuming he'd gone to bed.
! It's about OUR family honor and pride! WE NEED to repay you, and you should stop being such an arse and accept it!”
Draco pressed his lips together and tried to resist the potion urging him to blurt out the truth. He even closed his eyes so that the truth couldn't be read in them.
Hmm... did Harry perhaps want
Draco shrugged. “That remains to be seen.”
Ron decided to sit himself on the arm of Theo's chair. “Then what IS the point?”
want to be my first.”
Amanda purred from happiness and ran her hands through Draco's hair. After a moment, he pulled back and grinned at her. She practically glowed as she returned his grin.
It's alright, Draco,” Snape assured him, lowering his wand. “Potter is here for a little Remedial Potions.”
Blaise laughed. “As amusing as that would be to watch, no. That would get them both in trouble, and my favorite arsehole doesn't need anymore trouble, ta ever so.”
Satisfied, Harry let himself give into the urge to fall asleep.
Hermione laughed and gave her a kiss. “Behave, or I won't do that thing they're talking about to you.”
“Start bending me, it's never enough, 'til I feel all your pieces. Start bending me, keep bending me un.til I'm. com.plete.ly bro.ken. in!”
Draco seemed to read his mind a little. “I WOULD have shagged you last night, and the memory probably would have been my most cherished one for the rest of my life, but now that I'm sober... You're right. I have more self respect than being an easy one off just because I want you so badly.”
Harry yawned and wished he could sleep, but his head was too full of worries such as: Does being able to talk to snakes automatically make him a bad person? Is he REALLY the many times great grandson of Salazar Slytherin? Who in the bloody hell would he even ask???
“Mrs. Malfoy,” Harry greeted with a small but warm smile.
Draco did not look best pleased, but said nothing.
Stunned by the news that Vince had died, Draco lay next to Greg, torn between standing up and officially joining Harry in the fight and staying to protect one of the only friends he had. He listened when Harry stood and the conversation revealed that the Diadem had been a Horcrux destroyed by the Fiendfyre. They were already discussing Vince as if his death was of no consequence to them, except they weren't quite heartless enough to actually wish him dead.
They were barely three steps into The Club when Harry gasped in shock. He and Ron were looking around with wide eyes.
Since Harry had actually explained the rules a few times during class, none of the students had anything to ask. However, one of the parents was rather confused about something.
Upon further thought, this was probably why he'd been hidden in here – to stop basically flattering his creator. After a moment of admiring the quality of the original spellwork on the dummy, Draco decided to add some more. With a couple of flicks of his wand, he had the dummy perfectly capable of dancing with him – despite having no legs and only one stand on rollers. Obviously, it wouldn't be sophisticated dancing, but still, it would do.
Harry laughed. “Maybe.”
“Sorry ladies, looks like you're going to have to pick another person to sit on,” Draco informed them with a smirk. He got up and walked over to the stage before anyone could stop him. Meanwhile, Blaise actually held up his hands in a gesture asking everyone to wait a moment.
“Er, Malfoy?” Harry asked in concern.
Over at Twilfitt and Tatting's, Draco's fitting went much more smoothly. He had everything he needed in practically no time. Even better, his mother got thoroughly distracted trying on new dress robes, and then having them fitted. This gave Draco – with a murmured excuse of needing a few minutes in the bathroom – time to slip away.
Draco flapped a hand at him dismissively. “Gryffindor is the only House in the School that cares more about breaking rules than learning things.”
Harry privately thought that Draco looked adorable while only half dressed and sporting a messy case of bedhead. Suppressing a grin, he focused on the bacon and eggs he was cooking. When they were getting close to done, he made some toast to go with them.
“Alright my lovelies!” The Entertainer called out, regaining their attention. “Our first song of the night is about to begin, BUT it's now officially after 10 PM and YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS!!!”
Harry shook his head, now feeling much less dreamy and more like he wished he'd just kept his mouth shut. “No! Look, I know what you're thinking, that I was raped or something –”
However, Madam Malkin took offense and rushed over. “I don't think there's any need for language like that!” Then she saw that Harry and his weasel had drawn their wands – probably tempted to hex Draco's mouth shut. “And I don't want wands drawn in my shop either!”
“I am, thank you for noticing!” She stated with a pleased smile. “I had a rather lovely afternoon throwing pots. I'd quite forgotten how much I loving doing it.”
Draco shook his head as if trying to shake away unpleasant ideas. “Why do I want to tickle you so badly?”
Despite what I make it sound like at the end, I do not have plans to continue this unless I get some irresistible plot bunnies, lol ^_^
for some reason.
Draco had a hard time eating, but he subtly cast tiny vanishing spells so that it looked like he was eating normally. As he ate, more lyrics floated through his mind.
These actions had both Crabbe and Goyle gaping at them in extreme confusion.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Hermione, unless that spell can somehow sneak me past a dragon, I really don't care!”
But Draco pressed a finger to his lips. “Quiet Harry, I'm already half asleep.”
“You let me violate you... you let me desecrate you... you let me penetrate you... you let me complicate you... Help me! I broke apart my insides... Help me! I've got no soul to sell... Help me! The only thing that works for me... help me get away from myself, I wanna fuck you like an animal... I wanna feel you from the inside... I wanna fuck you like an animal... my whole existence is flawed... you get me
“That he does!” Pansy exclaimed with a nod.
“Alright Ron,” Harry conceded, especially since he got a better look at himself and realized that Ron was right about them not looking the same after all.
“Yeah?” Harry prompted, feeling profoundly relieved that Draco wasn't already tired of the fact that Harry hadn't even had time to shag him yet.
“IT'S LUST TIME!!!” Everyone cried out in glee.
Draco accepted Harry's tender kiss almost passively for a moment. Inside him was a war over his need for platonic comfort and rest, and his need to shag Harry (and himself) senseless. Until nothing else mattered and he passed out from exhaustion. Suddenly, his passion responded to Harry's kiss by taking over and trying to consume Harry's very soul.
“My favorite,” Draco replied, smiling at her and taking the small square of chocolate so he could pop it in his mouth. After chewing and swallowing it, he looked dreamy again and gave her an adoring kiss.
“So, in the spirit of being up front, I feel I should let you know that when we get together, my group of friends and I tend to snog each other and do lascivious body shots – and I fully intend to participate. I just want you to know that no matter HOW into it I get, I'm NOT going to end up in anyone else's bed tonight,” Draco explained.
“I do...” Harry confirmed in a soft voice before kissing Draco.
Knowing that the classrooms on the seventh floor were rarely used for anything other than group practice and illicit romantic meetings, Harry decided that he could take a bit of a risk. Casting extra spells on the door to prevent anyone – such as Peeves – from hearing them or trying to come into the room, Harry (still holding Draco with one arm) quickly cast a spell to levitate a few desks together. Then he transfigured the lot of them into an actual bed. A big one that was as comfortable as Harry could make it.
Then all hell broke loose when Bella entered the room and immediately tried to summon the Dark Lord, only to spot a sword and scream orders that NO ONE could summon him until they knew exactly how and why the sword was there rather than in her vault.
you can understand why we would want to repay you for your selflessness and bravery.”
Once ready, he stopped the spinning and cut the pot off the wheel, setting it aside until he had a few more to fill the kiln he'd bought the moment he realized that this hobby of his actually worked decently well to help him relax.
Official meetings were held frequently and all of the Malfoys – Lucius had been freed from prison as a reward for Draco's good service – felt like unwelcome guests in their own home. One meeting in particular, a little over halfway through July, upset Draco more than he cared to admit, although probably everyone already knew it.
Little Miss Know It All whispered: “No don't, honestly, it's not worth it.”
Draco gave him a somewhat confused look. “I have no idea why, but I want to tickle and tease you.”
looked it all up, they can’t expel you, they just can’t, there’s provision
“What are you getting at?” Ron asked suspiciously.
But Harry didn't back down and Narcissa smiled unpleasantly at him. “I see that being Dumbledore's favorite has given you a false sense of security, Harry Potter. But Dumbledore won't always be there to protect you.”
And by that, he literally meant his bed, here in the Manor. The first few times, it had been a random thing in a hotel room. Then it had happened once or twice at Harry's place, but eventually, Draco had an urge to invite him back here, and they'd had their trysts here ever since.
They were somewhat interesting to learn as theories: “If your enemies are determined to murder you, you could always try to deter them by exploding their eyeballs or peeling their flesh right off their bones.” But Draco was actually sort of glad that the Dark Lord – and thus the Carrows – focused almost exclusively on using the Cruciatus Curse. It meant that as horrible as it was to torture his fellow students with it, he wasn't required to cast spells to boil them in oil or permanently break their legs.
When they were done with their showers, they wrapped towels around their waists and left the bathroom in a quest to get their pajamas on. Unfortunately, as they emerged from the bathroom attached to the dorm, Seamus was just about to enter it. As a result, he literally bumped into Harry and stumbled back a few steps. His face was already wearing a look that suggested he was wondering where to tickle Harry first, and his hand was already reaching out to do so.
“What took you so long?” Hermione asked in concern.
Any thought Draco had of pulling free from Harry's grasp and fleeing like a coward disappeared when Harry's mouth shifted to suck on his neck. This made his toes curl and his hands clutch the back of Harry's shirt. He didn't even notice at first that Harry was busy unbuttoning his suit jacket and shirt.
“Very little!” Pansy purred with a knowing grin even as she held up a pair of leather trousers that would look sexy as fuck on Draco.
After all, the Malfoys loved their son. They may not have understood his need to wait a while before considering marriage, but they only wanted what was best for him. If the three of them talked now, chances were good that they'd reach a nice agreement.
For one insane moment, he thought that the Dark Lord was threatening to have him bitten and he looked to his father to see if he was right. His father was steadfastly ignoring all humiliation by staring into his lap. His mother shook her head at him almost imperceptibly before resuming her deadpan staring at the opposite wall. Perhaps because Draco hadn't truly responded, the Lord grew bored and called an end to the laughing.
Harry kissed Draco and kept on kissing him until he forgot all about leaving.
Hermione thought this over for a moment. “Well, I suppose that it depends on what things you're talking about. If – for example – Cho kissed you when the curse was making her tickle you, then no, I don't think that would be because of the curse. I think it would be because she just wants to kiss you.”
The Dark Lord had taken a few minutes – after his resurrection and subsequent calling of his Death Eaters – to threaten them and tell them a bit about what had happened to him. He eventually got to a point where he nearly bragged that he had one Death Eater in particular who'd infiltrated Hogwarts and seen to it that Harry was here in this graveyard for his rebirth.
But what could Harry do? It was just one more thing that made his life seem weird. It's not like he had any friends he could ask what normal was.
His mother seemed to be on his side. As she had once promised, she would support Draco no matter what. Rather than side with her husband in pressing for a confirmation, she held up a wand.
Draco cautiously took a good look around his room in case a fellow Death Eater – or his Aunt – was sitting in a chair waiting for him to return. Seeing no one, and now suffering from paranoia that someone was lurking in his room under a Disillusion Charm, Draco relaxed just enough to summon his self inking quill.
Draco was strangely at peace. He knew he was dying, and just like he'd hoped, it was at the hands of a respected enemy. Someone who even the Dark Lord could not fault him for losing to. He would die an honorable death, and best of all, all his struggles were now over.
“If it helps, I'll tell her you had no choice in the matter,” Harry assured him. “But to be fair, she DID say that she knows you might occasionally have to do things as an Auror she might not like, so I think she'll understand.”
Hermione laughed and gave him a kiss on the cheek. “If you say so.”
“NO I DON'T WANT TO BE YOUR FRIEND! I WANT-!” Once again, Draco managed to slap a hand over his mouth and stop himself from blurting out shameful secrets. He turned away and gave another rather feeble attempt at escaping Harry's grasp.
“Oh?” Draco asked in curiosity.
“Froooozen inside without your touch, without your loove, darling, ooonly you are my life among the deaaaad.”
By this point, it was clear to everyone in the pub that this song was intended to incite lust. Draco was wearing a sleek and casual suit, but Pansy was wearing a sexy, flirty red dress, and as they danced, nearly
Harry gasped and rushed to kneel by his side. “No! Oh God no! Draco! I didn't... I didn't mean... DRACO!”
Pursing her lips in displeasure, she accepted this without comment.
But there was no answer. Honestly, Draco'd be surprised if Harry even had a chance to read his arm down there. Even so, he was getting worried. What if... What if Harry had drowned?
After Harry was dared to give Draco a blowjob and dragged him to the Potions' ingredient cupboard to do it, Draco is given a dare of his own...
“Fuck!” Harry roared, pulling free and Apparating away with all due haste.
He then looked over and noticed Harry giving him a concerned look. It took his mind a moment to clear away a foggy feeling, but then he sneered. “As I was saying,
The conversation went on, but Draco had already lost interest in it. He felt SO close to fixing this bloody buggering cabinet. Except that when he sent an object transfigured into a bird through as a test, it returned dead. In other words, he'd failed once again. With a mopey sigh, he lay down on a dusty OLD divan and took a nap.
Draco was silent for a long time. He didn't fidget, nor did he hold Harry in return. He simply... let his mind go blank. After a long time – perhaps even a couple of hours – he took a cleansing breath.
Sighing, Harry carefully got them both dressed, casting a lightening spell on Draco so he could dress him like a child. After they were both dressed and had all their belongings, Harry lifted Draco over his shoulder – thankful that the lightening spell made this possible – and then carried him all the way to the entrance to the Slytherin common room.
“About bloody time!” Draco cried out when his friends arrived in his favorite shop.
?!?!?!” His parents roared in unison.
Lucius tilted his head to the side suspiciously. “Doing what?”
Suddenly, an odd prickling along his senses made him stop compulsively smoothing the bag designed to keep his new suit perfect and look over at the only other person in the lift.
Draco flung his hand out to indicate Hermione. “I absolutely DO NOT have any such illegal things in the same house as the future MINISTER FOR MAGIC!”
“Ah, I see. Well I guess I wouldn't mind. All I really want is to travel the world and take pictures, so really, I might not BE home long enough to create those heirs anyway.”
At this point, enough of the audience was tipsy enough that they leered at her and promised to touch her all night if she wanted. And not all of the promisers were men! Grinning and winking at a couple of the ones she was interested in, Pansy kept control of the microphone after her song was over.
“Well I don't know about you bloody Gryffindors, but when we Slytherins get together to drink and –
But Harry cut him off by grabbing him and pulling him close for a demanding kiss. Draco stiffened in protest for about two seconds, and then relaxed into the kiss. When his hands found their way into Harry's hair, Harry responded by Apparating them both back to his bedroom.
Ron gave Hermione a brilliant grin. “I think you're brilliant. Best witch I've ever met.”
This gave Harry an opening to advance his real mission. “Oh? Malfoy managed to be nice to someone? That's unexpected. Tell me, when did you two meet?”
that she could see despite the distance and bad lighting. “And why in the ever loving
that Harry didn't even notice because he was so caught up in all that pale skin and that devilish smirk and those smoky eyes and that disheveled hair and MMM! The whole bloody package!
“Ah, understandable,” Amanda murmured with an adoring smile.
bouncing in their seat and migrating to the dance floor.
*****
“I think it'll just be easiest to lick them off his spine.”
The two of them paused to kiss for nearly a minute before Harry wiggled impatiently. “Look, that's getting a bit uncomfortable. Move or something!”
Over their shoulders, each saw a sudden flare of golden red light. Narcissa let out a rich laugh because her husband was once again wide eyed and gobsmacked. She almost sounded like she was purring when she announced: “And now that you have fully decided that your Bond is Romantic rather than Platonic, and accepted it as what you both truly desire, the bond has activated to it's fullest. But as to that, I can't say a word. You'll have to figure it out on your own.”
And then he would do the one last thing he had left to do before he could slip off to be with Harry again. He'd find someone – anyone, it made no difference to him at this point – to have a child with so that he could ensure that centuries if not millennium of Malfoys did not die out with him. He'd try to find a little peace, raise his child with all the love he could not give Harry, and then join him when his child no longer needed him.
“Good to know,” Harry murmured as he squinted into the flask and prepared to down a gulp. He had already stripped off, even discarding his pants since they were his favorite and he didn't want to risk ruining them.
“I thought that I've been hurt before, but no one's ever left me quite this sore, your words cut deeper than a knife, now I need someone to breathe me back to life.”
“Will do,” Harry promised.
Then it was Draco's turn: “Feels so good being bad, there's no way I'm turning back, now that pain is my pleasure, nothing can measure.”
Draco HATED seeing his mother upset, no matter how much she was trying to hide it, and so turned his glare on Harry. “It's not about YOU,
Still confused but willing to do anything her Lord ordered, Bellatrix lifted her skirt high enough that she could step her feet to either side of Harry's hands, lower herself until her knees were pinning down his arms, and then more or less sit on his head. His laughing and the fact that it was clearly involuntary made her... surprisingly into it.
Then she sat up abruptly and faced her watchers. “He's dead!”
Harry pulled Draco into his arms and hugged him tight. “Please tell me, I'm just going to do whatever it takes to find out anyway.”
After that, neither wrote anything for a long time.
Draco glared at his father unappreciatively. “Is this your subtle way of asking me if I got my
Sighing, Draco nearly decided to Apparate right back home, but since the Gryffindor table and the Slytherin table were on complete opposite sides of the pub, it wasn't a hardship to avoid Harry if he just stayed where they were.
Draco sighed again, knowing that this would get them nowhere. He held out a hand to Harry. “Shut up and come here. It'll be a tight squeeze, but you can lay here next to me until I fall asleep, but Salazar help you if you fall asleep next to me and get caught!”
This had a rather unexpected effect: Draco stopped. He pulled back slightly to look at Harry, who turned his head to look him in the eye. The two stared at each other for a long moment.
like an emergency crew was on its way to rescue them without anyone actually trying to do so...
Draco very quickly informed the man that he'd worked out a plan to fix up a vanishing cabinet that was connected – he was reasonably certain – to the one in the shop. The more Draco talked at first, the more into his explanation he got, even using his hands to illustrate his point. Mr. Borgin went from looking a little interested to strangely resentful. Maybe even a little afraid.
The next morning, two loud gasps followed by a loud crash tore Harry and Draco from their sleep.
Needing no further invitation, Draco picked a medium pace to begin with, making little grunts and moans as his body continually felt like a pixie was punching him with pleasure. Even Harry was gasping and panting and making noises that reassured Draco. They both focused on what was happening to the point that Draco didn't even feel Harry digging his nails into his back.
Harry wasn't sure whether to say anything or not. He was about 90 percent certain that the poisons all flashed black, red, or some combination containing black or red, and so, this shouldn't kill the irritating git. Instead, he shook his head.
Draco felt it more than heard it when Harry left. He lifted his head just enough to look, and then lay back down. Stroking his left forearm – under his tattoo glamoured Dark Mark – he murmured: “It's not true, I love you, but what good does that do me?” Sighing, he shifted until he was more comfortable, and then really did drift off.
Harry literally had to hold onto the chair he was sitting in in order to stop himself from running up on that stage and snogging the bloody fuck out of Draco at the end with he finished off with: “
To help him get over his nerves, Ron ordered a couple rounds of Brewdog Punk IPA to work their way through until Harry gathered up his nerve. Harry was an Auror, for Merlin's sake! Being confident was literally in his job description!
Meanwhile, Ron was sputtering: “Ah, er, er, uh, er, ah, huh???”
But this didn't deter Vernon. He reached out with both hands and tickled Harry anywhere he could reach as Harry rolled around on his bed. When Harry fell off his bed to land at Vernon's feet, the large man squatted with great difficulty so that he could continue the torturous wiggling of his fingers all over Harry's body. Not even his denims and thick cotton tee shirt provided much defense.
Rather than run off like he wanted to, Draco studied his sexy black dragon hide boots. “You think about me?”
Draco checked his watch and sighed. “They'd better!”
Harry gasped and pressed a hand to his chest, astonished to find that that one simple action had hurt him far more than all the tiny bombs combined. Hermione pulled him into a hug, humming faintly as she rubbed his back. Meanwhile, Ron was inspecting what was left of the pile of bombs, even going so far as to throw one at his arm to see what it felt like.
With a surprising amount of concentration – considering that he really thought he'd dwell on his problems – Harry shaped and molded the clay into a rather nice pot. The size and shape of it would make for a lovely flower pot – and since he was making so many of them in an attempt to keep his mind quiet, he might just have to give the lot of them to Neville for his flower shop.
Thus, Harry kissed Draco. It was a soft kiss with no expectations. At first, Draco seemed to sort of pause – as if he was not entirely sure if it was actually happening or not. Then he made a sound of disbelief and pulled back so slightly that their lips didn't even separate. Next, he tilted his head in curiosity, making a speculative noise. Finally, he softened his mouth and leaned forward just enough to make it clear he was returning the kiss.
“Like what?” Harry asked out of sheer reflexive curiosity.
Taking a breath to shake off his negative thoughts, he dipped his hands in the bucket of water and made sure they were nice and wet. Then he placed them on the clay and started the wheel spinning fast. With a slight but firm forward push, Harry shaped the clay into a bit of a column before flattening it – sort of ensuring that the clay was nice and mixed with no air pockets. Once it was ready, he pressed his thumbs into the center, and then with a finger and his other hand for support, opened up a well going to about a half inch from the bottom.
Harry was shocked to see that Draco looked not just panicked or frantic, but genuinely close to crying. He let go of Draco's arm and blew out a heavy sigh. “I'm sorry, Malfoy. I just... you bloody baffle me, you know? Even now that the war is over and I KNOW you're not trying to help a madman take over the world, I can't seem to get you out of my head.”
Harry laughed at that, his stomach suddenly agreeing with that assessment. Feeling happier than he thought he'd be so soon after recent events, he summoned his clothes and got dressed too. Just before they left the forest, Harry took Draco's hand in his.
“Oh, just that you haven't come over for poker, or shopping, or just to drink and chat since... hmm... the night I dared you to sing at the Leaky,” she pointed out.
Harry kissed him possessively. “Only if you want it to be.”
“I always want to give you whatever you want,” Draco said, and then immediately looked like he was wondering why he said that.
Draco was silent for a long moment as he picked apart those words and analyzed them all. They sounded fairly straight forward, but how could they be? “But Harry... you HAVEN'T been happy lately. You've been broody and almost never smile anymore.”
Draco gave them a look that made it clear he wasn't going to say a word on the subject. Sighing in defeat because they knew he'd NEVER give in if he didn't want to, they looked around the shop and gathered up things for him to try on. It was a LONG couple of hours before they finally found the perfect thing. By that point, they almost didn't have time to get ready before meeting their other friends at The Club.
“Ah!” Auror Ginger crowed in delight. “So you've used this potion before. You naughty
They both nodded with light blushes.
Harry was perversely enjoying watching his students struggle along from his vantage point of a floating tower above the center of the Maze.
“Stop your bitching, darling, and get up here!” Pansy commanded. “And since this is because you owe me a dare,
This made Harry wonder what she planned to do, and if he still had any sort of obligation to stop her now that he was no longer an Auror. With a shrug, he decided that unless she threatened the pointy git's life, he'd just ignore it and let things play out.
Astoria giggled as the drop was placed on her nipple. “My sister told me all about this place and we agreed that I simply HAD to come here at least once before our parents insist that I get married and be a good little wife.”
Harry held up his hands as if surrendering.
“Oh, won't you stay with me, 'cuz you're all I need, this ain't love, it's clear to see, but darling, stay with me!”
As the deep star-studded black of night faded toward morning, their spirit visitors also faded. But by the time they were gone for good, they had hugged and said everything they needed to say to Harry and his kids. All in all, it was one of the best nights of Harry's life, and he went to bed feeling utterly at peace with the world.
about such a thing,” Lucius added.
“Deal!”
Until Draco made what sounded like a threat toward Sirius. That made Harry want to hex him all over again. As he lay in bed that night, he decided to write on his arm.
that all the Slytherins would be in a sleazy place like this,” Ron muttered unappreciatively.
Indira pushed Scorpius through the door so that she could follow him. “It was James' fault!”
To Harry's surprise, Draco cornered him in the boys' bathroom closest to the Great Hall, after they'd finished eating dinner – when he'd told Ron and Hermione to go on without him. Harry had just finished up using the urinal and was washing his hands, when Draco entered the bathroom and roughly shoved him into the nearest stall. They were all empty, so Harry was deeply confused about sharing a stall. Especially since he'd just went!
Blaise exclaimed with a nearly evil smirk.
His parents were baffled now. “Then how could he cheat on you?”
Harry didn't quite know what to think of that. He thought and thought, but nothing seemed right. Finally, he decided that an imaginary friend would HAVE to think he was special.
Draco felt inexplicably happy to hear that. “Been a long time then?”
Hermione couldn't help but giggle, which she hastily covered with a hand. Draco turned to glare at her. Harry simply spun around to see what was so funny, even as Ron was giving her a look that said: they're nutters, the both of them!
Draco moaned softly in denial. “No, mother, please...”
Harry didn't want to think just now how maybe all the times they'd kissed and shagged had been the real act and this was Draco's true self. That was just too depressing to contemplate!
Lily1 looked scandalized. “OUR son has this many children?!?!”
Harry glared right back at him, adding a pointing finger. “All I'm saying is that you shouldn't just throw your parents away so easily!”
Draco relaxed, feeling infinitely better with Harry's arms around him and a promise not to pester him for the moment. He rested his head on Harry's shoulder. A large part of him wanted nothing more than to fall asleep and get some actual rest while Harry was there to protect him from everything.
to let him off stage. “Darling, that was the expected song for you to sing.”
Harry chuckled. “It's a proper flat, it's just that I didn't need a lot of space and am actually used to cramped living quarters, so...” he shrugged. “Why get a bigger place?”
He smiled at the students listening to him. “Once you have reached the center of the Maze, there is a flag. I placed it there myself and have tested it rigorously for tampering. It's behind a lot of wards that are designed to let in ONLY authorized students – meaning that no one can get to it to tamper with it now that it's in the Maze. Thus, when you reach it – the first team to do so will grab it and attempt to get it to me as soon as possible.
“Nope, nothing wrong at all. Alright there?”
The woman carefully administered just one drop of potion in the indicated spot, and then watched as Harry bent over (Huh! Ron was SHORTER than him in these bodies!) and licked the drop off his neck.
Harry inhaled a gasp of shock as he received his very first kiss. Not knowing what to do, he closed his eyes and gently placed his hands on Draco's chest. He had no experience to compare it to, but this kiss was... powerful! Almost electric. Moaning, he opened his mouth.
People gave him drinks and Draco more or less shrugged as he accepted them and drank them. He even saw when people spiked those drinks with various things and drank them anyway. When it got to the point that they were openly offering him drugs and potions that could be harmful – and Draco took them anyway – that's when Harry got fed up.
Draco wanted to laugh and give Harry a few more kisses, but they couldn't risk anyone seeing them now that the door was open. Besides, Harry was already under his cloak and – presumably – rushing back to his dorm. Happy for the moment at least, Draco swaggered back to his own dorm, crawled into bed, and passed out with a stupid smile still on his face.
When the song was over, after a lengthy outro that Pansy danced him through, she took the microphone and
Draco chuckled softly. “Just random meaningless practice.”
As it was being sung, Draco felt justified in slinking off to the loo until he could come up with a good excuse before Pansy dragged him up on stage again.
Even better, when he was done and back in his rather messy room, it was to find his mattress flipped over – the strong smell of cleaner suggesting it had been washed first – and was now covered in crisp and fresh smelling sheets. Sighing in relief, Harry climbed into bed and... obsessed over why in the bloody hell his friends were ignoring him.
Terry grinned at him. “So... you in?”
Harry shifted to give Draco a soft and tender kiss. They simply kissed each other for long enough that it would have turned heated, except Draco chuckled ruefully. “Sadly, I'm in no condition to do anything even if I wanted to – which, I kind of do.”
“Like the fact that I'm arse over tits in love with you,” Draco stated before he realized what he was saying, and then gasped as it hit him. Ready to murder himself, he stepped away so that he'd have room to Apparate.
Harry looked him over curiously but otherwise said nothing for a long time. As the minutes passed, Draco's agitation grew. He also kept checking his watch. As 9 PM drew nearer, he lost all patience and pounded on the call for help button several times.
Holding his breath until the stinging in his eyes stopped, Draco wiped them and stood up. He needed to wait to grieve. To push his feelings for Harry aside and hide them – as he had always done – until he could be certain he had the time and privacy to break down. Slipping out of the second floor broom closet, he joined a crowd of people flowing outside to see the body for themselves.
Draco laughed softly. “No. I already told you, Potter, that most of this has been in my wank bank for a while. I just... I don't think I would have ever seriously thought about giving it a go had your curse not made the impulse impossible to resist.”
Before he could decide to do exactly that, a slight draft made him shiver just a bit and look toward the door off to their right. A new man had just strutted in and was now scanning the crowd on the dance floor with single minded determination.
Wouldn't it be better to have – such as muggles had with their guns – a spell that could defeat an attacker instantly by killing them?
The next evening, Harry was locked in his room so the Dursleys could leave for a bit, only to be shocked when nearly a dozen people showed up to escort him to a safe place. At first, it was dark, but then a witch named Tonks used a Lumos. Harry rushed to shake hands with Lupin, who frowned in confusion when his other hand immediately tried to tickle Harry's side. The other witches and wizards crowded in with outstretched hands until Moody Disillusioned him and that seemed to curb their enthusiasm.
Lucius did not appreciate that and gave him a look clearly stating as much. “Fine. Setting that aside, this is THAT POTTER BRAT that we're talking about. Why in the bloody hell would you make any sort of commitment to him???”
The waitress looked ready to roll her eyes. “That's our most popular ale, I assure you, it's not swill.”
Harry groaned and tore at his hair as he paced. Eventually he decided to just forget this whole dilemma and focus on the bloody egg. So, taking Cedric's advice, he lugged it off to the Prefects' bathroom to take a bath with it.
By this point, most of the other Professors were able to join them. The way Final Exams were spread out during normal years – 5 out of the 7 years had to take their exams during normal class time, as obviously the OWL and NEWT students took theirs separately. But since Harry was monopolizing the entire Fourth and Sixth Years for an entire day (possibly two depending on how things went), the rest of the teachers were only able to test the first three years. Which meant they had a bit of time to come and watch Harry's exam.
Draco was mesmerized. Harry's voice was smooth and gentle when needed, and yet angsty and full of emotion as the song required. The song itself alternated between slower parts and faster ones. One of the slower bits held Draco's interest as it brought to mind images of their weekend together.
He was at the stairs by this point, and the acoustics in the entire grand staircase were so good that he couldn't help but take advantage of them as he lightly jogged down the stairs a bit before magically sliding the rest of the way down the ornate banister.
Encouraged, Harry opened his mouth and used his tongue to lick Draco's open too. This pulled a happy little grunt from Harry. They both got lost for a bit, simply kissing and exploring each other's mouths. After a bit, Draco pulled back to look at Harry suspiciously.
Harry was ready to start shouting obscenities at him again, but since Draco turned his attention to unbuttoning his shirt, Harry quickly shut his mouth and enjoyed the show. After the third button, Draco had an odd frown cross his face and muttered to himself: “Why am I bloody doing it by hand???”
Harry pulled back to look Draco in the eye. Draco gulped nervously because it was a seriously look. Almost... deadly...
Eventually, she finished. “There! Now go rinse off and get dressed before your Uncle gets home. And wear a shirt with long sleeves!”
is that I don't want to tell YOU anything!”
“So... what would happen if we took all of that smaller bottle you're holding?” Harry wondered.
Draco snorted in amusement. “I'm under the influence of a bloody TRUTH potion! It can't make me do anything I don't want to except for tell the truth!”
Ernie Macmillan paled and shook a little as he stood up and walked over to Padma. Then he gave her something that looked a cross between a smile and a grimace. “Hi...” he greeted before leaning over and kissing her quite thoroughly.
A moment later, Draco released all the spells currently on Harry, who sighed happily and rolled over so that he could stretch out and wiggle all his muscles to see if he had any kinks that needed to be worked out. Draco watched him in mild amusement.
Harry looked like he gasped in a deep breath so that he could keep up with the fast pace of the song, but he was doing an astonishing job singing the fast lyrics without tripping over them. Apparently Harry CAN sing! Fortunately, the pace slowed down for a moment so he actually could breathe.
“No,” Harry murmured softly in his ear. “I was just trying to let you make such a big decision once you were
WORSE! This was the second time that Draco had tried to slip something deadly to Dumbledore without getting caught or letting fingers point in his direction, only for the plan to fail spectacularly. His only real saving grace at the moment was that these things proved that he was trying, which was more than anyone else could do at the moment.
“Yeah alright,” Harry agreed with a reluctant sigh.
Unfortunately for Draco, he only made Harry all the more angry when he made fun of Hagrid to Umbridge. And then angrier still when he made fun of Ron on their way to the next class. At this rate, Harry was definitely going to punch him again!
His father forced him to get closer and take a better look.
sexy in his shiny black leather trousers and sheer silver button up shirt. He confidently gestured to the waitress attending that section of The Club. “A round of Firewhiskey for everyone!”
“Ah, I see,” Ginger murmured. “In any case, warning, the hairs really were collected from random muggles, and so – aside from the fact that they were verified to be human – I have no idea who you'll become or what you'll look like.”
“Er...” Harry looked to the ceiling as he thought about what to sing. Very softly, he tried a bit of nonsense. “I'm gonna pick up the pieces and build a
“Draco lick a drop off my nipple?”
Hermione was convinced this was a good idea, but Ron was the same opinion as Harry – that he'd rather suffer the nightmares than have to take extra lesson from Snape.
“That's surprisingly generous of you, Malfoy,” Harry remarked in surprise.
“Where you going?” Harry asked curiously.
Honestly, that was not so surprising since Hufflepuffs were excellent finders. The problem came about when Hunter and the Ravenclaws made it to the center of the Maze, realized that the flag wasn't there, and did their absolute best to steal it from Hufflepuff. The other two Houses weren't far behind.
But he was dead certain that wouldn't go over very well.
Hermione shook her head. “NO, because I don't really want our kids to know all the kinky details of our night.”
“YOU may NOT call me Harry.”
Harry looked to the ceiling. “If... If I...” He scoffed slightly and shook his head. “If I'd NEVER been let out of the Dursley's house... If I'd never made friends... I'd probably be a broken and useless shell of a person. But I did make friends, and my friends have been there for me through thick and thin. They've become the family I never had. Without them, I'd...” he trailed off with a shake of his head.
“Good news, my lovelies! It's time for Karaoke to start! And remember, if you're not singing, you're dancing! House rules! Anyone NOT following the rules will be heckled relentlessly, insulted thoroughly, and even evicted with extreme melodrama!”
“Well now!” An astonished voice exclaimed in surprise.
See, he'd been forced to deny it for so long that he'd come to believe it. Despite being bonded to Draco Malfoy, he could never admit it. They could never be together. And yet, when he was alone at night, it was not Ginny he thought of. Not Ginny he longed for.
Within minutes, Blaise announced that it was time to begin. He loaded the first song and called Pansy up to sing it. She grinned smugly – having put her name down to be first after the last Karaoke night had been such a success. She got up on stage and sang
Ron pulled out his wand to hex Draco, but Hermione forced him not to.
The two of them were almost frantic, tearing at each other's clothes in their haste to be together as soon as possible. The moment they were both naked, Harry cast all the quick prep spells that Draco had taught him on himself. Then he lifted himself onto the nearest desk so that he could pull Draco into him and wrap his legs around him.
“Because he offered and I didn't have a good reason to decline,” Draco stated, feeling strangely calmer now.
Harry sighed in frustration, running a hand through his hair, highly tempted to just yank it all out. “Look, I don't think you should be alone at the moment, so even though my flat is tiny – probably cramped compared to what you're used to – I'm going to tuck you into my bed and let you sleep until you're feeling better. I'll hex you to sleep if I have to!”
After that, Draco graciously declined another encore, allowing the next woman on the list to come up and sing: “You got me feelin'
Harry felt an enormous weight press down on him, making his heart speed up like he needed to run away again, but he pushed that feeling away and nodded. Carefully, he set the plate aside and crawled into bed so that he could pull Draco close and hold him for as long as he needed.
Taking advantage of the fact that Draco was thoroughly distracted, Harry lifted him up and carried him onto the bed so that he could conjure up some Gryffindor ties and bind Draco's hands to the head board. Then he shifted to focus on working the rest of Draco's clothes off.
Draco savored the armful of Harry for a long moment before pushing him away. “Listen, this thing between us doesn't seem to be working. We don't talk unless we're arguing about something. The only time we seem to get along is when we're shagging, and as much as I'd rather give up my soul than give up you, I think that you would be happier with someone else.”
He paused the actual song for a few minutes so that he could lose himself in some vocalization, but then repeated the Chorus.
“Mmmhmm!” The woman purred in agreement. The Potion Seller counted out exactly 12 drops, and then everyone watched in fascination as Blaise got to work slowly licking them off.
Even so, the thought that Harry was trying to get someone in particular to date him had Draco feeling nauseous and rather ill. He almost couldn't concentrate when Daphne and Theo went up to sing a heated mashup of
And then it was gone and Harry could hear the Death Eaters laughing even as Voldemort watched him with interest. “You see, I think, how foolish it was to suppose that this boy could ever have been stronger than me. But I want there to be no mistake in anybody's mind. Harry Potter escaped me by lucky chance, and I'm now going to prove my power by killing him, here and now, in front of you all, when there is no Dumbledore to help him, and no mother to die for him. I will give him his chance. He will be allowed to fight, and you will be left in no doubt which of us is the stronger. Just a little longer, Nagini,” he whispered to his snake, which slithered away to where his Death Eaters stood watching.
“I think of you every night and day, you took my heart and you took my pride away, I HATE myself for loving you, can't break free from the things that you do, I wanna walk but I run back to you, that's why I hate myself for loving you!”
Draco looked over his shoulder at Harry with a dark glare. “I'd rather murder myself than be a werewolf!”
Back at Hogwarts, the crowd burst into raucous celebration, assuming that Harry and or Cedric had just won the TriWizard Tournament. Only... nothing could be further from the truth...
Draco said nothing since it was a promise he didn't think he could make. Faint tickling prompted him to raise the arm that his mother still held the hand of. They both looked at the spot his pajamas – that Madam Pomfrey simply must have spelled him into – revealed above his wrist. Narcissa gently pulled up his sleeve so that they could read what was written.
More than willing, Draco did exactly that, thrusting into Harry so fast and hard that both of them couldn't help but gasp out: “Ah ah ah!” Both felt something akin to lava rolling over them, which made Harry unable to catch his breath for a moment before a squeal escaped him and just wouldn't stop.
Harry did his best to ignore him, but God damn! WHY did his Soulmate have to be such an infuriating, foul, nasty bastard jerk arsehole sonovabitch?! ARGH!!!
“Oh won't you stay with me, 'cuz you're all I need, this ain't love it's clear to see, but darling, stay with me!”
Draco inexplicably preened at that. “Ah, I see now, you're confusing well bred manners with whatever you're used to from your...” he flapped his hand as he tried to decide on the best word. “Friends...” he opted for, in an attempt to be 'nice.'
The other Unforgivable Curses were harder to justify learning, but Draco could still think of a few reasonable cases. Perhaps a child was about to run off a cliff because they weren't looking where they were running. A quick Imperio followed by a command to stop might be far more effective than any sort of warning. Even a precisely cast Cruciatus Curse could be welcome, if used by someone trusted on someone who enjoyed pain and wanted it in small doses.
Unbidden, lyrics floated through Draco's mind:
Since Draco had already been dancing all over the exercise area of his room, he swept her into the dance with him.
Draco felt as if Harry had just ripped his heart from his chest and trampled it into the ground. That was a polite thanks but no thanks if he'd ever heard one. He suddenly felt the need to be alone so that he could react in peace, so he stood up.
His friend looked utterly sour all of a sudden. “Man! Why do
He wasn't the only one. Harry held him tight and sighed from both bliss and relief. He delayed the shagging he'd insisted on by kissing Draco again.
That led to a conversation about Cho's feelings until Ron discovered that Hermione was writing to Viktor Krum, and THAT provoked some blessed silence as Ron stewed for a bit. Then they went to their dorms. Harry drifted off utterly confused about Cho and girls in general. He sincerely wished that they taught a class on how to understand how a girl's brain worked.
Harry stopped listening again, since it sounded like she was going to go on and on for quite some time. So... maybe his friend wasn't so imaginary after all.
“Hmmm....” Draco hummed happily as he stretched out in Harry's bed. It may not be much, but Harry wanted to spend time with him. They'd more or less agreed to date! It may not be a marriage proposal, but Draco could wait. The important thing was that they were going to try and Draco would be DAMNED if he let anything tear them apart now!
