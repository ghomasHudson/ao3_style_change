They would not be deterred, though Draco was successful in sending Shardlow back to bed and Zeller back to the Hufflepuff common room. The two girls shared a look, but looked properly abashed once Draco glared them down.
They get dressed quickly, walking out of the classroom and into an uncomfortable and tense stare-down. Hermione is vibrating with self-righteousness. Malfoy drips with unwarranted self-satisfaction. Possibly Harry should have said he
Draco, in the middle of casting a freshening charm on himself, stopped mid-motion. “I suppose,” he said slowly. He was still doing what he could to help Hogwarts’ magic get back to her natural state so that she could repair herself. The battle had raged over every inch of it, making worse the dark magic that was cast daily during his seventh year, in endless repetitions; and Draco was only a drop in its endless well. The columns in the west cloisters were still smashed on one side. The interior garden was still in ruins. If it was a conversation, Draco was not good at keeping it going forward.
“Do all Muggle tales end like that?” Draco asked, because the text on the page was clearly the end of a story. “‘And they lived happily ever after’? What bollocks.”
They sit in the quiet for several minutes, until their breathing evens out; it’s the sort of quiet that means it’s okay for Harry to burrow into Malfoy’s side, seeking the scent that will follow him long after they’ve parted, for Malfoy to run his fingers through Harry’s curls, detangling the knots in an absent sort of way. These are fragile silences.
, the one who wanted another option and ended up choosing Harry’s trainwreck of a destiny to hinge his own life on. This is the Malfoy that infuriates him.
?” Malfoy asks, insistent, and that’s the thing about Malfoy, isn’t it? He can never let a thing lie, but is equally incapable of talking in a straight line.
even in a Weasley sweater paired with sleep pants. Malfoy looked nice in his uniform, even, which was another patently unfair thing. Surely no one was meant to look
For the first time, the full force of the impossibility of what they’re doing hits Harry. Malfoy is a
Malfoy is quiet while Harry ties the letter to Hedwig’s leg, wincing slightly when she insists on stepping onto his arm—her talons are sharp enough to feel through his layers—rather than taking flight directly from the perch.
Potter’s mouth quirked upwards, the tension falling off his shoulders. He kicked Draco back, left his foot knocked against Draco’s when he said, “Help me carry these to Madam Pince’s desk?”
“I shouldn’t have,” Draco started, but couldn’t finish the thought, caught instead by the words he could hear behind him:
“I heard about the pensieve,” Professor Sinistra began. Draco sloshed half his cup into his lap. Oh, but he was in trouble. “Explain your reasoning.”
Draco sneered and tried valiantly not to. He knew perfectly well that if Potter wanted to find him, all he had to do was open up that sodding map of his.
“I didn’t exactly get a timetable for lessons with Dumbledore,” Harry snaps automatically, as he crosses to the desk. But the coldness in his fingers has moved into his mouth; it steals the heat from the words. He can’t meet Malfoy’s eyes.
with the sort of cool, clear-headedness that he associates with withheld meals and the sound of his cupboard under the stairs locking.
Creevey, of course, had an idea for this, though it didn’t come to fruition until the next day, after he’d sent an urgent owl to his father.
“Okay?” Draco wanted to point out that Potter was an aggressively average flier that could nevertheless help, but had a feeling that Potter was in fact going to propose something much worse.
It’s Ron, their collective heart, their cool under pressure, their big picture, who fills Harry’s silence with the more uncomfortable question. “What is it about Malfoy? Really?”
Two days later, Draco was summoned to the Headmistress’ office during his morning free period. Officer Abbott-Jones was taking tea with Headmistress McGonagall when he arrived.
anything," Malfoy answered. He lifted one pale hand and traced the wisping colors swirling through the night sky. "It
Draco’s chest pulsed painfully and he didn’t understand why. He couldn’t answer; his throat was still too dry, and his heartbeat was still too loud, and Potter was still entirely too close.
The letter stared at Draco from its spot on the desktop and Draco, still feeling embarrassed by its existence, darted his hand forward to crush it and possibly burn it. Potter, clearly noticing, immediately lunged for it.
And before he could open his mouth, the sky exploded into color. A gasp got stuck in Harry’s throat as indistinct splashes of color popped into the air, casting them in sudden light. When Harry sat up, he realized that he could see the wisps of color around the castle, too, high in the sky near the towers.
“Oh, very good, Mr. Malfoy,” Professor Flitwick squeaked, as Draco came to the end of the elemental charms, wand arm shaking with the effort of conjuring miniature gales and thunderstorms, proper ones and not the simple illusory weather charms of fourth year. “Consider looking at the section on atmospheric interference again, otherwise you’ve nearly got it. I don’t suppose you could demonstrate the structural magic charms?”
“I had to write Officer Abbott-Jones,” Draco answered. He shook the parchment in his hand demonstratively.
In any case, he could help the castle, so he did; Draco filled up a full page to describe the damage, and another to detail the repairs that he had completed. He felt brighter, almost, by the time he was drying the ink and slipping into his emerald-lined robes.
This is the quietest nightmare Harry has: there is a pool, and he is drowning. The pool is as deep and dark as the Great Lake, though it didn’t seem that way when Harry first had the nightmare. That came later.
The spectators had already made their hasty exits, as if they hadn’t even noticed the adult shouting at a
But of course Potter heard. “‘S’okay,” he said, stepping closer to speak over the squeal of the train coming to a stop. “Wasn’t expecting anything, really.”
Draco’s mouth twisted into an unpleasant smile. “And yet here I am,” he said, with more confidence than he properly felt.
Draco sat up, blinking hard through the sleep in his eyes. “What’s wrong?” he asked, because something had to be, for his mother to look so rattled.
“You can’t change it.” Malfoy’s voice is clinical, like he’s run diagnostics and is just informing Harry of the results. It’s at odds with the tension wound through Malfoy, a thrum that Harry can feel alongside his own rage and incomprehension.
Harry grimaces, the dream fading. It was half memory, the feeling of Malfoy’s fingers twisting in his hair, the pink flush rushing up his neck. Harry knows that much. He
It turned out that there was a record for most consecutive house points lost in a single evening, and that the combination of over thirty students from various houses losing two hundred points a piece neatly smashed that record. It also led to most of the houses being so deep in the negatives that it was quite possible that the House Cup would go by default to whichever house managed to get closest to zero.
Draco’s breathing felt a little quick. “So that’s it, is it? I’m a bit sad about it all, so we’ve moved right along to pitying me?”
A month into the school year, Officer Abbott-Jones came to Hogwarts for Draco’s first parole check-in. Draco’s pulse, which had been stuttering nervously since he received the Headmistress’ summons that morning, rocked abruptly upwards at the sight of Officer Abbott-Jones already sitting in one of the foreboding chairs opposite the Headmistress’ desk.
“I don’t,” Potter said, but he took a step back. Color crept into his face. Suspicious, Draco kicked up a leg, throwing Potter off balance, then stood and shot forward, catching Potter by the front of his Muggle jumper. There was a strange pocket in the front, and Draco wasn’t
Draco couldn’t look the Headmistress in the eyes during these Wednesday morning meetings, because he feared the words would spill out of him if he did, hot and molten the way he was no longer allowed to be. He wouldn’t dare. He couldn’t.
“It wouldn’t hurt to ask him, then,” Draco said, realizing that he was going to do something very foolish solely because he had the inkling that Astoria did not wish to be left alone.
Narcissa passed a hand through his hair, peering carefully at his face in the dim light. Draco stilled, feeling his hair settle at his nape. She said, slow and thoughtful, “I see.”
The Battle rose again as students shifted, drawing tighter around each other in the foreign land of the once familiar common room. A half-dozen arguments sounded in the echoing dungeon, wands in hand over everything from Slytherins sitting at the Hufflepuff table to the trials still being reported in the
to render the parchment blank, then stared at it so hard that his eyes crossed. His head was beginning to pulse with a headache.
, Draco thought, and laughed, brought to his knees from the pain, his forehead pressed against the damp grass.
The snow glitters as the Hogwarts Express picks up speed, a rush of white and green and grey blurring together as they begin the long trek back towards Platform 9 and 3/4. Harry curls his palm around the galleon, tucks his nose into his scarf, and breathes.
Officer Abbott-Jones closed the door behind her and let out an overly large breath. “Sorry about this,” she said, and sounded it. She even undid the binding charm, the lavender chord dissipating like mist. “But we still need to get your check-in done.”
Draco looked away first, spine cracking unpleasantly with the movement. Most of his dinner was still on his plate, but he couldn’t imagine enacting all the steps necessary to finish eating: to pick up his knife and fork, to direct it towards the chicken, to cut it, to lift it, to chew, to swallow, to do it all again, until his plate was clean. It was too much. It was, abruptly, the most trying thing Draco had faced since his release to the Manor, where his mother, wispy and indistinct in her grief, had explained that the aurors had not allowed them to reinstate the wards on it, that in any case the Ministry would be taking it when summer melted into autumn, that Narcissa Malfoy was now looking for flats to rent.
,” Greg said, and suddenly he was standing, looking furious. “You never do stuff just because someone else asks unless it’s your bloody
“I don’t…” Draco bit the inside of his lip and saw Potter’s eyes follow the movement. “It’s only,” he started, stopping again.
Harry knows this, even if Malfoy might not, because Harry’s body is well-acquainted with not fitting within his skin and his hands are familiar with becoming clumsy. Malfoy does not have clumsy hands. Malfoy’s hands are beautiful, long and sure and strong, painting pictures in the air and across the expanse of Harry’s body like the universe itself wanted for a masterpiece and found it in the angle of his wrists and the crook of his fingers.
Draco waved a hand vaguely, then immediately put it back down, gut swooping at the sensation of being unbalanced. Personally, he felt it was quite obvious what Potter wanted to do, what with the sharp, unmoving way he stared at Draco. Potter had always been firmly in the ‘punch Draco in the face, or something worse’ camp.
“Are you tired?” Potter asked, nudging away the teapot that someone had charmed to refill empty cups. It instead rammed repeatedly into Draco’s shoulder until he stole Potter’s mug from his hand and lifted it to be filled. Draco took an overlarge mouthful, not bothering with milk or sugar, and grimaced at the taste. But warmth spread through him, though it did nothing for the tired headache pulsing at his temple.
“Who are you even writing them to?” Malfoy asks, crowded close and looking put out that Harry managed to
Potter, evidently employing Legilimency, said in a clumsy voice, “I haven’t been checking the map since we—fought.” Draco’s sneer fell off in surprise. “I realized it might be a bit, uh, hypocritical of me to check it after I got so—angry, about being—about thinking you might have been following me—” Potter’s eyes dashed briefly towards Weasley and Granger, and with a mute sort of despair, Draco realized Potter must have talked about it with them, that Potter might have been talking about Draco
Draco made a small, embarrassing noise, heat crawling along his spine and into his face. Potter laughed, a helpless puff of a sound.
“Shh,” she said, though Draco hadn’t made a sound. His breathing was uneven, but Draco found that he had more to say: about the gobstones team, and his old friends, and his new ones. He spoke about the repairs to the castle, and the service hours with Madam Pomfrey, and even about the scene in the common room at the beginning of the year, though he could not quite bring himself to discuss the rest of it. And all the while his mother kept her arm close around him like she used to when he was a child, listening even as the wintry sunrise crept into the room with its slow, searching fingers, drenching them both in crisp light.
Harry pauses with his quill hovering over the bottom of the parchment. There are more questions Malfoy wants to ask Andromeda, ones he won’t put to paper for fear of being discovered. This sounds like one of them.
And then Draco’s voice died in his throat, because he was abruptly very close to Potter, the sound of the cloak snapping in the air louder than anything. Potter looked nearly as startled as Draco felt, green eyes wide and bright in the moonlight as the transfigured cloak settled across his shoulders. Draco could almost feel the movement of Potter’s swallow, intimate and uncertain, against his knuckles, frozen where Draco had the cloak’s clasp in either hand. A thin strip of light from the Entrance Hall split them half in light, shadows pronounced and growing where they cast them.
“I shouldn’t have,” he said, at the end, his voice rushing in that pathetic way it tended to when he was uneasy. “It was—I acted rashly.”
upset; he’s upset that nobody will take him seriously. He resents the quiet dismissal of his concerns. He hates how powerless he feels to do the one thing Malfoy’s asked of him.
Harry forces his tongue to unstick from the roof of his mouth, his own blood pressure rising in response to Malfoy’s distress. He says, “Malfoy, don’t—”
Draco was more than a little surprised to find Baddock stopping him the next morning, his face screwed up in something that was not-quite friendly. It was the same expression he’d been wearing any time he looked at Draco recently.
done, when Potter found Draco on his way out of the dungeons and pried the answer of what he was doing today out of him, was lament whatever fleeting, misguided emotion inspired this insipid desire to help ensure the continued survival of an ancient, decidedly uninteresting game. By the time he’d run out of words, they were already at the ground level hall, which once held such exciting things as a dueling club and now settled for teenagers lobbing stones at each other. Potter, looking cheered, had said,
, one Auror said as they poured through the unprotected gates, while Draco gasped at the catch of a hex at his side, burning, burning.
Draco pressed his face between palms, crushing his quill against his cheek. He inhaled carefully through his nose, exhaled with equal care, and still his heart was racing. He let his knee fall back against Potter’s and kept it there. Potter let him.
“It was Potter, wasn’t it?” Draco had figured it out some indeterminable time ago, but it didn’t feel right to bring up until now, face to face with the worry lines on his mother’s forehead. “That you lied about to the Dark Lord.”
crawling all over his spine. “I wasn’t the one in danger,” he snapped, thinking of the muggles, of Lovegood and Thomas, of the young girl bitten by werewolves, of Baddock himself, who was just
It was so desperately strange. Draco tried to imagine his mother cooking and couldn’t. There was a side table with the Black family crest carved into the dark wooden top next to what appeared to be a plywood bookcase. For some inexplicable reason, seeing Narcissa absently place a teacup on its edge made a lump from in Draco’s throat.
But Astoria was sitting primly atop a desk next to Zeller and Queensbury, who was in conversation with Lovegood, of all people. And next to Lovegood, who was sitting serenely on the floor, was Potter, who straightened up when Draco walked into the room. Granger, tucked between Potter and Weasley, gave Draco a hard nod.
This is the other option they claw out of what’s available to two boys nobody wants to believe are already soldiers: a war cannot be won without its soldiers, so get rid of the soldiers and the stronghold. A vanishing cabinet is an easy loophole through unknowing wards, once fixed; a pensieve can store the layout of a manor overrun with Death Eaters, and the location of every prisoner besides; the only thing they need are forces, and a Slytherin aunt with an auror daughter involved in the secretive Order of the Phoenix could solve that problem neatly.
“That has absolutely nothing to do with me,” Draco pointed out, and took a final bite of the sandwich he’d grabbed from the end of one of the tables in the Great Hall. Sunlight still suffused the lawns, the wind bitterer out in the open as they were, so Draco took a few steps to the side, avoiding the wand, and kept walking past Potter to the copse of trees that lined the lake.
“Oh,” said Potter, as if he’d just realized the same. Draco’s irritation flared higher; he pushed away from the table, feeling himself go pink as he shouldered his bag and snatched up his wand. He’d always been so stupid about Potter. A little attention and he just—just went and got so desperately ahead of himself, without even
At the front of the classroom, chalk squeaking underneath his words, Creevey said, “So we’re gonna see if Hogwarts will let us undo the wards.”
it when his hand passed through it. It felt like laughter; at the same time, it felt like crying. It felt like being crowded around the kitchen table at the Burrow; it felt like being locked inside the cupboard. It felt like hunger pangs on his birthday, but it also, inexplicably, felt like the weight of Malfoy’s arm around his waist.
Baddock gave a little twist of a smile. “I don’t know. It’s hard to tell what helps, sometimes. But I don’t think it hurts.”
“No,” Potter said, though he didn’t meet Draco’s eyes for the rest of the evening. That, too, was another strange thing: Potter never upped and left, as Draco might have expected him to, but instead idled in their shared space. Doubling back in corridors to greet him; scooting over, wordless, to carve a space on the stone ledge for Draco to join him; fingers trailing over book spines, while Draco studied at a table wedged under a window with a faulty lock, the library stacks on either side of them, cocooning them from the rest of the school.
Malfoy’s skin is cold, but his pulse hammers under Harry’s fingers. He looks resigned to having Harry’s hand there, at his neck; Harry thinks, with disquieting certainty, that he could hurt Malfoy. That Malfoy might not stop him.
The castle, too, had her scars, and Draco was tending to those wounds on the long, lonely evenings that he didn’t go to the library. The electives wing was reassembling itself slowly, stone by stone, now that the dark magic was no longer hindering its growth Each repair was in precisely in the right place, but wrong in inexplicable ways: the grey stone gave way to random spots of sand-blasted whites with colorful speckles and layered red-browns. Draco came back one night to find two classrooms reformed, and when he peeked inside, not expecting much—the castle could repair its walls and doorways, but not its furnishings—he found the shape was completely different. In one, stone risers sloped along a third of the room, as if for a choir, and a ceiling vaulted higher than was possible for a room on the ground floor. In the other, the middle of the room was depressed several steps down before leveling out into a wide semi-circle. It wasn’t until Draco had hopped to the bottom and looked up that he realized it was the same shape as the courtrooms in the Ministry, but for the windows set high in each wall, streaming sunlight downwards.
The new room she showed him to was brighter, though not much bigger, and an enchanted clock cheerily informed them it was half past noon. Draco had been here for roughly two and a half hours.
“Contest them!” Professor Applesnap reared back as if Baddock had drawn his wand. “A team comprised of criminals shouldn’t even be competing!”
And in fact, Potter’s proposition appeared not twenty minutes later, her red hair done in twin braids down each side of her head and dressed in her full quidditch kit.
He didn’t look up, but Draco had the sudden feeling that Officer Abbott-Jones was staring at him. Like how sometimes the mood in the Manor would shift so suddenly and completely at a single word, emotions so dense one could open their mouth and feel it sizzle along their tongue. It was like that, only instead of terror, Draco suspected he would taste deep, unmoving sadness in the air.
“I meant to give it back to you sooner,” Potter was saying, like he’d been preparing the words for a long while and was determined to get them out, nevermind whatever else Draco had to say. “During the trials, I wanted to, but then I—and then you were—and I had my trial, too—” Draco had already been in Azkaban at that point, but he’d heard about it, the bizarre combination of fear and celebration that pervaded what amounted to a formality recognizing that murder and Unforgiveables were acceptable if you were the victor. “—and after, I wasn’t really, I mean I couldn’t really—and then you weren’t anywhere, when we got back to school, so I’m only able to do it now.”
“Your hands are bloody freezing,” Malfoy complains, barely moving his mouth away enough to make the words audible.
Nightmares were a boring plague to suffer. The whole dorm took to casting silencing charms before bed, and the prefects pinned a handful of notices regarding improper use of sleeping draughts onto the notice board, underneath an encouragement to seek out Madam Pomfrey for issues, but none of that changed the fact that some evenings found most of the house up in the very early hours, unwilling to return to bed.
They sat in the Hufflepuff stands, because it was the closest. The wooden beams creaked tiredly as they walked up and up to the very top of the stands. The moon was still out, as were all her stars, and the castle seemed ethereal and unhurt across the hills. The Forbidden Forest was very close, and the sky was very far, and Potter kept hold of one of Draco’s hands, hard and unyielding, the whole way up, as if they were still caught in a fire, desperate to escape.
, then shut it. He walked to the floo room with his head down and threw the floo powder into the flames almost at the same time he walked into the fire.
“That’s not bad,” Potter said, sounding truly upset. The blurry, sleepless expression was being replaced with a fire that Draco had once made it his mission to inspire in Potter. “I always—”
The Battle was always frightfully easy to recall, and so this memory was summoned effortlessly as well. Vince and Greg on either side of him, following him because he’d said he could find Potter. He could always find Potter.
is not the one who will be facing all his nightmares in two weeks. “I don’t feel like I’ve helped you at all.”
It had been an accident, was the thing. Draco had finished with the first floor elective wing and sat at its crumbling edge, coaxing rubble out of the way, when he noticed the figure cutting across the rolling hills in the bright moonlight.
On the ground in front of him, he’d placed Draco’s hawthorn wand. Draco sank into a sprawl opposite Potter, the wand between them.
if it was actually going to be read. His father had never read the ones that came late in the day, even if they were technically still submitted within the right time frame.
How his father strode into the Manor as if the world had not been upended, and the remaining Snatchers and Death Eaters gravitated towards him like pixies to a flame. How his mother smoothly, sweetly cajoled them into staying and closed all the exits. How they moved the prisoners, who were surly and suspicious and flinched when Draco took them to be healed by his mother.
It was inevitable, really, that Malfoy would lean forward and press their lips together. Inevitable that Harry would kiss him back, his spine tingling with the feeling.
. The words were unfamiliar. Draco wrapped his arms around his knees as the fire finally gave way to embers.
The laughter slid off Potter's face. Draco's chest hitched, a faint echo of the panic he'd felt months ago, when he'd been with Greg and Vince, prowling the corridors with the Dark Lord's edicts in his ears. They'd seen Granger, Potter, and Weasley disappear around the seventh floor corridor, and been confronted with the empty stone wall that haunted Draco's dreams even after he'd fled with Snape. And Draco—Draco, who still retched after one of Nagini's feedings; Draco, whose Crucios were still weak; Draco, who carried extra water to the prisoners; Draco, who could have killed but didn't, would never be able to—thought only, desperately, that he only needed to be sure that Potter wasn't dead.
“Nothing,” Potter mumbled, then, “I still have your stupid robes,” and Draco made another equally embarrassing sound. Everything was warmth; even the curl of Potter’s voice added another layer of it, tenderly sweeping aside Draco’s worries to find more space to fill with buoyancy. It bubbled in Draco’s blood, making his mouth stretch into a smile Potter couldn’t properly kiss. It was, he thought, happiness. Stunned and growing, growing, growing.
When Flitwick looked away, Potter’s hand slid over the tight curl of Draco’s finger, forcing them, patiently, to unclench; and Draco let it happen, let his fingers be pried apart until Potter’s hand was flat against his own, the crumpled parchment caught between their sweaty palms.
Officer Abbott-Jones’ smile slid off her face. “Okay, okay,” she said, in a placating manner that was only half-joking. She opened the door and cocked her hip to one side. “You took longer to admit you hated me than most parolees.”
“Then,” Draco began, without knowing where the statement was headed. Panic pulsed in his throat, across the top of his skin. “Then—”
Of course, without the Room being accessible, the only other way Draco knew to communicate with the castle was by accessing her magic at points of needed repair. He stalked the castle and grounds for over an hour after Creevey and Granger broke away for lunch. At this point, Draco didn’t even need Potter’s map to locate where the rubble and frayed magic was. But Draco had spent most of the year fixing all of those places, and as he walked by each point, he knew with a sinking gut where they ought to go to speak with the castle. The last place that needed extensive repairs were the towers at the western end of the castle.
“You don’t have to,” Baddock said, voice wavering. “I mean you must have also…even if you were—were—”
He’d been running and re-running his recent conversations with Potter in his head and had exclaimed a rather heartfelt
“Because you already have that covered, of course,” Draco answered, trying for a dry tone that would cover his surprise. Hogsmeade station was crowded with students waiting for the Hogwarts Express, a bustle of bodies that pushed Draco and Potter to one side of the platform, half-hidden by a stone pillar. Not an arm’s length away, Granger and Weasley were doing a poor job of surreptitiously observing them.
“There’s Hogwarts, obviously. But there are so many others. Beamish has a whole magical town attached to the museum, but the area is so heavily warded that Dad got sick when we got close. The National Portrait Gallery has an additional floor for famous magical figures, but the veil is so thick that Dad couldn’t even walk through it. And none of these places can lift their wards piecemeal. Supposedly,” Creevey said with dark humor. He was looking at Draco now, and it struck him then that Creevey was
He placed them on the seat next to Potter, then took a step back, his arms suddenly overly large and awkward at his side. He pulled them tight against his chest, as if it would settle his stomach, his heart; convince them to stay where they were meant to, and not jump from his insides as they wished to.
The window for moving away felt as if it had already passed; and now Draco was frozen in the shape of a fight with Potter, but there were none of the edges that went with a fight. Potter had been laughing.
Draco’s magic whirled through him as if a blockage was released, the hair-raising tingle of it rushing across his skin. He thought
“They hexed you?” Queensbury demanded. He’d come to breakfast about halfway through Draco’s retelling, his halo of curls coiffed meticulously.
“Malfoy,” Potter said. It felt like it had been a very long time since Draco had heard his name, and longer still since he heard it in Potter’s voice. It strummed a forgotten chord in Draco’s chest, vibrating along his bones.
“You’re not,” Potter said dismissively, attempting to balance the stack of books under his arms as if he wasn’t perfectly capable of charming them to float obediently next to him. Perhaps he wasn’t, now that Draco thought about it.
Two nights became three became six, and before he knew it, Harry had snuck out of the castle with Malfoy nearly the entire week. Mostly, they didn't say anything as they wandered the school and its dark grounds, except to whisper a few heated barbs at each other.
The last sunrays are slipping slowly and surely away, leaving them in incremental shadows when Harry says, “None that anyone else is gonna see.”
Potter was in the Owlery when Draco made his way up, sitting on one of the window ledges with his back against the arcing stone. He looked over at Draco’s entry, the closed off look on his face lightening with such speed that Draco stumbled, caught off guard.
Yet Draco was certain he could feel the track of Potter’s eyes when he headed out of the library; and a glance upwards and to the side would find Potter there, at a nearby table with Granger and Weasley’s bowed heads across from him. When he left the Hospital Wing, his hours of service for Madam Pomfrey finished for the day, Potter would be passing by, the dawdling point of the triangle of
“What?” Draco asked. On Potter’s other side, Granger and Weasley were bent together, having a whispered argument and determinedly not looking in Draco’s direction.
It was not about how he felt about Potter, in particular, though perhaps it had always been about how he felt about Potter. It was about the fact that he'd seen Potter at eleven, eyes covered by the sorting hat; and he'd seen Potter at seventeen, a stinging hex to the face. He’d seen Potter flying against him on the quidditch pitch, and he’d seen Potter making faces at him from across the Great Hall, but perhaps most pressingly, he’d seen the way the Dark Lord spoke of Potter, of the honest, vitriolic hatred that made Draco’s own animosity seem so laughably, painfully childish.
The swivel of two dozen heads in his direction, however, Draco did notice. The heavy, echoing quiet of an argument interrupted hung in the air.
Sometimes, Harry thinks it comes down to this: Draco Malfoy, before he was anything else, was the first person Harry ever wanted to impress. He’d spent years accustomed to being ignored by adults and other children alike, and by the time he was eleven, he’d learned to shy away from attention. Nothing good ever came from it, so Harry had contented himself with lunches behind dumpsters and entertained himself with sprawling stories in his head and then—
“Hm?” she answered, looking over his shoulder and waving at someone. “Oh, Queensbury is here. Budge over, Malfoy, would you—good morning, Queensbury, would you mind telling Malfoy about the thing we don’t talk about?”
Draco stared at him, thrown by the question. Like his mind playing out the continuation of last night, the answer puttered out of existence before Draco could determine it. “I don’t know.”
He said it in a way that suggested he did know, but before Harry could interrogate him about it, Malfoy said the password and stepped into the common room. Harry, miffed, followed after him.
Haltingly, Draco tried to describe the stand-off in the common room, and how he thought it might—do something, to share the reality of what transpired, and not the spin that the most conservative members of the public have already taken to heart, that so many were already parroting.
“You didn’t lose nearly as many points as Malfoy,” Potter told her consolingly, before Zeller could. “I mean, just look at his hair.”
“Potter,” Draco said, absently; he was missing a chunk of runes to balance out his circle but his gaze kept going unfocused when he tried to run through the possibilities. Sunlight inched across the table and Potter took another step forward.
Like with the elective wing, the castle made changes that seemed incorrect. But now, with the gathered students whispering and wishing, Draco wondered if perhaps, since the very beginning, the castle had been listening and answering with them realizing it. A choir room. A debate room.
Draco found himself crouched on the ground, his head hanging between his knees and his hands splayed protective along the back of his neck. It took him several, uneven breaths to realize the Headmistress was kneeling in front of him, that she was speaking to him, and several longer minutes before he could breathe properly.
“Not this again, Harry!” Her voice is despairing, stealing the rest of Harry’s words from his mouth. Except he has proof, this time. He
She said this with the same pride that once swelled in Draco’s chest, tinged with a nostalgic fondness. Draco felt a rush of gratitude towards her, dispelling the apprehensive ache in his shoulders.
see the ones on the insides of his thighs, dark and tender distractions from the burn of Malfoy’s fingers working him open. Harry’s fingers itch to press down on them.
“Fuck,” said Draco, very quietly. His throat bobbed as he drew to a stop; Astoria came to a stop as well, and gave him a faintly scandalized look at his language.
Draco, feeling unaccountably guilty, gathered his things for lack of anything else to do. When Potter continued to not say anything, to sit in perfect and unwavering stillness, Draco said, “You could still go. A glamour would work.”
Harry’s hands curl into fists above his head, where Malfoy’s thin hands are a vice around his wrists. Malfoy sounds like a trapped animal. He repeats it, eyes burning a defiant, inescapable silver. “
he upset? Harry doesn’t know. He never knows when he’s upset unless something has already broken because of it. His heart is going
Harry, personally, hadn't read it since the summer before he started at Hogwarts, and even then had skipped all the boring bits about the school.
“I’m,” Draco started, but could not fathom an end to the sentence. He tried, “He’s,” but that, too, was mired with more than he knew how to explain. He wanted to explain about the cloak pin, and his letter, and his cloying certainty that he was going to fuck this up, too, the way he had everything else in his life.
Malfoy sat up, too, his eyes wide and mouth parted open in surprise. “Old magic,” he said, wonder in his voice.
Astoria tolerated this for about thirty seconds before she put a hand on his arm and said, rather forcefully, “We’re going to be late.”
, he began, but there was nothing to follow that up with. Without classes, without quidditch, without classmates, there was only Draco. What about himself was he meant to bring up?
She began walking again, backwards so that she was keeping their gazes locked. “But it’s rather nice, now, even though I feel quite stupid whenever people begin speaking about things in the muggle world. Do you know why it’s nice?”
Narcissa apparated them to the Manor, directly into the deceptively bright courtyard. Faintly, through the gaping doorway, came pops of apparition and crashing glass, swearing and, horribly, screaming.
He lifts his face and twists so he can look at Malfoy, who’s staring at him with his hair still a mess. “What about you?” Harry asks, carefully.
. Draco wanted to press his hands to his ears until it went away. He wanted to be a child again, a proper one, and then realized he never wanted to be the child he had once been ever again; he was longing for a past that never existed, for a blamelessness that would never be attributed to him, only he’d forgotten that. Momentarily he’d forgotten, but of course, such things were infectious; he’d ruined his teammates for his thoughtlessness.
With a final, pointed look at the Gryffindor prefects, Professor McGonagall exited. The chilliness of the room plunged straight into ice, broken only when the Slytherin prefect cleared her throat and said, “We’ll need to be directed to the dorms.”
“I understand,” he said, mouth dry. He needed to be out of this claustrophobic office, under the Headmistress’ claustrophobic gaze. He needed to be high up. He needed to see the sky. “I’ll attend classes.”
Draco didn’t bother responding; his hands were becoming increasingly sweaty the closer to the classroom they got. The thing was that Astoria was right; he could have gone. The same thing that stopped him from doing so at the beginning of the year was the same thing that made him pause three doors down from the specified classroom.
Harry didn't want that. He wasn't sure what he wanted, except for Malfoy to take the bloody jumper and sneak out of the castle with him again.
So it was unoriginal, as far as defenses went, but: in Draco’s defense, the war left him hyper attuned to the most obvious sorts of danger, and Potter had always been a glaring shower of red sparks in Draco’s sightline. How was he meant to reconcile how Potter sometimes leaned against Draco’s back while he scanned the library shelves, a heavy, grounding weight, with the time he’d crushed Potter’s nose underfoot, furious and fearful and jealous? How their ankles knocked together, their knees too close, legs tangled under the library table, against the way Draco had once levelled a wand and tried to cast the Cruciatus at him?
That faint smile grew wider. The whistle blew, shrill and demanding, a white puff of smoke billowing in the air. The collected students moved towards the doors at once, eager to get out of the chill. The jostle of the crowd knocked Draco forward another step, into Potter, who was as warm as he’d ever been and was close enough that he didn’t have to shout to say, “Happy Christmas, Malfoy.”
Harry swallowed, thinking they were veering quite quickly into Not Worth Speaking About territory. "Just wondering if you'd look so smug if you knew that sweater was made by Mrs. Weasley."
Draco laughed. It was a good laugh, unfettered. Astoria’s expression shifted into a small, conspiring smile, before she turned her attention back to her book while Khan, who rumor said had been responsible for warding the Slytherin common room against intruders during the Battle of Hogwarts, demanded that Draco explain what he meant. Several other students looked equally invested in the story, though perhaps less out of the academic interest of Khan.
Professor Sprout’s voice was overly cheerful, booming in from very close to Draco’s right side. “Professor Applesnap, what
“Mad, isn’t it?” Draco snorted. They’d all broken from the meeting a short while ago, to ostensibly gain cover before all sneaking out to meet in the ruined corridor. Draco reviewed the calculations Granger had written during the meeting, and was frowning over them. “There isn’t enough time to do the repairs in one night.”
?” Hermione asks, her eyes blazing when they meet Harry’s. She is not just asking about Malfoy’s change of heart, if she’s even convinced he’s had one. Hermione always wants more of an answer than Harry knows how to give.
Hermione frowned in thought, clearly trying to remember some passage in a book. "That magic only shows itself when two or more people share the same intense wish. It has to be
Baddock wasn’t meant to look like that. Not when playing gobstones, which he loved. The war was not supposed to take this away as well.
Draco had a hundred horrors crowding his brain, and each morning began with a new one, a memory uncovered only in the stark light of the dormitory’s bathroom in the early morning. And with it, a new affirmation of the truth of his character, held in hands that trembled under the cold spray of water that always, for a second, seemed the color of rust.
Harry gasps, as much from the shock of pain as from the rush of arousal, his grip going weak against Malfoy’s collar.
But it turned out the Headmistress hadn’t brought it up to castigate him for allowing his classmates to be imprisoned and tortured in his home. Instead, she neatly refilled his teacup and asked, “Would you like to discuss your experience, Mr. Malfoy?”
“Ignoring his summons would ensure a death sentence for my mother,” Malfoy says, voice icy, icy calm. The red in his face betrays his mounting anger.
?” Malfoy spits the words out, voice thin, his face alight with something that looks far too breakable to be fury. It’s not fury, but his hands seem to think it is. They’ve curled into tight fists.
Potter reached out without looking, startling when his fingers knocked into the stack of books and sent them wobbling. He stared at them, face slack with surprise. His fingers curled into his palm, very slowly. His throat bobbed and Draco watched its movement with rapt fascination.
“You’re not really thinking straight,” Malfoy chides, but there’s no heat behind it. “I’m not useful if I’m dead, and it would be more suspicious if I don’t show up. Even
They even skimmed the edges of the Forbidden Forest, which led to Malfoy walking off in a huff and Harry trying very hard not to laugh at him.
“There was one in Gryffindor, too,” Potter said. He leant against the edge of Draco’s desk in an empty classroom on the second floor, which Potter had “accidentally” wandered into. Draco was beginning to revisit the theory he’d had in sixth year, about Potter having a tracking spell on him. He’d have to douse his belongings in a reveal-all potion this evening. “Did you sign?”
Draco nodded; he’d been doing a lot of that. Of course, the last time he was struggling with a problem, he’d not been able to trust his Head of House—or he’d had no reason to believe he could. The information, learned in the aftermath, that Professor Snape had been a spy for Dumbledore still rang hollowly between Draco’s ribs.
Her voice was so polite it was somehow insulting. Percy puffed up his chest, and a short moment later, the Slytherins were being led up the spiral staircase while Percy lectured at the head of the line.
Malfoy's eyes were very bright in the moonlight filtering through the window. He took the jumper, his fingers brushing against Harry's briefly. It felt like a burn, running up Harry's arm and into his face. It was an answer, but Harry was still figuring out the question. He just knew it was important, from the way Malfoy was looking at him.
“But we can still help,” Zeller said plaintively, her yellow barrettes sparkling from the Lumos bubble floating overhead. “It’s our school, too.”
November continued its hazy progression. There were classes Draco didn’t attend, and meals he took directly from the Great Hall to the Slytherin common room, and the hot prickle of Potter’s gaze, the nudge of his elbow, the touch of his shoulder. Sometimes, devastatingly, Draco would remember the line of Potter’s side against his chest and the sound of his laughter echoing within his ribcage. The hitch of Potter’s breath, like Halloween night, but more fatal. The memory would make Draco’s thoughts stall, cotton-headed, until he was shaken back into himself, or until someone else did the shaking for him.
Malfoy does not do that. Malfoy is lit wick reflected back at him, a tangled, unyielding mess that Harry can’t look directly at, nevermind for long enough to puzzle out where it's headed. It’s something wild and greedy, and it punches through the ice with nary a concern for the cracks in its wake.
Ron throws a companionable arm around Harry’s shoulder and drags him inside the compartment, where the rest of their friends are already lounging. Harry waits for the discomfort to come, but it’s distant and ignorable for the moment. His shoulders stay relaxed under Ron’s lanky arm.
He felt like a localised Tarantallegra was dancing across the top of his skin the whole walk back to the common room. He stood outside the familiar stretch of wall for several long minutes, mind curiously blank for the first time in his entire life.
telling me?” Greg’s grumble of irritation was reminiscent of sixth year, and Draco found himself growing irate despite himself.
. And his parole officer—Officer Abbott-Jones, her fringe overlong and a ponytail flipped over one shoulder—had just looked at him for a long, hard moment.
Draco took a moment to digest this, shook his head, and said, “I shudder to think what a Hufflepuff invasion looks like.”
, because Potter didn’t have enough space in his. Who bought a schoolbag without an expansion charm woven into it?
Harry takes a few seconds to breathe, feeling the buzz of his magic rattle the desks in their co-opted classroom. Malfoy interspersed a highly unimpressed lecture on Harry's lack of control over his magic in-between insults and non-answers, and Harry’s pretty sure one of them will end up with another broken nose if
This early, the common room was mostly deserted, the water from the lake dappling soft, wavering shadows along the tabletops and window seats. Baddock was sitting at the table that held Khan’s pensieve the night before, which she’d taken up to her room sometime before Draco dragged himself back to the castle last night. His memory was still in there, but retrieving it felt distant and unimportant. It was almost a relief to no longer have it in his head.
“Hogwarts,” Draco said, barely noticing the derision in Creevey’s voice. The noise in his head was subsiding, but he didn’t feel any closer to understanding. He wondered if he ever would. He only had this single thought, this sole offering: “You haven’t asked Hogwarts if she would do it for you.”
Baddock had been on the run for the past year with his muggle family members. Draco didn’t know why the thought came to him. He’d known this. Baddock had been on the run for the past year with his muggle family members. Baddock had been on the run for the past year because of his muggle family members. Baddock had been on the run for the past year because he was from a muggle family. Baddock had been on the run for the past year because he was in danger because he came from a non-magical family. Baddock was in danger for the past year because he came from a non-magical family. Baddock’s family was in danger for the past year because they were non-magical, but Baddock
Behind her, looking very much like they’d rather be anywhere else, were Queensbury and the Gryffindor prefect. Draco felt a stab of sympathy towards them, as they both looked deeply apologetic.
Here is a list that Harry doesn’t like to think about: getting drunk at a pub. A birthday after the war. Finishing school. Buying a house, the kind that has enough guest rooms for all of his friends to stay if they needed to. Learning to drive a car. Learning to drive a motorbike. Getting out of Britain. Gardening, for fun. Cooking, for fun. Seeing his parent’s grave. Having a family. Figuring out what to do with his hands and their wants.
, murdered in cold blood like the prisoners in the Manor, and the family in the fields, and Professor Burbage, who Draco still heard in his nightmares. Baddock might have ended up in the cellars with Lovegood and Thomas, and Draco would have watched and done nothing.
Draco looked to Baddock, who would be no help, as he was falling asleep into his tea. So Draco faced Zeller and said, “Sorry?”
This resulted in a rather heated exchange. Not about Draco being a Death Eater, because that was common knowledge and not something up to debate, but about the relative righteousness of an auror hexing him at all. Voices were crescendoing around Draco, who found himself both bewildered and intrigued.
Harry tuned out the rest of the conversation in favor of staring morosely at his bed, finding fault with it the longer he stared at it. It hardly seemed bigger than his cot under the staircase, now that he was
Astoria was quiet for a long while as they took the staircase up to the ground floor. Finally, voice very low, she said, “You know that’s not why.”
Unfortunately, by the time dinner came to a close, it was made readily apparent that the Slytherin dormitory had not miraculously repaired itself days before schedule. It was with Professor McGonagall's stern gaze at their backs that the Gryffindors returned to the common room with the Slytherins at their heels.
Granger did not even look up until Draco pointedly cleared his throat and said, testy, “You were at the open governor’s meeting.”
Their gazes slid over to Draco, very quickly, like they’d had the same thought; Draco kept his own gaze on the platter of bacon, which he was no longer hungry for. He took a piece of toast from the stack. He thought about open air. He said, “Perhaps I should leave.”
Potter’s curls were everywhere, as usual, and his robes were rumpled, as usual, and Draco was ninety percent certain he’d be allowed to pull Potter towards him and kiss him again if the single, heated look they’d shared before the Headmistress had forced them all back to their respective common room was any indication. Eighty-five percent sure. His hands were so bloody
If there are hands at the back of his neck, it’s because Harry’s getting thrown in the cupboard. If someone’s arms are around him, it’s so they can hold him down while another person punches. If there is a crowd, it’s to point a finger at him for imagined infractions. It doesn’t matter how long it’s been since Harry first learned these lessons; those touches are expected things.
It had not gotten better with time, or distance. It seemed like it should have. It seemed like Draco should have been able to return from break having rationalized his way out of this feeling, finally triumphing over his incapability to regard Potter with any normal amount of emotion.
And then the Slytherin third and fourth years had filed silently in through the portrait hole, escorted by a fifth-year prefect who had the grim look of a general at war on her face. Harry stared hard at the group of third-years, finding it unnerving to see them in the cozy red and gold of the common room. The common room, already small given the constraints of the tower, was crowded by their entry.
A hush fell at his entry nevertheless. The abrupt quiet made Draco’s skin prickle as he stalked to a table at the back, whispers starting up in his wake. He focused entirely on getting out his materials, chest drowned with something like misery and something like anger. He flicked his eyes upwards, to see what Professor Flitwick had on the board, and was caught immediately by the sight of his housemates, sitting in two neat rows, clumped by year.
Draco’s erratic breathing was the only anchor to his body, his instinctive recoil to the question distant, distant. “No,” he said, then, “Yes.” But his brain was blinking out into a plane of pure white.
—until finally, fed up, Draco announced that he was leaving, that they could all figure it out without him, and that obviously they should get to the Hospital Wing, was that not obvious?
Harry catches himself first, then spins and hurries out of the room; hurries until his feet trip over each other, until he’s running down, down, down the staircases and through the corridors, dodging clanging armor and startled ghosts and ignoring the shouts of the portraits he passes.
Christmas break came with flurries of snow that turned to grey sludge underfoot and Potter saying, “Don’t make it weird.”
“But why don’t you want it back?” Potter sounded genuinely aggravated by this. “Is it the Elder wand thing?”
But she wasn’t so far when Draco finally looked up, his mouth twisted with unhappiness. Astoria caught his gaze and held it. “
“I’m not,” Malfoy says. He pauses, every part of him stilling; says, with frustration, “I’m not upset.”
That terrible grief was rising fast in his chest, in his throat, as he looked at Greg, whose face was twisting into something terrible. The nightmare made it more difficult for Draco to remember how to draw back and tuck away the simultaneous flares of hurt and anger than accompanied the sight of Greg.
be saved. How funny, that Headmaster Dumbledore sent the man Draco knew as a Death Eater, who had stood emotionless while Draco was branded the summer before, as his envoy of safety. How funny, that the Headmaster would not speak to Draco himself because he thought the Dark Lord would break into Draco’s mind while he was absconded in the confines of Hogwarts stone walls.
He hadn’t let up until Draco grunted an assurance, unable to look Theo in the eye as the words tumbled over and over in his head, damning and shameful.
“I don’t think they wanted to know me,” Potter said after a moment, but Draco could feel the weight of his hard gaze prickling at the top of Draco’s bowed head.
Heart pounding, Draco stepped towards it, trepidation crawling up and down his spine. But of course nothing happened when he reached it. The memorial remained as it was, a curved sculpture aiming upwards, set into a stone slab which held the date of the battle and the words
Draco traced a finger along the lines of the castle walls, hovering at the Astronomy Tower, then dropping to press against the hilly grounds he ran across with Professor Snape on the worst day of his life; he swiped the pads of his fingers against the western wing, still under construction, and the lower towers with their broken lines, both casualties from the Battle at Hogwarts.
killed him—lulled him into closing his eyes. Next thing he knew, Harry woke with his back pressed comfortably against Malfoy's front, an arm slung across his waist. Harry stared at the offending appendage for several long seconds, feeling Malfoy's soft breath across the back of his neck, and decided that actually this might be worse than Voldemort.
But Potter smiled. It was a small smile. He said, “Alright, Malfoy,” and nodded, and left. He rejoined Granger and Weasley, who were giving him truly bewildered looks as he fell into the space they instinctively left for him.
This, too, Draco had to add to his list of affirmations—cruel, which he’d always been and would always be, and unkind, for this intrinsic need to come up with cruelties to attribute to others—but by the evening he’d forgotten almost all of them, exhaustion from his rare snatches of sleep leaving his head too heavy to hold a single thought and Potter at his side, saying something inane like, “I need to check these out.”
“Go back to sleep,” she bid quietly, a cool hand pushing Draco’s hair away from his face. It was longer than he’d ever allowed it to be, longer than he’d ever been allowed to keep it, but Narcissa had not asked him to cut it.
This is what Harry knows about Andromeda Tonks: she was Sirius’ favorite cousin, the middle of the Black sisters; she was burned off the family tapestry for marrying a muggleborn; she has a daughter named Nymphadora Tonks.
She’d naturally already won her five rounds, with ruthless efficiency. Draco, on the other hand, had used a scouring charm on his face so many times he was certain his skin was permanently red and raw. It was pure luck that he managed to win even the one round.
This, talking about something that felt important and impactful without much care for the attention he was or was not getting from the neighboring tables, was better. It was better even though it was painful, and sad, and there was much less laughter.
“I’m upset, too,” Harry continues, the statement a revelation on his tongue. He bites on the inside of his lip, to stop his face from crumpling.
Malfoy’s mouth, the familiar shape and feel of it; he knows it colliding against his in the spare minutes between classes or warm against his collarbones or soft at the small of his back, and it still somehow feels like he’s going to learn something new, this time, when Malfoy’s mouth opens under his.
Potter’s mouth tightened. “There are spells to keep students from crossing into the areas affected by the spell damage.”
“Think he’s always gonna be a git,” Harry says honestly, under his breath so only Ron can hear him, while Hermione tuts from her seat near the window. Across from her, Neville is asking Luna bemusedly about the headline of the Quibbler’s Holiday and Arcane Rituals Edition. Ginny flounces out just as quickly as she went in, going in search of Dean in a rush of loose red hair while her bag, abandoned next to Luna, marks her seat should she deign to return.
The first problem, part two: some people you will kiss, and it won’t change you. When Harry kissed Cho, all he’d felt afterwards was discomfort, the kiss eventually fading and forgotten in the back of his brain. Even now, he averts his eyes when he sees her.
Malfoy’s breathing has gone funny, the anxiety travelling into his lungs and out of his hands, which are trembling slightly as Malfoy’s chest hitches unevenly.
“In the mornings,” Draco started, voice all wrong. He tried to clear his throat, but it didn’t help. “In the mornings I have to, to remind myself of the—things I did at Manor, and during the Battle—”
Harry watches the way Malfoy wrinkles his reddened nose at the wind, the way his hair sweeps against his brow, and has to forcibly pull his gaze away to focus on the letter before Malfoy notices his staring.
The words were said with relish. Draco wondered how long she’d been waiting on those words, if perhaps she’s said them before. After his sentencing, letters and howlers had flooded the Manor. Draco imagined Professor Applesnap as one of those furious letter-writers, pinning their fear and pain on Draco because he was culpable and recognizable, because he’d gotten away, because no one would stop them.
But Astoria simply tapped the parchment with her wand, a wordless spell furling it into a tight scroll, and then gave Draco an expectant look.
His irises blown are wide and there are teeth marks trailing the length of his flushed neck, sweat glistening along all his bare skin; he says that, in an unsteady mocking lilt, and he’s the prettiest thing Harry’s ever seen and Harry wants to leave another mark on him to see if that will help.
It sounded stupid when he said it aloud though, and he could feel several pairs of dubious eyes upon him.
Potter gave up and let half the books spill on top of the table. “I’m trying to figure out what I like.”
The second is the boy, sixteen and boneless in Harry’s lap, humming his pleasure into Harry’s neck and urging Harry towards his own. This is the Malfoy he maps out with his mouth, the one who has found a hundred ways to make Harry fall apart and invented a hundred more to put him back together. This is the Malfoy that infatuates him.
Gut sinking, Draco flicked his gaze over to find a veritable wall of crimson and gold filling the seats. Even with the seventh year Slytherins and Draco in attendance, there were at least double the number of Gryffindors in the class, and every single one of them was staring at him.
She doesn’t slam the door, but the click is very, very final sounding. Harry flops back, then turns and buries his face in the pillow, debating on screaming into it.
Potter snarled, and turned his head sharply away from Draco, towards the window, where the pitch and the forest were lit by the glaring sun. “Give that back.”
"And let Black kill you without an audience?" Malfoy shot back. They argued in whispers the whole walk, only quieting when the portraits they passed started questioning aloud what the noise was.
it about Malfoy? He’s a collision course and a synchronous orbit; everything Harry has ever hated and the only thing Harry has ever wanted. He’s the third constant in Harry’s life—death and hunger and Malfoy; Ron and Hermione and Malfoy—and the only one of them Harry doesn’t understand. If fate is real, it’s cruel, because even if they found themselves at opposite sides of this war, Harry Potter would still be defining his life with Draco Malfoy as an axis.
Then the implications and its horror rushes in, eclipsing this thought entirely. Harry abruptly abhors the fact that he can’t see Malfoy’s face. He leans forward to tug at Malfoy’s shoulders until they’re face to face. Malfoy slaps Harry’s hands down, but doesn’t look away. The little color in him has abandoned him completely. He doesn’t look like a living boy anymore.
He spent the evening convinced he was going to finally be expelled, which was less of a gratitude than it had been only a month ago; and spent the morning delivering his coursework by the armload, dropping off the potions he brewed to a surprised Professor Slughorn and sitting in Professor Flitwick’s office, tense and uncomfortable, to perform the charms on the syllabus since Charms, like potions, had practical demonstration built into its grade calculation.
Draco knew why he hadn’t mentioned the war or the years before: because none of this would continue if he did. It would remind Potter that before the war, Draco was one of the worst things to happen to him. It was selfish; Draco rolled the word on his tongue, as a reminder.
Instead, the words brought a ball of something thick and confused to the base of Draco’s throat. It was about Potter, a little, for the memory of a broom ride in a burning room; about Vince, too, who Draco missed with a fierceness that seemed impossible; but mostly it was about his mother, who loved him so uniformly above all else.
"Maybe we should all ask at the same time," Lovegood said, wandering over. Done with her part of the repairs, she looped her hair into a large bun and stuck her wand through it as she spoke. "On the count of three?"
Conversation with Potter sometimes felt as if it occupied a thin beam that Draco was constantly at risk of toppling from. There were too many things that could undo the careful balance Draco struck, and he was hyper aware when that beam seemed to sway.
They stole an empty section of the blanket not occupied by food or students laid out to nap, watching as Ginny, Creevey, and two other students—Hufflepuffs, from their yellow scarves—took to the skies.
Potter asked again, “Did you?” He, too, looked as if he suffered a night of broken sleep, the delicate skin under his eyes dark and lined. Draco wondered what Potter did instead. Wondered if he stared out at the forest from the high spire of Gryffindor tower.
Potter was quiet and watchful as the silence grew heavier, but Draco knew enough, now, to recognize when a scared thing was getting ready to bite.
, then left Draco to return to Hogwarts with a promise that she would be back in a few weeks. Draco wasn’t sure what to call the expression on her curved, gentle face, and thinking about it only resulted in the worst possibilities: disgust, scorn; pity, which was the result that had Draco climbing the steps to the Owlery in the first place, heart beating almost angrily between his ears.
It is familiar, though, this cold clear thing that sometimes settles in Harry’s chest and refuses to thaw. Having Hermione on one side and Ron on the other will lessen its grip; Quidditch practice will do it, too. Gentle warmths, easing away some of the chill.
“You’re gonna tell me anyway,” Harry says. He sits up and scoots forward a little, until there’s only a palmful of space between them. “Don’t bother pretending you won’t.”
“And do begin attending your classes,” she added, as Draco reached the door. “Whatever else is going on, this is still a school.”
For a long moment, Draco scowled down at the floor and wondered if there was a point in going to see the damage. It was unlikely that it had changed from the first time Draco had seen it; and anyways, there was a niggling little concern in his chest about visiting the towers on his own. It was a stupid concern, but it was there. After a moment’s indecision, Draco spun on his heel and headed down the staircase, towards the ground floor.
"Erm," Harry said. As there was no good answer to this, his brain decided to shut itself off entirely. This was the only explanation for the next words out of his mouth being, "It's rather small, don't you think?"
“I suppose they wouldn’t have insisted on matching father-son tattoos, then,” Draco said finally, forcing himself to meet Potter’s gaze. “Really, you got lucky.”
It gnawed at Harry’s chest, a memory of something he’d never had but could almost reach. His inhale was shaky when he pulled his hand away and reached, instinctively, for Malfoy.
Draco woke retching. He pressed his hands to his eyelids until the nausea passed, overly aware of the panic-drenched state of his sheets and the burn in his throat. His hand shook terribly when he vanished the mess, and the bathroom light was too bright when he stepped inside to rinse his mouth. Giving up sleep entirely, he wandered into the common room, pulling on a dressing gown to ward off the chills shuddering through him.
Draco took two stumbling steps forwards, angry at the fact that Potter was angry, ashamed by his own anger, and confused by the force of Potter’s anger. His voice was a muddle, petulant and defensive, when he said, “I was
“Will you be committing an atrocity?” Draco asked, into the pillow of his arms. His eyelids drooped without his permission.
Draco, however, had spent much of the past two years face to face with injuries, worse ones: prisoners with blackened mouths, eyes empty; the cracked pleading as Nagini coiled around an immobilized body; the remains of a family Greyback’s pack herded into the lonely Manor fields and mutilated, the youngest dying a month later, unable to survive her first turn under the moonlight.
Draco nodded; it wasn’t like he would be able to go to any of the bigger tournaments with his parole requirements. “Fine,” he said, curt. He didn’t think he even had a gobstones set anymore.
Headmistress McGonagall’s face was troubled. “Mr. Malfoy,” she began, in a kinder tone than Draco had ever heard her use.
he expected to hear; more diatribes in the vein of the Malfoy who taunted him on the train at the end of last year, maybe. Or that puffed up bragging from when the compartment was filled with Slytherins, before Harry was uncovered and the accusations of stalking started up. Certainly more of that snarling he did right at the beginning, when Harry first caught sight of the Mark.
“Potter and I are friends now.” It was not blurted, though Draco felt like it was the only way to describe how the sentence came out, fast and urgent, a coil only to be sprung right at this moment.
He uncurled from his position on the armchair a few moments later, with a vague thought about a letter, or a script to follow when he inevitably encountered Potter; but the thought made his head pound relentlessly. Possibly it was stress. Possibly it was because it was half past two in the morning. Possibly Draco was dehydrated.
Malfoy makes a small noise, like a frightened animal, because Bellatrix Lestrange is walking up the Hogsmeade street, easy as you please.
Draco dropped his gaze, considered the quill in his fidgeting fingers. He held it tightly as he said, “They shouldn’t, by the way.”
“I don’t,” Draco said, unsure why that shameful heat built behind his eyes and at the swell of his cheeks. “I don’t—
Their list of things Not Worth Speaking About seemed to grow longer every night, and Harry, unnerved by the sudden numbers of secrets he held, worried at the thought of this.
Draco’s breath shuddered out of him. “Fine,” he said, though his voice shook. Professor Sprout was showing Professor Applesnap to the door, their voices beginning to rise in an argument Draco didn’t want to hear, didn’t want to be the cause of. What she was saying was so close to what he told himself in the mornings, but it was different hearing it from someone else and not from the dark misery in his head. It was only that he’d forgotten about it during the tournament, listening to Baddock’s preparations and Shardlow’s nerves about her skills, hearing Potter’s laughter in his ears.
Harry doesn’t feel freezing; his whole body is alight as Malfoy’s cold hands disappear under Harry’s borrowed cloak to ruck up Harry’s shirt and tease the skin above his trousers before slipping deftly lower. Harry rocks his hips forward, groaning low in his throat at the lazy way Malfoy touches him through his pants.
The room grew quiet; just the low crackle of the fire, and the ever-present press of water outside the windows, dark and green. Draco sat in the closest armchair, pulling his knees to his chest, and thought again of Potter, saying
Astoria waved a hand in vague annoyance. “No one else seemed to understand that the governors wouldn’t actually read through this much parchment. It took Queensbury and me most of the meeting to explain that a summary was necessary if we wanted a chance that even
Draco hands twitched. He shut the heavy oak doors with a bang that probably sounded through the castle, rattling the stone walls.
And then Draco reminded himself that he was nothing, actually, and in fact Potter might yet want to kill him and may want to do so even more if Draco were to say something so clearly callous about his regard for the well-being of their classmates. So Draco shut his mouth with a click and turned his head away and said nothing.
“I don’t want to,” he said, staring hard at the anti-nausea potions as he placed them in neat rows. “I just think about it.”
Potter snorted, then looked up quickly, checking over his shoulder—he, too, had gotten a lecture from Baddock before the tournament started. Having ascertained the coast was clear, Potter shuffled forward until his trainers were between Draco’s outstretched legs. He lowered his voice to match Draco’s. “You’re just mad because you’re not good at it.”
Malfoy understands. Malfoy doesn’t trust adults either, or at least not anymore. Not after the adults in his life led him to the service of a madman by the force of their own adamant adherence to their prejudices.
Just as he was heading back towards the dormitories’ wing, Greg called out, gruff and quiet, “Draco?”
Draco nodded obediently, taking the sour-smelling Reveal-All potion the second officer came back with, and then froze at the words
often up to something, though until sixth year, it hardly counted as nefarious. The point being: it wasn’t wrong for Draco to be suspected. He had brought that upon himself.
There’s years worth of animosity and weeks of figuring out new ways to throw their bodies at each other that testify to the terrifying undercurrent that has been there since the very beginning, before Harry even knew who Draco Malfoy
It must seem funny, Draco thought darkly. He had the bright, blinding certainty that Potter, too, must find it so now; that perhaps his reason for not asking Draco anything since that morning after Halloween was because he no longer felt anything.
Draco curled his free hand around his wrist, still warm from Potter’s touch. “The library,” he said, taking a step back.
, so Malfoy does it again and again and again until Harry is gasping nonsense into the air, hips and cock begging upwards, and then Malfoy pulls away to say,
Potter stepped forward, nearly onto Draco’s toes. His green eyes had always been brilliant and urgent, and Draco was pinned by them. “You like me
Potter’s fingers twitched; they were paler in the moonlight. “I haven’t flown since,” he started, trailing off.
“Professor Sinistra asked me to give this to you,” Khan said, digging through her satchel and coming up with a rumpled scroll, sealed with a green ribbon.
Draco pressed his fingers into the gilded frame again. He took a deep breath, then did the same twice more. It took thirteen steps to reach the classroom door. It took four seconds to open the door.
see him, a bit suffocated, and Draco couldn’t imagine he would do anything but make that expression worse.
The sneer is quickly replaced with the smirk that has continually proven to be Harry’s downfall. Without looking away from Harry, Draco flips a golden galleon with a gloved hand—Harry’s gift to him—and catches it deftly before knocking deliberately into Harry’s shoulder and continuing his trek to his own compartment. Harry tries to push aside the errant, unwanted thought of impending danger as he watches Draco walk away.
Draco, lungs tight with trepidation, gave a single, lurching nod. Madam Pomfrey beckoned him forward, then directed him to begin labelling the vials in the cart.
gobstones,” Draco snapped, but quietly, in case Baddock overheard. He had disturbingly sharp hearing when it came to gobstones. “It’s a juvenile game with absolutely no purpose, nevermind what Baddock has to say about it.”
“And that would have worked, would it?” Potter twisted to the side, shoving an elbow into Draco’s sternum. But Draco had suffered worse, by Potter even, and was unmoved, his hand slipping out of Potter’s grip to dart into the pocket.
"Don't be a prat about it," Harry hissed. His face was hot again, this time with an embarrassed anger.
“Right,” Draco agreed, though he wasn’t sure a statement had been made. And then he did look at Potter, he had to; and Potter had the strangest look on his face, guarded but bright, impossible to look at and impossible to look away from. Draco felt his throat bob with anxiety and a wild sort of hope, constricting his airflow in equal measure. Draco hurried past Potter to get out of the classroom, to get somewhere he thought he might be able to breathe.
“That isn’t—that’s not—” Harry slants a look at him, stunned by the force of Malfoy’s vitriol. Malfoy’s tone is always more telling than anything he ever says. “I don’t want a fucking dildo, Malfoy. I didn’t mean—”
Draco took a few steps back, until he was leaning against one of the curved walls of the tower, newly restored and pebbled with intermittent white stones. The conversation drew the rest of the gathered students, but one pulled away and settled at Draco's side, their shoulders touching.
Clearly sensing something in the way Draco’s face tightened, Queensbury hurried on, “She, ah, had us do a test run with some of the other houses last week. Zeller was there for some of it—” He cast a quick, apologetic look at Zeller. “—and we used, uh, you know. The memories, again. As a sort of starting point? It went well,” Queensbury continued, nearly hopeful, “But we talked a little bit about, um. You. Since we could tell you were kind of, um…”
Harry spreads out the Marauder’s Map the moment he gets back to his dormitory, his shoulders tense as he scans for Malfoy’s dot. If Malfoy isn’t on the map, Harry’s just going to have to head to the Room of Hidden Things and drag him away from the cabinet or the pensieve or the stack of letters from his mother, with their entreaties for him to report some progress,
And, just as clearly, Draco understood that Creevey’s petition had never just been about Hogwarts, or its students. “You want to bring down the veils.”
Ron coughs. His face is a splotchy red. “Does this mean we’re at least over your Malfoy’s-a-Death-Eater theory?”
She had been very enthused with the dark magic cleansing and the restoration magics, but Draco was remembering the rumor that Granger had cracked in Divination in third year. She was already disinclined to believe that magic of this type would be this simple, and Draco, though it had been his idea, found himself at a loss for how to explain it. He simply listened to the magic and did as it bid.
It wasn’t until Baddock pinned him with a slightly disappointed look that Draco remembered about his promise to try and convince Greg to join the gobstones team. He cleared his throat. “I’ve been very busy,” he tried, though when he tried to recall his days, they were mostly filled with him staring at his bed curtains or blank parchment. “I have to head to the Hospital Wing, in any case.”
Malfoy scowled at him, balancing precariously on one foot to shove his shoe—a glossy, out of place shoe—on the other foot. "And what will I say if one of the other idiotic Gryffindors notice that you're gone, hm? I assume you're all act first, think never types.
"Fine," Harry said, biting on the bait Malfoy so clearly wanted him to take. "What's this old magic do?"
Draco’s chest heaved and he knew Potter could feel it, because Draco could feel the rise of Potter’s chest, too. And with the space of those breaths came creeping, quieting awareness. The grin slipped incrementally from his face. Draco couldn’t remember the last time he’d been this close to anyone, let alone Potter. They were close enough that Draco felt Potter’s breath hitch, the tiny sound of it reverberating like heels on a marble floor, or shackles closing around thin wrists. The precursor to some terrible harm he was bringing upon himself.
think so,” Draco said, trying to be snide and missing it miserably. It was the quiet, he thought; it reminded him of the Manor, which once reminded him of peace. He reached for the hawthorn wand.
Without meaning to, Harry smiled. And Malfoy smiled back, and suddenly that gnawing feeling in his chest felt a lot less likely to drown him.
Draco raised an eyebrow at the number of books Potter held, pausing in scribbling out the circular runic pattern he was supposed to be devising. He’d never seen Potter holding that many books at a time. “Have fun.”
“Yes.” Draco felt too hot, too confused. Potter was speaking to him so casually. People kept looking back at them, but Potter didn’t even seem to notice it.
Draco turned his attention back to his supplies, mouth a grim line. The thumping of his heart seemed to echo right out of his chest and into the rest of the room, a panicked, vigilant sound that he was certain everyone could hear and judge. Trying to keep it contained, Draco ducked his head low just as the last few students came hurriedly into the classroom. There was a noticeable pause in their footsteps, one that commanded as much of a hush as Draco’s entry had. Draco forced his spine to lengthen, unwilling to be shouted down while in class by whatever Gryffindor—and it had to be a Gryffindor, the N.E.W.T.-level Slytherins were all accounted for—decided to stop at the end of his table. He turned his head with his eyes narrowed.
locating the dark magic at the same time, though Potter was an annoyingly quick study behind her, slowed by his insistence on helping the students who were struggling with the charms.
“It is patently absurd,” Draco was saying not ten minutes later, having stalked all the way to the Great Hall for the sole purpose of finding Astoria and venting about it. “No ward is
Draco blinked at her. “Fuck,” he said. Her words only served to make him feel worse. “I can find someone else to take my spot.”
“The stuff you said about—you know, about thinking about what I like, or don’t, or am interested in.” Potter’s voice dropped a bit at the end, worrying one worn page between his fingers.
“How’d you find me?” Harry asks, after a few silent seconds of staring at each other, his hand falling away. The cloud of his breath eclipses Malfoy’s face for a moment, a wispy cloud across a heartbreaking sky.
Nervously, Draco perched on one of the seats opposite her desk. The teapot filled a cup, which then nudged at his hand until he picked it up and spooned sugar into it.
“Viv and Verity,” Greg said, the names pulled painfully from him. Vivian and Verity Crabbe; Vince’s cousin and aunt, the only ones left with the Crabbe name. Or at least, the only ones still out in the world.
“A glamour,” Potter repeated, as if he’d never heard the term before. He blinked, lethargically. “I had to do that the first time I visited their grave, you know. Hermione and I used Polyjuice.”
With that, she clapped a forceful hand against his upper arm, ignoring Draco’s splutter of faint offense.
“My parents, mostly,” Harry admits, feeling defensive. He hadn’t expected to see anyone up here, and his heart is skittering about in his ribcage.
Creevey waved this away, already turning back to the rest of the room while Draco made his way towards Astoria. She lifted her bag from the seat behind the desk, smiling smugly, and Draco flicked the end of her ponytail when he sat down.
“Good morning,” Draco answered warily. He’d left Baddock and Khan to deal with the aftermath of the pensieve, having bitten out enough answers to questions he didn’t want to think about too deeply. In retrospect, that may have been more than a little tactless. Baddock also gave a memory, one arguably worse than Draco’s, and had remained to listen to his housemates argue about the truth of his humanity, about the reality of his experience, possibly for hours. People had still been awake and talking in low voices, scattered amongst the armchairs and window seats in clusters of twos and threes, when Draco returned in the dark hours of the late-evening-early-morning.
As if summoned by his words, Hogwarts’ magic shimmered into sight, like ethereal dust motes in the moonlight, and slammed outwards. They all flinced, Draco instinctively bringing an arm up to cover his face, his shoulder hitting the wall hard. The force of its light, bright and blue, seared the backs of his eyelids; students shouted in surprise and not a little fear. Magic coiled thickly in the air, the stones at Draco’s side vibrating with the pressure of it. Draco could
But Potter just said, “Budge over,” and when Draco did so, Potter sat on the ledge next to Draco. Draco pulse raced atop his skin. They weren’t touching, but in a very obvious way that made him certain both of them were doing their best to ensure it remained that way.
The nights that Harry doesn’t sleep, he scripts letters he won’t send. Sometimes he composes them in his head; other nights, he writes them out in a furious, endless scrawl, his hand cramping with the force of all the things he has nobody to ask about.
Ginny Weasley looked entirely too awake for nearly three in the morning, her smile blinding when she craned her head upwards to assess the damage and said, “And here I thought you were doing some normal rule-breaking, Harry. Have you lot been at this all night?”
Draco waited until she was bounding towards Creevey, talking about stealing brooms from the quidditch shed, to round on Potter. “You talked to her about me?”
," Professor McGonagall said sternly, "that you will all behave yourselves, and that you understand the necessity of these measures."
It didn’t matter what Potter said, because the truth was there in the ten inches of hawthorn and unicorn hair. It felt very clear, suddenly. The pulse of the binding charm around his wrists was inevitable. The terms of his probation were never meant to be adhered to. Draco was always meant to return to Azkaban, because he had never been good, and so there had never been a point in trying to learn otherwise. He never would learn otherwise.
Thoughts were coming together in the corner of Draco’s mind not consumed with ringing. He said, with slow certainty, “You haven’t asked everyone.”
For one reckless moment, watching their classmates part with ease, with awe, as Potter strode forward, Draco wanted to take Potter by the shoulders and holler
A month into the new term, Astoria found Draco in the common room and perched a thick scroll of parchment atop Draco’s study materials, smiling beatifically. Suspicious, Draco unfurled it and immediately made a face at her. Six years of glaring at Granger’s notes and essays whenever he was near enough meant that Draco was certain of the author behind this letter.
Malfoy had always been something rare to him. Like a glittering jewel, sharp angles and vivid in the light. Harry reaches up, to brush knuckles across cheekbones, and is surprised that this touch no longer splits skin.
Malfoy took exactly three seconds to think about this before getting under the cloak with Harry. Upon reflection, this was a truly terrible idea—Malfoy was taller than Harry, and the cloak only just covered the both of them if they crouched. But most terribly, they had to stay very, very close together to do so. Harry had no idea why he hadn't just donned the cloak and run away instead of offering Malfoy a spot underneath it.
Potter just looked at him. He looked at Draco for an unnervingly long time, and Draco looked back, an old contrariness rising in him. He simply wouldn’t look away until Potter did first. It was the principle of the thing.
Draco stood. The noise in the hall ebbed and rose as he slipped from his seat and out of the heavy doors. When they closed, the noise was cut off completely, leaving Draco to hear only the strange pant of his breathing and the frantic pace of his heart, which followed him the whole way back to his bed in the Slytherin dorms, inescapable.
"It's simple," said Creevey, sounding winded. He and Ginny Weasley had touched ground some time ago, coming through a new archway that led out to the grass. "'Hogwarts, get rid of the wards, thanks!'"
Shoving this thought aside, Draco dutifully wrote the day’s aims at the top of his parchment and scrambled for anything—
The next night, Harry and Malfoy got into bed without having said a word to each other the entire day. Once the room filled with sleep sounds, they turned to look at each other before getting out of bed simultaneously.
. It just means that he can’t say anything about the pretending. So he folds his hands under the cloak, to stop them from betraying him, and bites his lip, for the same reason.
“You aren’t a Legilimens, are you?” Draco asked, once, dubious at the idea but worried nonetheless. He had a vague notion that he would prefer walking into the lake with stones attached to his ankles than let Potter catch a glimpse of the thoughts in his head.
Draco didn’t, because his set—an admittedly beautifully crafted collection of white orbs with blue cores—came in the week before and sat untouched beyond that first curious look after he’d ripped off the packaging spells. But fetching it to prove the same to Baddock was enough to put Draco’s growing mortification momentarily to rest. It turned out that Baddock had not suffered a night of broken sleep—though given the way Baddock rubbed at his eyes Draco was disinclined to believe this assertion—but in fact regularly woke up nigh five in the morning to review gobstones literature and practice on his own.
So overwhelmed were the lot of them that no one realized they had another addition until the crisp voice of Headmistress McGonagall sliced through the silence to say, “What in Merlin’s name is going on?”
Harry, still standing, thought about this. "McGonagall didn't say the fire reached the dorms," he pointed out.
Neville was the one to breach the next, unfortunate topic with a tentative, "Then how do we decide where everyone sleeps?"
Draco, rather unwilling, thought of the Room of Hidden Things. The idea soured immediately. “Perhaps not. Wait—Minnie?”
“Who’s joking?” Malfoy sounds neutral, somehow all put together again in the time it’s taken for Harry to fall apart.
. I’ll bet you have that sodding map on you, too.” He meant it to be mostly lighthearted, but a part of him, small but undeniable, worried that Potter thought he was up to something. Sometimes Draco was dubious in his belief that he and Potter had really started anew.
” The question explodes out of Hermione, real concern wound up with exasperation. It feels like a bigger question, the kind you ask the universe knowing full well it won’t answer.
With creeping dread, Draco realized that Potter did not think of Halloween as Draco himself did, as most of the British Wizarding world did. It was not a dedicated chapter in a history book or bedtime story told in whispers:
, Draco thought, chest twisting up terribly. He knocked into his bed post as he scrambled out of his sheets, freezing when Theo, already up and dressed, gave him a suspicious look as he swept out of the dorm.
you,” Draco said quickly, into the silence, twisting the delicate edges of his quill with his other hand. “I only meant that perhaps they don’t—didn’t—know you, if they hated you.”
,” he said, and was surprised to find people up when he stepped through. He’d momentarily felt like he and Potter were the only people awake, or perhaps the only people left in the world; but in fact it was barely past curfew, and his housemates were scattered amongst the couches and armchairs, some still in their uniform. The sight of them was jarring and unpleasant, puncturing a dream Draco hadn’t realized he was experiencing. He hurried to his dormitory without looking at anyone.
It was not Monday, which was now his sole brew day for Madam Pomfrey because he was back in classes. Draco stared at the large, forbidding doors for several more breaths, caught in an uncertain sway before he finally, jerkily, pushed them open.
The conclusion Harry comes to is this: he is a wick meant to be ignited and left to burn itself out. Not a candle wick, the sort of thing that can provide comfort and light. He’s the long wick of dynamite, a cartoon image taken from stolen glimpses of the morning shows Dudley used to watch. Something that leaves craters and dust.
For a moment—just one—he considered dropping himself from the window, too, to save the other person the trouble of conflict. The student body was torn between pretending Draco did not exist at all and wanting to punch him in the face, or perhaps something worse, something vindictive that would ease the open, oozing sore the war left.
The look is gone a second later; Malfoy sneers, a familiar expression on unfamiliar ground. “To keep my family safe. Not that you would know anything about that, Potter.”
He didn’t fill the gaps, but Draco knew what Baddock meant. Even aside from their school rivalry, there was little conceivable reason for Draco and Potter to interact given their respective statuses during and after the war.
The short of it is this: Malfoy does not want to kill Dumbledore and wants to continue under Voldemort’s employ even less. They might even be able to come up with a solution themselves, if they could keep their words civil and their knuckles to themselves.
It was almost midnight when Draco gave up on distractions and got into bed, drawing the curtains around him.
But there was also exploring the neighborhood his mother’s flat was located in, which was crowded and dirty and so incalculably far from the reserve of the Manor or the expanse of Hogwarts that Draco feared he may never grow used to it. His mother walked through it without an ounce of concern, however. She’d confessed that the Black’s ancestral home, whose name she could not remember, and which Draco had the faintest feeling he must have visited before, had been located in a similar neighborhood. She did not say that it was comforting, or that she enjoyed it, but Draco had walked into the open sitting area to find a dressing gown thrown over the back of the slender armchair and knew that she did.
“Sit,” Draco said, surprising himself and half the table. Astoria only gave him a closed-mouth smile, quick and serene.
But the courtyard was empty when Draco rounded the corner; sunlight glinted off the sculptural top of the memorial, highlighted the hedges and ivy at the corners of the space, crawling onto the columns. Draco stopped and stared, unimpeded, at the memorial for the first time since getting to Hogwarts.
It was almost panicked, which was odd. Draco had never heard Potter panicked, not even when he flew back to retrieve Draco from the Fiendfyre. But he was certain that was what the note in Potter’s voice was.
you will.” The sarcasm is thick enough for Harry to taste, when Malfoy turns on him. Malfoy and his fists, which are not furious, but maybe want to be; Malfoy and his face, which is fragile the way Malfoy never admits to being. “What could I
“Yeah, well,” Harry will say, legs still loose around Malfoy's hips and fingers worrying the fabric of Malfoy's shirt. “We need to trust
,” Draco said, still outraged, still confused, still staring at the map that was quickly explaining some of the most embarrassing moments of his Hogwarts career. “What the
When he opened his eyes, Potter was still next to him and the light had moved several inches into the space between them, closer now to Potter than Draco. If the bell rang, Draco hadn’t heard it.
“Magic,” Potter said. His eyes were still closed. The sun was bidding them a slow goodbye, the suspended Lumos brighter and warmer in its absence.
, Theo had said, but clearly nobody had said the same to Potter. He smiled, a quirk of his lips that Draco had to look away from. Not enough time had passed since Halloween, and so Draco continued to be jarred by the ease with which Potter levelled such genuine expressions at him.
Harry’s heartbeat is loud in his ears, his throat constricted around bile. “You shouldn’t have,” he says, before he can stop himself.
“Uh huh,” said Potter, as Draco’s voice rose, and occasionally, “Mm-hm,” and at some point, Draco stopped in his pacing and ranting to throw a deep glower in Potter’s direction.
Draco blinked at his belongings. He had no idea when she’d put them down, or when the interview ended. His hawthorn wand was there, innocuous.
“That’s enough,” Draco snapped, some thin, buried thread stretched taut in his chest. His voice, as crisp and commanding as it used to be, crashed over the noise, stifling it for a brief, surprising moment. His chest heaved with the force of his voice.
Lucius had led them quickly away, out of the Great Hall where the dead and their grieving lay; it had been quiet, the morning unnervingly still, as they strode out of Hogwarts and across the bridges, the hills. Draco held his mother’s hand the whole way, his father’s arm iron around his shoulders, and Draco had never before seen a sunrise so rich, never one so cruel.
“Hey,” Potter said, when he reached their part of the table. There was a chorus of greetings, but the force of Potter’s attention was centered on Draco, concern creasing his features.
Draco nodded mutely, sullen and ashamed that he could not be trusted with even that. But he stepped into the green flames and waited, like a child on his first floo trip, for her to call out the address of the Supervision and Adjudication Division of the Ministry’s justice department. It was a blur of being checked for potions, his wand and magic inspected, and then another stretch of time of sitting opposite Officer Abbott-Jones as she ran through a list of questions about Draco’s behaviour.
“Fine,” Harry bites out, the word coming up his throat like bile. Something flickers in Malfoy’s expression. “
Malfoy’s glare falters, his mouth falling open slightly in surprise. It’s the first time Harry’s rendered him speechless without being on his knees.
Draco exhaled, face tightening. He was being made fun of. Obviously. He’d spent his childhood being told that his emotions were transparent, and it felt impossible that no one had picked up on ones as irrepressible as this.
It was the wrong thing to ask. Draco knew it was even before it came out of his mouth. He’d watched Potter's dot on the map for the long minutes that it lingered on the steps outside the Entrance Hall in the dead of night before finally getting inside and heading up to the Gryffindor Tower.
Professor Sprout, directing the Fat Friar and another ghost to act as guides for the guests, didn’t appear to have realized there was a problem yet.
Harry doesn’t know how to do comfort. His mouth is almost as discomfited as his body, which simultaneously wants to pull Malfoy closer and also keep him far, far away. He thinks both options would be a mistake, so instead he says, the words falling flat, “I’ll think of something else.”
Harry lifts his head, glasses smudged. Malfoy’s face is very close and Harry tilts his chin towards him, instinctively. “What?”
Malfoy flinches, just the tiniest bit, at the touch of the paste to his skin. Harry’s fingers freeze. The light filtering through the window is orange-tinged, turning Malfoy’s eyes and hair a brief, dazzling gold. After a moment, Malfoy closes his eyes, leaning into the touch. Harry continues, rubbing the paste into his skin with tiny, uncertain circles. The post-coital langour is fizzling, leaving Harry to deal again with his heavy, awkward hands and the wrongness of his skin.
Malfoy made a strangled noise that was less anger and more pained. He turned his back to Harry, effectively ending the conversation. The line of his body was tense.
Draco spent the next few days with knots in his stomach, equally certain that nothing of note had transpired and that something momentous had. He jolted every time he heard footsteps near his spot in the library, or coming behind him in the corridors. It got to the point that Draco accidentally startled Baddock very badly, pacing furiously as he was in the common room on one of his sleepless nights.
“I’m tired,” Harry starts, haltingly, because Malfoy’s stare is so intent that it doesn’t cross his mind to not answer, “of not being listened to.”
“Because,” Draco said, very slowly, “it was a requirement of my parole that I complete my N.E.W.T.s at Hogwarts. I didn’t have a choice.”
Draco breathed through his instinctive flinch at the mention of the Room. But it faded quickly, like jostling an old bruise, and by then Creevey was already continuing: “Maybe it really is that easy for this, too.”
Grief reached its cold hands into Draco’s chest and splintered his ribcage. “Yes,” he said, and it hurt. It hurt, but he said it again, in a rush, “Yes, yes, don’t you?”
The points shouldn’t affect his probation, but the detention might. It was terrifying that it wasn’t up to him to decide, and even the Headmistress’ assurances that she would write to Officer Abbott-Jones hadn’t abated that terror. Draco suspected that it was something that would plague him even after his probation finished, that it was something he was always going to live with.
“Oh?” Malfoy’s lips curl into a familiar, maddening smirk; Harry’s stomach flips, and he promptly loses his thread of thought. “Want to do more of
It had always been the question, whether Draco was eleven or seventeen, hating Potter or—something worse. It was a question that hurt, a chronic pain that flared and dulled in a pattern Draco had never been able to discern.
There was something about the tone of his voice that had Draco looking up sharply. “What do you mean?” he asked, a touch more aggressively than he meant to be.
Draco’s whole body broke out into a terrified sweat, his stomach vigorously attempting to eat itself. He was breaking the terms of his probation. With a clarity he hadn’t retained at the time, he recalled Officer Abbott-Jones’ voice reciting the terms of his probation during that visit before he was released to Hogwarts, and, more importantly, the ramifications if he failed to abide by those terms: a return to Azkaban.
Malfoy is the only other person Harry knows who has death hanging so low overhead in so intimate a way. Choices made true by the hands of others.
Professor Sinistra nodded as he spoke, face impassive. It was an atrocious idea, Draco realized as he spoke; callous, and inflammatory, and there was still too much risk of traumatizing anyone who saw it. Nobody needed to see that. Who did he think he was? Who did he think he was helping? Hadn’t he learned, by now, how prone he was to causing injury?
The box was thin and black, stamped with a glittering diamond pattern. Inside, nestled against black velvet was a cloak pin, silver and intricate, and a folded bit of parchment in Potter’s hand that read
But her grip lessened; she understood, at least, what Draco meant by heading towards the Great Hall.
,” Potter said harshly, then seemed briefly furious at his own admission. He placed Draco’s stupid letter right there on the table, the creases so neat it was practically another accusation, then began haphazardly pulling his things out of his bad, gaze darting back to Draco every so often, as if Potter thought Draco would Apparate the moment Potter stopped looking at him.
friends,” he whispers angrily, shifting so they’re not so tangled up in each other. He starts to get up, appears to have the same realization Harry had, and pauses. He throws a cold look over his shoulder and says, just this side of vicious, “Some privacy, if you don’t mind?”
Draco inhaled sharply, more out of irritation than anything. It figured, he thought with undeserved vitriol, that Potter would be the first to bring up his truancy. Even the Headmistress had been circumspect about it.
“Nng,” said Draco, a vice taking slow hold of his lungs. He wasn’t carrying the wand he’d registered with SAD at the beginning of his probation. He was carrying
Draco’s breath whistled out of him, fury cresting at the same moment. His face felt blotchy and red when he spat out, “And you’ve never had enough fucking brains to do anything without being told!”
“Right,” Potter said, his chest heaving. He’d gone a horrible, mottled color, like he was caught between throwing up and passing out. He stood, nearly upsetting the table with the abrupt movement. Draco heard the harsh pant of his breath from across the table. “Attempted murder was a far more fulfilling way to spend your nights, I’m sure.”
“Budge over,” Draco said instead, and Potter did so, tucking his knees toward his chest. Their legs knocked and settled; one of Draco’s caught between Potter’s, and the other hanging idly over the ledge.
Outside one high window, a flash of red twin plaits and the sound of Creevey’s laughter as the tower’s roof constructed itself overhead. Halfway up the staircase, a platform and balcony swelled outwards, overlooking the sloping path towards the Hogwarts gates, a dark smudge in the distance.
“Truly shocking,” Malfoy says, his voice suspiciously even. He holds Harry very tightly. “I hadn’t the faintest.”
, he kept saying, a useless, broken refrain; because he was, even if it was too late, and because Madam Pomfrey was listening so carefully, even though she didn’t have to. And Madam Pomfrey led him to one of the curtained beds and asked him gently prodding questions—about his morning ablutions, and the ceaseless loop of his negative thoughts—and without Draco’s noticing, time had slipped from the late afternoon into the pale purple beginnings of early evening.
That startling feeling from Halloween blossomed and choked Draco’s airways. He pulled away as if burned, crossing his arms over his chest. He swallowed thickly, uncertainty turning his hands clammy.
Malfoy drops a kiss, unhurried and sweet, on Harry’s lips, which is almost as surprising as his next words. “About your nightmare.”
“Potter. Cutting it rather close, aren’t you?” Malfoy says irritably. The bags under his eyes have gotten worse. It’s more unsettling than Harry’s prepared to admit.
Malfoy's expression shifted quickly into a scowl, and Harry stifled a laugh before throwing the cloak over the two of them and heading out.
“Why didn’t you heal it?” he asks, as the paste forces Malfoy's skin to bloom purple then fade, in increments, to blue-green-yellow-pink. Malfoy’s gotten paler, and thinner, but Harry’s eyes still can’t help but linger along the panes of his face.
Potter’s jaw twitched. He was beginning to look properly pissed off now, and that was satisfying in the horrible way it always had been. He said, “Can you not be a fucking arse about this?”
the parties have to be in close proximity, to trigger it. For you to have seen it affect such a large space..." Hermione trailed off, sounding intrigued the way she always did when presented with a curiosity. "Either a
“You don’t have to agree with me,” Creevey said, before Draco could formulate a response. “But I think once you start to realize how fucked it is that my brother died for a world that wouldn’t even let our fucking dad step into St. Mungo’s without Ministry clearance, then you’ll see why
Malfoy isn’t sleeping. He hasn’t said so, but Harry is paying attention. He notices the darkening circles under Malfoy’s eyes, and the way he nods off on Harry’s shoulder post-orgasm, looking soft and boyish for those few stolen minutes.
Draco snapped his head towards the front of the room again, quickly, but heat crawled up the back of his neck. The sight of Potter sent a lurch of pain, acute and troubling, through Draco’s chest, one worse than the sliver of shame he felt when Theo caught his eye again, face pinched.
of all people. Potter, who may have killed the Dark Lord, but who walked about with unlaced shoes and crooked ties and who Draco once saw eat a muffin that had been knocked to the floor in the flurry of breakfast. Draco had managed to not get killed by the
“Right,” Malfoy said, after a long moment. Their hands were quite close now, the tips of their fingers hooked slightly around each other. “I suppose this is it, then?”
Harry gave Malfoy a suspicious side-long look, but Malfoy was still staring upwards. Soft greens and yellows painted his profile as the wispy orbs floated overtop them, caught by the gentle breeze.
Draco narrowed his eyes. “No,” he bit out, not liking the question or the way Potter looked so tense asking it. It felt too close to the very conversations Draco avoided having—about the war and what it did to them, or how Draco could sometimes still find himself longing for the open air from a high place, how Potter could be caught with his eyes glued to the imposing line of the forbidden forest. They didn’t talk about those first meetings, Draco sat on the ledge of the Owlery and Potter with the forest rising over the edge of the pitch, but the shape of those interactions felt suddenly present. It left Draco feeling cornered, like Potter was about to expose a secret Draco hadn’t intended to give him. “Would it matter if I had?”
It was like every time they’d ever reached for the snitch at the same time: fingers scrabbling over the back of a hand, shoulders knocking with brief, shocking impact, thighs a heavy line of solid pressure. Potter fastened his warm hand over Draco’s closed fist, tugging it below the tabletop when Flitwick looked up at the clamor. Draco let out a noisy breath through his nose, annoyed and exhilarated.
“Alright, let’s go,” said Officer Abbott-Jones, his file in her hand and Officer Evergreen nowhere to be seen. Draco couldn’t even find it in himself to mind the brisk, careless tone she was using. He simply stood, following her blindly through the hallway and down another hall.
"I'll be in my common room again starting tomorrow," Malfoy said in a rush. Like he was forcing himself to breach a topic that would otherwise be Not Worth Speaking About.
When they broke apart, Potter was grinning again, looking very satisfied. “Yes,” he said again, “I did.”
So even though he was expecting it, Draco still felt a stab of chagrin when Potter, jaw tight, said, “I waited.”
“Alright, you remember the drill,” Officer Abbott-Jones said, as if it had not been several months since Draco last saw her. She waved the other officer away. “Potions check, magical signature check, wand check, then interview.”
made it past his lips, and shame coalesces into a tight ball at the bottom of his stomach. It shouldn’t be what he’s focused on, anyways. There’s a more pressing problem to deal with.
Harry, needing to offset the feeling that was threatening to unbalance him, said, “Old magic that only shows up when two blokes lay in the middle of the quidditch pitch at night?”
He pushed the covers away and did not look at Malfoy. He could feel his gaze, though, heavy and considering on his back.
Headmistress McGonagall took a sip of her tea, still watching him. Draco took a biscuit for the sole purpose of having something to do with his hands.
“Uh,” said Baddock sheepishly, while Astoria attempted to crush Draco’s toes with the heel of her loafers under the table. “Not really. It’s nice to meet you.”
“I want to do more,” Harry mutters, thinking about the memories already stored in the pensieve and the letter he received from Andromeda, confirming their meeting.
“There were people in the dungeons when I got home for the summer. Muggles, mostly. Some—muggleborns. Aunt Bellatrix fetched me in the middle of the night. Midnight. New moon. Ritualistic rot. I already knew what was going to happen, obviously.”
All said, it was the least sexy come on Harry had ever heard, which Harry decided to point out to Malfoy as he tucked himself under the covers and tried very, very hard not to brush up against the other boy.
Baddock blanched. He looked abruptly like he always did in Draco’s memory, twelve-years-old and lost, nervously shuffling towards his friends. “That’s not true,” he said, and he sounded twelve, too; voice thin and breaking.
Draco’s skin kept crawling, an almost painful itch just under the surface of his skin. He was overwhelmed; he was disgusted; he was grateful; he was furious. The tea had gone cold in his cup. It sapped the warmth from his fingers, which sapped the warmth from his hands, his arms, his chest.
. It’s only that no one, least of all him, can really accept an answer that begins and ends with the words
“Good morning,” Draco said, because it was; the air was crisp with November chill, and the sun warm where it streamed into the Owlery. He spotted his eagle owl, Lyra, settled in one of the high rafters and called her down with a sharp whistle through his teeth.
tucked neatly at the end of the long list of prohibitions Draco was meant to memorize. It jolted him from his daze, enough for him to say
It was not a question, but Draco responded as if it was, remembering the promise he’d made to Baddock at the beginning of the year. “Yes, you should—you should talk to him.”
“No.” Draco swallowed, throat clicking audibly. His heart was so loud he couldn’t hear anything but the rush of it in his ears. "But I've always been very foolish, when it comes to you.”
He'd taken his glasses off, but they were close enough that Harry could still make out the general shape of the sneer Malfoy shot at him.
“I—understand,” Draco said, because it seemed like the right thing to say into the expectant silence.
, she kept saying, nearly sobbing with force of her fear and fury. How dare he. Detentions on Saturdays, she said. Not even points taken, she said. Snogging the Weasley chit, she said. Still quidditch captain. Still golden. How dare he. Greg smuggled Draco almond-crusted pastries, and Vince deposited chocolate frogs by the fistful on Draco’s lap, and in his circular office, Headmaster Dumbledore knew that Draco was trying to kill him, and that Potter, untouchable and necessary, had left Draco split open in six places. How dare he.
Draco swallowed, sitting up slowly. Discomfort thrummed in his blood, quickening his pulse. “Potter,” he said, equally slowly, trying for a tact that he had never learned, “You understand that Godric’s Hollow will be very—
He was shaking by the time the floo spat him out into the Headmistress’ office. He couldn’t tell whether it was from rising anger or residual fear, but it made his heart race in his chest, left his mouth dry and sour.
“Oh, good,” Khan said, beckoning him over with an impatient gesture. Draco, who half-expected a reminder by proxy of the upcoming gobstones tournament because of the frequency with which Baddock pestered him about it in the common room, walked over with a sigh.
They were climbing the staircase nearest the Great Hall at the same time that Granger, Potter, and Weasley crossed the corridor ahead of them. Draco and Baddock stopped at the top of the stairs in silent agreement; across from them, the trio’s steps faltered, but only for a moment. Granger’s eyes swept determinedly past them, and she resumed walking immediately, a curl of pale blue yarn spilling out of her bag; Weasley locked eyes with Draco, but with a weary look followed after Granger without saying a word.
The common room was quickly divided in half, the prefects a wary line of peace between the borders of the room until night fell and everyone began heading to bed.
The morning after their sixth night of sneaking out of the castle, Dumbledore announced that the castle had nearly finished repairing the Slytherin common room, and that the Slytherins should expect to be back in their house tomorrow night.
“I couldn’t get in at all,” Potter continued, with lingering resentment. “But during the Battle, you got in with Crabbe and Goyle after us. How?"
Draco searched for his own reaction to this and was presented with the memory of fear spiking up and down his throat when faced with a bound and injured Potter tucked between Granger and Weasley on the Manor floor. There was more emotion beyond that, but in the cavernous Great Hall, whose floors seemed permanently imprinted with where dead bodies had been laid on it barely four months prior and with its barely full house tables, Draco found that this was all that he could think of. Cold corpses and disappeared students and the glitter of Potter’s green eyes under the swelling, the dirty tangle of his curls, the sound of Draco’s own voice, deflecting, deflecting, deflecting.
There wasn’t even idle gossip to spread. Draco had never realized how breakable those carefully crafted friendships between him and his housemates were until now, with Pansy and Daphne not speaking to him, and Greg a carefully avoided presence, his broken promise to ask him to join the gobstones team long forgotten. Theo had spoken to Draco only once since their return. A brief moment on the train, his narrow face a little harder, his mouth a little sadder.
And when Potter noticed his stare, he only knocked their knees together again, softer, before turning his attention towards the front.
Incredulous, Draco answered, “I was something of an accessory to several murders and terrorist acts during the war. You may not have heard.”
that followed after him like every nightmare he’d never be able to escape. He took a turn blindly, narrowly avoiding a fall down a flight of stairs he couldn’t remember ever being there, and then down a corridor that grew more and more familiar until he came to a panting stop right in front of the Hospital Wing.
“Would you like to know,” Draco asked, addressing the side of the room that did not understand why Draco wanted to claw the skin off his left forearm, “what the world the Dark Lord envisioned was like?”
Ron interrupts with a frustrated breath. “Just because he’s not bothering you as much this year doesn’t mean he’s in league with You-Know-Who, Harry.”
This is the quietest dream Harry has: he knows what to do with his hands. Draco kisses him good morning in full view of everyone in the Great Hall. The world doesn’t end. If there is water, there is also a pale hand, plunging after him to pull him up. Catastrophe is averted. Somewhere, light streams through open windows.
Potter gave him a narrow look, like he thought Draco was making fun of him, before pushing a hand through his curls and exhaling roughly. “They hate me.”
Professor Sinistra held up a hand, and Draco’s words dried up in his throat. She was quiet for several long seconds; her face remained impassive. Eventually she asked more questions—which memory, who watched, what discussion was had after—and Draco answered, quickly, guiltily, until Professor Sinistra finally sighed and said, “There needs to be more structure in order for a method of sharing like that to be properly effective, Mr. Malfoy.”
, expected to kill Dumbledore or die trying, and his home is filled with Voldemort’s forces, and Harry is just—just a teenager, same as Malfoy, with not nearly enough power to keep one fucking person safe. Forget the world, that wide, faceless expanse. The world won’t die. But the person, living and breathing and beautiful? The person
Harry wanted to say something back, to wipe the self-satisfied look off Malfoy's face, but he turned his head slightly and yawned into the pillow instead. He
“I know,” Draco said, lips thinned. He was still thinking about Potter’s hand in his, and the pull of the forest, of the sky. “But he’s still just Potter.”
“Nothing,” she said quickly. She used to be a better liar. Probably he used to be, too, and the skill died with the Dark Lord. “I simply wanted to see you.”
Greg’s words hit Draco hard, hollowing him out until he felt about two feet tall. Just as quickly, a vitriolic response welled within him, scalding his tongue, waiting to spill over,
Draco was beyond tired of his nightmares—the ghosts of Cruciatus damage in his nerves, the open-eyed slackness of the dead, the immovable stain of blood smeared along his palms. Half his nights he woke with Professor Burbage’s voice ringing in his ears—
Draco turned his head away, staring hard at the small print on the page of his novel. A sliver of guilt coiled in his gut.
With that, she disappeared into the classroom. There was a brief roar of noise as the door opened, a voice calling a greeting over the din, and then silence as Astoria pushed the door closed.
Draco slowed as he recognized where he would be passing through if he continued walking straight on. The south cloister that held the memorial. There were usually a few people there, sitting on those stone benches or pacing the memorial stone, and he didn’t want to see anyone.
Zeller’s pale cheeks were a bright, incensed red. She stepped forward, then again, her whole body puffing up with fury. “How
Draco watched from the Owlery as Creevey sprinted across the grounds with the Headmistress at his heels. He couldn’t see the front gate from here, but he could imagine the sight that Creevey must be running towards: his father, walking up the long drive towards the school’s gates.
It was Potter. Moving with steady, unconcerned steps, as if he’d done this a hundred times before. The forest rising like a fire in front of him. Draco, suspended in a confusion that made his heart race, watched as the dark swallowed Potter up, then, a few hours later, spit him back out.
They were nearly at the entrance hall now, and the corridors were beginning to fill with students leaving breakfast. There were already more people than Draco had seen in weeks turning and staring at him and Astoria, then turning back to whisper to each other. Claustrophobia encroached on Draco, a stifling need to escape crawling up his spine.
It was clear that the group was led by Gryffindors, as the nearly unanimous decision was to attempt the repairs that very night.
But it wasn’t, because Professor Sinistra frowned. “You of course do not have to participate, should we continue this either within the house, or outside of it.”
Draco gave her a blank look. “No,” he added, when Astoria just blinked at him. There had been a very short period in third year, when Astoria first came to Hogwarts, where he and everyone else tried to call her Greengrass, but with her and Daphne being so close, it soon became impossible. Thus: “Astoria, don’t give me that look.”
The potential answer to this question chased itself around Draco’s head, as embarrassing and consuming an obsession as it had been when they were younger.
This was said much in the same way Potter had mentioned about his family, which was the only reason Draco frowned, but was not the reason Draco said, “Well don’t be a kicked crup about it. I’ll owl you something.”
Today, though, Draco had a tidbit to write about. The broken lines of Potter’s map—one that his father and his friends made while they were at Hogwarts, Potter explained as they sat together in that sun-drenched window seat, the Marauder’s map—had pulled endlessly at Draco’s brain in the days following Halloween.
Madam Pomfrey nodded, never stopping in her motions. Ladle the potion; empty it into a vial; hand it to Draco to label. It was very efficient, and proper, and Draco felt as if he would unravel if she so much as looked up at him.
“Nothing,” Potter said, with equal force. The faint sound of rumpled parchment reached Draco’s ear; Potter took one step forwards. “I was only—why’re
Bitterly, Draco ate his biscuit and started on his third cup of tea. She did this sometimes, as if she thought it would reignite some hidden desire to attend classes with students who ignored him at best and hated him with reason.
She smiled when she saw where he was looking. “We’re not allowed to have house specific memorabilia unless we’re a Head of House,” she explained. “It’s rather nice to have the reminder up again.”
Malfoy is something that wants to cut first. He’s always been. Which means Harry should know better,
If pressed, Harry could admit that he spent more years of his life pretending to be living a different one than paying attention to his actual one. His most consistent daydream—his most elaborate—featured Lily and James Potter, alive and loving and warm. In his mind, their home—
“Listen, Hermione,” Harry says, trying to be calm and reasonable the way he never is, especially on the topic at hand. “Malfoy
“I know,” Potter said, sounding aggravated. He toed at the ground with his trainer while Draco narrowed his eyes at him. “It’s just—I mean, why come back, if you’re not even going to come to class or, or eat in the Great Hall—”
The approach of Halloween was accompanied by crisp leaves and levitating pumpkins and Potter, still, almost daily; finding Draco in the library after dinner, or in an airy classroom during a free period, as if they had promises to keep. It was the most bizarre thing of the year thus far, and a wild, inexpressible feeling tangled in Draco’s throat every time he looked up to find Potter heading unerringly towards him or, better, seemingly waiting for him. It was causing the steadiest, sweetest destruction of Draco’s sanity.
She gave his shoulder a tap, then resumed her ladling. He took the first vial with trembling fingers, the filmy potion sloshing along the inside of the glass.
Harry’s heart was thudding in his throat. “Make me,” he said, and watched as Malfoy’s eyes darted down to Harry’s lips.
“What for?” Zeller frowned in a way that made her look even more severe, though Draco suspected this was actually her version of concern.
Draco broke Theo’s gaze, his throat bobbing with an unsteady swallow. Every word of his argument with Potter was blaring through his skull, as was every fumbling attempt at apology that Draco had written into a letter and sent to Potter the morning after his conversation with Greg, and all it did was make Draco feel more and more foolish and blundering.
And of course Draco hadn’t submitted the assignment, lost points to boot, and skipped the detention besides, because there was a cabinet that determined whether his family lived or died and its repair was as equal a noose as its disrepair.
“Oh, next week will be fine,” Astoria said happily, sunny. “Creevey just has to submit it a day before.”
Potter, however, stopped and nodded, opening his mouth and then shutting it just as quickly. He was staring very hard at Draco; Draco could still feel the dry warmth of Potter’s palm against his own and curled his hand into a loose fist in an attempt to push the memory away. He had a thought, indistinct, that they had unknowingly placed themselves on a precipice, and that whatever Potter did next would cement their slide into indifference or—whatever it was that existed on the other side of that.
He delved into the dustiest, unused parts of the library—abandoned sections for classes no longer taught and back-issues of the Prophet so old the preservation charms had faded—and gingerly sought out the grassy hills and sandy edges of the lake, surprised still by the sky overhead, and spent a long afternoon at his desk in the dormitories, staring into the swell of dark water on the other side of the cold glass and failing to write to his mother.
“She’ll kick me out otherwise,” Draco told her, making a face at the slight rasp to his voice. He cleared his throat, straightened his spine. “And I don’t have anywhere else to go.”
. But I’ve asked everyone, and the best that I can think is some—some charm or something to counter the wards individually.”
Greg cleared his throat. Draco deemed it safe enough to look over at him. Greg said, “I didn’t know he was here.”
“Okay,” Harry says instead. Outside the windows set high in the wall, October continues its quiet march towards November.
Malfoy holds his gaze. Everything is softer in the wintry morning light, even the angles of his face. He says, “I’m fine.”
—and so he barely noticed when he was being led to the Slytherin table in the Great Hall until Zeller and her shockingly bright yellow tie and crest sat across from him. The sight shook him from his musings, half out of an instinctive surprise at seeing someone forego the house tables.
, but by that point he’d have forgotten the specifics, only aware of the thick, cloying shame coalesced into a ball high in his throat that refused to be swallowed. And that was only the mornings.
“Well don’t get maudlin about it,” he said, kicking Potter lightly in the ankle. “Leave that for the funerary book.”
“Oh,” Greg said, for a third time. His expression closed off. “Because you’d tell them to let me join.”
But it was only Potter, staring at Draco with so intent a look that Draco thought he might have stopped breathing. At his shoulder, Weasley and Granger were stopped as well, a look of studied blankness of both of their faces.
Malfoy led him through the corridors by the hand, and Harry felt a ridiculous sort of laugh rise up in him: Draco Malfoy, holding his hand and leading him to the Gryffindor common room.
“There still are,” said Draco, looking up in offense. He put them up again every time he left. He wasn’t an
When Headmistress McGonagall was done doling out detentions like sweets, the sky was pink and orange with burgeoning sunrise. She stood with her hands on her hips, having listened with grave attention to the earnest, often overlapping explanations of Creevey, Granger, and Astoria. She was silent for a long time, but hadn’t yet dismissed them, so they all waited restlessly.
Another shudder ran through the castle, a stronger one. Draco’s hand, which had been at Potter’s shoulder, fell to clutch at the stone wall, Potter doing the same opposite him. They shared a bewildered glance.
“Hullo,” Draco said, bewildered by the strangeness of Potter asleep on the pitch in the middle of the night and the ghost touch of his cold hand at Draco’s cheek. He shifted away from Potter, barely aware of the twinge in his knee as he stood or the sting of his palms where he wiped them against his robes. Everything still felt removed, dream-like; the day in the classroom seemed like months ago. “What on earth are you doing?”
Draco made a noise of assent in the back of his throat, carefully placing the cup on the edge of her desk. That was a lie, but a kind one. He rushed through the end-of-meeting niceties, feeling displaced from his body. It was a familiar feeling. He spent most of the war in this way, only occasionally jarred back into it: Nagini curled around his ankles; his mother brushing his hair back;
At this point, it shouldn’t even be surprising. Harry would only need one hand to count all the times he’s been in danger and an adult has actually believed him.
Draco’s fingers twitched. He wasn’t sure which of them eventually shifted their hand over just enough to drop their fingers into the delicate hollow between each digit, or which of them pulled away first. He just knew that Potter ended up with the letter and Draco ended up with the seared heat of Potter’s hand curled against his.
He got ready for bed automatically, pausing to look at himself in the mirror, which he normally avoided. His hair was due for a cut, he thought critically, pushing the fringe away from his forehead; his face hadn’t yet moved past the pinched, thin look it had taken on in sixth year, though his scars—cutting up across his jaw, into the edge of his lips—were thinner and whiter than they used to be. No different, basically, from the sight that greeted him briefly in the mornings, when he forgot to look away, but Draco nevertheless felt as if there was something on his face that had to be broadcasting the incomprehensible feeling twisting up in his gut.
“Fuck no,” Draco responded. His pulse was beating recklessly in his throat, at his wrists, along his tongue. He felt like he was getting away with something, although he didn’t know what.
Potter frowned. In the middle of the room, someone conjured a blackboard and a rather loud argument as to the specific wording was underway. Creevey’s charmed chalk made a reappearance, though it kept quivering as if overloaded.
heading this way, walking right up to the Slytherin table, managing to look concerned and uncomfortable at the same time. Draco watched his advance with the sudden recollection of the voice that had called out to him when he got out of the Headmistress’ office yesterday. Draco had forgotten about Office Abbott-Jones’ comment, and the subsequent humiliation it caused; and it occurred to him that perhaps it hadn’t been
Despite the weeks since the school year began, Draco still only came up with a handful of words at a time when writing to his mother. He worked up the courage to head to classes, Professor Sinistra’s voice in his ears, and then faltered at the classroom door the moment he heard other students inside. He did not play quidditch and hardly wanted to admit to being a member of the gobstones team when his only claim to it was the odd game Baddock roped him into. He spoke to his professors in a strict, self-made schedule that ensured he was never in any one’s presence for longer than fifteen minutes, just enough time to deliver his coursework and demonstrate any necessary spellwork.
, Draco tried to remember, but it was a faraway thought with Potter watching him quietly in the dead of night.
Once, crouched by the garden behind greenhouse number 3, Malfoy spent nearly fifteen minutes talking about the plants growing there, even though they hadn’t covered them yet in Herbology. He’d flushed when he realized his ramblings, but Harry, enraptured by the sure sound of Malfoy’s voice, had only said, “I used to help out in my aunt's garden," and waited for Malfoy to keep talking.
Potter spent his days bracketed between Granger and Weasley, as he’d always done, looking worn and disheveled, his eyes in a constant state of roving, wary alertness. Draco tried not to notice this, the way he tried not to notice many other things: the memorial constructed in the castle’s southern cloister, always teeming with students; the gaps in the portraits lining the halls, charred frames and torn canvas hanging limply; the way grief grabbed hold of students at seemingly innocuous moments and came pouring heedlessly out.
Blessedly, Hermione didn’t seem to need additional information. She sat up straight, looking incredibly excited.
“I just grabbed whatever was interesting on these shelves,” Potter explained, still paging through his book with a little frown. Draco craned his neck to read the page as Potter stopped flipping through it; there was an illustrated picture on one side, completely unmoving, and large, child-friendly text on the other. Muggle children’s tales, then.
“I don’t know how to not fight with you,” Potter said finally, firmly; he was quoting Draco’s letter back at him, but it sounded different in Potter’s sure voice, less desperate and defensive than it felt when Draco was scrawling it out against a wall of the Owlery, “but we were doing okay before I fucked it up, so I’m willing to learn if you are.”
Draco readied himself for a reprimand, or a comment about the memory that he left. Instead, Baddock asked, “Have you spoken with Goyle?”
But of course, where else would he be? Vince had suffered a most complete cremation, and as far as Draco knew, Vince’s father hadn’t been able to hold any sort of ceremony in Vince’s memory before his sentencing. For the first time, Draco allowed himself to wonder what had happened to the Crabbe estate in the moors of North Yorkshire, whether it had been ransacked as the Manor had been, left dusty and unprotected; and wondered what happened to Vince’s possessions, his room.
Then her gaze cut over to Draco, so intensely assessing that Draco curled his fingers around his wand. But she only said, “Glad to see you’re not a total tit, Malfoy. I thought Harry had finally gone barmy.”
Potter became very interested in refilling his ink pot. Beneath the fall of his curls, his ears were turning a brilliant crimson. “
She pulled her hand away. The serenity of her words quieted the panic that had been building in Draco’s chest but didn’t blow it away completely.
There was no greeting and no signature, the ink smeared at the end as if Potter hadn’t wanted to waste time casting a drying charm before sending it off. It put Draco off-kilter, his blood rushing through his heart like a waterfall, and then Draco made it worse by responding, and Potter made it appalling by responding back.
He wanted to snatch it back a moment later, worried it was too blithe, too presumptive. They’d shared a single conversation in the Owlery, a long hour of sunlight overlooking the rubble of the campus and the jagged lines of the forest. Surely that wasn’t enough to put them on courteous greetings already.
But then Potter would put his head down and reach for Draco—the bend of Draco’s knee, or the dry skin of the back of Draco’s hand, or the ladder of Draco’s ribs, Potter’s knuckles pressed against them as he fisted Draco’s jumper in his hand, keeping him in place—because he was stubborn, because he’d kept the letter, because he’d sent the cloak pin; and because Draco had written the letter, because he wore the cloak pin, because he was equally as stubborn as Potter, Draco reached back, fingers dragging across the short curls at the base of Potter’s neck, or his palm flat against the jut of Potter’s spine, or his forehead pressed to the swell of Potter’s shoulder, listening to the cadence of Potter’s voice, unhurried and unhurt, and think perhaps it was worth the trying. Draco would hold onto this thought as he fell slowly, gently into sleep; and it would greet him when he woke, neck cricked from sleeping on Potter’s shoulder, Potter himself having barely shifted, his breathing even and peaceful.
“Oh,” Potter said. His shoulders relaxed. Potter’s face was upturned. He was still sitting in the grass, which seemed incorrect.
“I just think it’s silly that we don’t have neutral places in the castle to mingle with our friends in other houses,” she said, scooting over so Potter could sit next to her. She gave him an assessing look. “How are you, Potter?”
“I’m not sure,” Draco repeated, trying to speak clearly through the thick mess of his head, “that I—can.”
Malfoy, apparently reflexively, grabs his left forearm and squeezes, hard enough that Harry imagines the bones are grinding together. He continues, in a very even voice, “I had to use an Unforgivable.”
“Does it upset you when that happens?” She was still speaking in that clinical voice, and it was so much easier to breathe when she did. Madam Pomfrey had never pretended to care about Draco in particular, but neither had she failed to help when he came to her. She had cleaned his wound in third year and clicked her tongue when she heard it was done by a Hippogriff. She gave him headache potions when it was close to exams. She soaked his bandages in dittany and forced blood replenishing potion down his throat while Professor Snape closed the deep gashes across Draco’s torso and neck and chest.
But Draco couldn’t possibly begin to explain the multitude of convoluted reasons that ran through him when he’d written the letter; couldn’t describe his conversation with Greg, or reveal how often he revisited the memory of seeing Potter off on Halloween, the flutter of a pulse under his knuckles. How he wanted to learn the words that would make it possible for him to become someone who would not be so wracked with guilt, who could be gracious, how he was terrified that he would never be that person. Weakly, Draco said, “
somewhere near his throat and his skin is prickling all over, but that’s Harry’s baseline, most of the time. Most of the time, he feels like this, which means he isn’t upset. He’s just—he’s just—
Draco was revising his Herbology essay when Malcolm Baddock walked up to him, discomfort rolling off of him in waves. Draco didn’t look up, though he knew half the house was watching. Draco’s presence was a source of deep fissure in the house, and most seemed perfectly happy to ignore his existence entirely when he did linger in shared spaces.
Harry holds a version of Malfoy in the palm of either hand. The first is the boy who, up until very recently, held Voldemort in actual esteem. This is the Malfoy that Harry ends up in shouting matches and fist fights with, who Harry tells to
under heel and his own worth inflated and revered, and had never spared a thought for the course of flight that would lead to this. This was his first transgression: the eagerness with which he’d extended his left arm and
“Morning, Malfoy,” Officer Abbott-Jones said, putting her teacup down before addressing Headmistress McGonagall with a friendly smile. “I’ll have him back in half an hour.”
Officer Evergreen turned back to Draco, nearly amused. “Harry Potter?” he said again. Like Draco thought him a fool for even entertaining the idea.
The fist to the face doesn’t surprise either of them, not really. The knee to the gut, the elbow between ribs; the blinds shake where Malfoy’s back hits the door and the seat cushion leaves a welt along Harry’s arm when he falls. Harry’s body burns every place Malfoy touches.
, nearly on top of each other and not a drop of blood between them. About the simple intensity of Potter’s gaze, and the easy betrayal of Draco’s hands. The red underlying Potter’s dark cheeks. Somewhere in Godric’s Hollow, Harry Potter was wearing Draco Malfoy’s robes. It all felt quietly wrong and wholly taboo, and Draco selfishly wanted to pry meaning from it.
. Draco wanted to chuck it into the fire. Not because of its brevity—Potter’s messages had been uniformly short, a line or two of interest—but because it made Draco want to sink into the cushions and press it to his face. His chest hurt. It
Harry sucks in a startled breath that gets caught in all the soft places in his throat and belly. It makes his voice naked. “Don’t joke.”
Baddock didn’t appear to need a response. His silence was almost thoughtful, though Draco wasn’t inclined to ask what he was thinking. He just kept silent as they continued to walk, feeling tentatively peaceful.
Myrtle twisted again, floating a bit upwards. “See? Humans haven’t been talking much to her anymore. I’m sure if you asked very nicely, she’d find a room to hide you in even if Minnie
“That is a very serious accusation.” Her eyes are very stern, the set of her mouth telling Harry that she’s disappointed in him. Harry falters mid-word. He’s reminded, all over again, that adults don’t listen to him. They always think he’s lying.
“We started over, right?” Without waiting for Draco’s answer, Potter continued, “So we’re still friends.”
“Oh,” Draco echoed, strangled. He took a step back, clenched his fists. “I’m—I didn’t realize—I’ll go.”
Ron throws a wary glance to the door—because for some not-entirely unfathomable reason, he and Lavender have not actually broken up yet and he’s definitely terrified of the moment she and Parvati will join them in the compartment—before falling into the seat next to Hermione.
“Mm, no, I don’t think,” Potter said. His voice was closer now; books hit the tabletop with a careful, muted thud.
Harry made an appropriately sympathetic noise and added nothing further to the conversation, because it was Not Worth Speaking About.
Draco would plant his hands on either side of that open window and lean forward, thinking, thinking, thinking. How funny, the way his stomach shrunk that year. How funny, how his grades had dropped, his prefect status stripped. How funny, that Potter spent the year stalking him and then vanished the moment he left Draco split open in six places, bleeding on cold bathroom tiles.
“You were a Slytherin?” Draco asked, feeling immediately foolish and ignorant. From her accent, he assumed that she went to Uagadou, or perhaps one of the numerous, renowned local schools scattered across Middle and Western Africa. His ears flamed. “Sorry.”
“We will have it checked,” snapped Professor Applesnap, the opposing team’s advisor. Her face was pinched into dislike as she argued with Baddock. “To bother with cheating—”
“Right,” Potter said, as Draco shoved his supplies blindly into his bag, face hot and unbearable. “That’d be—I mean, it’s—could be, nice—”
It rains halfway through quidditch practice that evening, which is just—just fucking perfect, really. He ends practice a half-hour early, then goes to stand under the shower in the locker room until the water runs cold; the mud melts off of him and tears sting at the backs of his eyes and he, stupidly, wants to press his nose into the clean skin of Malfoy’s neck and
Harry looks at the Mark for a long moment, a physical revulsion joining the medley in his gut. At a loss for anything else, Harry asks, “Why would you take the Mark?”
Harry rubs a bit of the paste on the bruised bridge of Malfoy’s nose before capping the tin. “You were working on the cabinet? All day?”
“You’re staring,” Malfoy said in a very quiet whisper, when they finally pulled away. His cheeks were pink.
“I don’t,” Draco agreed, his voice equally low, but quite a bit sweeter. His heartbeat was roaring in his ears, though it was distant compared to the swell of silence pressing down on him from the others in the room. “You’re right. But as I said: here I am.”
wasn’t the sort of person that Potter meant; he meant Weasley and Granger, people who mattered to him. Within the past few weeks, Draco had managed to forget that he wasn’t among that number. The reminder was painful and irritating, glass caught under skin.
“He still hates you.” It was good to say aloud, staring at his wan face in the bathroom; grounding. A way to stop Draco’s brain from extrapolating wildly, illogically; a tendency held over from a solitary childhood as a means of making the world more interesting, and so Draco had to kill the delusions before he began to indulge in them.
“I will if he does,” Harry offers, copper sliding sickly down the back of his throat. His nose really does hurt; for someone with such thin wrists, Malfoy has a solid punch. A strong grip, too, but that’s learned knowledge from a different occasion.
“Oh,” said Draco, although he rather felt he would have to. It seemed like the sort of thing he wouldn’t have a choice in, given that it was his recklessness that was the reason Professor Sinistra was starting this crusade in the first place. Like another probationary measure, tacked onto the end of a long, impossible list. “But I can.”
Malfoy’s scowl darkens. Even quieter, like the hiss of dead leaves across stiff grass, he says, “I’m upset that he didn’t.”
No. It was simply not to be done, surviving that just to have Potter shove him off a ledge. Potter probably wouldn’t even mean to do it, was the horrible thing. He’d just trip over one of those awful, unlaced shoes and bump into Draco, no thought at all, and Draco would be dead at the base of the west tower before Potter could figure out the syllables for the word
“Stuff,” Harry says vaguely, lunging for Malfoy’s blurry form and managing to grab the sleeve of his impossibly soft jumper. Malfoy lifts his hand higher in response. Harry’s irritated huff is interrupted by a yawn, which he deals with by pressing his face into Malfoy’s chest.
But still. Draco hadn’t imagined the twist of Potter’s mouth, or the flex of his hand. He’d watched Potter too long to be mistaken about something like that.
. But that was not the right word, if he had done it all to himself. Surely that negated it, if he did it to himself?
A cheer went up from the other side of the hall, where Bastien Queensbury was clearly on the verge of winning a contentious match. Zeller and Shardlow hurried over, breathless with excitement, while Draco pinched the bridge of his nose and went towards the benches in the opposite direction.
Draco sat, unnerved. He kept one hand at the edge of the window; the other held his wand, though he had no idea what he meant to do with it. He’d spent an afternoon in the Malfoy family vault until he landed upon his grandmother’s wand, for all the good it did. It was not nearly as steady as his own; his magic felt strangely charged whenever he used it, at once too strong and spluttering out of power in the same instance. But he held onto it, just in case.
Draco gave him a dirty look but did not contradict him. Loathe as he was to admit it, the work did go faster with the help of Shardlow, Zeller, and her friends carefully unearthing more and more of the remaining stonework. Hogwarts was reacting to it, too, her magic rippling across them like a relieved sigh as Granger directed the team on the crumbling staircase, siphoning the dregs of dark magic from the steps, while Weasley and Astoria caught the debris with quick charms.
She is Malfoy’s idea, stumbled onto when Harry wondered aloud what it had been like for Sirius to leave his home while the first war was on. He never asked for the details. Every day, it feels like Harry finds a new question he should have asked.
Draco often searched for some small, innocuous thing to write about—the grounds, the assignment he was working on—and ended up with less than half a page for his efforts.
Potter’s voice was idle, his steps easy as he headed towards Draco, ignoring the cheer that went up near Queensbury’s game. “This was fun, actually. I didn’t know you liked gobstones.”
“Shardlow is a budding prodigy, and I am out of practice,” Draco lied, through his teeth. “Why did you really come here, anyways? Are you stalking me again?”
He said, in what Draco would later recognize as an attempt to tactfully move past Draco’s obvious fit of madness, “Um, did you still need to get a gobstones set from the clubroom? For the tournament?”
“Malfoy?” he asked, thick and slow with lingering sleep. He put out a hand and touched Draco’s cheek, then blinked a few times and pulled his hand away. He suddenly looked a lot more awake, and significantly paler.
“Why the Owlery?” Potter shot back, abruptly angry. Draco was still too shocked to be taken aback by his tone, but it did shake him out of his head. Draco crossed his arms and did a slow spin, considering the area. You could see the castle from here, the high spire of the Owlery at one end and the Gryffindor and Ravenclaw towers at the other. You could see the line of the Forbidden Forest, beyond the stands but somehow very close and pressing ever closer. You could see the sky in a single unbroken stroke overhead. You could even hear the lake, if you listened hard enough.
“Tergeo,” he muttered, pointing his wand at his hair and siphoning the disgusting liquid from his hair. Someone—probably Baddock—had lovingly draped the Hogwarts Gobstones Team banner, starched and mended, from the top benches. Draco batted the edges away before he could actually sit.
, but that was crazy. He wasn’t going to say that out loud. And anyways a hundred was probably too low an estimate.
. It helps to point to something tangible and name the fear of it when people don’t—don’t understand.”
whispered to each other during class like always. It was inevitable. It had always been, and the part of Draco that was always seeking the sky twinged at the thought.
Saying it aloud nearly made Draco laugh at the impossibility of it, at the danger of it. The idea was so fundamentally counter to his understanding of the world that he could only stare, suspended in a state of disbelief, when Creevey grimly nodded.
“Yes, yes,” Professor Flitwick said happily, taking down the shield charms he’d put up to contain the weather. “But I always hoped you would take a Charms concentration, you know. The elemental charms were intended for the end of term exam, and you’ve nearly mastered them only already!”
Draco was sitting on the ledge of one of the great big windows, daringly dropping owl treats between his dangling legs and watching them plunge dispassionately towards the grass below, when he heard someone stomp up the stairwell. Draco tensed.
Potter was watching him. His hand was shaking where it gripped Draco’s wrist. “You didn’t like me, then.”
Harry presses the back of one hand under his nose to stem the flowing blood, scowling at the memory. “And, for the record, I
“Salazar prohibit the exactitude of a schedule,” Malfoy scoffs. He sticks something into his book to mark his place, then packs his bag with sharp, agitated movements. “Surely an estimate of the length of your lessons would not be remiss. What sort of a professor, even a former one, isn’t able to judge the length of a lesson? Honestly, you’d think—”
"We don't want to get rid of all the wards, do we?" asked Baddock, sounding alarmed. "Just the ones pushing away non-magical people."
Potter shrugged a shoulder, looking a little awkward. “I’ve always talked about you,” he said, and pulled away, turned his head. The back of his neck grew red. “We should get everyone out while Ginny gets the brooms.”
“I don’t know,” he admitted, slowly. His gaze flicked up towards Potter. “Would you want your relatives to come?”
She sounded curious. Most people had seen Draco and Potter together in the library or in classes, and perhaps at Hogsmeade station before break. But there was a level of remove to it all; as much as people were still trying to get Potter’s attention, there was a hushed nature to it now. Like they’d forgotten, until they saw Draco at his side, that Potter, too, had done terrible things in the course of the war. When they were spotted together, people seemed reluctant to get close, as if they both held something contagious.
When Malfoy says stuff like that, Harry needs to be able to see his face. He fumbles for the loose end of the invisibility cloak.
"Trying to set it afire?" Malfoy's voice was unexpectedly close, and Harry jumped at the sound. He turned to find Malfoy, arms crossed tightly across his chest, barefoot next to him. He looked weird in normal sleepwear, with his hair clearly free of product. He almost looked like a regular person, instead of the bane of Harry's existence. The sour look he wore as he glared at the duvet, however, was refreshingly familiar.
The dungeon grew briefly airless. Harper, combative and red-faced, said, “He went about it wrong, we’re not saying—”
was. Draco inhaled shakily and barely resisted the impulse to plant his palms into his sockets and push down until the world made sense again.
Potter began showing up out of nowhere, just like those lost years before the war: catching Draco’s eye as they hurried down the halls in opposite directions, happening upon Draco as he left the Owlery, sitting in places Draco had meant to be, looking up with that strangely intent gaze he’d developed since that night on the pitch.
“Is Khan in herbology with you?” he asked, refusing to stop. The corridor was crowded, and the other students seemed to press closer as they continued to spill out of the Great Hall.
“Yeah?” Harry asks, face hot with fury. The tables and bookshelves in the room shake with the force of it. “And what if she
“Malfoy,” Potter started, sounding—Draco didn’t know. He didn’t know what to call that specific tone in Potter’s voice, or why it made him feel as if he’d been caught out doing something horrific.
“Is it?” Potter asked, very quietly. His face was too vulnerable tilted up like this, to look Draco full in the face.
“Were you—” Potter’s voice was a little rough, a little uncertain, but he wasn’t looking away from Draco. “Last night, were you—”
“What?” Draco asked, though it came out a whisper. Any louder, and he was sure something would shatter.
“Maybe we should write to her,” Greg said, haltingly. His hands were fisted at his sides, face folded into one of his big frowns. He hadn’t looked away from Vince’s stone.
His days were cracked open with time as a result. Draco feared this would leave him as Azkaban did, listless and wan and prone to remembering the horrors of the Manor with every slow blink of his eyes. But with access to the library, and the grounds, and the empty classrooms and alcoves and corridors throughout the castle, Draco instead found himself ravenous for movement and knowledge and actions, as if rediscovering hungers he’d forgotten existed.
"It's easier than they think," Draco said. He turned to the side slightly, to give Potter a considering look.
“The letter.” Potter finally looked away from Draco to fumble about with his robes, digging into his pockets and unearthing a mortifyingly familiar scrap of parchment.
A reserved sort of panic burst in Draco’s throat. It felt, suddenly, that once this moment slipped away, so too would Potter, and that Draco would never get it—him—back. The desire to step forward immobilized him, and as did the fear of what would happen if he didn’t.
Malfoy pins him with an intense, uncomfortable look. He says, voice still measured and even, “I didn’t think it would mean anything.”
“Baddock,” Draco greeted with stiff politeness, taking the empty seat across from him. As revenge, he waved a hand towards Astoria and said, “You know Astoria, of course.”
“He’s a student at Hogwarts,” Officer Abbott-Jones said mildly, while Draco struggled with the acute, cloying sense of helplessness that he hadn’t felt since the Dark Lord lived a bedroom over from him. “We could pop over to verify the story, so long as the Headmistress is agreeable.”
Potter’s face had been tilted towards him, and he’d been wearing Draco’s transfigured cloak, and whenever Draco tried to play out the rest of it, the
He preferred to work in the library, or sometimes in the empty classrooms in the corners of the dungeon, but past curfew Draco had few choices other than the common room if he wanted to continue his schoolwork at a well-lit table. So that was where the evening found him, the Lumos charm held in the table lamp bright and warm.
if he finds out what you’re planning on doing with your memories, Malfoy!” Harry shouts. “And that’s
After a moment, Myrtle seemed to realize he didn’t understand. She floated forward, giving Draco an unpleasant shock of cold when she cupped a hand around his ear and said, “Hogwarts, of course.”
“To be clear, it was irresponsible of you to do,” she continued, and Draco nodded like a marionette—yes, yes, he knew, of course. Her face softened slightly as she spoke. “But the impulse is not wholly incorrect. The experience of sharing and contextualizing trauma is one that can foster understanding and empathy to parties beyond the perpetrator and victim.”
Not that Malfoy would mind it. Harry’s pretty sure that Malfoy finds it personally offensive if Harry doesn’t accidentally get caught staring at him at least once a day.
“I fucking hate you,” Harry says instead, to the ceiling. His throat hurts, and not from the sorts of things he dreams about. Harry is laying on his back on the stone floor, Malfoy a huddled form at his peripheral.
, Draco wanted to say, but he was thinking of Potter, and of Astoria, and of Baddock; he was thinking of his meeting with Professor Sinistra. He was thinking of the things he deserved, and the things that he had, and how difficult it was to ascertain for himself how much more blame he was supposed to shoulder.
and other such stuff, which at least gave Draco’s quietly panicking brain a new thought to latch onto.
And what else is Harry supposed to do? He has a heart that has always wanted to belong to someone else.
He’d watched too long to be mistaken, too, about the fact that whatever expression had crossed Potter’s face earlier had not been a smile. It wasn’t a smile. But Draco didn’t know Potter well enough to tell what it had been.
Harry starts to smile and promptly finds himself landing heavily on the stone floor, the transfiguration on the desks undoing itself and dropping both of them unceremoniously to the ground.
“What,” Draco said, again, but more forcefully; delight and horror mingled as the whole of Hogwarts spread across the parchment, moving dots and little scrolls unfurling gracefully. His eyes zeroed in on two dots,
Learned knowledge: if he tries to get close, they’ll dunk his head under the water and hold him there.
"Me? A prat?" Malfoy looked like he couldn't decide whether he wanted to laugh or sneer, and the result was a choked sound escaping him. "
The night was almost as quiet as the first. Perhaps emboldened by the fact that nobody had been hexed—yet—there was a little more grumbling than yesterday. It lent a soothing, cinematic background music to Harry's silent but urgent hope for his bed to triple, at minimum, in size.
This new worry bloomed a potent anxiety that obscured the words he’d half-prepared as he walked up here in the first place. He forgot what he’d meant to say, forgot anything other than Potter’s name, which slipped awkwardly out of his mouth: “Potter.”
A detached sense of wonder came over Draco. Watching Potter speak was fascinating in the way mid-air collisions were.
But Potter stood up, too; said, “Okay,” in a rush that had Draco looking at him askance. Potter frowned at his stupidly large pile of novels, seemingly torn as he looked between Draco and the sodding books, like he couldn’t quite figure out the steps needed to do whatever it was he needed to.
Draco did not acknowledge this statement, though it penetrated his haze. Potter had pulled Draco from a fire. Potter had emerged dead from the forest. Already it felt like eons ago. But it hadn’t been. It still wasn’t.
“I thought perhaps the train was late,” she said, and stood from the table that held a grocer’s bag, yet unpacked.
When Harry sat up that evening, Malfoy was frowning hard at the ceiling. He was clearly thinking about something, and when he noticed Harry staring at him, he only frowned harder.
Draco straightened up, then took a step back, then forward again before finally calling out, with perhaps more snap than was strictly necessary, “Greg.”
it, that low buzz that accompanied great magic and set the little hairs at his nape standing straight.
?” Harry hisses, pinning Malfoy with a glare. Malfoy lifts his chin with as much dignity as he can muster when he’s still sleep-mussed and half-buried in his pillow, which is a distressing amount.
“Charmed,” Astoria said, with a pretty smile. “Malfoy was telling me about your dedication to ensuring a Hogwarts victory for the gobstones team.”
“I don’t know,” he said again, and felt miserable for it. It was likely she didn’t; Crabbe had already been seventeen when he died, and only his father had been alive, at the end of the battle, to learn of his death. The ministry wouldn’t have gone farther than that. Why would they?
Draco shifted under his covers, half-awake, and felt his mother settle at the other end of his mattress. Her eyes were particularly luminous, her skin unusually pale.
The conversation with Astoria felt like ages ago; Draco could hardly recall anything past yesterday to begin with. Stalling, Draco said, “You really held it in the Slytherin common room?”
Potter jolted a bit, clearing his throat suddenly. “I’ll—I’ll tell you later. Just let me back into the castle, okay?”
of it, his imagination spluttered out like an underwhelming patronus charm in the face of a dementor. He forgot to adjust the heating charms on the showers before stepping in, and misaligned the buttons of his shirt as he got dressed, hair still dripping coldly down his back. He couldn’t think past the question it left with him and attempts to distract himself away from the trailing thought proved fruitless. His brain was stuck on Potter as it always had been. He had a bag still stuffed with Potter’s books, and Potter’s map, and a wide, blank expanse of space where the two of them were meant to have enmity, but instead had a hollow that was quickly, terrifyingly, turning into something else entirely.
It felt rather as if Draco had been thrown out of Azkaban and directly into Hogwarts. If he thought about it—which he didn’t, on principle—then Draco could acknowledge that a brief period had existed in between. There had been a meeting, in which his parole office said,
A loud laugh bursts out of Malfoy’s mouth, which he stifles immediately with a hand. But Harry is laughing, too, the tension running out of his limbs and disappearing into the cold air.
It didn’t take very much time for them to coax the last few students out of the tower, half of them on shield-charm duty and the rest recasting warming charms over each other and the food. Draco kept quiet and close, watching Potter the whole while.
And then, because this whole evening felt a frantic and impossible thing anyways, Harry took out his invisibility cloak.
“Yes,” Draco said. Bribing the judicial system with most of the Malfoy vaults: acceptable. Public acknowledgment of affection: incomprehensible. “It was bad enough that Mother sent me sweets every week.”
It had been a while since Draco had experienced the rapt attention of such a large group in the Great Hall. He’d missed it, he realized, but not as what it was when he’d been younger. Then, people had hung onto his tales of cruelty and taunting, and he’d not been able to speak without that knee-jerk need to ensure that everyone
She was several arm-lengths away now, and nearly at the door. She looked away from him, and didn’t wait for him to answer. “Because sometimes, Draco, you have to actually take part in the world you want to see. I’ll save you a seat.”
In the small space between their heads, Malfoy laughed. Harry found he rather liked the sound. "Good night, Potter."
Harry shoves Ron over a seat and tucks himself into the space between them, because if he doesn’t get to ride with Draco, he’s at least going to ensure he has a best friend on either side of him. Hermione pats his knee somewhat absently, already arguing with Luna about the veracity of a ritual that sounds, to Harry, like it’s just meant to make you get frostbite.
Draco reflected on the inevitability of this during his morning ablutions, reviewing his sins as a reminder that he was not and had never been the sort of person Potter would willingly interact with. Whatever impulse had led Potter to the small kindness of returning Draco his wand, of his near friendliness since that day in the Owlery, was only an extension of Potter’s inherent goodness. Potter may still wish Draco dead for any manner of things, may still have hold of the animosity Draco himself could no longer muster; and it may only have been Draco’s baseless expectations that had convinced him, briefly, that it was possible to move on from such immovable fixtures in his life as Potter and his hatred towards him.
The impulse was still there, pressing at the back of his mind. Draco wasn’t sure it would ever go away, but it could be soothed, now; quieted by thoughts of Potter, and of Astoria, and of the gobstones team, cheering.
Officer Abbott-Jones flipped her ponytail over her other shoulder, and beckoned Draco over to the fireplace. “I’ll have to call the floo address for you,” she said, “Standard, you know.”
“Don’t fucking call me that.” An angry flush is starting under Harry’s collar, creeping into his throat. “Don’t
Draco made an odd, hitching noise. He was so incurably overwhelmed that he had to leave the flat and do terse laps around the grimy, slippery block until he could blame his heart rate on the exertion.
The scent of snow is on the air, when Harry leans half out of the window with Hedwig on his arm and Malfoy’s arms tight around his waist.
Harry can’t decide how he feels about this. He thinks he would admire it, if he learned about this relentless determination in an ordinary context. It’s awful and intoxicating, how desperately Malfoy clings to life.
He said, “The board of governors would never agree to undo the wards. I don’t know if anyone even knows how they were laid in the first place.”
Harry keeps thinking of the graveyard, and the torture Voldemort inflicted on Avery, after throwing himself at his feet. Keeps thinking about the way a body contorts under the cruciatus. Keeps thinking about the deceptively gentle flutter of the Veil.
More nights than he’d like to admit, Harry wakes up certain of his impending death. It’s not a nightmare, exactly. It’s just knowledge that presses insistently along his skull, etching itself into the delicate bone:
Which: of course he did. Draco had never done anything right in his life. Maybe even his promise to himself, about not making his mother pay for his funeral, was the wrong choice. Maybe she’d have preferred it.
Harry bit down on a smile, and turned his head as Ron and Hermione put their stuff down opposite him.
have to sleep next to Draco Malfoy? Surely that was too much bad for a single person to have to carry?
Through it all, too, Draco was thinking about the wards, and the denial, and that brief explanation that was so offensive for its easy dismissal. It only made him angrier and agitated the more he thought about it. There were other ways to deal with the wards. There had to be. The wards had been in place for a long time, but that didn’t mean they were immutable features. Surely other people have figured out ways around it. Surely other places had done this before.
And still Draco’s heart thumped in his throat, nerves an unending Tarantallegra, hands untrustworthy.
Harry isn’t stupid. There are things that can last, and then there’s the incoming combustion of him and Malfoy. This is something that is meant to end in acrid smoke.
“You could sleep,” Potter said, very casually. He reached across Draco to steal the mug back, then stayed there, turned towards him. “If you like.”
, Malfoy had said, once, anxious and unhappy, and Malfoy isn’t stupid, so Harry had kept his tongue rather than point out the obvious. For nearly an entire minute.
How dare he, Draco thought with a clarity that was nearly peaceful, nearly of the level that leaning out of the Astronomy Tower window invoked. How
“Of course not,” Draco scoffed, feeling a smug grin tug at his mouth. He curled his fingers into the parchment, exhilaration thrumming belatedly through him. For a moment he forgot about Potter’s possible suspicions, his own burrowing worries; for a moment, Draco felt perfectly untouchable, eighteen and unhurt. “You’ll have to work harder than that, Potter.”
Baddock cleared his throat. Bizarrely, he seemed to take more confidence from Draco’s comment. “Before the war. Before I had to leave Hogwarts, unless I wanted to get my wand snapped or—or worse,” Baddock continued. He was very brave, even if he was mostly speaking into his tea by the end. “We were—we were very good, before that.”
The Gryffindor prefect made a distasteful little noise, then looked pointedly away when he stopped in front of them.
Malfoy gave him a long look, his silvery eyes narrowing slightly. He almost seemed suspicious, so Harry shrugged a shoulder and quietly padded towards his wardrobe. He quickly ignored any of the hoodies that used to be Dudley's, which really only left a few options. He picked up a lumpy, folded jumper and hoped fervently that Malfoy wouldn't look at the front of it until after he'd put it on.
Draco used to have a terror, in first year, about what would happen if the unbreakable charms on the windows in the Slytherin common room or dormitories suddenly failed. The fear of it had never truly gone away. It spiked in his chest at odd times, though in sixth year, the anxiety that usually accompanied the thought had transfigured into a longing, almost sweet in its potency. It would be horrid to drown, that rush of frigid, dirty lake water swallowing them all whole with nowhere to run; equally horrid to get crushed under the furious weight of the incoming tide, litres of water crumpling a spine like parchment. But then it would end, and in sixth year, Draco had been torn between that desperate clawing towards survival and the gentle escape of death. It would have been a kindness, to have the choice taken from him.
There was yet another petition on the board in the common room when Draco passed by it the next morning, a headache from the lack of sleep pulsing at his temple. He and Potter had stayed out until well past curfew, and when Draco finally did drag himself to his dormitory, his rest was interrupted by a series of nightmares that forced him to give up sleep entirely around six in the morning in favor of an hour-long shower.
wand, the one that had chosen him. A muted longing twisted through him. Draco wanted, desperately, to reach for it, but was afraid, too. He wasn’t sure how he would react if he found that his old wand no longer resonated with his magic.
Malfoy hums noncommittally. “The perils of looking precisely like disfavored family members, I suppose.”
Draco could be forgiven for overlooking less obvious dangers, the 18th-century-wizarding-literature sorts of dangers, which were the dangers that Draco privately felt his whole life had been quietly, painfully full of. Potter had been the boy his family wanted eradicated and Draco bore the Dark Mark on his forearm, and now Potter was greeting him, still smelling of Christmas and snowfall, his hand catching Draco’s elbow and staying there. Draco felt ill from how desperate it made him.
Professor Sinistra called him in the moment Draco knocked. He’d been in her office once before, when she’d required all students who wanted to continue Astronomy past the OWL level to meet with her, and it was unchanged from his memory, except that there was a Slytherin pennant stuck to the wall at a jaunty angle, right behind her desk.
“Well, someone did something,” Draco said darkly, remembering the Dark Mark across the signature page. The Headmistress had looked tight-lipped when he brought the copy, but the half-dozen defenses Draco had formulated for why he was appearing with it withered away on his tongue when she simply thanked him for reporting the defacement. If she made any announcement about it, it must have been during mealtime, when Draco hadn’t been there.
Draco hummed, noncommittal. It had been harder to tell when he was in the middle of the room, but here, leaning against Hogwarts' old stones, Draco could feel magic pulsing earnestly around them. Finding the right words would help—the right words always helped—but Hogwarts was already responding to their wishes.
“Of course I am,” Malfoy says, with a hint of the haughty tones that have mostly abandoned him since the start of the year. His fingers are gentle when they run over the kissmark. Like this, Harry can almost believe all the things he pretends about the two of them. He closes his eyes. His skin prickles.
Draco’s throat went dry. He fastened the cloak closed and took a step back, his heartbeat thunderous in his ears. “Yes,” he managed, though he no longer remembered the question. He curled his hands into fists and tucked them against the small of his back, sure that if he didn’t, he would do something unforgivable like reach out to rest his fingers against the curve of Potter’s Adam’s apple just to feel that movement again. Alarm rose at the thought, rose and rose, as the air between them remained heavy and loaded and quiet.
