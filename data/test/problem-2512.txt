Draco frowned, but before she could give it more thought, Mother fixed a strand of Draco's hair, tucking it gently behind her ear, and said with a small smile, "We both are perfectionists. It runs in both our lines. For me, it takes the form of making sure you have the perfect life. If you are happy and well, then I'm fulfilled. I would probably show off the Black temper if anything ever happened to you, darling. There is just no helping it. It's ingrained in us. Right to the magic of our core. Either way. I'm glad you've made such a wonderful if...unorthodox friendship. Just don't tell your father."
Harry frowned in thought, "I mean...I guess. Your mom is alright. I can't say I trust her. And no offense, but I don't know your dad at all. He's barely home and when he is, he gives me that pretentious look you have, except times a thousand. I don't think he likes me."
Did you know is International Tea Day in India? Cheers! 🫖
Harriet rolled her eyes, under her cucumber slices. Hermione obviously needed to say her bit, but she had learned that Hermione was still going to help them anyways. She was a good friend.
Harriet used her recently healed hand to pull the fringe up off her forehead. She pointed to her lightning shaped scar.
And as always, thanks to Anra7777 for all her help!
," the Gryffindor girls all sucked in a breath. Snape was actually awarding them points? But he didn't stop there, "However I will be taking fifty points from Gryffindor for Miss Potter, who encouraged Peeves to get you all into this mess in the first place."
Parvati gave another affectionate and exasperated sigh.
"She's Desi! She needs to experience that part of her heritage!" Parvati argued with Draco at breakfast, this time at the Slytherin table.
"There probably isn't any curse in the first place," Hermione doubled down.
Harriet shouted, "Toss it at its head!"
Harry grinned brightly, her freckles moving and scrunching across her cheeks, "Feeling better."
"Hello Harry. I dreamed I wassss having a niccccce conversssssation with the Queen of Sssssnakessss. She knew where to find a whole mountain of quail eggssssss. They were delicccioussss."
"The time in the dress shop? When was I a bully then? I can't barely remember that!"
Harriet had the best Christmas she could ever remember, even though Christmas day itself was, at least in terms of decorations, a half-assed affair. Someone had transfigured one of the house plants into something vaguely spruce like with a couple of fairy lights, mostly to have a spot for the gifts the twins and Harriet got from their friends. Turns out they had missed the bigger celebration of Diwali by a few weeks, but they still acknowledged Christmas thanks to the influx of presents that had arrived from elsewhere.
Draco hit her in the face with her pillow.
Things were going to be okay.
"There weren't many photos of your grandparents that I could find, during their time at school here, but I was able to find their graduation photos."
Professor Snape seemed to be weighing something heavily in his mind. It took him a bit, but finally spoke, "Twenty points each to Gryffindor for, as Miss Malfoy put it,
As they walked into the next room and Nicolas took in the flying keys he said, "Well this is a lovely bit of charm work."
"You got hit by your own potion. You've got red welts all over the front of you and your hands."
Harriet didn't think and just pulled off her shoe, lobbing it at the troll. It bounced off harmlessly. "Hey! Hey you big ugly bullocks. Over here!"
They sat in silence for a bit before Parvati chimed in, "Well...what sort of thing does she care about?"
This was a lot to process, but mostly Harriet thought about how they'll have classes with the other houses. Harriet hoped she wouldn't have to interact much with Draco Malfoy, or even worse, Zacharias Smith.
With another internal snort of laughter when she looked at her smushed face, Harriet rolled onto her back to stare at the canopy ceiling. She was brought back to thoughts of the night before.
Parvati cooed over the makeup set Harriet had owl ordered for her, which was a bit of a relief. Parvati herself didn't give Harriet a gift per se, but there was a large flat box under the tree addressed to Harriet from the whole Patil family. Most of the extensive clan that was awake had gathered, expectant as she opened it.
But the bloody monster from the effing bloody Chamber of Secrets, chosen by Salazar Slytherin himself said point blank, Slytherin house wasn't created for such things. It was a house for traumatized kids and the rules were obsolete! And tied into that was the falsehood of pureblood supremacy as Jiaolong didn't exactly say in so many words. She seemed to treat all students equal. Not that Hermione hadn't been practically bashing their heads in with that. All the muggle astronomy books she had sent her for Yule had been positively riveting. Merlin, the concept of "Hubble Deep Field" alone! Let's create the most powerful telescope known to magical and muggle kind, shoot it up onto the sky where it will orbit the earth as if it was a small moon itself, and then let's point this amazing telescope at the darkest spot in the sky and see what we can find!
Draco shook her head, "If anything, I'm glad that manipulative bastard had a mess to clean up."
"H-hey! Hermione!"
Draco held in the tears. It wouldn't help any to cry. Crying was for the weak. Crying wasn't for Malfoy heirs.
"Yeah. I'm better."
Pansy put her chin in her hand, mirroring Lavender, "But why would Dumbledore be trying to control Harry?"
"You should!"
"Speaking of, how are your charges, Albus?"
Harriet just grinned.
"Thank you for taking care of our Parvati."
Thanks for reading!
Lavender nodded, "Well either way, don't tell Milly. It'd break her heart. She loves unicorns."
"Huh? Desi?"
The rest of the Halloween feast passed pleasantly, with good food and conversation. Harriet particularly liked the small swarm of bats that swirled around the expansive ceiling of the Great Hall and that they served what was becoming her favorite dessert, treacle tart.
Draco sighed reluctantly, "You do."
This chapter was rather fun to write. I enjoy these conflicted characters.
"Ah, absolutely lovely this time of year. The forsythia is spectacular."
Draco growled, slamming her hands to her sides, hitting the mattress with as much force as she could muster, "I just am okay! I'm not perfect! My father demands perfection! He's a perfectionist and...and an idealist!! And he's very passionate about his work!! He wants to make the world a  better place! And he demands respect, wherever he goes. He was just doing what he thought was right!"
Everyone recounted Malfoy's humiliation a few times, then Seamus pondered aloud, "There's no way that could just be Peeves."
Hermione gasped, "Are you okay?"
"So you know how the seventh year Hufflepuff Tyler Hayworth has been messing with the Lehnsherr twins?"
90% of the Patils' home is based on stories from my Indian friends homes back in India. They're all very nuclear now, but a few talk about missing having all that family around.
She really was such a failure. She was a failure as an heir. What Malfoy associates with Muggleborns? Whether they were wrong or not, she was breaking tradition. But oh how she wished she could explain. And Harry! She was going to lose Harry! Why couldn't her father see just how important Harry was to her?! And now she was going to lose her. She really was a failure.
Draco heard the Auror Proudfoot whispering to Weasley, "I can't believe it. The Malfoys are actually human!"
She was also elegant, but had a kind and gentle expression. It seemed one of her classmates had told her a joke as she laughed brightly. Dark swirls of some design were printed on her hands. That and all the gold accessories made for an interesting contrast to the uniform robes, a similar uniform to what Harriet was wearing right now.
"I had heard Oliver works the team hard."
"So you're the youngest seeker?"
Pansy giggled.
They had a proper tickle battle in which Harry produced plenty of undignified behavior of her own. Draco obviously won, even though Harry managed to find most of Draco's weak spots but Draco found most of Harry's too. And though Harry didn't exactly cry defeat and they only stopped because of mutual exhaustion, Draco still won the battle. She found
Hermione stood up and hissed, "You're not getting it. Gryffindors don't hold the market on bravery. Anyone can learn to be brave! And you are going to have to face that if you want to be a part of Harriet's life! You're going to have to face your fear and move past it, or you might as well give up on her now. I know you don't want to be just an acquaintance with her, and if you want anything deeper than that, that means that you will inevitably end up facing her enemies too!"
Lavender asked again, "So you don't?"
"Huh?" The change in demeanor confused Draco.
"I figured something like this would happen," Hermione held out the bottles to Malfoy, who looked at them with suspicion.
Draco bristled, "I was correct in doing that! She's so oblivious that she barely knows her own housemates! She can't even name a single Gryffindor that isn't in her year, a member of the Quidditch team, or a Weasley! I was being memorable!"
Draco knew she'd damn herself with whatever response she could give. She would be a disgrace for lying to her father, but 'you are who you associate with.'
Harriet put her chin in her hand in thought, "I would think all those pureblood lines were C of E. That's what my muggle relatives are, or at least they'd go to Christmas and Easter services and leave me with Dumbledore's spy for a few hours."
He shrugs. “Any edge we can get is a good one.”
While “Mellow Malfoy” meant that he could safely bring his items back into the flat without fear of repercussion, there was still one small—actually very big—problem. Mellowed-out Malfoy offered far more a depressing sight than Malicious Malfoy did, what with his aimless, listless floating about the rooms and the constant twitching of his hands—a tick not around when he had lived. Hell, the way Draco’s eyes would glance over Harry like he didn’t even see him chilled Harry worse than when Draco had been actively haunting him.
An image of Paper Dracon playing with Blaizing Fire and the other young villains flashes through his mind. Harry fumbles the deck in his hand and has to reshuffle the cards. “That’s not what I meant. More like a wager. If I win, you tell me all that you know about the Villain Agency’s plans about the stolen identities and—”
“Oh, they certainly threatened to. If I didn’t give them the information they wanted, they told me right out that they were going to do so. And, yeah,” Blaizing Fire shrugs, “I understand that. Tit for tat, and all that. I just got so tired of those
“What about you, Harry? Have you finished the one you’re reading?” She'd gotten him hooked on mystery novels about three months ago.
The villain makes an indignant noise, but Harry’s already turning away, retrieved purse in hand.
turns a patient gaze onto him. “What would that be?”
“Wh-what’d you do to me?!” The villain’s flapping his arms about like his bird, completely useless in bringing his paper puppet back to life.
Harry gets startled by the sting of disappointment that goes through him. Whether that disappointment is aimed at Blaizing Fire or himself, Harry does not know. What he does know is that he has to make up for whatever he helped cause—right now.
chose.” She pulls her head away from her knees—straightening them out on the tiled roof—faces him and places a hand over her chest. “I didn’t choose for him to die for me. I didn’t even dare think either of us would die.”
“But, Hermione! We don’t know what they’ll do to him. They could very well kill him for helping me escape.”
Ignoring Ron’s stare burning into the side of his skull, Harry continues speaking slowly. “Now, I say we all head up for bed, yeah?”
Distantly, Harry remembers Dracon’s bad leg and stands up on his own so as to not put a strain on it. Still, he’s surprised that the villain continues to grasp his arm.
Suddenly, Dracon’s arms wrap around Harry, and his chin rests where Harry’s neck meets his shoulder.
Part of its middle collapse in on itself in a soggy mess, and a section of the back of its head breaks off. As this occurs, the rest of the snake loses its green coloring, fading to an ashen color.
As the door swings shut behind him, Harry fingers the communicator in his trouser pocket.
She walks around him and pushes on the door handle. It jiggles uselessly. Frustrated, she kicks at the door.
“Ginny!” A new voice shouts.
“To ask you a few more questions about Mrs. Figg’s missing boat.”
?” His voice cracks at the end. Harry convinces himself it’s the exhaustion.
“I said you could come as long as you didn’t go running off!”
“Hmmm, still,” Draco said. “Never pinned you for Dark Magic usage, Saint Potter.”
the condescending look Potter’s giving him. No, that’s what seven plus years of shared history is for. “Of course he’d be in. Our department sent an owl out to everyone letting them know we’d stop by today.”
Harry stares right onto the eye slits in the red skull mask and thinks,
He opens the door to see Paper Dracon.
Malfoy looked up. “Oh. Potter’s home. Say hello to my hauntee.”
From this angle, Harry can see that some even fell to the floor in all the commotion. Moving his gaze to the left, he notices that Blaizing Fire now sits limply in his seat, head turned toward the ceiling. He has half a mind to ask whether he’s all right, too, but his tongue sticks to the roof of his mouth.
“Did he actually kill any of the people kidnapped?” Hermione asks.
Harry looks through the glass to Blaizing Fire who hasn’t moved in the past half hour.
Instead, Draco pushes open the shop door to Florean Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlour. It had opened just a month ago after being closed down since the start of the Wizarding War.
Silence reigned as the pair stared down at the young man lying between them. He looked so peaceful, his chest moving faintly with each breath. After a while, Severus opened his book again and continued reading where he left off. Remus tucked an errant piece of raven hair back behind Harlan’s ear before settling into his chair, to wait.
The group nodded and packed up their materials. Minutes later, they were all spread out surrounding the large fireplace: Fred, George, and Theo cuddled together on a couch, Blaise in an armchair, and finally Hadrian and Draco on a loveseat. The blond draped himself over the Hadrian again, this time settling in more comfortably. It should have been weird, how close he and Draco were after such a short time, but it felt right. Natural. Absently, Hadrian started to run his fingers through pale blond hair as he stared into the fire. Draco hummed happily, arching up into the touch.
Karkaroff greeted the Beauxbatons’ giant of a headmistress. The woman went to sit on the headmaster’s left and her students went to the first of the empty tables. Karkaroff remained standing. He looked at the students before he spoke again. “And, now, from England, our friends of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardy.”
“Down to business.” He said as Lucius sat, “I don’t have to warn you about what would happen to you if any of this got to the wrong ears.” Lucius nodded
~ And finally, I was let go from my job.
, he threw apples at me. One hit my shoulder, and now it is probably bruised.” He pouted a little, trying to get some sympathy, but his sister just laughed at him. With a sigh, he reached into the bag and grabbed himself an apple. Dieu, they were delicious. Silence reigned as the siblings ate their apples.
“Of course. I’m not stupid. They would probably never find the body, would they.” Lucius said solemnly. Cas chuckled
“He called me a thief,” Draco said, “
“We need to talk,” he said softly.
Harry giggled along with Hermione and Pansy. They were in the carriages, the ones that normally brought the students to the castle at the beginning of the school year. However, they were not heading to the castle this time. The thestrals were flying them off to the Durmstrang Institute to participate in the Tri-Wizard Tournament. The Headmaster had said three to a carriage, and no mixed genders. Harry talked to her head of house, and Snape had allowed her to ride with the two girls. Even though the professor hated her adoptive father, he was very supportive of Harry and made sure she was treated as her preferred gender.
~ Harry
Harry did sigh this time as he fell into step behind the group. These next two days were going to be very erratic and stressful. He already felt exhausted.
Harry rolled his eyes in exasperation but went willing with Draco. A few minutes later, they reached the study with the painting. Draco settled Harry back against the desk before turning to remove the cloth again. He heard a small gasp behind him. Draco turned to see Harry staring up at the painting in shock.
They continued down the hallway and out of the Palace into the garden. Draco figured Severus would be there, because he loved the garden. Both of them did. Draco had so many memories of spending time there with Sirius and Severus. Sometimes, when he could not focus, they would have their lessons out there. Severus was in pain, so he would retreat to where he felt closest to Sirius.
“The burn is more difficult, because of the nature of a blaster,” the Healer continued, “Wounds inflicted by one ooze, take a long time to heal, and scar horribly. We’ve wrapped the burn up with a mixed paste:
. Now, I am an advisor to Senator Malfoy.”
“Ah, Molly, what can I do for you?” Dumbledore asked with a small smile and a grandfatherly twinkle in his eyes
- I love how your eyes light up with a mischievous glint
Lyra chuckled as Harry paled, stammering in shock and panic. She stepped forward and patted his cheek. She decided to put him out of his misery. “Don’t worry, Harry dear,” she said, “He was talking to me.”
The Knight stepped forward to peer into the dark, his lightsaber out to the side. “If they are that old, how do we knew they are safe?” he questioned with a glance to Severus, “How will we know where we are in these?”
Harry's job often took him to obscure places around the world. As it can be deduced, he tracked down former-Death Eaters that scattered in the wind after the Dark Lord's death, as well as the occasional other Dark witch or wizard. And, he was the best at it. I am a Potions Master, but I work from home to care for Tia. She has the prettiest amber eyes and silky strawberry blonde hair. Even at age three, I know she will be a heartbreaker. We were perfect together as a family. Harry and I were raising Tia how neither of us were, giving her a loving family and a carefree existence.
"I'm so glad you came. I want to show you everything. We'll start in the stables. Father keeps most of the undead there but those like the elves stay in the cellar and the wolves roam around the woods most the time." Harry chattered as they entered the house. There was a gray skinned house elf doing the dishes and when it turned towards them Draco saw it had only one eye.
He heard Harry’s steps as the man walked to the side and down the stairs. The crowd parted for him as he made his way to the platform. Many of the people recognized him from markets, and remembered all the horrible treatment he withstood. He could plainly see that the people wanted to reach out, to touch him, but they feared, because Harry was now a noble.
“Dumbledore wants to see me later.” He said and Draco sat down beside him so that their knees were touching.
, valued for its ability to rejuvenate the skin. Speeds healing and helps prevent scarring.” He began to rub at his chin, the faint shadow of scruff across his skin. “Marigold,
The previous night had been a success. At least, he had thought so. The party went well. The guests liked the food. Even Dudley had looked as if he was enjoying himself. But that had apparently been a lie. After everyone had left, while Harry had been busy cleaning up the mess, the young master had complained about something or other to the Baron and Baroness.
... hey everyone ... I'm sorry ... here's another chapter, and another is in the works, I swear!
“Well, yeah. Really powerful wizards like my father can do spells both wandlessly and wordlessly. He doesn’t need to use a spell for something he just shapes his magic into doing what he wants with concentration.” Hadrian said. The bell rang for class to start and the crowd that had gathered dispersed but everyone was now sending revering looks his way.
The most becoming blush spread across the other man’s cheeks. “Harry,” he answered with a shy smile, “My name is Harry.”
She smiled. “You are to meet him at his ship as soon as possible,” she said, “May the force be with you.”
They all walked silently, stopping at an open door. The Healer went in, the other man right behind. Hermione paused, looking back at Ronald. The ginger nodded. Hermione stepped through, and Ronald pulled the door closed. A soft thud let her know that her bodyguard was now leaning against the door. She then faced the room. The Healer sat at his desk, and the other man sat in front. There was an empty chair, which Hermione assumed was for her. She made her way over to it.
“What did you mean by ‘hiding vulnerabilities’?” Draco asked, “What were you referring to?”
Merde - "fuck" in French
Draco turned to look at the closed door, finally interested. He wanted to see what the school had in store. His mother had wanted him to go to Hogwarts, to be closer to home, but his father had the final say in his education. Draco was glad he was going to Durmstrang; he never would have learned the things he did in the English school.
that I think you’d like to …
“Looking good, love,” Draco whispered to Harry just loudly enough for Lyra, who was only a couple of steps away, to hear. Louder, he said, “Care to battle a master?” His tone was arrogant and cocky. Oh, Lyra would love knocking him down a few pegs.
Harry scrunched up his nose. He guessed that could explain what she and the Baron did once the Comte and Comtesse died. They were supposed to take care of Harry and the estate. Instead, they claimed the land as theirs and treated Harry as a servant. No, more like a slave. Being around the castle, Harry realized just how badly he was treated compared to the servants here.
“It’s so sad,” she murmured, “The trees … they’re not maintained. They’re overgrown. And so many apples. Everywhere. A few have sprouted.” She waved her hand back at the wall behind him. “That wall.”
Silence reigned for a second, then Severus replied, “Change course to the nearest planet that supports your bill.”
"Fetch, Bartholomew." Cas said and the wolf slunk over to where a small bundle sat in the tag-along seat of a motorcycle, with an innocent baby sleeping soundly inside his warm cocoon. Bartholomew gently grabbed onto the boy's blanket and carefully lifted him before taking the boy over to where it's master stood and setting the baby down. Cas bent down and scooped the sleeping boy up off the cold, hard ground.
Draco sat up as well, rearranging them on the chaise. “When I rode out to clear my head, I came across an orchard of them,” he answered. He leaned back, wincing as his shoulder blade rubbed against the back of the chaise. It seemed he had a bruise from where the apple hit him. “I don’t think the caretaker liked me.”
Dinner finished with no other conversation. Draco and Lyra stood as their father escorted their mother from the room.
” Draco whispered, “
Carefully, Draco peeked his head out. It was the man! He was back. The raven locks gleamed like onyx under the moonlight. Water drops shined as they slid down the muscled back. The skin, still a gorgeous light olive, seemed to be marked with faint lines. From this distance, he could not be sure what they were. Also, between the moonlight and the water droplets, he thought he could see little flecks of red glittering over the olive skin. Leaning forward, squinting to see better, Draco’s hand slid across one of the stones, producing a grating sound.
. If they hadn’t been there waiting, Draco would have pulled his blaster, which he had grabbed from his pilot chair and strapped to his thigh, and started shooting bureaucrats. Pakao, he still might start shooting them, if they annoyed him too much.
“He tried to force his belief that I’m the only one who can defeat the Dark Lord like the prophecy wasn’t a fake.”
Draco glared at the slime masquerading as nobles in front of him. He really wanted to hear what they had to say for themselves. How they would play this off. How they would justify their actions. Of course, nothing could save them from their fates, but it would be amusing to see them try.
Hadrian played happily with Bartholomew in the lush woods that surrounded his father’s home. It was Halloween and Harry had just turned five this year. Father had told him that he would raise him a wolf pup to play with if he was good today. So Hadrian found himself playing tag with an undead wolf. He didn’t understand the meaning of the word ‘undead’. Father had told him he would learn in time, that Father would teach him how to make his own companions. So Hadrian would never be alone. He hated being alone. In that way, he was just like his father, though they looked nothing alike. Giggling, he never noticed how Bartholomew kept him in hearing distance of the cottage, far closer than they normally played. But it was Halloween, the Day of the Dead. And dark things woke on this day.
Remus stepped into the room, and then froze. There, sitting on the far side of the bed from the door, was the last person he expected to see in that hospital room. Severus Snape.
Harry nodded, watching the stars blur as they jumped to hyperspace. “If you want,” he replied. He had faint memories from his time in the palace, but those were from so long ago and buried under horrific ones. It would be good to know some about the tensions within the royal family.
In Čarobnjačkom customs, the esteemed person is greeted first by the lesser esteemed in the interaction. Esteem was dictated by age and title. Normally, those two things coincide. In this situation, they do not. Before, Lord Malfoy, Draco’s father, would have been the obvious choice. But since Sirius’ death, Draco holds the higher title. “Crown Prince” trumps “Lord”. Both men were proud and suborn, so who knew how long it would be before either yielded.
Draco shared a look with Lyra before stepping closer to the man. “What can you tell me about their son?” he asked softly, trying not to antagonize the man.
Harlan Wolfe watched as Master Flitwick led the new recruits further into the Temple to begin their training. He wondered if he was ever that small. That scared. That awed. More than likely, and grateful as well. Very grateful to be saved from his living nightmare that was his life on Čarobnjačkom.
(See the end of the chapter for
Apparently, the other man wanted conversation. Draco could handle that. He could be polite, charming, when the situation called for it. He turned a page and was completely confused by the diagram display. “Yes, I am,” he answered, hiding his confusion behind a smug mask, “Chemistry Masters. What about you?” He looked back to the other man. The book in front of him was thick and titled “Cognitive Development”.
The man nodded. “Yes, I gave Knight Wolfe aid on board the ship,” he answered, “Rudimentary aid, given I was working with a basic med-kit.”
A while later, the console beeped, indicating a communication. Severus was still with the Knight,
Though I may be gone
“Dumbledore had come in and out of our house several times since July. He’s planning on feeding you a potion that will make you a puppet for him.” George said softly as not to be overheard. Draco sucked a breath in sharply
Draco saw red. This perfect man … thought he deserved to be hit. To be hurt. Draco shook his head at that. He wanted to protect his man. This … servant. Dieu, this was too much. He could not handle his feelings at the moment. Not for a servant. A voice cleared behind him, jarring Draco out of his thoughts.
Draco smiled. “Wonderful,” he said, turning back to the woman, “You’ll be a scullery maid in Duc Zabini’s household.”
~ your harbear
Draco frowned. That was all the book said. How useless. He moved that one aside and moved on to the next. A few hours later and still nothing. Shifting through a stack of documents, he finally found something. A death certificate. For Comtesse Lilian Potter. Cause of death was complications from child birth. Underneath, he found another a birth certificate. What his mother had said was true. But what happened after? He kept looking, and his throat tightened when he found another death certificate. This one was for Comte Jameson Potter, four years later. Hunting accident. So. What happened to the child?
The other boy their age, with dirt smudged on his nose, stepped forward, his face reddening in anger. “What is he saying?” he shouted as he pointed an accusing finger at Haydrien, “I heard the word ‘Weasley’ with whatever language that was!”
“In my defense,” he stated, “I’m still not fully awake, and I’m panicking. Sorry, but social decencies are not a high priority right now.” The Knight stood up, cloak and lightsaber in hand. “I’m now my way.”
Harry’s eyes widened as something clicked in his mind. “I … I remember you,” he whispered, stepped closer, “I … I used to call you Dobby.” He shook his head, laughing mirthlessly. “I thought it was a crazy dream. All these years …” When Harry reached Dobbeson, he hugged him fiercely, the old man mirroring his actions.
Four years later
He stood up and stretched, his back creaking. He glanced out the window. He had been in there several hours, but there was still enough daylight left. Enough to go find this townhouse. To go find more answers. But first, he needed to go get Lyra. She would never forgive him if he went without her. On their way back, she shared that she found Harry fascinating as well. Her curiosity was peaked, and she wanted to know what happened with the Potters and the Dursleys.
After a few minutes, Cas managed to push Lucius back enough to look at the man. He smirked. “I’ve had a breakthrough,” he said.
With his poor eyesight, Harry could only discern the noble’s pale blond hair, but that did not matter. The man was a thief, stealing apples from the Dursleys. He did not know how or why, but he was sure it would get back to the Baron and he, Harry, would be blamed for the apples. He needed to stop the man.
Harry could not breathe. Not because of pain but panic. He was in the palace. In the Dauphin’s room. In the man’s
Draco grumbled softly as he adjusted the dials and levers in the cockpit of his ship. He hated having someone else fly it; they always messed everything up. The Jedi better hurry up and get there, because Draco was itching to leave.

“That’s not something you ask in public Draco.” He said but Hadrian just let his mask slip away and grinned
Harold Potter. He finally started to believe Draco.
Hermione blinked at that, surprised. She was not expecting the man to have those titles. Two doctorates. Consort to Prince … Oh, Draco had gone to
One quick question before you go: Do you still want little snippets of Cas' childhood?
“Harry,” Draco said, motioning to Dobbeson, “This is the caretaker of the townhouse. You may remember him?”
Harry returned to the present when the doors opened. He took a deep breath and walked in. When he reached the center of the room, he bowed and waited with his head ducked for one of the masters to speak.
Severus bit his lip and shook his head. “No, not exactly,” he answered, “I mean, I don’t know the man, the Jedi Knight Harlan Wolfe. I knew the child, Harry.”
. The straps narrowed to those of a tank top, exposing his two tattoos.
The angry man turned back to the thrones, but was stopped from continuing his tirade by the king. King Lucius simply raised his left hand, and it was like the Baron’s voice was stolen right out of his throat. With a vaguely bored expression, the King waved his hand, indicating that Draco should continue.
by the royal family.
“I remember them,” the Queen said softly, “Well, I remember the Comtesse. Lily. She was from Sweden, I think.” She absently tapped on the side of her wineglass. “We were friends. Before. The Comte Potter swept her off her feet. He rarely came to court, but somehow …” She shrugged, turning back to Draco. “They married, and she left court with him. They had a child, but there were complications from the birth. She died. I don’t know what happened to the Comte or the baby.”
Haydrien arched an eyebrow at the pair of twins, standing a bit to the side of the rest of the group, with a young girl clinging to their sides. He then turned to Draco, a small smirk on his face. He decided to invoke a guise he loved using, since it gave new insights to people: the foreigner that did not speak English.
Draco moved to stand before Petunia. “Since you are fond are cut words and harsh work, your tongue shall be cut out and you shall become a servant.” The blond looked around the gather courtiers. “Is anyone in need of a maid?”
“Lord Mort so that…”
“There. You look the part of a Pureblood even though you’re really just a Halfy.” Draco said playfully. Hadrian sent him a glare but didn’t reply. By this point the train was slowing down and the two boys began to put everything away that they had pulled out of their trunks.
For the rest of the day, Harry continued on with his duties. The time in the orchard had taken a large chunk of his day. Normally, that would not be that big of a deal, but today it was. The Baron and Baroness were holding a feast for Dudley, in celebration of his eighteenth birthday, which Harry was in charge of preparing. Even though the young baron’s birthday was before Harry’s, they had postponed the celebration because some of his friends were out of the country.
McGonagall sighed. “It could,” she conceded, “but it will help Harlan in the end. His past torments him still, after all these years. Going back as he is now should lessen their effect on him.”
Actually, like this, Jedi Wolfe deeply reminded him of Harry, his childhood friend. Harry was his slave, but Draco never thought of the boy as that. He was his companion. Draco had not seen Harry since they were six, and the boy was sold away.
Lyra opened the bag, then squealed. Very loudly. Right near his ears. “Dray, where did you find them?” she asked, bringing an apple up to her eyes to inspect. She took a bite and hummed in appreciation.
“Potter, Harry.” The woman called again looking pointedly at him. Hadrian smirked at her before she went on. Finally, he was the only one left standing.
He had come to when his bonds were cut, collapsing heavily to the ground. He blinked up and saw the Baroness. She sneered down at him, throwing his shirt and a vest at him. “Wear that,” she had spat, “To cover the blood.” And then she had disappeared into the house.
Draco watched the color drain from his friend’s face, which looked very odd over hologram. He frowned and leaned forward, concerned.
~ My job consumed my life, leaving very little free time
Dobbeson stepped slowly, as if afraid this was all a dream. Harry frowned in concentration as he tried to place the old man. “Little Master Harry,” Dobbeson whispered, his voice choked with emotion, “You’ve returned.”
Dr. Snape nodded at the words, and Hermione had to agree. She understood that precaution. Back when she was fifteen, she broke her ankle. It was fixed right away, but she had to wear an immobilizing boot for two weeks.
The sound of a shuttle landing brought Draco out of his thoughts. It seemed his Jedi protector had arrived. He rolled his eyes as he stood up from his seat. He did not need a babysitter, no matter what the Chancellor or Master McGonagall thought. He walked down the gangway to the pad to meet them, wondering what the Knight would look like.
At Draco’s surprised eyebrow, Severus shrugged awkwardly, looking away. If Draco did not know better, he would have sworn Severus was blushing.
* ~ . X . ~ *
fantasize. Priorities.
“Because I found the Knight unconscious with a blaster wound to his side,” Severus replied, tone reminiscent of times in the past when he thought Draco to be extremely idiotic, “He needs professional medical attention, preferably on a planet that does not want you dead.”
Draco cringed. “Hello, Granger,” he said, “I’m sorry I didn’t contact you. I’ve been a little scattered at the moment.”
He was cut off by the sound of a lightsaber igniting. They looked up to see, through the branches, the Knight swing his deep indigo saber. A moment later, Harlan stepped into the enclosure made by the branches.
Harry sighed again, fiddling with his lordship ring. It was a habit he developed after Dobby had pulled it out of the safe in the master suite: spinning the silver band with the Potter crest pressed into the metal around and around his middle finger. Harry glanced back around and again took in the beauty of the gardens. He thought that, just maybe, he could get used to this.
Draco clarified. His friend nodded in understanding.
A special bond one cannot see
Draco walked over and settled next to Harry, again taking his hand. “The Comte and Comtesse Potter,” he whispered, “Your parents.” He let the silence stretch out so as to let the other man process for a bit.
As soon as they returned to the palace, Draco had gone back down to the archives. Lyra had planned to go as well, but Queen Narcissa had other plans. Their mother had whisked her away for an afternoon of bonding. Probably embroidery. Draco shuddered. Lyra had given him a pleading look over their mother’s shoulder, but Draco had left her to her fate. Better to suffer her anger than the ire of Queen Narcissa.
Draco groaned, rolling up to standing. “You’ve been around Americans too long, Blaise,” he commented, “They’re making you no fun.” He snuffed out his cigarette on an appetizer plate.
“Draacooo,” she whined, collapsing against his chest. In their struggles, they ended up lying flat on the chaise. When they were alone, propriety tended to go right out the window. With one last laugh, Draco lowered the bag and handed it to Lyra. Draco grunted as she elbowed him in the stomach on her way to sitting upright.
“And because you do I must decline. Of course, I can always write to my father and tell him you are keeping me from my studies.” Hadrian said, his voice never darkening but remained polite and calm.
“You will go with him to his planet for a family funeral,” she said, “The planet is very pro-slavery, with centuries of cultural dependency on it. Thus, he will be very unpopular.” She looked over her glasses at the young man. “Protect him and bring him back to Coruscant safely.”
Draco took the man’s hand to offer some comfort, and led him up the stairs. Reaching the door, he pulled a key out of his pocket; Dobbeson had given it him before they left the last time. ‘So you won’t break in again,’ the old man had said. Draco smiled at Harry as he pushed open the door.
He stretched, his lean muscles accentuated by the stretchy material of his undershirt. Draco made a contented noise and dropped his arms. With smirk at the other agents in the box, he headed out the room. As the door was closing, he heard one of the female agents say, “Is it just the two of you, or are all Brits this attractive?”
It's a bit short, but it's from a different point of view. So I hope you enjoy it. =)
Draco watched as the three stared blankly at Harry. Everyone waited for the recognition to hit. This was not part of their plan, but Draco would follow Harry’s lead. He was the injured part in this situation; whatever he wanted to do, they would do.
Luna, Draco’s cousin, smiled back and released his wrist. “It’ll be fine,” she said in her slightly airy voice, “Oh, it’s starting.”
“What’s that?” Hadrian asked pointing at the big building standing all on its own
“Most of the time.” Draco said with a sigh. Hadrian turned back to the twins.
The two men headed up their dormitory to change.
Draco despised having to go back to Čarobnjačkom. Stepping foot on the planet just seemed to fuel his righteous anger further. He hated the archaic social structure of the planet of which he was now the Crowned Prince. How could they justify enslaving a large part of their population? Even with the dire consequences of bearing a Nečista Stvorenje, they made up at least twenty percent of the people living on the planet. Why did they execute

“Wow.” Draco said
Draco had made good time back to the castle. The stable hands were shocked at the sight he made galloping on to the grounds: Harry laying across the horse in front of Draco, anger blazing in Draco’s silver eyes. Smartly, they did not asked questions. They just helped Draco down, settled the other man in his arms, and then went off to take care of the horse.
Severus cleared his throat, regaining Remus’ attention. “Were you filled in?” he asked.
“No thanks. I would rather hang out with my friends, and anyways, I’m sure I could beat you easily.” Hadrian said coolly. Weasley’s face grew red and he had his hands in fist as if he was about to hit Hadrian. He stood there for a moment looking like an idiot before storming out of the library. Draco sniggered quietly and Hadrian smirked
Draco turned back around to face Harry. He then gasped. Harry had turned a bit to reach into the basket, exposing his back. The shirt was drenched with blood. Fresh too, not had enough time to dry. They had done something to him. Whipped him, by the looks of it.
*reappears after 7 months*
Once they were alone, door locked, Draco dropped his bag, the textbook inside making a loud thud. With a dramatic sigh, he started to walk around the room. He knew it drove marks crazy, how calm and unconcerned he was. As special instructions, Vadim Kuznetsov had told Draco to torment the man a bit before killing him. While Draco was not fond of physically torturing people, he could psychological.
Draco stared out a stained glass window, the colored glass distorting the world outside. He absently ran his fingers over the frame, lost in thought. Still nothing. He had hoped this house would give some answers, but he was wrong.
Hermione was not familiar with those herbs, and that irked her. Vaguely, she knew them to have healing properties, but not what those were, specifically. She looked to the other man; with a doctorate in biology, he could know more about the herbs. She watched, gauging his reaction.
The woman in the projection pursed her lips, apparently not missing the sarcasm either. “Really now? Is that any way to talk to me?” she reprimanded, “Now, after the funeral, there will be a ceremony where you’ll be named as the Crown Prince. It is essential that you are there, Draconis, showing your commitment to your planet, what with all these preposterous rumors about your involvement in the anti-slavery movement.”

Harry had moved, now standing right before the painting. His hand rested on the mantel as his face was tipped back to study the details. Draco cleared his throat softly, causing the man to jump slightly. Harry turned to face them, and Draco heard Dobbeson’s breath catch in his throat.
Draco made a disgusted sound. “Of course he does,” he murmured as he picked his way across the rocks towards Blaise, “He couldn’t just pick for me; I get to pick who I’m saddled with for life.” Once he reached his guard, the pair made their way back toward the castle. Again, unbeknownst to them, they were being watched: a head half out of the water with a large red fin idly stirring the water behind it.
, he was attractive: pale olive skin, raven black hair held back from his face that curled slightly at the ends, emerald eyes that sparkled in the city lights. “I know you are a galactic senator,” the Knight said softly, “I was told I would be escorting you to your home planet.”
Severus grimaced. “Not an intelligent one, was he?” he stated.
“Oh, that’s so terrible,” she drawled, smirking at his answering glare.
“So,” Draco said as they approached the palace landing pad, “There are customs that I’m not sure you’ll know.” The man frowned for a second. “Not that I’m implying you’re stupid or ignorant, Harlan, but Čarobnjačkom customs, well Krv Čista customs to be exact, are inane, obscure, and complicated. I think it would be best if you just act like my shadow and don’t speak.”
Alexei glanced at him, confused.
Draco nodded, thinking over everything his former tutor said. One thing stuck out to him. Just as the man was stepping out of the cockpit, he called out, “Hey Severus?”
With barely a nod, the servant turned and headed up the stairs. Like it was expected of them to follow, without a word being said. Petunia bit her tongue at the slight. Her husband did not seem to be able to do the same.
The man gulped, rightfully scared. He nodded, going to shut the door. Draco stopped it with a hand. He had learned that from past marks; once they had seen him, they would try to run the second they were out of sight.
“It’s real. Go grab some parchment, we’d best send them a reply. And fetch Hedwig, we don’t want to scare them by sending an undead owl.” Cas said and Hadrian chuckled darkly. He bounced off the bed and darted out of the room only to be back in a flash. Cas wrote out a brief reply before casting a quick drying spell on the ink and attaching it to the snowy white owl’s leg and releasing her out the window.
Draco cleared his throat, refocusing on the task at hand. “So, Sirius Black,” he started, “Son of King Orion and Queen Wallburga. We’re going back for his funeral.” He swallowed down his grief. “Sirius and I did not fit in with our family. We aren’t, well weren’t in his case, subscripted to their beliefs. We saw the flaws of our home.” Draco was a flash of some emotion cross over the Knight’s face, but it was gone too quickly for him to read. He mentally shrugged and continued.
“Why did you request emergency medical landing permission on Felidae?” she demanded immediately, “And why didn’t you tell me?!” That last part was a shout.
The man blanched, then looked angry. “No, impossible,” he said, “You’re just pretending to be him. Which is a crime!” He raised the apple higher in threat.
“Well, back to Knight Wolfe’s treatment,” McLaggen stated. He opened a life on his desk, shifting softly through the papers. “The bones were easy to fix. We put a brace on the write, because joint breaks are still fragile for a couple weeks after being healed.”
“You’re not getting rid of me that easily,” the Knight said, “Just leave the landing hatch open for me. When you’re ready to blast away from this planet, I’ll hop aboard.” With a wink, the Knight turned around, raising his saber in time to deflect a blaster shot.
Draco glared at them, causing all three to flinch back. That look promised pain and suffering. “No,” the blond spat, “You were told to take care of the property for their son, which you were also to take care of.”
Harry, however, took more deep breaths, controlled himself, and listened on.
The blond smiled down at him, tucking a piece of hair behind Harry’s ear. “You’re in the palace. The grand castle,” he answered, then smirked softly, “In my rooms.” Draco winked.
"You do have one of the Dark Lord's Horcruxes, it's a book or a diary. He would have told you to protect it at all cost. The pages are probably blank though. And what I need it for is to revive our Lord. Though it still would take a while. Dumbledore is keeping a close eye on some of the other ingredients that I will need. And then there's the living human sacrifice. That will be tricky but I'm sure I'll manage. It doesn't have to be a wizard-" Lucius cut Cas off
Draco was still chuckling to himself as he made his way down to the loading. People cheered as they caught sight of him. He smiled, greeted, waved, and winked. He oozed charm. The fans loved him; he was the up-and-coming rookie. The attractive Brit in an American sport. He acted like he love it, soaking up all the attention given to him. In reality, all the women fawning over him made him uncomfortable. If it had been men …
” he asked to the other man, “
With the hand not holding the saber, Harlan grabbed Draco’s shoulder and shoved him towards the ship. “Get to the ship,” the Knight said, glancing between the two, “Senator, get it up and running, ready for takeoff.” Emerald eyes bored into Draco’s silver ones. “Set course for Coruscant. I’ll hold them off.”
“What is it with people barging into other people’s compartments without knocking?” Hadrian asked Draco, ignoring the girl completely. She humphed before noticing the book that Hadrian was reading
Harry groaned softly as he woke up. He frowned. He was laying on something soft, softer than anything he had ever lain on before. And the bedding … It was smooth, not rough, and he was warm. He could feel a heavy blanket weighing down comfortably on him. Where
It did make sense why no one else was able to create a Philosopher’s Stone. The book was rare, and very ancient. Amongst the rituals and processes, there were sprinkled crumbs of the author’s life. The man had worked with a partner for everything in the book, before the partner was murdered by an angry mob and the author fled for his life, hiding the book away. That meant there was, at minimum, one other book about what the pair had learned. Flammel must have that other book. Flammel was so secretive about the stone and how he made it. Every academic has been curious over the centuries, but the man had been tight lipped. Every other alchemist has failed, because they do not have the correct process.
My dearest Dragon,

Those plans went up in smoke when the head bureaucrat stepping into Draco’s path. He only just stopped himself from groaning. Maybe Granger would come with him. To keep him company. And to stop him from killing the bureaucrats.
“NO! I saw him spare Lily Potter and knock her out. I saw him kill Harry Potter. He made the choice to kill Lily Potter. And with that choice he changed the fate of the world.” Cas said forcefully. Looking up he saw in Lucius’ eyes that he believed Cas but didn’t trust him. Cas didn’t blame him. He wouldn’t trust him either if he was Lucius. After all the secrets he had kept from his friend.
... hey guys ... sorry about the long wait in between updated ... I have been suffering from both writer's block and writer's scatterbrain (besides just being overworked and extremely tired) ...
There will be more chapters coming soon (as in I'm currently writing them right now). According to my outline, there are four more chapters to this story =)
Draco sighed in exasperation. He had told the other man of his family, his heritage, his title. But Harry did not believe him; he stubbornly held to the notion that he was the Dursleys’ servant. How one man could be so obstinate, Draco did not know. Draco was at his wits’ end. He had even showed the man the records he had found, but still he made no headway.
“Harry Potter.” Dumbledore sat up and steepled his hands
The ship dropped out of hyperspace. Čarobnjačkom loomed before them. It looked just as it did when he left fifteen years ago. He remembered watching the planet disappear behind them as the Jedis flew them away. While the planet hadn’t changed, he sure had. Harry was no longer that helpless little boy. He was a skilled Jedi Knight. He was not helpless. Not anymore.
” he said, chuckling softly, “
The other man nodded. “Yes, he was Draco’s,” he said, “His companion. Until they were five, I took care of and educated the pair of them.” A wistful smile graced Severus’ harsh features. “They were thick as thieves. Until Lucius found out.” The smile melted to a scowl as anger danced in those lavender eyes. “’It wouldn’t do for a prince to be so close to a Nečista Stvorenje’ he had said. And then, Harry had been sold away.” Severus shook his head, closing his eyes as if pained. “I tried to find him, but nothing came of it. It’s impossible to track down someone that the society doesn’t consider to be a person, without a name or any kind of identification. Sure, all transactions involving Nečista Stvorenje were documented, but in the files, there is no way to tell one Nečista Stvorenje from another. Even Sirius tried, but even with the resources of the Crown Prince could we find anything.”
“Alright, I am Dr Severus Snape,” the man answered, “Not a medical doctor. I earned doctorates in politics and biology on Coruscant. I was Consort to …” He swallowed thickly, pain etched into face. “… to Prince Sirius Black of
“Do you have the list of supplies?” Cas asked Hadrian as he headed into the bathroom.
He walked his horse forward, eyebrow arched. “What are you doing?” he asked.
Cas motioned for the elf to bring them tea
Cas chuckled. “Maybe,” he answered, “Want to know?”
“Bill’s a cursebreaker in Egypt and Charlie works with dragons in Romania.” George replied leaning back against the seat. Hadrian hummed and Draco rolled his eyes.
“And I’m George. We’re Weasleys but we’re nothing like the rest of our families.” Said the other
” was all he said before Karkaroff started to address the hall.
Draco watched the procession walk down the hatch for a moment, then he looked at Severus. He held out the items to the older man. “Could you …?” he asked, tilting his head towards the team.
Draco stepped forward, grabbing the other man. “Harry, breathe,” he muttered. But that did not seem like it was helping. He pulled the man against his chest. “Come on, Harry, breathe with me. Match my breaths.” He exaggerated his breathing, and slowly, the other man calmed.
That plan seemed successful for all of a minute. Then the angry shouting started. She must have broken through the silencing charms on the door. Draco apparently needed stronger ones.
“Mr. Hadrian Mort is here to access his account. It’s under the name Harry Potter and for some odd reason was not changed when I adopted young Hadrian. An oversight of course, right.” His father’s voice was cold and emotionless and Hadrian kept his face schooled to a bored, emotionless look as well.

With a faint chuckle, Draco slipped through the mostly empty corridors. It was early, only a few servants around to see him. The chief gave him some bread and cheese, wrapped up in a cloth. He returned to his quarters, knocking softly before entering.
The siblings continued down the streets until finally Draco held up a hand to Lyra to stop. They had reached the townhouse. It was on the end of a row of houses that belonged to various courtiers. Draco hopped down from his horse, then went to help Lyra. The pair tied their horses up to the fence and climbed the stairs.
After hanging up on Draco, Hermione freaked out. Harlan was hurt. Harlan was unconscious on Draco’s ship. Harlan, who was supposed to be on a recruiting mission, had been Draco’s bodyguard to Čarobnjačkom. Oh Ovinnik, what should she do?
no matter what anyone says. With or without permission, I am leaving Coruscant.” Attendents, both his and the Chancellor’s, swarmed around him and tried to keep up with his long strides.
“Destri.” His matchbox morphed as well and when it was done he had a small metal box that had three overlapping infinity signs carved into the top. When he opened it moonlight sonata started to play. Quietly he closed it and smiled.
Harry stood proud and tall amongst the tittering crowd. The man was settling into his position well. His family signet ring glinted on his finger as he talked. His black hair was pulled back into a ponytail, showing off his strong jawline. His clothing, new ones that Draco had commissioned, fit perfectly and accentuated his body. A granite gray duvet over a black shirt hugged and showed of his broad and powerful shoulders. Dark green velvet pants melted over the toned lines of his legs to fall into black riding boots. Harry was a sharp contrast to his companion, the Lady Luna, Draco’s rather eccentric cousin. She was the bastard daughter of the bastard younger brother of the King. Some questioned why she was there at court, though not very loudly. Draco and Lyra loved her and liked having her around. And, more importantly, so did the Queen. Today, Luna was wearing a pure
, Harlan. Just Harlan, no last name. It took several months before he opened up to me, so shy. Quiet. Scared.”
The ships in front of him disappeared while Draco marveled at Cadmus, having slipped into the cave landing bay. He followed their lead and carefully brought his ship in. Cave was a generous title. The landing pad was nestled under an overcropping. Buildings were built up and on the ledge of bedrock. The hospital was right near the opening.
“And I was her sister!” she yelled, startling everyone. Even Draco’s parents. And Lyra emerged from her book. Miracles could happen, apparently. “But that didn’t stop her from ruining my life!”
. It was hard to wrap his head around. That the sweet, demour child became the stunning Jedi Knight he met on the flight over to
Draco walked along the narrow stretch of sand between the cliffs and the waves. The castle was only just visible, sitting on the cliffs with the waves crashing below. The moon shone down on him, big and bright.
I hope you liked it!!
The man’s bright green eyes light up. “You’re from England as well?” he prodded as he plopped into the seat, “It’s so nice to meet someone from home. I’m Harry.” He stuck out his hand.
Cas bit back a groan. This was torture. The blond man was killing him. Pulling away a bit, he turned around to face the man. Lucius was smirking, of course he was. The man was getting exactly what he wanted. Lucius pulled him closer, their bodies flush. Cas let the man.
The pair was brought out of their discussion by screaming. Not shouts of celebration, like before, but bloodcurdling shrieks of terror. Up ahead, tied upside down to posts, were a family of muggles, assumedly the caretaker of the land and his family. All died; their blood draining to the ground from wounds at the neck. Floating in the sky above the gruesome scene was the Morsmordre.
Draco gave her a death glare. That underhanded move was very Slytherin. He unfortunately had to give her that and grudgingly admitted that he approved of its Slytherin qualities.
“I need to use your floo. I must call Albus Dumbledore.” She practically shouted at Tom, the barkeeper. He nodded dumbly and she pushed past him and towards the fireplace.
~ because I do not speak the language and do not trust Google Translate
“That is not a conversation I wish to have in public. Do you remember that cottage you found, the one we were going to run off to before you learned of your betrothal?” Cas said
Harlan stepped around Draco and headed towards the light. “I’ll check to make see if the coast is clear,” the Knight stated, “and give us some cover. You two head quickly for the ship.” Draco nodded.
The older man laughed. “
Remus shook his head at the memories. “He told me he made the name Harlan for himself, drawing upon the name his childhood nickname.” He looked down at the young man with soft eyes. “When he passed the Jedi Trials, he gave himself the last name ‘Wolfe’, after me.” He chuckled softly, glancing up at Severus. “Harlan thought it was hilarious, because I’m a Lupyne. I was both touched and exasperated with the boy. I rolled my eyes at him and messed up his hair. Then I pulled him into a hug and told him I was proud of him.”
"Dear Mr. Mort. We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. Term begin on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31. Yours sincerely, Minerva McGonagall. Can I really go? It's not a trick?" Hadrian asked looking up at his father and Cas chuckled
, accented with yellow flowered details. Harry had a feeling Narcissa had a hand in that.
“Oops,” Hermione said, blushing. It had not occurred to her to think of the time on Coruscant when she called. She filed away the rest of what Remus had said for later. Someone else had interrupted his sleep? Who? She was so curious, but now was not the time. “I’m sorry, but this couldn’t wait until morning.”
“You two should probably go. We wouldn’t want Dumbledore to get suspicious.” Draco said and Hadrian heard the twins slip out the compartment. There was a long time where Hadrian stared out the window at the passing countryside. Once again, their peace was interrupted when the compartment door flew open.
“Probably. I haven’t talked to them in a few weeks. They’ll be glad I finally made a friend who’s not undead or an animal.” He said and Draco nodded. Hadrian often made calls to the underworld using a special potion and salt water. His father had never kept the fact that his parents were dead a secret and, though they had a problem with Cas at first, his parents were just happy to be able to see him grow up.
he answered. They both shared another laugh.
‘Anything but Gryffindor. Please, not Gryffindor.' Hadrian thought
“Harry, this is my sister, Princess Lyra,” Draco said, waving his hand at her, “Lyra, this is Harry.”
Draco woke up to loud banging on his bedroom door. He blurrily opened one of his eyes and squinted angrily at the bright sunshine sneakily peaking out from under the heavy drapes across the windows. He did not want to get up. Today was not a day he wanted to face. Maybe if he was quiet, she would go away.
As the pounding starts again, I remember why I was awoken. I gently lift Tia up and resettle her in the chair with a blanket tucked around her. She just snuggles into the warmth I left in the chair, still sound asleep. I walk to the door and open it, blinking in the blinding sunlight. There, on our doorstep stands Kingsley Shacklebolt, Head Auror and Harry's boss.
Finding Dobbeson took longer than Draco expected, but eventually, after searching through two floors, he found the old man up in the attic. They made their way back down to the study. Draco opened the door and looked around.
Draco changed out of his ceremonial clothes and put away his crown. There was no way in
Harry ducked his head, subtly leaning into the affectionate touch. He thought of the other Knight like a father, and he knew the man thought of him as a son. “I am alright,” he muttered.
Shacklebolt watched the young senator for a moment before shaking his head in defeat. “Since you seem set on this infernal course of action, at least take protection with you,” he said before turning to the Jedi master, “Master McGonagall, could I possibly request a Jedi Knight to accompany Senator Malfoy?”
Remus could plainly see the guilt written on the man’s face. “Severus,” he said softly, wishing he was close enough to touch the other man, “It was not your fault.”
“Yeah, does that go along with stealing godsons?” He said, his well-known temper rearing its head.
The group chuckled at that.
* I have attention issues and get bored easily. So, I have been working on all of my different stories at the same time (not writing full chapters, but still progressing all of them)
So I have about seven more chapters planned (six and then an epilogue) right now. Maybe one more, if I feel like the story needs it. =)
“Of course Lord Mort. Anything for you Lord Mort.”
Lyra nodded, picking up a book from the table and getting comfortable on the chaise. “You go do that,” she replied, “I know you won’t let it go until you figure it. Have fun.” She waved him off, already lost in the pages.
A Slytherin acting sweet and innocent was never to be trusted. They were almost always up to no good. It was better just do as they ask because they would turn nasty when disobeyed. That was why Draco pushed the covers back and got out of the comfy heaven of his king-size bed. I stood up and stretched, feeling the snug cotton of his boxer briefs shift the movement.
Once the young Knight was gone, Master Flitwick turned to McGonagall. “You did not tell Harlan he would be going back to Čarobnjačkom,” he noted, “This could be very traumatic to the man.”
Draco grumbled to himself as he made his way back to the changing rooms. He had just completed his obligatory schmoozing with the Starbucks’ bigwigs. Now, all he wanted was to shower and take a nap. He was physically, emotionally, and mentally drained. And, on top of that, he would have another race to complete in ten days’ time. In Utah, of all places. But there were fans all along his walk down. Thus, he buried his annoyance and exhaustion under a charismatic smile and powered through.
He could hear Severus sigh. “That Jedi Knight, Harlan Wolfe, is one of the most powerful Jedis to pass the Trials in centuries,” he said.
Draco had already been frustrated with how things were on Čarobnjačkom, and that story increased his anger and determination. They should not be allowed to treat people as they do. That was when he made the decision that he was going to change everything. And well, he aimed high. The last six years, he had been working, pushing, and gaining support for his anti-slavery bill. He did not have the support in Čarobnjačkom for that, but there were other systems that did. If he could not change his planet, then he would change the galaxy.
Draco smiled wistfully at the memory. Harry was the greatest best friend Draco could have. We were nearly inseparable during those years. The other boy had such a connection to animals. Harry showed Draco many creatures as they grew up. Draco thought he wanted to follow his parents' footsteps and become a beast tamer. Already, he was able to influence some of the more dangerous creatures not to attack us.
“I thought you lost that gift. I thought you weren’t a seer anymore.” Lucius said softly. Cas looked down into his teacup,
The grand doors opened, and there stood Lyra.
The younger students started clapping immediately, the older ones soon joining in. The pair pulled off their golden robes with a flourish, sinking into deep curtsies. When they rose up, green and blue badges were seen on their black robes. They made their way to their respective houses as an ancient wizard walked up to greet Karkaroff.
* Life is stressful and getting a teaching credential is a lot of busywork/project

, sitting to put on his shoes. The Knight blushed as he made eye contact with Hermione.
- . x . X . x . -
“I see a promising friendship between those two.” Lucius said, proudness evident in his voice.
Draco was pulled from his panic by the sound of a lightsaber engaging. He looked over to see Harlan next to him, wielding his indigo lightsaber. The Knight must have come back to them while Draco was frozen with panic.
Draco smiled, leaning against the doorframe. It was a wonderful, touching moment. He felt privileged to be a part of it, even if only from the sidelines. His Harry was slowly coming to accept his new place in life, and this reunion was a large jump in the right direction for them to be together.
Harry swallowed thickly. “Yes, we do.”
Harry nodded, following Draco out of the room and through the halls to the stables. His black stallion was waiting there in the courtyard next to a Knabstrupper stallion, the brother to Lyra’s mare. A gift for Harry, though the man does not know that yet. Draco planned for it to be an engagement present, just as soon as he proposed.
Draco sighed. “Yes,” he answered, tipping his head back to look at Hadrian, “Have you heard from your father?”
Draco watched as Harry climbed the stairs of the platform. The man took the axe from the executioner, weighing it in his hands. Draco smirked; there was a reason he requisitioned an axe for this instead of the standard sword. Harry had been raised a laborer, so an axe was more natural in his hand than a sword.
customs: Harry had firsthand experience, observing it play out many times. It all made sense. Except one thing. Why didn’t Harry, or Harlan, tell him? Why not say he was Draco’s childhood friend?
Draco cleared his throat to regain the Dursleys’ attention. Their eyes snapped away from Harry to focus on Draco. He arched an eyebrow at them, hoping to silently spur them into changing their answer. When the look did nothing, he spoke, “Well?”
“Comiiing!” came the answer from one bedrooms, the one closest to the top of the stairs.
Harry had only two words in his mind when he bellowed the spell. The two words he had seen in his potions book describing the spell, describing its use. Better said, describing for what kind of situation it was meant to be used in, or yet, for what kind of person.
Harry looked sideways at him and laughed. “Okay, I’ll remember that.”
That actually gave Draco an idea. So in the next day in the morning Draco wrote a message to Harry through their way of communication. It was a two-way piece of parchment in which everything that was written in one piece would appear in the other. They actually had Hermione to thank for that, since Harry got the idea from remembering what she had done with some coins in some club they held the previous year, Harry would get too much into what that club was about, or into anything, for that matter. Potter just wasn’t much of a talker. Well, not with Draco, it seemed.
Snape thought gravely before answering. “No. But he certainly must think I am. Him and everyone else.”
Draco thought.
“What do you mean?”
Scorpius’s matter-of-fact tone made the impact of his words even bigger. Harry and Draco were stupefied, looking from their son to each other with silly smiled on their faces.
“That’s fair, I guess.”
The train arrived in Hogsmead station and Harry had already been in his school robes for more than an hour. This was a first. He planned on leaving the train as soon as it stopped and getting on one of the first carriages to the castle. He was decided that he wasn’t meeting Draco when he was on his way to the castle, walking or getting his trunk out of the compartment or something like that; he knew himself well enough to know that in those situations he was bound to be clumsy and make a fool of himself.
“Good,” Harry agreed.
“I don’t know. Maybe the wound from the Sectumsempra spell you cast at me in our sixth year.”
, right? Not necessarily what we
“I don’t know, Harry, I think I need some time to think about it,” said Hermione and left.
“Did he tell you?”
“What?” he asked.
House, I don’t even know what I’d say,” Harry said one time to Draco as they were lying in bed together, Draco on his back and Harry on top of him with his head on Draco’s chest. “I guess I’d just laugh until I couldn’t breathe and die.”
“Make it midnight.”
So on the last day in Hogwarts, when Harry, Ron and Hermione were on top of the astrology tower talking about what the future held for them, Harry knew that was the moment.
“Oh, because you do? You care about people, Malfoy?” Harry raised himself a little more to almost sit. “You dad,” his voice was raising its tone, “is a
Draco’s heart skipped a beat at the name. “What about him?” He asked trying to pretend he didn’t care that much.
Harry thought,
“Apparently some already has. A love potion, because you’ve been obsessed with me for more than five years now. You really can’t go five minutes without thinking about me, now do you?” Malfoy seemed a little taken aback and… hurt by that. Too soon, maybe? Harry thought.
“Nothing,” she said, “you’re right, that was a sweet move.” A mass of black-robed students was getting ever nearer. “Let’s go already,” Hermione added pushing Ron to the carriage behind the one Draco was standing by.
The hours went by and many times during classes Harry caught himself thinking of the note and the message it brought. And whether he would attend to the meeting.
Just some months, and then Draco would be back at Hogwarts. He did go back to Hogwarts in his seventh year, but it was pretty late into the term and his father kept calling him back home for meetings and stuff like that and Draco would always stay up to a week of something. So Draco was barely having classes properly, and even when he did, there wasn’t really much to learn in classes with teachers being threatened constantly of punishment if they said anything slightly against the regime in the school at the time. So Draco was going back for an eight year, to finish his studies.
“I did, yes,” said Harry timidly.
about being his father’s son, about being in the path of becoming Voldemort’s follower. That, of course, was not the case, and everyone noticed it. Draco knew his father was ashamed of the son he had, even if he didn’t say anything to Draco.
“And that’s not all, that
“You’ve been avoiding me?” Harry asked airily. “Yeah, okay. Let’s do this.”
“Sometimes I think about that day. It feels like a reminder sometimes. That bad situation don’t mean anything. A situation might seem impossible to get worse, but then it can suddenly turn into a very good thing. Like it did. How about you?”
“What’re you reading, Scorps?” Draco asked as he entered the room where Scorpius was. It was a large room that had suffered the most changes. It used to be dark with no windows. Not it had a huge window that covered most of the wall that faced the street. The furniture was also changed – it now had a sofa, an armchair, a little table and shelves filled with books.
“Ah, Draco,” Snape said when Draco entered the office. He scrutinized Draco, analyzing him from head to toe. Like he wasn’t certain what to make of the boy.
“Yeah,” Draco agreed.
“So what you’re trying to say is…” Draco started.
Harry had never seen his friend like that. He could tell that she was restraining from using less pleasant words by the way she spoke through gritted teeth.
After all, he could not be connected emotionally with Malfoy, could he? Malfoy, who insulted him and his friends tirelessly for over five years. “I never liked doing it, you know?” he once said when they were dressing themselves in Draco’s room. He had that annoying habit of trying to make conversation in those moments when all Harry wanted to do was go away as fast as possible from there. Malfoy could say what he wanted, Harry didn’t believe for a second. The insults and attempts at trying to get Harry expelled felt genuine enough, so unless Malfoy was a great actor, that sounded like bullshit. Harry pretended he hadn’t heard and Malfoy dropped the subject.
“I don’t…” Draco begin, but stopped talking and just stayed there, on the ground, crying.
“I like this.”
tone.
By the end of the first month of the school year it was out and clear that Harry and Draco were together. They were out and proud homosexuals and extremely happy to be homosexuals together. It was so liberating to spend time in their free time, to go for walks, to stay for hours lying in the grass together, eventually stealing one or two kisses.
, he told himself right after, as if it had been other person who had had the first thought and now he was making sure that that person wouldn’t speak out of turn.
Harry thought for the umpteenth time as he crept in to his room, praying that none of his roommates would wake up. They didn’t. They were all fast asleep.
“What?”
“Yeah, but I did it for the wrong reasons.”
That only made his being locked indoors worse. Impossibly, he felt even more desperate to leave the Dursleys’. He pictured himself leaving the house in many different ways. He imagined Dumbledore arriving and telling he’d take Harry somewhere else; or Ron once again showing up in his dad’s Ford Anglia by his bedroom window to rescue him; or even he simply sneaking out and running away.
What they had was so precious. It was really something to make you feel blessed. Their being naked wasn’t erotic. They had sex, yes, but many times they would be lying in bed together totally naked without sex even crossing their minds. It wasn’t about sex, it was about the intimacy. It was about knowing that there was nothing to hide. Even more than not having anything to hide, it was
So the weeks went on, Harry determined not to let this insane idea – whatever that idea was – get any of his waking thoughts kept pushing it aside.
And there he was, the great Harry Potter, not looking great at all. Sprawled on the train floor, petrified. At Draco’s mercy. He wanted to shove it in his face, shove it all in his face, all the glory he’d achieve, the validation, the admiration. He wanted Potter to see all that. To feel as powerless before Draco as he was just right now, incapable of moving.
“Hello?” Harry called, since it was dark. As it turns out, the enchantment that makes the candles light up when there’s movement close also makes them go out when there’s quietude for a while, and after some minutes Draco had grown quite fond of the darkness and extinguished the fires with a wave of his wand whenever some lit up due to some movement he made.
Aboard the Hogwarts express, Harry was silently praying no one would ask about Draco. He was trying to play it cool and seem like he was casual about it, but inside he felt like beginning to shake with… he didn’t even know with what – nervousness, anxiousness, shyness – all of those combined.
to be welcomed. That sure granted him some success amidst the Slytherin, his House praised those who had the guts to claim their grandiosity shamelessly. The Slytherin sure despised the prudes and hypocrites who pursued glory only to, having attained it, act like they never wanted it.
are we doing
Harry was taken aback. “What? Why?”
“Then why the question?”
That had been their last class of the day. Harry mumbled something about not having slept much the last night and wanting to go to his room and take a nap for the rest of the evening. That was just an excuse to be alone. He couldn’t stand himself, so disgusted and ashamed that he was with the dawn of realization of what he’d been doing for the last weeks. He could barely keep a straight face to hide that he was lost in thoughts and dwelling with his shame.
arrive late if he takes too much longer.”
“A plan,” Draco wondered about that idea.
Harry got himself thinking one night. He clearly wasn’t gonna be able to go through his mission of killing Dumbledore. He had lowered his wand. He gave up, he wasn’t gonna do it. Did he know Snape was coming to make up for his failure?
“Come, Harry, just ignore him,” she said and, grabbing Harry’s arm, took off and banged Malfoy hard on the shoulder with her own, Ron went by Hermione’s side. As Harry passed Draco he saw him mouth “
Crabbe and Goyle entered the room at that moment – of course they had been one of those that went home in the first opportunities when things started to get ugly the night before, but they had come back to pack their things and take them home. Everyone was doing so, since they left in a hurry with nothing more than what they had on their bodies – talking excitedly about what they’d be doing during summer.
“It was the time of the duel you challenged me to in our first year,” Harry said with a grin.
So Draco couldn’t take it anymore. Being in that house had never been a pleasant experience, but of late if had become Draco’s own personal hell. A constant reminder of the destiny they had reserved for him, the one he preferred to die than uphold, however, the one he was being forced to fulfill.
Harry thought of what he should say. He did have to say something, right? He had to. But would Draco want to hear it? Would he even give Harry the benefit of the doubt?
He had found himself on the corridor of Myrtle’s bathroom and before he knew, he was walking towards it. He’d noticed the door was ajar and in the last second, just before he pushed it wide open, he had heard voices inside, which had brought him out of his boredom stupor; also, not Myrtle’s voice, which had made him pay attention to it. He had looked through the gap and saw that the coast was clear, he could open the door a little wider and sneak in, it was possible to stay hidden at the side of the closest stall. He did just that and listened. Draco’s voice, whining like a child with a broken toy.
And rest he did not. Not for one second did Harry stop thinking about Draco. Trying to figure out what he meant when he said those things to Myrtle became Harry’s obsession. What could it mean? Besides, of course, the obvious meaning. But no, that couldn’t be it… could it? No. There had to be other explanation.
“Yeah… I… Please don’t ask?” Harry said embarrassed.
Chaos reigned in the place. Spells being thrown at each other, missing and hitting toilet seats, breaking pipes, making water spill all over the place, breaking holes through the wooden walls of the stalls. All missing the targets by inches. Until the final blow.
What would he even say to Harry anyway? It doesn’t matter, Harry wouldn’t listen to him anyway. He never had, anyway.
“And are you loyal to him?”
“God, Hermione, what’s up with you?” Harry asked.
“And he actually asked me to say sorry to you, now that I come to think of it,” Harry said as if he just remembered it.
“It’s okay, come here,” said Draco as he sat on the bed and padded on the spot to his side indicating for Scorpius to sit there. Scorpius sat. “I know it’s scary. I was scared as hell when I was your age. But hear this from someone who was been on your shoes: you have nothing to worry about. Really, you don’t. Everything will be fine. You’re probably afraid you won’t make any friends. Or feeling some pressure because of the fame of your father…” Draco said that a little bit like a question, like a suggestion.
Harry let out a short laugh. “Is that so?” he said, amused.
“Nevermind. It’s just…” Draco’s words trailed off. “My Dad and all.” He concluded.
“What do you mean?” Ron asked.
“Where’d you even get–” Draco started but was interrupted by the surprise of Harry strength as he turned Draco’s body around. Draco complied and laid face down, waited a few second that he supposed were dedicated to the adjustment of the condom and then felt Harry’s body touch his again.
“No, it’s not that. I’m glad you’re coming with me. It’s just… it’s…” Harry inhaled deeply. Exhaled. “It’s something that… happened. I want you to know that because I want to be honest. With you and with myself. And I want that to stay in the past. So I’ll tell you and there’ll be no secrets between us.”
Harry tells Ron and Hermione about what happened between him and Draco.
They went to the spot they liked to go to by the tree near the entrance to the castle and sat on the ground, as they usually did. Hermione was still about to explode with rage.
“In there?” asked Harry.
“Draco, I understand it must have been very frustrating for you what Dumbledore told you.”
“Wow, that was… deep. I don’t know, I was kinda expecting something more like your House mascot or something,” Harry said. They laughed at this. After a moment of thinking, Harry continued, “Well, the word of that spell – Sectumsempra – comes from
After greeting Draco, Goyle asked, “How ‘bout you, Draco? What’re you gonna do?”
Then there was a feeling of silence. At least, the sounds of water flowing out of the open pipes and onto the poodles on the floor felt like silence compared to the turbulence that was happening moments ago.
Was the thought in Draco’s mind as he lied in bed.
Noticing Harry and Draco were together was no hard task. That had been one of the first things they discussed in their nightly meetings. They had come to the conclusion that they could take things easy and see how it turned out. They wouldn’t, of course, announce it, but they also wouldn’t particularly
Harry laughed. “No, but it’s fun to.”
Draco let himself blush and enjoy Harry calling him by his name before speaking. “I know you do. I know you do. But let’s keep it a secret for now. That’s me who’s asking. Okay?”
sorry. I really am. I understand that you’re upset.”
On top of all that, once Draco had started playing that role he didn’t have much of a choice, did he? Once he starts he got caught in the role and if he just stopped insulting the famous Harry Potter people would find it odd, and that could risk the whole thing falling apart, his father “guidance”, so to speak, even his relation with his family, which wasn’t the healthiest.
He tried not to think too much about that as he tried to fall asleep.
Then came the day at the Astrology Tower. Draco understood nothing. He was the most confused and frightened he’d ever been. Things were getting serious. Dumbledore was about to be killed. Draco couldn’t see how Snape was going to save the Headmaster, if they didn’t do something soon the Death Eaters would arrive and make sure the deed was done. All Professor Snape told Draco when he went for him was to trust him. Dumbledore being mysterious was no surprise, but Draco wasn’t expecting the same from Snape. Trust him. Trust them.
Draco wondered while packing his clothes.
,” Draco repeated more emphatically. “Just shut the fuck up, will you? You’ll see in a moment. Now hush and not a peep until we get there.” And without another word he started walking away, Harry hurried to follow. The last thing he wanted was to be left alone in the Malfoy’s house.
“What is it, Malfoy?” Harry asked expecting, Draco realized, to receive insults.
No one said anything during a half second. Everyone was a little too confused to say anything. Harry was panting half bending, one arm on his thigh for support, the other holding his nose. Draco was panting on the ground, putting his elbows beneath him so that he could look at Harry; rage burning in his face. He slowly began to stand up, holding his ribs with a hand, his enraged expression giving place to pain.
. It was like an arguing inside his head.
“Hey, Potter,” Harry heard Malfoy’s voice say and lifted his view from his backpack he’d been rummaging to see Draco standing there in the hallway. “heard you are very good at Potions now, what happened? Finally found your brain?
tons of things to settle.”
“We could play pretend,” said Draco one day, some weeks later, in their usual third-floor-corridor-meeting.
“Jesus, Harry. Morbid much?” Draco exclaimed, but he was laughing.
to have anything with me after… after all that and everything.”
Another moment of silence.
Later that day they met, as Harry, Ron and Hermione were leaving Potions class.
Each time Harry looked at Scorpius, the sight of the kid reminded him of how much he loved Draco, how blessed he felt to have him in his life and how lucky he was to be able to build a family with him. It also reminded him of how much he loved Scorpius, too, of course. Harry loved that little adorable thing so much and in a whole different way to the way he loved Draco, so his heart hurt from both things. It was really just an overwhelming feeling of being luckier than one deserves. So Harry thanked the gods, the cosmos, Merlin, whoever was there to thank for being so blessed.
“Fuck. You. Potter. You think you know everything, don’t you. It’s so easy for you.” He was once again speaking in a half-shout, but this time through his teeth. “FUCK. YOU. I can’t do ANYTHING. I HAVE to do what I’m told, and I can’t do anything of what I really want. Do you have any idea what that’s like?”
Draco was already at the door and Snape called him.
Coincidentally, he didn’t run into any professor. He did find himself in the corridor of Myrtle’s bathroom. Harry stopped a little abruptly at the sight of the bathroom door, remembering the last time he was in that situation and what had followed. That precise memory was what drew him to the bathroom once again, making him feel that Draco would be inside. He came close to the door and sure enough, heard Malfoy’s and Myrtle’s voices.
At that moment, Malfoy had managed to stand. “Same place,” he said faintly and starting to make back to the castle, bumping hard – or as hard as he could – into Harry’s shoulder.
But now he was tired. He didn’t want to go on with all that. It was tiring – exhausting – and nonsensical. So he avoided Harry at all costs. Until he was surprised as he turned a corner in an empty hallway and bumped into someone.
The scary feeling peeked around the corner, almost threatening to show up fully. But it was different now, the scary feeling seemed to only make the love more intense. “How can I love you so much that it feels like I’m might just explode?” Draco said.
They left the last class before lunch. Harry said he was going to his dorm before heading to the great hall. Walking alone in the hallways, he realized his feet were automatically leading him to the third floor. He walked on still unsure if he should go…
noise as its bone returned to its correct shape.
Ron and Hermione got out of their carriage and rejoined with Harry.
“Draco, Dumbledore couldn’t be saved. If he hadn’t been killed that night, he’d die weeks later from a curse he received when he wore an enchanted ring. His death was part of a plan.”
Draco stopped. They were both standing still in the middle of a hallway. Draco realized that that was an opportunity he probably wouldn’t have again, to have Harry alone. “C… Can we talk?” He asked speaking fast.
“Are you planning on telling him?”
“But it’s really okay,” Draco said. “No hard feelings. I get it, actually.”
“Personal
“I don’t know, okay!?” Harry answered in a snap, accidentally rude. “Just let me alone for a while. Please. I need to think.”
,” he raised his head to look at Draco, their noses almost touching, “
. What was Malfoy gonna do? Harry took off his cloak. “You could teach me a thing or two about sneaking around.” That made Malfoy shudder with fright, too, since he had his back turned to Harry when Harry began to speak.
Harry inflicted a reasonable respect in the students in general, especially in Gryffindors, and Ravenclaws seemed to not have anything against him. Hufflepuffs in general were just really appreciative of their courage and seemed happy to see them happy. And Draco’s former reputation inside Slytherin seemed to still stand at some level, because the Slytherins in general didn’t bother him and when one tried, the scene with Julie was the usual result, so they were quick to realize that trying was most certainly embarrassing themselves and gave up.
His plan worked out, Ron and Hermione were probably still in the library, where they said they were going to when Harry had excused himself earlier. Harry ate hurriedly and strolled around the castle looking for a place to go and to be to pass the time. He didn’t want to go back to his room, he didn’t want to be in an enclosed space, plus, Ron or some of his other roommates would soon turn up there. He went to the top of the astronomy tower and gladly having a vast landscape to look at calmed him more than he thought it would. He stayed there for a while, looking at the sky, watching the treetops sway with the wind, birds eventually flying from some tree into some unknown destiny. He felt calm again, his distress was lessened hugely.
He thought.
“Yeah, I’m fine. Aren’t you going to storm off, too?”
” Harry started to scream and Draco quickly threw an Imperturbable Charm on the door. “HE WORKS FOR VOLDEMORT.”
“Yes, I guess it’s complicated, because I can’t understand. Harry, how could you be with him, he hates us. He hates you. He insults you and your family all the time. Your parents, too. He tried to get you expelled. What about that, huh? You’re okay with that?” Hermione said. Ron was quiet all this while.
“Oh,” said Ron.
Draco was super unsure at first when the girl first approached them, but Harry’s relaxed way of dealing with it made him calmer. He knew what she was doing, too. She would look for whoever was the easiest target; Harry already showed himself to not be the one, so she now turned to Draco. He wouldn’t give her the pleasure. Draco opened a pleased grin, like she had just told him a joke.
“That is. None. Of your. Business.” He pushed Harry again, harder this time. “I have things to do, important things. You wouldn’t understand. I bet
Harry was starting to get amused. Internally he was starting to laugh his friends to were taking the bait of these fake provocations. But before his amusement could grow he realized, and just a second before she spoke, too, that Hermione was fuming with rage.
“Nothing, it’s just… you didn’t call me by my surname.”
Draco went back to the door frame of the room and called “Hey, honey?” to the kitchen. “Yes?” came Harry’s answer. “Come here! And bring some tea, why don’t you?” Draco said. A minute later Harry arrived with a tray with tea for the three. Scorpius was in the armchair, so Harry and Draco accommodated themselves in the sofa.
” and shrugged clumsily in response as he was pulled further by Hermione tight grip.
Hermione on the other hand, had a worried expression. “Harry, what is it?”
Snape’s expression showed relief. Apparently he was still uncertain of whether Draco was there on his own account or of his father’s.
Those months of break had Harry with mixed feelings. For the first time he left Harry and didn’t need to go to the Dursleys’, he went straight to the Burrow, something he dreamed of doing for all of the six years of his studies. Not going back to the Dursleys’ was happiness enough, but he still had more reasons for cheerfulness – he was with his best friend Ron and his family, the Weasleys, that always welcomed him wholeheartedly and made him feel part of the family. On top of
“Oh.” Harry was a tad surprised to hear an eleven-year-old wizard speak so matter-of-factly about Hogwarts Houses. Usually this a topic made the youngsters anxious.
The conversation he, Ron and Hermione heard between Draco and Borgin was the beginning of the proof that Malfoy was involved in Dark Arts, but it wasn’t quite that yet, so he needed to have the confession so that the rage he’d been nurturing towards Malfoy could be explained. He need a confession from Malfoy to explain his urge to punch Malfoy in the face to make it clear that that was the only reason for him to even be thinking about Malfoy in the first place, not something else.
It was starting to get late and he remembered that he would have inevitably to go back to his room eventually. He lingered at the tower for a while longer but eventually he left; it was less than twenty minutes until curfew. Harry still didn’t make straight to Gryffindor tower, he took some detours, wandered around the castle as time went by. Eventually curfew time was upon him but he decided not to stress about it and if some professor caught him out of his room he’d say he had lost track of time and was already on his way.
, Malfoy,” Hermione broke the silence. “That’s it. Harry, we’re gonna report him, he can’t get out of that one, they’ll
Draco had thought,
anxious to meet Harry and forget this topic for more than five minutes. Almost. Looking out the window he tried to let his thoughts wander freely and drift far away so that he wouldn’t need to actually think about anything, but every few minutes he’d remember where he was. A train compartment. The train was the Hogwarts Express. In that same train was Harry. Harry. Draco sighed for the millionth time.
Already in the corner, he decided he couldn’t be too careful and just stayed there. He could hear them from this spot and it was strangely dark here, so they wouldn’t be able to see some accidental ankle that might escape the cloak. He pressed his back against the wall and heard as Draco’s steps drew farther away, then he peeked to check and saw that Snape was, too, moving back to the party. Harry turned to his position pressing his back against the wall and tried to make sense of what he’d heard. Somethings were clear enough, some were confirmations of what Harry already suspected, some would need some deliberations with Ron and Hermione.
“Or what? You’re gonna make a potion to get me?” Malfoy mocked, but Harry saw a twinkle in his eyes that signaled to him that that was just what they had agreed to doing. That actually made Harry lighten up a bit, he decided that he could take some fun out of this.
“Oh, my god, Harry you do compete with Ron on having the emotional range of a teaspoon sometimes,” Hermione said but she was laughing.
“I’m sorry that you have that fear,” Harry said when they parted. “I know that it must be hard for you to not have it. I mean, I didn’t make things very easy, have I?” He laughed guiltily.
“Where the fuck…” Harry’s voice trailed away.
He told his friends he was going to take a walk. He needed it badly. A nice calm walk, to take it all in. Everything was over – finally. But there had been
“Yeah, mate, just give up on trying to make us give up,” Ron said and he and Hermione laughed a little.
. That was the loneliest Draco had ever felt in his life. He never had any friends, Crabbe and Goyle were no more than stupid cronies that only followed him around. He never had any love from his parents. Being faithful to his father’s master was the only way he had of feeling like he belonged to… well,
His imaginations were many, but in all of them, before he knew it, Draco popped up at some point.
“What do you mean?” Harry asked.
“Nothing wrong with them, it’s just that I wanna be like you two.”
“Hey,” Harry said insecure as they lied down on Draco’s bed, “is it okay if we don’t, like, do anything? Just sleep?”
. I really felt for him. Oh don’t roll your eyes,” Harry added, but he was laughing. Hermione giggled too. “But seriously. I have a really hard time missing my parents. And I do because they give me strength. I aspire to be like them. And sometimes I think… how is it to not have your parents as role models. You know? What if you have your parents, but they are the reason you despise yourself. Isn’t that way worse? Isn’t he having a harder time than I am?”
Harry had already almost as good as forgotten about Draco when one day he felt a sweet humming in his backpack. His frown was not because he was confused as to what was the source of the humming, he knew exactly what it was, it had been his idea, after all. When there was a new message in the two way enchanted parchment he and Draco used to communicate, the parchment would produce a soft hum that was felt more than heard. Harry’s frown came from his confusion as to why was Malfoy using the parchment. What did he want? Was he really gonna call Harry for another meeting in the third floor corridor like nothing had happened? He could dream and hope all he wanted, but Harry was not going.
They didn’t talk in the days that followed. Harry’s mind was busy thinking about everything that happened. Dumbledore was dead. He could not believe it. He was always waiting for Dumbledore to appear and explain that his death was faked for some reason. He could not believe Dumbledore was gone. Last year he lost Sirius. Now Dumbledore. Would Harry loose everyone for whom he cared? Everyone that cared for him? He couldn’t help making a list of the people that cared about him. Hermione and Ron were to first to pop up, followed by Ron’s family. Mrs. Weasley, who said he was as good as a son for her, Mr. Weasley, Ginny, Fred and George. Professor Lupin came up, too.
“If you were to get a tattoo, what would it be?” Harry asked Draco one night, as they lay in bed, Harry lying on Draco’s chest, like usual.
“It’s different. I know I can talk to you. You’re my best friends. It’s no surprise to talk about these things with you. But it’s still difficult sometimes to be frank with myself about some things, you know?”
“I…” Draco stuttered. “I just walk fast I guess,” he finished feeling like he had just said the stupidest thing anyone could have said, in the stupidest way.
Harry, who was on top, had his left hand planted on the ground and with his right pulled Draco’s robes open and put his hands under Draco’s shirt. Draco at first shivered at the cold of Harry’s fingers, but their temperature quickly leveled and Draco enjoyed the touch of Harry’s hand on the bare skin of his hip and ribs and chest and back to the hip.
“I don’t know,” he said, then turning to Harry, “Are you?”
“Yeah right, you’ve grown tired of your father’s counseling, have you?”
The thought of having a child came some time after they started being a couple officially back in school and they had way more time to spend together, not needing to hide and the idea of spending the rest of their lives together became each day more imminent.
“Good,” Draco said.
On top of that, you had the terrible state in which Lucius’s reputation was amongst the Death Eaters after being a coward when Voldemort disappeared. Lucius wanted so bad to have a prodigy for a son, a son that would enter headfirst in Voldemort’s ideology and help Lucius’s reputation, that he ended up blaming Draco for his own failure, even if he himself wasn’t totally aware of doing so.
” and then waited staring intently at the parchment until he saw the sign that the message had been received. Soon a line appeared crossing the words and Draco waved his wand to wipe the ink out of the parchment.
“I have to admit, that was cute,” Ron said. Draco’s face got went from pale to red. Hermione laughed at Ron’s comment.
?” Draco felt his face getting red. “Am I…” he really –
, the whole country was in a festive climate because Voldemort had finally been defeated for good. Even though the reasons to be happy seemed endless, Harry caught himself being wistful and sad.
Ah, communicating with Harry. Draco didn’t stop thinking about Harry even for a minute. Harry represented warmth amidst the coldness of his house and parents, that’s why it was so easy to forget any hurt. Once again Draco had the scary thought that there was nothing Harry could do to make him stop wanting Harry.
“I disagree, Harry,” Draco said anyway. “You are so much better than you think.”
! How dared Harry to be having a secret affair with their archenemy? And
After Harry spoke, there was no more than a half second of hesitation in Draco’s eyes before he made forward and kissed Harry. Their lips were locked for a few second, and then they parted. Harry had an astonished face. Draco, too, had an expression of surprise, but mixed with fear. He grimaced a bit, as if waiting for Harry’s hand to fly in a punch right at his nose. Draco flinched when the movement came, but Harry’s hand flew to the back of Draco’s head and pulled it closer to his own head and then they were kissing again, in utter and entire passion. Draco put his hand on Harry’s waist and pulled their bodies together. Harry moved inches away from the wall, just enough for Draco to wrap his hand around him. They rolled to the side, now Draco had his back again the wall, and it was Harry’s chest was pressing against Draco’s while his hand never left Draco’s head and the other was grabbing Draco’s waist.
Until Professor Sloghorn’s Christmas party.
Hermione rolled her eyes at Harry, who laughed in response as they made their ways to their respective doors.
“Yeah,” Harry said. “But I’m not going to actually get a tattoo.”
Draco sees Harry and goes to confront him.
Harry was frozen in place. He then made one step toward Draco, wide-eyed, trying to figure out what he’d done. Froze again. He turned and ran for the door and almost smashed face first onto Snape. They looked at each other for a moment. Harry still wide eyed and dumbfounded. Snape looked around, saw the body, and rushed towards it, ignoring Harry completely. Harry then once again ran, and only stopped when he had arrived at the entrance to Gryffindor tower.
The girl was even more displeased to see that she wasn’t being able to get under their skins. On top of that, the rest of the class had, of course, heard the exchange and was now all looking at them and giggling at the rebukes. Fury started to build up on her face and she was opening her mouth to speak when other girl spoke from where she was sitting.
“Well, you’re doing a pretty good job talking about it now,” Ron said.
“I’m not sure either, but I think it’d be good to finish ‘em. And if we both came back next year, we’d have more time together.” Draco nudged Harry. They smiled.
Draco had no choice other than swallow his loneliness, bottle it and put it away. He has no choice other than follow the orders given to him. He went to Dumbledore once more, but the Headmaster was no clearer than he had been the first time, refusing to speak clearly, to give Draco any real information. So Draco kept his act – the only difference is that now Draco thought of it as an act. He wasn’t sure if there was any real difference, since he was doing nothing different. The only real direction Dumbledore had given him was “stay close to Professor Snape, he will aid you” whatever that meant.
“Huh?” was Harry’s answer.
year, his mind was too busy being occupied with homework to think about Draco.
“What? What is it?” Hermione asked.
“Oh, fuck off, will you?” Draco said as he let himself be pulled in to Harry embrace and received his warm kiss. “He has every right to be anxious, after all, doesn’t he?”
“We don’t need to make it public already,” Draco said seeing the nervousness in Harry’s face.
“Okay,” Draco said as he went to leave the kitchen.
Harry feels bad about having an affair with Draco who is hated by his friends;
Half an hour later, Harry was sending the owl to Hermione. The day after, the owl came back with her answer.
Harry did exactly what he did the last time: entered the bathroom silently and stayed hidden behind the stall closest to the door.
It didn’t say the time and place because that went without saying. Harry looked at the words for a while. What did Malfoy have to say to him? Sorry? Would Malfoy give him an empty apology? Would he demand one from Harry? Harry didn’t know. He tore the piece of parchment in two and watched the ink vanish, then he crumpled the pieces and threw them in the bin. The enchantment broke when the parchment was destroyed, but just for the sake of the action, he had thrown it away anyway.
“Thanks. Love you,” in an almost whisper. Draco couldn’t resist when Harry spoke like that. “But also hurry him,” Harry said once again on the Mother-Weasley-tone he grew to master over the years. “He
House. But they all connected the dots, even if subconsciously. They would never even try to get into Harry’s way for lots of reasons. One of them was that they were a tiny bit afraid of Harry; you don’t go crossing the path of the only person on Earth who was able to defeat Voldemort, and what was more, defeat him many times. It was that kind of fear that comes actually from respect; Harry’s classmates had a huge respect for him and there was a sort of feeling of letting him do whatever he wanted, since he saved all of their lives and that’s a debt they would never be able to pay. That feeling of respect worked wonders for Harry, even if he was unaware of it. Harry was very humble, never thought much of himself and tended to be oblivious to things in his surroundings, so he didn’t really realize people felt that way toward him. He also didn’t realize that his relationship with Draco was no longer a secret; people noticed it and the word spread. And people were okay with it. Harry (and Draco for that matter) still had their fears about how things would be if they disclosed their relationship publicly. They would discover they needn’t have.
Harry let a small laugh out. “I… wanted to say sorry. For the way I… treated you,” he finished the sentence almost like it was a question. “I mean, I guess the way I acted overall wasn’t very okay.” Damn, it was hard to admit this to Draco, way harder than it had been to talk about it with Ron or Hermione.
Draco took a page out of Harry’s book and put his own hands under Harry’s shirt.
of explaining to do if that happened. But he pushed those thoughts about his father aside, that was a matter for another time.
Harry must have slipped his casual mask or Hermione supposed what was going on inside his mind, because she elbowed Ron discretely. For Harry’s relief Dean and Neville were both distracted – reading a magazine and looking for something in his trunk causing a mess respectively – and seemed to not have heard Ron’s question.
to talk about it. Harry wouldn’t give him a chance, would he? “Look, I know this is a lot. I know he said some horrible things to you, Hermione. But it’s more complicated than that. He told me things about how his father would make him. His father told he had to be like this. But he doesn’t want to. He said he won’t do it anymore. And still, the point is that it’s over. I ended it. I knew that couldn’t go any longer so I ended it.”
“Yeah, I know.”
But now he was rejecting that, too. Now he had nowhere to turn. He could only hope Dumbledore would have him and tell him what to do. Maybe if he did something to help he would feel less miserable. “Actually, yeah,” he said turning to Harry again. “I do want a hug? A hug from famous Harry Potter, the good, benevolent Harry Potter. Will you hug me? Will you show that your heart is filled with nothing but love and accept this poor soul? Huh, will you, Potter? Will you show how great you are, how better than me you are?”
“Yes.”
“I don’t want a hug,” Draco muttered, even though if he was truth to himself that was kind of what he wanted. Not from Harry, but from
Later that day, after their last class of the day, Harry, Hermione and Ron were hanging out in the hallway outside the classroom they had just left. Hermione had to stop to organize all of her stuff in her bag, so they had been standing there, talking. Harry saw some movement with the corner of his eye, he looked and saw someone just around the corner. Malfoy. Right before Harry could turn his face to the other way he saw Malfoy beckoning for him to follow.
he thought. Again, not sure where things were meant to lead to, therefore, unable to feel properly unsatisfied with the way things were going thus far. He had walked a couple of steps toward the door when it occurred to him that he was lucky that the robes covered up the volume that jumped out of his trousers. At that thought he stopped, turned around, made for where Harry was standing and unceremoniously grabbed Harry’s crotch. He didn’t know what he expected, but couldn’t help feeling a little disappointed that it wasn’t hard. “See ya,” he added casually, made for the door once again and left.
“Yeah. That would be nice, I guess.”
“You’ll see. C’mon,” said Draco and nodded toward the already door to the Room of Requirement that was already materialized. They entered the Unknowable Room and Draco led the way, clearly having been there a million times, since he not once hesitated in which way to go amidst the total mess of the place.
thought Harry and pushed Draco hard to the side so he could get up. He went to where Draco lay and now it was his turn to give a punch in the face. And another. And a third one. He paused, unsure of what to do next. He never saw Draco draw his wand.
Draco understood it, really. He didn’t hold it against Harry. It must have been difficult to admit he had feelings for Draco when Draco was so committed to being a jerk to him and his friends for many years. Draco wasn’t any saint either of course.
“Let’s eat dinner at our Houses’ tables and we meet again after, okay?” Draco said as they were climbing down from the carriage.
” said both Ron and Hermione.
. Long. Time. Like. For the rest. Of my life,” Harry said, exaggerating the pauses to mimic Draco’s words.
The thing was that Harry was going nuts because of this. He didn’t know how to act towards it, what he should do. Going to Draco’s compartment was definitely not an option. What would he say when he got there anyway? Harry had been lucky not to bump into Draco in the hallway and be forced into saying something in front of other people, so he wouldn’t walk into this scenario.
“I had your back,” Astoria answered. “When I told you not to go there. You were asking for it,” she finished and giggled a bit more. The professor stood up and started talking with the class, making the two girl stop their conversation. Harry, who had been listening to their exchange smiled satisfied and grateful for the Astoria girl. It was really heartwarming to see Slytherins being nice.
“Fuck off, Malfoy, I’m not in the mood,” said Harry only half playing pretend.
“Okay, I’m just kidding. You’re definitely right, I tried talking to him last night to calm his nerves. I guess I didn’t do a very good job,” Harry said and laughed a nervous laugh. “I’m not as good as you in these things. Go and try to say a few word of encouragement to him?”
When dinner was over Hermione said, “Hey, Harry, we’re going in front to Gryffindor Tower, okay?” Harry mumbled an “Okay,” and his friends walked faster going the way to the seventh floor along with the Gryffindor crowd. Harry and Draco met in the Entrance Hall.
“We can’t go through there,” said Draco in a tone that seemed unaware that they were fighting just moments ago, signaling at the crowded corridor. they wouldn’t be able not to bump into someone, and they couldn’t take out the cloak because then they’d reveal they were wandering in the hallways
In the moment he wasn’t in a very good place with Snape, having fought with him after repeatedly refusing his offers to help him in his mission. To kill Dumbledore. So Snape was working with Dumbledore? Why was he offering to
“Are you alright?” Ron asked.
Harry scoffed.
Harry hadn’t expected that to backfire the way that it did. Draco lifted his gaze from the ground and locked it in Harry’s eyes with such rage that Harry stepped back and touched his back against the wall. Draco walked toward Harry manically, grabbed Harry’s shirt. Harry was now actually scared.
“It happens, mate.”
“Have you seen Draco yet, Harry?” came the dreaded question, Ron was the one who asked it. They had arrived late at the platform and pretty much everyone had already boarded so they didn’t actually meet anyone, they just had time to hurry – what wasn’t very easy because of their trunks – and look for an empty compartment. Luckily they found Neville in one accompanied only by Dean and Ginny quickly joined some of her friends of her year. Harry’s stomach dropped at the prospect of having this topic discussed in front of an audience – Neville and Dean seemed like a whole crowd at this moment.
“Okay,” said Draco, who was sitting on the steps there were in front of the castle doors and was startled to see Harry stepping out. “Anytime,” he added and felt stupid for it. That took Harry a bit in surprise. He was expecting some backlash. He decided to seize the opportunity, he didn’t want to wait anymore. He remembered the thought he had up in the Headmaster’s office – he wanted only peace and quiet from then on. That meant he had to solve every little thing that was pendent.
to show everything. They both had insecurities about their bodies – especially Draco – and they both admired the other’s body and thought that that was the most beautiful person in the world. It wasn’t the erotic kind of admiration.
That was another thing – he didn’t say anything to Draco. Anything at all. If it weren’t for the resemblance and the fact that the whole British wizarding community knew the Malfoy family, you wouldn’t grasp that they were father and son just by looking at them together. Lucius treated Draco with a formality that was coldness, treating only about what was necessary. Draco sensed that his father couldn’t stand be in the same place as him, being reminded by Draco’s sight that he didn’t have a prodigy son to be proud of and to brag about to others.
“Okay,” Scorpius said meekly.
“Fair enough,” Harry started to take off his own clothes as Draco laid on the bed and took off his underwear. Harry finished taking his own underwear off and jump on top of Draco.
Draco thought in bed in many nights. Still thinking about Harry made him feel pathetic.
“Scorpius, this looks perfect. You don’t need to stall anymore.”
“Just mind your own business, Julie, why don’t you?” This sitting girl said through a giggle. The girl who was standing in front of Harry and Draco – Julie – seemed about to let smoke out of her ears. Before she could decide whether she’d go on in this exchange or not, the professor came back and she strode away to her seat, which, surprisingly enough, was with the girl who stood up for Harry and Draco. They heard the other girl saying – still giggling – “I told you not to go there, just mind your own business, it’s really not that hard.”
His friends nodded, though he could see the curiosity about the stone written all over their faces. Hadrian debated for a bit, about telling them what exactly the Headmaster hid there with all the students. After a moment, he decided he trusted his friends; over the previous term, they had become very close and protective of each other. “The stone is the Philosopher’s stone.”
* I've never written a story with a happy ending, and this story has a happy ending. I don't have experience and I lacked the motivation to write a happy ending. (But I'm now feeling more optimistic about a lot of things, including romantic relationships -> I'm now engaged!!!)
Harry sat in his chair as the blond maneuvered the ship. He needed to process everything he just learned. Particularly, the part about him. It did appear that the senator was Draco, his friend before the Dursleys.
After a moment, Lyra’s eyes widened and her mouth formed an “o”. Finally, she understood his meaning. “Yes,” she said, “Just let me change into something suitable for riding.” She made to close the door.
The Jedi Knight swallowed before answering. “My name is Harlan Wolfe.”
Hadrian had never seen so many people before. There was a muggle town about thirty miles south of his home but even that had barely a tenth of the people that were in Diagon Alley. Father had only chuckled and grabbed Hadrian’s hand as they pushed their way through the crowd.
, as their mother always said.
Harry stood a respectful distance away from the pair. He did not want to intrude on their moment of grief. He stood at rest, watching the palace for anyone’s approach. He cleared his throat a few minutes later, alerting the pair to their surroundings again. A group of people had appeared out from under the arches of the palace and were making their way down to where they three of them stood. One of the men had the same platinum blond hair as Draco, so Harry guessed it was the man’s father.
“Dray,” the woman drawled, sickly sweet, and instantly Draco knew he was in deep trouble, “Please get out of bed for me.”
“Alright. Come in and shut the door. We don’t want any more idiots listening in.” Hadrian said and the twins hurried to comply. They sat down across from each other and grinned
“Some pranks…”
Harry sighed as he wandered through the palace gardens. They were beautiful. They had a feel like organized, meticulously maintained chaos, which in Harry’s opinion was much prettier than the rigid layout Baron Dursley had demanded for her gardens.
Thinking about Harlan Wolfe occupied his through the insincere eulogy and the dull crowning ceremony. The Knight had known the greeting ritual. Why would he know that? How would he know that? Krv Čista rituals would be too obscure to be taught as part of a Jedi’s training. The fact that Harlan did not stumble over the words added another layer to the intrigue. Maybe the Knight spent time on Čarobnjačkom, enough to learn the customs.
need a babysitter,” he groaned.
Snape sighed, sitting back in his chair. “Of course,” he said, “I’ll start at the beginning. Knight Wolfe was assigned by the Council to be Senator Malfoy’s protection. Together, they traveled to
Blaise nodded. “Okay, so we know the Headmaster set up that corridor as a test for the Boy-Who-Lived, and that he used the Philosopher’s Stone as bait. Who was he trying to attract to the school?”
Draco hugged her back. “Never, Lyra,” he said, running his fingers through pale blonde curls, “If I was running away, I would take you with me.”
The air control ships ducked below the canopy, Draco following close behind. Vines tries to tangle and ensnare the ships. Only the spires of the few tallest buildings were seen from the air, but once under the treetops, the city spread out in all its glory. Seemingly endless miles of buildings blended perfectly with the natural beauty of the rainforest. The other cities were similar, flowing seamlessly with their environments. While Čarobnjačkom’s architecture was generally aesthetically pleasing, Draco loved this style much better. He thought it to be magnificent, completely embodying primal elegance.
After about an hour, Harry was distracted by a chair scraping. Draco had stood up, gathering up the textbook and his bag. Harry tried to keep his face neutral, but he could tell it fell some. He really enjoyed studying with the other man.
Pansy threw back her head and laughed as Hermione rolled her eyes. “Of course, my love,” she answered, “We mustn’t let the poor boys at Durmstrang be deprived of our beauty.” She smiled at her. “Even if it will be so cold there.”
This time, his friends vocalized their shock. There were shouts, and much cursing, both elated and horrified. Draco jerked upright, turning his head to stare at Hadrian in shock. “Really?” he exclaimed, “Is Dumbles completely insane? That’s an extremely dangerous, highly sought after magical artifact. How did he get approval to house it in the school? With all the people that could go after it, it would put the students in danger.”
He nodded. He had been thinking the same thing. He cleared this throat. “Let’s continue looking,” he said softly. The air was heavy, with what he could not pinpoint, and he did not want to disturb it. “Hopefully we’ll find something.”
Draco chuckled. It was one of their old riddles, to make sure it was the other before opening the door. In case it was one of their parents. He cleared his throat. “The Dragon Constellation,” he answered.
Russian dialogue will be in italics =)
further south, close to the southern coast. The lands he had been on, the lands Harry said were the Dursleys’, actually belonged to the Potters. Comte and Comtesse Potter. Draco had never heard mention of them, which frustrated him to no end. How could the court just
” Draco laughed as well, turning back to the door.
“Of the young…”
“I was in the archives earlier,” Draco drawled, taking a sip of his wine to play at nonchalance, “Looking through the noble registry to evaluate the different families, when one caught my eye.” He heard Lyra try to swallow her giggles against her cup, and he attempted to kick her under the table, to no avail. “Potter,” he stated, “I’m not familiar with them.” His eyes flicked between his mother and father to gauge their reactions.
“How Slytherin from a Ravenclaw. Then again, you always did belong in the house of snakes. I’m not sure how you managed to convince the sorting hat that you didn’t.” Came a familiar drawl from behind them. Hadrian immediately stiffened and his face became an emotionless mask. Cas chuckled
“O-oh.”
“Silent treatment? Never pinned you for the type.” Harry’d be damned if another Agency villain clammed up on him. “Breaking into a government building like that, threatening the lives of a multitude of civilians and high-ranking officials—that’s really serious stuff.” He leans in. “Lot more serious than thieving from a local ironworks or acting shirty with the law or, hell, getting physical with some of the heroes.”
a tad.”
“A-absolutely. We didn’t get along, no, when he was alive.” Despite his better judgement, he maintained eye contact. “No one deserved to die like that.”
“Wait.” He’s standing in the shadow of the sitting room doorway; the hall light cuts across the bottom half of his black robes. “Malfoy.” His right hand, partially raised as though to reach for Draco, closes on air and falls at his side. From the glimpse of skin given, Draco noticed its colouring was off, a grey-tinge to it. “Can—If you hear anything?
He recovers by starting his game, pretending his stillness had been a product of thinking over which moves he’d take. “Is that what you people call concern for friends? Desperation?”
Harry got his head injury wrapped, and he had been told he does have a slight concussion. Which is great. Just fine. He still has to wait for the main bulk of the other patients to be treated, though, before Poppy plans to handle his less pressing injury.
“Woah-
“Keeping tabs on me, are we?”
?” Tears score their own marks down his face, some slipping into his mouth from his pained grimace.
“Control over Sonar’s the kind of thing you don’t go playing around with.”
“You’ve frustrated me,” she continues. “Your actions have seemed senseless to me and spoke of a willingness to put your fellow heroes in danger while you flirted with letting a villain escape justice. It appeared careless, the way you behaved. Like, as long as what you did didn’t affect you, you didn’t have to take your duty as a hero seriously.”
But then Potter steps back with a muffled apology, and the spell is broken.
. But . . . “I don’t—”
“Yeah,” Harry croaks.
He lets out a long sigh of acceptance.
Potter looks down and notices his hand still bunched in the fabric of Draco’s robes. A sheepish look steals across his face, and he smooths the hand out but doesn’t remove it. The hand settles against Draco’s chest, over his heart. “I don’t—I don’t know. Certainly not like—not like Mr. Hendricks.”
Potter still stares wordlessly at him anyway, and Draco wonders if Potter’s become skilled at Legilimency in recent years.
Blaizing Fire falls back into his chair, leaving Harry to wonder when he’d started leaning forward in the first place.
Harry barely dares to breathe.
Harry heads upstairs to his room and drops the duffel bag with his costume and mask inside it onto his bed. It needs serious washing with all the rolling around in a ditch he did tonight. Changing back into his civilian clothes in a narrow alleyway where he’d dropped the costume’s arms into a puddle certainly didn’t help any.  But that is a problem for Well-Fed-Harry.
“My dear
Now he’s running his latest patrol in Central London.
Hermione bites her lip. “But—”
“I know what you’re thinking, and, no, we don’t know who was behind the attack as the culprits struck after he left his house.”
Paper Dracon really must be badly injured if he isn’t wasting energy to mock Harry in that moment.
Startled, Harry chokes out, “I-I thought you knew already.”
. What are you doing here?”
Hopping off the couch, he dashes off to search for Mrs. Weasley.
Hermione pats at Harry’s hands lying on the table top. “Paper Dracon’s probably getting treated at one of the Villain Agency hideouts. No need to stress any more about it tonight.”
of any kind!”
“No. I mean the other one.”
He pauses and thinks for a minute. “Yeah, I kind of do.”
A pit forms in Harry’s stomach, and a voice in his head whispers,
“Gave as good as you got. And I recall you escalating first.”
“Fuck you.”
Hugging him back, Harry says in a rough voice, “Yeah . . . I am.”
“That’s only because you’re doing yours on something interesting.”
Hermione answers the door in jeans and a pink jumper, her deep twist crochet braids tied up in a ponytail. “Harry! Where’ve you been? It’s over an hour since you should’ve been back.”
Unfortunately, considering the room is filled to the brim with containers full of steel, Harry knows he can’t quite let his guard down despite the warehouse seeming to be empty. Villains could be hiding anywhere in the maze of crates, counting down to an ambush.
He hesitates. “You hold onto it. So, it’ll remind you that I’m maybe not just another person you managed to save.”
A hero off to the side rushes up and hits him in the head with a food dish. “Off with you, villain! Haven’t you lot done enough?”
as he goes to throw whatever knives he’d managed to collect from the scuffle inside the Palace, deadening his powers. Then Ron lifts his other hand in Hermione’s direction, just as the last millimeter of space gets used up on the page.
here wants to talk to the villain. Even though he’s clearly in poor health.”
the body parts, Potter. It’s about regrets.”
“A little late to be raising that question, don’t you think, Hermione?” Ron asked from his position as Settee Spectator and Potions-Making Cheerleader. “I mean, you could have asked that from any point between Harry wondering if it’s possible, to you researching it, to you brewing the bloody thing.”
Dracon remains frozen.
“So after that, the machine followed after him. I remember its outstretched arm touching the beam of light, reaching out towards the figure. Very skeletal and creepy-looking, too.”
The two of them have a staring contest, and Draco breaks first. “The Kimchi paste. Garlic is a main component.”
Harry felt tears gather at the edges of his eyes, and he tightened his grip in Draco’s as the ground raced up to meet them, shattering their perfect, crystalline moment of harmony.
“Have some pity.”
Hermione starts walking about the room at a slower rate.
“Though, you say you need it for the case?”
“Ooh, a date?”
Pulling back from him, Potter scans his eyes across Draco’s face. Merlin, Draco knows he gets terribly blotchy when he cries.
“Shh, it’s not your fault, Draco,” Harry said. “You’re not to blame for the evil actions from evil people.”
Experimentally, he ran his hands along the undergrowth, touching bushes and shrubs and tree bark. Swiping his hands through these things came with a similar mild resistance as when he flung himself through the window, and echoes of the livings’ essence clouded up behind his hands before realigning back into proper position.
“I’m not moping.” Despite his protests, Harry slides a finger beneath the flap and slowly pries it open.
At a cross section, Paper Dracon gestures to a pitch-dark alleyway.
Harry nods and powers up. He grits his teeth and bears through it when it feels like all his nerve endings are on fire. Perhaps the both of them had taken on more villains than they could manage.
“Not entirely sure, but it had these bright red-glowing lights when it had been turned on.”
“Go ahead.”
“Oh, absolutely furious. It sort of escalated from there. The machine sensed our aggression and turned on me, switching to more of an offence mode.” Dracon starts walking again, and Harry keeps pace. “But it had sucked some of my power from me. So as I struck it with my paper, it took that same paper and set it against me. It was like fighting myself.”
. Tell me? Let... let me come?”
Alpha Bee claps his hands to gain everyone’s attention after using his Control over Fabric to pull Harry and Cho back to their seats. “Settle down, everyone. No throwing accusations at one another, please.” He tosses a glance Cho’s way. Then rubs a hand down his face. “Though, what you’re saying is a bit troubling,
Both nurses agree.
Blaizing Fire serves six months for the attack on a government building. Each month, Izulu sends him roughly eight playing cards, until, when he’s finally released, he has the full deck and an invite to a weekly card game at the Weasley house.
Alpha Bee notices Harry looking at him since he’s close enough to see behind the reflector lenses on Harry’s mask. “Yes, still not much luck with our young guest.”
Finch-Fletchley frowns. “I already gave my statements to the police.”
“I am not!”
Draco scuffs his shoe against the linoleum and closes his eyes. “Got a message ‘couple days ago. From th-the other one—the vi’tim we didn’t see—Mr. Daw-son. ‘e pulled out.”
“Hermione and I’ll come too.”
Snatching back up the hand that was incessantly massaging Draco’s chest, Harry said, “I know, but I’ll go with you. That way you don’t have to be afraid.”
“Uh . . . no. I just—”
He looks around, but he doesn’t spot the odd villain anywhere. Harry does see, however, Cho fighting a small army of
“Farewell,
Slowly, Harry stretches his arm over to her and covers the hand in her lap.
“Would you mind standing up?” Dracon asks.
“Think nothing of it. After all, I do owe you my life, and you were involved that night. Least I could do is give you some kind of explanation.”  He stands up and clasps Harry’s gloved hand. “Though, I hope after this, I get to go ahead with forgetting this whole incident.”
.........................................
“You offered; I accepted. You backing out now?” While the last part had clearly meant to come out forceful, it instead leaves Dracon sounding hesitant and uncertain.
What he gets is a sharp inhalation and the subtle shift of Dracon’s hands to steady himself against the tree behind him.
Her tongue clicks again as she helps lay him back down. “That can wait until after your next healing session is finished."
But as he’s moved, Paper Dracon speaks barely above a whisper. “I should have known. The moment he didn’t show right at the meeting spot. I shouldn’t have looked for him.” As he’s set against the wall, his attention shifts to Harry. “Guess professionals make mistakes too, huh, hero?”
“Could have been to both.” Finch-Fletchley lifts his shoulders in an unaffected shrug. “But regardless of who that was aimed at, the robot kept coming closer to the figure. I think the colleague had been laughing while this was happening—so, it must not have been a good argument the two were having.”
Ginny nods in understanding, her red ponytail bouncing where it hangs through a hole in her mask. “
