The sound of voices pulled Remus back into the present. Harry must’ve returned. Checking the clock, Remus noted that the three had been gone for over four hours. With a smile, he put away his book and went downstairs.
“Well, and then there was last year,” he said, omitting the horrible summer holidays that had followed the Tournament, just like he’d omitted the rest of his summers.
Third year was comparably peaceful to relive, especially because he could tell the story with the premise that Sirius wasn’t actually a mass-murderer. The mention of Remus turning into a werewolf in front of them, without his Wolfsbane potion, elicited a small gasp from Draco, while his explanation of how he’d fought off the Dementors to protect himself and Sirius earned an impressed look from Narcissa.
“I was wondering, actually, what you had planned for the DA,” said Hermione, drawing Harry’s attention away from the group of third year boys.
He thought back to their dinner the previous day. The atmosphere had admittedly been quite tense, and Harry had found himself wishing that Remus were there multiple times. Following an unspoken agreement they’d avoided mentioning the war, Voldemort, or really anything that could’ve ended in an awkward conversation; which didn’t leave a lot to work with. Harry knew Narcissa probably had questions about his changed appearance, but he’d been relieved to find that she’d apparently decided to keep quiet about them for now. He wasn’t sure whether he could’ve explained without breaking down.
“It’s a family heirloom, darling,” he said with a smirk. “That’s why this isn’t your actual present, but I wanted you to have it either way. You see, that bracelet has a counterpart.”
For a moment, Remus was frozen, then his anger returned. In two strides he was at the door, ripping it open to reveal a wary looking Severus. The sight of so much caution in his face took Remus aback and he was able to rein in his anger a little.
He knocked a third time before pulling out his wand and sending a soft spell against the wards, just enough so whoever was inside would feel it. Finally, there was movement inside and two seconds later, the door was ripped open to reveal a scowling Severus. At the very least, he did seem to be alright and had not been called away by Voldemort.
in there. Nevertheless, somehow Draco was sure that Potter wasn’t there, that he had gone down to the kitchen. He must have.
Sometimes Draco, Remus and Narcissa joined them, which usually resulted in Severus, Draco and Narcissa having a miniature chess tournament between the three of them, with Harry and Remus admitting defeat after the first few games and contending themselves with watching as the three Slytherins tore each other apart on the chess board. On one such evening Remus had produced a set of cards for Exploding Snap and within no time there were two fierce competitions running in parallel.
“But,” Harry continued, before the Weasel could counter, “that’s not the thing that I meant to tell you. I’m assuming you two have already told everyone that James Potter isn’t my father, otherwise they’d have asked me why I look so different all of a sudden.”
my father, and I guess I’ve sort of started to wrap my head around that by now, Death Eater or not. But now he told me that it was him who brought the prophecy to Voldemort—”
“We can agree that our friendship and our responsibility toward Harry take precedent, correct?” Severus nodded. “We also agree that there is mutual attraction between us.” He nodded again. “Then how about we keep our friendship the way it is and simply…indulge sometimes? It doesn’t have to be complicated.”
the voice insisted. He frowned. He couldn’t imagine Lily to break her marriage vows, and yet, Harry clearly wasn’t James Potter’s son.
“Mr Malfoy, what choices have you made regarding your courses?” he asked silkily. He already knew, of course. They had discussed it back at Grimmauld Place one evening after one of their chess competitions.
Severus scoffed. “First you insist that it isn’t the same, now you refuse to back down,” he said sardonically.
He had never been the type to throw a fit or to lose his cool. Instead, his anger boiled just under the surface, fuelling the formation of countless ideas for revenge in his head. One look at Remus confirmed that he was not alone with such thoughts. The wolf’s amber eyes had adopted a yellow glint, similar to the one he got around the full moon, and they were burning with wild anger. It would’ve been frightening if Severus hadn’t so wholeheartedly agreed with the sentiment. Obviously neither of them had known how bad Harry’s childhood had been, and Severus resented himself for assuming that he must have been pampered as The Boy-Who-Lived. Now that the truth was out in the open, Severus could not let it stand.
“It’s Friday evening, you haven’t been to dinner and you did not turn up in the staff lounge. I was getting concerned.”
“I didn’t want to make you wait longer than necessary,” Harry replied sheepishly as he stepped up to Draco.
encouraged him to be this way.“ Severus felt his anger rise again. “How much danger do you want to put him through? Is this your twisted way of preparing him to fight the Dark Lord? Maybe consider actually training him instead, rather than sending him into ridiculous situations that are far too dangerous for a boy his age.“
Harry had absolutely no desire to move, not when Draco was curled around him, his blond head nestled into the crook of Harry’s neck, an arm wrapped around his chest and a leg thrown over his thigh. It was still fairly early and Harry wished it would stay early forever so he could stay here, in his bed, cuddled up with Draco. Ever since their trip to Diagon Alley Draco had stayed in Harry’s room for the night, and Harry hadn’t complained; waking up next to Draco was probably his new favourite part of the day.
“Don’t sulk, Severus. By the fact that you’re making a bedroom for him, I gather you two have worked our your differences?”
He chuckled, then set to penning a similar letter for Ron, with less academics and more Quidditch talk. When he was done, he could join Draco on the couch for all of five minutes before Narcissa’s chiming charm called them down for breakfast.
Draco nodded and took the arm his mother offered them. Within seconds, they had spun away from Grimmauld Place and landed in one of the designated apparition points in Diagon Alley. People filled the streets, a wild assortment of witches and wizards going about their weekend business, doing all the things they couldn’t get to during the week. It was a hot day, and Draco immediately pulled out his wand to cast a cooling charm over the three of them—it wouldn’t do to get all sweaty before they even got to browse the stores.
Finally, Harry set down his cup and turned to face Remus again. “I want you to tell me everything. Every word Dumbledore said, everything you know.” Harry’s voice was hard and his eyes gleamed with determination.
brewing?” asked Severus, looking over Draco’s station in an obvious attempt at figuring it out based on his ingredients. Draco was almost certain that this would be one of the few recipes Severus didn’t know.
“Right, but compared to you, my last experience with a man is far further in the past,” Severus argued, his hands wandering to Remus’ chest. “I barely remember the details, so perhaps it would be better if you—”
“Explain,” he ordered sharply, holding on tightly to a shaking Narcissa. Severus’ face twisted with guilt, which confused Harry even further.
Harry gave him a heartbreakingly sad smile then and Draco’s insides twisted painfully, his chest constricting. Echoes of Harry’s story about his relatives reverberated through Draco’s mind, and suddenly it all clicked into place.
Seeing that he was no longer needed, Severus turned to go, looking forward to finally getting some rest, when Albus stopped him. “One moment, Severus, I must speak with you.”
“Quite right,” Albus agreed happily. “Congratulations, Severus. You will be teaching Defence Against the Dark Arts next year.”
Technically, nothing spoke against telling their parents—because when it came down to it, that’s what Lupin and Severus were to Harry, even if things were complicated at the moment. And yet Draco didn’t particularly fancy the idea of having them all fuss over them, or worse, disapprove. He was fairly sure his mother would be delighted—once she’d swallowed the fact that her son was gay, if she hadn’t already figured—and he also didn’t really worry about Lupin being unsupportive. But Severus? Draco had no idea how Severus would react if he suddenly announced that he, his godson, was dating Harry Potter, his son. After all, Severus had been the one who had to listen to most of his ranting about “Potter and his fanclub” for the past five years. He might think Draco was playing a trick on his son, or he might be angry with Draco for wasting so much of his time cursing Harry, if he was just going to turn around and date him in the end.
“It’s not your fault,” Lupin said, as if he’d read his mind. “He’s just a teenager, and he’s going through a lot. After all your years of teaching you should know well enough how teenagers can be.”
Harry glared at him. Right, where it matters. Except he didn’t even have all the subjects that mattered, as it turned out. And that was ignoring the fact that one exam had been interrupted by Aurors chasing Hagrid off the school grounds and attacking McGonagall, another one had consisted entirely of him making things up, and in a third one he’d literally fallen asleep and collapsed with a fake vision from Voldemort. Yeah, his exam results were bound to be
People had to believe that he had no idea who his real father was, which meant that he had to keep up the act of mourning the loss of James Potter as his father figure, even though he’d gotten over that quite thoroughly by now. Of course, there was always a risk he might screw up. A tell, a voice crack, something that would clue people in, and though they had a contingency plan Harry hoped it never came to that.
“The daughter, Merope, was Voldemort’s mother. The Muggle was Tom Riddle Senior, Voldemort’s father.”
Remus was annoyed. Beyond annoyed, actually. Taking a deep breath, he went back into the kitchen, closing the door to the pantry behind him.
Harry grinned and leaned over to give Draco a kiss. Severus kept his eyes fixed forward to avoid automatically glancing at Remus. Did he notice? Was
As the half-hour break between second and third period came to an end, Hermione left for Arithmancy, leaving Ron and Harry behind to work on their Defence homework. While it was fairly simple for Harry after spending all summer training, Ron kept up a steady stream of complaints about the complexity of the assignment.
Harry laughed as he pulled away, moving towards the edge of the bed. Getting up he said, “That’s fair. Come on, let’s get ready for bed, I’m exhausted.”
Am I hitting you with somewhat of a filler chapter after the cliffhanger in the last one? Yes, yes I am, because I really wanted to get to Remus’ POV. Don’t murder me please.
Harry had gone motionless just a second before Draco’s fingers had reached his back, before he’d felt—
He winced at how possessive his words sounded right after they’d left his mouth, but Harry didn’t seem to notice. On the contrary, he beamed at Draco as if he’d just gotten a present.
In front of him, several Death Eaters were tortured for their failures at the Ministry, but Severus barely paid them any mind, absorbed in his own thoughts and worries, about Harry, about the potion, about how they would ever manage to defeat this monster he called master.
She was already moving along the clothes racks, picking up trousers, jumpers and shirts as she went. Harry’s face was now scarlet, but he didn’t argue. Draco smirked, nobody would dare argue with his mother when she adopted this particular tone, not even Harry Potter.
“Thank you,” Harry whispered. He leaned in, letting his lips hover above Draco’s, just close enough to lightly brush when Draco smiled. For a moment, Harry relished the tension between them, deliberately waiting to close the distance. As expected, Draco didn’t stand for that tease for long and he pulled him in, moulding their mouths together and drawing a moan from Harry. He would
“And you’re the best thing that’s ever happened to me,” said Harry as he pulled away again. “Better late than never, I guess. Still,
The girl didn’t even realise you were sitting right in front of her and she has the audacity to imply you’d be better off with her band of giggling dimbos.”
The duel that ensued was as fierce as the last one and far more hectic. With two opponents and an ally to protect, the logistics of it all were twice as complicated. The fight lasted a long while, and when Harry managed to disarm Remus, Severus suddenly found himself faced with two quite skilled duellists and with rather depleted energy reserves. It ended quickly after that, although he managed to disarm Draco right as his own wand flew from his into Harry’s hand.
Their faces were only inches apart and Draco was passively aware of the odd symmetry of the situation. Potter’s eyes were scorching and Draco couldn’t look away, as the energy between them seemed to shift drastically. And Potter wasn’t fighting him.
Harry laughed again and leaned over to give Draco a kiss, successfully wiping the scowl off his face.
has done a full 180 since your visit to the Ministry,” he said, pulling the newspaper out of his pocket. “They’re calling you the Chosen One, saying that you’re a hero destined to kill You-Know-Who.”
“But Harry,” Hermione argued, “you’re not even in the same house, how will you possibly be able to see each other?”
, always asking for you, even though we’ve told him a million times that you are not and will not be staying with us the entire summer.”
“I have,” Severus confirmed. “We’ll have to hide both Draco and his mother, Narcissa Malfoy, if we want to ensure that the Dark Lord holds no leverage over him. Narcissa never expressed any sympathy for the Dark Lord, I believe her to be trustworthy.”
“It’s only been two days since Lucius was arrested. If we play this well, you could return to Hogwarts after the summer—where you’d undoubtedly be safest. You’d have to act fast, though. Is Narcissa ready to leave on short notice? Can she gather whatever possessions you want to keep and didn’t bring to Hogwarts for you?”
Thank Merlin for adults actually acting like adults, right? How do we feel about kinda-having-feelings-but-very-good-at-rationalising Severus? Can’t possibly go wrong, right?
Severus frowned at that, but Remus drew his attention with a light touch to his arm and shook his head.
“Yeah?” Harry purred, nuzzling into Draco’s neck and nipping at his ear. “What’s so bad about that?”
It felt like an eternity until Slughorn finally reached the table where Harry, Ron and Hermione were sitting next to Ernie. Hermione’s already sour expression darkened further when he sniffed her cauldron and gave no reaction beyond a satisfied nod.
He paused. Harry was watching him closely, paying more attention than Severus had ever seen from him before.
It gave Harry plenty to think about. He continued to interrogate Draco about how life in Slytherin was, and for the first time since his sorting Harry wondered whether he’d made the right choice to ask the hat for Gryffindor. Slytherin seemed to have so much more…camaraderie. How ironic.
“Of course I was,” she laughed. “How many times do I have to be right before you start believing me, Severus?”
He found all of them, sitting quietly around the table, each immersed in their own reading, seemingly just about to finish their breakfast. Upon seeing him enter, Narcissa immediately got out of her chair.
going on for Harry Potter to smile at Draco Malfoy. But that had to wait. For now, they had a potion to brew.
The class stilled immediately, heads turning towards the two men staring each other down. In that moment, Draco couldn’t help but feel that their relation should be plainly visible to anyone who looked at them. They were the same height, had the same high cheekbones, the same sharp jawline. Suddenly he was glad that his mother had cut Harry’s hair short, it’d be even more obvious otherwise.
Draco nodded silently. Finally, Severus turned back to Harry, and Harry felt a complicated mix of emotions well up in him. This was goodbye, in a way. They’d see each other in only a few hours at the welcoming feast, but just like his relationship with Draco, his connection to Severus had to stay secret. They were back to hating each other, at least in public. No more quick conversations on the stairs, no more easy banter—Severus wouldn’t even be able to call him Harry anymore. He felt a lump form in his throat and swallowed hard.
Without sparing him so much as another glance, Snape marched past them. Narcissa wrinkled her nose as she watched Snape disappear into the library, then turned to raise an eyebrow at Harry.
“Yes, that seems to be the general response to it but I assure you it is true,” Severus replied smoothly. “It came as a surprise to both of us.”
They reached the pub only a few minutes later and Harry quickly said his goodbyes to Ginny, Ron, Hermione, Molly, and Arthur before they all flooed back to the Burrow. He turned to say goodbye to Tonks, but she had her eyes fixed on Remus, giving him a dazzling smile.
Stunned silence followed. Narcissa stared at him disbelievingly, while Draco’s face was a mix of confusion and shock. Snape, however, was scowling. For a moment Harry wondered what had displeased the man so much—he’d already known about this.
. A snarky response was already on the tip of his tongue when he managed to control himself. “Alright.”
Harry gave a hollow laugh. He wished he could believe that. Not wanting to think about the prophecy anymore, he began to devour the pancakes Narcissa had served. For a while, neither of them spoke.
She shook her head, pushed back the sleeves of her robe and showed him both her forearms. No Dark Mark. Harry relaxed a little.
“It’s not entirely clear, I’m afraid. Some say that spells that have only one singular function—that of healing—are healing magic, while spells such as cleaning charms have more than one purpose and therefore don’t fall into that specific category. Others claim that healing magic has an inherent quality that other spells lack, although it has never been agreed upon what exactly that would be.” Severus paused, giving him a cautious smile. “I still have some books on this, both on healing itself as well as on the more theoretical debates surrounding it. I could bring them for you, if you’d like.”
In the month since Harry’s birthday they had done so much of this, one would expect that Draco should be used to it by now. He wasn’t. Not in the slightest. In fact, he doubted he’d
The door clicked and opened, then closed again. Draco was alone. He let out a shaky breath, trying to compose himself, to get a grip on his emotions bubbling up in his gut, to shove down the impulse to just follow Harry instead of going back to his friends.
“You couldn’t have been sure of that when you arrived here. Why didn’t you call for me instead of showing up
“He screamed at Ogden whether he knew who he was talking to, showing him a ring — that ring that cursed Dumbledore’s hand. He yelled that it had been in his family for centuries, that it was worth a fortune with the Peverell coat of arms on it.”
“I haven’t quite forgiven you yet,” Remus insisted, and Severus grimaced slightly. A smirk spread on Remus’ face as he added, “But there’s something you could do that might make me forgive you faster.”
“You could’ve died,” Narcissa breathed, her face white as a sheet. Severus was prepared for this sort of argument.
He heard a sharp inhale from the table and glanced over at Remus, Draco and Narcissa, unsure who it had come from. Their faces all mirrored the same expression of surprise.
“I was weak, I can admit that by now. I was hoping to gain the Dark Lord’s favour, hoping that he could open doors for me, provide opportunities I would never get on my own. This way of thinking is what ultimately made me tell him about the prophecy I had overheard. But even back then, even as I told him about it, I had my doubts about supporting him, doubts that began long before but were overpowered by the influence of my surroundings. They were, however, slowly growing stronger—because of Lily. Because of that night she came to see me, to say goodbye. The night you—”
“You know as well as I do that we’ll either forget or be too tired afterwards. And I don’t want to have to keep it in mind, I’d rather focus entirely on you when I strip you out of these clothes.”
Severus’ mind began to race. Potter had always looked like a carbon copy of his father, now he didn’t anymore. Potter had always behaved like his father, too, his magic had had the same flair, now his magical signature had changed. There was only one good explanation.
Severus paused. Remus watched his face turn contemplative as he thought the question over. He wished he could read the man’s thoughts, since his expression barely betrayed anything. A good pokerface was probably prerequisite to being a spy.
“I’ll come by your room for our lesson later, as usual?” Severus turned the statement into somewhat of a question.
“My point is,” Pansy interrupted their sniping, “that you usually care about everything to do with Potter. You got into a fight with him in the first ten seconds you two were in each other’s vicinity, but not a single word about him since—not even when Dumbledore announced that DA thing. What happened when Snape ordered you to his office?”
He whirled around at the sound of his name, coming face to face with Lupin. The man gave him a tired smile.
It didn’t take long before Harry came, groaning into Draco’s neck where he’d buried his face. They cleaned themselves up with a couple spells, and Draco took care to straighten out their robes properly before fixing both their hair. Harry rolled his eyes, but beyond that simply accepted his fate and waited until Draco was happy with their appearances.
Severus swallowed as he remembered the prophecy. Harry had to kill the Dark Lord. Why did it have to be him? Why did the universe give Severus a son, just to immediately dangle a blade above his neck? Was he doomed to love people that were being hunted by the Dark Lord? Because he would be coming after Harry, Severus was sure of it.
“Oh, no need to worry, please follow me,” the goblin replied promptly, gesturing for them to follow him into a secluded little booth, where he called for Burgock. “This young gentleman need access to his vault without his key, would you perform the necessary identification and then show them to their vaults? I must take care of Lady Malfoy in the meantime.”
have people to protect, who cares that we’re not related by blood. Hermione, the Weasleys, you, Dr—”
They held each other’s gaze for a moment, then Remus leaned in again for another kiss. It was slower this time, more deliberate, but no less passionate. When they broke apart again, they were both panting heavily and Remus’ trousers had gotten uncomfortably tight. He really had to distract himself or this would escalate in
Snape echoed his words promptly and the bond formed. A thick, blindingly bright bond. Harry’s heart skipped a beat and began to race, while at the same time his stomach turned to ice.
Taking one last deep breath, he rounded the corner and stepped into the entrance hall, Remus on his heels.
“Thank you, I would like to see my check-book renewed, and the two young men would have access to their respective vaults,” his mother responded coolly, her perfect pure-blood mask firmly in place.
“No, Harry, you don’t understand. Even if you hadn’t explicitly asked her to keep it to herself, she’d have broken the vow because
Severus shook his head. “I started the transformation once, a long time ago. Unfortunately, I never completed it.”
“I can’t,” Harry cut him off. “That was the one thing Dumbledore insisted on: I can’t tell Dad about any of the memories.”
, it would be too late and Potter would get past him and be gone. Blindly following his first impulse, he closed the distance between them, grabbed on to Potter’s shirt, spun him around and pushed him hard into the wall next to the open door.
Harry felt his face flush and he hoped Draco hadn’t caught what he’d almost just said. God, what was wrong with him? Why would he say—
Narcissa glanced at the grandfather clock at the wall and said quietly, “They should have arrived now.”
and I apologise for that, uni has been killing me and all my bigger stories were put completely on ice. So, I'm uploading this chapter despite the lack of any progress whatsoever because it's been months and I feel bad for making y'all wait. I still haven't been able to continue, but I hope to get a chance to take a few days to truly sit down and write soon. But for anyone who's getting worried or is losing faith:
Draco wasn’t sure how to handle any of this, didn’t know how to react. He was frozen in shocked silence, gaping motionless into the darkness. Harry lifted his head and put a hand on Draco’s cheek.
Draco’s expression darkened immediately, a mix between concern and anxiety. For all of Draco’s grandeur, he could be remarkably insecure. As if Harry would ever even consider letting him go again. No, as long as Draco wanted him, he’d stay, and hopefully one day Draco would know that. Unless Draco left first. Harry felt himself frown at the thought, and he quickly pushed it away. They had other things to discuss.
Minerva looked like she wanted to say something, but Severus ploughed on, wanting to impress on her just how significant the change was.
“It wouldn’t be possible anyway,” he said quietly, “not while he’s still a spy for the Order. Nobody can know that he’s my father, it’s already a huge risk to tell the Weasleys—but they’ll keep quiet, they’re part of the Order, they’ll understand the importance of it.”
to hear Harry say that word and mean Severus with it. It sort of…confirmed the fact that they were father and son. It added that last missing fragment that made them two pieces of a pair. Suddenly their resemblance seemed much more obvious to Draco, as if it had been veiled before, obscured by something invisible.
A hand on his arm made him halt in his tracks. Remus smiled gently and shook his head, taking the speech from Harry’s hands.
“Well,” Narcissa said, clapping her hands together, “I suppose I’ll go and get settled properly then.”
Affection and exasperation mingled at those words. Harry had way too much trust in Remus. While that may be justified on normal days, during the full moon one couldn’t be too careful around a werewolf. Remus hoped incessantly that Draco could sway Harry’s stubborn mind, even though he knew it was unlikely. Lily had always been impossible to sway, too, once she’d set her mind to something.
“This isn’t working, we need a Healer! We have to bring him to St. Mungos,” said Remus, sounding rather frantic, and bringing Harry’s focus back to Severus.
“You are not broken, and you are not a freak. He’s a filthy arsehole and a liar and he deserves to suffer for everything he did to you. No, I won’t go murder him,” Draco assured quickly when Harry opened his mouth to interrupt. “Even though I would bloody well like to, I won’t. Ultimately, I don’t care about what happens to him—if he suffers I’ll be glad, but that’s secondary. First and foremost, I care about you. I thought I understood everything of relevance about your childhood, but it seems I was very wrong. I’m sorry I didn’t realise sooner why you were so reluctant, I should’ve seen the connection, I—”
Minerva was already there, two glasses of firewhisky sitting on the small table between the worn looking armchairs they had long since claimed as theirs. Over the years, some of their colleagues had attempted to join their weekly meetings, but none of them had stuck with it for long. Not that they hadn’t welcomed them; the other professors simply seemed to have more diverse social lives than them. Remus had never even tried when he’d been hired as the Defence teacher, and Severus was fairly sure he knew why.
Both Narcissa and Remus gave him annoyingly soft smiles, and he stood more abruptly than would’ve been necessary. Draco sneered at him as he ended his spell and sat back down at the table, while Harry moved to stand in front of Snape, whose core was still pulsing in front of him.
Harry took another sip of his butterbeer and let her get over her indignation in her own time. Ron glanced back and forth between them as if he was unsure whether to say anything or not.
For a moment, neither of them said anything, then Severus sighed and turned to Narcissa, saying, “Well, I should be going. You know how to reach me, and we’ll stay in touch.”
“Do you like it?” Severus asked softly, while the argument between Molly and Charlie continued in the background.
Draco scowled, but his traitorous heart could not refuse Harry when he looked at him with those pleading green eyes. Those eyes should be illegal. That entire face with that expression should be illegal, it was worse than the Imperius curse.
The sudden need to kiss him again had Harry surging up, crashing their lips together. His hands found Draco’s, pushing them up above his head and into the mattress with their fingers laced together. Draco whimpered into his mouth and it sent hot shivers down Harry’s spine.
“By talking to Albus Dumbledore, and, once he agrees, by accompanying me to an Order meeting. You might even find familiar faces there. Nymphadora Tonks I believe is your niece?”
for Harry! He’ll wake up not looking like himself and probably not feeling like himself either, only to be told that James Potter—the man he’s heard so much about, the man he knew as his father—is
The man just kept piercing him with black glittering eyes, and Harry resigned. “I got distracted a lot. Noises in the house, wind, flimmers in front of my eyes, just sensory stuff. And my thoughts kept drifting off, but I tried to refocus on breathing again when I noticed.” He trailed off, not wanting to go into details about where his mind went.
Minerva’s eyes widened. “Harry?! Don’t tell me he really picked the Weasley girl, I already owe Pomona five galleons for Abbott and Macmillan.”
Harry just looked back and forth between the three in utter bewilderment. Ron’s face was slightly red, while Ginny and Hermione shared identical looks of irritation. He had noticed a few colder glances between the Weasley women and Fleur at his birthday, but he hadn’t expected that much animosity.
Setting the towel aside, Harry sat down at his desk, pulling out two pieces of parchment. For a moment he just stared down at the empty sheets, feeling stuck. What was he supposed to say? He shook himself and pushed his lingering worry away. Resolutely, he dipped his quill into the ink-pot and began to write.
It was a bit over a month now since he’d lost Sirius. A bit over a month alone, and he found himself
Suppressing the icy flare of panic, Severus brought up his mental shields and reinforced them double and triple. He felt the wriggling presence of something foul at the edge of his mind, worming its way inside. Taking deep breaths, he allowed it in. He knew what to do, he’d done it countless times. It didn’t matter that suddenly there was so much more at stake, that he suddenly had a secret more important than his own life.
“Yes,” Narcissa cut in, before either Harry or Draco could speak up. “He asked me to remove your clothing to cast skin to skin, so I vanished your robes. They were so cut up that they wouldn’t have been unsalvageable anyway.”
Heat shot through him and it was a miracle he didn’t faint from all the blood rushing south all at once.
“It’s going to be alright, Harry,” Narcissa assured him. “Although I did mean to ask you something, before I forget: Would you mind if I called just two or three of our house-elves in for help tomorrow?”
“I— I don’t know, I just wanted it to stop, to stop thinking about it, to stop remembering it. I— It felt like I shouted, but inside my head. And then it was suddenly quiet, like
With a shake of his head, Remus pushed the memories away and began warding his door. He had convinced Harry to go and take a bath, to unwind a little after the horrors of trying to heal Severus, by pointing out that he could smell the blood on his clothes. Still, he was fairly certain Harry would be back any minute. Once the wards were in place, Remus stripped out of his clothes and settled on a mattress on the floor, which he’d transfigured from an old armchair from downstairs, nibbling on a piece of chocolate.
he thought wryly. And besides, they were sixteen. They weren’t kids anymore, and Severus trusted them both to be responsible—he knew that Remus had given them the talk, a story which had amused him to no end when he’d heard it for the first time.
about him! Was that all a lie? Why would you pretend only to drop him again out of nowhere? He’s a human being, not a toy to play with!”
“Again, an understatement,” replied Draco, nuzzling closer into him. And Harry had to agree, he was beyond exhausted.
Remus replied in his head. He hoped that Harry knew that. He’d have to show him better, erase any doubt Harry could ever have that Remus wouldn’t give everything for him. He might have failed Lily, when he allowed her son to be raised by her cold-hearted sister, but he would not fail her again. He would not fail Sirius by letting his godson go unprotected. And most importantly, he would not fail Harry.
“Things went a little awry,” Remus finished for him. “You have to talk to him, Severus. Today. The longer you wait, the worse this conversation is going to be.”
Sudden understanding crashed into Draco like a hex, followed by a feeling of overwhelming guilt. He’d assumed Harry simply didn’t care about how he dressed, he had never expected that he had nothing else to wear. From the little Harry had said about his relatives so far, first something about being used to going hungry and now this, Draco began to suspect that Harry’s childhood was very different from what he had always imagined.
Narcissa put her hand over his, giving him a mild look. “From what I’ve seen so far from Harry Potter, he’d give you a second chance if you simply asked him for one,” she said softly, which in turn elicited the first open reaction from Draco in quite a while.
It took barely more than a heartbeat before the twins enthusiastically proclaimed their desire for cake, and the atmosphere in the room shifted immediately. Draco decided that the twins were his favourite Weasleys—he could overlook that they’d drawn their wands earlier, the reaction wasn’t completely unwarranted after all—when they lamented loudly that they had all but forgotten to give Harry his present, reminding everyone that this was supposed to be a celebration. If they all actually cared about Harry, that should hopefully keep them in check for the rest of the day. In a flurry of movement, countless gifts were pulled out of bags and pockets and passed towards Harry—who promptly handed them all to Draco’s mother and she swiftly added them to the pile in the back of the room.
“I know, cub, I know. But you have me, I’ll always be here.” Remus produced a handkerchief and wiped Harry’s face. “I won’t ever abandon you, cub. Even if we find your father, I won’t give you up. You’re family to me, Harry.”
“Nonsense,” Draco insisted. “My mother and I are no more at risk than anyone else on the light side, and you barely look like yourself. I mean, you do, but not the you everybody knows. If we glamour your scar probably barely anyone would recognise you. I bet even Granger and Weasley would have to do a double-take to be sure.”
“It’s not my fault you’re slower than a Flobberworm. Just move your pompous arse so the rest of us can get to the castle
“I could never hate you, I already told you that you’re family to me. That didn’t change in the slightest. As for Sirius, I don’t think he would’ve hated you.”
Harry gave him a bashful smile and nodded his agreement. “Yeah, no argument there, that was terrible. Let’s just forget it ever happened. Because it didn’t.”
Then, finally, Blaise hummed thoughtfully, twirling his glass to make the liquor swap back and forth. “Maybe Theo has a point, it couldn’t hurt to get some extra practice. We are nearing our N.E.W.T.s after all.”
Draco looked like he was about to dash upstairs, but Harry held him back. He wordlessly conjured his Patronus, causing Draco’s jaw to drop.
before Draco had spoken about him. Just like Draco had been Malfoy, all the Slytherins had existed only with their surname in Harry’s head—and now they didn’t anymore. He’d have to be careful not to slip up if he ever interacted with any of them; with Draco at least the necessity to call him by his last name was present in Harry’s mind, not so much with the rest of them.
to. Wanted to feel Harry’s skin under his fingers. Wanted to truly let his hands wander, let them wander lower, to explore
“I am perfectly serious,” Harry insisted. “You know why? Because if they make me choose, they’re not the people I thought they were. Why would I choose someone who tries to keep someone I lo— care about out of my life?”
since what happened at the Ministry, I imagine it’s even worse for you.” Neville moved aside for Harry to heave his trunk onto the luggage compartment, dropping into his seat with Trevor still clutched in his hands, his eyes fixed on Harry’s face.
Yeah, he was definitely not leaving this room again. Ever. Or at least not until they went back to Hogwarts. He groaned again.
“I’m not talking about Sirius,” she said cautiously, her eyes flitting back and forth between the people at the table.
“Harry already found someone,” Severus cut in. Albus’ eyebrows rose ever so slightly, but it was enough to betray his surprise to Severus.
With practiced ease, he presented a complex mind to the Dark Lord, full with secrets, memories and fear of discovery of said secrets. It was all a fabrication, constantly updated to accomodate what the Dark Lord would want or need to see, should he ever decide to take a peak into Severus’ mind—like now. Severus showed him Dumbledore, complaining about difficulties to rally forces for the Order—a real memory, but taken out of context. He showed him complex potions he experimented with—again, real memories, but meaningless. It went on like this for a while, the Dark Lord’s probing and prodding reaching deeper into Severus’ mind, but still contained in his carefully constructed set of misleading truths. It was bound to be over soon, or so Severus hoped at least, as he felt his concentration slowly slip.
“Ever the generous donor,” Fred jested, before pulling Harry towards the shelves. “You’ll change your mind once you see where we’ll make our real profit: Our new defensive collection! Portable shield charms, glamours and temporary disillusionment charms—although we’re still working on perfecting those.”
It hadn’t been too long ago that Pansy had insisted that she was entirely heterosexual, now here they were with her unashamedly thirsting over potential pretty girls somewhere in Italy. He was glad to see that his friend had gotten over her anxiety of coming out—and her family had taken it well it seemed.
Draco pushed down the mild wave of disappointment that rose up in him. He’d rather hoped for Harry to join him, but no matter. They still had plenty of time before they had to leave Grimmauld Place behind.
Cringing slightly, Harry turned to look at him, raising a questioning eyebrow. He could hardly have read any titles from back there.
“Remus, there’s nobody else Lily spent as much time with as you, Sirius and James,” said Molly Weasley, wringing her hands. “Unless you’re suggesting Peter Pettigrew as Harry’s father, you’re the only—”
Draco’s voice had jumped an octave higher. The usually so composed boy looked downright terrified, eyes darting back and forth between Harry and Remus.
“My word, it’s flawless! Wonderful, Harry, truly excellent! It’s no surprise, of course, your mother was extraordinarily talented at potions as well after all. You clearly inherited her gifts.”
According to Severus’ book, prism vipers reached maturity after approximately seven months. Sirona was only three months old. Nevertheless, Harry thought he could already see hints of a pattern emerging on her iridescent skin. As soon as the pattern was fully formed, she should be able to use her abilities completely at will.
“He’ll be fine,” Remus said, echoing Harry’s thoughts. “We gave him another healing potion and a vial of Dreamless Sleep. We’ll bring him upstairs, you should go rest, Harry. That was an awful lot of magic you used for that spell, whatever it was.”
This was Draco. He knew Draco, no matter how ridiculous it sounded. He knew Draco’s triggers like his own, if not yet physically then at least mentally, knew their push and pull that they’d been engaging in all those years better than anything else.
, Harry thought grudgingly. For some reason he’d been looking forward to entering Severus’ quarters by himself for the first time. But no matter.
“Stay safe, Harry, promise me. Don’t do anything foolish. And write to me! Just because Draco will write doesn’t mean you’re getting out of it.”
Harry’s breath caught and he moved closer until he could peer inside to see her standing in front of the table, hands on her hips, looking quite irritated. He couldn’t see Severus.
The entire class scurried to resume their work, nobody daring to even look in Severus’ direction as he strode through the classroom again.
looking forward to that particular conversation. It would likely destroy any and all progress he’d made with getting closer to Harry, and he couldn’t even blame Harry for it. Still, he knew it had to happen sooner rather than later, if he wanted any chance at forgiveness at all. If everything went well, he would bring it up tonight.
They were interrupted when Dennis Creevey approached their table, drawing Harry’s attention as he felt the intrusion on his Muffliato bubble. He silenced Ron with a glance and turned to Dennis.
“This was delicious, thank you,” said Harry eventually, as he finished the last bit of food on his plate. Narcissa smiled.
They jumped at the exit Harry was offering them, and the trio — well, mostly Hermione — spent the next several hours refining Harry’s lesson plan.
“I’m not saying he doesn’t know or understand the spells he casts, I’m saying that understanding is not the key for him to get a spell right,” replied Draco.
just before they’d gotten off track. Could he refuse? Albus’ argument of gaining the Dark Lord’s favour to enable him to potentially protect the Order and Harry was admittedly rather convincing.
Severus buried his face in his hands again. The four newcomers stood stunned for a moment, then Draco broke the silence.
“Stop,” Harry cut him off. “Please don’t— There’s no way you could’ve figured it out. Draco, I’ve been hiding these for five years at Hogwarts, not even Ron knows about them and we share a dorm
Severus found himself cursing Lily for her talent with charms. Maybe he would’ve seen, would’ve found out earlier, would’ve had more time with Harry before a full-blown war was upon them.
His face twisted into a scowl. Merlin, what had he done? He’d been so focused on how much he hated James Potter that he’d completely ignored that the boy was just a child, like any other.
, bonding. And while the subject had been mostly avoided after the initial announcement, nobody had shown him open animosity because he was suddenly the son of Severus Snape. The Weasleys still accepted him. Now all that was left to do was to gather his courage and confront Severus.
“We’ll be careful, we would’ve been careful either way,” Draco said dismissively. “Wouldn’t we, Harry?”
His heart was racing, belying the neutral tone of his words, as he waited for her reaction. The seconds seemed to stretch forever. Finally, a small smile appeared on her lips and she nodded.
“You look like you’re going to faint any second, Potter,” Draco drawled, some colour returning to his face. “Wait a moment.”
“Fine, I’ll try to talk to him tomorrow,” he conceded, despite everything inside him screaming that he shouldn’t. “Let’s just talk about something else now, please.”
“I’ve been away with mother,” he replied evenly. “After my father’s arrest we decided it’d be best to take some distance from the Manor. It has been a rather uneventful time, I’m afraid, not much to tell. What about you?”
But today, Draco had been different. Angrier, rawer. The look he’d given Harry when he’d come up those stairs had been such an unlikely mix of anticipation, heat, and—oddly—
“And here I thought you didn’t like all the bustle in the house since Phlegm arrived,” Ginny shot back.
“He wants me to kill him before this curse in his hand does,” he revealed dryly, shooting a glare at Albus.
Harry considered for a moment, then shook his head. “No, I think I’m good for now. I’ll let you know if I ever need something.”
another, more rational voice admonished, and Draco shook himself. He had to do this—whatever “this” was, given that the entirety of his plan consisted of— Of what? Of confronting Potter in the kitchen, telling him that, yes, Draco would very much like to kiss him? No matter how reckless Draco felt, that was bravery beyond his personal limits.
Harry immediately sought another kiss, but Draco pulled away, scooting up on the bed until he had his back propped against the leather headboard. He patted the mattress beside him and opened his arms for Harry to crawl into.
Remus laughed. Harry’s confidence had improved steadily over the summer, but this was a new peak for him.
Harry was struggling to blink away unwanted tears, still stubbornly staring at the wall. He wanted to believe what Remus was saying, he really did. Still, there was a weight on his chest that made it hard to breathe, hard to think.
“Excuse me, Professor,” Pansy Parkinson interrupted. “Didn’t you say that Draco’s potion was perfect? Why didn’t you offer him the Felix Felicis?”
Severus let out a breath of relief. He wasn’t too late. Better, even, Draco wouldn’t fight his attempts to spare him from a terrible fate. He took another look at his godson. The boy looked terrified; good. He should be terrified, that’d make things easier.
Severus chuckled and shook his head. “I have no doubt he could, but he wouldn’t. Albus cares about his reputation too much to resort to cruelty.” His expression sobered. “Nevertheless, this is of significant importance, particularly to the two of you,” he continued, pointing at Harry and Draco.
“He was my godfather because he was James’ best friend. He never would’ve been if Mum hadn’t concealed who my real father is. He never would’ve had any reason to like me or care for me.”
“What did those relatives of yours do that you have such a reaction to me yelling at you?” he asked, his voice hard and laced with cold fury.
“Seriously, Potter, how have you never noticed that? You hexed me plenty yourself,” Draco inflected with a sarcastic sneer.
“The only reason I’d go anywhere near that club is an opportunity to witness Potter’s failure firsthand,” Draco drawled, waited a second, then curled his lips into a malicious smirk. “Could be worth it, I bet he wouldn’t even know what to do with himself if we showed up—just imagine his face.”
and I’m supposed to kill the most powerful dark wizard of the century. Are you seriously trying to tell me that I should limit myself in my ability to fight?”
For a long, tense moment there was silence. Then one of the twins—Draco could never tell them apart—chimed up way too cheerfully for the given circumstances, “You should have told us there’d be a show, Harry, we’d have brought popcorn!”
“So?” Dumbledore prodded, and Harry realised that he was waiting for an answer on how Harry had done it.
“He’s right, Draco.” Harry cringed under the glare Draco gave him. “I hate it, too, you know I do! But he’s right. If there’s a Death Eater at Hogwarts it’s probably a Slytherin, and if they see that you’re with
. He ignored her bemused look as he read through the table of contents of the other two books as well, trying to discern whether this would actually help him with his healing forms or not. Arithmancy seemed far more complicated than runes, but he supposed it didn’t matter too much. He would learn if it was necessary.
The Slytherins took position at the far wall opposite where Remus was standing in front of the blackboard — close to the door, as if preparing to bolt at any given moment. He couldn’t blame them. Remus saw more than just a few nasty glares being shot their way as he let his gaze wander over the crowd of students. So far nobody was being outright hostile, but he’d have to keep an eye on that while Harry was busy. At least he’d have something to do.
“Nevertheless,” Remus began, setting down his glass as he moved out of his chair and approached Severus, “we were interrupted last time.”
The cake was delicious. Nevertheless, Draco felt his tension rise again as silence settled over the room once more. How would they ever get over this incredibly awkward stage of having absolutely nothing to say to each other? What did Weasleys usually talk about anyway?
“Yeah mate,” Ron agreed, “wouldn’t it be better to just…y’know, end it now? Before you’re in too deep and it hurts more when it doesn’t work out.”
Theoretically, Draco had known what to expect, had felt it clearly beneath his fingers already, and even knew the story behind it. The sight of it still shocked him. Harry’s back was covered in scars; some looking old, pale and faded, others still faintly pink, raising from the surrounding skin. Either these had been absurdly deep, or they couldn’t be older than a year. Slowly, Draco lifted a shaky hand and ran his fingers down Harry’s spine, feeling every bump.
“Anything for you, love,” Draco replied, and Harry felt him smile. “Do you need help with applying it?”
Seemingly unbothered by the lack of space, Remus joined him on his armchair and pulled him into a tight hug. They stayed like that for a long time; Remus providing a steady, calming presence while Harry cried and cried—cried like he hadn’t done in
As weird as Luna and the things her father put into this magazine were, they had never once wavered in their support of him. It was not something he would just forget about. Still, when she began to patter about Crumple-Horned Snorkacks, he was glad for Neville’s interruption.
, he’d really tried to make him proud. His grades had been impeccable, his table manners flawless, his friends from the right social circles. He’d acted like a perfect pure-blood, no, a perfect blood-purist even, spitting slurs, looking down on his classmates like they were inherently inferior to him, and always, always hating Potter.
Some were harmless; he simply enjoyed teaching and it was fun, and he got to hang out with his friends at the same time. Others were somewhat reasonable, like the idea that it might give him an in with some of the Slytherins which might give him the chance to convince them not to follow Voldemort once they left Hogwarts. And then some were downright selfish, like the thought that he could not fight a war alone, Chosen One or not, and he was going to need as many allies as possible in the battles to come—even if he had to train them himself.
“On the contrary, you see, Potter, I have functional eyes and they show me that something’s wrong with your face. Now if you don’t mind, back off so I don’t have to suffer it anymore.”
Harry’s stomach dropped at her blunt summary of his fears. He nodded numbly, trying to breathe normally.
Harry’s eyes were hard now, his expression serious. For a few tense seconds, he and Weasley stared each other down. Draco half expected to see wands drawn and hexes fly again. Then Weasley relented, averted his eyes, shrugged, and mumbled, “Alright then, I’ll drop it because it’s your birthday—but we’re not done! You owe me a real good explanation for all this.”
“Lily Evans and I were involved during our time at Hogwarts. Right before her wedding, she visited me to say goodbye.”
Frustration bubbled up in him, frustration with Potter, with himself and with the unfairness of Potter’s apparent ability to avoid him. Sulking, he stalked back into his bedroom, right next to Potter’s.
really sorry for— Well, for everything I did and said that made you feel mocked or looked down upon. I didn’t exactly have the best social skills, and I’m fairly sure I still don’t, not in a healthy way at least. I understand why you rejected me, now. I didn’t back then though. My father raised me to believe that, as a Malfoy, I was inherently superior, entitled to the best. When you rejected me…it threw everything I knew and relied upon overboard. Believe it or not, I genuinely wanted to be your friend.”
, this effortless way of being close to each other, would have to end soon hit Draco again. He’d gotten so used to always being around Harry. Sure, he’d always known that they wouldn’t be able to share a room anymore once they got back to Hogwarts, but up until now he’d worked under the assumption that they’d at least be able to be together in between classes and before curfew. And perhaps a little beyond curfew, especially now that he knew all about Harry’s Invisibility Cloak. Now all of a sudden they were supposed to pretend that they still hated each other?
“That sounds intriguing indeed, how far along are you with the design?” he asked, turning slightly towards the twins as he joined the conversation. As George began to explain all their testing, Draco could finally relax a little. Maybe Harry was right and the twins would really just trust Harry’s judgement and play along, now that they’d gotten over their initial shock of seeing him here. They didn’t even seem to hold a grudge against him for getting them banned from Quidditch the previous year. As their exchange went on, Draco even found that they weren’t just polite, they were…nice to him. Perhaps not all the Weasleys would hate the idea of him dating Harry.
Draco met him halfway and they quickly got lost in each other, hands wandering freely, exploring the not-taboo-anymore parts of each other’s bodies. It didn’t take long for both of them to moan their release, and Harry had to wholeheartedly agree with Sirona. Draco had indeed made him feel better.
“The MMI—Ministero della Magia Italiana,” Blaise answered. “She’s some kind of spell-specialist for all sorts of weird magic, a bit like the Unspeakables at our Ministry.”
Slytherin’s bad reputation seemed to stem mostly from its association with dark wizards that had been sorted there, combined with a tendency to misconstrue ambition as ruthlessness. Hermione had included a book recommendation in her letter, and Harry was thrilled to find the tome in the library downstairs. In it he found accounts of the lives of the most famous witches and wizards from each house, regardless of what they were famous for. Harry honestly had never even heard of most of them, but some even he recognised. Merlin, the greatest wizard in history, had been a Slytherin apparently. Uric the Cruel, however, famous for his bloodthirsty pursuit of power showed in brutally slaughtering half the Wizengamot in the late Middle Ages, had been a Gryffindor.
“And you couldn’t go to your own room?” Ron snapped, still obviously unhappy about Draco’s presence. Draco flinched slightly, but before he could even begin to move away, Harry tightened his arm around him, pulling him closer.
was how Harry was planning to earn his detentions, this year was going to be exceptionally entertaining.
After a couple minutes, Harry freed himself from the embrace, whispered “Thank you” to Draco’s mother, and took a few deep breaths before turning back to Burgock, who was watching them anxiously.
“Clear the table in the dining room!” she commanded, before lifting Severus into the air with a levitation charm.
“Sorry!” Severus yelped again, and finally had the mind to retreat back into his room, pulling the door closed.
He was the last one to get up, trailing after Remus as they made their way to the dining room. Just when he was about to strike up a conversation with the man, he heard Harry’s voice behind his back.
“Of course I am, but I’ll have to face it eventually, there’s no way around that. I’d rather tell them now and deal with it here, than watch Ron have a heart attack in the Great Hall.”
“Sure, whatever Saint Potter wishes,” he drawled, before pushing past Potter. He even managed to keep a leisurely pace rather than running up the stairs.
“Me too,” Harry agreed. “But we don’t have a choice, do we? It’s only a matter of time until people figure out why I’ve changed so much since the end of last year, and we’re relying on everyone believing that I don’t know who my real father is.”
“Our friends will get suspicious if we’re gone much longer, I’d rather not have to lie to them,” said Harry with a wry smile. “You can have your turn at
. Tragic, it bloody well sucks, but I can deal with it. Have dealt with it my entire life. But if— If he rejects me, I’ll be an orphan because I’m
Draco looked at Harry pleadingly. “I’m sorry, I really am. Not just for how I’ve treated you, but for how I treated people in general. It got better after I got somewhat close to Pansy and Blaise.”
“No, no, you’re absolutely right, Harry. Really, without you we never would’ve managed to get the shop. We’ll figure it out next time, alright?” said Fred.
“That’s it?” She looked at him disbelievingly. “I thought you must’ve gotten into serious trouble for you to stop complaining about Potter.”
Narcissa nodded. “Yes, there is. But we’ll make good use of it, I already talked to Harry about repurposing some of the bedrooms.”
was—and moved back the tiniest bit before suddenly taking Draco deeper into his mouth, making him gasp in surprise. He took him deeper until Draco felt him shudder, then moved back a little and sucked. If Harry’s arm hadn’t pinned him to the wall, Draco’s knees would’ve buckled and he would’ve collapsed then. A loud groan escaped Draco’s throat, but he was too far gone by now to even care. He felt Harry smile again for just a moment, before moving back and sucking him down again.
“Not in there,” he said hastily, just as she wanted to pull open the door. “It’s not really…habitable yet.”
Blaise’s mother was incredibly rich after inheriting the estates of seven deceased husbands. The rumours that she may be behind their untimely demises had been impossible to be proven true so far.
about Harry? Now that he thought about it, he imagined to remember that Draco had reacted almost immediately when Harry had almost collapsed after healing Severus earlier. Remus had been so focused on the man that he had barely payed any attention to Draco.
He was saved by his mother announcing that it was time for Harry to unpack his presents. That got everyone’s attention, and anyone standing or sitting in another part of the room joined the main seating area again. Almost nobody still sat in their original seat, in fact, only Severus, Remus and the twins had not moved at all. It reinforced the feeling of a much more relaxed atmosphere than before.
“There are counter-curses, containment spells, some curses have to be drained from the blood—blood-replenishing potions come in handy there—and the curse-breaker department at the Ministry has their own set of spells specifically against injury inflicting dark magic.”
“I’m sorry,” he apologised. “You shouldn’t have to deal with that crap just because people know that I’m close to you.”
Minerva smiled knowingly. “Albus mentioned that Grimmauld Place has gained additional inhabitants, I suspect this is when I learn who those are.”
“I was such an idiot,” Draco went on, his voice barely audible. “It took me way too long to realise what an utter arsehole I was being, and by then it was far too late. By the time I started to question my father’s views, you already hated me with good reason. All of you. Even when I grew to disagree with my father’s ideas, it’s not like I actually had the guts to go against his wishes—I kept up the act, afraid of his reaction if I didn’t. And now even though
By the time Ron came in to let Harry know that he was going to dinner, Harry was almost through the entire book. He waved Ron off, not in the mood to subject himself to the stares of the crowd in the Great Hall, and promised to summon Dobby to bring him some food.
“On the contrary, Legilimency is a rare skill and difficult enough to learn that many people give up before they ever achieve it. Even though I all but opened my mind to you, it is most astounding that you have managed it so easily and I am curious as to how you did it.”
Severus scowled. “The basic mastery of a skill does not qualify you to instruct other students. I suggest you remember your place, Mr Potter.”
Harry crossed his arms and considered the spell. It seemed straightforward enough, no doubt, and he generally trusted Narcissa’s word—however the hell he’d gotten to that point—but it wasn’t a definitive yes-or-no answer. What if the differences to the bond were subtle? What if the link between unrelated people would glow almost equally as bright? Would he be able to tell the difference?
Draco blushed slightly, shook his head, and said, “No, you were suspiciously accurate, in fact. O for Transfigurations, Potions, Charms, Astronomy, and Arithmancy; E for Ancient Runes, Care of Magical Creatures, Defence, Herbology, and History of Magic. It’s alright, I guess.”
“To you? I distinctly recall you refusing to participate in this wager because, and I quote, ‘Potter isn’t worth two seconds of your attention’. Granted, that was a long time ago, but—”
“Fine,” he breathed. “But leave the door unwarded, I don’t wanna have to break you out first if something goes wrong.”
It wasn’t lost on Severus that she had omitted him completely, not even giving him the courtesy of assuming that he was an insufficient guardian—no, her omission made it clear that she didn’t consider him one of Harry’s guardians at all.
Forms, forms, spells, forms— There! The pattern was complicated, far more complicated than anything else Harry had tried so far, but its purpose seemed to fit their needs. Curse cleanser. It involved runes, because
She laughed. “I knew before you did—I even told you! But yes, Remus did provide the last bit of confirmation I needed to be sure that Harry is truly yours. Why else would
She glanced at the new door to the former side-room, much larger than the previous one, and asked smilingly, “Redecorating?”
They kept up the idle chatter about the house while Harry finished preparing tea for the three of them, before finally sitting down at the head of the table, Narcissa to his left, Snape to his right. It felt like an odd position to take, but he wanted to sit neither directly next to Narcissa nor directly next to Snape. Once more, he wished Remus was home so he’d have someone on his side—whatever that side was.
“I’m Romilda Vane,” the girl replied. “Do you know where Harry is? We’ve searched the entire train but couldn’t find him.”
“So, where are you bringing me?” Narcissa inquired as they stepped out of the house. “You hardly planned for me to stay here, where the Dark Lord would undoubtedly find me with ease.”
“What? No, I was joking, don’t worry about that,” Harry amended quickly, but the twins wore matching expressions of rare seriousness now.
“Uh, sure. It’s really not necessary, though,” replied Harry, feeling slightly awkward about it all.
He quickly sent a Patronus to Lupin, announcing his visit in a few hours along with a careful mention of potential guests, before immediately conjuring another one and sending it ahead to Albus to request a meeting as he began to make his way towards the headmaster’s office.
Harry quickly pushed the thought away, reminding himself that Malfoy had practically delivered him and his friends to Umbridge the last time they’d been in the same room.
“That’s…Potter? What happened to him? He looks like Black. Why does Potter look like Black? Is this an attempt at concealing his identity? If so, maybe cover the scar,” he sneered, unable to fully control his foul mood.
“What? No! You look bloody amazing, you git,” Draco retorted, before taking Harry’s hand and pulling him down the stairs. “Let’s go, it’s already three o’clock, I wanna make it to Twilfitt and Tatting’s before it gets all crowded once people are done with work.”
“That curse that Voldemort used on your chest, Narcissa said that it was your spell. That you invented it. Is it true?”
“Don’t thank me if you’re not leaving me a choice,” he retorted, unable to bury his simmering anger completely.
Severus looked up, surprised. He hadn’t expected his decision to be questioned, especially not if Remus’ chance at a mostly painless transformation was at stake.
“According to Da—” He broke off and glanced around with mild panic rising in him. “I’ve heard he relies mostly on the textbook,” he corrected himself. Had anyone heard that slip-up?
It wasn’t a question. One look into Remus’ face confirmed Severus’ intuition, there was something he didn’t remember, something important.
Severus watched him go. Suddenly noticing that he was staring, he shook himself and turned towards the basement. The bottle of firewhisky was retrieved quickly, and he was already on his way back to the drawing room when a familiar voice made him freeze in place on the stairs.
“I know how you feel,” sighed Severus, absent-mindedly stirring his potion. “It won’t be easy to pretend to hate him, to treat him as I did before, but it’s a necessity. Nobody can find out that he is my son. Frankly I was already unhappy about telling the
They both stood motionless for an instant, then shared a slightly disbelieving glance before simultaneously letting out a shaky laugh.
Harry was talking at rapid speed and Remus could honestly not remember ever having seen him so excited.
to turn away and close his bedroom door behind him, which left Draco standing in his own doorway, alone.
he told himself sternly, and focused on controlling students’ possessions as they came through the gates. Before long, he spotted Draco and his usual troupe of Slytherins exiting one of the carriages. He finished his detection charm on a third year Hufflepuff and waited for Draco to make his way over. His godson, however, was lingering. Why was he being so slow?
“We should head to Gringotts first,” his mother said, beginning to walk in the direction of the bank. “I must refill my check-book, and you can withdraw some money from your personal vault, Draco.”
“I’m sorry I shut you out, Harry. I didn’t think you’d want me to—well, to be your father. I didn’t think you’d want me to involve myself in your life. But I do, I really do, and that terrifies me, because I frankly have very little experience with showing affection. You have torn my walls wide open and left me vulnerable.” He faltered, dropping his eyes. “After hearing you talk to Molly on your birthday I was convinced you were only humouring me, that you didn’t actually need or want me because you already found another family. So I ran away and shut you out, trying to protect myself. I’ve acted like a child and I’ve not only hurt you but also put Narcissa’s life in danger in the process. I am so, so sorry. I am proud to call you my son, and I would love nothing more than for you to see me as your father.”
“The position of Defence Against the Dark Arts will be taken over by Professor Snape,” said Albus, sweeping his arm towards Severus.
“Harry, there you are!” Hermione called. Her and Ginny were standing by a shelf painted entirely in pink, filled with countless vials of various shapes.
“My gift for you is still upstairs because I intended to give it to you later,” he said, “but since Narcissa insists, I shall go fetch it.”
“I just wish I could truly trust him. Trust that he has really changed,” he whispered, closing his eyes as if to shut out his doubts.
Harry stared at the blonde woman in shock for only a moment, before reflexively drawing his wand and levelling it right at her. Her eyes widened, but she didn’t draw her own wand—she didn’t even flinch as Harry glared at her. She just stood there as if rooted in place, visibly surprised, if not almost shocked.
It occurred to Draco then that they probably should’ve ensured their silence before telling them, but his flicker of concern turned out to be unfounded, as they all agreed immediately. They followed Bill’s example and, swearing on their magic, they each assured their silence—it wasn’t as strongly binding as an Unbreakable Vow, but it would certainly stop any accidental slip-ups. Harry gave a satisfied nod.
“That does indeed sound incredibly practical,” he said, smiling. “I shall post official announcements in all houses tomorrow, that the first DA meeting will take place on Wednesday evening in the Room of Requirement. Seven o’clock?”
“Remus,” he breathed, infinitely glad that it wasn’t Dumbledore. Remus enveloped him in a fierce hug, before holding him at arms length and mustering him from head to toe.
Draco didn’t respond, focusing on sorting his prepped ingredients. Severus stayed silent as well, and for a while they just brewed, each caught up in his own thoughts. Eventually though, Draco’s frustration with the situation subsided enough for his curiosity to surface.
“Thanks,” he said, giving Draco a smile which caused a blush to spread on his pale cheeks. Nobody should be allowed to be that adorable. With some effort, Harry pushed himself out of the chair again and returned to the table. Severus’ eyes were closed, his breathing steady and deep now. He’d be fine.
Harry’s potion hissed, signalling that it was time to add the Sopophorous Bean juice. He took his silver knife that he’d bought at Severus’ insistence and crushed the bean to get the juice.
Harry glanced down at the page covered in scribbles again. Could it be? He found the line that instructed to stir counter-clockwise and sure enough, there was a note jotted down next to it to add a clockwise stir after every seventh counter-clockwise stir. Once was chance, twice could still be a coincidence even though it felt unlikely to Harry—if he found a third note matching Severus’ instructions, it would be a definitive pattern.
“Uhm—” Harry wasn’t sure what to tell her. He’d simply followed the instructions Severus had given them, because— Oh. Because the textbook was outdated, right.
he breathed exasperatedly, tugging him back into a crushing embrace. “Why the fuck— Do you have any idea
The grief of Sirius’ death, combined with the shock of the onslaught of revelations about his parents had taken a toll on Harry. The first few days after they had done that ruddy spell during breakfast had been torture. Locking himself in the hidden library, Harry had spent hours trying to read without actually taking anything in. He’d ignored anyone he came across, only allowing Remus to talk to him behind closed doors in his room. He didn’t have the energy to care about anything or anyone, as he was thoroughly overwhelmed with…everything.
“That’s new,” said Draco before Severus could even take a breath. “That’s definitely new. I’ve been here plenty of times and I would have noticed a second bedroom of that size. This used to be an unused study or something and that door was practically hidden behind the fireplace.”
Finally, just as he was about to get up and leave, Ron spoke up, “We know you’re not anyone’s Golden Boy, mate. It’s just a bit jarring to hear it all laid out like that. I— I honestly never thought about it as you killing anyone — or any
“Now, with the organisational part taken care of, let’s focus on the core purpose of these lessons. In truth, only half of it will truly be educational in the traditional sense — the other half, while it can certainly also be described as educational, is of a more informational nature.”
He had been right, Harry didn’t want him. Harry tolerated him because he thought he had to, but he didn’t want him as a father.
I just, y'know, have a life to cope with on the side as well, and big projects require me to be able to sit down for longer sessions at a time than was possible in the last few months.
She considered him for a moment, before replying, “You are not wrong. However, I would never do anything to endanger Draco in any way. Should the Dark Lord witness me supporting the opposing side, I’m not the only one who would turn into a target immediately—Draco would, too.”
I know many of you said you liked the author's notes, but I was still considering to upload a clean ebook/PDF of
Finally, Draco snapped out of his stupor, tightened his grip and did what he’d meant to do in the first place: pull Harry closer. Except instead of a frantic search for contact, the motion was now one of reassurance, because he couldn’t stand that look of sadness and resignation in Harry’s eyes. To his relief, Harry let him—burying his face in Draco’s neck as if trying to hide.
After he had unpacked his suitcase, he sank down at the desk, staring out of the window. It was a grey day in London and he felt that the bleak view of the street in front of the house matched his glum mood rather well.
“Can you take over? Just keep reinforcing the stasis charms,” he told Draco, then stepped away and slammed the book onto a chair, crouching in front of it.
The result is a rather packed chapter, but I do hope it satisfied your angst and hurt/comfort needs for a little while.
Remus deflated a little, and Severus couldn’t help but agree with the sentiment. Having Remus back at Hogwarts sounded like a brilliant idea.
“Draco, I love it,” Harry interrupted, smiling brightly now. Setting the box aside, he leaned towards Draco and captured his lips in a kiss.
Draco chuckled at his expression and pulled him upstairs, pausing only to kiss Narcissa on the cheek as they passed her. When they finally made it back to their room, Harry immediately collapsed face first unto the bed with a groan.
“There were,” Blaise confirmed in a mock-serious tone. “Unfortunately, I was related to all of them. Though, I suppose some of them would’ve been far enough removed that it wouldn’t have mattered.”
Narcissa went on undeterred, “I acknowledge that I spoiled him to compensate for Lucius’ shortcomings as a father, which did him no favours in regards to his behaviour when he was younger. But Draco is good at his core. He may still have some growing up to do, but he is not like Lucius. He is no killer.”
“How about we go back to your room and you tell me about it?” Draco suggested, getting to his feet and pulling Harry up with him. Harry nodded mutely and moved ahead of Draco to open the hidden door.
a fifteen year old boy whose family so far has neglected to provide proper attire for. I am rectifying that negligence. Consider it a parental gift, or consider it a thank you for sharing your house with us, whichever makes you feel better.”
“Oh please, we both know you and Lily used to be involved with each other. You might have thought you were discreet, but half the staff knew. I also remember how heartbroken you both were when you separated. I’m not surprised in the least that she couldn’t stay away from you for good. Tell me, was it just one time or did you see each other regularly?”
The blackboard was still there, now accompanied by a large clock hanging above it, as well as a desk that stood a little to the side in front of a packed bookshelf against the left third of the back wall. Various instruments filled a second shelf along the side-wall that had a number of training dummies standing next to it.
Severus nodded. He’d had the same thought. While he didn’t believe that Harry was in immediate danger from Albus, it was clear that the headmaster was not exactly careful with which situations he let Harry walk into.
“How about we just forget about that for now and plan the first DA session instead? All without dark arts, of course,” he suggested.
Not long after Harry had relocated to talk to Granger and the Weasel, people started to move all over the place all of a sudden. First, Charlie decided to sit next to Draco to join Bill’s discussion with Remus and Severus, followed by a visibly exasperated Ginny getting roped into the wedding-cake debate and taking Charlie’s seat. Draco’s mother summoned the house-elves then, telling them to serve a variety of finger-foods Draco knew from countless social functions he’d attended over the years. The snacks were laid out on the same table where the rest of the cake still sat, and within barely a minute, three Weasleys were out of their seats to fill a small plate for themselves. Draco was tempted to follow, if only because one of the three was Bill, meaning that the seat next to Harry was currently free. If he was fast enough—
Harry’s mood had taken such a drastic turn, Draco had been downright flabbergasted at first when Harry had
A grin stretched over Harry’s face. “They’re coming!” he announced to his four housemates sitting around the dining table.
of Harry. Heat was pooling low in his abdomen and he felt his pants tighten. Somewhere in the back of his mind a whispering voice was warning him to slow down, to control himself lest he do something that’d ruin it all. He couldn’t focus enough to pay it any heed.
Ron crossed his arms looking extremely put out, but when Ginny began to mock-console him for his pouting he quickly suggested to go back downstairs to the shop to escape her. They bid the twins goodbye before exiting the shop where the four adults were waiting for them.
After getting an absurd amount of homework from Professor Babbling, Draco and Blaise made their way to the Defence classroom. He saw Harry the second they rounded last the corner, greeting Hermione as she joined him and Weasley. The urge to go to him, to just take his hand for a moment—or maybe push him against a wall and ravish him—surged hot through Draco again. He forced himself to look away and walked over to Pansy.
“Narcissa Malfoy,” Severus replied, watching her reaction closely. Minerva’s face betrayed nothing but mild surprise.
Draco. After spending five years watching him at Hogwarts, it really shouldn’t have surprised Harry. He knew little things, such as what kinds of food Draco liked, the face he’d make when he disagreed with something, the little twitch of his eyebrows when he was annoyed. He knew how Draco inflected his voice to get his point across, how he doodled on his notes sometimes, especially during Transfiguration because he seemed to be practically a prodigy at that. And that was just from their very limited and predominantly negative interactions at Hogwarts during the past years. In the month since Draco had arrived at Grimmauld Place, Harry had learnt a flood of things, even before they’d started sneaking into each other’s rooms—or, well, mostly Harry’s room.
room. It took the full effort of years of practised self-control for Remus to freeze instead of flinch, which would’ve set the bloody water in motion, which could’ve moved the remaining bubbles, which
Harry sounded incredibly tired and Remus wished he had his human voice so he could send the stubborn boy to bed for some decent sleep. He settled for a low growl instead.
The girls eyes flew to Ginny and her brows furrowed the tiniest bit, then her features smoothed over again.
“They won’t hate you just because Severus is your father,” he said softly, and judging from Harry’s expression he’d hit it right on the head.
“I’m aware that he’s changed quite drastically, but that doesn’t mean we can simply demand to know why. Remember your manners, Draco,” Narcissa admonished.
“Of course not,” Harry spat, surprising Severus with how much contempt was apparent in his tone, “giving satisfying answers isn’t your style. You prefer to keep people in the dark, convinced that you know best, that they will play along nicely like puppets on strings because they have no other choice; because you don’t give them one by not telling them anything. I’ve had enough of your secrets, either you start talking
Neville was still staring at him quite intently and Harry sighed. The sooner he told them, the sooner they’d get used to it.
They duelled like this for a good while, longer than usual if Remus’ perception of time was any good. Either having the high ground really made a pronounced difference, or Harry was holding back. Remus suspected the latter.
Remus nodded approvingly and Harry settled into his seat more comfortably as Remus finally began to explain the rest of everything that had happened.
This one blindsided me with unexpected Wolfstar feels and now I find myself wanting to write a Wolfstar fic. I won’t though, not before this is done, promise. Also, don’t ever mess with Remus’ chocolate. It’s IMPORTANT!
“It will also pick up on certain emergencies by itself, like if you fall unconscious. I know it’s a little…unconventional, but I thought it could be useful and—”
Remus’ mouth was warm and soft and moving just the way Severus liked. Within seconds Remus had slid onto his lap and Severus sunk his hands in his hair, pulling him closer. The thought of a privacy charm flitted through Severus’ mind, and he was about to break the kiss to suggest it, when Narcissa’s chiming charm rang through the house.
He knew he was probably overwhelming the man, but he needed something to work with. Severus struggled to keep his eyes open, his breathing shallow.
Draco struggled to keep breathing as he felt something rush through him that was near impossible to describe. It felt warm and gentle and tight and serene and exciting all at once, a wave of sweetness, even though sweetness wasn’t supposed to be something you could feel but something you could taste—he felt it. It simultaneously made him want to laugh with giddy excitement and wrap himself around Harry so tightly that nothing could ever separate them again. He settled for kissing him once more.
Harry James King-of-Melodrama Potter is ready to spend the rest of his life in that room, but at least him and Severus are talking now… kinda. And at least he has books to keep him company, healing sure does sound fascinating.
He was talking himself into a rage, but he couldn’t bring himself to care. “And what about Potter? He’s your
spoken about it all yet. Every time it could have come up, it would have potentially ruined a moment that was far too wonderful to risk. It was truly astonishing how quickly their entire relationship had shifted from true animosity, to weirdly positive antagonism, to
he thought to himself. This whole day had been entirely too much, and it was only early afternoon. He longed to go back to bed and escape his thoughts for a little while. Talking to Remus had been most informative, but also draining. He was still struggling to wrap his mind around the revelations about his parents, while also trying to avoid thinking about Sirius too much. He barely registered that Narcissa had let go of his hand, eyeing him curiously now. It was Snape who pulled him out of his thoughts again.
Harry gave him a suffering look, his nervousness rising again. It was a little after seven o’clock now. People would be coming in soon.
“—and he has every right to resent me. I’ve done nothing to deserve his forgiveness, let alone his affection. But I am trying to change that, and I hope that I might one day become a man he wants to call father.” Severus sighed heavily. “There are certain…complications, however. My position with the Dark Lord is precarious, and more important than you could possibly imagine. In order to ensure it I have done many regrettable things, some of which Harry will not easily forgive. And I must continue to do them, which doesn’t make this any easier.”
“Precisely,” said Dumbledore. “Now, while this connection is an obvious vulnerability, it is also a potential advantage.”
wasn’t fair how good he looked, but Draco felt a glimmer of pride at his hand in choosing such an excellent wardrobe for Harry.
He shrugged and replied, “I’ve improved quite a bit over the summer with being able to actually study and all instead of being stuck at the Dursley’s.”
Suddenly, a silver wolf bounded into Severus’ quarters, interrupting his pacing. Lupin’s Patronus floated in front of his desk for a moment, before it began to speak.
Harry smiled. “Regardless of how flashy that duel was, in the end I achieved a victory with a very simple spell most of you should be familiar with: Expelliarmus. Now, I know it’s an old and boring thing, but basics are everything, so we’ll revise that spell. If you’ve mastered it you can move on to other things, don’t worry.”
in DA meetings? Harry, wandless magic can be incredibly dangerous, you can’t possibly supervise everyone closely enough to—”
Harry felt a flicker of irritation and quickly checked his own mind shields. It wouldn’t do for Dumbledore to feel Harry’s displeasure at his … methods.
The fucking prophecy. Voldemort. The atrium flickered before his inner eye, glass shards on the floor, spells ricocheting off the walls.
When they finally broke apart, they were both panting heavily. Their eyes met, and the heat in Potter’s gaze, pupils blown wide, sent a shudder down Draco’s spine.
He had, however, spent the previous evening with Harry after their Occlumency lesson. While it admittedly still felt rather odd to talk to the boy about his personal life, Severus hadn’t hesitated to tell him about his time at Hogwarts with Lily. Harry had seemed appreciative. In turn, Harry had told him about the discovery he’d made at Gringotts over three weeks ago.
Remus’ eyes lit up at that, and Severus recognised that glint of hunger that made his mouth go dry immediately.
It had only been twelve days since Draco had found him that morning in the kitchen, twelve days since this thing between them had started. It didn’t feel like twelve days to Harry, not in the slightest. He couldn’t really explain it but for some reason he just
It took Harry several long seconds to sort out his mind enough to untangle his fingers from Draco’s hair and loosen the grip holding him down to his chest. They withdrew their hands from each other’s pants, Draco grimacing at the mess and Harry quickly sending a wandless cleaning charm over both of them. They were both still trying to catch their breath when Draco lifted his head and looked up at him, and Harry thought he’d dissolve right then and there. Draco looked wrecked, thoroughly ravished, and so fucking beautiful it hurt.
“Come on,” Harry said, trying to get rid of the sudden anxiety welling up in him that they might have made a mistake and ruined Remus’ potion, which would have disastrous consequences.
Draco still didn’t entirely understand what had happened, and he couldn’t help but feel that Harry was being suspiciously vague about it. But in the end he didn’t really care, as long as Severus didn’t turn around and reject Harry again out of nowhere. He was just happy that Harry was happy. And if Severus—or anyone else for that matter—dared to ruin that, Draco would have to retaliate. Because Harry was
“I was just thinking,” he began, “how I’m on borrowed time here. The Dark Lord wants me to take his Mark, and you know as well as I do that there is no refusing him indefinitely. Eventually I’ll have to choose between the Mark or the killing curse.”
Albus began to pace. There was silence in the hospital wing, all eyes on Albus, as he continued to pace back and forth for several minutes.
—Harry was fairly sure there were fireworks going off, though it was difficult to tell with how colourful it all was. The right-hand window was covered with an equally colourful poster advertising
“Good,” Remus replied, getting up. But he didn’t leave. Instead, he paused, hovering next to Harry’s bed, obviously searching for the right words.
“He’s just overwhelmed, Severus,” Narcissa cut in. “You said it yourself, you didn’t want to consider the possibility at first. It’s a lot to take in, especially given your…history.”
“Well then, shall we? You already know the incantation and there is no particular wand movement; simply pointing it at me is sufficient. Just give it a go.”
Severus stared at her in disbelief. His relationship with Lily had been his most guarded secret, both during his time at Hogwarts as well as after they’d graduated and he’d joined the Dark Lord.
had Severus brought them here? The revelation that his godfather wasn’t merely trying to protect Draco and his mother, but was actually a traitor to the Dark Lord had been more than a little shocking. At least Draco assumed he was a traitor, there was no other explanation for him bringing them to
“He is a wonderful boy. I must admit that it is good to know that someone with parenting experience is looking out for him—no offence, Remus.”
“Of course, of course,” the goblin said with a small bow. “May I have the gentlemen’s vault keys? Burgock can accompany you right away.”
“I apologise for the disturbance, but we should have our lesson,” Sn— Severus’ voice said, with just the slightest drawl.
“Oh, I am quite serious. It’s bad enough you had to see and deal with the aftermath, I won’t tolerate you listening to graphic descriptions of how these wounds were inflicted.”
it was hard to focus while it was lingering. Remus compelled himself to keep breathing, slowly getting rid of the very sensory reminder of the encounter.
It took a while for him to calm down, as his mind replayed fourteen years’ worth of rejection and degradation. And now it was over. Just like that? He found it hard to believe, but at the same time he could
who called herself Harry’s aunt had woken a rage in Severus he hadn’t known he was capable of. She was Lily’s sister, Harry was her
“I’ve found you attractive since third year,” Harry deadpanned, and Draco felt like all the air had been sucked out of his lungs.
Severus’ black eyes were hard as he practically hissed the last words. Remus nodded empathically, he could understand the sentiment to a degree, but that didn’t mean he wished the Longbottom boy any ill. Severus took a deep breath and his eyes softened a little, the hardness replaced by something that resembled exasperation.
Harry smiled tiredly and gave Draco a quick kiss before leaving their room and making his way down. As he went down the last set of stairs to the basement, he suddenly heard voices. Arguing voices. He slowly crept towards the kitchen, careful to stay out of sight as he listened.
After summoning Kreacher for a glass of water, he cast a Tempus and realised it was well past lunch time. He’d been here for hours.
, probably knowing full well that his mother would just send him right back. And how dare his mother force him to endure
“Bye, sweetheart, see you soon,” said Harry, smiling at Draco one last time before disappearing under his cloak.
“There’s nothing to be done about it,” he said, stirring the potion twice and setting his wand to buzz in precisely six minutes.
“Well, that is absolutely unacceptable, we’re going to Diagon Alley right fucking now,” Draco declared, pulling Harry off the couch enthusiastically.
After a while, Draco realised that Harry and the Weasel hadn’t returned to their seats. A quick look around found them in two armchairs on the other side of the room, caught up in deep conversation. Nevertheless, as if he’d felt Draco’s gaze, Harry suddenly looked up and their eyes locked. A smile tugged on Draco’s lips before he could control his features, but he found that he didn’t mind very much when Harry gave him a broad grin in return. With some effort Draco forced himself to turn back to Granger, only to find her studying him calculatingly.
The past two days had been delightfully uneventful. After their shopping trip Draco had stayed in Harry’s room for the night and nobody had even tried to question it. To his surprise, Harry hadn’t woken the Slytherin up with nightmares, but instead finally slept a full night without any disturbances, even though he hadn’t been completely exhausted before going to sleep. Later that day, Narcissa had declared the dining room officially renovated, and insisted that Harry assess her result. He’d been glad that he could honestly say that he loved it. She had done a wonderful job, replacing all of the wallpaper, most of the furniture and somehow fixing the old floors. As a result, they now officially ate in the dining room again, instead of down in the basement kitchen. Harry had to admit that it felt rather nice to eat in a room with actual windows. Grimmauld Place was starting to feel like a proper home, and the people inside like somewhat of a family.
“Uh— I sort of pulled my magic into my head and made it pointy? That doesn’t make any sense, does it?”
“Raven,” echoed Severus, as if testing the name on his tongue. “I suppose I can live with that. Though I hate that it is necessary in the first place.”
Her calmness took some of the wind out of Remus’ sail and his irritation settled enough for him to feel slightly guilty for snapping at her.
He turned to face her. She was still studying him, pale eyes fixed on his face, and he didn’t know what to say. Slowly, he returned to the couch and sank back down next to her, staring at the floor. The silence stretched for several long moments before he finally spoke.
“You most definitely didn’t.” Draco kissed him again, pulling him close. His softening cock was still exposed and oversensitive, and it twitched a little when Harry’s trousers rubbed against it. He tucked himself back into his pants with one hand, never breaking the kiss, then turned his attention to Harry’s erection, palming it through the fabric—they weren’t done yet.
“Good, I shall take it from here, then. Go back to your dormitory, Draco, nothing will happen to you as long as you’re still here at Hogwarts. When term ends you won’t get on the train but wait for me in Hogsmeade instead. Narcissa or I will pick you up. Now, I’m sure I don’t have to remind you of this, but it is of paramount importance that not a single word of your whereabouts, who you’re staying with, or my involvement in any of this gets out. Is that absolutely clear?”
She tilted her head looking like she wanted to ask a question, but refrained. “In that case, how about I prepare dinner for us today?”
Harry was surprised. He hadn’t checked the announcement Dumbledore had put up yet, and they hadn’t discussed anything regarding his curriculum.
Remus’ head jerked up, causing Harry to shift and grumble in his sleep. Downstairs, he could hear Draco splutter.
isn’t venomous yet, or at least not lethally so. Nevertheless, I have prepared several vials of anti-venom, for the unlikely scenario that you might ever need it. From what I’ve heard they’re loyal creatures if treated right, and I thought she might be a useful companion—especially given your ability to actually talk to snakes.”
“I guess so. Anyway, I just wanted to let you know about the DA. I should go now, classes start early tomorrow.”
He didn’t follow for a long moment, strengthening his Occlumency shields, letting the mask settle firmly. After what must’ve been several minutes, he finally moved again, although he felt like he was in a trance. He reached the drawing room, slipped in quietly, set the bottle of firewhisky down in front of Remus, and left, ignoring the worried look Remus gave him.
Neville frowned a little, but replied, “It was good. Well, as good as it could be under the circumstances—the news weren’t really encouraging throughout, were they, with all those disappearances; to think that Gran got me a new wand just a couple days before Ollivander went missing. I don’t know what I would’ve done if he’d been gone already! But look, it’s cherry and Unicorn hair.” He held out his wand for Harry to inspect. “Otherwise we barely left the house all summer, I’ve only really seen Luna, and even her only twice. How about you? Have you been in touch with anyone from the DA?”
Draco swallowed visibly as the significance of it seemed to dawn on him, still staring at Harry. Neither of them spoke and Harry’s insides coiled up tighter and tighter as seconds ticked by, until Draco
With a start, he realised that Snape was waiting for him to respond, and he nodded quickly. “Yes, sir,” he mumbled, dropping his eyes to his lap, where he’d twisted his fingers together tightly, fidgeting with the hem of his robes.
Harry couldn’t hide his grin any longer. He watched with delight as Slughorn filled another, ever so slightly smaller vial with Felix Felicis, sealed it, and handed it to Draco, while giving the original prize to Harry.
He began to recall memories to entertain himself, some recent, but most from his time at Hogwarts. James and Sirius bickering. McGonagall berating them for one of their pranks. Working on the Marauder’s Map. He was just sinking into the comfort of his own mind, when a knock sounded on his door.
It was a very strange feeling, a mixture of a pulling sensation paired with a warm tingle spreading out from his chest. The glowing shape in front of him was blindingly bright and
Without thinking about it, Harry reached out to him, squeezing his hand quickly before letting go again.
Potter just scowled and tried to side-step him, only to be shoved back again. His green eyes flashed dangerously and Draco knew that if he didn’t get the upper hand
I mentioned this idea of Severus walking in on Remus in the bathtub, because they share a bathroom with two doors, in passing. REALLY only in passing, but Alex latched on to it and made me pinky promise to write it, even if it was just a short filler-chapter. I tried to include some minor plot as well and it somehow turned out a bit more sexual than intended (whops).
“Vince and Greg aren’t particularly articulate company,” he said bitterly. “We only spend so much time together because we’ve known each other since we were children. We’re not really friends as much as they need someone to tell them what to do, since their fathers never bothered to teach them how to think for themselves.”
Ron on the other hand was most excited about Harry being Quidditch Captain, and Harry got the distinct impression that his best friend was actively avoiding to bring up anything that could even remotely be related to Draco or Severus. He even avoided asking how Harry was doing.
“It’s an invitation to have lunch in compartment C,” he replied, “from a certain Professor Slughorn.” He looked up at the group. “Anyone know who that’s supposed to be?”
human contact already. How he had survived those twelve years when Sirius had been gone was beyond him. He’d never had lasting relationships in that time, but casual sex just didn’t compare to truly knowing someone you were intimate with. His best times had been when he had somewhat stable affairs with people he could genuinely like and meet up with around the full moon. But eventually, he’d always felt guilty about it. Like he was somehow lying to them, even if he truly liked them. So, it had always ended with him breaking it off. If he was completely honest with himself, he didn’t want someone just to fuck, despite all his urges. If anything, he’d want a true friend, like Sirius had been. And if he could fuck that friend, all the better, as long as it wouldn’t destroy the friendship. He’d rather fight his urges than risk a true friend, given how hard those were to come by.
Severus had to control himself to not let his reignited anger from earlier show. “Yes, quite. Did you need anything?”
Harry blinked in surprise. He hadn’t even considered that the Malfoy family might have more than one house-elf when he’d freed Dobby.
It was over comparably quickly, and Harry got out of his armchair, settled at the desk, then summoned Kreacher for tea. Maybe he was actually getting used to the elf, he was certainly becoming less squeamish about actually using his services.
He also spent more time with Severus than he had before, one of the few things that would separate him from Draco, usually sitting in the drawing room for a glass of wine—Harry was slowly getting used to the taste of it—and a game of chess, which Harry almost always lost in the beginning. They talked about all sorts of things—healing, spell-crafting, Harry’s mother, Order business, the competence or incompetence of Hogwarts teachers, his plans for the DA in the upcoming term—and Harry felt increasingly at home in Severus’ presence.
Draco suppressed an amused snort when Severus brought up non-verbal spells. Harry was going to absolutely love this. Admittedly, Draco was rather looking forward to it as well. With Harry’s encouragement he’d begun to try non-verbal magic himself throughout August and had made steady progress.
He flopped back down onto the sofa next to Draco, wordlessly worming his way under Draco’s arm, snuggling into his side. Draco laughed softly, pulling Harry closer and dropping a kiss on his hair.
“Nonsense, Draco is right. You deserve your own wardrobe that fits you, and it should be properly stocked. After all, you’re now the Lord Black
“As soon as I learn who the Dark Lord has chosen, I will give you warning, as always,” Severus replied, but Albus shook his head.
The expression on Slughorn’s face was priceless—it was clear that he did not want to give away any more of the golden potion. He warred with himself for several seconds, then visibly deflated.
“Any particular reason you’re adding a second bedroom in your private quarters? Or have you decided to switch it up a little for yourself?” Her eyes were full of glee; she knew
Relief washed over Harry as he once again escaped the kitchen. Maybe this time he’d actually get to look into some of the books in that library.
“Merlin,” Draco breathed, reaching backwards to sink his hands into black hair again. He felt Potter smile against his neck and his mind supplied the image, making his heart skip a beat again. Gods, how had he ended up here? Was this the universe’s reward for defying the Dark Lord? Because if yes, he’d defy a thousand Dark Lords if he could just keep having this, having Potter.
However, by the beginning of lunchtime Ron was still barely half done with his homework and his mood had plummeted drastically. Harry’s efforts to help him had been mostly unsuccessful, and there was little he could do at this point short of writing it for Ron himself. This was probably what Hermione had felt like for the past five years with both of them. Maybe he should apologise to her for that.
Draco inhaled sharply when Harry nipped at his ear, and his voice was a little wobbly when he replied, “You. Speaking Parseltongue.”
Severus snapped back out of his shock. “You don’t seriously believe that I’m Potter’s father?! That’s utterly ridiculous!” he cried, but Minerva just smiled and shrugged.
Minerva choked on her drink. Severus waited patiently for her to catch her breath, lightly pounding his hand on her back.
It was only when Remus cleared his throat behind them with a soft-spoken “Boys” that they broke apart. Harry tried to catch his breath, clinging on to Draco like a life-line.
The image of Bellatrix playing with two silver daggers as she stalked towards them in the Hall of Prophecy flashed through Harry’s mind. Of course Bellatrix would have cursed daggers, but why would she be allowed to harm Severus? He ranked above her as far as Harry knew.
was undeniably handsome; all slender, lean muscle and unrealistically pale skin. Harry’s gaze wandered upwards over Draco’s neck to his face.
He took a deep breath to calm himself again, to temper the boiling rage in his gut. Debating with Albus was usually fruitless, and despite his outrage on Harry’s behalf, the matter of this curse was not one that could be left for another day. Albus had to know.
Nevertheless, Draco couldn’t help but feel somewhat useless. Sure, they hadn’t been together for very long yet, and trust took time to build, but it was painfully obvious that Harry
Harry flinched violently and squeezed his eyes shut, his whole body tense. His breath came shallow and his lungs were craving more air. He needed something, anything to hold on to. Anything to distract him.
“I need you to tell me the incantation, otherwise I have to go look for worse-suited alternatives which could take ages.”
much anymore on a daily basis. But don't worry, they'll keep coming, just a little slower. I also have exams in 3 weeks and have to catch up on uni-stuff. Like, desperately.
And once again this is only half of what was supposed to be in this chapter because the middle parts turned out longer than expected.
They stayed like that for long moment, before Narcissa slowly extracted herself out of Harry’s arms, causing Severus to move away again. She looked at Harry, her eyes red from crying, and gave him a sad smile.
“Terribly,” Harry quipped back, but Draco could tell that it wasn’t purely sarcastic. “Weren’t you reading a book about advanced transfiguration last week?”
For the next few hours, Harry busied himself with unpacking his trunk and writing letters to Ron and Hermione. He couldn’t tell them where he was since he wasn’t the Secret Keeper for the Fidelius charm, but he assured them that he was safe before launching into an explanation of what he had learnt about his parentage since waking up. He avoided mentioning Narcissa though, unsure of how his friends would take the revelation that he was living under one roof with Malfoys. They’d probably worry enough about the whole James-is-not-my-father business.
Severus shook his head. No, so far they had stayed in the safe confinements of academic conversations.
“They didn’t do anything to me, and you should know that I can throw off an Imperius. If you would just let me explain—”
Narcissa laughed softly, and she must’ve signalled her permission somehow, because there were once again steps coming up the stairs, without halting this time, until they stopped right in front of Remus’ room. For a moment, nothing happened. Then, very slowly, the door was pushed open, revealing the silhouette of a noticeably tense Draco Malfoy. Remus heard him inhale sharply, as he took in the scene before him, with Harry curled up against Remus’ side, the large wolf wrapped around him protectively.
Reluctantly, Draco cracked open an eye, glancing up at Harry. His black hair was a mess, almost as bad as it used to be when he’d been under all those charms, and his eyes were still half-lidded. He was gorgeous. And apparently dead-set on getting out of bed. Rolling his eyes, Draco relented.
It didn’t take long until he felt his orgasm build. Harry broke their kiss to suck on his neck instead, making Draco gasp.
He had been thinking about this nonstop since their encounter on the train. Harry’s hands tangled in his hair.
Feeling guilty, he pulled out some parchment and began to write, only to feel stuck immediately. What the hell was he supposed to tell them? He couldn’t very well break the news that he was Severus Snape’s son in a bloody
“The Mark, he’s calling us. Fuck,” Severus swore. He gave Remus an apologetic look, bent down and kissed him quickly. “I have to go.”
So, I’ve actually debated whether to play their relationship this way or not. Usually, there’s sort of that middle step of friends between the fighting and the snogging—I decided to skip that and have a true enemies-to-lovers jump, because these two are all or nothing with each other.
“I’m doing rather well,” Draco continued, turning on a burner and setting his cauldron on top. “Even better now that Harry isn’t half-depressed anymore.” He shot Severus a mild glare and his godfather cringed slightly. “Not particularly looking forward to going to school if I’m completely honest. I like it here, I wish we could just stay.”
Sirona asked, ignoring his correction as she wound up Harry’s arm and eventually came to hold her head in front of his face, looking at him expectantly with glittering prismatic eyes.
Ron gaped at him and Hermione’s eyebrows rose almost all the way to her hairline, but Harry’s attention was on Draco’s reaction. Sure, he had spent every night here since their shopping trip, and most of his clothes and toiletries had found their way into Harry’s closet and bathroom, but they had never explicitly agreed that Draco had fully moved in here.
He hadn’t expected Remus to be the type to suggest anything so emotionally detached. Something akin to disappointment welled up in him. Was that all Remus saw in him? Then again, it wasn’t like they were agreeing to just fuck and never talk otherwise. They were simply putting their friendship first, because it was undeniable that romantic feelings could complicate everything to a destructive degree. He hadn’t been in love since Lily.
“As usual, he evaded that question when I asked him. But I’d bet a hundred galleons that he’s looking for that locket — if he hasn’t found it already. Whatever reason he had to touch that cursed ring, the locket is just as important. I know it.”
“Did he…say anything? About…me?” Severus asked hesitantly. He was clearly nervous, probably expecting Remus to give him confirmation that Harry despised him.
“What is it that you remember? Or think to remember?” Remus asked, his voice low and gentle. Severus frowned as he thought about it, trying to grasp that memory again.
Draco didn’t retreat immediately as Remus had expected, given his obvious fear of werewolves. Instead he just stood there, staring at them, as if transfixed by what he saw. Harry shifted again, letting out a soft, sleepy noise, and Remus could virtually watch Draco melt.
Harry opened his mouth, but Narcissa spoke first, “Harry, would you join us for tea? I would like to get properly acquainted with my host.” Even as she spoke, she moved towards the dining room with a graceful confidence that made it seem like Harry was a guest at her house, rather than the other way around.
Lupin snorted. “We both know that’s a ridiculous accusation. You knew Lily as well as I did, she was as loyal as they come.”
“Anyway, this obviously has to stay secret,” Harry went on, “because we can’t risk Voldemort learning the truth while Severus is still acting as a spy. So, I need all of you to swear to me that you won’t tell a soul.”
Potter!” His voice was breathy and wrecked, but he couldn’t bring himself to care. Trailing kisses along his neck, Potter’s lips found their way back to his, and Draco felt himself melt.
“In a real fight it’s better to stop while you still have enough energy to apparate, rather than fighting until you’re depleted and then being stuck without a way out.”
He looked up at Lupin and their eyes locked. Lupin’s face was set in determination, and Severus was sure he was thinking along the same lines as he himself was.
Weasley said, sounding outraged. He must’ve followed Harry upstairs to talk to him. “He’s bullied all of us for five years, how many times has he thrown hexes at you? Or slurs at Hermione?”
“Yes, well, I just want you to know that you always have a place in our family, no matter what. I see you as much as my son as the rest of my children, do you understand? You can always come to us if, well, if there’s anything at all that you need.”
Harry kissed him and Draco’s mind went blank for a second, before a by now established reflex kicked in and he returned the kiss fervently. When they broke apart again they were both a little breathless.
“We’ll figure something out, I promise,” Harry reassured him, and Draco forced himself to nod against the table. “Is there anything else?”
Even at this distance, Remus could see that tell-tale flash in Harry’s eyes; the one that signalled to him that Harry was serious now. He swallowed, bracing himself.
“So,” Hermione began again as she had after leaving the robe shop, “what happened between you and Malf— Draco?”
For a moment, they just held each other’s gaze, then Draco was suddenly overcome with the urge to laugh. What the fuck had just happened? Why? How? How had Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter ended up in the basement kitchen of a Black town house
It took some effort, but he managed to coax Draco out of bed without too much pouting, the suggestion of a shared shower proving incredibly persuasive. However, by the time they’d made it into the bathroom, Narcissa’s chiming charm had already announced breakfast, which meant that there wasn’t even time for Harry to take a proper shower by himself, settling instead for a quick rinse and hopping into a pair of his new Muggle joggers, throwing on a sweatshirt and hurrying downstairs. But Harry was secretly glad, if he was completely honest with himself—the thought of being that exposed in broad daylight was more than just a little intimidating to him.
Harry laughed and nodded, before quickly slipping into the room, his eyes on Draco until the door fell closed. Only then did he turn to look at Remus’ wolf form again. Doing his best impression of Padfoot, Remus cocked his head questioningly, hoping that Harry would understand what he wanted to know. He didn’t. Or maybe he did and just wanted to avoid answering, because he said nothing at all, he merely chuckled as he settled down on Remus’ bed.
“But I do expect it from you,” Albus said, his voice now gaining an edge. “You swore an oath to me, that you would do whatever is necessary to bring Voldemort down, or have you forgotten?”
Harry rolled his eyes. “No, you git, I thought I’d bring you something. That’s what nice people do for each other.”
“Not really, just a couple of books that sound fascinating,” Harry replied. “Sirius was quite thorough when cleaning the place out.”
As the door fell closed behind him, Remus couldn’t help but feel satisfied. That had gone far better than he’d expected, and he wouldn’t have to go through a normal, mind-robbing transformation. Snatching another piece of chocolate from his room, he went to find Harry. They had a potions lab to set up.
with an unknown curse swirling around you? What if it had latched onto Harry? You know how impulsive he is,
“There we go,” said Remus’ voice, as he slowly opened his eyes. The blurry face hovering above him wore an expression of concern mixed with amusement. “He’s impressive, isn’t he?”
“The curse is contained, for now, but it will spread eventually. It will kill him with time. There’s nothing I can do.”
The portrait slid to the side before Harry could even open his mouth to respond, revealing the door to Severus’ quarters. The wards rippled as Harry stepped through them, moulding themselves around his magical signature to solidify their new configuration.
Remus pulled back his ears, worried by how venomous Harry’s words were. What was he talking about? Remus knew that Harry’s life with Lily’s sister hadn’t been very loving, but this sounded like there was more to the story. Much more. But Harry wasn’t dwelling on it, and Remus would just have to remember to ask him when he was human again.
“What I was getting at,” Harry continued after extracting himself from Draco again, propping himself up on one elbow, the other arm resting on Draco’s chest, “is that we’re going to be down there, in the same room, along with everyone else. How much do you want them to know? Because if I’m supposed to keep my hands off you that has to be a conscious decision.”
“What makes you think they won’t use the very things you teach them against you? How can you be sure they won’t betray us?” cried Zacharias Smith.
Narcissa reacted first and reached out to squeeze Harry’s hands resting on the table, fingers locked together tightly.
Severus stood, briefly inclined his head and sat back down. The hall was filled with agitated chatter now, and Severus could tell that—with the exception of the Slytherin table—the student body did not appear to be too pleased about the news. He kept his face neutral as he searched the Gryffindor table and found Harry looking right back at him, Lily’s eyes shining brightly in his son’s face, his jaw set in that particular way Severus had come to recognise as Harry trying to suppress a smile. His own expression almost slipped then, but he managed to control himself.
Grabbing Harry’s hand, Draco got up from the table and marched out of the kitchen, tugging a mildly confused but smiling Harry along behind him. Severus stared after them, incredulously.
. He wasn’t sure what to do with this revelation, especially since it was technically none of his concern. And yet, he couldn’t help but wonder what Severus must feel like, discovering that the bloody “Chosen One” was his son, while he himself served the Dark Lord—albeit unfaithfully.
“He has a point, you know,” Pansy piped up, leaning back in her seat. “You’re awfully serious all the time.”
His musings were interrupted by a tingling sensation going through his entire body, similar to someone shooting a spell against his shield charms. Alarmed, he hurried into the hallway, his hand on his wand, and found himself face to face with Snape.
Fun fact: every time I write something like implying 1AM is late I have to laugh, because chances are I’m writing it at 5AM. What even is sleep? I wish I was half as functional as my characters.
“That’s not the point, though. The point is, I do understand why you want to go up there, truly I do. You’re worried, I understand that, but please, Draco, think for a second. Do you really think Harry would appreciate you potentially interrupting a private conversation? Do you think he appreciates you being so openly afraid of someone he respects so deeply? Not that I don’t share your concern—as much as I like Remus, lycanthropy is not a thing to be taken lightly. But Harry trusts him and we shouldn’t question that. You can’t force him to leave Remus if he doesn’t want to.”
“It’s not like it comes as a surprise,” said Harry. “I am literally destined to kill a man after all.”
“I wonder what he’s like,” said Hermione for the sixth time as they walked up to the Potions classroom.
Once upon a time (read: when I started writing this fic) I said I’d probably never be comfortable to write smut, so I’d just have to keep it smut-free. Ah, how the turns have tabled. Not that I’m
Harry knew that Ron was probably struggling to accept that his best friend was not only the son of the Head of Slytherin, but also
you seemed to be. But then you chose Weasley over me, someone I’d been told was leagues beneath me, and I didn’t understand. First I was just confused, but when my father’s reaction was nothing more than flat-out disappointment, I began to resent you. I resented you and I resented Weasley and Granger, because you had something with each other that I never had: Actual friendship. I was jealous and I fucking despised all of you. So I lashed out, because if I couldn’t have
Draco’s eyes widened. The idea alone sounded terrifying, yet Harry seemed to take it rather calmly. Once more Draco was equally amazed and horrified by how used Harry was to being put in extremely dangerous positions. Reminding himself that this was only the first part according to Harry, he shoved the familiar feeling of protective worry aside.
young gentleman at a Dragon resort. She refused to tell Draco his name, however, and eventually he gave up and let her continue, only listening with one ear, his thoughts drifting back to Harry.
Minerva nodded again, then shook herself and straightened. “Well, I shall leave you to refurbishing. I’ll see you at the welcoming feast.”
It took a moment before Harry answered, “I’m worried about what it means. My connection to him is bad enough, but at least that could be explained with my scar — even if we don’t know
She narrowed her eyes at him, glanced down at her textbook, then pressed her lips into a thin line as she stubbornly continued to stir counter-clockwise only.
“I’ve never been in an actual relationship before,” Harry said. “I had this weird thing with Cho, but I kinda don’t feel like that counts, given that we had one disastrous date and barely met outside the DA other than that. I’m not even sure whether I actually liked her, or if she was just pretty and I misinterpreted that as something it wasn’t because people kept telling me I fancied her because I liked looking at her. The only other person I’ve ever had a crush on was Cedric,—”
