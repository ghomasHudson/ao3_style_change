Flushing harshly, Persephone grabbed her clean clothes and made for the bathroom. She stared herself in the mirror when she dressed in her Muggle pajamas. The other girls, save for Hermione and Amanda, were dressed in frills and silks and laces that looked old-fashioned. She decided against braiding her hair, instead of concentrating and making them look pretty.
The ghost huffed, “Why do you care for my name?” Persephone, unable to answer for she was gasping in pain, doubled over, “No one cares about my name—I know what they call me. Miserable, moping, moaning Myrtle.”
Persephone breaks boundaries and is acting very OOC...wonder why?
Thomas looked at her, nodding, before turning to Uncle Vernon, “Well, seeing as you put up a very convincing case and I can see you are a family man, I feel as if though I have no other choice but to order with you.”
Hermione looked away when she caught her eye, looking irritated. It didn’t seem like Ron was having much luck.
‘Red thread?’ She mouthed to herself and started looking. It was much too dark to see much of anything but she navigated, moving up aisles well above the floor below. How was she to find a red thread? How small was that?
"Listen, Sephie, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts." He did still look a bit sick.
"Bet you could," Ron muttered.
"What world? Magician’s world?"
Was it possible that he needed this book quickly, not because he was impatient, but because he would suffer the consequences of the full moon as a…a…
“Wait…Slytherin? That’s a Hogwarts house?” Persephone asked.
The thought of so many people hating her—for something as manipulative as house points—made her chest hurt. Even the Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs had turned against her, because Slytherin was now in first place and no one wanted that, from any house but Slytherin. She was being insulted outright in the halls, being pointed at and laughed at and at some during Herbology, while George told someone off, she felt her chest clasp and tighten and she found herself unable to breathe. Her vision came in and out in black spots and she suddenly couldn’t feel her legs.
“I don’t think I’d like to abuse my friendship with Daphne like this.” She told her. Hermione exhaled impatiently.
‘Wouldn’t you know everything about me already, being in my head?’ She pondered.
The girls followed Audrey up the spiral staircase of one of the towers, until they reached the dorm rooms. “Here we have the dorms. There are several dorms for each year, and each dorm has usually five or six people in them. You will have the same dorm for the rest of the year and any changes made should be passed by your prefect, so me. Ah, here we are. You girls will be the top dorm, as the seventh years have now graduated,” She muttered, pulling on a paper, “And this will be the dorm of,” She read off a list. “Lavender Brown, Hermione Granger, Parvati Patil, Persephone Potter, Amanda Steindberg and Renetta Vander Woodsen.”
She barely remembered what she’d planned that night to get him back with. She’d be fully supportive of him even sending her hate mail right now, just to insure everything had truly happened.
“You better hope I don’t put bars on your windows!” As she said this, a little figure walked into the room, cried out and ran out.
“Be sure to always wear the green one, with the L, then, for
giant, at least. That much was visible—he looked very tall and very strong, strong enough to lift all the Dursley’s with one hand. He did have a beard, though it was wild and tangled and blended in with his long, shaggy mane of hair on his head. His face was almost completely hidden by his wild hair but she could make out his eyes—black and warm, glinting like black beetles under all the hair. He did not even have a trident—Persephone would have been disappointed if she weren’t terrified.
“Do not call me Red—unless you want me to call you—Black!” She fumed. She was seriously not liking this boy.
The rest of the day was spent quietly—everyone seemed not to want to trigger another, er, episode (?) so her day was spent with the boys. She helped Ron every time he came in with a question about homework and then she helped Ron through his remaining homework.
"Hm, interesting offer—let me think about that—no.” He said with a deadpan voice. “I think instead I’ll leave it out somewhere for Longbottom to find—how about—up a tree?"
“I—I locked the door, I’m sure of it!” Persephone whispered to her, moving silently, to be right next to her, turned around to stare at the door.
Worse than that, first day of lessons also meant first time navigating the castle. It was rumoured that Hogwarts had a hundred and forty-two staircases. Not only were they tricky to navigate—some had a vanishing step halfway up and others you had to climb two at a time—but they moved. The staircases moved very often and this would prove very annoying, as Seamus Finnigan was its first victim of the day, nearly making him late to Charms.
Hermione was not as impressed, “Don’t sirens…drown men?”
“Now, now, it’s Thomas, no sirs,” He told her, smiling once more. She smiled gratefully.
“Not really,” She sniffed. “So…what does happen to you? During the full moon, I mean?”
“Hagrid, you understand how much the dragon has grown, don’t you?” She started hesitantly.
Rehearsals dragged on—she bumped into Quirrell and Snape, which earned her a stammering apology and dark look from them respectively. She still had no idea what either of them did there but she had thoroughly been able to ignore them. She found her regular spot with Cedric and Susan, the former studying lines and the latter re-braiding her hair. Cedric gave her a wave while she and Susan gave each other kisses on the cheek. She loved Susan and all her formal greetings.
Almost like trouble followed her, a bat came up from behind her, scaring her out of her wits as it soared above her. She dropped her bag and yelped out, her heart soaring. She stared up at the bat, perching up on a window frame down the hall.
“Salazar, please!” Rowena Ravenclaw scolded. Salazar Slytherin had blonde hair slicked back with green eyes and a look that told Persephone he had enough of his painting companions.
“Oh…” She was sure there was no way the mirror could have been damaged… “Well, you nearly were. He almost got the stone—”
Cedric blushed and stuttered something like, “Not like that—barely know her.”
“Quitting?” She snorted, “Why would I quit. The letter says,” She made a grab for it but he held it out of her reach.
She immediately looked to the oldest looking boy, being the tallest, nodded a sort of grimace and smile to her and proceeded to march toward platforms nine and ten. (His name was Percy!) Persephone watched, careful not to blink, still shaking from the strange feeling of adrenaline coursing through her veins. And then, just as he would have crashed into the wall, he disappeared into it.
"You—Weasley—why didn't you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he'd make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That's another five points you've lost for Gryffindor."
“Are you okay?” Cedric said somewhere very far away.
She sniffled, “I’ve never seen it.”
“It’s a list that was published anonymously in the 1930s with twenty-nine families that made the cut as truly pureblooded in Great Britain,” He explained. “It’s families everyone know, like Abbott, Black, Greengrass, Lestrange, Longbottom, Malfoy, Nott, Ollivander, Parkinson, Prewett, Slughorn, Weasley,” She was happy that she recognized the names he listed, though it may be because he was listing the names he knew she would recognized.
"It's too late to change the plan now," Persephone told Hermione. "There isn’t any time. This is our only chance to get rid of Norbert. We have the cloak and that’s an advantage.” She said. “We haven't got time to send Charlie another owl, and this could be our only chance to get rid of Norbert. We'll have to risk it. And we have got the invisibility cloak, Malfoy doesn't know about that."
Ron was up and he bounded to meet her at the bottom of the girls’ staircase, “I’m starved,” He told her. “Do you remember the way to the Great Hall because I don’t fancy getting lost while this hungry.”
Hermione had come back the day before term had started and Persephone finally felt better about being in the dorms. When she recounted the holidays to her in great detail, Hermione was torn between horror at the idea of Persephone being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row ("If Filch had caught you!"), and disappointment that she hadn't at least found out who Nicolas Flamel was.
"So why did he just try and kill Lily?" Hermione cried.
“Jesus, what did I just walk in on?” Hades suddenly ducked in, looking around. Just then, as she turned from facing Draco, Crabbe roughly shoved Ron, who had tried raising his wand. However, when he pushed Ron, he flew into Persephone, who lost her footing and fell backwards, right into the fountain.
“And she was in love with Charlie’s older brother, Bill, weren’t you, D?” Tonks grinned, leaning into the conversation.
“But how did you get to Diagon Alley last year if not by floo powder?” Mr. Weasley asked.
Persephone had to watch her step as she walked, for she was so taken by the spacious halls and moving pictures, some of which waved at them as they passed. There were elaborate suits of armour she was sure could move but did not try to find out—she’d seen Scooby-Doo enough times to know the end to that fatal story. Persephone, not truly in her right of mind at the moment, raised a weak hand and waved back at a nearby portrait only to bump into a tall, black boy as the entire group stopped. She blushed as he glanced back at her but she did not dare apologize as the woman spoke,
“Aw, Perce—”
“Um, what?” Persephone asked, sitting awkwardly between the two.
“Can I get in on this?” Justin interrupted anxiously. “Because I know you’re the best in our year at Transfiguration and I could seriously use some help.”
“By telling me my understudy is better than me?” She sniffled, looking away. She would not cry in front of anyone in this production. It was embarrassing enough to be told off by the stage director every few minutes.
“What’s wrong with her?” She heard Ron question Hermione.
“I see myself as a grownup—I’m a potions master and I’m the—the headmaster of the school.” Did that sound realistic enough? “And I’ve gotten taller.” She did want to be taller, so that did sound realistic enough.
Something very painful was going on in Persephone’s mind. The picture she painted of her parents, good and kind as Hagrid described them, was overruled by the blinding flash of green light, more clearly than she had ever remembered it before—and she remembered something else, for the first time in her life: a high, cold, cruel laugh. Her eyes stung for just a moment.
She decided to sit out on the courtyard steps. There was not much to do but wait. And it was windier today, thank god. She sat, her eyes closed, trying her hardest not to panic with everything she’d uncovered. She tried to just focus on the wind through her hair. She was breathing too fast to be relaxing so she tried to slow that down.
She hooked her leg up and pulled herself up on top of the bookshelf. She stood up and tried her best not to look down. She was high up—surely she could find a way out without falling, right?
He hummed, glancing back at her. His eyes glinted darkly and she couldn’t quite make out the color. “I’m not sure.”
Strangely enough, Hogwarts didn’t teach wandless magic. It was strange, shouldn’t school teach them about those different sorts of magic? She simply didn’t understand it.
But today, on Dudley’s birthday, was not a day she would catch a glimpse of a slightly nice Aunt Petunia.
"Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die. Some say he's still out there, bidin' his time, like, but I don' believe it. People who was on his side came back ter ours. Some of 'em came outta kinda trances. Don’ reckon they could've done if he was comin' back.
He tightened the jar lid, “Your skin will be really dry to the point of peeling off layers of skin, inflammation and shitty rashes—” She gasped, “So like, make a moisturizer out of this will you?”
"Ready, are you?"
“Oh, you’re coming, then?” She asked, surprised. She didn’t take cat boy to like parties.
But just as she turned away, she heard the scream build. It kept screaming, and it was getting louder! No—no! The shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, ear-splitting, growing louder and louder—she started to back out of the shelves when she heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside.
She was just about to be put into Slytherin—she wasn’t brave, she was
Persephone didn’t dare breathe, wishing with her entire being that Snape would go easy on her, that he wouldn’t expel her on the spot.
He laughed, “Well, it wasn’t what I expected—”
Of course, this is when she realized that she was naked. At the moment, however, she was half fish but the human part was most definitely naked. The girl noticed her embarrassment immediately but only smiled, “I can see the Narlges got to you.”
Another thing about Persephone’s appearance was that she had a very thin scar on her forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. She had had it as long as she could remember, and the first question she could ever remember asking her Aunt Petunia was how she had gotten it. Aunt Petunia had no answer, and set the rule that she was not allowed to ask further questions.
“Wait, this would be Draco Malfoy as in” George turned around to look at her, “Lucius Malfoy’s son?”
He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there.
Eventually, come as they may, Hermione started descending into studying as well. She drew up color coded study guides for Persephone and Ron, which was insulting to Persephone. Persephone refused to study in the common room, as to disrupt the usual peace and comfort she could find there with studying, so she listened to Ron and Hermione nag.
“Jeez!” Fred cried, holding his eye, “Watch where you throw that hair of yours!”
Persephone found this hilarious and blushed at the cheering. She turned to Hermione, “Want to?”
“Why?” She raised a new brow at her. Hermione glanced at her forehead and made an ‘oh’ sound. “Do I look like a Veronica?”
They weren't in a room, as she had originally thought. They were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew
"Can't a person eat in peace in this place?" Ron said, throwing her an exasperated eye roll. Persephone rolled her eyes at his theatrics.
Percy straightened, “Well, as prefect—and your brother—I’m coming with you to make sure nothing stupider happens tonight.”
“Who is?” Persephone asked, confused.
He stared at her dumbly before shaking his head, looking positively terrified.
He looked over to her, confused, “What?”
Persephone, confused as to how she was supposed to respond to this, said, “I guess…?”
Everything around her registered with her—the ghoul in the attic, every creak of movement in the rooms around in the house—Percy was still up, she could hear a quill scratching out something on parchment. Ron was finally asleep. Then—Fred, she could tell was asleep. George, however, was not.
“Doesn’t matter,” He coughed. “Just a late thank you present. Got a lovely Christmas gift last Chrismas, a nice sweater, and thought I’d repay the sentiment.”
“Don’t be,” He leaned into his hair and he looked just as tired as she felt. “I was born the way I am—so it feels longer than it probably is.”
Lockhart gripped the top of the white cover and warned them, “I must ask you not to scream. It might provoke them.”
“Lily Potter’s daughter, then!” Mrs. Weasley said, gesturing to Persephone, who smiled sheepishly and waved.
Persephone was quick to offer her help, “I’ll help them—I’m not that tired.”
. The glasses she had picked out were supposed to adapt to the first person it wore’s eyesight and it had to hers. Her hand was so…
It seemed like an impossible situation—either way, she could never question herself again. But what could she do now?
He was still staring at his pet bird, “A most handsome creature, isn’t he?”
"It's not funny. And look after Ron."
Hermione straightened, pulling herself slightly together, “You are—the most brilliant witch of this century—if not now, than you will be. And…and you’re my best friend.”
“I’d be giving her what she wants,” She’d said.
When she nodded, Daphne gasped, “How horrid! Not knowing magic at all!”
“Oh, Lily, I am grateful you will be at the funeral,” She told Persephone, holding both her hands. “I am ashamed to admit these occasions draw on far too long.”
“He is…the best person I know,” She said, slowly grasping at what the words could possibly mean.
She wasn’t sure what she was doing but she remembered screaming and tearing curtains off the beds and throwing books around. The violence coursed through her veins so powerfully that every part of her hurt—hurt so bad. She felt like she was on fire and no matter how had she threw things or kicked chests over, nothing lamented the desire for violence. It was only when she turned her attention to Salem, who had streaked across the room to the bathroom that she broke down—truly and really broke down.
"You all right, Sephie? Yer very quiet," said Hagrid.
Professor Snape looked up at her cry, because she had interrupted him telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs. Just as he did so, clouds of acid green smoke, accomapgnied with a dangerous sounding loud hissing noise filled the dungeon. “Get away from the cauldron before it—” Persephone cried as the worst happened.
She had a thought of mind—she changed her lip shape and thinned out her long, normally arched eyebrows to a darker black color. She smiled at herself—how strange…but pretty…hm. She looked like…a Veronica.
CRASH.
"An' as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I'd like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. D'yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can't get rid of her—Fitch puts her up to it."
“Oh, Mum—”
“Very!” She called, probably too loudly but she couldn’t freaking see! “Thank you!”
Persephone’s help was greatly appreciated and so this was how she found herself walking down the hall, levitating a tall pile of books in front of her. It seemed her powers had strengthen—she only needed one hand to levitate the heavy books up in the air and she had a free hand to eat a slice of toast.
“Be sure to speak very, very clearly, dear, else you’ll pop out the wrong grate,” Mrs. Weasley told her as she watched with fascination as George vanished too.
“Ow…” She rubbed her eyes as Mr. Ollivander laughed with glee.
She finally slowed, her heart beating wildly. Where had she gone? She could no longer hear the screaming—but the large suit of armor in front of her didn’t make sense. She recognized it immediately as the one near the kitchens, but it didn’t look like the basement. No pear painting in sight.
Persephone nodded. “I’ve never changed the way I look—I like the way I look a lot, mainly because I look like my mum. And I know it sounds like I’m lying, but my eyes are naturally like that as well. I usually only just play around with my hair,” She turned her hair black, then blonde, then its natural red while Hermione watched, her mouth opened. “And my friend once tweezed my eyebrows, and I’ve kept them like that since…what is it?”
Daphne looked at Hermione, a slow smile drawing on her beautiful face, “And you are…?”
Where they came out was entirely different. Daphne and Astoria were having their robes being taken by two men, one stout and the other tall, both dressed in the same servant’s clothing. She allowed for her own robe to be taken from her shoulders and strayed closer to the blonde girl. She felt suddenly sheepish, but reminded herself she had a task: at some point she had to get Hades alone to ask of him a favor.
Hagrid didn’t seem irritated at her question asking, so she asked, "But what does a Ministry of Magic do?"
It was the final book on the list. Thankfully, too, because she was starting to get a headache. She retraced her steps back and found that the labyrinth had changed in the time she had spent but then she saw that it was a brick wall, and not a shelf. Was this a wall of the library or simply a dead end?
“Not everyone wants to be in Gryffindor, Seph,” He rolled his eyes, his eyes returning to the book.
“Wasn’t hard to guess,” She pursed her lips, “This is your grandfather’s funeral, so shouldn’t your father’s relatives be here as well?”
“Well, I don’t mean to alarm you but you’re showing signs of hyperthyroidism, which could also be a symptom of hyperreflexia…tell me, do you have aches in your joints? Any rashes? Any muscles spasms, or weaknesses? Headaches of any sort, thirstiness all the time, fevers, perhaps even some confusion here and there? Trouble concentrating?”
“If you were to run at him, would he catch you?” Fred asked out of ear shot.
For those who take, but do not earn,
“Excuse me?” Persephone raised a brow, taking a step back.
"Can't stay long, Mother," he said. "I'm up front, the prefects have got two compartments to themselves--"
Fred brought the car lower, and Persephone saw a dark patchwork of fields and clumps of trees.
"Oh! No, go ahead," She said swiftly, much too tired and lost in her thoughts to know what she had just agreed to. Much to her pleasure, Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again and tapped it twice on the side of the boat. Persephone watched, entranced, and they sped off toward land.
“Am I clear to you, Miss Potter?” She asked, most seriously. “These symptoms are nothing to be pushed aside for, especially not for Quidditch.”
“Almost.” She said. “I’d say we have thirty minutes. What did Fred and George tell you?”
“Blow, dear—only one will withstand to be your wand wood.” Mr. Ollivander urged, looking eager to see the results. “Go on!”
McGonagall looked worse than Persephone felt. There was simply nothing wrong with her! Madame Pomfrey shared a look with Dumbledore, who took his leave with her. She thought Snape would feel good that she had privileges taken away but even he looked concerned.
“Are you su—”
trying out for Dorothy,” She told him in a manner of fact, “And who would you be trying out for? You know you’d make a good flying monkey, hm?”
gods—why not an O, for Olympus, rather an H?
(See the end of the chapter for
She frowned, “You don’t need to be prefects to be recognizable as brilliant,” She told them, throwing both legs over one side of the broom. “You two are ingeniously funny—notice my use of ingeniously,” She told them, smiling.
A lot of what was written about ancient magic was about being level with magic. Wandless, non-verbal magic is so advanced because of the respect held for the magic. The books talked about magic as if it were a living being that simply needed a heart, a soul and a mind. She understood that much—magic depended on a user’s vital force to be able to be used properly but at the same time, it was also a force more ancient than humans. It recognized when it was used with disrespect and sometimes simply didn’t work for it. It was why some wand cores were affected by its owner’s mood. Some magic need a very specific life force but it all came down to respect.
"You don't know that you'll be bad," Ron tried to reason, "I hope Malfoy is bad, though. He’s always going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet that's all talk."
Persephone was also tasked with growing the festoons of holly and mistletoe all around the halls, to grow the reefs as well, after she finished with decorating the trees. The trees looked magnificent—some, had tiny, pretty and detailed icicles on them, while others had hundreds of candles, while others she had enchanted the ornaments to have a sort of lightshow, as if snow was falling around the Great Hall. Persephone could agree with herself—Hogwarts was best during Christmas time.
Narcissa Malfoy stood very tall compared to Persephone, and she wasn’t even wearing that tall of a heel.
Ron groaned.
It didn’t matter where it was, or how ominous this statement was, because she wouldn’t be opening any chamber, especially not one that would end up killing muggleborns, or anyone for that matter.
She stood up, glaring at them. “I hope you're pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed—or worse,
“Saved you a spot,” Hades nodded to the seat by him when he caught her eye. He barely looked up from his textbook, and she clenched her jaw.
“Maybe it has something to do with the stone?” Hermione said thoughtfully.
“Moon phases matter in wand making—well, for specific wand woods, I mean.” He said. They were headed to the Forbidden Forest. Did she trust him not to kill her? She was not sure yet. “It’s a new moon tonight.”
“Willing…to what?” She asked slowly. She was starting to become frustrated. “Are you sure maybe another wand isn’t—”
“Dobby…I can’t, I would be lying and I’ve already deceived you once, please don’t—”
She’d found a place, during her Potions class. She asked to use the laboratory, and found the bathroom in the dungeons—it was cold but clean and there was a space in the very back that was lit by a torch, a little space that wasn’t needed. She thought she could find someplace better but it was secluded and quiet here.
“I’m ‘ere to get you yer things, ‘o course! Fer Hogwarts—yeh'll know all about Hogwarts, o' course.”
“What’s going on in here?” Just as though they sensed the tense air, the twins were back, looking over Goyle and Crabe’s heads. They took in the situation, and perhaps they misread it, but they took in Malfoy glaring in her direction and stepped in, “Hey, what are you picking on girls for?”
while Hermione cast a sound proofing spell on the bed. No one would hear them.
She pulled away and started up towards the sky to glide over the castle quietly, watching as Snape disappeared into the forest. She followed quickly, but it was no use—she lost Snape in the thick trees.  . She flew in the direction she thought he would have been going through but stopped short when she heard voices. She lowered herself close enough into a tree branch, her weight barely moving the thick branch.
The next day, at the very first dance class, she was getting changed in the dance changing rooms. She was wearing a ¾ sleeved black colored leotard with one of the wrap skirts Cedric had gifted her some time ago. She was nervous to see him in class, as he had not gotten a chance to say what he had obviously wanted to say to her the other day. She couldn’t help thinking it was simply a sick prank but she knew better—or she hoped better.
He made a face, "If that's your definition of hero, Percy."
She looked away, “There’s no proof of that.”
Draco puffed out his chest as well, taking in the scene of three older boys standing against him, before doing the right smart thing and signalling for his large friends to move out.
Unfortunately, coming into the classroom found all three of those people sitting and talking amongst the other Slytherins. Hermione and Ron shared a look while Persephone smiled widely as Daphne waved to her, “Lily! Sit here!”
Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck. Before she could drown herself in the words of how being ghost defied several laws of anatomy, he coughed, and said, "So—new Gryffindors! I hope you're going to help us win the house championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron's becoming almost unbearable—he's the Slytherin ghost."
But worse—the full moon would be three days after Christmas. She wasn’t all too sure how to go about it alone but she planned on finding a way into the lake and escape to the room of requirement. If he were there—than she would allow for herself to kill him and blame the moon.
"No, no we need to know something Hagrid, please, do you remember the night you won Norbert. Did you, by any chance, mention Hogwarts at all?”
She snickered, “No.”
Persephone pulled out her notebook, scribbling quickly a message
"Now, don't ask me anymore," said Hagrid gruffly. "That's top secret, that is."
“Sorry but what’s curious?” She finally spoke up.
Persephone huffed, “There are too many stereotypes surrounding girls. Some girls hate skirts and dresses and that’s fine. Some girls like being friends with boys and that’s fine too. It’s fine either way—other girls bullying girls for that is not fine. Girls should support girls—”
“Yes, he is an adamant volunteer in the hospital wing, has he not told you?"
She rolled her eyes, “I’m not terminally ill, Ron.” She knew better than to think she was ill. She was a siren, and that obviously gave off some very strange symptoms. “Trust me.”
“So—” Ben wheezed, “You must be the Weasley twins.”
Oh, she did not miss her uncle. He hadn’t changed, at all.
Suddenly, a deep crack came, and then another, and then another. At the sound, she froze. She was invisible, yes, but that didn’t make her instinct to hide any less logical. The sound seemed to be coming from all direction, and then was accompanied by a rustle of what sounded like chains.
“Close proximity to our destination,” He told her. She slid off his back as soon as he stopped and he let her go. The drop to the ground was farther than she’d anticipated and she let out a gasp.
She smiled.
He chuckled, and she gulped.
"Follow me, you two," said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Persephone.
“Well Lily definitely thinks I’m cuter,” Fred said accusingly, turning to Persephone. “Right?”
"Now that we’re on the topic,” Persephone said casually, “We were actually wondering about something—other than Cerberus, what’s there protecting the Philoso—”
“Hey! PHONEY!” She jumped, looking wildly at her cousin. “Pass the frying pan.” He smirked, belching loudly.
Maybe, she thought wildly, maybe she didn’t fit into any of the house—maybe there had been some mistake and she just did not belong in Hogwarts at all. Maybe this was one terrible mistake—but how would that explain her weird powers? Her scar? Her….parents?
“Sorry what was that?”
While reframing from calling out ‘snitches get stiches’, she pushed open the portrait of the Fat lady and climbed through the hole.
Wood's expression changed from puzzlement to delight.
Behind the white pieces they could see another door.
“Where is the car now?” He asked after listening silently to her story. She felt something of relief in her chest—he believed her!
She thought about Hagrid’s presence in the dragon section f the library and put two and two together.
Those cunning folk use any means
Of course, no one was interested in the story of what had actually happened, so Persephone gave up trying to explain.
"Malfoy," he responded shakily. "I met him outside the library. He said he'd been looking for someone to practice that on."
Their way back to the common room was interrupted by Neville, who was scrambling passed them, not seeing them invisible, of course.
“Mum’s always wishing we had a house-elf to do the ironing,” George said. “All we’ve got is a lousy old ghoul that lives in the attic and then gnomes in the garden that won’t go away.”
Charlie's friends were a cheery lot. Persephone was especially drawn to the one with bubble gum pink hair and the other one with dark curls, until she realize who it was—“Diana!”
Persephone could tell she was baiting her on, to tease her behind her back probably, but Persephone smiled kindly, “I know English, obviously, and Spanish, French, Latin, Greek, though more Ancient than modern and I’m learning Italian right now.”
"Er—all right." He said at once.
the love of her life, after all.”
Ron let go of the front of Malfoy's robes.
"I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks."
“Persephone Potter must say she’s not going back to school—”
“Hm,” She nodded, looking at them. The image depicted had what looked like green skin—definitnly what she had seen in the lake that day. “So…why Mediterranean? The warmest ocean is in fact the Indian, isn’t it?”
He was confused, ruffling his tie, squinting up at the sky. “But…miss…I swear….”
"Coming, Mom." She sighed in relief as they hopped off the train, with a last look at Persephone.
“Ouuuuu,” Fred and George both made kissy sounds and Ben shoved them.
She blushed furiously as she realized Ben had probably been rushing off because he’d given her a gift on Valentine’s Day.
Persephone was well rehearsed in spotting the signs that she may need to take cover in case of one of his surprise tantrums. She was also well rehearsed in never showing any signs of emotion around her family. Should her uncle find any trace of some emotion other than blank, she would have the wind knocked out of her very quickly.
“Not in front of the entire dance department!”
“Every young wizard should have an affinity to dance, I made sure of this point when we received him,” Narcissa Malfoy finally looked at her. Persephone did not enjoy how she spoke of Hades like a package in the mail. “Do tell me, how long have you been dancing?”
She had to admit—even she knew she was paranoid. She jumped at every sound and couldn’t keep herself in one place. Suddenly, everything Ben had told her was very prominent in her everyday life. Her breaking point came a lot quicker than the last time.
“Valiant and bold! Persephone Potter has braved already so many dangers that Dobby has come to protect her from another danger, a terrible danger! Persephone must not go back to Hogwarts.”
“Right!” She huffed hautghily. “Like I would believe you—Slytherins are the only ones who ever come in here, to mock me and throw things at me. I hate Slytherins, the last one got me killed!” She wailed and turned to dive into a toilet.
He raised both his brows.
“Oh my—are you okay?!” She gasped in horror and confusion, offering her hand, but then as he took it, a sharp light appeared and he jumped and she pulled her hand back sharply, “I’m sorry! I’m so sorry, I have a thing and I can’t really not do that, and I’m sorry!”
It was a small bedroom with a large window. There was a large, worn bed that took up most of the space with yellow bedding with small flowers printed on it and several pillows of different sizes, like they were extras from around the house. She glanced out the window—it was a gorgeous view of the orchard.
“Just Muggle-baiting,” Mr. Weasley sighed. “Sell them a key that keeps shrinking to nothing so they can never find it when they need it…Hard to convict anyone if no Muggle will confess their keys keeps shrinking. Bless their hearts, Muggles will go far to ignore magic, even if it’s staring them in the face…But the things our lot have taken to enchanting, you wouldn’t believe—”
Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.
“My god—Snape is
"She’s small, too,” Wood said, completely distracted and staring at her. “Light and easy on a broom, speed shouldn’t an issue,” He suddenly reached out and she flinched back, “And sharp, too.” He turned to McGonagall, “We'll have to get her a decent broom, Professor—a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I'd say."
Benjamin kicked the guy in the back hard enough to knock him down hard against the floor, “She’s eleven! That’s fucking gross!”
You can keep your bowlers black,
He nodded, “And so I expect you and your friends know what it does, then?”
Tom spoke in her mind and she suddenly almost smiled, “Is that why you gave me a family tree of my own? So I would owe you?”
She repeated what he said, nodding to herself. “So—basketball on broomsticks then? With six hoops? Do the hoops have the same point or are different points given for different hoops?"
“Very well done, Ms. Potter.” She was thoughtful for a moment. “You have your father’s talents.”
“As our Mandrakes are only seedlings, their cries won’t kill yet,” she said calmly as though she’d just done nothing more exciting than water a begonia. “However, they will knock you out for several hours so I say this again—anyone who removes their earmuffs will not only get a detention but will also be bound to the hospital wing for the rest of the day. Now, four to a tray—there is a large supply of pots here—compost in the sacks over there—and be careful of the Venomous Tentacula, it’s teething.”
Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Persephone’s list again.
She beamed, “Well, my mother came from a non-magical family, so I find it hard to believe she was a mermaid.” She smiled. “That potion is hard to brew—let me know if you need help—” She shrugged and started for the east end of the castle.
He snapped a quick picture of her and she blinked. She was a little disoriented.
Now he was really laughing, laughing as he jumped down from the branch down to the ground—which was a good twenty feet down. He landed easily as she cried out and grumbled when she realized he was perfectly fine and a freaking werewolf.
“Don’t be stubborn, you’ll get lost,” He told her before giving her an almost smile, “Wouldn’t want to run into those spiders, would you?”
“She had it coming.”
“a supposed werewolf,” He corrected himself quickly. “That’s not brave. And standing up to anyone you don’t like, including but not limited to the supposed werewolf, that’s not brave either?”
“Excuse me, you cannot just ignore a question like that.” She tilted her head to look at him.
The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that. Not until they'd stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig.
Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. She inched closer and gasped—the unicorn was dead and she could not have seen something so beautiful and so sad.  Its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on the dark leaves.
All Persephone’s—she couldn’t think straight for a moment. She’d, of course, had her own little hiding spot for her saved up money, somewhere the Durlseys would never be able to find if they took the place down brick by brick. But here—here was a fortune and they didn’t even know.
family are not too enthusiastic about magic, but I’m sure other non-magical people would be interested in magic, though it doesn’t seem like any of them know of it.” She sighed, “Having three older wizarding brothers must mean you already know tons of magic, huh?”
“Don’t need to,” Fred leaned forward.
She restarted and it didn’t last—her vocals were straining now and she felt it in her heart that she wanted to die it hurt so bad. She didn’t realize it in the minute but she did when someone stopped her, “Alright, bring out the understudy!”
Her face flushing, she retreated from the dorm and down to the common room. She gathered all her textbooks and went up to her own dorm, dropping her books and plopping onto bed.
"He’s not,” Persephone cut her off immediately. “He’s going to be perfectly alright.” She changed the subject with a hard gulp. “We’ve seen Herbology, Transfiguration, Charms…what’s next?”
“Though if his grades don’t pick up,” Mr. Malfoy continued, “I don’t know if I should expect him to turn out as much else but a—”
He let go of her hand when they had entered the more populated dance studio. The entire dance department was here. Every dancer Hogwarts had was exempt from all morning classes till lunch, as this would take a while. She was told it was normal, as she didn’t know, having joined the class late last year.
Both girls were very smart, in Gryffindor, very enthusiastic about magic and they shared a dorm. Both girls went over notes every night and always read and had bumped into each other more than once in the library. That—that was about it. Hermione always scoffed at Persephone’s use of her free time—apparently, practicing her ballet steps in the dorm was a distraction from Hermione’s studying and the other girls fawning over her kitten was irritating and induced migraines.
She spun immediately, feeling as if though the blood in her veins had run cold. Two shabby looking wizards that had their eyes on her before when she came out of Borgins’ shop were standing there. They smiled at her with chipped, yellow teeth in a manner that she did not like—disgusting.
The kitchen was small and rather cramped. There was a scrubbed wooden table and chairs in the middle. The chair were mismatched. Persephone adored it already but then she caught a sniff of the food cooking and her stomach growled.
She supposed she could try her luck once more—after all, everything was going her way, why waste an opportunity? She was on the Quidditch team, she was getting a good reputation, she was going to audition for the school play, she had awesome friends and she was academically brilliant—could it hurt to try and finally get her proper wand?
Hermione Granger was very…
“I don’t remember that description for him,” She said.
“Out of the way, there,” The photographer guy pushed at Ron, who stumbled into Persephone, “This is for the Daily Prophet—”
She thought for a moment, “Well, whatever. You’d make a good Slytherin.”
He pulled up his trousers, and stared at her, “Why are you staring at the hedge?”
"Both of hers are better than ours, though," Fred said, examining the sweaters. "She obviously makes more of an effort if you're not family."
Ron jumped up to his feet while Persephone sighed, “Ron, it’s too early in the morning to waste your time on this.”
Mr. Malfoy’s lip curled, “I have yet to be visited. The Malfoy name still commands a certain amount of respect but the Ministry still grows ever more meddlesome. There are rumors about a new Muggle Protection Act—no doubt that flea-bitten, Muggle-loving fool Arthur Weasley is behind it—”
I'm not sure if its made clear enough about how this is the beginning of the end for Persephone's sweeter, more innocent character. I hope I made it very clear that she's no longer herself with the little speech at Malfoy. Any guesses for what has happened or will happened? Leave a comment :)
Ron was leaning out of what looked like a car—and actual car—parked in midair. An old turquoise car was parked outside her window and her best friend was grinning at her from inside it. And then—“George! Fred!” They were grinning at her from the front seats.
"Oh, I would love some, but I haven't eaten for nearly five hundred years," said the ghost. "I don't need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don't think I've introduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower."
Hermione nodded enthusiastically. “It says here that the ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Philosopher’s Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers. The stone will transform any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.” Persephone gasped, encouraging Hermione. “There have been many reports of the Philosopher’s Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight).
When Ryn has calmed everyone down, he has her sing. And by god, does she sing. She thinks of Pansy and the glorious singing of no words from Titanic and how the adrenaline pumped through her veins as she realized it was a beautiful song. And she cries—she cries as she sings Abba’s famous song and she cries good.
"Oh, I thought we'd keep this private," Snape’s voice was icy and cold, as if he were playing at his words. “Students aren't supposed to know about the Philosopher’s Stone, after all."
If Hagrid hadn't pointed it out, Persephone wouldn't have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn't even glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn't see the Leaky Cauldron at all. Persephone found herself theorizing only she and Hagrid could see it. Before she could ask it aloud, Hagrid had steered her inside.
“Obviously.” Fred mimicked.
She checked her watch, “Maybe I can help you to the hospital wing?”
“So I have to pull you out of class because you crashed a flying car into a violent tree?”
“Thanks, Lily… I think I'll go to bed…” Neville started to walk away but he bumped into the table, his legs still seeming asleep to some degree.
“Yeah and now you’ve got more rash than leg!” She gestured to her legs. “What’s going on?”
“A Veronica?” Hermione raised a brow. “You definitely don’t look like Lily.” Hermione thought for a moment, “Maybe not looking like yourself is best, if we get caught—”
“Darling, have you given Lily her gift?” His mum interfered as some point and Cedric bloomed red.
She bit her lip and started walking. Ben had survived this long without her—he would survive a night.
Cedric Diggory was a life saver.
He winked dramatically and Persephone snorted. Five minutes later, they were marching up the hill, broomsticks in hand. They couldn’t use real Quidditch balls, because it would have been hard to explain if they had escaped and flown away over the village; instead they threw apples for one another to catch. She’d leave her Nimbus Two Thousand in their care during the weekdays and found it smelled like apples.
“You like it?” She asked, unable to hold back her excitement. “I thought you would. You know what it is, right?” She looked concerned as he stared at her in shock.
“Aren’t all mirrors here magical?” Ron questioned. Persephone shrugged.
She gave him a smile, "Yes.”
She didn’t need lotion either—she had the softest skin. Just having been in the water made her smooth and soft and silky that being a fish freak was almost worth it. She dropped her towel. Her hair was in wet waves down to her hips, darkened by the water and her cheeks were flushed. Had she changed? She felt bloated. Turning, she noticed her breasts had grown. And they hurt. Her hips, too, had widened—she was only twelve! Why all the change!?
“Would your parents have a fit if I, I don’t know, payed for it?” She asked casually. Fred snorted.
The table on the right with the yellow themed uniforms cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. So Hufflepuff was yellow…wasn’t yellow the color of friendship in flower tones? Huh—how ironic the girl named after the goddess of flowers would know her flower codes.
"Don't you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I don't want Slytherin to win the house cup, and you'll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells."
“Why not?” Persephone raised a brow, hoping it wasn’t because the accountant was non-magic.
So, to her relief, it went a lot better than she could have imagined. The diadem was right—er, sorry, hairpiece. She realized before bed that she had never asked for the name—what’s your name?
“I don’t need to try—boys are so easily frightened,” She sighed. “And I’ve heard terrific things about the way they taste…”
Ron was running to grab Hedwig, who was causing such a scene that there was a lot of muttering about cruelty to animals from the surrounding crowd.
It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher's question. She was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue.
Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to join them.
“Illvermorny?” She asked. She didn’t recognize the word. The thestral bumped her head against her palm.
“Wait, what?” Persephone stopped. “Are you…”
“At the Slytherin table?”
She mused the idea of putting her witch hat on, just to scare the living daylights out of her Uncle and Dudley but then thought that she still needed a ride…she laughed, still, at the thought as she brushed her hair out to be straight with her new brush—the curls were lengthened and her hair was bouncy and voluminous and all around pretty an she couldn’t help swish it around—she’d never seen it straight without the trouble of changing it herself, it was so pretty!
She took the letter he handed her and read it out, finding its content identical to the first letter she’d read from Hogwarts—a real school, she now concluded, because at this point, how could it not be? Her head was swimming with questions like the storm outside and she couldn't decide which to ask first. After a few minutes she stammered, "My owl?"
“So the oldest brother, who was a combative man, asked for a wand more powerful than any in existence: a wand that must always win duels for its owner, a wand worthy of a wizard who had conquered Death! So Death crossed to an elder tree on the banks of the river, fashioned a wand from a branch that hung there, and gave it to the oldest brother.
And Firenze whisked around; with Persephone clutching on as best she could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them.
“Is that it there?” Ron gestured to the door and she nodded.
“Sir,” She began, taking a seat. “I’ve been thinking, for a long time, actually, since I was sorted that I don’t…fit in. Into Gryffindor, I mean.”
She glared, “
She saw her reflection at first. But then it flickered—she had long blonde hair, slick and floating behind her, her skin had completely paled and her eyes had grown so pale, they glowed white. But then she flickered back to herself, her rosy, red-haired self. She stared in shock and confusion but it continued to happen—her reflection changed and changed. While she was blonde, she smiled and winked, pulling out the stone from inside her shirt, the shelf between her collarbone and her bossom.
“We’ve got no proof! No proof, no witness, no case,” She groaned. “Quirrell won’t back us up and Snape will likely pitch for you two to be thrown out of Hogwarts if we need to explain why we think this. Or, likely, he’ll suck your blood because that vampire theory is looking very plausible.” She sighed. “Unless Dumbledore knows he’s a vampire and is keeping it lowkey—Dumbledore wouldn’t hire a vampire, would he?”
‘I…suppose.’
To Persephone’s surprise, Daphne Greengrass, Tracey Davis, Pansy Parkinson (EW) and several older girls, one she knew to be Blaise Zabini’s older sister.
“An impressive attempt, Ms. Potter.” Professor McGonagall commented, suddenly hovering in front of her. “Do tell me what you believe you did wrong.”
“The Ministry wouldn’t presume to trouble you, sir, surely?”
Looking to her right, towards the fountain, she saw a very small, mousy haired boy was staring at Persephone and Daphne, as though transfixed.
She would not take into consideration what others had said about Slytherin—she would take what they acted as a first-hand experience….she might as well be in Slytherin in a few minutes anyway. She might as well say goodbye to Ron now…
Persephone took pleasure in answering, “There is no difference between the two. Trick question.” She smiled just a tad. “It also goes by the name of aconite?”
“He’s the owl Mum and Dad got Percy when he got made prefect,” Fred piped up. She nodded.
“Perfect.” Persephone said, giving the letter to Hedwig after address it to Dumbledore, the headmaster.
“They are all bent out of shape to be the one to take out the Girl Who Lived!” He hissed at her and she rolled her eyes before she had an idea. “What? What’s that look?”
She dragged George to the Gryffindor table before he could march over there, feeling highly distressed. Ron did not ask where she was during their lesson.
“And we have one less thing to worry about,” Persephone said about an hour later in her own dorm, Hermione standing next to her. She threw the letter into the fire that was lit in the middle of the room and they watched it burn with satisfaction.
“Hey!” Persephone whispered excitedly—she didn’t think raising her voice above that of a whisper was appropriate for this setting—stepping closer, “You’re here!”
“Creative, thank you,” She said.
,” Ron read aloud off the back cover. “That sounds
“Hermione Granger?” She raised a brow. “Second year Gryffindor that I hang out with most of the day? Like every day?”
Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it, distracting her from her Italian. She glanced up—he had four sandwiches inside the package. He pulled one of them apart and said, bashfully when he saw her staring, "She always forgets I don't like corned beef."
“Why?” He raised a brow, glancing at the people still staring.
It recovered before they could and it raised its cub—Persephone was frozen, an instinct reaction to the sudden fear, but Hermione screamed, loud and ringing and very high-pitched.
Aunt Petunia worked very hard to teach Persephone what she called, “being a proper young lady”, something Persephone had a hard time doing. She would make her sit by her in a certain position when she would sew and she would make her change the flowers in the bedrooms. She made her cook and clean and keep her back straight and her hair perfectly kept. If she didn’t try so hard, Persephone’s hair would be in its natural state of chaos. It was lucky she could tame it with seconds of hard concentration.
“I’m going to put a charm on all the costumes to give them the retro beige color like it’s in the movie until after the hurricane scene. Then it’ll be more colorful like the originals,” He told her as he circled her, putting pins where they needed to be.
“If you ever do run across it, you will now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that. Now, why don't you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed?"
“If you want, you can stay. If there’s someone you want to meet, just write their name down and put it here,” She gestured to her little alter. “I’m sure Mum and Dad won’t mind.” More tears slipped as the words registered with her—it was the first time she had referred to anyone as ‘mum and dad’.
“That’s kind of you but you shouldn’t apologize for her, Susan.” She paused. “So…oh, do you know the difference between the houses?” She’d been thinking about this since Hermione had mentioned them.
"Look at me!" he said.
Charms was different than the other classes so far. They studied the theory of magic and asked basic questions any student could find in the book. This was good for Persephone, as she had no wand. It happened to have been a rather easy question that Professor Flitwick had asked and Hermione had raised her hand and answered correctly. As she earned a point for Gryffindor, she smiled smugly at Persephone, who frowned in confusion. There was no competition between them, was there?
"Give us a look, Lee, go on."
"Good-bye," said Ron.
"Welcome," he said. "Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! Thank you!"
“So, so if I were to want it to move, it would need something more than just an incantation?” She guessed, raised her brows at him. He nodded, encouraging her to continue. “Flying is more fit to moving it, especially on a broomstick, because there’s a will behind it. So—so I would need to give it a will?” She thought out loud, thinking to her reading. “No—no that wouldn’t be enough—it needs some help—it needs a sense of control, so, while you are very light with your wand, you must also be sure to be aware of the air around—you must find not only your own will for it, but for the air’s will, as well? So, wind would be harder to operate the charm but easier to master?”
“Best not tell anyone, Ron,” Fred warned, smiling widely. Persephone shook her head.
Persephone stared. Then, she snorted, “Voldemort? Really? What kinda of stupid name—”
“I feel wet?” She offered. What is with this guy? “Wait, how did our conversation go from werewolf to degrees to swimming?”
None of the girls slept that night—Lavender had thought to bring Persephone’s things from class and it was a sudden, shocking thing to walk in on. A trashed dorm room? Very scary—even scarier to find their dorm mate sobbing in the bathroom, screaming and screaming about how her legs were gone and that she couldn’t stand.
The sky had turned light before they stopped talking. They went to bed exhausted, their throats sore. Hermione tried to keep calming her down and she slept with her in the same bed. They spoke only of exams, Hermione trying to calm her down. At some point, the two girls fell asleep, but not before Persephone thought of something—was Quirrell not there that day, in the pub, on July 31
The forest was black and silent. She smiled. “Scared, are we?” He grimaced at her. They’d gone a good way into the forest now, away from the others and away from anyone who would hear him scream.
Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils.
“Where is he?” The man asked, narrowing his eyes at her.
“We survived,” He pointed out. He was paler than usual, clammy and looking terribly ill. There were dark bags under his eyes and his bruising was more prominent. There was scars over his body more so his arms than anywhere else. “Survived your first full moon, Potter.”
Persephone tilted her head back in insulted disbelief, “Well,
“Sounds like a Malfoy-esque family,” She said, leaning back on the seat.
“Since when is the government efficient?” Ben snapped when they scoured the internet for a good twenty minutes.
Or young with scabby knees,
"Thirty-six," he said, looking up at his mother and father. "That's two less than last year."
“Okay, first off—no. Sirens and mermaids are completely different; mermaids always have tails and sirens don’t.”
“We’ll be just a minute,” He threw over his shoulder and she didn’t get a chance to see Daphne’s expression at this.
After sewing her pointe shoes, she stood up on them and started stretching them, standing on them, testing out the wrap. It was pretty steady. It was then that Hades walked in, looking out of place as ever.
Finally, when they all calmed down, George and Fred re-adjusted the sheets on the mattress. “Where is it you’ll be sneaking off to, exactly?” Percy asked skeptically. He didn’t seem as harsh now.
"So…we need to solve a riddle to figure out which will take us forward, then?” She pouted, thinking, and reading it again. “Smallest bottle, then?”
“I, um, actually named her after Minerva J. Chapman…she was from the early 20
“Nice, real nice, thanks Potter,” He nodded. He looked at her and his ill-stricken face finally lifted as he too tried to bite back a smile.
Persephone and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think, each fidgeting nervously. Neither girls had ever won a game of chess. Finally he said, "Now, don't be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess—"
She wasn’t sure what she was expecting him to say but her hopes fell either way, “Oh. Yes, I’ve got it,” She turned and grabbed her bag. She pulled the book out and held it out for him. He reached out, taking it from her. His fingers brushed up against hers and without realizing it, she hissed an unfamiliar sound. She covered her mouth quickly and coughed. He stared at her.
"But the glass," he kept saying, "where did the glass go?"
Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, "Wingardium Leviosa!"
“Not her! Her friend, that horrid girl, Pansy Parkinson, is it? She’s close to Malfoy, isn’t she?” She said and Persephone interrupted.
It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around the top:
“Ah…” He nodded.
“Oh,” She nodded, not really paying attention. She looked back at him and suddenly remembered, “Is that what you wanted before?”
Five minutes later, when she met Ron and Hermione outside of the library, they both shook their heads. Persephone sighed, stroking Salem’s head as they went off to lunch.
Hermione took a deep breath, “I’d rather have my first kiss with my best friend than some boy,” She said before winding up and rushing forward, pressing her lips harshly on Persephone’s. Giggling into the kiss, Persephone pressed back and held her face and when they pulled away, they were both giggling. There were whoops from the boys. Ron’s mouth had fallen open.
“I didn’t!” She argued.
Slowly, she turned back to the mirror.
The door seemed to blow off its hinges with such a brute force that it hit the floor with a loud and deafening crash.
“Dying, Potter. I’m dying.” He told her. “Go on.”
“Mermaids don’t inhabit these waters. You must not be from around here,” She said and Persephone nodded slowly. “You’re a witch.”
And then Persephone burst out into laughter. Slowly, Hermione stood up and crossed her arms, “Ha ha, very funny.”
Pansy’s ugly, pig-nose scrunched up as she smiled, “Well, the Potter family has found some disgrace, hasn’t it?”
“Fine…” She narrowed her eyes at him.
found out how to get past Fluffy. Besides, Snape nearly had his leg ripped off once, he's not going to try it again in a hurry and Quirrell’s too much of a coward. And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down."
“Well, no kidding!” Persephone coughed. “I got lost—what were you doing down there?”
“Did you kill someone?” He asked immediately.
“Very funny, Georgie.”
She could manage a smile at that but it faltered quickly, “How long have I been in here?”
Persephone realized she was under cover as a Veronica, as she chose to name this look, and quickly concentrated back into her normal look. The three other friends’ eyes widened while the girl with bumblegum pink hair, “Heyy!”
Persephone laughed and thought of something—what had been on the ice? It had been a weird shape. “I want to go see something.”
“What does reasonable hour even mean?” Persephone asked him. “I mean, the prospect of reasonable was created by who, exactly? I mean, reasonably, someone must have decided long ago that reasonable hours would mean the hours the sun was out—but what are reasonable hours to the people who live in places where the sun is out for six months straight? What are they to do in those unreasonable hours? Wait for the reasonable? No—no we must never be limited in the name of reasonable hours because really, some people work better in the night—does that make their hours unreasonable? And what about nocturnal animals—what are reasonable hours to them? Owls?”
“Do…what?” She asked hesitantly. What was wrong with her eyes?
“Fucking fantastic,” He said, splashing a bunch of water at Persephone.
Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image.
“It is the same all over,” Mr. Borgin said with his oily voice. “Wizard blood is counting for less everywhere—”
Persephone stood stunned, staring at the greenhouse with her mouth open. Had she just hallucinated that entire thing or was she the one intoxicated? Was there something in the orange juice that morning at breakfast?
Mr. Weasley flushed darker than either Ron or Gary.
“Ni..co?”
“Cornish pixies?” She muttered, “Right.”
"Only joking, Mom."
that his only fans are witches,” He said. She scowled. “You’re smart, you’re not head over heels for a pretty face—but most witches are.”
Speaking of Slytherin associated with energy, "Bulstrode, Millicent" became a Slytherin and she definitely had the energy of those girls that bullied other, smaller girls. (Maybe it was her imagination, but she swore she could hear ‘boos’ from the Gryffindor table).
She got to her feet quickly and brushed herself off. It was colder now in the actual common room. She looked up—she had fallen out of the painting of Salazar Slytherin—it stared down at her as if it knew what sort of mission she was on. She scurried off, up the boys’ dormitory stairs, bent on the mission she knew the painting could smell out.
“In due course the brothers separated, each for his own destination.
She huffed, “You can be nicer, you know,”
“Mr. Malfoy, it is a pleasure to greet you again,” His voice was as oily as his hair, “Delighted—and the young Master Malfoy, too—charmed. How may I be of assistance? I must show you, just in today, and very reasonably priced—”
Maybe—maybe she had to tap the bricks on the wall, like how Hagrid did to get into Diagon Alley. She wondered, after taping the bricks desperately with her fingers and then giving up and leaning against the brick wall of platform 9, that perhaps she’d need a wand or something—BUT SHE DID NOT HAVE A WAND!
“Only one way to move now,” Persephone said, nodding towards the one path forward.
with it all.
Nearly half an hour later, Persephone was sitting in the back of the Dursley’s car with Piers and Dudley, wondering how her unluckiness had gotten her this far, while on the way to the zoo for the first time in her life. Her aunt and uncle couldn’t not find anywhere to send her and she was to come along silently, after being threatened, of course, but she didn’t care.  She would put up with anything her cousin and his idiotic friend would do to be outside in the sun, in a social atmosphere.
“Aha,” Mr. Weasley said with grim satisfaction. “So he’s worried…oh, I’d love to get Lucius Malfoy for something…”
“No she didn’t!” Ron called out. “We were right here—she didn’t even have her wand out!”
He wasn’t amused by being excluded but he seemed okay after Persephone offered him the opened chocolate frogs. He listened as the girls explained to him and his mouth dropped open.
Evangeline described, half in Italian and half in English, that the school is name after a witch-like figure that appeared in northern Italian Non-Magical folklore. She told them that the non-magical people’s tradition was to burn a ‘giubiana’ on the last Thursday of January, as they saw the figure as scary and negative and the burning was meant to be symbolical. The naming of the school was done with purpose to reclaim the name and proudly reaffirm with a head held high that, “
Behind the wall was a spiral staircase that was moving smoothly upward, like an escalator. She raised a brow and shrugged. She’d come this far. She stepped onto it and the wall closed with a thud behind her. No going back now. She rose upward in circles, higher and higher, until at last, slightly dizzy, Persephone came upon a gleaming oak door ahead, with a brass knocker in the shape of a griffin.
George walked between them and Fred took to her other side, “Well, you can come this summer—fixed it up with mum and she’s very excited to meet you. Just need permission from your family.”
“Okay,” She said, closing her mouth and intertwining her fingers in front of her lips. “Alright, okay, alright…” She took a deep breath. Could she deceive the poor bastard once more?
Professor McGonagall offered a more complex exam. Perhaps it was to make everyone more nervous to see how they’d perform on their feet. The students all waited outside the Transfiguration classroom, being called in one by one. Thought it felt like forever, it was actually no more than fifteen minutes a student, though Hermione did hers in two minutes. Susan did just as well. Persephone couldn’t help watching her watch.
Persephone had gotten used to this by now but the first time a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, she was shocked. They circled until they saw their owners and would drop their letters and packages onto their laps.
Persephone left the table with a Grow Your Own Warts kit and her very own wizard chess set that she would play Ron with. She noticed too late that the white mice had disappeared, and she could only hope they would not end up Mrs. Norris's Christmas dinner. Minnie followed her loyally and she ended up feeding her some safe food off the table, letting her sleep against her feet, her tail wrapped around her ankle.
Amanda said, “I don’t feel like a girl.”
"Tokens from your friends and admirers," Dumbledore said, beaming. "What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. I believe your good friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated it."
Water surged past them and they heard splashing, as if someone was running through ankle deep water. They heard hissing and yowling and they only had to guess that Filch was carrying Mrs. Norris. They bit back their laughter and finally, when it was quiet for a few moments, Fred opened the door and peeked out.
“Is this your first wizarding funeral?” Daphne little sister, Astoria, asked. Daphne gasped, sending her sister a warning look. “What!? She didn’t go to her parents’ funeral!”
“Sure. We’ve checked most of the compartments down that way. Neville says he lost it once on the train so it could be anywhere—we’re going to look by the first compartments, towards the first cart—hey!”
Persephone slipped away, walking quietly to the bathroom. She grabbed a blanket and a pillow and a bowl of candy on the way, knowing this wouldn’t be easy. There was no lock, for safety reasons, and so she knocked gently.
He leaned back to his bar, tending to the sink, “Aberforth.”
“You’re excused,” He smirked a crooked grin up at her and she glowered. “And I’m not ignoring the question. I just chose to not answer it.”
"I suppose you not talking to us has an expiration date, then?” Persephone sighed in contentment, still the thought of Mrs. Norris on her mind. “It’s been, what, twelve hours?”
The boy dropped to his knees and started to pile the dirt that had spread around the broken pot. She stared and blinked, “Um.”
“Mum, we know how to de-gnome a garden —”
The train pulled out of the station. Persephone wanted to watch Hagrid until he was out of sight; she rose in her seat, on the very tips of her toes, but he was gone in the moment she blinked.
Filch noticed the relief on Hermione’s face, who must have been thinking the same thing, and said, "I suppose you think you'll be enjoying yourself with that oaf? Well, think again, girl—it's into the forest you're going and I'm much mistaken if you'll all come out in one piece."
At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent.
All of Gryffindor house was curious to know what the whole commotion was about the night before but the girls were loyal and said nothing of the incident.
“Voldemort is scared of him but I’ve killed him twice now,” She spoke without thought. “He should be afraid of me, not that old loony man.”
“We…we just need to wait.” She told him, trying to calm herself down. “Your parents will come to the car and…and we’ll explain everything then. This wasn’t our faults—we can’t possibly get into any trouble.”
She identified Daphne amongst the four, and another girl as Millicent Bulstrode, a mean looking girl. Another girl she thought could be Tracey Davis.
“Oh, I’ve decided to call him Norbert,” Hagrid said, not catching the tone in Hermione’s voice. “An’ he really knows me, now, watch. Norbert! Norbert! Where's Mommy?"
Suddenly, a completely new voice, one that seemed to belong to the youngest boy with the lightest of all their hair, spoke, "Oh, mum, can I go see her, on the train, for just a minute, just to see her, mummy please!"
“Hm,” He thought, “Never heard of her.”
"Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you," she said, once they were all gathered around her. Persephone couldn’t help noticing that she spoke mainly to the Slytherin captain, a sixth year boy with the nastiest of teeth that would make Hermione would freak—her parents were dentists and she brought it up
"I do feel
Ron didn't answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because Fred Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Lily, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch.
Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice. Persephone watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Persephone’s amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided.
She would lay on her bed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn't come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before she went to sleep, Persephone ticked off another day on the piece of paper she had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the first.
She couldn’t tell if he was commenting on the trick or on her bedroom. Either way she rolled her eyes.
People burst into laughter and Persephone frowned, “I see it!”
Her heart was thundering—how was she supposed to…oh, of course!
When she was drinking tea and trying desperately to block out the harsh emotions, Mr. Weasley sat down with her. “Persephone, please do be honest with me.”
“What,” His voice sounded like he was carefully controlling his anger, “Can I do for you, Madame Pince?”
Then, slowly taking a step, she knew immediately she was not in Borgin’s and Burke’s. Despite its eerie atmosphere and overall creepiness level, it looked more like I was a very large spare closet. It was filled here and there with broken and damaged furniture—chairs, tables and even haphazardly stacked cabinets—thousands and thousands of books. There were winged catapults and fanged Frisbees, some with enough life in them to hover half-heartedly overs the mountains of other items. There were chipped bottles of congealed potions, hats, jewels, cloaks, what looked like dragon eggshells, corked bottles whose contents still shimmered almost temptingly, several rusting swords and a heavy, bloodstained axe.
Slowly, Persephone swam forward and maybe she was disoriented, but she let the girl pick out a twig that had stuck to Persephone hair. She looked at the twig before putting it behind her own ear. Persephone stared.
“Er…Chocolate Frog?”
Sputtering water and gasping, she blinked harshly. Everything was out of focus and no matter how many times she blinked, she wasn’t able to focus properly.
For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of what smelled like sherry. One of them was smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. It seemed like they’d walked into the past. No one dressed like anyone who passed by the place—there were top hats, and robes and corsets.
“Okay, got it,” She rolled her eyes, leaning down to fill it with water. His hold on her wrist slid from her wrist to her hand until he was holding her fingers. His hand tightened. “I’m not going to swim away.” She told him.
Finally,
‘Well…I’m not sure about abuse,’ but of course it was abuse, for what else could it be? It certainly wasn’t well-meaning. They simply hated her. ‘But my aunt does treat me nicely some days. She brushes my hair and always brings fresh flowers to my bedroom, when no one else is home, of course.’
“You’re mad!” Ron said as they both followed her.
(See the end of the chapter for
She comforted herself with the knowledge that Tom was there, that she wasn’t alone, and continued on her way. There were no books written in English, or any language that she recognized. They were all written in runic languages that she had no ever seen before. She must have been in an older, unvisited portion of the library—a thick layer of dust covered the shelves and books. When she pulled a book out, she found the dust floating in the air made it hard to breathe.
She knew her parents’ names. Her mother didn’t have any magical relatives in the past three generations, which is odd. Usually muggleborns were born with Squib ancestors but there was nothing. Her maternal grandmother’s name is Rose, and her great-aunt’s is Delilah. Persephone had to smile at this. There was an obvious flower theme in the family.
“You should have seen his face when you whispered in his ear—he got so red!” Ron insisted. “He fancies you!”
Her mind was then filled with information—she was lost in facts about the cold war, of prime ministers and or presidents, of a plane carrying rugby team crashing into Wales, of so, so, so many things, ranging from 1950 to 1960.
Ron’s eyes widened, “Oh no! They can’t know, can they? They’ll freak out and kick you out!”
When she returned to her bedroom, aunt Petunia had laid out the dress she would be wearing for the evening and many products on her dresser. First and foremost, she shoved lotion in her hands, “Lotion everywhere. I’ll return for your hair in ten minutes.”
He sat up eagerly, “It’s better—it’s international Quidditch played by some of the best Quidditch players of this century—it been held every four years since 1473 and it can go on for days,”
"Have you got your own broom?" the boy went on.
“That’s okay—I’ll find my way,” She told him.
The game went and went until George was made siren. He was targeting Persephone and the next thing she remembered was Mr. Weasley kneeling before her, staring worriedly at Persephone. She blinked once more, and then again. Slowly, the room came into focus and she could only make out the blurry shapes of the Weasleys. Ron was sitting by her, staring at her. Gary was standing with his mother, crying. George was sitting in front of her and Fred and Percy were staring in horror at her.
She watched, petrified to the spot, not daring to breathe too harshly in fear of the stone falling. She watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away. Quirrell's head looked strangely small without it. Then he turned slowly on the spot.
was the one thing he was not brilliant at.
At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in his tracks.
“Actually, that would be really great!” She smiled, thinking of being away from the Dursleys. Susan and Daphne had already extended invitations to spend the summer together. “Could I get back to you?”
The next day, when she was dressed and prepared for the day (Diana was to be watching her while the Durlseys were out to buy Dudley a present for some reason) in a yellow sundress and brushed out red curls, she was greeted with a horrible smell in the kitchen. The smell got even worse when she walked into the kitchen. The smell had started to burn her nostrils and she had to cover her nose and mouth before she could pin point where the smell was coming from.
"How come you were expelled?"
"I think," said Ron, "we're going to have to be chessmen."
She pushed away from the table, nearly falling over her own feet as she ran, jumping over the chair and sprinting up the stairs. She meant to knock but then she forgot because she had already burst through the door, “GARY!?”
"Do we—er—have to join you to get across?" The black knight nodded.
They were planning on playing Quidditch, though Mrs. Weasley sent Ron up to his room to do his homework instead. George whispered, “Poor kid.” And she elbowed him.
Persephone had Ron cast Wingardium Leviosa, as she knew he was very skilled in the spell (which he flushed at, but did so cheerfully) while she cast the spell she’d freshly taught herself. “Mobiliarbus!”
“I promise, Dobby,” She said, placing her hand on her heart. Then she offered her pinky, “If I take your pinky and vow it, then it is an unbreakable vow.” He gave her his tiny, weird textured pinky and she shook it. “Now, will you please take us and our things to Hogsmeade?”
People around her gasped in near unison as pearly-white and slightly transparent people glided into the room through the wall. They weren’t paying mind to the first years, even as the first years stumbled away from them in surprise—Hermione Granger bumped right into Persephone—while the people talked.
Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard.
“Did you hit your head?” He asked her. “I’m not a werewolf.”
She froze, staring at the creature until her eyes fully adjusted and she could see a slightly smaller one a few feet behind it. She almost smiled—a baby and mother. How…strangely fascinating.
“Why? Don’t want to share a bathroom with me, do you?” She screamed. “No one ever has, why should I be surprised that no one wants me?!” She wailed and started crying harder.
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take his eyes from the game, said, "You tell him, Neville."
She returned to the Gryffindor common room with relief—the entire castle, save for the library and Great Hall, were drafty and cold. The roaring fire made it so very comfortable, knowing the bitter window rammed against the windows outside.
"Haven’t I already seen you?" Persephone asked finally, as Dedalus Diggle's top hat fell off in his excitement. "You bowed to me once in a shop."
“Why are we going so far down?” She asked into the silence.
a difference, though probably because they were definitely not the same shade of redhead.
She thought of telling Dumbledore of her cat but thought better of it. Students were only allowed one pet and she had an owl and cat. Somehow, she’d yet to be caught and she’d like to keep it that way. She had the Gryffindors to thank—no one was a snitch. She’d be able to catch a snitch in her own house—she was the house’s seeker.
The twins weren’t the only one who stood up for her—Cedric Diggory from Hufflepuff had told off several people in the halls and turned to her, “Don’t worry, everything’ll be okay. You don’t deserve to be bullied like this.”
“Did you just—”
“I haven’t got much to offer to children, and I don’t want to get fined for giving minors Firewhiskey.” He said, wiping a glass with one of the dirty rags, making it dirtier, probably.
Another will transport the drinker back instead,
So, Percy Weasley found them at the top of the boys’ stairway, all sitting on George’s mattress, ready to shoot down the stairs. It seemed like Percy had mental alarms that went off in his head whenever someone broke rules. “What is the meaning of this? It’s passed midnight!”
“Nice big smile, Persephone,” Lockhart said through a smile that should have hurt him, “Together, you and I are worth the front page.”
“So, don’t you see Hermione?” Persephone said excitedly. “Quirrell is a Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, don’t you think he would know how to tame a troll enough to lead it into a castle?”
In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood Persephone on a stool next to him and immediately, a measuring tape took to wrapping itself around her slim waist and took her arm’s measurements, as well as every other measurement. She was so amazed by this—she’d had some sewing experience, always cutting up Dudley’s clothes and sewing it tighter for her own personal fit. In her moment of amazement, she nearly missed the boy’s stare. He was staring, unashamed, with his eyes wide.
“You too.”
"I’m definitely going to play,” She told them. “I’m going to make sure Gryffindor wins this game—that’ll definitely wipe that stupid grin off Malfoy’s face," she told Ron and Hermione. He was acting out again—he had been pulling on Persephone’s pony tail just earlier in class, baiting her to slap him.
"Voldem—”
Her mind was going so many directions—she had been right…this entire time, she’d been right.
The Rhea Silvia Imperial Academy of Sorcery was a beautiful school, with a dedicated section of the catacombs, well protected from tourists of non-magical people with repelling charms. The school was named well, being as Rhea Silvia was the mother of Romulus and Remus. It was
The high voice spoke again.
She blinked. She wasn’t. “How—?” Her glasses had been in her pocket during Christmas dinner—perhaps he’d seen them sticking out…did she take them out of her pocket? She couldn’t remember.
“Huh.” Then she smiled. “The Black Angel of Death?”
Uncle Vernon cleared his throat loudly making her jump once more, and said, “Now, as we all know, today is a very important day.”  Persephone looked confused…had she spoken too soon…? “This could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career,” said Uncle Vernon.
She entered Madam Malkin's shop alone, her nerves back in her hands and knees.
"I couldn't help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying—"
Someone picked her up and started walking and she crossed her arms, “Initiation for what exactly?”
Ron put Hagrid’s flute to his lips and blew a soft bit. It didn’t really sound like a tune but it was good enough for the dog’s eyes to start to droop. Slowly, painfully slowly, the dog’s growls ceased. It lay its heads on its paws and fell to his knees. It was sort of cute—but as it blew out large amounts of dog breath as it slept, she decided not as cute as initially.
She was young, from what Persephone could tell from the voice, and she was sitting by the shore, her legs crossed open with a book in her lap. She was barefoot. Her hair was woven from golden sunlight and her skin was glowing due to the sun filtering in behind her. Persephone stared for a long moment, wondering if it were an angel visiting her—had she died?
So that’s what they did. They went all the way back to the car, carrying their trunks and the animal cages that contained Salem and Hedwig. Unfortunately, the car was locked. She pursed her lips…this car was pretty old.
"But—"
Persephone felt bile form in her mouth and she swallowed, “You—you said she—they abandoned me on your doorstep! You said they didn’t want me!”
Neville shook his head and Persephone had to agree, “Not what I was thinking, ‘Mione.”
Lee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides.
She couldn’t help meeting several staring eyes, so to avoid the eyes, Persephone looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. She sighed in amazement, leaning to the side to say to Ron, “It really does look—” But she was cut off by someone saying, "It’s bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History."
Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-to the moment they sat down in her first class.
“Good thing, I was not in the mood for that old witch,” Pansy sighed, flopping down on Persephone bed. “Hi there, Lily.” She smirked with her pignose.
She was warm—so warm. And tiny. She fit right in her hands and meowed loudly, looking up at her with blue eyes. The store clerk informed her that she, the kitten, would have green eyes by the age of eight weeks. She could feel her chest moving as she breathed, “Bonjour…”
“Oh you can ask your head of house for one,” He informed her and she grinned.
Persephone borrowed Ron’s quill, scribbled a quick reply of,
Her hairline belonged to her mother, her high cheekbones, and rounded face, her hidden angles—but her eyebrows were longer than her mother’s—she had her father’s long brow while maintaining her mother’s arch, it seemed. And his eyes—and her eyes. Her lips were rounded, round and full, just like her mother’s…the splash of freckles, exactly nine freckles on her nose were from her father…but the slope of a button nose was her mother’s. But when he smiled…her perfectly straight, even teeth came from him…
Everyone stared and then Persephone realized she was going to be sick.
There came no answer and the sinks started turning on. Panicking, she turned to try and turn them off to no avail—she was just hosed down. Weren’t sirens supposed to be useful in the event of a ghost trying to flood the bathroom?
"But there aren't wild dragons in Britain?"
“Right,” She nodded.
“Suffering from overheating, I just faint whenever it’s too hot, so…” Hermione lying to a teacher? Nice.
"Of course there are," said Ron. "Common Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell you. Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who've spotted them, to make them forget."
“Oh, how sweet,” Daphne said without a hint of genuine interest, “Well, unfortunately—”
Friday came with their final exam—the most dreaded of them all, History of Magic. It was simply awful—this was so
Suddenly, he laughed, like he had that day they had run through the halls with the twins, “Not illegitimate! Legilimens! No-majs call them mind-readers?”
Half the class groaned and Hermione let out a wheeze like sigh. Persephone docked George a point of trust—he had not been lying, then.
“Yes—there are some very bad people in the world who do not deserve children but I’m convinced you are not one of them.” She said. “I honestly cannot believe how dysfunctional our government can be, not allowing same-sex couples marriage. It is a human right, after all.”
"Master, you are not strong enough!"
She’d been looking forward to flying lessons—she couldn’t ask anyone older for what she should expect. Both the Weasley twins were on the Gryffindor Quidditch team and were thus excused from the class for as long as they remained on the team, something they adored rubbing in her face when they, too, had seen the notice. George spoke to her about how great flying is, which will greatly make up for it, but warned her that they wouldn’t be flying right away.
Thankfully, Hermione did not fling her arms around Persephone like how she obviously wanted to. Her head was still very sore.
“It is stupid for first years, ‘cause we don’t know any spells, but in proper duels its apparently much more fun.” He chewed on his kidney pie. “A second would take your place if you die, but, again, the only people who die in these are actual wizards in actual, proper duels.”
“Needing a tutor?” George continued.
Persephone did not want to leave the library—it was one of the only places the cold could not come into. When she could no longer focus on any book, she packed her things.
“Dobby, what is the meaning of this?” Persephone asked.
“Not happening,” George said. Ah, there was that Gryffindor pride.
“Nice,” Ben felt dripping as he waved his arms down to fling the water off him. He watched Persephone surface back up and she stared at him, eyes up. “Your hair’s white. Interesting.”
Malfoy had seen the dragon.
"They'll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George have lost loads of points in all the time they've been here, and people still like them." He said as they sat.
"Don't worry about that," said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head. "D'yeh think yer parents didn't leave yeh anything?"
“I’m sure if he’s so dedicated to house unity between Gryffindor and Slytherin, then he’ll stick around until after breakfast.” Persephone turned to look Malfoy in the eye as Ron slouched back into his seat next to her, “Or is it house-bickering that’s brought you here? Still celebrating ancient house feuds that have long been outlived, are we, Draco? Or is it Neville’s Remembrall? Too shiny to ignore?”
He jumped, looking back at them, suddenly seeing them. “Thank merlin! Draco said he was coming after you and he said you had a dragon and that you were in the Astronomy room—wait, where did you come from?”
Transfiguration, among Potions and Charms, was one of the class she was most looking forward to. It was taught by Professor McGonagall and she had a right mind to not ever cross this teacher.
“Barely,” Pansy scowled.
"Yes, but not to us," said Ron in exasperation. "Neville, you don't know what you're doing."
“Oh, you do have a secret admirer!” Daphne gasped. “Look how she’s blushing, Susie!” When she looked at Daphne, she couldn’t help noticing how perfect her face was when she became flushed with excitement. Oh no, oh no—Susan’s complexion suddenly glowed with the contrast of her red hair, making her look so—so…
a response came in her head. She suspicious—was it hearing all her thoughts?
“Yes!” They urged. “Today, you will be a part of something much bigger than one person. You will be sworn into our liege of mischief,”
“Ugh, I need a shower,” She grumbled, collecting her things. “I’ll see you later.”
The boys headed out, grumbling and yawning, and Persephone frowned. She’d seen the garden—it was large and was exactly as a garden should be—wild weeds, grass up below her knees and gnarled trees all around the walls, plants she couldn’t identify spilling from every flower bed and a big green pond full of frogs.
She thought that made sense.
And unafraid of toil;
She knew this, but hearing it being said out loud... A silence stretched out amongst them, whereas only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard.
"That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn," Firenze said. "Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips."
, people were pointing up at Persephone as it rolled, over and over. She could barely understand what was going on when suddenly, it jerked her unprepared self and she swung off, barely able to catch herself with one hand.
Upon seeing Hades, she had immediately looked around the room, looking for anyone she recognized from her house, but found all the students were wearing green and silver.
That night, she found a copy of Homer's Odyssey on her pillow. She didn’t really dwell on how he got up to the girls’ dorm—she mostly dwelled on what his real name was. Ben Solo was certainly not it—so what was it?
“How do I look?” She whispered.
Suddenly, the door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in.
They separated for a moment, and then she took her chances, spinning, and running at where she knew he was, and jumped up. As she expected, he caught her at the hips and pushed her up into a superman. Then he pushed her even higher and she spread her arms out.
Quirrell was too busy talking to himself like the lunatic he was, "What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!"
But, according to the large clock over the arrivals board, she had only ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and she still had no idea how to do it. She could only—she could only….she didn’t know what to do…she had no nerve to ask someone for help, no instructions to get herself onto the platform and she was alone.
"Oh, we found out who he is ages ago," said Ron impressively. "And we know what that dog's guarding, it's a Philosopher’s St—"
A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years.
“You…remembered my name,” He said dully. “I do prefer Ben.”
She closed her eyes, “
The further she travelled into the library, the more magical books she found on the subject at hand. She had a piece of parchment paper in her hand to write down the titles of books she would pick up to read later. She wondered if books misplaced themselves, as to make the journey harder than it should be. Some shelves had runes engraved into them, as if written in a different language. She decided she would most definitely take Study of Ancient Runes as soon as possible. Hermione agreed most enthusiastically.
Fifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They were off.
“Alright, perverts, who’s next?” Persephone called out.
“American version of muggle. Sounds better—less insulting,” He told her, “Soil to actually grow a wand needs to be fertilized with enchanted water and proper nutrients that you can’t find anywhere but somewhere magical.”
He hesitated in his nod, but he did nod, “I do. Bill more than Charlie—” He gasped. “Don’t tell anyone I said that!”
She met up with Ron and Hermione and worked on the little homework they had been assigned. Hermione and Persephone bid Ron goodnight and they went up to their dorm. Persephone waited thirty minutes before she slipped out of bed, and, grabbing her map, she went down to the common room silently.
Gilderoy Lockhart finally came into view, slowly and most graciously (barf) and took a seat at a table surrounded by large pictures of his own face, all winking and flashing dazzlingly white teeth at the crowd. The real Lockhart was wearing robes of forget-me-not blue that exactly matched his eyes; his pointed wizard’s hat was set at a jaunty angle on his wavy hair.
She had been walking back to the dorms from her Hufflepuff study group, which had been joined by Daphne, Reneta, Neville and Padma Patil, Parvati’s twin sister, when she heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead. She immediately resolved to find out what that was, drawing her wand and drawing closer.
“O…kay?” The adults all suddenly seemed very grim.
“No,” She told him straight out. “No it’s not.”
In a funny way, she was sure the boy cared deeply.
George and Fred were hysterical upon seeing him and decided they owed Persephone a huge favor for making them laugh harder than they had ever. Ron was happy—they high fived under the table. Hermione looked disapprovingly but kept her mouth shut. Even Neville got a kick out of seeing his bully humiliated. Most of the first years of all the houses did, and Persephone was left an anonymous savior.
The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Persephone had seen, the snake hadn't done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon's car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Persephone at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, "Phoney was talking to it, weren't you, Phoney?"
“He'd tell yer that's how it is at Hogwarts," Hagrid growled. "Copyin' lines! What good's that ter anyone? Yeh'll do summat useful or yeh'll get out. If yeh think yer father'd rather you were expelled, then get back off ter the castle an' pack. Go on"'
“Oh forget the greek gods, Lily, what’s it guarding, Hagrid?!” Hermione cried
Lavender shrugged, “What’s the worst that can happen?”
“I will sit still and look pretty…”
At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid's binoculars, but instead of looking up at Lily, she started looking frantically at the crowd.
"Nah. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it. 'Course, he shoulda sacked me instead—anyway, got yeh this..."
Persephone shrugged, “Flitwick gave me a book and offered extra lessons.”
Or maybe, they weren’t Greek gods, and they were just from a very important, secret underground society, like perhaps they were spies! Maybe that’s why aunt Petunia hated her mum so much! And that’s why they had to leave Persephone with Aunt Petunia! To protect her! Oh, god, she wanted to read the letter!
“Well, that fits in nicely, we can go and get all your things then, too,” Mrs. Weasley said, smiling at Persephone as she started to clear the table, “What’re you all up to today?”
She blinked heavily, yawning, “Right.”
She had gotten up early and showered, and took her time drying her hair as it was still too early to be in a rush. She used the gel on her hair to make her curls more prominent and placed a green headband on her head to keep her hair from falling into her eyes. She dressed in her summer uniform and smiled—the tie was now red and gold. How did it know what house she’d gotten sorted as?
“Ms. Potter, is there anything I can help you with?” Snape suddenly asked, looming over her desk.
She snorted, sipping her water, “What did he think would happen if I had accepted? That I’d throw sparks at him? Maybe throw in some buzzes?”
It wasn’t the fact that she was brewing potions for the hospital wing that her ancestor had invented that made her think really hard. It was the fact that Hardwin Potter, his eldest son, was married to Iolanthe Peverell and that she was a direct descendant of them. It was the name Peverell that was bothering her—she had heard it somewhere before.
As much as she was sure she’d read that name somewhere, she couldn’t focus on Flamel. Once the term started back up, Quidditch practice had started right back up. She had nothing else to think of—she’d auditioned for the summer dance program alright but not even that hogged her thoughts.
to stay in the game.
She daydreamed, for a moment as she stared at the sun filtering into the kitchen, of floating on the light. She liked the idea of the god Apollo lighting the world up, as Socrates had always said the sun was there to enlighten the truth to the naked eye. Apollo, the god of the sun and the truth…hm.
“Explain to me,” He said, holding the permission form between his fingers, “Now.”
She had to jog to keep up with Hagrid, panting as she asked, "Where is Gringotts, Hagrid?”
He was frowning at the snarling cat that took a long lingering look at the boy before dashing between George’s legs, straight to Persephone, throwing itself behind her. And then, as she turned around, it jumped her, quite literally. She gasped, hunching with the sudden cat on her back.
She stopped and looked at Ryn in shock. Pansy strutted out on stage, passing her a smug look. Persephone, still in shock, made her way off stage to let Pansy sing when Ryn stopped her, “No, stay—watch how she does it.”
“So…?”
Everywhere she looked was something she’d thought she was hallucinating—from bended books to cauldrons of all sizes, even the shops themselves offered Persephone amazement. They passed shops that sold robes, others selling telescopes and unfamiliar silver instruments. There was another shop that seemed most interesting, with windows windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels' eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon....
"I've already got us some rations," Uncle Vernon said, "so all aboard!"
"I won't let you in," he puffed. "Norbert's at a tricky stage—nothin' I can't handle."
‘Perhaps things were differently in the fifties, but he’s my friend—that’s all,’ but even to herself, that didn’t seem right.
"Finch-Fletchley, Justin!"
“Who’s got a secret admirer?” Daphne asked, appearing suddenly from the shelves, carrying a stack of books on Herbology. “Mind if I join?” She sat at their nods. “Who’s got a secret admirer?” She asked once more.
Persephone blinked.
“How poetic,” She grinned. “Now that’s its safe to ask, how come no pranks for your birthday?”
She was careful not to step too close to him when she turned to look into the mirror. He didn’t understand this comfort, for he moved right behind her, to stare over her shoulder at the mirror too. She had never smelt the terrible smell that Quirrell seemed to sweat so strongly before.
She felt dizzy but let her hands grab his arms in steadying herself. He shifted and let straps of bags fall off his shoulders. “I think getting on my back is fastest and seems less weird so do you know what a piggy back ride is? Do the English call it something weird like sausage back?” He tried to joke and she wanted to kick him.
“Where are we—woah.”
“Mm, didn’t get sorted,” He said simply, “I got to pick my house.”
“Herman, this is none of your business!” She snapped, glaring own at Hermione. “I’d greatly appreciate it if you left me alone!”
"Ah, go boil yer heads, both of y eh," said Hagrid. "Persephone—yer a witch.”
…Diana had given her as a gift. Persephone vows, one day, she’ll name her daughter after Diana, even after causing her such pain in plucking her eyebrows. She’d already packed nearly all her belongings into her trunk—all her clothes (non-magical and magical, as in, school clothing), her shoes (non-magical), her new hair and cosmetics products (non-magical and magical included) and all her books (non-magical and magical). The only things left in the room to acknowledge she’d ever belonged to that room was the beddings, and the floral prints.
Persephone had the best morning she'd had in a long time. She was careful to walk some space away from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn't fall back on their favorite hobby of abusing her. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his Knickerbocker glory didn't have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Persephone was allowed to finish the first.
"For the most powerful wizard in the world, you really are a dumbass…” She hissed and did the only thing that seemed appropriate. She landed her right hook square in the middle of his face and kicked Quirrell between the knees.
He looked at her in amusement, “Okay Seph.” He pointed his wand and without speaking an incantation, sent a light volt of red to the ground. Where it met the sand, it flamed hot and smoke floated away before revealing a jar. “Here. Fill it with water.”
Two among our number hold only nettle wine,
“I—just look, I did this,” She waved her palm at the water but
"Did something happen to it when Flint blocked her?" Seamus whispered.
“Well that’s something,” Persephone muttered to her friends. “So, each teacher is protecting the stone with something of their specialized brand of magic, no doubt…Herbology, Potions, Transfiguration, Charms and something of the Dark Arts…” She thought there was no way Quirrell could possibly find out each brand of protection and get passed it—but he probably couldn’t even get passed the dog.
“Right, Persephone Lilith Potter,” He said and she crossed her arms.
“Oh, Draco, hush—for how much you talk about her in the common room, I’d say you’re her number one fan.”
The first few days alone in the dorm were peaceful—she would listen to the roaring fire in the middle of the room, doing her homework with free leisure. She found some catalogues in the common room that you could order out of by owl and she got some presents for her friends.
Ron shrugged. She decided that Ron was no help and that she would just open it. If something happened, she at least had a witness. She unwrapped the light package and something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped.
Whether we be old and bald
Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble died away.
Alright, she could actually have some brain damage but…it seemed the diadem was…talking to her. It was definitely not her inner voice speaking. And what had it said?
It was hard to not get distracted, especially in Charms, when Professor Flitwick announced that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they'd seen him make Neville's toad zoom around the classroom.
“Ha ha ha—maybe I’ll chuck you at someone, how does that sound?” He asked in a mocking cheerful tone. “I’ll press play on the music box, but I’m not taking a step anywhere near the spandex tights.”
"Then we shall see you later,” Persephone sighed.
And then he dipped his two, dirty fingers—ew!—through the icing and stuck it in his mouth. Immediately, boils erupted all through his face and his hair turned an oily red color. Persephone clamped a hand over her mouth to stop from giggling.
She sat by the Trevi Fountain, again with gelato, wondering how much trouble she’d get in for swimming in the fountain. Shouldn’t sirens get privileges? They walked along the Tiber, and she was overwhelmed with emotion at knowing she was at the place where Remus and Romulus were once said to have been. Ben had annoyingly gotten several pictures of her crying by the river and she wouldn’t speak to him for an hour. They wandered the narrow streets of Trastever, on the west bank of the Tiber River.
"Told yeh, didn't I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin' ter meet yeh—mind you, he's usually tremblin'."
‘So…so it’s a figment of my imagination caused by anxiety and fear?’
She snickered, “Suits you.”
Persephone knew that being named Persephone did not qualify her to calm down the dog guarding hell—or just what looked like a trap door—under its feet. She groped around the doorknob, not truly caring if Filch awaited them on the other side.
He leaned forward, “My goals are practical—they set me up for the future in the real world. All yours do is prove you don’t like having a social life.”
He nodded, without meeting her eyes, “Are you two…like…boyfriend and girlfriend?”
She gaped, “T-that’s a lot.” The number frightened her—what if, in all those kids like just her, she couldn’t make a friend? The thought troubled her so much she thought it best to change the subject. “Must be a big school,” She said faintly.
"For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest!"
Persephone had waited until classes had finished and that Ron had come into the common room. Now having heard, he had dropped his bag and his mouth popped open.
“I’ll be waiting to open the door.” Dudley put on a foul, simpering smile. “May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?”
"Yeah—he's mine—bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las' year—I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the—”
Persephone paused, looking at someone rather familiar looking…he was a well-dressed, dark haired boy with very nice facial features that seemed very handsome…for a moment, she nearly did not recognize him.
“No, I mean,” Fred said, “His exam results came this morning and he hasn’t been gloating at all.”
“Persephone, sir,” She smiled. He nodded, smiling as well.
“You suck at potions!” She said immediately.
His face was nearly unreadable, but she knew he was definitely satisfied, “Yes, they should.”
"Another Weasley, eh?" Hagrid chuckled, glancing at Ron's freckles. “I spent half me life chasin' yer twin brothers away from the forest." Ron and Persephone nearly broke their teeth pretending they enjoyed the shapeless lumps with raisins. They told him about their first week of lessons as Persephone kept inching away from Fang’s drooling. Eventually, he rested on the chair she wasn’t occupying and she rubbed his big head.
twist of a story.
She coughed, embarrassed.
He thought for a moment before finally looking at her, “No reason.”
“Sure.”
The voice repeated in her mind.
“Of everything that lurks in there, which includes werewolves and giant spiders?” Or so she was told, “Yes! I am! Breaking a huge school rule? Even more so!”
One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The hairs on the back of Persephone's neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn't be.
“Hey Ron!” She laughed, bringing up her cupped hands with water in it and throwing it at him.
Several people screamed as the temperature suddenly dropped, "What the—?"
"Fred and George are in Gryffindor," he said, probably glad she didn’t mention what had just happened. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again, and she was glad he left the situation alone. "Mom and Dad were in Gryffindor, too, see. I don't know what they'll say if I'm not. I don't suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but I don’t think I’d want to be in Slytherin."
