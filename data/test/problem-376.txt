"Well I suppose this could have gone worse." He said with a smile on his face. Suddenly there was another crunching noise, much louder and more intimidating than the one the hippogriff had made. The bird looked up as well, scanning the surroundings for danger when it put itself into a defensive pose. Draco was about to panic once again, but before he could even register the movement he was grabbed by the torso and was being lifted past the trees. He continued to be lifted higher and higher and then he realized that this large bird was taking off with him! He was absolutely filled with rage and fear.
Draco was sure he was going to freeze to death. Or starve. Whichever came first. He was currently being held at an undesirably high altitude by the creature that he met in the forest. He didn't know what he had expected to happen, he couldn't really go back with the door busted, and now he doesn't even know how far they've flown. Draco opens his eyes, they were closed for multiple reasons; reasons he was reminded of when he opened them again. Reason one, he was a couple hundred feet in the air. Reason two, they were moving rather quickly so wind hurt his eyes. Reason three, it just reminded him of how far this creature planned to carry him. This time he kept his eyes open; eventually, he could feel hot tears threaten to spill out over his cheeks. There he was, no home to return to, and being flown off to god knows where. Draco brought up his hands to cover his face. He should have stayed in his room; god he wished that he never had windows in the first place. If that had been the case then he would have never been tempted to leave. Actually, thinking it through further, that would actually make him want to go out that much more. God, why did he want to leave so badly!?
“Nice to meet you two, My name is Draco but as you’re aware, I’m unaware of my last name.” Wonderful, he’s ruined it. Why would he mention the last bit? Draco supposes that they introduced themselves with their last names so he should at least try. Expecting to be shunned for what he thought was an awkward greeting, Draco was pleased to see grins on the pairs faces as they seemed to be mustering up some questions.
"Heh." Draco chuckles to himself. He could imagine the absolute outrage his parents would have is he said he wanted to go outside.
“He’s nervous to meet you two! Says that you should know about him too since I’ve told stories about you two.” Harry grumbled. He didn’t like how unusually pushy she was being and was surprised when Hermione’s face brightened.
“See, that’s something! He’s a bit shy to new people, what else?” All the meanwhile Ron was watching the two bicker as he ate his meal, like what a normal person in the dining hall would do.
“Draught of living death.” He answered almost immediately. The whole trio was awestruck by the fast answer, not even a stutter.
“You don’t know?” He asks, honestly surprised. He then lifts up his hair, fully revealing the scar on his head.
Draco sits there puzzled. He simply cannot find the words. He’s mildly concerned, should he have a last name? Last he remembered he didn’t have one. Actually, he couldn’t remember much of anything. He knew he was Draco, that was for sure, and he also knew that he didn’t know who the black haired boy in front of him was. He didn’t seem malicious, just curious.
“Oh! Well I’m Harry Potter!” The boy says with a smile. He sets out his hand waiting for Draco to shake, which he does.
Striding down the halls felt as lonely as ever. Every footstep just reminded him of how utterly alone he was. At times it was rather pleasant, he didn't have to worry about dealing with people for once but at times like this he just hoped that maybe someone would just show him  new. It didn't matter either way because after much thought and probably irrational judgement, Draco has decided that today will actually have an unusual event. He'd have to wait though, when his parents fell asleep and he could sneak about the house. He would pass the time though, he did feel the need to pack himself some things after all. Closing the door to his room Draco pulled out a chest from under his bed. It had dust all over it and cobwebs connected it to the walls the bed touched. Clicking it open, he had to rummage through it for a bit until he found what he was looking for.
“Leeches, fluxweed, lacewing flies, knotgrass, and the hair of the person you will become.” He wasn’t sure how he knew all of this content but Draco could feel himself begin to get all shaky. There was a strange ringing in his ear that wouldn’t go away followed closely by a sudden sharp pain to the head. He gripped the spot that felt stabbed and screwed his eyes shut. The group was silenced before rushing to his aid. The ringing got louder and their voices were muffled as the growing pain felt stronger and stronger. He could feel people surrounding him and touching his shoulders and trying to move his hand away from his head. He couldn’t hear. Draco’s hand fell down and he realized why they panicked so much. His hand was red and bloody and he could feel the liquid pool from his face. His vision darkened by the rims, slowly the darkness worked its way to overtake his vision before he felt cold, and couldn’t feel his fingers and toes. He slumped over, not really caring because the pain was nulling, but he could see something manifest as he drifted off into a blood induced slumber.
“Yeah, it was over before it started really. I was surprised by the fast result.” Eventually, Harry and Hermione got the idea to actually eat before visiting the blonde in his hospital bed, and Ron sat there waiting for the two to finish, annoyed that they could have just eaten in the first place.
“I uh… no.” Harry blushed, a bit embarrassed that he forgot to do that simple thing. The professor just sighed and continued to walk down to the infirmary. Harry eventually went to join her at the infirmary, hoping to apologize for just rushing out. It was a lot for him too. He was the one who just found him after all. The halls were much emptier than when he was out there with Ron earlier. There were only a few stray students with free periods and the occasional late straggler who rushed to their class. Harry agreed with some of the girls, Draco was quite the pretty boy. Thinking about it made him a bit flustered, what was he thinking? He’d only met the boy yesterday and found him half dead and bloody. Nonetheless he still found himself mildly attracted to the slim, blonde, and snarky Draco. Harry just ignored it, hoped it was nothing, and shoved away the feeling to be dealt with later. He was not going to make a problem out of the stranger, but he really hoped that they would soon become friends, or at least acquaintances.
Mistake. The claws might have not bothered the hippogriff, but a firm kick to the stomach did. So, with that one movement, Draco would learn that he maybe should have just waited to land. Not that he would remember this lesson though. Down, down down, he dropped. Through the air he fell, gaining more and more speed as he dropped. His eyes widened and he shot out his arms in a futile attempt to catch onto something. He continued to drop, and drop, and drop.
“Shut it!” Draco hollered at the bird and then continued to punch at it’s claws again. Unimpressed, the hippogriff just ignored him and kept searching the grounds below. Draco was absolutely livid at this point. He was flushed red from all his struggling and was now getting quite cold again with the sweat on his face. He would get ill if he stayed out here any longer. Eventually, the bird started to move it’s claws, Draco still in them, so that it was holding him like a child would a cat. It honestly hurt his arms and shoulders being held like this. Honestly this bird annoyed the living daylight out of him. He sighed before stiffening his posture to scold the wretched thing. He was a Malfoy, he would not be handled in such a manner!
Harry was getting quite overwhelmed by all of the blunt questioning. He wasn’t very keen on sharing since everyone already knew, but this boy legitimately had no idea.
“Maybe you can interpret it using common sense, it says here on the first chapter on how to make a shrinking solution.” She began, reading how to make the potion and for how long it should be stirred along with more long instructions that hurt to read all at once. However, Draco still had a weird feeling of connection with the content within the book. He couldn’t stop himself from interrupting by accident…
“Yes! It sorts you into your house, I’m in Gryffindor but there’s also Slytherin, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff.”
“He was sorted into Slytherin, it was actually quite strange…” Harry began, nodding off into his thoughts.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
“Well I would say that I am popular, but only because everyone already knows my name.” Harry says, grimacing at the memories of all the fake people who were only friendly because he had a title, and all the people who hated him for the same reason.
Maybe this wasn't the best idea he had ever had. He should have been bundled up inside of his room, sleeping until an inevitable nightmare would awaken him in the wee hours of the day. He moved silently, knowing where every loose floorboard was after years of roaming the manor halls. Draco rarely ever had a reason to awaken this late at night, but he had a few times, when the nightmares began and he ran to his parents room. They never let him stay, pushing him back to his own room without any real comfort, but that was just how they were. At least that's how Draco
“Well you said that this Draco wanted to meet us, and you’ve obviously told him about us, it’s about your turn to tell US something.” Hermione said in an urgent tone, and Ron just nodded in agreement. Harry was a bit uneasy with the thought; Draco didn’t have past experiences after all. Draco was nice though, sweet and kind but also very prissy from Harry’s own experience.
“What do you mean? If he doesn’t remember then he doesn’t remember, he did have a nasty fall after all.” Harry said; Ron just shrugged. “Well McGonagall’s office is here so I’ll see you later Ron!” Harry rushed out as he sprinted inside the room, hoping that the professor hadn’t left yet.
“Maybe he knows some things but has a hard time recalling?” Ron suggested. He had been quite silent the whole orderve, unwilling to interrupt Hermione when she was in her current “mode” of discovery. It wasn’t a bad idea though, and Hermione started to flip through the book with further enthusiasm.
“Um Draco… are you SURE you don’t remember ANYTHING?” Hermione asked, quite surprised that Draco actually knew advanced potion material.
"Aha! Got it." Draco said triumphantly when he pulled out a small messenger bag from the chest. It wasn't as dusty as some of the other items in the chest, but was a faded brown and the leather had begun to crack. Regardless of that, the silver clasp closing the bag still looked brand new as though it was a replacement to what should have been there. He closes the chest and pushes it back to its original placement. He walks over to his desk area, picking out his most important and favorite selections of books, as well as a few other small trinkets. He walks over to the side of his bed again and slides it underneath it along with the chest. Now it was all just a matter of waiting.
“Well I’m not sure what I would tell you.” Harry replied. The only thing of importance was his house, which had just been assigned.
to. He decided that his two best friends would do no harm with the information, and even if others managed to hear it, the worst that would happen is girls mocking other girls who weren’t in the Slytherin house.
“STOP STOP STOP!!” he yelled and shouted as loud as he possibly could. He started punching at the claws that held him to no avail. After another few rounds of struggle Draco realized that he had another line of defense, legs. He began to kick at the large beast and wriggle himself violently.
“Ah! You’re awake!” The boy says as he walks over to the edge of Draco’s hospital bed and takes a seat next to him. “Would you tell me your name?” Draco hesitates at the question, he does not fully trust this stranger next to him, and his mind seems fuzzy after being asked anything.
“I’m telling you Ron, he didn’t even remember his own name! And for once I don’t have a person instantly recognize me. I thought he was a muggle, but he says he knows magic!” Harry says as he and Ron walk down Hogwarts corridors. News had spread fast around the castle that a pretty blonde boy was found in the forest and was now taken care of in the infirmary, the teachers had to keep some students from peeping at the closed curtain. Every girl was swooning over the boy who dropped from the sky, saying he was an angel or something cliche that they liked. It was tiring with every other person asking who he was and how he found him. It was nice to walk peacefully with his best friend.
parents should be, it's not like he's seen any other ones. He had read about them though, in story books he found. They were loving and held their children when they cried, and never hurt them. When he asked why the parents in the book were so different to the ones he had, they just said it was a story. Exaggerated to be more appealing to the young mind, and he believed them. He still believes them; how could anyone love anything so much without the need for something in return. He wasn't able to find many fictional stories after that incident either. Draco didn't realize how lost in thought he was until he found himself in the kitchen, coat and boots on with his bag draped around him. He thought it be best if he packed some water and maybe some apples for his little trip just in case. Maybe he would be able to see a rabbit like the ones in the books! Would they accept the apple? They were known to be rather timid animals. He sighs as he steps to the door. He wouldn't have ever dared to step outside without permission before, but he wanted to know. He needed to know. Draco grabbed a knife that sat on the counter, the moonlight bouncing off the perfectly sharpened blade. It would be perfect. He brought the blade over to the nudge of rotting wood and began to hack away at the wood, little by little. Small moist wood chippings fell to the floor with each strike of the blade slowly revealing the makings of the doors lock. Draco's eyes widened more and more with every inch he hacked away; eventually the gap was large enough that Draco could slip his hand inside and try to grip the metal doorknob. He held on as tight as he could, but it seemed to move very little with each pull of his arm. Sweat began to bead on his forehead; what is someone were to catch him? The thought was unlikely, there hasn't been anyone here for years other than his parents and himself. There had been a few servants at one time, he didn't really remember them all that much. He did remember liking one of them in particular, what was her name? It didn't really matter now though, she was long gone never to be seen here again.
“So Harry’s probably told you all about us, yes?” Hermione asked him. That did not help in the slightest, Draco couldn’t really get the words out of his mouth and was hoping Harry would hurry the hell up so he would help him. He was still a while down the hall though, and Draco just sat there like a deer in headlights.
“Yeah… it was nothing. I’m-I’m fine.” Draco insisted. The trio just gave him a sad look before they headed out to their next classes. All but Harry.
“See! It isn’t that awkward!” Harry replied with a goofy large grin on his face. “I like it a lot more than my last name. You sound like Professor McGonagall-”
Harry was livid. It was currently the fine time of 12:34 am on a Wednesday and instead of spending it in his wonderfully warm bed he was out and about patrolling the forbidden forest on another detention. What deemed him worthy of the punishment you may ask? Well wanting a midnight snack still technically means you were out past hours, so he was properly punished. In Harry’s opinion however, it was properly rubbish. He could have just spent his time iside doing whatever work the teachers wanted him to do but apparently he was the only one trusted to patrol the forest. And it was freezing. He continued to make this way through the thick underbrush of the forest floor, tripping over larger protruding branches that hooked onto his feet and he walked. Dim moonlight filters through the trees, but just barely makes it to the ground. His lantern flickers as he walks in the dark, it is unsettling to most but nothing he hasn’t experienced already. All seems well in the forest and Harry was about to turn back until he could hear a soft call out in the distance. Thinking it was nothing he continues turning until another loud call reaches his ears, this time somewhat conceivable and clear. Harry turns back and begins to walk deeper into the forest, and with each step he can hear some sort of struggle. Eventually he can hear the voice clearly enough to tell that they are male, however at one point he cannot seem to get closer to the sound. He stands at the edge of a small cliff, small rocks and leaning trees disguise the slope but he managed to stop before he slipped over the edge. Puzzled, he searches the surrounding area looking for some sign of this voice. It could not be a prank, it was far too late at night, cold, and much too deep into the forest for anyone to come up with a rouse like that.
“The boy has woken up, says his name is Draco, but can’t seem to remember anything else.” Mcgonagall looks up at him, a bit distraught. She gets up and begins to head out the door.
Looking back to his hands there was the doorknob completely sideways in the door and no longer being of any usefulness. Draco smiled a large smile he hasn't been able to produce in a very long time. He slid his fingers in between the door and door frame as much as he could manage and with a simple tug the door opened up before him. A breeze pushed in immediately sending shivers down his spine and Draco squeezed his eyes shut not at all used to the sensation. He brought his hands up to rub at his arms hoping to generate some heat, reopened his eyes, and stepped out into the world.
“Wasn’t there a fuss about his house this morning?” Ron said, sick of the two asking nonsense to each other back and forth.
“SLYTHERIN!” The sorting hat declared. Everyone stood in silence before Dubledore took the hat away for Draco’s head.
“Well, for a boy who cannot remember his own past you seem to be quite strongly attuned with the Slytherin values.” He chuckled as the anxious aura of the room began to fade. The professors sighed as the tensions ended and had to push past students from the doorway while Harry and Draco sat there generally unsure of what to do with the information.
Draco wakes from the memory jumping up from his seat. Looking down he had fallen asleep again and had his face in the textbook. The candles he lit had long burned out and sunlight was shining through the window instead of moonlight. He's still shaky, it wasn't just a nightmare but a memory. He had been ten years of age. He eventually discovered what Hogwarts was to his parent's dismay but they soon realized that no matter how many times they shouted and beat him he wouldn't really forget about it so they gave up and told him that the place only taught wish-wash and what he was learning was ACTUAL magic. Of course Draco believed them for some time, but he soon realized such a school would not have such renown that even his recluse self would discover it. Sometimes he wishes he'd kept the book to himself and not asked his parents; they had searched the library afterwards and destroyed every Hogwarts book they found. He still wonders about the place from time to time, how
Maybe the situation could be a lot worse than it already was. Draco was always told that other people were below his family, so he supposes that the large manor house was a benefit. The thought didn't really help in actuality though. Draco continues to lie in the large queen size bed in the overly decorated box that he's lived in all his life. Despite that he was barely living. Draco sits up after another moment of time, ruffling the deep green blankets that drape over his slim form. He just keeps staring into the wall in front of him, an intricate wallpaper of roses and thorns. Eventually he gets up out of the bed and walks over to a large work desk, perfectly organized, not even the quill is out of place. Reaching over the desk Draco grabs hold of the thick drapes pulling them open. Moonlight flushes the once dark room, making it seem much more welcoming than it actually was. Draco keeps his grip on the drapes as he looks down onto the manor grounds below him. Flush green grass, large metal gates up everywhere, and perfectly tended flowers. There were probably other things in the garden that would be useful to his father and mother, powerful potion ingredients or even poisonous nightshade. Whatever worked he supposed. He continues to look out the window as his gaze moves away from what was inside the gates and finds that something that always made Draco's chest swell with a sort of tightness. The forest. He'd been let outside the manor once, when he was very young, and looking past the gates up close felt almost magical. How ironic. Looking at the swaying branches and how they filtered the moonlight still held the familiar feeling. It had been such a long time ago though, and even though the feeling remains he can't remember what it was like to feel the breeze of spring air on his skin. Draco sighs deeply; looking outside was just another reminder of what he would never have and what he really doesn't think he wants.
“Dropped down from the sky you say Harry? Well he must have been carried off by some creature then,” Hagrid says as he picks up the sleeping boy, “Well come on now, we don’t want the boy to bleed out now, do we? Off to the infirmary!”
“I-i… I’m not exactly s-sure.” Draco hesitates. He reels back emotionally when he sees the distraught in the other boy's face. “And who might you be?”
His small smile quickly fades as he remembers every incident about the outside world. Everything he would ever need was inside the manor, he didn't need anything else. He had survived the past 16 years here in the manor and he wasn't about to leave yet. Turning back around Draco lit the candles on the desk and grabbed a book from the shelves. Another one about potions, and boy was this a long one. Potions was one of the subjects his parents made sure to bicker on about the most, along with charms. They didn't really bother teaching anything else but the basics for every other class. One day Draco had found a textbook from Hogwarts itself, though his parents had failed to inform him about what Hogwarts was at the time. He flipped through the pages until he found the subject Defense Against The Dark Arts. Everything else has seemed to be taught, so feeling like he was lacking he asked his parents the same night at dinner about what the subject was. It was a mistake to ask. His parents fumed almost instantaneously at the brief mention of the topic, as though it was taboo. They got up so quickly it genuinely scared Draco about what they planned to do; his father had grabbed his arm and demanded to know where he learned of such a thing while his mother stared in disappointment.
It was the most bizarre meal that Lily had ever had.  The food was amazing, but Pansy was simply unlike any other person she had met.  Lily spent most of the meal staying quiet and listening to Scorpius and Pansy talk about the various people that milled within their social circle, as well as more about muggle ethics.  Scorpius was completely taken with the subject.  Pansy promised to send him a few books just before they left.  They got back to the castle very late, and although Lily wanted to, there was no opportunity for the two of them to talk over what Pansy had said before they were both whisked off to their dorms by their respective head of houses.
“I suppose I am.  Lily’s pregnant.”  Harry watched his therapist expression change from bemusement at his question dodging to shock at his outright statement.  Her usual composure dissolving for just a second.
“In the nightmare I saw Ron’s dad being attacked by a giant snake.”  Harry had started crying, and Blaise really didn’t know what to do now.  It seemed Draco did though, as he pulled Harry’s head into his chest and started stroking his hair.  Harry continued through the tears, seeming comforted by Draco’s actions. “It wasn’t a normal dream. I knew that it had really happened, and that Arthur Weasley was lying dying and bleeding somewhere, and no one was going to save him. I managed to persuade Professor McGonagall to take me to the headmaster, who confirmed it was real.  They got someone to Mr Weasley in time.  Just.  Dumbledore sent me and all the Weasley children to my Godfather’s place.”
Ron thrust the paper into her hands.  When she saw the lead article, she promptly forgot all about breakfast.
“I get that.  Lily’s view is that if they keep the baby and raise it, they’ll end up resenting all the things they couldn’t do because they were looking after a baby.  She is adamant that she won’t have an abortion now.  Not when there are other people who would want this baby.  She wants someone to come out of this mess happy, even if it isn’t her.” Harry sighed.
“This will cause a bigger media storm than the photo itself.” Harry Potter says, although Justin is sure that he’d not the one being spoken to.
“Yeah.  We were both pretty miserable.  Doesn’t change that I went about it all wrong.  I had reasons.  But I probably should have trusted you.  Ron would have ranted and raged, but I don’t think you would have.  Or at least if you did, you would have stopped and tried to overanalyse everything instead.”  Alcohol was starting to play havoc with his tongue, and he was saying things he wasn’t sure he wanted to admit.  Things he had only ever admitted to Draco – and his therapist.
“You know this doesn’t change anything right?” Malfoy eventually said.  “This thing between us can’t happen.”
piano concerto was on the stand in front of him.  The ‘Emperor’ had seemed appropriate when he had pulled a piece out of his collection of sheet music.  His father was dead.  The man who had shaped who he was.  Shaped his early years in both positive and negative ways. He had ultimately failed to live up to Draco’s childish hero worship.  Proved himself a scared, weak man, who had succumbed to the Dark Lord and then Azkaban.  Less than 3 years.  That was all it had taken to finish his father.
“So am I.  And besides, you’re our mess and we wouldn’t change you.  Let’s go find Blaise and apologise to him, all right.  I for one don’t think this is the right time to start dwelling on things.  Tara will be here tomorrow, and we can talk about all the maudlin crap we need to then.”
“Listen Draco.  I agree that your father’s funeral was not the best place to try and re-establish a relationship with your mother.  You were on a lot of extra potions that day, and you were mourning.  Your mother was mourning too.  It was not the right time.  But the potions.  They are something that help you.  If reconciling with your mother is something you want, then you should not avoid the tools that will help you achieve that.”
“I can grab mine and Draco’s stuff.  Or we can all go together.”  Hopefully, they’d decide Blaise could go alone.  It would give him some breathing room at least before he had to come back here and deal with the one bed.
Harry doesn’t care about Robards chastising him for missing work.  He’s been much more diligent about being here in the last few weeks anyway.  He heads straight to the lobby and the apparition point.  He pulls out his phone and texts Draco as he’d walking. It’s like déjà vu.  The same as the last time he’d felt the desolation of Draco trying to break it off.
“Well I was wondering whether you, or he, might have had any contact with Harry since he disappeared.”
“Hey, whatever does it for you.”  Ron said, looking upwards and shaking his head in fond exasperation.
“I didn’t understand half of what you just said, Potter.  But it shouldn’t be too hard to modify the spell I used on the floor to take off the wallpaper.”
“I’ve already done all of mine.”  Harry had completed his with Draco’s help.  In Harry’s opinion, Draco was much better at teaching than their professor.  Harry thought that maybe, this time, he’d actually get a decent grade for the work.   “I didn’t have much else to do over the holidays.  You should get started though.  You only have two days to finish it and Hermione will go spare if you don’t.”
“You should care.  There is nowhere we can be openly together.  We can’t spend our whole lives sneaking around everyone’s backs.  Pretending to be people we’re not.  I won’t do that to me.  And I certainly won’t condemn you to that fate.  That’s not your life Harry.”
“That had to have happened within the week before he got back together with Gin.  He didn’t respect her at all did he.  He got back together with her whilst he was in another relationship. I thought he was a shite before with the cheating, falling for someone whilst he was with her was bad enough, but this is something else.  I always assumed the start of the messages were when he first met the person, not something that started up after they were already together.  I guess that’s not really the point you need help with though.”  Ron had gotten himself caught on a tangent.  She didn’t blame him.  If it were true, it painted Harry’s behaviour towards Ginny with a much blacker brush.
“I do two full days a week, and sometimes get called in to cover the odd couple of hours here and there when we’re short on numbers” she replied.  “George and Ron manage the shops fine by themselves and we don’t exactly need the money.  I like to be useful and I love being around the children.” Angelina looked a little wistful at that last comment.
It was true.  The papers had mostly lost interest in Harry’s seemingly unseemly friendships with the Slytherins.  Particularly as all they ever seemed to do was sit and eat in restaurants or cafés, or take one of the children to the park, or go shopping.  It was all very boring and normal, which was how it was supposed look.  There were only so many times that they could publish the same thing over and over again and expect it to cause scandal.  The most controversial person he appeared with was Pansy, and even that was old news now.  Harry Potter didn’t care that she had tried to turn him over to the Dark Lord when they were teenagers, so why should anyone else.  Draco was a different matter, however.  He was still scared of the reaction that would come if he ever appeared with Harry, which was why he had put it off until now.  Blaise and Harry were clearly rubbing off on him if he’d decided that their first appearance together was going to be in England, immediately before the anniversary events.  That would make the front pages, of that he was sure.  Still the plan wasn’t to be seen, it was just to take a risk that they could be.  It was baby steps and it was a risk he could take for Harry.
With that, Ginny, a hurt expression on her face, turned and left the room, the house and, as far as he was concerned at that moment, his life.  Harry went into the kitchen and grabbed down the bottle of whiskey that they’d kept for special occasions and opened it.  Tonight, he needed to make everything disappear.  Getting
“Draco… It’s okay.  You’re not there anymore.  You’ll never have to do anything for the snake faced bastard again.”
His mother didn’t know the half of it.  What would she have thought had she not left for those first six months and had to see him locked away in one room, unable to leave for weeks on end?  Without Potter here for these last two weeks he’d almost found himself drifting back into the habit of shutting himself off again.  It was why he’d gone to meet Harry today when he messaged.  Why he’d instantly forgiven Harry for what happened with the Weaselette and suggested using her to benefit the two of them.  Draco knew he’d reached his breaking point.  He loved his mother, but it was an effort to be around her.  He knew his old friends wouldn’t want anything to do with him either.  Even if they did, he very much doubted any of them would be willing to visit England just for the pleasure of his company.  The only person he could be around and be comfortable with, it seemed, was Harry, however ill-advised it was.     Draco knew he was being stupid.  That before long Harry would see the error of his ways.  There was no future with a Death Eater.  For now, however, he couldn’t break away from the only person who was keeping him relatively sane.  The only person he felt human around.  The person he’d rapidly, and disastrously, fallen in love with.
“I know better that to drink that stuff.” Teddy grimaced.  “Harry’s right that the only way to manage it, is to drink a lot of it very fast, and then it just gives you an awful hangover.”
“Boys.” Andi looked at the two of them firmly before continuing. “Mrs Granger-Weasley came by earlier today.  I think I had her convinced.  At least she was leaving without asking to many questions… but…”
“Nothing useful.  This room is really unpleasant.  It’s making me feel sick.  It doesn’t want us here.”
“After the family that owned it stopped living here, it was used as military hospital during the first world war.  The muggle one, not our one.  Then it was used a convalescent home before becoming an NHS hospital.  It’s a private psychiatric hospital now.  Not so different from my home really.  Except my home only has one person struggling with life in it.  Seems a waste.”
“I’ve been eating.” Draco had lost a little weight and he knew that he probably wasn’t eating as much as he ought to.  Doris would no doubt talk about his later in the session.  It was another reason he had been avoiding her.
Harry felt like a great weight had been pressed down on him.  He wanted to talk to Sirius.  To ask him about the incident after their DADA OWL, but there was no way of contacting him that wasn’t being monitored.  All letters in and out of the school were being screened and read, and the only fireplace that allowed floo calls was the one in Umbridge’s office. Hermione had also chewed him out when he told her he wasn’t having anymore occlumency lessons.  He tried to explain that Snape wasn’t exactly helping him.  That he was quite able to keep Snape out of his mind and that it didn’t make a damn bit of difference, but she didn’t believe him.  She told him he should go to Snape and apologise and beg for them back.  He felt a little bad when he told her to sod off and stormed out to the Room of Requirement to wait for Draco and Blaise.  They didn’t take long to arrive.  Harry’s upset had obviously alerted Draco that Harry needed him.  Harry sobbed into Draco’s shoulder for a while, neither of them pressing on why Harry was upset until he had stopped crying.
Harry started with the excuse he’d given himself for arranging this meeting.  He handed over the letter and watched as Draco broke open the seal and read.  He expected a smile.  Some kind of reaction that told him Draco was pleased that his probation was over. Draco kept up the polar façade.
The blonde man turned his head towards the sound.  It was a slow and painful movement and Harry was sure it was the first time the man had moved in hours, if not days.
“I don’t know.  I do know I probably wouldn’t be here without you though.”  Harry didn’t like to think about that.  Didn’t want to relieve the memories of the first time he came to the Manor after the war.  Nor the times since then that he and Blaise had managed by the skin of their teeth to stop Draco letting his depression and suicidal tendencies overwhelm him.  Or the time, that was somehow worse, when they had to stop Draco in a fit of mania trying to break into the blocked off wings of the property.  No one went into that part of the Manor.  It was locked off for a reason.
“You carry on with your colouring Teddy bear.”  Harry reassured.  “I’m just going to get your cousin.”
“Just get out.” Harry sighed, aggression leaving him and instead a black feeling he hadn’t felt for years taking over.  “I don’t want your apologies or excuses.  Just. Get. Out.  We can sort out how we tell the kids and all the other details later, but right now I don’t want to look at you.”
“Still… you remember what it was like to be young and in lo…” Malfoy stopped himself from completing the sentence. “Sorry, I shouldn’t say that.  But you know what I mean.  They’re bundles of raging hormones.”
“Harry, Harry…. Where are my grey Italian lambswool trousers?”  Draco called from the bedroom, where he was getting ready to go out.
“Do you have a spare room?” Draco replied, remembering they had promised the previous night that they would take it slow.  They’d already overstepped that once today and he wasn’t sure they should do it again so soon.
“Andi knows it was a shit show the last time.  She wouldn’t have asked….” Harry gulped in air, scared to say what had been plaguing his mind since this afternoon.  “She wouldn’t have asked unless it was really important.  Whatever the reason she keeps needing to go to the hospital for, she’s a lot fucking sicker than she’s letting on.”
“Probably.  It’s actually a little better here than last time.  It’s much easier to ignore the ridiculous supposedly uplifting speeches with you next to me, rather than with an engagement ring in my pocket.”
“I don’t know why the room didn’t make a second bed for you.”  Harry said, sounding slightly confused.
Blaise was running late.  He’d had so much time out of the office in the last couple of months that everyone seemed to need something from him today.  He knew how much Draco hated it when either him or Harry were back late from work.  Not that that was going to happen with Harry any time soon.  He hoped that Harry had told Draco today about his quitting work.  The longer he put it off the worse it would be.  The one thing Draco hated more than anything was being kept in the dark.  Rushing through Grimmauld, and only just remembering he needed to grab the shopping the elves had done for them, he flooed back home.  The sight that greeted him was surprising.  It made his heart fill up with happiness, and then worry.  Draco and Harry were dancing together in the kitchen, looking at each other with delight and love.  He just knew Harry hadn’t told Draco.  There was no way he would be coming home to this if he had.  Draco noticed him first.
Teddy woke up just after 4pm demanding Cake.  Harry was unsure whether he meant Draco or actual Cake.  Draco was still snoozing, but he should probably be woken if he was going to be able to sleep that night.  Harry carried Teddy into the living room.  Blaise had gone into his office to get on with some work he’d neglected the day before so he could join Draco and Harry with Tara during their therapy session.  Teddy’s grin when he saw Draco, made Harry think he’d guessed the right cake.  Or maybe which cake hadn’t really mattered to the two-year-old.
Harry could tell she was close to tears, but still he couldn’t bring himself to feel and iota of empathy for the person who had caused Draco to break down like he had.  Even if she had no idea about the dramatic consequences of her actions.
“Harry…” Malfoy’s voice sounded breathy and desperate.  Harry pressed into the blonde man, feeling his erection pushing into his back.  Then the contact was broken as Malfoy stepped away, leaving Harry stood there breathing heavily.  His body desperately wanting the contact back.
“He wants to go to the funeral.  Going to the hospital didn’t really count as him leaving as he was unconscious.  I don’t want a repeat of the last time we tried to leave on the morning he buries his Father.  It’s going to be distressing enough as it is.”
“I think we should go to bed.  It’s nearly 1.30am.  I’m glad we know, but I don’t want to try and get through classes on no sleep, and I very much want to cuddle up next to you guys.”
Teddy sniffed loudly before continuing. “When I was leaving, I saw this woman on a bench.  She looked really unwell, so I went over to her.  I wanted to help.”
“I don’t see the problem.  As long as no one finds out, then it should be fine.  Besides, I’m definitely happy not being in Azkaban.”  Sirius tried to reassure his old friend.  He knew where this conversation was likely to end up.  The same place it had ended up when he had first been confronted with the two teenagers’ distrust of the man he’d always considered as one of the greatest men in the wizarding world.
“I think you should message her back and meet her for lunch tomorrow.  You gave her your number for a reason, and it wasn’t just because you were drunk and feeling reckless, although I know that played a part in it.”
They walked in silence up to the office.  The entrance was clear, and they were able to go straight in.  Doris stopped briefly in the reception area to quickly talk to the receptionist before ushering him through into her room.
“Of course Harry, I didn’t expect an answer straight away.  If you can let me know by June so I have enough time to find someone else if you decide not to take the position.”
“Not now.  After dinner, Teddy-Bear.”  Teddy stuck out his bottom lip, and Harry could just see the start of a tantrum.  He tried to head it off.  “We could do some colouring.  I brought your special crayons and picture book.”
Draco turned to look at his mother.  He felt stiff and dirty.  He hadn’t realised he’d spent that long engulphed by the black cloud that was never far from overwhelming him.  Time didn’t move how it usually did when he ended up in this state.  A week felt like both an eternity and no time at all when he was trapped in his own head.
“Here.  This will help.”  Harry took off his coat and wrapped it around Draco.  He was frozen.  Draco was leaning up against him, his bone cold fingers against Harry’s chest.  The wild magic disappeared when Harry’s arms were around him, and Blaise was suddenly next to them.  Harry was starting to shiver.
“I’m glad you did.  They both liked it.  I think they appreciated someone not just jumping to the worst possible conclusions and taking the everyone hates Death Eaters route, even though I’m sure that would have been easier for you.”
Teddy wrapped his little arms around Andromeda’s neck and gave he a slightly sticky kiss.  His mouth had the remnants of the orange juice he’d had with breakfast around it.
They were out celebrating.  It had been a month since they’d found themselves thrown into the past and neither of them had ever been happier.  It was just the two of them out, as none of the others had felt like it.  Narcissa felt drained after speaking at the trial.  Having to go over everything Lucius had done during the war, as well as her personal experiences of his temper was awful.   Especially with him sat there on the chair in the centre of the room glaring at her.  Just seeing him looking at her like that made her want to flinch and hide.  She’d had to think about the end result and how important it was for keeping Draco and little Draco safe from him.  That she was the only person that knew the information and facts that he couldn’t worm his way out from.  She’d burst into tears on Sirius’ shoulder when the verdict was read, and she was free from him.  All the years she’d been married she had never expected to ever escape, let alone have her rebellious cousin helping and supporting her.  When she arrived home it was to all of the warm support of the rest of the household.  She wished she had the energy to enjoy her first night of true freedom, but she didn’t.  Instead she crawled into bed, safe in the knowledge that she wouldn’t have to sleep with one ear open for her husband ever again.  Sirius and Remus had decided to stay home to look after the little ones and make sure that someone was there if Narcissa needed them.  Sirius had seen how frightened she was at the trial.  He was the only one of their little family that had been able to attend with her.  For the first time he really felt the importance of taking up his role as the Head of his House.  Most of the time he didn’t think about it, but it meant he could be there to support his Cousin.  Remus stayed because Sirius did.  He still wasn’t entirely comfortable around the older Harry and Draco.  It was getting easier for him, but it was slow going.  He loved both of them and felt protective about them.  That wasn’t going to change anytime soon.  The problem was that enough on some days it felt completely natural to have them around, on others he was hit over again with the realisation that they really shouldn’t be here and that the life he was now living was of a consequence of them meddling with something no one should ever meddle with.  Harry and Draco, however, felt elated and hadn’t wanted to stay in the house.  They wanted to go out and have fun.  They wanted to be irresponsible teenagers.  Harry wanted to go to the cinema, to his delight Raiders of the Lost Arc was playing – he’d always wanted to see it, but the film didn’t start playing till 9pm so they went and grabbed dinner first.
“Well when they are finished, I expect a grand tour.”  The elves had all become so much more confident and carefree over the last few months, since Draco and Harry had recruited them in cleansing the Manor.  They had their own trauma to deal with too, and like for Draco, bright colours and making rooms unrecognisable seemed to be helping.  Harry also expected Draco’s improved mood was also playing a significant role in the elves’ wellbeing.
“Me and Hannah weren’t suited.  We jumped into a marriage straight after the war, just like many others; trying to get through the grief of losing so many people.  You might have also noticed Hannah was trying to hide something from not only the world, but also herself.  She thought that if she got married to a guy who she liked and was friends with, she would fall in love with him.  It didn’t work like that, and I believe she’s infinitely happier with Daphne than me.  And I have my plants, my pupils and the other teachers”
“I really do mean it about wanting to see you again.”  Teddy said, and taking Justin by surprise, leant down, and kissed him on the cheek, before turning around and walking out.
Now there was a little less tension Harry moved into the kitchen properly and put the kettle on.  He heaped a few table spoons of coffee into the large café teirre, before pouring the boiling water in and leaving it to brew.
“I was visiting the boys yesterday when you arrived and stayed with them overnight.  I thought that you and I could catch up this morning.”
“Draco?”  Harry said, standing in the entrance of number 12.  “Draco are you just going to stand there or do you want to come in.  It’s getting cold and Kreacher says you’ve been out here for the last 20 minutes or so.”
So this is the last chapter with just an epilogue to follow. One thing I wanted mention is that I am a chronic pain patient following an injury over a decade ago now. I tried not to focus too much on living with chronic pain in this fic but what a lot of what Harry experiences regarding this comes from my own feelings and experiences with living with and coping with chronic pain. I’m lucky that I’ve had great support from doctors and other healthcare professionals over the years. I know that a lot of people who live with chronic pain struggle a lot more than have in moving forward with their lives but this is how I’ve experienced it. The other things that I have drawn from my own experiences are living with anxiety, SI, and coping with parents divorcing. Everything else was based on research or just my own thoughts and opinions.
“Well she did and she’s my mother and you’re my father, so I tried and got captured as a result.  At least Harry was able to get to the Manor to raise the old family wards to protect her.  She doesn’t know how that was done, just that they were raised.”
“You’re pregnant?  With his child?  Well you certainly wouldn’t have been able to hide that from me.”
When they arrived Teddy proudly showed off the cakes he’d been icing to his grandma.  They were a disgusting mess that only family could love, and no doubt contained the extra ingredient of Teddy’s saliva, but they all tried one dutifully.  They sat and ate a light dinner together, before Andi announced that she needed to get Teddy home.   The toddler stropped briefly at this, but seemed placated by the fact that he’d be back to stay the night in a few days.  When they had gone, and the mess in the kitchen was clean, Harry, Draco and Blaise settled down with a glass of wine.  All three had been pretty wiped by a day of toddler entertainment.
“Where should I start?”  Harry asked, not wanting to do anything without Malfoy’s permission.  This was his project, even though it had been Harry’s idea.  The whole point was for Malfoy to regain control of his own house.
“You’re perfect you know that.” Scorpius said and she smiled at him.  “I want to tell Father about you.  I was going to write him a letter this evening.  I wanted to see whether he’d let you come over during the Christmas holidays.  I could show you round the Manor. We’ve got an indoor pool, a hot tub, a half size quidditch pitch.  Plus, the games room is amazing.”
“Draco.  Son.  I should have done better.  I should have been a better father.  I’m sorry I couldn’t protect you.  Couldn’t protect your mother.”
“You’re not moving your hand right.  Let me help.”  Malfoy sounded slightly exasperated.  “How the hell did you ever finish school?”  Harry decided not to mention that technically, he hadn’t.
“We don’t know.  We were in the room of requirement and then there was a light, and we woke up in 1981.  And I know we probably shouldn’t have, but we decided to change some things.  The future wasn’t all that great to be honest.”  Draco said.  He’d come to stand next to Harry.  The babies were wriggling in their arms slightly trying to poke at each other.  Harry and Draco shifted a little so the two little ones could reach each other better.  It would be much easier to talk when the babies were entertaining themselves.
“The thing is, we don’t just have to reunite the snake faced bastard’s soul.  He’s going to need a body too.  I remember what you told me about the ritual he used before…”
“Hermione would love this.”  Harry said a little sadly.  He didn’t often think about the friends he’d left behind.  He missed them, just not enough to want to do anything about returning to a time when they were the same age and were friends.  It just wasn’t worth everything else that would come with it.
“I have first rights to your guardianship.  I only gave you to Hagrid to look after temporarily.  I wasn’t giving you over forever.”
“Do you think we should try and get Daddy to come and dance with us.  That’ll be fun won’t it.” Draco said conspiratorially to Callie, making Harry smile.
Harry could see Ron wasn’t going to take no for an answer.  He had to make one thing completely clear though.  On this one point he couldn’t budge.  Even if he wanted to.
Smith flew backwards, a satisfying thump reaching Harry’s ears as his body hit the staircase behind him.
Harry knew that Draco had been forced to take the Mark by his own father, and almost died when he refused too. He knew that Draco had secretly been feeding the order information for months before Bellatrix found out and tortured him so much that he had to stop. He knew that despite knowing what it felt like to be tortured he still snuck down to the dungeons to give food and water to Luna and Mr Ollivander, even healing them sometimes if he could. Harry knew that Draco had been fighting on the light side during the battle of Hogwarts, Harry had seen that himself.
“Draco? Can you talk to me please? I need to know you’re alright,” Harry whispered, watching Draco’s face for any sort of sign that he knew Harry was sitting next to him.
As Harry made his way back to the eighth-year common room, he continued to gently sooth the still shaking boy in his arms.
“Draco, firstly you did everything you could have done in the war. I mean it. I’m literally the only person who has a right to dictate who did enough and who didn’t. You did everything you could have done and more, and then you had to pay for it,” Harry smiled slightly as Draco’s eyes widened and his mouth fell open a little.
They would say that because of his actions in the war, and even before the war he was finally getting karma.
The sound of Draco’s voice snapped him out of the rage filled state he was in, and he let go of the handle of the door, something he hadn’t even realized he had done.
“It’s okay, shhh,” Harry whispered into Draco’s hair, arms wrapped tight around his shaking form. “I’ve got you, I promise. Your safe Dragon.”
, Potter,” Smith hissed, no doubt angry at Harry’s reaction. “I’m just issuing pay back, is all. It only concerns this evil faggot Potter, leave us alone.”
Harry chuckled softly. “You don’t need to apologies. That’s what you do when you care about someone,” Harry reassured.
“Draco?” Harry tried, he was getting extremely nervous at the other boys unmoving form just sitting over the edge.
“Draco? Can you tell me what happened?” Harry asked again, his hands twitching by his sides. He just wanted to hold the other, it pained him to see Draco like this.
Draco sat exactly where Harry had placed him, hair a mess, eyes wide and red. Eyes that where staring straight at Harry.
When Harry finally reached his room, he silently thanked McGonagall for giving them their own private rooms this year.
“No one comes up here,” Draco replied, looking at the sky again. “I don’t feel safe in a lot of the castle now and up here I do. It’s also a nice place to think too.”
Harry watched as Draco blinked before tilting his head a little to the left, something Harry knew he did when he was confused. Harry felt his smile widen at Draco’s cuteness.
“I was wondering where you were, so I checked my map I told you about and sore you up here and got worried,” Harry answered truthfully.
“Draco,” Harry said, his voice coming out commanding without him even meaning to and Draco must have heard it to because he removed his gaze from the sky and looked back into Harry’s eyes.
Harry slowly rose from the ground, taking Draco with him. He gently guided Draco’s legs so that they wrapped around his middle, and moved the hand that was holding Draco’s middle to under his bum. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck, his face still pressed into the join.
“Malfoy—where are you, you filthy little slu—oh hey—y Harry,” came the voice of Zacharias Smith, who was descending the staircase next to them.
Malfoy and he had talked a little this year, and Harry would definitely say that they were friends, if not something more. Harry had grown fond of the other man, now that they weren’t forced to be on opposite sides of a fucking war.
But saying that had apparently just made Draco even more confused because his eyebrows came together in a sort of cute frown.
Draco looked surprised at this and Harry’s heart ached a bit because he knew it was because Draco wasn’t used to people being worried about him.
When Harry reached out and took Draco’s hands in his own, trying to comfort him, Draco looked back up at him.
“Secondly, I’m sorry about your mum. Have you gone and visited her grave yet?” Harry asked, feeling helpless when a flash of pain went across Draco’s face.
“Right… yes. Thank you, that would mean a lot to me,” Draco replied giving Harry a small smile in return.
After, he stepped back and removed the shoes he had quickly put on earlier in the night and surveyed the other man.
So much evil had transpired here— and yet, people still found a way for this place to bring them happiness. It gave him hope.
Harry was just about to ask again, at a loss for what to do, when he heard someone call out for Draco.
“He—he tried,” Draco paused. He took in a ragged breath, blinking several times before looking down at his lap.
He wore the most heartbreakingly vulnerable expression Harry had ever seen, and it almost broke him then and there.
“Anytime Draco, anytime.” Harry replied, his smile widening again when Draco lent his head on his shoulder and let Harry take his hand in his.
“I promise he’ll never hurt you again, I’ll protect you,” Harry murmured. He brought Draco’s head down onto his chest and held him even tighter when Draco burrowed face into Harry’s neck, tears still leaking from his eyes.
Harry felt touched that Draco had told him that with basically no prompting. But he also felt sad that Draco thought he hadn’t done enough.
Harry had woken from a nightmare about an hour ago, and had quickly found that sleep wasn’t going to be an option for the rest of his night.
“Oh,” Draco whispered. “I’m sorry?” He said and looked even more confused, like he didn’t know whether he should be apologizing or not.
This time, Harry joined Draco on the bed. It was clear the other was having a hard time talking about what Smith had tried to do.
Harry watched for any sign Smith hadn’t been knocked out, before drawing in a heavy breath and looking back down at the shaking form in his arms.
Harry continued his soft reassurances as he removed Draco’s shoes, and laid them both down gently on the bed.
Harry gasped in shock, almost falling backwards with the force and shock of the motion before hesitantly wrapping one hand around Draco’s neck, the other around his waist.
He wondered if he should reach out and take Draco’s hand or something but thought better of it, just because they had been talking on friendly terms this year didn’t mean that Draco would appreciate that.
Instead, he had decided to walk around the deserted castle, something he had been doing quite a lot since being back at Hogwarts.
“What were you thinking about before?” Harry asked, shuffling over to Draco so that their thighs were touching.
Most people would have said that Draco deserved the constant bullying he got and the abandonment of everything and everyone he had ever known but Harry thought differently.
Harry felt his smile drop at Draco’s admission that he didn’t feel safe. No one should have to feel like that at school, especially when people blamed their behavior on the things he had done when he was just a stupid kid.
Harry released his arms and Malfoy got up.  Harry felt cold and empty.  He knew that everything Malfoy had said made sense.  It didn’t help though.  He just wanted the idiot blonde back in his arms.  Wanted to run his fingers through the silky hair.  Wanted to kiss away every tear and dark thought.
“He’ll come.  I’ve seen how you two are with each other.  I’ll bring you over one of our scones with your tea.”
“It’s not the life I want.”  Harry said desperately but knowing that there was nothing he could say to change Draco’s mind.  Hating that the man had resorted to his school yard tone to try and make Harry give up his argument.
“I’m really not sure about this…” the girl stammered nervously as Harry started walking towards the backroom, she was clearly new to the job and despite his celebrity status didn’t recognise him.  He was definitely getting old.
spindle on the right and then tapped Harry’s wand on it, followed by the one Narcissa had pricked her finger on.
“But it will give them a great opportunity to see plants from different parts of the world, as well as some of the ways muggles have come up with to ensure the sustainability of their world. Let them experience the diversity of plants there, as well as learn about how the muggles are trying to deal with climate change”
“When you first left, we didn’t even know if you were alive.  We didn’t know whether someone had taken you against your will.  We searched for you.  Do you know how much effort it took to get into that foul bedroom in Grimmauld?  And when we got in all we found was the evidence of your affair.  You used the same bloody techniques you learnt from criminals covering their tracks to escape.  You let Malfoy use fiendfyre just to stop me tracing you.  I just can’t fit the you we used to know, with the person standing in front of me.”
“How noble Potter.  But I think we’re done for the day.  I’m tired.  One of the elves will show you out.”
“A muggle cartoon...  It doesn’t matter, what matters is what the potion does, which I guess is turn you into baby versions of your Animagus, but without any control over, or memory of what happened?”
“What happened?” Ron replied. “Because there is no way the Harry I know, would have broken two Death Eaters out of Azkaban.  Especially not Malfoy.”
“They still had sex with him the night before he did though.  And the bitch only managed 6 months before she contacted him again.”
“We can’t just do this every night.”  Blaise said, once Harry and Draco had recovered back to a state where they could concentrate on anything but each other.
After Harry’s break down things settled down for a few days.  Tara came by the next day and spoke to both Harry and Draco and was due back on Saturday to talk to the three of them together.  Harry’s wounds were healing, and he had only needed the purple potion once, instead managing mainly with the lavender one.  Draco was baking again, and Harry spent his days watching Draco dance round the kitchen to muggle music, laughing and tasting the various in progress creations.  When the weather was nice, they walked round the extensive gardens or just sat out there and read or talked under piles of blankets.  Warming charms keeping away the December chill.  It felt more like a holiday to Harry, than him being off on sick leave.  There were still the even dressing changes, but the wounds were healing, and his head was hurting less.  On Wednesday afternoon, when Blaise got back from work, Harry headed out of the house and its grounds, secure in the knowledge that Draco was safe and happy for the time being.  He went to see Andromeda, who he’d missed, and Teddy, who he’d missed even more.
His mother had stayed conspicuously away from him throughout the whole ordeal of burying his father.  Something, he was sure, he would have to thank Blaise and Harry for at some point.  There were only five of them present the funeral, yet somehow, she had kept her distance.  The funeral was over now.  There was to be no wake.  Now he had to talk to her.  Or at least try.
“Fine, I’d rather you just gave up, but then you wouldn’t be the Hermione I love.  Don’t tell Gin about this though.  It’s not fair on her.”  This was the one point about Harry that both of them were completely in sync on.  Telling Ginny, or the rest of the family, was not a good idea.  It only led to more distress.
“We’ve got you Tom.” The first voice said.  The one that sounded less like the stuck-up purebloods.  “Open your eyes properly if you can.  It’s been nearly a week.  We were so worried about you.”
They caught up on the inconsequential events that had happened since they’d last seen each other.  All of the minor irritations at Harry’s work and Narcissa’s frustrations at the house elves and Draco’s encouraging of them.    Harry was surprised at how quickly time had passed when the bell came for last orders.  He still wasn’t ready to let Draco go.
Harry laughed; he couldn’t help it.  Clearly it was his fate today to walk in on people inappropriately dressed.  He was just glad McGonagall had been in her robes.  He didn’t think he could have coped with the sight of his Professor in her underwear.  “I think I’ll leave you two to it.” He said still chuckling.  “There’s only one person I want to see dressed like that and bringing me tea and it’s not you Neville.  You look lovely as always Pansy.”
“We’ll send you some as soon as their ready.”  Draco grinned.  “I’m sure Arti will enjoy the task.  He does get a little fractious when he doesn’t get out enough.”
“Harry, I’ve probably known you were gay longer than you have.  Certainly, longer than you have admitted it to yourself. That little piece of information is hardly a surprise to me.  There really is no need to feel worried about me knowing about that.  But yes, he mentioned you had ‘come out.” Malfoy’s eyes were locked on his when he said this.  Harry held his gaze for several seconds before looking away and continuing the conversation.  Every inch of him was aching to reach out and touch the blond man.
