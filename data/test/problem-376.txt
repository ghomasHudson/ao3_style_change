blaise: well i wanted to ask u something
harry: yes???
seamus: oh uh i don’t have a date yet
“Fantastic”
pansy: we are sitting at the same table as u
harry: ok
neville: we know u guys finally got together after the dance
neville: actually i wanted to talk to you about that
blaise: i mean it’s the weasleys...... u know how our parents are about all that blood traitor shit
hermione: what?
“Shit indeed.” Pansy shoved one more bit of jam covered toast into her mouth and wiped her hands off on her stockings.
hermione: they’ve been bursting mine for years
harry: come on ron be a big boy
draco: UR SO DEAD
pansy: imagine being a gryffindor
blaise: i mean no i’ll go i’m not busy that’d be nice
harry: i’m not mad babe
harry: THE BABY BONNET JAKAJISKA
draco: it was an accident
“Listen, all I’m saying is that there’s no way that the Puffapod was the reason that I felt light headed. It just doesn’t work like that.” Blaise explained further.
Draco rolled his eyes. “See you guys.” As they walked off, Blaise turned to Pansy.
remus: you know? i was actually starting to like draco, but now i’m covered in glitter so...
“Seamus.” Pansy whispered hurriedly.
pansy: oh come on draco we’re gonna find out eventually
draco: we will?
draco: yeah blaise i don’t know if ur familiar with the topic but it’s called flirting
neville: snakes ruin people’s gardens
seamus: dean has met my parents on multiple occasions pansy....
remus: alright what’s up
“Well, that’s just not true.” Harry mumbled. “‘M gonna take a nap.” His eyes fluttered closed. “‘Wuv you.” Draco smiled slightly and returned to his book.
remus: sirius black i swear to god
harry: so um, nott edited it. it was literally a picture of draco and i at first and he photoshopped a random guy where i was.
harry: oh no
blaise: sure you do planty mc planterson
draco: pls i miss u ❤️❤️❤️

neville: hey guys

harry: no no i think they should continue
blaise: love ya 2
neville: i’m heading to breakfast who’s joining me
pansy: i wouldn't
hermione: did u say anything else after that?
harry: i love u
hello wonderful people. i am aware that it has been quite a while since i updated.... SORRY IM SO SORRY. I LITERALLY JUST LOST TRACK OF TIME AND TODAY I WAS LIKE “oh shit it’s been three weeks” SO VERY SORRY ABOUT THAT.
hermione: if it makes you feel any better harry stalked you all of 6th year
pansy: then why’s he helping you
blaise: draco’s dad is gonna be
harry: night love u
pansy: draco?
neville: thanks
blaise: yeah, we kissed
ginny: he didn’t ask her, he screamed it at her and then nearly fainted
draco: we’re over i can’t handle the way u speak
seamus: it’s fine dean
draco: harry will probs just go with his friends
“Same thing. Oh! And they taste like, um, the booger flavor of Bertie Bots Beans.”  Blaise finished confidently. Neville raised his eyebrows at him.
ron: yes ma’am
"Sirius." Remus said.
draco: ok and???
"Hi." Neville answered back.
remus: no it’s fine ig
seamus: i’m worried about u
“Alright.” Malfoy moved closer and bent down to kiss Harry goodbye. “Text me when you get back.” Harry leaned up to give him another kiss which Draco smiled into.
draco: love you
draco: night darling
seamus: mhm
ron: yeah wtf does that mean
“Let them.” Harry whispered back. A small smile grew on Draco’s face. Soon, the dining hall returned back to normal. A few other students moved. Mostly siblings.
blaise: still waiting to hear back
ginny: guy?
harry: i’m gonna be honest, i’m not exactly thrilled either
blaise: i saw you staring over here don’t act like you weren’t
“Just fucking peachy.” Draco said as he joined them at the table, his voice laced with sarcasm. He quickly kissed Harry’s forehead, but Harry pulled back and gave him and odd look.
seamus: pleaseeeeee
“Draco.” He father’s voice said calmly. This seemed to surprise everyone at the table. “Don’t think we haven’t heard the rumors. This was the last straw. This confirmed our suspicions.” His father’s voice remained steady and calm. “DO NOT RETURN TO THE MANOR.” Ah, there was the yelling. “PEOPLE LIKE YOU ARE NOT WELCOMED IN THIS HOUSEHOLD.” Draco knew exactly what he meant by that. Of course. The Daily Fucking Prophet. The pictures of him and Harry. “YOU ARE A DISGRACE TO MALFOY BLOOD LINE.”
neville: i win
draco: nope sorry
"Yeah, well, he means well. He's just worried. I mean, it's totally insane, but..." Remus trailed off. "Draco. How are you?" He turned to him and asked.
“You look fine Seamus.”
seamus: cool
draco: why the hell are you texting me i’m sitting next to you
harry: no u cant.
hermione: uh huh
(See the end of the chapter for

ron: answer me
draco: do you ever wonder if my father actually heard about anything?
neville: i-
harry: you wish malfoy
harry: yes it is babe
“Nice one Potter!” He yelled across the library. “10 points to Gryffindor!” This was of course followed by the shushing of many students because they were, in fact, in the library. Draco slapped Blaise’s arm, but Blaise just turned to him and whispered. “Soft.”
“No, no. Neville’s right.” Connor spoke up. “Puffapod’s spores cause dizziness.” Neville clapped his hands together.
“Why are smiling so god damn much?” Pansy asked Draco. “It’s fucking creepy.”
harry: wdym
neville: WHY ARE WE YELLING
harry: no babe i’m sorry take it back
harry: boring we’re just going over rules

ron: hurry tf up slow pokes
harry: ur so mean i hate u
harry: all. day.
harry: listen they’ll get over it eventually if they really care about me, which they do, but i’m not getting over you for a long time okay?
“No. Not right now. I mean, like, in general.” Harry waved his hands around as if he was trying to emphasize his point. Draco gave him a sad smile and laid his head onto Harry’s shoulder.
pansy: LMAOOOOOOOO
ginny: same here
"No." Draco answered. Harry nodded as they approached the office door. He looked at Draco and then knocked on the door. Draco tensed up beside him. The door opened slowly to reveal Remus. He looked back into the room, stepped out of it, and closed the door behind him.
draco: no it’s not i can’t lose him
blaise: very funny pans
draco: nope
seamus: ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
ginny: bye bitch
neville: i’m slightly concerned, but mostly happy that ur so excited
pansy: LMAOOOOOOO WHO WAS IT
blaise: we’re back
harry:what if i don’t wanna forget it?
blaise: pumpkin?
“The Puffapod is pink and purple in color, and consists of pods that hold pink shiny beans. The Puffapod’s spores can cause dizziness- okay you know what?” He playfully threw the book back to Neville who laughed lightly.
draco: do u have free period rn
neville: i like magical plants
neville: mmm i like that
remus: mhm
harry: yeah with ron, hermione, dean, neville, and seamus
pansy: aNYWHO
hermione: SOMEONE GRAB THE CAMERA WE NEED THIS DOCUMENTED
harry: yeah hopefully
seamus: neville’s a snitch
hermione: harry remus and sirius aren’t gonna give u special treatment
“Neville’s right Harry. Just try to hear him out. I’m sure it’s all just some big understanding, and that Draco is hating this just as much you are.” Hermione rubbed his back slowly. For some reason, Hermione was always the voice of reason.
"So," He started. "Why exactly are we here?" He sat back in his chair and waited for a response. Draco looked over to him. They made eye contact, and Draco returned his attention to his meal.
harry: love u more
sirius: i know how hard it can be, even if u hate your family
“Sorry. Uh, bathroom.”
draco: fine
draco: but how
sirius: just rip off the bandaid
neville: bye blaise
pansy: BLAISE HAS GOT A BF
neville: can i talk to u about something?
blaise: wait what
ron: no don’t ignore me
draco: we didn’t really give our parents an option
ron: well, we’re friends. that’s what friends do.
harry: i never really hated you
hermione: what. an. idiot.
harry: it’s not really what she said that’s bothering me
pansy: hm i guess i can just ask him
draco: i would never cheat on him you guys
draco: yeah but you pick on people MORE when you like them
blaise: nice name flower boy
ginny: hey?
blaise: potter

blaise: and he wasn’t suppose to find out that it was us
draco: k

harry: that wasn’t very nice mione
pansy: you guys do realize that we are in this chat right?
draco: so ron

neville: incest
hermione: i know so
draco: no no i didn’t not mean it, but i didn’t
blaise: oh well if it is
dean: omg don’t say sup
Eventually, the boys laid down. Harry was wrapped in Draco’s arms. They would exchange kisses every once in a while, or mumble about a certain star that they saw. They truly felt peaceful for the first time in a long time.
pansy: you look like a god damn tomato
ron: i don’t think i could stand looking at that for too long
ginny: okay bitch jesus how are feeling about school than
(See the end of the chapter for
pansy: ugh fine
ron: so
harry: IS HE FINALLY ACCEPTING THEM AS, DARE I SAY, OUR FRIENDS
neville: <3
ginny: yes i already know all of this
harry: like a lot
ginny: well that’s already not gonna work
neville: blaise
“Would you keep your voice down?!” He said to her. “And no I do not.” Ginny scoffed.
hermione: nope
"Yep, but if you hurt Harry, it will not be pretty." He warned. Draco swallowed nervously.
neville: a bloody unicorn i-
harry: why would you say that she didn’t say anything
draco: mhm
“You know what’s odd?” Draco asked, and Harry hummed in response. “If we hadn’t gone to the toilet at the same time, we’d probably still be acting like we hate each other right now.” He continued. Harry turned his head up to look at him, and wrapped his arms around him.
draco: you don’t have to do all of this you know
draco: no no no then we’ll clash, we’ll look like christmas babe, christmas.
pansy: how’s the mr.?
“Who gave you the photo?” Draco snapped.
The kiss was way to short in both of their opinions. As they pulled away they looked at eachother. Yeah, maybe everything was starting to be okay.
blaise: and i said LEGGO
ginny: we did and no i’m not jealous why tf would u think that
ron: i’m just making sure
dean: you sure?
harry: what if i don’t wanna forget
draco: yeah
draco: idk like being close with someone, cared about someone
hermione: ronald
remus: i know i’m the meanest person ever
“Never mind.” He looked away, and his gaze automatically lingered over to where Neville sat.
blaise: ttyl
harry: yeah
pansy: don’t worry dean will come around
pansy: fine convo starter- what is everyone doing for the holidays?
neville: alright i guess
pansy: ok so
draco: so?
harry: what do i do
“I’m sorry.” Harry sobbed into his shoulder. Draco held him closer. Harry never wanted him to go. “I’m so sorry. I shouldn’t have been so mean about it.”
“It’s fine Gin.” Hermione spoke up. “It was just safer for them that way.” Hermione gave Pansy a small smile.
draco: bitch what
harry: heyyyyy heyyyy how y’all doin’
hermione: watch it
sirius: that woman was always rolling her eyes
pansy: stop apologizing u big twat it’s fine
pansy: OMG
harry: hey
draco: I REFUSE TO BELIEVE IT GRANGER
ron: told u it was a bad idea
ron: you’re brilliant
“That hurt.” Draco muttered as he passed Pansy and Blaise his phone. Pansy sighed.
draco: alright blaise let’s wrap this up
ginny: study session?
remus: sirius it was a private teacher no students meeting for a reason, honestly you’re gonna get us fired
draco: don’t sweat it i’m over it
ron: oh boo hoo u were mean one time in ur life it’s the end of the world as we know it
harry: unicorn???? what???
harry: alrighty
ron: i’m glad
neville: nothing
hermione: okay???
neville: bitch
sirius: harold jameus potterus
draco: oh no i am most certainly going to still be making fun of him
"Yes sir."
luna: neville come on she's just processing
harry: thanks guys that means a lot
harry: i am
draco: love u too
pansy: because i-
seamus: no i’m okay
seamus: oh fuck off
blaise: no ur not cause then you’ll get a detention
harry: i hate u guys
ron: answer me
ginny: wHAT
dean: ya know? yoda
blaise: no need to explain just go along with it
blaise: ‘blaise did you see potter today? isn’t that sweatshirt so stupid?’
(See the end of the chapter for
draco: what happened with neville?
neville: ik but do u think that he thinks it’s a date
draco: that’s new
hermione: i’m going to bed
draco: can you call?
draco: ugh fine anything for u my love
seamus: hey uh so just clarify, we’re just going as friends right?
pansy: ya know.... two can play at that game seamus.......
neville: mmm no
harry: nothing
pansy: mhm
“Look,” He started with a quieter voice this time. “I’m not breaking up with him. So you can either accept that, or figure out something else.” Then Harry walked out of the office and didn’t look back. He left a shaken pair of uncles behind him.
pansy: so
seamus: it’s nothing
connor: now what book could possibly be interesting enough for you, pansy parkinson, to have ur head stuck in it for the past hour
dean: what
dean: no really it’s no fun without you
harry: harry yes
harry: stop being homophobic ron
“Really?”
harry: i hate you guys
“You keep staring over at them.” She gestured to the table where the others were sitting. Blaise saw her and gave Neville an odd look. Neville looked down with a blush on his cheeks.
dean: i’m not mad
blaise: how’d it go
draco: WHO WHO WHO
blaise: night
hermione: i think i always knew that harry like him, i just didn’t realize it until now
blaise: prepared
haha i love drarry
blaise: ur never a bother, i just wasn’t one my phone
blaise: who else would we’re the only people that know about it so far
“Well what if I did.” He retorted. He didn’t like him back. Did he? No, Seamus was his best friend. Hannah sighed and walked back into the ballroom, leaving Pansy and Dean in the hallway alone.
pansy: well why wouldn’t we be???
pansy: am i high or did ronald billius weasley just invite us to his house for christmas?
neville: it would be a shame if u were to end up like the unicorn
ron: i mean, i’m sure mum wouldn’t mind a few extra guests
neville: yeah how much more bonding could we possibly need
“I obliviated them.” Hermione explained shortly. Pansy looked taken aback.
ron: so where’d you sneak out to tonight?
“And why should I believe you? It looked perfectly real to me, and your track record isn’t exactly helping the situation.” Harry spat at him. Merlin, why couldn’t he just be good at things like this. It would be so easy to just believe Draco, so why didn’t he. Draco looked taken aback.
pansy: :)
"Um, er, yeah. Right in here." Professor Sprout rounded the corner. Her eyes widened in surprise at the sight of Blaise.
pansy: that’s simply an impossible request
ron: i don’t wanna see that
draco: I DUNNO
seamus: it’s literally a school dance
neville: i’ll see you wednesday to study
harry: hmph
pansy: no they’re all too oblivious
neville: i hope you feel better
pansy: draco got with potter. anything’s possible.
connor: how many times do i have to tell you not to call me that
ginny: pick ur phone back up
remus: you blocked him? so u didn’t even try to let him explain?
ron: ^^^^
“No.” Draco said simply. “But who is nowadays?” Harry hugged Draco and sighed.
ron: i just need to make sure that this relationship is strictly a lovers relationship
pansy: shut up
ron: night
draco: good
neville: what?
blaise: yeah?
“Oh for Merlin’s sake Draco. Stop pouting.” Pansy rolled her eyes as she interrupted the comfortable silence. She shoved a piece of bread into her mouth and continued on. “We’ve had hundreds of howlers before. We’re used to it. These ones aren’t gonna be any different. Besides, they’re not crazy. It’s not like we’re gonna get disowned for not spending the holidays with them.” Draco gave Pansy an amused look.
draco: are u out of lunch yet?
pansy: you, me, yule ball
draco: do u think weasley sent him?
pansy: but i’m not gonna, can’t sleep needed someone to annoy, that’s where u come into the picture potter
harry: where’d you even get that?
pansy: NORMALLY CHRISTMAS IS FILLED WITH BORING DINNERS AND DEATH EATERS
pansy: PLS THIS WILL BE THE THIRD TIME AND PROFESSOR LUPIN WILL KILL ME
seamus: ...
draco: damn muggles
neville: fascinating really
hermione: hey we’re all really worried about u guys
remus: and minnie tells us that u didn’t even so much as glance at draco during her class today
hermione: same goodnight
hermione: she already knows that u and harry are dating and that didn’t seem to bother her
neville: ok fine bye blaise
hermione: i’m gonna have to agree with ron
neville: that made me feel a lot better btw
blaise: she just left the library
harry: because he wasn’t annoying me ok you know what ronald

“Ridiculous? How is it ridiculous? He’s trying to be better. To be a good person!” Harry yelled back to him.

draco: oh thanks i guess
sirius: stop smiling like an idiot at ur phone and listen to remus go over the rules
draco: pansy she’s not talking about THE hufflepuff is she?????
“What?” He asked. Did she know? Did she go through his texts with Dean and Seamus?
ron: what happened????
harry: good
harry: remus and sirius they’re-
ron: oh i just thought with all the howlers
draco: same here
neville: okay okay anyways back to me
pansy: you guys are the worst
pansy: YOU CRAWLED INTO CRABBE AND GOYLES’ TROUSERS
draco: has he even asked his mum
neville: so, what are we wearing
harry: i don’t wanna forget
hey guys, this is just a short little chapter to finish up the dates... hope you enjoy, another chapter should be up tomorrow or the next day
draco: it was more of a “i am going” then a “can i go”
harry: so that makes me think that sirius actually doesn’t want to try and understand.
draco: 12 right?
draco: not by choice!!!! my dad said he would beat me if i didn’t
remus: yeah we have pretty groovy dance moves
sry this ones kinda short
draco: okay thanks guys well i guess goodnight

neville: plant boy happens to have an actual name
neville: adorable
harry: wdym
harry: malfoy
harry: u mean sneak out of the dorms to see each other?
draco: i already did sleeping beauty
ginny: neville don’t ignore me
remus: i don’t believe him
pansy: well if it isn’t the famous harry potter that we’ve heard so much about
hermione: you guys are insufferable
sirius: idk moons
pansy: although that would be pretty funny
remus: maybe he’s dating someone and not telling us
pansy: we most certainly can in fact make you do that
pansy: don’t u mean when
"Stupid." He mumbled with a smile. Everything was going to be okay after all.
blaise: cause i'm me and you're u
harry: and i may or may not have said “yeah whatever” to that
dean: we trust his judgement he wouldn’t date you if u were still a bad person
harry: i’m gOING INSANE
“I think they’re for real this time.” Draco spoke up from the couch he was sitting at. Blaise nodded quietly.
pansy: just turn off ur notifications
pansy: draco u really took the wheel there
harry: did ur parents say anything yet?
ron: i’ll say
“Look at me.” Draco took Harry’s face in his hands and tilted his head up. “It’s over. We both said things that we didn’t mean, but we know now that Nott is just a jealous dick. Okay? I love you. So so much.” He sent Harry a soft that was shortly returned. Harry nodded his head and leaned back into Draco.
draco: please
draco: well um were u gonna say anything before that happened
draco: that’s not important rn
"I know why you're hesitant." He stopped and looked up to Sirius. "I get it. My father, he, he did awful things. So did I, but I never wanted to hurt anyone. I don't even think I knew that what he was doing was bad until fourth or fifth year really. I mean, he's my dad. I looked up to him. That's what you're suppose to do. Sixth year was probably the worst." At this point Harry was holding Draco's hand. "Voldemort said he would kill my mother. I couldn't let that happen, so I did what he said. After that, it's kind of all a blur. Everything happened so quickly. My father was furious this summer. He would go on and on about how Voldemort could've won. When I told him that I would be going back to Hogwarts whether he liked it or not, he wasn't too happy. I just want to start over. Move on, but he's too stuck up in what could've happened to realize that moving on is probably for the best. I'm trying to make it better. I really am." Draco finished. Sirius cleared his throat.
draco: yeah see you
harry: it’s not that late it’s only 11
harry: it’s lunch
hermione: mhm
neville: ginny
connor: anytime
draco: or like rush u into things
harry: good
dean: when u left the table during free period
harry: hell yes
blaise: oh
(See the end of the chapter for
seamus: dean
draco: also i will most certainly be wearing green
hermione: are u happy harry
seamus: why not it’s cool
draco: okay yeah i was being stupid, we’re already arguing about what we’re gonna wear
hermione: ...
“Really?” He asked.
dean: dunno but we’ll figure it out eventually
neville: mhm love ya
pansy: are u an idiot, or are u an idiot?
draco: no absolutely not
draco: potter what are you doing
harry: shut up ron u tried to ask fleur
dean: mhm
neville: no
draco: hey
draco: mum’s an angel though
dean: you’re out of luck ron
draco: p e e r   p r e s s u r e
harry: i like guys more how many times do i have to say that ron
blaise: ‘blaise you won’t believe what potter did today’
blaise: so
draco: well yeah but he doesn’t want the whole school knowing
draco: i walk out of the fucking common room, AND EVERY SINGLE WALL IS COVERED IN THE DAILY PROPHET AKA US MAKING TF OUT
blaise: ur lying but it’s fine, let us know when ur ready
pansy: draco it’s late
pansy: soooooooooo blaise
dean: ur being ridiculous
dean: well spit it out
“Please stop crying.” Dean said as he held Seamus close to him. Seamus tried to pull away, but Dean help him even closer. “Stop.”
“I gotta be honest with you Potter.” He started, and Harry looked up to him with tears in his eyes. “I’m not too good at feelings. I never really talked to anyone about them growing up.” Draco gave Harry a pathetic smile.
harry: oh cool
hermione: who’d u just sneak off with
“Fuck you.” He said. “Listen I get why you don’t like me. I’m like a tiny little ball of anger just waiting to explode. You’re better off with Hannah anyways. At least she’s not annoying, and-“ Seamus was cut off by Dean’s lips. Dean’s lips pressed against his. Dean didn’t know why he did it. Maybe it was because he didn’t know what else to do. Maybe it was because he wanted Seamus to stop saying whatever bullshit he was saying. Maybe it was cause he actually did like him back and he didn’t know how else to convince Seamus that he did.
neville: who? who did you kill?
harry: mmm
draco: okay just making sure
ron: *gags*
blaise: WHY ARE U GUYS FREAKING OUT
harry: k see you at 12
“Hey.” Draco said as he pulled Harry into a hug.
“You sure you’re okay?” Harry said softly, as he and Draco were finishing up unpacking their belongings. Draco glanced up at him.
blaise: well he never said that
pansy: same difference
blaise: it attacked me
draco: apparently
“Definitely.” Pansy pulled a bottle of vodka out of the boots that she was wearing.
blaise: yeah
ron: yeah
ron: u too can suck my dick
harry: night
harry: yay
ron: the potter jar?
harry: maybe
harry: goodnight dray

draco: alright u absolute nimwits, i don’t know if you’ve noticed but we’re in class rn, and professor sprout already doesn’t really like me. my phone going off dozens of times isn’t helping my case.

draco: and i said no
remus: it’s his brother harry it’s different
harry: outside of their office talking to the portraits
pansy: what’d he say
harry: um hello what do i do

“In my defense, Pansy dared me to. I couldn’t just not do it.”
draco: no don’t leave me i’m bored
harry: ginny come on
draco: harry, i love u, but we can figure this out later
seamus: what about dean and i?

chat*
“No, uh, they had just been handed out, but I figured I’d take my chances.” Blaise shrugged it off, but Neville grab him into a bone crushing hug.
ginny: an arsehole
“I have not.” Draco scoffed as he looked back down at his Defense Against The Dark Arts textbook. For whatever reason, Draco decided that he should actually try in that class.
blaise: no no no, it’s not because i don’t want to or anything, it’s just safer that way, especially for you
pansy: we know hun just breathe we’re gonna figure this out
blaise: ever, and for a while it’s all you think about
neville: i'm done talking to u ginny, u either support it or u don't
neville: ginny
pansy: i’ll meet u outside ur common room in 20
harry: good thing i’m here to remind you that you’re not
ginny: oh
pansy: yeah, but it’s fine i’m sure we’ll have a blast
blaise: shut up i panicked
blaise: well um good luck with that
harry: ur good
blaise: damn, i think i would hold the record for shortest relationship ever
pansy: mhm k
sirius: anyways guess what
“Shhhh. Just breath babe. I got you. You’re okay.” Harry whispered into Draco’s ear.  Draco’s grip on Harry’s shirt loosened a bit as his breathing slowed. He looked up to Harry, teary eyed.
harry: PRAISE RONALD BILLIUS WEASLEY
blaise: my parents won’t even be the worst of it though
blaise: green thumb man?
neville: no
neville: i should probaby tell ginny and luna though, i don't think it's good to keep lying to them, especially when it's official
harry: can i share a room with draco ;)
sirius: well you’ve never seen them so u cant deny that statement
draco: just stay tf away from my relationship
connor: am not
harry: *screenshot if sirius’ text* scary
ron: did u even ask draco yet
neville: ditto on that
hermione: how rich? like a whole jar?
luna: ginny i think he's about to tell us that
draco: it’s okay harry really i’ll see you at the tower okay?
ginny: guy?
“You are too acting weird.” Ron said through a mouthful of chocolate frog.
dean: i cant believe u guys don’t know what star wars is
seamus: fine
sirius: he’s fine love he would tell us if something was really hurting him
harry: yeah i know i should’ve asked but you were sleeping and i didn’t want to wake you up but it felt wrong lying to them so i just did it
harry: oh okay
harry: so remus
seamus: ok rude
neville: yeah, love you
neville: i know you’re probably not hungry, but harry was saying something about bringing you guys lunch. i can bring u something if u want. they’ve got the mashed potatoes that u like.
blaise: hey nev?
neville: i took offense to that
blaise: word
“I-“ She started, but before she could finish owls came swooping in to the Great Hall. The pleasant atmosphere started to fade quickly.
pansy: HEY BITCHES
pansy: thought u said it was going to surprise us
neville: anytime
blaise: fuck off
neville: sorry i’m probably bothering you, i’ll let you be now
blaise: family
draco: it is not
seamus: very well
draco: he blocked me
hermione: alright alright but just this one time
ron: let it be known that the only reason i offered is because i know that harry will be on his phone texting malfoy all christmas if he’s not with him
blaise: JEOAJDOWENKAKSNEM
neville: i don’t mind, i love u that’s all that matters
neville: it’s nothing i swear
harry: yeah
sirius: yes yes that
draco: i’m gonna kill u guys later just a warning
harry: all. fucking. day. neville.
draco: what
draco: damn okay
harry: okay???
hermione: sorry this one made me laugh a bit
pansy: you guys are so weird
“How am I wrong?” Neville asked. “I’m the plant master-“ Blaise raised his eyebrows at that. “-Your words not mine.” Neville said in his defense.
harry: dunno just checking
ron: expelled
“Okay.” Harry kissed him once more.
ron: that was so incredibly awkward and i never want to be put in that position again
harry: draco says it’s fake but i dunno
draco: u snogged cho
neville: hilarious
blaise: cool
ron: do ya think remus and sirius know
pansy: i said 8TH YEAR BITCHES
ginny: :)
draco: i’m not a death eater
draco: i cant believe people are actually buying that you know who reincarnated shit
blaise: where ya going pans?
draco: library, harry thinks i cheated on him
blaise: nev hun, i didn’t tell them about you
harry: i lied
“Yeah.” He answered, but then shook his head. “Well, mum’s not. She just...” He stopped as he searched his head for the right word.
neville: that’s awful
pansy: LMAOSJOSKOANS
pansy: don’t we have a ball to get ready for?
neville: it is decidedly uncool
ron: what’s photoshop?
ginny: YES NEVILLE GET TO THE POINT
“Oh he’ll be occupied alright.” Hermione kicked his foot under the table. “Blimey Hermione!” He exclaimed. The others gave them odd looks, but mostly ignored it.
“Are too.”
-also i just started rereading the series and i don’t remember that much about blaise so sorry if his character is off
pansy: no i mean i don’t have one either so we can go together as friends
pansy: right.....
seamus: i mean not much
harry: “just because i’m ur teacher doesn’t mean that u and friends get special treatment” -remus lupin
harry: me too
ginny: that’s it? like you guys just forgive me?
dean: we’re literally taking a test rn wtf
draco: yeah?
harry: i may have brought his brother into it
ginny: i’m sorry
theo: oh yes potter right? well it seems like u finally got what u always wanted
dean: dude what’s taking you so long
neville: u gave me heart attack
ron: aw shit here we go
harry: to be fair we both dating each other to try and deny the fact that we were gay
“To be fair, I told him to leave you alone.” Remus spoke up.
blaise: mmm maybe this relationship isn’t so bad after all
“Ya sure about that mate?” Ron asked him with a sly smile on his face.
hermione: you made a good point and didn’t let them win when they were in the wrong so yes i do
harry: heyyyy remus
blaise: good
blaise: hey nev
draco: oh
neville: k
harry: ILL LOVE U FOREVER
“I’m gonna go help Neville with Transfiguration. Wanna come?” Blaise asked her as he gathered his stuff.
blaise: maybe
hermione: what’d u do now?
dean: yeah he’ll think that u hate him
neville: i mean i’d normally ask ginny about these things but she won’t help me with this
harry: you know? i really don’t feel like talking to you guys right now
draco: very smooth blaise
"Well, you want me to understand, so explain." Sirius answered. Harry sighed.
hermione: just give them time they’ll come around
connor: jesus christ just get ur ass in here
ginny: that moment when classes start today and you still haven’t finished ur summer work
harry: you were scared
draco: NO I DIDNT
neville: i need help
(See the end of the chapter for
seamus: ha ha so funny
harry: sirius is being really quiet. it’s makes me think that you’re doing that thing where you speak for the both of you because you think whatever sirius is gonna say is gonna hurt my feelings.
“Hey, Pans?”
harry: jesus christ they’re having another???
ron: yeah yeah whatever
neville: mhm ur pushing it
ron: harry just snuck out
harry: i know ur gonna ask why, so don’t u idiot

draco: oh well then i guess sure... pans? blaise?
seamus: actually scratch that we’ve shared a DORM with eachother since we were 11 harold
draco: IM GOING TO KILL U OMG
“Everything alright, love?” Harry nodded his head towards two figures that were making their way towards them. When Draco realized who the two figures were, he laughed, said he was going to talk to Blaise, and walked away. What a bitch.
ron: we’re just saying dude, maybe just tell them. they’re not gonna disown you
“Really! It’s um used in, like, love potions and-
draco: i cant possibly fit two weeks of clothes in here, including my dress suits for dinner, it’s not possible
harry: just try not to cover him in glitter again k?
“Sorry what would you prefer? Sweetcheeks? Maybe Babycakes?” He teased.
blaise: you like what u see plant boy?
ron: what’s up
ginny: i’ll be right back
blaise: yeah i do
draco: use protection
-almost everyone’s gay
ron: answer me
pansy: yes you do you went to the bathroom and when you came back you looked like a tomato
harry: i-
draco: what’d mcgonagall say?
neville: yeah...
harry: in ron’s defense, he was 18 turning 19 and you were 14
hermione: maybe just don’t wear the baby bonnet this time k?
draco: sounds good harry
harry: ur the worst
harry: can u guys stop being gay for a second
sirius: fuck
harry: but he’s a malfoy
dean: or hufflepuff
draco: alright shut up we have to head down to breakfast or else we’ll be late
blaise: sorry
pansy: STFU
hermione: tell me about it
ron: wtf i literally thought that we collectively agreed that we hated each other first year
harry: i know
draco: mhm
"Uh, I'm good. How are you?" Draco answered nervously.
dean: it couldn’t have been ravenclaw
harry: okay cool
harry: yay :)
dean: okay?
pansy: alright well see you at the train bitches
harry: uh the ball u idiot
neville: alrighty well i’ll see you guys at the train :)
sirius: awwww he gets his stubbornness and eye rolling from you moons
harry: what is it???
draco: SHUT UP RN
seamus: ok
“You can’t tell anyone though!” Harry spat out quickly.
blaise: this is an emergency
neville: ginny this is exactly why i didn't tell you
theo: sure, but u were.... i think that says enough about u
“What, uh, what do you mean?” He stuttered out. Luna looked up from her addition of the Quibbler.
draco: pansy if this is ur mid life crisis then it looks like ur only living till 36 my dear
harry: that’s homophobic ron
hermione: funny we’ve been done for half an hour
sirius: i mean yeah
“No, you go ahead. I’m good.”
neville: dork
dean: ^^^
dean: in the restricted section??
draco: seems like a stupid thing to be mad over after everything that’s happened
(See the end of the chapter for
blaise: how is it that you always know that i like someone before i know myself
draco: potter
harry: BUT HES CUTE WHEN HE DOES IT
harry: it’s not okay though i shouldn’t have asked
draco: nope as in i’m not telling you who it is
blaise: odd

remus: who were u texting today in class
blaise: do u wanna go with me? i mean it’s totally fine if u were planning on just going with friends or something else but
harry: awwwww you think that my face is cute thanks baby
pansy: you really didn’t have to make it such a big deal
draco: PANSY
draco: how do you know?
pansy: ok...
harry: don’t change the topic
blaise: for christmas
draco: i told pansy and blaise if that’s okay
“Alright. See ya.”
blaise: it’s a date
draco: HOW DID U EVEN YOU GET THAT
harry: ok, what’s wrong then?
“Woah mate. We won’t.” Ron laughed out. Harry smiled. That went a lot better than he though that it was going to.
"You can, uh, you can call me Draco"
seamus: LMAO PLEASE HARRY
harry: no no it’s fine i think we’re sorting it out tonight
draco: will do babe
harry: shut up ron
dean: in the compartment with ginny, neville, and luna
"Hi." Blaise said softly.
harry: too lazy to come out of my room, ANYWAYS
ron: and you noticed that why?
pansy: i think i kinda might like someone
ginny: and for not being there for you
harry: sorry babe
connor: yay okay
hermione: omg
harry: ok yeah
pansy: we’re not that bad
pansy: i’m bored
harry: plssssssssssss
“Mr. Potter?” McGonagall said as everyone was leaving the class. “Stay here for a few minutes. I want to talk to you.” He nodded his head and looked back to his friends who were all giving him questioning looks.
harry: ugh why not
hermione: i guess that’s what i signed up for as well
blaise: so?
dean: yeah it might be a bit squished though
ron: k cool i approve i guess
"Oh, uh, yeah. Ginny and I aren't really on speaking terms right now so..." He trailed off.
(See the end of the chapter for
pansy: ur taking neville right?
ginny: oh well then just be boyfriendy there ig
ron: i guess they’re not the worst people to be around
harry: ❤️❤️❤️
sirius: cool can u have lunch with us today around 1
harry: we’re not gonna break up. does that make you feel better?
ron: can we go to bed and stop talking about how harry is shagging our worst enemy
hehe cliffhanger
ginny: the fucking snakes duh
“Well maybe it’s better that you don’t, sweetie.” Dean laughed as he pulled her hand away from where she was about to grab the broken glass shards. “I should probably go find him right?” Pansy turned to him and nodded.
harry: i meant more for dean and ron to get to know blaise and draco also you guys do know that my actual name is harry right?
neville: yeah i saw that at breakfast... shouldn’t draco be trying to get on professor lupin’s good side???
blaise: byeeeee
pansy: that’s dark
hermione: harry stop being a dramatic arse i’m sure it’s something stupid
ginny: hiding what are you hiding
ginny: wtf neville
draco: no i meant if
blaise: yeah u should talk to them about what it is that they want
blaise: no he totally has a crush on pansy
dean: good
hermione: cool so couples besides pansy?
connor: fine she ditched me cause she wanted to go hang with her friends
neville: oh god no, never say that again
harry: first, we’re not shagging jesus and second, pretty sure old voldy was our worst enemy but go off
pansy: it’s gonna be fun right?
ginny: yes you do
harry: yeah well i wasn’t exactly planning on snogging a death eater so
luna: it's blaise isn't it
blaise: ...
connor: i would pansy really, but someone’s already asked me and i said yes
draco: i know, it’s okay i’m just tired and don’t wanna think about that before bed
“Your child is eighteen. You cant control him anymore.” Sirius growled right back. Before they knew it, they had apparated back to the Burrow. Leaving a fuming Lucius Malfoy behind them.
pansy: yeah definitely
remus: u couldn’t have at least gotten a stupify in there? i thought i taught u better
seamus: saw that one coming
“Are too.”
ron: okay i was obviously joking
pansy: uR cUtE tOo
“Guys, look at what Harry just sent me.” Draco held his phone in front of Pansy and Blaise’s faces. Pansy giggled a bit, and Blaise cupped his hands around his mouth.
remus: he says he didn’t do it?
harry: i could kill you in your sleep
ron: what???? i’m just saying
pansy: oh shit
luna: thanks pansy! i like the flowers ur named after
neville: omg blaise
neville: my boyfriend is blaise zabini
harry: brb
harry: can u please not fail me
ron: and what is that mate
neville: they most certainly do
pansy: GUYS
draco: i find it quite funny
pansy: there’s no way his parents know about this
harry: leave him alone ron
um if u cant already tell i don’t really fancy ginny. don’t kill me. don’t kill me. she’s gonna get better i swear. i just, needed to make her a bitch for a few chapter. to, ya know, release my hatred. she’ll get better. okay? okay.
hermione: i tried to tell them that
blaise: welp
ginny: gotta agree with neville on this one
seamus: yeah my dates not even with us but u and draco with ur damn dramatics
harry: remus and sirius asked me who i was texting today during class
pansy: like ik a bunch of you guys are dating and shit but like this is gonna make it official official
pansy: understandable
hermione: what now?
“So you’re a fairy now?” Lucius’ eyes lingered over their interlocked hands. Draco’s first response was to cower. He hadn’t heard his father’s voice in person since the summer holidays. He’d forgotten just how intimidating he was, but within not even a second he straightened up. He wasn’t going to let this man scare him anymore.
pansy: ‘pansy why does potter have to be so good at everything?’
“Dunno. Some muggle alcohol.”
Draco did. Merlin, Draco always understood, and even the few times that he didn’t he tried his best to. He couldn’t lose that.
harry: pretty sure you said that it was good one
blaise: where are you
draco: forgive me for not thinking that everyone thinking that i was a death eater is going to be fun
neville: she’s not mad anymore! right gin?
draco: your face isn't stupid it’s cute
harry: ignore him
harry: “what he did was unforgivable.” “would you give your brother a second chance?” yeah it was a pretty low blow
theo: potter
hey guys !! this is just a quick little chapter, it was gonna be longer, but i like how the ending felt. the next chapter should be up within the next few days :) enjoy !!
dean: right, phones away
blaise: why tf was it out of NOWHERE
draco: i’m tearing your family apart
neville: yeah she’s just being dumb
pansy: i will
pansy: probably because, for reasons i don’t know, he thinks you’re cute
sirius: ur right
draco: well no i just idk
seamus: sup
-homophobes this is not the place for you :)
harry: i cant- it’s too painful
pansy: i could’ve told you that you liked him the minute he rejected your handshake first year dummy
pansy: HAHAHSIWEIQOJDMWW
hermione: will you guys ever drop that
draco: sorry sexy, is that better?
pansy: oh fuck me for choosing to take astronomy with you granger
ron: you wound me
harry: shit i gotta go

sirius: jesus fuck ur just like remus when we were younger
harry: okay
ginny: what?
seamus: yeah don’t disrespect their beautiful platonic love neville
harry: are you just noticing that now???
“What? How- how did you know that?” Harry stuttered out in surprise.
harry: do u want me to bring u anything?
seamus: then u used a spell???
harry: oh
seamus: oooOoOOOOooooo
neville: *screenshot*
“Thanks.” Harry copied down the answer, and changed the wording on a few of them. He finished just in time.
“No. No that was bad.” Blaise assured him as he took several deep breaths, attempting to steady his shaky voice.
harry: yup sorry
“Yeah okay.” Harry agreed. “You can head back. I just need to pack up all of the stuff.”
ginny: woah woah woah, luna and i aren’t dating
harry: oh nice of you to join the conversation
draco: i’m outta here.
draco: how’s class
“We’ve got Tranfiguration together right?” Draco asked Harry. Harry looked down at his schedule.
seamus: where are you?
dean: neville said that i should talk to you
harry: PLS it was a literal .5 second decision
draco: i still should’ve done something
(See the end of the chapter for
pansy: what’s wrong hun
“Bye.” Draco said as he turned to leave the astronomy tower. That was the first time that he truly felt happy in a while.
ginny: judgemental
“It was obvious Mr. Potter. Does your Godfather and Mr. Lupin know?” Harry nodded his head slowly.
hermione: well it’s four to a compartment and there is 12 of us now counting luna and connor
pansy: THEN TEXT HIM U IDIOT
neville: fine what do u need help with
harry: she knows about me and draco
“That’s okay. I’m not either.” Harry laughed out. “Could I maybe talk to you about something though?” Harry asked hesitantly. Draco nodded for him to continue.
draco: i have the answers...
draco: yeah uh sorry about that
draco: yeah yeah whatever, what’d ron and hermione say
hermione: too many
remus: i know i’m the worst

“Hey.” Harry answered. “So about those answers...”
hermione: i swear to merlin
blaise: uh not so fast won won
“Okay. See ya.” Harry said.
blaise: did they kill you?
draco: what were we thinking?????
neville: no? okay that’s okay.
harry: mhm
neville: i think we wait and see if they show up for breakfast. if they don’t, then we can think about reaching out more. alright?
harry: 100 percent, i’m all in
harry: nothing it’s just odd, he keeps asking me if it’s hard to date u cause ur a slytherin and i’m a gryffindor and shit like that

harry: i don’t wanna go to lunch
seamus: yup
“Shit, why?” Ginny hit Pansy’s arm.
draco: shut the hell up
draco: i’ll see you tonight harry
(See the end of the chapter for
harry: “lemme know if you guys are doing any pranks i’ll help you”
seamus: something’s up
blaise: pansy?
harry: *kills neville*
harry: i’m coming downstairs now
“Alright, alright. I’m going next.” Pansy spoke up. She, unlike Blaise, didn’t hesitate to tear her family’s beloved seal from the envelope, unleashing the voice of her own mother this time.
blaise: start?
ron: really? are u two a thing?
draco: night
ginny: ok well i’ll see you guys in about an hour
harry: bummer
harry: see you at 11:30?
blaise: uh everything if i don’t wanna fail newts
“Fine.”
draco: do you ever wonder why i took care of luna when she was trapped in the dungeons at malfoy manner?
neville: we’re just kidding
draco: you’ll be fine babe
harry: he wants me to wear grey and he wants to wear green... pray for me
harry: u can borrow my sweaters too :)
“We dated. In fifth year.” Draco said. Harry turned to him.
harry: i’m sorry i didn’t know
draco: yeah i mean we’re all of age
pansy: WELL OBVIOUSLY NOT
seamus: calm yourself
harry: i warned you
“It’s nice to see you too Lucius.” He glanced around the room before returning his gaze to him. “Now, I think it would be in everyone’s favor to not cause a scene. Don’t you?” When there was nothing but a sneer given to him in response, he continued. “So, I’ll tell you what’s going to happen. You are going to let us apparate out of here, without any fuss. Then, you are going to go back to your home, and continue whatever kind of odd, cousin fucking, traditions you do over the holidays.” He finished with the same warm smile on his face. Sirius tried, he really did, but he couldn’t help but huff a laugh right into Lucius’ face.
ginny: and for being a shitty friend
draco: what?
pansy: are too
harry: draco
blaise: of course they do
hermione: sorry krum already asked me

harry: RON MY LOVE
harry: you’re actually being the exact opposite of reasonable
ron: shit man go off
neville: i’m sitting across the room from you why are you texting me
“Well if it isn’t the dirty traitor.” Lucius eyed Sirius up and down. Remus had previously come up to Harry and rested a hand onto his shoulder. Lucius’ eyes traveled to him now. “And his half-breed pity project.” Sirius let out a noise that sounded somewhat like a growl, but Remus just smiled warmly at Lucius.
harry: more than we could even explain
ok i lied.... next is the yule ball....
hermione: there he is. back at it again.
neville: no i get it, make fun of the plant boy and then ask him for help in plant class

“No. No, you’re wrong.” Blaise claimed.
seamus: we all are
draco: harry come on please
blaise: snakes are cooler
remus: but he still failed the test
ok three chapters today wow. i was in a creative mood :) gn ttyl
pansy: bold of you to assume that i want to live
pansy: okay why are you being so weird about it
“You scared me.” He said with a slight smile on his face. Blaise’s hand found the back of his neck.
blaise: have fun tell us all the details later
neville: oh

draco: goodnight see u at breakfast
harry: that’s the same sweater you were wearing to hogsmead last weekend
draco: ur the absolute best harry potter
“Weather’s nice today.” Sirius said, and Remus kicked his leg under the table. It was raining today. Harry looked up to him and put his sandwich down with a sigh.
draco: mhm very important
draco: babe
harry: no no no no no please no
blaise: yay
blaise: planty plant?
draco: PANSY SHUT UP OML
draco: wait no i was joking pls don’t say anything embarrassing

neville: family?
ron: cool
hermione: harry you should just tell them the truth, but if u really are that worried just say that u were ginny or someone
“Ron, honestly, chew with your mouth closed.” Hermione rolled her eyes.
pansy: .......
pansy: ha see what i did there
sirius: harold jameus potterus
pansy: besides the obvious *cough, cough* everyone who’s already dating
draco: yes darling?
remus: i wouldn’t doubt it
pansy: who are y’all taking to the ball???
"Well, you know how Luna gets with this stuff. Once she starts talking about it she won't stop."
harry: I MEANT DARN
harry: no i was doing it cause i thought that he was a death eater
pansy: he’s a hufflepuff
(See the end of the chapter for
pansy: draco
blaise: ^^^
draco: i mean i really like you too
pansy: well maybe hermione but she wouldn’t say anything
“It hurts cause I think I’m in love with him Pans.”
Seamus listened as Pansy and Luna talked about whatever it was they were taking about. Okay, he wasn’t really listening. In fact, he was staring at Dean and Hannah. On the dance floor. Laughing. Having fun. Gross.
harry: draco
harry: cool cool
neville: yeah um i haven't finished
draco: i mean weren’t him and luna a thing for a bit?? i’m sure ginny has told her
ginny: no thanks, and how would you know that? it’s not like you talk to them
dean: that’s surprising
pansy: so draco
ginny: ew you stayed in that thing
harry: he said what draco did was unforgivable, so i asked him if he would forgive his brother
draco: yeah but obviously i’m a lot more tolerable without sleep than you are
“Am not.”
pansy: good
“I know, I know. I’m just saying.”
blaise: yeah you never shut up about him

pansy: anyone else just like hate this class
pansy: did harry forgive u?
ginny: i think i’m gonna ask luna to the ball
remus: night love
harry: i know i feel awful now, but i had a point
harry: k
harry: dunno, they won’t answer me
pansy: night losers
neville: were they mad when u told them about me?
ron: hell yeah
blaise: the unicorn, i shouldn’t have gone wondering in the forest in the first place but still
draco: no seriously thank you
harry: ???
“Don’t say that! You could’ve been killed you blithering idiot!” He practically yelled, but it was muffled by Blaise’s shirt. Blaise stood their with wide eyes. Eventually, he came to his senses and hugged Neville back.
hermione: that’s not a word ron
ron: mhm
harry: HERMIONE PLEASE TELL ME THERES ONE OF HIM AND BLAISE IN THERE
harry: dracooooooooooo
harry: hey
pansy: thats what i thought
draco: ok now that’s just mean
harry: i think they were, well, surprised. remus seemed to be okay with it, sirius is um ‘processing’
ron: wait wait wait new topic
ron: that sounded oddly suggestive
seamus: yay! what do you want???
neville: i absolutely despise u
“Seamus.” Pansy said a bit louder this time. Worry filled her expression. Seamus laughed drunkenly.
pansy: what
“Harry, Blaise is saying Draco’s saying the picture is fake. Maybe just try talking to him about it?” Neville suggested softly.
dean: finally?????
draco: paterson???
draco: are u awake?
draco: said what first
draco: harry?
ginny: i’ll come too
hermione: there isn’t
ginny: wait she's right
ginny: yeah harry you were too busy admiring cho from afar
harry: NEVILLE
as much as a i love pansy/hermione, i’m sorry but i have to keep romione cause i love them
blaise: right
“Alright. Let’s get this bullshit over with then. Who’s first?” He looked over to Draco and Pansy who were both still staring at their envelopes. He took a deep breath and sighed.
dean: sureeeeee
pansy: dude is it that hard to believe that someone would like you
harry: aw shit here we go
harry: idk i’ll probably give him some shit about it just to be difficult but i’ll do whatever makes him happy
blaise: baby u have every right to want revenge, but trust me, once you do something like that, it never leaves ur head
pansy: I NEED THE DADA HOMEWORK ASAP
blaise: that’s bold coming from a damn lion
draco: love you too bud
blaise: idk
draco: yeah
neville: i’m sure dean would love that
harry: and draco’s my boyfriend, mind you i don’t know exactly what regulus did, but i’m sure it’s not too far off from draco’s situation
remus: bitch
blaise: did ur gran say that it’s okay for you to go?
draco: fine jesus christ
draco: i don’t look like a tomato
blaise: yeah
“Well then.” She looked over to Draco, as she barely kept herself together. He looked queasy. Rightfully so. Everyone knew that his was going to be the worst. “Your turn.” She smiled lightly at him and put her hand on top of his.
dean: a pumpkin juice and chocolate frog please
“I think that that is quite unnecessary, Lucius.” And before Draco knew it, Sirius Black was standing in between him and his father.
seamus: sorry for like totally ditching u last night
hermione: no but draco can
draco: mmm i don’t doubt that u would love
draco: i’m not being weird about it drop it pansy

ron: *throws up*
harry: sure like green’s any better
draco: OMG

draco: 100 percent, i’m all in too

blaise: oh well no, but it was still very traumatizing and i still felt really really bad

draco: bloody hell calm yourself i don’t have and invisiblity cloak so i had to actually think practically
“I was always gay, Father.” He scoffed out. “You were just too busy fantasizing about your nice and pure bloodline to notice.” Lucius was certainly taken aback by Draco’s response. He was fuming, and he went to grab his wand, but another voice cut in before he could.
neville: LUNA
ron: oh fuck off
ron: chile anyways so
harry: that’s hilarious
ron: oh you guys are still coming?
luna: i can send u pictures of my outfit when i get it so that we can maybe match

“...was influenced by the wrong people?” Harry supplied.

“Yes really you dork.” Blaise laughed out. “I mean, I’m pretty good with what we’re learning now. Ya know? The, um,  Hurdymoot, or whatever.” Neville snorted. Blaise look at him. “What?” Neville rolled his eyes.
seamus: alright girls we’re ready
harry: you do?

“Not too well at first, but he came around eventually.” Harry answered and McGonagall nodded her head.
blaise: LMAO SEAMUS DITCHED YOU
harry: thank you, okay so basically the teachers seem to think that another yule ball will cheer everyone up so that’s what happening
blaise: draco used to send his mother letters about how much he hated harry potter’s stupid hair and his stupid green eyes and his stupid glasses and his stupid face
