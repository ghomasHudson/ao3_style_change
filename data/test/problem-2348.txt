"What happened last night?"
"You don't know how long I've wanted to do that," Harry breathed.  A breathy laugh escaped Draco.
“No,” said Harry very quietly.
“So we’re not supposed to be prepared for what’s waiting out there?”
“That sounds good.”  He smiled brightly and warmth filled me.
“I know, I wish it wasn’t either, but I love you anyways,” He mumbled.  I hummed and kissed him again.  We broke away and moved to sit in our usual spot by the water.
One Friday night when they decided to stay in, while taking the rubbish out, Harry found a small black kitten with white paws next to the bin.
“I bet our dads heard about this,” Crabbe whispered.  Goyle nodded.
“I bet he’s got detention for at least a month!”  I squeezed her hand tightly.  We all began walking towards the hut at the edge of grounds for class.
“I’m glad you have faith in me to follow that,”  He laughed.  We stood near the edge for a moment, both of us smiling.
“Be smart.”  I brushed my hand across his cheek.  He raised one of his eyebrows but smiled softly.  “Will we be able to meet tomorrow before the tournament?”
"I remember that much.  What about at the club?"
I got a sinking feeling but chalked it up to a lack of sleep.  Pansy kept a careful eye on me once she woke up enough to notice.  The boys didn’t notice however, and kept their conversation going with mouthfuls of food.
“Which means she’s working against us!”  I placed my hands more solidly on his shoulders.
"Right,"  Harry mumbled, turning back to his own book.
I woke up the next morning feeling more rested than I had in months.  I smiled as I let my thoughts wander to Harry, something I hadn’t been able to do in months.  A wave of relief washed over me before I remembered — it’s Monday.  First Monday of the year even.
"Draco, what is it?"  Pansy asked, looking up from her phone.  It was Friday, they had only gotten there the day before, and she already had six girl's phone numbers.  He didn't even hear her and continued gaping at the stage.  "What?"  She followed his gaze.  "Is that..."
"Well tonight, it's alcohol first. A round of tequila please!" The boys all groaned but smiled regardless. Harry glanced sideways to Draco, relieved to see him smiling along with his friends. He was initially worried that Draco being, well, Draco, could cause a rift, but he seemed to be behaving well. The boys even seemed to like Draco. He fit in like a missing puzzle piece they didn't know existed.
“Draco,” He whispered.  Harry’s eyes searched Draco’s flushed face before quickly pulling his hand out from Draco’s shirt.
“Potter?”
“Yes, and sometimes I truly wonder why.”
“As I said in my last letter, we have some very
“Well, Mr Thomas?”
“I’m proud to represent Slytherin House as a Prefect this year. Besides that, I’m not excited to be returning to that joke of a school.” Voldemort smiled slowly.
A tall, thin, pale man slipped quietly into the room. His black robes billowed around him like a dementor. A long, thick dark green snake slithered at his feet. I brought myself slowly to meet his stare. Piercing scarlet eyes stared back into mine — death. It took all my will to continue standing and staring back. I pushed the fear down and held up my chin. To survive, I had to play the game. My father was proud to serve the Dark Lord, and he expected me to be as well. Voldemort glided across the room to me, an evil but curious grin growing as he approached me.
However, our carefree time was cut short by the returning of students and we returned to our natural state — public avoidance and stealing away every chance we could, much to the despair of Hermione.  She thought we should spend more time studying but I could see her smile at the way Harry’s face lit up when he’d leave the library.
“Detention tonight?”
“I hope so but who knows.  Shit seems to like happening to me,” Harry chuckled.  I shook my head.
Love seems like a curse, you made that true,
The night was long and the morning even longer as Blaise continued with his unnecessary bitching around our room.  Finally, I left and walked to breakfast.  My hands felt heavy and my stomach had sunk to my feet.  I took a bit of food but ended up staring at it more than I did eating it.
The new professor began the lesson — bowtruckles — but I tuned most of it out.  A few minutes into the lesson, she instructed us to gather around the table to sketch and label bowtruckles.  I squeezed in as close to Harry as I could manage without being too obvious.
“I know I haven’t seemed the best lately but I swear, it’s just because of the tournament,” He reassured me again as he had been for the past few weeks.  It almost sounded rehearsed at this point, or like he was trying to convince himself of it.  It didn’t relieve me much, but I decided it was good enough for now.  Maybe after the tournament, I’d press more about it, but he could just be stressed about the final task.
‘Add powdered moonstone, stir three times counterclockwise, allow to simmer for seven minutes, then add two drops of syrup of hellebore,’” Harry’s voice trailed off as his face dropped.  Snape raised a brow.
“CEDRIC DIGGORY!”  The great hall erupted with cheers from the Hogwarts students.  I clapped. It wasn't like I knew him, just respectful. In the midst of celebration, Pansy nudged my arm and whispered: “Look!”
“The end of another year.  There is much that I would like to say to you all tonight, but I must first acknowledge the loss of a very fine person, who should be sitting here,” he gestured toward the Hufflepuff table, “enjoying our feast with us.  I would like you all, please, to stand, and raise your glasses, to Cedric Diggory.”  Around us, benches scraped the floor as students stood.  The Slytherins around me remained sitting.  I grabbed my goblet regardless, silently saluting Diggory.
“Will it be?” He asked softly, pulling away ever so slightly.  I looked into his eyes and saw something I never saw in them before — pure, unadulterated fear.  Unimaginable and deep, sinking far from the surface, nearly obscured in its depth.
“How can you be sure?”  I picked up my goblet.
"You want anything?" Harry leaned close to Draco's ear. It was getting harder to hear as the band on stage started their set. The sound of Harry's voice so close to him sent shivers down Draco's spine. "I'm paying."
“Well then, I’m afraid you are not qualified to decide what the ‘whole point’ of any class is.  Wizards much older and cleverer than you have devised our new program of study.  You will be learning about defensive spells in a secure, risk-free way —”
“Leave, Narcissa, Draco. I wish to speak to Lucius alone,” He hissed. My mother and I quickly stood, bowed, and left. As soon as we were out the door, we both let out a quiet breath.
. Harry rubbed his back and watched Draco carefully. "You alright?"
“What do you mean, father?”
“Shall we sit?”  I gestured my hand to the sandy lake edge.  We walked over and sat on the last bit of grass before the sand.  “So, tell me about you.”
But life changes just like that,
“Well, it’s like Harry said, isn’t it?  If we’re going to be attacked, it won’t be risk-free —”
"Alright, guys! Who's having a good Pride?"  Harry asked the crowd, almost panting from the energy he emitted during the first song.  He could see the crowd a bit better now that his eyes had adjusted to the bright lights.  He smiled as the crowd cheered in response.  He was able to make out some people in the front of the crowd — a lot of glitter, dyed hair, and rainbows.  "Yeah?  Well, I know we're having a great time, isn't that right Jasper?"
“Can’t say.  We want to keep it under wraps for a bit,”  I explained.  Blaise huffed, catching up to me.
"Shit,"  Draco muttered under his breath, bringing a hand to his forehead.
"Him. Harry Potter." Draco looked between a glaring Harry and bemused Jasper. "That's his name."
“Harry you’re wrong.”
A few minutes later, I wasn’t the only one staring — most of the class drew their attention from the book to Hermione’s defiance.  Umbridge finally looked at Hermione.
"Okay."  Draco walked back to the door and paused.  "I'm just next door if you want or need anything."
"You alright?"  Draco finally asked.
“Detention, Mr Potter!  Tomorrow evening.  Five o’clock.  My office.  I repeat, this is a lie.  The Ministry of Magic guarantees that you are not in danger from any Dark wizard.”  I suppressed a dark laugh.  “If you are still worried, by all means come and see me outside class hours.  If someone is alarming you with fibs about reborn Dark wizards, I would like to hear about it.  I am here to help.  I am your friend.  And now, you will kindly continue your reading.  Page five, ‘Basics for Beginners’.”  Professor Umbridge sat down behind her desk again. Harry quickly stood up.  Hermione tugged at his sleeve but he pushed her away.
"What was that?"  Harry smirked.  Draco groaned and turned to Harry.
“Earlier today, for example.  You fixed my glasses.  And you weren’t exactly sneaky with your staring this morning, or yesterday, or any of the other days this year or last.”  My face got hot.
“I should go now,” He whispered, pulling away slightly.  “Rest up before tomorrow, you know.”  He paused and chewed his cheek for a moment.  “I love you.”  I nodded, swallowed thickly and forced a smile.  He smiled again before leaving through the vines.
"I did mean to talk to you after the trial," Harry started, vaguely hearing Jasper order more shots, eliciting more groans. "But you left so quickly and then I ended up running away regardless—"
“Dray, I’ve told you, I’ve done the best that I can in preparation.  I don’t know what the task is.  I’ve done the best I can, so has Hermione and Ron.”  He squeezed my hand gently and smiled.
He tried to shift without waking Draco but realised his arm was wedged underneath him.
“I need good grades too.”
“I…”  I looked around as if the words would just appear in front of me.
They breathed out simultaneously before Draco slowly pulled away.  The moment their lips broke apart, a paralysing fear overtook Draco.  He kept his eyes shut tightly and slowly lowered his arms from Harry's face to his sides, regret washing over him as he longed for the touch again.  The silence between them felt deafening.
“Well, now that we are all digesting another magnificent feast, I beg a few moments of your attention for the usual start-of-term notices.  First years ought to know that the forest in the grounds is out of bounds to students — and a few of our older students ought to know by now too.”  I snorted to myself.  “Mr Filch, the caretaker, has asked me, for what he tells me is the four hundred and sixty-second time, to remind you all that magic is not permitted in corridors between classes, nor are a number of other things, all of which can be checked on the extensive list now fastened to Mr Filch’s office door.  We have had two changes in staffing this year.  We are very pleased to welcome back Professor Grubbly-Plank, who will be taking Care of Magical Creatures lessons; we are also delighted to introduce Professor Umbridge, our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.  Tryouts for the House Quidditch teams will take place on the —”  A stout lady dressed head to toe in an obnoxious pink stood from her seat, not gaining much height, and squeaked out a small
“We’ll… everything will be okay.  I promise Harry.”  My voice shook.  I prayed to Merlin that I’d be able to keep that promise.  Harry practically melted into me and I couldn’t help but hold him tighter.  “It’ll be okay.”
“Potter… I… uh…”  Words weren’t forming sentences.
"Mm, what?" Draco mumbled, cursing how red his face must be by now.
“What?  You wanted to just drag me out here to embarrass me or what, maybe just waste my time?”  Potter practically screamed at me.  I clenched my fists at my side.  “Well?”
“I probably can’t.  Slytherins only do rounds on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.”  I place my hand on his cheek.  “If I could sneak out, I would but…”  He nodded as his smile faded.
“I’ve got a query about your course aims,” said Hermione. Professor Umbridge raised her eyebrows.
“And it’s meant to feel… that good?”  Draco’s eyes remained wide and mouth hanging open.  Harry nodded and kissed Draco’s cheek.
“Never you mind.”  He glared at her as she turned to assist some other students.
"I'm down.  You got an idea for a logo, Harry?"  Mason stalked by Harry, snatching his drumstick
With a low moan, Harry deftly flipped Draco onto the bed on his back.  Draco gasped, the air knocked out of his while Harry looked down at him with hooded eyes.
“Is this okay?” Harry breathed into Draco’s neck, completely frozen, sucking in the sweet floral scent of Draco’s shampoo.  Draco nodded after a moment, his finger’s combing through Harry’s soft locks.
“Hi,” He breathed.  I quickly walked towards him  “Hi.  Merlin
curse but Draco repeatedly told him to not worry about it.  Draco, in turn, kept apologizing for his actions in the war until Harry convinced him to start Auror training.  Both were grateful for the forgiveness of the other man, but neither would speak of it.
“It’s great.  It really is Draco.”  Harry’s voice had a slightly musical lilt to it.  I smiled.
“I’ve barely gotten the chance to unpack my trunk, let alone schedule a date,” I whispered.
“Jokes aside, it will be okay in the end,” She said more firmly this time.  I nodded.
Harry, however, ended up going to the Weasley’s for a week, coming back to train for the tournament however he could think of.  Hermione came back with him, but Weasel stayed with his family for a little while longer since one of his brothers was home.  At least that’s what Harry told me.  Since the castle was fairly empty, we were a bit less cautious about meeting.  I’d join them in the empty library as Hermione poured over a book about the history of the tournament for no less than the fifteenth time as Harry groaned about wanting to do realistic training — duelling, flying, the works.  I’d try to focus, but with Harry nudging my feet under the table and asking to go play Catch the Snitch, it was difficult, and Harry had a very convincing pout.  Hermione would chastise us for being reckless and not using our time wisely, but Harry loved mocking her as soon as we got alone.
“I— I was going to tell him tomorrow,” I mumbled as Pansy ran her fingers through my hair.
“Do you want me to stay?” Pansy eventually whispered.  I nodded.
We stayed together much later than most nights.  The sun had long since set by the time we parted.  We walked, hand in hand, to the vine-covered exit.
“Harry,” I finally called out.  I smiled as he turned around.  He finally got that haircut he needed and he’d grown a bit over summer.  His jaw was sharper and brow seemed set in a permanent furrow.  Yet, even despite the distance, I could see the dullness in his normally bright eyes.
“How stupid can this boy be?” My father grumbled. My stomach dropped.
“No, I want to.  I really want to.”  Draco smiled and quickly kissed Harry.  A bright smile covered Harry’s face as he gently pushed Draco back on the bed.
"Yeah, yeah I'm alright. Tired, you know? Prides draining," Harry laughed as they packed their instruments and personal equipment. Cole clapped him on the shoulder, flashing his all-knowing smile that understood Harry wouldn't, or couldn't, talk about it.
Now, it is the view of the Ministry that a theoretical knowledge will be more than sufficient to get you through your examination, which, after all, is what school is all about.”  She turned her gaze on one of the Patil twins, whose hand was now high in the air.  “And your name is?”
“Draco—”  Pansy called from my room but I continued walking.
"I... right." Harry's glare softened. "I confused you with the other Harry in our class. Sorry." Harry held up his shot glass in a silent "cheers", and him, Jasper and Draco drank simultaneously.
“Good luck Draco.  We’re proud of you, always.”  My father smiled down at me.  I nodded.  The platform was crowded now, bustling with parents wishing their children well and siblings begging to accompany their brothers and sisters to Hogwarts.  Crabbe and Goyle had already found each other, bumbling along with their fathers.  They held a newly found arrogance about them and I mentally cursed having to spend another year alongside them.  Blaise was being fussed at by his mother and looked distastefully around the Platform.  Soon, a swarm of red-heads bustled in, along with Hermione and Harry, and a large, bearlike black dog.  My father sneered at the sight of it.  “That
“That’s a big ‘if’ Pansy.  I can’t just expose myself like this.  Even if I obliviate him, then I still have to live with the crushing truth he doesn’t like me back.”  I watched Pansy walking back and forth, slowly getting a headache.  I need to sleep.
"He does look pretty good," Pansy agreed.  The crowd erupted around them as the band finished the first song.  Draco immediately began pushing through the crowd to get towards the front, Pansy yelling at him as he left her.  "Asshole," She muttered as she lost sight of him, but Draco didn't care.  He needed to get closer, to see more of this new Harry.
“I’m offering to help you up, Potter.”  He just stared at me.
“Okay.”  Pansy pressed a kiss to my temple before slipping out of my bed.  I laid back down as I heard the door click closed behind her.  I stayed there for hours just staring at the ceiling before grabbing my book, trying to focus my time on reading.  At 6:30, I gave up, washed my face and walked down to our spot.  When I walked through the vines, I saw Harry already by the water, pacing.
“You want to know about my life?”  I chuckled.
“I missed you,” I muttered into his hair.  He looked up and pressed a hard kiss against my lips.  I moved my hands to his neck and deepened the kiss.  A rush of bliss coursed through my veins.  His lips tasted intoxicatingly sweet as I tried to pull him closer than I thought was physically possible.
“You know,” Pansy grumbled as we walked down another empty, dark corridor a couple of hours into our rounds.  “I was so excited to be a Prefect but now this is just boring.”  Just then, a few voices came floating down the corridor ahead of us.  “Oh finally!  People!  I bet you five sickles they’re Gryffindors.”  I shook my head at Pansy’s excitement.  Ahead of us, Hermione and Weasel rounded the corner.  “Ha!” Pansy whispered.  “You owe me.”
“Good.  Let’s keep it that way.”  Harry laid his head against my chest and sighed contently.  I wrapped my arm around his shoulders and chuckled lightly as he intertwined our legs.
I followed the next few days in a similar fashion until a few days before the Leaving Feast.  Pansy came in to check on me late in the evening and found me lying on my bed, staring at the ceiling.
“I got it!”  She stopped pacing and turned back to me.  “Ask him to meet you by the lake — anonymously!  Just don't let him know it's you.  When he gets there, tell him your feelings, and either he'll return them or not accept it yet.  Either way, he'll know at least”.  I shook my head.
“No, don’t be.”  I chewed on my cheek.
“Don’t worry.  Thursday then?”  I nodded.
“Dumbledore will bend over backwards for that boy! He’s got the whole of the Ministry wrapped around his little finger—” My mother laid a careful hand on his chest and he let out a sharp breath, regaining his composure.
“Yeah, I guess you could say so.”  I shake my head.  “Complicated doesn’t even seem to cover it honestly.”  Pansy reached across the table and gently took my hand.
“Wanna head up to the library after dinner and get started on that moonstone essay?” Pansy asked through a mouthful of mashed potatoes.
“Okay, fine.  Be that way,” She snapped.  I rolled my eyes.  “How’s Harry?”  I shrugged.  I wish I knew.  I wish we could be normal and I could just greet him on the train or in the hall.
“I’m sorry!  The song said one hour and when Fleur didn’t come down I thought her sister would drown!”  He explained, exasperated.  He’d explained the same thing plenty of times by now and didn’t want to keep repeating it, but I doubted I’d be the last person to comment on it.
"Right.  I'll turn it."  He fumbled his way through flipping the record over and starting the music again.  "I'm getting some water."  He quickly left the lounge, practically running to the kitchen.  He grabbed a glass but opted to splash water on his face first, hoping to cool himself down.  Draco filled the glass and quickly downed it.
“I saw it in Divination.”  She looked at me seriously before cracking a small, tight smile.  I choke on some pumpkin juice.
“Are you sure it’s okay?”  I asked, looking away from Harry and towards the water.  “Me not saying it?”  He took my hand and squeezed it.
This became a semi-regular occurrence.  If Draco had to wake Harry, he'd first try yelling, and if that didn't work, he'd quickly cast
I looked at my father again. He nodded again, swallowing thickly, pride in his eyes.
“You promise?”  My voice was shaky and I cursed silently at myself.
For a couple of minutes, the room was full of the sound of scratching quills on parchment. When everyone had finished, Umbridge spoke up again.
"I'm not cooking!  I'm getting takeaway, so you can either come with me or starve."  Draco stopped and glared at Harry.  Draco knew he was right — he didn't know how to cook and he was quite hungry after the day he had.
“That… was…” Harry breathed.
As the chorus began again, Harry leaned forward over the most crowded spot on the barricade, his eyes catching on those sharp features again, and he knew — Draco Malfoy was standing in the audience. His stomach dropped to the floor as he tore his eyes away. As much as he had fantasised about Draco showing up in the audience one night, he thought it would be only that — a fantasy. Malfoys don't go to Muggle venues to see Muggle bands with a suspiciously magical name. Malfoys certainly don't dye their hair pastel rainbow and show up at pride events and end up seeing said Muggle band with a suspiciously magical name. Focus on the music, Harry. He tried to ground himself as he kept singing. As the chorus finished, Jasper stepped up to play his riff, and Harry stepped back to grab a water. He turned his back to the audience, bobbing along with Mason in an attempt to shake out his nerves.
"Sure."  He sat on the edge of the bed as Harry laid down, giggling, retreating to his own room once Harry was asleep.  He made sure to wake up early to make Harry a hangover cure and silently pray to Merlin Harry didn't remember too much from the night before.
“I know.”  He looked down for a moment.
“I still care about you.”  I placed my hand on his neck and brushed my thumb against his cheek.  “I’d do anything for you.”  Harry finally turned back to me again and nodded.
"Hi." Draco raised his hand as the other boys laughed. Harry shook his head and leaned over the bar to order.
“Get out!” said Hermione, standing up.  I gave Harry one last smirk and a wink before leaving with Pansy.  Hermione slammed the compartment door behind us.
.  I shoot Harry a preemptive apologetic glance.
"It's alright, I'd rather help you than sleep without knowing it."  Harry said.  Draco thought he sounded genuine, almost too genuine.  He wanted to sneer about how he didn't need his pity, but he knew the new Draco he was trying to create wouldn't do that.
I kept my eyes on the red vines, carefully following them as they wove through the forest.  I counted the trees as I passed them.  Five… six… seven… Just past the seventh tree, the vines began climbing a nearby tree, connecting a handful of small trees to form almost a wall.  I looked back towards the castle and found that, though I had only walked for just over five minutes, the castle was entirely out of sight and the seventh tree was a few yards behind me.  I followed the rest of the vines through the tree and made a tunnel to a small curtain of green vines. I pushed away a few vines and peeked into a small, enclosed area.
“Come on then,
I gulped.
“No,” said Harry, more loudly.  I bit the inside of my cheek harder.  I shouldn’t laugh at this.  He’s my boyfriend but… he’s just so bad at potions.  It’s the first day for Merlin’s sake.  “I forgot the hellebore…”
.  I turned back to the forest.
That night, with his limited art skills, Harry drew up a concept — Patronus written in dark blue with silver antlers behind it.  The others loved it, of course, not understanding the alternate meaning for Harry, and so they kept it.
“HARRY POTTER!”  Dumbledore yelled, glaring at Harry.  He slowly got up and walked to Dumbledore, who simply walked into the small room behind Harry.
“Are you telling us that the first time we’ll get to do the spells will be during our exam?”
Pansy gave me a concerned look and elbowed me in the ribs. She nodded her head towards the door and raised her eyebrows at me. I nodded slightly and followed her out, silently.  It wasn't until we got into an alcove that she looked at me.
The next morning, my owl dropped off a copy of the Daily Prophet and a note from my father.
“Your son has been named as a Prefect for Slytherin House.” She held it up to my father who smirked proudly.
“Check it out,”  Blaise beamed.  I picked up the pin reading “SUPPORT CEDRIC DIGGORY — THE REAL HOGWARTS CHAMPION”.
“Isn’t it perfect?”  I asked.
“This is school, Mr Potter, not the real world,” she said softly.
"VKs?" Draco leaned into Harry this time. He noticed the other boys talking and laughing next to them but didn't care enough to tune in. He was more focused on the closeness of Harry's body, the heat and energy radiating off of him, the feeling he caused in Draco's stomach, his brilliant smile in the flashing lights. Harry tried to focus on anything other than their proximity. The last time Harry remembered being this close to Draco was when he clung to him on the back of a broom, escaping the burning Room of Requirement. He liked to chalk up his heart rate and butterflies to almost dying, but at that point, nearly dying was just another Tuesday. Draco clinging to him was not, however.
Harry removed his fingers and reached for a condom from the nightstand.  After putting it on, he grabbed the bottle again, lubing his cock.  Draco looked up at the sudden emptiness but didn’t mind watching Harry lubing himself.  The dark hair on his chest was matted with sweat and bottom lip drawn up between his teeth.
“There is somebody else who must be mentioned in connection with Cedric’s death,” Dumbledore went on.  “I am talking, of course, about Harry Potter.  Harry Potter managed to escape Lord Voldemort.  He risked his own life to return Cedric’s body to Hogwarts.  He showed, in every respect, the sort of bravery that few wizards have ever shown in facing Lord Voldemort, and for this, I honour him.”  Dumbledore slowly raised his goblet back up, everyone else following suit, mumbling a quiet toast to Harry.  I gripped my own goblet harder, wishing I could toast him.  “The Triwizard Tournament’s aim was to further and promote magical understanding.  In the light of what has happened — of Lord Voldemort’s return — such ties are more important than ever before.
“Could Flitwick
"This is... really good!"  Draco smiled and took another bite while Harry laughed.
was standing in the cauldron.”  I felt all air leave my body as I froze.
“I have—”
“Not particularly.  I didn’t sleep.”  I pushed some eggs around my plate and sighed.
“Where are we?”  Harry asked quietly.  I smiled and pulled back the green vines.  “Oh my…”
"Better with this old baby in my hands!"  He yelled without a mic.  Harry shook his head at his friend's antics.  He loved these boys.  He still loved his friends from Hogwarts of course, but there was something about making a name for himself with a handful of like-minded people, starting as a nobody with nothing in a place no one knows your name.  He kept in touch but didn't let anyone know what he was really up to.  Listening to his friends' banter on stage around him lit a fire in his soul.  He was absolutely beaming on the stage, and Draco nearly lost his breath from that dazzling smile.
. My mother squeezed my arm and walked me out.
“Sure.”  Draco smiled and followed Harry to the bathroom.
“Granger is a fiery one,” Pansy muttered.  I raised an eyebrow to her.  “What?”
"Merlin's beard Potter!"  Harry jumped out and rubbed the back of his neck.  "What the — fuck!"  Draco groaned, holding his head.  Foggy memories of the night before popped into his mind.  He remembered the firewhiskey they shared before they went out, having a couple rounds at the first bar, a few rounds of shots at the second and something fruity at the club.  He vaguely remembered stumbling home and Harry bring him up to his room and —
"Hey Malfoy, you're still dressed up but you've got to change before you can sleep,"  Harry explained.  Draco nodded sleepily and held up his arms.  Harry sighed deeply.
“With this position comes great responsibility,”  The Head Boy continued.  “If the Headmaster feels as though you are not living up to your duties or are abusing them, you can and will lose your position, so be smart and respectful.”  He shot a meaningful glance towards Pansy and I.  Pansy cocked her head to the side and raised one challenging eyebrow.  I kept staring defiantly at the Head Boy as he continued.  “Your first task as newly appointed Prefects is to patrol the train throughout our journey.  Make sure the younger classes, particularly First Years, are aware of what to do when we reach Hogwarts, and hold your peers accountable for any troubling actions.  Any questions?”  The carriage remained silent for a moment.  “No?  Perfect!  On your way then.”  He waved a dismissive hand, his eyes still lingering on Pansy and I a moment too long.  I rolled my eyes as we left the carriage.
.  I took the pin and put it on, changing it back to the first message for the time being.
“Weasley,” said Ron, thrusting his hand into the air.  Umbridge turned around with a wicked smile.  Harry and Hermione immediately raised their hands too.  She stared at Harry for a moment before she addressed Hermione.  “Yes, Miss Granger?  You wanted to ask something else?”
We walked in, hand in hand, to the Great Hall to find it silent and dark.  Black drapes replaced those that would normally have the winning house’s colours and crests.  The staff table was full except for Karkoroff’s seat.  We sat down next to Crabbe, Goyle and Blaise silently.  The Hufflepuff table was silent, many staring either down into their plates or at Diggory’s empty seat.  Before the food appeared on the table, Dumbledore carefully stood up.
“Stop ogling over Granger,” I murmured into her ear.  She flushed even darker.
After getting ready for bed early again, I shut the curtains around my bed and stared up at the ceiling, smiling.
"Chocolate chip?" Harry glanced over his shoulder with a lazy smile.  Draco nodded and moved to fill Mitten's bowls.  The room that had been so tense for the past week finally felt comfortable again.  They stood next to each other, Harry stirring the batter and Draco filling Mitten's food bowl, and shared a brief glance of unspoken words.  Harry smiled, dazed, and Draco felt his insides melt at the sight of him.
“Good morning!” She greeted me excitedly.  I laughed.
“What do you think we’re doing right now silly?”  She flirted.  I rolled my eyes.  The hall was now crowded and loud.
“There’s not much to tell,” I muttered.
The sorting began, a few eager First Years joining our table, and few looked on the verge of tears.  Finally, the last girl was sorted into Hufflepuff and Dumbledore stood up.
"Fine—”  Pansy began squealing and hopping about.  “Pansy, calm down.”  She glared at me for a quick moment before breaking out in giggles again.  “Pansy— listen to me.  How?  How do I ask him?”  She paused and zoned out for a moment before exclaiming —
“Harry?”  I took a few steps forward and gently rested my hand on his shoulder.  He leant into it and I saw the tears threatening to spill over.
“We better get back to the Great Hall.  Otherwise, people are going to start thinking!” She winked and wrapped her arms around my right arm, lacing her fingers through mine.  I laughed and we walked back to the Great Hall.  We had an ongoing game, making people think we were an on-off couple, breaking up over nothing and back together again in a day or so.  Everyone knew better than to ask either of us out.  Pansy didn't want a boyfriend, really.  She just wanted to go to school to learn, and I have the Potter Problem.  Being as attractive as we were, we had people lining up to go out with us.  Honestly, we were more like siblings than a couple.  But we kept the act up.  Plus it pleased our parents that we had an interest in each other, setting up a promising future.  We walked back to the Great Hall as people started to disperse from it.
“Hey!  I don’t go looking for trouble; trouble finds me and I just deal with it.”  He playfully glared at me and I couldn’t help but laugh at his pout.
As we were roaming the halls after dinner, Harry turned the corner, head down and shoulders slouched.  Pansy squeezed my hand and nodded.
“I’m sorry,” Harry whispered.  Draco shook his head and laid his hand on top of Harry’s.
“Watch where you’re going—”  I spat, straightening my robes, then looked down at the boy in front of me.  “Potter?”
"The one with blue hair is Cole," Harry yelled over his shoulder as they got closer to the bar. "The quiet one is Mason and the loud one who's probably already doing shots is Jasper." Draco's eyes widened as he realised Harry Potter was introducing him to his bandmates, his friends like they were friends.
“I took it too far, I know.”  I ran my thumb along his cheek.  “But we have to keep up the image that we’re rivals still.”
"Right." Draco nodded and forced a smile.
"Potter, this is not proper in any way—"
"Good evening Edinburgh!" He yelled into the mic.  The crowd cheered, and Harry felt his face break out into a huge grin.  "We are Patronus! Welcome to Edinburgh Pride! Now, who's ready to rock out?"   Harry rode the high into the first song.   "Aye! Now, normally we'd start with an original song, but since it's pride, we thought we'd start with a cover from one of our favourite bands.  Hit it!"  Cole traded in his bass for a synth for the opening song - Girls Girls Boys.   Unbeknownst to Harry, a certain blond man and dark-haired girl stood towards the back of the audience.
“I’m going to clean up.”  He stood up and looked them both over.  “Shower?”  Harry asked, holding out his hand.
“Okay…”  He looked off for a second, then back at me.  “Mind putting your wand away?”  My head snapped up.
“Oh yes, you do Malfoy,”  He laughed.
“I seem to have touched a nerve,” I said, still smirking but feeling a pang of guilt in my gut.  “Well, just watch yourself, Potter, because I’ll be
"I've got the sense you've changed since then," He finally mumbled. Draco looked up and laughed.
“Parvati Patil, and isn’t there a practical bit in our Defense Against the Dark Arts O.W.L.?  Aren’t we supposed to show that we can actually do the countercurses and things?”
“I’m going on a walk.”  I promptly stood up from the table.  Pansy sighed heavily as I walked out of the Great Hall.  I walked around mindless for a few minutes before trying to figure out how to get Harry alone.
“Very good.  It started a bit tense, but then I just told him, and everything just got instantly better.”  I smiled.  “He said he likes me too and that I’m apparently not very subtle at all.”  Pansy began laughing uncontrollably.  “It’s not true and not that funny!”
"Malfoy..."  He whispered.  "Malfoy... Draco..."  Draco groaned softly.
“Miss Parkinson I presume?” He asked, looming over my shoulder, arching a brow.  A test, to see if Pansy could handle the pressure.
“He’s alone now.  If you can catch him in the hall, maybe you can slip him the note then!”  I rolled my eyes.
“Yeah, the sun’s practically set.  Come on, let’s walk back.”  We walked back to a side entrance in comfortable silence.  Just before we reached the door, Pot—
“Oh fuck,” Draco whimpered as Harry’s hands found and squeezed his arse.  Draco bucked his hips wildly, whining into the tiniest bit of contact he could gain.  Harry bit down on the tenderest part of Draco’s neck while pulling Draco’s hips towards him roughly.  “Merlin!”  Harry moaned at the sound of Draco’s breathy whines before pausing.
"Do you want breakfast?"  Draco asked shakily, staring at the hob.
“Now can you take this seriously for a moment, or are you going to laugh at the first part of that statement too?”  I crossed my arms as Potter huffed and rolled his eyes.
“Lucius dear,” My mother pleaded softly, standing to meet him. “Just—”
“So what is it I’m following carefully?”  He asked, laughing.
“Draco,”  I muttered after he stopped laughing.
We walked back separately, but I wanted nothing more than to stay exactly as we were, holding each other in silent warmth, the last bit we might feel of each other for a long time.  The Common Room was empty when I returned, allowing me to slip into my room.
I hoped that he would have the same idea as I did and I could pull him into a broom closet like I did before his first task.  I let out a quiet huff.
“It’s just playing into Malfoy’s hands to look worried, it tells him we don’t know exactly what’s going on. We’ve got to ignore him, Harry. Here, hold the bowtruckle for a moment, just so I can draw its face. . . .”  She passed the bowtruckle to Harry as I stepped towards them.
“Yes he does.”  I let out a heavy sigh and ran my hands through my hair, loosening the gel a bit.
"Really Malfoy?"  Harry tries not to smile but ultimately fails when seeing the joy on Draco's face.  Draco watched him in his drunken stupor, his eyes cloudy.
"Yeah, I'm good."
My stomach dropped.
As the students finished eating and the food began clearing away, Dumbledore stood again, ceasing the rising chatter instantly.
"You love it."
“Remember Cedric.  Remember, if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right and what is easy, remember what happened to a boy who was good, and kind, and brave, because he strayed across the path of Lord Voldemort.  Remember Cedric Diggory.”  My gut sank.
“Why not?” She practically yelled.  She sounded personally offended by it.
“What?”  I scoffed, throwing my sweater into a basket.  “Did a snitch crawl up your ass?”  He turned and pointed at me.
“I’m sorry love,” She whispered in the hall, levitating my trunk behind me. “Your father has no choice now. Please, just be smart.” I nodded. We walked up the stairs together in silence. The house was cold and dark, unlike how it used to be. Despite my father’s interest in the Dark Arts and public appearance, he was a warm man to my mother and I. The house, despite the size, was always warm and well lit with candles. My mother always made a point of eating breakfast and dinner together as a family. She was one of the only people who could make my father smile. I was the second. He adored teaching me to fly when I was young and was thrilled when I began showing an interest in the Dark Arts, despite my interest being more in defensive manoeuvres rather than the offensive. Regardless, he was delighted to spend time with my mother and me during breaks.
We walked into the classroom just as Snape began the lesson instructions — copy the notes off the board for the first half, practising potion-making techniques during the second half.  Pansy dragged me over to a table just behind Potter, who was sitting alone.  I glanced around to find Weasel glaring at Potter with Granger next to him.  What the hell is his problem?  I shook my head, pulled out some parchment and began copying the notes.  A pit slowly formed in my stomach.  I never get nervous, yet even the thought of dropping a note next to Potter stressed me out.  Just stay calm and collected Draco.  I kept my head low and copied the notes, hoping the mindless task would distract me.  A few minutes into the second half of class, Pansy nudged me.
“I have business to attend to,” He snapped. “Now go. I have things to do.” He dismissed me with a wave of his hand.
"Yeah."  Harry nodded sadly.  They stayed there for a few minutes, Draco staring at his hands and Harry staring at the wall.  Eventually, Harry looked up at Draco, smiled lightly and bumped his shoulder with his own.
“Good luck, darling,” said Pansy, grabbing the front of his robes and dragging him down for a kiss. Draco’s eyes flicked up momentarily to catch Theo watching.
“Right,” said Hermione with an exasperated sigh.
Suddenly a white hot pain ripped through Harry’s scar, his hands flew to his forehead as he struggled to muffle a scream of pain.
“That was not what we agreed to,” said Harry, breathing heavily.
It seemed like Draco wanted it too.
When the curse subsided, he realised he was on the ground, writhing in pain.
Sure they had each done something wrong, but who the hell hadn’t? Harry had been just as suspicious of them as they were of him at first. He’d cased the room for a way to escape on his first night in the castle and even executed a runaway attempt. He’d lied straight to their faces
“I guess so,” said Harry. It was true Hermione was clearly motivated by Harry’s achievements more than anything. She just baulked whenever he pushed her to bend the rules.
Moreover, would she still love him if she found out what he was really doing? He was on the brink of usurping the very mission they’d been working all of their young adult lives to build.
“Quite the motley crew you’ve gathered,” said Draco, sauntering over to their regular spot on the couches and casting an
“Don’t talk about them!” shouted Harry, feeling his powers tingling in his hands.
He let a few moments of silence pass, where all that could be heard was his father’s silverware on the china. Draco pretended to be preoccupied with the swirling wine in his glass.
“As long as Umbridge is there, we’ll have to go back eventually for the locket,” said Draco.
“On it,” said Cedric. “Hopefully he’s smart enough not to go near Diagon Alley. The papers are going wild with rumours.”
“Why not?” replied Draco, his lip curling. “Eddie and I are just warming up.”
“Well, not in this case,” said Draco, and Harry saw his wall settling back into place. “Now. About that Occlumency practice.”
His eyes snapped shut as the flames licked around him, and when he landed on solid ground, he opened them in a homely wooden pub much cosier than the one he had just left. Harry gazed around, catching sight of a smirking blond leaned up against a rough-hewn table.
“You’re staying close to Harry because you know the world will find out about him, and when they do, he’ll be famous. The only person in the world to survive a Killing Curse and at the hands of You-Know-Who to boot. You think you can ride his coattails straight to the top,” said Hermione, crossing her arms and smiling like the know-it-all she was.
He had been unsure what to expect, heading out through muggle London earlier in the day with the address his mother had received by owl in response to her note to Lucius’s old business acquaintances. All Narcissa had told him was that after the first wizarding war, she and Lucius knew they needed to move quickly to realign their political affiliations with the right factions. His father had been extremely motivated to diversify the family’s investments in the instance that they were unable to get back in the ministry’s good graces and needed something to fall back on.
. “Please, don’t die,” he willed, pressing the cup to his lips.
“Maybe,” said Draco. And the room went quiet again.
“Draco, can you hear me?” he asked, gripping the other boy’s shoulder and fighting tears. It was a grim sight. Draco’s body was limp and cold despite the proximity of the enchanted flames, and the blood that ran down his neck and pooled around him was dried. Despite it all, Harry thought he could feel a faint heartbeat.
“It’s not like sparks will do much either way if you really need to defend yourself,” said Draco, nudging Harry with an elbow.
Draco blinked back in bewilderment, wondering how it could be that the other four were saddled with visions of wartime while he’d been sent to a madhouse. Could it be that the diadem made a mistake? Maybe it had weakened after all that it had been put through already today. It was an ancient relic, after all. There was no way there was a possible timeline where he’d be caught dead in these clothes.
Harry had expected at best an excited response, at worst an awkward laugh, but the ashen look of horror that flew across Draco’s face cut him like a knife.
Sometimes, when the others were around, Draco was quick to answer or brush off any of Harry’s questions into his past. But when they were alone together, like the first time they flew, he was more forthcoming. He probably thought he was great at hiding it, but Harry was starting to see his tells – when he was being honest and when he was trying to deflect.
The card was inverted, depicting an old man seated in a stone archway looking out onto the green lands of an estate. A young couple embraced in the distance, with a child and a dog playing at their feet.
“Nothing odd, just this and that,” she replied. “He was telling me the funniest story earlier about an Auror case he was on where a gangster thought his old crime boss was stalking him back from the dead, and it turned out to be a boggart! Can you imagine?”
Draco could barely suppress his glee. Could it really be this easy?
Draco felt a pain in his chest. The memory of Lily laying her life down for her son came roaring back to his mind as he was reminded of what true love looked like. What you’d be willing to sacrifice for the other person. He knew he could never give that to Pansy.
Despite the fact that they were wanted fugitives, Harry thought that life at Grimmauld Place was not altogether terrible.
“Well, it won’t be the first time you were wrong.”
“When one has served as a reliable guard for as many decades as I have, there is no reason to change,” Lucius continued. “But our Lord currently wishes to have it kept close as it holds some sentimental value; a record of his youth.”
Draco’s eyes went wide as he reached out a hand to stroke the air incredulously. “Unbelievable. A genuine invisibility cloak,” he said, unable to hide the amazement in his voice. Even he, who had seen a great deal more than most at his age, had never laid eyes on one.
“The wand!” roared Umbridge. “I have been commanded on the highest authority in the land to retrieve Dumbledore’s wand from the castle where it was removed from the body illegally and concealed from Ministry officials.”
“Not sure I would have believed him if he did,” said Harry, cocking a dark eyebrow. “I mean he was a bit funny, I knew that much. He always turned up at the park on days I really needed to see him. Sometimes he seemed to know things he could never possibly know. But I always thought he was just a funny old man.”
Sitting back in his chair, Draco scrutinised the messy-haired boy across from him who was still glancing at the paper, sunlight catching in his round frames.
“She’s not half bad, you know,” said Harry.
Harry looked up, realising all eyes in the room were still on him. “What’s curious, sir?”
unusual.
The next afternoon, Draco steeled himself for what he had to do.
But Harry was still standing. He looked down at his hands, pulsing with magic and around at the room which was bowed out at the support beams. Voldemort would pay for what he had taken.
Harry gingerly swung his legs off the bed to face Draco. “Yeah, alright.” He smiled his annoyingly charming smile and said, “How is it you know the solution to all my problems?”
“You should stay,” said Hermione, without looking up from the diagnostic spells she was casting over Harry. “We’re better at making sense of these things when we’re all together.”
He ran his thumb across the king’s shield, which bore strange etchings, and briefly wondered at how Al had found his way into Harry’s life. He tossed the second king into his bag, zipped it up, and slung it over his shoulder.
The bard, taking this pause as acquiescence, strummed his lute and began to recite.
“It’s just as I suspected. You do have something to hide,” said Voldemort. “You will find that you cannot hide it for long.
“Seems a waste of time to be spending all that energy flirting in the first place,” continued Hermione, ignoring his comment. “She already thinks the world of you, Merlin knows why.”
One of Dudley’s lumps of a friend knelt down to unlock his bike, and lept back screaming about a “fuckin’ snake,” which made everyone jump until the rest of the gang saw that it was about the size of a pencil. The little green creature was wound around the spoke of a bike, flicking its tongue in and out in panic.
“Not enough.” Try as he might after the session with Malfoy, Harry couldn’t access the memories of the green flash. And now more than ever he was dying to learn about these incredible people he had never known, but who so many in this world held in high esteem. “What’s Malfoy’s story, anyway?”
“You pick things up fast,” said Angelica with a coy smile. “Does that hold with your past?”
He turned his head to look at Pansy. She was perched on the arm of the chair with one leg folded under her. A finger lazily twirling a strand of dark hair. She really was quite beautiful, objectively speaking.
“I could never think it, my love,” said Narcissa, running a hand down his cheek. “I have long known the mistake we made in isolating our needs and ignoring those of the many. But please don’t tell me what you plan to do… he is often in my thoughts.”
“Well, you nearly gave Kreacher a heart attack,” said Draco, pouring a cup. “And that’s a second set of Mother’s china smashed. I’ll never hear the end of it.”
“But Harry, even if we make it there, you’ll still be confronting one of the strongest wizards alive. It’s not going to be easy, it’s not like you’ll be able to just disarm him.”
“I’m not the only one who thinks so. There’s a painting of a bard in the Transfigurations corridor who definitely knows something,” said Luna with a nod. “He said he’d tell me what he knows if I can help him finish his sonnet. So I’m headed to the library later to look up rhymes for ‘Thestral’.”
“Dumbledore’s Army.”
He was making some progress with navigating Harry through his memories though, and the tentative friendship they’d formed definitely helped. The last few sessions had been mostly memories of Harry’s best friend, a pretty Muggle girl, and the various adventures they went on both in and out of school. Though Draco was growing tired at Harry’s tedious obliviousness of her affection.
As the others filtered out, Harry could feel the lingering effects of the Butterbeer, somehow making him more aware than ever of the fact that he was alone with Draco. Perhaps it was the way he wore Harry’s jeans, or the confident, borderline arrogant way he cracked open two more Butterbeers and gestured towards the chairs near the fire.
“Exactly, we’re running out of time,” said Harry. “The longer he has Charlotte, the longer she’s at risk of serious injury.”
“Voldemort had already risen to power in my timeline,” said Luna, swirling her tea and gazing into the depths of her cup. “And the Ministry had fallen too. The only difference was that we had time on our side.” She looked up, and Harry was surprised to see a hint of melancholy in her eyes. “I should have mentioned it, but I thought it was too good to be true – in my vision, my mother was still alive.”
“I have half a mind to.” Draco’s anger was turning to frustration. “I’m two weeks into learning about Potter’s pathetic life and I’m no closer to understanding his true power, or what happened, or whether the Dark Lord would rather see him delivered whole or incinerated.”
“No reason,” said Draco, straightening up and repositioning his wand for another round. “You seem to have better control over your memories of Charlotte. Show me another one?”
“Riddle,” he said in a voice barely louder than a whisper. He looked past them into the store, as though reliving the day he met the man. “Tom Riddle. Such a strong sense of magic from that boy. I knew it when I saw him. Thirteen and a half inches, yew, Phoenix feather core. I hardly recognised him when he re-emerged in the war, but the wand… unmistakable.”
“They’re just enchanted,” said Hermione dismissively.
He was partly relieved to have one less set of lies to maintain, but he knew it would come at a cost. She would only show her hand now as a bargaining measure.
“That’s not how it’s meant to be,” said Draco, letting him go at last. “You’re meant to face him, I just know it. And I’m meant to get you there. That’s all.”
What the hell was he doing? He didn’t even know what side Snape was really on. But the reality was, he didn’t have anyone else to go to: It was either hope that Snape could help him and risk exposure of his questioned loyalties, or explode from the pressure of keeping it all hidden.
which erupted out of him like a cannon, before he was hit with a knockback and fell to the ground.
Unlike the visions of the others, which all contained some hopeful gleam, this reality was bleak. For one thing, the Dark Lord’s power unbridled was truly a sight of horror. Draco had always believed when the Dark Lord returned that the wizarding world would reach unparalleled success, perhaps even merging with or eclipsing the Muggle world. But surely not destroying it. The pure-bloods would be just rulers.
“Lily and James would be so proud.” She smiled warmly down at him through her square spectacles.
But Kreacher was not running towards him. He stumbled the last few steps towards the sitting area, arms outstretched, reaching for the locket.
“A portion?”
However, it turned out there was more in the memory to surprise him than he knew.
“So if I had been here all along, you wouldn’t have been able to mix with someone like me,” said Harry.
“I heard they only hire staff who are part Veela,” continued Blaise, coming around the settee to plop down in a wingback armchair near Pansy, and handing her an old-fashioned in a sparkling tumbler. Blaise too wore a muggle-style suit in a light grey, though they’d had to transfigure it for him after there wasn’t anything in the store long enough to fit his towering frame.
“Great, thanks for that,” said Harry, unzipping the bag and beaming as he withdrew a terrarium with a thoroughly dazed looking Ivy. She flicked her tongue angrily at him before retreating into a hollow branch. He’d definitely have some explaining to do, but he was relieved to see her.
he thought.
which he’d dissected with Harry, poring over every score and match up. The chess set which he had frequently sat opposite from, gazing at the board through long eyelashes as his strategic brain whirled away. Even Ivy, who was speaking to Harry less and less lately, he couldn’t help but picture poking out of the collar of Draco’s robes.
“Unbelievable,” said Draco, looking between the two as Harry grinned mischievously. “Where’s Granger with her vision charm? You both need your eyes checked.”
Besides the fact that Harry was playing no one, the game had unfolded just like one of the hundreds he’d played in the park growing up. It had been like sitting opposite Al’s ghost, the strategies of the black side were so similar to his old tactics.
Minerva bit her tongue. Let Dumbledore try to explain his plan to another and see if it still made sense. Hagrid was too softhearted to leave Harry here, she was sure, but then again he had been an unwavering supporter of Dumbledore’s these past many years.
Draco looked back around at him. His aristocratic features were creased with worry far too heavy for someone his age. He opened his mouth to speak.
He’d seen the object before in the Black family vaults. As the sole descendant of the noble and most ancient House of Black that wasn’t excommunicated from the family or currently incarcerated, the cup technically belonged to him.
“No, I don’t believe so,” said Harry, glancing at McGonagall, who looked like her eyebrows were about to raise right off her head. “I’m Muggle-born, sir.” said Harry, repeating the term he’d heard from Hermione.
The pale woman finally stopped at a midnight blue booth with a low table, glittering with an enchanted light that slightly illuminated the space from below. She gestured with a graceful hand and slowly blinked her white eyelashes at them with a dreamy smile. Harry leaned over to speak to her over the noise of the crowd and she nodded and drifted away.
In a flash, Hermione leapt to her feet and shouted
“We’re conducting a bit of research.” Hermione lowered her voice and leaned forward, folding her arms on the high counter. “On behalf of Hogwarts.”
“You can’t understand what they’ve done. What they were,” she said in a shaking voice, her fingers brushing away the hair that covered his scar. “At first I couldn’t stand the sight of you, knowing what that man did. But over the years, I have seen it as my duty to protect you.”
“What? But I want them,” said Harry, wheeling on Hermione. “Change me back. You said it’s all reversible, right?”
“As long as Umbridge falls for the fake locket long enough for you to get off the grounds, they won’t be after you. Their orders will be to monitor students,” said Draco.
There was a strange pause as the song switched over on the record and a new, slow guitar started up.
and had progressed to levitating small books. The proper test would be whether he could sustain red sparks, but even Hermione agreed it was a lot to expect of him, given that he hadn’t been able to practise with the new wand yet.
“But you are Harry, aren’t you?” asked an Indian girl with a waterfall of shiny, dark hair draped over one shoulder, her robes bearing a blue crest.
She was only making it harder on the both of them to have to keep their cover stories up around the Fidelius. She wasn’t even being subtle about it. Of course approaching him in the Great Hall would raise some eyebrows, Hermione hadn’t spoken one on one to him since their sorting. She wasn’t known for speaking much to anyone, in fact.
He had furthermore not planned on Potter, now unemployed, to accept said invitation. For all his wits, Draco could not understand what Potter would find appealing about spending some of his newly gained free time wandering around the misty fields of Dornoch with one former enemy and two bumbling Americans, hitting around a tiny ball with a stick.
“I don’t reckon you’d know anything about this then?” said Blaise, flipping back to the front page of the
“You’re bloody right I don’t understand. Just cope like a normal person and pretend it never happened,” said Draco, sweeping over to Snape’s desk and starting to roughly tidy before the first lesson of the day. Snape wouldn’t even have time for breakfast before there’d be first-years in here. “Merlin, your desk is a mess. You’re welcome for saving your life by the way.”
Harry gripped the straps of his backpack, reciting the plan in his mind. He’d come too far to be derailed now by crooked rhetoric.
“Of course,” said Harry.
“Yes, but his magic seems to be much more stable since the new wand,” said Hermione. “I started researching accidental magic to see if it was related, but it doesn’t sound like what we’ve got on our hands. I did read something about a mis-classified Obscurial case, where the individual suffered bouts of burst magic and would often sleep Apparate, waking up in different and strange places. Until he, erm, splinched himself accidentally.”
“Harry, your eyes,” said Draco, his words sounding like the fear of God had been dropped into him.
“You mean none of the wands are suitable?” asked McGonagall, failing to hide a note of exasperation in her voice.
Why was he here? Why had he dropped his broom and come running the moment he felt the Galleon grow warm in his pocket? And why was he carrying the blasted thing in the first place, hoping for the time to come that he might get a chance to make amends with the stupid bespectacled git?
“Hello again, Potter,” said a cold, high voice that seemed to issue from Harry’s own mouth. Harry strained against the vision, but Voldemort felt stronger, more in control than the last time their minds had connected. “I was beginning to worry about you.”
Harry flashed back to the whirlpool of memories that Malfoy had pushed him to the edge of and his
Harry blinked back at Draco before brushing past him as he walked off toward the ball, knocking shoulders as he went. “Merlin, you’re insufferable,” he muttered.
“I mean, I don’t know how it’s possible, but if Voldemort is truly dying, it could make sense to pull life from another source. Unless,” she crouched down next to Harry, the locket still clutched in her hand. “Maybe he’s going to use you like a vessel, Like he did Quirrell. To try and possess you somehow. That’s why he wants you there.”
Draco crept back into the common room late that night, his mind spinning over the last few hours with Harry. He’d finally accessed the memory that might hold the clues to the Potter’s defeat of the Dark Lord on that fateful night, and it had been utterly useless.
“There, that’s a long-lasting vision spell so that should hold up as long as you need,” said Hermione, thrusting a set of dark robes into his hands.
“Oh?” said Harry, his eyes trained on the board. “That could be interesting. Protecting people. Solving crimes.”
“Stunners, huh?” said Harry, as he watched Draco hit Cedric with something that made his legs go limp, and he smiled broadly in Harry’s direction.
“He did one time pull a full umbrella out of his jacket pocket when it started raining,” said Harry with a laugh. “I guess you just convince yourself of what you want to see – oh my god move already.”
On the day before the Express departed, Hermione dictated a detailed research plan to the group, doling out books on artefacts from the library, as well as a few old auction guides she could get her hands on from Madame Pince’s newspaper archive. Draco was tasked with scouring the Malfoy Manor library for any further clues around Horcruxes, however he did not reveal to her that it was a room he would not step into on pain of death.
Harry stood, torn between whether this was a dream or a nightmare, as a translucent Severus Snape shuffled past him, mumbling, “Montmorency… never understood the dangers of ashwinder…”
“Is that a premonition or guess, Darling?” Draco chimed in. Angelica raised her eyebrows but smiled at the challenge.
“None of us really know what happened, that’s the mystery. You-Know-Who was building a vast following for years, promoting the powerful and harming half-bloods and Muggles. But a group of rebels stood against him. He killed many, but when he came to kill your family, the final curse backfired and he was never seen again. They say the Potters died for the good of wizarding kind,” said Luna.
As Draco turned the corner, he was stunned to find himself face to face with a hallway full of people. Some were sitting, some standing, most had luggage or backpacks. There were families, couples, old people, maybe 50 or so altogether. All looked stricken with worry. A strange quiet hung in the air as people milled about. One mother was softly humming as she cradled two small children.
“Yes, but the tight wand movement allows the caster to control the aim,” said Cedric from Harry’s other side.
Hermione shut her book quietly and laid it to the side. Then, turning to face him dead on, she asked, “Harry, who is your best friend?”
he asked.
“A Horcrux?” asked Hermione when they were back in the Room of Requirement. “I’ve never heard of such a thing.”
“It would have to be something of immense value,” mused Draco. “The only other object of lore would be Gryffindor’s sword. But that’s just a legend.”
“Thanks for bringing it. Too bad I’ll be gone by then,” said Harry, his eyes lingering on the flashes of players swooping across the page as he laid it to the side. “If I can get the blasted wand to work for me.”
“Lucky for me then that you missed those last two holes,” said Draco, unable to resist prying. Damn, this was not at all the direction he wanted this conversation to go. He needed to get them back on a topic where they had common ground.
“Is this making any sense to you?” Draco asked, as Harry looked up from the spindly handwriting.
Draco scoffed, “Tonight is just settling a bet.”
“I wasn’t trying to hurt him,” insisted Harry. “But the whole point of this has been learning how to defend myself. And I’ve done that.”
“Why? I’m already caught up on the levitation practice she set me, see?” Harry pointed at a chair and said, “
“Yeah, it was rather a funny coincidence that they knew exactly where to find me,” said Harry.
Draco kept his eyes trained on the ceiling, but he couldn’t lie to Harry. Not now. “I had a feeling he might know something about it. He said the Dark Lord asked him to keep it close by. I think it’s with him at Wisteria Hall. Or maybe the Manor.”
That only left Slytherin’s locket and the diary that Potter had heard of in his diadem vision.
“When you’re in there, it’s not like all your memories come flooding back. Concentrate on what you need to remember,” said Luna.
Golf, in Draco’s opinion, was an absolutely ludicrous sport which involved more luck than skill to hit a snitch-sized ball about a mile away into a cup. He was shocked that anyone could possibly desire to play this game, much less play it without magic, but he was nevertheless glad he had taken the bet on lessons, so he didn’t look completely clueless.
“The one where you nearly killed me with an experimental spell,” said Draco. There was the eyebrow.
“So, I was wondering,” said Theo from across the table, breaking the silence of the friend group. “Would you want to come around to mine over break? Dad’s been clearing out the back paddock to make a golfing green. We could use it to practice Quidditch moves for the Gryffindor game.”
“Kreacher would love it,” he said, moving his rook. “But what would you do?”
Snakes really were peculiar creatures, thought Harry. To have no desire to return to the place where she had grown up, to so quickly abandon the one that had cared for her enough to save her from Dudley’s gang. And yet, she wasn’t wrong. The castle was fascinating, and Hermione, Draco, Cedric, and Luna, while strange, were incredible. In another life he would have given everything to have been able to spend his years at Hogwarts, among these people. His friends.
to think of Draco, but it turned out reminders of him were everywhere.
“Watch out – Stunners!” shouted Hemione, gripping the edge of her seat.
McGonagall said nothing, but Draco sped up, steering Harry more quickly to the door as the Aurors were exiting. Harry had a feeling Draco knew what was coming next as well as he did.
“That wasn’t so hard, was it?” said Tonks, leading him around to the drive. “Honestly, I don’t know what’s gotten into you today. There hasn’t been a day I’ve known you that you haven’t said good morning to your parents.”
“Master Regulus!” cried Kreacher, snatching at the air, tangling his little hands in the golden chain and trying to tug it from Cedric’s grip. “Kreacher tried so hard. Kreacher tried his best master, Kreacher hasn’t forgotten his duty!”
Why that hurt so much, Harry didn’t know. “What did he say?”
When Draco didn’t respond, Hermione shot a spell across the room that made the book stand on end. “I’m not sure there’ll be much about Harry’s past in
“That one felt pretty good, don’t you think?” said Harry, feeling a sense of pride at finally completing one of Malfoy’s memory tasks.
When they returned, Harry was surprised to find the room was not empty. Malfoy was reclined on the sofa, paging through a copy of
Draco craned his neck over her shoulder to read a passage titled “The strange case of a mis-diagnosed Obscurial; 1968,” accompanied by a picture of a witch in a turtleneck and vest, speaking to a small child on a tufted ottoman.
By now, Draco had seen so many films he was forced to admit that Muggle ingenuity had its high points. Though he was fairly certain that no one who made Jurassic Park had ever seen any sort of Dragon in real life, nor had the makers of Ghostbusters ever encountered a real ghost. He had no idea what type of creature the Muggles were basing Alien off of, but the whole experience frightened him about as much as the time they were hunted by Dementors, so he didn’t pursue the matter.
“If that’s what you call help, I think I’ve had enough of it, thanks.”
she said, tilting her head.
“No, he’s right,” said Draco.
“You put on a hell of a show of it,” said Cedric, crossing his arms over his Auror uniform. “Fighting Death Eaters with grade one spells. Not many would have survived as long as you did.”
Carrow turned to look, his eyes widening when he caught sight of the two of them. This was no good. Harry could tell they recognised him. Without even wondering how they could have found him, Harry’s mind started flicking through options for their escape.
“A bore, you say,” said Voldemort, the light of the fire dancing in his red eyes. “And what, I wonder, do you make of the news in the wizarding world these days?”
“You wish, Potter,” said Malfoy.
“Yes, I must thank you for raising that to my attention.” Dumbledore cast another forlorn look down at the sleeping baby. “I had not considered that the biggest risk to Harry might well be his discovery by the followers of Voldemort, despite the considerable protection of the blood magic that wards this house. The means of his survival of the Killing Curse remain yet unclear, and so we must not risk exposure. That is why we must make him disappear.”
“I wish. That’d be one thing I’d have done at any rate,” said Draco, dreading how much he had actually put off to help Potter on his stupid memory lesson. “No, it was just a late one at Quidditch practice. I’m absolutely knackered.”
“Bit of everything I suppose.”
Harry turned the page, knowing that he’d see the companion photo of Weaver and Patient M all grown up.
“You’re staying?” asked Hermione
“How could he?”
Voldemort looked like he wanted to spit curses at Harry until his last breath, but as he approached, the Dark Lord’s face broke into a frightening grin and his shrill laugh pierced the room over the din of battle.
He couldn’t go on like this. He would turn himself over to McGonagall, give her all the information he could on the brethren, and let her do with him what she would. He couldn’t bear to see the look of disappointment in one other person’s eye at his fall from grace.
“Well done, mate,” said Cedric appreciatively, leaving forward to inspect the cup and tilting it into the glimmering light by one of its delicate handles.
For starters, she confirmed Abraxas’s involvement in the US trade negotiations of his day, as well as Edgar’s friendship with Lucius before the war. And while she confirmed that there had never been a contractual arrangement between the two families of the sort that Edgar described, she knew of other means by which Lucius may have raised the funds and support for such a venture. It was with a shaking hand she wrote the introductory letter for Draco to meet some of Lucius’s old business associates in London.
A large wingback armchair was situated in front of the fireplace, and another smaller man flitted about nervously. Approaching, Draco realised that twined around the legs of the armchair was an enormous green snake.
“Excellent,” said Dumbledore, the twinkle in his eye returning.
“He’ll be fine, Potter,” said McGonagall, clasping and unclasping her hands as she glided into the room. “Miss Granger gave me the full account. I blame myself really, I should have insisted on closer supervision of your studies. Merlin knows if it weren’t for the Ministry coming apart at the seams, I would have taught you personally. It could have been much worse.”
“I don’t get it,” said Draco, partway through the film. “Why do they give this Bond fellow such specific gadgets?”
Draco smiled, Harry was better at seeing around corners than he gave him credit for.
The Malfoys had been loyal to the Dark Lord. They had always played their cards right. What had gone so wrong in this world that they hadn’t been able to protect themselves, much less be next to the Dark Lord on his ascent to power? He had always imagined some casualties, of course, but… nothing like this.
“As a matter of fact, I don’t owe you anything, either,” he sneered, turning away. “Consider this an official termination of our relationship.”
He knew he’d have to play into the bit sooner or later. The others would have surely found him missing this morning if Luna hadn’t gone and tattled last night.
“Senile old bat,” Draco muttered, huffing a dark laugh. Harry didn’t find it quite so funny.
“Blimey,” said George, eyes wide. “How do you do it?”
There was no response at his knock.
Fred sighed and vanished the glasses. “I don’t know how you handle it, Draco,” he said, addressing Draco so easily that he had to squint in the dim light to see if he recognised the man. “Waking up every day and seeing this beauty.”
Pansy sat gingerly in her place and took the empty whiskey glass out of Draco’s hand, replacing it with a full one. She cast a quick imperturbable charm around them and the music immediately dimmed.
“Calm down, Theo, we’ll all see each other over the holidays,” said Pansy. “I wouldn’t miss one of Narcissa’s New Year’s Eve parties for the world. Assuming it’s still on this year?”
“Luna’s right, if the diadem was designed to give insight, we’d be foolish not to use it,” said Harry. “And we already know the effects. It’s not dangerous.”
Harry wavered under the piercing brown gaze.
“Merlin, I forgot how fast they could run on those little legs,” laughed Draco.
At this, she turned around to face him. Her small hands trailed down the front of his shirt and gently untucked it. Uh oh, teasing Angelica was not the same as teasing Pansy.
“Why it’s Miss Granger and Mr Dursley! What brings you into the shop today?” he asked with an elfish grin, springing lightly down to the floor despite his old age and wagging a gnarled hand comically in Harry’s direction. “Don’t tell me you’ve gone and broken your wand again, have you? I should think not!”
Harry cracked a smile of relief; finally someone in this castle who was up for a little adventure.
The group had come to a stop in front of a homely looking Italian restaurant at the base of a muggle apartment complex. A man with a pencil-thin moustache and a small white apron was talking to Harry before sweeping inside. Harry motioned the rest of the gang to follow him.
“Oh?” said Hermione with a raised eyebrow and an unconvinced smirk as she opened a refrigerated case to grab a bag of frozen vegetables. “And what song would that be?”
As he entered the room, several heads immediately turned to look at him and conversation dimmed. Harry, the only one in Muggle clothes in a sea of black robes, was conspicuously out of place.
Ever since he’d seen the memory of the green flash with Draco, he’d been desperate to remember what he could about his parents. He could picture his mother’s face, he knew she was scared, but beyond that it was hazy. If anything, the fact that he couldn’t see the Thestral might mean there was nothing to remember after all. “I don’t know if I saw it. My parents died in a car crash.”
“What? No, Harry I—” Charlotte protested, her hand grasping the sleeve of his jumper.
“Sir?” Harry pressed, despite McGonagall looking like she was ready to interject. “Its brother?”
“What’s wrong with him?” asked Hermione, looking between Cedric and Draco.
“I don’t think he would have gone far, he’s probably just cooling off,” said Draco, summoning his Muggle jacket as well. “I can do a sweep of the neighbourhood and Kreacher can watch for him here—”
“Quite the exciting weekend,” said Lucius as Draco stumbled into the Potions dungeon ahead of Snape. Despite the freezing rain on the pitch, it somehow seemed colder down here.
“They’ve been on and off for ages now. Not that you would know, you spend half your waking hours in the library or wherever else it is you get off to.” said Blaise settling in among the cushions on the chaise. “Better make ourselves comfortable here then, hadn’t we? I’m not about to walk in on another instance of them practising the Wronski Feint.”
The two of them burst from a memory of Draco dropping snapping dragon beans from the roof of the Manor onto unsuspecting Gnomes in the garden below in peals of laughter.
“Don’t you start,” began Cedric.
Cedric looked more taken aback by this change in direction than if Malfoy had simply shoved him right back.
Minerva gazed back at the house, which stuck out in dark contrast to the starry night sky. The brickwork was angular and solid, the grass was neatly trimmed. She had thought it was an ugly, squat thing by day, but in the night there was perhaps something cosy about it. Maybe he did belong here? There were certainly worse places in the world to be.
“Not in my experience,” said Draco, turning to Harry and raising an eyebrow. “Give it a go, then.”
“Yes, that’s the one,” piped up Angelica before Draco could reply. “He’s just coming by floo, so he should be here any minute.”
“It belonged to the one we no longer speak of,” said Ollivander, lowering his voice. “He Who Must Not Be Named.”
“I wish I could have known him here.” Harry leaned back to rest his head on the trunk and gazed wistfully out of the window.
“Loathsome woman,” muttered Draco.
“And who is operating under an assumed identity, with the express intention of hiding his or her birth name?”
If the evidence from that night really was gone, he was struggling to hold on to any reasons not to attempt another reveal of the Fidelius, except for that his own mother’s life might be jeopardised if he couldn’t execute it flawlessly. No, it had to be done with certainty; it had to be one of the surefire ways to break the Fidelius.
“Not really,” he lied.
“Not always,” said Angelica, her expression softening. “Only when I have a message I need to deliver.”
Only now that he had it did he realise the Mark wasn’t a sign of power but a brand of ownership. He was no more than a servant. The least he could do would be to help the resistance even in some small way, and then hopefully – mercifully – disappear forever.
Harry rubbed at his eyes and placed his glasses back on his nose. The other two were facing him, but Harry’s eyes locked on the blond, who was smiling approvingly.
He tried to answer, thinking she’d be able to piece it together if she remembered the Dark Lord’s recently renewed interest in the Potter rumours, but instead let out a groan at the shooting pain behind his eyes. The charm was definitely keeping him from giving away too much, but even a sliver of information today could become clear tomorrow with more context.
“I had hoped you’d come to the same conclusion, but I see now I have no choice,” said McGonagall from behind him as he strained to push through the barrier.
“You think so?” said Luna, perking up. “Maybe I could try one of her spells and—”
Draco tried to remember Ginny Weasley. Explosive, stubborn, but certainly smart. What had happened between them, after all? This Gemma character was about as interesting as a flobberworm, so it couldn’t have been her. Could it?
“That was just a bit of fun,” said Angelica with a shrug. “You guys were making such a big deal out of him. I thought it’d be fun to see what he was like. He’s darling by the way.”
Draco wasn’t sure if this was a slight or a compliment, but he carried on with the conversation, “I was wondering if perhaps you might shed any light on a certain deal, which my mother mentioned in her note?”
“Amazing.”  Draco turned to face Harry with a lazy smile.  They shared a quick kiss before Harry shifted.
“Fuck, I need more moonstone,” I muttered to Pansy, quickly folding the parchment.  Pansy nodded and I walked towards the back of the room to the ingredients cabinet, passing by the trio’s table.  I stopped next to Harry and leaned over his cauldron.  It looked putrid, dark green and bubbling like bile.  The whole area smelled like a mix of rotten eggs, stale beer and popcorn.  I grimaced, trying not to add my own spew to the already horrible potion.
“What if they get away?”  I paced faster.
“You need to do something.  You look miserable anytime Potter’s in your sight.”  She paused and looked away for a moment. “I've seen the way he looks at you sometimes . . .”
“Yeah, yeah, I know.”  I looked up and watched Harry for a moment again.  My heart sank, knowing that might be one of the last smiles I’d see on his face in a while.  Despite the chatter and laughter filling the Great Hall, Dumbledore’s words from last night still hung in the air, a dark reminder of a new era we were too young for.  I heard whispers in the manor — plans of attack, plans against Hogwarts, against
“Yeah.”  He pulled away and moved to the door.  “Love you.”  I nodded as he left.  I stayed in the cupboard for a moment, my feet rooted where I stood.  I left a few minutes later to find Pansy walking down the corridor.  She rushed over when she saw me.
“Hey.”
“Pansy — think about what you’re saying.  Me, Draco Malfoy, the face and name of the Malfoy family at Hogwarts.  If I admit I’m anything but straight, my father will disown me, if not worse.”  Pansy groaned.  “Oh you know I’m right.  If I tell Potter and he doesn’t like it, then he could just turn around and tell the entire school—”
.  Pansy gently squeezed my free hand and gave me a small smile.
“Shut up, Malfoy,” said Hermione sharply.  I turned to look at Hermione, obviously as pissed as Harry was.
"What are you doing?"  He mumbled with a grin.
“Alright, alright!”  I laughed as he pushed me over, losing his balance and landing on top of me.
“Draco,”  Pansy stopped playing with my hair and I opened my eyes.  “You can’t go through the whole relationship living in fear.”
"Me too." The men shared a long smile, the band in the background being drowned out. Warmth flooded Draco's stomach, and as much as he wanted to blame the alcohol, he knew it was much more.
“Potter,”  I stated.
“Of course love.  I just wanted…”  Draco’s eyes travelled down Harry’s chest to his dark briefs.  “Just wanted to try something.”  He reached up, tugging the briefs down to Harry’s knees.  He stared for a moment — the dark hair from Harry’s navel trailed into a dark bush around his long hard-on.  Draco cautiously wrapped his hand around the base of Harry’s cock.
“Hey.”  He called out.
“Oh yes, my dear.”  Harry moved in for a sloppy kiss before moving again, angling his hips to hit the same spot again.  Draco groaned into Harry’s mouth and in a few minutes, their moans mingled in their mouths.  Their hips met in perfect rhythm, for a few minutes before Harry’s pleasure began to overwhelm him and his thrusts became sloppy.  Draco’s moans became high and frantic as Harry’s hand reached down for Draco’s cock and tugged fervidly.  Draco shuddered and threw his head back with a loud gasp, exploding across their chests.  Harry groaned from Draco tightening around him, thrusting quickly before grunting, his body stiffening.  His arm faltered and he fell next to Draco, half draped across him.  They laid there for a few minutes, breathing heavily.
“Okay, you know what?”  I pulled out my wand, ready to obliviate him.
“So, what is it you wanted to show me?”  He asked with a slight smirk.
“Will do!”  She drew the curtains around the bed and casted a silencing charm before I shouted a string of curses.  “Draco, a relationship is supposed to make you happy, not stressed out,” Pansy commented, patting her lap.  I shifted and laid my head in her lap.
“Fantastic,” Harry laughed.
"Yeah," He said over his shoulder.  "I'm good."  Draco placed his hands on the edge of the counter and took a deep breath.  Harry quietly walked up behind Draco.
“Yeah,” I muttered.  Pansy rubbed my shoulder for a few minutes.
Eventually, I decided to just go to Charms early.  The first class of the term was spent fumbling through an overview of the syllabus as well as a long speech pertaining to our future careers, O.W.L.s and eventually N.E.W.T.s.  I let my mind wander through most of the period, thankful to finally have free thoughts again…  A few times Pansy kicked me under the table to keep me from falling asleep.
“Yes,” Harry nearly whispered.  Draco lifted his eyes to see Harry’s face dark and heated.  Draco slowly moved his hand up and down Harry’s cock, not breaking eye contact until Harry dropped his head back with a soft sigh.  Draco moved his hand a bit faster, bracing himself against Harry’s hip with his other.  The deep sounds rising out of Harry’s throat turned Draco on more than he could imagine.  Harry’s musky scent intoxicated Draco and it wasn’t long before Harry’s hand was in his hair.
“I know.  I know, I want to, but how?”  I laughed and threw my hands in the air.  Pansy shook her head and started pacing, ignoring my ranting.  “Potter doesn’t trust me, hell he probably thinks I’m a terrible person.  Not like I’ve given him any other impression…” I groaned. “Pansy, there’s no way I can tell him.”
“I just can’t sit here idly while Voldemort regains his power and strength and let everyone else do nothing!  That’s what he wants!  He wants everyone else to be powerless and weak so he can attack us at—”
“Yeah, they didn’t want me to get out of the house.  Last year I ran out after accidentally blowing up my other aunt like a balloon.  The Knight Bus picked me up, and I stayed at the Leaky Cauldron until school started.  This year the Weasley’s took me to the World Cup, which you already know.”
“Let’s go.”
Harry paused a moment as his eyes graze Draco’s abdomen, gut sinking at the sight of the long, jagged scars.  He slowly raised his hand to trace a long one, starting at Draco’s left hip and reaching his right collarbone.  Draco’s breathing slowed at the gentle touch.
“I repeat, as long as you have studied the theory hard enough —”
“I do.  It’s just… he’s my father…” My voice broke.  The tears spilt over onto my cheeks.
"Decided to change it up a bit,"  He chuckled.
“Goodnight Dray.  Love you.”  I nodded.  I pulled away and took his arm again, dragging him the rest of the way to the tower.
“Good.  ‘Cause you’re not getting rid of me anytime soon,” I muttered.
Harry never returned.  The room emptied silently when the bell rang.
“Peter Pettigrew.  He tied me to a grave and brought out this massive cauldron and started this potion.  He put this… bloody being in first, then a bone from the grave I was on, then his own hand before slicing my arm to add my blood.”  Harry clutched his right arm, covered by a long-sleeve shirt much too warm for the current weather.  I shuddered as I watched him.  “The potion reacted and now… now…”  He closed his eyes and swallowed hard.
"This is my couch!"
“Good idea.”  We stand up and head back towards the vine curtain.  “Oh, by the way, if you ever want to come here for an escape or whatever, just start at the tallest oak on the outside of the forest, and follow the red vines in.”  He nodded and smiled with pity.
“I’ve got you,” Harry kept repeating until a soft moan rose from Draco’s parted lips.  Harry lifted himself up to look Draco in the eye.  He paced himself slowly, taking in every breathy moan Draco made.  Draco’s claves slid around Harry’s back, pulling him close.  Harry groaned and couldn’t help but move faster until Draco gasped suddenly, eyes flying open and chest heaving.  Harry stopped and smirked at the incredibly flustered blond.
“Of course.”  Pansy entwined our fingers as we left the Common Room.  The castle felt much more alive than when we left it in July — a soft murmur could be heard throughout and the ending summer left the air warm.  I felt a rush at the realisation I wouldn’t have to eat with the Dark Lord for a few more months.  I sat down with Pansy, feeling my shoulders relax as I took a plateful of food.  The Great Hall was noisy with chatter and laughter as the heads of the houses handed out schedules.  Snape unceremoniously dropped a parchment on my plate.
“Shove off Malfoy.”  He wrenched his arm from my grip and raised a brow.  “I’m perfectly capable of walking myself.”  I scoffed and grabbed his arm again, this time much closer to his hand.  A small smile flickered on his lips.
“— and he hit Goyle — look —”  Snape examined Goyle, whose face now resembled something that would have been at home in a book on poisonous fungi.
“It is NOT a lie!” said Harry. “I saw him, I fought him!”
“Man,” Goyle started.  “The Dark Lord must be off the walls that no one believes Po—”
When we arrived at the Common Room, I kissed Pansy's head, much to Blaise's dislike, and headed up to my room.  After I changed, Blaise barged in and slammed the door.
“Well now, your teaching in this subject has been rather disrupted and fragmented, hasn’t it?  The constant changing of teachers, many of whom do not seem to have followed any Ministry-approved curriculum, has unfortunately resulted in your being far below the standard we would expect to see in your O.W.L. year.  You will be pleased to know, however, that these problems are now to be rectified. We will be following a carefully structured, theory centred, Ministry-approved course of defensive magic this year.  Copy down the following, please.”
“It does seem like that.”  I smiled at him.  It was nice getting to know this side of him, beyond the fame and numerous near-death experiences.  He seemed much more human now.
?” A quiet screech was heard across the room; several students looked away or flinched.  I clenched my jaw and drew a quick breath.  Professor Umbridge, however, did not flinch.  She was staring at Harry with a grimly satisfied expression on her face.
“I’ll leave you to sleep then.”  With that and a quiet
“Say it was meant for me and you dropped it somewhere.”  She closed the polish and watched me.
Harry stepped out onto the stage, clad in ripped jeans, an All Time Low t-shirt, his now grown out hair left undone in the messy curls it was known for in his school years, and the pansexual flag tied like a cape around his neck.  The stage smelled like beer and cheap vodka, and the coloured lights were hot against his face.   He always loved this moment — the initial adrenaline rush of stepping on stage, the crowd cheering, even if they didn't know who he was, the way the light blinded him, leaving him alone on the stage with his bandmates.
“Ah yes, then so it shall be.”  I put the goblet back down.  She squeezed my hand.
“You.”  He shoved a finger in my face.  “You know I like Pansy!”  He chuckled slightly, still glaring at me.  “Hell, I might as well be in love with her!”  I rolled my eyes as he turned away.
I kept turning my gaze to the Gryffindor table every few minutes.  Harry was engaging in a heated discussion with Hermione, Weasel, and Nearly-Headless Nick.  He looked up as I did, meeting my eyes for a split second.  I couldn’t read them like I used to be able to.  I prayed it was just the time.
“How was detention?”  Harry looked worse than during dinner.  His hair was a wreck and matted against the back of his neck.  His glasses and tie were both crooked and his robes hung off of him haphazardly.
“Look,”  Potter crossed his arms.  “If you don’t have anything important to tell me—”
“Yes, father.” I stood quickly and left the drawing-room. As I returned to my room, I tried to expel every thought of Harry that passed through my mind. That Dementor attack was no accident. Surely the Ministry knew that. Or it was a setup. Harry was smart enough to not cast a Patronus in front of a Muggle. He knows better than to break wizarding law, even if he is the Golden Boy. He wouldn’t cast it if there weren’t a good reason.
I couldn’t sleep that night. Anxious anticipation filled me as the year approached. I couldn’t wait to see Harry, hopeful to make up for the last time we spoke. Despite it only being two months, it felt like years since I saw him. I felt I had aged years with Voldemort constantly breathing down my neck. The weight of my coming allegiance drained most of my life from me. Despite having no great love for Hogwarts, I rejoiced at the reprieve from Voldemort. Despite only being fifteen, I feared that we were no longer kids. Voldemort made certain of that the moment he duelled Harry —
“Thanks,”  He sighed contentedly, nuzzling his head into my chest.
“And Potter did get what he deserved,” Crabbe joined in.  I scoffed as Blaise and Goyle nodded in agreement.
"Two chicken kebabs, two sides of salted chips and two cokes."
“Well, if it weren’t our new Prefects!”  Blaise stood up and clapped my shoulder.  Crabbe and Goyle both nodded to us before turning back to their conversation.  “They’ve been acting strange since I saw them on the platform.  All whispery and secretive.”  Blaise shook his head.
“So, are you excited?”  Pansy squealed as she sat down next to me at breakfast.  I rolled my eyes.
“You know what?  Nevermind,” I spat, turning back to stare out at the lake.
,”  I muttered, running my hands through his hair.  This was supposed to be just a nice meeting, hugging, kissing, hand-holding, water watching, and five minutes into it Harry’s pissed and I’m left alone.
“I’m sorry.”  I choked out as I stared out at the water.  The sun was setting, and a slight wind was picking up.
“How was school? You weren’t close with the Diggory boy were you?”
“Look.”  Pansy elbowed me in the side again.
.”  I smirked even more and grabbed his arm, throwing open the door.  “Get out of that closet.”  I swiftly pulled him out.  He stumbled slightly and shot me a dark glare.  “I’m walking you back to Gryffindor tower to make sure you don’t wander off.”
“You love me.”
kind.” He smiled even more maliciously before quickly turning and stalking away.
“Do you want help or not?”  I pointed my wand at his glasses.  He glared at me as he held out his hand.
“Mmm, no,” Draco hummed.  Harry placed a callused hand on his cheek and pulled him in.  “Not — one — bit,” Draco mumbled between the soft kisses.  Harry’s lips were salty from the popcorn he’d been eating throughout the movie, a hint of sweetness from the Coke.  Draco sighed softly as Harry swept his tongue across his bottom lip, the scruff on Harry’s chin rough on Draco’s skin.  Harry couldn’t help but smile at the hint of chocolate still on Draco’s lips.
"Let me do your hair at least," She pleaded.
.” The contents of Harry’s potion vanished; he was left standing foolishly beside an empty cauldron. “Those of you who have managed to read the instructions, fill one flagon with a sample of your potion, label it clearly with your name, and bring it up to my desk for testing,” said Snape.  “Homework: twelve inches of parchment on the properties of moonstone and its uses in potion-making, to be handed in on Thursday.”  Pansy and I began cleaning up and sampling our potion.  Harry darted out of the room as soon as the bell rang.
"Potter? Who the hell is Potter?" Jasper laughed loudly, grabbing the extra shot Harry had ordered. Harry glared at Draco, praying that he would just go along with it.
Mangy mutt.  I’m surprised he’s been able to hide from the Ministry for so long.”
“Thank you, father.” For once, we looked like a normal, happy family — two parents beaming at their son who has just been given a great honour. As if the Dark Lord wasn’t inhabiting our West Wing.
“He didn’t need to run his mouth like that,” I snapped before moving towards the door.
“Yeah, come on Draco!” Crabbe chimed in.   “We’ve all heard our parents talking this summer—”
“How the hell—”
“What do you think of Draco? We won’t have to worry about Mudbloods anymore,” Crabbe laughed. Pansy tightened her grip on my hand.
“Well, well, well, if it isn’t Weasel and Granger,” I sneered.  Hermione rolled her eyes while Weasel seemed to prepare himself for a fight.
“It’s completely okay, Draco,” He insisted.  I nodded, still looking at the water.  Harry’s other hand found my chin and turned my face to his.  “Hey, look at me.”  I raised my eyes to meet his, sparkling in the twilight.  “I don’t want you to ever feel like you have to lie to me to make me happy.  You make me happy regardless.”  He smiled a beautiful, soft smile that lit a fire in my stomach.
“Okay.”  He leaned up for another kiss.
I’d go home each night after our meetings cursing myself for my cowardness, Pansy giving me a pitiful gaze as I moped by.
“I’m fine on my own, Malfoy,”  He sneered. He stood up, brushed off his clothes and tried to balance his broken glasses on his face.  He cursed when he realised they were pretty smashed up.
“Huh?”
I returned to the dungeons with a pit in my stomach and ever aching dull throbbing in my head.
Harry covered the shopping, but Draco enjoyed tagging along and picking up random things off the shelves to throw in the carriage when Harry wasn't paying attention.  Draco also began joining Harry on his weekend walks through the park, admiring how the man was so content just walking and humming to himself.  Harry tried every weekend to get Draco to go out to the pubs with him, and every time Draco would complain about there being too many people but would agree after Harry promised not to leave him.  They'd go to a few local bars and sometimes a club, before stumbling for a late-night chippys and eventually collapsing in a fit of giggles on their couches.  They'd wake up with headaches and Draco would groan theatrically as Harry would make his famous hangover cure.
"Here?  On the street?"
“I know.”  He leaned in for another kiss.  I smiled against his lips.  “By the way,” He mumbled, pulling away again.  “Did you mean anything by what you said when you were leaving yesterday?”  I cocked my head and tried to keep my eyes from widening too much.
The weeks leading up to the third task we were unable to meet as often due to the upcoming exam period.  Most professors wanted to do mock O.W.L.s to prepare us, although most students were more focused on the upcoming task and the results of the tournament.  Snape remained as intolerable as ever, Hermione as frazzled as ever and Harry as stressed as ever.  When we were able to meet, it was brief and tense.  I didn’t tell him about my birthday since he had much bigger things to worry about and I didn’t want him to waste any money or time on it.  Pansy remembered regardless and got me a new book and my parents sent a box of sweets as well.
"Your livers gonna give out one of these days," Mason muttered, earning him a good shove from Jasper.
“Always when I’m looking at you.”  He pressed a kiss on Draco’s chest before reaching for his trousers again.  “Is this okay?” Harry asked softly, tugging at the belt loops.  Draco felt himself melt at the raspiness in Harry’s voice and eagerly lifted his hips.  Harry fumbled with the button, struggling to get it open before he dropped his head with a laugh.  “Merlin.”  He yanked on the button and tugged the trousers down a bit, exposing Draco’s pants and a small wet patch.  Draco chuckled and reached for Harry’s trousers, undoing the button swiftly and pulling them down.  Harry kicked off the trousers, tossing them somewhere on the floor.  Draco squirmed out of his, dropping them at Harry’s feet.
“Don’t be ridiculous, Harry, you can’t go,” said Hermione, wedging herself under Draco’s arm and hoisting him to his feet. “Luna, run ahead and tell Madam Pomfrey we’re coming. Say Malfoy and I got into a row.”
“Really?” said Draco, a look of fondness spreading over his features at the sheer ridiculousness. “Leave it to Loony to stumble across treasure people have spent their lives looking for and then put it on her daft head.”
Harry stood up abruptly and grabbed Draco by the elbow, casting a furtive glance through the windows of the club.
With that, the creature took a few jolting steps forward, and before Harry knew it, they were off. The small, pale shape of Luna quickly became a distant dot as the powerful wings of the creature overtook the air around them, and all he could do was hold on to its neck for dear life. He watched the castle until it was obscured by clouds and prayed to god this thing knew where it was flying.
“—spending the last few hours in Dumbledore’s shoes, I can’t believe it was one man who kept it all going,” said McGonagall in a wavering voice. “The Wizengamot is in a panic. I hardly have any idea what to tell the students, much less the parents.”
“Sounds far-fetched,” said Draco. “Don’t forget, I’ve been in your mind. I didn’t see you conjuring worlds in those little black boxes.”
The Dark Lord aimed his wand at Draco and a pain like a razor blade shot down his arm as a layer of skin was stripped away. Voldemort cast the Dark Mark spell again on the raw patch of skin and Draco cried out.
, tossing it on the coffee table near Harry.
“Just when I thought this school couldn’t get any weirder,” said Harry. “No, definitely not. We’ll have to make do with whatever Basilisk venom we can find I guess. Have you found any other Horcruxes?”
“Slytherin takes possession,” called the announcer.
“I’ll be on my best behaviour,” he said, and she nodded curtly and led him in.
“What for?” asked Hermione.
As he revealed just how close his family was to the Dark Lord, their concerned expressions fell into ones of utter disappointment. He told them everything; how the Malfoys were harbouring Voldemort at Wisteria Hall, that his father was the guardian of the final Horcrux, and that Draco had only recently decided to shed his ties to the old way.
“You’re the one who only picks underdogs to win,” said a faint yet sarcastic voice. Harry’s eyes snapped to Draco’s face as his eyelids fluttered open and he said, “It’s your own fault.”
He started racking his brain for a memory of Cedric, and then, like remembering a dream, it all came back to him. The Triwizard tournament, the Portkey, a thin, high voice that said
Draco held his mother’s gaze for a moment until, suddenly, she dissolved into silent tears.
Lucius lowered his silverware and stared evenly at Draco, betraying no hint of emotion.
He passed into a cavernous space that must have been a sitting room before it was enlarged to become the personal quarters of Lord Voldemort. Tall arched windows that faced the black grounds glistened in the low light, reflecting Harry as he passed by. Where there had recently been a long table, there was now only open space, flanked by masked Death Eaters who clustered around the walls.
“You know how my parents can be. I’m sure they’ve scheduled my time home from the moment I arrive,” said Draco easily, picking up the paper he was reading and turning it deliberately to the next page.
As he passed out of the foyer into a cavernous parlour, the room echoed with stillness. He was often alone in the massive home as a child and he remembered it as a quiet, if not somewhat foreboding, place.
“I was thinking it might be nice to go on a date first Hogsmeade weekend. You know, spend the afternoon at Madame Puddifoot’s. That sort of thing?” said Pansy, batting her lashes so feverishly that Draco had to wonder if she had a bug in her eye.
“Gunpowder was where we got our start. Old Pierre DuPont emigrated from France in the early 1800s and used a background in alchemy to sell products to muggles. Thank you.” He handed the waiter a cash tip, at which she looked thoroughly startled. “The family has a long line of gifted alchemists, and after the war they switched tact to pharmaceuticals. You know, healing potions and the like at first.”
“Looks like they’re petrified,” said Luna, inspecting a rook.
“He’s gone, it’s over,” said Harry. “I’m in control. We’ll wait for the others, we’ll figure out a plan.”
“Well, yes,” said Hermione, looking like she was at odds with whether she’d rather take the credit for Harry’s progress, or admit to missing any potentially dangerous behaviour.
. “Anything in here?” he asked.
Meanwhile, Angelica and Harry seemed to have buddied up. She could be seen rambling on about something or other while Harry looked on and nodded, smiling and commenting every so often. As much as Draco wanted alone time with Edgar, he also didn’t want Angelica cosying up to his rival. If push came to shove, he wasn’t sure how attractive a future with him looked compared with what was certainly a life of fame and financial stability on Harry’s arm.
“Okay,” said Harry quizzically, tossing the book to the side and turning to face him.
“Afraid of what?” Draco asked, urgently.
“She’s not always so comfortable on a first meeting,” said Harry, holding her close to his shirt pocket which she slithered into.
“What did I say?” asked Harry, his hand crushing the cover of the bedspread nervously.
“Could be Hufflepuff,” he said, taking a bite of bread. “You’re mental and you’ve got a serious temper, but you’re a damn hard worker I’ll give you that much.”
“Love it? She could have written it,” said Draco, tugging at a wire that had popped loose.
The kiss itself was nice, strawberry scented and delicate, but he couldn’t shake the feeling that there was something missing. It was unclear how much time passed before Charlotte pulled away rosy-cheeked, and kicked off on her bicycle in the direction of the train station.
Instead of responding, Draco scooted over on the bed, taking the far pillow, as Harry padded over, lying down next to him.
“Right,” said Harry, straightening up to address the room as yet another student came through the fireplace. “I want to thank you all for joining our cause. I don’t really know what to expect, but I feel I should warn you all, it’s going to be dangerous. These are dark wizards, and the fact that we’re young won’t stop them from doing what they have to to fend us off. Even using Unforgivable Curses.”
And he wasn’t the only one that was acting out of character — From the moment the curtain had been pulled away, it was like Gemma had transformed into an entirely different person. She was practically dripping off of Harry’s shoulder as they made their way to the booth, swinging her hips as she walked. She smiled a toothy smile and laughed loudly, shouting greetings across the drone of the music. When she spotted a scantily clad witch in magenta, they simultaneously shrieked and did a sort of funny high heeled run towards each other, air kissing cheeks in greeting.
Within this hurricane of emotion, the memory of the last few hours played like a loop in his mind. Not for the first time in his life, he wondered if there was anyone he could really trust or if he would just be a gullible fool forever.
“Angelica’s father offered me a job actually,” said Draco, not sure why he was continuing on this line of conversation, if only to prove to Harry that DuPont had thought him capable of the task.
Draco felt an immediate sense of distaste at the name, however he knew the Lestrange estate had some value and his father would have leveraged the familial connection. It was moot now, at any rate. Lestrange had died due to complications from the Dementor’s kiss a few years back.
“But why keep that a secret?” challenged Hermione. “If you were going to go to the extent of stealing the pass with so-called honourable intentions, why not share this critical piece of information with us sooner?”
“There now. Isn’t it much easier when we all play nicely?” she said, looking down at McGonagall. “The recipient of this wand will be so pleased.”
“Meaning I’m about to demonstrate a very great amount of trust in you,” said Draco. “Can I trust you, Potter?”
“Curse breaking is not as simple as a flick of the wrist, surely the brethren know that,” Borgin stammered, but at Draco’s scowl, he quickly leaned back over the ring and directed a few spells in its direction. “But, but yes, let me see if a revealing charm would… no, that’s not it.”
Great rivulets were now flowing into Hagrid’s beard. “I’ll do anything that needs doing,” he said resolutely, bursting into a fresh wave of tears.
He followed her to the bed, plastering on a smile.
Harry looked up at Draco, beaming.
“Oh, that’s from my programming class,” said Harry, recognising the gift from Mr Salerni he’d packed. “You can borrow it if you like. Computer science is a lot like spell casting, you might find it interesting.”
“But we have an advantage,” said Cedric. “We’ve gotten some clues we never would have got here. Maybe we can see more – go back into the vision of the diadem now that we know what else we need to look for.”
“At any rate, I only came by to talk about tutoring,” said Hermione, turning back to Draco. “Can I speak with you in the hallway?”
As the others reminisced, Harry couldn’t help but feel a little disappointed at the realisation of how much he hadn’t gotten to experience in the last six years at Hogwarts. Things would have been different if only Petunia had given him the letter. By the time everyone rose to leave, Harry felt a pang of sadness for an upbringing he’d never gotten to experience.
“I think Ravenclaw,” said Luna. “Some of the best experimental wizards were from my house.”
“What am I looking at, sir?” asked Draco, watching footsteps move across the map with small name tags attached. He glanced at the 7th floor corridor, but there was nothing there except the old caretaker’s cat, Mrs Norris.
“Wait a minute—” said Pansy.
But she was certainly a hell of a lot sharper than he’d given her credit for. He’d have to watch his back for sure, but the news she’d revealed didn’t deter him. He’d be glad to have a partner who was knowledgeable and could back him on the dealings with the Collective.
The plan was straightforward, if not a little ludicrous.
“About time you showed up,” said Malfoy, his eyes flicking up to the pair as they entered. “I’m going by your timetable, you know.”
“Good to see you haven’t lost your touch,” covered Draco. He wasn’t about to let that on to Borgin. “Tell me what you know of it.”
“I’ll let you break the news then,” said Draco with an eye roll.
“I mean what an idiot,” said Draco at last. “He spends half of his life fighting against the wizard he ultimately succumbed to in the end. Was he a rebel or a follower?”
Harry jammed his glasses on his nose and snatched his wand off the end table, turning to the door and reassuring himself that more likely than not, Laverne’s mysterious one-sided discussion could be chalked up to the old painting’s usual ploys for conversation. Though at the sound of muffled voices in the next room and the howl of October wind at the castle window, his hand reflexively tightened.
Harry’s brow furrowed. He’d expected that the other four would all be avoiding each other after their rift the other night. Of course he wanted things to blow over, but not without him.
Draco took a seat in the spare armchair, feeling a flicker of pride for his contribution to the group despite the battle that was raging inside him.
“Is it time to go already?” asked Snape, furrowing his brow in puzzlement. He blinked slowly over a glassy stare.
In Hermione’s vision she was also not at Hogwarts, but taking her Muggle A-Levels at Queens College in London. She knew little about the magical world other than that it existed and that she once considered pursuing a magical education. However, even in Muggle London, the evidence of Voldemort’s rise was apparent. The existence of the magical world had burst through, with dark wizards having taken over by sheer force and disbanding parliament and other Muggle centres of power. The world was torn between whether to believe and whether to act, though it seemed that no matter what the Muggles attempted, they were no match for Voldemort’s followers.
He replayed the memory over in his mind, exactly what he wanted to tell Harry to soften the blow. But when he entered Sirius’s room and Harry looked up from his arm chair, breaking into a smile as soon as he laid eyes on Draco, he knew he was in trouble.
“I don’t think you really believe that,” she said finally.
!” down the length of the room, but it sputtered and the last few sparks fell to the floor only a short distance away. That was no good, he literally just had it. Harry felt a pang of irritation at the unpredictable wand.
“Yeah, if you’ve got time to kill I could use your help on this,” said Theo, looking uncertainly between two piles of blue-green and green-blue algae, before picking one and tossing it in.
“Young Master Malfoy, what a pleasant surprise,” said Borgin, rubbing his hands together. Even standing, he had an unnatural hunch at the top of his back, making him look like a vulture perched over the carcass of the pocket watch. “How’s your father? I hear great things are happening, you know. I keep my eye on the signs.”
The hand on his scar faltered. “I knew exactly what he was,” said Petunia, her tone growing icy. “And my sister – a witch. Meddling in unnatural things, fighting with
“No, I want to know,” said Harry, taking a step closer to the portrait. So close that he could see the tassels painted on the edge of Al’s purple hat, and thought how much better the tweed had suited him. “What did you think would happen when you finally sent for me?”
“Am I supposed to answer that?” Harry asked, stomach squirming.
Malfoy looks at his cuticles while Harry stares openly at the open V of his shirt. Malfoy's pulse quickens, visible at his exposed throat.
"That's impossible, though." He swatted a hand between them. "Everyone has secrets. Even right now, how many more secrets would you say that you have from me?"
Draco grinned. "Towards the island of Lesbos. Long story short, I'm her beard-for-hire when it comes to family events."
Harry looked around, not sure what to do. Leaving was always an option, but he didn't want to leave Malfoy like this. It would be cruel to leave him to ugly-cry in the Ministry of Magic, when he owed him—what, exactly, he wasn't sure, but he knew he had to at least protect him from those who would do him more harm.
strange, his lack of new friendships conspicuous. She gave him a little wave, and he waved back and realized they’d never spoken outside of the classroom.
But no. He'd made the moving, impassioned speech that people had come to expect of him. He'd left faces in the audience glistening with tears and was now often quoted at other graduation ceremonies across the globe.
You dose him under the tongue with droplets that burn like 90 proof and follow with the same for yourself. It's mellow, the come up nice and easy. You rock yourself hard in his lap, fumble with zippers and throw your shirt absently over a lamp, and he's under you, brown skin and black hair and a winking hole, elbows hooked under his knees.
Draco panted as Harry licked his bottom lip and stayed kneeling, waiting for Draco's hands to grip his face and firmly wipe the strings of spunk from his skin with swipes of his thumbs.
"Well, good," Malfoy said, rubbing at a sore spot at the back of his neck, "because I don't enjoy this trip down memory lane any more than you do. I'm not stupid, Potter. I know better now." He sighed. "Hell, I knew better then, but it was safer to pretend."
"Well, not fine," Harry grudgingly admitted. He usually stopped after
“Need a hand in there?”
"I mean what I say, and the words I use are the words we use now, Kreacher. You know that." The two stared at one another until Kreacher cast his eyes to the ground, his lips moving quickly, but the words he whispered were so quiet that neither of his human companions could hear the diatribe. "This party means a lot to Harry and me. It's in my honour, in celebration of, my, um—" Draco looked to Harry again and then Kreacher did too, the looks on both their faces expectant, though Draco's telegraphed that he wasn't sure which lie to run with to get his point across.
, or,
Blaise rolled his eyes, the only person who probably rivalled Draco in how haughty he could make the gesture. "I think you left your body at some point."
Draco pulled the shirt over Harry's head, but as he moved in to nuzzle at his throat again, he slowed. Harry's kept his hands on Draco's back, but where seconds ago he'd held on tight, he let them go slack.
"No—she never really cared for Lucius' politics. She's been sucked in with age, as time goes on and she lost contact with her own people. She used to have friends." He looked wistfully at his plate, and Harry was afraid that he was about to do something extravagant, but he straightened up and continued eating normally. "I've been thinking about what she said a lot. She told me to be careful because to find a worthy partner would be difficult enough. And that no one can love what they don't understand, and few would understand what the Mark meant to me."
"This was when the...problems started for me. Drugs to feel something close to happy, drinking to dull the feelings that weren't. I was angry with my situation and so sick of existing that I tried to spend as much time as close to unconscious or euphoric as I could get. If I died, so be it, but I mean, you never really think you're going to die when you're young."
"I accept payment in compliments and Galleons; I'm not fussy about which. How's your drink?"
"I can't hold your hand?" Harry said with a pout, asking with as much mock sincerity as he could muster. Draco froze before the mask dropped back into place.
It was obvious that Hermione and Ron spoke to hide the voices of the adults in the room behind them from filtering into Harry's ears.
The extended Weasley clan was spread across three rooms—the studious were in the kitchen, watching over the washing and drying charms, laughing over shared mugs of mead that Bill had brought with him, while Molly and the older generation of Weasleys and Prewetts still sat around the kitchen table, sneaking one more bite of gingerbread cake onto their dessert plates, Arthur pouring one more tipple of Firewhisky into the assorted glasses on the tabletop; and the younger set had retired to the sitting room, children at play with all manner of assorted Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes under the heavily-lidded eyes of their parents, the childless at play with their own games—sneaking out for puffs of gillyweed-tinged rolled spliffs, taking up and abandoning card games on a whim. Harry hadn't realized he'd been staring at Neville and Ginny tucked together on the couch, an enchanted map of Europe spread across their laps as they charted their dream vacation for next summer—the gift he'd gotten them, after their conversation in Flourish & Blotts those months ago—and he was struck by a loneliness so deep that he thought he might start crying right there, where he sat.
Harry stilled, holding a pebble of purplish-grey between his finger and thumb.
But Draco wasn't listening anymore. He burned brightly, running on this fuel.
“Extra cold, extra crispy. Just the way you like it.” Harry tried to keep a positive tint to his voice.
He didn’t care if it was selfish—this was time for brooding. Harry huffed and stared in silence at the explosions of flowers in the plots around them.
"Since when?" Harry asked. He wanted to be sure that the feeling in his gut was right about this. Draco didn't look at him but also didn't stop the touching.
Draco raises an eyebrow, finishing the zip and button and crossing his legs.
Harry wondered if his heart beat as fast as his own, to talk like this.
Draco smiled wanly.
"I'm going to have to cut a deal with him," Harry said. He could see the situation clearly, then. "If he's to keep mum about Draco, he's going to ask for some sort of deal. I know it."
"This is going to be good," Pansy purred, sitting up from the prone position she'd taken when her dose of mushrooms came over her. She had bits of twigs in her bob; Parvati was kind enough to spell them free for her, though also tipsy enough that she ended up pulling them out roughly, causing a series of surprised yelps.
"Positive," Harry said, smiling. "I just really wanted to. But that's all—for now."
"Nah," he shook his head. It was odd because of course he wanted to be under the scorching water, to be wherever Draco was, especially naked, but Draco hadn't told him to
His lips trembled, not with a forgotten word, but one he didn't wish to speak.
"I want that too. But you want more than that," Draco answered him. Harry opened his mouth, shut it again. He did. He felt guilt that he knew was misplaced. Felt like he'd done something wrong. He hadn't meant for all this to happen, he knew it wasn't his fault.
"I'll never get used to this, as long as I live," Draco said, settling back on his haunches for a second's breath.
The exchange brought a smile to Harry's cheek, and for an hour, he played pretend. He picked at noodles slippery with red sauce and bread laden with butter, ate enough that neither of them prodded him to try for a little more, and it was only when it came time to pay and Harry dug out his wallet and noticed where the corner of it had scuffed in his fall that reality set back in.
They quickly became friends and formed a cover band.  At first, they sucked, as just about every cover band does at first.  But then, something clicked — they found their sound and even began writing their own songs.  Cole wrote lyrics and played the bass, Jasper wrote the music on his guitar, Mason banged around on the drums, and Harry just poured himself into the lyrics. Harry decided to try his hand at writing a couple of times on sleepless nights but found most of his lyrics were too influenced by magic and the war. He did keep a couple of songs he wrote, ones vague enough a wizard would get but wouldn't sound out of place among Muggles.  Not long after that, their band began picking up steam.  They needed a name, and Harry being, well, Harry, wanted to make a reference to the wizarding world.  Mudblood would have fit their vibe, but he couldn't fathom naming a band a slur, especially one now scarring his best friend's arm.  Then he thought about spells—
Over the ringing in his ears, Harry could hear footsteps on the stairs. He turned, blinded with hope, only to see Hermione clambering into view.
The boy had raven hair, untidy but falling in soft shapes across his forehead. He sat with his knees pulled up and bare feet resting on the bench, wearing a dark, fitted Muggle trouser and slouchy jumper. He rested his chin in his hand, looking lost in thought, dark eyebrows knit together behind delicate round framed glasses. In profile, Draco saw a straight nose and square jaw for a moment before Harry turned to look at them.
Charlotte seized once as if struck by lightning but did not cry out.
“Like take over the wizarding world against their will.”
Today, as Draco approached the cracking blue fire, he was neither fearful nor arrogant, but apprehensive. He’d wait for Voldemort to play his cards before he gave anything away. It was that, or accept certain death.
As he withdrew his hand, a long silver blade emerged, embedded with rubies that glittered wildly in the crimson and gold room.
Draco was so busy trying to find another excuse to spend time with Harry after the defence session that he nearly forgot that he had promised to take Pansy on a date over the first Hogsmeade weekend.
“That was it,” Harry whispered. “That was the memory we’ve been looking for. The green flash.”
He held Harry while Minerva took one last lingering glance at the sleeping face, dark eyelashes splayed out across rosy cheeks. The only evidence of his encounter with He Who Must Not Be Named was the jagged scar across his soft forehead.
Harry pulled back, taking a breath and a small step away. His green eyes still shockingly close and bright in the low light of the balcony.
“Who would have thought I’d live to see the day that Draco Malfoy listens to Muggle glam rock.” Hermione laughed and bumped into Draco with her shoulder as she pushed the trolley along.
, Draco urged.
Whether Cedric had intended the lesson to end up this way or not, Harry, Luna, and Hermione were treated to an impressive show of blocked hexes and dodged jinxes, which the girls started commentating on like some mad tennis match.
“I would have thought it was obvious,” said Draco, rising to lean against the apothecary cabinet Snape was sorting. “From what my father has said on the matter, it seems there is nothing more valuable to our Lord than knowledge of Potter’s existence except, perhaps, knowledge of how to destroy him.”
“Alright, here’s what we’ll do,” said Harry, rising. “I need to get to Wisteria Hall.”
“That’s what you keep reminding me,” said Tonks with a crooked grin. Then she punched him hard on the arm. “Don’t listen to me, I’m getting sentimental in my old age. I just don’t know what I’d do if anything happened to you! It’s just the two of us ever since they took mum…”
“Who told you that?” Hermione asked suspiciously. The girl didn’t know how to hold her cards, but as someone with a vested interest in seeing the Fidelius broken, he was keen to hear whether Luna had really found out about their secret occupant on the seventh floor.
Draco withdrew from the Pensieve, a chill spreading through his chest.
“This was his,” said Harry, coming to kneel in front of a roughly hewn chest at the end of the bed. “McGonagall said he wanted me to have this. Maybe he had plans to tell me something and just didn’t get the chance.”
“Now, you’ve gone and broken your wand, have you, Mr Dursley?” said Ollivander as he levitated a few slender boxes to the desk. Harry nodded sheepishly, certain this must be one of the worst offences a wizard could make. “And what was your last wand made of?”
on the top of the stack.
This was his Draco, he told himself as a comfortable feeling of familiarity settled around him. He was nothing like the cold Draco from the vision, in long black robes with his blonde hair slicked back, pointing a wand at him and uttering an Unforgivable Curse.
Draco felt rough hands grab him underneath the arms and prop him up on his knees facing the armchair as Voldemort took a seat like a king returning to his throne.
Draco’s glass fell from his hand and smashed on the ground as Voldemort bored into his thoughts. He could hear his own strangled voice crying out in pain as the Dark Lord searched for his memory of the letter to his mother. He attempted to Occlude, but as soon as the Dark Lord felt it, he shattered Draco’s defences and pressed in farther.
“No, no, there’s no need for that,” said Ollivander, waving a hand at McGonagall. “I’m convinced I can find a proper match. We clearly need something with a bendy quality, and unicorn hair is quite wrong, quite wrong indeed…”
“It’s this new wand. It does what it bloody well wants,” groaned Harry. “Maybe it’s broken.”
James and Lily? Dead.
Cedric’s vision was slightly more peaceful, but not by much. He and his girlfriend Cho, were living abroad in South America, far from the UK and the turmoil in the wizarding world. However, even on the other side of the globe, there was evidence of unrest. He and Cho were desperately trying to find a Portkey route to get back home after the news of a massive explosion in Scotland that had been attributed to the ever-growing ranks of Death Eaters. Even in the southern hemisphere, dark wizards were taking up the call to pledge loyalty to Voldemort, and soon nowhere would be safe.
“This doesn’t mean I've forgiven you, you know.”
“What? That’s far too advanced. And besides, that’s not even on your reading list. Where did you get that?”
The most interesting item on the shelf had been an action figure which, after leaving the memory of nicking it off his cousin in a heist-like fashion, Harry was shocked to hear Draco did not recognise. He had proceeded to show Draco a memory of several episodes of an animated TV program, which Draco was forced to admit were captivating. What was there not to like about a millionaire playboy masquerading as a bat in the name of vigilante justice?
But Malfoy was looking at him in a funny way. “Much better,” he said finally.
Harry and Draco shared a glance – He knew they’d have to tell the others sooner or later his suspicions about where the final Horcrux was.
“That sounds dangerous,” said Luna, breaking the silence. “Even for someone seasoned in experimental magic, there’s not a lot that would be worth the cost of breaking your soul.”
“Harry!” called Luna, bounding over to the couch, the tassels of her fringed leather jacket flapping around her. “Did you see everything? What were the rebels planning?”
“I’d really rather keep the pace up,” said Harry. He didn’t want to seem like he was siding with Malfoy after all the time Hermione was putting into his education, but there seemed to be only one person in this room who could teach him the mind reading abilities that could unlock the memories about his parents.
“Yes, but we don’t know where the real one went. Voldemort could already have it in his possession,” said Draco.
“The most important thing is that this validates exactly what we were planning,” said Harry, forcefully replacing any hint of sadness with a look of determination. “We already knew we needed to defeat Voldemort, and not only has Al told us it’s possible, he’s given us the tools to do it.”
“That’s absolutely right,” said DuPont, nodding approvingly.
“So that’s where they were going,” muttered Draco, making a mental note to leave a sock out for him.
Draco and Harry wheeled around to see McGonagall, gliding swiftly across the room, hurling locking spells to all the cabinets that lined the walls and sending books and spindly silver instruments flying into drawers and cupboards.
Harry’s foot fell through a gap in the staircase and before he knew it, they had both toppled over with a clatter.
She extended the deck in his direction, allowing him to turn over the final card. He laid the third card down next to the others to reveal an image of two figures facing each other, holding chalices. The symbol of the caduceus, a snake wrapped around a staff, twined between them.
“Gee thanks, professor,” said Draco, pushing back from the desk. “Knew I could count on you.”
Pansy scoffed in disgust. “Why are you being this way? This isn’t like you at all,” she said, but Draco just lengthened his strides to get away from her faster. He couldn’t stand to upset Pansy anymore, not when soon enough she’d know what he’d done.
“Meaning?” asked Harry, with a quizzical look.
“I think you better stay,” Harry blurted out. “Until he gets here, that is. I don’t know any healing magic.”
The afternoon would have been uneventful except for two things. The first was the almost overwhelming sense of loss that Minerva felt as she played the news of Lily and James’s deaths over and over in her mind, coupled with dread at the thought of what political turmoil was going on in her own world at this very moment, and what other lives might be lost before this thing saw its end.
As he made his way toward the main stairs, Lucius put a thin hand on his shoulder.
“Cedric!” screamed Hermione, running towards him. “Merlin, what’s wrong?”
Blaise held his gaze for a moment before cracking into a smile and coming around to flop down on a chaise nearby, kicking his feet up onto the arm of the sofa. “Mate, I’ve become a master at sneaking these days. You have to be when you’re secretly hooking up with little miss perfect.”
Draco fixed Harry with an incredulous stare. “Seriously? You can’t still find that interesting.”
“Lucky me.”
As the memory faded and Draco found himself back in Sirius’s room, he could barely meet Harry’s gaze.
“Glad we could clear that one up quickly. Remember the last time you stopped calling me Tonks? I think it was when I turned up to your Quidditch match with green hair and a snake tongue,” she smacked the table and laughed at this.
“Ugh! I’m having just the best time. I love you guys so much,” said Angelica, bouncing in place. “Hopefully, we’ll be able to see each other again soon. Otherwise, I’m sure we’ll see you all at our wedding next year!”
“Who’s that?” interrupted Charlotte as they turned onto the open-air platform. Harry followed her line of sight down to the flickering dark end of the track, which was empty but for two hulking figures in black robes.
Narcissa guided a small trowel in a circle around the Bowtruckle sprout, and reached her hands into the warm earth to cup the roots and lift it out, placing him in Draco’s outstretched hands. The memory flickered, worn through in parts like an old record, as he dutifully carried the small creature across to the base of the old birch tree nearby and Narcissa helped him plant it, smiling and chattering and not caring a lick that her diamond rings were caked in mud. It was when she looked most beautiful, Draco thought.
“Very well.” McGonagall straightened up in her chair. “I am the Secret Keeper of a crucial Fidelius Charm. One that has potential ramifications for the wizarding community at large. You have been identified as best positioned to instruct a special student who has come into the care of Hogwarts as of late last night when the original charm, held by Headmaster Dumbledore, was broken.”
Draco didn’t know what to say. His heart was pounding. If it was possible, he wanted him more today than he had even wanted him then.
said Harry. There was no movement within the terrarium.
He crept up to his room, surprised to find that it was more or less how he’d left it. His bed was made, his books sat unmoved on his shelf, even his school work was spread out on the desk, as if someone were waiting for him to return. He ran his hands across the old maths notes absently, sad to think that he’d be letting down the one teacher that had really believed in him and wondering what Salerni would assume happened to him in the end.
“I should say not!” said Ollivander, turning back to Harry. “No, Mr Dursley’s magic is quite unique. Are you sure I can’t convince you to come around to Diagon Alley for a proper fitting?”
He gripped the broom handle tightly and kicked off, reliving the memory of the final Quidditch match of the season last year. Slytherin versus Ravenclaw. The teams had been neck and neck going into the final and the tension in the stands was palpable. Draco remembered every feint, every Bludger hit, as vividly as if it had just happened earlier that afternoon. As he sailed through the game, he could feel Harry’s mind reeling and smiled inwardly to himself. Nothing beat flying, and he knew Harry had realised that as well.
“Maybe I can help. What are you trying to say?”
“Good job he dodged that one!” said Hermione as Cedric dived out of the way of a yellow streak of light. “Full Body-Bind!”
“Mother?” he called, as he took off his heavy outer cloak and draped it over a chair in the entryway. “Has someone been keeping an eye on the roses out front? They look dreadful.”
With everything he needed, Harry was ready to say goodbye to this place for good. He was closing the bedroom door quietly behind him when a shuffling in the hall caught his attention and he whipped around to spot the timid form of Aunt Petunia in the dark hallway, curlers in her hair, her expression a mixture of concern and loathing.
Harry looked around at the sheets of parchment that surrounded the marble coffee table where the group sat clustered together. It had been difficult to get Hermione and Cedric back onside after the events of the afternoon, but once Harry had laid out the plan he and Draco had devised, it was agreed that a tentative truce was best for all involved, if only to bring them over the finish line.
As the days turned into weeks, Draco felt with an increasing sense of urgency that their time was running out. If what his mother had said about Azkaban was true, they wouldn’t have much more time to sit around and think things through. Their window to strike while the Dark Lord’s defences were thin was closing.
“It’s ok, we still have more than half and that’s definitely something,” said Hermione, scratching off her list.
Harry tried his best to remain stoic during this diatribe, but he was only bluffing with Al’s name. He had no idea what his old friend thought of the Dark Lord. Moreover, Voldemort wasn’t wrong that Al had supported Harry only so long as he was doing what Al designed, and had flipped on him when he’d chosen his own path.
“Professor?” Harry said.
Harry found himself in a hazy room with a mobile overhead. Snippets of memory, the warm hands of his father, the calming lullaby of his mother, overlapped like fuzzy patches on an old film reel.
“Me too,” said Hermione. “Obviously. Someone has to be the brains of this operation after all, and Merlin knows you boys wouldn’t have gotten half this far without some female ingenuity.”
“Hungry?” he asked on the way out the door.
Draco turned slowly back to the group, realising that he was being addressed directly. He found himself staring at an overly eager Theo, a sly-looking Pansy, and a suspicious Blaise.
!” said Harry as he slashed the air and a bright jet of red light shot from the end of his wand down the length of the room like a flare gun. The slashing definitely helped the wand release sparks, but there was something about having Malfoy next to him that seemed to positively impact his magic as well.
“I don’t know if anything you do entirely with your feet can be called beautiful,” said Draco, evenly. He enjoyed watching Harry get riled up about silly Muggle things.
“Your father wants to expand DuPont Industries into Europe, but there’s more to the company than meets the eye. He needs someone who’s in good standing in society to be the public face of the pharmaceutical and alchemical branches, but also connected to the right underground network for the weapons trade. And someone who’s willing to either buy in or turn a blind eye to the whole thing wouldn’t hurt. He knows he can restore my position in society with our match and the placement at the company, and he knows he can apply pressure to me through the broken deal with my father. Together, you and I take the company into the next generation. Does that about cover it?”
He was resigned to his solitude when surprisingly, on the third night, Harry returned.
The second noteworthy thing that afternoon was a ferocious argument she had witnessed on the steps of number four, when a scrawny-looking woman and a red-faced man about five times her size had lost their minds with rage at a television repairman, who had struggled to fix the babbling contraption in their sitting room. She kept her eyes on this couple all day and was convinced that they were the worst sort of Muggle imaginable.
At a gentle knock on the door, Harry was expecting to see the familiar bushy cloud of hair, but it was McGonagall who glided in looking morose.
He had already determined, possibly since the moment on the golf course when he was cornered by DuPont, that he would take his father’s place on the deal. Reneging at this point would be reputational suicide, DuPont would make sure of it. Whereas taking the deal would unlock everything he had been working for. There was only one choice.
“I understand your concerns,” said McGonagall. “Once we discover how Miss Lovegood accessed the room, we shall simply adjust the room’s logic to protect against it.”
Looking to the staff table he made brief eye contact with Snape, who since their last encounter had been twice as awake in Potions classes but ten times nastier. The Headmaster’s chair was, of course, empty.
“You’re mistaken,” said Draco, moving his arm away. “I love my father.”
“Compassionate, as always,” said Snape, in a bemused monotone. Draco let go of a tenseness that he hadn’t realised he was holding.
“Albus, you can’t really still be thinking of leaving him here!” Minerva burst out, leaping to her feet. But Dumbledore’s expression was stoic.
“Luna? Certainly not,” said Draco, crossing one leg and leaning on the arm of his chair to watch Harry fiddle with the infernal mess. “She’s bloody brilliant. I wish I had known sooner or I would have put her to work for me. With the right training she could be striking fear into the hearts of anyone who believes in the Sight.”
“I know, mother, and I am eternally grateful,” said Draco, tucking a stray lock of blonde hair behind her ear. “But do you ever wonder what life would have been like if you’d chosen another path?”
Draco let out a heartless laugh. “You wouldn’t understand.”
“Nott and Harper at it again?” asked Blaise, wiggling his eyebrows for dramatic effect.
“Merlin forbid,” said Harry with an eye roll. “Besides, I know I’d never hear the end of it if I tried to shortchange you on our bet.”
“Good grief, are you alright? It sounded like a bomb went off in here,” she said, running into the room.
“Is it a happy holiday for Muggles?” asked Luna with a wistful smile, as she Transfigured her robes into a striped dress covered in pockets. “That’s beautiful. Many say that Samhain is the gateway to the darker half of the year.”
“Just your average pure-blood aristocrat,” said Hermione with an eye roll. “He’s the only child of an ancient wizarding family, and his father is practically nobility. It doesn’t surprise me one bit that the first thing he’d do with someone else’s memories is treat them as his playthings.”
“Have you thought at all about your reading?” she asked, turning her eyes back to him.
“Spit it out, Snape.” Draco jumped to his feet, leaning over the desk as well, but his intimidation tactics did nothing to quell the hysterics.
Potter was the enemy! Not to mention a boy who was wanted by the highest power in the land. His days were numbered at best, with nothing but a ragtag group of misfits to keep him safe.
Hermione turned away in a cloud of curly hair as they pushed into the Transfigurations classroom. McGonagall was seated at her desk across from someone in Auror robes. If it wasn’t the old winner of the Triwizard Tournament of ‘95 himself, thought Draco with annoyance as Cedric Diggory turned to glance at them. Draco had hoped his days crossing Diggory’s path had ended when Hufflepuff beat Slytherin in the last game of Draco’s fourth year. It was a grudge he was not quick to forget.
“I resent that I know what you’re talking about,” said Draco with a smirk.
“See you, Harry,” he said lightly, smiling a terrible smile that Harry couldn’t help but love.
“Voldemort,” he whispered, and felt a smile curl on his face.
Draco opened his mouth to respond when a voice came from the corridor above them.
The bard cocked an eyebrow at Draco, looking incredibly cocky for someone who had just delivered a horrible line of poetry. He blinked expectantly, clearly awaiting praise.
“Actually there’s something I’ve been meaning to talk to you about,” said Draco, his hands tensing on the arms of the chair as Harry smiled eagerly at him. “Or show you, rather.”
Voldemort turned his red eyes on Wormtail, who started stuttering. “W-well yes, b-b-but I have on good authority that this map is genuine. Besides which, our own Lord is positive of the boy’s existence, aren’t you m-my Lord?”
This seemed to meet Voldemort’s expectations somewhat. He nodded and said, “Draco, Draco, Draco. Someday you will know the extent of where my followers lie. You are right, of course, that it takes years to get the proper network in place. Though I think it would shock you to know how deep my web already runs.”
“But it’s reversed, so I’m guessing this means the opposite of that. Strained family relationships, bad investments, that sort of thing.”
“If you keep that up, you are going to make me extremely jealous,” teased Draco, leaning down to kiss Angelica.
“Ah yes. I never feel quite so at home as when I am in this very chair,” said Voldemort, His face crinkling unnaturally into a smiling shape. “How is my favourite pupil?”
But before he could ask, the door opened at the far end of the dining room and Wormtail shuffled in.
A half-giant returns to Hogwarts and has a lot to catch up on.
If his father suspected him, that was one thing, but if the Dark Lord did, he could rip Draco’s mind to shreds and still not find anything. But his father hadn’t alluded to anything yet. Maybe his involvement had been obscured. He’d play the gambit just a bit farther and see.
“Can you do anything about the scar?”
Draco knew the look. Several Death Eaters had resorted to numbing potions after returning unsuccessfully to the Manor more than once.
Making sure the coast was clear and putting up a light barrier charm, Luna pulled a bag out of her pocket marked
He tactfully avoided the subject of a certain dark figure who came to reside at the Manor from the time Draco was 12 years old. Occupying the old library on the first floor, permeating the house with a general sense of fear and dread and turning his mother into a permanent statue of a human. Instead, focusing on the trials and tribulations of an early life of privileged isolation.
Draco held his breath, warily stepping into the room. He glanced at Harry, who glared back at him. Sighing, he turned to summon a chair, and went to sit by Harry’s beside. No stinging jinxes were forthcoming, which Draco took as a good sign.
“That he was resurrected by Quirrell and that he lives today, protected by his followers. As Dumbledore tried to make known,” said Draco, pretending to be preoccupied with refilling the glass of alihotsy and peppermint. “And Potter’s got the mad notion that our Lord has a weakness. But that’s ridiculous, right? No one can defeat—”
“Spoken like a man who can’t accept his fate,” said Harry, stepping around the fire that danced dangerously on the relics as the fabric of the backpack burned away.
“Does vanished mean something different in your world?” asked Harry, holding onto a photo from the bottom of the pile of a particularly grisly murder scene. Hermione’s hands flew to her mouth as the others fell silent.
“Yeah, I remember, I just didn’t realise you brought them here with you.”
“Stay back!” yelled Harry, brandishing his wand and pointing it at the two men. “I’m warning you.”
“I want to leave,” he said.
Harry sighed, shifting further under the covers. His mind was filled with the everyday dilemmas of schoolchildren, who never failed to approach him with their myriad and oddly frightening accidents.
“The trouble is in almost all cases of accidental magic, subjects cured themselves by the time they reached adolescence, due to a combination of matured emotional and magical control,” continued Hermione. “I also looked into wandless magic, but that seems like even more of a stretch since you’ve never been properly educated on spellwork, much less handled a wand. Even strong wizards can only stretch wandless magic so far – Apparition seems unlikely.”
“Oh, I thought this was just pretence,” said Luna. “We really ought to be going if you want to leave while everyone is still at the feast.”
“Look, I came because Angelica owled me and I had nothing else on today,” said Harry frankly.
Harry turned to the books scattered around, flipping through the pages, not even sure what he was looking for but certain he had to do something.
“More importantly, how is it possible that no one knew of Voldemort before he was too powerful to be stopped? Someone had to train him, someone must recognise him. He has red eyes for crying out loud,” said Harry, tossing aside another book that didn’t even bother alluding to the inciting events of the wizarding war.
“Hi,” said Gemma in a weak, breathy voice. She glanced over at the group with half-lidded eyes looking entirely unimpressed and then turned to look distractedly out into the foyer, as though trying to spot a more interesting group to sit with.
“Abraxas got it in his head that this guy would succeed where others, like Grindelwald, had failed. And if there’s one thing the Malfoys are good at above all else, it’s strategic alliances.” At this, he tapped his nose and gave Draco a knowing look. Draco sputtered, but DuPont carried on.
“The Cruciatus Curse,” said Draco, feeling physically ill at the thought of it. Disgusted with himself that there had been a time he had been able to perform it. “It’s an Unforgivable Curse that causes unbearable pain. The Dark Lord uses it as a test of sorts for those that are seeking to join the ranks of the Death Eaters because it’s not like casting a regular spell – you have to mean it. You have to want to inflict pain.”
“Oh yeah?”
“Just have a song stuck in my head,” said Draco.
“He’s doing reasonably well, given the circumstances,” said Hermione’s voice. “He’s got a foothold on a couple charms and seems to absorb magical theory quickly. And anything he reads once he practically memorises on the spot, so History of Magic has been a breeze.”
“The Hog’s Head Inn,” called Cedric, before disappearing in an eruption of green flames.
“Obviously,” said Draco with a smirk.
“Not sure what you’re worried about,” drawled Malfoy over by the sofas. “It could only be an improvement.”
The others looked nervously at each other in the wake of this news. Even Malfoy looked drained and panicked as he met Harry’s gaze.
“Thanks,” said Harry, but Draco’s eyes darted to his parchment, where he was detailing the notes of his part in the plan. “And I am. It’s scrappy, sure, but that means they won’t be expecting it. No one is expecting a group of teenagers to do anything, let alone save the world.”
Longbottom had been rather out of sorts lately, but no more so than one might rightly expect of him during NEWT year, as evidenced by the fact that most other students ignored the kerfuffle, including the two girls in front of Draco. He cast his eavesdropping charm.
“If you enjoy going gradually deaf while spending a million galleons on cocktails.”
More importantly, Draco had to understand what this meant for Harry. If Draco was going to unlock the secrets of the trunk, he would certainly need Harry’s help. Besides which, Harry looked like he had just been punched in the gut. The desire to control the contents of the trunk faded away momentarily, just long enough for Draco to consider what Harry would need as he processed the letter.
“Then explain,” said Harry. Unbidden, a flicker of anger welled up inside him.
“No, it was real!” Luna insisted. “I knew things – remembered things – that I would have no way of knowing here. It was like the diadem was showing me an alternate timeline. One where the second war had already started years ago. And Harry, you were there! You were famous. Everyone in the wizarding world knew you’d survived, and you were leading the fight.”
Draco glanced at Pansy, following close at his heels. If he didn’t do her the same favour, she may very well follow him to her own destruction. And Draco cared about her far too much to allow that.
“Surely with so many loyal followers to pick from, and several who could have offered him a home as nice as the Manor, he had to have a reason for coming to us first.”
He turned to Tonks and said in a low voice, “These are Muggles.”
As the students milled about anxiously, waiting for things to begin, Hermione, Cedric, and Luna prepared to see Harry off.
“Definitely not. It’s a rare gift in fact. The founder of the Slytherin House could speak Parseltongue, hence the snake motif. It tends to accompany very powerful magic,” Draco said this flippantly, but Harry thought he could detect an undertone of seriousness.
in my direction, and I’ll meet your spell and guide you into my memory,” Draco said, positioning Harry across from him, and practising the wand movement a few times. Harry, for his part, seemed earnest, but also apprehensive. Like he didn’t want to hurt Draco.
“You two!” called Angelica’s father from across the course. Draco took a rapid step away from her and held her by the shoulder at arm’s length, but Mr DuPont hadn’t seemed to notice anything untoward. “You’re up, princess!”
“Well, pretty much where we left them I would imagine,” said Hermione. “Though if you want to hear your girlfriend’s voice, I’d be happy for you to turn on the wireless, if that’s what you’re getting at.”
“Yes! Excellent! Realism is critical when one is creating one’s masterwork. Much obliged good sir, much obliged,” said the bard, pulling a feather out of his hat and jotting notes down on a piece of parchment. “Keep your ears open, lad! Music is everywhere.”
“Don’t I know it,” said Harry, still chuckling. Malfoy was a twat, but he sure didn’t sugarcoat things, which was fine by Harry. “They didn’t even win.”
Draco paused for a minute and let the words sink in. Pansy’s stare faded from reprimanding to comforting. “I’m worried you’re about to make a choice you’ll regret.”
The old wandmaker’s face crinkled into a grin. “The wand always chooses the wizard, my boy.”
When the door burst open, Harry wheeled around expecting to see a familiar cloud of Hermione’s bushy hair, but it was Draco, looking completely winded and dripping wet in his green and black Quidditch uniform. Harry’s heart gave an uncomfortable lurch.
"C'mon." Draco gently took it and let Harry lead them into the crowd. Their hearts beat to the beat of the music as Harry turned around to face Draco. Draco noted how his dancing had greatly improved since their fourth year, now that Harry had actually gained a sense of rhythm. He didn't let go of Draco's hand, instead pulling him close as the bodies pressed in around them. A dazed smiled covered Harry's face that made Draco nearly melt. They gravitated towards each other as the music faded from their focus. Before either knew it, their lips met, and everything stopped for a moment.
“Sounds… complicated,” Pansy finally said.  I chuckled.
“Oh yeah?”  I could see Harry nearly trembling in his seat.  The anger was pouring off of him, seeping into Weasel, whose ears were now turning a bright red.
“What do you want, Malfoy?”  He asked impatiently.  I swallowed.  “I'm not really in the mood for any of your antics.”
That night was long and quiet.  The castle was silent before the year came to an end the next day.  I spent the night staring at the ceiling as I had for weeks now.
“Already, huh?”  She glared at me and stood up.
“Thank you, Headmaster, for those kind words of welcome,” She simpered.  “Well, it is lovely to be back at Hogwarts, I must say!  And to see such happy little faces looking back at me!”  I glanced around.  No one looked happy; rather, everyone held a face between anger, amusement and confusion.  I am very much looking forward to getting to know you all, and I’m sure we’ll be very good friends!”  She cleared her throat again and I felt a deep seed of discontent settle in my stomach.
“Draco Malfoy, I swear if you say I’m in love with Hermione one more time, I
“Merlin, Draco,” Harry mumbled, looking over Draco again.  He couldn’t take his eyes off Draco’s porcelain form, looking positively delicious in the soft golden light.  Harry gently spread Draco’s legs, gently massaging his thighs to calm the now tensing Draco.  “It’ll be okay, I promise.”  Harry smiled.  Draco nodded and watched Harry’s careful movements.  Harry took out a bottle of lube from his bedside table and Draco snorted.
“Prostate,” Harry chuckled.
“Malfoy got Hermione!”  Ron whined.  “Look!”  He forced Granger to show Snape her teeth.  He looked coldly at her.
No part of the house was safe in fact. The Dark Lord’s presence seeped into every nook and crevasse of the house; every chair felt like stone and every bed like a cot; despite the many fireplaces throughout the house, every room remained freezing and dimly lit. The heart that once filled the great manor was slowly dying with each day. It took its toll on my mother. Despite keeping her head high and back straight, I could see the strain on her body. Her eyes were dark, covered skillfully with makeup, and tired, lacking the loving shine I grew up with. My father was stiffer, more agitated than I’d ever seen him. My mother and I were often dismissed from the dinner table, leaving him alone with the Dark Lord. The time spent alone with him seemed to be draining my father.
“Not that I’m not proud to be with you, but—”
"Just, knock or wake me up,"  He paused, gazing into Draco's eyes.  He never noticed the flecks of blue that danced around the pupil.  "Draco."  He added softly.  Draco smiled and turned to walk away, feeling Harry's fingers slip off his wrist and brush past his own fingers.
“Worried,” He answered for me.  I sighed and nodded.
“Yes, Professor Umbridge,” I muttered along with the rest of the class.
“Draco—”  I pushed past Pansy.
One day during a training session, Draco took a particularly bad hit to the head while duelling and Harry had to take him home.
“Us?”  I asked softly.
“Very good. Are you trained in the Dark Arts?” Voldemort’s serpent voice sent a shiver down my spine that I did my best to repress.
“Are you sure?”  My voice shook slightly.  Harry’s hand dropped from my arm to my hand, giving me a gentle squeeze.
“Harry, I know that, but you have to choose which battles are worth it.”  Harry was practically shaking.
“No need to call me ma’am dear.”
She was wrong. It didn’t get easier. Eating next to the Dark Lord would never get easier. Dinners never got less tense; every so often, Voldemort attempted conversation, asking sneakily personal questions. The snake, constantly at our feet, acted as though it could sense fear. My parents functioned in stiff formalities, likely under the same assertion that Voldemort had ears throughout the house. I locked myself in my room most days, opting to stare out the window, stare at the ceiling or stare at the pages of a book I couldn’t focus on. I wished I could contact Harry or even Hermione. He was back with that terrible muggle family for the summer. They probably didn’t even know who Voldemort was, or that Harry was nearly killed multiple times this year, or that he watched one of his friends die. He couldn’t owl Weasel or Hermione. He was alone.
“Well, Miss Granger, I think the course aims are perfectly clear if you read them through carefully,” said Professor Umbridge in a voice of determined sweetness.
“Why would I tell you that I like you if I didn’t know you’d respond embarrassingly?”  I tried to reason.  If I can just get him to believe me then maybe...  “And how would I even know that you would react in that way?  Besides, wouldn’t this be more embarrassing for me, especially if this got out?”  He stared at me for a moment, his eyes slitted.
“For how long?” I whispered.  I almost didn’t want to speak out of fear of ruining the perfect moment — Harry’s head resting on my chest, our bodies pressed together, legs tangled and my chin resting on his mop of hair.  The sun was beginning to set later now and we were able to enjoy the sunsets together.  The distant scent of flowers beginning to bloom danced through the air.
"We had some shots, danced, met a couple of blokes.  One of them was pretty into you I'd say,"  Harry chuckled.  Draco blushed and drank the rest of the water.
We were just a couple of kids at the time,
“Are you wearing my trousers?” I asked.  She looked up with an innocent smile and mischievous glint in her eye.  She was wearing
"Right, sorry,"  He muttered, wiping his hand on his trousers.  Harry took the two boxes.
“Nope, come on.”  I pulled him down the corridor and he stifled a laugh.  We shared small glances as we made our way to the Gryffindor tower.  A few times I considered pulling us into an alcove to get a few more minutes alone together.  Yet, we kept going until Harry stopped just before turning down the corridor with the tower.
“We can stand to be a few minutes late, right?”  I unwrapped her arms from my neck.  She paused, listening to the hall before nodding.
"How do you know the song so well?" He eventually murmured during a pause in the song.
"Sure."  Harry sat on one end of the couch and Draco laid down, laying his head on Harry's lap.  Harry softly ran his course fingers through Draco's silky hair.  He had kept the same cut he had in school but was more lenient with his gel usage now.  Instead, he let his hair part in the middle and frame his face delicately.  Harry thought it made his sharp features look softer and gave him a boyish charm he lacked during the war.
But out loud he croaked, "Thank you," as Draco twined his fingers into his hair and tugged, and the ball of pleasure and want that lived low in his belly and in his cock lit up, and Harry knew that he was exactly where he was meant to be, doing exactly what he was meant to do. Sweat broke out across his back—he wanted for Draco to hold him there by his hair for days, forever.
"Your thoughts sound relieved," Draco said into Harry's lips. His eyelashes brushed Harry’s cheek, one of his favourite feelings. He pulled away, and Harry pretended that it was reluctantly, that it wasn’t just his signal to Harry that he should too, to open his eyes back to reality.
Draco's moan would have made Myrtle proud. Harry bit his cheek to keep from continuing his observations aloud and put on his glasses. He strode over to the window, using the long plastic stick attached to the blackout curtains to pull them back, revealing the tangerine and cherry blossom pink glow expanding at the edge of the skyline. The room was freezing cold with air-conditioning, and the mustiness of the sealed space irked him. He had to get
"I think you'll find you can, and almost certainly are," Draco said.
"Oh fuck, oh fuck, Potter," Draco groaned loudly now, no longer able to help himself. Harry pushed up his shirt once more as he gasped, "I'm coming, I'm coming—" and his hips jerked as come begun to spout from the angry red tip of his cock, hitting first above his navel and then painting stripes on his abdomen, dripping down over the amber brown of Harry's fingers that kept tugging him through the convulsions.
Draco’s still heart. Lifeless and on display in a sea of purple and red and stringy white.
"What would you like?" Harry asked. Draco looked to his hands,
"I smiled," he said. Harry wanted to be there. Could see him in his mind’s eye. But he couldn’t drop this, not now. He was needed by more than one person, today. And Draco was strong. He
Draco blinks again and the forever blackness grows sharp, builds right-angled corners and fills them with possibilities. The space has edges now, and it’s shrunk tightly around him. A room. His quickening breaths fill it with sound. It’s a room he’s been in before, so when he unfurls from his crouched position he’s careful to keep his chin tucked into his chest. Otherwise, he’d bump his head on the ceiling and wake with a goose egg.
"I don't think you do. He offered you up to me. Said we could share you, like you were some, some
Harry shook his head in wonder. “They’ve honestly got to improve early education for you pureblood types. How do you not know about dinosaurs?”
Harry turned to leave and noticed that Molly had hardly touched her dessert, a full anise pod visible in the wide beige expanse of pudding in her bowl, and he worried that he'd turned her stomach. The urge to cry rose up so suddenly that he took a hard right turn as soon as he walked out of the dining area, directly into the toilet and closed the door as quickly as he could without slamming it. He stood and stared at himself in the mirror, heaving breaths and praying for his throat to loosen up so he could
"Oi! Don't go fucking spiralling already." Ron's voice snapped Harry back to the present, just as Luna and Pansy joined them in the room, both of them emitting happy cooing noises to find sweets available.
Draco scrunched up his face, focused on the stones. "You know, I've told so many people this so many times in my mind, and I never said it aloud because I didn't think it was. Enough. I've always kept it in because—what's a kiss, really? Haven't I always been silly to let this haunt me?"
"Oh sure, it's just the one today," Draco grumbled, "and then the next day, and the next, and give it a couple of weeks, and I'll be needing a pin, and where will I be, then?" Harry commenced brushing his teeth and dribbled a considerable amount of foam down his chin, his smile irrepressible at Draco's seemingly never-ending diatribe. "I'll tell you where I'll be, I'll be out of anything worth using, that's what. My hair grows abnormally quickly, it'll be back before you know it, and that in-between phase—
It was the question he didn't have a clear answer to, and it was going to drive him insane, he thought, as he put distance between them by walking the length of the hallway down to the guest room, practising his breath. Draco took the kettle off the heat, and the flat descended again into silence. Harry looked into the guest room, as neat as he remembered it, and then into the study, the desk unusually bare. When the tinkling of spoons on plates came from the kitchen, he took a deep breath and returned to the kitchen. He made a pact with himself not to raise his voice, not to give in to the urges of rage. It was no use getting angry, and he'd be an idiot to think that fighting was going to resolve their issues.
fucked Harry's throat in a way that could be called gentle, though the muscles in Harry’s jaw strained to the point that he whimpered to keep it open.
"Well, it's basically becoming the face of the company, and I don't play Quidditch professionally, you know? Who am I to endorse brooms? And I'm shite at events. Honestly, they may as well get Krum up there for all I'm good at public speaking."
easily, but could be hidden from view—"Like a private garden," she said, with a knowing twinkle in her eyes—and she took it from there. He'd been kept preoccupied with the tasks she sent him on—choosing between this or that oak, and stains for the frames for future artworks that would hang on Grimmauld's walls, or needing to touch the fabric on the bolt at the warehouse across town, because these were the linens he'd been setting his table with for years to come. It was good to be busy, and G had kept him exactly that until Sunday came, a day of rest for the entire crew working on "the Grim Project," as they called it, a name that Kreacher for some reason found delightful, smiling eerily whenever someone said it. Now that the crew wasn't around and G hadn't any errands left to send him on, Harry found himself under his invisibility cloak and stomping his feet against the cold because he hadn't anything to do for two hours before dinner, and he just needed to see Draco. That was it, to see him, and he could be off.
"What do you call this colour?" Harry continued to eye the ceiling with just one eye open, allowing the other to take a much-deserved nap.
"Are you asking me to eat with you?" Harry questioned as he summoned his glasses and t-shirt. Draco watched him dress, eyes unabashedly glued to his chest and stomach.
He spluttered the word, "Malfoy," before giving in to a coughing fit. Malfoy, for one, didn't look impressed, barely able to keep his eyes from rolling back in his head, his mouth a tight line.
The problem with Draco-as-Cissy in a little handkerchief of a dress, stockings and garters borrowed from Alex, red-bottomed high heels he made a special trip home to collect, and with his hair charmed several extra inches longer so that Pansy could give it a blunt, asymmetrical bob, was that he was exactly as distressingly, lip-bitingly, excruciatingly hot feminine as he was masculine.
But Harry saw the chance of death for both of them. The fire was the magical variety and once it learned of them it would seal their fate in seconds. So he nodded, thinking that if they were to go, Draco ought to know. Harry owed him that.
"Fuck," Harry breathed.
"That's good for you two," Hermione raised an eyebrow and made a sound, scraping the dregs of cream from her bowl.
He returned to bed and set the charm for Harry's sight with a nonchalant flick of his wand.
“Ron really liked his peasant—peh—gift.”
Harry rolled his eyes, let him get all of three steps before he waved a hand, stopping him short with a
"When my boyfriend fucks me, he makes the most delicious sounds. Be loud. Let it all go," he ground out, slamming his hips up again and again. In this way, he pulled ragged breaths and moaning without end from Cissy's body until she was indeed bouncing on Harry's prick, skin loudly slapping. Harry’s toes bunched up with the effort of pushing his feet into the floor, fucking up into her until she screamed. It was a sound that couldn't be hidden even by rain and wind and thunder, and the primal nature of it cut the string of whatever was holding Harry on this side of his orgasm as he came suddenly, grip tightening on Cissy's body as he held her still.
