“How about we shower here, separately,” Harry said firmly, nose scrunching amused at Draco’s groan of annoyance, “and meet at the lifts. We can go to that ridiculously hipster pub you like.”
“This will not be full-on legilimency,” Draco read off, looking up at Harry as he noticed his shoulders relaxing, “there should still be mentally privacy between the partners. There are also included incantations for extending and instantly ending the link that both parties can use at any time.”
“Fuck me,” Draco groaned, not even bothering to lower his voice. Harry’s laugh echoed in the small conference room.
not realizing he had sent that through the link. An odd discomfort took root in his gut at the idea of sending things through without being able to control it.
Draco breathed into Harry, fucking his tongue into his mouth every so often as they moved against each other, their rhythm falling away as they both were lost in desperation, grinding close.
Draco spun them around, Harry’s back hitting the wall, and nudging his thigh between Harry’s legs as he bit down into the muscle between Harry’s neck and shoulder, the other man moaning as he rutted against Draco.
Harry cleared his throat, “Well, I am going to try to find the trolley.” He turned his gaze directly to Draco, trying to make his intention clear, “Anyone interested in tagging along?”
“Don’t just want a treat for tonight.” Harry said softly, summoning his bravery and keeping his eyes on Draco’s.
The knock at the compartment door startled them both, Harry calling out a soft, 'just a moment' as they checked each other over for anything too obvious before turning and sliding open the door.
A few years later, he had thought that Harry was pleased when Ron had made his first choice as Head Auror to partner them up, telling them they worked well together—something Draco actually agreed with him on, thinking he and Harry were even friends by that point.
“No need to sound so offended, we’ve been partners for over 6 years, you plunker.” Draco sniffed jokingly as he entered the lift behind Harry, adding, “I wish we could have tested the wandlessly activated body armour, but we were already on the Wilkinson case and I definitely wouldn’t have wanted to field test it when it was so new, you know?”
The recruits paired up and immediately started dueling warm-ups, obviously well trained and prepared to go through the modules on their own.
They settled in quickly, joking amongst each other about other trips they had taken on this very train, a few of their other friends popping in and out of the compartment, Pansy regaling them momentarily with embarrassing stories of Draco plotting against Harry and Ron jumping in with his own stories of Harry doing the same, much to both their obvious chagrin. Eventually Luna came floating into the compartment and collected her girlfriend, Pansy immediately softening into the press of Luna’s embrace as they slipped away so wrapped up in each other Harry felt a pang in his chest.
“I know, that is why I got hit with that stinging hex, thanks ever so.” Harry said in the posh voice he used to jokingly mock Draco, leaning in close enough for their noses to touch, smiling.
“Too long.”, he added as he blew on the skin in front of him, relishing Draco’s jolt in response, hearing the other man’s forehead fall against the window as Draco went boneless, as if giving in to whatever Harry planned to do.
“Recruits, please end your duels. Good session everyone.” Draco said, taking over as Harry handed Nadia back her wand and walked to stand beside him, so close that their arms were touching. Draco tried to ignore him as he told the recruits they could be done for the day and to enjoy their evenings.
“I am just a bit nervous, is all. I don’t mind it, it will be an interesting test and above all, Draco - I trust you. I just always wish we had a little more warning.”
“I guess someone ought to follow you so you don’t get lost.” Draco said, his mouth quirking just slightly into a soft smile.
Harry muttered something under his breath, Draco only making out, “mind his own business” before Harry turned to him, “Do you really want to try this? Or do you want to just wait for another one?”
“Right!” Harry nodded, accepting the chocolate frogs as Draco handed off some coins and said their thanks.
It was Harry’s turn to laugh, as Draco’s mind unhelpfully sent through some decidedly dirty shower fantasies.
“Fuck.” Harry sighed, the back of his head smacking softly against the compartment door he was still pinned against as he wound his fingers into Draco’s soft hair.
Eyes never leaving the other, Harry continued, “And after, I’ll take you and wash you down in the shower, fuck my come out of you as I soap you up just to get you messy again. Get you hard too soon, your body aching for it anyway.”
And with that, Draco took him into his mouth, not stopping until Harry could feel the head of his cock hitting the back of Draco’s throat.
“Yes. Fuck, you’re filthy and delicious. Want to take you home and let you do whatever you want. Do everything back to you until you can’t move a bloody muscle. How long is this fucking train ride?” Draco said in a rush as he complied with Harry’s request, flinching slightly at the cold window touching his half naked chest as he pushed his hips away from the window, presenting his perfect arse to Harry.
Harry would have continued their silly verbal sparring, but Draco kissed him silent, and they lost long minutes just snogging languidly, completely wrapped up in each other.
Draco moaned at the sensation, but it was dampened too much by their robes and their clothes. Draco whined and sent through the bond,
Draco smiled back, “Alright, well we have to wrap up our files for the Wilkinson case and then Ron said to meet him in the small conference room on level 3 and he will explain how to activate it and what our first round of testing will be like.”
“Exactly the problem, Harry. They are so well tailored I can practically see your cock through the trousers. You nearly killed me at the Ministry Christmas Party last year when you wore them for the first time.” Draco whined as he fell to his knees and began opening said trousers as if they offended him.
Draco nodded, “Yes, I heard the same,” his eyes sparkled as he looked over at Harry, “who would have thought a Gryffindor and a Slytherin could make such a fine pair?”
In their three years in Auror training, Draco thought surely he and Harry had worked through all their long-standing issues.
“Draco, your fucking mouth.” Harry praised, feeling himself get close as he tried to pull Draco off his cock.
Much to Draco’s relief, Harry took charge of gathering the recruits immediately, his mind sending through bursts of images to Draco of different types of training and tests they could do as if he was trying to decide. Draco had no idea Harry’s mind moved so fast and was honestly a little overwhelmed by it, so he stood beside Harry, content to let him lead.
“Yes, hold on.” Draco rummaged through his bag to retrieve the parchment he had been given, moving out of the doorway and over to his desk.
“I want to take you home and lay you in the middle of my bed. Take my time with you. Touch and lick and bite every inch of your skin until you're so sensitive you can’t think of anything but my hands and my mouth. Get you wet and loose for my cock and then fuck you slow and deep. Learn every part of you, Draco.” Harry swallowed, feeling his cock twitch just thinking about it, even if he knew he wouldn’t be up for another round for a while.
“You alright, mate? If it’s hurting or anything, tell me. We should be able to reverse it early if need be.”
Draco laughed softly, smacking Harry on the arm for the insult before sobering as he thought of something.
Draco felt Harry’s surprise and then startled pain as a strong stinging hex from Nadia landed on Harry’s wrist. Draco was surprised too; Harry had put down his shield but not attacked. He wondered if Harry was trying to let the recruit best him and internally scoffed.
“Okay, here it is. The charm is designed to send through active thoughts we wish to send to each other, this includes speech and images as well as sounds -”
“Alright, recruits. We are going to be doing a standard fare of training modules today, I think. Where did you leave off with McCallister and Stilinski?”
Draco skimmed the next section, adding, “They do have some listed warnings here, since it is new, they don’t know if we will have as strong of control automatically as they are saying we should. That may be something that establishes over time, or the charm could need to be adjusted for more privacy.”
Harry smiled at him so softly Draco felt his entire body go warm, sure a flush was rising to his cheeks.
Draco whimpered in response, his hands making an aborted movement towards his own trousers, obviously eager to get them off. Harry pushed himself off the door, stalking forward as Draco stepped back further into the compartment.
Draco sniffed and began striding through the room, adding in small suggestions to the other dueling pairs, and sending through nothing but white noise to Harry when he tried speaking to Draco through the link, hearing him make an annoyed sound behind him before he stopped pestering Draco, obviously focusing on his new friend.
“Not that I am not thrilled you both pulled your heads out of your arses, but you realize we have workplace policies against nudity, right?”
Harry ran his tongue over the bite to soothe it before dragging his tongue to the center of Draco’s arse, lapping at his hole and getting him wet.
“If you find her, can you get me a chocolate frog? Rosie likes it when I bring her home our cards.” Ron asked, looking equally excited about getting a sweet and impressing his daughter, as Hermione tried to contain a suffering sigh and Blaise hid his laugh into Neville’s shoulder, all of them having caught onto what Ron seemed to be missing.
Soon, they developed a rhythm, Draco pushing himself backwards onto Harry’s tongue and then fucking his cock forward into the circle of Harry’s hand. Harry could tell when Draco began to get close, his hole tightening around Harry’s tongue and his breath getting faster.
“Sounds?” Harry hummed, sounding interested. “That would be incredibly helpful during a surprise raid to send through any noises someone else is hearing in another location.”
Draco hummed in pleasure as he began to move, fucking his mouth onto Harry’s cock, taking him deeper with each movement as Harry’s hands tightened and began to direct Draco, receiving an encouraging moan in response.
“Thank you. I personally would much rather have you practice duels to practicals. Draco, what do you think?” Harry asked, looking at Draco for the first time since the charm had been cast.
Harry moaned, biting Draco’s lip, sending waves of pleasure through the link as he began to come, speeding up his movements and pushing Draco even harder against him, hands rough on his arse.
“God, I wish I could do everything to you right now. But for now,” Harry paused, looking up into Draco’s eyes, knowing the picture he must make as he asked, “turn around?” hoping his desire would be clear.
Draco moaned, pulling on Harry’s hair when Harry’s hands squeezed his arse, pushing Draco to rock against him, as they began a steady rhythm.
The walked in silence for long moments, Harry worrying that Draco hadn’t understood his actual intention, as he kept turning his head to look into each compartment they passed, until suddenly Harry found himself tugged into an empty compartment, his back hitting the closed door with force as the blinds closed with a swish of Draco’s wand.
Since Harry was still speaking with the American recruit (Draco should really learn her name), she was left without a partner thanks to their uneven number.
Last year, when Draco found himself pressed against their office door, Harry’s lips pressed hard against his own, both of them tasting a bit like the eggnog offered at the Ministry Christmas party, Draco was sure they had recovered from their childhood animosity. Although, neither of them had spoken about the incident since.
Harry looked his fill at Draco’s mused robes, his shirt gaping open and showing off his toned chest, the soft blonde hair leading into his trousers, which were somehow still fastened, his cock straining obviously against the fabric.
Harry groaned, sending back through his own images of them, as they began to move together, still snogging like teenagers.
Draco turned in the circle of Harry’s arms, quickly summoning his wand and flicking the mess against the window away before leaning back against it as Harry once more pressed their bodies as close as possible with Draco still brandishing his wand. Draco flicked his wand again and his clothing began to set itself mostly to rights, much to Harry’s disapproval. Draco chuckled softly at Harry’s expression as he flicked his wrist once more and Harry’s clothes began to do the same.
Harry hummed his compliance and pulled one of Draco’s bollocks into his mouth, giving it the same treatment he had given Draco’s hole before letting it go and pulling the other into his mouth. Harry pressed his tongue into Draco’s perineum, humming as he moved his hand through Draco’s legs and grabbed onto his cock.
And then they were kissing, somehow softly but furiously, all the tension from the past year, and probably longer, fueling them as they tugged at each other’s clothes, hands and heat everywhere as they finally reached skin.
“Do you want to go out to dinner with me tonight?” Draco asked once they had calmed down, his long fingers curled around Harry’s own.
One of Harry’s arms came from around him and then both their robes were gone, Draco groaned, pulling away from Harry’s mouth to look down at them both in their street clothes.
Harry tapped the inside of Draco’s thighs, wordlessly asking him to spread his legs. Draco quickly complied, and Harry dragged his tongue down to Draco’s bollocks, pressed tight to his body.
He could feel Harry’s eyes on him, the mood equivalent of question marks coming through their link. Draco merely sent back rapid fire dueling techniques like Harry had done before.
“Oh shoot,” Blaise made a show of snapping his fingers as he tugged Neville into the seat beside him with his other hand, “that entirely slipped my mind.”
He looked down, smiling to make sure Draco knew he was joking to find the other man already smirking up at him, “Yes, I do. Now this time, you’ll have to keep quiet on your own if you don’t want to get caught, but I still sort of hope you scream, albeit for much better reasons.”
Draco’s trousers and pants dropped to his ankles, and Harry dropped to his knees, still talking, his warm breath making Draco’s cock twitch upwards as if in invitation. Harry smiled and licked his lips, pleased by Draco’s answering groan.
“All the department specific details, you can keep the rest to yourselves. Please.” Ron said in a rush, turning bright red.
“Did they give you any details about how the charm works?” Harry asked, running a hand roughly through his curls, some of them standing on end, Draco’s fingers itching to smooth them.
“Well, essentially, I thought we could use some kind of booster. Something that would give the muggle soul enough power to manifest without you being weakened or damaged. I will draw some runes around the place I think I found your soul and it should do the work. But this is really old healing magic and was poorly documented so I had to improvise and adjust the runes by myself” Draco was confused, but that was nothing new these days.
“We are here to see Head Auror Robards” the blond said to the reception boy who jumped, startled by the sudden harsh voice.
As soon as he entered the darkness swallowed him and every light he could possibly bring with him as the wind turned off the candle. He knew there was no point on trying to lit it again so he dropped it and started walking blindly, trusting his newly discovered instincts.
They had not talked much after that, but the agitation hadn’t left him. He wasn’t used to see Malfoy so vulnerable, even while being sick he was annoyingly proud, always defensive and careful, and then…
“Listen, Hermione thinks we should meet now, can we go over in say…ten minutes?” he looked down at his trousers, cursing and thanking Pansy at the same time, before answering affirmatively “Great, we’ll be there soon, I have to find a chimney” he dropped the thing back at its place.
Harry moved around the place, his mind running wild, trying to remember everything he had ever read on possession and soul containment. The Horrocrux’s principle was to rip the soul trough murder and store the fragment into an object or living being; it was an excruciating process. That was not an option since it was not Draco’s soul the one he needed to separate, but he could use the idea of a receptacle. Maybe, if he could transfer the foreign piece somewhere else, he could get rid of it and stop the side effects on Draco… or maybe not.
At first he had not felt anything alien. He was sad and overwhelmed but those were his own emotions and thoughts; until he started hearing Alexei’s voice screaming inside his head, his lungs had felt like they were burning, his sight had gone blurry and all he could feel was the kid’s anguish, his desperation, his sorrow and the sound of his crying voice bouncing everywhere in his head. He had felt a flash of pain on his arms and then the rest of his body, but that was nothing compared to the sensation of having his mind and heart being ripped in a million little pieces.
He had a shift in St. Mungo that evening, but it was still early so he made his way upstairs and locked himself in his studio with Malfoy’s papers to finish up his notes on the day before starting to work on the medication.
“You know what?” Draco said after giving up his fight with the tie “You look too formal” he threw it on the bed and unbuttoned Harry’s shirt a little bit “That’s better”
Last night memories came back to him. Draco had fallen asleep without him noticing, hugging one of his pillows and babbling nonsenses. Harry could definitely have chosen to go to another room or to wake him, or levitate him, instead, to one of his guest’s chambers, but no, he had stayed there, starring at the sleeping man with a mixture of concern and amazement. He had never considered the day something like that could be happening, not in his wildest dreams. They had been enemies for seven years, they had done awful things to one another, they had insulted each other in every possible way, and yet, as soon as they had left the differences behind, they were trusting and caring for the other, they were sharing meals, and wine and moments. They were sleeping in the same bed, Harry’s bed, that was just crazy, it made absolutely no sense, but Harry couldn’t think of a single reason for not doing it all over again.
“Indeed I do” he threw the paper away and pulled Harry by the shirt “Who’s going to kiss me if you are not around? I would hate being forced to ask a random Russian to do it for you” Harry knew he was joking, and provoking him, but he had said it last night, he was possessive. He let out a growl that made Draco hold his breath.
“Oh, please. Stop being so overprotective. I’m fine. Adjusting, I guess, but perfectly fine. Let’s find Mr. Hilarious at once. I want to go get some rest” he gave Harry’s hand a soft squeeze and the brunet smiled. He tried really hard to resist the urge of kissing him right there and then.
“You had been through some serious shit when you had his age too and you handled it just fine” he felt Harry laugh.
He made sure the patient was stable before returning to the dorms and grabbing his notes on vaccines and their possible application in the prevention of dragon pox. Two hours later, his wand, hidden in his trousers, vibrated, indicating that his shift was over, so he took his stuff and made his way to the main door, signing the necessary paper for the entering doctors, and left the hospital.
He sat down in the chair next to the bed and grabbed a couple books and the bag of cookies from his case, handing Malfoy one of the tomes and offering the sweet biscuits.
He tried to concentrate on his own magic this time, to communicate with his body, so he could find the disturbance and…do something. Maybe he could unravel this mess by talking to this soul, what name had Potter said? Alexei. Maybe he could convince this man to leave him alone. It sounded preposterous, but the situation itself was not exactly logical.
“Hey” Draco called before he left the room “You never told me the name” he seemed to think about what he meant before answering.
“Yes, her. Why is that name so familiar?” Draco asked, more to himself than to the other. It had been in his mind for a while. He had the vaguest feeling he had heard of it before. Well, obviously, it was not an uncommon name, but he was almost sure he was missing a significant piece of information.
He had painted and disinfected the whole place, eliminated the dark spells and hidden the dangerous artefacts, along with the unpleasant portraits like Walburga’s, which had not been an easy task.
“Exactly, I accept cards and flowers from tomorrow on” he joked and Harry smiled while shaking his head.
“Dr. Potter, please, there is an ambulance arriving” the voice of the nurse brought him back from his slumber quickly and, grabbing his glasses from the side of the pillow, he stood up.
“Yes, he has been sick for some time now and we assumed that the potions and spells were working, but then…well, maybe you should see it yourself” she extended her hand and he took it, feeling the familiar pull of side-along apparition.
“I knew you were trouble, Potter. I should not have let you come here” he said “How did you find this place?” he tried to approach them but the fire circle rejected him. It didn’t hurt him, probably because he didn’t enter, but it sent him flying away. He composed quickly enough.
Last night’s conversation with Malfoy had left him completely shaken. Not only the blond was having a difficult time with some weird symptoms, that Harry was almost convinced had something to do with either his soul or the darkest of magics, but he also had apologized in tears with him for everything. He didn’t have anything to forgive the man for, as he had left the past where it belonged and he held no grudge for Draco anymore. He had saved his life somehow and even as a teenager Harry had been able to understand why the boy was that way. Maybe he would have reacted the same way if someone had mocked his name when he was elven, who knows? And who cares? The point was, Harry had been shocked when he had seen the other wizard crying and expressing his feelings, his true feelings, that way. He had had the impulse of hugging Draco, as he would have done with his friends or Teddy, and that was strange enough.
Draco kept his word and by midday was writing to Miss Ebranati to notify that her wand was ready for her to try it; he struggled a bit with his Italian, but it was surely because it had become rusty surrounded by French all the time. Sealing the envelope, he attached it to his owl’s leg and opened the window, breathing the fresh air. His workshop was placed in a sort of guest house, magically enlarged and reformed to his needs. There was even a basement where he kept the materials and, unlike the main house, a chimney, exclusively for his clients, as he didn’t receive many other visitors.
The runes were around the base of his neck, where Harry had told him he had found his soul, and where he had felt it himself. It couldn’t have been easy to be precise in such an irregular surface but they looked almost perfect. Potter had done a great job.
Finally, he stood up. He rejected Harry’s hand, but followed him to the bed where he sat. Harry took the chair from the desk and sat in front of him. Since Draco was shirtless, the dark-haired wizard was able to catch a glimpse of the bruising that was starting to form in his lower back. The blood hadn’t stopped flowing from his palm, but Harry wouldn’t risk doing magic in front of the already scared Alexei, so he just grabbed a cloth from his case and passed it over to the other who took it reluctantly and pressed it to the cut.
Summarizing the situation: he possibly had a stranger’s soul appended to his, that was causing him a deadly illness. It would only manifest when he was weak because it didn’t intend on possessing him but some unknown dark wizard had decided that this should happen and not even the most brilliant witch he knew was able to guarantee it had a solution. Great. Just great.
“Why am I here? Where is my family? They…” he was shaking again. Harry had no idea what was happening to him. He was obviously scared, but had he hurt Draco’s body? Could he feel the pain from the cut in his hand? He didn’t seem to pay any attention to it. Harry tried to get closer, slowly but Alexei’s…Draco’s…. ugh…whatever, his eyes opened and he started moving until he reached the corner of the room.
“A nourishing potion with some supplements added” Harry was already performing spells and had his attention on the task so he didn’t see him making a disgusted grimace.
“Good afternoon, gentleman” Minister Shacklebolt was there to receive them instead of the Head Auror, a knowing smile on his face “Quite a trip, uh?” Draco rolled his eyes and Harry smiled.
“I’m…” Draco stopped. He actually need to think the answer. He was fine, but, how? “Confused. Do you mind telling me what the actual hell happened?” Harry laughed and the sound made him shiver.
“We just had breakfast, Teddy. The excuse of being growing has its limits, buddy” he was not a spoiled kid, so he just insisted once more before giving up. Harry would buy the kid a bag full of candy and pastries since he wouldn’t be seeing him for another three days at least. Andromeda was going to kill him, but his godson’s smile was always worth it.
“Maybe” Harry said “I should go to the library and try again to find something about that damn man, but I don’t want to leave you alone” Draco smiled at his concern.
Harry groaned, closing his eyes from how delicious it was to hear Draco ask for what he wanted, and rushed to comply. He continued to stroke Draco softly as he pressed his tongue into Draco, his hole giving way after so much attention, finally allowing Harry entrance.
Harry was sweating despite the evening summer breeze coming in from the slightly open windows as he tried to find an open train compartment, Ron and Hermione chatting softly beside him. He tugged at his dress robes, the high collar feeling too tight on his skin. He swallowed thinking of Draco’s whispered breath there not an hour earlier as the other man whispered sarcastic remarks beside him at the gala for the 10 year anniversary of the Rebuilding of Hogwarts, celebrating the final projects and upgrades being finally finished.
Draco eyed them surreptitiously, Nadia was obviously quite talented at defensive magic, almost evenly matched for Harry before he was active in the field. Now, Harry was more nuanced with his magic, more likely to use something unexpected, although he still didn’t have an ounce of patience. Draco was the one who could wait out his opponent, simply blocking them with a strong shield until they physically tired themselves out or magically exhausted themselves, and then Draco would go in with a barrage of magic, overwhelming his opponent. It made them a good team though, to have different types of fighting.
“He seems pretty out to me, headmaster. I think he has no idea what happened here and even if he did, it would do him no good to tell anyone”
He was turning in a hall on the second floor, absentmindedly, when he heard his name being called very, very softly. He glanced both ways and to his back but he saw no one there. It was not until he reached the staircases, a couple steps ahead, that he saw a little girl with lovely freckles, dressed in the school’s navy uniform, making gestures for him to get closer.
“It’s mine. It was promised to me more than ninety year ago. It should have come to me then and it didn’t”
“Good, if you start feeling something different call me, okay?” Draco nodded “This is almost experimental, so side effects may appear. Don’t push it today, and rest. If everything goes fine you can go back to work tomorrow”
“It’s all right. Do you want to take a bath?” Draco nodded and they both stood up and made their way to the bathroom. Harry reheated the water in a moment and they entered. The pool was big enough for them to lay and don’t even touch, but they had no need of doing that. On the contrary, they ended up doing it again. Draco on top of Harry, slowly and tenderly. The blond found out he liked it that way as much as the other. It surely was driving Harry insane and therefore bringing the smugness out of Draco.
“I’m sorry to bother you, Kreacher, but I can’t seem to find Harry. Do you happen to know where he could be?” he asked crouching next to the elf and regretting it after he felt a stabbing pain on his back.
“I’ll be all right, love” he kissed him softly “Go. We have to solve this once and for all. I’m just sorry I can’t be more helpful”
“Maybe. But it looks amazing on you and it feels great so, no shaving. Take care of it but the beard stays” he declared “And now stop with the cocky grin and go get my breakfast” he stole one more kiss and freed Harry so he could go check the oven.
The balcony’s windows were open. The chilly air making the curtains wave and his skin burn, except for his hands, wrapped around a hot cup of tea. It was absurd to be standing half naked there but Draco had no intention of moving right now. Harry had gone somewhere, probably the library, and hadn’t come back yet, making him worry with every hour that went by.
“Harry is coming tonight. He wrote to me that he had had to work unexpectedly last night and he wasn’t getting home particularly early” Draco rolled his eyes.
“Have you ever heard doctors are hard to date?” he nodded “Well, it seems to be true. Not many are taking the challenge these days” he was so very tempted to tell him he loved a good challenge, but he managed to control himself. Too early for being so forward, not to mention the fact that, at some point, he had acknowledged inside him that he liked Harry, maybe a little too much.
Draco made his way to find Harry. He was not in the kitchen or the cellar. He checked the entire floor but couldn’t find him so he moved on to the next one.
“You had an accident with your magic in the studio, or at least that’s what you told me yesterday” the healer stood from his bed and helped him get comfortable.
“Oh god. Does everybody call him Harry now?” he protested while the mediwizard accommodated him in his bed and started putting fresh bandages over the injuries.
“Life is not even a thing, Harry. Life is a concept. I am real, I am the one standing in front of your eyes and you can’t just resign to me. Even if you could, you would just go to be tested yourself, there is no point on taking that risk. Your friend’s soul is not even important to me. I don’t care if it goes or stays here, I just need the boy’s soul” Alexei’s soul.
“I couldn’t. I kept getting ideas and it made it impossible to rest” was Potter’s answer. He was smoothing the covers of the bed. He patted the spot that faced the mirror and Draco took it as a signal to sit there.
Soon enough, his breathing joined the water and the sound of his shoes on the steps as he descended. He saw a small statue of a gargoyle on a side of the wall, he kept going down. He went deeper and deeper, humidity making his lungs fight for clear oxygen and his skin break to sweat with the minimum effort despite the cold.
They were kind of stuck with the reading. Draco’s tip had led them to the right section of the library, but there were at least fifteen books on the subject. The ones they had already gone through were resting, useless, by the tray Kreacher had brought them with coffee and sandwiches, now empty. Harry’s lap was full with a thick volume named
“I’m a specialized healer and Dra…Mr. Malfoy is an excellent wand-maker; we can offer a lot of expertise in those areas”
Draco was alive. But he had not been hit by any spell. Harry glared at the Death, still floating above his head.
“What do you mean? Where is he?” he tried to sound as calm as possible but it was a challenge with his head drumming.
“Welcome to the RUMMA, Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy” she said in a stern voice “Shall we start the interview?” they nodded.
“Don’t be. Anyway, were you even paying attention to your work?” he pointed to the papers “You seem to have been too attentive of my conversation” Draco raised an eyebrow, teasingly.
“Yes…where is my family?” he had tears in his eyes, in Draco’s eyes. Harry held his breath at the sight.
” Harry didn’t need to understand what he was saying to comprehend it. That was Draco’s voice, but it was definitely not him.
The tray had disappeared as soon as they had finished, leaving only a bowl with fruit behind. Harry was feeding him a grape while Draco commented everything in the movie.
“Thanks, Kreacher” taking off his coat before hanging it besides his lime healer ropes, he made his way to the kitchen. As always, a large cup of coffee was waiting for him and the house-elf had prepared a full English breakfast. He started with the eggs, while checking the pile of letters, until a particular one grabbed his attention.
He kept working on those through the morning, rejecting just a couple of applications, until his mother brought him lunch. Two silver trays levitated behind her; she had taken the habit of eating with him in his bedroom, something outrageous in other circumstances, but inevitable now, as she threatened to keep an eye on him at all times.
After buying a bunch of Ted’s favorites, which cheered the boy up, Harry apparated at Andromeda’s and ran away before the witch could murder him for buying the kid so much sugar, apparating back home and starting to put the groceries in its place and getting what he needed for lunch.
The healer helped him down the stairs and Draco led him to the garden, where the table was set for two but with a ridiculously large amount of food on it.
Not even Hermione’s news or Teddy’s loving words were enough to get the oppression out of Harry’s chest. He knew Lucius was sick, but it was supposed to be mentally speaking. According to Narcissa, he had had a heart attack and by the time they had found him the damage was beyond repair. The doctors had said his heart had apparently been affected while he was in Azkaban but they never paid any attention to it since wizards tended to be fairly protected by their magical cores against organ failure. Harry knew best.
“I won’t have you bleeding unnecessarily, we are staying somewhere else. Thanks, Mr. Loughty” the unspeakable opened his eyes and reached for them before they could turn.
“Come on now. You wouldn’t attack a disarmed man, would you?” he was right. That was against his principles.
” he murmured. He was not Hermione, but he could manage a decent enough memory charm. Everyone present started to look confused and then they kept walking like nothing had happened; the girl on the phone cut the call and apologized to the assistant for bothering him but she couldn’t seem to remember why she had called on the first place.
“Because I think that’s the only explanation for this” one of the blonde’s eyebrows arched inquiringly “Not only the symptoms are clear, but the tests reveal you lack one of the coagulation factors, number XVIII to be precise. That’s indicative of Hemophilia”
“Not like that! Ugh…let’s just eat, okay?” he passed Draco his plate and poured some more wine in both their glasses before sitting next to the blond.
They had set the table out in the garden in order to have enough space, since Draco’s house was not particularly big. The kids were playing around, driving Rolf crazy, George was talking to Pansy, who had arrived a couple minutes ago, right from work, claiming that Blaise wouldn’t make it since he was in a meeting with a foreign investor; his mother was chatting with Fleur and Ronald while Bill had gotten himself into a conversation about economics with Draco’s father, who seemed more than pleased of being able to display his knowledge. Molly had insisted in helping Harry with the last details of their lunch and Draco had found asylum with Luna and Hermione, who were talking about baby stuff.
“I don’t know. Although, I can tell you it’s your soul what is here, not you. Do you remember anything before our encounter the other day?”
“I had a dream before waking up” he said instead “I think it has something to do with Alexei, but it makes no sense”
“Draco Malfoy is a former Death Eater” he said with a patronizing tone “His name has been cleaned, but any kind of Dark Art is forbidden if he wants to stay out of prison. He talks, we talk. None of us has proofs against the other, but it would not be a pleasant situation” Shestakov smirked content and Harry rolled his eyes “Now. I think you should focus on the task at hand. Our mysterious guest seems to have disappeared” all eyes turned to where Rasputin was supposed to be. He was gone “I recommend you give your best to find him and leave these young men to me. I will make sure everything goes smoothly”
“Did you figure something out?” Draco asked, changing the topic, while bending over to retrieve a paper from under the bed, catching Harry’s attention.
“I’m not jumpy, I was just too focused. These are definitely more instructive on the matter than the ones at your house” he seemed to have had a similar idea about writing down some notes, but instead of buying the materials he had apparently had the chance to conjure them “Did you find something?”
“Oh, that’s why it seemed familiar. I think I heard it a couple times at Hogwarts” another moment of comprehension hit him “Wait, does that mean he was a half-blood?!”
“The pleasure is mine, Mr. Malfoy, thank you for your congrats by the way. It was a pleasant surprise” Draco smiled politely while the other wizard processed the situation. He knew Malfoy was well-mannered but the man in front of him had nothing to envy Prince Charming and, on top of that, it appeared the blond had somehow congratulated his friend about something.
“I mean, Pansy asked me a couple times when she was still interested in me, but no one I had really liked has actually asked. It was kind of implied, I don’t know, it just feels like the first time” Draco blushed and it made Harry melt.
Maybe Harry was in there. He pushed a little and got inside the room that had been locked ever since he arrived to Grimmauld Place for the first time. It was full of boxes of different size, all covered in dust. Harry was not there, but, why had he protected that room so heavily? It was just a regular room with a bunch of boxes and, judging by the movement on his peripheral view, rats.
“I know. But I would recognize you anywhere” Harry was starting to think he had a very malleable mind. He was too easy to manipulate. He wanted to say something, reveal the truth, but he advised himself against it; he focused instead in Draco’s steady pulse under his fingertips, the movement of his chest.
Night had gone as smooth as one could have expected with that precedent. Potter had transfigured the chair into a bed and spend the night with him, alternating reading with care-taking and one or two hours of restless sleep. Draco knew his mother had offered the wizard his guestroom and he was fine with it, but he also knew that he would not use it as long as Draco was in such condition.
“That’s absurd. Grigori Rasputin is dead, thanks heavens. The poor man was completely mental” Harry was in shock. How could someone pretend so well? He knew the truth and even him was tempted to believe him.
Next he knew, he was standing in a much modern living room, exquisitely decorated and surprisingly welcoming. Narcissa led him to the second floor, and asked him to wait by the door for a second as she entered. He checked his wristwatch, he should have been tired from the night shift, but he was extremely alert instead, no wonder why, since that letter had been alarming even with little information.
“Not so far” Draco knew he meant the medicine, but, for some reason, he considered telling him something about his dreams. Potter had been nothing but professional so far and maybe he could provide a logical explanation or at least discard a psychological trauma. He was hesitant, he did not want the other wizard to think he was crazy “Can I ask you something?” Potter looked surprised and he couldn’t blame him; Draco had not been particularly communicative with him so far.
He turned, looking at the hooded figure that was hovering on one side of the arc and he made up his mind. He smiled in gratitude and crossed right through the veil.
“You’re very welcome” she stood up and started to move to the garden door “and Harry” the man looked at her, he was still holding Draco who was going limp between his arms “take care of him” and with that, she was gone.
“It just makes no sense” he declared “They are supposed to be secret spies and they are going around the city shooting at each other from their vehicles like it’s the most normal and discreet thing to do” Draco was hugging Harry’s bare chest while talking. The dark-haired wizard had put on his underwear after their bath, but Draco had fallen in love with the Turkish cotton bath-robe, which were a beautiful shade of green. He stopped to eat the fruit the other man was offering but kept speaking after that “They don’t even know how to obliviate the witnesses” Harry’s chest vibrated with his laughter.
“Yeah, me neither” they both stayed in silence for a moment. They knew there was nothing they could do to help Alexei, he was dead, and most probably his family too. What could he need to rest? Why was he still around? How was that possible without magic? They had to keep searching, but they were not going to find anything in any wizarding library. The Romanovs were muggles, after all. Royalty or not “I think we should keep looking around in your library. It’s improbable, but maybe there’s something else”
“Better?” it was an even dummier question, but the blond nodded anyway, still whining “Can you tell me your full name? I can start by looking it up. I presume you are from Russia?” he nodded again.
“Oh? Are you agreeing with me? Does that mean I was right about hiring him?” he rolled his eyes. She loved to be right and, unfortunately, she usually was.
“How is your daughter?” he asked the wizard in front of him after a couple minutes of silence. He was determined to prove he was better than his younger self. Weasley looked surprised, but when he recovered, his answer didn’t come as harsh as before.
Harry had felt so happy ten seconds ago that it didn’t even surprise him when everything had gone to hell. Draco had stopped moving his lips and he hadn’t answered when Harry had called his name. Therefore, he was not surprised either when the man pushed him away. He left Alexei take his time to realize he was in control of Draco’s body now.
“I never pictured you as one to have elves working for you. Not after Granger’s campaign for the elves’ rights”
“Why? It was not his time. Why would you take him? Haven’t you taken enough from me already?” he screamed. He could feel his magic trembling under his skin, ready to explode and cause havoc.
He had also been pretty insensitive in all his romantic or sexual relationships; he could not be seen as vulnerable. He was a Malfoy; he could not be hurt.
He stood up and straightened his suit before walking towards the garden. His mother was there, and his father. He was on a wheelchair but he had never looked healthier than then, his hair full of flowers Narcissa had put there to his displeasure, but Lucius had always spoiled his wife.
“Here, let me help you” the brunet lift him until he was resting his back on the pillows before handing him a glass with a thick, muddy liquid.
“Draco, Harry, it smells lovely” she greeted right before the fire clacked again and her husband came out with his daughter in his arms.
He hugged her, letting her cry as much as she needed. He tried to comfort her. He told her that Harry was there, that he would help them, that she had him and her sister now, she was not alone. They would get over it.
“Alexander would let us know if he is captured but he is still missing” Harry’s hand was entwined with his and Draco gave it a reassuring squeeze. He wondered why Harry hadn’t asked him about the test inside the veil, but he appreciated it. He couldn’t bring himself to talk about it and keep it together. Maybe some other day.
Oh, yeah, he had been avoiding looking at the man’s hands every time they were anywhere near his body. That would be reason enough.
“Draco, babe, they are about to arrive. Could you please come down here before I lose my mind and end up burning something?” he laughed. Harry could be so dramatic. All they needed was wine. Lots and lots of wine. That was it. Everyone was happier with wine.
“I was going to look for a couple books back at home, but…well, I needed to be sure you were okay” he was slightly blushed, and Draco felt his chest fill warmly.
“I knew I had to wait ninety years after Alexei died, I prophesized it after all. But I was not going to wait more than that” he did remember the prophecy.
It felt like seconds, but a couple minutes had gone by when he woke up to Draco’s movement. The blond was shaking again, his eyes white and his skin was so hot he could feel the heat without touching him.
“I want to take a bath” he asked and Harry smiled. That was something he could do to make him feel better.
“Of course they are, Draco. Stop thinking stupid things, you are just tired” he told to himself before making his way back to the bedroom and putting on his sleep-clothes.
He kneeled and looked under the tablecloth, not there. Confused, he looked at his mother who, smiling, pointed her skirt.
“You never told me what had happened after I passed out” he said after a while, when they were just relaxing “And don’t you dare call me the Boy-Who-Lived again, Potter or I swear I’ll cut your balls off” Harry’s laughter made his body vibrate.
Before Harry noticed, it was lunch time so they also took a table at a small restaurant on that same street. Then, they went to a couple museums and a monastery called Ganina-something where Draco took around twenty photos claiming that it had a very beautiful green color and that muggle camera was not making it justice.
“I’ll be fine. I can’t be completely okay if I don’t know what’s happening to me” Harry thought about it for a minute, but finally surrendered.
“Can you hold this for me?” the question made him jump. He had been too focused on not thinking about the other’s breath against his sensitive neck skin or the feeling of the soft brush caressing the base or his throat.
“Sure” she said giving him a look that transmitted calm, even then. He nodded and appparated straight into Malfoy’s room.
The sight was…shocking, to say the least. The contrast between the sheets and the white skin and blond hair should have been deceiving, but it was obvious that Draco was paler than usual; his body covered in bruising, some older than others, and even in his sleep he was visibly in pain.
“I ruined it, didn’t I?” he asked. His voice was rough and Harry moved to hand him a glass of water.
“Well, you know I’m reluctant to apparition in your condition and it’s a bit far to walk. Scared of bikes, Malfoy?”
“What did you find?” he asked finally and Draco opened the too-many-Gs-in-the-title book in a marked page and offered it to Harry, who grabbed it and made his way next to the other wizard.
He was also supposed to have the gift of divination, and some of his prophecies had made an impact on his time, some like the ones that, allegedly, guided the Romanovs through the revolution. He had lost himself in the muggle world and abandoned everything related to his wizarding pairs since he left the school, returning to it just once after that, many years later. Most of the items and prophecies he had created had never been found and the single evidence left of him was in the archives of Koldovstoretz, not even his bones existed any longer.
He waited for Harry to come back while revising the parchments left behind by them. Some were discarded in a pile with a red cross, others had been adjusted with a darker ink and others remained untouched, he was extremely concentrated in absorbing as much as he could. He understood most of it, except for the bits regarding pure healing magic.
“Please, come in, he is asleep right now but if you need it I will wake him” Harry entered the room, his eyes falling immediately in the black dressed bed and the man in it.
He was little, but not dumb. He knew his sisters used to hide in the easiest places when he was the one looking. They didn’t want him to get hurt. Always protecting him. He was the heir of the Russian crown, the tsarevich of the empire.
He left the room and walked to where, he supposed, was the library. Harry had told him it was on a lower floor, he couldn’t remember if it was the first or the second, he just knew he had to go straight to the stairs. In order to avoid the students he could encountered, he took a couple turns that landed him in some unidentified level of the castle, one he had not seen until that moment but that looked very similar to the first floor so he assumed there was where he was.
“Oh, welcome Master Draco, the house is happy to receive family” he looked subtly at Potter “Forgive Kreacher, Master”
“Pure blood’s bunkum. The point is, I forgot almost everything, but the Romanov name is somewhere there, I’m sure. So maybe we could focus on that first” he finished.
Maybe there was an ulterior lesson he needed to learn out of that, something about taking nothing for granted or not giving up hope just because something seems difficult, but he had parked his hopeless positivism on a corner, next to his mother’s letter and his mind was focused on the proof in front of his eyes. It was a challenge to his brain, an attack on everything he had ever studied and that was not fair. He had had already enough to worry about for the next two lives and here he was, losing the balance on the only solid ground he knew: his work.
“This is charming but, unfortunately, I have more important things to do. I would love to leave you two to catch up, but the clock is ticking” Rasputin voice broke the moment and snapped Harry back to reality. He had seen the man send a spell in his direction. What had happened?
“Bon appètit” Harry raised his glass in answer and started to eat, enjoying particularly the texture of the pastry, which made the Wellington one of his favorites. He was going to put his second fork-full into his mouth when a moan, that couldn’t possibly be coming from Draco, sounded next to him. He turned to find the wizard with his eyes closed and a hand covering his lips “Are you okay?” the other nodded but said nothing. Harry started to think he had imagined it when it happened again “Draco?”
“Did you find a cure on your own or am I just that good?” they entered the living-room where the two witches were still talking, this time comfortably sited on the sofa.
“Save me the talk for latter, Kings” Harry handed the sock over to the man and grabbed Draco’s hand “We’ll take your office’s chimney, thank you” Harry hurried towards the door and Draco managed to see the minister smiling and shaking his head in denial, like he knew Harry had a malfunction way beyond repair and had given up with him a long time ago.
“Anyway, I came to ask you if you wanted anything to eat. I’m going to make myself some tea and I thought you may want some cookies or something” he blushed and Harry smiled warm-heartedly.
“It’s a perfectly reasonable treat and a very popular one, for your information” he adjusted his glasses and pretended to be offended.
“Relax, Draco. I have to keep one of this around for my muggle work, but I remembered I could use the information in here” Harry had then proceeded to explain something called
at the same time. The bookshelves were curvy, instead of the classic quadrangular ones, and were surrounding a small reading space in the middle of the room, with a rectangular table, a rigid-looking chair and a couple of much more comfortable armchairs. It was as big as the Manor’s, but definitely more majestic and imposing. Why had his mother never talk to him about it?
“Right on time” he murmured turning to face Draco who was leaning on the counter, therefore, looked smaller than him.
“Thank you” he said softly and even if he looked like he wanted to say something else, Harry was not going to force him to do anything he wasn’t ready for.
“Do you mind if I ask, why are you here?” Rasputin asked looking at Draco directly; Harry didn’t like that “I admit you are physically tougher than I expected but I have been in your mind. You should not have been able to return”
He wrapped his legs around Harry’s waist and his boyfriend held him there with his hands under his butt-cheeks. He had the vaguest notion that they were moving but the only things clear in his mind were the soft hair under his palms and the hot body against his own.
“What the fuck, Potter? I could have been naked!” Draco shouted while squeezing his chest with one hand. If he didn’t die from Hemophilia he would definitely have a heart attack, anyway, his days were counted.
He was standing in his own room and yet, he was laying on his bed, asleep, pale and shivering, right after having changed bodies with Alexei.
He reached the door and pulled it open. The biggest house elf he had seen in his entire life was waiting at the other side. He was used to smaller specimens and this one was impressive. He was holding a bundle of letters and he looked really surprised to find him in that room.
Granger was muttering something under her breath while going through Harry’s notes. They had called her extremely late last night when they were done discussing the healer’s plan to stablish some sort of communication with the invader. Draco had almost enjoyed hearing Weasley’s annoyed and borderline jealous voice in the back of the bizarre artefact Harry had used to call the witch. A cellphone, he had called it. Draco obviously knew what a cellphone was, but he had imagined something rather different. He found himself fascinated over the item and had toyed with it until Harry had agreed to teach him all about it.
“Hush, my dear. There is no need to cry” he heard a voice. Not Draco’s. A horrible voice. He lifted his face and looked for the origin “I am here. I have been longing to see you” Harry saw a hooded figure floating towards him. It was not a Dementor. Dementors couldn’t speak. It was something else, something worse.
Harry opened the door and found himself in a dark, damp place with stone walls and floor; the trace of dittany was gone, but he knew he was in the right place. Magic just seemed to work differently there.
“It’s called a laptop. Is a portable computer. Muggles use them for research, working and storing stuff” Harry had answered absentmindedly before pressing a particularly large button. Suddenly, a picture of a bearded man, a fancy woman and a bunch of kids in black and white popped into the screen, making Draco jump.
“I know. Maybe we should go to sleep and hope to find something in the bookshop tomorrow” Draco had hidden his blush as best as he had been able to. It had been a sort of unspoken agreement that he would spent the night at Grimmauld with Harry, and it had made him feel…weird. It was the logical decision since none of them would go back to France that late at night, but it had still felt too personal, too homie.
“Welcome to the not-so-humble house of the Black, now Potter” Harry said a little bit uncomfortable “Although, I feel like this is more your home than mine” he laughed nervously and moved further into the house. Draco followed. The next area, a living room, had a more enthusiastic decoration, homier. The fireplace lit itself when Harry entered the room and a sudden pop called Draco’s attention.
“My house-elf. Well, he is more devoted to the house itself, but I think I have grown in him over the years and he actually likes me a bit now” Draco smiled at that. Who wouldn’t?
He kept going away until his back hit the wall. Harry was trying to find out what was wrong. Had the spell damaged Draco? It was barely possible, Harry had made sure it didn’t have any side effects even if it didn’t work properly, but maybe he had done something wrong during the incantation itself.
“Your hearing is fine, Mione” usually Harry wouldn’t say who his patients were, but in this case he would probably need aid from the witch regarding the possible cause. She was more versed than him in curses; she was a curse-breaker after all.
“I see the mess in your hair is not extended to your studio. I’m impressed, Potter” he joked with a raised eyebrow and Harry rolled his eyes.
He dressed Draco again after adjusting the bandages around his marks and stared at him. He looked so peaceful but he had been in so much pain just minutes ago.
“Don’t be an idiot, Malfoy. You just wanted to get your eyes on your precious house-founder’s life” Draco gasped “You are not there, prince” Harry was not looking at him, but he knew Draco had rolled his eyes.
“Generally. I skip a couple meals when I have too much work and Kreacher is always pestering me about it”
Narcissa enjoyed the social life in France, enough to keep her distracted from the grieve of losing her husband. Lucius was alive, but not within the living. He had gone completely mental while in prison, and five years after the trials he had been transferred to Saint-Anne’s Hospital, in Paris. It was both a magical and muggle facility, and while Draco didn’t know why they had agreed to bring him near his family, he was grateful for it. Maybe his father would never recognize him again, but seeing him peaceful with his own mind was enough for him. What he didn’t remember, couldn’t harm him.
“Where are we?” he asked as he registered his own body. He was hurting everywhere. He couldn’t define where, he just felt like a hippogriff had dance a polka on him.
Perfect. He had an exceptionally annoying disease, he ached everywhere and was covered in bruises, having stupid, creepy dreams; his healer was no other than Harry-Sodding-Potter, who used to be his archenemy and who was apparently charring confidences with his mother. Life was, indeed, full of surprises, Draco found himself missing the time when his biggest problem was not finding a decent supplier of unicorn hair.
Draco was having trouble keeping the air inside of him, but he didn’t care. Breathing was overrated. He melted into that kiss, holding himself onto Harry’s shoulders like his life depended on it.
“I’m meeting with Hermione in an hour, so I’ll made the cures when you are done. Do you need anything?”
“Really mom? Him? There were no more healers in the continent? It had to be the fucking Boy-Who-Lived”
Hermione was talking excitedly with Fleur and Molly with a huge smile on her face, she was almost shining. Ten minutes later, Andromeda wished them good night and left, reminding Harry to drop Teddy or call her if he needed to work. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley followed her in no time and Bill and Fleur were right behind.
“W-w-where are we?” he asked after a couple minutes. Harry noticed again the strong accent, and the fact that it seemed to be difficult for him to speak in English. The first time they had met he had spoken in Russian; maybe the spell gave him access to Draco’s…capabilities, even if he still struggled with the language. Harry wondered what else would it do; would he be able to do magic? It was unlikely, but the healer decided that finding that out was not his priority.
“Harry?” the voice answered. It went silent for a while before speaking again “I see” he said, sounding intrigued and excited “Come, he is here” he knew it. He knew he was going to be here. Harry was always near when he felt safe. But, was he? Was Draco really safe there? He was cold; he was never cold around Harry.
Harry picked his own from the floor but after a couple more pages, he discarded it too. He stood up and decided he had to stretch his legs, urgently, so he searched his pockets until he found his cigarette’s case.
“Kreacher” he called softly, not sure if the elf would answer, but seconds later he felt a pop at his right.
“Mr. Potter, is a pleasure to see you again. Please, take a seat, and thank you for coming so quickly”
“That’s nice. Are they still together?” that he knew, since Pansy had told him not long ago, but he refused to let Potter know how they gossiped about the golden trio every now and then.
The stair’s wall was the only one that looked out of place and at the same time was the one that felt more like Harry. Draco guessed that, at some point, something had been there, hanging on the deep green painted surface, something entirely different from the current decoration. There were small frames, with pictures, instead of portraits, in them; one with Harry and the whole Weasley family, one with his two best friends and their baby daughter, a couple of him with a three years old boy and the same kid, who he assumed was Teddy Lupin, a bit older, flying on a broom with Harry, a picture of Sirius Black, Remus Lupin and James Potter laughing, one of Lovegood’s wedding day, probably, and the last one of his parents, young and loving to each other. It was a beautiful display and Draco found himself absorbing this new side of Harry’s life, the one that treasured his family and friends that way. Well, he had always been like that, but Draco haven’t had the chance to see it away from Weasley and Granger.
Draco assumed they had to follow his example and was about to puncture his own finger when a hand wrapped around his wrist.
“Oh, Draco” she went straight to hug him “Thank Merlin you’re back. Are you okay? You look healthier, dear. Are you healed already?” she had been crying a lot lately. He could tell. He nodded towards the healer and hugged her back.
“What?” he had understood him but that was certainly not what Harry expected to hear from his distressed boyfriend as soon as he woke up.
“You were shaking and you stopped when I held you, I’m sorry if it bothered you” there was something he was not telling him, he had some foggy memories that felt out of place, but Draco would worry about it eventually, right now he was more concerned about spending the night hugged to Potter.
“How can you say something like that? I have only taken what I had to, I hope you realize it is my job, my sole purpose in this world” great, wonderful, just what he needed: Death was playing victim on him.
Draco was not used to care for other people’s feelings. He had been a selfish little bastard all his youth and by the time he had grown up he had no one to care for except his mother and his very few friends. Narcissa was a different matter, but he had never been one to protect his friends’ sensibilities and they knew it.
Two more days passed and Draco kept receiving daily visits from Potter to check on him. Until, all of a sudden, on Wednesday morning, the dark-haired wizard apparated in his bedroom.
Feeling already better he went back to bed and picked the first letter. It was from Granger to Harry so he left it and went to the next one. But before he could read the name on the envelope he felt something drop on the sheets. It was a small, red coin with the world
“Bollocks! Lollipops are nothing compared to…ugh, never mind. Could we please forget this ever happened and go to the library?”
He chose to sit in one of the armchairs. The throne-like chair looked too old and unused and he would not be the one to disturb it. He unfastened the button of his suit’s vest and sat down as gently as he could manage since his back hurt like the devil, but he was received by a very soft cushion. Those looked rather new, so they had probably been chosen by Harry. He had to remember to thank him later.
“Fine, I get it. You are usually this charming creature and you just pretend to be a horror with me so I don’t fall to your feet” Draco’s eyes opened for a second, but he seemed to recover fast enough.
He returned to the living room where the two friends were still brainstorming away from a grumpy Weasley. He handed the juice to the witch and smiled when Harry thanked him for the coffee.
Draco went first inside the chimney, straight to his mother’s house. Harry had gone to drop their luggage at his house. If she was not there he would wait for him to come back before going to the hospital but he saw the window open and heard the kettle whistling before Harry stepped out of the chimney behind him.
Harry went through the content of every missive mentally before relaxing when he realized that no one had touched the topic, miraculously, as everyone had been focused on bigger news.
“Well, I’m officially asking, are you going to make me suffer while I wait for the answer, prince?” he copped Draco’s cheek and the blond pressed against his palm.
“I don’t think I saw you in Ancient Runes back at school. Should I be concerned?” he trusted Harry, and Granger had gone over it and approve it, but he was still a little bit afraid.
“The same. I live there with Kreacher and Teddy when he spends the night” he felt suddenly sick. Harry was more close to his own family than he had ever tried to be. He knew he had a cousin, but his mother and aunt had not seen each other in decades, so he didn’t know the boy. On top of it, Harry was living in his mother’s ancestral house, a place he had never visited before.
“Yeah, nothing for me to solve” he had to laugh, or he could start crying from impotence at any moment.
“Hermione and I agree that the most obvious way is to satisfy what could be keeping him from going to wherever muggles go after they die. I just hope is as simple as that”
“Of course. You will be the first one to know if something happens” he nodded and went back to his reading.
“Harry!” Draco’s voice got to him first, while he was putting the wrapped meet into the oven, the sauce was on low-heat and he went back to stir it “I found it, Harry. Where the hell are you?”
Harry went back to his previous position, licking and sucking Draco’s cock from the tip to the base.
“Well, I’ll leave you too to catch up so I can go home and shower myself. I also need to ask for the night free at the hospital. I’ll see you in an hour or two” Harry picked his stuff and gave Blaise a handshake.
He knew the library was on the other side, he just needed to go through the gap on the wall. Would he fit? Yeah, if Harry had fitted he would. He struggled with a string of the sweater that had gone loose and tangled itself in a pointy rock but he finally made it to the other side.
“Ah, ah. No sweets until you eat, missy” he said and the girl pouted. Her gray eyes looking right into his own, melting everything they touched.
He stroked his newly cut hair and his beautiful face. He felt so guilty, he should have known it would be too much for him, he should have been prepared in case anything happened, he should have reacted sooner. Harry should have done many things but he was just worrying. He had never been more concerned in his entire life; not even when Hermione had had Rose; he had been prepared for that, he had made sure they were okay. He would even choose to go to Voldemort and die ten times more than going through this. That had been his decision, he was the only one who could get hurt and he had gone knowing what to expect.
“I read somewhere that he was a seer” Alexander seemed surprised to hear that “You didn’t know about that?”
“Great, I think there is a whole section about family trees in the back. I’ll get them, make yourself comfortable” Draco nodded and Harry disappeared between the shelves.
“Yes, they have a daughter, and Herm is pregnant again” now that was something Pansy wouldn’t know. She was going to throw a tantrum, for sure. Draco was about to answer when the door opened and his mother came through.
“I’m afraid so, I’m sorry” what was he supposed to say in a situation like that? He was trained to tell people their loved ones had passed away, not the person itself.
“Good. I’ll be dropping by this evening or tomorrow morning if you prefer. I’ll need the coordinates for the floo” he stated.
“You don’t get away with language just because I was worried, young man” Draco was almost insulted, and looked in Harry’s way looking for support, but found the wizard’s shoulders shaking with laughter.
