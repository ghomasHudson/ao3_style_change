Neville steps though the entrance doors that barely stay in their hinges. Voldemort has moved into the courtyard with his Death Eaters. Neville doesn’t give them much attention. His sight is focused on the body in Hagrid’s arms. Harry is naked, his face and torso covered in blood. One of his arms hangs down and wavers with each step Hagrid takes. Neville swallows when he spots Harry’s blank stare. His eyes are open, but they don’t register anything anymore. There is no life in them left. Harry is dead. The war is lost.
Harold bites on his lip to hold in a laugh that tries to escape him. If his parents hear him he will be sent back to bed, and he wants to know what will happen now. He wants to see how the man and woman come to their end.
A young boy lays naked on the kitchen island. He’s older than Harold, by maybe two or three years. Daddy stands in front of the boy and pushes his hand over the boy's chest. He places kisses on the boy. Next to him lays an unconscious man. His face looks similar to the boy’s, and Harold thinks he might be the boy’s dad. Uncle Rabastan waves his wand over the man and then his clothes vanish into thin air. Barty laughs as he takes out a pair of ropes from one of the kitchen cabinets. Mother stands a little to the side, her wand pointed at a woman who lays on the kitchen floor. She’s the one that screams as she twitches around on the floor.
“Ah, yes. How are your parents, young Longbottom?” Voldemort asks Neville as he leans over him. “I’ve heard that sweet Bellatrix has given them a nice present after I disappeared.”
“That tickles, daddy,” he laughs as he places one of his small hands in Rodolph’s hair. It’s the same black colour as Harold’s, only much neater and tamer. Harold’s hair always wants to stand up in all kinds of directions. Bellatrix has tried to tame it many times but has given up by now. Harold’s hair has a mind of its own and that’s okay because daddy still finds Harold beautiful.
Harold lays his head on Rodolph’s chest. He’s still tired and the hand stroking his back makes him drift off. He doesn’t want to go to sleep but it doesn’t look like anything else is going to happen. Bellatrix puts her arm over Rodolph and Harold.
“No,” Hermione screams. She slams into his face and turns around on the ground. She starts to crawl away, only to get grabbed by the legs and pulled back. Greyback’s claws slice over her back, tearing her shirt to pieces. Greyback pulls it away and then tears Hermione’s bra from her body. He forces his hands underneath Hermione and pulls her upper body upwards while squeezing her breasts. His tongue licks over Hermione’s neck.
Harold passes out with his dad’s cock in his mouth, his mother's hands holding his face down and his body slacks on the bed.
Greyback doesn’t seem to care that Hermione is freaking out. He steps on, pulling Hermione along, straight towards Dean’s body.
Draco doesn’t get it. Does Potter truly want to die? Who would want that? Isn’t it better to live, no matter what? Draco knows what it feels like to get close to dead. It’s not a pleasant feeling, the pain and fear. The question of what comes next. Doesn’t this frighten Potter? Where is his survival instinct? Why did he hideaway for all these months only to surrender now without a fight. It’s crazy. But that is Potter, isn’t it? The crazy boy that always gets away with everything. Well, this time he won’t. This time he will die and Draco will be free.
Bellatrix whispers something in the woman’s ear. The woman stretches out her hands and rubs them over the dead boy’s chest. Bellatrix pushes the woman’s panties down and then moves her hand’s back to the woman’s breast. The woman takes hold of her dead boy and pulls his face between her legs. She rubs her pussy against his face, lets his thick blue tongue slide against her. And then she moves her hand’s towards the dead boy’s cock and takes it in her hands.
Dean stares at the dark sky and searches for the stars. He can’t see them. Where did the stars go? And why did Ginny leave him? He’s dying. Can’t she see he’s dying? She should have stayed.
It doesn’t take long before the peacock stops moving. Its neck hangs down over the rope. The beak of the bird is open and it’s feet have stopped moving. Some of its white feathers lay broken around it, snapped off in the bird’s fight for life.
“Let go of me, you filthy wolf,” Hermione screams. She tries to push Greyback’s hand off her breast and move away. But the wolf is quick. He grabs Hermione by her hair and pulls her head backwards. He places his lips on Hermione’s and pushes his tongue inside her mouth. Hermione slams her hands against Greyback to make him stop, but the wolf is stronger than her. He laughs into the kiss and then pulls away. Hermione sees his eyes twinkle as pushes his hand between Hermione’s legs and grabs her pussy through her jeans.
Harold nods his head and then is rewarded with a proper kiss. He lets his dad's tongue slide into his mouth. Rodolph’s hands slide down Harold’s side, over his hips and up again.
“Look at me,” Rodolph says when his balls hit Harold’s bum. Harold opens his eyes. A small tear escapes them and Rodolph kisses it away. “It’s okay, you’re fantastic. So nice and tight. Perfect for my cock.”
“Well, will you look at that,” Greyback says. He pulls Hermione’s head up and she looks into a small clearing. On a branch at the other side of the clearing hangs a naked body. Greyback steps closer, still pulling Hermione along. Hermione recognises the woman. It’s Narcissa Malfoy. She’s naked, her tongue hangs swollen from her mouth and her eyes bulge out of their sockets. Her body hardly moves, her toes only just touch the forest floor, where they’ve left a trail of the fight Narcissa made when her life ended.
Dean stares at the scene in front of him. Neville is still on his hands and knees as he lets out another scream which stops abruptly. Luna moves closer to Dean and he tightens his hold around her waist. This is all wrong. This is not how this was supposed to go. Dean had come back to Hogwarts to fight the final battle, to help Harry save the wizarding world from the lunatic who stands next to Neville. The lunatic who thinks all of this is funny.
Harold closes his eyes and smiles when his mother leans over his dad to give him a kiss on the top of his head, just like always when she puts Harold to bed. The blankets get pulled over them and Harold signs happily before he drifts off to sleep.
Harold sighs and leans his head to the side so Rodolph can place a proper kiss on his neck. Harold moans a little, causing Rodolph to laugh against his skin.
It doesn’t take long before Harold sees the woman again. When his friends and their fathers have left the next day, Rodolph takes Harold down to the dungeons. The woman sits in her cell. Her knees pulled up against her chest, with her arms around them. Her face is hidden in her knees. She shivers. The blood and sperm of last night are gone.
There is some commotion and then the forest goes silent again. Bellatrix screams that the boy is dead. Narcissa looks up with her tear-streaked face and watches as the people she thought were her friends start to move.
“Well done, my child,” the Dark Lord says. He steps over the dead body and points his wand at the crying boy that stands in his cot.
Only Dean finds no rest. He wakes in the dark. He can feel a massive snake move around him. Nagini rolls around his body, pushing his longs closed as she strangles Dean. She let’s go and Dean tries to crawl away. But he isn’t fast enough. Nagini opens her mouth and swallows Dean down. Dean screams as her digesting fluids touch his body. They sting and bite at him. Dean grabs around in the hope to find something to hold on to. He feels teeth and pulls his body forward. The world is still dark, but somehow he manages to push himself out of Nagini. He kicks her and tries to stand up. But his legs won’t move and he’s stuck in place.
And then the suffering starts. Narcissa’s body spasms in mid-air as it struggles for breath. The headache is back until it gets so bad that it passes Narcissa out. Only for her to wake again moments later to suffer through it all again. She hangs in a dark place, with nothing in sight. Alone with her agony, as she suffocates over and over again. For a few seconds, she will find relieve as her body gives out, only for it to start all over again. And over again. She’s stuck in an eternal loop of suffocating and dying on a none existing rope for the rest of eternity.
Potter looks at Draco. Hatred boils in his eyes and Draco smiles at him. “Don’t get all worked up, Potter. Just because I killed your beloved headmaster and his little errand boy, doesn’t make me evil.”
Her hands grab onto the rope. Narcissa tries to pull herself up, but she’s too weak. She opens her mouth and tries to find air. Her legs start to kick around as the hypoxia starts to take hold. Her body starts to shake and her eyes start to bulge out of their sockets. She loses control of her arms and they fall away from the rope. They hang next to her swirling body for a while, until the convulsions start. Out of Narcissa’s control her body spasms. The rope starts to turn, making Narcissa swing in all kinds of directions. The pain in her head is immense, it feels like her head is going to explode. Her face is turning purple and her tongue pushes itself out of her mouth.
“Just pretend she’s Victoria. Give her what your wife has coming for her when you get back home,” Mr Crabbe says.
“It’s time to greet your so-called saviour, Mudblood,” Greyback says. Hermione blinks as she sees the sword swing towards her. Her mouth opens and the beginning of a scream escape her. The sword slices through her neck with ease. The scream stops abruptly. Hermione’s headless body falls forward onto the ground, blood spilling on the ground. Her head hangs from her hair which is still held by Greyback. Her eyes wide open, just like her mouth, frozen forever in the scream she uttered just before she died.
“Let go of me, you filthy wolf,” Hermione screams from somewhere behind Dean. He turns his head to see if he can spot her. Two heavy footsteps move towards Dean. They drag something along with them. Someone, more likely, going by the screams coming from Hermione.
Others spot the body in Hagrid’s arms and Neville joins in with the shouts of agony and despair of the people around him. His eyes lock with Voldemort who pets his snake as if it is just a normal day. Until he looks at them all and silences them with a wave of his wand. Neville opens his mouth to scream at him, but no sound escapes him.
Weeks pass and Harold can’t help but think of that night he sneaked out of his bedroom and watched the young boy die. It’s all he dreams about. He wants to see it again, but after what Harold and Draco did to the peacock, Harold was told to stay in bed at night. And Harold doesn’t want to get in trouble. Mom had said he wasn’t allowed to play with Draco if he would disobey. And there is nothing Harold would do to jeopardise time spend with Draco. Draco also was told off and had to help clean the dishes for weeks after. So Harold plays nice and hasn’t left his bedroom once since that night.
Neville can do nothing but watch as Voldemort spells his clothes from his body, leaving him naked and exposed. Voldemort then pushes Neville on his knees.
“You can take your revenge,” Barty says. He’s got a knife in his hand. The man looks confused. “Kill your wife, and we will let you go,” he says.
“Not as delusional as you, thinking you’re safe because you have a hold on the boy who lived,” Lucius answers. Then he picks up the dead peacock and walks out of the courtyard.
“You’re beautiful,” Harold tells Draco as his eyes start to spin. Harold kisses his neck and enjoys the contractions around his fingers inside Draco’s ass. Harold is sure Draco just had an orgasm. It’s still seedless, just like his own, but they sure feel good. Draco goes limp beneath him and Harold pulls him off Rodolph’s cock. Draco doesn’t move or respond to anything anymore. He’s passed out during the height of his pleasure. With care, Harold lays him down next to Rodolph. He kisses his mouth and then crawls on top of his dad.
Neville blinks when he watches the Sorting Head fly towards him. It falls onto his head, taking away his view. The only thing he can see is the inside of the hat. And maybe that is better. At least this way he won’t have to look at his friends as he’s murdered.
They walk towards the woods as the darkness starts to set in around them. The trees are large and threatening. Hermione wonders if this is where Harry walked when he went to see Voldemort. When he walked into this forest to die. Hermione should have known he would do it. She should have stopped him, should have convinced him that Voldemort would never keep his word. Only Hermione didn’t. And now she will die in the same forest as Harry. Maybe even close to where Harry was raped and killed. The only question now is if Greyback will rape her before or after he kills her? Hermione hopes it’s the last. That her death will be quick and painless. So she doesn’t have to suffer any more than she already has. That she doesn’t have to feel the same shame and pain as Harry and Neville.
It doesn’t take long before Draco’s body starts to shake. His arms smash against the bed sheets and his legs kick underneath Harold. His head jerks to the side and a little saliva leaks out of it. Draco’s body convulses beneath them and then goes slack. Rodolph retracts his hand and then slides it around Harold’s throat. Harold pushes Draco’s face upwards. Draco’s eyes are rolled to the back, only showing the white of them. His tongue hangs from his mouth a little. For a short moment, Harold wonders if Draco is dead so he pushes his hand against Draco’s throat again. A soft pulse is there and Harold smiles.
It’s at that moment that one of the white peacocks walk passed them. Draco always says the animals are stupid, they eat the new plant seeds when his mother doesn’t protect them. And his father loves them, so Draco hates them. Harold watches the bird walk pass and thinks it would be perfect to show Draco what happened to the little boy he saw die.
“What’s wrong, Greg?” Draco asks when Greg walks back onto the balcony. “You’re pacing is getting annoying.”
Harry slowly puts his feet on the ground and raises his head. He knows this is it. He’ll be joining Malfoy in dead. There is no way to escape and Harry won’t die a coward. He will die strong and upright, just like his father. Just like Sirius and Lupin. Soon he will see his parents. And Sirius and Lupin. He will finally get to know his family and all will be well. He only needs to get through the seconds it takes for Voldemort to raise his wand and utter the words that will kill him for good.
Harold turns and looks at his dad. Rodolph takes his face in his hands and kisses Harold. “We have some tools on the table, or I can cast spells on her if you want.”
“Lily, take Harry, and go! It’s him!” Potter shouts when he burst into the hall to inspect the blast that had broken their door open. Bellatrix laughs when she sees that the idiot doesn’t even hold his wand.
Lucius drops his wand to his side and the woman stops her screams. She cries and begs for the men to stop. Mr Goyle grabs the woman’s face in his hand and pulls her back on her hand and knees. “Filthy Muggles don’t get a say,” he says. He spits in her face and then lets go of her.
Draco turns his head towards Harold and they kiss. Their tongues intertwine and the world seems to disappear around them. Harold can kiss Draco all day and never get tired of it.
Two small hands take hold of the scarf on each side of Bellatrix’s face. He pulls them a little tighter, making Bellatrix moan.
“What are you doing?” Draco whispers. Harold can feel his breath on his lips. His heart hammers in his chest and he wonders if his cheeks are red, like Draco’s are turning right now.
Narcissa doesn’t seem to hear her master. She only has eyes for the blank stare of her dead son. Harry looks at her and wonders if his mother would hold him like that after he’s dead, if she had still been alive. He thinks she would have. She would have mourned Harry too. For a second Harry is fascinated by the sight, until Bellatrix kneels next to Narcissa.
The door of the bedroom creaks open. Harold lifts his head from Draco’s cock to see who it is. Rodolph smiles at him. “What do we have here?” he asks. “Are you playing without me?”
Neville looks back at the Great Hall. Lavender’s body is in there. He found her between the rubble. Her clothes thorn from her body, bite and claw marks all over her and semen leaking from her open mouth. Neville had used a spell to clean her before he had carried her to the Great Hall where Professor McGonagall covered her with a sheet to hide her almost naked body.
“Your father is an idiot,” Harold says while he searches for his Quidditch ball set. The floor is littered with toys. He should tell Binky to clean them up tomorrow or something.
It’s kind that she tries, but Dean can feel it in his bones. It’s too late for him. He won’t survive it, even if Ginny will close his wounds now. “Leave it,” Dean says. “Help Hermione. Save her.”
Harold moves closer and sits down on the other side of the bird. “The boy was even more fun. He started to shake at the end. And his eyes had a white sheen after. These are still black, and kind of boring.”
“Daddy fucked the little boy and his mother pulled a rope around his neck. Mommy made her do it. The boy kept kicking and hitting the counter and daddy laughed a lot. And then after some time, the boy stopped thrashing. His movements slowed. And then he started shaking, really bad. His tongue started to push itself out of his open mouth and his lips turned blue. And then he stopped moving. His eyes stayed open and they looked weird but really cool.”
“Maybe next time you stay over, we can sneak down and see what our parents are doing,” Harold says. He wants Draco to be happy, to see what he’s seen. He’s sure Draco would love it even more. He likes seeing blood.
“Yes, Malfoy killed him too,” Harry snaps. “He got pretty good at killing innocent people after that.”
Harry looks at the crying creature again. If a part of Voldemort’s soul is here after Harry died, does that mean that he was…  “Was I a Horcrux?” Harry asks.
It doesn’t take long before their clothes are scattered over the floor. Harold and Draco lay on the bed, their limps entangled and their mouths glued together. They are both hard.
“Yes, you can,” Dean tells Ginny. “It’s okay. I will still be here when you get back with Hermione. She can do the spells to heal me.”
“This is beautiful,” Rodolph says. He looks up at Harold and bites his bottom lip. “You’re our boy, no doubt about it now.”
Aunt Bella laughs. “You wish they would just stand there and kill you now. Don’t you know our little Draco has had the hots for you ever since he was a little boy?”
The Dark Lord laughs, and the Death Eaters around follow. Draco shakes his head. Stupid sheep, most of them. The Dark Lord is angry, crawl. The Dark Lord is laughing, laugh too. The Dark Lord has an opinion, agree even if you don’t. It’s pathetic. They’re all just like Father. They lack inspiration. Or a spine. Draco might be a Death Eater, he’s still got a mind of his own. And that’s the way the Dark Lord loves it. It’s the reason why he and aunt Bella are his most trusted followers. Not because they do whatever the Dark Lords bits them, but because they do it with creativity and charm. With a little spice of their own.
“Yes, don’t stop,” Draco says. So Harold doesn’t. His hand tightens around Draco’s throat. It’s not big enough to cut off Draco’s airflow completely, but it’s enough to make him feel light-headed. At least, Harold hopes it is.
Draco’s hands slide around Harold’s waist and he rests his chin on Harold’s shoulder. “I’ll keep you warm if you want to go outside,” he says.
The battle moves away from Hermione and still, she doesn’t move. For the first time in her life, she doesn’t have an answer ready. She doesn’t know how to fix this. And it paralyses her.
Dean sobs and shivers. Who was he mad at just a moment ago? He can’t remember who was just here. He’s sure someone was just beside him. Was it Seamus? Where is Seamus? Shouldn’t he be here and help his boyfriend?
Dumbledore strokes his beard again as a new twinkle lights up in his eyes. “If you are sure it was your doing that forced his hand, you have a choice to make. Not if you will go back to your life or board the white train. But if you will take Draco’s place on the black train, so he can be set free and take the white one. Just know you will be choosing eternal suffering to save him.”
“Draco, my boy,” the Dark Lord says. Draco turns to look at his Lord. “I believe I promised you a reward for warning me about Snape and his treacherous heart. Did you know, Potter? That the man loved your mother more than he loved me?”
Harold looks at Draco and enjoys the feeling of Draco’s hand on his head. He wants him to grab his hair and pull him closer. He wants their mouths to sink into each other and kiss Draco until his lips hurt.
And then he spasms once before his body stops moving altogether. His blank eyes stare at the sky as the last of his blood slowly leaks out of his dead body, mixing with the dirt around him.
“Today we’re going to spoil mom,” Rodolph says. He stands in front of the bed and Harold moves closer so he can unbutton Rodolph trousers.
Harold shakes his head. “Daddy said mommy killed him in the end, after hours of torture. I went to the kitchen to see, and their bodies were still there. I touched the boy’s face. It was covered with his mother's blood. But his eyes were still open and I think they were beautiful.”
“My boys ready?” Bellatrix asks when she steps out of the bathroom. She’s naked and has her hair pulled back in a braid.
Harold lies awake in his bed. He stares at the enchanted stars on his ceiling. He wants to get a glass of milk. Only he’s not supposed to get out of bed. He could call for Binky and have him bring a glass off milk to his room. Only the elf tends to spill drinks all over the house, and it would be unfair if he gets punished for something Harold made him do. It won’t be the first time and Binky always looks so awful after he’s been punished by mother. So Harold would just have to sneak downstairs and hope his parents won’t notice him. They will be busy with uncle Rabastan and Barty. Dad said they were staying the night.
“I wasn’t supposed to see it. But mom and dad weren’t angry. Dad brought me to bed after they tricked the man into killing his wife. Muggles are so stupid,” Harold says.
Harold picks up his toy broomstick. He’s got a better one down in the shed, one that will go higher and faster. But he’s not allowed to use that one in the house. And as it’s been raining all day, they’re stuck inside.
The knife touches the side of Draco’s throat and Draco knows his life is over. There is no way he can fight off the Dark Lord. His wand lays to his side, out of his reach. He’s pinned between Potter’s squirming body and the Dark Lord.
Rodolph his hands move lower and then start to open Harold’s trousers. Harold wonders what his dad is going to do. Is he going to fuck Harold, like he did that little boy? Will he kill Harold tonight? Harold hopes not. He doesn’t want to leave Draco alone, no matter how happy it would make his dad. Harold remembers how Rodolph had enjoyed watching the boy die. But dad had promised mom that he wouldn’t hurt Harold. Sure killing him falls under hurting him. So Harold shouldn’t worry and just enjoy the attention he’s getting.
“Place the rope around your son’s neck,” Bellatrix says. The woman obeys without question. She’s completely in Bellatrix’s control. Bellatrix comments her to pull the rope tight.
“Good,” Uncle Lucius says. And that seals it. The woman won’t die tonight. It’s a shame. Harold would have loved to see how she would find her end. But Rodolph won’t spoil Harry’s birthday sleepover by upsetting Lucius. Because that would mean that Lucius will drag Draco home with him.
“Patience, my child. We first have a job to do. Then you can show me your devotion.” The Dark Lord steps away, he opens the small gate to the cottage that is the Potter’s home. Bellatrix looks over the dark hedge, into the window and watches the Potters play with their child. Potter makes puffs and coloured smoke erupt from his wand. The boy laughs and giggles from joy. Bellatrix pulls out her wand and clenches it in her hand. Her vision is clouded when she follows her Lord into the house. The Potters will pay for all they have done, for what they have taken from her, tonight Bellatrix will get her revenge.
The man laughs again. “He’s got something I want,” he says. With force, Dean is turned onto his side. He screams in agony as the sword moves around in his body.
“I didn’t get to finish before when I killed your dead hero. So you will do,” Voldemort says. The Death Eaters laugh as Voldemort pushes his lid into Neville’s hole without any preparation. Neville screams as his anus tears. He’s forced to look at his friends, as he can’t move a single muscle in his body. Hermione and Ginny hold on to each other as they cry. And Luna hides her face in Dean’s shoulder. Neville had wanted to ask her out, and now he will never get the change. Instead, he will be raped and murdered in front of her.
“Just be glad they started with a peacock and not themselves,” Bellatrix answers. Her hand pets Harold’s hair. Harold doesn’t understand. Why would they do this to themselves? There is no way he would hurt Draco. And Draco would never hurt Harold. They are best friends.
Rodolph and Bellatrix say nothing else. They both take their own pieces of cake and start eating. Harold finishes his own and then lounges in the chair he’s in. It’s comfy and Harold starts to drift off a little.
“What do you think our fathers are up to now?” Draco asks. They are all staying the night too. Uncle Lucius, Mr Goyle and Mr Crabbe. Rodolph promised them some good entertainment. Harold thinks it’s the Muggle lady that has been chained in the basement for the last month. Mother had her fun with her. Harold has heard the woman scream and beg.
Draco shakes his head. “I’ll take that as a no. You’ll like it before the end, I promise.” It’s the perfect revenge, taking Potter’s virginity moments before the boy dies. Degrading him to a fuck toy instead of the hero everyone thinks he is.
Rodolph laughs gently. He strokes a hair from Harold’s face. “You’re special. I don’t want to hurt you. But one day, I promise.”
“Mommy put an Imperos curse,” Harold starts. He knows he says it wrong but it’s a difficult word. He hopes Draco understands.
Dean’s head starts to pound as he shivers in his blood. His skin is pale and clammy. He can’t stop the shivering that is only becoming worse. He’s so cold, and nothing seems to warm him anymore. His headache worsens and he can only take short quick breaths. They don’t feel enough. It’s harder and harder to breathe.
Rodolph releases Bellatrix her hands and she sits up to kiss Rodolph. “That was amazing,” she tells him. Then she pushes him on his back and motions for Harold to come to sit in between her and Rodolph.
Spells and charms fly around her head. She can see the green and red flashes. People scream and move. Somewhere in the distance, Ron yells at Hermione. He orders her to move. But why would she? All hope died when Harry stepped into the forest and got himself killed. What good does it do that the snake is dead? The only one capable of stopping Voldemort is gone. The war is lost. And Hermione can’t move because of it. The last year of hardship has all been for nothing. And now they are all going to die.
“Wow,” Draco says. “I wish I could have seen it. Father never lets me watch when he kills Muggles. He says it’s no good for me.”
“Goodbye my boy,” Narcissa says as she covers the hole with the ground. Then she points her wand at the tree. With care, she engraves Draco’s name and a final goodbye. Small tears fall from her eyes as the gravity of her loss takes root in her mind. The Malfoy line has ended. Her family is all gone and her purpose stolen away. There is no reason for her to still be here. No reason to go on, only to feel the pain of her loss every day. It was bad enough to live without Lucius. Living without Draco will be hell. Worse than hell. She will be better off showing the world what following the Dark Lord truly means.
“You bastard,” Potter spits. Draco looks at him and wonders how Potter will scream when he finds out what is coming now. The Dark Lord steps up behind Draco and places his hand on Draco’s crotch. It pushes against Draco’s cock and Draco can feel it harden by its touch. Some might say he’s the Dark Lord’s fuck toy, but Draco knows better. The Dark Lord can’t keep his hands of him, and one day, that will give Draco the advantage to take his place, to become the one everyone fears.
Greg lays down next to Draco and sighs. “Mother and Father fought before we came here. She said that Rodolphus is a bad influence or something.”
Hours later, Harold wakes in his warm bed with his resting father next to him. Harold smiles and can’t help it, but he’s sure he’s the most fortunate boy on this planet.
Draco smiles. “You’re lucky. I never get to see anything interesting. Mother always wants to protect me, and father doesn’t like me.”
Dean pulls the sword out a little and then pushes even harder against the place that stopped him before. Some bones snap and Dean falls forwards as his legs give out. He can’t feel them anymore, but that’s okay. He doesn’t need his legs as he’s going to bleed to death. It will be perfect.
Rodolph steps next to Harold and places his hand on his shoulder. “Your mother and I thought it was about time you learnt the pleasure of torturing a Muggle. As an extra birthday gift.” Rodolph’s hand slides from Harold’s shoulder down his side and stops on his ass. “And maybe I can have you while you do,” he says.
“Don’t tell father,” Draco says after some time. “He will get angry. He definitely doesn’t like you.”
Bellatrix shakes her head and places a kiss on Harold’s forehead. “Nobody you need to worry about,” she answers.
“Fuck, she’s hot,” Barty says. He pulls her up from the floor and lays her next to her dead boy on the kitchen island. He opens his trousers and pulls out his hard cock. He trusts into her and moans. Rabastan steps behind him and pulls Barty’s trousers down. He says a spell Harold doesn’t know and then slides his hand over his cock and Barty’s arsehole. Without warning, he pushes into Barty, who turns around and kisses Rabastan.
The Dark Lord tells the woman that this is his last warning, but she doesn’t listen. She keeps begging him to spare the child, to have mercy. The Dark Lord shakes his head and turns to Bellatrix.
“If Draco stayed over, I wouldn’t be able to come to bed with you,” Rodolph says with a grin on his face.
“You’re beautiful,” he says with awe. He takes Draco’s arm and pulls him on top of him. Their lips collide as Harold lets his hands roam over Draco’s naked body. Draco wriggles his hands in between them and unbuckles Harold’s trousers and pushes them together with Harold’s pants down to his knees. When Draco takes a hold of Harold’s sweater, Harold sits them upright and lifts his arms in the sky. Draco pulls the sweater over Harold’s head. Their mouths only splitting for the short second it takes for the sweater to pass it. Harold’s hand travel down Draco’s body. He lets his fingers slide down Draco’s hole. He pushes against it a little. Draco is hard against his stomach. Harold wants to make him enjoy himself, just like how Harold enjoys it when his dad fucks him into oblivion.
The four boys get up and go to find their fathers. They don’t have to look for long, as the muffled screams of a young woman and the laughs of their fathers lead the way. They are in one of the hallways with stairs. Harold and the other boys sit down with their legs through the railings of the balcony that looks down on that hallway. The woman is naked and sits on the floor. Uncle Lucius turns his wand and the woman quivers. Her arms and legs give out and she convulses on the floor. Her mouth is open in an agonising scream.
Bellatrix lifts the Imperius curse and the woman drops the rope inimitably. She kneels and takes the boy’s head in her hands. “My boy, oh, my boy. I’m sorry. I couldn’t stop it. I’m sorry,” she cries.
“You didn’t think you would get away, just because I had to interrupt your execution because of the traitor Malfoy brad?” Voldemort says.
“I’m ready,” Harold declares. He watches as Bellatrix pulls a long black scarf from her dresser and then joins them on the bed. Rodolph kisses her and then takes his wand from the bedside table. Bellatrix lays down on her back and then lets Rodolph use Incarcerous to bind her hands to the headboard. Harold sits down next to her and watches as Rodolph pulls the scarf around Bellatrix her neck. He kisses her and lets his hands roam over her body. Then he moves his mouth down her throat, over her breasts, until he reaches her thighs.
Dean lands with his face in the dirt and the sword goes all the way through his body. The top sticks out at his back. Dean looks to the side and watches as people run around him, towards the castle.
Bellatrix shakes her head. “Oh, I know just what to do with you,” she says. Bellatrix points her wand at the woman and whispers ‘Imperius’. The woman stops her pointless begging and just stands in front of her son. Bellatrix takes one of the ropes from Barty and hands them to the woman.
“Harry Potter is dead,” Voldemort proclaims. “Giant spam, put him down here, underneath my feet, where the boy belongs.”
Draco steps away from Harold and gives him a mocking look. “I thought you liked me being obsessed with death,” he says.
Bellatrix laughs as she pets the woman’s hair. “You’re a good girl, giving my husband precisely what he wants.”
Bellatrix steps out of the way when the man takes the knife without saying a word. He steps behind his wife, pulls her head back and then slits the knife over her throat. Blood starts rushing out of the cut. Bellatrix breaks the Imperius curse and the woman’s eyes widen. She tries to take a step away from her dead son and her hands fly to her throat. She gurgles up blood and spit. Her husband pushes her head away from him and she falls forward on top of the dead boy. She lays still for a little while and then she makes a strange noise. She pisses herself and then she slides down from the kitchen island, landing face-up on the floor. Harold looks in awe at the dead woman. Her eyes have the same white sheen as the boy.
All adults in the room laugh. “Oh, poor girl. Do you think we care about you, or your Muggle offspring?” Bellatrix tells her.
Sharp teeth scrape over Hermione’s shoulder. They are followed by a tongue that licks away the first drops of blood. Hermione closes her eyes and just hopes this will all be over soon.
For some time, both Rodolph and Rabastan fuck their two dying victims. Harold can’t look away from the boy. His struggles start to die down, his hands hardly lift up anymore and his legs go limp next to Rodolph’s hips. His body starts to shake uncontrollably and his tongue slowly swells out of his mouth. It’s fascinating and Harold wishes he could get closer so he could tough the young boy.
“You want me to kiss it better?” Harold asks. He doesn’t wait for a response, bents down a little and places a soft peck on Draco’s finger.
Rodolph comes inside Harold as the woman dies. Harold squeals and his eyes glow. Even with the constant dizziness of his cut off breath, he feels alive and ready to go all over again. The woman’s eyes get that white glean all dead people get. They stare into nothing and Harold longs to kiss them.
“Let’s make this a game, see who dies first,” Barty says. He places the second rope around the neck of the man that uncle Rabastan is fucking. The man’s eyes fly open when Barty pulls the rope tight. He starts to put op a fight, only uncle Rabastan shakes his head and puts him under a spell. His body goes stiff, the only evidence that he’s struggling visibly on his face. His eyes are wide and his mouth is open. Tears fall over his cheeks.
“I know you can,” Rodolph laughs as he starts to takes large steps up the stairs. “But you’re so slow and I can’t wait.”
“Yes, the same much,” Harold states and then he runs through the hallway. He stops in front of his parents' bedroom door and looks behind him. Rodolph nods his head with a smile on his face. Harold opens the door en walks into the large bedroom. He jumps on the bed and pulls his shirt over his head. The shirt falls somewhere on the floor where Rodolph picks it up, folds it needly and places it on the dresser.
“I told you fuckers that it was a trap!” she screams at the others. Rabastan and Rodolph stare at her, their eyes wide. Barty stands beside them, his lips trembles. Bellatrix knows it’s up to her now. If they stay here, they will go to jail. They need to get away and make sure that no-one will touch them. Her eyes dart back to the little boy. It would be the perfect revenge. They took her child, so now she will take theirs and raise it as her own. Nobody will dare to harm them as long as they have the boy.
With his free hand, Rodolph takes his wand and whispers a spell Harold has only heard once before when uncle Rabastan fucked Barty who was fucking the dead woman. Rodolph’s fingers that slide between Harold’s crack become slick and slide more comfortably. One of them pushes against Harold’s hole. It’s a strange feeling, but it seems to turn on his dad so Harold lets him.
Bellatrix stands up and pockets her Lord’s wand. She lifts the boy from his cot and holds him close to her chest. “Don’t worry, my son. You are safe now,” she says.
Rodolph’s free hand slides over Harold’s chest, opening it so it fits over Harold’s throat. Rodolph closes his hand over it and Harold gasps. His eyes lock with Rodolph’s and he smiles. The world around him begins to spin as pleasure takes over. Harold spasms under Rodolph, experiencing his first orgasm. Rodolph follows after him, emptying his cock in Harold’s hole. Harold feels the sperm inside him and smiles. He’s ready to die now. He closes his eyes and lets the darkness take over, already dreaming of the next time his dad will fuck him.
His teeth take hold of Hermione’s other shoulder and tear more flesh away. It hurts like hell and makes Hermione forget the pain of the dick that still trust into her with rapid speed. Blood trickles down from her shoulders onto the ground, mixing with the blood that spilt from Narcissa when Greyback had sliced her open. Hermione stares at it in disbelief. Is she going to get eaten alive? Is this how her life will end?
Narcissa’s head starts to hurt the longer she hangs. Her toes slide over the ground, but find no purpose and no relieve for the pain that threatens to burst Narcissa’s head apart. Her body struggles and tears leak freely. The pain is so intense. Narcissa never thought it would hurt this much to die. She wants it to stop. She wants it to be over now. But it just goes on. She needs to stand, needs to find some higher ground to place her feet. Her toes slide over the ground, just too high to stand on, to find some relief. There is no relieve. Narcissa will die. She doesn’t want to die. What if she isn’t reunited with Lucius and Draco? What if she goes to hell and will suffer for all eternity? She can’t do that.
Harry can’t believe his eyes. One moment Malfoy seemed to be Voldemort’s lover and confidant. The next, a knife slides his throat open like he’s nothing. The Death Eaters around them cheer and applause, they don’t seem to mind that their lord just killed one of them in cold blood. Blood spurts onto Harry turning his skin dark red. Malfoy looks at him and then convulses inside him, filling Harry with his sperm as he slowly dies. Harry closes his eyes and hopes his end will come soon. He thought when he walked into the forbidden forest tonight, that it would be quick. Voldemort would see him and cast the killing curse, and that will be it. But instead, he’s been tortured and raped. Humiliated and used. And it was all for nothing. Voldemort won’t keep his word. He won’t stop this war and let Harry’s friends and family life. They will all die knowing Harry left them to fend for themselves.
“Please,” Draco says. It’s all Harold needs to lower his hand further down, so it’s cupping Draco’s buttocks to squeeze it.
I'm so sorry it took me forever to update this. I struggled a little with where I wanted to start and what I wanted to include. I hope you all enjoy this. And I promise I won't take this long to get the next chapter up and running.
As quiet as Harold can, he gets out of bed and pulls on a bathrobe. Carefully he opens his bedroom door and listens if he can hear anything. The house is quiet. Harold smiles and walks out into the hallway. On his tiptoes, he walks down the first flight of stairs. He will take the servant route from there on, that way he won’t run into mom or dad. Harold opens the small door at the end of the hallway and walks into a dark and narrow hallway. He knows this hallway opens up in a little bit into the upper flight of the kitchen. It will allow him to see if any of the elves are still busy there before he goes down and gets his milk.
Bellatrix leans over Harold and whispers in his ear. “Don’t worry, we won’t hurt you. You will feel how amazing it is. Daddy will love it.”
It doesn’t take long before Voldemort comes inside him with an awful moan. Neville is left sitting on his hands and knees as Voldemort slides out of his abused hole and stands up. He continues with his speech as if he didn’t just rape a schoolboy in front of everyone. Neville fights the body bind curse with all his might, but he just can’t move. He can’t stop this man from taking his life. He’s as weak as his grandmother always told him he was, as useless as Snape had always known.
Rodolph walks them all the way to Harold’s room and lays Harold down on his bed. Harold giggles as his dad leans over him and starts to kiss his head and ears.
Harry doesn’t have to think about it. He’s the hero, isn’t he? Out to save everyone. He might have died in vain. But he won’t let anyone else suffer for the mistakes he made. With determination, he moves passed Malfoy and boards the black train. He turns as soon as he’s onboard to see Malfoy fall backwards. His eyes are wide and unbelieving as the door shuts in front of Harry. The train starts to move and Harry knows he did the right thing. Draco will go to heaven and finally have peace. Harry doesn’t know why, but he’s sure he would have never found it there, knowing what would have happened to Draco.
“Stop it! Let go of me,” Hermione screams. She tries to place her hands on Greyback’s chest to get some leverage so she can push away from him. Only, it’s no use.
Harold nods and then follows his father out of the room. Rodolph puts him to bed and pulls the covers over him.
“Don’t you speak ill of my son,” Bellatrix spits out. “Just because you are to chicken to kill anyone now that our Lord has gone, doesn’t mean we all need to stop having fun. And I can assure you, Harold enjoyed watching, and I’m sure Draco would even more. Didn’t you just see him look at the dead peacock?”
Bellatrix moves closer and pushes some of Harold’s hair out of his face. “You’re daddy loved it. Did you like it too?”
“And I’m yours,” Draco says. Draco lifts his hand and slides it into Harold’s hair. He pulls Harold closer and their lips touch again. Harold could do this all day. Just kiss Draco and be happy. It’s better than kissing dad. Not that Harold will ever tell Rodolph this, it will break his heart to know that Harold loves someone more than he loves him. But Harold does. He loves Draco more than anything else in this world. And he always will.
“What does mom like?” Rodolph asks as he lets go of Harold’s head. Harold falls back onto the pillows and thinks.
“Yes, my dear. I’m fantastic. We’ve saved our son from those awful Potter’s that had kidnapped him. Now let’s go home so we can start to search for our Lord.”
“Dad, stop it,” Harold says. “You know it’s not going to happen. Draco is mine.” He pulls Draco’s face towards him and kisses him deeply.
The Crucio lifts and Potter tries to stand up. Draco turns his wand and Potter falls back to the ground.
“You’re beautiful,” Rodolph says when he pulls his fingers out and gets rid of his robe. He’s naked underneath it, already hard and leaking for Harold.
Aunt Bella hands her knife to the Dark Lord. The Dark Lord pushes Draco’s back firmly against his chest and holds him in place with his other hand on Draco’s chest.
“Mom will know that spell. And say it’s no fun if it kills quickly,” Harold says. He should ask Bellatrix about it. She knows all the cool spells. She promised she will teach Harold as soon as he’s got his own wand. It’s a shame he first needs to turn eleven before he gets one. That’s still three and a half years away.
“Yes, my Lord. It’s too easy, too simple. They’ve been hiding for over a year and now we just get their address handed on a silver platter. I don’t trust it.”
Harold smiles and puts his hand on Draco’s. They haven’t seen each other since Christmas. Mother and uncle Lucius had a massive fight, after which uncle Lucius took Draco and aunt Narcissa home shouting they will never set foot in this house again. Of course, that didn’t last, but Harold was scared none the less. How was he supposed to go on without Draco? The idea still brings tears to his eyes.
After Mr Goyle, uncle Lucius fucks her. And then they torture her some more. Mr Goyle uses a spell that slashes her skin. And then he turns her around again. He fucks her ass as he starts to bang her head against the stone floor. Harold is hard from the sight. Draco notices and he slides his hand over Harold’s erection. His tongue licks over the side of Harold’s neck.
“Nobody places themselves above me, not even in their thoughts,” the Dark Lord says. With a swift movement, the Dark Lord pulls the sharp blade of the knife across Draco’s throat. It gets slit open and blood shoots out over Potter’s chest and face. A terrified scream comes from Draco’s side. It’s his mother. Draco doesn’t have the strength to look at her. His eyes are fixed on Potter as his body shakes and trashes. The shock in Potter’s eyes is amazing and pushes Draco over the edge. He releases inside Potter as his vision starts to blur. His arms begin to shake and Draco coughs up blood in his struggle to find a breath. His head begins to spin, his eyes roll to the back of his head and the world turns black.
“I love it when you torture, my dear,” he says. His hand slides over Bellatrix her stomach, moving downward and in between her legs. A hard cock pushes against her ass and Bellatrix her breathing becomes more erratic by the minute. Rodolph's fingers push against her clit, while his other hand tightens around her throat. Bellatrix doesn’t take her eyes and wand of the woman screaming in pain in front of her. She moans as she feels her climax approaching. A delighted laugh from her Lord pushes her over the edge. Pleasure raises through her body as a green light fills the room. Potter’s wife’s stops moving, her eyes stare into nothing and Bellatrix laughs.
“Don’t be a prude, Potter. Open wide for me and maybe we’ll make it quick and painful,” Draco tells him. Aunt Bella laughs from his side and Draco shakes his head. He knows he’s given the Death Eaters around them a nice show. It won’t be the first time, and probably also not the last. Depending on how many prisoners they will be taking tonight. Draco hopes Granger survives. He would love to see his aunt torture her again. And maybe Draco can take her too, fuck her until she begs for it to stop. The Mudblood deserves to die a horrible death for all the times she made Draco look like a fool in school.
Draco holds up his finger. A small trickle of blood runs down it. Harold takes a hold on the finger and looks at it.
Draco nods and steps forward. He lifts Potter’s face and spits on it. “You will beg for mercy before the end,” Draco tells him.
Bellatrix follows the Dark Lord at a distance. Something feels off about this mission. That slime Pettigrew was a little too eager to give up the location of the Potters. But ever since Snape told the Dark Lord about the stupid prophecy the man has been obsessed with finding the Potters and ending their lives once and for all. Not even Bellatrix has been able to distract the man anymore.
“The Longbottom child,” Bellatrix informs Voldemort. Neville wants to get up and curse that bitch. She’s the reason his parents are gone, forever locked in St. Mungo. But his body hurts and he doesn’t think he can move.
“Open your eyes, baby,” Greyback tells her. Hermione refuses. She doesn’t need to see Narcissa’s body in front of her. She doesn’t want to know what Greyback plans to do next.
Greyback smiles at Hermione. “Why would I. It’s a shame to waste some nice Mudblood meat,” he says. He looks around and Hermione wonders what got his attention. Without warning, Greyback starts to walk. He drags Hermione along with him by her hair. Hermione has no option but to stumble after him.
The Dark Lord laughs and slows down. “Have faith, my child. The traitor is legit. I’ve looked into his mind. His fear for his own life is greater than his loyalty to his friends.”
Hermione tries to reach inside her pocket to get her wand. She gets a hold of it and pulls it out. Only her hands tremble and she can’t get a clear view of Greyback as she stumbles along. She raises the wand and tries to cast a curse at her attacker. The curse flies past Greyback, who stops in his tracks.
“It’s my fault,” Harry says. “I’m sorry, Malfoy,” he tells the other boy. Then he turns to look at Dumbledore again. “If it hadn’t been for me, he would never have killed you,” Harry says. “He doesn’t deserve to pay for that for the rest of eternity.”
“We should go see,” Harold says. He would like to watch when the woman finds her end. Not that Harold is sure she will die tonight. If uncle Rabastan and Barty would have been here, it was an inevitable conclusion. But with Uncle Lucius, you never know.
They don’t hear the door to the room open. Or see how Rodolph takes off his clothes as he watches the boys make out. It isn’t until the bed dips when he sits on it that the boys look up and spot him. Harold sits up and holds out his hand in an invitation for Rodolph to join them. Rodolph takes his hand and moves closer so he can kiss Harold. His hands slide over Harold’s body, just like Draco’s. Harold breaks the kiss and turns his head so he can kiss Draco again. Rodolph kisses his neck and back and then moves up again. Harold turns his head to find Rodolph’s lips.
They both smile at each other and Harold wonders what would happen if he would lean in closer and kiss Draco. They love each other, just like how Harold and his dad love each other. It’s what you do when you’re in love, when you want to show the other person how much you care. And Harold wants Draco to know that he cares. That he will always care.
Green light explodes around the room. Bellatrix is slammed backwards. She and Rodolph fall through the wall that crumbles behind them. Black smoke fills the room. A horrible scream passes them and then the world goes black.
The Dark Lord stops and caresses Bellatrix’s cheek. He pushes her chin up and smiles. “You’re my loyal servant, I would expect no less of you than to worry when needed,” he says before he rests his lips on Bellatrix mouth. The kiss is short and when the Dark Lord pulls away Bellatrix can’t help but follow his face with hers.
Harold can’t help but laugh a little. “You will scream for me,” Harold says. “You will cry and trash until I’m done with you.”
“You’re the most beautiful of all,” Rodolph says before his lips touch Harold’s chest. Rodolph’s tongue slides over one of Harold’s nipples and Harold giggles.
“Fuck,” Draco utters. Harold understands. You don’t talk about your husband like that. It’s a dangerous thing to say. Draco’s mom once said it when his dad had given Draco a bad beating. She walked around with trembling limps for weeks. Harold doesn’t want to know how many Cruciatus curses she had to endure. Neither does Draco. She never talked about leaving after that. Mother thinks aunt Narcissa is weak, that she should have given uncle Lucius what he deserves. She doesn’t like Lucius, thinks he’s a coward and a fool. And Harold tends to agree with her. The man can’t see how amazing his son is, and that just baffles Harold.
Hermione can’t move. She’s rooted to the spot. Her mouth hangs open as she stares at the scene in front of her. Harry is naked, covered in blood and death. Neville is black and burned, just as dead as Harry. And Dean lays face down on the ground with the blade of the sword of Gryffindor sticking out of his back. Hermione had watched in horror when Voldemort ordered Dean to impale himself. For some time Dean seemed to like it. Until Ron attacked Voldemort and the spell was broken. A horrible cry had come from Dean. And now he lays silent in his own blood. If he isn’t dead yet, he will be soon. And there is nothing Hermione can do to stop it.
“Fuck me, daddy,” Harold says when he lays a knot in the rope around the woman’s throat. Just tight enough to make it difficult for her to breathe, but not enough to strangle her completely. Rodolph obliges and Harold moans as his dad’s cock slides into his hole. He always feels so full when his father fucks him. It’s the best feeling in the world. And doing while torturing the woman in front of him makes it even better. Harold wants to see this woman die by his own hands. See the life leave her because of what he does to her.
But all had gone so differently. Harry is dead. And it won’t be long before Neville follows him. Dean came back to see the end of the war, but it isn’t turning into the end he thought. It’s turning into a defeat. A start of a world where he isn’t welcome and will be killed if they catch him.
Rage boils in Narcissa. Her sister wouldn’t understand. She never had a child of her own. She doesn’t know what it feels like to lose the one person you promised to protect with your life. The one person Narcissa failed to protect. She should have died, not her boy. Not her beautiful talented boy. He had so much potential. And now he’s just gone. And Bellatrix thinks it’s all okay, that she can now mock Draco as if he was nothing.
The crying continues and Harry walks towards the sound. A little bench appears in front of him. Another person stands next to it, looking down at a bundle of fabric underneath it.
“Yes, fight it. You’re so beautiful, my boy. Taking my cock deep throat,” Rodolph says. He pushes up further into Harold’s throat. Bellatrix laughs next to him as Harold’s world starts to spin. He can’t breathe. And his head hurts. His body shakes, he tries to stay still, but he can’t stop it. His legs slide to the side and tremble. He lays belly down on the bed, his mother on top of him and his dad’s cock in his mouth. He’s going to die now, he’s sure. His parents will kill him to find their pleasure. And maybe that isn’t a bad way to go. That way his parents will always know how much Harold loved them.
“Snape wasn’t innocent, he was a spy,” Malfoy says. “You would have done the same if it was one of ours.”
“Shh, it’s okay,” Rodolph says. “Just relax and the pain will go away,” he tells Harold. “You’re a good boy, so beautiful.”
Greyback pulls Hermione closer and kisses her lips. Hermione spits against them. Greyback laughs and then pulls her against his body. “This is just the beginning, baby,” he says. He places his arm tightly around Hermione’s waist to keep her in place.
In the meantime, Bellatrix has stopped the Cruciatus curse and pulls the woman towards her son’s face. “Do you think he likes it?” she asks the woman. The woman just cries and shakes her head.
The woman gets turned onto her back and Mr Goyle takes his turn to rape her. He fucks her hard in her vagina. His hands roam over her breasts. The woman seems to have given up all hope. She doesn’t fight the men anymore. She just lays there and lets them rape her.
“You can’t leave me here, Potter,” Malfoy says. He looks at Harry with pleading eyes. The fear that had haunted Malfoy’s eyes in sixth year, before Harry attacked him is back. The fear he had before he became a killer and a devoted Death Eater. Before Harry almost killed him. If only Harry had never used that spell. If only he could take it all back and help Malfoy keep his soul clean.
Harold nods and slides of the bed with his trousers in his hand. He folds it and gives it to Rodolph so he can place it on the dresser. Rodolph smiles at him and then lifts him back onto the bed.
“Come now, Draco,” Lucius shouts and Draco hurries after him. Harold doesn’t want to know what kind of punishment Draco is going to get. He hopes uncle Lucius won’t hit him like he did last time.
“Oh, no you don’t, baby,” he says. With a swift move, he pulls Hermione’s wand out of her hand and drops it on the ground. He smashes the wand with his foot. Hermione stares at it with disbelief. Her last hope of escaping just got destroyed. There is no way Hermione will be able to fight Greyback with her bare hands.
Rodolph smiles at Bellatrix as he opens his trousers and takes out his cock. Harold can’t stop looking at it as his father pushes it inside the young boy’s ass. The boy screams and Rodolph laughs. “Oh, you’re a good boy. Nice and tight. Just the way I like it,” he says. Harold is fascinated by the scene, the blissful look on his fathers face, the moans escaping his mouth, as he fucks into the young boy. The boy cries and tries to push Rodolph away from him. And then uncle Rabastan takes his cock out and pushes it into the unconscious man. His rhythm in sync with Rodolph’s. The brothers smile at each other as they fuck their unwilling victims.
Draco blushes and then looks away. “My father would never let me kill someone. He thinks I’m too obsessed with death.”
Hagrid lowers Harry’s body with care and arranges his hand so that it hides his naked crotch. Voldemort laughs as he waves his hand. The Death Eaters holding the ropes that hold Hagrid pull Hagrid to the side.
Harold and Draco sneak behind the peacock. It walks slowly around the rose bed, passed a hedge into a small secluded courtyard. It’s perfect. If they can do it here, nobody will see and they might not get into trouble. Because Draco’s father will be furious when he finds out that one of his precious peacocks has been murdered by his son and nephew.
“Now pull,” Harold says. Both boys pull on the rope, enclosing it around the peacock’s neck. The bird starts to trash around, opens it’s feathers and gives some loud screams. They pull a little harder and then the screams stop. The bird’s feet leave the ground and Draco starts to laugh. It’s funny to see how the bird tries to place it’s feet on something solid, only to find air around it. And the head keeps turning around. It’s not the same as the boy, but it’s just as fascinating. But the most beautiful is the big grin on Draco’s face.
“There is no need to hide the state in which this traitor died. He tried to sneak away. Leave you all for dead. But my Death Eaters caught him and showed him what we do with cowards,” Voldemort laughs. “At least he didn’t die a virgin.”
Harold nods and slides of the chair. Binky appears next to him and hands him the drawing he made this afternoon. With shaking fingers Harold takes it and hands it over to his dad. Rodolph smiles as he removes the ribbon around the parchment. He unrolls it and then his eyes twinkle. Harold smiles. He knew his dad would love his painting.
“Yes,” Harold says. He’d fucked him this morning. With gentle movements and his lips exploring Harold’s body. And then he’s put his hand on Harold’s throat and choked Harold until Rodolph’s sperm had filled Harold’s ass. It was nice.
His parents stop kissing and they both stare at Harold. Harold pretends he doesn’t notice, but he can’t help to look up at them from time to time.
“You will be sorted into Slytherin, or you will die,” Voldemort says. “It’s the risk every current and new student will take from now on. Only wizards and witches worthy of their magic will be trained.”
And now it’s Rodolph’s birthday. Uncle Rabastan and Barty have stayed for dinner, promising to bring dad’s birthday present this coming weekend. Harold isn’t sure, but he did hear them mentioning twins. Harold wishes he wasn’t going to be staying with Draco during the weekend. He’s sure that his dad will get twin boys to kill, and Harold would love to see it.
Fuck this. They're all already dead. With Harry gone, there is no more hope. It was destroyed the moment Harry listened to that liar and went into that forest to die. They all should have known Harry would do it, that he would believe Voldemort when he promised to leave them alive if Harry would give himself up. And now there is nobody alive that will be able to kill Voldemort. Not if that bloody prophecy is true. And Neville knows enough about prophecies to not doubt them.
And that is how they do it. Harold holds his end of the rope and goes to stand about a meter away from the white peacock. Draco runs around the bird, shouts for Harold to duck when he passes him so the rope goes over Harold’s head, and then comes to a stop on the other side of the peacock.
“His loss, you're great.” Harold puts his hand on Draco’s and squeezes them lightly. “Best friend I’ve ever had.”
“Tell me if it hurts too much,” Harold tells him. “I want you to enjoy this.” They look at each other and Draco nods. He’s got his bottom lip beneath his teeth. Harold hopes Draco will bite hard enough on them to make them bleed. He wants to taste Draco’s blood when he kisses him next.
The green light races towards Harry. He smiles as it hits him and he drops to the ground. He made it to the end.
Their conversation comes to a stop when an agonising scream is heard from outside. Neville shivers as the meaning of that scream settles inside his mind. If Professor McGonagall lets out a scream like that, the words most have been true. Harry Potter is dead.
Potter whispers something. It sounds like Draco’s name. His first name. Only Draco isn’t sure. Darkness enfolds Draco as he drifts away from this world forever.
“A bit impatient, aren’t we,” the Dark Lord says. “Why the rush? You will only die once. Don’t you want to enjoy that moment?”
“I think it’s time you go back to bed,” Rodolph says from beside Harold. Harold hadn’t noticed Rodolph coming up the stairs, he was too fixed on everything happening in the kitchen.
Bellatrix shakes Rodolph’s arm off her. She steps away from him and tries to ignore the laughs of Rabastan and Barty behind her. She loves these men, but the high they’ve all been on since the Dark Lord had taken over the Ministry was going to get them all killed one day.
Bellatrix walks over to Rodolph and looks at the painting. “He’s a special boy, isn’t he?” she says.
Rodolph lets go of Harold’s throat and Harold spins his head around so he can kiss his dad. He just gave Harold the best birthday present anyone could ever wish for.
When Harold is naked, Bellatrix walks into the room. She smiles at her boys and then undresses. Harold stares at his mother. He’s never seen her naked before. Her breasts are larger than the woman they killed that night. Her hair falls around them as she steps behind Rodolph and starts to unbutton his trousers.
“We can pull it around the peacock’s neck so you can see how it works. I know it’s not the same, but it should be close shouldn’t it?”
Sure, Dean thinks. It makes perfect sense to him to turn the sword and point the tip at this stomach. He looks at it as he pushes it into his body. Blood starts to tickle the further Dean pushes. It’s weird in a way. Dean sees the sword going into him, but he can’t feel it. There is no pain. Dean is invincible. He laughs and looks back at Voldemort, who smiles at him.
As Harry moves closer the person comes into focus and Harry recognises the platinum hair and the dark mark on the left arm. The person is Malfoy.
A zipper opens and moments later Greyback’s huge cock pushes into Hermione’s pussy. There is no gentle strokes or time for Hermione to adjust to the intrusion. Greyback slams into her, over and over again.
Draco opens up for Harold’s small fingers. One finger becomes two, which become three. Before they know it Harold has his entire hand inside Draco’s tiny hole. Draco moans as Harold takes his cock in his mouth. His free hand slides over Draco’s chest until he reaches Draco’s throat. He squeezes it lightly.
Harold has no time to think of what Bellatrix means. She pushes his head further onto Rodolph’s cock. It pushes into Harold’s throat. He tries to cough, but he can’t. He can’t breathe and he panics a little. He starts to hit around with his arms, but that only makes Rodolph laugh.
Bellatrix starts to laugh. “You think our Dark Lord thought Barty was deranged? Is that why he preferred his company over yours? You’re delusional, Lucius.”
“I can’t,” he stutters. “Please don’t make me.” Tears start to fall from his eyes and Harry wants to reach out and pull Malfoy back towards him, closer to the white train.
“Nobody’s eating today,” Dean says. He smiles at Voldemort who’s enraged. Dean has no idea what came over him, or why he feels so giddily now. “Guess you need to find a new pet.”
Harold gasps when a scarf winds itself around his neck. He didn’t notice Rodolph casting the spell. The scarf tightens, cutting off Harold’s air supply. He keeps bucking on top of Rodolph and he takes his cock in his hand and pumps it up and down. His head starts to spin and his legs start to tremble. He opens his mouth wide to try to find some air, but it’s no use. He’s going to suffocate before he comes. It’s his punishment for watching Draco instead of his dad. But Harold can’t help it. His boyfriend is the most beautiful thing on this planet. Harold never wants to lose him, but at the same time, he wants to kill him. He wants to feel that pleasure again. The trill of the kill. And how amazing will that be when it’s Draco that takes his last breath because of him.
Harold runs through the garden towards Draco, who sits close to the rose patch. Mom had opened the door for Harold and told him to go play so the grown-ups can talk. Harold didn’t mind, he’d been wanting to go see Draco for days now. He wants to tell him all about what he’d seen on his midnight stroll.
Harold lets go of Draco’s hand and sits down next to him. Draco reaches for the roses again. He pushes his thump against a thorn until it breaks his skin. Harold knows it’s stupid to try and stop Draco. He will hurt himself for the fun of it. And Dobby will heal his wounds if they get too severe. The elf must be close by, he always is. Harold looks around but doesn’t spot him.
“Oh, my boy. Didn’t your daddy teach you? Never trust the evil Lord. He lies,” the Dark Lord laughs. “Oh wait, I killed him before you even knew how to walk. What a shame.”
It’s the right thing to say. Draco smiles and then lets himself fall back onto the bed. “Promise me you’ll never get angry with me,” Draco says.
“Yeah, please,” Rodolph answers. And then his lustful eyes are back on Harold. He moves forward and pushes Harold further onto the bed. Makes him lay down against the pillows. Rodolph lays down next to him and turns Harold on his side. Rodolph his arm slides around his back and strokes Harold’s buttocks. It pushes Harold’s front against Rodolph’s side. The man turns his head and kisses Harold. Harold opens his mouth to let his dad’s tongue slide inside. Rodolph moans in his mouth when Bellatrix sits down between his legs and takes his cock into her mouth.
“I don’t know, I just know that I’m here to tell him that he can go back if he wants to,” Dumbledore says.
Greyback’s eyes glitter as he scrapes his claws over Hermione’s face, slicing the skin open and making Hermione bleed. He leans down and licks the blood of Hermione’s face.
Harold nods, that’s good, that means nobody will overhear him. But just in case someone else is close, Harold leans towards Draco and starts to whisper. “I saw something cool,” he starts.
Rodolph slides a slick finger into Harold’s ass and Harold leans against his dad’s chest for a second, enjoying the feeling of intrusion. Then he turns his attention back on the bitch in front of him. He takes the spiked dildo and slides it over the woman’s pussy. When his dad pushes a second finger into Harold’s hole, Harold pushes the dildo into the woman’s pussy. The woman screams as Harold fucks her with the dildo. Her legs kick around in an effort to get Harold to stop. Tears well up in her eyes that are wide open.
A green light flashes passed Dean. He looks at it in wonder. It’s followed by flashes of more lights. Green, red, purple. Dean smiles at them as his blood soaks his shirt. His hands push the sword in further until they hit some resistance. Dean takes a firmer hold and pushes hard. He needs to get the sword in further. It’s the only thing that matters. The sword needs to penetrate his whole body.
A tear falls from Neville’s eye. He can’t believe what he’s hearing. They raped Harry before they killed him, made him into nothing more than a doll to be fucked. He’s heard before that most of Voldemort’s victims are found naked and degraded. But he never thought the same would happen to Harry. Or any of his friends.
Narcissa looks up and shouts: “Don’t you touch him!” Her eyes are locked with Bellatrix’s. Narcissa is not surprised to find no anger in them, or sorrow for the loss of her nephew, just glee and excitement. Before Bellatrix went to Azkaban, Narcissa would have thought the death of her family would mean something to her sister. But now she knows that the only thing Bellatrix cares about is torture and death. And pleasing her Dark Lord. Off course she is happy that Draco is gone. She could never except that Draco knew how to please their Lord better than her. She’ll be the number one again, the one who shares the Dark Lord’s bed.
Harold likes the kisses the most. The way Rodolph licks into his mouth and moans around his lips is fun. He wants daddy to kiss him all the time. And when Bellatrix joins them in bed, that is all that he needs to do. And let Rodolph push his finger into his hole. Dad loves it, so Harold lets him. It feels strange most of the time, but not bad strange, nice strange. And it almost doesn’t hurt anymore. Rodolph told Harold that it will get better the more they do it, that it will hurt less and less. And then one day, when it doesn’t hurt anymore, Rodolph will show Harold true pleasure by fucking him into the mattress. Harold can’t wait.
Dean is cold and he shivers. He tries to stop the bleeding from his stomach with his hands, but it’s no use. There is too much blood spilling from his body. He will die, and it will all be for nothing. He will never kiss Seamus again. Is Seamus even still alive? Dean hasn’t seen him in a while. He went missing before the retrieve an hour ago. Chances are Seamus is long gone. He would have found Dean by now if he was still alive, wouldn’t he?
“Dean lay still. Let me help you,” Ginny suddenly says. She hovers over him and Dean tries to smile at her. He hasn’t noticed her before. When did she get here? How long ago was it that Fenrir was here, pulling Hermione with him?
Mr Goyle raises his wand. The word Crucio leaves his lips and the woman screams from the pain. Her hand and knees slip to the sides and she ends up spread out on the floor. The adults laugh and Harold can’t help the smile that forms on his face. It’s fun to watch that stupid Muggle get what she deserves.
Time passes and the sounds move away from Dean. He’s sure the fighting has moved into the school. He lifts his head and looks around. He can see Neville’s dead body in front of him, the beheaded snake next to it. Well, at least Dean has stopped Neville from being eaten. There will still be a body to bury when this war is over. If the right side wins. Dean doesn’t want to think about what would happen to them if Voldemort wins this battle. Will they lay here until the animals and elements destroy what’s left of them? Or will Voldemort disgrace them even more?
Hermione gets pushed onto the ground. She kicks against Greyback and pushes his face away with her hands. She fights with all she’s got to get away from this monster.
The world is black when Narcissa reopens her eyes. The pain is gone, but she can still feel the rope around her neck. She tries to breathe only to find that she can’t. She lifts her hands so she can grab onto the rope and lift herself, but her hands find no rope. The air above her is empty. She looks up, but she can’t see the tree. The world is completely dark. She moves her feet around, but the ground they could just touch moments ago isn’t there anymore.
The rope holds and Narcissa smiles. She can feel it cut into her throat. Narcissa opens her mouth to breath, but no air finds it’s way into her longs. She will be with Lucius and Draco soon, where she needs to be.
“Goodnight, son,” is the last thing he hears before he falls asleep, dreaming of the young boy dying with a smile on his face.
Narcissa looks around her, scanning the trees. There is one close by, at the edge of the clearing, that has beautiful flowers growing underneath it. A branch hangs over it to cover them, to give shade on the warm days of summer. Narcissa stands up and walks towards it. She reaches for the branch and finds out that she can hold on to it if she stands on the tips of her toes. It will work. This will be perfect. The final resting place of the Malfoy line.
Draco slides his cock into Potter’s mouth and pushes Potter’s head all the way against his crotch. Then he pulls him out a little before pushing back in. Potter sputters around his cock, only urging Draco on to push even deeper into his throat. Draco finds a nice rhythm and lets out a pleasant moan. The Dark Lord kisses Draco’s neck and lets his hands roam over Draco’s chest. Aunt Bella lets the Imperius slip and Potter starts to fight the intrusion again. He pushes his hands against Draco’s stomach and tries to push him off him. But it’s no use, Draco has a good firm hold on his hair and keeps his cock inside his mouth without much fight.
Dean knows he has to lie to get her to help Hermione. He hates lying to Ginny. She was once a great girlfriend and an amazing friend after the break-up. And she’s powerful. She will be able to save Hermione. Then at least Dean would have done one last good thing before he goes.
In the corner of her eyes, Narcissa sees the green light that kills the Potter boy. She doesn’t care. That boy has cost her her entire family. He deserved to die. It should have been only him who passed away tonight. Draco didn’t deserve to go, to be slaughtered in front of everyone, downgraded to a whore for the Dark Lord’s pleasure.
“Still alive. But not for long,” Greyback says. His hand takes hold of the hilt of the sword and pulls it out of Dean’s stomach. He lifts the sword to his mouth and licks some of the blood of it. “Now, let’s go find a quiet place,” he says. He starts to walk away from Dean, and Hermione gets pulled along. She tries to glance back at Dean and see if he’s okay. Only her head is pulled into the other direction. Maybe someone else will find Dean in time to save him.
“I will never leave you,” he says. And then he kisses Draco again. “You are mine from now until the day I die,” he promises.
Harold shakes his head and closes the door behind him before he lays down next to Draco. “Forget him. He’s an idiot.”
In the meantime, Rodolph and Rabastan have pulled the dead boy’s body out of his father's hands. The man is forced to stand next to his wife by Barty. “Look at her, see how she finds pleasure in her kill,” Barty tells him.
But it’s all no use. Over and over again, Nagini comes for him and swallows a part of him or his entire body. Dean’s flesh is burning and he feels sick from the pain. He fights to not be eaten, and somehow he always escapes. Only to be eaten again. And again. For the rest of eternity. Always in pain from the digesting fluids of Nagini, but never for long enough to perish and find peace.
Draco lifts his head and looks at Harold. “How can I forget him? He’s my father. It’s not like he’s going to disappear just because I want it.”
Rodolph takes Harold’s hand and guides him down the stairs. Bellatrix smiles at them when they pass. She sits on top of the man as she uses the Cruciatus curse on him.
Rodolph sits down next to Harold and places a wet kiss on his neck. “You’re sure you don’t want me to take you to bed?”
Greyback laughs. “He’s got something I want,” he says. He kicks against Dean’s body hard enough for it to turn onto its side. A horrible scream comes from it. It causes another laugh from Greyback. Hermione is shocked into silence again. Dean is in pain, that is clear. His eyes are bloodshot, and his face is pale. A tear falls from Hermione as she again tries to free herself, so she can stop Greyback from conflicting more pain to Dean. She smashes her hands against Greyback’s legs, she tries to pry his hand from her hair. But it’s all in vain.
Green light fills the hallway and Potter falls like a marionette whose strings were cut. The Dark Lord’s Avada Kedavra as effective as always. Rodolph’s hands slide around Bellatrix waist. “This is fun,” he says.
Rodolph drops the topic and just lays down on his back. Without another word, Draco kneels in between Rodolph’s legs and takes Rodolph’s cock in his mouth. Harold holds up his fingers and Rodolph lubes them up. Harold sits down behind Draco and pushes into Draco’s hole. His other hand is placed on top of Draco’s head. He pushes Draco down on Rodolph’s cock and holds him in place. Rodolph thrusts upwards into Draco’s throat. Draco’s head turns red and his body starts to shake as he fights to get some air. He tries to lift his head, but Harold holds him down. Draco’s arms twitch and slide away, unable to keep Draco up any longer. His head falls down and Harold pushes him further onto Rodolph’s cock. Draco’s eyes are wide as his legs tremble between them.
“Yes, die for me,” Rodolph says. His thrusts become more erratic and then he screams. His face is pure bliss. The boy trashes around one more time and than goes completely limp. Harold licks with his tongue over his lips as he stares with wide eyes at the dead boy.
Harold nods and fights to keep his eyes open. Rodolph pushes Harold’s sweater and shirt over his head. His hands linger on Harold’s naked chest, stroking his sides and pulling Harold closer toward him.
Harold stares at the fireplace. The flames have turned yellow again after Draco and his father left some seconds ago. They were the last to leave. Draco didn’t want to, he wanted to stay until midnight, as it was Harold’s birthday until then. Only Lucius wouldn’t let him. Harold thinks it’s unfair. It’s his birthday, and if he wants Draco here until midnight, he should be allowed to stay the night.
Draco pulls out before he gets to close. He doesn’t want this to be over yet. He pushes Potter backwards on the ground and kneels in between his legs. “Have you ever been fucked, Potter?” Draco asks.
“Sorry,” Harold says as he sits down next to Draco. “Just thinking about my dad. He’s never angry at me.”
Harold falls down too and then turns to his side so he can look at Draco. “I’ll try to never get angry at you. And if I ever do, know that I still love you.”
Rodolph looks up and spots the boys hanging through the railing. He smiles at them but doesn’t say a word. He will let them watch for as long as they want. Harold just hopes uncle Lucius doesn’t spot them and breaks up the party. The man still believes that Draco should not be subjected to rape and murder. If only the man knew what happens when Draco stays at Harold’s place alone and Rodolph joins their make-out sessions. Harold is sure that Lucius wouldn’t approve of the way Draco would get used by Harold and Rodolph.
In the meantime, Harry carefully crawls away from them. Maybe he can make a run for it. It’s clear Voldemort won’t keep his side of the deal after he kills Harry. He said so himself. If only Dumbledore and Snape hadn’t died last year, then maybe someone would have been able to tell Harry how to stop this man. Harry doesn’t know for sure if Hermione, Ron and he have found all Voldemort’s Horcruxes. The ones they did find are destroyed, except for the snake. Harry hopes it’s enough. He knows his friends will fight to the end if necessary. He’s sure of it. Harry just hopes they will survive.
“The boy who lived, comes to die,” the Dark Lord says. Draco looks at the man. He looks giddy as he holds his wand in front of him. Aunt Bella cheers beside him.
“I wish I knew how to cast a warming charm,” Harold says. He looks out of his window. The balcony is white with snow, but the sky is bright tonight. It would have been nice to sit on the balcony so he could watch the stars.
Rodolph takes his wand and opens the cell. He puts an Imperius curse on the woman. She stands up and walks out of her cell and to the table in the middle of the room. She sits down on it and then lays down on her back. Harold walks over to her and lets his hand slide over her body. He caresses her cheek and his thumb slides over her lips. The hand slides over her throat and Harold squeezes it slightly. The woman lets it all happen to her. Harold doesn’t like it that she doesn’t fight back so he lets her go again. His hand slides further down and squeezes her breast. They are firm and the nipples are hard.
Draco lets out a muffled no. Harold is relieved. He hates it when Draco is hurt, knowing Draco’s father wants him to keep his wounds to teach him a lesson. It’s brutal and unfair.
“He’s all yours,” the Dark Lord says. He steps over Potter’s body and walks up the stairs. Bellatrix follows him. She doesn’t need to see what Barty will do to Potter’s body. She doesn’t understand the fascination the boy has with dead people. Bellatrix prefers them screaming and fighting for their lives. Once that spark is gone, they are just bodies, shells of what they used to be.
The kiss that follows is more intense than all the kisses they ever shared. Harold lays back down and turns them around so he’s on top of Draco. His lips travel down Draco’s body. Over his nipples, down his stomach. He kisses Draco’s hard cock and then licks his tongue down Draco’s split. He utters the lubrication spell his father always uses and then pushes a slick finger against Draco’s hole. It slides in a little.
Rodolph takes a hold of Harold’s hips as Harold’s lowers his ass over Rodolph’s cock. Harold rides him, but his eyes are fixed on Draco’s unconscious body next to them. Draco is so beautiful like this. His eyes rolled into the back of his head, his mouth open with his tongue sticking out a little. His face is red, but the rest of his body paler than usual.
Hermione screams and cries. She digs her hands into the ground beneath her and rests her head in between them. There is no escape as she is raped forcefully. When Ron kissed her for the first time, only a couple of hours ago, Hermione thought that once this war would be over she would lose her virginity to the man she loves. She envisioned how Ron would take care of her and make her enjoy every moment of that special moment. But that moment is now robbed from her. Stolen by a werewolf. Destroyed by the man that is going to kill her tonight.
Draco smiles and takes a hold of Harold’s shoulders. “You are the best friend ever,” he says. Then he screams for Dobby who pops into existence next to the boys. He bows deep and waits for his orders.
Harold and his friends watch as Rodolph opens his robes and pulls out his hard cock. He kneels in between the woman’s legs and pushes his cock into her back hole without any preparation. The woman screams in pain and uses her hands to try to crawl away from the intrusion. Rodolph laughs and fucks the woman. It’s enough to get the other man get into the mood. Mr Crabbe also takes out his cock and kneels in front of the woman’s face. He lifts her head and then pushes his cock into her mouth. It doesn’t take the men long before they both finish inside her and pull out. The woman slumps on the floor, some of the sperm leaks out of her mouth.
“You’ve watched your mother to ofter,” Rodolph laughs as he picks up his wand and taps it against the dildo inside the woman’s vagina. The dildo pushes in and out of its own accord. Harold watches as blood starts to spill around it.
Rodolph takes off his robes and sits down behind Harold. A slick finger enters Harold’s hole. “Go on, keep fucking him with your hand,” Rodolph tells Harold. Harold complies and continues his truths into Draco’s ass. It doesn’t take long before Rodolph slides his cock into Harold. Then he slides his hand back on top of Harold’s hand and helps him choke Draco. Draco’s face turns red. His mouth is wide open, but no sound comes from it. His eyes become larger than Harold has ever seen. It’s a beautiful sight.
Draco let’s go of the rose stem and bends his head towards Harold’s. His eyes twinkle and Harold smiles.
Potter stands in front of the Dark Lord. His arms to his sides, his face determent. A cut is visible on his left cheek, with a blood trail running down to his chin. Draco can’t believe the idiot has come. Doesn’t he know he is going to die now? There is no way the Dark Lord is going to let the boy wonder life. After all these years, Draco will finally be rid of the boy wonder. The thought brings a smile to Draco’s face.
“How?” Harold asks. He places a soft kiss on Rodolph’s pants. Rodolph lets his hand slide through Harold’s hair and pushes his face against his pants. Harold can feel Rodolph’s hard cock. Harold wonders what it tastes like to take it in his mouth, as he’s seen Bellatrix do a couple of times by now. Daddy always likes it when Bellatrix does that to him. Maybe soon, Harold can do the same for his daddy.
“She’s hot,” Vincent whispers. Harold agrees. Draco just shakes his head and then rests it on Harold’s shoulder. He’s never interested in woman. Draco told Harold he never will be. That he only wants Harold. And maybe some other men on the side. But women are just gross, according to him. Harold isn’t that picky. Of course, nobody is Draco. But he likes to watch his parents torture Muggles, no matter if they are male or female, adult or child. It’s all the same. They’re all defenceless and die in pain. It’s a beautiful sight. One Harold is sure he will never get tired of.
Another cry comes from the bundle of cloth beneath the bench and Harry and Malfoy look down at the same time. In the cloth is something that looks a little like a baby, only it’s legs and arms are too long and extremely thin. It just seems wrong, in all kinds of ways. It makes Harry shiver. The creature feels like pure evil and Harry wants to throw it away and never see it again.
For some time Narcissa just sits there, her hands resting on top of the robe, somehow still trying to connect to her dead son. She can hear fighting in the distant and she knows the war continues. Only she doesn’t care anymore who wins or loses. What is the point of a better world if her son isn’t here to live it? Why did they stay with the Dark Lord, if he only meant to end them all? The only thing Narcissa can still do is show him what an end means. Others will hear, and they will abandon him. Narcissa’s life can still mean something.
“You’re ready to go to bed, my boy?” Rodolph asks. Harold nods his head and puts down his crayon. Rodolph lifts him from his chair and throws him over his shoulder. Harold squeaks and hits his daddy on his back.
“What happened? Rodolph, fuck, wake up,” Bellatrix hears Rabastan say in the distance. Her head throbs and the little boy still cries. Bellatrix opens her eyes and sees the boy still standing in his cot, his blue pyjamas covert in dust. His mother lays dead in front of him. Bellatrix looks around. There is no sign of the Dark Lord, nothing but his wand, abandoned on the floor. Bellatrix crawls towards it and takes it in her hands.
Draco smiles and pushes himself up. He takes his sweater and pulls it over his face. Then he loses his belt and takes off his trousers. Harold watches with a swelling heart as Draco takes a hold of his pants and pulls them down.
Rodolph laughs behind him. Harold places a kiss on the woman’s lips as she stares at him in disbelief. Then he turns and walks over to the table with the torture tools. There are a couple of knives and even a sword. Some ropes, sticks and whips. And then there are the things that Harold has never seen before. He picks up one of the long shafts filled with spikes.
Harold looks at Draco and smiles. He doesn’t care about the peacock, but the look on Draco’s face is beautiful. His eyes glister and his cheeks are a little red. Harold could stare at it all day.
Harold reaches out his hand and pulls Draco back towards him. “I love how obsessed with death you are,” he says. He gives Draco a small peck on his lips. “And how you enjoy it when I strangle you.” Another soft kiss follows. “And I love how you want only me.” The next kiss last longer. “And how I will be the one who will one day take your life.” Tongues are part of the kiss that follows. Harold pushes Draco’s sweater out of the way so he can room his hands over Draco’s naked skin.
Harry looks around and sees Voldemort watch him with his blood-red eyes. They glitter in the dark. It’s clear Voldemort loves to kill. And there is no doubt in Harry’s mind that he’s next.
“Don’t get my hopes up,” Draco says as he drops his head back on the bed. “I will just get disappointed,” he mumbles into the sheets.
When Harry opens his eyes the sky is white. Something cries close by and Harry turns his head. He can’t see where the cries come from. The world around him is just white. Harry sits up and looks at his own body. He’s still naked, but Malfoy’s blood that spilt on him when Malfoy died has disappeared. He slowly gets to his feet and wonders if this is heaven. And if it is, where are his parents? Surely they would have been here to great their son?
Bellatrix kneels next to her. Narcissa doesn’t look up to her, she just looks into Draco’s eyes. His once filled with life grey orbs. Now they are empty and dull, so different from how Narcissa remembers them. She used to love watching his eyes explore the world when Draco was just a baby. She watched them be filled with admiration, fear, confidence. They had always been the place where you could see what Draco truly felt. And now they don’t show anything anymore. A tear falls from Narcissa’s eye as she moves her gaze away from Draco’s eyes.
Nagini crawls around him again and then takes Dean in her mouth. His head disappears into her body. It hurts as the sticks and needles pinch into Dean’s eyes and mouth. Dean grabs Nagini’s head and pulls his head free.
The Dark Lord forces the door open to the baby’s bedroom. Potter’s wife stands there, holding her boy. Bellatrix wants to hurt her, destroy the one thing that this woman had taken from her. She raises her wand and bears her teeth. Potter’s wife puts the boy in his cot behind her and throws her arms wide, like that will save her child.
Aunt Bella kneels by Potter’s head and takes out her favourite blade. She slides it over Potter’s cheek and the boy whimpers. Draco feels the pleasure build up in his balls, feels them tighten and he knows he’s close. With every thrust against his prostate, every slide into Potter’s bleeding hole, it comes closer.
Harold sits down in a massive lounge chair and stares at his parents that sit on the sofa. Bellatrix gives Rodolph a small box that contains a new ring for him to wear. He loves it and kisses Bellatrix on the cheek.
“The giant spawn can carry him,” the Dark Lord says. Hagrid is forced to pick up the Potter boy. His naked body is covered with Draco’s blood. He’s on full display as Hagrid holds him up. One of his arms slides out of Hagrid’s embrace and swings lifelessly while the crowd starts to move away from the clearing in the forest. Nobody pays any attention to Narcissa, sitting on the forest floor with the naked body of Draco in her lap. None of her friends asks her if she’s okay. They just leave her alone with her grief. A forgotten memory already.
“You will pay for this,” Voldemort says. He lifts his wand and suddenly Dean feels at peace. He doesn’t have to worry about the war or how it will end. It doesn’t matter that he’s in the middle of a battle, or that he just killed Voldemort’s snake and is under his attack. All is well and will forever be. Dean doesn’t worry about anything anymore. No, he smiles as he feels fantastic. The best he’s felt in years. His anxiety from moments ago is gone, just like the urge to act. Everything is perfect now.
Harold rests his forehead against Rodolph’s and tries to relax. He breaths in and out slowly. He’s wide awake by now and he is fascinated by how his mom is bend over his dad’s cock. Rodolph pushes her further down and she moans. The finger in his ass starts to move up and down in the same rhythm as Bellatrix’s movements. Harold lets his small hand slide over Rodolph’s chest and Rodolph takes his mouth in his again. They kiss for a long time and Harold is glad to notice that the pain in his ass is fading away and gets replaces by something else. It feels nice and Harold doesn’t want it to stop.
“Pull them as tight as you can,” Bellatrix tells Harold. “And don’t stop until your daddy tells you to.”
“You leave him alone. He’s a hero,” Hermione yells. She doesn’t want to know what Greyback wants to do with him. Dean deserves to be at peace. His body shouldn’t be desecrated after what he did.
Harold smiles and rests his hands on his dad’s buttocks. He squeezes them and places kisses against his fathers back. Even when Harold is old, his father will still want him, and that is the best gift Harold has gotten today.
Narcissa brushes her hand through Draco’s hair when she looks back at his face. With his eyes closed, she can almost fool herself by pretending he’s just asleep. But the blood that still drips from his nose, and covers his lips and chin give away that he’s no longer here. Narcissa slides a finger over the open wound on Draco’s throat. It’s deep, cutting halfway through it, exposing body parts that should be hidden. Narcissa her hand slides further down, over Draco’s arm that hangs loosely to the side. She lifts it and places it on Draco’s stomach. He shouldn’t be naked. Only enemies are left uncared for, humiliated and abandoned. Draco deserves better. He deserves a proper burial. One that was stolen from his father. Narcissa won’t have it be stolen from her boy.
Harold leans his head forwards and Draco’s eyes widen a little. They are beautiful. Grey with a hint of silver. Harold moves his arm and lays it on Draco’s side and then he moves in even closer.
Neville falls to the ground and rolls around. He loses the sorting hat. Something shiny is visible inside it. Dean stares at it in disbelieve. If he’s not mistaking, a handle of a sword sticks out of the hat.
Draco feels the Dark Lord slips out of him and Draco feels empty. He’s cold and he wavers. The Dark Lord stands up, releasing his hold on Draco. Draco’s torso wiggles until it falls forwards. He lands on top of Potter. What would Potter think of him now? Will he fear his end would be this painful too? Draco whole body begins to shake and he slides out of Potter’s ass. Draco gurgles and wonders how long this will take before he passes out and dies.
“Maybe I don’t want you to come to bed with me,” Harold says. It’s a lie, but Harold doesn’t want to give in that easy. He wanted Draco to stay too. Why can’t he have both? Have Draco and dad in his bed at the same time. Draco would like to see it. It’s not like he doesn’t know what Harold and Rodolph get up to. Harold tells him all about it when they are alone, when uncle Lucius can’t hear. Draco is jealous of it. He wants to know what it feels like to suffocate. How it is when you almost die. He should get a chance to experience it too.
“You’re sure? It will be some time before Harold will be able to come inside you. Just ask him. You’re missing out,” Rodolph says.
Greyback sits up on his knees and takes hold of Hermione’s hair again. He pulls her head onto his chest. He licks her artery. Hermione expects him to bite down and tear it open. That at least would mean this will all be over soon.
“Let’s test how sharp this sword is,” he says. With one swift movement, he lifts the sword and cuts open Narcissa’s stomach. Her intestines fall forward and hang around Narcissa’s legs.
With hesitating steps, he moves towards the door. Ron and Hermione are just in front of him. He can hear their whispers.
“You love the woman that killed your only son?” Bellatrix asks. She puts another Imperius on the woman and orders her to stand up. The woman stands in front of her husband who still cradles their son. Bellatrix pushes the woman’s dress off her shoulder. Let’s it slip down her body revealing the woman’s breast. Bellatrix plays with them a little and then moves her hand down to the woman’s panties. Bellatrix’s hand disappears inside them.
